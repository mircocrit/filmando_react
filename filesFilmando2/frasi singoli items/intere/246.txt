I:331;1;Holds up better than you all thought.
I:331;2;It is a huge, timeless story.
I:331;3;IT's an awesome movie, one of my favorites from the 2000's and Im so glad to own it now!
I:331;4;The wife (and her new dorky husband) brings them over to your house when it's your weekend.
I:331;5;Leave it to him to make a story about an alien invasion of the planet and the freakin' end of the world into a portrait of a man learning what it means to be a father to his kids.
I:331;6;But of coarse, it's brilliant.
I:331;7;if you don't like the changes one of our greatest film directors made to the old story look .
I:331;8;Because it's a cinematic masterpiece and this Spielberg sci.
I:331;9;fi flick is a real fine film.
I:331;10;fi combined with another genre sometimes produces the most incredible results: In this case we're treated to sci.
I:331;11;*The special effects are great.
I:331;12;*The movie is dark and very suspenseful.
I:331;13;"It's more of one of Speilberg's more realistic ""what if"" movies, like Jaws."
I:331;14;The tripods are very true to the ones described in Wells book.
I:331;15;The special effects are very good and the tripods look amazingly realistic.
I:331;16;The acting is pretty good for the most part, other than the fact that some of the people running away from the tripods looked about as scared as morning joggers (and Dakota Fanning's screaming gets really annoying).
I:331;17;It's one of my favorite films and it should be a great pick for any action/suspense movie fan.
I:331;18;I can't say much because the movie isnt out yet, but from the trailor i saw, it looks like it will be great.
I:331;19;I am very excited to see what they will be able to do with CGI and other special effects.
I:331;20;Hopefully it will be alot better than the old version movie.
I:331;21;If this movie is anything like the book, it will be great.
I:331;22;I liked the beginning, it was story building about Cruise's character Ray and how it all started.
I:331;23;It was very suspenseful through the chase scenes and the will.
I:331;24;"I was really into the movie for a while, but all of a sudden, it ended
I:331;25;"What I hate are ""CONTRIVED"" happy endings ."
I:331;26;"something Spielberg is a master at (see his phony dopey ending to his handling of the Kubrick project ""A. i.: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE"" for the ultimate example)."
I:331;27;It's main saving grace is its stunning visuals and detailed special effects .
I:331;28;and its pacing is, for the most part, very well executed (kudos to the editors).
I:331;29;"This had less to do with the 'entertainment value' of the movie (as I still considered it entertaining enough to grant it a ""three star"" rating, though a more accurate reflection would be a ''low three'' ."
I:331;30;"top Spielberg project, ""MINORITY REPORT."""
I:331;31;The TV news tells of strong electrical storms abroad.
I:331;32;There is darkness in the sky and a high wind.
I:331;33;Something big and dangerous erupts from the ground!
I:331;34;Rays of force annihilate people on the ground!
I:331;35;Bodies float by in a river.
I:331;36;A crowd attacks their car after it crashes.
I:331;37;They see tripods in the distance.
I:331;38;Robbie wants to see the action.
I:331;39;There is a sudden surprise!
I:331;40;We see one of the alien creatures.
I:331;41;It has some spectacular events and large crowd scenes.
I:331;42;I had heard mostly negative reviews of this film prior to seeing it this week, so I was pleasantly surprised when it turned out to be an attention.
I:331;43;getting and often funny movie.
I:331;44;The action scenes from the very beginning are intense and well.
I:331;45;executed and the plot flows nicely.
I:331;46;i recommend this movie for its pure entertainment value.
I:331;47;fi classic that modern day Hollywood feels the need to re.
I:331;48;make with a lot of over.
I:331;49;It used basically the same original screenplay by Reginald Rose, but it is modernized and accompanied with stronger performances by a better ensamble cast than the performances given by the actors in the original 1957 film.
I:331;50;This is the worst movie Steven Spielberg has ever made, and it proves that it takes more than special effects to make a good movie.
I:331;51;All in all, the 1953 version is much better than this version of The War of The Worlds.
I:331;52;This movie was interesting to say the least.
I:331;53;But I kept watching it and it got more and more interesting.
I:331;54;i loved how dark almost every scene was.
I:331;55;I also thoroughly enjoyed the chaos that occurred when everyone was fighting over that damn car!
I:331;56;It was a decent flick.
I:331;57;I loved it to no end.
I:331;58;The original classic version was also a great movie, but you just GOT to love the graphics, Amazing.
I:331;59;I know Rachael may have been somewhat annoying with her screaming, but you have got to admit that girl is one amazing little actress, and I see a great future for later movies to come.
I:331;60;So even with the screaming, Still a awesome movie, great graphics though I still would really like to see this on a real Blu.
I:331;61;the original flick was much better than this one in this regard.
I:331;62;"the movie jumps to the action instantly
I:331;63;but special effects are suberp.
I:331;64;Tripods are real frightening and their devastation of earth is believable.
I:331;65;symbols of the USA, and in some cases, the humanity.
I:331;66;thanks that they did not go for slingshots.
I:331;67;there are nice things, be sure.
I:331;68;This is a really, really good movie.
I:331;69;The basic elements of Wells' tale are here, placed into our time and world.
I:331;70;this has both advantges and disadvantages.
I:331;71;Spielberg and Cruise are good enough.
I:331;72;Still, they made the journey itself interesting.
I:331;73;one clever thing that was done here was that everything was seen from the Earthlings' point of view.
I:331;74;"The movie says to us, ""Give us that it's happening, and we'll play fair with you in the context of Wells' basic plot""."
I:331;75;tom Cruise gives a brauva performance.
I:331;76;He's totally believable in his characterization, performance and evolution, and at the point where it appears he's going to sacrifice himself, it's completely credible.
I:331;77;although I think it would have been more bittersweet and better at the end if Robbie hadn't been found, I can accept it, especially since Ray's relationship with his ex.
I:331;78;At the final scene, the movie is definitely over, as it should be.
I:331;79;It's a remake, with a lot of CGI.
I:331;80;And yet I think it's surprisingly good.
I:331;81;It is the first of many, and these machines really are frightening.
I:331;82;Like the original film from the 1950's, they simply obliterate everything in their path, and are impervious to any Earth.
I:331;83;And seeing the panic that would inevitably ensue, is quite realistic.
I:331;84;the story is completely retooled, but has the same ironic message: Nature knows what's best.
I:331;85;there are some points of contention many people have with this film, but it is a very good one, on its own merits.
I:331;86;I personally dont think that Tom Cruise is a great actor, good yes.
I:331;87;It's strictly a special effects film, and its creative sci.
I:331;88;Dakota Fanning did act very good though.
I:331;89;The machines, the weaponry, the sounds are all great, terrific.
I:331;90;You can see Spielberg all over this film.
I:331;91;Overall some really nice visuals all around.
I:331;92;War of the worlds is one of those films that would be amazing, were it not for some overlooked plot holes that when you think about them, kinda ruin the film.
I:331;93;Finnaly a big budgit sci.
I:331;94;Great film of the remark with added modern fx!
I:331;95;Tom Cruise was a great cast for this movie!
I:331;96;"I found the little girl ""Dakota Fanning"" somewhat annoying but I suppose it was good that she was in the film to fill the human factor of a doom type flix and she is a fine child actress!"
I:331;97;make of the orginal with a big budgit, good cast, fx and good story line!
I:331;98;All actors performed well (yes, even Tom Cruise), I wasn't disturbed by Fanning's screaming like many reviewers had emphasized, I thought she was great in the movie.
I:331;99;so special effects take all the credits.
I:331;100;being, blood everywhere, the hudson ferry scene.
I:331;101;every special effects used in this movie were astonishing!
I:331;102;I enjoyed this movie a lot (all the negative comments / Cruise.
I:331;103;The original War of the Worlds and its many remakes were good science fiction.
I:331;104;In the end, this movie starts and ends the same way, which is fine if you held a warm fuzzy spot for the original.
I:331;105;I was more than surprised by this film.
I:331;106;I loved the 1953 film, and thought this stayed true to that.
I:331;107;Spielberg also pays tribute to Close Encounters, Independence Day, and the 1953 film.
I:331;108;this film should win techmical effects oscars, and Dakota Fanning should be on the best supporting actress bill.
I:331;109;This is a wicked cool movie.
I:331;110;The fight scenes are well, both in the terms of graphics and intensity, the acting is great, there is lots of suspenseful music and good special effects(like many movies I've seen before)and the aliens are gross and slimy like they should be, as are their machines and their tentacles.
I:331;111;There is also much love and feeling in this movie, as well as purity and iron will.
I:331;112;I give this movie a 9 out of 10, and recommend it completely to anyone who is interested in outer space or wars of any sort, kind, or like.
I:331;113;Oh and just like with Batman Begins, Elektra, Daredevil, and AVP(all of which are wonderful movies)people took an R. rated movie and did some mangling to this one.
I:331;114;As soon as Ray sees his children the audience understands his relationship with his children.
I:331;115;Instead her mother, who is expecting, carries the luggage in the house and up the stairs to her room.
I:331;116;The movie at this points is chilling.
I:331;117;They are merely going to see the movie to have a good time.
I:331;118;"The reason films such as ""Minority Report"", ""E. t."" or ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" seemed to work so well with audiences is because Spielberg blends the two together."
I:331;119;Both elements are equally important.
I:331;120;It is the background that we keep our eyes on.
I:331;121;And the son, G. d help him!
I:331;122;The son actually wants to go and fight the aliens.
I:331;123;In movies such as these I always find it funny that some people actually think they can shoot at anything and thats exactly what Robbie wants to do.
I:331;124;It is an excellent example of pure popcorn entertainment (if you want it to be, but as I said it could be much more).
I:331;125;That I always need Ingmar Bergmen to please me.
I:331;126;This may not be Spielberg's best film but it is a rousing adventure that takes its audience on one wild ride.
I:331;127;"Just got back from seeing ""War Of The Worlds"" and I didn't love it."
I:331;128;"It has some great moments, some very cool special effects, the action starts almost right away, there are some great ""human"" emotion moments in it."
I:331;129;Aside from being attacked by aliens Tom Cruise's character seems to have greatest luck in the world.
I:331;130;great special effects, Dakota Fanning is great, some great intense moments, but a lot of stuff that is surprisingly bad for a Spielberg film.
I:331;131;crazy slasher, Spielberg took one of the masterpieces of science fiction and transformed it into a cheesy end.
I:331;132;Nothing likable or unique about him.
I:331;133;Ray's son has a paper due on Monday.
I:331;134;Ray tells Rachel to stay in the house while he looks for his son.
I:331;135;ray tells his kids to pack some food, and they steal a van.
I:331;136;There's a brief explanation when a news crew shows up in another working van.
I:331;137;from this point on, the film gets mildly interesting, thanks to some special effects.
I:331;138;Ladies and gentlemen, this film is a dog .
I:331;139;There's one good thing, though.
I:331;140;Tom Cruise has done better work and hopefully will again.
I:331;141;Batman Begins was much more interesting!
I:331;142;At the opening, with the classic narration done by Morgan Freeman, I thought it would be good.
I:331;143;When this movie first came out in movie theatres, I liked it so much I saw it twice!
I:331;144;I have watched this movie several times since, and although there are some flaws in this movie, I am able to overlook them and enjoy one of my favorite alien invasion movies.
I:331;145;my favorite parts of the movie was definitely the parts with the alien tripods.
I:331;146;Another great scene is the military battle scene upon the hill when a tripod comes up out of the flames of the wreckage, or the scene where Cruise steps from the house he was hiding in to a red alien land.
I:331;147;Suddenly, a tripod appears and as one the entire crowd turns around and there's a moment of stunned silence as everyone takes in the appearance of the tripod.
I:331;148;By showing us the aliens, I felt Spielberg took away from the creepiness and mystery surrounding the alien tripods.Yet, I think if you can overlook those flaws, the movie is still quite enjoyable to watch.
I:331;149;This big budget send off of H. g. Wells literary classic pays homage to both the novel and its 60s predecessor and really delivers the goods.
I:331;150;Shockingly realistic in it's amost graphic portrayal of a Martian attack on earth eerily comes across in its post 9.11 arrival.
I:331;151;"Tim Robbins puts in a memorable performance as the insane basement dweller Oglivy, yet another threat albeit ""human"" one to Ferrier's family."
I:331;152;Dazzling special effects by Speilberg, yet once again, provides many heart pounding, surrealistic and nail biting scenes!
I:331;153;I think it is an overlooked masterpiece.
I:331;154;On the other hand, if you're looking for a film that takes a classic science fiction story and updates it to a 21st century, post September 11 world, this is the film for you.
I:331;155;core emotion to the film.
I:331;156;And the kids are just fantastic.
I:331;157;You really feel the terror of this child as she faces world.
I:331;158;Then here is Justin Chatwin, simply fantastic as Cruise's teenage son, who wants nothing more than to seek revenge against the machine that have attacked his world and killed millions.
I:331;159;The range of emotion he shows is palpable on the screen.
I:331;160;In a sense he has to let his son become a man.
I:331;161;If you've ever read the novel, and if you haven't you should, Wells is very good at making you feel the terror of an alien invasion.
I:331;162;While Spielberg and company have certainly taken creative license with some aspects, they have kept the human drama intact.
I:331;163;For that reason, this version of War of the Worlds earns high praise from me.
I:331;164;It takes back Wells' classic novel from the campy 1950s film.
I:331;165;well, that's my take on War of the Wha?
I:331;166;Let me stress that over all, I liked the movie for all the reasons that appear in other reviews (so I won't go into them).
I:331;167;"Easy to understand
I:331;168;It was a real distraction from an otherwise well executed film.
I:331;169;I'm a big War of the Worlds fan, I've read the book, listened to the radio shows (Including the Lux Theater version), watched the old TV show and of course George Pal's wonderful 1953 move.
I:331;170;well you get the idea.
I:331;171;spielberg and company had a wonderful opportunity to make a really great movie.
I:331;172;"i'm still waiting for a good telling of HG Wells ""War of the Worlds"", with modern special effects and tripod fighting machines tearing up Victorian England."
I:331;173;About midway through War of the Worlds (2005) a character justly sums up the conflict in Steven Spielberg's starkly realistic update of the sci.
I:331;174;With this, Spielberg balances just the right amount of jaw dropping visuals and action with mature, real world characters.
I:331;175;In many ways, this is one of the most intensely powerful and disturbing science fiction films ever made.
I:331;176;I've lived in Bayonne for 25 years and I know some dockworkers, so yes as far as I'm concerned he does a good job of portraying a blue.
I:331;177;When it's a magic spell gone awry by Harry Potter or a cute creature from a Pixar flick, it's delightful.
I:331;178;When it's in your face, savage demolition as we see here, there's something profoundly unsettling about it.
I:331;179;Spielberg is on record saying that with W. o. w. he wanted to capture the most frantic moments of 911.
I:331;180;And the movie certainly succeeds at that ramped up visual and emotional level.
I:331;181;dakota Fanning's portrayal of Cruise's daughter is both skillfully realized, yet retains a natural flavor characteristic of a more mature performer.
I:331;182;She's one of the more likeable child actors around and when she screams in terror at the horror around her, we feel it more than perhaps with any other character.
I:331;183;morgan Freeman provides a calming voice of authority and wisdom, just as did in the original.
I:331;184;Spielberg has excelled at bringing us the atrocities of war, along with the human stories.
I:331;185;however it is certainly in the highest echelon.
I:331;186;If you aren't a fan of Tom Cruise you may think about giving this a miss, and that would be a real mistake, for this is arguably one of his best performances to date, from a versatile acting standpoint at least.
I:331;187;this is Spielberg's retelling of the HG Wells classic story, and 50's Sci Fi movie of the same name, done with a modern direction, but nicely grounded in the aspects of the original literature.
I:331;188;He comes across as semi spoiled, embittered, and something of a slob, with very little in his home or life to offer either his teenage son, or his young daughter.
I:331;189;During there visit, everyone begins to witness what appears as a terrific thunderstorm, and with inimitable human curiosity rush to get the best view.
I:331;190;Spielberg really does a great job with atmosphere, and real tension in the terror that begins to unfold, but it's not all CGI and blue screen.
I:331;191;It's worth mentioning here the supporting cast who are great, particularly young Dakota Fanning as Rachel, and Tim Robbins as an underground survivor who has really gone off the deep end mentally, but helps the trio during their escape.
I:331;192;i thoroughly recommend this movie, even if like me you have seen the original, read the book, or have the T. shirt!
I:331;193;Polished from start to finish, I remained glued to the screen, and like most in the theater felt the chills every time I heard the Tripod deafening call!Great stuff .
I:331;194;The Good Things*Lots of nifty special effects and a few good action scenes.
I:331;195;*Lots of thrills and suspense.
I:331;196;The mood and atmosphere of most scenes is very apocalyptic.
I:331;197;*Great style with some fascinating, memorable imagery (such as the scene where everybody's clothes are falling from the sky.)
I:331;198;*Straightforward story that effectively incorporates elements from other film variations and the original novel.
I:331;199;*One or two touching or heart.
I:331;200;i was generally impressed by this version of the story.
I:331;201;"Instead of being a shallow overloaded blockbuster (like ""ID4""), this is a stylish thriller with lots of suspense."
I:331;202;There were one or two scenes that showed a dark, bleak side to humanity, and I found it very deep and fascinating.
I:331;203;But after this movie, I am willing to say, it was well done and well acted.
I:331;204;He is divorced and has his son and daughter for the weekend.
I:331;205;He puts on a good performance as an unwilling father and comes acoss as a bit of a loser.
I:331;206;The wife having moved on to a stable and successful man he is jealous of.
I:331;207;the acting is suprisingly good.
I:331;208;Many have said now that Tom Cruise is crazy, he has become a good actor.
I:331;209;As well as one excellent cameo.
I:331;210;all in all this is a good adaptation of the HG Wells story.
I:331;211;All in all though a well made movie that covers a broad ranges of tastes and should have something to make the average movie watcher happy.
I:331;212;That's right, this is the best movie I've seen all year!
I:331;213;Infact, this is one of the best action movies ever made, in my opinion.
I:331;214;Steven Spielberg is easily my favorite director and always has been.
I:331;215;He has made so many classic movies that are always fun to watch.
I:331;216;This film had a lot of realistic eye.
I:331;217;popping special effects, great acting, good plot, and kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish.
I:331;218;If you give this movie 1 star and say it sucks, well I've got news for you, you suck!
I:331;219;This movie is awesome and deserves all of the admiration it gets.
I:331;220;Dakota Fanning (great child actress) and Tom Cruise were excellent in their character roles.
I:331;221;I loved this movie, what else can I say?
I:331;222;Go see it yourself and have fun.
I:331;223;the action is very fast and precise and seldom involves glitz.
I:331;224;i surely hope there is a extended version comming out therewith added footage of the alien invasion.
I:331;225;"There can be little argument that HG Wells's ""War of the Worlds"" is a science fiction classic."
I:331;226;There can be no doubt that Spielberg is the absolute master of special effects.
I:331;227;The arrival of the first aliens is truly spell binding.
I:331;228;Spielberg uses effects that invoke images of New York on 11 September and the more recent events in London.
I:331;229;Terror thus has a new face and the terror of aliens is absolute in that they truly rule the world for a period of time.
I:331;230;however, overall, I found the film passable at best.
I:331;231;tom Cruise, one hopes you are more convincing at being a husband to Katie then you were at acting in this movie.
I:331;232;"as for Mr Spielberg, I was one of the few who loved ""AI"" and of course his movies of the 70's and 80's."
I:331;233;i like this version just as much, and Cruise (and everybody) did a good job.
I:331;234;It brings you to the edge of depression and loss, then gives you your hope back.
I:331;235;"tom Cruise is top notch
I:331;236;I have always been a fan of the alien.
I:331;237;invasion genre, and have long awaited a decent movie to exploit the subject.
I:331;238;"Independence Day was a joke
I:331;239;of course this is CGI at work and I always appreciate digital that's done so realistically you forget it's digital.
I:331;240;the the other big plus for the movie is how it portrays what monsters WE become in the face of catastrophes on this scale.
I:331;241;There's a great scene when Ray and his kids.
I:331;242;A mob of fellow Americans.
I:331;243;cruise underplays it nicely, Dakota Fanning is great as always and the kid who plays Ray's conflicted teenage son is quite a find.
I:331;244;But definitely worth seeing, especially when the machines are wreaking havoc.
I:331;245;They are quite horrifying to behold, especially the first one.
I:331;246;A good, true to form, story.
I:331;247;It makes it seem real.
I:331;248;A spectacular movie in every respects.
I:331;249;spielberg is a terrific director, there's no argument there.
I:331;250;This movie puts him in the realm of the ultimate director.
I:331;251;It really is essential to the viewing of this movie to have a surround sound system.
I:331;252;You lose so much, watching with regular TV speakers, but if it's what you got, the 2.0 track is very good.
I:331;253;this 2 disc edition is pretty essential for anyone who watches this movie and wonders how they can make everything seem as realistic as it does.
I:331;254;The Production Diaries document the whole filmmaking process very well, answering many questions that you may have.
I:331;255;They are all fairly interesting.
I:331;256;Add in a few pages of production notes and a load of production pictures, to seal the deal.
I:331;257;for fans of this movie and Spielberg, it's worth the extra bucks you'll pay for the extra disc.
I:331;258;He introduces the more scientific part of the story and, likewise, leads us out of the story at the end of the movie.
I:331;259;All we know is that humanity is in their way and they have all intentions of getting them out of the way.
I:331;260;somewhere near the middle of the movie, we are introduced to the human threat, those loonies who were obviously affected by the goings.
I:331;261;This is when the movie is its scariest, as the heroes must deal with the continuing threat of the aliens while worrying about the psychos.
I:331;262;the ending is also well done, a kind of coming together of all the elements of the story into one heartfelt moment.
I:331;263;Not only that, but the inevitable defeat of the aliens is a thrilling moment, especially if you have a patriotic heart.
I:331;264;other pluses include the classic horror soundtrack, great special effects, top.
I:331;265;i'd recommend this for anyone who enjoys the War of the Worlds universe.
I:331;266;It has excellent acting, Morgan Freeman, and a growing sense of fear and panic.
I:331;267;While not perfect, it's still a decent sci.
I:331;268;Somehow the original was more engaging and terrifying.
I:331;269;Okay okay Mr. Spielberg we get it.
I:331;270;Spielberg's 20+ year of first extra terrestrial effort ET though not really terrifying is simply much better story telling.
I:331;271;The first 40 minutes seemed to capture an old time, Twilight Zone type feel to it and reeled you in.
I:331;272;Batman Begins is still by far one of the best summer movies and will be hard to beat.
I:331;273;But if you're looking for special effects and excitement then grab your seat and get ready for a wild ride.
I:331;274;let's start with what's good here.
I:331;275;The special effects are outstanding, as you would expect from a big budgeted Speilberg film.
I:331;276;The images we're treated to on their trek to Boston are, at times, heart stopping.
I:331;277;And the scene with the crazed survivor, played wonderfully by Tim Robbins, has you on the edge of your seat.
I:331;278;in fact, I pretty much enjoyed myself all through this movie until the end.
I:331;279;One, the way the defeat of the aliens was portrayed is anti.
I:331;280;touched building where the mom has been waiting.
I:331;281;The lights still work, all the windows are perfectly intact.
I:331;282;Just sit back and enjoy.
I:331;283;There were numerous overtones to the AWESOME Pal 1950s movie .
I:331;284;Anyone who is really interested in this film should get the radio conversation between HG Wells and Orson Welles .
I:331;285;I actually thought Tom Cruise did an outstanding job in the lead .
I:331;286;this is definitely one to see .
I:331;287;but also see the 1950s version as well.
I:331;288;"fi as well as the original 1953 film version
I:331;289;the alien creature design and CGI treatment absolutely says Spielberg in this 21st century, 2005 production !
I:331;290;the whole atmosphere of the film throughout was pure and utter tension.
I:331;291;So, in that sense this Spielberg version promised to deliver the goods on that level.
I:331;292;if anything, Cruise does turn in a very admiral and convincing performance as a hard working middle class Jersey dad who does not hide the fact that he was more than less of an ideal father for his kids.
I:331;293;great waterworks performance in the diner when his character finally breaks down emotionally.
I:331;294;For a little girl she shows a bit of wisdom and intelligence beyond her young years.
I:331;295;her big round blue eyes convey so much depth and emotion without really having to communicate through her dialogue.
I:331;296;As she matures in age, she will have an awesome future in her film career.
I:331;297;I see her as another Drew Barrymore but with more intensity and serious devotion or depth to her craft.
I:331;298;curiousity that most teens go through in a dysfunctional family environment!
I:331;299;it has family relationship development and everything, which was nice, and the suspense was alrgiht.
I:331;300;i had high expectations for this movie.
I:331;301;what disturbed me and my family most about the Robbins character is the way he closed the door the moment he got Cruise and his daughter into the cellar.
I:331;302;if anyone ever remakes this movie, I hope they'll take their time and do a better job.
I:331;303;but I still recommend seeing it.
I:331;304;that reflect our modern times.
I:331;305;I also liked the link between the Minuteman statue and the demise of the invaders.
I:331;306;eDIT: I forgot to add that there are some nice touches that harken back to the original movie version.
I:331;307;Third, the ending scene of the movie has the main two actors from the original, although they're just sort of awkwardly standing there as if they're lost or needing oxygen or something.
I:331;308;What Bay's films do not have that Spielberg is now showing these pretenders to the throne is that you can have a summer blockbuster full of spectacle and FX magic, but also have real dramatic tension and heart.
I:331;309;working from David Koepp and Josh Friedman's adaptation of the classic H. g. Wells novel, Spielberg goes back to his roots as a maker of thrillers that first showed his talents as a great director.
I:331;310;War of the Worlds has its spectacular CG moments when the alien Tri.
I:331;311;pods first rise up and out of the ground to the look of awe and fear from people witnessing the event.
I:331;312;rays on the populace and whatever else is in their way the film starts moving at breakneck speed.
I:331;313;It's these same apocalyptic scenes of the alien's extermination of humans that has prompted critics (both positive and negative) to bring up Spielberg's use of 9/11 imagery.
I:331;314;It is easy to use blood and gore to bring up a feel of horror, but Spielberg one up's this and forgo grand guignol scenes.
I:331;315;Cruise is actually very believable as a loser father who seem to look at his kids as more of a hindrance and a scheduled paternal duty than something he actually enjoys and looks forward to.
I:331;316;The sequence in the film where they meet up with his paranoid and slowly going nuts character is actually very good in terms of ratcheting up the tension, but Robbins' performance was more funny than anything else.
I:331;317;It entertains immensely and it also shows that when it comes to blockbuster filmmaking he is still the master and everyone else just pretenders to his throne.
I:331;318;The ending fit the film perfectly.
I:331;319;I guess this movie was decent enough, it sure was scary and the visuals sure were remarkable.
I:331;320;There were also a number of memorable parts in the movies such as most of the scenes involving the mysterious alien invaders (who, in my opinion, were cool as heck but about as creatively designed as crap).
I:331;321;all and all the story is pretty straight forward.
I:331;322;Going to the movie's website prior to seeing the movie in the theatres I thought that it was going to be an explosive, completely creative film based on the original novel.
I:331;323;Sure there has been a lot of Tom Cruise degrading as of late, but I honestly expected a better performance.
I:331;324;this is certainly not the type of film I'd ever see again though for those of you, who liked titles like Independence Day, expect something similar to a cross between Armageddon and.
I:331;325;If it sounds like this movie is for you, then by all means see it.
I:331;326;What I have seen is Steven Spielberg's War of the Worlds.
I:331;327;And while the visual effects are impressive (and why shouldn't they be with all of today's technology), the story is under par.
I:331;328;Dakota Fanning plays Ray's daughter Rachel, in yet another stellar performance.
I:331;329;What happens to his character reveals just how much of a protector Ray really is.
I:331;330;the visual effects are stunning, but that can only go so far.
I:331;331;It's impressive on the big screen and makes a great summer flick.
I:331;332;I mean, San Francisco is a big city, who knows what might be hiding out there!
I:331;333;yoga, investing, and software application development.
I:331;334;But after seeing this movie I felt compelled to write one about a movie.
I:331;335;I remember reading the original H. G. Well's novel and how exciting it was.
I:331;336;Independence Day for e. g.,) and adds to the wants of an entertaining movie.
I:331;337;I believe movies are meant to educate and/or to entertain.
I:331;338;movie history to whet your appetite and make your palms sweat.
I:331;339;people listening from the beginning we ok: they got that it was a radio play.
I:331;340;"Because of the format and the skill of the production, many people believed it was a real event
I:331;341;"It was a scandal and debacle at the time
I:331;342;WOTW was much better stuff.)
I:331;343;"now, a fresh look
I:331;344;is one of my favorite movies, and i hate to see it Ruined, and i douth there will be a Recall for this Blu.
I:331;345;This one turned out a good bit better than I expected.
I:331;346;The special effects are very believable, and that makes the horror of the invasion all the more real, but it is Tom Cruise and the little girl who plays his daughter (Dakota Fanning) who make this movie what it is.
I:331;347;Cruise is so believable as a father who is not a hero by nature, but will do whatever he needs to protect his children.
I:331;348;I believe she has a great career as an actress ahead of her.
I:331;349;as spectacular as the special effects are, the movie does not rely entirely on them.
I:331;350;Steven Spielberg has put together the best alien movie in many a moon.
I:331;351;This is Spielberg's own unique vision, and it's a doozy.
I:331;352;"It has all the spectacle of a summer popcorn blockbuster, but it has the tone of ""Saving Private Ryan""."
I:331;353;Unlike most alien movies, this one is actually scary.
I:331;354;Spielberg proves what a genius he is.
I:331;355;This is some of his best work.
I:331;356;I'm not a fan of Cruise, but he is pretty good here.
I:331;357;He has the egotistical thing down, and manages to bring Ray around in the end to a family man who will do anything to keep them alive.
I:331;358;Because, quite frankly, this is a family story.
I:331;359;The effects are out of this world, and are so done so brilliantly that it feels so very real.
I:331;360;In fact, the whole movie is done so realistically(as it can), that it feels as if this is how it would be if something like this were to really happen.
I:331;361;"Dakota Fanning is really good, but if I had to hear her scream ""Robbie!"""
I:331;362;The 9/11 nods are there and are all done quite well.
I:331;363;The big town massacre with people incinerating and blowing onto Cruise was unbelieveable.
I:331;364;Spielberg has outdone himself this time, and this should go down as one of his most astonishing works.
I:331;365;It's big, it's scary, it's unsettling, it's surprising, it's just everything.
I:331;366;War Of The Worlds is an amazing piece of work.
I:331;367;I went to see it, expecting it to be a pretty good movie that would not follow the book.
I:331;368;it did wait a while before action started, but that was necessary and smart on Speilberg's part.
I:331;369;He took the time to let you get to know the characters, and you start to like them, so it makes it that much more exciting and intense when you see them in danger.
I:331;370;He made the characters feel like family.
I:331;371;I saw them both, and the acting was great in both.
I:331;372;Dakota Fanning was also incredible (at parts I thought she acted better than Cruise).
I:331;373;But the intense action, suspense, and great special effects more than made up for these mistakes.
I:331;374;I recommend it to anyone!
I:331;375;dakota Fanning and Tim Robbins performances were outstanding however despite their valiant attempt at rescuing the movie it is destined for austerity.
I:331;376;H. G. Wells' classic tale of alien invasion as seen through the eyes of one American family fighting to survive it, is a great novel however this movie did not do justice to the book, the 50's version seemed to be better explained, had a better plot and was fairly clear.
I:331;377;duration burst of electromagnetic energy.
I:331;378;I read the reviews and noticed that the people who gave this film less than 5 stars mentioned their love of the book and their familiarity with the 50s film.
I:331;379;Tom Cruise was absolutely brilliant as was the rest of the cast.
I:331;380;The producers of the 50s film would be proud of this updated version of the story.
I:331;381;War of the worlds is essentially a great movie.
I:331;382;I liked all the characters.
I:331;383;But our first intro to the aliens is mind boggling.
I:331;384;All you want is info and reassurance.
I:331;385;another screamer) and he finds her in a church.
I:331;386;What impressed me about this movie was the feeling of impending doom that came through.
I:331;387;to those times when the fantastic was still fantastic, and not something allready seen 1000 times.
I:331;388;And they are very very thorough.
I:331;389;I enjoyed the movie, but like many other novels brought to the big screen, it didn't do the author justice.
I:331;390;i thought the special effects were great, and i was thoroughly entertained.
I:331;391;i really really love War of the Worlds.
I:331;392;The plot is quite interesting.
I:331;393;Most of the time you see the giant machines with spotlights shining down and searching for people to annihilate, but you don't really see the aliens, which makes the story a very good mystery.
I:331;394;the plot is perfectly easy to understand which gives the movie a LOT of points because usually science fiction movies make ZERO sense.
I:331;395;I understood what was happening the entire time perfectly fine.
I:331;396;Well, it held up just fine for me.
I:331;397;i guess people don't like action, creativity, special effects, and a memorable, intriguing story in the films they watch.
I:331;398;This was an extremely good film.
I:331;399;"I think that those invested in the orthodoxy of the book needn't worry
I:331;400;"disk wide screen edition) is OK
I:331;401;the movie is fun, has great effects, decent enough acting, and while conspicuously devoid of extras, is definately worth a try.
I:331;402;Yes, I liked the movie a lots good special effects and a lots action.
I:331;403;"lOL Is not ""TITANIC"" OR ""GONE WITH THE WIND"" Nor best picture of the year!!"
I:331;404;There were a few inevitable saccharin moments, this is a Steven Spielberg Film afterall.
I:331;405;Absolutely mindblowing sound design and effects, I can still hear those lasers.
I:331;406;the 1953 version of this film also included a love interest that was not in the original story.
I:331;407;this latest rendition is more a family feud meets the aliens.
I:331;408;Therefore, you will understand when I give it three stars for watch ability and standing on its own merit.
I:331;409;Special effects of this movie were spectacular and it is worth watching, but for the real deal follow the linksWar of the Worlds.
I:331;410;Tom Cruise was a good actor, along with his children, and the storyline was great.
I:331;411;well it could have been better.
I:331;412;But sure, this movie is definately worth seeing.
I:331;413;There were some scary images, but all in all it was fine.
I:331;414;This is a very good scary movie with good acting and directing all around.
I:331;415;Great specials effects, decent direction, OK acting but (and this is important I think) no plot.
I:331;416;Steven Spielberg took an old movie with a fairly believable story and made his remake utterly unbelievable.
I:331;417;All Spielberg wanted was to show how great he could master the special effects of the streets ripping up and use dolby sound to enhance the effects.
I:331;418;Sometimes an excellent old movie is better left alone no matter how much a director wants show his knack for special effects.
I:331;419;But we can tell right off that the true story of the movie is about Ray Farrior and his two kids.
I:331;420;wife has moved on to a rich man named Tim and she is even expecting a baby.
I:331;421;this movie is quite a spectacle and the effects are fun to watch.
I:331;422;It's a nice change of pace to have so much of the story not rely on the effects, yet we still get to see the spectacular effects we expect in summer blockbusters.
I:331;423;Will Farrior and his kids stay alive and will the kids make it back to their mother.
I:331;424;Farrior still has some brave moments, such as protecting his daughter (played by Dakota Fanning) from the deranged Tim Robbins, or when he chooses to potentially sacrifice his life for his own kids.
I:331;425;Speilberg tells the story of one man and his family set against the backdrop of a big budget special effects blockbuster.
I:331;426;This movie is similar to Independence Day, except one tells the story of the entire war, and one tells the story of one family.
I:331;427;It does provide some entertainment.
I:331;428;the Martian death ray is fairly neat to watch.
I:331;429;Later you see ash raining out of a grey sky and the haunting memory of the dissolved people hits the viewer of the video.
I:331;430;Thunderchild gives better than she gets before being sunk.
I:331;431;The best thing the viewer will see for people fighting back is when a soldier gets lucky with a few hand grenades while a Martian is reaching for a snack.
I:331;432;That hope is dashed and the reader then is taken into a journey of an Earth transformed into a neo.
I:331;433;Children are better survivors than adults when the chips are down.
I:331;434;I wish Spielberg had done more with the children characters.
I:331;435;My older than 11 year old kids can watch it.
I:331;436;War of the Worlds is a great movie.
I:331;437;create one of the best books/pictures/stories of the 21st century.
I:331;438;"spielberg has recently become my favorite director, with films like ""War of the Worlds"", ""Jaws"", ""Jurassic Park"", ""Saving Private Ryan"" (one of my favorites), and ""Schindler's List"", he creates an all star path for himself."
I:331;439;Those are all great movies, that either captured our imagination, or horrified us by the realism of life and war.
I:331;440;"kind of like ""Dawn of the Dead"" or ""Land of the Dead""."
I:331;441;fi fans, Spielberg fans, or any movie fan just wanting to see something interesting with great acting and phenomenal effects.
I:331;442;I grew up on the original War of The Worlds and loved it.
I:331;443;This latest version exceeds the original in every way but one .
I:331;444;I had high hopes for this movie.
I:331;445;for those of us who ENJOY movies and like the every once in a while summer blockbuster .
I:331;446;definitely deserving of the 5 stars I give it, and it's the 3rd 5 star movie for me this summer.
I:331;447;The special effects are some of the best I've ever seen in a movie.
I:331;448;It's defanitly not the greatest movie ever made, but I was really impressed with the special effects.
I:331;449;I liked the movie, but didn't love it.
I:331;450;first and foremost, yes you will see grain.
I:331;451;The LFE is what steals the show.
I:331;452;For those of you who have capable audio set ups, you will definitely be immersed in every action scene.
I:331;453;Once again, please check the link above for a more descriptive explanation of the audio on this blu ray.
I:331;454;I thought this film was quite well.
I:331;455;made in that it contained fairly impressive acting, many highly intense scenes, and captured the feel of the story it is based on well.
I:331;456;The intensity especially is what helps to make the movie as compelling as it is, for once the primary action scenes begin, it's almost impossible to lose interest.
I:331;457;The intensity factor of this movie is aided much by the Tom Cruise touch, since his tendency to star in action films has given him abounding knowledge of how to act in such action.
I:331;458;Aside from this, War of the Worlds also introduced me to Tom Cruise's singing voice, which isn't exactly pitch perfect but was intriguing to discover.
I:331;459;I haven't seen the original War of the Worlds movie, but I doubt it's as good as this one.
I:331;460;Conclusively, I highly recommend this movie and consider it a must.
I:331;461;"Spielberg's version of H. g. Wells' 1898 novel ""War of the Worlds"" is big
I:331;462;He captures the book's theme (that humans might be insignificant on a cosmic scale) in a modern context.
I:331;463;The results onscreen are surprisingly convincing.
I:331;464;But most of it still works .
I:331;465;evoking flashbacks to the tension.
I:331;466;The depictions look realistic .
I:331;467;This Stephen Spielberg version of 'War of the Worlds' got very good reviews, adding to the cachet brought to the project by the very famous director, and cancelling out any negative apprehensions about star Tom Cruise.
I:331;468;So, I expected to enjoy this movie and I did.
I:331;469;It has strong similarities to 'Independence Day' which was good, but this is better.
I:331;470;spielberg's stroke of genius which puts the movie over the top, with an enormous assist from young actor Dakota Fanning, is the concentration on the plight of the single family based on the father character played by Cruise.
I:331;471;most film watchers go to the movies to be entertained, and on that level this film doesn't disappoint.
I:331;472;The CGI is the best I've seen, the sets are excellent, and the filming is great.
I:331;473;Even the addition of the family dynamic into this wonderful science fiction tale added to my enjoyment.
I:331;474;but I go to the movies (and so do others I know) to be entertained AND for brain food.
I:331;475;Healing via the mind, maybe?The good aspects of the film helped balance my review rating, but the bad most definitely prevented it from becoming a 4 or 5 star success.
I:331;476;"It's one of ""those"" movies: you've gotta see it on a large screen or it'll lose its awe and impact."
I:331;477;War of the Worlds, directed by Steven Speilberg, has got to be the best movie in years.
I:331;478;And we get the best.
I:331;479;speilberg again delivers great shoots.
I:331;480;The tripod machines, and the story behind them, were amazing.
I:331;481;Also because of Fanning, who once again proves she has got to be the most talented young actress ever.
I:331;482;watch it while you still can, because you have to see this movie to believe it.
I:331;483;But this movie was done very well.
I:331;484;The suspense in this movie was well worth the waiting in line for the tickets.
I:331;485;The movie has been made updated for this generation of movie goers but was well done and directed well too.
I:331;486;the little girl in this movie is just wonderful.
I:331;487;She is such a great little actress.
I:331;488;At first nobody knows what to make of them.
I:331;489;In between, we get fantastic action sequences as cities are destroyed and the true nature of the visitors is revealed.
I:331;490;the film invokes a sense of panic and fear with the audience.
I:331;491;and this is where Speilberg succeeds marvelously.
I:331;492;The direction, photography, acting and affects are all top notch.
I:331;493;the perfect summer movie .
I:331;494;"you wont just be able to ""change the solanoids"" the wires are fried, the starter is fried, the battery is fried."
I:331;495;its right on top of the stairway.
I:331;496;I really thought I was going to enjoy this movie.
I:331;497;i'm giving the movie 1 star, and the extra star goes to the excellent job done in portraying the aliens.
I:331;498;I thought it was truly outstanding and it certainly had me sitting on the edge of my seat.
I:331;499;And the strangest, as well as the creepiest, part of the film wasn't just the aliens, themselves.
I:331;500;I'd watch this one just for the outstanding alien action.
I:331;501;Steven Spielberg's place in history is plenty secure.
I:331;502;with this movie's budget its hard not to be impressed or entertained by certain things.
I:331;503;I went into this not expecting very much, but I ended up enjoying it.
I:331;504;Lots of action to keep you glued to the screen.
I:331;505;but overall, this is a pretty incredible film in this genre.
I:331;506;the aliens themselves are ok, they do remind one of the Independence day Aliens, just about 5 times bigger, but are wonderfully animated.
I:331;507;the site of the martians striding over hill and dale on their tripod legs will no doubt be the one biggest memory one brings home.
I:331;508;happy Steven Spielberg, this takes on H. g. Wells's novel is basically a horror film packaged as a sci.
I:331;509;"The realistic results could be a new genre, the grim popcorn thriller
I:331;510;The film is, of course, impeccably designed and produced by Spielberg's usual crew of A. class talent.
I:331;511;The aliens are genuinely scary, even when the film.
I:331;512;I have a top of the line system so don't try to point the finger there.
I:331;513;o really wanted to make a scary film, he should have done TomKat The Movie!
I:331;514;"Scientology aliens land on earth to ""clear"" your abberations while TomKat do their best to convince a skeptical public of their amazing romance."
I:331;515;Forget that Spielberg knows how to make rousing crowd.
I:331;516;pleasing popcorn movies, and remember that he made Saving Private Ryan.
I:331;517;And it's one of the best in recent memory.
I:331;518;it's also one of the best white.
I:331;519;knuckle suspense experiences in recent movie history.
I:331;520;Once the film gets going, it's a breathless ride, stopping only once or twice for some chilling looks into the darker regions of the human psyche (and a brilliant performance by Tim Robbins).
I:331;521;And while it's an update more than an adaptation of H. g. Wells' classic sci.
I:331;522;and this film is a nail.
I:331;523;ILM achieves new heights of photo.
I:331;524;realism with their computer effects, and John Williams' score will have you jumping, but it's really Spielberg and his stars that make this film the work of art that it is.
I:331;525;Additionally, Spielberg outdoes himself with some brilliant camera work that works perfectly with whatever mood any particular scene is setting (pay special attention to the car ride out of Washington D. c. and the scene inthe woods with the falling empty clothes).
I:331;526;however, what is perhaps most impressive about the films is the performances.
I:331;527;With Dakota Fanning of particular note, all the actors do an absolutely wonderful job in their roles, even though much of the movie requires reactive acting from them.
I:331;528;They manage to keep the audience grounded in the movie, and provide an anchor that makes them important enough to care about, which only goes toward heightening the suspense of the film when the chips are down.
I:331;529;i liked how the storm came and the lightning and the wind .
I:331;530;it had a great dramatic feel to it.
I:331;531;i loved the look of the tripod tanks .
I:331;532;i loved the sound of the tripod tanks .
I:331;533;i loved the special effects of the tripod beams .
I:331;534;i liked the sound of the distant battle between the U. s. military and the tripods .
I:331;535;the distance rolling thunder of projectiles firing was realistic and appreciated.
I:331;536;Again, I'm a huge sci.
I:331;537;Star Wars and Batman Begins both rocked .
I:331;538;War of the Worlds is a visually stunning and ultimately terrifying film about encounters with ruthless invaders.
I:331;539;He is to watch the kids while his ex.
I:331;540;i have to say that the first encounter with the tripod is an amazing scene.
I:331;541;This is very effective movie making and right away put me in the place of the characters.
I:331;542;the film basically tries to top each encounter and it succeeds nicely.
I:331;543;Moving on, we are treated with a Tripod under the water and then an amazing scene of several of them wrecking havoc on the town and people running for safety.
I:331;544;Beyond the probe and alien scenes (which were also effective), we are treated up close and personal to the cage and the organic looking insertion tube where the humans are processed.
I:331;545;This is all amazingly good and terrifying stuff.
I:331;546;A good smack on the head or something might have sufficed.
I:331;547;That alone makes this movie one of the best alien invasion movies ever made.
I:331;548;or more properly, represents its worth.
I:331;549;Here there are positive points: the special effects are quite well done, for the most part.
I:331;550;For instance, the initial lightning blasts that occurred with the sharp bellowing Klaxon.
I:331;551;The sonics of these blasts were pretty jarring, and frightening.
I:331;552;When they began cracking out of the ground the splintering of the asphalt and nearby buildings was unnerving, and very believable .
I:331;553;as effects, these were done extremely well.
I:331;554;one blast, a bright explosion, a swirl of atmosphere, and then the floating down of clothes.
I:331;555;"One clever effect used was seeing a vaporization in an idle camera's viewfinder
I:331;556;Additionally, certain scenes were created with craft and restraint, and those proved especially shocking: for instance, the bodies floating down the river .
I:331;557;Not a brick out of place (though it was sure nice to see Ann Robinson and Gene Barry .
I:331;558;Well, I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised by just how much I enjoyed this film.
I:331;559;that as it may be, I still found much to savor in this dark rendering of the H. g. Wells story.
I:331;560;story to Tom's character, the main overall plot from the novel is essentially intact.
I:331;561;life spectacle you could ever imagine.
I:331;562;But the well documented fact remains that Steven Spielberg deliberately shot the movie this way.
I:331;563;It adds a dimension of gritty realism, an underlying tone of despair and impending doom if you will.
I:331;564;"The ending to ""The War of the Worlds"" has pretty much been considered common knowledge to anybody in the know from Day One."
I:331;565;i would still recommend this film to anybody looking for a darker, more edge.
I:331;566;On that level, I can assure you, it does deliver.
I:331;567;Spiders, muggers, stevedores, women over the age of twenty five .
I:331;568;were very exciting, of course.
I:331;569;an entirely new genre which I choose to call the Retreat Blockbuster.
I:331;570;To show you the potential of this brave (?)
I:331;571;box office gold!The special effects weren't bad.
I:331;572;i loved this movie anyway,the fx were great but the ending was kinda flat.
I:331;573;an extremely powerful and effective sci.
I:331;574;War of The Worlds actually combines a good story with believable actors and stunning special effects.
I:331;575;Spielberg manages to weave so many post.
I:331;576;millenium themes into this adaptation of Wells, yet still remain largely true to the novel and at the same time render a grand scale cinematic experience.
I:331;577;The film works because it manages to show this through the short unbroken narrative of one everyman American Father's experience through it (Tom Cruise).
I:331;578;The special effects are mostly very good throughout.
I:331;579;And Dakota Fanning is really cute and reminds me of my niece, the way she looks and behaves.
I:331;580;cONSTANTINE, and BATMAN BEGINS are two other good movies that are a rip.
I:331;581;off their consumers, and had given us the movie AND the extra bonus disk, at regular price, like it used to be, a year of so ago.
I:331;582;1 star is all it's worth to me.
I:331;583;Then we had the 1953 movie which gained high levels of critical acclaim along with an Oscar for its epic special effects, and most recently we had the Spielberg adaptation.
I:331;584;Well one of the main factors are where the aliens come from and how they got here are a big change.
I:331;585;Clich s galore really.2005 to many for Tom Cruise will be considered the start of his crazy guy years, with all his jumping about and sickening enthusiasm.
I:331;586;These are obviously Spielbergs strong points and they show in this as he wields his special effects magic on the tripods.
I:331;587;Tom Cruise is of course brilliant, and although his life outside of the film may have had some form of affect on the success of the film, there's no doubting he let his personality get in the way of his acting ability.
I:331;588;"I got a chance to see War of the Worlds on opening night, and I had high hopes for the movie because I was completely blown away by ""Minority Report"" (Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise's last work together)."
I:331;589;"I cannot say that ""WoW"" achieves the same level of excellence that ""Minority Report"" does, but I do think it stands as a great summer movie."
I:331;590;fetched and nonsensical, the movie still manages to pull you in and take you on a ride that packs quite a wallop (both in terms of special effects and scenes).
I:331;591;The movie does a great job of setting a mood.
I:331;592;One scene about halfway through the movie really speaks to man's desire to live at almost any cost.
I:331;593;After a seemingly incredible build.
I:331;594;"up of tension, this movie has you taking a deep breath for the expected inevitable climax only to have you asking yourself in the end, ""What just happened?"
I:331;595;But perhaps the most striking picture is the runaway fiery train roaring by the protagonist family.
I:331;596;the performances by the actors and actresses are very good, and the special effects are amazing.
I:331;597;As far as his ending is concerned, Spielberg pulls no punches and goes for a solid emotional knock.
I:331;598;"For me, seeing such an unabashedly happy ending was actually cathartic
I:331;599;this is a great film and will certainly have a spot on my Wish List until its release date.
I:331;600;The special effects are the best I have seen in a movie and Tom Cruise is really good as Ray the not so nice father of 2.
I:331;601;The story is fast and very good and well written.
I:331;602;I thought it was great.
I:331;603;The special affects were wonderful.
I:331;604;I think the new twist to the original was very good.
I:331;605;i thought Cruise's inability to tell his kids what had just happened when he returned to his house (after witnessing the destruction created by the 1st machine) was very credible, and well acted.
I:331;606;while overall I enjoyed the movie and was on the edge of my seat during much of it, I do have some complaints:(1) I would have liked to have seen the military put up more of a fight.
I:331;607;He probably really thought he could be successful in repelling these killing machines.
I:331;608;Overall, I thought the acting was good, and the action was better.
I:331;609;Dakota Fanning is one my favorites, and I thought herperformance was true to form for a 10 year old who is facing imminent destruction.
I:331;610;was poignant, and asking to go home to her mother is just what you would expect of a child this age.
I:331;611;It was the best movie I have ever seen in my entire life!
I:331;612;They kill every human in sight and are smart.
I:331;613;But this movie is really a sci.
I:331;614;There are some comedy events in the movie and the special effects are the best.
I:331;615;Anyone should see this movie at all costs!
I:331;616;WOTW will have you at the edge of your seat and will give you an intense movie.
I:331;617;The movie stayed faithful to the book, in that we get to see just one poor guy (or family, in this case) and how he reacts to the invasion.
I:331;618;The acting is really, really good although there were some weak points in the story (I don't think the Tim Robbins character, although well.
I:331;619;acted, added anything to the story).
I:331;620;The special effects are simply awesome, and I am so glad that Mr. Spielberg stuck with the walking fighting machines of the book.
I:331;621;legged mechanism might gracefully walk, but the moviemakers got it!
I:331;622;I think, overall, that Mr. Wells would be happy with this adaptation of his novel.
I:331;623;What a dissapointment to what could have been an amazing re.
I:331;624;telling of a remarkable sci.
I:331;625;This movie was one big special effect from the beginning to the end.
I:331;626;this makes the older version, with Gene Barry, appear to be even better that it was some 50 years ago.
I:331;627;Those special effects were effective, and frightening.
I:331;628;dakota Fanning was the real star of this movie.
I:331;629;Her expressions, her reactions, her whole demeanor was excellent.
I:331;630;Visually stunning is about the only good thing to say about this movie.
I:331;631;ANY studio with a HUGE budget can create amazing effects, no big deal in 2005.
I:331;632;and believe me, he has made some great films.
I:331;633;"makes ""Risky Business"" look like Oscar material."
I:331;634;"i would have rather paid premium price and watched one of Steven Spielbergs classics again: ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"", or even ""E. t.""."
I:331;635;I am a big science fiction fan, so I will usually end up watching them all sooner or later.
I:331;636;In this movie the special effects were excellent but I never really developed any attachment to the characters.
I:331;637;I will keep this short and sweet since nearly every aspect of this film has been covered .
I:331;638;Otherwise, it holds ground as a very good sci.
I:331;639;"fi film, and it was eminently better than ""Independence Day."""
I:331;640;not a big fan of tom cruise anymore, but this was a fun movie.
I:331;641;The only thing good about this stupid movie is the great special effects.
I:331;642;I bet that would get Spielberg and TLW:JP alot more fans.
I:331;643;p. s. I think that The Lost World: Jurassic Park is Steven Speilberg's best film and he will have to release a director's cut of it eventually.
I:331;644;If you notice the trailer ,Spielberg pays homage to George Pal by using the same street lights as the opening sequence in the 1953 movie.
I:331;645;Class all the way!Spielberg will do it right and so will Cruise.
I:331;646;I'm a big fan of Spielberg's films as the next guy.
I:331;647;This includes Jurassic Park, Schindler's List, and others.
I:331;648;If you are a huge Tom Cruise fan, you might enjoy it.
I:331;649;Spielberg, all I gotta say is Get'cha head in the game!
I:331;650;I give this movie a well deserve 1 star and you should bypass this movie now!
I:331;651;War of the Worlds is a visual masterpiece, but there's more to a movie the FX.
I:331;652;Yep, you got 9/11, and it's right there on your movie screen.
I:331;653;You could literally feel the psychic tension increase the closer you came to downtown.
I:331;654;Me and several of my friends reported suddenly bouts of crying happening at least once an hour.
I:331;655;The amazing thing was that they looked SO MUCH like special effects.
I:331;656;The incredibly intense experience of watching imagery so familiar from the 9/11 while safely eating popcorn in an air.
I:331;657;It allows us New Yorkers a way to process the terror and confusion we felt.
I:331;658;I thought this movie was incredible.
I:331;659;The sheer precision of the direction was amazing.
I:331;660;As I was watching it, it occurred to me that Spielberg truly is heir to Hitchcock in terms of his skill at telling a story by purely visual means, the economy and efficiency of his shots and editing, and how he is able to make a story exciting almost entirely through technique.
I:331;661;That this story involves the inclusion of several very complex effects only makes his technical achievement that much greater.
I:331;662;in the periphery of most shots, which very effectively ups their realism and the sense of their integration with the characters.
I:331;663;For example, one shot shows Cruise looking up, while we see the approaching alien ship reflected in the windshield of the car next to him.
I:331;664;Contrast this to something like The Day After Tomorrow, in which you have the special effects shots and the character reaction shots, which are usually two very separate things.
I:331;665;Upon seeing this movie again, I see that there is an explanation for this.
I:331;666;It's almost charming that Spielberg thinks that most people will be paying attention to this, particularly when distracted by mass scale destruction!
I:331;667;It is certainly an emotionally powerful film and a technically masterful film.
I:331;668;Guess what, this movie turned out fantastic.
I:331;669;"the thing that made this movie great is that it brings back a meaning to the term ""edge of your seat thriller."""
I:331;670;This movie actually makes you nervous, uneasy and keeps you guessing throughout.
I:331;671;"This is a great example of one of Spielberg's ""Popcorn Movies."""
I:331;672;"He does a great job of creating suspense, sort of like he did in ""Jaws."""
I:331;673;Tom Cruise gives one of the best performances of his career, which will be overshadowed by his recent media antics.
I:331;674;The special effects are amazing, but thats what we've come to expect with Spielberg films.
I:331;675;This movie was basically perfect up until the ending.
I:331;676;so I guess that Spielberg is done showing the good side of aliens.
I:331;677;This is definitely the film to see if you're into great action films or if you're a Sci.
I:331;678;This is just another great film to add to Spielberg's already brillant resume.
I:331;679;There are two kinds of directors in Hollywood.
I:331;680;Spielberg is mostly a storyteller director and most of the time he finds JUST the right amount of EXPLOSION and DEATH to make him a cut above the rest.
I:331;681;When the aliens came into the basement, looking for their prey, I thought.
I:331;682;There was actually a lot of hiding and getting lucky.
I:331;683;This could have been remembered along with some of the great sci.
I:331;684;1 5 stars will see it over and over again !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I:331;685;The original 1950's version of Orson Welles' classic tale still strikes me as more the thing wanted .
I:331;686;But the effects are worth seeing (once) even if, judging by the otherwise admirably restrained soundtrack, every single one of the aliens played tuba in Martian High School.
I:331;687;i was impressed with the movie.
I:331;688;fi part of the film, I liked it.
I:331;689;It was a good production with some great effects (imagine that with Spielberg and all) and was well worth my time.
I:331;690;Speilberg and company do it again with this latest adaptation of War of the Worlds, which H. G Wells wrote at the turn of the 19th century.
I:331;691;this is just a fun film that you can allow yourself to watch, and be in awe.
I:331;692;War of the Worlds, remade by Steven Speilberg, is an exciting movie filled with great special effects and the kind of despair one should expect from an end of the world type film.
I:331;693;On that note this film puts you more into the pain that these aliens cause.
I:331;694;What you can expect is a great special effect extraganza which can also make one's mind go numb.
I:331;695;I remember seeing this in theaters and now i can revisit at least.
I:331;696;I actually liked this movie.
I:331;697;I thought Tom Cruise portrayed his character very well.
I:331;698;The original was so good for so long, how can you want to remake such a classic?
I:331;699;But it was done very well.
I:331;700;But, like I say, it was very well done.
I:331;701;so, to recap, updated storyline, still great, special effects awesome, sit down, grab popcorn, enjoy.
I:331;702;This movie is an amazing display of what special affects can do.
I:331;703;Wanting to make this quick the last part about this movie is that it is the same as Independence Day.
I:331;704;If you love action and hate boring dialogue (like me) then you'll love this movie.
I:331;705;"I did remind her that Steven Spielberg helped popularize this ""alien"" look with his movie ""Close Encounters"", but it did not placate her."
I:331;706;I for one am happy that Steven Spielberg didn't decide to jazz it up for the kids.
I:331;707;An intimate study in terror, it is one of the creepiest films Spielberg has ever made.
I:331;708;It's clear the New York terrorist attacks inspired this darkness, and Spielberg has utilized every ounce of his creativity to produce a haunting statement on the end of the world.
I:331;709;Spielberg got so much right during the first hour, including an approaching thunderstorm striking a deep instinctive chord within anyone who has witnessed a tornado.
I:331;710;"Spielberg's greatest achievement with ""War of the Worlds"" is his panicked victims react exactly as they would if this happened in real life."
I:331;711;To Spielberg's great credit, he has gone to earnest lengths to honor both works, remaining essentially true to the novel with respectful nods to the fearsome film.
I:331;712;Cruise's character evolves, as he embraces the core of a responsible father trying to protect his kids amidst catastrophe.
I:331;713;I also disliked the surprise appearance of an important character at film's end.
I:331;714;Great contemplation and artistry went into this work, and the first hour is so incredibly realized the power.
I:331;715;This underrated film is Spielberg's most shockingly nihilistic vision.
I:331;716;It may not be his greatest film, but it's an example of a great American director tapping the deepest of modern primal fears.
I:331;717;Suddenly a huge thunderstorm comes and lighting shots every where!
I:331;718;Dont listen to anybody who says this movie is bad, it is the best and it makes the original look like a trash heap!
I:331;719;What a scary fun ride!And I don't care if Tom Cruise is a little wacky when it come to his personal beliefs.
I:331;720;he is a great actor, who doesn't get enough respect professionally.
I:331;721;I always enjoy his work.
I:331;722;The classic is the classic.
I:331;723;But this movie held its own, the special effects were awesome and the storyline great!
I:331;724;And I understand that in some of the scenes he had to in order to keep the aliens from hearing him.
I:331;725;And yes I have good hearing.
I:331;726;if you want to see a Cruise/Spielberg collaboration, Minority Report is a very good and enjoyable film.
I:331;727;iif you want to see an alien, 4th of July film, Independence Day is a pretty darn good film.
I:331;728;It's a good thing Cruise and Spielberg and even little Dakota have submitted finer films in the past and hopefully this will not scar their futures or their legacies.
I:331;729;Tom cruise dodged the bullet once, but he is a miracle maker, kept on dodging and dodging and dodging.
I:331;730;"Like the invaders it depicts, ""War of the Worlds"" is a big, beautifully loud, intimidating machine that ."
I:331;731;when you crack it open .
I:331;732;the first 45 minutes or so of this movie are thrilling and dread.
I:331;733;Spielberg still knows how to gradually build suspense and how to say a lot with very little.
I:331;734;I love the original War of the Worlds with its advanced for its time special effects.
I:331;735;The remake hits all marks and adds some in making the effects of the rays hitting humans more realistic, giving the main character played by Tom Cruise a more vulnerable, human character.
I:331;736;Tom Cruise was great playing the part of the dad who truly cared but didn't want to reveal that heart felt need for love.
I:331;737;While it does have a nice return.
I:331;738;form, it also doesn't have the thing that makes Jaws and other films he's done a classic.
I:331;739;What comes out surprises everyone: massive machines that have the power to annihilate houses and incinerate people in practically a second flat.
I:331;740;The shots used are really well.
I:331;741;another thing is he has great sequences: the T. rex paddock, D. day Invasion or the Truck chase in Raiders, well add another: the intersection scene.
I:331;742;This is probably the most suspenseful and exhilarating scenes of the year, let alone his career.
I:331;743;Perfect build, the payoffs and really well done.
I:331;744;It's kind of like the show Lost and it's pilot: the pilot rocks but nothing really matched those 2 first episodes.
I:331;745;Jaws worked because there was no moral, it was just 3 guys battling the elements.
I:331;746;it's still an enjoyable romp from someone who knows how to do one.
I:331;747;It conveyed the story of an alien invasion of earth rather well.
I:331;748;Apart from Tom's children, which I found to be annoying, I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys this genre of film.
I:331;749;This, Batman, and Star Wars are REALLY THE BEST MOVIES THIS YEAR!
I:331;750;I love John Williams creepy music.
I:331;751;The sound of this movie is really astounding.
I:331;752;The CGI was the best here.
I:331;753;All of it looked so real!
I:331;754;The plot was good too.
I:331;755;Spielberg delivers something, unique, here.
I:331;756;Our hero, good ol' Tom Cruise, and his kids are in the middle of it all.
I:331;757;This is a good thing.
I:331;758;With that said, the movie is very fast.
I:331;759;"paced and loud
I:331;760;This is kind of a drawback since it gets a little mind.
I:331;761;numbing sometimes but the excellent visuals more than makes up for it.
I:331;762;Spielberg dished out everything he knows about scaring his audience and took it one level higher.
I:331;763;The outcome is an exciting, scary, eye candy movie that might shock and surprise you.
I:331;764;Their Already HereWar of the Worlds is an amazingly terrific movie, and if you have any liking for Action/ Sci.
I:331;765;fi movie, then this film is a must see.
I:331;766;It has everything a young boy could want, but yet it still remains to be a movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat at all times.
I:331;767;Using these CGI's most definitely helps captivate the audience and put them into the film.
I:331;768;Having the aliens and their space ships look so real can really capture and bring the viewer, no matter what the age.
I:331;769;These had to be some of the best CGI's I have seen in a long time.
I:331;770;This film can also be very intriguing to an adult due to the fact that it was based on a novel written by H. g. Wells.
I:331;771;The CGI's again are so well done that you don't even have to use you're imagination on anything.
I:331;772;All the actors in it did any excellent job on making the roles they played very believable.
I:331;773;Dakota Fanning did a good job as usual, fine young actress, but again, nothing outstanding and not enough to make this film a true success.
I:331;774;I believe in staying true to source material while adding the touch of artistic creativity and passion.
I:331;775;All things considered, it's fairly average and definitely not destined to become one of the greatest classics of all time.
I:331;776;"It's one of those ""popcorn"" flicks that are as easily consumed as they are digested and ultimately disposed of."
I:331;777;i give it a 3/5 stars, and a marginal 3 at that.
I:331;778;"But if you recall the 50's ""masterpiece"" with Gene Barry."
I:331;779;"loaded
I:331;780;Dakota Fanning is simply terrific.
I:331;781;The combination of the directorial talents of the incredibly accomplished Steven Spielberg and the wizardry of special effects created an atypically commendable remake of a vintage sci fi classic.
I:331;782;while Spielberg strayed from the H. g. Wells storyline in making the action occur in a contemporary setting, this enhanced the impact of the special effects.
I:331;783;The technology used to create the marauding Tripods stampeding through the countryside was excellent.
I:331;784;spielberg added a nice touch in featuring Gene Barry, the main character in the original film, in a cameo role.
I:331;785;"wow, I enjoyed it
I:331;786;Other than him, and his little sister who I put with only because it's Dakota Fanning, the film served its purpose beautifully, namely to 'shock and awe.
I:331;787;To really appreciate this film, you have to have a surround system because the sound is fantastic.
I:331;788;"In fact, earlier with the ""lightning strikes,"" the sound gets attention in a big."
I:331;789;I've watched the original and I have to say, this is a pretty good remake of it.
I:331;790;I have to say, it was a good movie and worthy of ownership.
I:331;791;This is another adaptation of H. G. Wells' classic tale from 1898.
I:331;792;It has been a popular tale since its first publication.
I:331;793;In every adaptation it has to be updated to accommodate the changes in technology and in our understanding of our solar system.
I:331;794;The idea of nearby life was possible well into the 20th century.
I:331;795;The reasons for the narrator's (and the narrator's brother) travels in the original story make some sense.
I:331;796;there are some scenes from Wells' story that are recast and shown in this movie like the boats and what they unexpectedly face on the water.
I:331;797;Spielberg tells some stories well, the simpler the better.
I:331;798;But this kind of big spectacle is beyond him, I fear.
I:331;799;cruise is ok in this role and the kids do their job.
I:331;800;the look of the movie is terrific and some of the special effects are marvelous.
I:331;801;I saw this with a friend because the commercial looked good.
I:331;802;We laughed several times during the movie, and it's not supposed to be funny.
I:331;803;Speilberg used to be the best director.
I:331;804;His movies were so good that you didn't just watch them, you felt them.
I:331;805;Take some money out of your wallet and wipe your a$$ with it, and you'll feel better than wasting it and your time on War of the Worlds.
I:331;806;War of the Worlds is quite a powerful, intense tale guided by master director, Steven Spielberg, who knows how to move things along so fast that you barely notice any inconsistencies in the plot.
I:331;807;As summer entertainment, it serves a tasty dish.
I:331;808;It shows wunderkind director still at the top of his game.
I:331;809;What follows is the shocking appearance of an alien machine from beneath the ground that shows incredible power and fires deadly rays that disintegrate humans.
I:331;810;Eventually Ray and Rachel come face to face with an alien machine, and what Ray does to save his girl and himself leads to the film's climax as it shifts locations to Boston.
I:331;811;spielberg pays generous homage to War of the Worlds' three previous incarnations including the original H. g. Wells novel (with its eerie horn.
I:331;812;While there are thematic similarities with Independence Day, by focusing on the one family from beginning to end as opposed to a half dozen groups of characters, Spielberg draws a more intimate portrait of people we care about.
I:331;813;He shows how good he is at suggesting violence.
I:331;814;You get teased with glimpses and sounds of something unusual and frightening before the real threat reveals itself.
I:331;815;The film's pacing is very good, and the production values are outstanding.
I:331;816;Of significant note, this mega.
I:331;817;budgeted film took only seven months to make, an incredibly efficient shoot!
I:331;818;Spielberg knows how to utilize state.
I:331;819;art special effects in an organic, believable way without being artificial or self.
I:331;820;The effects, spearheaded by veteran Dennis Muren (Terminator 2 and Jurassic Park), are extremely impressive, and they all look convincing.
I:331;821;the acting is strong, and Cruise and Fanning are delightful in their energetic, emotional performances.
I:331;822;Spielberg needed a bit more interplay and meaningful dialogue between father and daughter, and it would have been a perfect realization of paternal bonding.
I:331;823;"Watch for cameos of Gene Barry and Anne Robinson near the end
I:331;824;war of the Worlds is a tense, exciting amusement park ride through a scary funhouse, and when it ends, you are glad to have survived the event.
I:331;825;The sound in this movie as well as the visual effects is what makes this worth viewing.
I:331;826;He is a great method actor who should learn that he is AN ACTOR.
I:331;827;The movie and director is to be commended.
I:331;828;"When so much talent onscreen and off is assembled to weave a film from H. G. Wells' eternal tale of ""unsympathetic"" interplanetary visitors scouring the earth of we parasitic humans, hopes naturally run high."
I:331;829;"All the combined undeniable talents of Tom Cruise and Steven Spielberg couldn't salvage this ""ruined by its horrid efforts to update it"" bit of suspense."
I:331;830;I wasn't expecting much when I watched this last weekend, but this turned out to be a good suspenseful movie.
I:331;831;I thought the alien machines did a good job of being overwhelming killing machines.
I:331;832;I liked the concept of the machines being here waiting for thousands of years, but I don't think such a thing could exist without any of them ever being found in that much time.
I:331;833;And this movie played out well.
I:331;834;It had the military in there a little bit and that was fairly realistic.
I:331;835;I loved this movie it was full of suspense.
I:331;836;Tom Cruise was very good in this movie.
I:331;837;It kept me guessing til the end.
I:331;838;The story line was great, a very detailed movie as far as special affects.
I:331;839;This is a most see for anyone this year.
I:331;840;First off, Spielberg is great.
I:331;841;She's the best part of this movie, by a long shot.
I:331;842;It's hard to find a really good alien flic.
I:331;843;I was sceptical, but then again I was also really excited because fromt he trailer it did look really good.
I:331;844;It's explained further in the movie.
I:331;845;All I really wanted to say was that it was really well done.
I:331;846;The special effects were great, the acting was decent, Dakota was amazing, Robbins was convincing, Cruise was beter than expected.
I:331;847;i think you will enjoy this film.
I:331;848;There's one scene in particular that will have movie fans foaming at the mouth.
I:331;849;The entire scene, about five minutes or longer in length, is edge of your seat entertainment.
I:331;850;perfection and pretty much enough reason to see the movie!!!
I:331;851;Now don't get me wrong here, this movie is far from perfect.
I:331;852;I had a good time.
I:331;853;There are certain movies you see and you expect to be wowed by the plot, by the acting, by the story (Cinderella Man.
I:331;854;best movie ever) and then there are movies that you expect to be just, how do I put it, wowed.
I:331;855;"You just walk out and say ""I liked that"" you may not know why, but you liked it."
I:331;856;This is that kind of movie, kinda like 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith'.
I:331;857;It's just a lot of fun.
I:331;858;Spielberg manages to duplicate those images here, except updated and now in the U. s. this is also the first time that Spielberg has portrayed space aliens as something to be feared, leading me to imagine that perhaps he is starting to become Conservative in his old age, which would be ironic as his self described Conservative friend George Lucas took a couple of jabs at the Republicans in Revenge of the Sith.
I:331;859;This movie had my expectations raised, after all it was a blockbuster with big stars and Spielberg.
I:331;860;True, this is closer to the novel in content, with a hundred year update.
I:331;861;Kind a sorry I got.
I:331;862;This was a good movie adaptation of the original.
I:331;863;It's almost cute, in a freakish nightmare way.
I:331;864;"If you're a screaming, terrorized human in Spielberg's stunning interpretation of the H. g. Wells classic ""War of the Worlds""."
I:331;865;kickery on a massive scale.
I:331;866;It's an astoundingly visceral, gripping, horrifying film, disarmingly intimate, a ground.
I:331;867;capitalized summer blockbuster, Spielberg has reached back to his revolutionary roots: his camera positions itself alongside Ray, his 8 year old daughter Rachel(the astonishingly stellar, superbly poised, and charismatic Dakota Fanning, who proves herself an accomplished little trooper here), and his sulky son Robbie.
I:331;868;haunted horror pulp fiction is a fine return to form: for most of the flick's two.
I:331;869;and it is, most assuredly, a wickedly cold and calculating masterpiece.
I:331;870;War of the Worlds (2005)This is Steven Spielberg doing what he does best: the action blockbuster.
I:331;871;I loved Jeff Wayne's version on double.
I:331;872;A gem of a movie is The Night That Panicked America (1975), Joseph Sargent's TV movie, based on the true story of Orson Welles' live radio broadcast, on October 30, 1938.
I:331;873;Welles is brilliantly played by Paul Shenar.
I:331;874;"spielberg's adaptation has excellent performances from all the cast: Tom Cruise as dock worker, Ray Ferrier, an ""everyman"" struggling to keep strained relations with his ex."
I:331;875;"despite the story being updated, it's still a more faithful adaptation of the book, including in this version the ""red weed"", a fast."
I:331;876;In the middle of a bright, seemingly.
I:331;877;this is a more superior and intelligent modern sci.
I:331;878;fi movie than many that have come and gone over recent years, with superb special effects, and a story that concentrates more on the dynamic of human relationships.
I:331;879;"there are some nice touches: the dockside crane that Ray operates at his job is remarkably similar to the tripods
I:331;880;John WalkerAuthor of Wrath and Remembrance[.]
I:331;881;The visuals are superb in this movie .
I:331;882;like his Jurassic Park movies, so much of the really intense sci.
I:331;883;and believe me, this is a scary movie.
I:331;884;spielberg also does a nice job of staying closer to the original book version of the story.
I:331;885;It is a good, entertaining movie.
I:331;886;Tom Cruise does a good job as well as Dakota Fanning (per usual).
I:331;887;Spielberg, as always, creates special effects that capture the imagination.
I:331;888;I loved the alien hand scene and thought that it looked cool.
I:331;889;But I thought it captured the fear of the situation very well throughout the movie.
I:331;890;Very entertaining, though, and worth a watch.
I:331;891;From what i saw the movie looks like it's going to be a huge summer blockbuster.
I:331;892;"Lets make it clear, I love Spielberg and Tom Cruise can spew whatever nutty rhetoric he needs too, god knows half of hollywood is nuts we just see a a fake ""every one is full of love and nice things to say"" version of hollywood."
I:331;893;this movie had such promise, yet.
I:331;894;The action scenes are great, and there's enough scary aliens and spaceships to make it interesting.
I:331;895;The special effects are great.
I:331;896;Cruise gives a peerless performance as the deadbeat Dad shocked into defending his family tooth and nail.
I:331;897;Nobody can complain about the ending, either.
I:331;898;It is really about the collapse of society and the social contract, which is very relevant in this post 9/11 world.
I:331;899;The War of the Worlds is a great novel and Spielberg is a director of exceptional talent and accomplishment, so I had been hoping for a lot from this film.
I:331;900;In the event, I have got part of what I was hoping for.
I:331;901;Some of Spielberg's changes are perfectly reasonable, others less so in my own opinion.
I:331;902;It makes perfectly good sense to bring the action forward by a century into the present day, for instance.
I:331;903;The author's own description is one that stays in the memory, to say the very least, and Wells's Martians look the way they do for very clear reasons that he provides.
I:331;904;in fact the best things in the film come directly from Wells.
I:331;905;Even one of the best lines, where the statement that the invaders come from somewhere else is met with the question 'Where .
I:331;906;is a very clever adaptation of a good joke in the book comparing the attitudes of Mrs Elphinstone to the Martians on the one hand and the French on the other.
I:331;907;The Martian tripods are simply terrific, their appearance lifted more or less exactly from the book.
I:331;908;I really would have liked Spielberg to be a bit more ambitious and reflect this more than he seems to have felt like doing.
I:331;909;The Martians' purpose can't have been 'extermination' as someone is made to say in the film, only subjugation, another matter perfectly clear from the novel.
I:331;910;more survives of the view Wells takes of the behaviour of humanity itself, and Spielberg handles the mob.
I:331;911;The artilleryman's predictions are class.
I:331;912;perhaps the very best things in the entire film are to be found in the voiceovers right at the start and right at the end.
I:331;913;The words are lifted almost verbatim from the novel itself at these points, and they are simply awesome, the first page in particular of The War of the Worlds being surely one of the greatest in all English fiction with the last page not far behind it in that respect.
I:331;914;The exquisite irony of the fact that the Martians, who might have viewed us as we view micro.
I:331;915;"I read the H. g. Wells novel as a kid
I:331;916;The depiction of the alien tripods is terrific, and some of the scenes have real power.
I:331;917;Can it be stopped?Spielberg has created another classic film we will watch over and over again for years to come because it moves the audience on so many levels.
I:331;918;War of the Worlds is visually stunning as we watch mass destruction on a scale and with detail you haven't seen before in movies.
I:331;919;even better, Spielberg and writer David Koepp (based on the novel by HG Wells) brilliantly make us connect with Ray, Robbie and Rachel, which gets the audience emotionally invested in their plight.
I:331;920;Koepp does a wonderful job creating a complex web of familial relationships that is a rough, raw portrayal of a family torn apart and how each one tries to function within the fractured system.
I:331;921;Koepp even finds a few moments to lay down some good dialogue, including a moving moment when Ray is trying to convince the kids everything will be alright, but we know he's just trying to convince himself.
I:331;922;cruise is a compelling lead as he brings determination and inner turmoil to Ray.
I:331;923;Best of all, Cruise lets us see how Ray views the world and what he feels is important, and how it changes while in the middle of Armageddon.
I:331;924;It's very quiet, but powerful acting.
I:331;925;war of the Worlds could have been a little bit longer and Spielberg could have taken more time to show how the situation is resolved, but it's still fantastic.
I:331;926;When the movie is deemed superb, the little man is up on the chair,jumping out of his seat.
I:331;927;well the fact is I sort of like Cruise.
I:331;928;in fact I think he is a good actor.
I:331;929;I love Spielberg, and I do still think he is a superb storyteller.
I:331;930;He loves making movies, and it really shows.
I:331;931;He knows more about cinema than most, and this is evident.
I:331;932;I love his work with kids, and Dakota Fanning is great.
I:331;933;obviously anything with Spielberg at the helm is going to be worthwhile.
I:331;934;but this definitely wont hold up on video, as most of the jolt comes from large screen impact.
I:331;935;Mr. Spielberg really understands how to make superior Science Fiction.
I:331;936;even though I knew how the story would end up,it always keeps a firm grasp on my attention.
I:331;937;the special effects are superior,as is always the case with any product from Mr. Spielberg.
I:331;938;"Tim Robbins as ""The Crazy Guy"" is particularly effective."
I:331;939;I had watched it several years ago and really enjoyed it.
I:331;940;I used this movie with a high school class.
I:331;941;My students found the movie exciting and entertaining.
I:331;942;Although the story line was the same, they thought it was interesting the way Hollywood modified the story to fit a movie audience.
I:331;943;The special effects were great.
I:331;944;The novel by H. g. Wells is classic science fiction, an extraordinary book for 1898.
I:331;945;the Spielberg film returns in many ways to the sprit of the book, but with the time transposed to the present and with the addition of myriad modern special effects.
I:331;946;just look past these initial deficiencies and get on with enjoying an expertly crafted adventure movie.
I:331;947;this new film is a lot closer to the sprit of Wells than the 1950s version.
I:331;948;Unlike Wells, whose protagonists are adult males, Spielberg takes the modern approach of following a father with two kids, who are buffeted by events they neither understand nor can control.
I:331;949;the contrast of this slick, fast.
I:331;950;I usually prefer to write music reviews to turn people on to new albums and artists, but I just had to add my two.
I:331;951;Directly from the book, not to mention the excellent 1953 film.
I:331;952;Personally, I go to a movie like this to have fun for two hours, and I, like many, had a ball.
I:331;953;Good CGI can only carry a film so far.
I:331;954;He was still, well, a real idiot.
I:331;955;The plot stayed pretty true to HG Wells' work.
I:331;956;What makes this movie so remarkable is that it creates a very believable reaction from society if aliens were to embark on an extermination of the human race.
I:331;957;pods create such a convincing, albeit frightening, look of sheer mass and mobility.
I:331;958;another wonderful aspect of this film is the acting.
I:331;959;Dakota Fanning does an exceptional job as we don't have to hear pretentiously tongue.
I:331;960;another point to mention is that even though I am not a fan of CGI action movies (mostly because the physics usually take a back seat toeye candy), the special effects here are painstakingly crafted and superb.
I:331;961;This is what it's meant to be, a fun movie to watch.
I:331;962;This movie is incredibly tense, my back muscles were so tight by the end that i had to have a good stretch when it was done.
I:331;963;Seeing it from that perspective makes it seem all the more real.
I:331;964;I thought the acting was fantastic and the special effects were out of this world.
I:331;965;The first time you see one of the tripods will go down in cinema history as one of the greatest scenes of all time, just like the first time you see the T. rex in Jurasic Park.
I:331;966;As for the people who are complaining about the ending, its taken exactly from the book and is a classic.
I:331;967;In a way I was kind of hoping they'd get killed.
I:331;968;Nevertheless I still enjoyed the movie enough to watch it more than once.
I:331;969;Amazing amount of talent expended for such a weak outcome.
I:331;970;stunning not only visually but also in the dialouge, acting, direction and screenplay.
I:331;971;Overall I think that it was a pretty solid summer blockbuster hit, I would like to repeat my statement that this movie was visually stunning and very fun and suspensful to watchGrade: B
I:331;972;the fighting with his teenage son was believable.
I:331;973;Tom Cruise is an actor, a prophet, and expert in the field of medicine, and now he's an action hero.
I:331;974;He's a good one, too.
I:331;975;So far, everything is great.
I:331;976;The dialogue is very good for the genre, and the special effects are just great, but the movie suffers from not developing the characters enough.
I:331;977;The terrorist theme is a good one, and Spielberg keeps it going throughout the movie, mostly in scenes when the army fires endless rounds at the invaders, but as the movie goes into it's third act we see how the idea is lost and then thrown away completely.
I:331;978;Dakota Fanning is very good as Cruise's young daughter.
I:331;979;"An alien scans for people using a large camera like thing to scan their eyes so people must stand perfectly still like in ""Minority Report""."
I:331;980;War Of The Worlds is a good movie, not a great one, but hundreds of miles away from a terrible one, or even a mediocre one.
I:331;981;War Of The Worlds is stylish and very entertaining, but running at a rather thing two hours, the movie could have affored to develop the characters just a little bit more.
I:331;982;I watch it every day.
I:331;983;The special affects really ROCK!!
I:331;984;the sounds are scary and keep you drawn in.
I:331;985;Having crafted Close Encounters of the Third Kind and E. t, director Steven Spielberg chooses to take on H. g Well's 1898 beloved classic War of the Worlds.
I:331;986;fi adaptation resonated during the Cold War period and it comes renewed with urgency in this post.
I:331;987;With David Koepp's crisp script and focused storytelling, Spielberg does justice to Well's book especially in the creation of the malevolent tripod aliens.
I:331;988;Tom Cruise holds himself well as a father guilty of negligence while Dakota Fanning and Tim Robbins give memorable performances especially in the scene where they seek refuge in a dark house.
I:331;989;Spielberg uses the CGI judiciously and juxtaposes the small moments of suspense against the jaw.
I:331;990;With a gloss of nostalgia through the use of Well's introduction and epilogue and infusing the story with sentimental humanity, Spielberg gives us a pulsating movie that balances CGI wizardry with lots of heart.
I:331;991;Moments of this movie are downright brilliant.
I:331;992;There's about 1/2 hour of this kind of stuff that makes it a worth while viewing.
I:331;993;They stand there and gaze in awe at the monsters they KNOW are going to zap them.
I:331;994;Nope!None of the actor stuff is interesting.
I:331;995;Of course the images and special effects are wonderous.
I:331;996;That's why you go see the film.
I:331;997;it has a happy ending!
I:331;998;Classic Spielberg, always a happy ending even when the world is nearly ended and millions are turned into ashes.
I:331;999;He could have made a movie as great as a Brueghel painting.
I:331;1000;Something profound about reversion or arrogance or grace.
I:331;1001;he just has to pander which means he can't make a great movie.
I:331;1002;The book tells of a fantastic and dangerous journey of a journalist as he tries to stay alive from the invaders, and the tales of the poeple he meets along the way.
I:331;1003;the book is fantastic along with Jeff Wayne's Musical version they capture the imagination which will always be far superior than any film can be.
I:331;1004;For anyone who doesn't know the story they will enjoy the film and special effects but for me, someone who loves the book I was dissappionted.
I:331;1005;Spielberg's rendition of H. g. Wells' classic novel exceeds expectations in the special effects category, but the plot and acting are far from desirable.
I:331;1006;liked leading role in a film based on a classic piece of literature.
I:331;1007;This movie has great special effects, but the story line is kind of lacking.
I:331;1008;this movie was something else, I walked in to the movie theater on June 29th expecting a good action movie directed by one of the greatest directors of all time, Steven Spielberg who directed well known films such as Jaws and Jurassic Park, and I thought that War Of The Worlds would be something great but not something this special and breathtaking.
I:331;1009;wife Mary Ann (Miranda Otto whose only in the film for a short amount of time but gives her role justice)whose pregant and is raising her two children, Rachel (Dakota Fanning who does a incredible job, oscar worthy) and Robby (Justin Chatwin whose presence is full of light on screen) alone with her new husband, Tim.
I:331;1010;The beginning is very good in setting this up in such a short amount of time and adds a lot of humore which gets you ready for the incredible action thats set to start soon.
I:331;1011;A great addition is that Spielberg keeps the camera on only our three main charectors, he never for a second shows anything that Ray, Rachel or Robby are not seeing.
I:331;1012;Everything they see is whats on film.
I:331;1013;Its really great and makes the movie seem even more realistic.
I:331;1014;now the acting, the actors are all excellent, all deserve at least some form of movie nominations for there great acting, Dakota was the one who stood out most, even adding more presence and sometimes even out.
I:331;1015;She deserves a oscar nomination.
I:331;1016;Tom Cruise gave one of his best performances to date and also deserves a nomination of some sort, maybe even a win.
I:331;1017;There so realistic in both the humorous, dangerous and just extremely dramatic situations.
I:331;1018;Both movie versions of the HG Wells sci.
I:331;1019;Tom Cruise does a great job of portraying a detatched father that fights to both save his children and to gain their trust and love.
I:331;1020;Dakota Fanning does an especially good job in the portrayal of a daughter who is much less than trustworthy.
I:331;1021;Very dark and somewhat disturbing, it is closer to the Well's story than the 1952 version.
I:331;1022;I had very high expectations for this film.
I:331;1023;dakota Fanning gives a very strong performance as his daughter, and is clearly a young actress with a very big future ahead of her.
I:331;1024;spielberg is a master of crowd scenes and he puts this talent to good use in War Of the Worlds, as thousands of refugees flee the invaders in chaotic and spectacular style.
I:331;1025;dakota Fanning gives a very strong performance as his daughter, and is clearly a young actress with a very big future ahead of her.
I:331;1026;Obviously they had not read the book but as a film maker Spielberg dropped a real clangar there.
I:331;1027;I hope that any future Director's Cut of this film in the future will see a re.
I:331;1028;to conclude, will a film maker somewhere make a film version of War Of The Worlds that is faithful to the book, please.
I:331;1029;The technology exists, this most recent version proves that!
I:331;1030;Just apply it to a faithful recreation of the book and the film maker doing this will have a mega hit, both commercially and critically on his hands.
I:331;1031;This 2005 rendition of the H. g. Wells radio show of the 1940s is a really awesome movie and while I was not immediately receptive of this before seeing it with a friend, I was immediately enjoying it as it progressed.
I:331;1032;"Directed by legendary producer and director Steven Spielbert, ""War Of The Worlds"" is an awesome movie."
I:331;1033;"If you liked ID4, you are destined to like ""War of The Worlds""."
I:331;1034;With modern FX this Spielberg movie does its job with the action part.
I:331;1035;Perhaps an actor who could show more character depth may have won me over.
I:331;1036;Peter Jackson and his team of writers should take it on.
I:331;1037;ending conflict and terror, this is a story about a father reconnecting with his two children on a deeply personal and emotional level.
I:331;1038;"The action, the effects, the way stuff gets destroyed and torn up, the sets, etc., are incredible, and very ""Spielberg."
I:331;1039;"Dakota Fanning and Justin Chatwin turn in fine performances as Cruise's kids, while Miranda Otto (forever known to me as Eowyn from ""Lord of the Rings"") has a small role as the ex."
I:331;1040;taking visuals are further enhanced by composer John Williams' haunting score.
I:331;1041;This movie is a great way to beat some of that summertime heat.
I:331;1042;i loved is movie, i mean the only thing that wasnt absolutely fabulous was the death part!
I:331;1043;"paced
I:331;1044;OK, it wasn't War and Peace, but it was a thriller that thrilled.
I:331;1045;This movie had to be the best movies I ever seen.
I:331;1046;The movie stars Tom Cruise which is one of my favorite actors, so when I watched this movie, the story had a great thrill, and I liked how the special effects was quite believable, how that Tripods took over Earth causing chaos.
I:331;1047;The jumbo jet crashed over houses, lightning striking all over the world.
I:331;1048;This is the best movie out of all alien movies, Skyline, Independence Day, Battle: LA, Battle of LA (Don't watch this one), and much more.
I:331;1049;I recommend this movie to anyone who is allowed to watch it.
I:331;1050;HOWEVER, I really, really, liked this movie.
I:331;1051;handed, but he managed to make a sci.
I:331;1052;fi horror flick that made me feel like a kid again.
I:331;1053;I had a great time with this ome.
I:331;1054;And yes, the ending is lame, but the rest is great, thrilling fun.
I:331;1055;War of the Worlds was everything a great summer movie should be.
I:331;1056;It had plenty of action and thrills, not to mention the special effects were top.
I:331;1057;This movie was well worth the wait!
I:331;1058;I've never been a big Tom Cruise fan but he did an excellent job in this film.
I:331;1059;Dakota Fanning was wonderful, as usual.
I:331;1060;The special effects were top notch!
I:331;1061;A unique mankind faces the end.
I:331;1062;world story adapted (with middling results) from the early 1900's HG Wells novel, this WotW provides a spectacular thrills and chills ride.
I:331;1063;sinister tripods, sizzling vaporizations, thunderous explosions (best workout for a home theater sound system that I've heard to date!)
I:331;1064;Steven Spielberg has inexplicably taken a very good Science Fiction novel and converted it into a Science Fantasy movie.
I:331;1065;Those that don't care about this distinction will probably enjoy the movie without such reservations.
I:331;1066;surely the aliens would have, in their meticulous invasion plan, done some serious homework on the microbe life on earth.
I:331;1067;2 1/2 stars for the action and vibrant pacing + another 1/2 star for the amazing soundtrack.
I:331;1068;"War of the Worlds, the latest adaptation of H. g. Wells' 1898 novel (minus the introductory article ""The"" in the original title), is another in the increasinly tall pile of newer movies that are visually excellent but bereft of a corresponding emotional strength to give those visuals true meaning."
I:331;1069;"just like in real life!"""
I:331;1070;hop and catch the 9:45 showing of that new Batman movie.
I:331;1071;He is divorced from his wife, and she is pregnant from her new boyfriend.
I:331;1072;Spielberg is effective here in confusing the audience in a good way .
I:331;1073;wife because she seems condescending, and her new boyfriend acts so 'rich.
I:331;1074;boy' self important (he has a beautiful new luxury SUV parked in front of Ray's blue.
I:331;1075;A particularly deep crater in the middle of the neighborhood draws the interest of most of the inhabitants, and suddenly a gigantic, 100.
I:331;1076;If you have to think about a movie afterward to have it make better sense in your mind, then that's a good movie.
I:331;1077;It seems a bit convenient that the craft all appear in only the places that offer the best chance for blowing things up.
I:331;1078;this is an okay movie, but certainly not worth a second viewing.
I:331;1079;To be honest i laughed the whole way through this movie, which is a good thing.
I:331;1080;If i'm laughing i'm enjoying myself and that's exactly what you're supposed to do when seeing a summer box office movie.
I:331;1081;The great thing about staying with this one man (Ray) is that we're kept in the dark about the alien invasion as he is.
I:331;1082;like i said i laughed, enjoyed, and savored each scene of this film.
I:331;1083;Which was all good fun.
I:331;1084;spielberg follows an earlier film version with a good technical feat of creating crashing buildings and general chaos following the invasion by alien monster machines.
I:331;1085;Spielberg gets a good job from Tom Cruise, as a working class father, who has been given care of their two children by his ex.
I:331;1086;Their adventures, in trying to escape the monsters and the mobs of frightened people, is a reasonable accompaniment to the technical aspects of the picture.
I:331;1087;this may not be the final word on alien attacks, but it is a pretty entertaining one.
I:331;1088;Ray Ferrier works as a crane operator on the New Jersey docks, and lives nearby.
I:331;1089;He sees them during weekend visitations.
I:331;1090;In this film, Ray's epiphany came in the form of becoming the man and father he never was while he was married to his children's mother.
I:331;1091;cANDY BUT LESS THAN AN EPIC CLASSICTerrific effects, excellent story, but alas, the pacing was just to out.
I:331;1092;world fast to allow me time to give a darn about the outcome and what it was I was seeing.
I:331;1093;Giving the viewpoint of the film to an everyman divorced father with kids, and a mission, was a novel way to play out this material and it was at times quite excellent.
I:331;1094;candy it weighed in as somewhat short of an epic classic.
I:331;1095;Here is HG Well's classic wrapped in the 1950s.
I:331;1096;It comes complete with 21st century special effects that far outpace the 1953 edition.
I:331;1097;spielberg does a nice job of mixing in some narration from the novel into the movie.
I:331;1098;Spielberg is fairly faithful to the novel, although he does toss in a lot of extra stuff.
I:331;1099;The movie will likely be especially nostalgic for those who were around when Orson did his broadcast.
I:331;1100;time Oscar winning filmmaker Steven Spielberg's turn.
I:331;1101;Spielberg previously worked with aliens from outer space in 1977's Close Encounters of the Third Kind and 1982's E. t., and personally I think Close Encounters of the Third Kind remains to this day to be the best sci.
I:331;1102;"fi film about aliens, but now Spielbergio has shed that whole ""aliens are cute"" theory and thrown it right into the shredder."
I:331;1103;And I can understand Harlan, the nut.
I:331;1104;But it's still a cool scene anyhow.
I:331;1105;As much as the film may look like a film about how we will survive an alien invasion, it's also about how will we, as humans, be able to survive ourselves, and how we'll either come together to help our survival (look at the scene where Robbie tries to help people climb onto the ferry), or how we'll end up fighting ourselves (look at the crazy mob that takes over the van at gun point).
I:331;1106;Essenitally it's about keeping hope alive.
I:331;1107;In the opening narration we are told that the Martians studied us through their telescopes with envious eyes, much like we study single cell organisms through a microscope.
I:331;1108;I think it was the best new movie i've seen this year!
I:331;1109;on bit of Morgan Freeman narration to explain, which gives the impression that it's more important to see three random individuals arrive safely in Boston than it is to ensure the survival of the human race at large.
I:331;1110;With the benefit of hindsight, many of the film's special effects don't look particularly good, but an impressive display of sound design goes a long way toward redeeming those failings.
I:331;1111;"A stellar ""dreamteam"" of a cast and crew."
I:331;1112;I never expect much from Tom cruise when it comes to great acting.
I:331;1113;Execrably written and plotted, execrably acted, good special effects, superb sound.
I:331;1114;One benefits from a really world.
I:331;1115;"class, potent system to hear everything on that soundtrack, low impactful powerful bass effects and interesting sounds throughout, for example, when the aliens' spacecrafts ""bellow"" a la a great ocean liner's foghorn."
I:331;1116;The sound effects do shine.
I:331;1117;The classic 1953 version shines by comparison imaginatively and even (for the time) special effects.
I:331;1118;In the realm of big Hollywood filmmaking, a few names instantly rise to the top of the mountain of action/adventure extravaganzas and general popcorn munching enthusiasm.
I:331;1119;These few men are the best of the best in making big entertainment, they are Steven Spielberg, James Cameron, Peter Jackson and their inferiors are George Lucas, Michael Bay, Roland Emmerich and many more.
I:331;1120;Peter Jackson is one of the most over the top, bloated, CGI happy filmmakers of them all.
I:331;1121;so that leaves us with the two true superstars.
I:331;1122;Cameron is a very intelligent filmmaker, using special effects for the sole purpose of telling a good story.
I:331;1123;establishment than anything Spielberg has ever done.
I:331;1124;Steven's greatest work, the only film you can actually sense is striving towards art is obviously Schindler's List.
I:331;1125;How about 'A. i. Artificial Intelligence', a potentially deep exploration of what makes us human, a film that succeeds on many levels until the inevitable, sappy, Spielberg schmaltz takes over at the end?
I:331;1126;'Minority Report', another fascinating science.
I:331;1127;fiction film with a terrible, ribben bow, happy ending.
I:331;1128;'Catch Me If You Can' was fun breezy, entertainment.
I:331;1129;every time Spielberg makes a film, I still hope he might make something great.
I:331;1130;War of the Worlds is one of the most visceral, assaultive films to come out of Hollywood in years, how joyous it was for me to see it in the movie theater.
I:331;1131;The film only works on the perceptive level, scaring sensitive viewers in a post 9/11 world.
I:331;1132;I personally wanted the aliens to win, but that's another story.
I:331;1133;The people being incinerated, the floating bodies, humanity turning savage for the price of a working car, all this is great work.
I:331;1134;the acting by Cruise and Dakota Fanning is very good and John Williams' score is appropriately restrained, the special effects are quite realistic.
I:331;1135;This is a great story, so why is Spielberg recycling Jurassic Park's Velociraptors in the basement scene with Tim Robbins?
I:331;1136;I think it succeeds as a sci.
I:331;1137;It exists in that realm where many Spielberg films exist, it is good but could have been great if a braver director was at the wheel.
I:331;1138;Picture and sound are fine, special features are vast but superficial.
I:331;1139;I'm a huge music fan, so I especially like John Williams discussing his approach to the scoring of the film.
I:331;1140;movie fans everywhere hope for Spielberg to go beyond himself and actually make a great work of art.
I:331;1141;That's covered extremely well be others.
I:331;1142;To summarize, this is a fun, scary movie with some very tense moments.
I:331;1143;Will it ever make the best 100 movies ever made that has some lasting effect on society or how one lives one's life?
I:331;1144;After all, it IS a fun, scary movie with some tense moments.
I:331;1145;Sometimes, I just like to be entertained and this movie fits the bill.
I:331;1146;How can a director who is responsible for what is arguably the best war film (Saving Private Ryan) and one of the best Sci.
I:331;1147;A technically competent race who had visited Earth would probably be aware of the potential problems of terrestial micro.
I:331;1148;In this movie, Mr. Cruise's character was a real jerk.
I:331;1149;It's no wonder that the little girl has gotten rave reviews, she was the sympathetic figure and she did a good pretty good job of acting.6.
I:331;1150;That truly was a remarkable feat.8.
I:331;1151;There they all are together in a relatively unharmed section of town.
I:331;1152;The director and cast was top notch and I expected much more.
I:331;1153;He introduced us with friendly ones with both Close Encounters of the Third Kind and E. t.: The Extraterrestrial.
I:331;1154;But it becomes Ray's job to keep them alive when the aliens come down and start vaporizing everyone and everything.
I:331;1155;spielberg's War of the Worlds a good alien movie, but the illogical moments and the underwhleming finale keep this movie from being great.
I:331;1156;Of all of Spielberg's alien movies, this is easily the weakest one.
I:331;1157;"It's another vehicle for Tom ""Last Samurai"" Cruise to act like a hero in."
I:331;1158;some of them rising out of the earth .
I:331;1159;He does manage some truly stunning moments with the tripods, which are excellent displays of CGI.
I:331;1160;The script is plagued with a hair.
I:331;1161;in a movie with no logic and no good acting, the tripods are what are really striking.
I:331;1162;I thought War of the Worlds was a great movie, but despite what some thought about the movie, the plot isn't what it appears to be.
I:331;1163;i won't give too much away, but the movie is a must see in the theater.
I:331;1164;watch the movie, it's a must see.
I:331;1165;Excellent movie for anyone who likes and enjoys a movie about aliens.
I:331;1166;It is action packed and contains very good photography for a movie of this sort.
I:331;1167;talked about LFE (Low Frequency sound Effects) soundtrack, and also the cinematography was kind of cool.
I:331;1168;ness with a sepia tint and the eery clarity and overexposure of digital film.
I:331;1169;Well, the best thing I can say about this film is yes it's a great test for your home theater subwoofer, and I'm happy to report that mine delivered the goods well.
I:331;1170;year old Dakota Fanning, hilariously enough!
I:331;1171;"maybe because Fanning is the most competent and sympathetic actor in the whole movie, Spielberg reduces this film to ""can cute but hysterical/helpless little girl be saved from the evil Martians?"""
I:331;1172;ray I have ever seen.
I:331;1173;Try and find a better version.
I:331;1174;This film had some of the dumbest ideas ever put on film.
I:331;1175;And the son is able to see an entire army brigade destroyed and yet he survives?
I:331;1176;well,cant say much it was like someone wrote a book and turned it into a movie.
I:331;1177;The cinematography and FX are superb, the screen adaptation is desperately lacking.
I:331;1178;bought this for my husband as he absolutely loves this move.
I:331;1179;I have always liked the original Gene Barry, but this one ranks up there with it.
I:331;1180;All the Technical aspects are top notch, and the Special Effects are unbelievable.
I:331;1181;Heck, I thought that the Score was excellent.
I:331;1182;It had more of a 50's Monster Movie sound to it, which I thought was perfect.
I:331;1183;I've never been a follower, but I have watched and enjoyed a number of his films.
I:331;1184;And I'll grant him this: He works hard.
I:331;1185;I haven't seen all of his films, but in all the ones I have seen, it's quite evident that he's working hard to pull the project together.
I:331;1186;Contrary to what some may say though, he is very capable.
I:331;1187;In Jerry Maguire, Cruise is quite believable as a man who's gradually discovering that a conscience actually exists underneath the slick facade, and that he's personally capable of much more than that which his chosen field will allow.
I:331;1188;In addition, he was very good in his 'man on the run' role in the 15 minutes too long but otherwise excellent Minority Report, his first collaberation with Spielberg.
I:331;1189;he's perfectly fine in this movie.
I:331;1190;I've been a fan since E. t. and Jaws is my favorite movie (I've seen it countless times, and I'm looking into purchasing a Blue.
I:331;1191;Yes, there are a number of scenes at the beginning of the film that are designed to introduce the two little cretins, and, of course, there is the happy ending where the fractured family is made whole.
I:331;1192;style approach to the film.
I:331;1193;for me, the sequence in the town square in which a tripod comes up from below ground is the best part of the film.
I:331;1194;This makes the entire sequence that much more intense.
I:331;1195;This was far from being Tom Cruise's best acting.
I:331;1196;Tom Cruise was excellent and sweet as the husband who still carries a torch for his remarried and pregnant ex wife, ironically this part of the story was quite good, and then as the father who had to protect his kids from the impending doom of the alien invasion.
I:331;1197;"But I'm a big fan of the 1953 George Pal version of ""War of the Worlds,"" so I thought I'd give Spielberg's a shot."
I:331;1198;the music starts and it's oh.
I:331;1199;I like Morgan Freeman, I said aloud.
I:331;1200;the story takes no time to unfold, and it unfolds in a powerful way.
I:331;1201;More importantly, you immediately identify with the central characters because they have been molded so perfectly by Spielberg's direction.
I:331;1202;Cruise's performance is understated, believable, and not a distraction.
I:331;1203;the backbone of the movie is a story about a man who must redeem himself n the eyes of his children.
I:331;1204;Spend a weekend together with the kids, learn a few lessons about each other, and .
I:331;1205;blood red weeds, mind you .
I:331;1206;(This was Wells' cute explanation as to why Mars appears red in our sky).
I:331;1207;"By bonding with his children, he is destroying that ""alien."
I:331;1208;not a very widescreen for such an epic film.
I:331;1209;The sound mix is very good and if you have the luxury of viewing this film while the volume on your 5.1 sound receiver is turned up high, you will truly enjoy being immersed in the action.
I:331;1210;The movie just jumped right into the action, and for most movies, thats fine to do but for this one it wasn't.
I:331;1211;Ok we can live with that.
I:331;1212;all of a sudden Cruise's son gets brave and decides he wants to fight aliens.
I:331;1213;I love movies and I rarely think any movie is less than 3 stars but this one sure is.
I:331;1214;Spielberg, get it right next time!
I:331;1215;The trailer looked so promising that one logically assumed that the rest of the film would be just as good.
I:331;1216;And towards the end it shows the city of Boston demolished, and yet we never get to see it.
I:331;1217;This scene is worth the price of admission.
I:331;1218;I appreciate a good plot to go along with it.
I:331;1219;in terms of acting, no standout performances here.
I:331;1220;"if you must see a movie with a Cruise/Spielberg collaboration, watch ""Minority Report"" instead."
I:331;1221;While it has its flaws, it offers a much more compelling story.
I:331;1222;Overall, it's just a decent movie.
I:331;1223;In Orson Welles' 1938 radio broadcast version of the book, its concept of alien invaders sparked the most rampant form of hysteria America had seen up to that point.
I:331;1224;Now, in 2005, in post.9/11 America, director Steven Spielberg has put it back squarely in the public eye with incredible results.
I:331;1225;boomers from the 60s, and that this film shares with the 1953 original.
I:331;1226;cruise, whatever people may think of his Scientology beliefs, excels under Spielberg's sure.
I:331;1227;handed direction, as does Fanning.
I:331;1228;defining movies, continuing his pre.
I:331;1229;eminence among all Hollywood filmmakers as a master and a successor to legends like Hitchcock, Kubrick, and others.
I:331;1230;i have never read the original H. g. Wells story, so for all I know, this is a fairly faithful rendition of the novel.
I:331;1231;"i wasn't a huge fan of ""Independence Day,"" but the special effects alone made it worth seeing."
I:331;1232;Signs had very little in the way of effects, but it was much more suspenseful than this.
I:331;1233;"despite all of the above, ""War of the Worlds"" is not without some merits and is certainly worth seeing."
I:331;1234;I expected it to be as good as the first, maybe better.
I:331;1235;The scenes of the alien tripod creatures obliterating Americaare impressive, the scenes involving the refugees were equally intense.
I:331;1236;When the action picks up again, you know that Cruise will be the hero of the day until the microbes prove themselves bigger heroes of the day.
I:331;1237;if special effects turn you on, see this at the big screen.
I:331;1238;Before going to see this movie in the cinema, I was very excited.
I:331;1239;one good thing I can say about this movie is that the SFX were really superb and realistic.
I:331;1240;A real dissapointment from a top class director.
I:331;1241;When you take one of the most famous works of 19th century science fiction, turn it into a 21st century blockbuster film by hiring a famous actor and an even more famous director for the production, expectations are high.
I:331;1242;It doesn't matter if you think Cruise is the biggest jerk on the face of the planet, his work in this film is phenomenal.
I:331;1243;in 1938, a radio adaptation narrated by Orson Welles caused widespread panic on the American East Coast, and a 1953 movie adaptation kept the story in the public consciousness long after the author's death.
I:331;1244;"this latest film version takes advantage of the computer effects Spielberg himself pioneered with ""Jurassic Park"" and creates a far more realistic alien invasion than the now."
I:331;1245;spielberg is the master of making the experience of being scared somehow enjoyable.
I:331;1246;"of the two major motion picture adaptations, this ""War of the Worlds"" is actually more faithful to the original novel despite being set in 21st century America rather than 19th century England."
I:331;1247;For example, as in the book, the fear created by the alien invasion proves to be as dangerous as the aliens themselves.
I:331;1248;It is interesting to note that in this post 9/11.
I:331;1249;The tripods are cool, and when they attack New York, it's just astounding.
I:331;1250;There's a great scene where one of them rises from the Hudson River and overturns a ferry.
I:331;1251;Spielberg's War of the Worlds is another intense, edge.
I:331;1252;I would consider it the best alien invasion movie I have ever seen.
I:331;1253;Spielberg and screenwriter David Koepp bring a unique perspective to the alien invasion genre.
I:331;1254;This decision results in the film being more realistic and more believable, and I believe more successful, as a whole.
I:331;1255;War of the Worlds is always believable and it's very serious and very frightening.
I:331;1256;More importantly though, the characters are believable.
I:331;1257;That is the film's greatest attribute.
I:331;1258;The special effects are marvelous, but never excessive.
I:331;1259;The actors are excellent as well.
I:331;1260;Ultimately it's up to the actors to make the film believable.
I:331;1261;Despite the dark subject matter, this is obviously a Spielberg film.
I:331;1262;I was constantly aware of the master storyteller behind the camera.
I:331;1263;"Even in a ""popcorn"" movie like this, Spielberg brings his visual genius to the plate."
I:331;1264;He moves his camera like no one else, and his direction is consistently stunning.
I:331;1265;In a few scenes he even uses some of the hand.
I:331;1266;held photography that made Saving Private Ryan so realistic.
I:331;1267;It is a great, frightening, thoroughly believable alien invasion movie.
I:331;1268;H. g. Wells authored the classic sci.
I:331;1269;Now Steven Spielberg has produced a film about the War of The Worlds.
I:331;1270;The special effects really strike fear into the hearts of those watching this version of the story.
I:331;1271;As always Steven Spielberg directs some large scale scenes that takes the breath away and convey a sense of the threat facing mankind.
I:331;1272;There are some genuinely frightening moments in this film and personally I found the tripods of the aliens sent a shiver down the spine.
I:331;1273;The movie is great for anyone who likes scifi stuff.
I:331;1274;Try watching it with your gf.
I:331;1275;There's rubble all around them, but they are pristine.
I:331;1276;And the mother Miranda Otto was more memorable than the father's character, played by Cruise.
I:331;1277;The first thing I noticed about this film was that it steers very clear of the classic Aliens vs. Humanity romp with the screen.
I:331;1278;type imagery is spectacular, and it gives you a sense of hopelessness for humanity.
I:331;1279;another haunting and pleasing idea is how they left the origins of the aliens to the imagination.
I:331;1280;In Well's original story, the aliens most certainly come from Mars.
I:331;1281;Speilberg tells this story splendidly, and he creates so much by showing so little.
I:331;1282;It's good for an adaptaion.
I:331;1283;It's a classic tale brought into the modern world.
I:331;1284;I was particularly happy that they read the first chapter of the book in the opening of the movie, narrated by morgan freeman, and the bit at the end.
I:331;1285;thank god the movie ended.
I:331;1286;Two adaptations may carry that title: Jeff Waynes's musical version (and which remain the best adaptation ever) and.
I:331;1287;So, forget about Timothy Hines's big mess, watch Spielberg's film for a good enjoyment, and read the book (or hear the musical) if you are looking for accuracy.
I:331;1288;This movie is good and I would advise you too add this to your collection.
I:331;1289;That sums up Spielberg's re.
I:331;1290;The 1953 version had the best effects of that time and this version has the best effects of modern day cinema.
I:331;1291;Let's face it this is an alien invasion movie.
I:331;1292;So sit back and enjoy this flick.
I:331;1293;There are alot of surprises.
I:331;1294;O. k., everyone out there knows the tri.
I:331;1295;So without going into alot of details I will say this.
I:331;1296;The tension that is built around this movie is enthralling.
I:331;1297;Everyone involved does a great job.
I:331;1298;From start to finish I was riveted, on the edge of my seat and I cannot stop thinking of some of the most frightning moments of the film.
I:331;1299;This movie is truly awesome.
I:331;1300;The mayhem you do see is outstanding and scary.
I:331;1301;the best of our time.
I:331;1302;This is a helluva lot more brutal than I was expecting, but delighted to see that Spielberg did not pull any punches.
I:331;1303;The movie is a remarkable piece of Sci.
I:331;1304;The best Summer '05 movie, I predict.
I:331;1305;at the same time, Spielberg seems utterly incapable of producing a believable movie.
I:331;1306;According to this Spielberg movie, the first thing one wants to do when the aliens show up in town is to literally fight to get aboard a slow moving, brightly lit, ferry boat with absolutely no means of escape.
I:331;1307;This movie may indeed be these two individual's finest and best, but it is still far from good.
I:331;1308;The best thing about this movie is the stunning performance of Dakota Fanning, who put me in mind of Heather O'Rourke, Jodie Foster, and Drew Barrymore.
I:331;1309;But I did see it and the ending maybe farfetched, but the rest of the movie made up for it.
I:331;1310;survival monster movie, in which the aliens are monster who continually attack.
I:331;1311;This movie easily had my heart going throughout.
I:331;1312;There is very little music, which makes it very effective once heard.
I:331;1313;It becomes fun trying to see the references to his movie.
I:331;1314;See if you can find them all.
I:331;1315;The movie was so intense that it must have been tough to try to end it.
I:331;1316;i highly recommend it as a fun, scary, and heartpounding popcorn movie.
I:331;1317;Action, great effects, wow Best version by a long shot.
I:331;1318;i and my family were very pleased.
I:331;1319;*** This comment may contain spoilers ***I was truly impressed by the first hour of the movie.
I:331;1320;it was dark, gripping, and very scary .
I:331;1321;The bitter irony of the scene with the crushed plane and the reporters who are interested in the sensational story above everything were appropriate.
I:331;1322;The mass hysteria, the panic, the desire to survive no matter what were shown very believably in the scene where Ray (Tom Cruise) with the children in the car tried to get through the mad crowd .
I:331;1323;I think it was the highest moment of the movie .
I:331;1324;The arm of the dead creature in the final scene was much more impressive.
I:331;1325;As I watched War of the Worlds I recognized some of Steven Spielberg's style in it.
I:331;1326;No surprise of course, but he is so good at making movies.
I:331;1327;This is a movie experience!
I:331;1328;No, this movie stays with one family.
I:331;1329;It brings a vision of what it could be like, if the world was attacked by another world.
I:331;1330;And it does this in a manner that haunts and horrifies.
I:331;1331;war of the Worlds also pleases action fans and has a sense of humor.
I:331;1332;Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning display excellent acting throughout the movie.
I:331;1333;now that version is still bone chilling to hear, even to this day, its available free online and is really worth listening to.
I:331;1334;A brilliant transfer for a great movie.
I:331;1335;This is pure Spielberg entertainment at its best.
I:331;1336;He has managed to combine his passion for fantasy with his WWII works to produce a movie which really shows the fear and chaos of what would happen in the event of an alien invasion.
I:331;1337;There are plenty of movies about fighting back, trying to defeat them, being heroes (ie Independence Day) so to see it in the eyes of ordinary people trying to survive is a fresh look.
I:331;1338;I highly recommend seeing on a widescreen if you missed it at the theater.
I:331;1339;I didn't think that this 2005 version could reinvent something so boring, but it did, and very well too.
I:331;1340;The story line is pretty much the same, but it's just directed in another perspective.
I:331;1341;Instead, it's about a father who is trying to get his children to safety, but it's more interesting than it sounds.
I:331;1342;This is a remake of the original.
I:331;1343;First good space invaders movie in years.
I:331;1344;Its about timeSaw it and like it, although admittedly the first half was the best part.
I:331;1345;the thing I liked about the movie is that it is a rout from the very first instance the aliens arrive.
I:331;1346;Although to be far Independence Day was a good movie as well.
I:331;1347;I also liked that the movie relies strongly on the emotions of actors instead of just all the wiz bang special effects which are also there in plenty.
I:331;1348;I'm going to see this again because it was good.
I:331;1349;good movie go see it
I:331;1350;An excellent Movie, I especially liked the parts played by Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning, in some respects it reminded me of the Terminator Series Movies.
I:331;1351;Would recommend it to anyone.
I:331;1352;but it certainly cracks the top ten.
I:331;1353;The most astonishing thing about this movie is that Steven Spielberg would allow his name to be attached to this truly awful picture.
I:331;1354;All my life ive been a Steven Spielberg fan.
I:331;1355;"he has made countless classics in science fiction in drama &in
I:331;1356;a Academy Award winner man with so much imagination and vision he is considered one of the best directors ever.
I:331;1357;this film i have to mention is very well made film on a technical aspect.
I:331;1358;but one of gripes is really the Aliens.
I:331;1359;i mean yes this film has great special effects.
I:331;1360;good acting for the material.
I:331;1361;great idea to set up a story.
I:331;1362;he has written Carlitos Way,Jurassic Park and other good movies that i enjoyed that are written better then this.
I:331;1363;also this only the second production Josh Friedman has written.
I:331;1364;the music helps when needed.
I:331;1365;its good score by Williams like in every film he has composed.
I:331;1366;the acting is good for the material.
I:331;1367;dakota Fanning shows that she a talent for the future and Tom Cruise is one of the ultimate stars there is.
I:331;1368;at least Spielberg will go back to winning ways in a artistic way making one of the most promising movies of 2005 Munich.
I:331;1369;so let's just hope and wait for him to bring us the goods again.
I:331;1370;For me, certain movies when viewed the first time, give me one impression,then when viewed again give me another.
I:331;1371;The second time, I saw more, and enjoyed it more.
I:331;1372;There is some parts of Tom Cruise's personal life that I don't care for, but as an actor, he is one of the best.
I:331;1373;Spielberg was really on his game.
I:331;1374;it's fun too, watching the original film from the fifties.
I:331;1375;This is Hollywood bigtime, super, state of the art.
I:331;1376;Top actors, effects, a simple story line.
I:331;1377;The kids will get it, the adults will find the subtlties intriguing, especially in this time of post.
I:331;1378;so yeah, watch it with family and friends.
I:331;1379;Thanks for a great Christmas present for another nephew.
I:331;1380;This Spielberg film sticks somewhat with the original book, but takes extravagant license with most of the storyline.
I:331;1381;Not the best work of any concerned!
I:331;1382;Good movie with excelent set pieces like the initial attack, the destruction of the bridge (wow !)
I:331;1383;and the compromised happy ending.
I:331;1384;star reviews, and they did a good job telling everything I was about to say.
I:331;1385;I'll still carp a bit .
I:331;1386;I never thought Spielberg anything special, but here he outdid himself.
I:331;1387;just go and read the bad reviews here, they're good.
I:331;1388;I read on Wikipedia that this film was a huge commercial success.
I:331;1389;The little girl is the most detailed character here, and she's memorable.
I:331;1390;"fi/horror movie Aliens could scare me and both Cruise and Spielberg did an amazing job
I:331;1391;the giant machines and the huge sound they make when they appear near people is one of the most brilliant ideas about the scariest part of the story.
I:331;1392;Also worth mentioning, this .
I:331;1393;Surely not one of those movies you appreciate the first time you see it, unless you're a detailed minded type of person, and definitely not for those with ADD who get bored easily because they lack the patience to study every single detail about the story or the special effects.
I:331;1394;"they have this flick on constant rotation on HBO and I find myself watching it every single time I come across it, maybe driving my wife nuts at times, but I think it's worth it
I:331;1395;well despite all the barrowing it is good fx.
I:331;1396;tom Cruise (the saving grace of the movie),Is a City Contractor.
I:331;1397;from here the action starts.
I:331;1398;first a freek lighting storm then the earth splits and out pops the alien ships.
I:331;1399;Good Action movie, lot's of suspense.
I:331;1400;Fanning shows what a great actress she is.
I:331;1401;Steven Spielburg did a great job on this movie just like he did on the movie saving private ryan.
I:331;1402;I found it hard to keep up with Cruz,in a believable way.
I:331;1403;In a film that is set up so well and has really great suspense, it is hard to put it down.
I:331;1404;Tom Cruise carries the film well.
I:331;1405;Now what I did like is the how great the suspense was.
I:331;1406;You take any disastor movie and this one outdoes it by a long shot on keeping you on the edge of your seat.
I:331;1407;So at the end of the day, I have to give the film a positive review despite some flaws I found major.
I:331;1408;hero becoming a hero in his role as the downtrodden father.
I:331;1409;The Cruise character seems to constantly evaluate events, regain his control and move on.
I:331;1410;He gains strength from his struggle and the weakness of the Robbins character.
I:331;1411;Spielberg and company do an outstanding job here.
I:331;1412;In all, this film is good.
I:331;1413;this is certainly the best movie of stefen spielberg not 'one of the best' but 'the best' .
I:331;1414;dakotta fanning is simply great you can't simply under estimate this childs talent incase if you have any doubt see 'hide and seek' and at the climax which is bit confusing they are telling a reason.
I:331;1415;but who cares this movie has got everything you wanted to be in it and it rocks.
I:331;1416;I really enjoyed this movie.
I:331;1417;It had amazing special effects and it was very compelling.
I:331;1418;I am a big fan of the orginal War of the Worlds, but thought I would give this one a chance.
I:331;1419;when this movie came out I thought it might be ok, well I was WRONG.
I:331;1420;possibly influenced by independance day as well.
I:331;1421;steven Spielberg once again proves he can outdo most anyone with costly productions.
I:331;1422;The Spielberg family drama recipe is set.
I:331;1423;Rachel repeatedly asks, driving home the underlying tone of Spielberg's intention of making the story relevant to our time).
I:331;1424;What happens between New Jersey and Boston is a battle to end all battles during which time Ray discovers the importance of his fatherhood, the love of his children, and his own humbling recognition that he is but one member of the planet earth.
I:331;1425;the stars of the film are the extraordinary tripod machines, though Cruise and Fanning hold their own.
I:331;1426;"I've always wanted to be a writer, and even though I was never good enough to be one, every book that I ever read on the subject basically said one thing: Never let some miracle ""bail out"" the main character!"
I:331;1427;But my friends watching the movie assured me the story had been wrapped up.
I:331;1428;it sucks!If you want a really good alian story, read The Great Time.
I:331;1429;It quite possibly is one of the best sci fi movies ever, the audience I saw it with thought the same and gave the movie a standing ovation.
I:331;1430;"it's based on the H. g. wells classic originally brought to life in the 1950's by acclaimed sci fi director George Pal who brought us such hits as ""The Time Machine""."
I:331;1431;"The people at Industrial Light and Magic which worked on such hits as ""Jurassic Park"", ""Willow"" and ""Terminator 2 Judgement Day"" should really be commended for bringing more top notch and award worthy special effecfs to the screen once agein!!!"
I:331;1432;"Spielberg like other good directors knows how to input the human element and heart just like he's done in other Blockbusters like ""ET"" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind""."
I:331;1433;"in fact this felt a lot like ""Close"": for many times, When the strange alien ships emerge, there is a great deal of human curiousity and intrigue around them, then when we see the Aliens true intentions we are in disbelief as to the amount of destruction that can be inflicted by one ship."
I:331;1434;Tom Cruise was great in this, like him or not.
I:331;1435;"as Ray Ferrier, Cruise for his time is able to capture the average working man once again, something he started in movies like ""All the Right moves""."
I:331;1436;This girl is only 11 eleven years old ladies and gentleman, but in her short beginnings she has shown us the talents and skillsof a veteran.
I:331;1437;She was utterly priceless and lovable as Rachel Ferrier.
I:331;1438;in a time when former child actors go by the waste side and do nothing, Fanning has emerged as much more than just a kid with a pretty face, she can act with the best of them and she likewise needs to commended for her work.
I:331;1439;justin Chatwin as Robbie Ferrier is another memorable character.
I:331;1440;You gotta love it how Spielberg, his writers like true master know how to put in the humanity into films like these while at the same delivering us with the big budge special effects we expect to see when we go to the theater, He gives us everything we asked for and then some.
I:331;1441;nicely done, Steven, once again, you've given us a classic memorable flick that not only we can enjoy as adults and remember it by but also a great flick that we can take our kids too and as a family we can be entertained once again by your greatness.
I:331;1442;WAR OF THE WORLDS then will no doubt be remembered for another masterpiece by Spielberg and everyone involved in the production, making and release of the film should beEXTREMELY proud of themselves.
I:331;1443;This review is a piece of cake.
I:331;1444;'War of the Worlds' had to be the title of this review because my wife hates, absolutely deplores Tom Cruise!
I:331;1445;(By the way, that's the idea!}
I:331;1446;The latest adaptation of H. g. Wells' 1898 novel remains faithful to the original story .
I:331;1447;opening with the familiar explanation about man's complacency (in a voice.
I:331;1448;Though the story is similar in plot development to Independence Day, it is without the latter's humour, wit or even optimism.
I:331;1449;director Steven Spielberg has tried to create the ultimate invasion film.
I:331;1450;The special effects are stunning, and the scenes of mass hysteria and refugees with nowhere to go are truly tragic.
I:331;1451;racing from start to finish, and the horrifying (often gruesome) imagery will linger in your mind.
I:331;1452;The special effects are very good, and thats the only good thing I can say about this movie.
I:331;1453;secondly, the story and special effects were perfectly balanced.
I:331;1454;this movie was well done, entertaining, and did great justice to the original story.
I:331;1455;Not to mention the very believable (yet rarely seen in most movies) special effects, and chilling score by John Williams.
I:331;1456;Good concept with a great director.
I:331;1457;Another adaptation of H. g. Wells timeless book `War of the Worlds' has come to the big screen, so it's only natural that a big time American director and Americans movie star take a classic British book and set it modern day New Jersey.
I:331;1458;tom Cruise's trademark toothy grin is notably absent.
I:331;1459;It is a pretty good movie although not a great one.
I:331;1460;This bothers me in this day and age that this is the best we can get from these movie companies.
I:331;1461;Overall it is still a good movie to watch every now and then.
I:331;1462;Leave it to Spielberg to bring a story to life.
I:331;1463;Everything from the dialogue to the electric snakes is as real as the background on Pandora.
I:331;1464;This movie is a definate winner.
I:331;1465;Spielberg did a great job with this movie!
I:331;1466;Spielberg has a gift, and took it to the max to make this movie.
I:331;1467;Tom curse did a pretty good job acting in this movie.
I:331;1468;But above that it's great.
I:331;1469;I love all of this movie.
I:331;1470;It's great speicial affects made the movie even better!Over all I'd give this a two thumps up!
I:331;1471;Fine rendition of the classic H. g. Wells story with Tom Cruise in a surprisingly effective and sensitive performance as a divorced man running with his estranged children from invading aliens.
I:331;1472;fi nostalgia and a modern movie appearance.
I:331;1473;"it ends a bit suddenly with an, ""and then they were gone"" resolution, but it's an intense adventure on the way to victory, helped enormously by the talents of Cruise and Justin Chatwin and Dakota Fanning as his children."
I:331;1474;Spielberg displays his magician's handle on doom mongering disaster and freedom.
I:331;1475;Like the Lucas prequels, the effects are absolutely stunning and great to look at.
I:331;1476;It's easy to enjoy the aliens and the rampant destruction, including a mini.
I:331;1477;i'm certain I would have enjoyed it more if the story had held together.
I:331;1478;the acting is pretty good.
I:331;1479;the special effects are awesome.
I:331;1480;"winning director Steven Spielberg (""Schindler's List,"" ""Saving Private Ryan,"" etc) teams up with action star Tom Cruise (""Top Gun,"" ""MI:2,"" etc) to make ""War Of The Worlds"" based on the classic sci."
I:331;1481;"man"") is also on board, as is."
I:331;1482;Having seen several of Steven and Tom's films, both when they worked apart and together, I decided to give Steven and Tom the benefit of the doubt.
I:331;1483;"winner Morgan Freeman (""Million Dollar Baby"")as the narrator."
I:331;1484;As usual, Tom gave a great performance.
I:331;1485;Okay, I give it three stars for the special effects alone.
I:331;1486;"Very good
I:331;1487;Makes Star Trek's transporters look very realistic in comparison.
I:331;1488;One of the best classic science fiction movies ever made.
I:331;1489;Watch the new one for the special effects, but watch the 50s version for a better plot.
I:331;1490;This is one friggin awsome film.
I:331;1491;Leave it at that an call it a day.
I:331;1492;Regardless of the impressive special effects, this movie is REALLY bad.
I:331;1493;The entire movie is full of this type of WTFs.
I:331;1494;The special effects are great, the movie is not.
I:331;1495;The good guys won because they were photogenic.
I:331;1496;Any version of this film is going to be good.
I:331;1497;The beginning of the movie was excellent .
I:331;1498;it was suspenseful and the special effects were terrific.
I:331;1499;Ray Ferrier works as a crane operator on the New Jersey docks, and lives nearby.
I:331;1500;He sees them during weekend visitations.
I:331;1501;In this film, Ray's epiphany came in the form of becoming the man and father he never was while he was married to his children's mother.
I:331;1502;cANDY BUT LESS THAN AN EPIC CLASSICTerrific effects, excellent story, but alas, the pacing was just to out.
I:331;1503;world fast to allow me time to give a darn about the outcome and what it was I was seeing.
I:331;1504;Giving the viewpoint of the film to an everyman divorced father with kids, and a mission, was a novel way to play out this material and it was at times quite excellent.
I:331;1505;candy it weighed in as somewhat short of an epic classic.
I:331;1506;This is with out a doubt the best movie of the year.
I:331;1507;The special effects were the best I have seen in years.
I:331;1508;Cruise and Spielberg have collaberated before with Minority Report and this will be the best movie they have been together for ever.
I:331;1509;Dakota Fanning, who is always good, put this movie together with her excellent acting as Cruise's daughter.
I:331;1510;This movie will be a blockbuster hit for another 10 years.
I:331;1511;A very good but not great movie that sci.
I:331;1512;spielberg's War of the Worlds is another intense, edge.
I:331;1513;I would consider it the best alien invasion movie I have ever seen.
I:331;1514;Spielberg and screenwriter David Koepp bring a unique perspective to the alien invasion genre.
I:331;1515;This decision results in the film being more realistic and more believable, and I believe more successful, as a whole.
I:331;1516;I liked the movie very much.
I:331;1517;The effects and story line are well put together.
I:331;1518;There is also a good since of realism involved here.
I:331;1519;Tom is a great actor and has delivered every time in every movie he has been in.
I:331;1520;"I like his ability to make his character believable
I:331;1521;First, Spielberg was pretty faithful to the book's storyline.
I:331;1522;The movie itself is pretty good, although I think it could have been cut down by 20 minutes.
I:331;1523;"Say what you want about Cruise's personal life
I:331;1524;"Dakota Fanning is the best new actress around, turning in a performance that is as good as her performance in last year's ""Man on Fire."""
I:331;1525;And she's got a set of lungs that won't quit!
I:331;1526;FX was outstanding, as to be expected.
I:331;1527;watching the movie I thought the tripods were a rip.
I:331;1528;Overall, excellent movie for adults.
I:331;1529;I recommend you do the same.
I:331;1530;If you like Tom Cruise as an actor, Steven Speilberg as a director, and a movie with alot of action, special effects, and a little suspense to boot, you'll love this movie.
I:331;1531;Go see it and have fun!!!
I:331;1532;The story could have been update more and be more compelling.
I:331;1533;At first glance, a sci.
I:331;1534;I had seen all the previous versions of this classic tale.
I:331;1535;This was an incredible piece of dark cinema painting a reality that all lingers in the back of one's mind.
I:331;1536;Which motivated me to see it again.
I:331;1537;Thanks for bringing the kids!
I:331;1538;Spielberg is a whimp, see the ending.
I:331;1539;He narrates the beginning and the end.
I:331;1540;If there's one thing War of the Worlds does well, its that it shows how one small family copes during a time of great disaster.
I:331;1541;They want to conquer earth, and they'll do anything to do so.
I:331;1542;"spielberg has truely captured the essence of ""End of the world""."
I:331;1543;And this approach works very well.
I:331;1544;The carnage they can inflict is incredible.
I:331;1545;All with flawless special effects.
I:331;1546;Even the aliens themselves look incredible.
I:331;1547;but in the end, War of the Worlds is a great summer movie that's smart and thrilling.
I:331;1548;I thought going through a realistic view of the attack, through one family, and a post.911 feel was very entertaining.
I:331;1549;Steven Spielberg is one of my favorites, and I usually complain that I don't like it when people take a movie and make it real.
I:331;1550;life style, but there's so many Sci.
I:331;1551;fi entertaining blockbuster fun to watch version of War of the Worlds already out there, that I think this one needed to be made.
I:331;1552;My point is, it was very well done and worth the watch, and I absolutely love the twist ending!
I:331;1553;do it, so it's fun.
I:331;1554;line is good and fairly fast.
I:331;1555;The performances are really good by A. list actors, but for some reason this just didn't add up to an A. list film.
I:331;1556;Quite disgusting, but that's a good thing in an alien film.
I:331;1557;There are some really clever scenes, such as when the alien is searching every last inch of the basement in which Tom, Dakota and Tim Robbins are hiding.
I:331;1558;For the most part, the pacing does keep you on the edge of your seat, so I would recommend this movie.
I:331;1559;She is calm, centered, much wiser than her old dad and perfectly willing to tell him how to live his life.
I:331;1560;Now let's talk about the good stuff in this movie: the special FX.
I:331;1561;Here're the gems:The scenes in the city during the aliens' first attack are amazing and almost terrifying.
I:331;1562;wife's house makes for a surreal moment.
I:331;1563;Hoping some day a true widescreen Blu.
I:331;1564;ray of this great movie will be released.
I:331;1565;Sure the special effects are stunning and large scale.
I:331;1566;The main character gets lucky and manages to escape the deadly rays of the Martian tripod machines while everyone around him gets vaporized.
I:331;1567;War of the Worlds lacked plot logic, but it was very entertaining nevertheless.
I:331;1568;The special effects were great and the acting was believable.
I:331;1569;I actually felt for the characters, which is always a good thing.
I:331;1570;one good moral out of this film: occupation never wins.
I:331;1571;This movie tells how a man, a blue color worker, who is divorced from his wife, who remarried, tries to save himself and his two children.
I:331;1572;We watch to see if the man's efforts will help bring back his son's respect and love.
I:331;1573;See my review of the novel and the 1953 G movie.
I:331;1574;Keeping in mind the thing that ultimetely kills those aliens,the underliying message of the film is that it is fighting that destroys life while it is nature that sustains it.
I:331;1575;It is interesting that the post.9/11 Hollywood created the environmentally conscious The Day After Tomorrow last year.
I:331;1576;the best version of this classic story to date .
I:331;1577;what i liked most about it was the atmosphere portryaed in it .
I:331;1578;this is a classic, true to heart alien invasion .
I:331;1579;It creates a genuine feel of terror with running away from giant alien tripods that are turning people in ash and basically popping them.
I:331;1580;"this gives the invasion a more ""closer to home"" sensation and it makes the invasion seems much more invasive."
I:331;1581;it was indeed much easier to make a hovering alien craft than it was to make a fully animated alien tripod.
I:331;1582;the people getting turned into ash by the alien beams is often very clear, and very realistic.
I:331;1583;all in all, this is an AWESOME depiction of Wells' story, with a few little changes here and there, but for the most part it holds to Wells' original imaginings to a remarkably close degree.
I:331;1584;they breathe our air, drink our water, etc. etc. .
I:331;1585;Having listened to a recording of the Orson Wells radio play as a teenager and enjoyed the 1953 movie version, I wasn't expecting anything other than another tired remake.
I:331;1586;War of the Worlds represents a culmination of Spielberg's evolution as a director.
I:331;1587;"I also feared what I'll term the Will Smith / Independence Day factor
I:331;1588;yet this added to the film, rather than detracted.
I:331;1589;the action and suspense are non.
I:331;1590;yet Spielberg adds a touch of good old fashioned quiet tension and suspense that would make Hitchcock proud.
I:331;1591;Dakota Fanning once again has me in utter awe of her acting abilities, turning in a believable performance under the most surreal of circumstances.
I:331;1592;Mr. Cruise has gotten away with movie star roles that play up his charisma and personality.
I:331;1593;Some of his best acting in this movie transpired when he wasn't saying any lines!
I:331;1594;He encapsulated fear, paralysis, fatherly affection, confusion, doubt and a whirlwind of other emotions by the physicality of his performance.
I:331;1595;Justin Chatwin also turned in a fine performance in the role of Ray's alternately teen.
I:331;1596;Teenagers are so rarely played this true to form.
I:331;1597;the family aspects of War of the Worlds were in the right proportions to the alien invasion aspects.
I:331;1598;without giving any thing away, I will tell you that the most powerful aspect of this movie occurs in Act Two of the old radio play (completely absent from the 1953 film).
I:331;1599;This introduces Tim Robbins into the mix in a haunting performance.
I:331;1600;This movie introduces so many images and scenes of wide diversity, that I defy any movie.
I:331;1601;Think Jurassic Park and Aliens .
I:331;1602;energy transfer could easily camouflage their technology from us, using shields, etc.
I:331;1603;This also implies that the aliens may have predated man as earth dwellers.
I:331;1604;Stephen King's Tommyknockers are a hundred times better than this film.
I:331;1605;Humanity is absolutely protected by nature.
I:331;1606;Remember our beautiful nuclear power stations that melt down into a nice atomic BBQ, and we are the hamburgers.
I:331;1607;One of the most anticipated movies of the year War of the worlds is a great movie but I thought it could of been better.
I:331;1608;I got passes all the bad things and found the ovie great.
I:331;1609;the story is good, the acting was good I thought Dakota Fanning great, the special effects where great and the direction.
I:331;1610;Overall it's one of the best films of the year and should not dispaoint you.
I:331;1611;it was actually very good and I was quite scared watching it (something that doesn't hit me all that often).
I:331;1612;Tom played his part well.
I:331;1613;His acting role was very believable as the frightened father.
I:331;1614;this movie rocks all movies, Tom Cruse, plays his best role ever, and i am not a Tom Cruse fan.
I:331;1615;this is now my favorite movie of all time.
I:331;1616;"awful ""love conquers all"" ending."
I:331;1617;I think the main thing that most dont realize is that this movie strikes a nerve and its causing it to recieve a love/hate reaction among most who have seen it for the first time.
I:331;1618;I think with repeated viewings the truth will begin to shine through.
I:331;1619;this movie is scary and invades your space in a way that few films have before.
I:331;1620;I was actually upset for a while afterwards, but got over it soon enough to realize that it was JUST A MOVIE!I love film and the way it can transport you to another place and time.
I:331;1621;Thats the magic of good film.
I:331;1622;Although perhaps we should expect more from Steven Spielberg, War of the Worlds functions well as a summer blockbuster and is certainly worth the price of admission.
I:331;1623;By viewing the film through the lens of the former, a palpable sense of confusion is always present.
I:331;1624;As to the latter, the darker side of human nature, it is here that the movie makes its mark.
I:331;1625;Scenes of a mob fighting over a bruised minivan are brilliant, as are the scenes when desperate people scramble to get onto a loaded ferry.
I:331;1626;on a technical scale, this movie ranks quite high, and certainly near the level we have come to expect from a summer blockbuster.
I:331;1627;The sound is also very good, from a solid score from John Williams to the wonderful noises the tripods make.
I:331;1628;The acting was also solid, and Spielburg's direction very satisfactory.
I:331;1629;based, especially when it comes to the film's conclusion.
I:331;1630;though the conclusion is normally one of the most important parts of a film and this one's ending left a severely bad taste in my mouth, the good parts of the film outweigh the bad and a good rating is deserved.
I:331;1631;Produced by George Pal with unforgettable Academy Award winning special effects.
I:331;1632;"this 1953 film version is still the best version of all ""War of the Worlds"" films."
I:331;1633;The radio broadcast is also available from Amazon.
I:331;1634;It is considered to be the first authentic movie adaptation from the H. g. Wells' novel of 1898.
I:331;1635;The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time.
I:331;1636;This is a very tense movie with Cruise and Fanning playing fantastic roles.
I:331;1637;The graphics and special effects in this movie are phenominal, and are possibly better than I have ever seen.
I:331;1638;Overall this is a great movie that deserves to be on any movie collectors shelf.
I:331;1639;This version of the War of the Worlds brings some new twists to the storyline.
I:331;1640;It's a good movie with good effects and decent acting.
I:331;1641;I'll address some specific issues with the movie as the format for my review.
I:331;1642;still a good popcorn movie.
I:331;1643;The ending is exactly the same as the original film.
I:331;1644;You gotta figure that an alien intelligence that can master interstellar travel.
I:331;1645;"is smart enough to know about the very thing that ""is thier undoing"" in this film."
I:331;1646;Good job by Tom Cruise as always.
I:331;1647;dakota Fanning gives a stunning performance as the daughter .
I:331;1648;Tom Robbins also puts in a brilliant performance as the mad Ogilvy, I love his acting and although his part is small he makes a big impression.
I:331;1649;I still give it four stars though .
I:331;1650;It should be late 19th century with us fighting the invaders with steam battleships and artillery and focusing more on the way humanity unravels.
I:331;1651;Of course Tom's acting makes for an interesting movie as he plays, well, himself.
I:331;1652;As I suspected the movie was thrilling from the first moment to the conclusion.
I:331;1653;It was entertaining and seeing Tim Robbins play a total psycho whose well off the mental map was the linchpin for me.
I:331;1654;The movie attempts to bring to life the classic novel by H. G. Wells and in many ways succeeds.
I:331;1655;In conclusion, the original had direction, the new version is hampered with family ties.
I:331;1656;The man obviously has a gift for big Hollwood movies, and that trend continues here.
I:331;1657;One of my favorite big Hollywood movies was 'Independence Day' (i know, my credibility is totally shot now) and I found myself constantly comparing the two movies.
I:331;1658;i am not a huge Tom Cruise fan, but he is fine here.
I:331;1659;I will admit some of his movies are a guilty pleasure (Cocktail, Top Gun, Few Good Men.)
I:331;1660;now, the true stars of the film.
I:331;1661;the special effects, wow, they are spectacular.
I:331;1662;You talk about intense, bright, loud, scary.
I:331;1663;just expertly crafted, Spielberg always delivers the goods when it comes to special effects and this just continues his amazing achievements.
I:331;1664;"pods, um, ""process"" the humans."
I:331;1665;why does it always have to be an on.
I:331;1666;But it picks up well after that and leads to a pretty cool conclusion that was not over.
I:331;1667;setting, the creatures that prowl just inches from our protagonists, the wild crowd effects as alien tripods zap pedestrians into dust, etc and company.
I:331;1668;The acting is decent .
I:331;1669;the end sucks, as everyone has pointed out .
I:331;1670;Let's do something meaningful with that day for a change!Enough of the rant.
I:331;1671;beat and has at least a few surprises.
I:331;1672;as soon as the opening credits rolled up I was ready for a wild ride after seeing the excellent Batman Begins.
I:331;1673;The movie is very dark and powerful at some parts.
I:331;1674;I even felt for these characters because it felt real.
I:331;1675;There were also some homages to the original.
I:331;1676;Those were al fantastic homages and should be seen to those who seen the original.
I:331;1677;overall, this movie is a fantasic and exciting adventure.
I:331;1678;It has heart, a sense of humour and (if you like this sort of thing) a lot of voilence.
I:331;1679;Highly recommended for those who seen the original.
I:331;1680;Spielberg and his FX group have outdone themselves.
I:331;1681;just sit back and enjoy.
I:331;1682;In spite of some incredible special.
I:331;1683;if you look back at the great sci.
I:331;1684;"fi or horror flicks, and even Orson Welles' great radio version of ""War of the Worlds,"" it is ultimately a story about people."
I:331;1685;"Star Wars, ""Star Trek,"" ""King Kong,"" to name a few, are ultimately about the people in them."
I:331;1686;spielberg's greatest strength, in the past, has been as a master storyteller.
I:331;1687;"or the halocaust in ""Schindler's List,"" Spielberg has helped create memorable characters and it was ultimately about them that you cared."
I:331;1688;There is noone really of note here, perhaps except for Dakota Fanning.
I:331;1689;spielberg has turned his back on everything that made him a great filmmaker.
I:331;1690;Still, he remained a good storyteller.
I:331;1691;get an eyeful of the special effects in the first 20 minutes or so, then stop the player and spend the rest of your evening watching something good.
I:331;1692;This movie is definitely a must see!!
I:331;1693;The special effects are awesome, an Oscar awaits you.
I:331;1694;The plot is very well written, and you experience a lot of differnt emotions with this film.
I:331;1695;I am still talking about it and plan to see it again.
I:331;1696;It was well worth the $8.75 and I'm looking forward to seeing it again.
I:331;1697;I love the original WOTW movie, as most people.
I:331;1698;i feel this one, didn't develop and add to the old movie, the book or even the radio series, there was a huge potential to do something very cool with modern day scenario.
I:331;1699;but I love slam, bam, action movies like the rest of us and there is some cool action requences, my favourite being the boat sequence.
I:331;1700;the Aliens also SOUND way cool and creepy, which was fresh.
I:331;1701;the story line was under developed as well as the characters.
I:331;1702;given the great old 1953 version was such a classic, and this one is such a bomb, perhaps there is still room for a good remake.
I:331;1703;"The first half of ""The War of the Worlds"" was astounding."
I:331;1704;Great family story, incredible CGI work, terrific premise about Martian invaders preparing the Earth or millennia before pulling the trigger.
I:331;1705;v. nYC visual gags, very funny here in the post.
I:331;1706;The kids limited Cruise's optin in ways that were believable and sympathetic.
I:331;1707;i have to give Spielberg credit for using an unusual approach to a film about alien invaders.
I:331;1708;If Spielberg had had one of the alien ships spit out little Sojourner, NASA's Mars rover, it would have been both funny, frightening and signaled that Spilberg respected our intelligence.
I:331;1709;wOTW could have been a terrific summer movie.
I:331;1710;Its strong start and more than a few incredible ideas and visuals indicate what could have been.
I:331;1711;These days, amazing and realistic special effects are the price of entry for any film that wants to be taken seriously in the U. s. marketplace.
I:331;1712;And Spielberg, one of the inspirational creators of the modern standard in special effects, delivers visually without missing a beat.
I:331;1713;This was a good remake film, but to be honest, it was just okay.
I:331;1714;It's fine to have your opinion, but he's using his celebraty status to use as a billboard for his political views and it's staining his image.
I:331;1715;I liked him more when he was quiet and smiled that gorgeous melt me smile.
I:331;1716;There's a morbidly funny scene where the gates at a railroad crossing block the refugees to allow a flaming train, presumably used for target practice by the aliens, to rocket by.
I:331;1717;and nobody blinks upon seeing it.
I:331;1718;The kids did the best they could with their parts, but I really wanted the aliens to kill them after a while.
I:331;1719;I tried to view this movie with an open mind and had great hopes for it when it began.
I:331;1720;"This movie is so gritty and real, it's far from mere ""remake"" territory."
I:331;1721;This movie will give you sweaty palms and jumpy nerves.
I:331;1722;Yes, the movie is great looking.
I:331;1723;Yes, the movie offers a fresh look at the old and familiar story.
I:331;1724;curricular publicity not withstanding, does a good job in this role.
I:331;1725;His troubled father role is compelling.
I:331;1726;Dakota Fanning does well in her usual over.
I:331;1727;It was a perfect tidbit to throw into the movie.
I:331;1728;This is a good movie that, even though I thought it was a little redundant, doesn't fail to impress.
I:331;1729;What will become of the earth?From Orson Wells' radio broadcast during the Great Depression to the original War of the Worlds film in the 1950s to this new version, people have been fascinated with H. g. Wells' science fiction story.
I:331;1730;This movie is very good and does a good job of depicting the events of Wells' story.
I:331;1731;i'm a big science fiction fan, and I highly recommend this movie.
I:331;1732;The special effects are very good, and the story unfolds at an exciting pace.
I:331;1733;Tom Cruise gives one of the best performances of his career as Ray.
I:331;1734;I loved some scenes to death, the ominous death train passing by at a phenomenal speed, where all cabins are erupted with hellfire.
I:331;1735;"I loved the ominous screems from the aliens
I:331;1736;Very dissapointing film except for the special effects.
I:331;1737;I was really surprised about the part of Tom Cruise.
I:331;1738;The special effects are also really good and the story is also a really good story (but this is not because of Steven Spielberg, of course).
I:331;1739;I was really looking forward to this movie because the original story is a favorite of mine.
I:331;1740;touch father a little too well.
I:331;1741;The special effects are outstanding the scenes of the tripods ascending from the streets and rocking the city was amazing.
I:331;1742;"There are also some classic lines, e. g., ""."
I:331;1743;if it is true that the first and last half.
I:331;1744;in short, the special effects carry the movie.
I:331;1745;Except for spending too much time in a basement during the second half, the movie's action sequences are great!
I:331;1746;Would I recommend it maybe but that would be up to you.
I:331;1747;i loved the twists and turns and the ending was epic.
I:331;1748;One of my favorite scenes involving a plane crash is skipped entirely.
I:331;1749;The storyline is great, based on a very old novel by H. g wells.
I:331;1750;Well I didnt enjoy the book that much, but the film is really great.
I:331;1751;You need to see this film on a widescreen (cinema screen is ideal).
I:331;1752;thats about it.You will enjoy this film if you enjoyed films such as THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW or INDEPENDENCE DAY.
I:331;1753;overall, i think its really good.
I:331;1754;OK, if cute little Dakota Fanning screams one more time, I'm going to root for the monsters!War of the Worlds is a good movie.
I:331;1755;I liked it better than Batman, and equal to Star Wars (the 2005 incarnations).
I:331;1756;the plot is well known.
I:331;1757;wife?The special effects are outstanding.
I:331;1758;Especially good are the scenes of the tripods ascending from the streets and rocking the city.
I:331;1759;"There are also some classic lines, e. g., ""."
I:331;1760;if it is true that the first and last half.
I:331;1761;in short, the special effects carry the movie.
I:331;1762;Except for spending too much time in a basement during the second half, the movie's action sequences are great!
I:331;1763;I had very high expectations for this movie.
I:331;1764;I loved the book by H. G. Wells, and I had listened to the radio drama by Orson Welles and very much enjoyed it.
I:331;1765;War Of The Worlds is a reimagining of a classic novel and film, modernized with incredible special effects, cinematography, sound, and big screen actors.
I:331;1766;Adding up to make one of the most intense experiences in blockbuster movies as of late.
I:331;1767;But there is much more to this movie than the special effects, and Tom Cruise's reputation.
I:331;1768;Moments where this subtle post.9/11 disposition hit home are scattered throughout the movie, making for a very interesting and relevant moviegoing experience.
I:331;1769;Even in the first twenty minutes before the attacks begin, a normal day in the city is washed out with bright white light.
I:331;1770;the movie also makes great use of long.
I:331;1771;take sequences and shots lifted right out of the opening sequence of A Touch Of Evil, Orson Welles would be proud.
I:331;1772;the writers have done a great job as well, creating human characters that we all could relate to in times like these.
I:331;1773;The story has enough subtlety in it's exposition, as well as humanity in it's characters, to keep it interesting.
I:331;1774;even if you just want to watch something entertaining, this is by far the most entertaining and moving movie to come out in summer 2005 season.
I:331;1775;And if you are looking for food for thought, this one has enough implicit meanings and views to keep you interested for a good while.
I:331;1776;War Of The Worlds successfully combines two things that were thought to be light years apart in Hollywood Cinema today, sheer blockbuster entertainment and deep meaning and relevance.
I:331;1777;They slammed together the action of ID4, the characters of THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW and the simple basement suspense of SIGNS.
I:331;1778;Fanning as precocious preteen daughter and teen son (Justin Chatwin) work with Cruise for beautifully believable portrayal of a blue.
I:331;1779;h. g. Wells legendary story provides backdrop for excellent portrayal of the stress between NON.
I:331;1780;There is plenty of action, and some of it is well done, but some is overdone.
I:331;1781;the movie does a very good job of portraying what actually would happen using technology and stunning special effects to capture the imagination of the people watching the film.
I:331;1782;the narration is done by Morgan Freeman, who does a great job.
I:331;1783;overall it is very good film that really captures your imagination and makes you appreciate nature for all it's worth.
I:331;1784;War of the Worlds is one of the most breathtaking movies I've ever seen.
I:331;1785;The attack on the city is done in a more realistic way than ID4.
I:331;1786;Spielberg always wanted to make a War of the Worlds movie and this is a remake that's actually extremely good.
I:331;1787;although Tom Cruise is a bit nuts these days he's still one of the best actors around.
I:331;1788;Although the attacks and the aliens are more of the star than him, he still gives a great performance.
I:331;1789;Dakota Fanning (Man on Fire) is equally good as his daughter.
I:331;1790;I think this is Spielberg's most terrifying ride, even more so than Jurassic Park and Jaws.
I:331;1791;It's haunting, gripping, emotional and just well done.
I:331;1792;It takes away from the realistic nature of the film.
I:331;1793;I have watched the old movie and I have to say that the remake is really cool.
I:331;1794;I was always a fan of the original book by H. g Wells, mainly for its sheer imagination and scope for a book that was scribed in late 19th Century England.
I:331;1795;Now to finally see it in its full glory was something I eagerly anticipated.
I:331;1796;And the fact that Spielberg was directing was just a nice sweetener (although this would have been a great project for James Cameron).
I:331;1797;It primarily focuses on one man, and his ability to deal with the situation that is unfolding before him.
I:331;1798;We, the audience go along for the ride, and see the events from a very close and personal perspective.
I:331;1799;apart from the Alien Invaders, what makes this film so frightening is that we see it from a point of view that this could happen anytime tomorrow or the next day.
I:331;1800;Spielberg injects a healthy dose of realism into the film that makes it really believable.
I:331;1801;What's great about this is that Wells even talked about the moral and philosophical aspects of an alien invasion.
I:331;1802;Naturally these points are not mentioned in the film, but they do make some great reading.
I:331;1803;And you quickly realise that Spielberg decided to leave out, what could have been some very satisfying points to the overall plot.
I:331;1804;In fact the aliens don't look CGI at all, which is a nice relief, even though they are totally CGI, and it's clear that their technology and weapons reflects their evolution as a species.
I:331;1805;This is one area that Spielberg (with the help of visual effects juggernaut ILM) really excels.
I:331;1806;It's little details like this that make Spielberg such a master filmmaker, his attention to detail.
I:331;1807;It's also obvious that life in outer space is something Spielberg thinks about a lot, and is totally fascinated with, and after all it is probably the greatest question we as a species in this universe have.
I:331;1808;If War of the Worlds was much more grander and epic than this really could have been one of the greatest Science Fiction movies ever made, but as it stands it's just a very good movie, and nothing much more than that.
I:331;1809;keep in mind these are really all trivial points I've highlighted as no movie is perfect, and it's always going to happen when you've got such a loved and revered topic such as this.
I:331;1810;"Some nice commntry and lots of nice ""how we did it"" segments for all the special effects buffs."
I:331;1811;there's always going to be fans that don't appreciate what Spielberg was trying to convey.
I:331;1812;War of the Worlds is still a lot of fun, visually stunning and a truly frightening tale delivered to us by one of the greatest film makers of our time.
I:331;1813;I thought the special effects of the movie were really great.
I:331;1814;Dakota Fanning was my absolute favorite actress in this movie.
I:331;1815;She really gave a great performance.
I:331;1816;I would definately recommend this movie as a matinee showing only.
I:331;1817;This movie started right into the action, BANG!
I:331;1818;There's a little bit of explanation of the family situation at the beginning.
I:331;1819;The aliens come right away and the rest of the movie is about their survival.
I:331;1820;It is a miracle that any of them made it through alive, so a little hard to believe.
I:331;1821;It was a good movie, but not spectacular like other Spelberg movies.
I:331;1822;L. Ron's favorite son does it again with lots of help from his ex.
I:331;1823;This dark, unsettling, claustrophobic take on a Martian invasion is a winner because it keeps the viewer on par with the on.
I:331;1824;I never saw the original or read the book, so I was pleasantly surprised and satisfied with the ending.
I:331;1825;This was a very intense and entertaining movie.
I:331;1826;All I can say is that I was very impressed with the special effects, especially the sound.
I:331;1827;Excellent movie for surround sound enthusiasts.
I:331;1828;one of the things that I love about this movie is how the focus is strictly centered around Ray and his family.
I:331;1829;It's a refreshing departure from so many other movies that always put the focus on the President and the Pentagon and how they are going to save us from destruction.
I:331;1830;The intensity is far greater and more enjoyable experiencing the movie only through Ray's eyes.
I:331;1831;It makes it seem so much more real.
I:331;1832;very well made and perfect for showing off your home theater with all the special effects!
I:331;1833;There's really not much to it, besides of course its grand scale production, special effects, loud explosions, big movie star names, etc.
I:331;1834;I think this is the best of all time
I:331;1835;This brings in a sense of familiarity, important to making one feel as though the alien invasion not only could happen, but as the movie moves along, it makes one feel as though it in fact is occuring in front of your very eyes.
I:331;1836;A great way to start the film off, no doubt.
I:331;1837;It is an experience in itself, but when coupled with the imagery, it is even more powerful.
I:331;1838;the character of Tom Cruise is a lot more developed than I'd expected, as I watched him transform from a deadbeat father to a man hellbent on doing whatever it takes for him and his family to survive, and I do mean anything.
I:331;1839;When she does have a scene to focus her skills on (the basement), she is astounding and has a range unlike many her age.
I:331;1840;I was impressed with this as it kept true to the spirit of Wells' novel in following the narrator's view, something that was lost in the big spectacle of the 1950s version (still a decent show, I might add).
I:331;1841;It stayed true to Wells' vision, and more importantly, is very humble.
I:331;1842;in all, I was very impressed with this film, enough that I went to go see it again the very day it made its debut into my life.
I:331;1843;ridden, nervewracking experiences in the history of cinema to date.
I:331;1844;Anyways, it was a pretty good movie, though i expected more, and something differnt.
I:331;1845;I did like the begginning, and i really loved the ending, but the middle didnt please me much, from when the family gets in the car and starts making thier way to boston( i believe it was boston), until the basement fortress scenes, it just wasnt as good as i thought it would be, though i thought it did a great job of portraying how people act in situations such as these.
I:331;1846;This film, although based on fiction, somehow manages to quicken our heartbeats a bit with its sinister realism.
I:331;1847;plagued landscape in the northeast.
I:331;1848;A frightening look at a grim possibility and a realistic portrayal of human nature when its at most desperate and lowest level.
I:331;1849;War of the Worlds was a good movie, but the Blu.
I:331;1850;Yeah, the effects are cool.
I:331;1851;It is a very entertaining movie.
I:331;1852;(It reminded me a lot of Independence day) Being a fan of the sci.
I:331;1853;It's science fiction people, so give it a break!
I:331;1854;I thought it was well directed, good acting, and I loved the special effects!
I:331;1855;Dakota Fanning is good, but she still is given little to work with.
I:331;1856;though she is still very believable.
I:331;1857;the special effects are, of course, very good.
I:331;1858;but I wonder is they are good enough.
I:331;1859;The special effects are good but the rest is not much.
I:331;1860;"hearted
I:331;1861;But it is a horror film blessed with splendid cinematography from Janusz Kaminski and a fine, often understated, film score composed by John Williams.
I:331;1862;"And Dakota Fanning's performance as his daughter may be the best acting I've seen from a young actress since Jodie Foster in ""Taxi Driver""."
I:331;1863;Tim Robbins is equally superb in a supporting role as the creepy hermit Ogilvy.
I:331;1864;if I have one major criticism of the film, then it is how neatly Spielberg and his screen co. writers, Josh Friedman and David Koepp, tie up all the loose ends, leaving the audience with a terse, tearful, yet happy family reunion.
I:331;1865;"It is one of the most emotionally riveting films I have seen in the last year or so
I:331;1866;"what Steven Spielberg has done is build an impressive ""bubble"" (as grand master Kurosawa once named it) of hope and inspiration surrounding the lamentable story."
I:331;1867;this is supremely entertaining with an important message: THIS IS A TRUE STORY.
I:331;1868;Besides, Tchikavoslky said so, and this is Spielberg's way of saying so, too.
I:331;1869;fi movie in it, if you also want to fit drama in it.
I:331;1870;WOTW the book by HGW was about the suspense, the story, the thrill, and the movie captured none of it.
I:331;1871;At least read one of those easy guides for WOTW, it's worth it.
I:331;1872;After ordering the movies War of the Worlds and Minority Report (Widescreen Two.
I:331;1873;the movie in of itself is a tremendous work of storytelling.
I:331;1874;the original inspiration, Spielberg had for the film, was based on (Like I said before) childhood he had growing up.
I:331;1875;Spielberg does a great job at portraying a paranoia that one can experience when something like this occurs.
I:331;1876;This is not a movie meant for kids or family, but is a great action, adventure, sci.
I:331;1877;The movie also possesses a great Biblical message on he bond between children and their father.
I:331;1878;It was a radio show, and then more than one memorable movie.
I:331;1879;steven Spielberg's winningest formula is to mate contemporary family dynamics (and their resonant emotions) with good stories about extraordinary situations.
I:331;1880;There are so many masterfully controlled images and sounds coming at you here, that you get to thinking that the auteur does not want you doing much figuring at all.
I:331;1881;speilberg knows how to punch an audience's buttons and keep them coming back for that all.
I:331;1882;well, it's a good movie, but not a great movie.
I:331;1883;This might be as good as it gets.
I:331;1884;The last time Spielberg used a high.
I:331;1885;His talent as a filmmaker is not in question.
I:331;1886;the Rolling Stones are arguably the best, most prolific, and most popular rock band in the world.
I:331;1887;if he wants to make a movie about family values, fine.
I:331;1888;But please, Steve, don't take a project like a WOTW concept, package and sell it to the world as a Summer Fun Ride about evil aliens, and then deliver us a film where the basic concept of the story takes a backseat to your personal agenda about what gives you the big warm.
I:331;1889;"handed in the ""family values"" department as I'd feared it would be."
I:331;1890;Oh it certainly is there, to be sure, but in a swallowable dose.
I:331;1891;but here's what's good, and here's what's not so good:GOOD: The film's first act is the strongest and most compelling to watch, though it would have been even better had the film unit sought the technical advice of an expert on human crowd/mob behavior during times of extreme crisis or emotional distress.
I:331;1892;the mechanical tripods the aliens pilot are impressively ominous and creepy.
I:331;1893;I thought that scene rang the most truthful of all the scenes involving the panicking Earthlings.
I:331;1894;"jeopardy moment and the ""Wow"" factor that Tom could walk scores of miles to and through Boston in such short time."
I:331;1895;grenades thrown by the movie's central character works just fine.
I:331;1896;makers like Spielberg ever actually watch their own films with an audience member's pair of eyes anymore.
I:331;1897;I wonder if they are even capable.
I:331;1898;But since when do we want our chief filmmakers to sacrifice a good story at the altar of sentiment?
I:331;1899;Hollywood has long stopped making movies anyone over fourteen can enjoy.
I:331;1900;there are wonderful films being made in China, France, Germany, and other places .
I:331;1901;date this view of America is to much of the world, but he keeps trying to plant the view in every film.
I:331;1902;"Spielberg turns H. g. wells' wonderful fantasy tale, with serious political and social overtones, into a Gomer Pyle sermonette on ""family values."""
I:331;1903;To have the work of this committed internationalist, pacifist, and advocate of world institutions turned into middle.
I:331;1904;Cruise is just like nails on chalk board, but Speilberg is a master of entertainment.
I:331;1905;I loved this movie and bought it the first day it came out!
I:331;1906;But this simplicity leads us to ask several questions.
I:331;1907;All we know is that people want to live and escape from the invaders, and that people will do everything they can to stay alive.
I:331;1908;This straightforward premise is a setup for Steven Spielberg to utilize astounding visual effects for the sole purpose of evoking some very basic emotions in the audience, mainly fear and wonder.
I:331;1909;War of the Worlds succeeds in that it's a gripping, immersive movie, and its ambiguous plot allows it to be this way, becoming one of the greatest strengths of the film.
I:331;1910;"but ""how is Ray going to stay alive?"""
I:331;1911;The close proximity of the audience to Ray and his family forces us to wonder how we would handle such a situation, what we would do to protect those that we know, and by avoiding the extraneous and making us examine such possibilities through Spielberg's main character, each action set piece and visual spectacle is filled with an underlying sense of dread, wonder, and unbridled intensity.
I:331;1912;Spielberg's action is focused, energetic, and wonderful, with an excellent sense of pacing, which could have been ruined without some obscurity.
I:331;1913;i really thought Spielberg had come up with yet another masterpiece.
I:331;1914;steven Spielburg is one of my favorite directors,but his attempt to remake War of the Worlds takes a back seat to just passing.
I:331;1915;War of the Worlds is an impressive movie with some surprising twists.
I:331;1916;wife, Mary Ann, played by the lovely Miranda Otto of Lord of the Rings fame.
I:331;1917;"This ""adaptation"" of H. g. wells classic has absolutely NOTHING to do with the book."
I:331;1918;"It's entitled ""War of the Worlds"" and is quite good for the 'genre'."
I:331;1919;Plus, the audience is treated to a God's.
I:331;1920;however, the movie has wonderful special effects, and Spielberg slightly bleaches the film to make everything look gritty and realistic, and, I think, it helps the CGIs blend in.
I:331;1921;Sounds, as well, are incredible and terrifying, especially the aliens' low.
I:331;1922;This movie is so much better in Blu.
I:331;1923;The story is wild and the actors are the best for it.
I:331;1924;This is now like the original Black and White movie from the 50's.
I:331;1925;Tom Cruise does an excellent job as an estranged father trusted with his kids when the invasion begins.
I:331;1926;Cruise portrays a crane operator with simple desires who comes off as a true everyman through the course of the film.
I:331;1927;Their unique attributes were hidden in almost all of the scenes.
I:331;1928;But all of that aside, the film was really quite good.
I:331;1929;Seeing Cruise go through all of the emotions he does helps make his character believable.
I:331;1930;For those who dont understand what this means, it is the point at which you can no longer hear sound but the body can still feel it.
I:331;1931;"My Velodyne 8"" tried and cryed."
I:331;1932;Im not kidding on this one particular scene the bass starts playing hardcore and continues for well over a minute.
I:331;1933;It'll having you grinning ear to ear.
I:331;1934;fi and thriller movies to the purpose of streamlining the narrative and keeping the length reasonable.
I:331;1935;Quite impressive that there was always an easily navigable path thru the stalled cars.
I:331;1936;Sorry, Steven, movie making is a lot more than that, and you know it.
I:331;1937;I read the book when I was quite young and found it very frightening.
I:331;1938;This new movie has to be the scariest movie I have ever seen!
I:331;1939;Perhaps having a home theater helps, and a big plasma screen contributes to the overall effect, but anyone who is into special effects will love this one!
I:331;1940;"The acting was excellent, and although it has a few notable flaws
I:331;1941;The bonus materials are great also.
I:331;1942;Morgan Freeman's opening narration is chillingly done, though his last few words ('plotted against us') are spoken very quietly and get stepped on.
I:331;1943;ILM did a fantastic job on the alien machines.
I:331;1944;There are many treatments of that theme, and I compliment all involved here for not copping out by turning Dad and the kids into an Ozzie and Harriet God Bless Us Everyone family again at the end.
I:331;1945;I got War of the Words as a gift.
I:331;1946;I just love the movie, the special effects are spectacular.
I:331;1947;This was a good movie that I enjoyed better than the original.
I:331;1948;Speilberg did a great job with this and Tom Cruise did a job well done also.
I:331;1949;It had a couple of parts that I questioned but all in all I enjoyed this movie.
I:331;1950;The aliens were very cool and this movie was shot very well.
I:331;1951;I overall enjoyed this movie, and although I never liked the ending to this story, I still enjoyed this movie a lot.
I:331;1952;Based on a large sample size of about 1000 this film only rated three to four stars with Amazon fans, which really surprised me.
I:331;1953;Notwithstanding, Tom Cruise and everybody involved did their jobs very well, and the film entertained and kept my interest to the end.
I:331;1954;I knew the main story line, but nevertheless, this film surprised me.
I:331;1955;They obviously reflected their mother's feelings and were mean.
I:331;1956;mouthed and very disrespectful to their father.
I:331;1957;when the Aliens attack Earth, the children are spending a weekend with their Dad.
I:331;1958;He has to pull himself together, make a plan of survival and take care of a pre.
I:331;1959;The alien attack is terrifying and the special effects are really well done.
I:331;1960;Tom Cruise was believable in the role and turns Ray Ferrier into the real father that his children need.
I:331;1961;"Welcome back your ""space home"" Spielberg!Most of us remember very well a touching and an unic movie E. t. especially, that event when a little boy and E. t touched each others forefingers."
I:331;1962;the Encounters of Third Kind was also a classic alien movie what Spielberg made in the 1977.
I:331;1963;"after these two classic ""alien movies"" Spielberg was producer some same sort of movies for exemple Men in Black."
I:331;1964;series was his personal return to alien theme and this is his first and real own alien movie since 1982(E. t.)I waited for lot this movie which is going to much better than Indepence Day.
I:331;1965;Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning played theri roles well and believable way.
I:331;1966;Fanning is a terrific child actor!
I:331;1967;Aliens were efficient killers and their cracts were cool.
I:331;1968;Tom Cruise is very good in this movie.
I:331;1969;He always seems like he's scared and that he's aware of what is happening.
I:331;1970;I was very impressed with this film, but I usually am by Spielberg.
I:331;1971;He's the best storyteller in modern movie making, and very good and telling a great story, while providing exciting action.
I:331;1972;I was very satisfied with Steven Spielberg's latest epic, War of the Worlds.
I:331;1973;Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning put on great performances, and the special effects and suspense were great.
I:331;1974;The special effects were great, all of the buildings and the bridge collapsing.
I:331;1975;Ray and his family escapes in a stolen car, and one scene which was one of best in the entire movie, was when they drove through a town of frightened townspeople who were all trying to steal Ray's car, they were rocking it back and forth and breaking windows and trying to hurt the family, and Ray started to fight them and threatened them with a gun.
I:331;1976;"potential, but is definitely an entertaining and suspenseful summer flick, one of the films that they call ""popcorn flicks""."
I:331;1977;Spielberg can still direct amazing films, and Cruise can still put on great performances, either as the hero (Mission:Impossible) or the villian (Collateral), he still is good at what he does.
I:331;1978;And he has a great.
I:331;1979;I reccomend this film to anyone who loves an entertaining thrill.
I:331;1980;"spielsberg has created a cautionary tale about Imperialism and our complacency in the dominance over our affairs, and given us a great ""Chase movie""."
I:331;1981;While characterization is slight, and there are nits to be found everywhere, the movie strikes balances of horror, terror, and enough breathing space to keep the audience primed for the next inhumanity.
I:331;1982;The ending, and the defeat of the Aliens is completely true to the source material.
I:331;1983;The movie captures that idea, and brings it to our day, our backyard.
I:331;1984;Those wanting to see a big summer special effects blockbuster with lots of alien vs man will be partially satisfied, but go with an open mind.
I:331;1985;especially Tim Robbin's Oglivy and those in the scenes at the Hudson Ferry are really telling.
I:331;1986;In the end: All people are self.
I:331;1987;A stellar movie with decent acting, excellent special effects, and a classic storyline.
I:331;1988;Overall a good film, especially on the big screen.
I:331;1989;soon the terror begins, with an extraordinarily intense lightning storm, as the sky darkens and a strange light shines through the clouds.
I:331;1990;fi movies goes, Spielberg has done well, with the plentiful, expert special effects we associate with him.
I:331;1991;this is one of Cruise's best films yet.
I:331;1992;it's a wonderful with an all star cast including tom cruise and tim robbins.
I:331;1993;this is a great movie i would reccomend it to anyone.
I:331;1994;and as always, steven speilberg's directing is incredible and jaw.
I:331;1995;if you aren't sure that this film is worth your time, i can assure you that it is!
I:331;1996;MOVIE: Well here it is, the big one.
I:331;1997;The public has pretty damn high expectations for #1 all time director (as voted in a poll).
I:331;1998;Let me tell you, this movie is on you seat entertainment, Spielberg grabs your attention and will not let go.
I:331;1999;Marketing for this film was brilliant since they kept the lid on tight.
I:331;2000;The film is breathtaking, it really is.
I:331;2001;The action in the film is structured with perfection, especially this one scene in the basement of a house as Tom Cruise, Dakota Fanning, and Tim Robbins are trying to keep out of the aliens' sight.
I:331;2002;The action is compelling, but the characters themselves are not.
I:331;2003;The characters are all well developed, but they don't go anywhere.
I:331;2004;When you give an audience that much to work with you have to have a grand culmination in the end, and the script just doesn't deliver.
I:331;2005;Instead the focus was wrapping up with the action, and that made the movie fall short for me.
I:331;2006;aCTING: Dakota Fanning is a fine actress and I truly believe she'll be around as an actress for as long as she wants.
I:331;2007;He naturally works in every movie, but I don't think it will ever get him an Oscar.
I:331;2008;bOTTOM LINE: I really found the movie to be entertaining even though Koepp's script falls short in the end.
I:331;2009;Spielberg knows what he wants, and when he knows it he'll go for it.
I:331;2010;With E. t he found a way into the warmth of our hearts, with Close Encounters he found his way into our curiosity, and now with War of the Worlds he found his way with chaos and terror.
I:331;2011;Spielberg also decided to go with the same look as Minority Report.
I:331;2012;It wasn't the best we've seen from Spielberg or Koepp, but it sure was a fun watch.
I:331;2013;But I honestly believe this movie has great re.
I:331;2014;watch potential, is a very entertaining movie, and I'm really glad I bought it.
I:331;2015;Based on a large sample size of about 1000 this film only rated three to four stars with Amazon fans, which really surprised me.
I:331;2016;Notwithstanding, Tom Cruise and everybody involved did their jobs very well, and the film entertained and kept my interest to the end.
I:331;2017;so many changes were made to the story that I felt it was worth seeing the movie.
I:331;2018;i think that comparisons with the original great film are impossible to make, and each film is a product of its time.
I:331;2019;I confess, I almost always enjoy Tom Cruise, but don't consider myself a real fan.
I:331;2020;I feel that he just does good work.
I:331;2021;Steven Spielberg should also get some credit for a well made film.
I:331;2022;The graphics and Spielbergs version were excellent.
I:331;2023;The film definitely brought me back, in picture, action, and in ambience, to the way everything felt after the first jihadist attack on American property since the 19th century Barbary raids.
I:331;2024;dakota Fanning is superb in this film.
I:331;2025;This is my first time seeing Justin Chatwin, who plays Robbie, and he impressed me as a young actor.
I:331;2026;But all in all, it made me jump in my seat a lot, kept me a wake, and got me thinking.
I:331;2027;Bring someone to hold your hand.
I:331;2028;The original is much better even though this one has the big boomy special effects.
I:331;2029;Good thing too, cuz that's about all it had going for it!
I:331;2030;The little girl needed smacked big time!
I:331;2031;invasion popcorn movie: this is an extremely scary and convincing vision of apocalypse.
I:331;2032;"A great deal of artistry and skill has gone into making the visual effects and many other facets of this film believable, and comparing ""Worlds"" to ostensibly similar movies shows you why Spielberg is so much smarter than most other filmmakers."
I:331;2033;the wisest choice was telling the story entirely from the point of view of the main characters, a divorced father and the two children with whom he has a shaky relationship, and the way family dynamics play out amidst catastrophe is surprisingly affecting.
I:331;2034;Worlds has real psychological contours and characters who feel genuine, and this is impressive to see in a big.
I:331;2035;including some exquisite sound design.
I:331;2036;but this is easily excused.
I:331;2037;It fills with a lot of excitement and thrilling moment.
I:331;2038;Tom Cruise really rocks in this movie, as he needs to survive under alien machines attack.
I:331;2039;This is a real kind of Steven Spielberg's movie as he does a good job in this action and sci.
I:331;2040;fi movies by Steven Spielberg but he suits to shoot more of his sci.
I:331;2041;fi movies and those movie are always performs well in box office.
I:331;2042;For this movie, it is a good example as it really performs well in box office.
I:331;2043;For the story, it is good because it is exciting.
I:331;2044;But the unthinkable and, ultimately, the unexpected happen to him in an extraordinary sense.
I:331;2045;He acts very well as his role of Ray Ferrier.
I:331;2046;For the direction, it is real good.
I:331;2047;It is because this movie fills with excitement.
I:331;2048;So, it is very well direction.
I:331;2049;For the visual, it is excellent because it is a movie with the war with aliens.
I:331;2050;Those aliens are very good design.
I:331;2051;Also, towards the end of the movie, the police fire the alien machine, I like it and it is so exciting for that visual scene.
I:331;2052;The special effects come perfect for this whole movie.
I:331;2053;The visual is good with no doubts.
I:331;2054;For the music, it is good because it all suits and fills the tense in this movie.
I:331;2055;As well as the sound effect, it is so exciting and thrilling.
I:331;2056;Overall, it is a good movie and it is truly recommended.
I:331;2057;"ILM's visuals are chilling and stunning, from the subtle, to the not so subtle, they sell this movie: ""Martian Tri."
I:331;2058;"pods, their death rays, and their pilots"" the SFX are as brilliant as you will see this summer."
I:331;2059;The intensity of the film may overcome this hurdle, leaving audiences little time to breath, even the films introduction to Cruise's deadbeat dad is remarkable short before events begin to rapidly unfold.
I:331;2060;The screenplay by Koepp and Friedman, based on H. g. Wells' novel, finds man as great a monster as any invader (as seen in initial evacuation scenes).
I:331;2061;Film buffs should watch for an homage or two including an iconic ET prop.
I:331;2062;This is no Independence Day, in spite of its synchronization with the holiday, but it is a great summer release closer to Spielberg's work of old.
I:331;2063;watch both the classic version and this updated in one evening, now that is a great evening.
I:331;2064;The effects are intense and devastating, the direction tight and powerful, and the small cast excellent.
I:331;2065;Typical Speilberg family dynamics are there, but subtle and they work well.
I:331;2066;Cruise, Fanning, and Robbins are great.
I:331;2067;I think he is quite effective here.
I:331;2068;This remake is a great update.
I:331;2069;the Cinematography, Special Effects, actors performance, great.
I:331;2070;i thought Tom Cruise performance was particularly well.
I:331;2071;The whole movie is a fantisc ride.
I:331;2072;i loved it, my family loved it.
I:331;2073;And if you are In Southern California you can vist Universal Studios and see the the giant plane crash set!
I:331;2074;The film started out very well, with plenty of build.
I:331;2075;"Unlike M. Night Shyamalan's ""Signs,"" in which the conclusion was both clever and unexpected, I knew all along what would kill off the aliens."
I:331;2076;climactic endings I've seen in years.
I:331;2077;The special effects, for the most part, are very impressive.
I:331;2078;in all actuality, I should give this film only two stars, but the film is so good up until the last twenty or thirty minutes that I do believe it is worthy of at least one viewing.
I:331;2079;"Also, the special effects really are excellent excepting the silly ""Oz"" set."
I:331;2080;Bottom line: Great special affects, great acting by Cruise, Fanning and Robinson.
I:331;2081;In spite of these minor issues, the plot is well thought out(even for a remake) and the action and suspense is well proportion to the character developement.
I:331;2082;Call me silly but this is one of my top 10 movies of all time!
I:331;2083;H. g. Wells' novel War of the Worlds is remarkably good, at least that is how I remembered it when I read it about 20 years ago.
I:331;2084;My personal experiences with the novel might have influenced my personal judgment of the film by Spielberg, whose films I have frequently revisited for both entertainment and study.
I:331;2085;ray steals a car while dealing with his own panic.
I:331;2086;their escape turns to a road movie of sorts with a heavy touch of science fiction and contemporary social issues.
I:331;2087;The science fictions scenes offer big time CGI that displays grand battle and destruction scenes.
I:331;2088;Many of Spielberg's films offer the infamous happy ending where everything is neatly packaged, which is one of the qualities that I admire about Spielberg.
I:331;2089;This new version of War of the Worlds is really about family ties.
I:331;2090;also, Speilberg uses a lot of unnessacary 9/11 imagery to create emotional pathos and to do this for a B. movie was in unforgivably bad taste.
I:331;2091;War of the Worlds was an amazing movie.
I:331;2092;The base is just phenomenal.
I:331;2093;This should be rated at least 4 stars in stead of 3
I:331;2094;fi pioneer H. g. Wells or the earlier 1950's film version, this summer blockbuster will always come in second.
I:331;2095;The SFX are, of course, outstanding and spectacular, and the alien Tripods are truly frightening mechanized monsters that are easy to believe capable of stomping all over Creation.
I:331;2096;Nakota Fanning is believable as Cruise's terrified daughter and their evolving relationship is developed with some genuine sympathy and realism.
I:331;2097;This is not the definitive War of the Worlds, and certainly no cinematic masterpiece, but it is entertaining, and a film no sci.
I:331;2098;War of the Worlds is fantastic, One of the best Action movies of the year.
I:331;2099;The effects are great, and it even has tom cruise.
I:331;2100;which is a good thing, in acting that people.
I:331;2101;Which starts a huge earthquake and these giant alien things pop out and starts destroying the whole city.
I:331;2102;And all the action and drama kicks in.
I:331;2103;The real Oscar winner here is the effects.
I:331;2104;fi action movie person you will love this movie i give it a 5 out of 5.
I:331;2105;"Steven Spielberg's ""War of the Worlds"" really delivers as an action/thriller."
I:331;2106;the special effects are wonderful: Cities are flattened, cars are tossed in the air, a ferry boat is overturned, and it's all completely believable.
I:331;2107;Combined with the excellent John Williams score, the effects are so intense that I often found myself holding my breath, eyes wide open, flattened against the back of my chair.
I:331;2108;this movie is genuinely scary, and fans of the 1953 version will enjoy seeing Gene Barry in a cameo.
I:331;2109;steven Speilberg does his usual impeccable job of creating an alternative world onscreen, and the special effects are stunning, but WAR OF THE WORLDS never really captures the imagination in the manner which Wells did, or George Pal's 1953 film did.
I:331;2110;in sum, WAR OF THE WORLDS is a classic story that deserves a much better treatment.
I:331;2111;I like the 1953 version better.
I:331;2112;Even though it took a while for my PS3 to read the contents of the disk and start playing it, it works perfectly.
I:331;2113;What I also like about this release is the correct aspect ratio (no black bars) and while the picture is not as crisp as Avatar for example, it is still pretty good.
I:331;2114;Another good characteristic of this production is the good balance between real world visual effects and CGIs.
I:331;2115;I highly recommend this Blu Ray version over all others.
I:331;2116;The Blu Ray extras are really nice too.
I:331;2117;wow, where do I start.
I:331;2118;ok Ray's a huge auto gearhead, and I'll give him credit.
I:331;2119;Wow, maybe there were some excess gasoline tanks stored in the back of the van.
I:331;2120;runs of Independence Day, Cocoon or Signs to see some fun, suspenseful alien movies.
I:331;2121;The War Of The Worlds is intriguing!
I:331;2122;Tom Cruise is excellent as Ray Ferrier.
I:331;2123;Dakota Fanning and Justin Chatwin are also excellent as Rachel and Robbie Ferrier.
I:331;2124;Steven Spielberg's directing is brilliant and well.
I:331;2125;The screenplay by David Koepp and Josh Friedman, based on H. g. Wells' novel, is excellent.
I:331;2126;The music by John Williams is impressive and brilliant.
I:331;2127;The cinematography by Janusz Kaminski is excellent.
I:331;2128;The film editing by Michael Kahn is excellent.
I:331;2129;The casting by Debra Zane and Terri Taylor is excellent.
I:331;2130;The production design by Rick Carter is brilliant and well.
I:331;2131;The art direction by Tony Fanning, Andrew Menzies, Edward Pisoni, and Tom Warren is brilliant and well.
I:331;2132;The set decoration by Anne Kuljian is outstanding and brilliant.
I:331;2133;The costume design by Joanna Johnston is excellent.
I:331;2134;The visual effects (Oscar nominated) by Industrial Light and Magic are breathtaking and masterful.

I:331;2137;This is one of the year's best!
I:331;2138;Also nominated for Best Sound and Sound Editing.
I:331;2139;This is undoubtedly one of Spielberg's best movies, showcasing his fantastic filmmaking talent.
I:331;2140;This goes beyond the original film in terms of action.
I:331;2141;Miranda Otto gives strong support as well.
I:331;2142;"The maestro has done it again
I:331;2143;worthy soundtrack for any film ever.
I:331;2144;Janusz Kaminski's stunning cinematography is a technical highlight, and Michael Kahn's sharp editing has served the famous director for almost 30 years.
I:331;2145;Rick Carter's astonishing production design is the films' biggest payoff, with mind.
I:331;2146;This is an interesting slant for Spielberg.

I:331;2149;name actors, but Cruise gives possibly his best performance to date.
I:331;2150;Everything about this movie is perfect.
I:331;2151;I really enjoyed the special effects and feeling the movie gave you of Aliens breathing down your neck.
I:331;2152;The huge war mechs the aliens had, looked very cool.
I:331;2153;, and I think the ending is a cool idea.
I:331;2154;It is surprising to me to say that Lucas' Revenge of the Sith had deeper issues in it's head than this Spielberg movie.
I:331;2155;This film is just pure spectacle and it excels in that.
I:331;2156;This version is fantastic in setting up it's scenes and milking the terror for all it's worth.
I:331;2157;The special effects were amazing.
I:331;2158;Every movie Spielberg has done with child actors have been suffused with Barrymore mannerisms.
I:331;2159;Barrymore is always fun to watch and she would have been great in Tom Cruise's role.
I:331;2160;out creepy and did a darn good job of it.
I:331;2161;In the original there was quite a slew of subplots, keeping the audience somewhat interested in watching more, which is the point of subplots.
I:331;2162;If ur into the whole surround sound showcase thing, then this movie is great for showing off ur system.
I:331;2163;But I enjoy watching Dakota Fanning.
I:331;2164;But don't be misled, the movie was excellent.
I:331;2165;Tim Robbins was a pleasant surprise in this movie.
I:331;2166;"Using today's wonderful filmmaking technique and technical wizardry, here is the updated ""War of the Worlds"" from last year that pits unfriendly visitors against humans."
I:331;2167;It is a remake of the famous 1939 radio broadcast and the still marvelous film from the 1950s with, unfortuantely, the same copout ending.
I:331;2168;probably the best part is the relative scale of the invaders' tripods, as they appear to be 50.75 feet tall against the backdrop of us tiny humans, our abodes and our popgun military might, which can't seem to do a thing to the bad guys.
I:331;2169;So here's a thrilling visual story of events that have been played out a couple times before with the same results.
I:331;2170;"To me, it's kind of like ""Batman Part 6"" as opposed to anything original."
I:331;2171;I enjoyed watching it but didn't think much of it the next day.
I:331;2172;even a great director can flub it up.
I:331;2173;in this day and age,any goofball with a computer and a GED can do some neat stuff.
I:331;2174;(i would have given this an extra star!)
I:331;2175;This is the first significant alien invasion story and in many ways it remains the best because it defines the essence of the genre: alien invaders want what we have and have come to take it away from us.
I:331;2176;a lot of Spielberg's films are about fathers and sons, albeit usually absent fathers and their symbolic replacements.
I:331;2177;But we know such elements resonate with Spielberg (and with us when we see the fear on Rachel's face and hear her scream), just as we know that it is necessary for Ray to be able to drive through the magic lane available on the highway or over the wreckage of a downed airliner to be able to advance the stories.
I:331;2178;fi flicks, and this adaptation of H. G. Wells' classic novel, which was first published in 1898 and often touted as the world's first published work of science fiction, is no exception.
I:331;2179;I simply loved this film and was riveted to the screen the entire time.
I:331;2180;Updated to reflect the world of today, the film does the book justice, maintaining the core of the story and keeping many of its moral imperatives at the forefront.
I:331;2181;Steven Spielberg definitely pulls out all the stops, rendering a first class, alien invasion film.
I:331;2182;The film is grounded entirely in this context.
I:331;2183;this is an exciting film with spectacular special effects.
I:331;2184;tom Cruise, notwithstanding all his negative personal publicity of late, gives a marvelous performance, infusing his character with just the right amount of initial cock.
I:331;2185;Tim Robbins gives a compelling performance as Ogilvy, an ambulance driver in a pre.
I:331;2186;invasion world, who has seen his entire family annihilated by the alien invaders.
I:331;2187;Ogilvy is clearly a man on the edge of reason, who wants to destroy the aliens and get the better of them.
I:331;2188;This brings about an eventual conflict between the two with an unsettling and primal resolution.
I:331;2189;the film begins and ends with a voice over narration masterfully done by Morgan Freeman, whose mellifluous voice lends just the right note to the film.
I:331;2190;Coupled with a great story, really spectacular special effects, fine performances, and deft direction by Steven Spielberg, this film, despite its flawed final scene, has all the makings of a great sci.
I:331;2191;It is a film worthy of being in one's personal collection.
I:331;2192;I got a chance to see the new War of the Worlds film today and my verdict is that it is spectacular.
I:331;2193;she is a great little actor.
I:331;2194;fi or Action films sould enjoy this movie.
I:331;2195;I could see it really had viewers on the edge of their seats including me.
I:331;2196;I think most viewers will be able to put their disdain for Tom Cruise aside and enjoy this film.
I:331;2197;Speilberg did a good job as usual.
I:331;2198;I also recommend watching the original from 1953 before watching this remake.
I:331;2199;The original is a stand alone classic and is one of my favorite Sci.
I:331;2200;fi movies and considered the greatest Sci.
I:331;2201;I'd looked forward with great anticipation to this film and on the whole it made the grade.
I:331;2202;the day before i saw it, a couple of friends of mine who saw it prior to me slated it, so it was with some trepidation that i took my seat in the cinema.
I:331;2203;So i had an open mind on that aspect.
I:331;2204;'Loved it to be honest.
I:331;2205;The special effects were absolutely fantastic .
I:331;2206;some of the scenes will stick in my mind for a long time to come .
I:331;2207;Phew!It was good to see some references to the original story, in particular, the tripods .
I:331;2208;pretty much how i imagined them to look .
I:331;2209;spine chilling, Insane Ogilvy and the Ferry incident (which translated well from 19th to 21st Century).
I:331;2210;The daughter (Dakota Fanning) was brilliant for her age and Tim Robbins portrayed an adequate Ogilvy.
I:331;2211;one thing that really pleased me and one that dissappointed me to finish.
I:331;2212;Don't get me wrong, I love America as a country and it's people, but as a Brit it's sometimes a bit much that in films of this Nature, America usually saves the world .
I:331;2213;So quite refreshing that that wasn't the case here.
I:331;2214;not how the martians were finally overcome, but well.
I:331;2215;you'll understand when you see it.
I:331;2216;overall: Go and see it.
I:331;2217;The special effects are, excuse the pun, Out of this world.
I:331;2218;I admit, I love alien movies and this one does not disappoint.
I:331;2219;There was a lot of action and suspense and of course alien invasion which was dramatic and fun to watch.
I:331;2220;This movie will make you keep your eyes afixed to the screen in pure delight!
I:331;2221;I would recommend checking it out .
I:331;2222;You know, I like the films of Steven Spielberg.
I:331;2223;I just prefer the ones with that extra bit of magic (i. e. the Back To The Future trilogy, the Indiana Jones trilogy).
I:331;2224;this movie has definitely been directed for today's audiences, and in that case, it has accomplished the task.
I:331;2225;Steven Spielberg has done a great job, as have the actors and crew.
I:331;2226;war Of The Worlds (2005) is an exciting film and a worthy remake.
I:331;2227;well, after seeing three unsucessful attempts to bring WOTW to life properly, I finally found the ideal visual rendition here.
I:331;2228;Although nice enough as it is, I always felt somewhat underwhelmed by it, even as a kid.
I:331;2229;This Dark Horse rendition is the perfect story board for the next remake.
I:331;2230;The whole novel is VERY well drawn out, and the scenes with the tripods, and the 'pods themselves, are just right.
I:331;2231;i'm sure any compentent studio could follow this nicely drawn template and finally make the first.
I:331;2232;It seems an odd choice for Spielberg to revive the old Welles' story for his newest film epic, but it was a film worth seeing.
I:331;2233;Anyway, Spielberg has turned to sci.
I:331;2234;"the ""miraculous"" survival of the delinquent turned hero (!!!)"
I:331;2235;ending really take away from the overall enjoyment.
I:331;2236;for a good adaptation of H. g. Wells, check out both versions (the old and the new) of The Time Machine!No masterpiece here.
I:331;2237;My son LOVES this movie!
I:331;2238;The Spielberg art has inspired him to draw his own ideas and create some great art.
I:331;2239;The first emergence of the Tripods is one of the best scenes of the year and really really scary.
I:331;2240;The heat rays are great and I loved watching the people get vaporized, I had a lump in my throat when it was happening so don't eat anything before the move.
I:331;2241;The basemant scene with Tim Robbins, Cruise and Fanning is pretty intense as well.
I:331;2242;The alien probe is creppy and cool looking.
I:331;2243;The ending does come quite quick, kind of unexpectedly.
I:331;2244;This is a must see.
I:331;2245;This is a great movie if you just want to stare at a screen and escape reality for a couple of hours.
I:331;2246;Could he at least have explained that to us?So, it's a very entertaining movie that missed its chance to be great.
I:331;2247;The 1950's George Pal version is still the classic.
I:331;2248;As for the little girl, smart I like, not smart.
I:331;2249;Wow, this was a let down.
I:331;2250;Went right out and bought it thinking it was going to be more like what the commercials led it to be.
I:331;2251;We all thought it was going to be more of us fighting the aliens or something more.
I:331;2252;"Interesting behind the scenes materials and the ""how."
I:331;2253;"it"" vignettes will satisfy the inner geek in you."
I:331;2254;The movie is good to view once or twice for the special effects only.
I:331;2255;Cruise just proves again he can play in any movie.
I:331;2256;This is a great thriller with all kinds of surprises, twists and turns.
I:331;2257;I like this movie so much I had to see it again.
I:331;2258;Best graphics in the world.
I:331;2259;All of you who didn't like this movie just shut up and keep it to your self because I don't want to hear you.
I:331;2260;I own the original War of The Worlds anI am happy to say that this version is very good as well.
I:331;2261;I haven't watched it yet but I love film extras!
I:331;2262;I'm a great fan of science fiction movies, and I actually like Tom Cruise movies.
I:331;2263;I thought this would be a perfect pairing of genre and actor for me.
I:331;2264;It's even based on a story by H. G. Welles, who was an amazing writer.
I:331;2265;first, I'll talk about what the movie did well.
I:331;2266;The family dynamics were done well.
I:331;2267;and everybody goes walking towards it to take a look.
I:331;2268;The worker talks with them, keeps them safe, is sharing his food and water.
I:331;2269;That bothered me a great deal.
I:331;2270;It took out cars, TVs, lights, house phone, cell phones, even watches.
I:331;2271;It is amazing to me that Spielburg focussed so much on the special effects and flash in this movie, when he has shown elsewhere that he is *capable* of the actual plotline and characters, if he only cares enough to take the time.
I:331;2272;The new War of the Worlds is extremely impressive.
I:331;2273;The special effects are the best I have seen in any movie.
I:331;2274;Tom Cruise is a great actor.
I:331;2275;With the combination of superlative special effects, directing, sound, and acting, you feel every emotion that Tom Cruise's character feels.
I:331;2276;war of the Worlds is best viewed on the biggest screen possible, with surround sound.
I:331;2277;If I think his film is entertaining (Mission Impossible Series).
I:331;2278;I also liked that they did not totally try to reinvent what the ships looked like.
I:331;2279;two things that made me give this film a two star rating:1 .
I:331;2280;His best moment came when he had to choose between his equally irresponsible son and his daughter who about to be taken by strangers who thought she was alone.
I:331;2281;That moment of choice was well done by Cruise.
I:331;2282;but it was entertaining while it lasted.
I:331;2283;It kept me on the edge of my seat!
I:331;2284;of course this movie has flaws, all movies do, even great movies like this one.
I:331;2285;"other than what I've mentioned, this movie is absolutely riveting
I:331;2286;darkly beautiful and incredibly creepy.
I:331;2287;John Williams' score struck just the right notes of restraint and terror in all the right places.
I:331;2288;by means of this movie, Speilberg proves that he is still one of the masters.
I:331;2289;His movie doesn't just dazzle you with its special effects, it terrifies you with them.
I:331;2290;He kept the best of all three and added his own holocaust.
I:331;2291;In my opinion, this is the best sci.
I:331;2292;can Spielberg play our emotions like the virtuoso he is?
I:331;2293;If you like being bummed out, War of the Worlds is guaranteed to do the trick.
I:331;2294;like his masterpiece, A. i., War of the Worlds will put you through the emotional wringer.
I:331;2295;Unlike that beautifully sad fable, War of the Worlds niether inspires or rewards.
I:331;2296;If that's your cup of tea, enjoy.
I:331;2297;I actually liked this movie enough to give it 4 stars.
I:331;2298;The fx are excellent and the pace keeps up quite well.
I:331;2299;while all hail Spielberg as a modern master of film, I feel that his recent explorations of dark.
I:331;2300;Sometimes it's fun to sit all alone .
I:331;2301;i loved this movie for exactly what it was.
I:331;2302;I never read the book, and it's been over 20 years since I saw the original.
I:331;2303;I enjoyed the film a lot.
I:331;2304;i have thought a great deal about how this film was made.
I:331;2305;dakkota Fanning was the saving grace of this film.
I:331;2306;I enjoyed this remake of the original, despite having a sort of nostalgia for Gene Barry's professorial role in the first one.
I:331;2307;ray like ships in the first movie with their meson matter disintegration rays were possibly the coolest special effect ever in a sci.
I:331;2308;But the awesome tripods in this movie are more faithful to the original book, and so I give Spielberg credit for that.
I:331;2309;i've read several of Wells's books but unfortunately have only read portions of this one, so I can't comment any further on how faithful it is to the original concept, but overall this seemed a dramatic, suspenseful, and scary rendition of the classic sci.
I:331;2310;But it's a legitimate question given our own, well, unabashedly brutal and bloody history.
I:331;2311;some of the scenes are reprised almost exactly from the original, so I thought I would compare them a bit.
I:331;2312;the scene in the house, though, is pretty close to the original, although with an extra character played by Tim Robbins thrown in to complicate matters.
I:331;2313;He's a little off his rocker, but at first seems nice enough.
I:331;2314;All in all, a great remake, but with one minor, and a major, quip.
I:331;2315;First the minor one: the first hour is the best, during which the aliens land and the tripods break out and start roaming the countryside, with devastating effects.
I:331;2316;by the way, a brief note on Wells.
I:331;2317;Today he is mostly remembered for several famous science fiction novels, but Wells published literally hundreds of papers, articles and books during his lifetime including politics, history, and science in addition to fiction, and in his day Wells was considered a universal genius.
I:331;2318;wells was also basically the mentor of the famous American science fiction writer, Robert A. Heinlein.
I:331;2319;He was a great admirer of Wells (he once wrote Wells was the greatest science.
I:331;2320;The few people who have major speaking parts in Boston actually have good Bostonian accents.
I:331;2321;sure, there are moments when it works with a vengeance.
I:331;2322;Their technology is creaky and retro, which might be interesting in a period piece I suppose.
I:331;2323;"Probably true, but a small and rather obvious truth to carry $200 million of ""entertainment."""
I:331;2324;literate altruist (with absolutely no indication that it's a permanent change).
I:331;2325;"This really is ""Steven Spielberg puts Signs, War of the Worlds, and Independence Day in a blender, and spits out a pastiche that doesn't even come close to good movie."
I:331;2326;"making, let alone his best."""
I:331;2327;Resist that base temptation if you can, particularly for an unredeeming spectacle like this one.
I:331;2328;It really leaves you wanting in the end.
I:331;2329;Tom Cruise' character is a (really good) mechanic, so I keep thinking he will find a way into one of the bots and take control and start blasting the other bots but this never happens.
I:331;2330;It was wonderful to see the machines as Wells described them (now that it is possible to create these effects).
I:331;2331;but special effects and sound were damn great, the intro is damn cool.
I:331;2332;I started out really enjoying this movie.
I:331;2333;And when the invansion started the special effects of the building being blown up were phenomenal.
I:331;2334;Show me an interesting character with a unique vision, or something.
I:331;2335;It is all just helter skelter and on par with a high.
I:331;2336;Much scarier than the 1953 version with Gene Barry, the film manages to keep escalating the tension either in scenes of epic urban demolition, or claustrophic games of hide.
I:331;2337;"The acting is actually good in this film
I:331;2338;But Dakota Fanning steals the show.
I:331;2339;"And unlike the original, Spielberg was able to show us the tripods, the retaining baskets and the growth of the ""red weed."""
I:331;2340;Which anyone who read the books will really enjoyed.
I:331;2341;And of course the CGI effects are excellent.
I:331;2342;and the movie is fun to watch.
I:331;2343;spielberg does a good job showing the earth being invaded from a singles man point of view as was intended.
I:331;2344;But if you pay attention they will explain the ending in the narrative.
I:331;2345;this was a great movie it had alot of action through outi like better then the 1953 versionA movie the whole family would enjoy
I:331;2346;Despite being a tom cruise movie with Mr. Spielberg at the helm this is a good movie.
I:331;2347;i've read the book and always loved an 'alien invasion' story but I was afraid that this would become a 'how long until the next explosion' kind of film.
I:331;2348;From Wells' original story, the Orson Wells adaptation, the George Pal film and Jeff Wayne's musical, I have enjoyed them all.
I:331;2349;Okay, if they can do that, they win.
I:331;2350;The people waiting at the train station only to watch stunned as it races by empty and on fire is also a good Spielberg.
I:331;2351;The tripods themselves were beautifully done, terrifying and fascinating at the same time, especially the thunderous fog.
I:331;2352;Very surprised to see many think this is a good movie.
I:331;2353;the sound effects are excellent (high.
I:331;2354;Spielberg is one of the most talented directors of all time and even in this movie it shows, with awesome set pieces of an alien invasion of Earth.
I:331;2355;when they think the time is right.
I:331;2356;All I wonder is, what would John Milius have done with the material.
I:331;2357;Wake up people!I loved the aliens machines, very cool!
I:331;2358;I'll probably see the film again.
I:331;2359;"I love the ""You figure it out"" danger/adventure movies because a person needs to start thinking when danger is all around."
I:331;2360;This was a great looking film:* Superb special effects, especially when crowds of people were getting zapped by the tripods.
I:331;2361;* The acting was superb all the way around.
I:331;2362;I promise, it's a quick, engrossing read.
I:331;2363;The book is far better than either of the movies and takes place in England at the turn of the 20th century.
I:331;2364;"It's an excellent story!Sorry Tom, Katie's film ""Batman Begins"" was far better than this eye candy mounted on shakey legs."
I:331;2365;Steven Spielberg has been known to paint a pretty picture when it comes to aliens.
I:331;2366;based on the H. g. Wells novel, Spielberg gives us the dangerous aliens this time around.
I:331;2367;Cruise races to the spot where it hit and from that location a spaceship rises and begins vaporizing the people of New York.
I:331;2368;Along the way they encounter thousands of people fleeing the city and heading somewhere, anywhere.
I:331;2369;the usual line of fighting between people trying to escape, all being killed off by aliens and by their own mad behavior as they go comes up while Cruise does his best to keep his family together.
I:331;2370;It's a heartbreaking moment that sticks with you.
I:331;2371;the story here is basic at best.
I:331;2372;It's about big budget special effects and this film delivers on all counts.
I:331;2373;the look of the spaceships is classic Wells with tripod aliens taking the lead.
I:331;2374;And the damage and destruction that they do is done so well that you believe all of the sights you are witness to.
I:331;2375;on the whole this is one movie that delivers the goods.
I:331;2376;It's a tale that captures the imagination and transposes it to the big screen, keeping the original tale intact.
I:331;2377;It lives up to the previous efforts made as well as the radio play.
I:331;2378;And in that believability lays the one thing that makes this movie worth seeing.
I:331;2379;The heat ray is a kind of microwave device which is tuned to resonate specifically with human DNA.
I:331;2380;Well the reason is that it is important to the Martians that we begin to see that we are being vaporized by superior beings, who are working us over good and solid by killer cylindrical robots.
I:331;2381;I have to say that I was mildly entertained by the movie.
I:331;2382;From a new or unknown director this would'nt have been such a big deal but for a guy like Spielberg this was pretty surprising.
I:331;2383;It did have great effects and the movie moved along quickly, except for the Tim Robbins scene.
I:331;2384;Bottom line is if you can take it for what it's worth and not spend any money on it you can enjoy the movie to a certain degree.
I:331;2385;H. g. Wells is a tough act to follow, but Spielberg makes his own version and he makes it work.
I:331;2386;Towing his teenage son and preteen daughter along for the trip to Boston to see Mom and escape the aliens is a thrill ride that's not always pleasant.
I:331;2387;"Sometimes the film eerily represents scenes from ""Schindler's List"" with the sooty sky and the tattered clothing scraps floating in the air."
I:331;2388;Spielberg's effects are, of course, top notch and the dialogue fits very well without any false moves or insincere comments.
I:331;2389;The basement scene with Tim Robbins is particularly harrowing with a surprise turn.
I:331;2390;"disc edition, there are ten featurettes that are impressive, dealing with ""making of"" situations."
I:331;2391;In a lot of ways I believe that today is the true golden age of science fiction films.
I:331;2392;"Not only are great new works like ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" available, but Hollywood is revisiting old classics like this one."
I:331;2393;Spielberg puts forth a classic work of science fiction in a way the filmmakers of 1953 could only dream.
I:331;2394;This is a great looking film, and the special effects are on par with any movie out there.
I:331;2395;"It was a very powerful scene
I:331;2396;"another element that was enjoyable in this film was the shift from the floating craft of the 1953 film to the ""tripods"" that matched the described craft from the book."
I:331;2397;The movie shifts between the retro look that matches the book, to the modern aspects of war fighting.
I:331;2398;This it accomplishes quite well, like I said, it's a good looking film.
I:331;2399;Tom Cruise is what he always is.
I:331;2400;Dakota Fanning plays the young daughter of Mr. Cruise's character, and does so well.
I:331;2401;Have your popcorn in hand, and let you rational mind wander for awhile.
I:331;2402;These effects are truly stunning and carry the viewer's interest as far as special effects can do so.
I:331;2403;In the 1954 film, the audience was treated to a larger perspective: military leaders acted as a chorus, allowing the audience to see the invaders in more than one perspective.
I:331;2404;For those who prefer the philosophy of Wells included on film, I recommend a second look at Gene Barry's version who knew how to involve the audience in the end of days.
I:331;2405;Some aspects of this movie are rather refreshing, I found.
I:331;2406;That such a superior intelligence, which has been planning its invasion for so long, would overlook the obvious danger of alien microbes is of course silly, and is the crucial weakness in the storyline, which it shares with Wells's original.
I:331;2407;Why?So what's the good news?
I:331;2408;Mainly, that the special effects are generally first rate.
I:331;2409;but it's all done with gusto, and we get some signature Steven Spielberg weird stormy skies to boot.
I:331;2410;The film does contain a few images that are truly memorable, and the huge size of the tripods is believably rendered .
I:331;2411;Tom Cruise does steer clear of his pretty boy imago and is fairly convincing as the somewhat dysfunctional father who suddenly actually has to take care of his brood.
I:331;2412;If you love special effects you may love this movie.
I:331;2413;i loved the original movie.
I:331;2414;They can simply do things we cant.
I:331;2415;this film is has great acting, directing, and the best special effects I have ever seen.
I:331;2416;The first appearence of the Tripods is one the most intense scenes I have seen in a damn long time.
I:331;2417;if you dont like it, thats fine, Im simply saying just open up your minds a little and injoy it for what it is.
I:331;2418;Great special effects as you'd expect.
I:331;2419;Had to watch it twice to catch everything.
I:331;2420;If you have seen the Gene Barry version, it's worth watching to compare.
I:331;2421;Four stars for great effects.
I:331;2422;Just classic Speilburg, I loved it.
I:331;2423;galleries of design artwork and production photos, and the film's theatrical trailers.
I:331;2424;looks so sweet, I can't wait.
I:331;2425;"he is able to deliver great movies as ""Jaws"" (1975) and ""Saving Private Ryan"" (1998)
I:331;2426;"well ""War of the Worlds"" (2005) is nearer to the last mentioned movies, that is to say: not at par with his best."
I:331;2427;special effects are very good, production is high budgeted, and play acting is good.
I:331;2428;ray Ferrier is quite obtuse, insensible to his ex.
I:331;2429;"I've seen her acting in ""Man on Fire"" (2004) and I was delighted."
I:331;2430;Well in this movie she's better!
I:331;2431;"What first come to my mind to define her performance is: ""she acts naturally"" (in an unnatural background)."
I:331;2432;tom Cruise is solid in his performance.
I:331;2433;Since, Peter Jackson made The Lord Of The Rings, Lucas show us the real face of lord Vader, Ridley Scott made the ultimate peplum ever ( Don't try to make another one by the way, it's a waste of time Gladiator is the the best and the last), but It's the first time that a movie take me inside the theatre screen.
I:331;2434;A legendary novel, great actors, one of the best director of all time, an amazing job is done with WAR OF THE WORLDS.
I:331;2435;i'm sorry but it's one of the best movie ever made since and for a long time.
I:331;2436;in spite of his real world antics, Tom Cruise does not ruin this film and he does a surprisingly good job as the lead.
I:331;2437;"This film may not please those expecting ""Independence Day"" on steroids, but it is a pure sci."
I:331;2438;Spielberg presents the alien attack in all its visceral glory, and he resists the temptation to show famous landmarks or New York City being destroyed.
I:331;2439;The strength of this approach is that the audience sees the war as it would be seen by the average Joe in the street instead of from the perspective of the president or a member of the military.
I:331;2440;Cruise is an excellent actor when he sticks to fictional subjects other than Scientology, and Dakota Fanning is far superior to 99.9% of all actresses in Hollywood.
I:331;2441;'War of the Worlds' is one of the classic Science Fiction stories that has been transformed into the most famous of all radioplays, a 1953 movie and many more in many languages.
I:331;2442;steven Spielberg has now taken his turn for interpretation, and 50 years after the first movie this one is certainly not bad.
I:331;2443;But it will never be a classic.
I:331;2444;Steven Spielberg creates a gem by giving us a high.
I:331;2445;Special guest appearances by Gene Barry and Ann Robinson from the 1953 classic film.
I:331;2446;Great special effects by ILM.
I:331;2447;Great musical score by John Williams.
I:331;2448;This movie is really good.
I:331;2449;the ending was really good.
I:331;2450;I was really surprised about how good this movie turned out.
I:331;2451;it is totally worth a 5 star rating this is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.
I:331;2452;I was really looking forward to this movie, with all the secrecy and stunning trailors, but didnt get a chance to see it in the theaters.
I:331;2453;Tom Cruise does a decent job with his character pulling off the right attitude and presence that was called for, and the aliens and their vehicles were well done.
I:331;2454;Now you have a good movie!
I:331;2455;If you have read any of my previous reviews, then you know that I believe Steven Speilberg to be the most gifted director in the world.
I:331;2456;this is just another beautiful film by an awesome director.
I:331;2457;be entranced, enjoy the intensity, this is Spielberg.
I:331;2458;I got three answers to this, after thinking it was definitely Sydney.
I:331;2459;I had to look up an atlas, but it's definitely Canberra.
I:331;2460;But I actually liked both stars in this .
I:331;2461;I certainly would have done.
I:331;2462;But the way he acts towards his little sister, kinda makes up for that.
I:331;2463;Uh huh, yeah, get over it.
I:331;2464;There's a lot of imagery used from real life, 9/11, filmed with the camera set at a person's eye.
I:331;2465;I found it extremely freaky, after seeing survivors from 9/11 coming out covered in white dust, then seeing Tom in the same situation.
I:331;2466;I got shivers up my spine.
I:331;2467;"it takes a lot for you to believe that Tom's character is an ""Average Joe""."
I:331;2468;Steven Spielberg is a master of evoking moods.
I:331;2469;Spielberg is still highly effective at inspiring in us whatever emotion he wishes to create, but here that is really all that he accomplishes.
I:331;2470;"star and he will triumph because he gets twenty million a picture and cannot die."""
I:331;2471;Her eyes are still impressively communicative: she can convey wide.
I:331;2472;One of the film's most chilling moments comes when Harlan jeopardizes Rachel's safety, and Ray must deal with him in what one suspects (but never shown) is a very unpleasant manner.
I:331;2473;The mood of the movie, as I said before, is evoked very, very well, as one would expect from a master like Spielberg, who knows how to concoct an emotion.
I:331;2474;"Herbie: Fully Loaded and ""Fantastic Four"" spring to mind ."
I:331;2475;in fact, it's actually GOOD.
I:331;2476;like creatures with tentacles emerge from the ground and start attacking people!
I:331;2477;(It sounds kind of ridiculous, but the special effects are outstanding.)
I:331;2478;It's amazing to me that Ray and his kids were able to hold onto their stolen van for so long: they emerged from a burning house to find that the aliens had shot down airplanes that crash.
I:331;2479;however, in spite of all that, I was very impressed with this film.
I:331;2480;The cast was great, the story was good, and the effects were AMAZING.
I:331;2481;I was completely prepared to hate this movie, but I really liked it.
I:331;2482;The alien ships look great and the sound effects were just as good.
I:331;2483;That's the fun of seeing it in a movie theater.
I:331;2484;It may be awful to say but it sure was fun to see the aliens zap everything in their paths.
I:331;2485;Spielberg resisted the urge (for the most part) to put his usual happy spin on the ball and took us from one terrifying moment to the next.
I:331;2486;organisms and germs that we have on this planet.
I:331;2487;I really like the difference between this movie and the original.You can appreciate the reason the aliens could not survive.
I:331;2488;the action was tense and powerful .
I:331;2489;the threat to survival was scary but the ending was great.
I:331;2490;The story sounds so amazing.
I:331;2491;I also look forward to read the book.
I:331;2492;I love the director Steven Spielberg.
I:331;2493;His movies are all amazing.
I:331;2494;And of course I love Tom Cruise.
I:331;2495;He looks so brilliant in this movies.
I:331;2496;I love to see him in an action movie.
I:331;2497;"I have to say ""Amazing cast""."
I:331;2498;And this movie is a Cruise/Spielberg love.
I:331;2499;Steven Spielberg's adaptation of HG Wells' sci.
I:331;2500;"fi novel ""The War of the Worlds"" starring Tom Cruise is pretty enjoyable."
I:331;2501;Cool special effects, a very dark, foreboding atmosphere and a solid performance from Cruise as an everyman trying to stay alive in the midst of human suffering and tragedy brought on by the evil invaders from beyond make this a fun ride.
I:331;2502;Speilberg has done a superb job making this movie which is highly original from the 1953 version.
I:331;2503;there are some real touching and heart wrenching scenes especially when his young daughter is witnessing the horrors of people being vaporized and hungry mobs attacking their car.
I:331;2504;the special effects are phenomenal and the story grips you from start to finish.
I:331;2505;Fun, Fast remake of the original has some pretty good moments, especially when the machines attack.
I:331;2506;robbins is pretty much miscast.
I:331;2507;Steven Spielberg's take on the classic H. g. Wells novel certainly has some awesome special effects and captures the terror of the novel and its 1953 version as well.
I:331;2508;Cruise, a moderately convincing actor, doesn't seem quite credible in this role, and it could be his persona has become so engrained in our minds that it's difficult to see him in this fatherly role.
I:331;2509;The wonderfully talented Dakota Fanning, however, does a beautiful job in conveying the horror she is forced to witness as aliens annihilate most of the planet.
I:331;2510;While thankfully not a gorefest, the movie has some pretty terrifying moments and just imagining what fate earthlings are meeting is frightening in its own right.
I:331;2511;Spielberg shows us what a talented filmmaker he continues to be and the production values are nearly perfect.
I:331;2512;oK 18 words are required so what more do you want me to say the movie is a good remake and blah blah blah
I:331;2513;I reserved judgment, alternately thrilled that Steven Spielberg was helming the project and concerned that Tom Cruise was the lead actor.
I:331;2514;Each incarnation differs from its predecessor in important ways.
I:331;2515;Whether the Marians invade the Thames or Grover Mills, New Jersey, the story of foreign invaders is always relevant.
I:331;2516;Then the lightning storms start, without any thunder at all, and Ray's amusement at the whole event slowly transforms to terror.
I:331;2517;The lightning bolts are actually alien pilots touching down from space, landing in war machines buried thousands of years ago.
I:331;2518;Ray knows from the outset that owning a functioning car after an EMP is a valuable find and he intends to protect it and his family with a revolver.
I:331;2519;But as Spielberg deftly portrays, the power of the gun is only in the hands of whoever holds it at the moment.
I:331;2520;And who holds a gun can change very quickly.
I:331;2521;In this movie, Cruise provides a fine performance as a self.
I:331;2522;dakota Fanning is at her finest here, convincingly playing an articulate little girl who desperately needs her father when he's got so many other things to worry about.
I:331;2523;It's much closer to the radio play in that it's a survival horror.
I:331;2524;Humans should definitely see this movie, if only as a reminder of our own vulnerability, both physically and mentally.
I:331;2525;Intelligent rabbits may want to give it a pass.
I:331;2526;There are many excellent, gripping (not to say nerve.
I:331;2527;The special effects actually contribute to the story for a change, especially the lightning at the beginning.
I:331;2528;And Spielberg, naturally, throws in numerous references to his own earlier films, as well as to the 1953 version and to the book.
I:331;2529;be resister in the cellar (a composite of several characters from Wells's book), does a very good job (as always).
I:331;2530;But Dakota Fanning, who is an amazingly mature actress for eleven years old, unequivocally steals the show.
I:331;2531;fi or Steven Spielberg, Tom Cruise, or Dakota Fanning because with all of this together in one film you have got your self a real croud pleaser.
I:331;2532;I understand that Tom Cruise is in this and anything from Spielberg has got to be good.
I:331;2533;War of the Worlds with Tom Cruise delivers what it promised.
I:331;2534;A solid alien invasion story which follows a father, a dead.
I:331;2535;the special feature about designing the tripods and the aliens was interesting but the movie easily stands all by itself.
I:331;2536;His blue collar job is enough to give him a very modest house in an OK neighborhood.
I:331;2537;"speilberg set out to create the ""event movie"" of the summer, and is somewhat successful."
I:331;2538;War of the Worlds provides almost non.
I:331;2539;stop action and amazing special effects.
I:331;2540;The story has been brought to modern times, but stays faithful otherwise to the source material.
I:331;2541;Of course, Ray gets up close and personal with some of the aliens, so there is plenty of action.
I:331;2542;The weakest point of the movie is the ending, but to be fair, it is true to the novel.
I:331;2543;War of the Worlds pretty much delivers everything you would expect going in, and is a very entertaining summer movie.
I:331;2544;If you are looking for an entertaining popcorn movie, this is a good bet.
I:331;2545;I've been a fan of the original ever since I was a little kid and this movie did not disappoint.
I:331;2546;Dakota Fanning is an amazing little cutie.
I:331;2547;Tom Cruise puts on a great performance here and the aliens were beyond believable.
I:331;2548;Creepier than the original, and I'm an old man now.
I:331;2549;The celebrated author H. g. Wells was one of humanity's most gifted visionaries, long before his time.
I:331;2550;Not only was he successful in launching a entirely new genre in science fiction writing with the development of the alien invasion premise, he also brought to the forefront the frightening prospect of war and its impact on society as a whole.
I:331;2551;Though a majority of his works can and should be treated as nothing more then pure imaginative storytelling, Wells included in a few of his writings social commentaries about modern society that are worth mentioning.
I:331;2552;Steven Spielberg is at his directing best with War of the Worlds, doubtlessly his most graphic pictorial since his 1998 epic war drama Saving Private Ryan, and Cruise brings honest emotional integrity to the family story arch of the film.
I:331;2553;up project they had in mind, or at least audiences did, particularly for the creative duo behind the brilliantly orchestrated Minority Report.
I:331;2554;Cruise's impacting performance is what makes War of the Worlds as emotionally poignant as it is and thanks to Dakota Fanning this fermentation is made even more believable.
I:331;2555;Dakota Fanning's Rachel Ferrier brings the right level of emotional intensity required for Ray Ferrier to make the incredible transformation from a juvenile playboy to the mature and self.
I:331;2556;There exists however a complication involving Justin Chatwin's character, Robbie Ferrier, the smart.
I:331;2557;alecky and rebellious, though certainly more mature at times, son of Tom Cruise's character.
I:331;2558;On the contrary, he works perfectly well in the role.
I:331;2559;Nonetheless, the originative and visually stunning first half saves the film from whatever shortcomings its weaker second half, particularly its conclusion, may deliver.
I:331;2560;This can also be proudly said of the British as well in the aftermath of the blitz bombings.
I:331;2561;fiction action drama, War of the Worlds maintains its distinctive Spielberg style which has made his films so successful and enduring over the decades and bolsters an astonishing set of five.
I:331;2562;hundred special effects shots which alone are worth the price of admission.
I:331;2563;The plot was just great.
I:331;2564;A remake in 2 years with good actors and I'd give it 5 stars if it kept the same storyline.
I:331;2565;Fun, Fast remake of the original has some pretty good moments, especially when the machines attack.
I:331;2566;robbins is pretty much miscast.
I:331;2567;It's a good movie and well worth seeing, but the whole concept of tripods rather than the original flying machines was taken from a book written 35 years ago.
I:331;2568;Trust me it will be a much more rewarding experience.
I:331;2569;Tom is at his best in acting, he makes the whole thing bigger better and real.
I:331;2570;I've watched this movie about 6 times since I bought it, its very rewatchable!
I:331;2571;A great addition to any video library.
I:331;2572;I give it ten stars.
I:331;2573;That doom and helplessness imparts a scary effect that makes this movie so perfect.
I:331;2574;And I'm sure it will make a gazillion more than that.
I:331;2575;The film views the catastrophic events through the eyes of Cruise.
I:331;2576;dimensional characters and lots of special effects.
I:331;2577;there were some wonderful f/x moments, and a great scene where Cruise's character had the only working car around for miles and was mobbed by a crazy group of survivors.
I:331;2578;I give it 3/5, because from Spielberg, we should always expect more.
I:331;2579;"Although the movie was intentionally shot with some graininess to give it a ""gritty"" look and feel, the Blu."
I:331;2580;ray presentation is the absolutely amazing DTS soundtrack.
I:331;2581;"ray with a better transfer in the future as ""War of the Worlds"" is a spectacular movie."
I:331;2582;the earlier version was by far more satisfying.
I:331;2583;"The part where Tom Cruise was comforting his ""daughter"" and in the background there was the same strange guy sharpening his axe was really funny."
I:331;2584;The ending especially, where Tom finally comes to Boston, to find his son by some mistery alive and well.
I:331;2585;thank you for your time,mirage.
I:331;2586;This version of the story also takes inspiration from Orson Welles' famous 1938 radio play and the iconic 1953 film adaptation.
I:331;2587;An eerie lightning storm hits his New Jersey town and mysteriously knocks out all electrical devices in the area.
I:331;2588;but I wonder why Steven Spielberg let them pass.
I:331;2589;"This ""War of the Worlds"" is a monster movie in the tradition of ""Godzilla"" and the like: Big, powerful invaders are wreaking havoc and we never know their motivation."
I:331;2590;The plot is that simple, and the film works well and entertains as far as it goes.
I:331;2591;Good science fiction is always allegory.
I:331;2592;Director Steven Spielberg and several visual effects and animation designers explain the concepts behind the Tripods and aliens and how these creatures were created on film.
I:331;2593;Subtitles for the film are available in English, French, and Spanish.
I:331;2594;Dubbing is available in French.
I:331;2595;I liked this one because it showed a great story of good overcoming evil.
I:331;2596;overall, the acting was not bad, the cinematography was great, and the scenes looked realistic.
I:331;2597;The characters, for the most part, were pretty well developed.
I:331;2598;I think it's worth taking a look at.
I:331;2599;This movie should be played loud and on the big screen for full effect.
I:331;2600;this is one movie you could watch 10 times andstill love it.
I:331;2601;I am a big fan of Steven Spielberg and sci fi movies in general.
I:331;2602;She immediately takes issue with the condition and cleanliness of his home.
I:331;2603;Chatwin provides a great source of tension as a teenage boy using anger to deal with his fathers absence.
I:331;2604;But he soon finds a new source for his anger in the aliens.
I:331;2605;All of the actors do a fine job, the characters are very interesting.
I:331;2606;And Steven Spielberg skillfully remixes some dialogue from the 100 year old classic book to the present time.
I:331;2607;the special effects as you may imagine with a Spielberg movie are amazing.
I:331;2608;Spielberg has taken a great book, read by countless millions, updated it nicely and faithfully put it onto film without regard for his ego.
I:331;2609;It's more about the vision and greatness of HG Wells than Spielberg and he knows that.
I:331;2610;The theatrical trailer made this film very enticing.
I:331;2611;I went to see this movie alone, anticipating a lot of action, suspense, scares, thrills, everything you could want in a movie.
I:331;2612;I love Steven Spielberg films, because he seems to have a recipe that makes most of his movies work quite well.
I:331;2613;These scenes are incredibly intense, and when we see the aliens trying to hunt down Ogilvy, Ray, and Rachel, it's almost unbearable to watch.
I:331;2614;The last shot of the film is strong, as we have a renewed sense of respect for Ray, who now seems to care a lot more than he did in the beginning, and there's a renewed hope for the human race as Rachel runs into the arms of her mother.
I:331;2615;the special effects in the film are top.
I:331;2616;"notch
I:331;2617;We are used to seeing Cruise play good guys, but like his superb role in Collateral, we see a side we haven't seen.
I:331;2618;and it works to great effect.
I:331;2619;Dakota Fanning is starting to catch fire too, and she certainly relishes her on.
I:331;2620;screen time with a big performance.
I:331;2621;"we believe the fear, the danger, the courage these people are feeling
I:331;2622;All throughout the film, Morgan Freeman narrates the movie's beginning and the movie's end, and I thought it was a nice touch to add such an element and presence to a big, gargantuan blockbuster film.
I:331;2623;disc set is a must.
I:331;2624;it just delivers the goods for those of us who feel that, at times, special editions don't give us enough.
I:331;2625;so if you're a big fan of sci.
I:331;2626;fi, action, even adventure movies, you are absolutely going to love WAR OF THE WORLDS.
I:331;2627;Steven Spielberg remains one of the most interesting, complex, and superb directors of our time.
I:331;2628;He encapsulates H. g. Wells vision so well and the cast is solid.
I:331;2629;From start to end, this is an absolutely realistic nightmare about the inevitable.
I:331;2630;"This is ""Jaws,"" ""Jurassic Park"" Spielberg where he hammers the audience with one white."
I:331;2631;Even John Williams chilling score echoes strains from a certain shark flick, sending pulses racing even faster.
I:331;2632;righteous actor who claimed to be an expert on the complexities of the human brain and the real alien presence among us.
I:331;2633;But Cruise does pull off a memorable performance as the deadbeat Ray, perhaps because Ray's boyish attitude toward life mirrors that of Cruise.
I:331;2634;Either way, Cruise does get inside Ray in surprising ways, creating a handful of heart.
I:331;2635;comer Chatwin and the talented.
I:331;2636;but above all, this is Spielberg's film, and once he kicks into high gear, he rarely slows down.
I:331;2637;And one sequence after another are testaments to the amazing digital prowess of ILM, who deliver absolutely astounding special effects.
I:331;2638;like movements of the aliens and their suveillance technology, the ILM team pull out many a pixelated miracle in bringing the marauding attackers to life.
I:331;2639;Nonetheless, you will be hard pressed to find an equal this summer to the kind of expert thrills and jolts provided so exuberantly by Spielberg and his gifted cast and crew.
I:331;2640;Spielberg If you want to make a good movie stick with that idea.
I:331;2641;i did give it two stars.
I:331;2642;it had some very good suspenseful action in it.
I:331;2643;Really a good two and a half star.
I:331;2644;a good background and buildup.
I:331;2645;"along the way his naive, but to his credit, somewhat heroic son charges off because he ""has to see"" a big battle between the aliens and the military."
I:331;2646;wife and miraculously find that not only are they all still alive in a primary.
I:331;2647;but somehow his son managed to dance his way through the middle of that huge battle I told you about earler, makes it all the way to Boston by himself, and was already hanging out with Mom.
I:331;2648;That was an excellent film.
I:331;2649;i am conflicted about this since usually remaining true to the original is a good thing to do.
I:331;2650;But Spielberg takes enough latitude with everything else so maybe he should have changed this part into something a little more intriguing.
I:331;2651;check out the movie for the special effects and you will probably enjoy yourself.
I:331;2652;I've always loved good, well.
I:331;2653;"Even though ""most"" people know the ending (I'm assuming my generation.50+), I marveled how movies have come this far to make it so believable."
I:331;2654;This new version of the movie appeared like it was actually happening.
I:331;2655;The making of this movie had to be tremendous to do.
I:331;2656;"All the action with the ""alien machines"", etc. is something you will never forget."
I:331;2657;The superb acting of Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning really made this movie even more believable.
I:331;2658;But then I thought about it and about the film, and sometimes I think I may be being to charitable.
I:331;2659;We meet Cruise, a likable everyman who is about to take care of his kids for the weekend.
I:331;2660;Is he the greatest dad in the world?
I:331;2661;Definitely NOT a family movie, this one is a nail.
I:331;2662;although I'm not a Tom Cruise fan, I thought he did a good job.
I:331;2663;He was able to play the selfish single dad made.
I:331;2664;i also loved the end.
I:331;2665;the people I watched this with liked it a lot.
I:331;2666;LOVED the special effects, made me feel like i was actually there.
I:331;2667;First off, the Special FX are some of the best and most realistic to come out in quite some time.
I:331;2668;New Jersey and Boston is breathtaking to say the least.
I:331;2669;Steven Spielberg has crafted a good film here that easily outshines the work he has done in the past few years (Minority Report was good as well) and reminds us all that he still has the stuff when it comes to summer blockbusters.
I:331;2670;A solid 4 out of 5 stars for the sheer visuals and the overall enjoyment value.
I:331;2671;The special effects were absolutely stunning.
I:331;2672;Buildings collapsing, cars flying, ships sinking, the pure adrenaline rush alone will keep you in awe.
I:331;2673;There comes a time in everyone's life, where special effects alone no longer amount to much.
I:331;2674;So in the end, a world event is told in the perspective of one man, who's aim is to get to the safeside of Boston.
I:331;2675;the most interesting moments come when we witness the collapse of not buildings but the moral.
I:331;2676;As humans turn on themselves, and finally squeeze a tear from Tom Cruise.
I:331;2677;apocapylse, the human struggle, the Fight!
I:331;2678;When I went to see this movie in the cinema I was so excited.
I:331;2679;Speilberg does a more than superb job giving us a great fear of these aliens attacking us.
I:331;2680;From the music to the script to the effects, this movie is a surefire blockbuster.
I:331;2681;the acting was great on all counts.
I:331;2682;there are two things in this movie that truly make it great: the special effects w/the aliens and the tension.
I:331;2683;I won't spoil anything but there is a scene in a basement with Tom, Dakota, and Robbins that is so incredibly tense I literally started to shake.
I:331;2684;Spielberg literally brings true edge.
I:331;2685;The aliens have incredible detail though, from a distance, they look like aliens you'd see in a 50's sci.
I:331;2686;This is THE MOVIE of the summer!!
I:331;2687;War of the Worlds is an excellent movie.
I:331;2688;Excellent special effects, acting and storytelling make it one of the best films of this or any other year.
I:331;2689;"I thought it was a good remake until Spielburg decided to show the ""aliens"" in the barn scene."
I:331;2690;Please!Audio was superb, and the special effects were good, IMO.
I:331;2691;In the original War Of The Worlds, the Martians came here inside huge meteors.
I:331;2692;blowing fun that kicks off right into the movie and doesn't stop till the end.
I:331;2693;My son really wanted to see this because he loves Sci.
I:331;2694;So on opening day, we headed to see the movie.
I:331;2695;I wanted to see it too, and I wasn't dissapointed.
I:331;2696;The action is mind boggling, the suspence is powerful, and the whole movie is high.
I:331;2697;Tom Cruise is great in this.
I:331;2698;Speilberg once again overloads his movie with stunning visuals and amazing story.
I:331;2699;In this case, the one with all the features on it.
I:331;2700;It's a great movie, you people needed to loosen up and enjoy the movie for what it is, an action alien invasion movie, not plotless, dumb, stupid ending movie.
I:331;2701;This movie just looks amazing in every category.
I:331;2702;That alone would give you the impression that this film is going to be something special.
I:331;2703;the cast is just an all star A. cast with the great actor Tom Cruise which with him alone will bring in the big bucks, one of the best young actors of our generation, the other one being Haley Joel Osment, Dakota Fanning, Dakota is talented beyong her years and will shock you by her acting skills as well as her maturity.
I:331;2704;Miranda Otto and Tim Robbins are also magnificent as well.
I:331;2705;the Teaser trailers and T. v spots are some of the most amazing trailers I've ever seen and will be sure to attract anyones attention.
I:331;2706;I'm anticipating the Theatrical Trailer which i'm sure will be one of the best Theatrical Trailers in movie history.
I:331;2707;I give 2 1/2 stars the movie was somehow entertaining to watch.
I:331;2708;the effects,suspense,action was all there.
I:331;2709;The title said, war of the world,how come Boston was all peaceful and nothing was destroyed is it because the Boston Red Sox won a world series.
I:331;2710;the ending makes sense in a way!
I:331;2711;I love this movie and have watched it several times.
I:331;2712;Tom Cruise is outstanding in this movie.
I:331;2713;Dakota Fanning was great too.
I:331;2714;Really great for a young actor.
I:331;2715;The storyline was fantastic and it all looked so real.
I:331;2716;2 Thumbs up for this movie.
I:331;2717;I don't know if this movie would work so well on a small screen,but on my 10 foot screen it is just amazing!
I:331;2718;A really good remake from a really great movie maker!
I:331;2719;good: Impressive Special Effect on some scnes.
I:331;2720;where's the fear factor, the adrenaline rush, the heart.
I:331;2721;I can't say that I came to this with high expectations, but in the end this movie provided very little worth watching for except a few good visual effects.
I:331;2722;Cruise is much more entertaining on his Scientology trips.
I:331;2723;The special effects are impressive, the movie is more or less true to the story, although Spielberg got a little creative here and there but hey, it's Spielberg so let's just run with it, right?
I:331;2724;In my opinion, Spielberg is one of the best directors in terms of character development.
I:331;2725;He did make it to Boston though.
I:331;2726;They should sell that place.
I:331;2727;This character should have been developed more as well.
I:331;2728;normally, I accept science fiction films for what they have become.
I:331;2729;Here is a cool website with more information about the movie:[.]
I:331;2730;The War Of The Worlds is a really great story.
I:331;2731;tom Cruise is in it so it has to be good.
I:331;2732;Dakota fanning should be good(belive it or not Fanning is gotton a D. on her acting and personality for her caracther)will be good at her acting.
I:331;2733;"miranda Otto is a very good actress and my mom calles her a ""Cool Lady""because."
I:331;2734;i guess she was acting good and cool in Flight Of The Phoenix.
I:331;2735;But still The War Of The Worlds is a good movie!!!!
I:331;2736;There was nothing believable, amusing, or even scary in this movie.
I:331;2737;I have read quite a number of the reviews here for this movie, with many I agree.
I:331;2738;Lets see the positive side of this movie.
I:331;2739;Strange for Spielberg because he has done work on Apollo 13 and seemed to respect the science.
I:331;2740;This is the kind of movie that is meant for big widescreen, thanks to my kids I now have one.
I:331;2741;Steven Spielberg's mega smash adaptation of War of the Worlds features everything you'd expect from the superstar director: a thrill ride boasting impressive special effects and A. list production.
I:331;2742;"Despite some mega jumps in logic involving the invasion, Spielberg manages to get the most out of his cast (Cruise is surprisingly good here, and Fanning is better) and the visual effects are some of the best to be seen in the past few years, and the way he orchestrates the on screen chaos only adds to his legacy of a master director
I:331;2743;War of the Worlds continues this trend.
I:331;2744;From the beginning to the end I was on the edge of my seat.
I:331;2745;I found myself holding my breath at times.
I:331;2746;"If you like highly charged action, triumph against all odds, and the reinforcement of the resilience of the human spirit, I highly recommend ""War of the Worlds."""
I:331;2747;the film has the opportunity to be brilliant.
I:331;2748;All quite impressive and the kind of stuff that gets you really into the movie.
I:331;2749;from here, suspese is all that keeps it going.
I:331;2750;And the commentary on human nature.
I:331;2751;However if you are not entirely familiar with the original book, you may well enjoy it.
I:331;2752;I only bought the movie (already saw it) so I could enjoy the sound effects.
I:331;2753;Not too thrilled about the overall plot but other than that, splendid film!
I:331;2754;Well you can really savour the fantastic opening half hour with its brooding feeling of malevolence, fear and eventual panic, its quite amazing special effects and its excellent cinema.
I:331;2755;"Gran and Pop perfectly turned out in their Sunday best, with those wonderfully unruffled, knowing smiles, as of course they should be despite the mayhem surrounding them, along with plucky young Robbie, miraculously transported from the front line of military Armageddon, tee shirt intact, just in time to give his Dad a big ""we did it"" hug."
I:331;2756;awesome effects, bathos and side.
I:331;2757;He plays his role of an unwanting father very well throughout the movie.
I:331;2758;but the real beauty in this movie is spieldbergs directing.
I:331;2759;his action scenes and the suspense he puts you in nonstop troughout the entire movie leaves you physically exhausted by the end of the movie.
I:331;2760;the audio and visual effects are unbelievable and bring the movie to life around you.
I:331;2761;good ending seriously, lets come up with something new.
I:331;2762;A BIG part of the story of this film, is it's Genre (updated imaginative 50s sci.
I:331;2763;fi), and watched in that spirit it is a fantastic adventure.
I:331;2764;fi invasion and destruction of society is what the journey on offer here is, and in a Genre way the film's trip does an incredible job of walking down this path while it is on it.
I:331;2765;pod mayhem, it's superb fun, again in a Genre way.
I:331;2766;those of the heart tugging or the wide eyed wonder stories .
I:331;2767;fi ones at that, which i think gives Steven Spielberg another kind of balance as a film maker, Minority Report and AI being other examples of this type which i prefer in his works.
I:331;2768;some of the inspiration in the film comes from the 9/11 event, some times in a curious homage to that also, as well as the holocaust of WW2s in.
I:331;2769;there is the mushiness but it is more in a Genre way or aspect of the story telling rather than being the story telling, and able to be enjoyed in that way with the characters, who are nuanced but not deep, which suits this style of story.
I:331;2770;the film does an amazing job of the War of the Worlds invasion in a modern setting, because when it is bringing this to life, which when it does is superb, the modern setting is lost and it simple becomes a timeless sci.
I:331;2771;this is for the two disc edition which if you like the film, has interesting extras .
I:331;2772;Excellent acting, excellent special effects, excellent suspence and drama.
I:331;2773;i truly admire in this version, that Tom Cruise's character tries to protect the innocence of his 10 year old daughter from all the horrors that is going on around them.
I:331;2774;Takes some of the ideas from the H. g. Wells science fiction classic and uses them to provide the action (and the gore) for a Tom Cruise action romp.
I:331;2775;It held my attention just well enough so I watched the whole movie, but it was not the Wells sci.
I:331;2776;But, I ended up seeing it, and I actually really enjoyed it!As you'd expect, the special effects are incredible.
I:331;2777;But between the creepy, horrific imagery, the terrifying bellowing of the alien destroyers, and the strain of perpetual running, I found myself quite caught up in the story and utterly done in by the suspense.
I:331;2778;sPOILERS AHEAD)As I said, this film comes across as more of a human nature study, and also more generally philosophical.
I:331;2779;If, for example, you like to have everything explained .
I:331;2780;well, we never find out specifically what the aliens are harvesting people for.
I:331;2781;Also, the ending (which I won't spell out) is a great commentary, I think, on the arrogance of mankind.
I:331;2782;"all in all, I thought it was excellent done in terms of special effects and the reality of what a ""space invasion"" could be like."
I:331;2783;Definitely an entertaining, and thought.
I:331;2784;An interesting remake of the old movie.
I:331;2785;The idea of the machines having been here all the time, and then comming out of the ground, very clever !
I:331;2786;The rest of the movie is pure action and will leave you clinging to your arm rest or the person next to you.
I:331;2787;Some hate it, some enjoyed it, some were just on the fence.
I:331;2788;in Spielberg's version the Martian Tripods have shields and are invulnerable to human.
I:331;2789;jets, nukes, and cruise missles.
I:331;2790;with these comparisons, the film is actually quite well.
I:331;2791;the 'protagonist' is played by Tom Cruise in what is surprisingly one of the best performances he's ever given.
I:331;2792;I know, it's strange, but you can actually find a brilliant acting.
I:331;2793;his children, however, come up short.
I:331;2794;They are sleek looking and move with a sort of liquid.
I:331;2795;legged animals on this planet.
I:331;2796;They also, like told in the book, have this chilling horn that announces their coming.
I:331;2797;The sound alone sets up one of the best sci.
I:331;2798;Also, the ending, which keeps true to the Wells' novel, felt as if it came on way too fast.
I:331;2799;But Morgan Freeman's spiels at both beginning and end of the film are delivered perfectly, which helps alleviate the ending somewhat.
I:331;2800;"Cruise delivers a dominating performance, ""Mr. Shawshank"" has a brief cameo, and the special."
I:331;2801;very clean seats, and a guy searching what?
I:331;2802;so you prefer god look like you than the image of the aliens?
I:331;2803;end of my imagination and analysis.
I:331;2804;I went to see this movie for fun.
I:331;2805;Perhaps it is too realistically done, perhaps our world is just forever changed .
I:331;2806;"or ""Schindler's List"" if they sold it as ""this summer's action thrill ride""."
I:331;2807;YOU DO NOT make a fun action movie about the brutalities of war.
I:331;2808;But the skies are actually conjuring more than a lightning storm.
I:331;2809;"despite the astonishing visual effects, War of the Worlds manages to bring no more than a ""satisfactory"" rating on my scale."
I:331;2810;the acting was also satisfactory.
I:331;2811;the music, to me, seemed to come out more on the suspenseful parts, than the parts that featured action.
I:331;2812;"In fact, this movie is like ""Independence Day"" minus everything good about that movie."

I:331;2821;A good action film will supply much.
I:331;2822;everybody should watch this movie.
I:331;2823;If you havent watched this and you like explosions, big sets, load sounds, and CG effects that would turn your face backwards, you have to see this.
I:331;2824;she made that movie into a 4 star.
I:331;2825;maybe overpalyed a little but still a good flick
I:331;2826;I'm overseeing this western on TNT that I think is really good.
I:331;2827;Last time we worked together things turned out pretty well.
I:331;2828;I don't really have any drawn out concepts, but I do have some really good special effects that could be put to use.
I:331;2829;tC: So you want to do something sci.
I:331;2830;And anyway, it'll have both of our names attached to it.
I:331;2831;Well, maybe we should add something else.you know, audiences always love having kids in the movies.
I:331;2832;tC: Oh yeah, she is good.
I:331;2833;But do we really need that good a young actress if we're not focusing on the plot?SS: I think she'll be a good fit.
I:331;2834;You truly are the most powerful man in Hollywood.
I:331;2835;That was a pretty good show, huh?
I:331;2836;War of the Worlds is a very good, scary, entertaining, and thought provoking movie.
I:331;2837;He's a Redsox fan, Cruise a Yankee.
I:331;2838;stuff starts happening world wide.
I:331;2839;Winds blow towards the storm, and lighting hits one spot 26 times in about 10 minutes.

I:331;2841;one father's love for his daughter, played by Dakota Fanning and his son Robbie.
I:331;2842;great story line, great overall theory.
I:331;2843;Great director, music, graphics, acting and concept, and above all, great movie.
I:331;2844;Audio is excellent but the picture is no way near what a Blu.
I:331;2845;WOTW is pure popcorn fodder through and through.
I:331;2846;Heck, this is Spielberg doing sci.
I:331;2847;pure popcorn fodder, much like the way the tripods treat people in this movie.
I:331;2848;''than an actual SS directed flick.
I:331;2849;"the beginning
I:331;2850;the nonchalantness of it all was perfect.
I:331;2851;The special effects were not even all that great.
I:331;2852;the same team that brought us Minority Report an Adaptation from a Philip K. Dick Story.
I:331;2853;The Music will be By the amazingly talented mr. john williams the greatest composer of our generation.
I:331;2854;And the special effects by george lucas's Industrial light and magic.
I:331;2855;Ok, so what is good about this film?
I:331;2856;The effects are great, the acting is ok, and the mix of elements selected from the book and the re.
I:331;2857;imagined sections are pretty good.
I:331;2858;just like Independence Day, you have 2/3 of a good film and 1/3 cack.
I:331;2859;Which is a shame because there is a lot to like in the movie, Speelers has obviously tried to concentrate on the human element of the story and he manages this pretty well.
I:331;2860;Obviously this sort of stuff is not going to lead to a gripping film, particularly for U. s. audiences and I feel that Speelers therefore made a decent fist of re.
I:331;2861;imagining the book to a modern setting.
I:331;2862;It was a very very good movie.
I:331;2863;I'm seeing a ton of bad CGI work in movies these days but in this it was perfect.
I:331;2864;I believed everything I saw.
I:331;2865;thanks to my intellect, I was wise enough also to order its original counterpart from the Fifties.
I:331;2866;the entire movie is pervaded with them.
I:331;2867;"Saving Private Ryan it is not!Why has every Steven Spielberg movie to be a ""work of art""?"
I:331;2868;"How I loved him when he directed ""Jaws"", ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" and ""E. t. ."
I:331;2869;working father, are enough to be convincing.
I:331;2870;"He was even impressive in ""Minority Report"" and ""The Last Samurai""."
I:331;2871;but like this?What's the necessity, where's the meaning?There's even a cameo by a very gifted actor/director in its own right: Tim Robbins.
I:331;2872;what good did it do?
I:331;2873;up was a touch of genius and the sparks still come through when watching the old version.
I:331;2874;wow, we've got Superman here!
I:331;2875;also irritating is the constantly pounding music, if one can call this music, despite the fact that it was Spielberg's friend, John Williams who composed it.
I:331;2876;Amazing how everyone around them are blown up but not this family!!
I:331;2877;A good flick for any Tom Cruise fan.
I:331;2878;An entertaing film which keeps the energy and excitement going throughout the film.
I:331;2879;laws come out perfectly attired.
I:331;2880;This review is brought to you by new ZAP!!
I:331;2881;cleaner with the cleaning power of lasers!
I:331;2882;Takes the human right out of your clothes!
I:331;2883;Fast forward to present day: Earth is bombarded with electro.
I:331;2884;magnetic storms, while our freaked.
I:331;2885;"I'm just giving you an idea: ""Hey!"
I:331;2886;Aliens are flying around and zapping people into oblivion (except their clothes)!
I:331;2887;The smartest actor in this was Morgan Freeman who does the Twilight Zone.
I:331;2888;I liked this movie even more after my second viewing than my first.
I:331;2889;When I know the plot beforehand, I often see movies twice: once to see it as I *expected* it to be, and once to see it for what it actually is.
I:331;2890;I give Spielberg credit for having the guts to keep it as faithful to that as possible.
I:331;2891;"The musical note similarity to ""Close Encounters""."
I:331;2892;pleasant surprise: Music that is sparse, but is very effective when used.
I:331;2893;I don't care for science fiction movies, but this one is really good.
I:331;2894;I recommend this to anyone over the age of 15, because it could scare smaller children.
I:331;2895;A pretty good movie in all.
I:331;2896;The alien ships do look real and it has great special effects.
I:331;2897;I think that I was more entertained with the 1953 version.
I:331;2898;The disc was in great shape and played like a new one.
I:331;2899;This was one of the few movies this year that I was genuinely pumped up to see.
I:331;2900;Come on now Stephen, you can do better than this.
I:331;2901;Her voice just goes straight through you.
I:331;2902;The aliens, which you would expect to be evil and menacing, are actually sorta cute when you see them.
I:331;2903;This film was created to make a profit for the studio, not to make a good movie.
I:331;2904;I must agree with you guys.
I:331;2905;Spielberg is become one of the most underrated directors of last decade.
I:331;2906;He's done such remarkable films even in 80's, and still everybody is guestioning his maturity.
I:331;2907;Great movie with outstanding digital effects and sound.
I:331;2908;I hope, that duo Spielberg/Cruise will work together some time.
I:331;2909;And by the way, i think that Dakota Fanning is one of the greatest young actresses sinc Kirsten Dunst.
I:331;2910;Watching Ray struggle to connect with his children was interesting and slightly funny (especially when he tried to talk to his daughter Rachel).
I:331;2911;"the moment the movie starts ""up and up"" in action and high tension as the martains commit horrendous things to the fleeing human beings with their HEAT RAYS (tight!)"
I:331;2912;The acting the was amazing from everyone in this movie, although I did have a hard time getting used to Tom Cruise as a ragtag divorced father while feeling sympathetic for his problems as being a father to two unwilling children (who practically cut him down with exploits of their new father).
I:331;2913;It was a nice change to see for me: Tom Cruise playing the latter instead of a suave secret agent or busness man was quite refreshing.
I:331;2914;The music (John Williams again) really gives the already frightful atmosphere a more heightened feeling with an excellent score.
I:331;2915;Lastly the CGI is extremely well done in this movie, it looks and feels so realisic (much like SM.
I:331;2916;The drama as realistic and the action was non.
I:331;2917;on the flip side, I loved the special effects.
I:331;2918;"The Tripods were definitely terrific, from their design, to their movement, to their weaponry and ""war cries""."
I:331;2919;There was a good sense of threat and forboding throughout the film, and I think that this is definitely to Spielberg's credit.
I:331;2920;Although I disliked the idea of the tripods being buried underground for X number of years, the scene where the first one emerges is very clever and it does give you a good fright.
I:331;2921;The soundtrack is also pretty amazing .
I:331;2922;anyway, it is a good, thrilling movie with it's fair share of heart.
I:331;2923;stopping visuals and riveting action sequences.
I:331;2924;Some of the camera work is amazing, the special effects are seamless in relation to the live action.
I:331;2925;Cruise pulls of the role just fine, and the other actors compliment the storyline quite well.
I:331;2926;It is grainy at best.
I:331;2927;If one really scrutinize Steven's movies, they all have one common theme: humanity.
I:331;2928;Anyway, that's another topic altogether.
I:331;2929;This movie is slick with everything working cohesively.
I:331;2930;Tim Robbins seemed to be over the top being a paranoid survivor, Dakota Fanning is at her usual professional and resourceful self, Miranda Otto has proven that she can mix with the top of the craft and Tom is being Tom (a professional).
I:331;2931;Quite a scary movie to sit through at times but otherwise, a rather well.
I:331;2932;done movie from Steven Spielberg.
I:331;2933;Spielberg and Cruise gave expectations that.
I:331;2934;However if you do not have high expectations, this film is watchable.
I:331;2935;The aliens are relentless and remorseless and they capture and kill every human in their sight.
I:331;2936;the special effects are good.
I:331;2937;generous review but I like Spieldberg.
I:331;2938;Spielberg's film was not only lacking in the storyline, but the special affects were about the same as the 1953 version, which was excellent for its time.
I:331;2939;The screaming kid got on my nerves right from the get go.
I:331;2940;This is one of the summer blockbusters it has action and suspense,and one of my favorite atresses Dakota Fanning.
I:331;2941;this is one movie that is good all the way through and it dosent waste any time seting up.5 stars.
I:331;2942;That was actually my biggest surprise.
I:331;2943;Tom Cruise is really great, but acting in this kind of movie can't make up for that.
I:331;2944;A good moral tale written at the dawn of a brave new world, the turn of the last century.
I:331;2945;the acting was wonderful, the sound outstanding and the imagery will stick for a long time for a film.
I:331;2946;If you thought War of the Worlds was a great book.
I:331;2947;and a great radio show.
I:331;2948;and a great original movie.
I:331;2949;The original sources still hold up well after all these years and I don't think we should gratuitously remake films just so we can throw some cheesy CGI into them.
I:331;2950;Don't get me wrong, Spielberg has made some great films in his day, but his talent is waning and his good judgment flew out the window years ago when he decided to delete the guns from E. t. to make a political statement.
I:331;2951;They also guaranteed that the taint of Tom Cruise's insanity would mar the film and that Spielberg's fascination with Cruise's face would again lead to disturbingly close close.
I:331;2952;spielberg also decided that War of the Worlds (notice the word WAR) is a perfect place for another ham.
I:331;2953;First Mr. Cruise picks up a gun and fires it to protect his family in their vehicle.
I:331;2954;If a weird lightening storm leaves a crater in the ground, it's believable that that a crowd will gather and gawk.
I:331;2955;I think this is an underrated movie.
I:331;2956;The movie moves at a snail's pace and a headache is almost guaranteed!
I:331;2957;I like this movie and I'm a big fan of the George Pal version as well.
I:331;2958;ray that I have ever seen.
I:331;2959;it's sad to see such a master of film in Spielberg turn out such a piece of junk.
I:331;2960;Expect some good escapism in the film, but that's pretty much it.
I:331;2961;Cruise is much more believable as a sports agent, a bartender, a slick hit man or a fighter pilot.
I:331;2962;The original Wells' book was a commentary on British imperialism, while the Orson Welles' broadcast scarred a nation on the brink of World War II.
I:331;2963;This film demonstrates the fear that we as a nation still feel in this post.
I:331;2964;I've seen it about 7 times and like it each time a great deal more.
I:331;2965;Honestly there are few great directors left on this earth who can make truly astonishing blockbuster films.
I:331;2966;Schindler's List, Jurassic Park, even Munich are all masterpieces of intelligent cinemamatic wonder.
I:331;2967;When it comes to Speilberg we've come to expect the best out of him, and in this film I think he delivers beautifully.
I:331;2968;While Justin Chatwin, who plays Robbie, the son in the family isn't all that great, Dakota Fanning is on the other hand simply brilliant.
I:331;2969;Personally I love this movie now and consider it a science fiction classic as only Steven Spielberg can deliver.
I:331;2970;I was excited to see this movie (despite Tom Cruise) but wow, what a phenomenal piece of junk this movie turned out to be.
I:331;2971;So much for artistic credibility.
I:331;2972;town theater actually had this film on opening day.
I:331;2973;What Spielberg adds is a good human.
I:331;2974;interest story of how one family struggles to survive this invasion, and how they grow closer to each other in the process.
I:331;2975;And of course, there are fantastic CGI effects.
I:331;2976;An interesting touch, Mr. Spielberg.)
I:331;2977;If people find parts of this film disturbing (I certainly did) then maybe that is a good thing.
I:331;2978;"Seeing ourselves treated ""like animals"" is serious food for thought."
I:331;2979;The story mainly continues with these three people running around for survival.
I:331;2980;what's good about the movie:1) The acting: Tom Cruise, Tim Robbins and Justin Chatwin did a good job in acting their roles.
I:331;2981;From his previous works till today, he continues showing his talent even in this movie.
I:331;2982;even though this movie doesn't contain much of a story, it is nevertheless a fast.
I:331;2983;Moreover, human blood is full of microorganisms.
I:331;2984;The greatest benefit of Spielberg's WAR OF THE WORLDS is that it may provoke men into thinking more carefully of our natural habitat Earth and how we intend to live here.
I:331;2985;We take care of it, and it takes care of us in perfect symbiosis, and that is the best that we can do.
I:331;2986;"purists will probably go for the '53 version
I:331;2987;That is the best way I can describe it.
I:331;2988;The picture is very grainy and the bright backgrounds continued to burst out at you which created a very unnatural look to the picture.
I:331;2989;"My sisters kid said ""please make her shut."
I:331;2990;The movie itself is great.
I:331;2991;Cruise continues to amaze as an actor who can carry a movie by playing any part given him to its fullest expectation.
I:331;2992;Something on a grander scale.
I:331;2993;Tom's character loves fast cars, has an engine partially dismantled in his living room, and knows more about repairing them than his local mechanic.
I:331;2994;worshiping, hunk (according to my wife).
I:331;2995;Oh, I almost forgot the space aliens.
I:331;2996;"The extraterrestrials portrayed in this remake of ""War of the Worlds"" are much more in line with the H. G. Wells classic than the human characters."
I:331;2997;First the good news: The movie is exciting and suspensful from start to finish.
I:331;2998;"I like Steve Martin, but he's no Spencer Tracy
I:331;2999;I'd compare it to the previous movie, George Pal's 1953 version starring Barry, Ann Robinson, and Les Tremayne.
I:331;3000;The special effects won an Academy Award.
I:331;3001;Scientology was started as a prank by L. Ron Hubbard to win a bet with a couple other sci.
I:331;3002;Of course the writers are on his side and provide excuses and try to make Cruise look smart.
I:331;3003;If you can enjoy an episode of Gilligan's Island, that makes about as much sense . . .
I:331;3004;War of the Worlds was pretty amazing.
I:331;3005;screen behavior, is actually wonderful in this role.
I:331;3006;out heartfelt performance as Rachel.
I:331;3007;She has an amazing future ahead of her!Unfortunately, the film lacks a solid storyline.
I:331;3008;This movie just seemed to be more of a sequence of events, that while truly spectacular, wasn't ultiimately satisfying since much of the reason for the invasion and a clear resolution was never made clear.
I:331;3009;Still, there is MUCH to enjoy here.
I:331;3010;one note of superb cinematography among many moments is the conversation the father, son and daughter have in their van heading to a rural home.
I:331;3011;The camera close up of Cruise's distraught face, backing up.
I:331;3012;That scene was absolute cinematic genius.
I:331;3013;but the transfer is clean and sound is brilliant.
I:331;3014;Stephen Spielberg did a good, but not a great job, of directing this remake of the classic H. g. Wells book.
I:331;3015;At the end, the aliens have come here to eat us as food.
I:331;3016;Don't get me wrong, the effects, the sound etc. are very enjoyable, but the artistic value of this movie is minimal at best.
I:331;3017;Oh yes, you have to be a real cinematographic master to screw up such a fantastic material of Wells so badly!
I:331;3018;It had style to it.
I:331;3019;"the original had a more informative narrative from its main characters than the 2005 ""remake""."
I:331;3020;"I wasn't planning on liking Tom Cruise, yet it is his performance
I:331;3021;It is a summer movie.
I:331;3022;"it's the ""little things""
I:331;3023;picky with a movie, but there's really nothing of value here, and Wells's novel really has a lot more substance to it and deserves better treatment than it got in this movie.
I:331;3024;Alright, so we have an alien race with superior intelligence.
I:331;3025;H. G. Wells wrote the novel over a century ago and Steven Spielberg has done a fantastic job of incorporating some of the literary tale's elements into his version: the tripods and their ear.
I:331;3026;Surprisingly, John Williams's score is quite subtle and, on occasions, is barely audible.
I:331;3027;Fanning's strong performance shows why she is one of most popular child performers today.
I:331;3028;"while megahit ""Independence Day"" toured similar ground, ""War of the Worlds"" is more the work of a master storyteller and his name is Steven Spielberg."
I:331;3029;A plane crashes into the house and the van is still in the drive way.
I:331;3030;The van you always see spewing a black cloud in traffic.
I:331;3031;This remake of war of the worlds is very good.
I:331;3032;The first half of this new War of the Worlds is an attempt to be completely realistic in taking a simple premise and carrying it through.
I:331;3033;The people behave in a believable manner.
I:331;3034;Spielberg once again is only able to do this by partly ripping off the accounts of alien abductees (see also Close Encounters of the Third Kind, ET, and the Taken miniseries).
I:331;3035;anyway, the acting, staging, direction, plotting and effects are all well done in that first half.
I:331;3036;o. k., I've just eliminated some major complaints against this film, and yes, I also count the son amongst the believable characters.
I:331;3037;we also once again have too much Steven Spielberg for Spielberg's own good in the ending.
I:331;3038;in terms of where it was heading on its own, like a living, breathing creature .
I:331;3039;His brain can't accept what's about to happen and has happened to the world, to his son and daughter, and concocts this fantasy to put his mind at ease in its last few moments.
I:331;3040;"Victims' brains are fully capable of doing this and this ""final fantasy"" has happened in situations where they've survived to tell about it."
I:331;3041;This is why Independence Day's computer virus story thread was such an ingenious update to the War of the Worlds.
I:331;3042;filled Hollywood blockbuster action flick.
I:331;3043;But that's really the only way you can end up with a happy ending, with some camp along the way.
I:331;3044;Great science fiction or horror films, and this story straddles the line, say something general by showing something specific like any work of art.
I:331;3045;And if so, could the extraordinary happen in our world too?
I:331;3046;But WOTW is suprisingly good, until you remember that Spielberg started in horror, with Jaws at age 27.
I:331;3047;wOTW's strength is its constant homage to the original story, and other classic science fiction themes.
I:331;3048;It is hard to generate suspense, when this same story has been told for 100 years.
I:331;3049;Spielberg has a tough job, when everyone in the audience knows the ending, and is thinking of its possible variations.
I:331;3050;Perhaps that the film is so true to the original is a strength, as it is hard to top.
I:331;3051;Cruise is hard to believe as a working class cad, since he is such an image of glamour.
I:331;3052;When watching this family's plight, one is reminded of Close Encounters.
I:331;3053;How important the mission of Dreyfuss or Terri Garr seemed to the audience, and how joyful their triumph.
I:331;3054;vividly depicted with undeniably brilliant visual effects.
I:331;3055;At times the film is traumatic rather than entertaining.
I:331;3056;As an end of the world epic it is, for the most part, convincing and both the evil aliens and panicked human horde are appropriately appalling.
I:331;3057;Most effective of all is the way in which Spielberg expertly manipulates the attentions of his audience.
I:331;3058;Scenes of lurid horror are juxtaposed with scenes of creeping suspense, flickers of grief with moments of ominous awe.
I:331;3059;Screenwriters Josh Friedman and David Koepp discover inventive ways of incorporating a multitude of scenes and themes from H. G. Wells' novel, and Spielberg cleverly includes stylistic choices direct from the original Byron Haskin film.
I:331;3060;dimensional characters to more emphasise himself.
I:331;3061;The independent War of the Worlds movies are MUCH better and more entertaining and I highly recommend saving your money here and checking out the classic Victorian movie version instead.
I:331;3062;Let's hope Spielberg gets his head screwed on in the future and makes something we can all be proud of, like the original Jaws.
I:331;3063;I usually don't care for remakes but I thought this film was pretty good.
I:331;3064;with all that aside, this film has an incredible soundtrack.
I:331;3065;If you have a good surround sound system and more importantly, a good subwoofer, you are in for an audio, and tactile, treat.
I:331;3066;It is top notch and the audio engineers and mixers for this film nailed it.
I:331;3067;it is well worth watching just for the sound.
I:331;3068;It really adds to the scariness and feeling of impending annihilation.
I:331;3069;Good acting and Tom Cruise does a good job as a dad who finally grows up.
I:331;3070;"I say ""cover version"" because the classic tale by H. g. Wells was previously made into a movie, back in the 1950s, and that movie won Academy Awards."
I:331;3071;She's young, so I don't expect to see the pinnacle of acting ability out of her, so I think the blame for the one.
I:331;3072;He does a good job with his role (unless, of course, you subscribe to the theory that this is how he actually is in real life, so it's not acting, and this theory has weight given his recent behavior).
I:331;3073;I'd say he does a good job with the material.
I:331;3074;Back when the book was written, germ theory was relatively new, and the use of it as a key part of the story made for a gripping tale.
I:331;3075;They are exceptionally well done, and do an excellent job of conveying the feeling of being right in the middle of this horrifying war.
I:331;3076;grade efforts, not as bad as Twister or Close Encounters or Jurassic Park, but certainly not as good as Saving Private Ryan, E. t., Schindler's List, or even A. i. it is an entertaining popcorn movie, which you can take your older kids to see.
I:331;3077;The sound though is still on par for DTS and excellent in all aspects.
I:331;3078;"Every time Tom was on camera i could help think he was saying ""Look at me everyone,,,i'm so pretty."""
I:331;3079;Leave it to Spielberg to take a classic story and inject new characters into it in a clearly commercial move to increase box office.
I:331;3080;In the original, it was mankind that was primarily the focus of the alien threat.
I:331;3081;This part of the film is pretty well.
I:331;3082;Spielberg's usual amazing special effects do bring H. g. Wells' tripods to life.
I:331;3083;matter of fact, we have a perfectly lovely fight scene spoiled by Ferrier and Son's fight over whether he should join the Army.
I:331;3084;Cruise finally lets his son go his own way with the promise he'll rejoin the family in Boston.
I:331;3085;The 'invasion' of Robbins' basement was amazing.
I:331;3086;Best effects in the film by far as well!Cruise and family do reunite in Boston.
I:331;3087;She is a fantastic little actress.
I:331;3088;fi movie of all time and for the first hour, it is.
I:331;3089;This film also easily has one of the WORST endings for a movie.
I:331;3090;the first hour starts off briskly with the emergence of the alien tripod from beneath the ground being brilliantly conceived and executed (I loved the trumpet sound the tripod makes.
I:331;3091;The scene at the Hudson ferry is another spectacular showpiece as a terrified crowd tries to escape the attacking tripods, while another tripod flips the packed ferry over.
I:331;3092;Ray's daughter is reunited with her mother, and incredibly, her brother, who had run off during a furiously pitched battle between the US Armed Forces and the aliens.
I:331;3093;Again, enjoy this first half of this movie, TRULY GREAT.
I:331;3094;"Based on H. G. Well's novel and remaining suprisingly faithful to this source (with the exception of changing the time period, country and throwing in a couple of kids) Steven Spielberg's ""War of the Worlds"" remake is undeniably a riveting movie experience."
I:331;3095;Fine acting, haunting music, chilling special effects and gritty, realistic directing makes you forget its faults and clench the arm rests of your chair instead.
I:331;3096;The kids by the way are also good .
I:331;3097;In particular Dakota Fanning's hysteria is palatable.
I:331;3098;Likewise Justin Chadwin's determination to fight is potent, and certainly relevant to contemporary situations.
I:331;3099;as well as keeping the audience completely on edge.
I:331;3100;the 9/11 attacks and the dark side of human nature are at the forefront of the themes at work in the film.
I:331;3101;stirring speeches about how everyone has to work together, or Tom Cruise beating the aliens with his bare hands.
I:331;3102;stricken mobs and scenes of unflinching doomsday action that you could possibly wish for.
I:331;3103;"This movie is great as far as special effects and keeping in tune with the book, but Spielberg, having to make a ""family"" situation again, has this little girl in the movie who is bossy, and a brat, who screams in a high pitched voice with her tantrums with Cruise calming her down over and over."
I:331;3104;"If he leaves the ""family orientation"" out of some of his movies and get right down to a decent plot, it would be more enjoyable."
I:331;3105;My ten.year old loved this movie and found it gripping.
I:331;3106;along the way coming to grips with some moral dilemmas.
I:331;3107;Spielberg has avoided his usual shot of the back.
I:331;3108;thing and directs with a certain amount of detachment but still has the excitement of various objects crashing around .
I:331;3109;with a great feeling of realism.
I:331;3110;"you need to see it yourself
I:331;3111;I want to see how they did some of the things they did.
I:331;3112;One of the great things about the ending of this movie is that, despite the relocation of the original story from 19th.
I:331;3113;when we played it, I was very happy with the new adaptation.
I:331;3114;His children are also excellent actors, in particular the rebellious son who goes his own way and uncannily resembles Cruise.
I:331;3115;There is also Tim Robbins, whose defiant ranting is such a convincing counter.
I:331;3116;of course, the special effects are simply spectacular, and as in so many contemporary films almost a distraction from the plot.
I:331;3117;I particularly liked the aliens' attempt to re.
I:331;3118;This is a better than average remake that sticks to the book's original themes and the acting is outstanding.
I:331;3119;There is a wonderful theme of man at his worst throughout the film, but it is also excellent hard scifi with innumerable unexplained details that the viewer's imagination can fill in.
I:331;3120;But Spielberg's version does exactly what a summer blockbuster is supposed to do .
I:331;3121;John Williams' score is perfectly dramatic.
I:331;3122;On the contrary, the film fills the audience with dread and thrills and horror and most important of all, it reminds us of how small we really are in comparison to, no, not to aliens from another planet, but to our own temptation to kill each other, if not by nuclear war then in some other way.
I:331;3123;And it has been proven that we can make some good decisions because we are basically good people.
I:331;3124;headed summer blockbuster that Americans are used to ('Mr. and Mrs. Smith', 'The Fantastic Four', 'Godzilla', 'Independence Day', and even 'Jurassic Park').
I:331;3125;'War of the Worlds', and I'm not just speaking of Spielberg's excellent film, but also about Wells' storytelling, is a thinking person's tale of a possible tragic ending to the human race as we know it.
I:331;3126;And let me put it another way.
I:331;3127;And the scary thing is, they are capable.
I:331;3128;Though I love the original, this version was very intense and Dakota Fanning shines as always.
I:331;3129;I'm not big Cruise fan, but this film and Interview with a Vampire are standout moments in his career.
I:331;3130;In Speilberg's version we see the action entirely through the eyes of Tom Cruise's main character.
I:331;3131;But they also take away from the larger story from which the movie stems.
I:331;3132;He is depicted as a divorced, absent father, with a smart.
I:331;3133;wife has moved on to a better and more appropriate situation.
I:331;3134;In then end, when Cruise predictably triumphs, all he has accomplished is the delivery of his daughter to the waiting arms of her mother on an oddly unscathed Beacon Street.
I:331;3135;dazzle, ooohs and ahs, and spectacle.
I:331;3136;the first hour is the best with the second half slowed down a bit.
I:331;3137;The 1953 version with Gene Barry and Ann Robinson is far superior.
I:331;3138;It was refreshing to me, as a sci.
I:331;3139;This movie captures these claustrophobic feelings quite well.
I:331;3140;cruise, in the midst of his well.
I:331;3141;out/rant, puts on IMO the best performance of his career, here.
I:331;3142;the sound is an underappreciated star of this movie).
I:331;3143;if you're a fan of the book, I recommend this.
I:331;3144;I've always been a fan of the 1953 WAR OF THE WORLDS film as well as the published story and 1938 radio broadcast.
I:331;3145;The audio is extremely bass heavy at times and will give your home theater system a real workout.
I:331;3146;All in all a very good remake.
I:331;3147;handedly brings down a tripod, and again when the Army does the same.
I:331;3148;and nice to see the stars of the original WOTW in a quick shot as the in.
I:331;3149;Without a doubt this 2 disc Special Edition is extraordinary.
I:331;3150;The sheer volume of special material here is amazing.
I:331;3151;In this day of computer special effects I was surprised at what wasn't.
I:331;3152;As to the film, a worthy successor to the original.
I:331;3153;Tom Cruise is terrific, the tension and terror is palpable.
I:331;3154;I have seen this film now seven times and it's just as exciting, Spielberg at his best.
I:331;3155;Tom Cruise I considered one of the best actors to ever hit the screen, for I never hated one of his movies, even if the plot wasn't for me, I still just enjoyed how well he played his roles.
I:331;3156;It was like they made a Disney like happy ending.
I:331;3157;for right now you are slipping in my book.
I:331;3158;This proves you cannot always trust that a big name will save a film.
I:331;3159;"Just keep your expectations in check, and be sure to be in ""popcorn flick"" mode going into it."
I:331;3160;"With his stunning remake of H. G. Wells' ""War of the Worlds,"" Steven Spielberg has created one of the most intense and terrifying visions of the coming apocalypse in motion picture history."
I:331;3161;The utter darkness of this film is rather amazing considering the fact that Spielberg practically cut his teeth as a director on benign (albeit brilliant) sci.
I:331;3162;"War of the Worlds is certainly a case of Spielberg returning to his more ""primitive"" roots, for after his recent ventures into the world of cerebral sci."
I:331;3163;"In ""War of the Worlds,"" Spielberg has found the perfect source material for his roller coaster ride mentality and it pays off beautifully for all concerned."
I:331;3164;"As always, Spielberg turns a mere ""genre"" picture into a work of art."
I:331;3165;The director has Cruise work against type here, helping us to identify with his plight in a way we might not have were he conceived as a more conventional heroic type.
I:331;3166;"as this is a Spielberg film, it goes without saying that ""War of the Worlds"" is a model of state."
I:331;3167;art visual and sound effects, and that the director exploits every moment for its full intensity and impact.
I:331;3168;wound and suspenseful a thriller as I have seen in years.
I:331;3169;But what really puts it over is the way in which Spielberg manages to bring an end.
I:331;3170;In a post.9/11 world, that is a very chilling and powerful concept indeed.
I:331;3171;cruise and young Dakota Fanning do a beautiful job playing off one another in their many scenes together, making a real connection with us in the audience.
I:331;3172;But then that has been Spielberg's hallmark as a director all along.
I:331;3173;Chalk up another triumph for the master.
I:331;3174;Spielberg's newest creation, War of the Worlds, is the best alien invasion picture out there.
I:331;3175;I love the suspence it's just too entertaining.
I:331;3176;"Spielberg burns a lot of Hollywood oil with his version of ""War of the Worlds"" and yet turns out what I think is a coldly earnest and sincere epic of surprising emotional depth."
I:331;3177;A fact that Ray picks up on at about the same time).
I:331;3178;for a story that's hardly all that fresh (the '53 flick was one of my favorites, and I must have watched it dozens of times by my early teens), Spielberg manages to tell his story well.
I:331;3179;I really enjoy the movie, and a few minutes before ending, I looked at my watch and expect it will last for another half hour.
I:331;3180;But it suddenly ended with a few words.
I:331;3181;for a much better plot and ending see the original 1953 movie, also.
I:331;3182;This version of War of the Worlds received mixed reviews when it hit the big screen.
I:331;3183;This movie was exciting, scary (but not horror scary), and dramatic.
I:331;3184;the capture scene in particular.
I:331;3185;good old bacteria, viruses, and fungi (I assume) save the day.
I:331;3186;See if you catch the relevance of the crows toward the end.
I:331;3187;Tom Cruise (great acting in this film) and others say this in both the beginning and ending of the film.
I:331;3188;This is one doozy of a story, and film!
I:331;3189;I thought the film was highly enjoyable.
I:331;3190;The X. files, at least the first five seasons, were some of the best science fiction to have ever hit television.
I:331;3191;I also found the actions of the survivors plausible.
I:331;3192;That being said the movie was very interesting take compared to the original War of the Worlds.
I:331;3193;This is a good action flick, and Dakota Fanning is a great little actress in it.
I:331;3194;There is frequent use of strong language, and some scenes could be frightening to younger children.
I:331;3195;Otherwise it's a very entertaining movie.
I:331;3196;Even with all the reworking, this film still communicates H. G. Wells' Novel's striking element.
I:331;3197;He has a nak for realism.
I:331;3198;The film is well acted.
I:331;3199;fi action movies these days, because it's capturing the essence of a 19th century classic novel.
I:331;3200;Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise take their stab at it and it does not disappoint.
I:331;3201;action packed from the beginning War of the Worlds is a delight to ears and eyes.
I:331;3202;The story is good although a few plot holes keeps it from being great.
I:331;3203;a delightful movie to watch.
I:331;3204;The Two Disc set is absolutely phenomenal.
I:331;3205;Worth a definite checking out.
I:331;3206;par to what it could be.
I:331;3207;But, I can see what they are doing.
I:331;3208;par so that they can try to push the Blu.
I:331;3209;if you start to invest in Blu Ray now, the movie industry obviously has you wrapped around their finger.
I:331;3210;Paying homage to H. g. Wells original version War of the Worlds is a terrific thriller that does not disappoint.
I:331;3211;spielberg has always been a terrific storyteller and maintains his standing here as one of the premier directors of his generation.
I:331;3212;He moves the film along at a terrific pace after a slow burn buildup to the aliens' arrival and hardly allows a moment to stop and catch a breath.
I:331;3213;He is effective and believable without being spectacular.
I:331;3214;With such talent at a young age she has a long storied career ahead of her if she is able to remain level headed.
I:331;3215;despite the Deus ex machine type ending which is probably well known to many people who were familiar with the original story, radio or film versions there is still sufficient suspense to captivate the viewer.
I:331;3216;Very good movie, and very good special features on this 2.
I:331;3217;The special effects were amazing, and the acting was great.
I:331;3218;Dakota Fanning was great in her role, and Tom Cruise even added some comedy to his role.
I:331;3219;The length of the movie was perfect.
I:331;3220;"and i respect Stephen Spielburg
I:331;3221;minority Report., when he got a *good* performance out of Cruise?Remember, instead, the remake of .
I:331;3222;joke w/a bicycle that's truly chilling .
I:331;3223;hey, it is, but still!
I:331;3224;If you've gotta see it, watch for the aliens and their ground.
I:331;3225;"I thought to myself, ""Point the camera over there!"
I:331;3226;There is something interesting going on behind the actors!
I:331;3227;Very appropriate, engaging musical soundtrack / special sound effects.5.
I:331;3228;Good use of crowds and mob scenes.
I:331;3229;this is the best movie of 2005 with red eye,batman,star wars,emily rose.
I:331;3230;Great storyline, plot, and action.
I:331;3231;The wardrobe and sets are very good.
I:331;3232;The cast of actors is great!
I:331;3233;Lots of hard hitting action.
I:331;3234;Axe and rifle in hand, Ogilvy is deranged.
I:331;3235;"Both ""Artificial Intelligence"" and ""Minority Report"" were more visually inventive."
I:331;3236;It's accurate and unsettling, but not precisely enjoyable.
I:331;3237;which brings us to the ending.
I:331;3238;The War of the Worlds is a Spielberg show.
I:331;3239;It's only a movie, it seems to be winking, with hugs and smiles and renewed love all around.
I:331;3240;they are boogie men, born of our very human fear of the dark.
I:331;3241;And rationality, believability, are the hallmarks of good science fiction.
I:331;3242;i haven't like tom so much in recent years, but i thought he did an excellent job in this movie.
I:331;3243;"Lots of ""Edge of your seat"" action."
I:331;3244;The original is 10 times better!
I:331;3245;It even is more suspenseful!
I:331;3246;also, in the original, the people all go to the church for refuge, and in this version the church is the first building you see get destroyed!
I:331;3247;The original was significantly better.
I:331;3248;It was extremely suspenseful, the aliens much more believable, and the story did not center nearly as much on the individuals.
I:331;3249;The only reason I give this movie 3 stars is for the great acting performance by Dakota Fanning .
I:331;3250;she's really talented and she's doing an excellent job.
I:331;3251;Yes, the CGI effects are cool, but I don't need to see this flick to know what amazing things computers and software can do in our day and age.
I:331;3252;In the original, the ending was beautifully dramatically climactic with Gene Barry finding Sylvia in that church and comming together to hug as their deaths neared.
I:331;3253;This movie does pretty well in that regard.
I:331;3254;She fully agreed, and said that she thought of getting up and walking out in the middle.
I:331;3255;although it missed a lot of opportunities, the opening minutes do a decent job of capturing the look of the working neighborhood in New York and introducing the characters.
I:331;3256;And that's the rest of the movie .
I:331;3257;What a great contrast that should have been.
I:331;3258;But I will give credit for interesting looking Martian creatures.
I:331;3259;all it is, is blowing things up!
I:331;3260;Tom might be able to LEARN, considering his Fiancee is the always amazing Katie Holmes.
I:331;3261;she was the biggest baby!
I:331;3262;The acting was extremly good and the casting could not have been better.
I:331;3263;The special effects were very good too.
I:331;3264;But this just highlights the importance of hope.
I:331;3265;The conclusion to the movie may disappoint the American taste for happy endings through heroic action, but science fiction often succeeds most when it points out that the power of forces beyond our control are the substance of the greatest stories.
I:331;3266;This movie was a great movie which is the best way I can put it.
I:331;3267;The visual effects were stunning, and the acting was tolerable.
I:331;3268;I found the movie to be exciting and informative.
I:331;3269;Yes it makes a lot of references to 9/11 like another reviewer pointed out, and that is correct.
I:331;3270;Yes it plays out nicely that bacteria killed the aliens, the point is they observed everything except one tiny little thing and in the end it killed them.
I:331;3271;I really enjoyed what the movie had to offer and I liked how Speilberg offered little treats for people who read the book like when the aliens were playing with the bike wheel in the basement(the Martians never discovered the wheel).
I:331;3272;I highly recomend it to anyone, and I hope my review will help others who may not have liked the movie or haven't seen it yet.
I:331;3273;The movie was intense and what a wonderful cast!!!!!!
I:331;3274;Tom Cruise is amazing and hot as always and Dakota Fanning is adoreable and very talented actress!!!!
I:331;3275;It was very interesting I guess.
I:331;3276;This film was one of the best sci fi films ive seen.
I:331;3277;People may think that the ending is way to short and just a way to wrap up the movie quickly but I think it is very good.
I:331;3278;I really enjoyed the design of the alien ships and the guns on the side of them.
I:331;3279;all in all I think its a great film.
I:331;3280;Sure, the visuals are amazing, the technical teams have done a great job, but the story has gone way too far in watching the miraculous survival of this one single family time and time again.
I:331;3281;This is really too bad, because the movie starts off well and the storyline does a great job of building suspense.
I:331;3282;Tom was pretty good in his role, although I've seen better performances from him in other movies.
I:331;3283;The special effects were fine, nothing really new, but not bad.
I:331;3284;Find a more intelligent movie.
I:331;3285;like naivet , ready and willing to make peace with the unexpected visitors.
I:331;3286;the sound effects are creepy and the visage of the tripods towering over the cities and rural landscapes is chilling.
I:331;3287;Unbelievably, Spielberg trumps the original in the fear factor.
I:331;3288;despite Tom Cruise's recent public outbursts of love and whackiness, his acting is so good in this film, you really are able to forget about his recent antics and get involved.
I:331;3289;"She should have gotten one for ""I Am Sam,"" in opinion."
I:331;3290;and her performance is flawless here.
I:331;3291;goers fainting in the aisles.
I:331;3292;It still gives me goosebumps weeks after first viewing it on the big screen.
I:331;3293;and the Orson Welles radio drama as well.
I:331;3294;Some suspension of disbelief is acceptable in a film of this nature.
I:331;3295;And yet, he shows up again at the end of the movie, unharmed.
I:331;3296;kudos to the actual appearance of the tripods themselves, which are actually credibly scary as they devastate everything around them, and have a real sense of power and mass that eludes most CGI creations (the ferry scene, shot in my beloved Hudson River in Athens NY, was particularly rad).
I:331;3297;I've listened to Orson Well's radio drama of War of the Worlds so I was definitely interested in Steven Spielberg's movie version.
I:331;3298;(probably closer to 4 stars, but I must offset the haters):I saw the original 50's version and I liked it a lot.
I:331;3299;I always thought the ending made sense.
I:331;3300;anyway, I'm also a horror movie fan, and from a horror aspect, I think this movie did a good job of capturing terror.
I:331;3301;I liked the movie because it was fast passed and suspenseful.
I:331;3302;I would recommend this movie to anyone.
I:331;3303;Tom's acting was good, the FX were amazing, and the concept was good.
I:331;3304;verdict: good movie, go see it!P.
I:331;3305;s. loved the addition of the blood!
I:331;3306;moments in this movie it is hard to keep track.
I:331;3307;If this were anyone but Spielberg you might forgive, but it is Spielberg.
I:331;3308;disc edition of War of the Worlds is fantastic in every aspect.
I:331;3309;The movie itself is quite good.
I:331;3310;I liked it, and despite what others here would like you to believe, I am not a bumbling idiot.
I:331;3311;As a fan of action movies, I found this one to be way above par.
I:331;3312;It is very fast paced and relentless, something exciting happens in every scene.
I:331;3313;the action is the real strong point of this film.
I:331;3314;The visuals Steve creates are amazing.
I:331;3315;The best scene is the first scene with a tripod.
I:331;3316;It has much better writing than Jurrassic Park (another great movie), but nobody points that out.
I:331;3317;They are just saying it to boost their self.
I:331;3318;tHE EXTRAS: The extras are very good.
I:331;3319;kissin, yeah, but there also is alot of information about the film.
I:331;3320;The best of all the featurettes are the production diaries.
I:331;3321;pICTURE: The picture is good.
I:331;3322;It's more gritty and real.
I:331;3323;sOUND: Wow, the sound is good.
I:331;3324;War of the Worlds is not a perfect movie by any means, but it is very interesting in it's style and presentation of material.
I:331;3325;Not to mention, the special FX are the most realistic I've ever seen.
I:331;3326;the original War of the Worlds story was brilliant, and perfectly conveyed.
I:331;3327;in this movie that is tacked onto the last 2 minutes of a melodrama about a bad father who suddenly realizes he loves his son now that the world is in chaos.
I:331;3328;the story is quite simple and follows the HG Wells version and the 1953 movie version quite closely.
I:331;3329;and that's the part that was so cool.
I:331;3330;there are awesome special effects, there's suspense and there's a very good cast.
I:331;3331;I really enjoyed the previous reviews, which were very discriptive of the movie.
I:331;3332;It had the beginning and an end, with a couple of references added here and there.
I:331;3333;Stunning visuals and outstanding special effects almost make this film great.
I:331;3334;The dialogue is absolutely dreadful!
I:331;3335;The action and special effects for this film are on point.
I:331;3336;The one thing in which this movie surely excels are the astonishing visuals, the scenes were the terrifying tripods are chasing hundreds of screaming people in a field with the sky lighting up and the distant screams are staggering.
I:331;3337;The child actors did excellent jobs, particularly the young girl, Cruise himself never makes a bad movie (IMHO), he is so well suited to the action/sci .
I:331;3338;the good samaritan refugee in the basement, the guy took him in and that is how he gets repaid!
I:331;3339;The movie itself falters about twenty five minutes from the end, it just stopped being interesting, the great pace and tension of the previous hour or so evaporated .
I:331;3340;watching this movie encourages you to appreciate this fragile little planet of ours, this our home .
I:331;3341;aliens might want it but it is the perfect home for us, we should treasure it.
I:331;3342;I really liked this movie.
I:331;3343;I am not really into alien type movies but I enjoyed this one.
I:331;3344;If you love alien type movies then you will love this one.
I:331;3345;One of he best movies of 2005, Steven Spielberg once again shows why is The Master.
I:331;3346;The hype surrounding it's star may have distracted some upon it's theatrical release, but the movie itself is excellent.
I:331;3347;"With the right amount of terror, suspense, and humor, ""War of the Worlds"" is a post 9/11 thriller that will be talked about for years to come."
I:331;3348;It more or less is a regular Spielberg piece.
I:331;3349;He pretty much does this whole movie in what seems to be a day.
I:331;3350;"Plus, he believes in a ""religion"" (cult) that came out of the mind of a guy in the 70's."
I:331;3351;There are the great religions of the world, the ones that have been around a very long time.
I:331;3352;the movie has its classic moments.
I:331;3353;The first 25 minutes of the movie are quite breathtaking.
I:331;3354;Is it the fact that Spielberg wanted to add Robbins for the sake of having an Oscar winner in the movie.
I:331;3355;She has a definite future ahead of her in movies, I just hope Hollywood doesn't exploit her when she gets older.
I:331;3356;after this scene I found it virtually impossible to enjoy the movie.
I:331;3357;end between the Tom Cruise character's work up high and his ability to think when captured, in an high alien holding pen, but not strong enough story.
I:331;3358;Tom Cruise's character is well enough written but his son and daughter characters needed a whole lot more work.
I:331;3359;This film reeks of all that is good in film.
I:331;3360;It's fun and chocked full of great effects.
I:331;3361;Cruise is the ONLY actor that makes this film believable.
I:331;3362;Avoid this film at all costs.
I:331;3363;"I saw ""War of the Worlds"" for two basic reasons: I'm a fan of the George Pal original and the H. g. Wells novel, and I'd hoped beyond all hope to see Tom Cruise get vaporized onscreen."
I:331;3364;In this, his performance is right on target.
I:331;3365;As the de facto leader of the clan he helped pro.
I:331;3366;And Spielberg is the king of Hollywood marketing, at least for audiences that are willing to shell out [.]
I:331;3367;When you get people like Spielberg, Cruise and Fanning together in one film where the script is already present as a perfect book and a previous 1953 film showed exactly how a movie of this type should be done, how can you fail?Yet Spielberg found a way.
I:331;3368;At the end of the movie when the last of humanity is huddled together in a small church praying to a seemingly unhearing god to please save them, we see a heat ray shatter a beautiful stained glass window.
I:331;3369;But that's beside the point, it's his only 'acting' strength.
I:331;3370;Jeez!The saving grace were the special effects.
I:331;3371;The audio is brilliant, it is the star of the Blu Ray world with huge, deep bass, fantastic use of the discreet channels of your home theater system and clear details throughout the audio range.
I:331;3372;the video transfer is also very good.
I:331;3373;there are plenty of extras with interviews of Steven Speilberg, Tom Cruise and others as well as a retrospective of the 1953 version I saw as a boy.
I:331;3374;Also I request we re.
I:331;3375;perhaps we should also make our 120 feet tripod walks outpace a 2 legged 6.
I:331;3376;I highly recommend we assimilate these procedures before we are sent to war.
I:331;3377;with auteur moments and touches, and major impact.
I:331;3378;the opening of the movie, by contrast, is compelling, and the movie is worth watching simply for the first contact and the initial terror that comes.
I:331;3379;Spielberg decided consciously to make a movie about how an alien invasion affects one family unit, rather than how it affects the planet.
I:331;3380;The movie is at its best when the family is on the run and being hunted.
I:331;3381;Of the three, Steven Spielberg's ambitious adaptation is the one that has gotten the most attention.
I:331;3382;this adaptation has great action sequences that feature impressive visual effects.
I:331;3383;The alien tripods, as well as the aliens themselves, are startling to behold.
I:331;3384;Also, John Williams' score is a bit of a let.
I:331;3385;"down, almost mimiking James Newton Howard's brilliant score from ""Signs."
I:331;3386;"Also, how is it that the existence of the alien tripods were secretly buried underground without anyone finding them?Anyways, Spielberg's ""War of the Worlds"" is an epic film that will appeal to sci."
I:331;3387;"But if you want to see a great adaptation of Wells' masterpiece, then I recommend two other films: George Pal's 1953 classic, and Timothy Hines' underrated ""H. g. Wells' The War of the Worlds."
I:331;3388;Adapting H. G. Wells' novel into a Hollywood movie is always going to be hard.
I:331;3389;act pattern of heroic motivation that Hollywood movies require.
I:331;3390;a fractured family, gutsy kids, and gob.
I:331;3391;smacking CGI (ILM's best work in years).
I:331;3392;Friedman and Koepp's adaptation is also wisely loose enough to include some fine suspense sequences and some physical heroics from Cruise.
I:331;3393;It's astonishingly realistic, and I don't just mean the CGI .
I:331;3394;the scenes of mass human panic are spot.
I:331;3395;on, and the performances from Cruise and the amazing Dakota Fanning are exceptional.
I:331;3396;"So it might've been more effective if Spielberg had either: (a) ""metaphorized"" the microbes and made it not only about biology but also about finding ""the power of what's inside you"" in an emotional sense, i. e. your courage, your determination, your uniquely human will to overcome insurmountable odds."
I:331;3397;He gestures to the contemporary connection .
I:331;3398;Take one family, add a big scary threat, and top with a generous dash of syrup.
I:331;3399;and is all the more palatable for it.
I:331;3400;stop and for once, I have seen a new monster movie that actually scared me.
I:331;3401;I have seen hundreds if not thousands of science fiction, horror and monster films, so it is rare that I can actually be moved to the edge of my seat.
I:331;3402;I meen, when you mix these ingredients together, you do get that result.
I:331;3403;Mix one part big names with two part CGI animation, whisk in an extra part of well known story and cap it off with a pinch of advertising.
I:331;3404;starting of with the directing, Spielberg has produced a great piece of work.
I:331;3405;He has made the chilling parts chilling, the happy parts happy and the whole film is consistantly in the right tone for that scene.
I:331;3406;The look of the film was also a success.
I:331;3407;He has created the darkness and the uncertainty with his shot selection and the lighting alone.
I:331;3408;"now the acting, Tom Cruise, slightly dipping in recent form with films like ""Collaterol"", has returned to top form."
I:331;3409;"lucky"" blue collar worker so well."
I:331;3410;He is tested in this film, with scenes seeing him breakdown while trying to help his family.
I:331;3411;He also produces one of the most chilling performances i have ever seen from him at points within this film.
I:331;3412;He also surprises many by taking a role that is not what we expect.
I:331;3413;He follows the life of a regular man.
I:331;3414;Again, Cruise has done well.
I:331;3415;His co. stars, notably his daughter in the film takes many plaudits for her top draw performance.
I:331;3416;the CGI is also done so very well.
I:331;3417;As usual, the flm is visually stunning.
I:331;3418;But, when CGI is implemented, it is great.
I:331;3419;I urge you to enjoy it.
I:331;3420;the ending is very similar from the novel, and it is a whole and HUGE point of the main story.
I:331;3421;Spielberg surely knew this and wisely avoided a more climatic final, those who want humans blasting off and wasting aliens should look away.
I:331;3422;A footnote: this ending is far more wise than, for example, Independence Day.
I:331;3423;in a nutshell, of Spielberg's late SciFi works I prefer this one (the others being Minority Report and Artificial Intelligence) despite that in all of them you find masterful moments, this has the more thrills and surprises that are typical of his authoring.
I:331;3424;written, convincing conversation in the whole film and I couldn't care less about these people.
I:331;3425;This shows just how good 'Independence Day' really was .
I:331;3426;and this from the man who made 'Close Encounters', a truly great film.
I:331;3427;Spielberg is a great artist, but here he's just a great craftsman and I'm surprised he put his name on this hollow clunker.
I:331;3428;We love this version of the War of the Worlds.
I:331;3429;love the extra's in this special edition.
I:331;3430;A very interesting movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat.
I:331;3431;When I heard there was a remake of War of the Worlds being made I cringed.
I:331;3432;Even in 2006 the original movie is still great.
I:331;3433;"this new movie brings us closer to the alien invaders (although they look ""spookily"" familiar.)"
I:331;3434;, ties us in with family and friends and those who are survivors and those who perish.
I:331;3435;"It almost reminded of Stephen Kings ""The Stand"" as far as how encompassing Spielberg tried to make it, with much more success."
I:331;3436;She really is good though, and her talents are far beyond the zombie movies.
I:331;3437;The acting was above average, and cinema photography outstanding, and the directing better than most.
I:331;3438;Spielberg's take on H. g Wells classic, is indeed jam.
I:331;3439;alien technology supposedly freezes all electronic communications and functions on the planet, but oh, a miracle, a cell phone camera keeps working.
I:331;3440;due to this, all cars become obsolete as well, but oh again, lo and behold, an ingenius mechanic at the right place at the right time, and totally acidentally, comes up with an amazing patent that keeps T. cruise's mobile running smoothly.
I:331;3441;while all major cities are going through surreal devestation, miraculously (again) Boston seems to be chilling out and enjoying a nice day in the sun.
I:331;3442;With a titanic budget at hand, Spielberg does deliver a visual catastrophe with few near equals in celluloid history.
I:331;3443;The ride is good enough while it lasts but it doesn't last long enough.
I:331;3444;In the original classic, we found out more and more about the aliens.
I:331;3445;The scientist and his girlfriend were compelling characters because you saw them struggling against the Martian horde.
I:331;3446;Spielberg blew a perfect opportunity to make them creepy as hell.
I:331;3447;Cruise is our Everyman .
I:331;3448;a common labourer with designer jeans and a sports car.
I:331;3449;What follows is an pretty decent sci.
I:331;3450;Well this movie and signs are both good however they both could have been better but however this s still a great movie
I:331;3451;Tom Cruise: As usual, an awesome, riveting performance, Dakota Fanning: An acting talent beyond belief, Justin Chatwin: You ROCK!
I:331;3452;fi fan and love the original classic War Of The Worlds, this re.
I:331;3453;It has a happy ending which is always best imo.
I:331;3454;spielberg gets right to the chase as well.
I:331;3455;After a few brief scenes setting up the characters, he gives us a thrill ride that hardly lets up for the entire 117 minutes of the film.
I:331;3456;It's a chase film, but one with a heart and with a genuinely good story.
I:331;3457;His role here, like in Mystic River, is intense and deeply disturbing.
I:331;3458;the computer graphics Spielberg use prove that he is once again on top of his game.
I:331;3459;"In a world of ""Orange"" alerts with terrorism, War of the Worlds create a high tension just like the novel and first movie did."
I:331;3460;Darkly funny perhaps, but also frightening that that is the thought we jump to today.
I:331;3461;So, while I do think it can be considered anti.
I:331;3462;i would greatly recommend seeing this film.
I:331;3463;It's thrilling, dark and one of the best disaster movies I have seen.
I:331;3464;"Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise team together again, this time bringing another version of H. g. Wells classic tale, ""War Of The Worlds"", to the big screen."
I:331;3465;when I look at the film resume of Steven Spielberg, I see two phases of his career.
I:331;3466;the first is the undeniable punch that Spielberg gave the film industry in the 70's and 80's.
I:331;3467;"the second phase began in 1991 and goes right into the new millenium (right up to ""War Of The Worlds"")."
I:331;3468;"For the Christmas Season of 1991, Spielberg released ""Hook""."
I:331;3469;"Jurassic Park, great film , but, essentially ""Jaws"" on land."
I:331;3470;Schindler's List, landmark film that reminds us the horror of WWII.
I:331;3471;One of his best (but, most of his film's are).
I:331;3472;"in 1998, Spielberg released the classic, ""Saving Private Ryan"", a look at WWII from the eyes of the American Soldier."
I:331;3473;"Like ""Schindler"" this is a must see."
I:331;3474;In otherwords, another director Oscar for Spielberg.
I:331;3475;A. i Spielberg directed after his good friend and fellow director Stanley Kubrick passed away.
I:331;3476;It was Kubrick's latest project and Spielberg felt to honor his passing by picking up where Kubrick left off on the project.
I:331;3477;Minority Report was the first teaming with Tom Cruise.
I:331;3478;"Catch Me If You Can is the first Spielberg comedy since ""1941"" and is a breezy film based on a true story."
I:331;3479;The Terminal is the third film that Spielberg and Tom Hanks have done together and the weakest of three.
I:331;3480;a lot of images from this film remind me of previous Spielberg films.
I:331;3481;"is ""War"" a good film?"
I:331;3482;is it one of Steven Spielberg's best films?
I:331;3483;Yup (it is a Steven Spielberg film, hello!)
I:331;3484;"with all that aside, ""War Of The Worlds"" is a movie thats worth invading your time."
I:331;3485;"the special effects are outstanding and the actors are excellent, including Dakota Fanning who makes a really good job 
I:331;3486;to conclude, yes there is some flaws in the film, but in the overall picture this sience fiction film is good and is absolutely worth seeing it.
I:331;3487;tom Cruise does a decent enough job of playing a New Jersey single dad working stiff.
I:331;3488;god (look what they did to THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE this year!)
I:331;3489;War of the Worlds is intruiging, well done, well acted and, well, confusing!
I:331;3490;I've often laughed at Cruise's overly self.
I:331;3491;aware performances but he did an excellent job with his role, not shying away from being the not.
I:331;3492;Dakota Fanning is, as always, amazing as his tramautized daughter and her brother was also well cast.
I:331;3493;Good mix of humor, drama, and nail.
I:331;3494;able sci fi summer blockbuster?!!?!?!?
I:331;3495;mostly dad and son back and fourths.
I:331;3496;i forgot this was a sci fi flick.
I:331;3497;ok,a storm is brewing and the towns folk gather to have a look.
I:331;3498;he manages to jump start a mini van when no one else can.
I:331;3499;nothing about this movie is great or mind blowing.
I:331;3500;on attempt # 150,he succeeds at running away.
I:331;3501;come on, a movie with that title deserves to be in caps and exclamation points.
I:331;3502;"on the first day of this ""Extermination"" The townspeople start hearing lighting striking, and striking and striking and striking and striking, 26 times to be exact."
I:331;3503;i kind of got that yeah it was scary back in 1993 but wake up steve its 2005!
I:331;3504;from the opening credits, to the closing credits, the film is well made and rich in special effects.
I:331;3505;"The mind blowing eruption of the Martian invaders and ensuing disintegration of the populace by the ""heat ray"" is spectacular."
I:331;3506;Maybe the crowning moment of the amazing effects.
I:331;3507;Like many of the best films, they are born of great narrative.
I:331;3508;Well's original story delivers a superb narrative that pitches humankind against an extraterrestrial invading force.
I:331;3509;Set in epic proportions, with the near extermination of mankind.
I:331;3510;the script is a good adaptation of the original book, but transposed across the Atlantic.
I:331;3511;The film may have been enhanced by this dramatic musical score.
I:331;3512;If you don't have it, then it is worth getting.
I:331;3513;the acting in the movie is solid, with the real feeling that the central character (played by Tom) is scared (as anyone would be).
I:331;3514;through yet more great effects and vast crowd scenes (typical and mastered by Spielberg) we do get the sense that humanity is about to be wiped from the earth.
I:331;3515;the film reaches it's crescendo well, right to the point.
I:331;3516;all in all, a great film with great entertainment.
I:331;3517;way exciting scenes, to watch this film.
I:331;3518;Additionally, can you point me in the direction of one scene that is truly engaging?
I:331;3519;"When Cruise and Spielberg, the biggest actor and director in Hollywood, respectively, can no longer make a film worth watching, can one conclude that Hollywood as we know it has, as the human race should have done in this film, come to an end?And another note
I:331;3520;once upon a time, Steven Spielberg used to create mesmerizing motion pictures that strike a childhood chord in our souls or transplant us from our everyday experiences and bring us into a world of astonishment and hope.
I:331;3521;War of the Worlds, the modern, glorified special.
I:331;3522;"A cross between ""Jurassic Park"" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"", this end."
I:331;3523;As the family attempts to steer away from the evil aliens, Ray learns about his true responsibility to his family and the love that come from it.
I:331;3524;Special effects wizardry at is finest, yet that's about all that is grand about this complete hoax of a blockbuster.
I:331;3525;In that youth, I also remember the brilliant, though campy at times, special effects, adventure, and genuine excellence of the 1953 version, and the latter has always been one of my all time favorite sci.
I:331;3526;"fi/fantasy picture since ""Jurassic Park, "" in my view, and the things I did not like about his ""AI"" and ""Minority Report"" efforts, are all over this, and make the film more of a glimpse into what special effects (and great music by John Williams as always) can come up with, than a compelling film experience."
I:331;3527;The original was years/decades ahead of its time.
I:331;3528;in the 50's flick, we are well into the story very quickly.
I:331;3529;Any film technique as such, witness Spielberg's over.
I:331;3530;inspiring direction and special effects for just too much character development for characters in this which we really never care about.
I:331;3531;a lot of the effects are first.
I:331;3532;And Cruise's character is never really all that believable, let alone one which we can truly root for in the end.
I:331;3533;And even the good parts of Spielberg's version make one wonder really, where did all the budget go to anyway?Ah yes, the director's pockets most likely.
I:331;3534;filmed into something a lot more compelling, especially considering the 50 plus year gap between the classic and this misfire.
I:331;3535;And the 50's version was and remains the definitive and by far the best rendering of the novel, this a distant and for the most part unenjoyable remake.
I:331;3536;I found this a really nice rendition of the classic World of the World story.
I:331;3537;Spielberg is one of a handful of directors who love to make films.
I:331;3538;Spielberg has made his share of sequels, but even these films show his enthusiasm, his love of film.
I:331;3539;As a director, he has been involved in some of the most successful films ever made.
I:331;3540;With each new film, he adds a skill or learns how to create more intriguing drama or suspense.
I:331;3541;Just about every film is better than the last.
I:331;3542;"The Color Purple is very moving, but ""Schindler's List"" is devastating."
I:331;3543;"Jaws is suspenseful and frightening, but ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is a roller coaster ride."
I:331;3544;"Close Encounters of the Third Kind is great, but ""E. t."" is a classic."
I:331;3545;With a small number of missteps along the way, Spielberg has learned to blend of his love of the magic of film with a very accomplished skills, a skill matched by few of his contemporaries.
I:331;3546;War of the Worlds, starring Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning, blends the best elements of Spielberg's best films into a cohesive, scary, thrilling, suspenseful summer blockbuster.
I:331;3547;And it's a darn good ride.
I:331;3548;wife and their two kids, Robbie (Justin Chatwin, who bears a remarkable resemblance to Cruise) and Rachel (Dakota Fanning).
I:331;3549;out (his refrigerator is bare) and Robbie has taken a joy ride in Ray's beloved restored Mustang.
I:331;3550;Ray and a number of locals find the spot where the lightning hit and soon the ground begins to rumble.
I:331;3551;the original story was written by H. g. Wells in 1898 (which is pretty amazing, if you stop to think about it) and was made into a memorable radio broadcast by Orson Welles in 1938.
I:331;3552;The radio broadcast was so scary, so believable, people actually thought we were being invaded.
I:331;3553;"In ""Worlds"", Spielberg and screenwriter David Koepp center the action on Ray and his two kids."
I:331;3554;Everything they see and experience is what we see and experience.
I:331;3555;"This helps to make the film personal
I:331;3556;When they are in danger, the film is scary.
I:331;3557;As they journey through a changing landscape, we make the journey with them.
I:331;3558;This helps to give the film a soul and heart that most summer blockbusters don't have.
I:331;3559;spielberg has always been at the top of his game when it comes to films with a lot of special effects.
I:331;3560;He and George Lucas practically invented the modern era of special effects (some people would like to vilify them for this).
I:331;3561;"In ""Worlds"", there are certainly a lot of special effects and CGI work, but the work is so seamless, and blended with the live action so well, it appears to be real."
I:331;3562;"In ""Worlds"", the special effects make the human element all the more real."
I:331;3563;A particularly suspenseful scene involves Ray and Olgivy (Tim Robbins) as they play a game of cat and mouse with each other and some alien foot soldiers.
I:331;3564;tom Cruise has definitely become one of our finer actors.
I:331;3565;His silly appearances on recent talk shows aside, he is an accomplished actor and he has been making some bold decisions lately in the projects he works on.
I:331;3566;Collateral was a bold choice for the megastar.
I:331;3567;He took the role and did a great job in it.
I:331;3568;Spielberg + Cruise + Aliens and special effects = summer blockbuster and studio green light, but the actor brings much more depth to the character than we might expect.
I:331;3569;"In most summer films, we would see a few minutes of this type of character, to ""establish it"" and then the action kicks into gear and all character nuances are forgotten."
I:331;3570;He grows in believable, small and acceptable ways.
I:331;3571;Worlds is not Cruise's best work, but for a summer blockbuster it is surprisingly good.
I:331;3572;This little girl is a great actress.
I:331;3573;In most of her films, she brings an amazing range of emotion to the role.
I:331;3574;It is truly mesmerizing to watch such a young girl deliver such a convincing performance.
I:331;3575;spielberg has created a real roller coaster ride of a film.
I:331;3576;"He has taken the thrills of the ""Indiana Jones"" films and married them with acting on the par of ""The Color Purple"" and added special effects that would rival ""Close Encounters"" or ""A. i.""."
I:331;3577;This mix has created one of the best summer blockbusters I have seen in some time.
I:331;3578;It is one of his greatest works to date.
I:331;3579;i also enjoyed the performance by Tom Cruise, who sunk into his role and executed it greatly as a father who is trying to make ends meet, all while working through the pains of divorce.

I:331;3586;As many have pointed out, the H. g. Welles book of the same title as this film was a work of art.
I:331;3587;The Mercury Theatre radio production (with Orson Welles) is a historical landmark, and the original film with Gene Barry was pretty good.
I:331;3588;i'll admit it: I've seen it twice so far.
I:331;3589;The introduction of the aliens at the first part of the movie is excellent.
I:331;3590;overall, this movie delivers excellent special effects.
I:331;3591;On top of that, Tom Cruise made a great performance.
I:331;3592;if you prefer to watch a movie without any logical explanation for the consequence, go for it and enjoy the first 60.70 minutes.
I:331;3593;The only reason this received one star is for the average special effects.
I:331;3594;first off, the 1953 version is a FAR better movie.
I:331;3595;While it may have strayed a bit from Wells' novel, its a great movie.
I:331;3596;In addition, the classic ending of the novel and the 1953 version is utilized, but NEVER EXPLAINED!
I:331;3597;the special effects are pretty spectacular, as expected.
I:331;3598;This movie is a great case in illustrating that great special effects DO NOT make a great movie.
I:331;3599;Do yourself a favor and watch the 1953 version (which by the way has excellent special effects considering its age!)

I:331;3605;All in all, not perfect, but a popcorn film this is.

I:331;3607;The disc came perfectly new, factory sealed.

I:331;3609;But knowing what I do now, I can confidently say I'm starting to see him for the great film.
I:331;3610;And with this being the second Tom Cruise/BD.
I:331;3611;in with Minority Report, I'm going to be keeping a lot of the technical similarities of the review between this and Minority.
I:331;3612;As for War of the Worlds, much like my experience with Minority, I never got around to seeing it in theaters and was thoroughly surprised when I actually got around to watching it.
I:331;3613;While 2012 certainly has the visual aspects down, I really wanted the movie to be more than just eye candy.
I:331;3614;9/11 and political undertones aside, I see this film as being much more profound in that while it also has an advanced visual flair, it also manages to tell a very well.
I:331;3615;paced and engrossing kind of thriller.
I:331;3616;Sure it may be an alien invasion movie, a concept tried and dried through various mediums since the Cold War, but to see it produced with a combination of such glamorous effects and taut screenplay, I'm amazed at how well it presents itself.
I:331;3617;It was, for me, a very surprising piece of sci.
I:331;3618;fi horror that was downright spooky at some points with just enough grit, action, and story/characters that managed to enlighten, as well as entertain.
I:331;3619;5.0Much like Minority Report, Paramount does an outstanding job preserving the work of Janusz Kaminski.
I:331;3620;"To be blunt, there's grain, and lots of it, but intentionally so for cinematic effect and a kind of ""vintage"" look."
I:331;3621;"For the type of film it is, colors aren't really drab, per se, but are uniquely ""alien"" in that their variations range from darker to lighter primaries with a hint of ""metal"" to them."
I:331;3622;It's something of a chromatic progression that evolves with the narrative and displays itself accordingly.
I:331;3623;And contrast is also excellent with only one or two instances of that Bleach Bypass technique, which never really distracted me in Minority, but those who don't like it will be happy to know it's not nearly as prevalent in this film.
I:331;3624;Kudos to the people at Paramount.
I:331;3625;5.0Also like Minority Report, War of the Worlds boasts an equally buoyant and reference.
I:331;3626;And I have to say for a man who only saw half of the movie before making a full score, Williams never ceases to amaze with his musical intuition and mastery of the craft.
I:331;3627;Separation is perfectly placed from the rears and does an excellent job of panning when needed, while high and low ends cover the spectrum in the form of mechanical whirring down to the sound of small handgun fire.
I:331;3628;This is alien invasion at its finest.
I:331;3629;minute diary and musical composition pieces are what I found to be most interesting.
I:331;3630;A lot of work went into the making of the film, and this really raised my appreciation for it as a whole.
I:331;3631;A little bit of the story's history and its origins are mentioned as well, along with what Spielberg wanted to do with it in terms of modern.
I:331;3632;I'm also bummed that there's no commentary or at least some kind of introduction by Spielberg himself, though I'm still hopeful to hear one by him at some point.
I:331;3633;fi, and horror all rolled into one with brilliant execution thanks in part to its simplicity of screenplay, excellent effects, and a great cast.
I:331;3634;"tom Cruise is in just about every scene and he gives a sensational performance (his tearful rendering of ""Little Deuce Coupe"" to his daughter Rachel (Dakota Fanning) is a standout."

I:331;3636;what can you say about the ILM special effects wizards?The opening phases of the invasion (numerous lighting strikes, followed by concrete gutters and sidewalks erupting) is beyond mesmerizing.
I:331;3637;but Speilberg uses the effects more as a backdrop to the human interest story of Ferrier and his family.
I:331;3638;making them all the more effective.
I:331;3639;"The high tech stuff is second grade
I:331;3640;he seems to bring down the supporting cast as well.
I:331;3641;"Anyone with common sense sits there and says ""FIND A TREE!"""
I:331;3642;He seems to care more about how he looks in those pants than coming across as a sympathetic character.
I:331;3643;Okay, for the most part I enjoyed the film.
I:331;3644;It was a great translation of the Wells classic.
I:331;3645;As an action film alone I would give it a 3.
I:331;3646;I love this movie and the suspense is always palpable even though I have seen it at least 3 times.

I:331;3652;art CGI techniques are all fantastic .
I:331;3653;see the breathtaking sequences in which a huge tripod appears from the ground .
I:331;3654;but the director (who won Oscar for 'Saving Private Ryan') often uses them to scare you.
I:331;3655;see a bicycle in the basement, for instance .
I:331;3656;and that's OK with me.
I:331;3657;see for the cameo of Gene Barry and Ann Robinson, the stars of the 1953 version of 'War of the Worlds' which remains the definite version of this H. g. wells classic.
I:331;3658;Great film, great special effects.
I:331;3659;"The good things about the movie are ""definately"" the special effects."
I:331;3660;This is the main highlights of the film, very good atmosphere for terror is used.
I:331;3661;The preview looked exciting, but the film is utterly BORING.
I:331;3662;WAR OF THE WORLDS was one of the few movies I definitely wanted to see during the summer of 2005.
I:331;3663;Spielberg updates Wells' classic sci.
I:331;3664;Tom Cruise is really a terrible actor, but in all honesty is performance in WAR OF THE WORLDS as Ray Ferrier is one of his best.
I:331;3665;Dakota Fanning plays his daughter Rachel and is brilliant as always, while Justin Chatwin kind of gets screwed playing the unnecessary role of Robbie Ferrier.
I:331;3666;By that time the invasion is in full force.
I:331;3667;spielberg does a great job of melding Wells' original novel to the famous 1953 version of the story.
I:331;3668;The acting is decent and the film moves at a great pace.Yet, despite all of this, the movie falls apart 2/3rds of the way through.
I:331;3669;Instead of taking a page from suspense master Hitchcock, Spielberg copies the teen.
I:331;3670;It's survival of the fittest right here and the military doing the best they could.
I:331;3671;frightening moments and special effects galore.
I:331;3672;The three leads give good performances, and Tim Robbins' extended cameo is a nice addition, displaying his more psycho persona.
I:331;3673;"Hey, ""War of the Worlds"" may be a remake as well, but it's a damn good one at that."
I:331;3674;rated director of all time.
I:331;3675;Steven Spielberg one of the best filmmakers in the world, but what happened here?
I:331;3676;None of Spielberg's trademarks: Tight script, Believable suspense, Good acting are present here.
I:331;3677;The story was written in the 19th century, but whose brilliant idea was it to change it, David Koepp's?
I:331;3678;"I am sure, Spielberg will return to the top form with ""Munich,"" at the end of this year."
I:331;3679;The special effects were just great.
I:331;3680;the acting was fair with a fair story line and to much screaming from Dakota Fanning.
I:331;3681;War of the Worlds is entertainingly adapted from the H. G. Wells novel that secured science fiction as a literary genre.
I:331;3682;It pays homage to the 1950s movie George Pal made from the book by including cameos by stars Gene Barry and Anne Robinson.
I:331;3683;The opening, when the aliens disrupt a Hoboken intersection, is heart.
I:331;3684;The capsizing ferryboat sequence is a text exercise in crowd management and seamless CGI.
I:331;3685;I basically liked this film even though Spielberg took many liberties.
I:331;3686;He's one of the few directors I give a pass to.
I:331;3687;Very suspenseful and action oriented.
I:331;3688;Ms. Fanning is very cute but a pest in this film which is probably how a young child might act if this really happened.
I:331;3689;All in all a good movie.
I:331;3690;And I got two copies!
I:331;3691;LOLAnyhow, the movie is great!
I:331;3692;The movie follows the book very well!!!
I:331;3693;I know some people don't quite agree, but I thought it was an excellent alien movie.
I:331;3694;It was a great movie for Speilberg to direct and had great roles for Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning, both of whom were fantastic.
I:331;3695;I know some people don't like the ending, but it is the same ending as in the book and I actually liked it.
I:331;3696;It was a good resolution to a good movie.
I:331;3697;When I was an adolescent, I was a huge H. G. Wells fan.
I:331;3698;I loved his imagination, as well as his academic precision.
I:331;3699;Along with Jules Verne, he is known as the Father of Science Fiction.
I:331;3700;the War Of The Worlds is one of four of his books that are considered masterpieces and have been made into films.
I:331;3701;The War Of The Worlds gained tremendous fame when Orson Wells made it into a radio drama in 1938, and, because he presented it as a series of news flashes, many people thought we were actually under attack by Martians and panicked.
I:331;3702;It is today the most famous radio program ever produced, and, even though he was consider irresponsible, launched Orson Wells' career.
I:331;3703;It is interesting for a number of reason.
I:331;3704;For one, Barry is wonderful as scientist Dr. Clayton Forrester, who investigates the first landing of Martians while on a fishing trip near the town of Pine Summit.
I:331;3705;Another change is with the invaders and their machines: the 50's fascination with television makes the Martians almost organic TV cameras, and their machines Art Modern sculptures that float above the earth.
I:331;3706;And finally, there is a strong Christian theme that didn't exist in the original work.
I:331;3707;hiding, and it was nice to see Gene Barry and Ann Robinson make re.
I:331;3708;appearances from the 1953 film as the grandfather and grandmother.
I:331;3709;The 1953 version is still the best filmed version of this classic, and that is not saying a lot.
I:331;3710;We still need a strong version that is set in the 1890's like the novel.
I:331;3711;It is interesting that when George Pal produced The Time Machine in 1960, he did use Wells' 1890's setting, and it is a vast improvement over his War Of The Worlds.
I:331;3712;"(Truly great drama throughout, I was like ""i hope they make it!!!"
I:331;3713;that was the genius of the aliens, because they could just pop up and surprise attack the suburban Boston area.
I:331;3714;I was genuinely stunned by this movie.
I:331;3715;headed Spielberg summer blockbuster starring that jerk Tom Cruise.
I:331;3716;I managed to get a few of these naysayers to see the flick and they came away also convinced that something genuinely unique had happened here.
I:331;3717;Frankly, I think it's one of the most remarkable films I've ever seen.
I:331;3718;much of this film, like some of Schindler and the first half hour of Ryan owes much to classic avant.
I:331;3719;garde and art film and little to summer blockbusters (The first part of Ryan was an unprecedented departure from popular film making!)
I:331;3720;I saw much in this incredible movie that reminded me of Tarkovsky and others.
I:331;3721;The art direction was stunning and the use of CGI, for the first time in memory, totally inspired.
I:331;3722;numbing nightmare, but a visually stunning nightmare.
I:331;3723;War of the Worlds is brutal, possibly the most brutal film to have ever reached a mass audience, and its relentless depictions of social breakdown and dehumanization are among the most powerful I've ever encountered in any film.
I:331;3724;Spielberg has made a stupendous breakthrough here by using the resources of the best of what Hollywood has to offer and the money available for a project like this to confront audiences with a film that is only superficially acceptable as a typical mass.
I:331;3725;in a sense the film is a tribute to plenty of 50's era science.
I:331;3726;"What seems to have captured Spielberg's imagination is a style and a kind of visual lexicon that derives more from the surrealist style of Cameron Menzies in the remarkable ""Invaders from Mars"" and other similarly atmospheric films from that era."
I:331;3727;I'd argue War of the Worlds is the most visually poetic science.
I:331;3728;garde and independent film, if you like poetic film and powerful imagery be prepared to be knocked on your fanny.
I:331;3729;Just one thing that happens in this film was one of the most stunning and unforgettable images I'd ever seen in a lifetime of film viewing.
I:331;3730;"When I saw it in the theater I responded audibly to that moment ""Oh."
I:331;3731;i was totally horrified by what i was seeing but I was simultaneously in awe of the genius of the film.
I:331;3732;"honestly, once the dust clears and more people have a chance to ponder it, Spielberg's ""War of the Worlds"" will start turning up on people's Best Films Ever lists."
I:331;3733;"Downright scary at times, ""War of the Worlds"" provides Spielberg with the chance to play boogeyman in this sleek adapation of H. G. Wells' classic novel."
I:331;3734;wife)and contemporary references as well (it's clear that Spielberg took our post 9/11 paranoia and the havoc that the terrorist attack caused as his inspiration for moments in this film).
I:331;3735;You just have to get on the ride and enjoy it for what it is.
I:331;3736;When the ground begins to shake, roll and crack clearly the invasion has begun.
I:331;3737;It's a solid featurette with plenty of pre.

I:331;3749;Screenwriter David Koepp discusses his rule (which he discussed with Spielberg) about focusing only on what Ray and see and experience to give the audience a handle on the invasion.
I:331;3750;"It's a wise approach allowing Spielberg to avoid the pitfalls that undermined ""Independence Day"" and most of the disaster thrillers we see."
I:331;3751;"a fun thriller, ""War of the Worlds"" won't win any of the big Academy Awards this year but that doesn't mean it's any less a good movie or that the themes examined here are any less valuable."
I:331;3752;The good news is that you can sit back and enjoy Spielberg's film as a straight thriller or look much deeper at the themes that are at the heart of the film.
I:331;3753;Oh, by the way, I do smell a double.
I:331;3754;"Spielberg's ""War"" is excellent on almost every count, a gripping drama with elements of true horror mixed in with some truly inspired acting."
I:331;3755;This movie benefits from its excellent cast almost as much as the timeless story it tells, step by gritty step.
I:331;3756;"director Spielberg approaches this story in much the same way as he did ""Saving Private Ryan"": an ""in.your."
I:331;3757;Tom Cruise brings real pathos to his character, an anti.
I:331;3758;hero compared to his previous roles, who is forced to overcome his own fear and flawed nature simply to survive, while somehow finding a way protect his two children.
I:331;3759;Dakota Fanning's intensity is amazing to watch, particularly when she must react to things that no child should ever see.
I:331;3760;"much like the original novel, we see the events through the eyes of Cruise's character, a ""view from the bottom"" if you will."
I:331;3761;Spielberg incorporates a number of elements from the H. g. Wells novel that make this film more faithful to Well's original vision that either the 1953 film or the Orson Welles radio broadcast.
I:331;3762;The film's imagery is stark and vivid throughout, and there is no sense of triumph at the end.
I:331;3763;"The film instead celebrates the faith and perserverance of its lead characters far more than the ""victory"" that humanity finally receives, a victory that comes only after all human effort has completely failed, in keeping with the classic ending from the novel."
I:331;3764;many people will dislike this movie, but I encourage anyone who can stand being frightened for the right reasons to watch and own this film.
I:331;3765;It will become a classic, perhaps even be seen as one of Spielberg's best efforts in the years to come.
I:331;3766;Just kidding, lolBit that's all beside the point, and the point is that this is a great movie.
I:331;3767;so Speilberg had a lot to overcome to do this movie justice to begin with, and for the most part he succeeds.
I:331;3768;speilberg is the master of the unseen, in Jaws he made a great movie about a shark when the special affects crew could barely keep the fake, mechanical Shark working.
I:331;3769;This whole movie is one of the most brilliantly inspired productions I have ever seen.
I:331;3770;Something more humanistic instead of just watching the world being destroyed.
I:331;3771;"Watching them was like something out of some of my own nightmares
I:331;3772;Mapother was okay, no better than the idiot he's caricatured himself into in the press as of late.
I:331;3773;I was happy to see him offed.
I:331;3774;providing a showcase for the ILM effects house.
I:331;3775;This was a great movie.
I:331;3776;I really enjoy large special effects sci.
I:331;3777;fi, fantasy and action/adventure movies and feel that this movie is a good example of those types of movies.
I:331;3778;The special effects are excellent and Spielberg delivers some creative and effective camera shots such as the long extended un.
I:331;3779;I also liked the premise of the film as we follow how the average every day person reacts to such a cataclysmic event.
I:331;3780;The basement scenes have some great and essential parts to the story such as the encounter with the aliens (which are fantastic looking) and the disturbing murder of Tim Robbins character.
I:331;3781;star reviews, and you get a pretty accurate idea of what's going on here.
I:331;3782;The special effects are OK, and the DTS sound is excellent.
I:331;3783;But if it's a compelling story you want, you'd find better on the back of a cereal box.
I:331;3784;So, with that in mind that was the way I viewed the film.
I:331;3785;To me it brought everything together.
I:331;3786;nature finally rewards the residents of earth, those who have lived with nature through millenniums of evolution.
I:331;3787;Most of the action is at the beginning and the end, and the middle pretty much fills up screen time.
I:331;3788;I have heard a lot of people complain about the ending War of the Worlds, and I feel the same way about it.
I:331;3789;It's got some amazing and elaborate sets and the special effects and alien/space ships are totally over.
I:331;3790;Both Cruise and Fanning tried their best to make this film a more dramatic experience.
I:331;3791;This is a very simple and straight forward thriller that required very little thinking from the viewers.
I:331;3792;Sweet little Dakota is the best actress in all of Hollywood, young or old.
I:331;3793;Her performance here was her best to date.
I:331;3794;Overall I prefer the 1950's version of War of the Worlds, because the 50's version has much better special effects than Spielberg's update.
I:331;3795;"as for Dakota Fanning, I really wanted to put a ""Eat Me First""sign on her."
I:331;3796;"And for a nice happy ending, Mom and her family are safe and sound in their untouched upper class neighborhood (they appear dressed for a ""War of the Worlds "" party."
I:331;3797;pack your best special FXsin first 20 mins and then add rest of the movie that feels likeafterthought.
I:331;3798;to summarize:Special FX are good.
I:331;3799;shot for probably 0.001% of the cost WotW it is much more fun to watch.
I:331;3800;Beside that, the graphic effects were quite exceptional and resembled more closely the machines the H. g. Wells story.
I:331;3801;it's hard to top the George Pal story of the early 50's.
I:331;3802;All in all, the film was entertaining enough with the visual effects hiding some of the flaws.
I:331;3803;He's divorced, the kids live with the ex.
I:331;3804;Hence, the family scenario was very real to us.
I:331;3805;speaking of real, the story is presented in a very realistic, serious manner.
I:331;3806;what works best are the towering and utterly horrifying alien tripods.
I:331;3807;This, of course, creates an incredibly eerie reddish landscape.
I:331;3808;there are numerous memorable scenes: The opening attack in New York/New Jersey, the Hudson River ferry scene, the train in flames, the military night fight on the hill and the basement sequence.
I:331;3809;i also love the authentic Eastern locations, filmed in New York, Virginia, Connecticut and New Jersey.
I:331;3810;The only way I can watch and enjoy the picture is to make believe they're not there.
I:331;3811;I saw the original film as a child and loved it.
I:331;3812;i read the book and thought highly of H. g. Wells' ability to raise Science Fiction to art, considering the 100 years or so between novel and film, it was remarkably topical.
I:331;3813;life crisis and was actually due to good filmcraft, that I a absolutely thrilled to see this modest political film done in a sombre tone that makes for a great adult film that has a strong theme followed by beautifully shot and acted moments throughout the film.
I:331;3814;"The brutal yet beautiful filming of the end of the world and the expected and lived up to loss of civilization within realization of the USA getting a whooping and not fighting back, which I'll bet is playing into a lot of ""Be all that you can be"" commercials paid perhaps a bit too much attention to in real US politics."
I:331;3815;"but it's interesting that when Spielberg is on track to make a serious and honest film like Munich, his entertainment film is usually a bit more ""entertaining"" rather than played for thrills rather than a slice of reality."

I:331;3817;but I bought into the story in a way many decided not to.
I:331;3818;All I can say is give the film a fair chance.

I:331;3829;Speilberg was brilliant in returning to that hidden danger to enhance the fear in his audiance.
I:331;3830;If you are just looking at this as a disaster movie with awesome special effects and decent acting jobs (even from Cruise), its worth seeing.
I:331;3831;over all, this movie is worth seeing even if Tom Cruise is in it.

I:331;3833;This is a phenomenal movie, well played by Tom Cruise.
