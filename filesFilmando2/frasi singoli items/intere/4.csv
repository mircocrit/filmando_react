1;and he gave a good performance in this movie.
2;I bought it primarily to see if the blu.
3;ray was worth it on older movies, and I believe it is.
4;This is such a great movie.
5;A true mobster genre fan has to have this in their collection.
6;This is a film about the Mafia but there are other aspects that make it such a memorable film , such as being in a gang no matter what the cost and the demands of keeping up a certain lifestyle .
7;the commentaries are informative and the Special Edition is very welcome .
8;This is one of the best film's of the 90's and next to the godfather, the best mafia film ever.
9;The other problem is there are no features at all and that is pittiful for such a great film.
10;Will always be a mob classic.
11;Some of Liotta's best work and any movie with De Niro and Pesci has to be good.
12;one of the best movies ever created.
13;the bonus features for the 2 disc special edition are great.
14;Interviews with everyone involved from the production crew to all the main actors.
15;He also came up with the opening titles, which are as important to the movie as the rest of it.
16;This Special Edition is great.
17;The movie itself is pefectly done and directed, also the cast is one of the best when it comes to mafia movies.
18;so those of you who enjoy mafia movies this one is definitely a must have on your collection.
19;This is a classic, possibly the best movie on the American mafia ever made.
20;A must see for everyone.
21;This is a must see for any family who loves Italian history as presented by Hollywood.
22;We loved it so much we went and picked up grandma from the home so she could relive her childhood with us.
23;Best movie ever and I loved Joe Pesci!
24;Straight classic movie and if you on the fence get it!!!!
25;As far back as Henry Hill can remember, he always wanted to be a gangster.
26;This is his true story, adapted from a novel by Nicholas Pileggi and brought to the screen by writer/director Martin Scorsese.
27;Because it is a true story about real people, it would be nothing if the characters didn't feel authentic.
28;Thankfully we have the great Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci (who subsequently won an Oscar for his role) along with Ray Liotta (in, no doubt, his finest role) bringing the players in the film to life so naturally.
29;coated, and the film is the better for it.
30;Of course, it helps with a solid supporting cast that includes Paul Sorvino, Lorraine Bracco, and Frank Sivero.
31;the film is no doubt violent and brutal, but is delivered with a touch of class as only Martin Scorsese can bring to the game.
32;This film alone is a testament to his status as one of America's finest film.
33;Conjuring up images that will stay with you long after your first viewing, Scorsese makes the ultra.
34;Helping to commit the film to memory is a brilliant soundtrack of popular tunes that spans three decades and serves as a stunning example of popular music used effectively in cinema.
35;If you remember one thing about Goodfellas, it may very well be Eric Clapton's Layla and the grisly and haunting images that accompany it.
36;without a doubt, Goodfellas is one of the finest mob films ever made and, at the very least, is certainly one of Scorsese's best.
37;From the cast to the music and everything in between, it is complete, sweet and sensational perfection.
38;View it, and you'll see why it was such a smashing success and why it is still considered a classic almost 20 years later.
39;This is a classic mob story with a great cast and superb acting.
40;And to know that Henry Hill was a real mobster only makes the story better.
41;One of the greatest movie ever made.
42;It's Funny, sad and serious at times.
43;The casting is great and work awesome together.
44;This is a move that I would watch over and over again
45;Scorcese is the master of the genre.
46;This is the way the real mob works, with the guys on the streets, not the man at the top.
47;Masterful performances by all involved.
48;Lorraine Bracco is gorgeous in this movie.
49;Even if it is much too long, this movie is perhaps MARTIN SCORSESE's best directing job in all departments.
50;some incredible set pieces assembled by a masterful director.
51;lORRAINE BRACO is sexy and funny
52;Directing, acting, everything in it was done well.
53;If you liked the first 2 Godfather movies, you will love this one.
54;One of my favorite movies of all time.
55;If you are interested in the time that the movie takes place or just the mafia this is a great movie from acting to story
56;Martin Scorcese, one of the most talented directors of his generation, delivered what many believe to be the finest gangster movie of all time.
57;gangster society in which he is raised, Hill begins to favor the celebrity lifestyle lived by the well.
58;The film, which took place in New York City, won numerous Academy Award nominations.
59;Joe Pesci, who played the enraged Tommy Devito, walked away with the award for best supporting actor.
60;Robert DeNiro added another astonishing performance to his marvelous acting career by playing the respected, but hostile Jimmy Conway.
61;He uses Hill to portray the typical, New York kid, born to hard.
62;Scorcese also introduces the viewers to the deranged DeVito, whose idea of being a gangster is more extreme than that of Hill's, as he uses his power to become a sick, murdering maniac.
63;The film describes the importance of such power in the gangsters' lifestyles.
64;The film, which many believe to be the finest mob movie ever, feeds the viewer with adequate information about the lives of gangsters.
65;The film also teaches the audience about the flow of immigration and the tremendous impact it had on America then and even now.
66;The film in all aspects is notably unequivocal and will continue to progress in fame.
67;This will go down as an all time favorite for anyone who likes De Niro and Joe P. as well as Ray L. the entire cast was perfect for this movie.
68;But it does give you a very realistic view of gangland at its best.
69;Goodfellas is a timeless classic!
70;One of the best mob movies ever produced!
71;This is a must see for anyone who enjoys mob movies!
72;This is without a doubt the best movie about life in the mafia that I have seen.
73;Probably Scorsese's best film as well.
74;This film is full of unforgettable scenes and dialogue.
75;Masterful film making from Scorsese.
76;An amazing story about life in the italian mafia and an incredible movie!!!
77;The story line is well done
78;Claimed by many as one of the greatest films of all time!
79;And, one of Martin Scorses's best films to date!
80;His movies have characters that are real .
81;But this is something that has always been said about Scorsese.
82;His talent for making characters that seem real .
83;The screenplay written by Nicholas Pileggi and Scorsese himslef, is truly Oscar worthy.
84;The acting by Robert De Niro ( Jimmy Conway), Ray Liotta (Henry Hill), Joe Pesci (We should all know by now, he won an Oscar for this role playing Tommy DeVito) Lorraine Bracco (Karen Hill), and Paul Sorvino ( Paulie Cicero) is amazing to watch!
85;Every detail about this film is perfect.
86;This is a movie all movie fans have to watch.
87;The very good acting and story line.
88;Keep up the good work.
89;This movie is the best I've seen yet.
90;The characters are classic bad guys and the movie keeps you interested.
91;Very good movie if u like slow old school gangster movies such as the godfather and American gangster.
92;Don't know how much is fact and how much is fiction, but this movie tells the story of a group of 1960's New York mobsters in fine fashion.
93;A great, lighthearted retelling with an excellent flair for humor of a lifestyle that was anything but a joke to these men and their significant others.
94;DeNiro and Pesci are at their best.
95;If you haven't seen it, see it now.
96;there's a lot) do an excellent job in their rolls.
97;I was especially impressed with Ray Liotta and Lorraine Bracco (who's one of my favorite actresses) as Henry and Karen Hill.
98;Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and Paul Sorvino are equally superb in the parts they play too.
99;Even the lesser characters and people in the background give it their all.
100;The music fits perfectly with each and every scene.
101;One of the best movies ever.
102;Director Martin Scorcese is a genius film maker.
103;It's a must see for anyone who has seen 10 times or more.
104;Have always loved this movie, incredible acting and superb story.
105;You can always expect great things from Robert De Niro.
106;It's one of my favorite movies, although the language is very strong (the f word is repeated over and over), but it's such an interesting story that I love the movie anyway.
107;It has some violence (after all, it's about the Mafia), but it also has some humor.
108;I'm not much of a fan of wiseguys or mob movies, but Goodfellas is fantastic!
109;one of the best mob movies ever, especially since it's based on a true story!
110;Even better than another of my favorites, The Godfather.
111;This movie has got to be one of the finest crime dramas ever made.
112;Its realistic, and its gritty, the actors and actresses all do a fine job.
113;The viscious nature that he expresses is truly frightening.
114;The films ending shows the illusion that they have been living.
115;Film making at its finest, If you like mob type movies this is a must have.
116;i love all the andoactors in this movie.
117;Al pacino is missen and.
118;The 3rd star, Ray Liotta also did a great job on this film.
119;This is a classic well worth owning in blu.
120;This is the best true mob movie ever made!
121;Joe Pesci is amazing and got a well deserved Oscar for is performance.
122;Robert Di Niro and Ray Liotta also are awesome as well!
123;For one thing it is a true story and really exposes the sleezy side of the mob but it is also very cool.
124;Just that long drawn out scene when Henry and Karen go into the restaurant the back way on their first date is just amazing because it is done in all one shot!
125;I can honestly say I have seen this movie well over 80 times, maybe a hundred and it is always entertaining.
126;The dialogue, especially Joe Pesci's (Tommy) part is great.
127;DeNiro (Jimmy the Gent) really shows why he is an all time favorite and Ray Liotta (Henry) is great as a newcomer which he was in this movie and I have always wondered why he didn't go on to great things after this.
128;This movie is a drama but it also has a lot of humor in it too.
129;He gets every single detail right with clothing, sets, and cars!
130;I did enjoy the Henry Hill commentary and thats about it.
131;For one thing it is a true story and really exposes the sleezy side of the mob but it is also very cool.
132;Just that long drawn out scene when Henry and Karen go into the restaurant the back way on their first date is just amazing because it is done in all one shot!
133;I can honestly say I have seen this movie well over 80 times, maybe a hundred and it is always entertaining.
134;The dialogue, especially Joe Pesci's (Tommy) part is great as a sociopathic madman.
135;This movie is a drama but it also has a lot of humor in it too.
136;He gets every single detail right with clothing, sets, and cars!
137;I did enjoy the Henry Hill commentary and thats about it.
138;Great cast, one of the best mobster movies ever made.
139;Great moive and the acting was for the record books!I would recommend this moive to someone who likes the mob type moives!
140;Another great movie to own.
141;Anyone who loves movies like this has to own it.
142;Great price for a classic blu.
143;i know now that I was an idiot.
144;martin Scorsese is known for his gritty gangster films (although I much prefer his films like `Taxi Driver' and `Raging Bull') and with that in mind one must come to an appreciation for `GoodFellas', which is in all honestly Scorsese's finest gangster film.
145;The opening sequence, with De Niro, Liotta and Pesci driving out into the woods with a body in the trunk of the car, is priceless
146;It classically captures the ruthlessness of these men in their aspirations of power, money and most of all, respect.
147;`GoodFellas' tells the true story of Henry Hill, an Irish/Italian who rose up in the mafia ranks beginning in the 50's and carrying through to 1980 when he entered the witness protection program.
148;Hill meets and marries the beautiful Karen and begins to build a life for his newfound family that revolves around murder, extortion and drugs.
149;I often see `GoodFellas' compared to `Casino', the large majority standing by `GoodFellas' as the superior film and yet a small yet sturdy group contesting that `Casino' is the finer film.
150;While `GoodFellas' gets off to a slow start, once it gets going it is flawless and its highs are enormously rewarding.
151;the one facet of `GoodFellas' that is the strongest to me is the incredible performances by the entire cast, especially the four stars.
152;Ray Liotta delivers his finest performance to date as Henry Hill.
153;I am not a huge fan of Liotta, but his portrayal of wiseguy Hill is flawlessly accurate and dedicated.
154;He's matched by Robert De Niro who beautifully settles into supporting territory as Jimmy Conway.
155;It's nice to see a major star like De Niro allow another actor to take the limelight when you know that he could have easily devoured it for himself.
156;The two major standouts here are Joe Pesci and Lorraine Bracco though, two actors who come into their own in this film and deliver heartfelt and moving performances.
157;His performance is so natural and charismatic it feels as though he isn't even acting.
158;Bracco plays Karen, Hill's wife, and she does so with accurate and realistic intensity.
159;As she struggles to wrap her head around her husband's lifestyle, the drugs, money and women, she creates a woman who is understandable and sympathetic.
160;scorsese knows how to capture a mood, an era and most importantly, our interest.
161;He has delivered to us monumental classics and `GoodFellas' rests near the top as one of his finest contributions to American cinema.
162;`GoodFellas' is a smart and engaging film about the highs and lows of the gritty way of life, exposing the emotional and physical damage done to those that engage in this lifestyle.
163;one of the best movies ever made and directed by a master at the peak of his power and passion.
164;This is an extraordinary movie.
165;it takes an outstanding director to make something like this: the film is very long and at the same time it keeps you wishing it was even longer.
166;The soundtrack is formidably, breathtakingly good, and the cast is exquisite.
167;DeNiro is unsurpassed in his ability to portray this lifestyle.
168;Joe Pesci is fantastic and the psycopathic sidekick.
169;Ray Liotta delivers a great performance as real life mobster wannabe Henry Hill.
170;I have not received the disc yet but I'm sure it will live up to all expectations.
171;Im not that familiar with the mob but this is the best movie.
172;This is quiet literally, one of the very few movies I can sit and watch over and over.
173;With a personal viewing figure now standing at well above 50 times.
174;you can imagine how highly I rate this.
175;ray Liotta, Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci are fantastic together.
176;Ray Liotta's character seemed to think living the gangsters life was fantastic, at first.
177;One of my all time favorite movies!
178;One of Robert De Niro's best roles.
179;Funny as heck, fascinating, thoroughly riveting.
180;and the gangsters are even likable!
181;Joe Pesci plays the most memorable lowlife ever in film history
182;A li'l bit, a li'l bit.
183;All in all, a great film.
184;What was especially more authentic was the fun that these criminals had as they whacked folks.
185;Of course, what makes GODFATHER 1 and 2 among the greatest movies of all time is the superb plots that grip you all the way.
186;After seeing GOODFELLAS (for the third time!)
187;If you've seen GOODFELLAS, by all means read the book: it tells you more.
188;The real life story by Pileggi has a much more satisfying ending, which is worth quoting in part: Today Henry Hill and his wife live somewhere in America.
189;As of this writing he has a successful business and lives in a $150,000 two.
190;He and Karen have their own cars, and she has embarked on a small business of her own.
191;He has a Keogh plan.
192;Thanks to the government for which he works, Henry Hill has turned out to be the ultimate wiseguy.
193;It is wonderful to be able to stream a classic movie for free with my Amazon Prime membership.
194;I'll bring the knife back.
195;It's the classic tale of how Henry Hill always wanted to be a gangster.
196;It's one of those movies that is not only a classic, but should have won the 1990 Best Picture Oscar.
197;Brutal, shocking and true, Goodfellas is cinema at best.
198;martin Scorcese directs and Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci lead the pack of an amazing bunch talented actors in this tale of notorious gangster turned rat Henry Hill (played with a quiet ferocity by Liotta).
199;He meets veteran criminal Jimmy The Gent Conway (Robert De Niro) and the wacko Tommy De Vito (Joe Pesci, who was brilliant).
200;As the years go on, the stakes get higher, these Goodfellas come closer to getting caught every day.
201;Eventually, justice reigns, and the price is paid.
202;this film is truly a masterpiece.
203;It's by far Scorcese's best film, and the actors have rarely been better.
204;Pesci deserved his Oscar, because he stole the show from everyone.
205;This is a film that everyone should see at least once.
206;The movie Goodfellas gives a great account of life in the mob.
207;The movie told from the character Henry played by Ray Liotta perspective, it gives you an insight of three decades of moblife.
208;italian boy who dreamed about being in the mafia and how he actually got a chance to do so.
209;The wonderful friendship between Jimmy played by Robert De Niro, Tommy played by Joe Pesci, and Henry as they grew up from petty crimes to big time heist.
210;Henry who at this time has turn into crack head struggles to stay alive.
211;disc set was so that I could enjoy the film in my native language (spanish).
212;Now that to me is great customer service.
213;I chose another great Scorsese/DeNiro title.
214;The film is brutal, ruthless and clever.
215;Director's work is brilliant, maybe one of the best by Scorcese, the cast is outstanding .
216;Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Ray Liotta and many others (many of them you could later see in The Sopranos).
217;Part of the film's charm is that many scenes were ad.
218;What's also interesting is that the movie is based on actual events and on memoirs of the real mafioso Henry Hill (who is played by Liotta here).
219;By the way the disc has a commentary track by Hill so you can hear how it all happened in real life.
220;one of the greatest mob movies, one of the greatest movies in general.
221;A great film that deserves a new transfer.
222;ray, the studios are cutting corners and, with many titles, re.
223;Fantastic movie, will watch it again and again.
224;If you like Deniro and Pesci, you will be in love with their performance.
225;This was a great deal for $5.49 and FREE SHIPPING!
226;This is one of the best cast ever assembled in hollywood.
227;And then there's Ray Liotta, the first movie where I took notice of him, and Robert De Niro, who had another great film that year (Awakenings).
228;Together with the rest of the cast, and under the meticulous direction of Martin Scorsese, this team is explosive.
229;This is, in my opinion, the best film about organized crime.
230;One of Scorsese's best movies.
231;joe Pesci is great as an out an out criminal and killer.
232;ray Liotta at his best and who can name a movie in which R. DeNirowas not good.
233;But nevertheless it's a great movieand maybe one of the best mob movies ever.
234;The acting is terrific, albeit bloody!
235;This is a classic movie with an all star cast.
236;Particularly interesting given the recent arrest.
237;The Movie Goodfellas is probably the BEST gangster movie I have ever seen!
238;Only because it is based on a true story and it has a wonderful storyline!
239;Robert DeNiro and Ray Liotta are absolutly BRILLANT in this movie!
240;The music is always wonderful I haven't seen a movie this good with a great soundtrack to back it up!
241;This movie is wondeful the actors are brilliant and the storyline is GREAT!
242;I hope everyone takes the time to see this movie !
243;Its a classic that ranks up with the Godfather Trilogy
244;This is a great movie depicting the life of real life gangster Henry Hill from running errands as an early teen for mob kingpin Pauly, in 1955, to his drug dealings of the 70's, to his eventual entrance into the witness protection program in 1980.
245;The film features great performances by Joe Pesci and Robert DeNero, reallistic mafia acts, and 2 beatdowns that rival sonny's beating of his brother.
246;Viewed: 11/03, 2/07, 5/10, 12/13Rate: 102/07: The introduction of Goodfellas immediately lets the audience know that they are in for a ride.
247;I still feel this way after seventeen years when I first saw the picture in a theater.
248;hitting picture because of its momentum and taut, stylish narration.
249;Thanks to the amazing performance of Ray Liotta, Martin Scorsese is able to craft a better gangster picture than The Godfather.
250;More importantly, Scorsese proves that he is one of the craftiest story tellers and most stylish directors.
251;While the nature of the content is disturbing, it's immensely provocative.
252;All in all, Goodfellas is a true Scorsese picture.5/10: The first two minutes of Goodfellas is what sets the tone for the rest of the film.
253;Unquestionably, Goodfellas is the best gangster picture made, effectively obliterating the perch that The Godfather has stood on.
254;What I love the most about the movie is the rawness that comes with it, and that is done most effectively by Ray Liotta.
255;I believe that he actually makes Goodfellas the film it is.
256;The story moves fast followed by a cascade of terrific scenes.
257;Robert De Niro's minimized supporting role is also fascinating because, let's be frank, it's Robert De Niro and he makes most of his time, giving a special performance.
258;All in all, Goodfellas has aged very well.
259;All of the actors in this movie are excellent, especially Robert DeNiro.
260;If you like mob movies, you'll love this one.
261;This film is a seemingly realistic portrayal of life in the mid ranks of the Mafia.
262;The acting by the ensemble cast is incredible.
263;I had to see it as it was one of my grandson's favorite movies.
264;Great cast, but Peschi steals the show.
265;Definitely a must see for anyone who loves Mob movies or true stories.
266;Well Robert De Niro is an amazing actor and Scorsese is an amazing director so you should watch this.
267;I forgot to mention everything else is just amazing too.
268;This was a really good movie.
269;i would recommend this movie to anyone.
270;it has a great cast!This movie came quickly and the ordering process was easy and fast.
271;it came in the condition I ordered it(new).
272;This is one of my favorite mob movies of all.
273;The acting is great, as well as the direction.
274;Martin Scorsece is a genius!
275;I would definitely recommend this release to any new or old fans of the movie.
276;It made you care about what was going on.
277;Fantastic story, every character is well developed as humans and psychos.
278;This movie is an every other year must.
279;Watch the movie that launched The Sopranos series.
280;anything with this cast and Scorcese would have to be a classic and filled with great music.
281;Scorcese films have the best music!
282;One of my favorite movies.
283;Paul Sorvino is a great Boss.
284;Liotta gives a great performance, probably his best in years.
285;funny, disturbing, gory at times, and best of all getting to see Lorraine Bracco in her prime!!!
286;The characters are memorable and, in many cases, hilarious.
287;The film is fast paced and has a great score.
288;I actually went out and bought a blu.
289;Spent $130 bucks on it, and it still wouldn't play.
290;The sequel to Casio great service price and deliver would look to use them again ordering on line is easy
291;I also can be very funny too.
292;It is one of the better movies
293;DeNiro, Pesci and Liotta deliver strong performances of a. So.
294;getting made:how a movie classic hit the streets, made men:the Goodfellas legacy, film maker's comments on the movie's influence, and the working day gangster which looks at the less glamorous side of mob life.
295;This movie lives up to it's billing as the best mob movie ever made, and will be around for years to come wowing viewers with it's raw intensity.
296;I always laugh how 90% of my dumb friends still think Scarface is a great gangster movie.
297;Scorsese knows how to make a movie go from great to perfect.
298;He's still the best director that ever walked this earth if you are looking at the crafting of movie.
299;This is one of the top ten movies ever made.
300;Best mob movie by far.
301;Beats the pants off the Godfather, which was also a great flick.
302;This is one of the greatest films to ever be made in the history of movies.
303;This movie is a truly powerful mobster movie.
304;It is a hardcore action movie with all of the greatest features of a mafia movie.
305;It is the second greatest gangster movie of all time, behind the rather large shadow of The Godfather.
306;Joe Pesci is definitly the motivating comedic force behind this awesome movie, while DeNiro and Liota offer some great action scenes.
307;This is the classic based on the truth violent mafia in America movie from which you can use your own judgement as to which parts were real.
308;It is very well acted and I found it to be very entertaining.
309;The other two movies were great dramatic pieces, but this movie is just to damn cool.
310;First of all the pacing is beautiful.
311;The quick cuts add a ton to the movie.
312;Next is my all time favorite actor Robert De Niro.
313;Though in a smaller part than in other Scorcese pictures, he still puts in a good performance.
314;Joe Pesci is also great as Tommy DeVito rightfully won the best supporting actor award.
315;so if you like the Sopranos or any other gangster movie see Goodfellas.
316;The quintessential story of all time, Scorsese delivers a film that deserved much more recognition.
317;The direction is superb, form the freeze frames and voice over to the classic cafe conversation betwen Henry and Jimmy, paving the way for the De Niro Pacino showndown in Heat.
318;Joe Pesci won an Oscar for his role as pychotic Tommy, but the award could have easily gone to De Niro for his bustling dealing Jimmy Conway.
319;Pilleggi's story is a masterpiece, convereted to the screen by the greatest living filmaker and should rightly be considered as a defining moment of our generation.
320;scorcese is my favorite director but i don't even think this is one of his top 5 movies.
321;the godfathers bit rate is mid to high 20's while goodfellas is 9 MBPM.
322;I never quite understood this whole deal of walking in to a pizza place and seeing paintings of gangsters on the wall.you know, those big oils with the Godfather guys, Scarface, and the guys from Goodfellas.
323;hill is smart as a whip and soon gets drafted.
324;He gets to park cars, hang with the gamblers.
325;what works so well about Goodfellas is the film does not give the crime or the violence an air of tragity or judgement.
326;It sneeks up on us as much as it does Hill, and in the end, we realize what gets paid when we Scorcessee pulls the planks from under.
327;This film is a real gem, and deserves to be in the top 10 movies of the 1990's, the cast is 'untouchable' and there is not a weak point I can find in the whole movie.
328;IT IS THE BEST MOB MOVIE and you love the characters and the soundtrack to alot of the scenes is absolutely perfect in every way in which they meant it to be for it to sound during those times.
329;A classic, gripping film with an amazing cast and fantastic camera work.
330;Heck, even the music is awesome.
331;This is by far the best Mob movie of all time its timeless .
332;a very accurate account of thins with some drama mixed in for good measure.
333;Also, shows the benefits of being a mob guy like eating well in large prison cells, and front reserved tables at the Copacabana with no tabs.
334;cast and characters you have Ray Liotta who does an awesome job playing Henry Hill, as Hill also gave credit to Liotta himself in a documentary.
335;Hill also gave, one of the world's greatest actors, Robert De Niro, a great deal of credit for his portayal of Jimmy Conway, a good mob earner.
336;Pesci did a terrific job and was my favorite character throughout the movie cause you never knew what he was going to do next.
337;what I love most about this movie is you really get that feeling of what it was like in the fifties and seventies, and that unforgettable music that will really attract your attention.
338;Also, you can choose an audio option where the real Henry Hill is given commentary throughout the whole movie, and tells his experience of the moment of every scene in his own words which was very entertaining.
339;Good movie with a great cast of characters.
340;A little gruesome at points for the faint of heart, but I really enjoyed it and have watched it many times.
341;It has to stand as one of the 100 best films of all time (at least in my list).
342;As far as Blu Ray goes, this is much improved over my original flipper 2.
343;But when the film is sharp, the transfer is perfect.
344;up of a young Henry Hill looking out the window of his apartment and you can see the details of what looks like a green contact lens (to match Liotta I suppose).
345;Worth replacing an older version (not sure if this applies to the newer collecters edition or not.
346;by the way, one fun part of watching this movie is picking out all the Soprano's characters that were in this film.
347;Essential gangster drama loaded with humor.
348;Will make you realize all of the classic lines you have probably heard in normal conversation withoout a movie reference.
349;I love Ray Liotta for me this is his best movie role.
350;and Mr. De Niro and Joe Pesci are a classic in this movie.
351;Great movie with a good cast of characters.
352;This is a complete masterpiece, Scorsese's best film and undoubtedly a timeless classic.
353;what makes this film so good?
354;The casting is absolutely flawless.
355;GoodFellas also moves with a certain energy which is totally uncommon in films.
356;It is so enthralling and completely entertaining that the first time I saw it I did not want it to stop.
357;Scorsese is fully in control and a total master of his art in this film.
358;The camera work is beautiful, the costumes are perfect and the soundtrack is wonderful as well.
359;never before have I seen a movie that gets everything so right.
360;Each time I watch GoodFellas I take away something new from it.
361;Casino , although many felt to be a retread, is actually just as good.
362;For anybody that doesn't know about this funny,dark and true to life movie it's about Henry Hill(played by Ray Liotta)a man that got involved in the New York Italian Mafia in the 1950's.
363;this movie not only lets you see the mob way of life but makes you feel whats going on through an amazing soundtrack that spans the decades.
364;this is the kind of film that you will watch 50 times over and still not get sick of it.
365;This is the best movie of all times.
366;I have watched it about 15 times and I could watch it 15 more it is one of my very favorites a great movie,
367;Goodfellas is most likly the best gangsta film around.
368;the story is great following the life of henry who always wanted to be a gangster and becomes one only to witness the highs and lows of a gangsta lifeThe Actors like de niro, peci and liota r all great, this is peci's best film, his character is great.
369;I was surprised when it started because I remembered the story from a long time ago.
370;The music is very good and I enjoyed the story again .
371;with the music this time.
372;I would do business with this place again in a New York minute.
373;This is probably my favorite gangster movie, and this blu.
374;ray really does it justice.
375;Great bargain, so grab one while you can.
376;Martin Scorsese's GOODFELLAS has a lift.
377;scorsese, who knows how to make images dance, really keeps up the heat in this film and he doesn't go for ironic detachment.
378;He loves the Brooklyn gang mileu, because it's where distortion, hyperbole, and exuberance all commingle.
379;is it a great film?
380;it's one of the best of it's genre.
381;It's a triumphant piece of filmmaking.
382;jounalism presented with the brio of drama.
383;Every frame is active and vivid, and you can feel the director's passion and delight in making these pictures move.
384;the moviemaking has such bravura that you respond as if your were at a live performance.
385;He came of age as a director in the early 70's, at a time when many film enthusiasts were caught up in the 60's idea that a great film or even a good one is always about its director.
386;There's a lot of metaphoric truth to this, but Scorsese puts the idea right up front.
387;scorsese makes you feel you'd like to hang out with him at a bar or coffee shop and listen to him tell how he brought off the effects
388;Love this movie and watch it at least once a year.
389;I would recommend it to anyone.
390;The special features are a nice touch.
391;One of my favorites since the first time my dad introduced me to it.
392;Come on Marty, give us a special edition!
393;A wonderful film that deserves better!
394;This movie is a true classic, but I'm not going to talk about it.
395;There are 413 other reviews that drool about how great Goodfellas is.
396;A 2.5 hour film fits easily onto a single.
397;He is one of the greatest living directors, for God's sake!
398;that brings me to my final thought.
399;THE MOVIE ITSELFThis movie is not only the best of the genre, but one of the best films ever made.
400;scorsese is at the top of his game here.
401;The use of popular music from every era that this film chronicles in each part is a high point.
402;Also, the full frontal graphic parts make this one of the greatest experiences ever.
403;this movie has a pulse and creates a timeless time on screen all its own.
404;It is the single most convincing, space subtraction between the human eye and the screen I have ever experienced.
405;this is a classic and it is only a decade old.
406;This is a classic film that should be presented in the latest technological advances.
407;I loved Cape Fear, I loved Casino.
408;His mind got all messed up.
409;If you like maffia movies, see Casino.
410;It's more exciting, dramatic, and watchable than Goodfellas.
411;I saw this movie years ago and thought it was one that someday I will own.
412;Goodfellas would have to be one of the most brilliantly pure interpretations of gangsters in the United States that I have ever seen.
413;de Niro's performance of the criminalistic Jimmy Conway gives the film a naturalistic power, purely describing many of the capabilities and needs of a gangster.
414;there are brilliant performances by all
415;Liotta is versatile in his role of Henry Hill, and Lorraine Bracco plays a gangster's wife with pure perfection.
416;All things aside, Goodfellas is a fantastic movie and is one to stand the test of time for many years to come.
417;This film is worth watching many times.
418;I give it 5 stars.
419;This is the best mob film ever!A true standout among the genre(maybe better than GODFATHER).
420;Joe Pesci steals every scene.
421;brenda Vacarro and Ray Liotta are perfect!Paul Sorvino's performance is so convincing it is scary!
422;this leads me to believe that it's probably just the presentation and the realism.
423;i guess it's just what the director is acclaimed for,.
424;in the end, though, it is a classic in my mind, and one i can watch again and again without tiring.
425;In this film, Robert DeNiro, the greatest actor of all time, is teamed with Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci, whom he worked with in Raging Bull.
426;The movie is told as a narrative from Liotta's character's, Henry Hill, point of view.
427;The musical selection is excellent, as is the camerawork.
428;The use of zooms and slow motion makes some of the best camera shots ever.
429;There is an interesting incorporation of the song Layla by Derek and the Dominos.
430;The directing is awesome, and the acting is phenomenal.
431;winning performance for Best Supporting Actor, is the testy Tommy Davito.
432;Also Oscar nominated, is Lorraine Bracco, now of the Sopranos, as Liotta's wife.
433;Paul Sorvino also is very critical to the film's success.
434;A five star film, this is a must see.
435;Director Martin Scorsese, who grew up in the same neighborhoods as the characters in his film, captures onscreen the most creditble crime story ever told.
436;Unfolding over the course of three decades, the movie tells the story of Henry Hill, a mid.
437;The movie is bursting with memorable characters
438;thief, Paul Sorvino as the head of the family.
439;This is the best movie from one of America's greatest directors.
440;everyone in this film is great.
441;This has been my favorite movie for such a long time, and it never loses it's appeal!
442;Recommend to anyone who likes mafia/mob movies!
443;Hmm well, I can only put this in five words:A classic and must see!
444;Absolutely one of the best mafia movies of all time.
445;Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci do an amazing job on screen bringing these characters to life.
446;Martin Scorsese's masterpiece is one to be cherished, valued, and especially enjoyed over and over again.
447;That WiseGuys has NOTHING on GOODFELLAS!
448;Goodfellas is more than a movie.
449;heartbreaking conclusion, the mob has you in the palm of their hands.
450;The plot is so intricate and vast, that it would be impossible to go through it in its entirety.
451;All of this is amazingly pulled together by one of the finest filmmakers of our time, Martin Scorsese(co. writer/Director).
452;Above all other scenes and situations beautifully filmed, none can compare to Scorsese's coup de cinema tracking shot.
453;It is a testament to the fact that Scorsese's genius and talent is beyond compare.
454;The opening Tony Bennett number Rags to Riches sets the tone immediately for the amazing film which has already begun, and the soundtrack is a must.
455;Personal favorite: the rock n' roll blasting as the camera closes in on Robert DeNiro smoking his cigarette only the way DeNiro can.
456;The cast is amazing, with Robert DeNiro giving a great performance.
457;Ray Liotta is electrifying as Henry Hill.
458;Oscar winner Joe Pesci walked home with the Best Supporting Actor Academy Award for his Tommy, and Lorraine Bracco's strong.
459;willed Karen was honored by a nomination and a great performance.
460;The scene in which Henry, Tommy, and Jimmy end up at her house looking for a shovel to bury the man they nearly beat do death in the trunk, she comes down and fixes each man a meal in one of the funniest scenes in the film.
461;Yes, funny, what makes this film so great is that there is a great deal of humor and it eases the tension of the viewer with a weak stomach.
462;Goodfellas was nominated for six Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director, and was named Best Picture by the NY and LA Film Critics Association and the National Film Board Review.
463;It is absolutely one of the best films ever made, and it stands mighty as number 95 on AFI's 100 best films of all time, being placed among Platoon, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Casablanca, The Godfather, Citizen Kane, and Gone With The Wind.
464;Joe Pesci won an Oscar for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for his part in GoodFellas, a film nominated for six Academy Awards overall including Best Picture.
465;And every accolade attributed to this film is well deserved.
466;star cast of performers, GoodFellas is one of director Martin Scorsese's greatest productions.
467;GoodFellas follows the life of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), an Irish.
468;He has many friends .
469;Now, each man must figure out for himself which direction his life will take.
470;raw and blunt in its pronouncements, GoodFellas easily holds its own with some of the greatest films of all time.
471;Like any good story, it brings the audience into an unknown world of mystery and seduction.
472;The audience begins to feel the tension along with the characters in the film.
473;That's the mark of a great movie.
474;liotta, Pesci, and De Niro all stand out in this epic drama about one man's life as a professional criminal.
475;When taking an objective view, GoodFellas stacks up as one of the 100 greatest movies of all time, and it certainly merits the designation of must.
476;This is a classic movie and everyone should own it.
477;pesci , Liotta and Deniro are stellar performers in this classic mobster type movie.
478;It's a prototype from Japan and it's the best in the world.
479;I'm deeply disappointed and very disturbed by this trashy release of a very good film.
480;Scorsese has such a great collection of films under his belt and this is top of the line as his others are.
481;The acting, filming sequences and story are all wonderfully done.
482;GoodFellas is the best gangster that I have ever seen.
483;The acting is superb and the story is compelling and entertaining.
484;I recommend this movie to everyone.
485;A movie of this magnitude (#29 all time IMDb) deserves better treatment than this!
486;I watch this movie now and again, what a great cast , and story based on fact by Henry Hill( Recently passed away)
487;life story of mobster Henry Hill, and it is largely true, although there are individual scenes that are out of sequence and others that were added for dramatic effect, such as Karen Hill flushing the cocaine down the toilet during the drug bust.
488;Also, Tommy, the character that Joe Pesci played and the part for which he won an Oscar, was actually a composite of two separate gangsters.
489;Thus, masterful direction of the story by Martin Scorsese in what was probably his finest film is why the audience has a more cohesive view of the mobsters portrayed in this movie than if we had been told every last detail.
490;This has to be one of the best movies in the mob/gangster genre.
491;All star cast with a well balanced story line of riches and woes from the perspective of an insider.
492;Good action tire real life, just like if happen today.
493;I ordered this item very close to Christmas.
494;It was still a very fast delivery and the price was perfect.
495;And of course, Goodfellas is awesome!
496;disc Special Edition and descriptions of the special features on the back.
497;You will notice that he still claims I got what I ordered.
498;Its a true story about the mobster Henry Hill, and his associates in the Lucchese Crime Family.
499;fiction, this is a must for you.
500;Scorcese's rich cinematic vision is a perfect complement to the script.
501;Love the stars and the action.
502;All actors did a really good job, there are some great shots of Brooklyn and the plot and story are well done.
503;I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone interested in portrayals of the mafia.
504;True stories, filmed in true location, are the best.
505;This is the story of Henry Hill and his life, as an outsider, with the mafia.
506;Joe Pesci got the Award as Best Supporting Actor.
507;Dialogue from the film is classic and quoted many times.
508;Period music throughout the movie works splendidly.
509;i love this movie so much that I sent a copy to my nephew.
510;i watch it every chance I get.
511;so nice to watch it again, it is in perfect condition and it was a gift that was greatly appreciated.
512;This is a mobster classic!
513;One of Scorsese's best mob movies!
514;A wild ride of a movie that mixes the highs and the lows of being a mobster.
515;The soundtrack adds greatly to the enjoyment.
516;A very good movie if you're not offended by F. bombs.
517;This is a great movie no matter how many times you see.
518;Goodfellas was a fantastic start for the cinema of the 1990s, and has not dated itself in any way.
519;over narration which Nicholas Pileggi and Scorsese hammered out of Henry Hill's memoir is humorous and observant, and Ray Liotta's reading of it utterly natural.
520;To me, watching actors entirely inhabit their roles makes the most spectacular CGI.
521;Especially impressive is Paul Sorvino's Paulie Cicero, whose subtle expressions and mannerisms are amusing as hell all throughout the film.
522;All the major cast are fantastic, but even those in the secondary roles are vivid, like Frank Vincent as a paroled mobster who gets done in by a senseless and spectacular act of petty revenge, or Chuck Low as Morrie the Wigmaker, whose constant nagging of master criminal Jimmy Conway (de Niro) for his cut of a big score grinds the latter down (not a person you want to bug even once).
523;Goodfellas contains scene after scene of brilliant acting, perfect period music choices, a narrative which is both illuminating and suspenseful (even though the film has a very loose, episodic feel).
524;This is an American classic and it's not just for mob film fans.
525;Joe Pesci in his finest performance.
526;You feel his childhood fascination with the Wiseguys, you feel his rise in the Mob, and you feel his descent.
527;This is a classic movie.
528;The movie has excellent direction and a superb cast.
529;Watch out for Michael Imperioli (Christopher Multisante of The Sopranos) in a bit role that is memorable.
530;The movie is by turns very intense and funny.
531;Any fan of gangster/mafia films with love this movie!!!
532;Haven't seen this since it was in the theater, but boy does it hold up it fantastically in terms of capturing a time, place, and a life.
533;you go through the decades and realize the way it was then seems so innocent compared to the gang/cartel life of today.
534;The acting is superb, the camera.
535;work is pure Scorsese, and the music .
536;gives the movie the energy of the time (shifting from late '50s to late '70s) and the feeling of feature.
537;This is a classic crime/mob movie.
538;The wardrobe is stunningly spectacular.
539;The scenery, automobiles, and other details are exceptional.
540;This movie is a must see and must own.
541;Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci are simply the best!!!
542;one of the best mob movies made.
543;An absolute joy to watch.
544;Filled with amazing performances and a compelling narrative this stands out as one of the best movies ever.
545;One of the best films I've seen in regards to the mafia, to me, this film is better than the Godfather in that it plays it straight.
546;This is a great ground floor for every every fan of this genre.
547;This film has been hailed as a masterpiece in the Mafia Genre of movies.
548;For what this movie is, it's great entertainment.
549;Goodfellas is such a good movie that I wish I could rate it than 5 stars.
550;This movies is a classic and is not only a great crime thiller but also a great movie under any genre.
551;Goodfellas features the amazing acting of Robert Deniro.
552;goodfellas is a 1990 American crime film directed by Martin Scorsese.
553;The movie features the great acting of Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Lorraine Bracco, and Paul Sorvino.
554;Goodfellas was nominated for the Academy Award in the following categories: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Film Editing, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Supporting Actress, and Best Supporting Actor (Joe Pesci, who won).
555;i enjoyed this movie and would definitely recommend it.
556;thank you for reading my review.
557;If you've ever seen him in Stanley and Iris, you know that he is much more believable as a good man who just wants to read with Jane Fonda.
558;Also, Joe Pesci is really great as the short mafiaman in this movie.
559;I love My Cousin Vinny, and I don't believe Joe Pesci had to say any bad words to make that movie hilarious.
560;This is one of the must see movies of that era.
561;Music is superb, you will want the soundtrack.
562;Thanks to those who do this.
563;I give it about an 8.0 to 8.5 on a 10.0 scale.
564;But, there was good left / right separation.
565;this is a pretty good movie, which lasted about 2 hours and 21 minutes.
566;Amazon is my new favorite store!
567;GoodFellas is one of my 6 favorite movies.
568;There's violence, heist, lil bit of humor, and raw emotion.
569;The thing that sets this mob movie apart from the rest is the fact that it's realistic.
570;Everybody in this film did a phenomenal job.
571;Goodfellas is one of the best movies of all time.
572;Peschi's performance, while often lampooned, is still searing in it's psychotic roller.
573;Liotta gives the most remarkable performance ever caught on film of the throes of drug.
574;The performances make this movie worth multiple watchings.
575;is NOT worth your time.
576;this is an all time great.
577;It was good to see the movie the way it was made.
578;This is my favorite movie of all time.
579;I have seen it, literally, about 10 times in the last 9 months.
580;The scenes in this movie are very vivid
581;i'm having trouble getting across how wonderful I think this movie is.
582;It was odd but I remember that my dad had a massive VHS collection and starting to become a film freak, I decided to watch a whole lot from Godfather 1.3 to Schindler's List to this one.
583;It's funny how little I actually remembered of them.
584;Recently I decided to check it out and again and it was as great as I knew it was the first time, what little I remembered of it anyway.
585;the film, based on a true story, follows Henry Hill who gets involved with the mafia.
586;The only thing it's got in common is the whole mafia angle, that and Robert De Niro, who was in Part II.
587;Godfather is about showing the inner workings of the top brass of the families, this film's more about the soldiers, the so. called muscle who do all the jobs and handle the business personally.
588;wise it's solid across the board.
589;Well Scorsese is a huge fan of Robert De Niro, off the top of my head I count Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Goodfellas, the King of Comedy, Mean Streets, New York New York and Cape Fear.
590;Wow, lot of movies, good luck charm or just easy casting?
591;Not to fear, he's reliable and he's great here too.
592;Perfect at first but then goes more and more crazy until her craziness matches Henry's.
593;Everybody else is great too, including a too.
594;This is a film that Scorsese should have won the Oscar for, not The Departed.
595;The story is based on the real.
596;this film really established Joe Pesci and Ray Liotta as solid actors.
597;With Robert De Niro and Lorraine Bracco, the cast was just perfect.
598;The acting was great all around and the plot was very entertaining.
599;anyway, as I said, the plot is entertaining and this is a film you could watch more than once.
600;The characters are interesting and the humor is appropriate.
601;wonderful picture but the sound and tone were muffled.
602;Kept me interested even though it was long !
603;they have the best cast that they could for this movie.
604;What is it that makes me so funny?
605;But the picture is very crisp!
606;And it's nice to watch the flick in widescreen even if it's non.
607;this film dissects for all the world to see the profound immorality and greediness of American life.
608;Classic movie with great actors and filmed in astoria.
609;One of those movies everyone should see.
610;Funny exciting and based in true story.
611;GoodFellas is a criminal epic that spans three decades while following the dramatic rise and fall of three gangsters through the eyes of one them.
612;The movie is also about addiction and how it not only draws the characters in but us as well.
613;We become addicted to the power of the film's style and visuals, which shows the seductive allure of the gangster lifestyle: to be able to do anything.
614;Comments from Martin Scorsese, actors Ray Liotta, Lorraine Bracco, Paul Sorvino and Frank Vincent, co. screenwriter Nicholas Pileggi, producers Irwin Winkler and Barbara De Fina, cinematographer Michael Ballhaus and editor Thelma Schoonmaker are edited together for select scenes thereby eliminating any dead air.
615;This is a factual based track that makes one appreciate the authenticity of Scorsese's film.
616;minute retrospective featurette that mixes brand new interviews with Liotta, Sorvino and Bracco with older ones from Scorsese, De Niro and Pesci.
617;The featurette acts as a nice companion piece to the commentaries.
618;The Workaday Gangster features the real Henry Hill and examines how authentic the film depicted his life and the lure of the gangster lifestyle.
619;one of the more entertaining featurettes is The GoodFellas Legacy which has several famous filmmakers gush about why they love the movie so much and what, in their opinion, makes it a great film.
620;Paper is Cheaper Than Film is a brief look at the annotations Scorsese made to the screenplay that he and Pileggi wrote together.
621;It became one of Scorsese's most successful and famous films since Taxi Driver.
622;Warner Brothers has finally done this classic movie justice with an excellent two.
623;Goodfellas is an absolute classic.
624;Robert De Niro's acting and character are perfection as in any movie he's in.
625;Goodfellas is a great movie that you will want to see over and over again.
626;I'll keep this short and simple:The Godfather is the best MAFIA movie ever.
627;goodfellas is the best MOB movie ever.
628;A classic movie that will be watched over and over.
629;For my Husband for Christmas, His Favorite Movie of all times.
630;Classic Scorsese at the top of his game.
631;This movie is wonderful and my favorite mobster movie, just wished i had got a copy i could watch from the Start, and not half way through.
632;Great movie and the blu ray added to my viewing experience.
633;The book was interesting and the extras are good.
634;Great movie, and outstanding performances by the full cast.
635;Just picked it up at Meijer for 10 bucks, thought that it was a great deal.
636;The representative was super friendly!
637;A contemporary classic stylishly directed by Martin Scorsese, it's among his finest two plus hours (and that's really saying something coming from the man who brought us Taxi Driver Raging Bull!)
638;stealing performance that won him the Oscar).
639;I urge fans of this movie to check out The King of Comedy (another DeNiro/Scorsese masterpiece).
640;Just a classic movie that everyone needs to see at least once during their life time.
641;Joe pesci Plays one of the most memorable charecters of his career (2nd only to my cusin vinny) HA!
642;every time, it gets better and to this day, Goodfellas still reigns as my favorite movie of all time.
643;I've seen quite a bit of movies as well!First of all, I love Henry's character.
644;Hardworking kid works his way up and eventually lands with the top dogs Pauly, Jimmy, and Tommy.
645;as the viewer, we're taken into quite an intense, sometimes laughable, and surreal ride.
646;I loved it when Henry and Jimmy simply rob a truck driver at gun point.
647;Who knew this type of stuff happens?I love this movie because it's so beautifully shot and told.
648;I love this movie because of the unique and believable characters.
649;I love this movie because it teaches us something in life: Ya can't always do things the cleanest of ways.
650;Good Fellas is a movie with everything working for it.
651;Taking in consideration for the director, actors, movie crew, script, editing, and what ever else you can look at in order to develop and over all critic a movie
652;A movie based on a single event in someone's life, yet depicting that moment in the classic Hollywood fashion in over exaggerating as well as substituting actuality with fiction.
653;beyond the above social interest in why a person may join the mob (and like this movie), there is still a fantastic romantic view provided along with it's harsh reality.
654;Good Fellas was written, directed, and edited wonderfully which could be used for up coming movie enthusiasts, or to just sit back and relax for pure entertainment value.
655;Clearly it is a favorite.
656;Not everything goes perfect in creating a movie, and even after post production there could still be little pieces or trivial aspects that do not work or seem to be off.
657;Adding to reasons why it is so easy to watch again and again.
658;the man rober de niro brings his A game as always as jimmy conway really jimmy burke.
659;this movie was great i watch it over and over go watch it love it AND WATCH IT AGAIN!
660;Replaced it at a local major store.
661;Well written and acted Ray Liotta at his best.
662;JOE Pesci, so I amuse you bit on of the best of all time
663;Classic Gangster!Scorsese is always a YES!
664;One of my all time faves!
665;Over all a good movie @ a great price
666;One of Scorsese's best films.
667;Liota, De Niro, and Pesce were amazing!
668;Great tine period piece, and the storytelling is top notch.
669;This is the Scorsese/DeNiro/Pesci nexus right here!
670;Each film has a masterful performance from an unexpected source.
671;In Goodfellas, it's Ray Liotta who brings us along for this hairy arc of Henry Hill's life.
672;The highs are very high and the lows are even lower.
673;His depiction of cocaine use gone out of control is absolutely harrowing.
674;Dances with Wolves was a fine movie, but this one should have won the best picture that year!
675;Martin Scorcese has a hit, great acting.
676;Never a dull moment and keeps you on the edge of your seat.
677;Amazing story line
678;Lots of terrific acting in this action.
679;packed and somewhat surreal true tale.
680;This has to be one of the greatest mob movies i've ever seen.
681;robert dr niro is an outstanding actor.
682;pretty much if he's in it it's going to be good.
683;this is a must see movie
684;Martin Scorcese's epic tale of the rise and fall of small.
685;time Mafioso Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) and his associates is riveting storytelling that is often as densely packed with information about the details and culture of mob life as a documentary.
686;As a boy, Hill aspires to the power and wealth of the wiseguys he sees around the neighborhood.
687;As he rises through the ranks, accumulating money, power, and a beautiful wife (Lorraine Bracco), Scorcese shows us how seductive this lifestyle can be.
688;This is perhaps Scorcese's best film and benefits enormously from complex, important supporting performances from long.
689;GOODFELLAS is fantastic, kind of like THE GODFATHER with the veneer stripped off to reveal what the modern mafia is really all about.
690;i wish Deniro had been on screen more, because he is just so fantastic in this part.
691;and the script, while not something you'd want to read to your mother, is great.
692;the long tracking shot, following Henry Hill from his car, threw the kitchen, and to his table at a nightclub, is amazing.
693;Joe Pesci won an Oscar, DeNiro was superb.
694;This movie ranks very high on the very real 50's to the late 70's.
695;One of the best films ever created with some of the top actors in the business.
696;Scorsese draws the viewer in and will keep you on your toes.
697;not to mention the soundtrack, which features classic, nostalgic tracks like Layla and Life is But a Dream, each of which perfectly sets every scene.
698;Such a definitive film of the 1990s and I would consider it the greatest mob film of all time!
699;Still is one of my favorite mobster/gangster flicks.
700;Great acting and put it behind the Godfather movies in the genre.
701;After Godfather I and II, Goodfellas has to be the best mob movie out there.
702;I'd even spend a couple extra bucks for it.
703;Goodfellas is my favorite movie of all time.
704;It would be really cool to see a special addition or a Criterion Collection of this movie.
705;Martin Scorsese is arguably the greatest American film director of the last twenty years.
706;I have a hard time picking his best film: is it his depiction of the disturbed Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver, Jack La Matta's rise to triumph and his fall from fame in Raging Bull or his picture of the Mafia between 1955 and 1985.
707;The actors all work great together (although I would have liked to have seen Robert Deniro a bit more!)
708;And, as Scorsese confirmed, the music is used very well to reflect the changing time periods.
709;Roger Ebert was right to pick this film as one of the best of the decade.
710;I think Goodfellas rivals The God Father as best Mob movie ever!
711;It is a must see.
712;would love to see a sequel
713;Enjoyed the movie, great soundtrack.
714;Joe Pesci really gives a memorable performance.
715;Martin Scorsese's greatness as a director would be established if this was the only film he ever made.
716;The casting and script writing of Good Fellas are near perfect, and the story based on the true life experiences of Henry Hill provides us with a brutal and unsentimental view of a social milieu that is both treacherous and violent.
717;Ray Liotta splendidly portrays Hill as a man who joins the mob as a teenager for the excitement and fast money.
718;It totally redefines the meaning of family values.
719;Good Fellas is hard hitting and honest.
720;I easily place it among the top one hundred movies of all time.
721;no need to explain the movie to yous, but it is without a doubt one of the best mob movies of all time.
722;one side, and all of those movies are longer than this one.
723;If you have a multiregion player, you can see this great movie without having to flip the disc.
724;also good to watch with my 3 boys.
725;One of, if not THE, best gangster movies ever made!
726;One of the most iconic and best 'mob' films of all time.
727;A 'must watch' for any fan of great American cinema.
728;Goodfellas is one of the few films that can be put out with no bonus materials and still be great.
729;now that that's out of the way, onto my main point, this is one of the best movies ever made.
730;This is one movie that has, and will most likely continue to stand the test of time.
731;One of the key aspects of this film is that it portrays the mob in a more realistic fashion than a lot of other movies do.
732;The killing that they have become so well known for is just a small part of that.
733;This is where a lot of the appeal lies in this movie.
734;Henry's wife, Karen, explains much of this in an excellent monologue about half way through the movie.
735;as for the cast of this movie, they're absolutely outstanding.
736;Liotta gives one of the best performances of his carreer, and De Niro is excellent as usual.
737;Paul Sorvino and Lorraine Bracco also turn in great work as supporting characters.
738;As for Joe Pesci, he received a well deserved Academy Award for his performance.
739;Watching the movie, you can really see the intensity Pesci provides as Tommy, Henry's maniac friend.
740;Every time I watch this movie, I develop even more appreciation for Pesci's work.
741;The direction is also spectacular.
742;This is the movie that introduced me to Scorsese's work, and he's been my favorite director ever since.
743;It's incredible to see the amount of work that he put into every frame of this movie.
744;The stretch in the restaurant (I think it's the Copa Cabana) is some of the best photography I've ever seen.
745;I love it more with every viewing.
746;lotta/Pesci/De Niro/Sorvino and Bracco are extremely brilliant in their role.
747;The cast is a real fit.
748;The acting is just superb.
749;The story line is great.
750;Just the very WAY the movie is made is great!
751;I have watched this movie so many times, I about have it memorized, and every time I see it, I am still entertained!
752;Great movie and every actor was superb in their roles.
753;Along with the recent Oscar winner The Departed, Scorsese has given us 2 great gangster thrillers along with his seminal Mean Streets.
754;And Joe Pesci's Oscar performance as a psycho hood ranks up there with the best of Cagney.
755;A little long perhaps but filled with juicy details of the mob and of course, DeNiros excellent performance.
756;Scorsese's Goodfellas is a long movie that feels short, thanks to memorable characters, a blazing soundtrack, and expert pacing that only the director is capable of pulling off.
757;The screenplay is so good, that watching episodes of the Sopranos evoke great memories of this film.
758;Ray Liotta's narration is perfect.
759;It is as good as Dreyfuss' wonderul narration in Stand By Me and is peppered with comedy, poignant emotion, and heart.
760;Goodfellas practically made Pesci's career with his explosive performance as Tommy DeVito.
761;Robert DeNiro shines equally as the Irishman Jimmy Conway with his famous Little Bit scene.
762;the supporting cast of characters is top notch in the tradition of Scorsese with Lorraine Bracco, Paul Sorvino, and Frank Vincent creating memorable performances.
763;Robert DeNiro was born to play Jimmy Conway, Pesci is superb, and this is, by far, the role of Ray Liotta's career.
764;A must see for anyone that loves movies, even if Gangster movies are outside your normal purview
765;I have watched this a good dozen times and keep picking up new pieces.
766;brings back lots of memories coming up in nyc.
767;Well acted, well directing and edited well.
768;The true story of a rising gangster in a crime family.
769;Brutal but honest with no holds barred performances.
770;Martin Scorsese has the unique talent of making a scene beautiful and disturbing at the same time.
771;One sequence, probably one of the most memorable in all cinema history, is the Layla scene.
772;What one sees on the screen is repulsive, disgusting, but at the same time, it is beautiful.
773;The movie has too many cuss words and too much violence, but all of that can be forgetten because the director keeps such intensity that one is simply swept off their feet.
774;I don't feel like my words are worthy of an attempt to review Goodfellas so I will just say I own it, I watch it a lot, and it is OUTSTANDING!
775;There are so many great lines from this mob flick that the folks who really love it and have watched it over and over (and I still watch it over and over) can spout off the one.
776;this is a mob flick at it's finest and is based on Henry Hill's true story.
777;It's graphic, funny, lewd and right up your alley if you like mob flicks.
778;Dee Dee Two Times (that's my Mob name) loves it and says you gotta watch it for yourself.
779;Find your inner mobster and enjoy Goodfellas .
780;It is action packed and full of surprises.
781;If you love mob films, this is a must see
782;The price was a great bargain for this blockbuster movie.
783;No matter how many times I see Goodfellas, I still am entertained like the first time.
784;It is a classic in my book.
785;This is one the best movies I have ever seen in my entire life.
786;This is De Nero's best movie ever, as well as Liota and Pesci.
787;This is the best gangster movie ever made, and it's all based on real events!
788;Beautiful transfer and the soundtrack is amazing!
789;Have watch this many times, and will probably watch it several more times.
790;This movie is a classic that I am sure will love on for a long time.
791;The performances are high octane (Liotta) or elegantly understated (Deniro).
792;immolation, it is quintessential Scorcese.
793;this movie is a classic, yet Warner Bros does not value its customers at all.
794;The birth of so much of it starts here.
795;GoodFellas is on top of my best films of all time list.
796;It's not a very illuminating commentary, but it's still good to see what Hill is like today.
797;I found absolutely no new insights into Martin Scorsese or the film from the additional materials.
798;Come on, do we actually *need* you to tell us that Scorsese is great?
799;So this is still the best available version of the film out there.
800;I love the movie Goodfellas.
801;Just watched this on AMC the other day on a small old 27 and after maybe 20 times, STILL I rate this film as phenomenal in script, acting, directing, set design, etc.
802;Was surprised I watched in entirety without a single negative comment and that is a rare moment in my film viewing history.
803;True roller coaster ride, wide.
804;eyed captivating drama based on a true story.
805;Highly recommend and if O'Henry sobers up, anticipate a franchise extension with Part Deux and his painting career, divorce, kids, and life on the left coast!
806;ray is a lot better.
807;One of my favorite movies of all time, next to Casino.
808;audio is excellent as well.
809;Good plot and true to the time frame.
810;Lots of mature actors who know how to become their characters and make you believe their story.
811;Great acting based on actual mob families back in the 70s'.
812;Martin Scorcese delivers one of the best movies about organized crime ever made in Goodfellas, due in large part to the intense portrayals by an excellent cast.
813;Ray Liotta is completely believable as Henry Hill, an Irish.
814;In addition to gritty performances, the groundbreaking cinematography in Goodfellas makes this a visual treat for the eyes.
815;Even so, this is one of the best movies to be released in the past half.
816;For that I think it was a great movie since it tells a story.
817;Honestly this is a great experience.
818;In my opinion, probably the best movie of all time.
819;This is a masterpiece and required a couple viewings to really appreciate it.
820;I enjoy all genres and this is just a great film.
821;master one of the great films so it really looks as good as it COULD on blu.
822;Cause it is the first movie I streamed thru my kindle fire and I loved what the kidle did for this movie.
823;Loved the movie, a classic.
824;and loved the device used to watch it.
825;Goodfellas has a wonderfully talented cast and director that never disappoint the audience
826;I love everybody in this movie!
827;It is the ultimate flick!
828;Plus it came in excellent condition and came really fast!
829;Hands down, this is one of the best movies ever made, as well as one of my favorites.
830;released for an improved version.
831;One day the kids from the neighborhood carried my mother's groceries all the way home.
832;This movie is just excellent.
833;This is a movie that i enjoy watching over and over.
834;Everything about this movie from directing, acting, soundtrack is brilliant!
835;Joe Pesci and Ray Liotta are great in this movie!
836;If you like gangster movies, you'll really like this one.
837;It was well acted and produced.
838;I would recommend this to anyone that is interested in this type of movie.
839;one can hit everything as pitch perfect as him.
840;the casting is one of the best and most enjoyable parts of this movie.
841;The interplay between Liotta, De Niro and Pesci is a wonder to behold and their chemistry does jutice to an excellent script.
842;On top of this is an impressive narrative told through the lead character Henry Hill (Ray Liotta).
843;'Goodfellas' is essentially as close to perfect as a mob movie can get.
844;It is quite possibly the best movie that Scorcese or De Niro ever made, and that is really saying something.
845;The only actor I can really say satisfies his role is Robert.
846;The best movie on Amazon Instant Prime and one of the top 3 movies of all time.
847;Amazing acting, directing, and cinematography.
848;I have easily watched this movie or 20 times and it still impresses me.
849;An old favorite / classic of ours.
850;Great acting and excellent movie in general.
851;An absolutely great film with absolutely great acting and the stunning realization that everybody loses, for all their bravado and all the big bucks that flowed thru their hands, the 'goodfellas' and their families lose in the end.
852;One viewing was enough for me, and, admittedly, it's my loss.
853;Goodfellas is the essential classic mafia movie.
854;It fit the era to a tee, A great movie but not for anyone that is squeamish.
855;What can be said it's one of the best Mob movies ever made !
856;It's got it all !
857;great actors sometimes funny and sometimes bizarre.
858;Goodfellas is arguably one of the best movies ever put on film.
859;up our ability to enjoy this masterpiece at home.
860;If anyone from Warner Brothers reads this review, do yourselves a favor and release a special edition of this classic.
861;As Henry Hill progresses, his life starts to spiral more and more out of control, and it leads up to the big finish.
862;anywho, I recommend this one.
863;It may be rather lengthy, but it's interesting the whole way through.
864;Flawless direction and marvelous acting performances make this a classic.
865;The rawness and honesty of the photography, script and story brings you in, as you are hypnotized by brutality, naivety, treason and the pursuit of the American dream.
866;The base line for the entire story is with 'Henry Hill', who is Irish Sicilian, growing up in 'Mob Land' Brooklyn.
867;Appearances from the likes of Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci (Nicky from 'Casino') and Ra Liotta (as Henry), make this a brilliant cast, who really do make thismovie spectacular.
868;In my opinion, Goodfellas is one of the best gangster movies ever made.
869;Goodfellas is one of those movies I patiently waited for to get a special edition.
870;Goodfellas is the story of Henry Hill.
871;I think the story is very engaging and it's amazing to see how these people live their lives on a daily basis.
872;i just love watching this movie.
873;It's as simple as that.
874;It's got so many scenes that I can recite to my friends.
875;ray Liotta is brilliant here as Henry Hill.
876;Liotta wasn't a big name at the time of this movie, but he was the perfect choice.
877;And do I even have to mention that Robert DeNiro was fantastic?
878;He plays the character of Jimmy Conway perfectly.
879;Although Liotta and DeNiro were great, Joe Pesci is the one who steals the show here.
880;He has most of the funny lines in the movie, and his character just eats up every scene he is in.
881;He is so good of an actor, just his looks and glares reflect what he is trying to say.
882;I loved her here and it was another great casting choice.
883;Obviously I do now, but while watching this movie you can really see what an amazing filmmaker he is.
884;Those two movies definately deserve it, as well.
885;special Features: There are 2 seperate commentary tracks.
886;One is with Scorcese and some of the cast and crew.
887;Both are pretty decent tracks.
888;On disc 2, you get a very good documentary on the making of the film.
889;Then there is a featurette interviewing other well.
890;Overall, this is a very good set of features.
891;not for everyone but I enjoyed it.
892;Yes, this movie does benefit from the higher resolution.
893;Surely it is still the one to own, beating all other home video presentations to date.
894;Goodfellas has to be one of the great Mob movies ever, alongside the Godfather and Godfather II.
895;wow this was a great movie.
896;joe pesci and ray liotta play very nicely in this movie.
897;as usual robert dinero delivers a great performance.
898;we need more irish american stories ray liotta was excellent and who doesnt love joe pesci.
899;It was a used movie, had a couple of glitches in the middle but overall functions fine.
900;Watched this movie again after several years and still enjoy it.
901;A great Saturday night watch.
902;First, this is one of the best gangster movies I have ever seen.
903;While the Godfather showed us organized crime from the perspective of it's leadership, this movie gives us an intimate portrait of the mob from the blue collar side.
904;up until halfway through the movie, we see a young man become involved in a personal love affair with the mob.
905;As a plus, Henry Hill's commentary is added to this movie, and we get to hear his reflections on how this vision compared to his real life.
906;Goodfellas is probably the best movie ever filmed in the history of the world.
907;If you're a big of gangster films and fan of Joe Pesci this is the movie for you.
908;Awesome movie from beginning to end.
909;Makes you wonder what was life in the 50's for a kid who all he wanted to be was a wise guy.
910;Based on the true story of mob giant Henry Hill, Goodfellas is the best mob movie to come around since Godfather 2.
911;Scorsese is a master at this kind of movie.
912;The characters are riveting, the dialogue funny and clever, and there's plenty of good ol' fashioned whacking!De Niro is such an amazing actor.
913;you want him to win!
914;Joe Pesci shines as the pyscho little guy with a huge chip on his shoulder.
915;all you need are Godfather 1 and 2, Casino, and Goodfellas.
916;If you havent yet seen this movie your missing out on one of the best movies ever made.
917;I can watch this film over and over and I'm sure you can too.
918;Joe Pesci is merciless in Goodfellas!
919;Scorcese does an amazing job, as does DeNiro, Liotta and Pesci.
920;This is the best gangster movie ever made, hands down.
921;Good acting, good plot, good narrative.
922;perfect movie if you've always heard about it, always wanted to watch it.
923;This is the ultimate Mafia motion picture on so many levels.
924;First, Martin Scorcese combines elements of the finest in filmaking technique, incorporating cinematography, lighting, and pace in a way rarely seen in modern cinema.
925;Next, the performance and acting of Ray Liotta, Robert Deniro, Joe Pesci, etc, sets the standard of believability and execution in an incredible fashion.
926;Product was shipped quickly and very good packaging.
927;A Scorcese masterpiece (for which they robbed him of Oscar), it juxtaposes, (the same way the Sopranos did later on), the real life family struggles mobsters deal with.
928;Add to that the masterfully written dialogue, which incidentally has provided years and years of fodder for my family, and you have a film of monumental proportions.
929;This is one of the best mobster movies ever.
930;One of the few movies I can watch over and over again.
931;Some may disagree, but I think it's Scorsese's best film.
932;Easily one of the best American films ever made no doubt.
933;ray, have some nice offerings, this film deserves better, more impeccable treatment.
934;He's never quite fully gotten the respect he deserves.
935;Everyone pretty much agrees that Goodfellas is a classic.
936;Brutal, stylish, hypnotic and addictive, GoodFellas remains Martin Scorsese's greatest film.
937;Director Richard Linklater, a major fan, dismisses those who instead champion Raging Bull.
938;disc GoodFellas offers two worthy commentaries .
939;one with the actors and filmmakers
940;hero, played with considerable verve by Ray Liotta.
941;Hill is a great storyteller in the Italian street tradition .
942;it's fascinating watching the movie with him.
943;The film was all based on the rhythm of Henry Hill's language, Scorsese says.
944;filmmaker talk includes almost all of the key talent, whose comments are carefully placed and tightly edited.
945;GoodFellas fans love to cite some of the film's jaw.
946;dropping scenes: Scorsese and editor Thelma Schoonmaker dissect three of the best.
947;A great story and good acting produce a great movie.
948;This is one of the best gangster movies of all time.
949;Starring Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, and Joe Pesci with direction by Martin Scorcese, the film follows the true story of Henry Hill and his life as a mobster.
950;I appreciated the period music, voice over, tracking shots, and freeze frames.
951;By the way, the drunkfellas drinking game is great for college parties.
952;About as good a movie about the mob as you can find.
953;Seeing this you realize where the inspiration for The Sopranos came from.
954;It's always engaging, often funny, and more often than not, frightening.
955;Got this movie as a gift, Great movie.
956;one of my all time favorite movies.
957;Still remains one of the best mob movies ever made.
958;i'm amazed this movie holds anyone's attention, let alone earns the best movie ever!
959;praise you hear about this one.
960;at least the Godfather was an actual good movie, although certainly no masterpiece.
961;You may say that's the power of the film maker, but I say that's simply the power of the subject matter.
962;Scorsese's fans call this the best shot ever.
963;Kubrick did great tracking shots too, but the key to a great tracking shot, like any shot, is that it communicates something significant to us, puts us in the state of mind of the characters, etc.
964;The difference is contextual and often subtle, but it's there.
965;lauded film I think is nothing special, were genuinely moving and provocative (not like that, you pervs).
966;scorsese's last masterpiece to date.
967;This film is certainly one of Scorcese's best although to say it matches the calibre of Coppola's work on The Godfather I &/or II would be stretching it.
968;It's a good film though that's based on a true story and succeeds admirably in portraying a no.
969;barred story of what life in the mafia is like and is like a good adjunct to the whole Godfather franchise.
970;ray releases that are out there this ranks as average.
971;of documentaries and even a short interview with the real Henry Hill.
972;Scorsese hits it out of the park.
973;The cast is perfectly chosen.
974;The use of a narrator and flash backs to New York in the 50's and 60's great device for telling the tale.
975;New York City is as much a character in the film as the cast.
976;One of the best insider Mafia movies made .
977;I am so glad I was able to get it at such a great price.
978;with those simple words, we are plunged into the dark underbelly of crime from the 50's to the 70's.
979;the true life story of Henry Hill moves us in ways that remind us of Scarface and The Godfather.
980;a fantastic cast, and a great story (a true one, keep in mind) make a stellar movie.
981;I loved it the first timeI saw it, and loved it again this time around.
982;One of, if not the best movies of it's kind.
983;Impeccably cast, artfully directed, and grittingly realistic!
984;What a wonderful inspiring film.
985;The cast is superb, the pace .
986;incredible
987;violent, mesmerizing, enthralling, GoodFellas is an unforgettable wild ride.
988;I have not seen the film for a while and what a great fun it was to re.
989;watch it again and I know it always will be.
990;The contrast between earlier horrifying scene at the bar and the nice family dinner is simply breathtaking.
991;The movie also has some slow spots and is best during the second act.
992;Overall, a good film, but I actually like Casino more than I liked this movie.
993;I give the movie five stars because the acting was good, the Northeast mood was captured well, and the unpleasantness was well illustrated.
994;He had best repent ask Jesus Christ to save him from his sins.
995;It was still wrapped in original plastic, which is always a plus.
996;It was an exceptional movie then and it's just as good now.
997;The looks of the cast and their social lives were absolutely authentic.
998;I was going out with a Sicilian woman at the time, my best.
999;ever girl friend I might add, and we'd have a lot of social things associated with holidays and so forth.
1000;We both enjoyed it, but afterwards I remarked about how the people in the cast looked exactly like the people at her social gatherings.
1001;She laughed, and replied that it was a bit frightening.
1002;Well, I never detected any Mafia ties with her family, but a good.
1003;in any case, this movie was a quite good depiction of an extended Mafia family.
1004;It got the Best Picture award and earned it.
1005;Loaded with stunning characterists and appealing tension, Goodfellas is arguably Scorsese's best film since Raging Bull in 1980.
1006;Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci give one of the top performances of their whole careers, and that gives support to Ray Liotta.
1007;This isn't my favorite Scorsese film, but it's still pretty damn great, and is perhaps the best mafia film I've ever seen.
1008;But, it's always interesting, often fascinating and frequently disturbing, and Scorsese creates a consistent sense of believability and reality, even as the events fall well outside the range of our experience.
1009;Simply put, Hill's sudden downfall is quite a bit less intriguing that his rise.
1010;The acting is uniformly top.
1011;notch, with special note going to Pesci as the murderous Tommy.
1012;He's certainly one of the most unnerving characters to come along in the 90's, and he really seems to embody what I'm told is a sociopath.
1013;Henry himself is an interesting character, as he displays an unusual detachment from everything around him, as I suppose would true of a great many career criminals.
1014;He also pulls the old using pop.
1015;Scorsese delivers a realistic portrayal of life as a gangster in the tough city of New York, spanning three decades, mixing the glamour and violence to create a world that both gratifies and disgusts the viewer.
1016;joe Pesci delivers a superb performance, which he deservedly won an Oscar for.
1017;I believe that Liotta does a good job as the lead character, his voice.
1018;scorsese is the real master behind the film, through his camera work and plotting to tell a story about a group of people he both detests and admires.
1019;That's all i can say after seeing what I believe is the most accurate and real portrayal of life inside the family.
1020;Based on a true story, it does just that, stays true to the events that transpired.
1021;the acting is phenominal
1022;Robert De Niro gives what I believe is his best performance of his career, and Ray Liotta takes the lead role and runs with it!
1023;Add the always awesome Joe Pesci, and the unforgettable Lorraine Bracco and you have one of the biggest all.
1024;exaggerated or forced, the story is what it is and the viewer is made to take that for what its worth.
1025;Truly one of Martin's greatest films (if not THE greatest!)
1026;An excellent detailed look at life in the mob.
1027;Do I make you laugh?A great scene.
1028;Wow didnt see that coming the first time around.
1029;if you want a Great movie to Kill a couple of hours, this is it!!!
1030;it is one of the best movies ever made, period.
1031;many movies show you a world you've never seen, a reality far from your own that nonetheless appears convincing and true.
1032;But few movies do what Goodfellas does.
1033;You, the viewer, actually matter to them.
1034;after the jarring initial scene, the movie jumps back to his childhood, and Henry puts his arm around you and tells you a story.
1035;It's the ultimate childhood fantasy: they do what they want, talk to who they want, eat what they want, stay up as late as they want.
1036;It's a glamorous, flashy world, fast and loose, so far removed from the day.
1037;day grind of Henry's family that he's instantly drawn to it.
1038;henry and his friends continue in this lifestyle even as it eats them up, one by one.
1039;He misses the fun, the power, the glamour.
1040;And now, it's over, he laments, and he's explained himself so convincingly and pulled you so completely into his life that you, too, understand and lament.
1041;life Henry Hill a chance to comment on the proceedings.
1042;but it's fascinating (and even more so in light of Henry's subsequent arrest on drug charges)
1043;They also touch on events from the book not covered in the movie, like Henry's stint in the Army and his role in various basketball point.
1044;The movie is excellent, so lets get that out of the way.
1045;ray, I know what kind of a mind blowing transfer is capable when the right people are on the task of doing it.
1046;Movie theme is ok and is well developed through the story.
1047;Ray Liotta was brilliant at his part portraying Henry Hill.
1048;My daughter and I love this!
1049;Great acting in this movie!
1050;This is a classic mob movie with a stellar cast, direction and production values.
1051;Much lesser films have been given the gift box treatment, and the 10th anniversary of this epic work came and went without so much as an upgrade with some extras.
1052;I wish I could return to the autumn of 1990 and see it for the first time all over again.
1053;Such compelling acting and brilliant dialogue!
1054;Deniro and Pesci deliver some of their best work ever, and all of the bit players who fill out the crew are just perfect.
1055;fueled copter chase and it works .
1056;What's sad is the realization that Scorese will probably never be able to top it, though I have my fingers crossed.
1057;This is, to me, the best movie made in the last 20 years and surely one of the best ever made, and AFI should have placed it in the all.
1058;Another great film from Marty!
1059;This film has it all.
1060;The NY mob in a really true story.
1061;Extras are a blast from the past and the film is great.
1062;Not just good, but great.
1063;The movie remains a classic.
1064;i thought gangster movies would be dark and boring, but this one actually was kind of funny.
1065;it was a serious story, but it used a light beat style, which made it relaxing but also exciting.
1066;This is one of the greatest movies ever made.
1067;The acting is great as is the cinematography and direction.
1068;You really get a good feel for all of the characters.
1069;When I watched the first 15mins of the movie I startedto really enjoy it.
1070;He did errands for gangsters when he was about 14 years old and loved it.
1071;One of the greatest movies of all time.
1072;this is a title worthy of a Special Edition (if they can do it for Kevin Costner's The Postman, I think they can do it for Goodfellas).
1073;So hopefully our friends at the WB will work on a re.
1074;Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci starin Martin Scorsese's 1990 crime drama basedon a true story.
1075;This isone of the best crime dramas with a greatcast and Joe is hilarious.
1076;John Wayne and John Ford had the great calvary trilogy in the 1940's.
1077;Let him emulate the master with his mob trilogy.
1078;The superstar set, both in front and behind the camera are present.
1079;Just as they did with TAXI DRIVER in 1976, and RAGING BULL in 1980, the Academy again played it safe and denied this Scorsese classic the best picture Oscar for 1990.
1080;I saw this film on Sweetest Day (a completely useless holiday) with a love interest, and dammit, it was worth pissing her off because I saw a great film.
1081;This is my favorite Scorsese picture, one of the best gangster movies ever made, and the film that Marty should have won an Oscar for.
1082;This is Scorsese's most cinematic film, where the camera work (by Michael Ballhus) is quite amazing to behold.
1083;The unbroken shot when Ray Liotta and Lorraine Braco walk into the restaurant is as classic as they come.
1084;It is one of many classic moments in a film that's filled with them.
1085;The V. o. narration works brilliantly here, and every performance is perfect.
1086;Pesci (who won an Oscar), De Niro, Bracco, and Liotta (whatever happened to him, eh) should be commended for their work here.
1087;Forget The Departed, this is Marty's masterpiece, the won he should have won the Oscar for.
1088;I bought this wonderful movie and it had no end.
1089;To top it off, Joe Pesci plays his terrifyingly but likable character.
1090;The great thing about this movie is how accurately the portray this dark but ever so interesting time in history.
1091;This movie was one and maybe the best mob movie the great Martin Scorsese has ever made.
1092;Pesci, De Niro and Liotta were at their best.
1093;nothing good about these fellas.
1094;For those who don't know, it is a Mafia movie.
1095;But since it is a true story, it must be seen.
1096;You just have to grin and bear it in the name of authenticity.
1097;He is volatile and dangerous.
1098;This movie should have swept the Oscars.
1099;Just beautifully directed and acted, with an amazing soundtrack.
1100;worthy (an homage to my 80's Showtime Lakers).
1101;riveting story, actors at peak of their game (Bracco and Sorvino are also stellar) perfect music, masterful filmmaking, Scorsese's best pix IMHO.
1102;This is one of the greatest mafia stories of all time (up there with Casino, Gotti, Donnie Brasco, and the Godfather Saga and it's a true story.
1103;From beginning to end you are one the edge of your seat.
1104;There are a few other main characters as well.
1105;It has tons of action, a great plot and it's fdirected beuatifully, and the screen chemistry of them all is great.
1106;Fav movie of all time .
1107;Well acted
1108;I have seen it about a dozen times and could watch it that many more.
1109;Very few movies are as riveting and entertaining.
1110;This truly is a classic movie.
1111;Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Ray Liotta did not disappoint.
1112;The dialogue between the characters was fantastic and entertaining.
1113;Highly recommend to everyone and anyone.
1114;Love the era of these old movies.
1115;A classic mobster movie done to perfection by an outstanding cast.
1116;Raging Bull and Taxi Driver are two of the most overrated films ever.
1117;it's funny, how is it funny, it makes you laugh?
1118;and there are certainly some classic sequences.
1119;The acting is fine, especially Bracco, who is at her best and sexiest here.
1120;And this is a great movie about the connection between food and crime.
1121;I think everyone in teh world has seen this epic and classic mobster film!!
1122;I believe everyone knows the lines!!!
1123;This movie is a masterpiece!!
1124;Goodfellas is an outstanding movie.
1125;based on references I had heard to Joe Pesci's famous clown tirade, I thought it might be a comedy.
1126;Many of these victims are actually friends of the assailant.
1127;This is, once again, consistent with the theme of the move but it is still disquieting.
1128;like all great movies, Goodfellas will provide entertainment and insight to anyone who sees it.
1129;coat witness protected wiseguy Henry Hill, is portrayed perfectly by Ray Liotta in this biopic of sorts.
1130;hum Dances With Wolves beat this film as 1990s best, so you can't explain taste in Hollywood.
1131;all the performances are powerhouse here.
1132;He plays his part with a perfectly cold calculating ruthlessness.
1133;Conway is adamant about telling each person not to show off.
1134;This song is so perfect for this scene for no reason I can think of, but it just works.
1135;be errand boy for well played mentor and fatherly boss Paul Sorvino, to his rise as a close non.
1136;All I got to say is that if you liked the godfather with all the mafia gangsters ect.
1137;I espiecially liked Joe Pesci's character with the language.
1138;He is a very talented film maker but with his last works he seems to be in a zero atmosphere .
1139;goodfellas is an extraordinary organic piece .
1140;Filmed with artistic commitment but also with a superb flowness and naturality that it lets you astonished .
1141;scorsese adds a high dosis of black humor in all his characters .
1142;They are all involved in such kind of divine madness , that you copnsider the sucesive murders as something completely natural .
1143;When De Niro works with Scorsese , there is something inside the soul of Robert which seemed the happy result of that ong chemistry among them through the time .
1144;pesci is so great , so cynical and Ray Liotta in his finest role to date .
1145;the film is artistic a real jewel .
1146;They are good kids , good sons , they are excellent gourmets and unique husbands , and they do their job as you or me 
1147;If I had to take two films of Scorses to the desert island 
1148;I think this is my favorite film by Scorcese.
1149;Incredible performances by the whole cast.
1150;Some day this film will be recognised as one of the five or six greatest films of the 1990s.
1151;mildly interesting, and certainly a gangster film.
1152;the film freezes in a view of Henry Hill's face.
1153;And the unforgettable first line of narration is spoken: As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster .
1154;from that point on the film is an absolute joy .
1155;a procession of scenes that are incredibly inventive and whimsical in style, over the most amazingly perfect soundtrack.
1156;although it is a masterpiece, it is also incredibly, unbelieveably funny.
1157;The whole film has this cynical and anarchistic joy .
1158;I believe the narration in this film, by Ray Liotta, is the funniest and best I have heard (Fight Club a close second).
1159;He is always ready with smart comments: when the mob beats up a mailman for delivering truancy notices to his house, he remarks calmly: That was it.
1160;First person narration in films is the hardest kind of dialogue to write, because the narrator is essentially talking to nobody .
1161;The charming bit of dialogue about the mailman is directly from Henry Hill's mouth.
1162;The film's style is made more amazing because, like the narration, it is extremely realistic.
1163;The detail is incredible
1164;Like Band of Brothers, the extreme attention to detail is carefully wedded to a masterly sense of drama.
1165;Real life, even for a gangster or paratrooper, has to be very carefully manipulated to be interesting.
1166;Scorsese does the impossible and makes a film that is at once baldly realistic, and highly contrived.
1167;overall, Goodfellas is a masterpiece of cinema that will probably be recognised more as such in the future.
1168;Got this as a present for my friend who loves this movie anytime he sees it on tv we wind up watching it so as a special surprise i got this for him.
1169;He loved it, its the small things that count and really knowing what someone likes
1170;This is as close to an ideal movie as you're going to get.
1171;It's based on a fabulous book (Nicolas Pileggi's Wiseguy), has an excellent script, a good soundtrack and features outstanding performances from Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci.
1172;I actually found it to be the anti.
1173;Goodfellas is much more gritty and real.
1174;This is definitely a gripping, intense movie that will hold your attention for its entire 2 1/2 hrs.
1175;though Goodfellas is categorized as an action movie and does contain the requisite number of fights, explosions, etc., it's actually much more finely nuanced and psychologically complex than what you'd normally expect from this genre.
1176;ray Liotta's performance as Henry Hill is skillfully understated.
1177;joe Pesci delivers an equally powerful performance as sociopath Tommy DeVito.
1178;robert De Niro is wonderful as well as Jimmy Conway, a man whose charm and congeniality mask his icy heartedness.
1179;Beneath his seemingly sincere good will is pure self.
1180;Jimmy does what's good for Jimmy.
1181;part of what I thought made this movie so interesting is the relationship between Henry, Tommy and Jimmy and how they react to the same events.
1182;This is what makes Henry the only sympathetic character and the one whose redemption you'll hope for.
1183;One of the most elegant steelbooks out there.
1184;ray tag on top front cover.
1185;man, goodfellas is one of the best, and stays real on the mafias way of life.
1186;the whole story, the drugs, the profanity, the beatings, the betrayel.
1187;he's a great director and this was just a masterpiece.
1188;brilliant putting robert de niro, ray liotta, and joe pesci together.
1189;they just bring that mafia vibe, to the table.
1190;great movie, perfect as it is, and wonderful potrayel of this underworld.
1191;It was based on a true story and that makes it even sadder.
1192;I see movies to be entertained not feel disgusted.
1193;This movie deserves the Criterion treatment.
1194;I heard Woody Allen loves Goodfellas and Brian DePalma called it the greatest film of the nineties.
1195;I have to admit it is a great extra.
1196;My friends and I quote this film more than any other.
1197;excellent script, casting and directing.
1198;this movie has a super great cast.
1199;Goodfellas is without a doubt one of the greatest mafia movies of all time.
1200;The movie is also arguably the peak of the careers of Martin Scorsese, Joe Pesci, and Robert Deniro.
1201;a small time mob movie that keeps the action through the whole movie.
1202;a mob movie of more modern times.
1203;goodfellas a stunning concotion of music, madness, drug addiction, obession, murders and risk.
1204;goodfellas appears very slick thanks to the well artililated and researched narration holding each and every single scene together to keep the flow by Ray Liotta which he studied off tapes of the real Henry Hill to capture the voice, mood and essence of mafia life.
1205;The editing of Goodfellas keeps the story intriguing with the use of freeze frames and chapters only an example to highlight the fast paced lives the characters lead and the dangers they are always exposed to as a moment to take breath, also to refresh your mind, the next moment it starts again nice and easy.
1206;The songs mirror the accurary on the scenes.
1207;For example, a short extract of Sunshine of our love is played just as about Jimmy is to light up with a big smile upon his face which was to emphasise he was having the time of his life about to give someone their just desserts.
1208;It is up there with any classic you can think of
1209;Nothing good about it and this movie throws it in your face with such grittiness that you begin to feel that you are part of the story.
1210;It draws you in, fascinates and disgusts you to the point that you realise that this IS how the mob really is and that it is NOT glamorous and noone wins in the end.
1211;excellent movie that sets the example for why mobs are not the way of life.
1212;as for the special features, the one I really liked the most was the feature that had the real Henry Hill in it.
1213;The temptation to turn gangsters into romantic antiheroes is great, but Scorsese resists it and goes totally in the opposite direction, and thus accurately captures the true stroy he is trying to portray.
1214;That acting is perfect, and the oldies soundtrack fits the action beautifully.
1215;The temptation to turn gangsters into romantic antiheroes is great, but Scorsese resists it and goes totally in the opposite direction, and thus accurately captures the true stroy he is trying to portray.
1216;That acting is perfect, and the oldies soundtrack fits the action beautifully.
1217;The performances are great, and the story is well written, must watch.
1218;Good fellas, The Godfather 1,2,3, Casino, The last Don 1,2, The Youngest Godfather, and more.
1219;The Youngest Godfather will take you into WHO the Bonanno Family is.
1220;The Bonanno Family is a very powerful Family.
1221;For those who like this type of entertainment, All are worth a look.
1222;Goodfellas is a masterpiece of pacing a film.
1223;It moves along so swiftly that you'll be surprised at how long you've been watching it.
1224;The film serves as an opportunity to experience the Mafia lifestyle firsthand.
1225;We see the highs and the many lows that come with this dangerous lifestyle.
1226;henry Hill (played by the underrated Liotta) is an Irish boy who grew up and into the world of gangsters.
1227;He sees the Mafia as a cool gang.
1228;He only comes close once, funny how?Pesci's Oscar winning turn as the disturbed Tommy DeVito is a horror to behold.
1229;Her life gets tougher as Henry conducts numerous affairs and yet she knows she can't live without the financial stability that the Mafia brings.
1230;scorsese's direction is always personal.
1231;He likes to make his presence felt.
1232;he's the best director of his generation and this may well be his masterpiece.
1233;GoodFellas I agree with another reviewer best mob movie ever made although I felt some of the scenes went on longer then should have.
1234;Trually an amazing cast and great acting jobs by the actors.
1235;The supporting actors also added to the already great movie, if I am correct I think the black guy in the movie stacks was played by Samuel L. Jackson.
1236;I also do enjoy true stories turned into movies, I think the director did a great job turning the story into a great movie.
1237;I still gave it a 4 star rating because of the actors, director, music and allround great movie to sit back and enjoy time and time again.
1238;So if you love your mob movies then pick this movie up and enjoy the best mob movie ever made.
1239;packaged good, i recieved it in a timely matter.
1240;the movie is really good and i will enjoy it for a long time.
1241;It's a classic, it's a downright masterpeice!
1242;Everything about this movie was just amazing.
1243;Amazing screenplay followed by some amazing actors who single handly played a wonderful preformance.
1244;This is defiently one of the top ten best movies of all time.
1245;There is a moment in Goodfellas when you realize how mad being a gangster is.
1246;(A tiny one, but always worth throwing that out there)The scene where Lorraine Bracco is sitting on Ray Liotta's chest pointing a snub nose revolver at his face and demanding him to be faithful to her that you realize: Whoa, someone lived through this?That about sums up Goodfellas.
1247;The film is itself stunning, with a very unrelenting picture of mob life and the downward spiral it leads to.
1248;The way he can capture a story, present it in a unique fashion, in this case show the ups and downs of a life of crime, is stunning.
1249;The cinematography is brilliant, the action sudden and violent, as this life must be.
1250;The acting is perfect, and you really understand why someone would turn to crime, its the family and brotherhood of it all.
1251;The film does take some hits as far as a slightly weird storytelling mechanic (the narration is cool, just a little bizarre), but otherwise it is an excellent film and deserves its place on AFI's list.
1252;Great for the whole family.
1253;A long film about Italian crime in New York in the 1950.1980 period, and a good one at that.
1254;spirit, splitting their unity and getting the weaker ones to become protected witnesses, and it works: these criminals prefer being hidden away by the Justice Department for decades rather than going away in prison for even longer periods of time.
1255;The film is well done: Robert de Niro and Joe Pesci are quite acceptable.
1256;kick, and an essential one at that, of both of them.
1257;This has to be one of the best movies of all time!
1258;Goodfellas is a masterpiece, one of my favorite films and one of the best ever made.
1259;This is by far one of my favorite movies of all time.
1260;I highly recommend to anyone looking to watch a great flick!
1261;I don't write too many reviews, but Goodfellas is one of the best movies ever made.
1262;The cast, director, soundtrack, and the story are top notch.
1263;If you are a fan the mob genre you must see this movie.
1264;The extra features on the Blu.
1265;ray are just an added bonus to the main feature.
1266;Scorcese's finest piece of work.
1267;Joe Pesci is magnificent as Tommy, and provides so many memorable moments both funny and appalling.
1268;A great ensemble cast, Ray Liotta, Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci deliver an incredible performance.
1269;Martin Scorcese did an incredible job in creating the story of Henry Hill and his involvement in the crime family.
1270;The best mob movie I've seen.
1271;Next to The Godfather 1 and 2 this is the best mafia flick ever made.
1272;A terrific movie with a great sound track!!
1273;Cast of characters is unforgettable.
1274;A fanastic tale of Mafia life is incredible.
1275;the camera shots are state of the art and a large part of improvisation makes the film very real
1276;warners has done it again.
1277;you can wait and see if Warners finally does this masterpiece justice and releases it with a proper remastering.
1278;The whole presentation needs a good scrubbing.
1279;It's an Oscar winner for cryin' out loud!
1280;All Star Cast , Its just a all around great movie!
1281;I recommend this movie to everyone!!
1282;Goodfellas is on of my favorite movies of all time and remains the benchmark by which I compare all other movies.
1283;Some movies, very few, are technically better.
1284;Women may not love this movie as much as men however, Ms. Bracco has given us a strong and important female lead.
1285;This is a great movie, telling of Henry Hill's 30 years in organized crime.
1286;Arguably Martin Scorsese is the most underrated director in Hollywood.
1287;No matter how good the films are this man makes the academy always overlooks him for the best director award.
1288;The direction in this film is fantastic and the foresight it took to frame some of the shots in the film (namely the car boot scene) are fabulous.
1289;the cast are great Liotta is sparkling, Pesci although always playing very similar characters is great (if it 'aint broke, don't fix it) and De'Niro is fabulous as always.
1290;watch this movie if you enjoyed 'The Godfather' films, 'Casino' or love 'The Sopranos'4.5 Stars
1291;This movie is a Scorcese masterpiece.
1292;great soundtrack with Nillson, George Harrison, Derek and the Dominoes, Donovan, etc. and a mesmerizing account of mob life fleshed out by memorable performances from Joe Pesci (Do I amuse you), De Niro, Lorraine Bracco, and Ray Rilotta.
1293;Plus you'll see a fair amount of actors who later were regulars on the Sopranos.
1294;For in the middle of this incredibly entertaining movie it suddenly stops.
1295;Martin Scorsese's classic mob film has entertained audiences for 23 years now, and it definitely holds up.
1296;It totally immerses you in the life of a gangster, and is possibly the most realistic depiction of mob.
1297;It's undoubtably a great film, but not Scorsese's best.
1298;It's more than worthy of five stars, but just a tad over appreciated.
1299;This movie is my favorite movie of all time.
1300;Robert DeNiro is my favorite actor which is what brought me to this film.
1301;This movie takes you away and makes you feel like your part of the crew.
1302;The soundtrack fits the film well but is a bit heavy on the Stones for my taste.
1303;An excellent mafia movie:GoodFellas in indeed one of the best 5 ever made mafia crime movies together with theGodfather 1 and 2, Casino and Once upon a time in America, in any order.
1304;It is also one of the best 5 movies ever.
1305;All truly great movies have several key ingredients in common one of which is an absolute perfect casting.
1306;It is fantastic to see how carefully each and every character appearing in the film has been selected and chosen.
1307;Perfect roles by Robert de Niro and Ray Liotta and of course for many Joe Pesci made the movie.
1308;All of them went on to excellent careers and have become familiar faces.
1309;The score is also very well selected with some exiting music by Eric Clapton and the Rolling Stones matching some of the cruelest scenes.
1310;Thanks to the great Martin Scorsese and to Amazon for itsalways great service!Jan in Aruba.
1311;I received the UMD and it is for a region 2 only.
1312;One of the must have movies for your American gangster collection!
1313;This movie is a gritty depiction of the US Mafia, in its hay day!
1314;better than the godfather and scarface, goodfellas incorporates the evils and sorrows of the mob life, but with added humor and witty performances.
1315;goodfellas is fun and unforgetable and unique with its narrative approach.
1316;Goodfellas has got to be one of my alltime favorite movies,right up there with Godfather and Godfather Part II.
1317;Great acting and really puts you into the life of a gangster Dinero and Pesci are just a lil bit perfect together.
1318;I bought the movie because of 2 things:1.
1319;It is already one of the best gangster movies ever2.
1320;ray version about 3 times now, It gets better with each viewing.
1321;i'm not going to talk about the movie in this review, suffice it to say, it is one of the best movies of all time, one of the best gangster movies, and an all around fun movie to watch.
1322;The colors are dark and rich, great contrast and you can see lots of detail.
1323;The movie has never looked so good.
1324;ray, even some new movies shot within the last 2.3 years.
1325;This movie, is perfect, all the way through, the transfer does not disappoint.
1326;The disc also has a few other bonus features, and the movie trailer, which is nice.
1327;all in all, this is an amazing movie, with a fantastic transfer loaded with features.
1328;Goodfellas is without a doubt one of my all time favorite movies.
1329;With exception of The Godfather The Godfather Part II, and of course Scarface.
1330;the film is about the life of Hank Hill, (Liotta), who from when he is young he wanted to be a gangster, but maybe he asked for more than he was bargaining for.
1331;this movie is one of my all time favorite mob flicks, that made Joe Pesci the star he is today.
1332;This film is easily one of Scorsese's best movies.
1333;One of the best gangster films of all time.
1334;plus reviews already posted, so just take it as read that this movie is truly one of the defining experiences of 90's (indeed, any era) cinema.
1335;The man has at least three films to his name which deserved to take home best picture (Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Goodfellas), and he has deserved Best Director just as many times.
1336;The mobster flick is one of Martin Scorsese's best films!!!
1337;The story of Henry Hill is quite gripping and this film is headed by an all star cast that includes Ray Liotta,Joe Pesci(In his Oscar winning performance!)
1338;The movie takes place with Hank Hill (played by Ray Liotta), a young boy who dreams about his life of being a gangster.
1339;Each and every minute of Goodfellas is a refreshing pace, (unlike most mob movies).
1340;With his insane buddy's Jimmie Conway (played brilliantly by Robert De Niro) and Tommy DeVito** (also played brilliantly by Joe Pesci, who also won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor) Hank soon enough gets into more than he bargained for.
1341;led with a brilliant cast of characters:Robert De Niro (The Godfather Part II), Joe Pesci** (Casino) and Ray Liotta (Hannibal).
1342;If you like mob movies, you should really enjoy this masterpiece of a film Directed by Legend Martin Scorsese.
1343;when a piece of dross like Pearl Harbor has already had multiple releases, how can it be that one of the finest American films is treated so shabbily?Where's Criterion when you need them?Hold out for an improved release.
1344;Great acting from starting to supportive role.
1345;the story line is believeable that keeps you ii to the movie.
1346;This is my all time favorite movie hands down.
1347;It is nothing short of a masterpiece in American cinema.
1348;Martin Scorsese is a genius, and here he has made the best gangster movie ever.
1349;This 20th anniversary Blu ray edition finally gives it the treatment it deserves.
1350;This is De Niro's master.
1351;From top to bottom, the best movie I have ever seen.
1352;Sheer genius at work, Pesci is amazing as Tommy, Liotta will never have a better role in his life, and Paul Sorvino is great as well.
1353;You all know the plot of Goodfellas
1354;This is a great transfer to Blu.
1355;Martin Scorsese created his definitive masterpiece with this film.
1356;GoodFellas has everything and anything I could for in a motion picture, and it is done so well with such enthusiasm, excellence and thought that it boggles the mind.
1357;While it might be on a subject that might not be appealing to everyone, it is certainty worth viewing (I would even put it over the Godfather).
1358;That leads Hill in becoming a bus boy, and then working his way up in the world.
1359;acting helps this film immensely, and of course it is just one part of the film's greatness.
1360;The photography is also awesome, with shots going into the copa cabana being fantastically mesmerizing and simple one's like the shot at the dinner table being simple
1361;martin Scorsese has been able to top them all now.
1362;A real life look inside the lives of true gangsters.
1363;its a shame this didnt win for best picture.
1364;and Mr Scorsese for best director
1365;it does have advantage Coppola's masterpiece doesn't have, though: It is a true story.
1366;as a gangster movie connoisseur, I gotta go with Godfather I, Godfather II, Scarface (with Pacino), and Goodfellas, in that order.
1367;If you are going to see one movie about the middle ages of American organized crime, this is it.
1368;Few, if any, movies capture the cultural subtlties and realities of both Italo.
1369;The finest movie known to thy beast and that's all there is to say about that and uhhhh.
1370;This is by far the best mob movie ever.
1371;Based on real life, it's just the best
1372;I rate this up there with the first 2 Godfather movies.
1373;Acting, directing, and story top notch and it's easy to see why the American Film Institute rates this as one of the top 100 movies of all time.
1374;While Goodfellas is not my favorite movie, it is defiantly in the top 5.
1375;Goodfellas is a mostly true story based on the book Wiseguy by Nicholas Pileggi.
1376;The movie chronicles Hill's journey through the world of organized crime, starting with a part.
1377;robert DiNiro and Joe Pesci perform brilliantly, playing blood thirsty, borderline psychotic gangsters.
1378;this is one of those movies has something for everyone, love, deceit, murder, drugs, corruption, graphic violence, humor, and mystery.
1379;I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for an excellent drama.
1380;anyway, moving on to the film.
1381;This is such a success I think because, well, to put it simply, there are no flaws.
1382;The incredible and perfect cast had an absolutely amazing script, and they were directed perfectly among other things that made this movie one of the best I've seen, and certainly the best mobster movie.
1383;Sorry Godfather (and part 2), but this one has it all.
1384;It shows the truth of the mob (which should really make you think) and includes comedy.
1385;So you see what their life is like.
1386;At least Pesci won, thank god.
1387;So recommend for those who are more tolerant than I am.
1388;The recipient of this gift and I were able to view this film and enjoy the special features.
1389;My husband bought this movie, and I am not big on gangster flicks but I liked this one because it was based on a true story.
1390;Scorcese and Pileggi's masterpiece on the life of Henry Hill as a Brooklyn NY mob wise.
1391;While not my favorite Martin Scorsese movie it is a stunning achievement, and one of his very best movies.
1392;as much as the true events of Henry's life have more than likely been dramatized and glamorized to a certain extent, the essence of this film in my observation is that it is still a brilliantly damning portrayal of the characters and lifestyle of mobsters.
1393;preaching loyalty, respect and principles .
1394;Each of them has an inflated sense of self.
1395;worth and stature that comes with being a wise guy, breeding with it paranoia that others are not giving them the respect they deserve.
1396;We see all the highs and lows of his life and meet a host of very believable and very undesirable characters along the way.
1397;It's a film full of memorable scenes whilst remaining much more than the sum of its individual parts at the same time.
1398;The film starts as it means to go on .
1399;violent, full of profanity, fast paced and very stylish.
1400;the consistently fine acting by the large ensemble cast (both known and unknown), the cinematography, editing, dialogue, is fantastic.
1401;As to the actors De Niro is on his usual top form, Ray Liotta is the best he's ever been, and this is Joe Pesci's definitive performance.
1402;this film draws you in and won't let you out of its grasp at any point.
1403;'Goodfellas' is (to date) Scorsese's last Great Movie, and one of the very best films of the 1990s.
1404;Growing up in Queens NY myself I have great passion for this movie.
1405;this film is based upon true events and with a big splash of Mr. Martin Scorsese's artistic flair this movie is a instant classic.
1406;For fans of the Soprano's look for Christopher and Pauly Wallnuts early in there careers .
1407;Martin Scorsese is one of my fav movie directors and Goodfellas is probably my favorite ganster movie (alongside with Godfather Part 1 and 2).
1408;Here De Niro delivers one of his best performances as an actor and this kind of character fit him so well.
1409;On Joe Pesci, this was the first time I saw him on a movie and I really did enjoy his impersonation as an beyond good and evil ganster.
1410;Monolog it's one of the best twisted funny moments I have never saw on a movie.
1411;Finally, the brand new Ray Liotta as the main character and story teller is simply awesome.
1412;It was a good movie vary classic and I like it and it was grate I like Joe Pesci I like the way he act when he gets mad he's so funny when he gets angry and everything I like it.
1413;This ONE film was able to pull off what The Godfather took 3 films to do!
1414;The bonus features on the second disc are fantastic!
1415;I loved the film Goodfellas, interesting history and especially the interpretation that do Robert De Niro of mobster is very good, the entire cast of the film worked great, there ha of the film, I am grateful that they complied with the delivery time, thanks for your attention
1416;brilliant performances from De Niro, Pesci and Ray Liotta (Who plays Hill) et al.
1417;incidently, one of the first characters to get whacked.
1418;The film is one of the great works of the last 20 years and it deserved better than this release.
1419;My rating is more a reflection of the product than the movie itself, which we all agree is a classic.
1420;I understand the movie is about 18 years.
1421;this film deserved better and it should've been properly restored.
1422;The film is a born.
1423;classic with superb performances by Bracco, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Ray Liotta.
1424;this is still a class act!
1425;Ever since I can remember I always wanted to be a gangster!
1426;These are the words spoken by Henry Hill (Ray Liotta)!
1427;Hill started to work with the mob when he was a teenager and by the time he hit his 20's, he was 'part of a group' as he liked to call it.
1428;So begin's the adventure of Hill, even though it has some funny moments, even one's that seem like there heartwarming.
1429;The violent part of the life always takes over.
1430;Along for the ride is Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci's Oscar winning performance)!
1431;Tommy is a very quick tempered man, who uses anything around him to get what he wants or needs.
1432;But along the way Hill gets into drugs and seals his own future.
1433;The film never really slows down, the character development is outstanding, as is the entire supporting cast.
1434;With a great director, cast, screenplay and cinematography this film is a sure winner.
1435;As always Robert De Niro proved to be a treat, but the real surprise was Joe Pesci!
1436;It should have won for Best Director and Best Picture, but it didn't!
1437;It ranks up there with The Godfather yet never use's anything from the film, making the choice for which is better, very hard.
1438;See Goodfellas and realize that it is Martin Scorsese's best film and one of the best ever made!
1439;An Oscar winner for Best Supporting Actor(Pesci)!
1440;Great story ( truish) , wonderful actors with great roles and ultimately directed.
1441;it's a very good movie.
1442;This just happens to be my favorite movie of all time.
1443;And I'm so excited about having a 2.
1444;Before I saw this movie, I had already loved Robert DeNiro's acting, and Martin Scorsese's directing.
1445;Where DeNiro is always flawless (as he is here), Scorsese really took it to the next level.
1446;the actors perform brilliantly, the writing is top.
1447;base, but to improve on the two.
1448;if you like The Sopranos, you're gonna absolutely love this.
1449;I strongly recommend this movie!!!
1450;Great Movie , Great Masterpiece , Best of all its on this BLU.
1451;rAY version has an amazing picture !
1452;dialogue is great,action served up stylishly and tense mood of ambitious and motivated Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) is captured brilliantly.
1453;if I can criticize anything about this fine film, it would be.
1454;with the windows WIDE open.
1455;guess Marty needed the lighting more than the dope dealers needed their privacy!Regardless of my nitpicks, this is one of my top 20 favorites of all time.
1456;The grittiness and violence make this movie seem very real, and it is based on events that actually happened!
1457;Scorsese's masterpiece, and the highlight of his career, follows Henry Hill, a real life gangster, through his life in the mafia.
1458;Compelling because of it's reality and truthfullness, this excellent piece of cinema creates a real world, THE real world of small time member of the Cosa Nostra.
1459;Starting as a teenager, Henry Hill (Liotta) always wanted to be a gangster.
1460;Teamed up with De Niro, Pesci, Sorvino, and Lorraine Bracco, Liotta delivers the performance of his career and tells the real story, adapted from Nichols Pileggi's novel WISE GUY, of Henry Hill.
1461;Without a doubt one of the greatest movies of all time.
1462;Scenery, acting and music all do a fantastic job of making Pileggi's book come to life.
1463;This is actually better than I remembered it.
1464;the extra disc is icing on the cake.
1465;I always loved this movie it is the epitome of crime mob dramas well scripted directed and masterfully acted I am a real film buff and this movie should be in anybody that calls themselves a movie specialist top 5 the best movie ever!
1466;Goodfellas is a Great movie or as my movie buff friends and I put it Goodfellas is a Fine, Fine, Film But.
1467;The best gangster movie of all time.
1468;I feel that Martin Scorsese's GOODFELLAS is problably one of the best Italian mob movie ever.
1469;maybe I am biased, b/c I like the main characters (Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, and Joe Pesci)Also, the fact that the movie is based on the real life of mobster Henry Hill (played by Ray Liotta) makes the movie much more appealing.
1470;the movie shows Henry's life as young boy and shows his life from a mob errand boy to his life and downfall as drug.
1471;It should be made required viewing.
1472;I respect Godfather, I grew up with Scarface, but goodfellas is the film I LOVE.
1473;The acting was superb as was the writing, casting and directing.
1474;Robert Diniro was wonderful as always and so was Lorrain Bracco!
1475;A true story of gangster Henry Hill and his wild ride with the Mafia.
1476;Pesci is incredible as gangster Tommy Devito and won a well deserved Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.
1477;truly one of the greatest gangster movies of all time.
1478;I gave this movie 4 stars because nothing is perfect, Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci are great together, one of the great movies of the era.
1479;it is a piece of modern art, in my opinion.
1480;Great acting, dialogue, cinematography, this movie has the works.
1481;layered, they really meant dual.
1482;This aspect of the item is most definitely an abysmal 0/5.
1483;It's Goodfellas, one of the best movies ever made.
1484;goodfellas is the balls, please print this the balls means really good
1485;Great movie, I had never actually watched it all the way through.
1486;Watched it through and loved it!
1487;This is a great movie if you don't have it as part of your mafia collection then you don't have a mafia collection.
1488;I give this movie 5 stars because I DO like Italian food.
1489;A great cast, some of whom give their best acting performance of their career.
1490;Inside the tense, funny, exciting world of a bunch of gangsters.
1491;OMG, Goodfellas is at best a well.
1492;crafted IMITATION of the number one movie of all time.
1493;I admit Goodfellas is an enjoyable movie, but the only thing memorable about it is Joe Pesci's loud mouth.
1494;and pesci was amazing .
1495;the best part is it is a true story.
1496;It's very entertaining and at the end, shows the true colors of the mafia (that they are selfish disloyal scumbags).
1497;Scorsese's mob masterpiece, which he co. scripted with Pileggi, is an intimate, insider's glimpse into the rise and fall of the Mafia from the 1950's onward.
1498;Liotta is strangely sympathetic and all.
1499;Quite simply one of the best crime movies ever made.
1500;It gets 5 stars because this is one of my favorite movies within my mobster movie collection.
1501;The transfer as in video was great.
1502;One of the few movies I can watch again and again.
1503;A perfect movie with an interesting story and great acting all around.
1504;Everyone knows it, not everyone wants to accept it.
1505;exploits the life of gangsters, chronicling the events through the eyes of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), who gets involved with the mafia at a young age and continues his career throughout the film.
1506;Goodfellas is one of the best films I have ever seen.
1507;But what makes the film is a witty script, intelligent, deep, and for the most part likable characters
1508;But when he's on screen he gives a terrific performance.
1509;ray Liotta is perfect as Henry Hill.
1510;He captures a sense of innocence yet at the same time a feeling of violence.
1511;I love the scene where he walks over to a man's house with a regular expression on his face.
1512;What do you want, .
1513;As Henry walks back to his car, his face is disturbing and his expression stays with you for a long, long time.
1514;martin Scorsese, one of the most overlooked directors when it comes to Oscars and other such awards, beautifully directs this gangster epic
1515;Goodfellas has got everything you go to the movies for: Witty dialogue, great, three.
1516;dimensional characters
1517;Goodfellas is an offer you can't refuse.
1518;it contains extremely strong, pervasive language, and a great deal of strong, realistic violence.
1519;anyway, Goodfellas has to be one of the best films I've ever seen.
1520;a true modern classic that will be remembered for what it is: One of the greatest tales told on screen.5/5 Stars .
1521;Goodfellas has to got to be the grand.
1522;Oh yeh, the acting, directing, writing, period music, and everything else is terrific.
1523;This has got to be the greatest film ever made.
1524;This movie is a must have for any movie collector, its really one of the best gangster movies you can watch
1525;It made ME a part of the Mafia and I still felt like I was living inside Henry Hill's mind days after I watched it.
1526;watering Italian dishes, the close affections of Italian culture, and tons of hilarity.
1527;Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci, and Robert DeNiro star in their finest film roles I have ever seen.
1528;This movie will make you proud, scared, happy, sad, and with a final feeling of awe.
1529;Covering thirty years of mob life, this gritty excellentmovie is not only director Martin Scorsese's greatest masterpiecebut it is also the best mafia movie ever made.
1530;This study on New York mob life is a flawless gangsterthat has the words timeless classic written all over it.
1531;CASINO can never match the high classand brilliance of this 1990 classic.
1532;It was a great injustice that GOODFELLAS lost best picture and best director to Kevin Costner's epic DANCES WITH WOLVES.
1533;Oh well, at leastJoe Pesci won best supporting actor for his terrific portrayl ofhair trigger gangster Tommy Devito, which has to be the performance of his career.
1534;Of all Scorsese films, this one is my favorite to watch over again.
1535;This is not just sleek and stylish, but it is also the greatest film of the 90's.
1536;Somebodyasked me once what is the best mafia film ever made.
1537;I told themGOODFELLAS is the best mob movie ever made and THE GODFATHER is the best mafia trilogy ever made (All three films).
1538;Oh I forgot to mention the film also has terrific performances from Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci,Lorraine Bracco, and Paul Sorvino.
1539;Being Christian, and devout about it, it's something I have to watch for.
1540;I really liked this movie, I just can't watch it anymore.
1541;This movie was an instant classic when it came out.
1542;Who can resist a good gangster movie with great actors
1543;This came brand new as listed and the movie itself is just a classic.
1544;I am very happy with this order.
1545;I am usually not a Ray Liotta fan but he did a great job in this movie.
1546;if you like Joe Pesci, Robert De Niro, and a number of other big stars in a great gangster movie, you'll like this one too!Someone told me recently that they liked this movie better than The Godfather so I had watch it to see.
1547;now I'll need to see The Godfather again to see for myself!
1548;GoodFellas is a mesmerizing and epic crime film.
1549;the story in Goodfellas is mesmerizing, although you may have seen a similar structure in other gangster films.
1550;The story moves at a great pace, and gives just enough to keep you full despite the large period it goes over.
1551;There's action, drama, and comedy brilliantly blended into a film that demands your attention.
1552;The performances in this film are amazing
1553;The soundtrack in this film was also great, and helped create the classic gangster atmosphere.
1554;overall, Goodfellas is a spectacular crime drama
1555;goodFellas has strong violence and blood, and drug use.
1556;packed version of Scorsese's classic.
1557;The sound was thankfully remastered as well
1558;Martin Scorsese, Lorraine Bracco, Ray Liotta, Paul Sorvino, Frank Vincent, writer Nicholas Pileggi, editor Elma Shoonmaker, cinematographer Michael Ballhaus, and producers Irwin Winkler and Barbara De Fina participate in the first commentary.
1559;while the commentary has an impressive list of names, I cared more for what Scorsese and Liotta had to say than any of the other people.
1560;Scorsese can talk all day about anything regarding film, and I am surprised they didn't give him his own commentary track.
1561;Hill's observations are fantastic
1562;The Workaday Gangster is an eight.
1563;The Goodfellas Legacy is the most interesting feature on the second disc.
1564;If you have never seen the film, make sure to watch the new edition, as the improved sound and transfer is a substantial improvement over the original.
1565;Being a true story makes this movie that extra bit magnificent.
1566;The movie presents to you the lifestyle of the mafia in italy in a powerful dramatic style of film shown through the eyes of a person who was stealing for the mafia as a child and grew up in their atmosphere shows right from the beginning how things worked whilst living with the mob, knowing everyone, having a lot of extra relations, the money and the work they go through in order to get it.
1567;the movie is presented in the best posiible way and is also quite edjucational i give it the five stars and i strongly suggest that you watch it aswell.
1568;Talk to anyone that has seen this movie and they'll tell you it's one of the best movies ever.
1569;It is filled with great quotes from, All my life I've wanted to be a gangster to How am I funny?!
1570;The acting is incredible, and the cast is perfect.
1571;love the way the movie starts and always leaves you entertained
1572;mill tough guys film directed by the master of the genre, Martin Scorsese.
1573;One thing sets it apart from the other gangbanger films: it is based on fact.
1574;the life of Henry Hill (played by Ray Liotta), a half Irish, half Sicilian punk from New York City who associated himself with the local mob at an early age.
1575;mill street punk, Hill graduates into bigger scores, and eventually into dealing drugs.
1576;The feds get him placed in Seattle with his wife and kids, but once a punk, always a punk.
1577;the film is of course well done.
1578;I think a good film could be made, and still get the idea across, using language more acceptable to a general audience.
1579;Another good movie with Robert De Niro as usual.
1580;I enjoyed the movie and would recommend it to others for viewing.
1581;Incredible gangster movie and perfect cast.
1582;A true classic that wil never be forgotten
1583;Watch it when you have time to spare.
1584;Great Movie, it has a lot to it.
1585;I would recommend this movie to every one, except the kiddies.
1586;One of my favorite movies ever!
1587;Such an iconic, classic movie!
1588;Was so excited to find this for viewing on Prime.
1589;the story's narration plays uniquely well throughout the film.
1590;And the film seems to morph throughout its life in a very intelligent manner.
1591;just about every frame of this film can induce positive in.
1592;Visually compelling artistic sweeps coupled with production sets and performances that make you feel right at home give GoodFellas an unmatched sense of epic realism!There is a vertical mid.
1593;the DD+ 5.1 audio track is very rich, clear and enveloping.
1594;This movie is a great ganster film with great stars like Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, and Joe Pesci.
1595;He was picking up some clothing from the cleaners when I decided to get his autograph.
1596;I thought I was going to get jumped, but when I got closer I realized I knew them all.
1597;It was good to see them all.
1598;My homies always backed me up, so they said they would take care of it for me.
1599;An hour later my homies came back and found me unconscious on the floor.
1600;Give me anudder kiss, babee!
1601;I got my grandmothers stuff and got the heck out of there, with my homies yelling and laughing telling me to comeback and visit again.
1602;It's a great gangster movie.
1603;A must own, one of the greatest gangster movies period.
1604;If you love Mr. De Niro you will love this classic.
1605;it is interesting how even the mafia has a hierarchy and what rules are established and followed.
1606;i had seen it a long time ago still great second time around
1607;One of the greatest movies from the 90's.
1608;I would highly recommend this film to any one who was a fan of the God Father or The Untouchables.
1609;this film is a masterpiece this movie ranks up there with the godfather part 111 and scarface (not with the godfather part1 and 11) a portrays a real gangster and shows the everyday life of one.
1610;ONe of the top three films of the 90's and one of the greatest of all time.
1611;i know it was a gift
1612;Dis is a great moovie.
1613;2 cheers ago I marry Maria.
1614;half way through the movie I found myself looking at the interactive menu.
1615;This movie I a masterpiece and one of Martin Scorsese's best movie, one of the greatest movies of all time, and by far the ultimate gangster movie!
1616;Would highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves old mafia movies with great plots.
1617;Among all the offerings in the mob genre, this is the best.
1618;The script, cast, and direction are all superb.
1619;The performances by Liotta, DeNiro, and Pesci are stunning, and bring the Henry Hill story to life.
1620;Joe Pesci's performance is especially noteworthy, and his Oscar was well.
1621;Kudos to all involved in this sterling production.
1622;In the 1970's director Francis Ford Coppola treated audiences with possibly the most accurate, yet somewhat romanticized, depiction of life in the mafia with his brilliant films The Godfather and The Godfather 2.
1623;Goodfellas follows the life of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), a small.
1624;As Henry Hill rises through the ranks of 'La Cosa Nostra' he manages to find some peace and stability when he meets a young Italian woman (Lorraine Braco) that he marries and has a few kids with.
1625;With his life in possible jeopardy, Henry has two choices, one stay true to the family and face possible execution, or two, become a government informant and be placed into Witness Protection, becoming a rat in the eyes of the 'family'.
1626;director Martin Scorsese's work here is by far some of his best.
1627;His gritty, realistic approach to this true story, really shows the audience the great wealth and success (if you can call it that) that mafia life can have, while at the same time showing the pitfalls that can occur in that same life.
1628;The cast that Scorsese has managed to bring together for this film is truly excellent, and the performances by Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, and Ray Liotta are so powerful, and at times scary, that you can really appreciate the great talent that these actors possess.
1629;The supporting cast is equally talented, and just as worthy of praise as the three leads.
1630;The story is an excellent cautionary tale on what can happen when your choices lead you on the wrong path, even though it's the only path you ever dreamed of.
1631;For those moviegoers that enjoy mafia themed movies, but have never seen this gangster classic, you must do yourself a huge favor and watch this movie, you will not be disappointed.
1632;Still one of the best gangster movie based on biography.
1633;with good cast and brilliant acting by all casts.
1634;Shame butthis movie lost in Academy Awards to be a best picture, but Martin Scorcesse did a great job on this.
1635;It has a nice story .
1636;The acting was amazing , and i have a great love for all gangster movies, robert de niro was amazing.
1637;I liked the music and the clothing.
1638;Violence, sex, Jewish mothering, guns, nanas painting dogs, cocaine, a million swear words, Robert DeNiro at several ages that are totally believable, great soundtrack, nice suits, and good shots of Italian food.
1639;I know it was made 23 years ago, but still a great picture!
1640;Knowing that it's based on a real character makes it even more chilling.
1641;In my opinion Goodfellas is a really good film.
1642;Knowing that this film is based on a true story, I felt that made it much more interesting.
1643;Joe Pesci and Lorraine Bracca and Robert Di Nero give exceptional performances.
1644;The scene in which Joe Pesci's character thinks he is going to be made but is not is an exceptional scene.
1645;Goodfellas, like most classic mob films, explores the entire rise and fall of a man who is part of the mob.
1646;It's all about gaining power, money, and the will to do anything you want.
1647;It's about keeping your word, making the right investments, and looking out for your fellow goodfellas, wiseguys.
1648;That's really what makes this movie so interesting is that all of it is true.
1649;The acting is superb as well and Joe Pesci's Oscar winning performance is incredible.
1650;The real main man behind this masterpiece is the main man behind the camera.
1651;Scorsese's approach to the film is just brilliant.
1652;He has the talent to be able to tell a story over a long period of time.
1653;If you've ever wanted to know what corruption of the human soul is then this is the movie to show it to you.
1654;aUDIO: The DD 5.1 Mix is pretty decent, voice levels are pretty consistant.
1655;The movie features some classic songs of the eras that it chronicles and they sound pretty good.
1656;vIDEO: This is where we smile and say yipee!
1657;I own the first release of Goodfellas and let me tell you how happy I am to own this one.
1658;The new anamorphic transfer is just gorgeous except for one scene where I noticed a dark heavy line come across the screen during a scene with Robert De Niro.
1659;The two discs lay in the double Armary case with no insert with a very nice looking cover and back over.
1660;As for documentaries you have one about the Making of the film.
1661;Another with an all star line up of directors who comment on how the film influenced them, a look at real mob life, and a look at some hand drawn storyboards by Scorsese.
1662;It would be interesting to see some present day interviews from the cast and crew.
1663;Overall a major improvement from the first release.
1664;One of the best movies I seen.
1665;We need move good movies
1666;One of the classic goes right up there with Godfather 1,2 and 3.
1667;This movie is daBomb of gangster movies, its full of guys doing a bunch of gangster s***!
1668;Brilliant the first time I watched it and brilliant now that I own it!
1669;One of the best gangster movies ever and one of my Top 10 movies of all time.
1670;If you like the Sopranos, you'll love this movie.
1671;Three excellent actors that will keep you on the edge of your seat through the entire movie
1672;Another great film like Casino or GoodFellas.
1673;What did this movie accomplish?
1674;While I did now know these guys, I knew a lot like them.
1675;Would recommend this movie to anyone.
1676;I hope Amazon keeps posting movies like this!
1677;Considered one of the greatest in Cinema history.
1678;This really shows De Niro as one of the greatest actors in our generation.
1679;Some pretty good life lessons in the movie also.
1680;What the Godfather started Goodfella perfected.
1681;There will be movies that are better than Star Wars, Saving Private Ryan and Lord of the Rings, but there will never, ever, be a movie that can top Goodfella.
1682;period, its a masterpiece of film making martin scorsesi is a brilliant director.
1683;This is my favorite mob movie of all time.
1684;Sure, many will argue that the Godfather is superior, but Goodfellas is the film of my generation.
1685;Great trip down memory lane!
1686;This is right up there with the Godfather I and II as one of the greatest mob/gangster movies of all time.
1687;martin Scorsese is one of the best directors of all.
1688;And he puts this movie together perfectly, getting pitch perfect performances from his actors.
1689;this is a very fun, entertaining, yet gritty and violent film.
1690;Huge recommendation if you like the crime/mob genre.
1691;Brutal insight into the life of mobsters and the inpact on their home lives.
1692;Scorsese's camera work is also brilliant and he has the actors who can pull it off, especially Robert DeNiro.
1693;Goodfellas has long been one of my favorite movies.
1694;i'm happy to report that the Blu.
1695;The picture is brighter, the colors are more vivid, and many scenes have much more detail and clarity.
1696;Other than that, the audio is fine, although I would have liked a more aggressive surround mix, at least in the musical selections.
1697;ray, I'd highly recommend it.
1698;But it's probably the best way to watch the movie.
1699;Very good price, great communication and super fast delivery.
1700;I highly recommend the product and dealer.
1701;there is a lot of killing and a lot of black comedy.
1702;joe pesci plays a good little gangster roll in this film.
1703;Pesci outshines the rest of a great supporting cast.
1704;GoodFellas is the best mob movie ever made, better than The Godfather .
1705;the person who was responsable for this decision hopefully got fired for this .
1706;it's disrespectful to the director/crew and the audience.
1707;It is a great movie, but it stops in the middle and keeps going to a menu, obviously defective .
1708;But anyone who has seen the movie , knows the story is great
1709;it showed up excellent I would love this movie even if it was on VHS.
1710;Great cast, and I wanted to watch it after the news reports that the Lufthansa heist had been solved.
1711;Loved the period autos and clothes.
1712;Everything feels authentic
1713;what really lifts this flick above, however, is the perfect pacing and editing.
1714;it's also quite funny at times, though I always question whether making truly evil folks humorous (some of the real old.
1715;As excellent as Goodfellas is, the first two Godfathers achieve a level of greatness and gravitas that few other movies ever have.
1716;If only all movies moved this well and looked this good and had this many memorable performances.
1717;This is, hands down, the greatest movie i have ever seen.
1718;The acting is untouchable, the directing, the cinematography and of course, the story.
1719;The soundtrack is even perfect.
1720;Another gem that proves De Niro is God.
1721;All star cast,and one of the best gangster movie of all time.
1722;Of all of the mob movies that have graced the silver screen over the years, Goodfellas most certainly stands a head taller than the majority of them and it can be said that this film is one of the definitive mobster movies.
1723;Few movies, if any, can compare to the compelling based on a true story nature of this film and the graphic realism that is so brilliantly portrayed by Scorsese's direction and the exceptional cast members.
1724;Goodfellas is a powerful film based on the true life best seller Wiseguy by Nicholas Pileggi.
1725;the premise:Narrated by Henry Hill and his wife Karen Hill, Goodfellas tells the tale of how he grew up admiring the local mobsters, gained their friendship and then came to be employed by them.
1726;as the movies progresses along, Director Martin Scorsese does a beautiful job in displaying many of the aspects of the mobster's lifestyle and the many things that can happen in that lifestyle.
1727;from the opening frame to the final credits, Goodfellas is a gripping, suspenseful and enlightening gangster movie that bears multiple viewings quite easily.
1728;I highly recommend this film to any and all fans of gangster movies.
1729;I do find it surprising that this one hasn't been re.
1730;released as a Special Edition with all the special features, featurettes and documentaries.
1731;This is one of the best mob movies ever made in my opinion.
1732;The soundtrack is entertaining as well.
1733;This is a great movie.
1734;Great customer service from the seller.
1735;other than that, on time delivery and great price
1736;from the Godfather to GoodfellasProbably the best movie I have ever seen.
1737;I first heard of 'Goodfellas' about a 4yeaes ago and I thought that it was just 'another' movie but when I first watched it I was hooked.
1738;This movie is probably the best mobster flick ever made also.
1739;With the help of actors Robert DeNiro, Ray Liotta, and Joe Pesci, Goodfellas has become my all time favorite and I recommend it to anybody but there are some scenes that may be to graphic so put the kids asleep before watching this great movie!Also Recommended: The Godfather 1&2
1740;This one has it all.
1741;It has a great story, performances and music.
1742;I watch it at least once a year.
1743;The fab four, Joe Pesci, Robert De Niro, Paul Sorvino, and Ray Liotta are spectacular in this drama.
1744;This is ONE movie you have to own if you love mafia movies.
1745;This movie is a classic and it is in my top 10 movies of all time.
1746;This movie is truely a classic!
1747;The performances and storytelling were exceptional!
1748;This movie is well worth the money to own!
1749;Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas is absolutely brilliant.
1750;Goodfellas possesses everything a good mob movie should.
1751;a great story, great dialogue, violence, and a bit of humor when needed.
1752;Phenomenal performances by Robert DeNiro, Ray Liotta, and Joe Pesci.
1753;The 3 leads just simply own this film.
1754;You'll watch it, and say to yourself, This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.
1755;This is simply a great mob movie.
1756;Skillfully directed by Martin Scorsese, this film with its all star cast, megawatt performances, and period music soundtrack packs quite a wallop to the senses.
1757;As a young man, Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) took to his life in the underworld like a fish takes to water.
1758;He married a nice, jewish girl whom he turned into a shrewish girl, as he lived the life he wanted.
1759;it is amazing that the actor playing young Henry Hill, Christopher Serrone, resembles Ray Liotta so much, right down to the piercing hazel eyes.
1760;He gives a terrific performance as young Henry, expressing all the joie de vivre that young Henry had over being associated with mobsters.
1761;Ray Liotta, as the adult Henry Hill, gives an outstanding performance.
1762;The viewer senses his absolute love for the life that he lives.
1763;robert DeNiro is wonderful as Jimmy Conway, low key yet powerful.
1764;Joe Pesci gives an over the top performance as the wild, volatile, and totally crazy Tommy DeVito, an out of control wiseguy who has no redeeming value as a human being.
1765;Paul Sorvino is excellent as the mob boss who is all about the family and plays it the old fashioned way.
1766;Lorraine Bracco gives the performance of her life as Karen Hill, a woman besotted by the life of a mobster's wife, until she realizes that girlfriends are an expected part of that life.
1767;this is simply a great mob movie.
1768;It is a film that the viewer will watch again and again.
1769;I, myself , have seen it at least three or four times, and each time is as if it were the first.
1770;Vastly entertaining, this film is a worthy addition to one's collection.
1771;Based on the story of mobster Henry Hill, Goodfellas is a fun ride from start to finish.
1772;A great soundtrack of oldies supplies the background for this tragic.
1773;From his early days as an errand boy at cab stand to his part in airport heists and cocaine trafficking, this story is told with humor and style.
1774;Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci, Paul Sorvino and Robert De Niro are great as are future Soprano regulars Michael Imperioli and Lorraine Bracco.
1775;This is a must for all fans of mob movies.
1776;De Niro and Pesci are in top form throughout.
1777;A classic mob movie Liotta, Deniro and pesci were fantastic.
1778;such a fantastic movie !!
1779;Robert De Niro has always been one of my favorite actors, and this movie is another favorite.
1780;Joe Pesci with De Niro is always an amazing combo!
1781;If you're into seeing how to men separate themselves from the boys, this is it.
1782;All I can say about this movie is that it has to be the best Italian Mafia movie ever!!
1783;It's why Martin Scorsese is our greatest living American director.
1784;The acting is extremely, the best i have scene in a Drama movie.
1785;This is a true story about the man who went public about the mob .
1786;Great flick for anyone who wants to know how criminals function in America.
1787;So fun to see so many Sopranos characters.
1788;Absolutely a classic and need to watch it again to catch all the great nuances of characters and plot dynamics.
1789;Holds very true to the book.
1790;Deniro, Liotta, Pesci, Bracco, Sorvino are all excellent.
1791;The Godfather, part 1, is far superior to Goodfellas.
1792;this is a well told story until the day of Henry Hill's capture.
1793;a very good one followed by a pretty bad one.
1794;He blew it big time.
1795;joe Pesci and Robert DeNiro are terrific in this movie.
1796;It arrived wayyy before it said it was going to be here, and it was in perfect condition!!!
1797;This is the best of the best films in the contemporary gangster/Mafioso genre.
1798;Henry Hill WISHES that he looked as good as the young Ray Liotta.
1799;the movie gets thru to over half way then just turns off and brings you back to credits.
1800;Best movie ever made,Great actors, director and dialogue.
1801;You will never find a more interesting true story ever again.
1802;Interestingly, I rewatched Goodfellas, #94 on the AFI top 100, right after rewatching A Clockwork Orange, #46 on the AFI top 100.
1803;Both are about an enthusiasm for violence.
1804;Both tie music into what is going on with the plot.
1805;The acting, the plot, and the insight in Goodfellas is simply phenomenal.
1806;Every single person is simply amazing.
1807;Even the bit parts like Michael Imperioli's Spider character get you interested.
1808;You are watching the very best of the best.
1809;and what they are playing is a real life story.
1810;the music here is simply phenomenal.
1811;It sets you into the timeframe, and you can literally watch as the years unroll.
1812;It's not just the music, it's the hair styles, the cars, the decor of the rooms, everything.
1813;They rebel and feel angst and come to accept and then embrace what is happening around them.
1814;The characters enjoy pummeling another person.
1815;When Lorraine's character is roughed up by a neighborhood slick.
1816;often role in this movie as well.
1817;still, I do at least give Goodfellas credit for giving part of the story through Lorraine's eyes.
1818;She just had to take it.
1819;The women rarely talk with each other, and when they do, it's about their men.
1820;a powerful look into a very real segment of society .
1821;a great, powerful, well acted film.
1822;Everyone knows this movie is a classic.
1823;I'm positive there will eventually be a remastered version coming out but who knows when that will happen.
1824;It definitely needs a good digital clean up.
1825;Still a great addition to add to the collection.
1826;I am 20 years too late, but I love this movie!
1827;Now, picking which film I like best would be impossible, I think.
1828;A true life account of 3 generations of the mob.
1829;Paul Sorvino is outstanding and Robert DeNiro is fantastic as Jimmy Conway, the irish gangster.
1830;dont forget Joe Pesci won best supporting actor for this movie, this is a must see!
1831;The man loves movies, and makes great ones.
1832;deNiro,Pesci and Sorvino we're great.
1833;matter of fact,the whole cast was Terrific.
1834;they suck from those of us who 'play by the rules'.
1835;Goodfellas is definately the best ganster movie to date!
1836;Godfather is great, but goodfellas also adds some dark, funny, refreshing material, unlike Godfather.
1837;But a great movie also.
1838;Two mob flicks that are very good.
1839;A great movie, but I almost fell over when I discovered I would have to get up in the middle of the movie and flip the disc over.
1840;An amazing cast and well written.
1841;One of the best mob movies I have seen other than the Godfather.
1842;Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and Ray Liotta were great together.
1843;I definitely would recommend this movie to anyone who has not seen it you will not be disappointed.
1844;First off, this movie has a great cast.
1845;Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, and Ray Liotta work excellent together.
1846;With their combined acting skills and the intense storyline, this movie is bound to reel you in.
1847;Funny, intense, and sad
1848;Goodfellas is one of those movies I have to watch every time it's on.
1849;Joe Pesci and Robert Deniro are great together (Raging Bull and Casino two more of my favorites).
1850;Paul Sorvino and the rest of the supporting cast were so convincing as mobsters.
1851;Mix in Ray Liotta and you have one of the greatest movies ever made.
1852;This movie, although not suitable for anyone who can't take violent mob movies, has a fast plot and a fine element of suspense.
1853;The direction in this movie is brilliant, and it shows throughout the once.
1854;This is the story of a mobster Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) and his life as a mafia 'wiseguy' it starts from being an Errand boy in 1955 to a well respected mobster.
1855;a must see, even if it if violent and graphic .
1856;it is based on a true story.
1857;After seeing it I realized this was the story the popular TV Series, The Sopranos, is based on.
1858;Mundane tasks of everyday life with family and friends are framed next to the violence of mob life.
1859;The stark contrasting brings the mob in focus.
1860;He wanted excitement and idolized the mob.
1861;Somehow he got a part.
1862;Once the movie started, it engrossed as well as shocked.
1863;Mobsters liked the excitement of what they did, but watched constantly over their shoulders for a snitch, as well as paid high fees for protection.
1864;The acting was excellent, Ray Liotta, Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, Lorraine Bracco, and other actors did great and almost all of the characters they portrayed were accurate.
1865;Lorraine Brocco, who played Karen Hill was great.
1866;Martin Scorsese did a brilliant job with the directing and camera work.
1867;The rock and roll music from the 60's was a good place setter of time.
1868;The script moved well and the characters were well developed, believable and real.
1869;It was a great mob movie.
1870;Ray Liotta was fantastic as well as Joe Pesci and Robert DeNiro .
1871;I understand why this film was recommended as a must see .
1872;That just goes to show you how mainstream America can influence everything in what's considered great and how people come to view this stuff.
1873;Because it's some mob movie, and America is fascinated with the mob and organized crime, then any movie with mobs and gangsters in it will be considered cool and the greatest of all time.
1874;I must admit that I do have a fascination with the mob, so I bought this movie to see what the life is all about.
1875;Glorifies and terrifies
1876;Good movie if you're into the mafia gangland type movies, lots of mafia type executions.
1877;I really enjoyed the movie.
1878;Okay this movie has to be one of thee best mafia/gangster/mob movies ever besides Scarface and The Godfather I and II.
1879;I'm 16 years old and I love this movie to death.
1880;all in all this is a good movie
1881;Enter director Martin Scorcese and actors Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, and Ray Liotta.
1882;The four have gone on to become film legends (though DeNiro was already there) and the film is a cherished gem in Hollywood that is still not even 20 years old.
1883;Many people cite this film as Scorcese's best, although Taxi Driver was a bit more poignant.
1884;But no one denies that this is an excellent film with imagination, scope, and a take.
1885;One of the coolest films ever made.
1886;Theres not much to review here, Goodfellas is in my opinion anyways one of the best films ever directed and produced, the chemistry between Ray Liotta, Robert Dinero and Joe Pesci is amazing and they pull off an amazing storyline.
1887;I obviously would recommend this film to anybody whose into the Gangster action films and hasnt seen the movie.
1888;I love the fact its on Blu Ray now, The moment I saw it on the shelf i picked it up and bought it.
1889;Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas is one of the best films of all time everything in this movie is good.
1890;One of the greatest gangster movies of all time.
1891;Excellent all the way around.
1892;Right up there with Rainman, Ghost and Dark Knight!
1893;nevertheless, great performances by De Nero, Liotta, Pesci et al.
1894;Ray Liota, who plays this central character (and provides splendid narration), follows this path to its natural conclusion.
1895;The transformation is spectacular to watch, particular in the scenes leading up to his final arrest, complete with overtones of paranoia, a mysterious helicopter that seems to be shadowing him, the creation of an elaborate meal, a remarkable scene between the drug.
1896;wrenching or honest without the casual brutality of these animals in full display.
1897;One of the classics of all time.
1898;Ray's performance seems to capture the real life action, times,
1899;Good Fellas, I think, is the definitive movie about the Mafia in the U. s. It's beautifully done
1900;If you like stories of the mobsters this is a great movie i can watch it over and over again
1901;This is one of the best movies of all time, relate.
1902;able, brutal, stylish and well acted, written, and directed.

1910;the early part of the movie describes the early part of Henry Hill'smembership in the clan, and it's all positive .

1920;The movie is great, not to be missed.
1921;The music just makes it that much more enjoyable.

1923;This Movie is great and even better on Blu.
1924;Still a sweet mobster movie.
1925;De Niro will forever have respect as a boss.
1926;Goodfellas, like Mean Streets before it, is a landmark of American cinema.
1927;rate acting from an incredible cast, a fine script, and some of Scorsese's most beautiful scenes (think of the freeze.
1928;frame of the exploding car, the long tracking shot into the Copa, the discovery of the dead bodies to the tune of Layla ) make this not one of the best films of the decade but of all time.

1961;the plot is interesting, and witty.

1973;, Lorriane Bracco, Paul Sorvino and Joe Pesci gloriously over the top in his Oscar winning role.
1974;Scorsese' brilliant juxstaposition of music with visuals has never been better.

1984;ray Liotta gives the performance of his carear.
1985;He was a perfect cast for Henry Hill.
1986;joe Pesci and Robert De Niro are awesome in their supporting roles.
1987;Pesci won the Oscar for his role as Tommy Devito.
1988;It really shows his depth and talent as an actor that he go do a character like Tommy and follow it up with a more family friendly charcter Harry in Home Alone.
1989;This guy is great with any charcter that he plays, but when he gets to be a violent mobster that just adds an exclamation point to it.
1990;I love his smooth talking and Jimmy is believable.
1991;Lorraine Bracco is also good as Karen and she did receive a best actress nomination for the role.
1992;All the performances are great in Goodfellas and props should go to everybody.
1993;This is one of the few movies that I've seen that has a perfect cast from the stars to extras.
1994;this is Martin Scorese's best movie.
1995;Like Coppola was born to do The Godfather and Spielberg was born to do Schindlers List this is Scorses's film.
1996;The music the details it's all here.
1997;He should have gotten the Oscar for Best Director.
1998;I loved the commentary from Scorese and Henry Hill.
1999;Ya know what makes a great movie?
2000;best scene of all time.
2001;The music, the acting, it invites the viewer into the life of a gangster and how they live.
2002;Not admirable but a realistic scene and very well done.
2003;One of the best films ever made.
2004;Well shot, great acting and dialog.
2005;I was hooked within the first two minutes.
2006;I knew from that moment on, that I always had a desire to be a gangster.
2007;You feel pity, as Henry Hill gives up his glorious lifestyle just to stay alive.
2008;all of the cast was perfect, especially Joe Pesci (who won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in this role).
2009;The soundtrack fits so well, sometimes you forget it's there.
2010;The cinematography and directing is top notch (remember the no.
2011;I get to the cars blowing up and the 'Out of respect' line.
2012;Martin Scorsese is a director with a gift.
2013;He knows he has a great story to tell, and he tells it, in vivid and violent details.
2014;De Niro was great as a semi.
2015;An even more important character to the film is Joe Pesci's psychopathic gangster.
2016;He is a perfect example of what happens when a madman has power.
2017;Ray Liota gave a great performance to Henry Hill.
2018;What I really liked about this movie was that it was unflinching honesty about the mafia.
2019;Goodfellas shows the mafia at its ups and downs.
2020;There are moments when you get that class.
2021;The acting was exceptional (but Liota's wife in this movie annoyed me a bit), the camera angles were good, and the honesty to the story was the best part.
2022;An original mob movie directed by a brilliant director.
2023;i have got to find a single sided version of this brilliant film.
2024;The actors are talented, reminds of me the godfather.
2025;This is one of my favorite gangster movies.
2026;I have seen This movie so many times And it still Is so entertaining.
2027;This is the best mob film ever.
2028;Scorsese's directing is on top just as are Deniro's and Liotta's performances.
2029;Joe Pesci plays the perfect psycopath and Deniro as usual gives a great performance as he does in every other Scorsese film.
2030;New generation, old tradition, that's exactly what this movie is all about.
2031;The directing in both movies captures the reality of mob life and how their lives end.
2032;The acting in both movies is superlative 3.
2033;I'm not about to say Martin Scorsese is a better director than Coppola, but I feel that Scorsese's film Goodfellas has more emotion than Coppola's film Godfather.
2034;That's what Scorsese does with his films.
2035;He uses music to enhance emotion in his movie's.
2036;He wanted to make this film funny and crazy because that's the way Nicholas Pileggi's mob life was, funny and crazy.
2037;Scorsese did this film his way, the Martin Scorsese way.
2038;This great film has been adequately lauded elsewhere.
2039;Seen this movie about 20 times.
2040;But, I love any Mob/gangster classic movies.
2041;Love the culture and time theme.
2042;What do I amuse you?
2043;yeah I enjoyed it :) won't stop quoting the movie

2047;After seeing this movie countless times, I still love it so much!
2048;This is by far one of the best movies I've ever watched!

2052;This movie has great and interesting narration by Ray Liotta.
2053;It's like an exciting, moving history.
2054;There are no boring parts and it definitely starts and ends well.
2055;If you ask me this film got cheated out of winning best picture from Dances with Wolves which doesn't even come close to this movie.
2056;There are many gangster films that rank high ratings but this one may just top them all.
2057;Live by the sword, die by the sword.
2058;After having dinner one night he got up to check his face in the mirror and saw a look on his face that literally made him jump back from the mirror.
2059;robert Deniro and Joe Pesci are, as usual, brilliant.
2060;His best seen is probably the one in the bar when he, Ray Liotta (Henry Hill) and others are laughing and telling stories and then suddenly the mood changes on a dime just because Hill tells him that he is funny.
2061;What's so funny about me?
2062;It's a very intense, powerful scene.
2063;In the special feature section it is revealed that this very same incident really happened to Pesci and Scorsese added it to the film.
2064;goodfellas contains first rate performances from the whole cast.
2065;it's a must see for those who love the genre.
2066;I advise a viewing age of at least 18.
2067;The hard hitting dialogue, with spine chilling humor keep me glued to the screen.
2068;Lioata gives the performance of a life time.

2073;Frank Vincent has a brief but memorable role as the ill.

2076;Great acting and a great story makes a great movie.
2077;Director: Martin Scorsese's The God of The Cinema, he's a gift from christ himself, this guy is gifted, and he and deniro, pesci, grew up in N.Y. coincidence?
2078;it's an eye opener.you feel as if your part of the crew.
2079;this is the greatest movie of all time.
2080;deniro's best role(and there are many) pesci's Greatest Role.
2081;there is absolutely nothing wrong with this film.
2082;and rest in peace with much respect to Mario Puzo .
2083;Just know that Goodfellas is one of my favorite Mafia movies.
2084;Everything about the movie is superb, and it deserves 5 stars all the way.

2095;Best actor awards should also have been awarded.
2096;Great sound, sharp picture, major improvements.
2097;Well first, De Niro is one of the most important characters in the movie (along with joe, ray etc.).
2098;The movie shows an accurate representation of the mafia in america during 1930 through to 1980(and beyond) as well as a damn good story.
2099;Each actor (and actress) give it their best and it shows.
2100;Watch this movie because it is the best mafia movie ever made, i liked it better than the godfather movies, but thats just my opinion.
2101;The story can be a bit intense at times even shocking depending on yourexposure to these kind of films.
2102;The cast is excellent audio and video were superb,
2103;Wonderful performances across the board and a riveting plot that's based on the actual experiences of Henry Hill, with that Scorsese touch of great cinematography and ironies atop ironies.

2112;ray is so much better.
2113;This is a true story.
2114;Tells the story of how the mob won project after project, yet in the end ended up loosing to the authorities.
2115;Movie constantly paused to load.
2116;One of my favorite mobster type movies.
2117;De Niro and Pesci were great.
2118;there are numerous other stars in this one.
2119;It's as captivating as it was when I first saw it, and now it's been polished for the new era in home theater.
2120;Beautiful visuals and crisp sound.
2121;Well acted, true docudrama about the inner workings of the mob.
2122;This movie will hold your interest to the end.
2123;This is a movie you can watch more than once.
2124;Perfict ensamble cast for a great movie.
2125;This is the second greatest mafia movie ever made in my opinion, the greatest being (The Godfather), this movie has great action, great acting, including an unforgetable performance by Joe Pesci, great writing and directing, an american masterpiece.
2126;Enjoyed movie given that it is based on a true story.
2127;it's the power of amorality, brought into crystal clear focus by Martin Scorsese.
2128;brilliant film, full of marvelous performances and wonderful moments.
2129;definitely one of my top 5 favorite movies.
2130;i got a made in mexico version.

2132;The honesty and reality of this movie is unparalelled.
2133;Everyone turns in a performance of a lifetime.
2134;Including Ray Liotta, who needs to work more.
2135;This movie established me as Liotta fan for life.
2136;this and the godfather are definitly the best mafia films ever.
2137;but as the godfather glamorized a life of crime, this gives the real facinating truth.
2138;liotta, De Niro, and pesci all give great performances, and ofcourse scorrsese is one of the best directors of our time.
2139;so i seriously reccomend this movie to anyone.
2140;Even if you're not into mob movies, you'll still enjoy it.
2141;not only the best gangster movie ever made, but one of the best American movies ever made.
2142;the entire cast is amazing and the period music used for the sountrack (there is no Goodfellas theme) is just great.
2143;The acting and the actors, as always , superb.
2144;If you haven't ever seen this one, put it on your bucket movie list !
2145;it's just a great movie.
2146;I was super excited when I received this movie.
2147;I have seen it in a long time so I was really into it.
2148;Now I can finally understand of of the Daily show references to this movie.
2149;Goodfellas is based on Wiseguy, Nicholas Pileggi's biographical novel about the life of mobster.
2150;Scorsese succeeds in getting the audience inside of this world.
2151;Robert DeNiro gives one of the best performances of his career as Jimmy, who starts out level.
2152;Joe Pesci is fantastic at conveying Tommy DeVito's unfortunate combination of easily bruised ego and itchy trigger finger.
2153;Lorraine Bracco is a convincing mafia wife, but her performance is at its most interesting when she first discovers how truly bizarre the domestic lives of mob wives are.
2154;Paul Sorvino gives a nice supporting performance as the patriarch of this extended family.
2155;This brings me to the starring performance of Ray Liotta: Sometimes I felt that Liotta was appropriate for the role of Henry Hill, and other times I thought that his line delivery was wrong.
2156;But, overall, his performance is convincing enough.
2157;Goodfellas is an entertaining look inside inside an iconic American subculture.
2158;The most challenging aspect of making a gangster film based on a true story may be making the characters interesting.
2159;Martin Scorsese accomplishes this by using the camera to immerse the audience into the world of these wiseguys.
2160;They are interesting within their own circles, so they become interesting to us.
2161;Goodfellas displays some of Scorsese's most masterful and seductive work.
2162;It contains some great performances, and it gives us a window into the culture of organized crime.
2163;Gangster movies must have the highest rate of being true stories of any film genre.
2164;The movie is on both sides of the disc, and you have to flip the disc in order to finish watching it.
2165;The only real bonus features are a few pages of production notes and the ability to subtitle the film in English, French, or Spanish.
2166;But I thought the movie went on for longer than it should have!
2167;This is one of the greatest mob movies of all time .
2168;definitely one of my favorite mob movies.
2169;robert de niro is amazingly good in this film, as is the rest of the stellar cast!
2170;issue, becase I'm sure that's gotta be in the works.
2171;Amazing film, great cast, tremendous production design!
2172;One if the best films of its time.
2173;One of the best films ever made.
2174;Should have gotten a best picture Oscar!
2175;Great story line as well.
2176;It has a lot of my favorite actors in the movie and I highly recommend it.
2177;Goodfellas ranks right up there with the 1st two Godfather movies.
2178;Good Fellas is one of the greatest mob movies of all time, directed by one of the greatest directors, and starring some of the most talented actors of all time.
2179;How could you not respect a masterpiece of this calaber?Good Fellas is the story of Henry Hill, the most famous turncoat in Mafia history.
2180;He even has his own website now.
2181;This movie is insanely good!
2182;With out doubt one of the best mob movies ever made.
2183;This movie is the true story of Liotta's character getting into to the mob at a very young age and moving up the ranks.
2184;This is truly a classic among classics this is a must own and it really is one of the best movies ever made!
2185;What a cast of greats!
2186;Plus Scorsese writing and directing.
2187;NOW ABOUT THE FILM ITSELF.
2188;My brother kept saying, oh you gotta see goodfellas have you seen it, so I watched it, and was enjoying deniro and liotta, and up until one of the most nauseating scenes I had to shut it off for time out.
2189;Don't miss this movie, it's as rare as hens teeth!
2190;Good fellas has some funny moments, like the you're a funny guy scene, but this movie is too much like a real life story to be good entertainment.
2191;so, I guess the main value of this movie is a somewhat entertaining semi.
2192;Plays a super role as a boy who from a young age is seduced by the criminal lifestyle, the flash cars, money, and gorgeous women.
2193;A superb movie and a must have.
2194;I returned it to the store that day and I waited for this new 2 disc version and the movie.
2195;Now I can watch the film without interruption.
2196;this a one of the greatest gangster films of all time ever!
2197;I'm from the Godfather era, so everything after the first two installments of GF is almost as good.
2198;That doesn't matter though because this is one of the best films of all time.
2199;'Goodfellas' surpasses even these with the sheer truth of it.
2200;This was the film Ray Liotta was destined to make in my opinion.
2201;guy imparts his whole world for our delight and delectation, laughing at us as he does so.
2202;'Goodfellas' is immensely funny, shocking, kinda' sexy and wonderfully suspenseful.
2203;excellent movie from the opening shot to the righteous end.
2204;Great movie, even after all these years.
2205;The casting, acting, direction, and cinematography are all excellent.
2206;Goodfellas is that movie, I my opinion it's better than The Godfather, because this injects a slightly more humorous side to the tale of Harry Hill and his Mafia pals.
2207;Surely Warners coud release a special edition of this movie and keep it all on one side.
2208;I've awarded this movie 3 stars because the movie is still powerful it's just annoying that Warners looked at the cheap opinion of manufactuer on this wonderful movie.
2209;This is by far the best of the awesome Robert de Niro films, the best collaboration between De Niro and Scorcese, and the best film of the last 25 years.
2210;Hell, the best film ever made, lets call it what it is!
2211;This is one of my favorite movies ever in the history of cinema.
2212;I always enjoy a good movie, this one is a classics gangster movie with a great cast.
2213;People say this movie is great, or The Best , but I just thought it was a good movie.
2214;It is based on a true story and has fantastic commentary.
2215;I have ADD with movies, and this one kept me focused on it and loving it the whole time.
2216;This movie has got to be one of Martin Scorsese's best.
2217;It ranks right up there with Taxi Driver and Raging Bull .
2218;I have always thought of Martin Scorsese as of the best directors we have today.
2219;He always seems to a have a great attention to detail and always directs his actors/actresses into giving tour.
2220;The film won both Best Picture and Best Director awards from the New York Film Critics as well as numerous Academy Award nominations including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Supporting Actor (Pesci) and Best Supporting Actress (Bracco).
2221;the entire cast is exceptional, including Joe Pesci in his Oscar.
2222;I was very surprised that Ray Liotta never received an Oscar nomination for his performance.
2223;I thought he turned in one the best performances of that year.
2224;what can I say except that he's Robert DeNiro, one of the finest actors working today.
2225;He has such a great scene towards the end of the film where he just finds out that Joe Pesci's character has been killed.
2226;Watching him try not to cry in that scene is remarkable.
2227;nominee Lorraine Bracco has many great moments in the film including angrily confronting her husband's mistress through an apartment lobby phone and holding a loaded gun to her husband's face over his infidelity.
2228;The soundtrack is another wonderful aspect of the film.
2229;In the future I hope they produce a Special Collector's Edition.
2230;I bought two copies one as a gift.
2231;Still looking for a way to get movies on my tablet . . .
2232;One of the best movies ever!
2233;Still as good as when I watched it almost a quarter century ago.
2234;The steelbook is great, it stands out in my collection.
2235;One of those rare cases where everything just seems to click, Goodfellas is one of a kind.
2236;Revolving around the life of mobster turned rat Henry Hill (Ray Liotta, perfectly cast), we bear witness to his rise in the mafia.
2237;sopranos Lorraine Bracco) is along for the ride as she discovers more and more of Henry's other family which both frightens and excites her.
2238;Liotta and Bracco are excellent, and the rest of the cast including Robert De Niro, Paul Sorvino, and Joe Pesci in his Oscar winning role are the stuff that film legends are made of.
2239;Scorsese perfectly captured the time period, and his use of music in certain scenes could not be more dead on.
2240;more down to earth and probably realistic than something like the god father.
2241;but it completely broke my heart.
2242;don't worry, no spoilers here, but i definitely got choked up watching it and even just remembering it.
2243;The Best Gangster movie of this type ever made.
2244;The acting is great and the sets are so Italian art deco.
2245;Very well done movie in which is suppored by a well rounded acting corps.
2246;The acting in it is great and the storyline is very well done.
2247;love this movie and thanks again.
2248;It is a graphic and entertaining gangster film.
2249;This movie pars with Mean Streets as the best gangster movie of all time.
2250;Robert DeNiro is perfect as a nervous wreck of a man, and Joe Pesci is always crazy, but in this movie, he perfects the Italian stereotype.
2251;Ray Liotta is also exceptionally good, and the movie flows very nicely.
2252;Anyway, this movie is really good, has really good violence, and has no epic feel despite the length.
2253;Goodfellas what can you say except sit back and enjoy the show!I get gooosebumps just thinking about Henry Hills life story as Martin Scorsese takes you deep into the ruthless world of the mob.
2254;it's the kind of movie you can watch again and again.
2255;Of all of the mob movies that have graced the silver screen over the years, Goodfellas most certainly stands a head taller than the majority of them and it can be said that this film is one of the definitive mobster movies.
2256;Few movies, if any, can compare to the compelling based on a true story nature of this film and the graphic realism that is so brilliantly portrayed by Scorsese's direction and the exceptional cast members.
2257;Goodfellas is a powerful film based on the true life best seller Wiseguy by Nicholas Pileggi.
2258;the premise:Narrated by Henry Hill and his wife Karen Hill, Goodfellas tells the tale of how he grew up admiring the local mobsters, gained their friendship and then came to be employed by them.
2259;as the movies progresses along, Director Martin Scorsese does a beautiful job in displaying many of the aspects of the mobster's lifestyle and the many things that can happen in that lifestyle.
2260;from the opening frame to the final credits, Goodfellas is a gripping, suspenseful and enlightening gangster movie that bears multiple viewings quite easily.
2261;I highly recommend this film to any and all fans of gangster movies.
2262;I do find it surprising that this one hasn't been re.
2263;released as a Special Edition with all the special features, featurettes and documentaries.
2264;Best Organized Crime Film depicted off a real New York Family during the 5 family era !!!
2265;I love good fellas duh .
2266;Well written, directed and acted.
2267;All three main characters deserved an oscar, glad Pesci got one.
2268;And to think it was a true story, wow!
2269;The movie stopped in the middle and I thought it was defective.
2270;Then I played the other side and the second half was on the other side!
2271;Still 4 stars cause I love this movie.
2272;This is one of the best movies ever!
2273;Every actor is fantastic and there are just too many to name !
2274;Great mafia movie at a price you can't refuse.
2275;Goodfellas, #94 on AFI's list of 100 greatest movies of all time, is widely regarded as the best mob movie ever made by critics and audiences alike.
2276;Written by Nicholas Pileggi and based on his book Wiseguy, Goodfellas charts the meteoric rise and catastrophic crash and burn of tough guy, Henry Hill (Ray Liotta).
2277;Digital anomalies are completely absent for an overall smooth look that is appealing.
2278;the soundtrack to Goodfellas is a very finely wrought 5.1 presentation.
2279;Dialogue is perhaps a bit more front sounding than one would expect .
2280;The effects and music tracks really pack a wallop.
2281;extras include commentary tracks, plus a host of featurettes and a thorough documentary on the making of the film.
2282;Overall, this is a great edition to any home theater aficionado's library and it comes highly recommended.
2283;Great movie, great amazon service, very affordable too!
2284;Highly suggest this service to others.
2285;One of Martin Scorsese's best films.
2286;Great movie, bad BD copies.
2287;The simple fact of the matter is that the guys in la cosa nostra are just regular guys like us.
2288;family working on large jobs and managing risks.
2289;this film portrays a realistic look at the guys, who are not made.
2290;easily the best mob film out there.
2291;day basis, not the more exaulted position the Corleones enjoyed in the three Godfathers.
2292;You see the mob stuff juxtaposed with everyday BS that most of us have to deal with in one way or another.
2293;The acting is truly superb.
2294;Easily Pesce's finest moment, but unquestioned career highs for the majority of the other major players.
2295;The cinematography is brilliant (the Copacabana tracking shot from door to table, is an amazing piece of filmwork), the direction just right, the dialogue completely realistic.
2296;A must see, must own, many times.
2297;goodfellas is rightly considered one of Scorsese's masterpieces, a moment where a great filmmaker got everything right.
2298;Ray Liotta has a perfect sleaza factor working as Hill.
2299;This has sealed itself as one of the ultimate guy films of all time.
2300;The film looks and sound just fine, it's great, but how about some extras?
2301;Goodfellas has a trailer, whoopee, and again, it's two.
2302;This is director Martin Scorese's best film.
2303;It is the best film about the mob you can watch.
2304;The cast and story line give the viewer a front row seat in the life of a modern day mobster.
2305;Following Ray Liotta's character Henry as he grows up in the family.
2306;A wonderful film to watch, even at the 2 hour and 45 minute running time, it doesn't even feel that long.
2307;Anyone familiar with this movie already knows how great it is so I am not about to review it.
2308;Martin Scorsese's 1990 epic mob film on the real life Henry Hill (Ray Liotta.)
2309;Probably one of the greatest mob films along with Coppola's 'Godfather' films bringing all the action and drama of life with the Italian mob.
2310;Joe Pesci gives probably one of the most memorable performances in his career and the film as the sociopathic Tommy DeVito: You think I'm funny?
2311;Every aspect of the film was done with the traditional brilliance of Martin Scorsese.
2312;Great script, direction, and acting make this film one which you can watch over and over without ever getting tired.
2313;Definitely a film that should be in every wiseguy's collection.
2314;The 1970's to 80's timeline makes the movie timeless.
2315;I have seen it a dozen times.
2316;The best part is the description of Brooklyn in the 1950s.
2317;The supporting cast is better than the main character (Liotta).
2318;Joe Pesci and Robert DeNiro are stunning.
2319;Bay it, See it, Fall in love.
2320;The language took away from it being an outstanding movie.
2321;This movie gets better every time I watch it.
2322;It's just a great movie.
2323;The plot keeps you engaged, and the characters all have something to add to the story.
2324;It's one of my favorites, it's Scorsese's best film, and it's both fun and unsettling to watch.
2325;Ultimately, this movie is the world's ugliest love story.
2326;Scorsese does a magnificent job of balancing the characters' perspective with the viewers'
2327;It's just brilliant, the performances and the way is written, very dynamic.
2328;I think this is by far the best gangster movie of all times.
2329;One of the best movies of all time, in my opinion.
2330;This has a great cast, and brings home the truth, that it is a violent world
2331;Goodfellas is one of my favorite movie of all time!
2332;A RATHER GOOD PICTURE OF THE Mafia with a good twist on trying to put two lives.
2333;with their conflicts and disasters.
2334;Based on a true story, this movie is a classic with some of the best actors in the business.
2335;Worth the money just to see Joe Pesci as a psychopathic gangster.
2336;He is obsessed with this movie!
2337;He was thrilled to have the movie and even more excited to learn the rest of the story behind it.
2338;This is a fabulous movie and I've watched more than three times.
2339;Will suggest everyone see this movie.
2340;thanks for having this within the premiere collection
2341;This is by far one of the best Mafia movies by the master Martin Scorsese, I dont need to say anything more because its a classic and this kind of entertainment sells itself.
2342;Goodfellas is up there with Casino, The Godfather, and Scarface.
2343;Scorsese landed another hit that will remain a classic forever.
2344;It moves at fast pace, always exciting, saw it first 15 years ago, still riveting,a must see classic.
2345;Action packed and full of surprises.
2346;biggest surprise is that it is a true story.
2347;interesting time in American History
2348;If you like a good Mafia.
2349;film, then you'll discover that this is the very best one ever made to date.
2350;Only the best for these guys.
2351;The old conflict about some mafia members not wanting to enter the dope business also raises the stakes.
2352;The soundtrack is equally incredible.
2353;I love Deniro and I think he's a fantastic actor.
2354;his movies are all very very good!
2355;Goodfellas delivers every single time.
2356;The chemistry between the cast is amazing.
2357;Love this movie, and want to watch it every once in a while, so I bought this.
2358;arguably Martin Scorsese's best film.
2359;In fact it is one of my favorites.
2360;I also hope other studios will begin to see the light.
2361;But I also must say that an image this incredible is worth anything.
2362;In this 1990 true film adaptation of Nicholas Pileggi's 'Wiseguys, director Martin Scorsese takes us on a wild ride through Henry Hill's life mainly from Hill's point of view starting in the 1950's.
2363;Ray Liotta is excellent as Henry Hill, an aspiring young hustler starting out making good in his neighborhood fast lane gang and seemingly riding high with the infamous Lucchese crime family.
2364;The cinematography is fantastic and the music practically makes the movie.
2365;it's a fascinating point of view look at what happens to hoodlums as a result of their own self destructive indulgence and arrogance and that there may be real truth to the saying that there is no such thing as a free lunch.
2366;If I had to pick a film that I though was better than Goodfellas the only thing I would be able to say is The Aviator, another Scorsese picture.
2367;It's such a fun movie with great replay value, especially in blu.
2368;The picture looks awesome (for a 1990 film) and it adds so much to the movie.
2369;Goodfellas is one of the greatest movies ever made, plain and simple.
2370;A truly timeless classic, one everybody should own.
2371;Others have covered this already, so I won't belabor the fact that the first side stops in the middle of the movie, never mind in the middle of a word, and you have to flip the disc to see the rest of the best gangster movie ever made (and I include the Godfather in that comment).
2372;Although the great Robert De Niro is given top billing, it's really Ray Liotta who's the star, and I don't think he ever received the recognition he deserved for this terrific performance.
2373;Joe Pesci earned a well deserved Oscar for his part, Paul Sorvino is quietly terrifying as the local boss, and Lorraine Bracco comes very close to stealing the whole bowl of spaghetti from all of them.
2374;it's interesting to compare Scorsese's Goodfellas to his later and much inferior Casino.
2375;let's hope somebody decides to give Goodfellas the kind of first class treatment it deserves.
2376;one can portray American gangsters quite as vividly and realistically as Scorsese.
2377;Scene after scene holds the eye.
2378;Liotta and De Niro are excellent, but it is Joe Pesci who steals the film.
2379;The film is still a classic study of the Italian.
2380;american underworld and a great piece of film.
2381;Amazing from start to finish.
2382;Robert De Niro puts on a brilliant performance.
2383;This here is another one of Martin Scorsese's masterpieces.
2384;Goodfellas is one of the most influential crime films of all time.
2385;This film spans over three decades of life in the mafia.
2386;The movie is narrated through Henry's voice and mind, this movie is basd on true events and he chronicles all the events that happened in the 50's, 60's, 70's and mid 80's.
2387;The film, quite simply, is about what life is like in the organised crime ring and does it perfectly.
2388;This film is sheer brilliance, you can't possibly go wrong with this title, Scorsese at top flight.
2389;alright, this has one of the best soundtracks around and is a typical Scorsese film when it comes to sounds.
2390;The entire film is like one big compilation album, most of the scenes aren't absent with music, I think it's absolutely wonderful, it's like heaven for your ears and let's not forget your eyes.
2391;The direction by Scorsese is wonderful, the camera angles, the acting, everything!But one of the best parts of this film is the cinematography, possibly my favourite shots of all time is the tracking shot which follows Henry and Karen going through the clubs back entrance through the kitchens, and passages etc.
2392;The acting here is very authentic, as usual De Niro does a great job as mobster Jimmy, Liotta is brilliant as one of the leading roles who goes through the bloody underworld gangsterism.
2393;An essential film to Casino, Taxi Driver, The Godfathers, Heat, Fargo, Miller's Crossing and Scarface.
2394;The film: 5/5, the extras: 1/5.
2395;Still one of the best movies ever made.
2396;Since it'sA period piece, it holds up perfectly over time.
2397;Afterward, my friend and I looked at each other with a mutual surprised expression .
2398;That was a great movie .
2399;Scorcese is an incredible storyteller and, 'Goodfellas', like 'The Sopranos', has received such critical acclaim b/c of the believability of the characters and the creative way it is presented.
2400;A lot of the dialogue in the film was adlibbed by the actors, more realism.
2401;Break out a bottle of Italian red and enjoy.
2402;This is without a doubt the best modern film about the mafia ever.
2403;It takes into the life and shows the high high's and the dangerous lows through the eyes of Henry Hill, the real life inspiration behind the story.
2404;It is indeed a glorious time as we go through a quarter of a century with this man, played to perfection by Ray Liotta.
2405;I don't want to spoil to much, but this is absolutely worth your time, and don't call me funny.
2406;Acting, writing, directing, filming, al perfect.
2407;Great the way the movie unfolds and the narration by Henry Hill brings you up to speed on Henry's family, background, and the characters he wants to emulate.
2408;This is one of my favorite movies ever.
2409;The characters draw you in and I have seen this movie so many times I lost count.
2410;It is well acted, well written, and a masterpiece by Scorsese.
2411;this movie has a great cast of characters, such as robert deniro and joe pesci all actors/actresses did an ammzing performance.
2412;and its directed by martin scorsese, one of the Best directors of all time.
2413;Martin Scorcese has directed many cinematic masterpieces, with Goodfellas being the best in his storied career.
2414;Ray Liotta play Henry and he narrates the film along with his wife Karen, played by Lorraine Bracco.
2415;Ms. Bracco is annoyingly good as the nagging wife from a Jewish family who is thrown into the Italian culture.
2416;Paul Sorvino is Paulie, the family's leader and he plays him with the attitude and walk of a man who is worthy of the immense respect he gets.
2417;Whether it's Donovan's Atlantis playing during the beating of a man or the piano coda from Layla played when bodies of people Jimmy had knocked off are found, the music truly sets the scene.
2418;Again, as it did ten years prior, the Academy gave the best director award to an actor turned first.
2419;This time Kevin Coster won for the overbearing Dances With Wolves and Mr. Scorcese was deprived of an award he so richly deserved.
2420;And the transfer sucks big time, as well.
2421;DeNiro is wonderful and convincing.
2422;As many times as I've watched this movie, and practically know it by heart.
2423;Really good movies hip hop headz love this type of film.
2424;and so do I classic gangsta flick
2425;That said, the acting is first rate and the characterizations, while departing quite a bit from the the book on which the movie is based, are very well drawn and believable.
2426;Ray Liotta, who plays the lead role, narrates during most of the film, which at time seems a bit excessive
2427;frame scenes which I found did not add the dimension of 'realism' which the director (Martin Scorsese ) obviously intended them to bring to the story.
2428;Robert De Niro is one of my favorite actors with an incredible range of talent (check out his other films: The Score, Wag the Dog, Casino .
2429;Joe Pesci turns in a very decent job as a malevolent, trigger.
2430;happy, wiseguy
2431;surprising to most, Samuel Jackson makes a cameo appearance in what I believe is one of hist first roles in a major motion picture.
2432;This is one of the best movies ever!
2433;This is my absolute favorite movie.
2434;Wonderful move to add to my collection.
2435;I watched it a long time ago and its just as good today as it was back then.
2436;This is a must see classic tale.
2437;Other than that it's brilliant.
2438;Martin Scorsese makes great films is an obvious statement.
2439;At one point during the movie, a vertical line cuts through the picture.
2440;But then laughter turned to fear when I thought Joe Pesce's character was going to come through the screen and pop a cap in my noodle for laughing.
2441;It wasn't upbeat and postive nor was it colorful and fun like my all.
2442;time favorite movie Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo.
2443;Ozone and Turbo helped the community by saving the kid's community center, they didn't undermine it like these low life mobsters.
2444;Firstenberg knows how to direct, Scorsece should take some lessons and maybe one day he'll actually create a meaningful film that will be remembered for decades to come.
2445;You can't go wrong with GoodFellas, great movie and the blue ray makes it even better.
2446;The extras are nice to have when you want a little more history about what inspired the movie and it will be enjoyed thoroughly.
2447;Excellent, moving, thrilling, tough, powerfull and that's just Robert De Niro.
2448;Fast paced action, trials and tribulations in a mafia family, deceipt, power, money, betrayal and all put together with De Niro, Pesci and Liota.
2449;A classic which will definitely go down in history as one of the top 10!!
2450;Despite the fact that both movies romantically glamorize the Italian Mafia, the Godfather presents a portrayal of the Mafia that represents an institution guided by ancient tradition and virtues like loyalty, honor, and solidarity.
2451;Even though there are elements of that in Goodfellas, Scorsese adds his own perspective that seems to present a new generation of Italian gangsters who are not quite as nostalgic about those old traditions.
2452;What they are very nostalgic about is getting richer and richer, and attaining those riches by any means necessary.
2453;based on a true story told in best.
2454;The book, as well as the film, chronicled thirty years in the life of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), Irish.
2455;Smitten with the wealth, influence and privileges of the men connected with Mafia, Henry is seduced by their lifestyle as thirteen year.
2456;piling enormous wealth from their criminal schemes that would climax with one of the most spectacular robberies in American history.
2457;one of the many things that make this movie work is the cast itself.
2458;Full of great acting talents, these are memorable performances from everyone
2459;In addition, I loved the character narration in the movie, which helps to bring the viewer a more in.
2460;depth and personal insight into each of the main characters.
2461;overall, this highly influential movie broke new ground, raised the bar for this genre, and set the standard for many movies afterward.
2462;The story, the acting, the great dialog, the directing and attractive story.
2463;Arguably Scorsese's best film, Goodfellas is one to add to your personal collection.
2464;Goodfellas is one of the best of its genre.
2465;Based on facts, it is violent and graphic, with excellent acting throughout.
2466;At times, the storyline becomes muddled with too many characters, but it's still entertaining.
2467;The picture and audio are very good and you don't have to flip the movie to see the whole movie.
2468;great stars, great drama, great story.
2469;For those who like The Godfather and The Sopranos, you will like this movie too.
2470;This is a movie that I can watch over and over.
2471;Always engaging me throughout the flick.
2472;for me, this is Martin Scorcese Best movie.
2473;the performances from stars to extras work seamlessly.
2474;how u doing!Watched this movie over 100 times!Well directed and still can't be beat!Robert deniro is the best and really makes this movie come to life.
2475;Based off a true story this movie is my life.
2476;One of the best movies I've ever seen!
2477;The movie is great for anyone that has not seen it.
2478;In the extras there is an interview with the Henry Hill played by Ray Liotta and an option to play the movie with Henry Hill and the fed that set him up in witness protection narrating throughout the movie together.
2479;This movie is one of those rare gems where all elements come together perfectly and create a master piece.
2480;This based on a true story tale of the rise and fall of a mid.
2481;It follows the story of Henry Hill, who starts the life of a wise guy when still a kid, rises in power and wealth, and ultimately meets the fate all wise guys do.
2482;Scorsese, De Niro and Pesci hit their collaborative crescendo here, and Ray Liotta was cast perfectly as the impressionable Hill.
2483;The characters are all completely credible.
2484;The direction and the editing are amazing.
2485;The music is spot on.
2486;Anyone that loves gangster movie will enjoy this very well made film.
2487;I watched it start to end many of times and every time i enjoyed it just as much 3more words
2488;This movie is a wonderful piece of work about the life of the Mafia in the 70s.
2489;Goodfellows got alot of attention when it came out.
2490;Martine Scorcese is absolutely brilliant!
2491;And Joe Pesci plays Tommy DeVito, a full Italian who will some day be the boss in Liotta's well.
2492;This film focuses the most on Liotta and this is the movie that no joke made all three of these talented actors.
2493;This is also from the maker of Casino , another great film by Scorcese.
2494;But, Goodfellas is the better of the two.
2495;Pesci roles in both films are very similar and he is funny and entertaining in both.
2496;Goodfellas is one of my favorites and I will recommened it to just about anyone who can understand it and like it as much as I did.
2497;I feel that this movie was a good representation of the mob way of life for the individuals that where involved during that time.
2498;Its one of thre best mob movies that i have seen, it was one of my first mob movies to see
2499;One if my top five flicks.
2500;It will still be one of the all time best movies.
2501;There's a reason De Niro is well.
2502;He carries this film from beginning to end, with aplomb.
2503;it's one of the best movies ever.
2504;To hell with the AFI, this is arguably one of the top 10 American movies ever made!
2505;Maybe it's only a minor peeve, but still, this is the kind of thing you'd expect a studio to clean up for a special edition.
2506;The package incorrectly lists Spanish as the alternate language
2507;Of the 2 commentaries, the track with real.
2508;length Scorsese, Pesci, Liotta &/or Bracco commentary (I didn't dare to hope for Robert De Niro, I mean, be serious), with some funny stories or moviemaking info.
2509;specific commentary illusion when she talks about having watched the movie on the morning she's being interviewed) and editor Thelma Schoonmaker drop some funny thoughts.
2510;of documentary: Martin Scorsese is a great director.
2511;Only 5 words to remember this time: 'Goodfellas' is a brilliant movie.
2512;jeez, even Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves has better features than this!!
2513;if you've got a normal full.
2514;And being that this is Blu.
2515;There's also a pretty nice booklet about 30 pages long with stills from the movie.
2516;The problem is, this is recycled content
2517;Once again, all people wanted was a little decent treatment given to one of the best movies ever produced by a major studio.
2518;All time great, number 1 mobster movies of all time.
2519;One of the great mob movies of all time.
2520;Everything about Casino that ended up awful was fantastic in Goodfellas.
2521;From the outside, we're perfectly aware that they, and their band of assorted outlaws, are mostly comic relief for the actual made men in the area
2522;When it happens, it's pure screen magic.
2523;Then comes the denouement, and Scorsese proves himself a master of pace.
2524;simply put, an amazing piece of moviemaking.
2525;i have loved this film since its release,but I always thought the film slowed to a crawl after the scenes showing the remains of various family members
2526;an amazing thing to behold !
2527;the story the characters the editing camera work art direction casting acting.
2528;gets material he or she knows !
2529;the right people and a miracle happens.
2530;and sordid is fine for what it is.
2531;speak of a humanity that penetrates the heart and soul.
2532;and there are hundreds of these amazing movies.
2533;movie making doesnt get much better than this and it reigns up there in the great pantheon of all time amazing movies.
2534;bravo scorsese and company !
2535;THis is one of the best movies that I have ever seen.
2536;I have watched this at least 15 times, and have enjoyed it every single time as more detail comes through.
2537;The characters are extremely subtle and the acting is absolutely first rate.
2538;While certain of the characters are composites, such as Tommy, the story is essentially true.
2539;One of the several reasons I admire Scorcese so much is his talent (indeed genius) for creating so. called minor but nonetheless memorable, indeed unforgettable characters.
2540;Cicero embodies menace precisely because his personality is so understated.
2541;The former is anchored in local experience, somewhat small.
2542;He is at his best when dramatizing the dynamics of verbal and physical violence in small scale (e. g. Raging Bull and The Gangs of New York).
2543;In my opinion, like Tolstoy, Scorcese's vision may be epic in certain films but the impact of his art is best measured in quite human terms.
2544;love the beginning and middle section, could use a better ending.
2545;The movie is simply amazing, I've watched it dozens of times over the years.
2546;This is the greatest movie ever.
2547;If you liked the Godfather, you'll love this movie.
2548;Well written, well directed, the cast is very well though out.
2549;Even if you didn't know the story behind the film you would still be glued to see what happen next.
2550;A remarkable film which is fast paced and exciting.
2551;The stories characters and world sticks with you due to great performances and vibrant direction.
2552;Naturally, this is a great movie.
2553;Being able to watch it on my Kindle was incredible and seemed so much like a privilege.
2554;the movie selections are incredible and I love being able to pull up one when I have to wait.
2555;day life of three members of the Mafia as they try to rise up the ranks.
2556;martin Scorsese (Gangs of New York, Casino, Cape Fear, Raging Bull) delivers in Goodfellas, perhaps his best movie.
2557;Scorsese does a wonderful job of allowing the music to set the mood.
2558;Scorsese depicts very dark images well.
2559;joe Pesci, and his little man complex are wonderful once again.
2560;This little man complex he developed and depicted to perfection in Goodfellas definitely helped him later grab the roles in Casino, Home Alone 1 and 2, My Cousin Vinny, and A Bronx Tale.
2561;Pesci really had a coming out party in Goodfellas, and it was wonderful to watch unfold.
2562;Scarface is brilliant from beginning to end, while Hill punks out at the end.
2563;I must say for that reason alone, Goodfellas is the second greatest Mob movie of all time.
2564;Great classic movie in gangster genre.
2565;the exercise will do you good.
2566;Goodfellas shaped my life, having first seen it when I was 10.
2567;The pure jolt of energy that leaps off the screen.
2568;is powerful enough to make even the most ardent 18th century Anthony Hopkins period.
2569;The epic sweep in Goodfellas rivals that of any more respectable drama you could think up.
2570;Liotta, with the face of an angel and the mind of a devil.
2571;They all make the best crew.
2572;received fast and in great condition.
2573;The acting is superb as is the story line.
2574;Based on a true story of the major robbery at JFK airport in NYC it is a gritty tale presentedstrictly from the point of view of the criminals specifically the Ray Liotta character.
2575;I have watched this movie a number of times and I still love it.
2576;This film is quite frankly a masterpiece of storytelling, and it does an excellent job of explaining how it might be to be on the inside of organized crime.
2577;This is the story of petty gangster Henry Hill, and is based on his actual, true.
2578;As Hill explains in the movie I always wanted to be a gangster.
2579;the film is great entertainment, although it has sufficient really bad violence such that this is no movie for young children or even teens under maybe 16 years old.
2580;ray Liotta is very good in this film as Henry Hill.
2581;Joe Pesci is effective as the rabid mobster Tommy DeVito, and Pesci's excellent performance in this film is what really caused his career to ignite.
2582;The rest of the supporting cast does extremely well also, making this film one of the really great gangster flicks.
2583;An accurate depiction of the time.
2584;I love this movie,three of my favorite actors, De Niro,Pesci,and Liotta, and I love Lorraine Bracco also I like her in everything she does what an actress !!!!
2585;Violent and language but most excellent characters and story of mob guys.
2586;Like the movie Casino or The Godfather series in its raw view.
2587;Not a date or wife movie but very entertaining.
2588;Love good movie making, then see this one.
2589;This is a top rated movie.
2590;It has an all star cast with De Niro, Liotta, and Pesci.
2591;The supporting cast is just as good as the main characters.
2592;This was a gift for my husband and he took a few hours off and seemed to really enjoy the movie
2593;Martin Scorse makes his usual wildly interesting well acted movie.
2594;all actors are excellent and the time of the movie flies by.
2595;You took your first pinch like a man and you learn two great things in your life.
2596;This was my favorite film of all time until I saw Being John Malkovich and still remains un.
2597;Scorsese uses his trademark scrolling and fast.
2598;With an incredible cast of Ray Liota(who proves in this and Copland that he is the most under.
2599;rated actor today), Joe Pesci, and the always incredible godlike Robert DeNiro the already powerful script is risen to levels that astound and bewilder.
2600;Note:Just because you like this don't think you'll like Casino, it proves team.
2601;ups don't always bring repeat success.
2602;Movie buffs already know that this is a great movie.
2603;For the collector this is a really great addition to any collection.
2604;The Joe Pesci performance is outstanding.
2605;I need eight more words this is it.
2606;There are not very many movies I watch multiple times but this is definitely one of them!
2607;I recommend this film to all my friends.
2608;Difficult to treat this movie seriously.
2609;but, it was a great movie.
2610;The best scene in almost any movie, maybe having Joe Pesci saying it makes it that much better.
2611;I will have to agree, that is a damn fine movie.
2612;the story of a guy growing up in a town where the mob are the cool cats in town.
2613;An easy income at that, too.
2614;this guy, played by Ray Liotta, comes up through the ranks to make it big.
2615;one of my favorite characters from the Sopranos (Michael Imperioli who plays Christopher in that show) plays a famous role in Goodfellas.
2616;a film that will always be a classic in many people's minds.
2617;This classic film has aged well and is always a thrill to revisit!
2618;Everything from the performances to the direction and the cinematography is absolutely top.
2619;notch, and the story is compelling and entertaining.
2620;But Goodfellas is my favorite movie and the best ever to accurately depict the mob at it's best.
2621;this is the tale of a rise to power for one man and it all being snatched away from him.
2622;One of the best movies of all time.
2623;included are some nice Special Features.
2624;Robert De Niro is AMAZING in this movie and I would recommend it to anyone.
2625;One of the best mob movies ever!
2626;Recommend for anyone who loves mobsters!
2627;This was a decent movie, very funy at times.
2628;It is a classic example of the Italian mafioso style movie.
2629;Me and my boyfriend enjoyed watching it.
2630;It also came in the mail at exactly the right time
2631;Getting that aside, this is one of the greatest mob movies ever made.
2632;Ray Liotta(Henry Hill) did a real good job in the movie as the man, and a good job as the narrirator, Robet Deniro(Jimmy) delivers one of his greatest acts in his carrer as a man who did mob hits since he was 16.
2633;This movie will keep your eyes glues to the screen to the very end.
2634;Trust me, if you loved the godfather, there's no doubt in my mind you'll love this.
2635;Depiction of organized crime was realistic and believable.
2636;Everyone played their role aptly under the director's watchful eyes known for taking care of even small details of the story.
2637;Very legendary actors and I am glad I got the chance to watch it again!!!
2638;The actors are top notch and exciting to see.
2639;GoodfellasMovie Grade: AGoodfellas, director Martin Scorsese's masterpiece, based on the book, Wiseguy by Nicolas Pileggi,the co. writer, explores the criminal life like no other film.
2640;with a runtime of over two hours, Goodfellas is an epic film.
2641;It is an unforgettable journey, spanning three decades of life in the mafia.
2642;Music from the outstanding soundtrack is brilliantly used for transition throughout the film.
2643;Over the course, we are also introduced to several compelling characters.
2644;Scorsese and Pileggi truly understand these men and really humanize their characters.
2645;This is also due to the film's stellar cast.
2646;Ray Liotta, with his expressions, pauses, and forced laughter conveys in his character deep guilt for the consequences of the life he leads.
2647;De Niro is also great as Jimmy.
2648;He has an avuncular way about him and although he is not in much of the film, he has a strong presence.
2649;His insecurity is introduced subtly in an early scene.
2650;This is one of the most interesting and intense scenes in the film.
2651;It is a very original way of introducing Tommy and Pesci is brilliant.
2652;His sudden transitions of behavior make for a truly amazing performance.
2653;There is always a sense of menace about him, like he is about to snap any second.
2654;The interesting angle of this is that is not a straight forward morality tale, but about the appeal of the criminal life and the lengths people are willing to go, the emotions they suppress, and the repressed memories they will experience to gain power and wealth.
2655;She knows that Henry has secrets, but even she is seduced by the rewards involved in living the criminal life.
2656;the relationship between Henry and Karen is one of the most interesting aspects of the film.
2657;Part of the film is a cautionary tale about the affect of living two lives.
2658;one of the most brilliant scenes in the movie is one which consists of a day in the life of Henry Hill as he tries to do a cocaine deal, cook dinner for his family, pick up his brother from the hospital, all while he is being followed by a helicopter.
2659;having said that, what holds the story together is the tragedy of Henry Hill.
2660;He is a genuinely good guy who cares for others around him, but his double life is an addction.
2661;This is absolutely completely misleading BS.
2662;it is just a tiny rectangle in a sea of black borders at 16x9.
2663;Preserve that 2 VHS tape presentation that they loved so much in the 1980's!
2664;This is also inexcusable that such a version of the movie persists on store shelves to this day.
2665;This has got to be one of he best gangsta movies of all time.
2666;It has the perfect cast and they all work together so well.
2667;com is that the Special Edition is going to be released this year in July.
2668;De Niro is solid and Pesci plays his usual psycho violent mobster.
2669;But the real star is Liotta with his creepy yet charming smile, penetrating eyes, and goofy laugh.
2670;It ranks up there with the GodFather, the Sopranos, and Casino.
2671;well you got to see him to believe him.
2672;I think the acting is very good and the plot (having been an observer growing up out east) is probably pretty realistic (of course jacked up and embellished for the big screen).
2673;I watch it along with The Godfather ever few years.
2674;This movie is a must see for everyone.
2675;Few films ever express a wider range of emotions than Goodfellas, a contemporary American classic directed by Martin Scorsese.
2676;Beginning when he enters the mob at fifteen and ending when he ruins it at forty, Goodfellas, which is based on a true story, will entertain you from start to finish, and you'll find yourself wanting to watch it again and again.
2677;Still, I'd reccommend this to anybody above the age of thirteen, and since, as stated above, the movie is filled with all sorts of emotions, there is truly something for everyone.
2678;At times a thriller, a romance, a comedy, or a violent crime drama, Goodfellas never ceases to amaze me with its astounding nature, and it is truly an American masterpiece worthy of the highest praise.
2679;Quite simply one of the best movies of all time.
2680;One of Scorcese's best, better then casino, about as good as gangs of new york.
2681;Its funny, its dramatic, its got good mob action, its got great performances, its got a good story, what more could you want.
2682;the best gangsta movie ever.
2683;I'm funny how, how am I funny.
2684;The movie actually stops halfway through and you have to flip the thing over to continue watching it!
2685;Something is seriously messed up.
2686;Great deal, great film, a classic, you will watch it over and over and over again.
2687;ray liotta's best film by far
2688;An amazing film that breaks all the rules in the boook.
2689;Engaging story, memorable characters, and many great lines.
2690;The PQ is astounding from facial blemishes, to the smallest details, very imprssive.
2691;The supplements are good with commentary, some alright featurettes, and a History channel type one hour show with related material.
2692;One of my favorite gangster movies.
2693;I have watched this movie over and over, and will continue to watch over and over.
2694;This of my favorite of all time gangster movies.
2695;It gets a 4 only because the film itself is so good.
2696;One of the best gangster movie.
2697;Full of accurate fashion and great acting.
2698;right off the bat, this is one of the greatest films ever produced.
2699;Godfather still rates as my all time greatest American film.
2700;But this isnt the Godfather, this is the real story of a real gangster, in a real mob family.
2701;But its great film made by a great director, and outta respect for him and it I had to speak up.
2702;I watched Goodfellas the other day for probably the 50th time and I have got to say it is one of those rare films that you can love and appreciate even more over time, .
2703;Being a long time Scorsese fan this is the film that got me started.
2704;This is the first one of his films that came out during my lifetime and I have enjoyed it a couple times a year since I was about 8 (not that it's a good idea to let an 8 year old watch this film, it is very graphic!)
2705;The direction is flawless as usual, the screenplay is wonderful, based on the bestselling book Wiseguy by Nicholas Pileggi (who co. wrote the screenplay with Scorsese), and the acting is fantastic.
2706;Joe Pesci earned a long overdue Oscar as Tommy, DeNiro is as incredible as Jimmy The Gent and Ray Liotta scored big with the lead role as Henry Hill which will always be his best performance in my opinion.
2707;If you enjoy gangster movies, genre movies, or simply movies that are incredible, you have to see this movie.
2708;OK, like anyone else I enjoy a good ganster movie.
2709;all it was a well done film with GREAT DIALOGE.
2710;Besides being a true story I loved Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci.
2711;I choose five stars because this is a great story with great characters.
2712;This movie gives the audience a glance into the life of the mob.
2713;well, you know what they say Warners.
2714;ray version is a solid transfer, and I don't have to tell most of you how great the film is.
2715;Assuming you don't already own the prior release, this is a worthy addition to your shelf.
2716;Martin' simply had to experience all of this to bring on screen something like this.
2717;Great seeing character actors in roles from 25 years ago.
2718;Dark but honest about the loves and lives of those underground crooks that we never really see on the surface of our lives.
2719;Kudos to Scorsese's visceral cinematic style, for this could quite easily have been your garden.
2720;the rough and tumble world of mafia can be intoxicating, as we follow our protagonist Henry Hill's rise through the ranks in the underworld (Liotta has yet to equal this incredible early performance).
2721;His voiceover permeates the entire film, breathlessly, in awe of the things he gets away with.
2722;The appeal of the good life is summed up brilliantly in the simplest terms possible, I was a part of something.
2723;It's both shocking and fascinating to watch these guys work.
2724;There's even an unexpected tinge of sardonic humor along the way, albeit the gallows kind.
2725;Plus, if anything, Goodfellas demonstrates better than any other movie on the subject how fleeting that heady charm is.
2726;this movie was a true dipiction of what is like to live in a italian neighborhood even today.
2727;Robert De Niro is one of my favorite actors and I especially like him in anything criminal.
2728;He's so cool in this movie.
2729;IDK, maybe it got better after the first 45 minute.
2730;A great movie about the whirlwind of living.
2731;I love the ending when Henry Hill regretfully resigns to the life of a smuck, a boring guy who picks up the paper outside his home.
2732;Luke, come to the dark side.
2733;One of my all time favorites.
2734;Brilliant script and incredible acfing.
2735;Best movie ever, I've seen it like a million times but don't ask me which I love best, this or Pulp Fiction.
2736;If you love Pulp Fiction, you'll love Goodfellas
2737;De Niro is incredible and doesn't fool around with his acting in this movie.
2738;This is the second movie, that I think that really made him (the first is the 1973 classic Taxi Driver by Director and long time friend Martin Sorcese.)
2739;If you like biographies, interested in Mafia History and movies and Love to see some great acting by a slew of incredible actors and actresses, do get this film.
2740;This mafia masterpiece will never grow old and stale with film viewers.
2741;Goodfellas is a good movie, destined to stamp its mark on the modern age.
2742;Perhaps because he uses a real story as his base, it has an oddly lopsided narrative structure .
2743;the film ascends to a nasty and brilliant climax two thirds of the way through, culminating in the famous 'Layla' scene .
2744;Still, it is a great cast and the movie is brilliantly filmed.
2745;Liotta looks a little overwhelmed at the role he has landed, but De Niro is sublime, and Lorraine Bracco is beautiful, brash and vulnerable as Hill's no nonsense Jewish wife from the five towns.
2746;based on the true story of Henry Hill it covers his life as gangster from young lad to middle.
2747;The film has everything, the script and direction are perfect and the performances from the cast are outstanding.
2748;scorcese peaked with this film and although he has made worthy and noteable films since, none match this one.
2749;lets make it really fast.
2750;Of course this movie is wonderful.
2751;Excellent acting, great story, lots of action.
2752;Who knew that this movie could be so good.
2753;Ray Liotta gives a performance so good, it makes you want to be a mobster yourself!
2754;Robert De Niro also has a good performance as Jimmy The Gent , but not as good as Joe Pesci(my favorite on.
2755;So step aside Godfather, the Goodfellas are here!
2756;Everything about this movie works.
2757;Ray Liotta deserved an Oscar nomination and this film is way better and more memorable than Dances With Wolves .
2758;It's a must for fans of the genre
2759;It's hard to pick what Martin Scorsese movie is the best.
2760;As a matter of fact, Taxi Driver and Raging Bull were the best movies of the previous decades.
2761;When I first saw this movie, I thought it was brilliant.
2762;Now, over 13 years later, this movie still holds up like Citizen Kane.
2763;Probably the best gangster movie of all time!!
2764;And without question the best film of the past decade.
2765;Scorsese and actors Lorraine Bracco and Ray Liotta gives some great retrospect on the grounbreaking film.
2766;There is also a few documentaries on life in the mob.
2767;note: I still get a kick out of many of the actors in this film who would appear later on in The Sopranos.
2768;He has made some of the best movies of the past 50 years, like The Age of Innocence.
2769;But the only good thing about Goodfellas is Lorraine Bracco's performance as a strong.
2770;joe Pesci won the Oscar for an overly.
2771;The statue should've gone to Graham Greene in Dances with Wolves, which rightfully beat Goodfellas for Best Picture and Best Director.
2772;Goodfellas dubiously opened up the floodgates for heathens like Quentin Tarantino to turn the silver screen red.
2773;interesting film is the cocaine that Henry Hill becomes involved in.
2774;This is one of the best movies I have ever seen!
2775;Goodfellas is an astonishing motion picture directed by Martin Scorsese (Cape Fear), and starring Robert Deniro (Heat), Ray Liotta (Hannibal), Joe Pesci (Home Alone), Lorraine Bracco (TV show The Sopranos), and Paul Sorvino (The Cooler).
2776;hailed as one of the best films in general, and best gangster film in particular, of all time, Goodfellas triumphs with an excellent cast, memorable screenplay, and accurate execution.
2777;based on a true story, the film follows Henry Hill, played by Liotta in his starmaking role, a young Irish/Italian kid who longs to become a member of the local gang led by the quiet restaurant owner Paul Cicero, played by Sorvino.
2778;His gang includes the Irish bred Jimmy Conway, played brilliantly by Deniro, and the guncrazy Tommy Devito, played by Pesci in the role that earned him a well deserved Best Supporting Actor Oscar.
2779;A fast paced thoroughly entertaining movie with an excellent musical soundtrack.
2780;The acting is top notch and the story is well written.
2781;Great entertainment value for the price.
2782;Worth owning and watching several times over.
2783;This movie was made about 25 years ago but is still interesting and has some of our still famous actors.
2784;This is one of my favorite mob movies and is based on a true story.
2785;One of my favorite movies, fast shipping excellent packaging.
2786;Classic gangster movie that always entertains.
2787;I highly recommend this movie.
2788;Great a. cting, great filmmaking, great story.
2789;Best way to spend 2+ hours in front of the TV.
2790;Violent movie, but it is a good one.
2791;I love the love story and the struggles througout out the movie.
2792;I backed the disc up and played it again, this time not stalling out.
2793;One of the best movies ever made and so many great actors in their early days in Hollywood.
2794;Joe Pesci is awesome and a badass mobster.
2795;This is absolutly one of the best films that I have ever seen, and it is also one of my favorites.
2796;Every performance in this film is flawless.
2797;One of the best gangster movies ever made!
2798;Martin Scorsese is a great director!This film is a must.
2799;I got it just in time and very quick!
2800;italian American gangster Henry Hill(Ray Liotta).
2801;martin Scorsese's Goodfellas is one of the greatest crime movies in film history.
2802;Scorsese's masterpiece is a successful blend of the satire and crime genres.
2803;The ultimate result is a realistic portrayal of organized crime in the United States.
2804;Scorsese's key players are perfect: Ray Liotta, Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, Lorraine Bracco, and Paul Sorvino.
2805;Robert DeNiro is the last of the great screen actors and is both menacing and convincing as murderer.
2806;Although DeNiro is a strong presence, most of the story's emphasis is placed on Ray Liotta's Henry Hill.
2807;The story is told through Liotta's eyes and he gives the best performance of his career.
2808;Joe Pesci is great as the almost psychotic Tommy DeVito.
2809;In a very tense moment with Liotta at a mobster get.
2810;together, Pesci utters a great and unforgettable line that is vaguely reminiscent of DeNiro's now.
2811;one from Scorsese's Taxi Driver.
2812;Scorsese and Nicholas Pileggi should also be praised for an outstanding screenplay.
2813;The film has a great dialogue that is both creative and realistic.
2814;Scorsese's Goodfellas also possesses a powerful sense of realism that is sorely lacking in even Francis Ford Coppola's Godfather masterpieces.
2815;Scorsese's characters talk and act like everyday people.
2816;I loved it when it came out and still love it.
2817;There is a reason why they call Scorsese a master.
2818;This movie is number one on my list along with scarface and the godfather, great gangster classic!
2819;Nope it does not, and Goodfellas is one of my favorites.
2820;De Niro is one of my favorite actors of all time.
2821;And all power to Joe Pesci for winning an oscar, for best supporting actor.
2822;And Ray Liotta was great also.
2823;One of my favorites in the genre.
2824;the first part is pretty interesting in how they set up the story, and how Ray Liota's character becomes involved in the mafia.
2825;This is a great movie that is suppose to be a true story.
2826;But I think it is exciting.
2827;And would love the life of popularity and respect.
2828;This happens to be one of the best mob movies I have ever seen.
2829;It also happens to be one my all time favorites.
2830;Ray Liotta is absolutely fabulous, Joe Pesci makes the whole movie worth while.
2831;Every actor does a wonderful job, although I am partial to Ray Liotta.
2832;Goodfellas is a raw adaptation of Nicolas Pileggi's book Wiseguy.
2833;The movie starts with his childhood, growing up poor and his infatuation with the people that were feared and the people with the power.
2834;the adult Henry Hill is played by Ray Liotta in the performance of his career.
2835;Liotta also does the voice overs throughout the movie.
2836;The great thing about this movie is how real it is.
2837;This film is truly one for the ages.
2838;Anyways, if I were you, go for the 5 pack scorcese best of set due out the same time and get 4 other great films.
2839;With share the love, its $37ish.
2840;The entire cast worked well together and the acting was so great that I lost myself in this film (which is quite rare) There are some really great moments in this movie that shake you up, and also some moments that make you have a great laugh.
2841;It came in the mail fast, and we would shop here again.
2842;Great acting, one liners, history, music, originality, and Martin Scorsese.
2843;The best mob movie in a class all by itself.
2844;Joe Pesci is top notch and the Robert DeNiro is seriously in to his role that makes for a believable piece of work.
2845;This special edition has it all on one side and a bonus disc to boot.
2846;The fast kinetic editing and period music add immensely to the overall effect of goodfellas.
2847;Not since Coppola has a director been able to absorb so many elements into a gangster flic but make it a creation entirely his own.
2848;Certainly one of the more violent mob movies made, it justifies every action made on screen.
2849;By the end, one has an understanding of all aspects of the life including that of the wives as well.
2850;It is able to keep the viewer hooked for 2 and a half hours moving from point A (Henry's childhood) to point B ( His exit from the life ).
2851;Ray Liotta does a remarkable job in the lead role, but the supporting cast is brilliant.
2852;Pesci, DeNiro, Paul Sorvino, Loraine Bracco, and the rest of the crew make perfect caricatures out of the cliche gangster mentality.
2853;I think since it is based on a true story that did a great job of making it a comedy / drama type movie.
2854;They got the best actors to play the parts as well.
2855;It's a great movie that won't give you nightmares if a little violence or blood makes you dream at night.
2856;I laugh all though the movie.
2857;Wonderful movie, if you love the typical Gangster flixs then you should have already seen this!
2858;This movie is a classic and stands up as a great gangster flick.
2859;So many great scenes and characters and great writing.
2860;One of the best gangster movies of all time, comparable if not better than the Godfather (they both have strengths and weaknesses).
2861;Cinema verite at its finest.
2862;While it may be the best mob movie ever, it is one of the best movies ever.
2863;great colors,black blacks,and great acting,joe peshi steals the movie.
2864;this iz tha best of all tha mob moviez.
2865;Great movie for those who like mifia movies.
2866;robert De Niro is at his best in this movie.
2867;One of the absolute best films of the 90's and arguably, along side The Godfather, the best Mob/Gangster movie ever filmed.
2868;Package arrive in pristine condition and the shipping was super fast.
2869;Still one of the greatest gangster movies ever made.
2870;Liotta, Deniro, and Pesci are great together.
2871;Ray Liotta, Roert Di Niro and Joe Pesci, three of the greatest actors today put together in this outstanding, sick, twisted, dark and funny thriller based on Mafia and Gangster life.
2872;Outstanding preformance from oscar winning supporting actor, Joe Pesci and Oscar winning phenomenal legendary actor, Robert Di Niro.
2873;A true gangster film and oscar winning success.
2874;This is truly a collectors item and a must see.10/10.
2875;GOODFELLAS might be the most uncompromisingly honest movie ever made.
2876;This film can also be described as an extremely entertaining criminology class.
2877;So many of the movie's details strike exactly the correct note, right down to the food these guys cooked and ate.
2878;In voiceover narration, Hill (played by Ray Liotta) lays out why the Mafia was such an attractive career option for guys like him.
2879;good people who worked .
2880;(The book WISEGUY goes into much greater detail about Hill's activities.
2881;But Scorcese does a magnificent and sometimes hilarious job in making us understand why Henry and his cronies do what they do.
2882;the acting is something to behold.
2883;Joe Pesci steals every scene he's in as Henry's smart aleck, ultra.
2884;Paul Sorvino is in the role he was born to play as Henry's fatherly crime boss.
2885;Another fun thing, in retrospect, is spotting other future SOPRANOS stars besides Bracco.
2886;scorcese pulls out all of his directorial techniques to extraordinary effect.
2887;It's a pleasant surprise, for example, to hear George Harrison's What Is Life in that hectic sequence late in the film as Henry's world implodes around him.
2888;gOODFELLAS is also fascinating in that it chronicles the beginning of the end of the Italian mob's heyday.
2889;Greatest movie of all time.
2890;Goodfellas is, (in my opinion), one of the definitive films of the genre (exception of The Godfather, The Godfather Part II, and Martin Scorsese's most under.
2891;rated films Casino ) and one of Scorsese's masterpieces.
2892;Like his opening words I always dreamed of being a gangster.
2893;Even as a little kid, I dreamed of it.
2894;He's grown into a successful mobster.
2895;We see one of Henry's best pal's Tommy.
2896;Along with Tommy is the excellent Robert Deniro playing one of Henry's mentors Jimmy Conway.
2897;The way Scorsese tells the story is absolutely amazing.
2898;An amazing film, worthy of facing up against monumental films as Scarface and The Godfather.
2899;Although DeNiro gets top billing in this film, this is really a Ray Liotta movie all the way.
2900;It's surprising his career never took off after this movie, for his performance is really good.
2901;edition of this great film.
2902;A brilliant, ruthless account of crime and the perils it entails.
2903;worthy performance, portrays a novice who is schooled by two mentors, played by Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro, in the game of bullying, smuggling, robbery and murder.
2904;Martin Scorsese directs with a dazzling competence, developing some fascinating techniques of pacing and plot.
2905;An absorbing meditation on the underside of the American dream.
2906;I'm thrilled to see it on a 2.
2907;the three great Mafia movies are THE GODFATHER, GODFATHER II and GOODFELLAS.
2908;One of the best movies ever.
2909;I watch the restaurant scene with Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci over and over just to hear Ray Liotta laugh.
2910;Goodfellas is a violent, dramatic, visceral, and often very funny look at life in the mob.
2911;every actor is incredible, from Ray Liotta as Henry Hill, who goes from a idealistic young crook to an isolated and deflated man in the Witness Protection Program.
2912;Joe Pesci is simply great as the psychotic gangster Tommy DeVito.
2913;Robert De Niro is brilliant as always as Jimmy Conway.
2914;This is a perfect example of Scorsese's directorial genius, and the cinematography is excellent as well.
2915;Also, in a bit part, is Samuel L. Jackson .
2916;Goodfellas is a great movie, and a must.
2917;ray Liotta stars as Henry Hill, and the story revolves around him and his experiences at living at the top of his world, only to come crashing down due to drug use and illegal operations that led to his arrest by the FBI.
2918;This movie also stars the brilliant Robert De Niro and the equally fascinating Joe Pesci as Hill's fellow mob family members.
2919;liotta gives a great performance, having him narrate gives us a look at what Hill might have thought as his life continued to grow better as he met the mob bosses and their families, and how he became a slick young man with a wife, a girlfriend, and 30,000 dollars in cash that he pulls right out of his pocket.
2920;de Vito was the one that grabbed my attention, he was in some of the most funny and most shockingly violent scenes in the movie.
2921;From the funniest scene in which he is telling a story to his friends at a club
2922;Definately a show stealing performance by that man.
2923;critics of mob movies say that this is the greatest mob movie ever made.
2924;Once you watch this I guarantee you will agree with them as I did.
2925;tHE WORKADAY GANSTER: This takes a detailed look on the downside of being a gangster, from taking care of people, to being stalked by the FBI.
2926;This is one of the silliest movies I've ever saw.
2927;At least his character is likable.
2928;after playing the villain in Michael Jackson's Moonwalker he got a big head and thought he was a real actor, sadly enough that role was Oscar worthy compared to this.
2929;Really, at one point we are actually introduced to a character named something like Jimmy Two.
2930;This movie is one that I recommend.
2931;I enjoy Joe Pesci, but he was able to make me really dislike him.
2932;That's the mark of an actor with talent.
2933;I truly hope that was a made up laugh.
2934;It was fun to see them and think, wow, he or she became big and I'm seeing them then .
2935;It is among the top 5 films of all time, in terms of dialogue, acting, character developoment, plot, background music, and sheer entertainment.
2936;This is the rarest of skills.
2937;the only other films that I've seen that perhaps equal this are the Godfather (Part 1), and Citizen Kane.
2938;Both the direction and the acting is superb.
2939;The soundtrack is excellent even for those who do not recognise the individual songs.
2940;What I really like about this film is the look in the eyes of the actors.
2941;Each of them seem to convey genuine emotion and the way the film is able to say so much with so little dialogue is one of its strengths.
2942;I would definitely recommend both films to get a full idea of top class filmaking.
2943;Murderers often come with smiles .
2944;Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro chew plenty of scenery, but the real focus of director Martin Scorsese's mob opus is Ray Liotta as real.
2945;One of the greatest mobster movies and easily one of the top films of the 1990's, Henry Hill's novel Wiseguy is masterfully crafted by Martin Scorsese who showcases the lifestyle of a modern day gangster.
2946;ray Liotta, Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci turn in career performances as a mafia crew who live the fast life and fall as each one succumbs to their own greed or vices.
2947;Scorsese shows Henry Hill as a kid working his way up in a crew and how he is drawn to a life of crime.
2948;along the way he meets and marries a beautiful woman who knows what he does and accepts her life as a mob wife.
2949;The movie is filled with colorful characters and realistic settings
2950;another reason Goodfellas works is the masterful use of music to showcase the era, it starts off with Tony Bennett singing Rags to Riches and culminates with Eric Clapton's piano instrumental classic Layla.
2951;It is the wonderful soundtrack that sets Goodfellas apart from other classic gangster movies such as The Godfather which used more traditional classical music.
2952;The commentary with the real Henry Hill is fascinating, as he watches the film and confirms that much of it is amazingly true to life.
2953;It is really fascinating (and creepy) to listen to someone say something like oh yeah, I remember this, we were driving along and we thought this guy in the trunk was dead.
2954;The cast and crew commentary on the other hand rarely speaks directly to the film on the screen.
2955;It is a montage of comments from the Director, Producer, Writer, Director of Photography, and Actors (as well as others).
2956;Lorraine Bracco's comments, on the other hand, are really interesting, in large part because she is one of the few to actually talk about what is being shown on the screen.
2957;as it happens, I just watched Martin Scorcese's wonderful double.
2958;Pesci was so good, I wanted to Pop him!
2959;amazing story, after the death of Henry Hill in 2012, I bumped this up on my watch wish list.
2960;Amazing insight into the life of that organization.
2961;Perfect performances from the entire cast makes this one of the best movies of all time!
2962;A movie with a pure classic Robert DeNiro!!
2963;Would recommend watching if you haven't already!
2964;Got a great deal on this movie!
2965;Martin Scorcese will forever be the best gangster film director.
2966;He captures the essence of what it means to be a B. a. and makes it look enticing.
2967;The reason that this movie is so good is because its based on a true story, the story of Henry Hill.
2968;Without a doubt, this is probably one of THE definitive mafia movies in cinematic history.
2969;Love the characters and the acting is second to none.
2970;Great movie, not a dull moment in it.
2971;The story is told very well and though some scenes are for adult eyes only it gives a better idea of that type of life.
2972;anyone who is a fan of great ciinema, must also be a fan of this film.
2973;this is a true masterpiece.
2974;there is no doubt in my mind that the wonderful characters from the sopranos were influence by this masterpiece.
2975;this is as good as the godfather, and is true epic filmaking, at its very best.
2976;this movie deserved best picture over the .
2977;known as dances with wolves, and probably best pest picture of the 90s.
2978;Average transfer of a great movie.
2979;This is a classic movie.
2980;gOODFELLAS takes the story of Henry Hill, who went from being a petty criminal to a mob member amongst violent gangsters (Joe Pesci's turn as a merciless killer is shocking but brilliant).
2981;It's a fluid story, from the 1950's to near the end of the century, telling us all the interesting, violent and criminal things that happened in between.
2982;great acting and a first rate script make GOODFELLAS a contender for Scorcese's best movie so far.
2983;The finest film on organised crime since the 1930's.
2984;Being based on Henry Hill's unique account of his own life (the best document of its kind), it has a very rare authenticity that is otherwise only found in films such as 'Public Enemy' ('Goodfellas' cinematic daddy) which had a conviction and force that could only come from portraying events happening right there, right now.
2985;These fine ingredients gelled to perfection.
2986;Virtuoso camera work, brilliant soundtrack underscoring the visuals, razor sharp editing, fine performances from Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci, Lorraine Bracco and (notably) Paul Sorvino.
2987;For some reason, the narration totally works and the story arc from riches to rags is beautiful.
2988;This is, simply put, the best movie ever made.
2989;Dances with Wolves was good, but come on.
2990;Let's hope he continues to make great movies and gets the recognition that he deserves with an Oscar win!
2991;Nice to watch a movie with super acting and a intriguing plot.
2992;Without the touching moments of say, a certain Godfather.
2993;This film is rated 18 for a good reason.
2994;there is plenty of swearing, blood spewing, face beating, balls kicking, and general gangster kick.
2995;ray Liotta is very convincing as Hill.
2996;He lives in a dream world, everything is at hand.
2997;He was absolutely hilarious as the short tempered, short in general mobster.
2998;the film does a great job of portraying the close, but not too close relationships.
2999;As Hill says, the next shot could hold a smile on its face, meaning it could come from anyone, even your friends.
3000;It's gritty, and damn right funny.
3001;This has got to be one of the best gangster films of all time.
3002;Also Joe Pesci and Ray Liotta are brilliant.
3003;I have noticed that Robert DeNiro was in mostly every Mob movie ever made and I think that is great because he is such a good actor.
3004;If the Godfather films are your cup of tea, then you must see Goodfellas!
3005;Where the Godfather movies told the tale of gangster royalty, Goodfellas tells the story of the mob from a blue collar perspective.
3006;the performances are spectacular, the dialogue is sharp, and the cinematography is breath.
3007;Each song is perfectly chosen for its scene.
3008;a phenomenal piece of film.
3009;now, track number one is with the crew and cast.
3010;very enjoyable, but still regular stuff.
3011;cheek manner, very fast, very light, very funny (he says he was inspired from Truffaut's JULES ET JIM).
3012;so Scorsese was right, as Henry Hill himself confirms.
3013;and to us, the commentary allow us to see the film, and the world it describes, in a new dimention.
3014;also kind of scary with this commentary is that.
3015;towards the second half of the film, a lot of real names are erased with a buzz sound.
3016;among the cast and crew interview and the making.
3017;of documentary, the most interesting comments come from Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese's faithful editor and most important collaborator since RAGING BULL (she aleady worked on WHO'S THAT KNOCKING ON MY DOOR, their first film).
3018;Following the progress of gangster Ray Liotta and his relationship with mentors Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, Goodfellas is the kind of film you'll either think is a masterpiece or wonder what all the fuss was about.
3019;Performances are all outstanding, Scorsese's direction energetic and innovative, but somewhere around the halfway point you may wonder where it's going and come to the conclusion that great performances and grandstanding direction is all its about.
3020;good extras on the two.
3021;The story, the cast, the acting, the perfect soundtrack.
3022;I own it and I own the soundtrack.
3023;This is an awesome, engaging flick that's well worth the 2.5 hours it takes to watch it.
3024;Other than a goodly portion of F. bombs, this is a well deserved classic.
3025;Goodfellas has been one of my favorite movies since I first saw it.
3026;Great choice and a great price as well.
3027;Insight beyond the facade into the dynamics of the organization.
3028;Goodfellas is nothing short of excellent.
3029;The mafia is a very interesting subject in life.
3030;It's amazing to see how everyone acts in their groups and kills other people that act the same way.
3031;Goodfellas capture the mafia scene I think in a very accurate picture.
3032;I got this off Netflix specifically for Ray Liotta's performance (hot*hot) and amazingly enjoyed it enough that I bought it from amazon.
3033;It tells the story of real life mobster, Henry Hill, and his journey through the mob life and how he finally broke free when his friends were about to kill him (or so he thought) and implicated those very friends.
3034;The voice overs combined with stop.
3035;action photography was an interesting touch.
3036;The commentary between the cop and the crook, (Henry Hill and the guy who got him into witness protection) was especially interesting, as Henry made many comments about how he felt during that time and the people he admired, and one could tell that the use of the F. word was second nature to Henry Hill.
3037;Probably one of the best mob movies ever made.
3038;Outstanding performances by the entire cast.
3039;One of the great mobster movies that is loaded with amazing actors.
3040;This really is oney favorite mobster movies and I've seen most of them.
3041;Bought this as a Christmas Gift and I must say he is very happy with it.
3042;This is the best gangster movie ever made.
3043;plus it has some of the best actors, Joe Pesci is awsome
3044;Now you put Liotta in the mix, with the rest of the crew, and it becomes one of the most entertaining gangster movies of it's time.
3045;This movie gets 4 stars.
3046;Great movie, great actors, and a very good screenplay.
3047;Its a bravura sequence by an artist who knows how to make movies better than most.
3048;that artist, director Martin Scorcese, is confident enough to cast in supporting roles his own mother and no less an acting legend than top.
3049;Bracco strings along, enjoying the good life and raising their kids.
3050;The real man Liotta plays here wrote a best.
3051;Pesci perfects the first of many psycho killers he's played in other movies.
3052;Francis Coppola moved the narrative in a stately manner in his Godfather films, while Scorese drives his briskly here.
3053;Yes a classic gangster movie.
3054;Of course you have to get into the violence, shooting, chaos, etc. but it is the best.
3055;When you compare a movie like the Matrix and Goodfellas, Goodfellas wins tenfold.
3056;A huge amount of sales would go up if he and Pillegi spoke on the thing.
3057;If this is the fault of Warner Bothers, then those idiots should respect the fact that this is one of the best films in film history!
3058;Don't take this review in the wrong way
3059;wrenching decisions to turn on those who supported you is marvelous to behold.
3060;This movie is graphic, fast pasted and very real.
3061;Hands down the most entertaining mob flick I have ever watched.
3062;Oh, and the music was top notch.
3063;This is a creation of interwoven plots, ingenuity and fantastic casting.
3064;Everyone in it is well.
3065;worth watching as the plots unfold like emotionally.
3066;Scorsese is a master of his craft.
3067;Let me first start out by saying that I absolutely love pretty much any mafia movie!
3068;This one, in my opinion, is one of the best mafia movies because it was happening while I was alive!
3069;All of the major characters in this movie work really well together.
3070;I needed to watch this for a film class, so I just bought the cheapest version amazon had.
3071;If you plan on watching this film more than once, invest the extra bucks and get the newer edition.
3072;One of the best gangster movies ever.
3073;Gangs of New York comes closer to portraying that evolutionary process in a partially fictionalized slice of time.
3074;Good actors, good action, good story.
3075;We enjoyed stand up guys and so decided to watch an earlier film about a similar topic.
3076;It was good entertainment, and we enjoyed both.
3077;Everything from the opening scene, to the very end of the movie will have you on the edge of your seat.
3078;Viewed it again (perhaps the 10th time) and I was taken into this part fact part fiction world.
3079;I am stunned by the outstanding performances both their nuance and their intensity and authenticity.
3080;in any case, Goodfellas is a masterpiece of the epic gangster film that really came into its own in the late 20th century.
3081;I found it to be entertaining and interesting.
3082;This was a great movie and I would highly recommend it .
3083;Always kept me wondering what was going to happen next
3084;Some films achieve moments we remember.
3085;Others manage to evoke a time or a place through the careful marshalling of details.
3086;The real achievement of GoodFellas is that it does both things so well and so consistently.
3087;The amazing visual imagination of Martin Scorsese is the engine that drives it, sculpting one dazzling sequence after another into a cinematic whole.
3088;Unlike lesser directors, Scorsese manages to make the visual pyrotechnics look organic
3089;henry Hill (Ray Liota) grows up and comes of age in New York during the 60's and 70's.
3090;if you drive the right car, wear the right clothing, and use the right cologne or mouthwash, you too, can take part in the American Dream and become one of those smiling people in the magazine and TV ads.
3091;The problem is that few of us can legitimately earn the money to fuel that kind of lifestyle and still have enough time to enjoy it.
3092;that there is a great price to pay for living high without actually earning it.
3093;that Wiseguy honor is an illusion
3094;knit mafia family of the The Godfather is a literary fiction.
3095;The lifestyle is, itself, a drug that exerts a powerful hold.
3096;the large ensemble cast features exquisite work by Paul Sorvino, Robert DeNiro, and Joe Pesci, who is given the most memorable scene in the movie .
3097;the famous and chilling You think I'm funny?
3098;I would love to see it reissued by Criterion in a dual.
3099;I have to say that this is one of the best movies I've ever seen.
3100;memo to Warner Bros.: Remaster this epic anamorphically, in DTS digital surround, and make it a special edition, 2.
3101;layered disc and extras on the second disc.
3102;`GOODFELLAS' is the life of the gangster Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), starting from when he was teenager, until his exile under the Witness Protection Program.
3103;a perfect description of his life put in great scenery adding great music, cars and outfit from every period in the movie.
3104;this is probably one the best mafia movies I have ever seen.
3105;If you later share my opinion about it, I would then also recommend:1.
3106;The film itself though is marvelous.
3107;This is probably my favorite movie of all time.
3108;This movie has an excellent story line (based on a true story).
3109;The acting is VERY good, Pesce, DeNiro and Liotta do an awesome job in acting in this movie.
3110;Each scene in this movie, leads very smoothly from one to the other.
3111;i recommend this movie to any fans of mob movies, anyone that likes a lot of action and a story with a really good story line.
3112;Ever since I seen this movie it was one of my favorites.
3113;The movie itself I believe is one of the best.
3114;disc special edition is waaaay better then just the movie.
3115;This is one of the best mob movies ever made.
3116;With its great and true tale of one of the Lucchese family earners, it proves to be not only a great film, but also a great look into the world of organized crime.
3117;Right there you are hooked.
3118;I'm a big fan of Robert De Niro (he's my favorite actor) and Martin Scorsese (my favorite director next to Stanley Kubrick), so this movie was a true treat.
3119;The film is based on the real life gangster Henry Hill.
3120;this film is very memorable by top class performances by Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, but Ray Liotta steals the show.
3121;Goodfellas brilliantly and according to many real goodfellas, accurately depicts mob life.
3122;In my opinion, this is a true 5 star film.
3123;From the screenplay to the acting to the directing, it's a masterpiece of filmmaking.
3124;Very, very few films achieve that.
3125;So many memorable lines and scenes, its too many to list.
3126;I know this review doesn't say much, but trust me, this movie is a must see!
3127;True stories are the best.
3128;With superb acting, screenplay, directing, cinematography, this is a classic gangster story that I have seen repeatedly, and should not be missed.
3129;Probably the best gangster movie based on actual events.
3130;And recommend it to everyone as one of the best movies made.
