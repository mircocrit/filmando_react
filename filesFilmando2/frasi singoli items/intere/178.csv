1;If that was meant to give a sense of freedom from the stresses of the modern day world it did a much better job.
2;Walkabout is a truly exceptional film.
3;If possible seeing this on a theatre screen or at least a large plasma is ideal, as the heart of it is the awesome imagery of Australia's Outback.
4;the allegorical and metaphorical nature of Walkabout is clear and infinite.
5;Two worlds and civilizations have met, language easily gives way to gesture and sound, and love, the greatest unification of worlds, blossoms.
6;but the divide between the pure ancient young man and the tough, staunch urban girl proves too great for her.
7;this is a definite masterpiece.
8;A film worthy of school showings, be it elementary or graduate.
9;As a gesture of awe, respect and sorrow at the Aboriginal experience it has few parellels.
10;proof Fence (both of which feature David Gulpilil, who plays the Aborigine) can be it's companion.
11;Walkabout is a surreal film that walks the line between art house film and nature documentary.
12;It's worth picking up the Blu.
13;Jenny Agutter carries the film, since it is from the teenage girl's perspective that we experience the journey.
14;The relationship between her and the aborigine boy is timeless and universal yet fraught with the social divisions and cultural confusion of their experiences.
15;The British schoolgirl in her patronizes the aborigine even as he ensures their survival.
16;It is beautifully rendered, and ultimately tragic.
17;And it is the story of childhood's last gasp, and the longing we hold for the freedom we once had when all of our serious choices were ahead of us.
18;but you soon realize that you have found a timeless truth and work of art that serves all peoples everywhere.
19;Its mostly filled with scenic shots of the desert and a God.
20;This movie starts in Sydney.
21;They wander around some more.
22;jenny Agutter is such an attractive woman, and such a fabulous actress, that this didn't finish her career.
23;like most Australian movies, this has good cinematography, and nothing else going for it.
24;It also helps to explain why the public watch very few Australian movies.
25;Story was good and filmed excellently.
26;This movie got great reviews so I looked forward to watching it.
27;I'm an Aussie living overseas so like to watch as many Aussie movies as I can, and almost always enjoy them.
28;This movie is right up there with Killer Tomato's.
29;I saw it when it was originally released to theatres, and remembered it with such fondness.
30;I was giddy with joy when I finally got a copy.
31;He is equally superb with this movie.
32;Agutter is a wonderful actress and is the only reason to see the film at all.
33;It should have been done here as well.
34;Walkabout is one of the strangest movies I've seen in a while, and I definitely believe it's because the film was released over 40 years ago when adventure movie cliches weren't around yet.
35;From here the adventure gets underway.
36;They stumble upon a tree of life in one segment and I swear the music playing in the background was similar to Mike Oldfield's late 70's work which is considered highly original and influential but I have to question that considering identical music was released in the early 70's when THIS movie came out.
37;As a huge music fan and especially someone who seeks originality, I have to question how significant Oldfield's work really is when a piece like that is playing several years before his work was released.
38;eventually the daughter and son meet an African guy throwing harpoons at wild animals and.
39;speaking of wild animals, this movie does a great job showing the wildlife that's over in Australia.
40;The other commentators are all correct, and so are you.
41;I thought it was a masterpiece at the time.
42;dippin' scene, known and loved by generations of slo.
43;Yet nobody has mentioned it.
44;ray disc showcased what I consider to be the best features I've ever found such as recent documentaries of the actors who portrayed the film's main characters.
45;The Walkabout booklet enclosed with the disc is a keeper with strong stills from scenes in the movie and summary written by Paul Ryan.
46;Nicolas Roeg's Walkabout is a great film about the problems resulting from a failure in communication.
47;More of an expeience than a mere movie this is one of the great films that few people have seen due to its long unavailablity in the home market.
48;It is a story of innocence and how chices made in youth can have a dramatic affect on the future.
49;This is a film that needs to be seen both for its stunning photography and its story.
50;Do yourself a favor and check it out.
51;It does a great job contrasting the insanity of the evil white invaders (typified by the brutal father who tries to kill the kids and then shoots himself) with the kindness, humanity, and true civilization of the Aborigines (in the person of the Aborigine boy who helps the kids to survive in the outback).
52;Walkabout is a beautiful film about how people adapt to new environments yet are irreversibly shaped by their old ones.
53;As time passes, the children literally and symbolically shed their social garb.
54;They dress with little or no clothing and attune themselves to the wild.
55;eventually the party reaches an outcrop of civilization and the story comes to its climactic end.
56;The aborigine hangs himself and the sister dresses her brother in his hat and blazer and continues toward on to civilization.
57;Her husband comes home to tell her about his new promotion at work, but her mind is occupied with recollections of life in the outback.
58;the film operates on several levels.
59;On another level the film explores how subjective normalcy is.
60;In one scene the aborigine shoots and chops up a kangaroo.
61;I loved this movie when I saw it in college, but that was about 40 years ago.
62;Having also read the book, I know that he took his own life in the written story
63;Then he returns to the where the children are camping and performs his dance.
64;Beauty is basically a set of cultural attitudes, and primitive cultures usually have strict traditions of kinship and other considerations when looking for a mate.
65;This is private property, it's all private property.
66;Still a movie worth watching, but I no longer consider it a masterpiece.
67;I have seen it numerous times.
68;sociological, cultural, spiritual, and/or as a nature film.
69;It has stuck with all of us since and gone on to be my single most enjoyed film.
70;The good part was that, of course, I could see it on the big screen.
71;They would always be amazed at the beauty, the uniqueness of the story, the tone of the film and the emotional music.
72;My wife bought me the VHS tape a few years ago and it was the perfect gift.
73;I've listed my favorite 280 films and it remains firmly entrenched as #1 despite other great films being made over the years.
74;it should probably be rated PG or PG.13 due to two scenes, neither of which are graphic but place the film above the level of an otherwise excellent movie for the family.
75;What becomes clear when this happens anywhere on earth is what we share in common with each other, regardless of our upbringing.
76;Australia is also revealed in all its raw beauty, enough to be a major element of the film, almost another character.
77;The director's sense of his subject, of the proper tone to be set for this film is very evident.
78;He is in control, he is our guide into this world and, trusting him, we are rewarded with a story of love, loss, cultures clashing, wild Australian outback, native Australian merging with UK root Australians and all in the hands of three individuals who are a child and teenagers.
79;the innocence of the boy is a great treat in this film.
80;He is able to be a bridge between the two cultural worlds with little effort while his teenage sister and the aboriginy youth are virtually unable to cross that divide.
81;It's a filmed snapshot of our world, fresh in 1971 but all the same lessons fully applicable to today.
82;A shot rings out and the bullet hits the rocks by the boy.
83;He shoots at them several more times, then demands that they come back so that they can return home.
84;After a pause the father pours gasoline on the car, ignites it and shoots himself.
85;the movie is beautifully photographed.
86;The little brother is trotting along with the young man telling him a long and involved story about a boy on a ladder.
87;Not a word is understood but they both enjoy the experience.
88;The young man has painted himself and is dancing what appears to be a ritual of declaration to the girl.
89;this is on balance a wonderful movie that, for me, hasn't aged as well as I thought it would.
90;It's a film well worth having.
91;It's the human body .
92;This movie is an excellent breath of fresh air compared to the mainstream trash that Hollywood churns out, and it is a timeless and profound story.
93;After having viewed this film several times, I have come to the conclusion that it's probably one of the best films ever.
94;I think the scenes in the middle, with the three of them swimming and whatnot, are really what the film is about: finding transcendence, and that the possibility of that still exists.
95;this encounter which could have produced a lifelong friendship will end in a dramatic manner.
96;Because cultural differences are far more powerful than love or the desire to understand each other.
97;Simple story, simple theme but universal.
98;taking cinematography, admirable young actors and a light poetic touch are sufficient reasons to see at least once WALKABOUT.
99;It is also really amazing to observe how Nicolas Roeg has been able to convert this trip in the wilderness in a symbolic sexual initiation in the heart of a Nature that can only show the way to these young adults.
100;terrific video transfer and above.
101;beautiful shot this film looks amazing.
102;Good movie for it's time.
103;it may have to be viewed more than once to gain cultrual understanding.
104;i liked the sceneryThe best actor does not speak.
105;jenny is still beautiful today but, i can't make the jump from a dad trying to kill his own flesh and blood to jenny swimming naked in a clear desert pool.
106;One of the legends of Australian film, this journey into adulthood from an Aboriginal male and an Anglo.
107;australian female is a work of art
108;All great works of filmdom are controversial because they demand more than mere attendence.
109;That's unfortunate because it is worth the viewing again and again.
110;From the cinematography to the acting it is a seemless piece of genius which I will take years to fathom and fully understand.
111;It is a symbolic view of life and the clash of two diverse cultures as experienced by youth, innocence both imprinted by the reality of their respective cutures.
112;I hope all viewers will give this film a chance.
113;The rewards are enormous if not attained at the first viewing.
114;The story line is well.
115;described in many of the other reviews.
116;Thought provoking and poignant film, easy to watch the second time with the commentary overlay.
117;There have been few movies that have been so perfectly filmed(Lawrence of Arabia is one that comes to mind, on which Roeg served as cinematographer).
118;The beauty of Roegs images of the Australian wild and also the beauty of the young actress Jenny Agutter alone make this a very memorable film but also with that camera Roeg is making a very provocative study of human nature in two distinct elements.
119;And the competence with which he does so puts the film in the very highest class.
120;But also during a time when international cinema was exploring similar topics.
121;I think the two would compliment each other very well if viewed in tandem.
122;An intriguing study by one of the worlds greatest cinematographers using very modern devices to penetrate to the heart of one of civilized mans oldest attractions, the return to nature.
123;This visually stunning 1971 movie anticipates many of today's main social and environmental topics.
124;nicholas Roeg has organized these ideas in interesting ways that keep eyes glued to the screen.
125;roeg's wise refusal to sentimentalize his characters gives the movie much of its strength.
126;This rejection amounts to a telling commentary on the price the dominant culture has exacted from us in its demand for well.
127;Anyway, however you might choose to cut it, the movie is certainly worth a look see.
128;A couple of times, I was half.
129;screen and tell me how so and so has just entered the twilight zone.
130;the balance of the movie, however, is simply breathtaking.
131;jenny Agutter has a very natural screen presence, which is more than a little refreshing in this day and age.
132;Agutter is young, tender and innocent and is everything she's supposed to be.
133;if you're looking for an aesthetically pleasing panoramic spectacle, this movie is for you.
134;The exotic wildlife, lush scenery, gorgeous sunsets, the music of John Barry and the lithe, nude form of Agutter all combine to create a visually stunning film.
135;There are many parts that have a very surreal feel to them.
136;the thrust of the movie is the importance of being at one with nature in a more.
137;It is ironic that, at the end, all Agutter's character can think about is how pleasant it was to live in the wild with her Aborigine friend.
138;Got a recommend for this movie from a friend.
139;It is really a nice movie.
140;This story about becoming a man in the outback, is fantastic.
141;I had a chance to move there and learn about the culture this young man came from.
142;Just received my corrected blu.
143;This is definitely a worthy addition to my growing Criterion blu.
144;It's truly the amazingly loving detail that they put into each blu.
145;Overall an enjoyable story .
146;This is a great classic movie, and considering the politics surrounding underage nudity these days both here in the US and in Australia where it was made, I figured I'd better get my own copy before the wrong person notices that it exists.
147;What a beautiful piece of cinema.
148;A beautifully photographed masterpiece, which, through a number of brilliant associative links, and a languid pace (not slow), will leave you breathless and wanting more.
149;A perfect film I believe.
150;With just one viewing, it made a profound impact onmy friends and me.
151;We got into long discussions over the meaning, the visuals and the incredible children actors in the movie.
152;This is one of the most visually rich movies you will see, and you can share it with many friends.
153;I say this because like most of the great directors, he has a very unique and distinctive style.
154;I will say it's one of the most beautifully shot movies that I may ever see.
155;Furthermore, This film says so muchabout humanity and paints so many pictures in terms of growing up, self discovery and communication amongst human beings.
156;When it is the journey that helps define who we are.
157;This is a moving journey.
158;The enrichness dialogue and the relation between all the members of this forced expedition are handled with talent and eficiency .
159;This film and Do not look now may be the most artistic movies of that unusual, potent and original director: Nicholas Roeg .
160;ray version is sure to be amazing, although I do not yet have it.
161;The combination of Nicolas Roeg's vision, John Barry's resonantly beautiful soundtrack and Jenny Agutter's wonderfully sincere performance combine to impress a stunning, not to be forgotten experience.
162;A very unusual film for its time, Walkabout combines many themes in what is ostensibly a tale of survival in the Australian outback.
163;Walkabout is simply one of the best films ever made.
164;The photography and editing are exceptional.
165;The sound editing is better than in any other film I have seen.
166;still, the story, the scenery, the acting, and the direction make this a movie not to miss.
167;The failed courtship scenes before the second suicide are some of the best sequences on film.
168;Many other reviews here have pointed out the best parts of this movie quite well, so I don't feel the need repeat the praises for this movie.
169;one should clear one's mind of preconceptions or expectations, just watch without trying to judge what's going on first.
170;if you think an art film means it's put out by Miramax and has a sensual scene with Kate Blanchette, spunky and irreverant foreigners who win your heart, or lots of serious English folk with great diction .
171;Yes, the director's plan was to annoy you all along!
172;My recollection of it is that it is an excellent film.
173;This movie has its good moments and its confusing moments.
174;That the kids were able to survive is another wonder.
175;Throughout the movie there are sequences of flashbacks and what appear to be dreams.
176;In the end it has a simple message.
177;This visually ravishing, often surreal story put Roeg, a highly accomplished cinematographer, on the map as a director.
178;Interlacing jarring, primal images of the otherworldly Outback with the narrative story of three innocents in the wilderness, Walkabout is at once art film, nature documentary, and mesmerizing fable.
179;slinging native, is arresting to watch.
180;One thing I like about movies where cultures and worlds collide is that they're often very effective at shedding light on what it truly means to be human.
181;Walkabout does this as brilliantly as any other movie I've seen.
182;The film tells a great story, but more importantly, it creates just the right mood within us for pondering and absorbing the issues it explores.
183;The relationships that grow out of this encounter are poignant, yet realistic.
184;My experience has been that anyone who is or has been a part of an older sister/younger brother relationship has particularly enjoyed the scenes involving the girl and her brother.
185;After viewing this film I can confirm the fact that it truly is.
186;The cinematography that this film has to offer of the Australian outback is nothing short of spectacular.
187;The ingenious camerawork and use of special effects to bend the picture here and there really makes you feel as if you are journeying with the Sister and the Brother throughout the Australian outback with their Aborigine guide.
188;The story is quite simple: After witnessing the suicide of the father, a sister and her brother must make their way throughout the Australian outback and try to find their way home.
189;With his help, they are able to survive and trek across the Outback.
190;Once the Aborigine tries to court the girl, the movie picks up again, and soars spectacularly all the way to the finish.
191;'Walkabout' was probably his masterpiece, since the extraordinary outback locations fit his artistic approach to film making perfectly.
192;This film does not have the gravity of 'Don't Look Now' but it still manages to linger in the mind and conveys layers of powerful messages through its young cast and simple storyline.
193;See it on the biggest screen you can find.
194;Deeply moving at times yet I found the killing of animals hard to watch.
195;the relationship between brother and sister was beautiful and theirjourney was transforming.
196;I could go into great detail about the film itself, but that's all that's here.
197;I have yet to watch the features, but everything looks and sounds wonderful.
198;Also, it comes with a nice book, as most Criterion films do.
199;This is a wonderful film about survival, love, tragedy and loss.
200;Jenny Agutter, sensuous and delectable in her role as the white girl (The Railway Children) and her young brother played by Luc Roeg are alone and lost in the Australian outback.
201;Superb photography, a slow but elegant plot helps this film maintain its momentum from beginning to end.
202;This is a wonderful film that has been lovingly restored to its original format.
203;This exceptional example of cinematography was also the world's best look .
204;Walkabout is introduced in the film as an important period in the life of an Aborigine.
205;Director Nicholas Roeg seems to understand the various uses of this word as well and ties them in with the maturation of the film's core characters.
206;The parallels make for some very exciting social commentary and the film subtly layers itself and it's characters further and further.
207;One crowd may say that Walkabout is extremely slow and boring while the other crowd will hail the film as a fantastic artistic achievement.
208;Understandably so for both sides I suppose, but I do count myself among the latter group.
209;It also makes some outstanding observations on maturing into manhood and womanhood.
210;Anyway, let those inquiries enter your brain how you like, but know that this is a smart film that calls for some patience in exchange for it's great rewards.
211;It's a simple, melancholy and I believe universal feeling that's part of growing up.
212;Perhaps she loved the aboriginal boy that saved her life and she couldn't understand his advances as a child.
213;Then again, maybe she was just reflecting on what is no doubt a very unique and significant experience to her.
214;It's a wonderful film and Roeg pulls no punches to give us everything he has and everything he intends to show us.
215;many celebrate Walkabout for it's cinematography, and deservably so as its among the most beautifully shot films of it's time.
216;but it's a lot more than that.
217;Walkabout is sad, compelling and thoughtful.
218;using his skills as a visual expert.
219;we also see them surviving the harsh aspects of the bush with the help of Mr. guilpilli's tactics and Mr. roeg enjoying the natural beauties of the bush country.
220;If both she and her little brother had stayed in the bush with Mr. guilpilli and learned to enjoy the simple pleasures that the bush had to offer?
221;Walkabout'sphotography and the acting of Ms. auguter and her two young co. stars making this an enjoyable screen journey.
222;I liked the 48 minutes that I did get to see but can't give this more than 3 stars.
223;this film is an excellent cross.
224;well that's what hunter/gatherers do!
225;They hunt and eat their catch!
226;He is also the winner of the AFI (Australian Oscars) for best actor for 2002 for his part in the film The Tracker.
227;David Gulpilil also appeared in Storm Boy, and Crocodie Dundee.
228;trivia #2: This film is also well worth it for seeing a very young, and very beautiful Jenny Agutter in the nude.
229;Originally released in 1971, this film is characterized by great cinematography of the Australian outback and the rather strange story of a lost English teenage girl and her little brother who are helped to survive by a 16.
230;The girl, played by Jenny Agutter, is steeped in the ways of civilization and always distrustful of the aboriginal boy, played by David Gulpilil.
231;The younger boy, played by Luc Roeg, is the son of the director, Nicolas Roeg, and does a fine job of bridging the gap between the two older teenagers as he learns some basic hunting skills and finds ways to communicate with the older boy.
232;Even though there are scenes showing the children washing their flannel school uniforms, how did they keep their clothes in such good condition?
233;And it is the same with humans.
234;not my favorite kind of movie.
235;Its message is hazy and unfocussed.
236;And I would have liked more clarity.
237;I do recommend it though for film buffs and art lovers.
238;The scenery was great tho.
239;Saw the movie many years ago.
240;That film won the Golden Palm and Best Director awards at the Cannes Film Festival.
241;Its a beautiful film, told quite simply, over the course of an unkwown number of days.
242;and even this is an assumption based on their language and uniforms, not on anything the film really tells us.
243;I loved the way the film juxtapozed the Aborigine with the civilized world.
244;Although it seems random at first, when viewed in the rest of the film, it fits in perfectly in the movie's method of comparing the similarites, despite the obvious differences, between the two cultures.
245;as Roger Ebert pointed out in his The Great Movies II, communication is also a major subject of study in this film.
246;She was brought up upper.
247;class, and no doubt that is the lifestyle she enjoys.
248;True, no sex occurs, but the girls beautiful body is fully displayed at the same time as the young.
249;Its a fine line, and the film's director has walked in well, without losing his balance.
250;this was a beautiful film, and I'd love to see it again.
251;the white kids want to get home and the Aborigine helps them find it.
252;That end being a study of cultural differences, done in a very intellegent, patient, and much more interesting way than I've ever seen.
253;Most noticeably, for me, the movie criticizes the spiritual emptiness of civilized society and lets the viewer glimpse at some of uncharted territory's secret beauty.
254;The movie works fine on this level.
255;Indeed she is deeply rooted in Anglo.
256;only the young boy, her companion, is able to break down the barrier and communicate simple ideas.
257;there are points in the film that expose sexual tension as brilliantly and as subtley as I have ever seen.
258;Roeg decides to focus on particular elements and does so meticulously and with grace.
259;though that angle is shot in breathtaking, but unsentimental, beauty.
260;The shots of the outback are gorgeous, but they do not imply any false notions of peace in nature.
261;One of my favorite films ever.
262;Directed by the always brilliant Nicholas Roeg (Castaway, Performance, Bad Timing, The Man Who Fell to Earth, and another Top Ten for Me favorite, Don't Look Now).
263;Walkabout and Don't Look Now may be the two most beautifully filmed, most disturbing, and ultimately most erotic films I've ever experienced.
264;I've watched both many times over, and have never been less than entranced
265;Beautiful, with hypnotic power, Walkabout is an altogether surreal story.
266;This is a masterpiece by Nicholas Roeg from the producers of Clockwork Orange.
267;An aborigine is on 'walkabout'for his initiation into manhood.
268;Jenny Agutter's talent is obvious, as is her beauty,in an electric atmosphere permeated by an evocative score.
269;the whole production is memorable
270;This is a film you should not miss
271;one right after the other.
272;An excellent and thought provoking film, which is visually interesting and beautiful.
273;Although the soundtrack sometimes reminds one of a seventies wildlife documentary, the visuals and subject matter are timeless.
274;There is a strong message here that we should be able to set aside our fixed expectations and 'understanding' of the world and be open to new ideas.
275;This is, of course, what all great cinema asks us to do.
276;Jenny Agutters' sections of the chat are both revealing and well delivered.
277;The directors' contribution is quirky and I found it somewhat irritating that he did not finish his sentences.
278;Overall, a job well done and the extra minutes restored into this version are well worth having.
279;Great pictures of the Australian outback and the wildlilfe that lives there.
280;very talented for a 16 year old (in 1971).
281;I really enjoyed the movie and would highly recommend it to those who like nature and a good story line.
282;the fact is that this is a beautiful film shot with plenty of contradictions.
283;Violence juxtaposed with gorgeous scenery.
284;This Criterion redeux has a decent enough picture and certainly improves on previous efforts.
285;All in all this is a beautiful film to watch.
286;There are also English subtitles for those who need them.
287;So I read about the movie on Amazon and checked out the top few reviews and thought .
288;hey, my kids are 5 and up.
289;We'll watch this together to introduce our home study unit on Australia.
290;what makes this movie so fascinating to me is that it could actually happen to someone.
291;keeping her cool so as not to panick little brother.
292;it is a tension that is made aware to the viewer (us) in the middle of a survival story and some of the indifferences between the races.
293;great acting by all involved.You must see it to appreciate what I am trying to convey to you without giving anything away.
294;ray properly, the image freezes a lot of times.
295;This film is a classic.
296;It is one of those rare artistic statements that is bigger than the sum of its parts.
297;It deserves to be seen and enjoyed, repeatedly.
298;law gave me a copy of this and I thought Hmm, this looks cute.
299;There are terrific performances by all the young actors, including a young Jenny Agutter.
300;That's how great the story was in this film.
301;You might not like it but there's a good chance that you might think it's one of the best films you've ever seen.
302;Either way, you will be talking about it after it's done.
303;I should have stopped the movie right then and there.
304;And this is what gets me: read all of the positive reviews for this and you would think that this is a must see, great motion picture.
305;It's uplifting, light, has a similar theme, and is just as meaningful.
306;This is a wonderful film and has stood the test of time in a remarkable way.
307;It is a brave movie and still has the capacity to shock.
308;Jenny Agutter is absolutely gorgeous, holding the film together with a mesmerising, seductive performance.
309;And it is filmed beautifully.
310;It is a very interesting and beautifully photographed movie, but it has a number of defects that to a large extent ruined the experience for me.
311;a final negative element is that the nude scenes of the children, particularly the beautiful 16 year.
312;She took a role in the production of An American Werewolf In Paris.
313;We can all draw our own conclusions and use common sense to determine which form of society is correct.
314;going astray from the subliminal message of the film, Walkabout is one of the finest peices of cinematography I have ever seen.
315;Most films that have good cinematography are made by such poseurs.
316;They display it like a new Rolls Royce without a thought about flow or sensitivity.
317;Walkabout expertly mixes good cinematography with a story.
318;It seems so natural as you watch it.
319;You will feel more comfortable with all aspects of life.
320;Walkabout happens to be one of my favorite films.
321;Fingers crossed, that I'll finally have a Walkabout keeper!
322;the film which created the Australian film industry, and scandalized the British public!
323;the Cinematography is stark and breathtaking, but the shock for the 1970's British public came largely from the idea of a white schoolgirl (Jenny Agutter) falling in love with an aboriginal youth (David Gulpilil).
324;David Gulpilil is arguably the most important Aboriginal Australian actor.
325;As far as the movie, well, it definitely has a very 70s feel and is very impressionist / artistic with odd cutting and juxtapositioning of scenes to make a point about modern society .
326;The movie has fabulous imagry of the Australian location shooting.
327;A quixotic tale of survival and coming of age in the Outback.
328;Not sure I understand why the ending happened the way it did but loved the scenes with the Aboriginal boy.
329;This movie, simply put, is definitely a product of the 70s.
330;based exposition and important dialog, but the structuring of the film around three general editing devices that pull out a self.
331;now of course the film seems to have this strong anti.
332;human tendency, or even a strong anti.
333;This fits completely with the coming.
334;Can one honestly say she wasn't as intimidated by the nature aspects as by the human?Whatever the case, it is marked mostly by that deranged 70s artistic feel that is more famously felt in such works as Easy Rider and Taxi Driver, which means it's definitely not one of those things that sits well or can even be digested in one sitting.
335;Hailed as something of an underground art house classic by many in the early 70's, there was actually a great deal of talk about walkabout back then.
336;another great movie on African spirituality from Australia.
337;great great great I would recommend for all.
338;the insert material indicates a new high.
339;There is an interesting interview with Jenny Agutter, and a separate one with Luc Roeg.
340;But one of the nice added features is an almost hour long feature on the life and career of David Gulpilil.
341;The feature with David Gulpilil is both fascinating and worthwhile.
342;Interesting view of life as an aborigine, and the relationship he makes with 2 white children despite the language difference.
343;An emotional, deeply poignant tale of two children coming of age under the most isolating, desperate circumstances.
344;The boy and the girl begin a harrowing journey, their own walkabout, to try and find their way back to civilization and safety.
345;conceived and thoughtful, evoking emotions both deep and primal.
346;The movie was well done.
347;It is among the best in my very large collection.
348;I like this movie, but I don't love it.
349;be patient with it .
350;there are many layers to this movie, and Roeg (who studied under Truffaut
351;Roeg does a fine job of expressing the ineffable throughout, highlighting the things he want sot highlight with good camera work and then letting the viewer decide what's what.
352;there is much to be enjoyed in Walkabout, but many viewers are going to find the pace of the movie to be, well, glacial.
353;Roeg gives it a solid base.

355;I'm in England and I just bought a Zone A Blu.
356;ray player from the U. s so that I can play some great films that are locked on Zone A. Walkabout was the first.
357;With very little dialogue and virtually nothing explained, it was a profound experience of shocking loss, disorientation in a deadly yet beautiful environment, and finding one's way back.
358;Yet it stimulated a great dialogue with my father, who had insisted that I accompany him to it.
359;I am happy to say that she was swept into it in the same way, wondering what it meant and wanting to learn more.
360;The girl, Agutter, is shielding her brother from frightening realities, but it is the young brother who is the real focus of the story.
361;He has sudden flashes of insight, at times far more perceptive than his more conventional sister, though at his age he often must act them out rather than articulate them.
362;She keeps him going, but it is his mind and spirit that keep them together and then achieve some communication with the aborigine man child.
363;hollywood: ironic, muted, and mysterious, as much a feeling as a story.
364;recommended as one of the greatest film experiences I have known.
365;Agutter is luminously beautiful and became a major star from this film.
366;So yes, it is going back to a more innocent world.
367;The film comes across as an extended dream sequence of inter.
368;It is the first film to feature an Australian Aboriginal actor playing an Aboriginal, and shot with wonderful sympathy for the Australian interior.
369;the Criterion edition is up to their usual standard, a perfect reproduction of an intensely visual film accompanied by a number of interesting interviews, discussing the director and Aboriginal actor.
370;Nicolas Roeg's 1971 masterpiece transcends time and place.
371;On one level, it's a harrowing adventure of two abandoned kids in the Australian outback.
372;On another, it's a mystical meditation, a tone poem if you will, about the greater world just beyond our so. called modern civilization.
373;It's also a wonderful coming of age drama, a love story and an exploration of innocence lost .
374;There's a mythic sensibility to this enterprise.
375;beautiful Jenny Agutter was only 16 when production began.
376;His astonishing presence haunts the film .
377;beautifully photographed, this was cinematographer Roeg's directorial debut.
378;His first feature film explores startling primeval locations in which no white person had trespassed.
379;long documentary on the life and career of actor David Gulpilil.
380;There's a booklet with photos featuring an evocative essay by Paul Ryan.
381;This is one of my favorite movies: the panoramas and vistas are extraordinary, the story (to me) is perfectly suited to the cinematography.
382;Jenny Agutter does an excellent job as the naive Aussie girl trying to protect her brother and survive in a very hostile environment.
383;The young Aborigine is the perfect foil to her naivete.
384;I wish it had had at least some subtitles to understand his speech, but I felt his actions spoke beautifully for him.
385;Some friends think it's a bit slow developing, but I found I liked it.
386;The situations are appropriate to the storyline.
387;Roeg showed his talent well with this movie, nearly 40 years ago, and I find it just as interesting today.
388;The previous reviewer wrote: It's a beautiful, strange film.
389;This is the first time I've seen the film.
390;worth a viewing, you'll want to own it.
391;There is a lot of familiarity in the cast.
392;the landscape is stunning and forboding and their is immense and frightning sexual tension between Agutter and the Aboriginee boy who seem to fundementally fear each other and each others strange cultural stances and yet fascination from each about their own emerging sexual energies and attractions to each other.
393;I want my kids to watch this movie (when I have kids).
394;the distinctive visual aspects of this film evolve around the tense collision of progress and of nature against the backdrop of Australia's beautiful outback.
395;The truly stunning way human nature is presented in the midst of nature, however, is the best part of this film
396;For that alone, it's worth it.
397;Second, the director does a wonderful job of taking an average book and turning it into a beautiful movie by using what he discovered while scouting locations and having the eye to understand what would work better with the story, an abandoned mining town, an abandoned farm, an modern urban settings.
398;A beautiful young woman in this film.
399;She commands the screen in a totally understated way.
400;The younger brother (the director's real son) has a real knack for acting too.
401;The cross cutting is wonderful.
402;A beautiful film that leaves you thinking and in love.
403;'Walkabout,' is a film that is so easily reducible to its basic themes.
404;Yet at it's core I think the film is still effective today because it is so enigmatic.
405;A fine achievement with many resonances today.
406;He embodies all that magic of a culture that is ancient, deeply connected and withoutgreed.
407;To see Nicholas Roeg weave a story of two cultures coming together as innocence in the vast landscape of Australiais the most beautiful and haunting story in all of cinema.
408;It is beyond a film.
409;This is an interesting film and one of the more unusual mainstream films I have seen.
410;sexual nudity) It is an overall good film.
411;the original music score by John Barry is superb and sounds very similar to the music he did in the earlier James Bond films.
412;Jenny Agutter is also well known for her role in the film Logan's Run.
413;There is a subtlety in this film that many people miss.
414;Incredibly some give it a single star.
415;This is a vivid, strange, lucid, dream of a film, a dream that takes in the past, present, and future of a world that is losing its soul almost as fast as it's losing its mind.
416;for many this is a favorite film.
417;by Houseman, will bring tears to your eyes if you allow yourself to fully absorb this journey into the Eden that human beings have lost forever.
418;one of the greatest films ever made in the English language.
419;On the surface, a tale of adventure and survival, the film also touches other levels.
420;Shot in the Australian outback over the course of four months, the film features some cinematography that captures the character and unique beauty of the land down under, and provides a glimpse of the native aboriginal lifestyle.
421;They manage to continue with little to eat or drink, and somehow descend to a much lower level with desert terrain.
422;after this transition point, the film then features the aboriginal boy's survival skills, and the actual hunting and killing of animals, such as a kangaroo, snakes, and lizards.
423;The time spent with the white children, is a step in the transition to adulthood for the aboriginal boy, which culminates with his dance seeking the girl's attentions and affections.
424;walkabout is a provocative film that raises questions that are not always answered.
425;It is more of an adventure fantasy, than a realistic tale of survival, because much of what happens just isn't very credible, and is even surreal at times.
426;the marvelous completely natural performances of the three lead actors, plays a huge role in making the film very special.
427;Jenny Agutter (Logan's Run, An American Werewolf In London), on the verge of rising to become one of the finest British actresses of her time, gives a very believable performance as the schoolgirl put in a desperate situation.
428;As a child, six year old Luc Roeg gives a wonderful and charming performance in his only film appearance to date.
429;The bonding between the young boy and the aboriginal teen is kind of overshadowed, but there is some striking imagery when these two are together.
430;Nicholas Roeg struck pure cinematic gold, when he found David Gulpilil (credited as David Gumpilil), for the critical role as the aboriginal boy.
431;Without Gulpilil's performance, one wonders what kind of film Walkabout would have been.
432;The film captures Gulpilil's native skills as well as his innate charm, in a performance that would bring him international acclaim.
433;walkabout story is detailed in a documentary included as an extra feature.
434;another bonus is a commentary track featuring both Nicholas Roeg and Jenny Agutter.
435;ray version is good, but like many films of this age, isn't great.
436;walkabout has a strong visual style, characterized by striking images, the meaning of which at times is subject to interpretation.
437;The girl helps set up the food and the sheet for the picnic while the boy plays around with his toys.
438;The film's imagery is ultimately very personal and so intimate and close in it's depiction of events that it is harrowing to watch.
439;The scenes that take place in homes and in the city and basically everywhere else except the desert are just as intense and abrasive as the scenes in the desert.
440;It's disturbingly ironic sounding, I know, but the film is full of these sorts of images and comparison shots.
441;Both animals are dead and both people are, to one degree or another, cutting the animal for the same reason.
442;The symbolism in this film is constant and very memorable, and yet none of it proves distracting to the plot or the emotions.
443;It's a spectacular idea, and the film works wonderfully.
444;jenny Agutter performed in this film before she was ever in her most well known films such as 'Logan's Run', 'Equus', 'An American Werewolf in London', and 'Child's Play 2', but honestly I think her work here is the best she has ever done.
445;She was only about nineteen or twenty when she acted in this film, and she really was born to play this role.
446;Her presence comes off incredibly strong.
447;She and Luc Roeg have to carry an entire film and both do tremendously.
448;This has been the only film that Nicholas Roeg's son Luc Roeg has appeared in, but he has a lot of charisma which definitely helps make his scenes with the aborigine that more alive and genuine.
449;Their chemistry is simply a sight to behold.
450;The aborigine himself, David Gulpilil, is just as fantastic as everyone else here.
451;His smile is contagious and he does a fantastic job in a role that requires pure emotion and bodily skill and no understandable dialogue.
452;In fact, it's perhaps the best I have ever seen.
453;The film's naturalness flows beautifully, and these performances help lend themselves to the reality so that when the picture turns dark and scary we as the audience feels that.
454;The actions speak all for themselves, and what I appreciated more about this artistic excursion is that the visuals as well as the sound both work in telling the story.
455;It also plays a key role in the plot and the fate of the aborigine that helps lend itself to the emotion of the film and the plot in question.
456;The crew for this film had little to work with despite the budget, and yet they were all able to craft a film that is as epic and as large in scope as any old Hollywood blockbuster.
457;This film works brilliantly, both as an independent film and as a film in itself.
458;The film is a joy to just watch.
459;The music in this film is incredibly chilling and haunting, but it's so beautiful and almost nostalgic sounding in the sense that it's almost comforting in a weird way.
460;there is another Australian film that works in a similar way called 'Picnic at Hanging Rock'.
461;Walkabout, however, is one of the greatest films of all time.
462;It is horrifying, disturbing, emotional, beautiful, honest, entertaining, and ultimately just majestic.
463;It is surreal and it is unusual, but it is also mesmerizing and moving.
464;Walkabout works as a coming.
465;age film, a psychological thriller, a documentary, a tragedy, and it's even an excellent childrens film.
466;Seriously, this film is so freaking brilliant.
467;This is my favorite Nicholas Roeg film along with 'The Man Who Fell to Earth'.
468;'Walkabout' is a masterpiece and there will never be another film like it.
469;a well made drama Walkabout gives the young actress Jenny Agutter (An American Werewolf in London, Logan's Run) a chance to shine as a middle class girl who suddenly finds herself in an alien landscape both beautiful and sinister.
470;age story that results and resulting culture clash/similarities are fascinating to watch in Roeg's film and prefigures what we see in later films such as The Man Who Fell To Earth and even, to some degree, Don't Look Now.
471;the Criterion edition of the film looks quite nice.
472;Colors are quite strong throughout with impressive looking clear blue skies and shots that don't suggest the are of the film.
473;Detail is quite nice as well although keep in mind that the film is over 40 years old.
474;audio is an uncompressed mono track and sounds quite nice.
475;the special features are quite nice
476;If you regard nature as a transcendant realm that clearly trumps the fragmented, modern world, this film will move you.
477;The performance of the little boy is so good in this film, it seems almost impossible that he was acting.
478;The musical score itself is one of the most beautiful I have ever heard.
479;and here is, in one line, my feelings on Walkabout after one viewing:~I cannot wait to go home tonight and watch it again and again to discover the secrets hidden in its layers~This is a movie that will be a pleasure to watch over and over.
480;very much like the eyes of the creatures in the outback.
481;the Boy, in his innocence and joys, doomed to ultimately become Civilized Man.
482;able to see life only thru his aborigine eyes.
483;parallels are drawn between them and chasms separate them as well.
484;beautiful outback cinematography only underscores this exploration of the human heart and the cracks and crevices of the human psyche.
485;budding sexuality covers the film like a sheen.
486;have trees ever seen so erotic and suggestive?On the technical side, this film has beautifully restored color, but could have been fine tuned a little more in the scratches and dust department.
