I:18212;1;`Blood Diamond' is an excellent adventure.
I:18212;2;stopping violence and the tender timeouts are testaments to fine timing and storytelling.
I:18212;3;Archer meets her and finds she can assist him with reuniting Solomon's family.
I:18212;4;It's a complex, yet captivating trade.
I:18212;5;`Blood Diamond' may not always surprise, but it is filled with riveting adventure and harrowing battle scenes.
I:18212;6;Urgent situations, anguishing details, and a connected plot construct a solid movie experience.
I:18212;7;Pointedly, the film is meaningful.
I:18212;8;The movie makes expert connections from the battles to the diamond trade to the jewelry store.
I:18212;9;It also aligns the characters well.
I:18212;10;Sometimes a few coincidences play too neatly into the hand of circumstance, but the exploitation and compelling chase scenes are presented genuinely enough.
I:18212;11;DiCaprio's worthy Oscar nomination and fine supporting performances add to the cohesive story.
I:18212;12;Even some of the cinematography is breathtaking enough to keep from taking the Third World for granted.
I:18212;13;More than `Rambo' for liberals, `Blood Diamond' is a thoughtful and well.
I:18212;14;crafted movie experience with an important story to tell.
I:18212;15;Special features awesome, especially the documentary.
I:18212;16;otherwise, SUPER performances from Di Caprio and Honsou, and the scenery (actually Mozambique) is a character in its own right.
I:18212;17;Gritty, moving, and Di Caprio really is able to show his range and talent (which I think is still underestimated by many just because he started off as a soap star).
I:18212;18;And Vosloo as the villain, perfect.
I:18212;19;Wonderful action adventure film with deeper meaning, plus the power of love.
I:18212;20;I originally thought it was an action movie with Leonardo DiCaprio.
I:18212;21;The movie makes no excuses for the excessive violence since it was and is such a real issue in the world.
I:18212;22;what happens then is an amazing story filled with action and suspense.
I:18212;23;A journey that never stops and can only takes one breath away when they realize this is something that really happened.
I:18212;24;It is a sad story but it is also a happy story.
I:18212;25;ray version which was filled with a beautiful picture and wonderful sound.
I:18212;26;It also had many extra features including a wonderful documentary about the smuggling business.
I:18212;27;ray player I highly recommend this movie.
I:18212;28;this is easily one of the best movies of the year.
I:18212;29;With the lack of great movies this year it's great to have a diamond in the rough.
I:18212;30;A story that is incredibly amazing and true.
I:18212;31;Blood Diamond is a message film.
I:18212;32;mill message films and actually be a good movie.
I:18212;33;ironically, there is a good ninety.
I:18212;34;buried deep inside Blood Diamond.
I:18212;35;dah, this is a message film (TMF)!
I:18212;36;The latter was chilling in its realism of the international politics connected with this genocide and excellent in portrayal of its characters.
I:18212;37;The African father, in particular, should have been portrayed with a great deal more depth.
I:18212;38;The best I can say of it is that there is plenty of action.
I:18212;39;Great educative true life experiences film.
I:18212;40;Gave meaning to my job and the impact getting it right brings along.
I:18212;41;This movie is intense, cinematically beautiful, and exceptionally well acted.
I:18212;42;DiCaprio has been churning out really good performances since his Oscar.
I:18212;43;His performance in Blood Diamond should solidify his status as one of the greatest actors of his generations (and those muscles should make even more women swoon).
I:18212;44;the subject matter of the movie is captivating and heart wrenching.
I:18212;45;And Edward Zwick (The Last Samurai, Glory) does it justice in this film.
I:18212;46;I love this movie because it really makes you wonder why we are willing to do so much for the things we want.
I:18212;47;Blood Diamond is a good movie but on the whole rather mediocre in every aspect.
I:18212;48;The most poignant scenes wonderfully avoid sentimentality but, as a kind of side effect, miss the real pathos too.
I:18212;49;a great deal of the movie consists of violence under the form of shooting people as if they were made for target practice.
I:18212;50;I understand this is an important part of modern Africa which must be told in all its brutality, and in this respect the movie serves its purpose very well, but I think less bloodshed and more substance would have been a better solution.
I:18212;51;Watched the movie several times in the past and it is has a very exciting plot, I highly recommend this movie and can be watched over and over again.
I:18212;52;Excellent subject matter, very good cast.
I:18212;53;An inside look at the diamond business and how it affects the people in this country at any cost.
I:18212;54;Djimon Hounsou intimidatingly genuine in his role as desperate father.
I:18212;55;the movie opens with Solomon Vandy (damn good name, IMO) being kidnapped from his family to work in diamonds run by the Revolutionary United Front.
I:18212;56;now that's new), shooting women and children, and enslaving able.
I:18212;57;You get great shots of bazooka.
I:18212;58;chilling new acronym, TIA, the meaning of which I'll leave it to you to find out.You get an unrealistic half.
I:18212;59;how can the diamond trade be made to bring real development to their source.
I:18212;60;a thriller with a strong human element.
I:18212;61;DiCaprio gives an amazing performance.
I:18212;62;truly one of his best roles I've seen yet.
I:18212;63;i give Blood Diamond 4/5 stars.
I:18212;64;I was looking for a movie similar to Syriana, and this movie is not really up to par with it, but it is still an excellent movie.
I:18212;65;I'm not normally a fan of Leonardo di Caprio, but his acting was truly outstanding.
I:18212;66;It is the ending that cheapens the movie somewhat.
I:18212;67;If you ignore the last five minutes or so this is a compelling movie, which is well worth watching, and might even be educational.
I:18212;68;This is a very good movie for what it is.
I:18212;69;The entire cast does a good job.
I:18212;70;The more I see of Leonardo DiCaprio, the more impressed I am with his acting ability.
I:18212;71;He is who he is and Africa will always be in him.
I:18212;72;Great acting by him (with accent) and his co. lead, Djimon Hounsou.
I:18212;73;I even thought that Jennifer Connelly was good as well.
I:18212;74;The story was delivered very nicely, awareness should be raised through this story.
I:18212;75;An excellent rendition to help people understand the psychology behind all parties involved/effected by the diamond industry and it's ugly secrets.
I:18212;76;I enjoyed this movie and am more glad than ever that im livingin the other part of the world, we dont know how good we have it.
I:18212;77;When he is happy he smiles.
I:18212;78;but he actually portrays the emotions correctly (and I was happy that he remained selfish throughout most of the film).
I:18212;79;His scenes are a powerful testament to the darkness that engulfs this epidemic.
I:18212;80;What a fantastic performance by Leo in this gritty, fast.
I:18212;81;The story is extremely tight and brilliantly written invoking all kinds of emotions within audience members.
I:18212;82;Symbolically this film runs deep with themes of greed, loyalty and compassion.
I:18212;83;I took a lot away from it and it certainly gave a me a whole new perspective on diamond sale and trade.
I:18212;84;Perhaps when considering a gem in the future I will opt for something else.
I:18212;85;I hope they rerelease this picture one day and give it the proper treatment that it deserves.
I:18212;86;Focus Points: Featurettes and Production Diaries.
I:18212;87;It is a very entertaining film, for the fairly straightforward story.
I:18212;88;I thought the acting was excellent.
I:18212;89;made action/drama movie with a stellar cast and meaningful.
I:18212;90;I finally put it on my gift list and got it.
I:18212;91;Money well spent, and deeply moving.
I:18212;92;Overall a good watch, but just a so.
I:18212;93;As important as the topic is, I would like to see the topic getting handled in an important and serious way as well.
I:18212;94;Everyone in the movie does well though.
I:18212;95;Makes you open your eyes to the real problems of the world.
I:18212;96;Great movis and I can watch it over and over again.
I:18212;97;It is also very well done on that level, with Edward Zwick ably handling the pure adrenaline rush of the action.
I:18212;98;i think the sorrow of the film is heightened by the natural beauty of the place, filmed wonderfully.
I:18212;99;Leonardo DeCaprio is very good here.
I:18212;100;Jennifer Connelly always embodies intelligence along with her beauty (and I don't know how she manages to get even better looking as time goes on, but she does).
I:18212;101;a very fast and furious action film with a lot of other things on its mind, I found the film well worthwhile.
I:18212;102;This is one of those movies that opens people's eyes to the truth behind diamonds.
I:18212;103;this movie hits you pretty hard and after it if you think about the world you live in it helps to shatters the world that you might have grown up with and you begin to wonder about those who control diamonds, oil, technology, sugar, coffee, alcohol, and you begin to wonder at how society is controlled today.
I:18212;104;This may be one of my favorite movies ever.
I:18212;105;It certainly runs in the top ten.
I:18212;106;I really enjoyed Leonardo DiCaprio's character and witnessing him develop and enact the character.
I:18212;107;It is exciting, interesting, and innovative.
I:18212;108;I really love this movie!
I:18212;109;Real life events, excellent movie, edge of the seat suspense.
I:18212;110;Not only a story of how actions in rich countries affect the lives of people in poor countries, but a gripping story of relationships between father and son, lovers, and greed versus the value of human life.
I:18212;111;This film gets more indepth the setting across most of Africa during the civil wars that continue to rip the continent apart today.
I:18212;112;Even if you don't like Leonardo Di Caprio you will like this, it's one of the best films I've ever seen.
I:18212;113;It's gripping, relistic and based on a true story.
I:18212;114;It's shocking, informative and intresting all at the same time.
I:18212;115;It's well acted and has a brilliant storyline.
I:18212;116;If you like action well this film should be good.
I:18212;117;the story I found in many parts over the top.
I:18212;118;having said that some of the scenes for example when the rebels took the town, killed, cut peoples hands off and took many into slavery, I thought were good.
I:18212;119;the best film I've seen in two years.
I:18212;120;LD is the actor of our generation.
I:18212;121;He has come a long way since Titanic.
I:18212;122;The press gets a good shake with high moral ground and a beautiful reporter.
I:18212;123;The acting is superior, the cinematography is excellent.
I:18212;124;I've never watched a film that was so captivating and exciting.
I:18212;125;which is a good thing in my book.
I:18212;126;And DiCaprio proved that he really is one of the finest actors of his era.
I:18212;127;Incidentally an enthusiastic 2 will just have to do.
I:18212;128;Not being a very big Leonardo DiCaprio fan in the past, this year I've had a growing amount of respect for this young man as he proves his acting chops again and again.
I:18212;129;First it was within the excellent Scorsese film THE DEPARTED, and now he does another great job in BLOOD DIAMOND.
I:18212;130;Many African actors lend their previously hidden talents to the film, giving it a bit more authenticity than The Departed.
I:18212;131;Djimon plays the smart and tough Solomon as he races to find his family and his son.
I:18212;132;After being imprisoned via slave labor by the rebels, Solomon finds a huge, rare, pink diamond and quickly buries it.
I:18212;133;"He meets up with Solomon and the two form a tenuous bond
I:18212;134;part nonfiction, part fiction, Blood Diamond forces the viewer to realize that the rocks they wear on their fingers may have come at a very bloody cost.
I:18212;135;a very compelling film with DiCaprio dominating the screen (and rightfully so).
I:18212;136;His South African accent was spot.
I:18212;137;One of the more clever lines uttered by Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) when aiming to summarize Sierra Leone's 1999 blood diamond situation to American photojournalist Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly).
I:18212;138;world type of gal (always looking fresh) who wants proof that diamonds are being used to fund the attempted overthrow of the government by the rebel group Revolutionary United Front (RUF).
I:18212;139;vandy finds a clear 100.
I:18212;140;He manages to bury it, but not without the ever watchful eye (bad pun for those who saw the movie) of the Captain lurking nearby.
I:18212;141;"All the stars are actually quite emotive despite their lines
I:18212;142;The cinematography is often stunning, especially the long shots that claim to be Sierra Leone's countryside.
I:18212;143;The action scenes, although overdone at times to the point of trivializing the true bloody story of Sierra Leone's civil war, are captivating.
I:18212;144;It is a good movie to watch.
I:18212;145;I watch Blood Diamond at least three times a year.
I:18212;146;I don't know what it is about this movie but I just love it.
I:18212;147;The acting is superb, the story mesmerizing and it's one of my movie icons.
I:18212;148;This is a very intense, taut drama/action movie that goes at a very rapid pace.
I:18212;149;Good performances by Leonard DiCaprio, Jennifer Connelly, and Dijimon Hounsou.
I:18212;150;It's a movie everyone should watch at one point, it's really eye.
I:18212;151;and I have to say something about DiCaprio's acting of course!
I:18212;152;Blood Diamond is one of the best movies of the last 10 years, if not even longer.
I:18212;153;The story is gripping, gruesome, heroic, heartfelt, and grand.
I:18212;154;Especially Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Hounsou play their characters superbly.
I:18212;155;"DiCaprio as the white African mercenary who wants out of the industry, looks and breathes life into the character with a superb linguistic performance and a ""feel"" that makes you believe that there's a lot more hidden inside him than what one can see, smell and hear."
I:18212;156;Hounsou as the good, caring and at times almost desperate father who wants nothing but to save his family caught in the civil war delivers a powerful and honest performance and has a very strong presence in all the scenes he's in.
I:18212;157;also director Edward Zwick succeeds in making a fast paced, action packed, yet very emotional and hardbreaking story.
I:18212;158;the story is also well written and well thought through, so kudos to Charles Leavitt aswell.
I:18212;159;overall, the movie is great and raises some very valid questions about the exploitation of Africa by the USA and Europe.
I:18212;160;a very good movie indeed.
I:18212;161;Still, it can hold up to a viewing if you get it out of the library for free, as I did.
I:18212;162;I enjoyed this entertaining and informative film.
I:18212;163;The acting was done very well, and the characters were developed enough that you were pulled through the film's grittiest and most violent scenes.
I:18212;164;I hope that people watch this film and takes its message about conflict diamonds to heart.
I:18212;165;My system passed the screening (and always does), but I still had problems once I really got into the film and had to switch to the non.
I:18212;166;This is a good movie, an important message and good acting with exotic scenery,culture, special effects, a little romance, all that a typical movie needs.
I:18212;167;He does a very good Afrikaner accent and attitude.
I:18212;168;there are good moments to the movie, some excellent acting by Hounsou and scenes as powerful as in Apocalypse Now.
I:18212;169;`Blood Diamond' released in '06 is a taut, well executed action/adventure, drama starring two of the best actors in the business today, Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Housnsou.
I:18212;170;Add to the mix the beautiful and talented Jennifer Connelly as journalist Maddy Bowen and you have an enjoyable evening of viewing ahead.
I:18212;171;excellent story, excellent acting, perfect direction, pacing, score, you name it, it was done well.
I:18212;172;an excellent film and a must see.
I:18212;173;Blood Diamond has an amazing and unique story, which is hard to find in movies.
I:18212;174;the movie also has great acting.
I:18212;175;Dicaprio and Hansou were incredible.
I:18212;176;I definitely recommend this movie!
I:18212;177;I can't add much, except that this is a must see movie!The plot is great and captures you right into it right from the second it starts.
I:18212;178;It's such a moving story that I can't even put it into words.
I:18212;179;This movie will keep you on the edge of your chair.
I:18212;180;It is a action movie and much fact finding was written into the script.
I:18212;181;that leo di caprio is a handsome nice guy and i love his movies.
I:18212;182;Very heart warming, intense movie, of course it's old so you can't expect a lot but for an old movie it is a very entertaining movie.
I:18212;183;I have watched this movie several times, and have enjoyed it as much as the first time.
I:18212;184;I could write volumes on each character, but you my friend should see this one, several times.
I:18212;185;As usual Leonardo did a great job.
I:18212;186;What a great movie with terrific actors.
I:18212;187;The topic discussed in the movie blood diamonds is a real occurrence in time and worth watching to get an insight on what it is going on in the world.
I:18212;188;Blood Diamond is another movie which showcases how great an actor DiCaprio is.
I:18212;189;To me it was just a very good story.
I:18212;190;Despite any shortcomings, this movie is worth it just to see DiCaprio and Hounsou .
I:18212;191;both deliver stand out performances that are worth seeing and carry the movie.
I:18212;192;America also dumps millions into this country and year and, well like they said, nothing changes.
I:18212;193;I didn't think I'd like this movie but I really ended up enjoying it.
I:18212;194;It didn't end the way I wanted it to, but the mark of a good movie is not delivering the ending people may want, while still garnering so many positive reviews.
I:18212;195;A good story about the effects of diamond smuggling and outstanding acting by all participants.
I:18212;196;Leonardo DiCaprio, once you get past his accent, is very good in this movie.
I:18212;197;The storyline is interesting and the locations are just beautiful.
I:18212;198;This movie was so real .
I:18212;199;This movie was excellent and I was very pleased.
I:18212;200;Blood Diamond is a brilliant and gripping movie and is by far the best film I have seen this year.
I:18212;201;It's combination of realistic storytelling, spot on acting and all out action scenes is what makes this movie work so well.
I:18212;202;I think he has done a brilliant job bringing this movie to the screen because he has managed to convey both the dramatic aspects of the story and the fanatstic action sequences without it leaning to one side.
I:18212;203;This is what I believe will keep audiences gripped to the end, like it did with me.
I:18212;204;Another aspect that kept me entertained throughout was the chemistry between the two lead characters and the way that DiCaprio's character `Archer', changes over the course of the film.
I:18212;205;overall I think both DiCaprio and Hounsou have done a great job and both deserve oscar's for their performances.
I:18212;206;Jennifer Conelly didn't have such a major role but she was also good in the film.
I:18212;207;But mainly I would have to give credit to the writer and director, whom have manged to bring to the screen an intriguing and gripping movie.
I:18212;208;What it does is effectively tell a compelling human story that's just as touching as it is ugly.
I:18212;209;While digging up part of the riverbed, he finds a sizeable diamond chunk that has a slight pink tinge to it, something so rare and valuable that its sale could prolong the chaos.
I:18212;210;She needs him in order to write a good story.
I:18212;211;"It's refreshing for a film like ""Blood Diamond"" to present them, especially since it can offer a way to learn about something consumers take for granted."
I:18212;212;The three characters also have learning experiences, in one form or another.
I:18212;213;"Archer probably has the greatest one
I:18212;214;While seeing this does little to diminish Archer's desire to possess the hidden diamond, that one moment of love and anguish still leaves an impression, one that enables a better understanding of Solomon's determination.
I:18212;215;I distinctly remember one moment when Dia is blindfolded and handed a machine gun.
I:18212;216;He's then obeys the order to pull the trigger.
I:18212;217;There's a perfect balance at work here, informing the audience with a mixture of disturbing imagery and enlightening moments of compassion and understanding.
I:18212;218;It makes one wonder whether or not they understood the power of their words, especially since they used them to encourage both acts of violence and undeserved loyalty.
I:18212;219;Blood Diamond does a wonderful job of examining this complex belief system, something that for many years was the reality for the people of Sierra Leone.
I:18212;220;"I'm thankful for having seen this film
I:18212;221;opening depiction of a real life crisis, one that a lot people have yet to learn about.
I:18212;222;Leonardo DiCaprio, our best living actor, leads the charge in this strong, but flawed, offering from Edward Zwick.
I:18212;223;Pumping out his second Oscar worthy performance this season DiCaprio tries to turn a $100 million monstrosity from Warner Brothers into a political screed.
I:18212;224;Instead we are left with great storytelling that will entertain its intended middle brow audience so much that they won't even remember the message by the time they leave the theater.
I:18212;225;Manohla Dargis made the clever point that DiCaprio's heartthrob status will get younger females, or the people that need to see this movie the most, into the theater.
I:18212;226;The point is right on, however, as the American people are called out for their sick obsession over that while people in Sierra Leone are dying to feed their vanity.
I:18212;227;That's us Americans, steadfastly believing that a few limbs is a small price to pay to make a rich princess feel a little bit more beautiful.
I:18212;228;Maddy comes off as idealistic next to the hardened Danny, but she has that luxury, and so do we.
I:18212;229;throughout the film I was thoroughly entertained.
I:18212;230;But the reason behind it is pure and you can't expect a housewife to give up her love of diamonds AND children in one night.
I:18212;231;So despite its problems I am recommending this film, as an act of bravery on Warner Brothers part, as an act of genius on DiCaprio's part, and as an act of great storytelling on Zwick's part.
I:18212;232;There is a very emotional story between a father and his family and the quest to bring his son home after the boy is kidnapped by the RUF rebels and turned into a killer.
I:18212;233;This backstory behind the history brings a dose of realism to the characters that we can sink an attachment into.
I:18212;234;Leo DiCaprio does a masterful job with the dialect and acting, along with Djimon Hounsou and Jennifer Connelly.
I:18212;235;This is a splendid screenplay that's well balanced, entertaining and at the same time complex in its description of just one of the many long struggles in Africa.
I:18212;236;Blood Diamond is indeed a great story, very good performances with a fabulous ending, definitely 5 stars, a must have in your movie collections!
I:18212;237;To start off let me go ahead and say that Blood Diamond is a excellent film and a must.
I:18212;238;This was all around a great movie, the best of 2006 if you ask me.
I:18212;239;The movie is overall very powerful, well casted, directed, written, and filmed.
I:18212;240;"Bottom line is if you liked ""Hotel Rwanda"" than you will like this."
I:18212;241;It did me good to become more aware of going on in Africa and the suffering of those people.
I:18212;242;"Leo is awesome
I:18212;243;Just notmy type of entertainment.
I:18212;244;This is a great movie, I've seen it several times already, and each time, I learn something new.
I:18212;245;Worth 2.5 hours of your time to see what it was like in Sierra Leone during the war.
I:18212;246;paired up with great acting, and action!
I:18212;247;Blood Diamond is a true story of how material objects, greed, and selfishness can get in the way of doing the right thing, having compassion and empathy.
I:18212;248;Leonardo is very good and conviencing as a self.
I:18212;249;centered, greedy guy with a conscience and a good heart.
I:18212;250;But is it strong enough to make him do the right thing?
I:18212;251;The other actors in this movie are believable as well in what their mission is and how they feel about the diamond trade business in African and killing for it.
I:18212;252;It's the kind of movie that really gets you involved with what is happening to the characters and after the movie is over it sticks with you.
I:18212;253;in your mind and heart.
I:18212;254;drama, action, truth, and good acting and cinematography.
I:18212;255;The acting in this movie is magnificent, the story is compelling, entertaining, and breath catching.
I:18212;256;This movie is a very good drama about the illegal african diamond trading and it's effects on local economies and goverments.
I:18212;257;"The movie does a great job at showing the harsh and tough to face details of what may be occuring in the ""conflict countries"" such as Sierra Lion."
I:18212;258;this is an action packed film with some nice twists, and overall eye opening drama to what is occuring even today.
I:18212;259;And though he sets off to find Solomon's diamond, we also see whether he can unearth his humanity along the way.
I:18212;260;Leo adds an amazing muscular menace and aged world.
I:18212;261;driven drama (Glory, Courage Under Fire, The Last Samurai to name a few).
I:18212;262;"With ""Blood Diamond,"" he most successfully negotiates the territory between conventional action movie entertainment and more political, emotional, and darker material."
I:18212;263;such a gorgeous land frames such unspeakably evil acts, which ultimately adds greater weight to the messages of the film.
I:18212;264;is just one theme among many in this nuanced and layered work.
I:18212;265;The film also manages to effortlessly examine other issues, such as: what is truly more valuable, material possessions or human empathy?
I:18212;266;Great awareness and a reminder to what goes on in the world.
I:18212;267;But, also, a great story.
I:18212;268;Director Edward Zwick in his perturbing portrayal of a 1999 civil war in Sierra Leone gives overdue exposure to both the problems of the recruitment of child soldiers and the procurement of conflict based diamonds.
I:18212;269;While incarcerated he gets wind of the discovery of a rare massive pink hued diamond by African fisherman Solomon Vanty played superbly by Djimon Hounsou.
I:18212;270;This was a good movie, however I personally found all the graphic violenceto be over the top and definitely excessive.
I:18212;271;The story itself was goodand interesting, acting wonderful.
I:18212;272;This is a very powerful movie that wears its political views on its sleeve.
I:18212;273;They simply did it and it worked.
I:18212;274;He has lived by his wits and his ability to fight.
I:18212;275;the other important story is about the aforementioned Solomon Vandy (powerfully portrayed by Djimon Hounsou) who is a simple fisherman with a wonderful family that has largely avoided the troubles.
I:18212;276;Solomon is actually fortunate to become enslaved working at finding diamonds for the RUF gang.
I:18212;277;And it is that stone that brings all the elements of the rest of the story together.
I:18212;278;the love interest, such as it is, is supplied by the danger seeking and passionate Maddy Bowen (played just right by Jennifer Connelly).
I:18212;279;She is there to find out the story and helps us understand the whole blood diamond trade as well as tease out the background story of Danny Archer.
I:18212;280;The product is good, the film itself is magnificent.
I:18212;281;My two brothers and I shared this video and wore it out.
I:18212;282;i enjoyed movie, actors were very good.
I:18212;283;Being from Africa, I did enjoy watching this and you do get the raw danger of the continet when watching it.
I:18212;284;This is one of my favorite films with Leonardo.
I:18212;285;This show is a must see.
I:18212;286;The situation involving the diamonds is a real life concern and I think this show, even though hollywood, does a beautiful job expressing it.
I:18212;287;Decaprio played the part well and Jennifer Connelly had a movie she actually had to act in.
I:18212;288;One of the best movies ever made.
I:18212;289;The acting was terrific all around and the pacing was good.
I:18212;290;Overall.4 out of 5 stars, deserving of acclaim, and one of the more memorable films of the last year.
I:18212;291;A mercenary helps a refugee to meet up with his family in exchange for a very rare pink diamond.
I:18212;292;OK, DiCaprio was VERY good in this.
I:18212;293;the first half of the film is well paced and delves into many issues.
I:18212;294;in the hands of a more skilled team the film may have focused exclusively on DiCaprio's and Hounsou's characters as they are the most compelling but we are not that lucky.
I:18212;295;but one of the best films of the year??
I:18212;296;excellent movie, in every sense . . . can't believe i waited this long to see this movie . . . this is what movies should be.
I:18212;297;Blood Diamond has some of the finest performances I have seen.
I:18212;298;Probably the overwhelming number of films that I have seen will have a scene that stretches the truth, something less than credible that makes the story exciting but is beyond the realm of certainty.
I:18212;299;Blood Diamond, on the other hand, comes over like a piece of good journalism and you feel as if you are watching events as they unfolded.
I:18212;300;the story of the film has been nicely summarized by other reviewers.
I:18212;301;The sympathetic choice is Solomon because he not only found the stone (made a slave by the rebels and forced to pan for diamonds) but he would make a better life for his impoverished family.
I:18212;302;director Edward Zwick (who also directed Glory and The Last Samurai) has produced another masterpiece of story telling.
I:18212;303;The final scene is unforgettable as Solomon (the best performance I have seen Djimon Hounsou give), now reunited with his family in London, is about to tell his story before a commission investigating the diamond trade.
I:18212;304;"About the most honest was the gripping ""Hotel Rwanda"" with a superb Don Cheadle as a protagonist."
I:18212;305;Director Edward Zwick here has managed what other filmmakers couldn't do.
I:18212;306;He has fashioned a thrilling action film without compromising the polemics of the dire situation of some Africans.
I:18212;307;It helps that this film sports a cast that includes the most dynamic actors of this generation, Leonardo DiCaprio, Djimon Hounsou, and Jennifer Connelly.
I:18212;308;There is an urgency to this film where the makers demand that attention be paid to the people who have suffered for so long but it is done in a subtle way.
I:18212;309;sermon, and the sermon is better than the story.
I:18212;310;In terms of length, most of the film consists of the story of a young soldier of fortune turned diamond smuggler, but the basic moral has been enunciated so clearly at the start that nothing in the tale of Danny Solomon and Maddy can be understood as independent of it, and that is all to the good.
I:18212;311;story is stitched on to the basic backdrop, and in some ways it is a good one.
I:18212;312;One touch that I welcomed near the end was the brief cameo part for Michael Sheen doing his Tony Blair voice as a diamond dealer, and I wonder which film came first, this one or The Queen.
I:18212;313;The blood diamond trade flourishes in not only Sierra Leone but in Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo as well.
I:18212;314;leonardo DiCaprio's fine performance and Djimon Hounsou's breakthrough role as the fisherman forced into slavery in the mine make the film worth seeing even without the message.
I:18212;315;Kagiso Kuypers also did a great turn on the screen as Hounsou's son, Dia, who is kidnapped by the RUF at the beginning of the film.
I:18212;316;That particular subplot could have made a fine movie on its own.
I:18212;317;In one gripping scene, she gives him her phone number.
I:18212;318;She doesn't approve of diamond sales, but she loves the smell of napalm in the morning.
I:18212;319;Blood Diamond is a mixture of action, drama and a realistic portrayal of how one man can make a difference while staring into the face of true evil.
I:18212;320;Although this movie is definitely not for children it has a strong appeal for both men and women.
I:18212;321;It is a thought provoking movie that is charachter driven.
I:18212;322;Blood Diamond is one of the most thrilling, suspenseful, action packed and thought provoking movies I've seen in a long time.
I:18212;323;Leonardo DiCaprio gives the performance of a life time with Djimon Hounsou bringing to life his character with powerful dramatic execution.
I:18212;324;this movie is a must see!
I:18212;325;"Great movie but, hard to watch
I:18212;326;Director's Commentary is the best I've seen.
I:18212;327;"realistic offering coincided with a ""60 Minutes"" report on conflict diamonds in Africa."
I:18212;328;nominee Djimon Hounsu, still as much the beautiful bit of dark hot chocolate that he was when he appeared in a Janet Jackson video a decade earlier), a family man who is proud of his son, Dia's ( Kagiso Kuypers) scholastic efforts and hopes the boy will be a doctor.
I:18212;329;tanned intense, and Oscar nominated Leonardo Di Caprio, who has the Afrikaans accent down pat) who is hoping to find a diamond to sell in order to leave Africa.
I:18212;330;blue eyes, and intensely colored mouth.
I:18212;331;There is a calmer moment where a father expresses his hopes for his son, and Hounsu, like DiCaprio, rewards the viewer with the brilliance of his smile.
I:18212;332;an orphaned adventurer encountering a rare diamond, facing calamity, sacrificing himself for the greater good, and expressing gratitude for meeting a prospective love interest before finding a permanent sense of peace.
I:18212;333;Stephen Collins' Ambassador Walker helps bring this story to its conclusion.
I:18212;334;this formidable film brought further international attention to a timely issue, and was the perfect vehicle for both the Beninese Hounsu and a humanitarian of DiCaprio's caliber to lend their talents.
I:18212;335;You will love to watch it.
I:18212;336;This is the best movie I have seen in years.
I:18212;337;I am not a Leo DeCaprio fan, but he was great in this.
I:18212;338;"This is the best film I have seen since I saw ""Constant Gardener""."
I:18212;339;Djimon Hounsou was excellent in this film also.
I:18212;340;He delivers a strong performance in this topical drama and deserved an nomination for Best Actor as well.
I:18212;341;Dijmon Hounsou is also superb in this and I believe he was also nominated.
I:18212;342;Movie making is a for profit business.
I:18212;343;"The movie industry is however a powerful median
I:18212;344;Blood Diamond was a gripping, exciting, emotional and engrossing movie from start to finish.
I:18212;345;Djimon Hounsou turns in a passionate performance as distraught father and forced laborer, Solomon Vandy and Leonardo DiCaprio delivers an interesting performance as military trained, ex.
I:18212;346;In the end, 'Blood Diamond' delivers as a candid but entertaining story about yet another one of Africa's ugly little inhumane secrets.
I:18212;347;Thank you for a timely and good product and packaged in an appropriate manner.
I:18212;348;This is an enjoyable movie and is worth seeing.
I:18212;349;I would readily recommend this movie to anyone.
I:18212;350;leonardo Di Caprio gives a very strong performance, indeed, as Danny, a former Rhodesian soldier now working as a mercenary, and for himself in smuggling diamonds.
I:18212;351;di Caprio comes of age in this role and is superb as the cynical Danny and manages a quite convincing Rhodesian accent.
I:18212;352;as a film, Blood Diamond works very well as an adventure film.
I:18212;353;a powerful and exciting watch which also imparts a very serious message to the viewer .
I:18212;354;When a filmmaker has completely and unequivocally drawn in his viewer.
I:18212;355;then cinema magic has been captured in a can.
I:18212;356;innovative Edward Zwick: His astonishing, gasping scenes had me flinching and weaving and jumping so much the springs in my recliner are creaking.
I:18212;357;as the lead (a former mercenary turned diamond smuggler with a heart of gold), Leonardo DiCaprio continues to surprise.
I:18212;358;"For the longest time he was an annoying scarecrow
I:18212;359;I really enjoyed his Rhodesian accent (or whatever they're calling Rhodesia these days).
I:18212;360;screen tension between herself and Leo is fun to watch.
I:18212;361;In fact, BLOOD DIAMOND, even if all the chaos and blood lust is a tad over the top, is fun to watch.
I:18212;362;And if not fun, riveting works just fine.
I:18212;363;Very well done and captivating.
I:18212;364;It was also neat to see the scenery of the area.
I:18212;365;I like to watch videos like this because it helps me understand what those people have been and are still going through.
I:18212;366;If I can see a movie more than once,it's pretty good.
I:18212;367;If I can see it every time it passes through the cable box then it's very good.
I:18212;368;The Bourne Identity is very good.
I:18212;369;Zwick knows how to direct and the actions scenes hold your attention, De Caprio plays his part well and Djimon Hounsou (Gladiator) offers the audience a role that is reasonably believable.
I:18212;370;it shows some of the truth on this topic.
I:18212;371;leo is a great actor in everything he does.
I:18212;372;This is an awesome movie with very strong performances from DiCaprio and Djimon Hounsou.
I:18212;373;this film acuratly portrays the diamond trades and brings home many real situations, dreams and nightmares.
I:18212;374;the viewer may see this film as a good and intense Drama which serves as a vehichle for DiCaprio and Hounsou.
I:18212;375;"but in fact its a very bright and realistic view of the ""haves and the have."
I:18212;376;Zwick has done an immense service to the world by creating this work .
I:18212;377;and DiCaprio and Hounsou for lending their names and talent.
I:18212;378;And though the film concludes with a message to the viewer about demanding conflict.
I:18212;379;and, for that alone, this film is an epic success.
I:18212;380;"Suggested viewing: The History Channel's ""Blood Diamonds."""
I:18212;381;the cast of BD was excellent.
I:18212;382;She has gone from being a young pretty face to being a very accomplished actress (and she's still a pretty face!)
I:18212;383;Djimon Hounsou has a very powerful screen presence (and not just because he is buffed up!)
I:18212;384;As was the case in GLADIATOR and AMISTAD, he is able to convey a lot of emotion through very few words.
I:18212;385;In any case, it is truly a poignant film.
I:18212;386;This was a very good movie.
I:18212;387;He offers the guy who mined the diamond a way to find his family.
I:18212;388;In the process, though, he decides to develop a conscious and turns into a likeable character.
I:18212;389;He ends up helping people because of their family bonds and does the right thing.
I:18212;390;Inspired by true evens within the diamond trade in Africa.
I:18212;391;this movie is so gripping and the acting is superb.
I:18212;392;Djimon Hounsou, who has an impressive life story himself, offers an intense performance of Solomon Vandy, a man separated from his family when the RUF (Revolutionary United Front) invades his village in Sierra Leone, killing women and children, and taking many young boys captive to serve as RUF soldiers (which has actually happened.
I:18212;393;Moments later he is captured and jailed by the government forces along with many RUF soldiers.
I:18212;394;leonardo DiCaprio does great job as Danny Archer, a former mercenary from Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) who served in the 32 Battalion of the South African Defence Force.
I:18212;395;vandy at first resists, but realizing that Archer may be his best chance at seeing his family, and getting his son back, agrees to take him to the diamond.
I:18212;396;archer also contacts Bowen, with whom he had developed some romantic interest, and asks her to do one final favor for him.
I:18212;397;Great cinematography, great effects, and great acting, especially by Hounsou, who began his acting career on episodes of Beverly Hills 90210, and went on to appear in films like Amistad, Deep Rising, Gladiator, and many others, more recently Constantine and Eragon.
I:18212;398;He was right for this roll.
I:18212;399;A great performance, and I have to give him credit for the accents he had to learn in order to play his part.
I:18212;400;blood Diamond, while dramatically entertaining and full of action, is also an eye.
I:18212;401;I had my doubts about this movie since I'm not a Leonardo DiCaprio fan, but this is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.
I:18212;402;Great story and awesome action sequences.
I:18212;403;This is one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time.
I:18212;404;It will keep you guessing to the very end, and you may even inadvertently learn something!
I:18212;405;(but not to worry, not at the cost of action, drama, or effects)The extras on the bonus disk are well done, informative, and worth the extra cost, in my opinion.
I:18212;406;The documentary about real Blood diamonds was a particularly nice touch, since it addresses many of the questions that watching the movie may bring up.
I:18212;407;As always, it would have been nice to see more outtakes, and discussions with the actors, but overall it was very satisfying.
I:18212;408;Blood Diamond's is a wonderful movie about the ugly side of GREED and control over the supply and demand for Diamond's.
I:18212;409;This is a terrific action drama with an excellent, almost documentary story.
I:18212;410;I love dramas with some historical significance, especially when the script and acting are especially good.
I:18212;411;DiCaprio and Hounsou are both marvelous actors, and they both shine in this movie.
I:18212;412;Very glad I bought it and will watch it many times.
I:18212;413;DiCaprio is quite good in it.
I:18212;414;the real hero of the story is the gentle fisherman Solomon, masterfully played by Djimon Hounsou.
I:18212;415;He puts his family above everything and is willing to risk his life to get them back after they have been taken from him.
I:18212;416;In Solomon's world view, family is what life is all about.
I:18212;417;Solomon's commitment to his family begins to transform the smuggler, as well as the Danny's love for the beautiful American journalist (Jennifer Connelly.)
I:18212;418;Love, as well as admiration for her dedication to human rights, inspires Danny to self.
I:18212;419;the most disturbing aspect of the film is the kidnapping and brainwashing of children to be used as soldiers.
I:18212;420;Once again, we see revolutionaries taking children away from their families and indoctrinating them.
I:18212;421;It is interesting how drugs and rock music played a significant part in the process.
I:18212;422;This is a great movie!
I:18212;423;The director uses all facts in the 2 years of filming for this movie.
I:18212;424;The action is filmed greatly!
I:18212;425;Even if this movie proves not to be very successful in sales, I believe this will be a successful turning point for DiCaprio.
I:18212;426;This is an oscar performance pure and simple.
I:18212;427;but I definitely will be more enthusiastic about viewing one of his future movies.
I:18212;428;I highly recommend this film, not only because of him .
I:18212;429;It is well written, directed, and acted by all.
I:18212;430;Probably the best movie I've seen in a long time.
I:18212;431;Great movie and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to see what the diamond trade really has happening.
I:18212;432;win deal between the African people and myself.
I:18212;433;While the diamond that is the center of attention in the story is priced at two million Dollars and a safe return of a family, that DiCaprio and Jennifer Connelly never kiss is priceless.
I:18212;434;Actors DiCaprio and Hounson do a superb job with their roles.
I:18212;435;Africa by right, belongs to Africans.
I:18212;436;the speech made by a politician at the end summed it up well.
I:18212;437;see, but for Adults Only.
I:18212;438;Excellent acting, excellent storyline, and excellent execution.
I:18212;439;The entire movie, cast and directing are sublime.
I:18212;440;There's action, drama, and thrills.
I:18212;441;I am very proud of Mr. DiCaprio.
I:18212;442;He is amassing quite and impressive body of work both artistically and politically.
I:18212;443;He appears to be picking his movies and parts carefully.
I:18212;444;Blood Diamond is one of those movies that hopefully will make you think and reconsider your purchasing habits and how something so simple can affect other people (especially children) half way around the world.
I:18212;445;this movie is serious and worth seeing.
I:18212;446;This movie is one of the best.
I:18212;447;I think it was very well done and the actings are so great.
I:18212;448;"I saw the movie in theater and fell in love with the movie 
I:18212;449;The movie blood diamond was a good movie.
I:18212;450;this one xafrican found a big diamond and kept it and buried it.
I:18212;451;Great story and great movie.
I:18212;452;to bad the download stream wasn't as good but the movie was great to watch again.
I:18212;453;The characters were believable and the actors playing them worked well together in this.
I:18212;454;I thought this was an incredibly entertaining movie, and I was impressed that they were willing to expose the diamond industry for what it is.
I:18212;455;"This is the best movie of its kind that I've seen since ""The Constant Gardener."""
I:18212;456;"drama will keep you on your edge of your seat, as well as the heartwrenching story of children ripped from families and forced to become soldiers, innocent people maimed and killed in the name of ""revolution"" and of course the infuriating unconcern of those whose only goal is for profit."
I:18212;457;And capturing and converting children into fresh recruits for the rebel armies is another theme.
I:18212;458;Besides the heavy stuff it's a heart rendering story set in a unique background told by actors who are at the top of their game.
I:18212;459;good movie well written good acting, if this is what happens because of the diamond trade it needs to stop
I:18212;460;I figured that it must be a good movie.
I:18212;461;Well, I can understand the nominations as it was very well done in a variety of ways.
I:18212;462;the acting was quite good.
I:18212;463;The cinema was excellent and it was very interesting to see this part of Africa, except for the extreme ongoing violence.
I:18212;464;When I see a good movie, I sometimes mull over it for the next few days.
I:18212;465;Dicaprio's character is well developed.
I:18212;466;leonardo DiCaprio is brilliant as a Rhodesian mercenary caught up in the diamond trade that kept the rebels armed and fighting, with the connivance of the international diamond industry.
I:18212;467;great movie, and fantastic Dicaprio, worth an Oscar that he didn't get.
I:18212;468;Action packed, sensible and just an overall good, good movie which follows the path to how blood diamonds are mined and distributed.
I:18212;469;Blood Diamond will inspire and challenge you.
I:18212;470;the movie belongs to Leonardo DiCaprio.
I:18212;471;It is 1990, and we are dropped into the strife of civil war and anarchy in Sierra Leone, West Africa.
I:18212;472;Many of the events depicted in this film were historically accurate.
I:18212;473;as many of his previous films are testament to.
I:18212;474;"In BLOOD DIAMOND, there is a tremendous sense of place, of being there in Africa
I:18212;475;The stunning cinematography was done by Eduardo Serra, and his images shifted from sun.
I:18212;476;always ready to share a vista or come in close on a character's face.
I:18212;477;leonardo DiCaprio has made some kind of artistic breakthrough, some powerful transition in this last year.
I:18212;478;He emerges as a powerhouse.
I:18212;479;"He has been on the ""A"" list for a decade, and finally he deserves it."
I:18212;480;His Danny Archer is sporting several pounds of muscle and an authentic.
I:18212;481;His soldier of fortune who happens to be a smuggler is painted in tiny strokes of brilliance.
I:18212;482;By the end of the film we care a lot about him.
I:18212;483;If Archer was the intellect of the film, and the cunning, Vandy was its beating heart.
I:18212;484;He is nominated for an Oscar, and he deserves it.
I:18212;485;the rest of the cast is excellent as well.
I:18212;486;Arnold Vosloo, always great, was cryptic and ruthless as Colonel Boetzee.
I:18212;487;leonardo di Caprio shows a great performance : completely mutated into afrikaner with attitude, accent, .)
I:18212;488;Edward Zwick delivers the goods with BLOOD DIAMOND, a tense and very compelling film about the greed and bloodshed that surround the diamond industry of Sierra Leone.
I:18212;489;Though a bit too long at two and a half hours the story is not only a dramatically viable one for a film, but it also has much to say about human interaction and the sanctity of friendship.
I:18212;490;the performances by DiCaprio, Hounsou, and Connelly are superb but there are also fine performances in the smaller roles filled with such actors as Michael Sheen, Kagiso Kuypers, Benu Mabhena, Jimi Mistry, and Stephen Collins.
I:18212;491;The cinematography by Eduardo Serra manages to capture the beauty of the country as well as the horror of the battles.
I:18212;492;But in the end it is Zwick (The Last Samurai, Courage Under Fire, Legends of the Fall, Leaving Normal, Glory, etc) who transforms the screenplay by Charles Leavitt and C. Gaby Mitchell into an intelligent and engrossing film.
I:18212;493;This is another good film that Dicaprio stars in but has a great supporting cast as well.
I:18212;494;You definitely are captivated by the drama that unfolds.
I:18212;495;Blood DiamondBlood Diamond is about a man who is captured by rebels in Sierra Leone, on the West coast of Africa, and is made a slave panning for diamonds.
I:18212;496;Having spent time in Africa in various places and even met the guys from EO I have to say, this movie is great!
I:18212;497;"Especially DiCaprio made an excellent performance and must have had an excellent language coach for the African dialect (South Afrikan dialect as well as Afrenglish of West Africa)
I:18212;498;Thanks Amazon for giving us the opportunities to watch the gourmet movies.
I:18212;499;Wish Leo won an Oscar for his role.
I:18212;500;I really loved Djimon's role as well.
I:18212;501;A lot of people have praised Di Caprio on his performance and some have has gone as far as saying this is his best performance, if not best film.
I:18212;502;My friend loved this movie but I just didn't feel it.
I:18212;503;There were many action scenes that involved thrill in chase, capture, imprisonment, punishment, labor and death.
I:18212;504;Blood Diamond is a good film but it's just that.
I:18212;505;I liked the end of the film.
I:18212;506;my favourite scene in the film involved Solomon winning an applause.
I:18212;507;Cynical as I am, I thought Djimon Hounsou acted very well.
I:18212;508;"Others have already written about the pros / cons of this movie
I:18212;509;Great storyline without any un.
I:18212;510;real romantic makes you believe this is what happens.
I:18212;511;characters are so real like watching documentary films.
I:18212;512;I absolutely love this movie and it battles a topic that is not talked about much, and that is the diamond trade in Africa where people get killed and maimed over these diamonds (hence the term blood diamond).
I:18212;513;This movie is fairly accurate in its portrayl of Africa and it will bring you to tears.
I:18212;514;It's an emotionally moving film that everyone must see.
I:18212;515;Blood Diamond is some of Leo's finest work.
I:18212;516;It's amazing he still hasn't won an Oscar.
I:18212;517;He dissolves into the character of Danny Archer.
I:18212;518;The Afrikaans accent he adopts in the movie is spot on.
I:18212;519;Djimon Hounsou is exceptional has Leo's rival.
I:18212;520;Great movie with a powerful message.
I:18212;521;I really love this movie.
I:18212;522;I'm South AFrican and I think Leonarda Di Caprio does a stellar job in his role and I enjoyed the whole story.
I:18212;523;The movie is certainly worth seeing.
I:18212;524;DiCaprio gives his best performance to date.
I:18212;525;The outrageously beautiful African countryside is in sharp contrast to the unending bloody slaughter that takes place in Sierra Leone as families are either destroyed or left in abject poverty.
I:18212;526;although the plot is predictable, the film is ultimately saved by the fine acting.
I:18212;527;In addition to the performance of DiCaprio, Jennifer Connelly as Maddy Bowen, the journalist who makes a difference in Archer's life, is outstanding.
I:18212;528;"first at all, it's a courageous film, that, following similar traces in the same pattern of ""The constant gardener"" has decided to deal with this delicate and compromising issue about which everybody talks in silent voice."
I:18212;529;"And the smart script involves the lives of four people, united randomly
I:18212;530;there's a lot of action, but also many moments to make us to reflect around this theme.
I:18212;531;towering acting of all the cast and fluid direction of this talented director.
I:18212;532;you will see a lot more about the wars going on in Africa and the exploitation and brainwashing of young African boys to fight for a cause they know nothing about
I:18212;533;An excellent film for three quarters of the time but the trite ending, where the bad guys get their comeuppance and the scrappy girl journalist triumphs, spoiled what was originally a very realistic film.
I:18212;534;As one who was in Rhodesia during its troubles I can attest the Di Caprio's accent is spot on and the treatment of a country in the throes of a civil war was excellent.
I:18212;535;Leonardo Dicaprio and Djimon Hounsou give outstanding performances in this very emotionally charged movie.
I:18212;536;This movie brings light to the taboo subject of modern day slavery.
I:18212;537;The movie is a real eye opener.
I:18212;538;Blood Diamond is very much aware that these are problems beyond an easy resolution, and making a film that understands that is quite an accomplishment.
I:18212;539;it really is a good movie, well acted, with Africa playing a wonderful supporting role!
I:18212;540;I recommend this movie to everyone!
I:18212;541;Great movie if you have never seen it.
I:18212;542;Overall i was very pleased.
I:18212;543;The problem of our world today is that people are being used and things are being lovedThe Quote mentioned above is a perfect motto/message for what this movie stands for.
I:18212;544;Big Companies, Establishments, Business men etc .
I:18212;545;All have set up an eye to get the best of Diamonds in order to sell it for the rich and willing therefore making themselves one of the richest people in the world.
I:18212;546;this movie is Emotional and really gripping.
I:18212;547;the Acting was superb also.
I:18212;548;You got amazing performances from the lead actors.
I:18212;549;Its really easy to see why Leonardo DiCaprio has gotten an Oscar nomination for this role, I thought it was well.
I:18212;550;i really enjoyed this movie.
I:18212;551;So believe the reviews they are true and not Overrated.
I:18212;552;another Similar Movies I recommend :The Last King of Scotland (Widescreen Edition)
I:18212;553;Just an overall great flick.
I:18212;554;He learned the trade from Scorsese and The Departed.
I:18212;555;Now he pushes it into some thickening and intensity in this film.
I:18212;556;He knows how to use his facial expressivity to mean cynicism, hatred, violence, meanness, viciousness, cruelty, etc. though not yet the rising physical desire that may accept to condescend to turn into something more intense, even passionate.
I:18212;557;So Leonardo Di Caprio is coming of age and may have found a completely new field of artistic expression.
I:18212;558;The film is poignant because of the presence of several artists, the main black actor of course but also Emmanuel Jal and his music, who were children soldiers themselves.
I:18212;559;It is good Hollywood gets aboard the train to humanistic globalization.
I:18212;560;This is a true eye opener for me.
I:18212;561;It is astounding and real.
I:18212;562;The acting is phenomenal and the story is action packed.
I:18212;563;I would recommend this movie highly to everyone.
I:18212;564;Although I haven't ever really cared for DiCaprio's acting, all of the other acting was very good in my opinion and I thoroughly enjoy a relative (African) happy ending.
I:18212;565;Both lead actors are great!
I:18212;566;DiCaprio, often known as a pretty boy, has done some surprisingly gritty and intense movies (The Departed springs immediately to mind).
I:18212;567;Powerful acting and well developed characters make it very enjoyable.
I:18212;568;Recommended for any Leo fans and a decent watch all in all, just not the best.
I:18212;569;I'm a huge DiCaprio fan because I really think he is one of the best actors around.
I:18212;570;This movie really displays his talents.
I:18212;571;The story is also very good.
I:18212;572;This is should definitely be a must watch movie.
I:18212;573;Blood Diamond is a terrific bit of genre entertainment from Edward Zwick, the director of Glory, The Siege, and the somewhat laughable Tom Cruise vehicle The Last Samurai.
I:18212;574;Blood Diamond is considerably more poignant and moving than your average action thriller, however, and this is mostly due to Leonardo DeCaprio giving his first grown.
I:18212;575;deCaprio was shaping up to be one of the most exciting actors since the young Robert DeNiro.
I:18212;576;(The exception was Spielberg's Catch Me If You Can, in which DeCaprio's guilelessness and elfin features.
I:18212;577;For Blood Diamond, DeCaprio assumes a thick, rather endearing South African accent and gives an impressive performance of contained intensity and depth.
I:18212;578;All of a sudden his acting is full of surprises.
I:18212;579;of small, almost throwaway touches, the kind of moments that create a fully formed, deeply affecting character.
I:18212;580;so formidable in those early roles.
I:18212;581;"so political thriller
I:18212;582;Later, she is more contained, and has some affecting moments.
I:18212;583;She does the best she can with this earnest, two.
I:18212;584;dimensional role, that of the dedicated journalist/free spirit torn between conscience and ambition.
I:18212;585;the main role really belongs to Djimon Hounsou as the noble black man trying to find his family, and Hounsou's Solomon is a powerful presence, the heart of the film.
I:18212;586;As an actor, he's the ideal complementary presence for DeCaprio's edgy, ruthless egotism, and together they make the most unlikely (and touching) of friendships.
I:18212;587;But it's an exemplary model.
I:18212;588;I may be alone here, but this is really one of the best films of 2006.
I:18212;589;Loads of action, bits of melodrama, and amazing performances from Djimon Hounsou as Solomon Vandy and especially Leonardo DiCaprio as smuggler Danny Archer.
I:18212;590;in spite of its faults, Blood Diamond is powerful and unforgettable, a movie to watch again and again for its pulse.
I:18212;591;pounding action, unbelievably talented performances, and important look at a more recent dark part of African history.
I:18212;592;knuckled a watch as a James Bond film.
I:18212;593;"Hounsou does the best among the leads with his underwritten character
I:18212;594;One of the best films I have seen in a very long time.
I:18212;595;A film that will stay with me .
I:18212;596;its images, its message, everything.
I:18212;597;Leonardo DiCaprio impresses me each time more and more .
I:18212;598;he was always good from the beginning but now he's got the depth and maturity to go along with his raw talent.
I:18212;599;I give this film my highest recommendation and hope a lot of people will see it .
I:18212;600;it deserves to be seen.
I:18212;601;Fast action, great acting, good story kept me rivited to the screen.
I:18212;602;violence is a part of the story, but it is done extremely well and opened my eyes to a part of the world that I knew little about.
I:18212;603;"Perhaps that is the point of ""Blood Diamond,"" which tells the story of one Sierra Leonese family whose lives and fortunes are woven into the greed, violence and intrigue born of the diamond trade."
I:18212;604;"the story of ""Blood Diamond"" is simple."
I:18212;605;The interest of various groups and individuals collide in this mix of adventure, greed and brutality.
I:18212;606;"Journalists seek the next big story
I:18212;607;Finding himself literally enslaved by it, he one day finds an enormous, rare pink diamond.
I:18212;608;Along the way, these three help each other toward a deeper awareness of the price of the trade, the hypocrisies of those who profit by denouncing it, and the need to succor those destroyed by it.
I:18212;609;The battle scenes are rendered with anarchic and gut.
I:18212;610;The diamond that graces your loved one's hand or earlobe may not have caused a family to die in violence.
I:18212;611;Blood Diamond the newest Leo vehicle that got lots of Oscar buzz and came out about the same time as the Departed.
I:18212;612;this film is directed by Ed Zwick ( Glory, Last Samurai) He's turning into one of my favorite director, always does a fantastic just pacing the story.
I:18212;613;He shoots beautifully and captures action and drama well.
I:18212;614;Leo and Djimon Hounsou both did a fantastic job in this film.
I:18212;615;Leo's accent is flawless in this film and really goes toe to toe with Hounsou on the intensity.
I:18212;616;I'm not a huge Leo fan but after works like Gangs of New York, the Aviator, the Departed and now this film I'm starting to see the appeal of him, he is a very fine young actor that is on the fast track of following in the footsteps of cinema legends like Nicholson, DeNiro, Pacino and Brando.
I:18212;617;This was a great role for him to show case many of his talents.
I:18212;618;this film is more of a standard action/adventure type of movie that has a very nicely written script that movie the story and still give the characters time to spread their wings.
I:18212;619;This is one of those movies that is just very entertaining.
I:18212;620;I could recommend it to most of the people that enjoy a good thought proving movie that not too deep and never try's to go over your head.
I:18212;621;If you see it for a good price, pick this one for your collection.
I:18212;622;The only reason this isn't five stars is because once I turned off the film i really didn't think about it too much, but that's ok, I loved it while i was watching it
I:18212;623;This is a spectacular film however the video continued to need to pause for buffering despite myself being connected via ethernet to a stable high speed connection.
I:18212;624;a movie everyone must see.
I:18212;625;Great true life story on how the powerful few make the rest of the world to live in misery a must see
I:18212;626;the movie is a morality check amidst an action set piece.
I:18212;627;DiCaprio is excellent as usual and plays his part with world weary and pecimistic venom.
I:18212;628;And his military skills are very convincing.
I:18212;629;The movie is thrilling and thought provoking even if not perfect.
I:18212;630;This is a great Leonardo flick.
I:18212;631;There's a cute love interest and a very compelling father/son tale in the background.
I:18212;632;This is story telling at its best.
I:18212;633;A rare and sizable diamond is found by a worker in a warlord's diamond mine.
I:18212;634;'In a certain sense I found this film to comparable to 'Babel' .
I:18212;635;it tells s story that reveals an uncomfortable truth about our world, but remains grounded and personal with its perspective.
I:18212;636;with each actor/actress giving a solid performance .
I:18212;637;the film gives a really up.
I:18212;638;leonrado DiCaprio done an excellent job in his role.
I:18212;639;He excels as the aggressive and also at times sensitive smuggler.
I:18212;640;2006 has been exceptional year for him with two powerhouse roles .
I:18212;641;Djimon Honsou is one of my favorite actors, so, naturally, I liked his work in this.
I:18212;642;he gave THE best performance in the movie.
I:18212;643;I think this is Jennifer Connelly's second best performance in her career (the first being Requiem For A Dream).
I:18212;644;She shows how great an actress she can actually be, but it will never top her Requiem acting.
I:18212;645;"as Richard Roeper stated: ""Edward Zwick is the master of politically correct thrillers""."
I:18212;646;"Glory, ""The Last Samaurai,"" and ""The Siege"" were spectacular and suspenseful pictures with great acting, and I'm going to chalk this up onto that list as well."
I:18212;647;There are some great action set pieces that had me on the edge of my seat.
I:18212;648;Blood Diamond is violent, gritty, suspenseful, poignant, and long which is why it is worth your time.
I:18212;649;I really enjoyed this action adventure and this story which exposes the dismembering and deaths that are a result of the diamond business.
I:18212;650;Wonderful performances by Leonardo DiCaprio and his cast.
I:18212;651;i highly recommend it to mature audiences.
I:18212;652;I usually do not like Leonardo Dicaprio as an actor, but he played this role well.
I:18212;653;It is another good history lesson of the diamond trade in Sierra Leone.
I:18212;654;What is still happening today and what you think about how a simple gift causes so much pain in many areas of the world.
I:18212;655;Still, gripping, poignant, truthful, and educational.
I:18212;656;This socially conscious thriller centers around the illegal diamond trade in Sierra Leone during the late nineties.
I:18212;657;Blood Diamond is heavy on action and violence and manages to be socially poignant without being preachy.
I:18212;658;male redemption movie coming on, and I was right.
I:18212;659;But such is Hollywood .
I:18212;660;and DiCaprio's last dieing act redeems his selfish soul.
I:18212;661;Nevertheless, the movie manages to be engaging until the semi.
I:18212;662;The film also sheds light on the horrendous plight of young boys who are kidnapped and brainwashed into becoming rebel soldiers.
I:18212;663;Blood Diamond will satisfy viewers seeking an action film that has a somewhat original plot (or at least one more original than your average evil terrorist flick).
I:18212;664;good actors, beatiful pictures and of course a meaningful story about the conflictsthat sorounding Diamonds and other resources that cost human lifes, sad thing.
I:18212;665;if you're a DiCaprio fan, you'll probably enjoy his acting.
I:18212;666;It's a great film, and I think everyone should have to see it to understand what's going on all over africa.
I:18212;667;Within the past several years, we have developed the technology to create REAL diamonds .
I:18212;668;These stones are made, perfectly and flawlessly, in the laboratory.
I:18212;669;created precious gemstones and their earth.
I:18212;670;mined counterparts, is that the laboratory.
I:18212;671;This movie is a good introduction for those who are unaware of the atrocity of diamond mining in Africa.
I:18212;672;Thanks to the multifaceted story, brilliant acting and excellent camera/ editing.
I:18212;673;the movie sucks you right in.
I:18212;674;and that was one of the aims of this film, to make us reflect and adjust our behavior, and do our little thing to make world a better place.
I:18212;675;"to this point, Connely says to DiCaprio ""good things are done every day."
I:18212;676;In the end, they both do good things.
I:18212;677;kudos to casting director in this film.
I:18212;678;Thou I don't really like DiCaprio, he IS an excellent actor and he proves it from one movie to the next.
I:18212;679;connelly in one of her better performances.
I:18212;680;but the child soldiers of Africa are the real story of this film.
I:18212;681;But it was worth it.
I:18212;682;this movie will haunt you for a while.
I:18212;683;This is a fast moving movie, as fast as Di Caprio speaking the patois of the region, Sierra Leone in the middle of a civil war (though actually filmed in gorgeous Mozambique.
I:18212;684;di Caprio puts in another great performance, a terrific lead in to The Departed.
I:18212;685;Good movie with a lot of action.
I:18212;686;I liked a lot about the movie: the acting, scenery, subject matter.
I:18212;687;The action sequences grant superman status to the stars.
I:18212;688;Dicaprio does a great job as a soldier in Africa.
I:18212;689;This movie was quite well done and very enjoyable.
I:18212;690;Blood Diamond is a great action.
I:18212;691;packed film directed by Edward Zwick.
I:18212;692;As pure entertainment, the film is quite action.
I:18212;693;though this is a work of fiction, the film brings up very important issues about exploitation in the diamond industry.
I:18212;694;The film will inspire you to read about blood diamonds and to become more informed about the ethics of resource extraction.
I:18212;695;crafted stories in an exotic setting about characters in spiritual as well as physical crisis, where the tension between personal gain and the larger good is especially taut.
I:18212;696;I loved this movie for its heartfelt ambition, its sincerity, its intelligence, and for its revelatory performance by Leonardo DiCaprio.
I:18212;697;None of us knows whose path will lead us to God.
I:18212;698;Danny Archer and his character arc is the key to appreciating what is ultimately uplifting and life.
I:18212;699;I've always respected DiCaprio's acting chops, but his performance here is a masterful synthesis of all the talent and range he's shown elsewhere.
I:18212;700;By turns, Archer is devilishly charming, terrifyingly threatening, scrappily street.
I:18212;701;DiCaprio navigates these deep waters with an impressive lack of showboating.
I:18212;702;It's a fearless, gripping performance, and Leo deserved his Oscar nod.
I:18212;703;This movie was very well put together for what it is.
I:18212;704;I love this movie, one of the best adaptations to the African Diamond crisis and the actors, well no words.
I:18212;705;i would recommend this movie to my son who wanted to run off to Africa in search of riches.
I:18212;706;One day Salomon is searching for diamonds as usual when he find a big pink diamond which is extremnly rare and very valuable.
I:18212;707;He buries it in the ground and thankfully he manage to escape while the rebels get attacked.
I:18212;708;Archer's greed is evident and during the film you'll see that he'll do anything for that diamond, including putting his own life in jeopardy.
I:18212;709;With their help she will get a better understanding of it and capture the cirmumstances with photographs which will eventually be a good thing.
I:18212;710;this film is both well made, educational and exciting and it's also realistic.
I:18212;711;Blood Diamond gives the truth and it's the best way of showing what's going on there to the masses.
I:18212;712;I recommend this film to everyone who's interested in seing a great film, about real happenings.
I:18212;713;However, it shouldn't be seen by children or faint hearted people cause of it's context but I recommend it to everyone else, interested in a history lesson or just to see a great film.
I:18212;714;Great movie Leo plays a great part love this movie one of his best movies I absolutely love it classic
I:18212;715;Really good movie that shows some crazy stuff that happens for control of diamonds in africa.
I:18212;716;A lot of really graphic violence and realistic affects too.
I:18212;717;It's a great story of greed, then friendship and love.
I:18212;718;and Dicaprio is great as always.
I:18212;719;my son watched this for a school project, he seemed to enjoy it, he's 15, I didn't see it so I am clueless
I:18212;720;but over all it was good.
I:18212;721;I am not one to give a perfect review.
I:18212;722;But here's what I am saying: this is the best movie I have ever seen.
I:18212;723;Dicaprio was spectacular with his South African accent and Djimon Honsou should have gone to the Academy Awards.
I:18212;724;I know good and this film is good!
I:18212;725;decaprio did a great performance from a soldier of fortune to a born.
I:18212;726;great performance of the other supporting actors too.
I:18212;727;the stunt, the fighting and massacre scenes were done great.
I:18212;728;one of the best movies about this country ,its diamonds,oil,and what man will do to get what they wont .
I:18212;729;Occasionally though, a movie comes along that is important for people to see, and succeeds in avoiding the pitfalls of being too self.
I:18212;730;important and hyped up to be something that it's not, and actually manages to appeal to your average moviegoer, therefore allowing the message to be heard, and maybe make a difference in the process.
I:18212;731;"One such success for Hollywood would be Edward Zwick's ""Blood Diamond""."
I:18212;732;Blood Diamond tells the story of the civil war that was overtaking Sierra Leone in 1999.
I:18212;733;"Why you may ask, well because director Edward Zwick (director of ""Glory"" and ""The Last Samurai"") was smart enough to make his story be interesting and entertaining, while including some star power that would enhance his chances of getting people to come to the movie."
I:18212;734;"Djimon Hounsou (""The Island"" and ""Amistad"") as the Mende fisherman, Solomon Vendy, delivers another terrific performance and continues to show his range as an actor."
I:18212;735;"Jennifer Connelly (""Hulk"" and ""A Beautiful Mind"") did a fine job of conveying the conflicted nature of her character as she is torn by wanting to help Solomon, yet in the process is wanting to help herself and her career by basically exploiting his plight and that of his country's."
I:18212;736;the story for the movie was solid and fast.
I:18212;737;The action scenes were very intense, and spaced out nicely throughout the movie, although there were a couple of times that it felt as if the writers had realized it had been awhile since someone had been shot or something blown up, so they threw in a random conflict to spice things up, but other than that I couldn't complain about the amount of action.
I:18212;738;when it was all said and done, I would have to say that this was a very good movie, but not one that I would want to see too many times, but it definitely will open eyes to what goes on within parts of the diamond industry.
I:18212;739;And who knows maybe it will even make somewhat of a difference.
I:18212;740;Blood Diamond is rated R for violence and language.
I:18212;741;'Blood Diamond' is a very Hollywood film but at the same time it stays very true to the facts.
I:18212;742;The enigmatic African landscape is stunningly captured (even though it wasn't specifically filmed in Sierra Leone) and the score is both mesmerizing and haunting.
I:18212;743;The cinematography is superb as it gives the film a slick feel and also gives the landscape a role of its own.
I:18212;744;The slick execution makes 'Blood Diamond' entertaining, gripping and moving.
I:18212;745;Rosenblum's editing is good and Leavitt's screenplay is solid and engaging.
I:18212;746;The characters are well written and the insanity of the blood thirsty rebels is well depicted in a few scenes and the sequence where they brainwash the children turning them into immediate murderers, is chilling.
I:18212;747;The scenes between him and Dicaprio are a treat to watch.
I:18212;748;She has a comparatively smaller role but makes the best of it.
I:18212;749;All three actors form an interesting and entertaining trio.
I:18212;750;The supporting cast do well.
I:18212;751;or situation and I still think the issues are presented well enough to balance the effectiveness of the real problem and entertainment.
I:18212;752;overall, Zwick's 'Blood Diamond' is an excellent gripping drama thriller that showcases the talents of actors Hounsou and Dicaprio, writer Leavitt, music director Newton Howard and director of photography Serra.
I:18212;753;The Movie Itself received 5 Academy Award nominations, including best actor and best supporting actor.
I:18212;754;This is honestly a really good film.
I:18212;755;The black level is overall solid.
I:18212;756;If it does discourage you from purchasing this Blu.
I:18212;757;Blood on the Stone: Follow a Diamond's Path from the Ground to the Store (50 minutes) is a really in.
I:18212;758;"depth look at the real ""Blood Diamonds"" out there."
I:18212;759;Inside the Siege of Freetown: Edward Zwick on One of the Movie's Pivotal Sequences (10 minutes) is really interesting and worth watching.
I:18212;760;"Overall this release has some pretty decent bonus materials but I have a feeling that an ""In."
I:18212;761;There was a pretty good plot line to the move.
I:18212;762;His performance was not as good as in his more recent movies like Inception and Shutter Island, but his South African accent was very good.
I:18212;763;This is a good film and that Zwick's gamble paid off at the end brings me not little pleasure.
I:18212;764;The film, mainly shot in South Africa (we see some exquisite East Coast landscapes) and Mozambiquan towns, took a tremendous effort to make, both logistically and politically.
I:18212;765;far for being simply PC, this film shows that Hollywwod can sometimes be genuinely concerned about the root causes of human suffering.
I:18212;766;famous around the world as perhaps some of the best trackers and fighters in history.
I:18212;767;diCaprio was, for me, a great surprise.
I:18212;768;The acting suggested a combination of intelligence and fierceness, an announcement of a new force on the acting scene.
I:18212;769;Finally, the music was excellent.
I:18212;770;all in all, an excellent film that exposes what has been going on in West Africa in the past decade or two.
I:18212;771;This movie is a step in the right direction.
I:18212;772;My students highly recommended this to me and it was great!
I:18212;773;Sad that humans are like this, but still a great movie.
I:18212;774;This is actually my second time watching this movie and I noticed a lot more subtleties this time around.
I:18212;775;This is probably one of those movies that will stand the test of time.
I:18212;776;It's great, suspensful, and extremely gripping.
I:18212;777;Loved every minute of it, even the subtitles, which usually annoy me.
I:18212;778;I continue to have positive experiences with this company!
I:18212;779;Wow what an awesome movie!
I:18212;780;I had to watch this for one of my college courses but it is definitely worth owning.
I:18212;781;A very well put together movie!
I:18212;782;MOVIE: Edward Zwick's films always strike a good chord with me because of their incredible emotional impact.
I:18212;783;The Last Samurai left such a grand impact on me that I was in tears at its incredible and emotional climax.
I:18212;784;The Blood Diamond does the same thing by establishing strong central characters with a clear objective that makes the film gripping and tense.
I:18212;785;Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a Rhodesian smuggler who works for a corporate diamond company in London he also works as a mercenary.
I:18212;786;Vandy is able to escape his imprisonment by the rebels but is put in prison by the police, and in prison he meets Danny Archer who now wants to set his sights on the hidden diamond.
I:18212;787;When Archer meets Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly), an American journalist, she believes that his story holds the key to revealing the truth behind the diamond corporations.
I:18212;788;the film has many sides to it.
I:18212;789;At times it's a dark look into the social and economical conflicts of Africa, sometimes it becomes a burning commentary on the nature of man, but overall this film is an intimate story of three characters placed within the setting.
I:18212;790;I'm not saying the latter films are bad, I enjoyed Tears Of The Suns and Black Hawk Down immensely.
I:18212;791;Blood Diamond is not only emotional but it's incredibly tense and thrilling.
I:18212;792;There is lots of action in the film and the final air raid was executed perfectly.
I:18212;793;The story is solid and the film is an immense accomplishment.
I:18212;794;The pace and structure were very consistant and strong.
I:18212;795;I was pleased by the script, Charles Leavitt did a fine job with the screenplay even though he has taken a long break from writing since his last effort with K. pax.
I:18212;796;the film also displays some incredible artistic efforts.
I:18212;797;The cinematography is absolutely stunning.
I:18212;798;There is a very good chance that Eduardo Serra should be one of the directors of photography nominated this year at the Oscars.
I:18212;799;Some of the shots were truly breathtaking and of course you have to give credit to beautiful landscapes of Africa.
I:18212;800;Zimmer made African vocals his speciality with films like A World Apart, The Power Of One, The Lion King, and Tears Of The Sun.
I:18212;801;You have to acknowledge the Zimmer style in the score, but James Newton Howard makes it completely his own and delivers an amazing score.
I:18212;802;There were scenes where I wished the score was more prominent, but overall I was very happy with the musical efforts.
I:18212;803;All of the artistic efforts put together with the story make Blood Diamond what it is.
I:18212;804;aCTING: Does Leonardo DiCaprio give his best performance yet?
I:18212;805;He was amazing in the film and created a perfectly accessible character that we cared for.
I:18212;806;Many people are criticizing his accent when in fact he is using an extremely authentic Rhodesian accent.
I:18212;807;DiCaprio does an amazing job with the role.
I:18212;808;Djimon Hounsou is also equally amazing in the film.
I:18212;809;There are a few intimate scenes with his son that will bring you to tears.
I:18212;810;Jennifer Connelly is a great actress and she portrays a journalist just as a journalist would act.
I:18212;811;The acting in this film is superb, the characters all carry the film and make it something to remember.
I:18212;812;bOTTOM LINE: Blood Diamond is gripping, thrilling and emotional.
I:18212;813;I shed some tears when I saw The Last Samurai and I indeed shed some tears when I saw Blood Diamond.
I:18212;814;It's an action film with so much substance, it really pulls you in as an audience member.
I:18212;815;The 3 leads are all good here but the images that will remain are the violent scenes, many involving children.
I:18212;816;The 3 main characters are a diamond smuggler, a simple fisherman, and a young journalist.
I:18212;817;Yet they make more miraculous escapes than Superman, Rambo and Wonder Woman here.3.
I:18212;818;"The overall ""Let's Blame America"" tone of the movie."
I:18212;819;Of course I didn't totally believe her then cause I was like 6 but after seeing this you come to see how valuable and beautiful Africa really is.
I:18212;820;Everything starts with Solomon Vandy, a good man with a good family and his son is a good student.
I:18212;821;while working the mines Vandy finds one of the largest and rarest diamonds ever.
I:18212;822;It was so realistic and perfected that you had to feel his pain.
I:18212;823;The scene at the end with when he tries to bring his brainwashed sons mind back was amazing.
I:18212;824;I too have never really been a Leo fan but you can't deny that he has a great talent.
I:18212;825;I'm not exactly sure how accurate this movie is with the history but overall it's a great film and is a must see.
I:18212;826;I enjoyed this movie alot but it seems that they picked a nice safe topic to rant about.
I:18212;827;I did like how they also brought up the topic of child soldiers.
I:18212;828;BLOOD DIAMOND is an extremely important film from the informational standpoint.
I:18212;829;"
I:18212;830;it is Vendy who has found the illusive 100.
I:18212;831;all of these characters converge in a superb action.
I:18212;832;the Thomas Newton Howard soundtrack is absolutely riveting as well as the excellent cinematography and smart editing.
I:18212;833;two actors of such calibre deseved better than this.
I:18212;834;i and my friends included!!!)
I:18212;835;Where this film succeeds is in the information that the viewer gains about the continuing exploitation of the Africas and the civil unrest that exists among it's own people.
I:18212;836;there is an excellent warning at the conclusion of the film for anyone who might be considering purchasing diamonds.
I:18212;837;An African fisherman Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou in a powerful performance) wants a better life for his son so he makes sure he gets to school every day, hopefully one day he will be a lawyer.
I:18212;838;Danny Archer (Leonard DiCaprio stunningly good) is an ex.
I:18212;839;soldier of fortune now a diamond smuggler with some pretty high connections in the diamond industry.
I:18212;840;Director Edward Zwick pulls these two lives together in a powerful, sobering and riveting story.
I:18212;841;But emotional core of the movie is Vandy's attempt to find his son who whe believes has been captured by the African rebels and his unblinding love for his family and attempts to find them and keep them together.
I:18212;842;This movie might make you think twice before you put on that diamond necklace, it pulls no punches and will leave you stunned at times.
I:18212;843;But great acting, a powerful story and superb directing make this a powerhouse of an action thriller.
I:18212;844;This movie has got it all.
I:18212;845;Leo DiCaprio and Djimon Hounsou deliver a powerful performance worthy of 5 Academy Award Nominations.
I:18212;846;This movie portrays that civil war very well.
I:18212;847;This is one of the most powerful movies I've seen since the turn of the century.
I:18212;848;I remember a candy bar commercial that left a lasting impact on me.
I:18212;849;He rushes to the local convenience store and see's that, to his great delight, there is only one more Kit.
I:18212;850;There they raped the women, killed the men, and took the children with them to train them to be revolutionaries too.
I:18212;851;She figures if she can learn about how diamonds are smuggled she can take a good first step, which is why she is particularly interested in Danny's form of work.
I:18212;852;In most movies the human feelings are besides the point.
I:18212;853;Also worth noting is the excellent acting.
I:18212;854;"Leonardo DiCaprio shows that he's come a long way since he made ""Romeo and Juliet"" and ""The Beach."
I:18212;855;Sporting a very convincing Australian accent, DiCaprio not only sounds like a native from Africa, but his accent is consistent.
I:18212;856;It's also worth noting that DiCaprio's performance is really the only performance there is to critique in the first place.
I:18212;857;All the actors are so convincing in this movie that I forgot anyone was even acting in the first place.
I:18212;858;What I want to laminate on is the excellent acting, spectacular action sequences, and heartbreaking ending.
I:18212;859;Hey, I AM watching a movie as opposed to a documentary!
I:18212;860;I think laminating on these things is worth doing after you see a good movie.
I:18212;861;"And ""Blood Diamond"" is a great movie."
I:18212;862;the films they think have the best chance of grabbing Oscar gold.
I:18212;863;These tend to be big budget affairs, with big stars, and often with serious or important themes.
I:18212;864;"Well, ""Blood Diamond"" arrives with just such expectations."
I:18212;865;"A well meaning and ""important"" film about exploitation and atrocities in Sierra Leone's diamond trade, ""Blood Diamond"" casts Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Connelly, and Djimon Hounsou as the central characters in an exciting, and sometimes heartbreaking, look at the cost of commercialism in international trading."
I:18212;866;"edward Zwick (who has courted Oscar before with ""Glory"" and ""The Last Samurai"") sets a very serious tone from the beginning."
I:18212;867;i got wrapped up in it.
I:18212;868;Well, it's a heck of an action picture and it boasts terrific performances.
I:18212;869;All three are at the top of their game.
I:18212;870;Hounsou is absolutely riveting in an emotional powerhouse of a performance.
I:18212;871;DiCaprio acquits himself well with a Rhodesian accent and displays many layers to the morally questionable anti.
I:18212;872;the film is technically impressive.
I:18212;873;the cinematography and score earn high marks.
I:18212;874;But it's the brutal and compelling action sequences that will stick with you.
I:18212;875;Theses scenes are done with such precision, such excitement, and such realism.you almost forget that the film wants to teach you a lesson too.
I:18212;876;it has the power to excite you and move you.
I:18212;877;Far from a perfect film, it is eminently watchable.
I:18212;878;top for my taste, as well, but by then I'd really enjoyed the journey.
I:18212;879;A solid 3 1/2 star rating, I'm rounding up for the action set pieces.
I:18212;880;It was entertaining, to say the least, and action.
I:18212;881;packed and exciting the whole way through.
I:18212;882;It also had a strong message, solid direction, and a great cast.
I:18212;883;Blood Diamond attempts to shed light on an important issue, and it did so with elegance and precision.
I:18212;884;It's message resonates, and will stay with you for days later.
I:18212;885;I thought this movie was excellent.
I:18212;886;It helps that this a very fine movie.
I:18212;887;In telling the story of a country, there's a fine line between making it enjoyable for the person watching, and also making it realistic and accurate .
I:18212;888;but after seeing it, I am happy to say that this movie measures up to both.
I:18212;889;they did a very good job of making it.
I:18212;890;they especially did a great job of portraying the nature and intentions of the RUF rebels, and their use of child soldiers, as well as the struggle that families had in staying together.
I:18212;891;the attack on the capital city really surprised me .
I:18212;892;it was so much like the real one that I wondered how they were able to do it, until I found out that an African journalist had helped them recreate it.
I:18212;893;It's certainly compelling with good cinematography.
I:18212;894;i can always see him acting.
I:18212;895;"This is a ""message"" movie, and while it IS an important message, the viewer is left both ultimately troubled and impotent."
I:18212;896;This one takes sharp aim at the diamond industry, and comes off well.
I:18212;897;Good script, decent pacing, lots of suspense, and solid performances.
I:18212;898;the total diamond story has yet to be told, but this is a good start.
I:18212;899;With fantastic performances by Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Hounsou as well as a riveting adventure and heartbreaking setting, Blood Diamond brings very real issues to the table and presents them masterfully.
I:18212;900;I absolutely love this movie and highly recommend it.
I:18212;901;The father in this movie was amazing.
I:18212;902;He endured so much and what kept him going was the love of his family.
I:18212;903;I love the video, it is packed with action.
I:18212;904;The lead actors do a very good job of portraying the high risks of smuggling in Africa's continual civil wars.
I:18212;905;He makes this film work along with the other supporting actors.
I:18212;906;The movie is an interesting look at the diamond trade and how it can fund civil conflicts and create the opportunity for genocide.
I:18212;907;very good movie watch it 3 timesyou will like this movie very good true storyand lots of action
I:18212;908;it is also a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength.
I:18212;909;leonardo DiCaprio, Djimon Hounsou, Arnold Vosloo, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!
I:18212;910;All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!
I:18212;911;Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few thrills, not to mention a few tears.
I:18212;912;An intense searing drama based on the stuff of real life, Blood Diamond is just as compelling and powerful now as it would have been at least 20 years ago or more.
I:18212;913;show to be just as potent a source for them as South Africa.
I:18212;914;And here we also find Maddie Bowen, an American female journalist played by Jennifer Connelly, whose own sense of humanity is tested in the face of horrendous eventsWhile a lot of the above may sound cliched, the combination of outstanding performances (Di Caprio has by now come so far from both Gangs of New York and Titanic that it is truly remarkable) and the unrelentingly brutal violence of greed.
I:18212;915;The director, Edward Zwick, has crafted a powerful film that hits home like very few other cinematic works this season.
I:18212;916;This is a film that everyone should see.
I:18212;917;In the past you have always sent the correct zone for us
I:18212;918;Leonardo Dicaprio is great in this.
I:18212;919;djimon Hounsou, gave one of his best performances (deserved the Academy Award in my opinion), as the father whose son is stolen for war and finds the potential rarest diamond in the world, which he uses to find his son and reunite with his lost family.
I:18212;920;Two stunning scenes: Djimon's character escapes from a place where people are forced and killed to mine diamonds, never seeing the finished product, to peer into a London jewelry shop window for the first time to see the finished product on sale and when his son is about to shot him and he reminds his son who he is, his origin, family roots and the love for his family!
I:18212;921;wow, this was a new awakening movie.
I:18212;922;It has all do with greed and take advantage of the human race.
I:18212;923;worthy performance in the lead role as a selfish greedy guy who is altered in a positive way by an idealistic female journalist.
I:18212;924;I didn't want to like this movie because it was violent and painful to watch but I admired many of the characters and the subtle change in the lead character was inspiring to watch.
I:18212;925;Djimon Hounsou was amazing and DID win an Oscar for his portrayal of a simple man of principle who never wavers.
I:18212;926;Beside being the sign of my Month, this a name of a brilliant actor in this movie.
I:18212;927;He did one of the best job in his career.
I:18212;928;Recommend everyone to watch this!
I:18212;929;"Finally a movie with great actors and story line to show the world a glimpse of the effects of supply in demand in places ""far away"" from the comfort."
I:18212;930;Must see should impact the way you view diamonds.
I:18212;931;Our hats off to him!Blood Diamond's director Edward Zwick did another fantastic job here.
I:18212;932;We loved his The Last Samurai, with Tom Cruise.
I:18212;933;Yet another fantastic thinking man's action flick.
I:18212;934;blood Diamond also has the unusual unsappy love story, which is a much more realistic way to approach such things.
I:18212;935;Beautiful cinemetography, savage tribes and warlords abound here, showing the mostly unknowledgeable viewing audience of such real.
I:18212;936;life happenings in the world today.
I:18212;937;With its superlative storytelling, strong performances, excellent action sequences, and differing locales of harsh living and lush beauty, Blood Diamond delivers on many levels.
I:18212;938;that's just powerful movie making.
I:18212;939;This is a Excellent Film!
I:18212;940;As usually acting of De Caprio is marvelous!I strongly recommended this to others!
I:18212;941;'Evil triumphs when the good people remain silent'.
I:18212;942;I look forward to the day when the good people of Africa will stand up to them.
I:18212;943;Leo DiCaprio is going to get a well.
I:18212;944;He's so talented, believable, and puts himself fully into the character.
I:18212;945;Gave 4 stars, because of the acting and because the point of the story is to wake us up from our slumber.
I:18212;946;But I can say I woke up.
I:18212;947;Worth stocking up for personal collection.
I:18212;948;Leonardo DiCaprio's Performance: This film in my opinion features the best ever performance extracted from Leonardo DiCaprio on film.
I:18212;949;He is flawless here as a South Africa white who needs to discover whether material wealth means more to him than human emotion and sentiment.
I:18212;950;"I have never been a huge fan of Leo (though yes, he was wonderful in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" and ""The Beach"") but this film alongwith ""The Departed"" really opened my eyes."
I:18212;951;He is one actor who looks about 25 even though hes well past 40, and has an incredible range.
I:18212;952;If you pay attention, you will actually see that he gets MORE screen time than Leo.3.
I:18212;953;utilized actresses we have today, and the director doesn't do much with her here either, which is a pity.
I:18212;954;The visuals are lush and evocative, and captures the mood of the era and environment perfectly.5.
I:18212;955;Direction and Story : The director knew a good thing when he saw it.
I:18212;956;it goes without saying that Leonardo DiCaprio carries this film on his capable shoulders and takes you through almost three gripping hours of it without making you look at your watch.
I:18212;957;This is what real acting and filmmaking is all about.
I:18212;958;to wrap it up, this is a must have 2.
I:18212;959;These two films finally signal the true emergence of America's greatest living actor .
I:18212;960;Rarely does a movie come along that is important and yet also works as a movie.
I:18212;961;Blood Diamond is just such a rare gem.
I:18212;962;"They represent the three essential plot elements: a South African white diamond smuggler
I:18212;963;and, by extension, the generation.
I:18212;964;everything is well done in this movie.
I:18212;965;This movie was a very powerful one that stirs the emotion.
I:18212;966;It gave a realistic insight on what people will do to accquire a diamond.
I:18212;967;I was brought to tears when I saw how people had no regards to their country men, women, and children in the name of money from the sale of illegal diamonds.
I:18212;968;I pray for the people of Africa that one day they will be able to love and respect each other
I:18212;969;The headline of this review basically sums it all up.
I:18212;970;It's about as good as a movie you'll ever see.
I:18212;971;Leo was fantastic as always, as was Djimon Hounsou.
I:18212;972;It's powerful, gripping, compelling, and fascinating.
I:18212;973;Will watch it many times.
I:18212;974;Fast shipping and good service.
I:18212;975;And DJimon Honshue is great in this.
I:18212;976;Jennifer Connolly is excellent, also.
I:18212;977;A story worth telling that includes the making of child soldiers from kidnapped boys.
I:18212;978;This is one of the best political films I've ever seen.
I:18212;979;thrilling action, wonderful acting, and stunning political implications.
I:18212;980;The twist here, is that the rebels receive their guns by trading diamonds with the more powerful countries that thoughtlessly fuel the African diamond trade.
I:18212;981;She is determined to document the diamond trade and unravel the tragedies of humanity within western Africa.
I:18212;982;blowing intensity, and remarkable political relevance, BLOOD DIAMOND is one of the most gripping films of the year.
I:18212;983;Watch it and you will be absolutely gripped, forced to rethink your philosophies about world connections and the masked corruption that exists in economic policy today.
I:18212;984;Overall, it's rare to find films like that capture contemporary world history in a way that's also emotionally moving.
I:18212;985;The movie was very very good.
I:18212;986;I very highly recommend this intense action movie.
I:18212;987;He really is a great actor.
I:18212;988;This movie has everything, a touch of romance, lots of action, and shows the tragedy facing the poor in Africa for the sake of diamonds.
I:18212;989;This movie is a must see and have for your video library.
I:18212;990;The film that made me finally appreciate Leo as an actor and even look back upon his previous films and appreciate his immense talent.
I:18212;991;the film is riddled with great performances from Djimon Hounsou, Jennifer Connelly, and the Mummy himself Arnold Vosloo.
I:18212;992;An intense thriller with strong statements and emotional depth, I'd recommend this to anyone who loves a move that holds up as a thinking man's film, as well as some kick ass action scenes that only add to the film.
I:18212;993;I had expectations before seeing this film from the reviews that it was going to be a good film .
I:18212;994;how he did'nt get an Oscar beats me .
I:18212;995;I will be a Leonardo fan from this moment on .
I:18212;996;Instantly one of my top 5 movies of all time.
I:18212;997;DiCaprio is near perfect as are his entire supporting cast.
I:18212;998;The fact that this movie is based on a true story makes it even more compelling and enjoyable.
I:18212;999;To say the least, I was riveted the entire time and felt immensely for the characters and what they were going through, especially towards the end.
I:18212;1000;This has to be considered one of the greatest movies ever made and I thought it deserved the Oscar over 'The Departed', which was also very, very good.
I:18212;1001;Seen it twice in theatre and bought it immediately
I:18212;1002;zwick does go on and on in great detail, through practically every scene of the movie, talking about both the historical context and the 'art' of cinematography.
I:18212;1003;It is these extra touches that give depth, making this movie more than 'just' an action movie.
I:18212;1004;Blood diamond is well written, informing and brilliantly acted.
I:18212;1005;I think it is Leonardo De Caprio's greatest role.
I:18212;1006;it was amazing, Brilliant, and stunning.
I:18212;1007;Its amazing how to us diamonds represent our ideals of beauty, eternal love and romance and also the very harsh and violent cultural and economic conditions that produce some of them, something that for the most part Americans are blind to.
I:18212;1008;Leonardo DiCaprio was breathtaking , and continues to produce astounding movies.
I:18212;1009;I do not usually watch movies like this, full of blood, violence, destruction of countries for profit, but I decided to give it a try and found it to be a provocative movie.
I:18212;1010;I also found it interesting that the market for diamonds is kept artfically high by keeping them off the market.
I:18212;1011;While I recognize this is a movie and may or may not have any truth to it I found it very thoughtful.
I:18212;1012;I saw the movie last weekend with a friend.
I:18212;1013;accentIt is a brilliant movie.
I:18212;1014;Leo gives an amazing performance.
I:18212;1015;it opens your eyes of what is happening in Africa (I cried a lot).
I:18212;1016;i am very proud of Leo that he did this movie.
I:18212;1017;But I am so happy that Leo got nominated.
I:18212;1018;it is a really important movie (not just an action movie).
I:18212;1019;Very compelling and well acted film showing all the corruption and suffering that go into producing the world's diamond supply.
I:18212;1020;Leonardo DiCaprio was excellent as a corrupt adventurer who seeks out diamonds for some shady London businessmen.
I:18212;1021;He comes across a man in prison who claims to have found a huge diamond.
I:18212;1022;I really enjoyed this movie.
I:18212;1023;Leonardo Dicaprio does a great job with a great story.
I:18212;1024;thats why i loved this movie.
I:18212;1025;an excellent movie for those interested in Africa and african issues.
I:18212;1026;Difficult to watch but if you want a sense of what it is like in the many civil wars in Africa this gives you a good idea.
I:18212;1027;Jennifer Connelly is passable as the magazine writer/journalist with good intentions and the nose for a good story who befriends DiCaprio and provides minimal romantic interest.
I:18212;1028;flam of the latest leftist cause celebre, then BLOOD DIAMOND offers entertainment value as a rollickingly good action flick.
I:18212;1029;wow this movie turned out to be one of the best I've ever seen.
I:18212;1030;Great movie really worth the time have a seat with some popcorn with family and friends alike will enjoy this fil
I:18212;1031;This movie is a good one.
I:18212;1032;I love movies like this that open westerners eyes to the things that happen in other countries specifically Africa, which many say God has left.
I:18212;1033;They're barely watchable, much less entertaining.
I:18212;1034;Blood Diamond is a welcome exception.
I:18212;1035;An action film with attractive, involving characters and memorable .
I:18212;1036;"djimon Hounsou is a powerful, empathetic presence throughout ""Blood Diamond"", and Jennifer Connelly makes Maddy's sense of adventure, bravery, and commitment to her beliefs infectious."
I:18212;1037;But it is Leonardo DiCaprio's portrayal of sharp, wounded, resourceful Danny Archer that pulls the audience into this film.
I:18212;1038;"Danny's unyielding determination to survive, his relentless motion in the direction of necessity is ""Blood Diamond""'s driving force."
I:18212;1039;The extended sequence of the RUF's assault on Freetown is one of the most memorable depictions of war that I've seen on film.
I:18212;1040;He does talk about the cultural connections between Sierra Leone and the Western world, the plight of the child soldiers, and how he approached depicting real events.
I:18212;1041;Zwick also addresses the challenges of filming, cinematography, how he got the necessary exposition into the film, and filming on location in Mozambique and South Africa.
I:18212;1042;Subtitles are available for the film in English, French, and Spanish.
I:18212;1043;With recent outstanding performances in the Aviator, The Departed and in this movie DiCaprio is becoming a powerhouse on the big screen.
I:18212;1044;Here he is fantastic and believable as Danny Archer, a mercenary from Zimbabwe.
I:18212;1045;His true accent and mannerisms suggest he studied well for this part.
I:18212;1046;Even in his use of inconsequential dialog he gets it right.
I:18212;1047;In one of the many memorable scenes she forcefully expresses her frustration that her heartfelt stories and photos of suffering families will not be enough to make headlines outside of Africa.
I:18212;1048;All three main characters move through a beautiful countryside marred by violence.
I:18212;1049;Vandy, an honest and hard working fisherman knows his son has been caught up in this.
I:18212;1050;He will do anything to get his son back.
I:18212;1051;The cinematography is outstanding, the ending superb(with a little twist as to the destination and use of the smuggled diamonds).
I:18212;1052;"Greed is the dark heart of ""Blood Diamond,"" director Edward Zwick's (""The Last Samurai"") uncompromising look into the underground trafficking of illegally."
I:18212;1053;He desires escape from Africa at any cost, yet secretly knows that his blood will someday mix with the earth of his homeland.
I:18212;1054;He eventually agrees to help Archer.
I:18212;1055;The pace of the movie is frenetic.
I:18212;1056;The score is perfect throughout.
I:18212;1057;"The ""education"" of Vandy's son by the rebels is heart."
I:18212;1058;Solomon's overarching belief that fatherhood trumps all initially feels nave, but is eventually revealed to be the singularly most powerful force in the entire movie.
I:18212;1059;the realist mercenary who seems most capable of surviving, when compared to Vandy.
I:18212;1060;shows the most evolution, shedding layers of the personality onion until an actual human appears.
I:18212;1061;He is moved to reveal an element of his past to the beautiful American reporter (Jennifer Connelly), whose persistence and mutual survivorship cements a bond they both were too proud to admit from their first meeting.
I:18212;1062;down Djimon's most impressive performance: I have never seen him better represent a character.
I:18212;1063;that DiCaprio's accent is spot.
I:18212;1064;In addition, he was utterly believable as heartless mercenary, and his later transformation was also quite convincing.
I:18212;1065;easily one of my five favorite movies of 2006.
I:18212;1066;Even though Archer is a fictional fortune hunter dashing arcoss Sierra Leone to cash in on the chaotic diamond trade, his revelations to crusading journalist Manny bowen (Jennifer Connelly) of greed and capitolism run amok are startling and they help lend moral resonance to a film that is otherwise a thrilling two and a half hour chase through the African bush.
I:18212;1067;Vandy, who is played with immense passion by Houson, is a fisherman who lost track of his family when his village was raided by rebel soldiers, including child soldiers brandishing AK.47's bought from the illicit diamond trade.
I:18212;1068;Vandy's wife and daughters escape to a refugee camp but his son is captured by rebel soldiers and indoctrinated into the army.
I:18212;1069;the film's themes and imagery haunt because of the superb acting from the trio of leads (Dicaprio, Connelly and Houson) that carry the entire film.
I:18212;1070;"Dicaprio has the trickiest role of a rougish and amorous soldier of fortune willing to sell out anyone and anything to acheive his goals, and he tears into the role with a confidence and maturity that is worlds away from ""Titanic"" and even his early work with Martin Scorcese."
I:18212;1071;He's charismatic, cunning and lethal, and perhaps this constitutes the finest work he has ever done.
I:18212;1072;Houson is pure power and passion as a father pushed to edge, who will trek through the hellish countryside of Sierra Leone to find his family.
I:18212;1073;Even the most uplifting aspects of the film are haunted by the chance that something like Sierra Leone may very well happen again.
I:18212;1074;"It is true that ""Blood Diamond"" is a dynamite chase film, and it is entertaining on that front, but it is the theme of global greed coldly manipulating nations and lives for profit and the imagery of savage total war and child soldiers that is impossible to shake."
I:18212;1075;Vandy will lead Archer to the diamond in return for help finding his family.
I:18212;1076;Its a really good movie.
I:18212;1077;Leo DiCaprio puts out an amazing performance!!!
I:18212;1078;This was the second time watching it and I still loved it.
I:18212;1079;Great acting, drama and full entertainment.
I:18212;1080;Must see if you're an Leonardo fan.
I:18212;1081;Order this some time ago but I just love the movie!!
I:18212;1082;Leo is only in his early thirties and has the potential to be the best actor of his generation.
I:18212;1083;Djimon Hounsou is great as well and deserved the Oscar nomination he got for his role here.
I:18212;1084;The movie itself is more than just an action film, providing some food for thought.
I:18212;1085;It is also paced rather well.
I:18212;1086;Jennifer Connelly plays a journalist and does a great job of using her charm to help forget about the war that is going on, even if it is just for a moment.
I:18212;1087;The best parts are the action scenes.
I:18212;1088;It all leads to a very exciting ending.
I:18212;1089;there is great drama, a great story, and marvelous acting from everybody, but the action sequences stood out the most to me.
I:18212;1090;When they show up, expect to see some intense shoutouts.
I:18212;1091;The 2 fight scenes are also good, mainly because Djimon Hounsou is such a superb actor.
I:18212;1092;Dicaprio also gives an extraordinary performance.
I:18212;1093;He may be better in this than he was in 'The Aviator'.
I:18212;1094;this is the best movie I have seen in at least a couple months, and I am a hardcore movie junkie.
I:18212;1095;My rating sums up how I feel the best.
I:18212;1096;This movie gets a perfect 5/5 from me.
I:18212;1097;I liked this movie, I had just come from Kenya when I saw it on Amazon and bought it along with other films about Africa so it was thrill to see it.
I:18212;1098;Great story, great acting, superb director, unbeatable (for once)historic accuracy!
I:18212;1099;this is the way movies handling conflict zones should be made!My highest regards and compliments to the director, the producers, the cast and the staff!!
I:18212;1100;Was a little long and storyline dragged a bit but the acting was good and it's story that should be told.
I:18212;1101;This movie is a must see!
I:18212;1102;One of Leo's best films.
I:18212;1103;Makes you think how much greed can sometimes get the best of you.
I:18212;1104;Excellent movie, something orginial and thoughtfull, I would highly recommend this movie to anyone that loves good well thought out movies.
I:18212;1105;Good movie that brings light to somewhat obscure geo.
I:18212;1106;the acting in this movie is superb.
I:18212;1107;This movie is like Hotel Rwanda meets Titanic: It offers a vivid and stomach wrenching portrayal of a modern human atrocity with a classic hollywood story smothered on top of it.
I:18212;1108;There are numerous branching production videos that show how a particular scene was shot.
I:18212;1109;picture commentary is fantastic too.
I:18212;1110;Although it's not continuous video commentary (like Mission Impossible III), it's well worth watching.
I:18212;1111;As with most modern movies on hi.
I:18212;1112;def disc, the picture and sound is stellar.
I:18212;1113;Excellent movie about the illegal diamond trade in Sierra Leone!
I:18212;1114;The acting is superb and listening to DiCaprio's Afrikaner accent is a treat!
I:18212;1115;This is one of those movies.
I:18212;1116;Leonardo is superb and so is his co. star.
I:18212;1117;Before you hit the final act, you can pretty much guess the Hollywood ending you're heading toward.
I:18212;1118;BUT it's still a good film and worth seeing.
I:18212;1119;the actors did a very good job.
I:18212;1120;The movie got a good score from me, but the content gets a 2.
I:18212;1121;So overal I'll give it a 3.
I:18212;1122;the download was fast and the picture had no distortions the family enjoyed the movie big time.
I:18212;1123;i will keep ordering more.
I:18212;1124;A great action movie that attempts to reveal to the world the ugly side of the diamond trade and the human tragedy that was the civil war in Sierra Leone.
I:18212;1125;it has great performances by Leonardo DiCaprio, particularly towards the end, and by Djimon Hounsou and Jennifer Connelly.
I:18212;1126;I have no interest in diamonds whatsoever and have no view to express on their trade as a whole but it was very interesting to learn the long and complicated journey they can go sometimes, from the mine to the jewellery store.
I:18212;1127;i also enjoyed the evolvement of the relationship between the DiCaprio and Hounsou characters.
I:18212;1128;Deserving Oscar nominations have, alongside a couple of technical ones, gone to DiCaprio for Best Actor and to Hounsou for Best Supporting Actor.
I:18212;1129;"It's a thriller, with a multifaceted plot and, of course, love interests on many levels
I:18212;1130;It's grandiose, has beautiful photography.
I:18212;1131;It's deeply touching to see the power of love of a man for his son, and family.
I:18212;1132;It's deeply moving, as much as any film I've ever seen.
I:18212;1133;In this way it's an incredibly powerful film and story.
I:18212;1134;Watch this film and if you're on the market for a diamond, you'll think twice.
I:18212;1135;This movie was a action packed thriller.
I:18212;1136;One of my new favorites!!!
I:18212;1137;Leonardo DiCaprio is truly amazing, as is his supporting actor (sorry, cannot spell his name), but it should be well known to us as he was absolutely phenomenal.
I:18212;1138;This movie is one of the great movies from the '06 year.
I:18212;1139;Leonardo DiCaprios performance is as good as it gets as well as Dijmon Hounsou.
I:18212;1140;Very powerful movie, very entertaining.
I:18212;1141;Great story about as close as the diamond ind. goes .
I:18212;1142;My Mother and her late husband traveled everywere But the Galopagoes islands and she says It,s the most beautiful place on earth.
I:18212;1143;The simple diamond has become director Ed Zwick's latest interest, and here he explores this rock in such depth and detail, it is both amazing and scary.
I:18212;1144;He comes upon a pink diamond, a large rock, one of the rarest in the world.
I:18212;1145;Yes, I am using him and you are using me, and that's how it goes, Danny says.
I:18212;1146;I'm guessing many adults were, too.
I:18212;1147;I read many reviews criticizing Blood Diamond, saying that it felt like a documentary.
I:18212;1148;The acting is top notch.
I:18212;1149;Leonardo DiCaprio delivers a consistently great performance in every movie he's in and it's no exception here.
I:18212;1150;He is unflinching as the ruthless Danny Archer.
I:18212;1151;He always has an ulterior motive.
I:18212;1152;One of my favorite lines from the movie is uttered here.
I:18212;1153;Delivered with such emotion that it simply grabs you.
I:18212;1154;A well deserved Oscar nomination for his role here.
I:18212;1155;Soloman is a simple man, a family.
I:18212;1156;He is overwhelmed with what is happening around him.
I:18212;1157;She certainly feels it will and is unwavering in her mission to find out.
I:18212;1158;Danny and Maddy had some great chemistry, and ultimately that connection between them plays a vital role in the end of the movie.
I:18212;1159;other than this, many other factors contribute to the success of this movie.
I:18212;1160;It depicts the civil war to an amazing level of realism.
I:18212;1161;The music was also fantastic, infusing native sounds with orchestral elements to create a sweeping score of epic proportions.
I:18212;1162;in the end, the true power of this movie transcends what can be seen on the screen.
I:18212;1163;It really is more about what is felt upon watching this movie.
I:18212;1164;And it certainly did do exactly that for me.
I:18212;1165;Powerful, compelling and real would be some of the words I would choose to describe this awe.
I:18212;1166;A superb effort and one the best pictures I have seen.
I:18212;1167;My daughter watched this movie in school and said it is really good.
I:18212;1168;I watched it with her and it is a really good movie.
I:18212;1169;I have always enjoyed this film, from the story to the acting to the soundtrack.
I:18212;1170;Blood Diamond highlights an important issue .
I:18212;1171;the viewer is introduced to these issues via three characters .
I:18212;1172;makers are to be commended for bringing an important issue to a mainstream film, however, they are all.
I:18212;1173;This was a very interesting movie with a good topic and a great Story.
I:18212;1174;Once again, Edward Zwick, the Director who has brought us Glory, Legends of the Fall, the Last Samurai brings us a very emotive movie that strikes all the right chords without becoming cliche oversentimental.
I:18212;1175;Everyone has their own agendas and as we gradually dig beneath the surface, we find humanity that lurks within.
I:18212;1176;Overall, the movie is very powerful and well.
I:18212;1177;In Glory, there's Denzel Washington who's all proud and full of honour.
I:18212;1178;Overall, this is a tour.
I:18212;1179;force that keeps audience like myself thinking and something to be seen on the big screen.
I:18212;1180;Gives you a really good insight into one of the many worlds we live in.
I:18212;1181;Leonardo is spectacular in this movie.
I:18212;1182;It deserved every award it got, and probably many it didn't.
I:18212;1183;breaking and joyful, though mostly the former.
I:18212;1184;It's fascinating to learn a little bit about Africa.
I:18212;1185;Blood Diamond (2006) is an outstanding action movie, with a heavysentimental story running parallel, involving a mercenary and adiamond smuggler formerly of the South African army (played byLeonardo DiCaprio to perfection, including accent) with a variety ofindividuals, initially apart, but eventually interconnectedconsidering the extent of their interaction and the length of theactual movie.
I:18212;1186;from a didactic point of view, the script is entirely successful, asit brings into focus the monumental scale of refugee camps, familypowerlessness, homelessness, poverty, anarchy and chaos found incivil wars in Africa.
I:18212;1187;Connolly's approach is also interesting, from an eagerness inbeing sexier and more provocative than shy and reserved.
I:18212;1188;from a soundtrack perspective, s fair bit is reminiscent of theworld music heard on Jean Luc Ponty's Tchokola, while thecinematography is flawless, sharp, never dull or boring except for anumber of quieter moments, bringing into focus time and again thebeauty of various landscapes in Western Africa, appealing to thesentimentality of viewers.
I:18212;1189;the picture deserved a perfect score, with the only difference thatit forgot that it was an entertainment vehicle in its final moments,switching gears to a paternalistic, moralizing, and preaching tone,erasing the right of viewers to independent thought and opinion,suggesting they swallow the United Nations outlook hook, line andsinker concerning diamonds and arms trade.
I:18212;1190;in sum, this is a remarkable and unique release, from the acting,scenes, music and entertainment value, and the humanity of thepeople that shines through despite the horrors of civil wars timeand again.
I:18212;1191;I've seen it three times already and will probably watch it again.
I:18212;1192;Great performances by Leonardo di Caprio (who did a great job with the Dutch accent by the way!)
I:18212;1193;and Djimon Hounsou (who is so handsome).
I:18212;1194;"packed flick about Africa's corrupt diamond trade."""
I:18212;1195;It is the innocent farmers caught in between the fighting who pay the price.
I:18212;1196;He educates his son for a better life.
I:18212;1197;And then one day the rebels capture his son.
I:18212;1198;Archer will help him find his wife and children for the diamond.
I:18212;1199;The violence and the bloodshed are so real and caused me to close my eyes.
I:18212;1200;Leonardo DiCaprio, has the most complete role.
I:18212;1201;"It's a solid performance from Leonardo DiCaprio, who has grown into this sort of ""gritty"" role and is more believable after having been seen dancing on the dark side in The Departed."
I:18212;1202;He has discovered a measure of gravitas.
I:18212;1203;The message, other than the sory of civil war and the diamond trade, is that Leonardo Di Caprio has found his measure.
I:18212;1204;Both actors have good chemistry and worked well together.
I:18212;1205;I give this movie 5 stars.
I:18212;1206;The acting is great and the story brings home to America the price paid for one of our luxuries.
I:18212;1207;Leonardo DiCaprio is at his best.
I:18212;1208;life issues/events in the world and want to act accordingly.
I:18212;1209;believe, these kinds of things can and do happen and it shakes you, changes you.
I:18212;1210;The acting is fantastic, Leo and Djimon are truly outstanding in their roles and do the film's difficult subject matter justice.
I:18212;1211;This movie had us talking about the issues, and that is when art is at its best, when it makes you think, question, debate, and maybe squirm a little.
I:18212;1212;the movie also brings a sense of appreciation for people who survive in such places and especially for reporters who do not really need to be there except out of choice.
I:18212;1213;This was a fantastic movie all the way through.
I:18212;1214;It's a true story with a lot of action.
I:18212;1215;The two main actors were great.
I:18212;1216;Just think of the cast: Leonardo DiCaprio, Djimon Hounsou and beautiful Jennifer Connelly.
I:18212;1217;It is a story of greed, fatherly love and love in all the wrong places.
I:18212;1218;and also morality tale to about conflict that comes with beauty of the diamonds.
I:18212;1219;Although difficult to watch at some moments, it is definitely a gem of a movie I have seen lately.
I:18212;1220;A fantastic film, leo delivers a fantastic performance, i was shocked by how fantastic this film is.
I:18212;1221;Good movie you have to watch it, very action packed and emotional.
I:18212;1222;warm, and I avoided watching it until now, despite its 5 Oscar noms.
I:18212;1223;It has action, and plenty of it.
I:18212;1224;"And it boasts excellent performances from di Caprio, Hounsou and Jennifer Connelly, who should have been nominated, too (along with the strength of her performance in ""Little Children"")."
I:18212;1225;I was riveted from the beginning, and am so glad I finally saw this film.
I:18212;1226;An added note: I recall that Mr. Hounsou's performance was regarded as one.
I:18212;1227;"note and hysterical all the time
I:18212;1228;I thought he was centered and totally in touch with his character.
I:18212;1229;"And, was he really ""supporting""."
I:18212;1230;whatever the case, this movie is one of the best.
I:18212;1231;The topic is fresh in movie world and the acting is first class.
I:18212;1232;I truly enjoyed the acting, photography and the story, cruel and violent as it is, because it is well put together and it does not shy away from the hard reality.
I:18212;1233;I definitly recommend the two disc set as the documentary on the second disc is the best I've seen to date that is about blood diamonds.
I:18212;1234;Not even the National Geographic documentary is as insightful or entertaining.
I:18212;1235;I believe this movie will have a surprising affect on most people whom see it.
I:18212;1236;I've always been a fan of director Edward Zwick.
I:18212;1237;Legends of the Fall, Glory, About Last Night and The Last Samurai are all very watchable.
I:18212;1238;It works well at times, but at others it's hard to tell whether its a light.
I:18212;1239;hearted romp or a political piece of film.
I:18212;1240;I liked it though, and it's deinitely worth a look as it's fairly unique.
I:18212;1241;Blood Diamond is absolutely one of the best movies you will ever see.
I:18212;1242;This movie is very intense!
I:18212;1243;This movie definitely deserved an Oscar alongside Leonardo DiCaprio.
I:18212;1244;This movie shows how life really is for these poor people and captures the grittiness of what they go through just to live another day.
I:18212;1245;I highly recommend this movie to everybody.
I:18212;1246;Leo does it again, great acting awesome movie
I:18212;1247;That includes ivory, rubber, gold.
I:18212;1248;the story's hard to watch, but very real and worthwhile.
I:18212;1249;James Newton Howard does an amazing job with the soundtrack, which touches the scene in just the right way to emphasize the director's point.
I:18212;1250;morning movie serial, moving from one close call to another.
I:18212;1251;Lots and lots of women and children callously cut down in the film.
I:18212;1252;the action, if you will, is well staged and makes up for much of the rest.
I:18212;1253;"Edward Zwick, who did such a great job with GLORY and a pretty good job, I thought, with THE LAST SAMURAI, is clearly aiming for an ""important"" film here."
I:18212;1254;The editing, cinematography, landscapes and especially the actors and the ACTION are all first.
I:18212;1255;diCaprio is all the way back now as one of our great actors.
I:18212;1256;But this year, with THE DEPARTED and BLOOD DIAMOND, there is no doubting anymore that he is an actor of considerable skill.
I:18212;1257;seriously), he is first rate.
I:18212;1258;He's really a bad guy with charm, and the fact that we feel mostly on his side through the film, even though he's killing people left and right, is a testament to his charm.
I:18212;1259;jennifer Connelly, in a poorly written role, always looks great, and staring with roughly the middle of the film, her character begins to connect with the audience, and we start to like her.
I:18212;1260;and Djimon Hounsou is always a mighty presence.
I:18212;1261;He was great in AMISTAD, Oscar nominated for IN AMERICA, and truly in his element in BLOOD DIAMOND.
I:18212;1262;He's an African born actor, and in this film he's truly in his element.
I:18212;1263;He has a real sense of the pace and lifestyle of the region, and it comes across very well.
I:18212;1264;so, overall I recommend the film.
I:18212;1265;"But if you want adult entertainment with lots of action and don't mind a sheen of ""message,"" you'll be pleased."
I:18212;1266;And oddly, there's a sharp dividing line between the good and the bad, and that, of course, is Titanic.
I:18212;1267;They weren't all brilliant by any stretch of the imagination (The Basketball Diaries, really), but he was always brilliant in them.
I:18212;1268;Nothing can ever be easy.
I:18212;1269;Hounsou has been nominated for Academy Awards both for this and for In America, but, really.
I:18212;1270;Zwick, of course, is a director well.
I:18212;1271;received upon release, has become an enduring favorite of Brad Pitt fans.
I:18212;1272;Charles Leavitt's screenplay is both well.
I:18212;1273;(I'll put it this way: it was good enough to get him tabbed as the cinematographer on Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.
I:18212;1274;Maybe it'll change your mind, and let you see what the rest of us have known all along.
I:18212;1275;Most amazing of all, in spite of the fact that Jennifer Connelly is simply too beautiful to be credible, it is never over the top, but realistic throughout.
I:18212;1276;The acting is uniformly excellent, particularly Dicaprio, whom I have always thought is under.
I:18212;1277;It follows the course of 2 men and is quite surprising .
I:18212;1278;It is interesting and relevant, and this film provides an emotional backdrop to why we should concern ourselves.
I:18212;1279;But it is moving and necessary.
I:18212;1280;the leads, in my personal experience realistic, compared to all but 3.4 movies, mostly documentaries.
I:18212;1281;rated, and needed to be seen.
I:18212;1282;Blood Diamond was one of the better films of 2006.
I:18212;1283;Dicaprio in a Oscar nominated performance is outstanding, and so are Hounsou and Connelly.
I:18212;1284;Director Zwick hits the mark on this fine effort.
I:18212;1285;Blood Diamond is the kind of action film that makes you think that 'a moment of love, even in a bad man, can give meaning to a life.
I:18212;1286;believes this pink gem holds his ticket out of this godforsaken continent.
I:18212;1287;has hided the enormous 100 carat diamond from his captors and buried it in a secret place within the jungle.
I:18212;1288;danny makes a deal to help the noble fisherman find his family if Vandy will lead him to the diamond.
I:18212;1289;leonard DiCaprio is both ruthless and charming as the cynical soldier of fortune who knows an opportunity when it presents itself.
I:18212;1290;But he also is aggressive and selfish willing to do whatever it takes to get what he wants.
I:18212;1291;He illustrates the black side of the dirty diamond trade.
I:18212;1292;On his trek to find the stone, Archer's eyes are opened to some enduring values that surpass his own self.
I:18212;1293;She thinks that with Archer's help she can get a unique story line surrounding the civil war but also revealing corporate malfeasance and cover.
I:18212;1294;it is also good to mention Arnold Vosloo in the role of Colonel Coetzee, head of the army unit also trying to claim the diamond.
I:18212;1295;He's a great character actor and remains a powerful presence and one of the screen's most efficient scene.
I:18212;1296;"nominated for five Oscars, ""Blood Diamond"" is an action, political adventure at its best!"
I:18212;1297;Just make sure she watch this movie.
I:18212;1298;Carbon is one of the most plentiful elements on the Earth's surface.
I:18212;1299;certain firms have control of the diamond trade world wide ( a cartel)and have driven the price artificially high.
I:18212;1300;news has become the new weapon.
I:18212;1301;This latest work by Edward Zwick tackles a serious social issue in the guise of popular entertainment, which turns out to be both the greatest weakness and the greatest strength of the film.
I:18212;1302;"Blood diamonds, also known as ""conflict"" diamonds, are those that are mined in war zones, then sold to finance those wars."
I:18212;1303;with a screenplay by Charles Leavitt, based on a story by him and C. Gaby Mitchell, Zwick has fashioned a generally powerful film whose occasional dramatic contrivances can be easily forgiven in light of the salutary goal of the film.
I:18212;1304;but the air of First World condescension is faintly evident nonetheless.
I:18212;1305;miraculous dodging of bullets etc. .
I:18212;1306;"those negatives aside, ""Blood Diamond"" is, for the most part, an effective piece of serious commercial moviemaking, thanks, primarily, to Zwick's skill as a director and to the fine performances by DiCaprio, Connelly and, especially, Hounsou, whose quiet dignity and fierce determination do much to personalize the plight of the innocents caught in a hellhole of wanton slaughter and crass de."
I:18212;1307;This moveie kept me on the edge of my seat throughout.
I:18212;1308;An excpetionally well done movie.
I:18212;1309;And a wonderful amalgam of all of the issues with this very disturbing political situation.
I:18212;1310;Over the past year Leonardo Dicaprio has become one of my favorite actors.
I:18212;1311;He has totally renewed his image and become pretty hardcore.
I:18212;1312;He's like a thousand other guys in the South African army and for this authentic portrayal alone he deserves an Oscar.
I:18212;1313;balance with the movie, but it's generally a good watch.
I:18212;1314;dimensional qualities that make the character believable.
I:18212;1315;His co. star is also believable and emotionally mature enough to make this film such a great viewing opportunity.
I:18212;1316;Anyway, I saw it this weekend and it is actually excellent.
I:18212;1317;This is a great story.
I:18212;1318;DiCaprio does a great job as a menacing but very human South African mercenary (I think I was not sure this role would be a good match for him), there is lots of action and a moving story at the core.
I:18212;1319;It's a lot of fun too.
I:18212;1320;I really like this movie, it's one of the few I've enjoyed enough to consider watching more than once.
I:18212;1321;I was skeptical because i dont really like DiCaprio, but he actually did really well.
I:18212;1322;This movie is worth every penny.
I:18212;1323;Blood Diamond is one of the finest films of the year.
I:18212;1324;Featuring a well acted cast that includes Oscar Nominees Leonardo DiCarprio (Best Actor) and Djimon Hounsou (Best Supporting Actor) and also Oscar winner Jennifer Connelly.
I:18212;1325;this is a great film, whether you get the single disc or the two disc edition.
I:18212;1326;"described ""soldier of fortune,"" is weary of this arrangement and willing to sell his story to an American political journalist named Maddy (Jennifer Connelly) after he snatches the gem."
I:18212;1327;"at its core, ""Blood Diamond"" is really an ""Adventure In The Bush!"""
I:18212;1328;There are three significant action sequences, all well done, all convincingly played by the actors.
I:18212;1329;he can crack a joke one breath, crack a skull the next .
I:18212;1330;and DiCaprio gives the role the right kind of suave menace.
I:18212;1331;and used it for costly, epic shoots.
I:18212;1332;"style look at the Japanese samurai culture, ""Blood Diamond"" is late to the topical party."
I:18212;1333;But it has to be about more than that.
I:18212;1334;"Thought both leads did an excellent job of portraying the issues with ""Blood Diamonds""."
I:18212;1335;It was very informative about the diamond industry as a whole, historically as well as recently.
I:18212;1336;This is a really good movie to watch.
I:18212;1337;this is one movie that I would highly recommend this movie to anyone.
I:18212;1338;Blood Diamond is an excellent drama, with great characters, and exciting action sequences.
I:18212;1339;ray rendering of this movie, but also if there is a defining role for DiCaprio so far, this movie in my opinion is it.
I:18212;1340;the cinematography and directing is outstanding and the BD rendering is wonderful.
I:18212;1341;I found myself completely drawn into the action and story (even though the ending was predictable).
I:18212;1342;ray, great directing, great acting and story.
I:18212;1343;I think that this movie is the perfect blend of a documentary and an action.
I:18212;1344;But instead of going for a factual film, the creators decided to throw together a group of great actors and a set of interesting sidelines to the story, polishing it into a magnificent jewel.
I:18212;1345;solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) is a fisherman that dreams of his son, Dia, becoming a doctor and moving on to better things.
I:18212;1346;Luckily, Solomon's family escapes, but the RUF captures him and takes him to work on the diamond fields as a slave.
I:18212;1347;the film definitely achieves its purpose of making people aware of the issues, and even though the story is gut.
I:18212;1348;What I did not expect before watching this movie was the outstanding performances I was going to witness.
I:18212;1349;This is definitely DiCaprio's best.
I:18212;1350;He even altered his accent to make it sound like a local and he does this very well.
I:18212;1351;But he also has to play a character with multiple facets and that goes through somewhat of a transformation, and his performance really helps to make this believable.
I:18212;1352;"Jennifer Connely is the one I expected the best from, and she did not disappoint, since she delivers a performance on par to the one she gave us on excellent ""The House of Sand and Fog""."
I:18212;1353;This is definitely one of the best releases of 2006, and if you can stomach the violence I believe you will agree.
I:18212;1354;This movie for me was very powerful and tugged at a lot of my emotions.
I:18212;1355;Djimon Hounsou is a fantastic actor who portrays such pain and fear but also such hope.
I:18212;1356;He makes you feel what he feels.
I:18212;1357;And Leo DiCaprio fit his role exceptionally well as a man who discovers what is really right just unfortunately too late for himself.
I:18212;1358;This movie is heartwrenching and touching at a very deep level.
I:18212;1359;Frankly, Im not the biggest DiCaprio fan, but i really liked him in this, he was very believable as a white Rhodisian, though his accent goes in and out, sometimes it is spot on and other times it is.
I:18212;1360;the movie has a brisk pace and it very violent, but it always felt real and you really want the characters to succeed.
I:18212;1361;The film has an authentic feel, I suppose from the fact it was accually filmed in Africa.
I:18212;1362;Blood Diamond is a political thriller about one of the ugliest industries there is .
I:18212;1363;this is a very powerful film with a very powerful message and one I feel everyone should see.
I:18212;1364;I will definitely NEVER look at any diamond the same way ever again.
I:18212;1365;Blood Diamond had all the suspense and action of a top notch spy thriller.
I:18212;1366;Leonardo di Caprio held on to his South African accent with ease.
I:18212;1367;I was shocked and amazed by the story development.
I:18212;1368;I give it my top rating, and would encourage anyone who enjoys excellent storylines and excellent acting to watch it.
I:18212;1369;it was very believable and the new actor that played the lead was absolutely fantastic.
I:18212;1370;it really brought it to my attention.
I:18212;1371;I would recommend this movie .
I:18212;1372;I've gotten more comfortable admitting that DiCaprio is a good actor.
I:18212;1373;Hounsou is brilliant, and I hope to see him in many more productions.
I:18212;1374;For that reason alone I am glad to see such provocative probing of the western subconscious cast onto the silver screen.
I:18212;1375;That we see this mirror held up in a huge budget Hollywood production is great contradiction, one that I thought of often throughout the film.
I:18212;1376;We really enjoyed the story, learning about the violence, depravity, corruption, and cruelty that goes into the diamond trade.
I:18212;1377;type Director had crafted this movie.
I:18212;1378;"The acting was very good and I don't know how authentic DiCaprio's ""Rhodesian"" accent is, but it's a powerful film, and I do recommend it."
I:18212;1379;a flawed, yet captivating story, that'll make you think twice about the real price of those beautiful diamonds.
I:18212;1380;I personally enjoyed the plot.
I:18212;1381;This surprisingly well done movie shows us a man with ambition in the wild continent of Africa.
I:18212;1382;It makes us appreciate that we are living in a civilized society and leading a happy life.
I:18212;1383;The great thing about this movie is that it contains some very beautiful, spectacular sceneries which match very well with the characters, who are also in some great pursuits.
I:18212;1384;term entertainment, this movie feels very realistic and therefore is very moving.
I:18212;1385;"I give 2 stars mostly for the beautiful African landscapes
I:18212;1386;I also got a kick out of how every tender or thoughtful scene is broken up by 'Splosions!
I:18212;1387;"Another humorous turn is the nice African character who's obviously used up his necessity to the storyline when he declares that Leo and the gang needn't be worried about the child soldiers manning a road block, ""They're just children, let me talk to them!"""
I:18212;1388;acted movie by all involved.
I:18212;1389;The storyline is intense and has one consider the larger ethical issues without shoving this aspect down our throats.
I:18212;1390;this movie succeeds in presenting an illustrative narrative that brings to light a situation that people across the globe are touched by through an intricate web of economic pressures.
I:18212;1391;On a lighter note, DiCaprio and Connelly are a sexy pair and have an unpredictable way of relating.
I:18212;1392;this is a good movie if you want a story with depth and interest.
I:18212;1393;'Blood Diamond' is one of DiCaprios better films and one that leaves you thinking about the issues it explores long after the credits have rolled.
I:18212;1394;All the actors play their roles well and the locations make for some stunning scenery.
I:18212;1395;The issues around blood diamonds are explained pretty well and it'll make you think twice about those innocuous sparkly stones that we see everywhere.
I:18212;1396;As other reviewers have noted, the film is excellent, but the sanitised, saccharine Hollywood ending spoils what is a powerful film, with an important message.
I:18212;1397;Overall though, I'd say this film is well worth watching, it will keep you engaged the whole way through and is well shot and acted.
I:18212;1398;Well performed movie that certainly took a LOT of guts to make.
I:18212;1399;The acting was 90% believable.
I:18212;1400;De Caprio has risen above his normal excellent acting career here.
I:18212;1401;I saw no acting in the movie that wasn't believable and extremely well performed.
I:18212;1402;Watch the movie twice for best understanding.
I:18212;1403;i have a friend with a brother in the jewelry business, and she said once this movie came out, it changed the jewelry business dramatically.
I:18212;1404;torn African country of Sierra Leone, Blood Diamond delivers an adventurous, action.

I:18212;1406;carat diamond, buries it, and is captured and thrown in prison.
I:18212;1407;He also makes a deal with Maddy that if she helps the two men get to their destination, she can write the story she's been longing for.
I:18212;1408;blood Diamond isn't the best film of the year, but it has good performances of the cast, especially Dicaprio and Hounsou who could end up with Oscar nominations for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor respectively, and an insight into a world of sadistic violence and treachery with an ending result of diamonds on people's fingers, which could turn people away from the traditional marriage proposals!RecommendedB.
I:18212;1409;Blood Diamond is a violently epic film, one that takes a cold hard look at the diamond trade and unveils the heinous business that is behind the acquisition of these dazzling coveted stones.
I:18212;1410;enter Maddy Bowen (Connelly), a tenacious and attractive journalist who at first utilizes her physical charisma to charm the facts out of Danny, coming off as just another correspondent hungry for a big story.
I:18212;1411;the film's screenplay from Charles Leavitt (K. pAX) is smart, cynical and emotionally earnest and bases much of its scripted chaos on factual events that Leavitt heavily researched.
I:18212;1412;The desperation to find them and the burning rage against those who ravaged their once happy life are translated beautifully through Hounsou's emphatic eyes and tremulous mouth.
I:18212;1413;connelly proves once again that she is a formidable actress as Maddy, her immense green eyes emoting much of the conviction in her dialogue.
I:18212;1414;diCaprio (nominated for Best Actor) deftly executes a South African accent as well as some indisputably supreme acting skills.
I:18212;1415;opening examination of a dirty business of which few are aware and it is clear from the outcome that it will take more than a simple governmental resolution to stop the murder and sabotage that a small, flashy piece of carbon has managed to create.
I:18212;1416;This movie is emotional, compelling, and informative.
I:18212;1417;Everybody needs to see this movie!
I:18212;1418;I thought this movie was great, and read the book.
I:18212;1419;The book is, of course, more complicated and detailed, but I think the movie does a good job of putting it all together into a format both reasonably accurate and also entertaining.
I:18212;1420;It shows how the diamond trade has affected the life of one man and his family and how a diamond smuggler works this system for his own adventure and the monetary gain of others.
I:18212;1421;blood diamond is one of the first movies to bring awareness to a great conflict and struggle happening unbenknownst to americans and people of many other capitalist countries.
I:18212;1422;it is daring and brilliantly filmed my only complaint is the dialogue and predictable circumstances surrounding the main love interests of the story.
I:18212;1423;if an audience is smart enough to get the point of the movie .
I:18212;1424;The charitable way in which to look at this well.
I:18212;1425;"The parts of the movie that show how kids are scared, brainwashed, and dehumanized by adults posing as their new ""family"" now that their old families are ostensibly dead are chilling and effective."
I:18212;1426;The movie ends with the reunion of Solomon's family in a manner beloved of Hollywood.
I:18212;1427;Honsou can do the dignified simple black African to great effect, so handkerchiefs are required for that reunion scene.
I:18212;1428;It's one of these scenes that are effective, even though it's manipulative.
I:18212;1429;serving man redeemed by the love of a good woman and the example of people who are genuinely noble and selfless.
I:18212;1430;Di Caprio, complete with what sounds like a South African accent, is perfectly effective in what is, for much of the movie, an action.
I:18212;1431;I was surprised at how well he handled the role .
I:18212;1432;The noble exemplar who turns him into a kind of martyr is Solomon.
I:18212;1433;"What I've called the ""Hollywood""."
I:18212;1434;ish elements belong to the world of entertainment and easy sentiment.
I:18212;1435;I give the movie 3.5 stars because I think it means well and isn't just exploitive.
I:18212;1436;Very vividly portrayed and well acted.
I:18212;1437;This movie truly is an eye opener.
I:18212;1438;Even though it is very hard to watch because of all of the killing, it is still a must see movie.
I:18212;1439;Well written and well acted.
I:18212;1440;If you liked his work before, this performance will elevate him further in your esteem.
I:18212;1441;Blood Diamond will dispel them.
I:18212;1442;The story of a civil war in the manufactured African nation of Sierra Leone, the film is nearly an art form of modern power struggles.
I:18212;1443;Solomon is revealed as having found a priceless diamond while he and Archer happen to be in the same gaol.
I:18212;1444;the interaction between the two men, with its added fillip of the white's dependency on the African, is almost serpentine.
I:18212;1445;That delicate role is complicated further when he meets a journalist with a sense of mission.
I:18212;1446;Watching this film the second time with Zwick's commentary on how Jennifer Connelly built the role of Maddy Bowen from accounts of women journalists in war zones is more than just informative.
I:18212;1447;"It gives vivid credence to the wonderful scene where Bowen ""disarms"" a group of threatening rebels with her camera."
I:18212;1448;to reach that point, Zwick and his production team have produced a stunning array of images.
I:18212;1449;From the grandeur of African landscapes in Mozambique, South Africa, Sierra Leone to the intimate close.
I:18212;1450;ups of both major and minor characters, this film is exemplary cinematic drama.
I:18212;1451;Zwick's description of what had to be done to keep the film's impact strong without harm coming to the participants is enlightening.
I:18212;1452;The fate of Solomon and Dia, of Danny Archer, but mostly that of the diamond, are suffused with ironies.
I:18212;1453;It's encouraging that a film such as this could come out of Hollywood instead of a European studio.
I:18212;1454;One can only hope that audiences can cope with it as well.
I:18212;1455;"One of the best movies of 2006, ""Blood Diamond"" combines the action movie with the heart."
I:18212;1456;"films like ""Hotel Rwanda"", ""Dirty Pretty Things"" and ""Rabbitproof Fence"", which feature stories of real."
I:18212;1457;The meld is extremely potent .
I:18212;1458;The stakes seem much higher than in many action movies and have a profound effect on the heart.
I:18212;1459;"In an ordinary movie, any one of these three stars would steal the show, but in ""Blood Diamond"" all three lead players deliver astonishing performances."
I:18212;1460;in terms of production, everything's perfect .
I:18212;1461;the action sequences, the cinematography, the musical score, everything.
I:18212;1462;The lush natural beauty of Sierra Leone is captured amazingly well, and having such breat.
I:18212;1463;taking natural imagery as the backdrop for such a brutal series of events is poignant, to say the least.
I:18212;1464;excellent in every respect, one of the very best picks from a year that was loaded with great movies.
I:18212;1465;This is an impressive and captivating movie experience.
I:18212;1466;the themes of greed, family loyalty, love for country, poverty and war are handled well.
I:18212;1467;although a bit overly long and heavy handed in some thematic areas, this film is very engrossing, well.
I:18212;1468;paced with action sequences, and extraordinarily well.
I:18212;1469;Oscar nominations were abound for this small masterpiece of a film.
I:18212;1470;Where do I even begin to describe this film.
I:18212;1471;Well, first off, we have an incredible cast that features other talents aside from DiCaprio.
I:18212;1472;Houson and Connelly support this film immensely and provide the necessary mood that complements DiCaprio's character.
I:18212;1473;The fact that they can immerse the audience in a seemingly tragic real.
I:18212;1474;life based story is very commendable.
I:18212;1475;This movie is sure to tug on some heart strings and make you feel the pain that actual people have experienced half way around the world.
I:18212;1476;I would highly recommend this film and I thought this was DiCaprio's best film that year (2006).
I:18212;1477;But don't take my word for it, go watch this masterpiece and form your own opinions =)
I:18212;1478;Great movie that gives a dose of reality along with the ruthlessness of those farming diamonds.
I:18212;1479;diCaprio, Connelly, and Hounsou were all excellent in their roles, but it is definitely DiCaprio as the Rhodesian exile that makes this film compelling.
I:18212;1480;Also, the outrageous chase scenes that many movie.
I:18212;1481;DiCaprio's character delivers some lines that give more than lip.
I:18212;1482;Blood diamond is an amazing movie that combines elements of a thriller, drama and world politics all in a potent 2+ hour film.
I:18212;1483;The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat for the entire film but it does deal with disturbing subject matter which is not for everyone.
I:18212;1484;connected and intriguing which is why im happy Leonardo DiCaprio got his Oscar nom for this film.
I:18212;1485;hopefully the film will be successful at the Oscars and then maybe Warner Bros will re.
I:18212;1486;release it to capitalize on the moment.
I:18212;1487;If you havent already seen Blood Diamond, i suggest spending the 8.10 bucks and experiencing the film in a theatre.
I:18212;1488;Great movie and lessons to be learned.
I:18212;1489;The young lad in the movie of yesteryears was gone and I it was nice to see a great performance from Leonardo now very much into his manhood.
I:18212;1490;The talented Jennifer Conolly does a great role too.
I:18212;1491;The little romance that is there between Jennifer and Leonardo is lovely.
I:18212;1492;"The lines spoken by him when he narrates his story to Jennifer was moving, particularly ""."
I:18212;1493;These days he fits into roles like they were made for him.
I:18212;1494;"Nice to also see the villian of ""The Mummy"" series back in this movie."
I:18212;1495;lovely soundtrack to its credit with lots of Afro rythms, sounds and vocals.
I:18212;1496;"Reminds one of the sounds Paul Simon put into his album ""Graceland"" in the 80's."
I:18212;1497;James Newton Howard's background score is beautiful too particularly in the romantic and the sentimental scenes.
I:18212;1498;another observation and one that deserves worthy mention is the audio/sound effects of this movie and whoever was behind this deserves praise.
I:18212;1499;To see unspoilt nature (now being spoilt on a large scale) as it is in Africa was also refreshing.
I:18212;1500;It is about a father's love for his son, which is much more valuable than any diamond.
I:18212;1501;It is about people opening their eyes to suffering and doing something about it.Yes, this movie was in part about bringing the atrocities to light, but it was also about showing that there is always still hope.
I:18212;1502;i still think Leo DiCaprio should have been Oscar nominated and won for his role in The Departed.
I:18212;1503;I got the movie right away in great shape, like new .
I:18212;1504;I love this movie it has a big message to all the people who are nuts over Diamonds and dont know where they come from or who pays with their lives.
I:18212;1505;Leonardo DiCaprio's acting in this, just like anything he's done, is amazing.
I:18212;1506;He really masters the South African accent in this, which I can imagine took a lot of time and effort to perfect.
I:18212;1507;"This movie is so interesting, you don
I:18212;1508;I would recommend this movie to anyone who is obsessed with Leonardo DiCaprio (like me).
I:18212;1509;This account by Edward Zwick leaves a profound impact.
I:18212;1510;Rich guys with stars in their eyes give these stones to their girlfriends.
I:18212;1511;His relationship with a South African mercenary, Danny Archer, forms the principal part of the tale.
I:18212;1512;what comes out brilliantly in this film are the scenes of human torture in the sweltering heat among the diamond mines and how a mercenary and a journalist, Maddy Bowen, help the fisherman reunite with his family.
I:18212;1513;This is one of the best I have seen in recent years.
I:18212;1514;I will rate it AAAA.
I:18212;1515;'Edward Zwick has made a profound statement with this film.
I:18212;1516;Djimon Hounsou is superb as Solomon Vandy.
I:18212;1517;Leonardo di Caprio is outstanding as Danny Archer.
I:18212;1518;I feel that he deserved at least an Oscar so far.
I:18212;1519;He leaves a haunting impression on you in Blood Diamond.
I:18212;1520;It's very intreguing and moving, two human stories with an outcome that will have tremendous impact on our lives today.
I:18212;1521;Give us a thrilling story, good acting, pretty people to look at, and we can get the message out to millions.
I:18212;1522;The action is intense, but like the title of the review states.
I:18212;1523;I enjoyed Glory and The Last Samurai, but not Blood Diamond.
I:18212;1524;It's about the diamond and the whole world is but a stage.
I:18212;1525;It's good to know there are people out there who still care what is happening to people in other countries.
I:18212;1526;loved the acting, loved the script, Loved the movie!
I:18212;1527;The movie was good, but hard to watch.
I:18212;1528;I have never been a `huge' fan of Leonardo DiCaprio.
I:18212;1529;He wants his son to grow up and be a doctor.
I:18212;1530;But Solomon finds a large pink diamond and realizes it will be worth a lot of money.
I:18212;1531;She knows who Danny is and realizes he could be the break she needs for the story.
I:18212;1532;"i have only grazed the surface of the story in Edward Zwick's (""Glory"", ""The Last Samurai"") new film ""Blood Diamond""
I:18212;1533;zwick is a very good director.
I:18212;1534;His films deal with complicated subjects in an exciting way, making them accessible to the masses of people who frequent multiplexes, but also illuminate these subjects, making them interesting to the same people who are taking a break from shopping at the Gap and Abercrombie and Fitch.
I:18212;1535;Because he is able to deal with complicated subjects, and still make the characters interesting and the story accessible, his films are much better for it.
I:18212;1536;"I can't say watching ""Blood Diamond"" is `fun', but it is well."
I:18212;1537;made, exciting and holds your interest.
I:18212;1538;diCaprio has had a very strong year.
I:18212;1539;Everything he does in his life is designed to somehow help him.
I:18212;1540;Danny hasn't had an easy life and this information makes the character all the more interesting and intriguing.
I:18212;1541;As strong as DiCaprio is, Hounsou is better.
I:18212;1542;From the first moments with his son, Hounsou shows us Solomon's dedication to his family.
I:18212;1543;As soon as he sees the revolutionaries speeding towards his village, he knows he has to do something.
I:18212;1544;as soon as Danny enters his life, Solomon knows what he wants, despite what the man tells him.
I:18212;1545;djimon Hounsou has been in some impressive films, but this performance is heads and shoulders above the rest.
I:18212;1546;"Every moment he just exudes the determination we feel in Solomon
I:18212;1547;The most interesting thing about her is that she is certainly no angel either.
I:18212;1548;She is willing to get that information at any cost.
I:18212;1549;She helps Danny and Solomon, seduces Danny, uses her connections to get Solomon some help and more.
I:18212;1550;Because she is willing to go to these lengths, her character is much more interesting.
I:18212;1551;Diamond is filled with some terrific, exciting action scenes.
I:18212;1552;Some of these scenes are so realistic looking it is amazing people weren't harmed during their filming.
I:18212;1553;"but ""Diamond"" also wants to get its message across and Zwick manages this with ease."
I:18212;1554;Because the story keeps moving, and we are kept on our toes, we are entertained by every aspect of the film.
I:18212;1555;In the end, it is much more effective to provide an entertaining message, which will help the audience retain what you are getting across.
I:18212;1556;Blood Diamond is a very good film, featuring great performances from DiCaprio and Hounsou (if he isn't nominated for an Oscar, the awards are meaningless) and presents an entertaining story with memorable facts about one of the less known problems in the world.
I:18212;1557;Probably one of the better roles for DiCaprio.
I:18212;1558;ray is very crisp and clear, showing off the beautiful scenery.
I:18212;1559;Audio is great as well, with bullets whizzing by during the more intense actions scenes.
I:18212;1560;The other reviews have done a much better job that I could with the story review, so I'll leave that to them.
I:18212;1561;Leo does a great job with the accent and goes through the perturbations of emotions throughout the film as he attempts to land a huge score.
I:18212;1562;This is a must watch film!
I:18212;1563;Others have stated it, great movie.
I:18212;1564;Thats pretty much it and that when they first meet a TV is on with the whole Bill Clinton/Monica Lewinsky fiasco going on.
I:18212;1565;I watched a documentary on this conflict before seeing this movie, and I thought it was pretty true to the conflict.
I:18212;1566;I always thought of Leonardo DiCaprio as a bit of a 'twit', as the English say.
I:18212;1567;shouting ending, made it into a 'good' movie.
I:18212;1568;That they managed it to deliver most of them without me wanting to duck every time one of those lines was coming, is a testament to their skill.
I:18212;1569;But in the end it was DiCaprio's sustained characterization.
I:18212;1570;blood Diamond, whose best and most enduring lines were those relating to the acronym 'TIA' (This Is Africa), wears the 'important' label like a General wears his decorations.
I:18212;1571;Does anybody really believe that the true evildoers are the traders, middle.
I:18212;1572;apart from all that, let's look at another message of this movie: the one about the child.
I:18212;1573;soldiers in Africa, and everywhere else, for that matter.
I:18212;1574;ups, the young are the most impressionable and easiest to mold.
I:18212;1575;I believe the age of cerebral maturity is somewhere around the age of 25.
I:18212;1576;The look on the soldier's face as he stared close.
I:18212;1577;soldier he's just stabbed: that will stay with me forever.
I:18212;1578;But what I do remember about it are all scenes involving 'Danny Archer'.
I:18212;1579;which tells me something about the caliber of the actor who represented him.
I:18212;1580;Still, ignoring the gratuitous proselytizing, this was a damn good movie.
I:18212;1581;and thanks to DiCaprio for making it that way.
I:18212;1582;Leonardo Dicaprio was amazing in this movie.
I:18212;1583;Excellent film with an important message.
I:18212;1584;Salomon and Danny consolidate a partnership, with Salomon looking for and finding his son, and Danny looking for the diamond and finding redemption.
I:18212;1585;This movie is a work of amazingly orchestrated chaos.
I:18212;1586;paced thriller with a really provocative theme.
I:18212;1587;A must see, it has every piece of detail that makes this one of the best films out there.
I:18212;1588;I will watch this movie over and over again.
I:18212;1589;"The screenplay of ""Blood Diamond"" may not be the best of the year, but it is certain that the strong performances from the leading stars are one of the greatest in the year 2006."
I:18212;1590;"Like many of the recent films shot in Africa such as ""Hotel Rwanda"" or ""Tsotsi,"" Edward Zwick's film, which is set against the background of the civil war in Sierra Leone back in 1999, has a strong message or two about the present condition of Africa."
I:18212;1591;the strongest part of the film is, as I said, the acting from Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Hounsou, both truly in character.
I:18212;1592;"Jennifer Connelly also appears as journalist Maddy Bowen and Arnold Vosloo as ""Colonel,"" but the film belongs to the two, DiCaprio and Hounsou."
I:18212;1593;"The locations of Africa are also spectacular and realistic with the photography of Eduardo Serra (""Girl with a Pearl Earring""), something you can see nowhere but in this land."
I:18212;1594;"still ""Blood Diamond"" shines with two excellent performances."
I:18212;1595;I usually do not care for DiCaprio but enjoyed both his performance and the overall message of this film.
I:18212;1596;A sobering view into the world of diamond trade just as Nicholas Cage's Lord Of War was a good insight into world of arms trade.
I:18212;1597;for folks who enjoyed Blood Diamond and it's message, please allow me to recommend the similar Salvador by Oliver Stone starring James Woods and Jim Belushi.
I:18212;1598;Overshadowed at the time of it's release by his own Oscar winning Platoon, Salvador is an equally gritty film set in an equally hostile environment with an equally sobering message.
I:18212;1599;DiCaprio's accent in this film sounds pretty accurate.
I:18212;1600;Blood Diamond is a very good drama, probably one of the best about the terrible situation of Africa.
I:18212;1601;Leonardo DiCaprio gets one of his best roles as a young cynical South African, who discovers loyalty, love and conscience.
I:18212;1602;It's noble, brilliant, beautifully written and directed.
I:18212;1603;The suspense of this movie took my breath away and kept my adrenaline pulsing with anticipation.
I:18212;1604;I would highly recommend this movie!
I:18212;1605;It's a very powerful movie about the Diamond trade in Africa which really opened my eyes.
I:18212;1606;You can actually feel the danger and sadness of what is happening in this country as DiCaprio and Hounsou Deliver an absolutely amazing performance.
I:18212;1607;I thought this was a pretty good movie but I also think it was limited and pretty sappy.
I:18212;1608;Leonardo DiCaprio was very good as the young mercenary.
I:18212;1609;Djimon Hounsou has a good look but I don't think he is a very good actor beyond that.
I:18212;1610;But I think it got to be a bit sappy and a bit of a 'feel good' movie.
I:18212;1611;I enjoyed it for the most part but think it was kind of unrealistic in its hollywood feel good 'happy ending'.
I:18212;1612;Yes, there is decent acting.
I:18212;1613;"Blood Diamond is one of those ""Public Awareness"" films that accomplishes its goal without relying on much preaching."
I:18212;1614;In a way you could easily classify Blood Diamond as being a Hotel Rwanda film for audience members who aren't in the mood for pure drama.
I:18212;1615;So instead the issues are mixed into a classy, well thought out action thriller.
I:18212;1616;This contemporary method of informing the public often turns in good films when done right and Blood Diamond does it right.
I:18212;1617;though not the greatest film dealing with conflict in Africa it draws enormous amounts of strength from Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Housou (both earned Academy Award nominations for their roles) who play a mismatched pair that has to work together.
I:18212;1618;a wonderful film with the expert direction of Edward Zwick, Blood Diamond is a good film.
I:18212;1619;regardless, this is a tight film that gets its message across while remaining an engaging, entertaining thriller.
I:18212;1620;DiCaprio and Hounsou were at their very best in each scene.
I:18212;1621;If you already didn't know where diamonds came from, or know the evils of the thinly disguised DeBeers, perhaps this is a movie for you, otherwise steer clear.
I:18212;1622;Wow, after seeing this I just had to recommend it to everybody.
I:18212;1623;The story is riveting and the acting is superb.
I:18212;1624;(especially Djimon Hounsou) This is one of my favorite movies.
I:18212;1625;It was action packed, filled with emotion and passion.
I:18212;1626;it's the brutal and compelling action sequences that will stick with you.
I:18212;1627;Granted, we all have our own unique perspective on something.
I:18212;1628;Leo dicapprio is a great actor
I:18212;1629;It was an incredibly well written screenplay, amazing cinematography, great performances, awesome special effects and a powerful message.
I:18212;1630;"as a story about the ""blood trade"" of diamonds, this movie does a great job of bringing this issue to life for Westerners."
I:18212;1631;even if one is not concerned by the moral, social and political issues that this movie raises, it is equally powerful as a taut action thriller.
I:18212;1632;Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Hounsou give performances that were well worthy of the Oscar nominations that they received.
I:18212;1633;The cinematography was some of the best that I have seen.
I:18212;1634;Often one thinks about this in terms of the sweeping vistas and gorgeous natural beauty.
I:18212;1635;This is definitely a movie that the critics have rated correctly.
I:18212;1636;I am always leary about watching this kind of film, thinking it may just be some hollywood producer with a politcal chip on their shoulders, but this movie is really well done and the performances are great.
I:18212;1637;"i'll be perfectly honest with you, I didn't know anything about this civil war or `blood diamonds' until seeing ""Blood Diamond,"" so the film is successful just by being educational."
I:18212;1638;Regardless, the locations and cinematography are excellent, as is the score.
I:18212;1639;although the story is only moderately engaging and moving, the acting by the principles is great.
I:18212;1640;We are treated to an interesting moral conundrum with Archer.
I:18212;1641;Dicaprio is notable in the role.
I:18212;1642;"But the best character, by far, is the undefiled Solomon
I:18212;1643;fINAL WORD: This is a solid political thriller and educational to boot.
I:18212;1644;This is an excellent film that intertwines personal struggle, questioning of morals, action, and truthful insight into the very controversial existence of blood diamonds.
I:18212;1645;Great actors propel this story throughout the entire film and there are numerous intense scenes!
I:18212;1646;Aside from Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Hounsou's brilliant acting choices, duly rewarded with Oscar nominations, Blood Diamond offers action, adventure, drama, and a political message that is hard to ignore.
I:18212;1647;director Edward Zwick gives his film a clean, produced look without taking away the realism and humanistic punch the story delivers.
I:18212;1648;jennifer Connelly's character leaves something to be desired, but she's still a superb actress and offers a good deal to the story, although her storyline feels a bit contrived towards the end.
I:18212;1649;All I can say is that Blood Diamond presents its message in an effective and moving way, using great special effects, camera work, acting, and scenery.
I:18212;1650;It's a great movie, and you won't want to miss it.
I:18212;1651;This is a movie that will stay with you for a while.
I:18212;1652;What makes this movie so compelling is the wonderful cinematography and excellent acting.
I:18212;1653;We are treated to beautiful scenes of the African coast and countryside, which is then juxtaposed with the violence and bloodshed due to civil strife.
I:18212;1654;Leo Caprio gives one of his [if not THE] best performance of his career.
I:18212;1655;The storyline though moves along at a frenetic pace, and though the movie is quite long at abt 2.5 hrs, it is nevertheless compelling and keeps one glued to the screen.
I:18212;1656;It is historically accurate, and this history has not yet been resolved.
I:18212;1657;It educates, and it opens our hearts to compassion and, one might hope, moves us to make changes.
I:18212;1658;Blood Diamond is about the diamond trade in South Africa.
I:18212;1659;The two are reluctant partners, but eventually develop a bond of trust and deep caring .
I:18212;1660;a bond that leads to heroism and sacrifice.
I:18212;1661;The brainwashing of children to turn them into heartless miniature soldiers is heartbreaking.
I:18212;1662;A father's love conquering all .
I:18212;1663;there is an important lesson here about conflict.
I:18212;1664;diCaprio's role is superbly played, but Hounsou is a stand up and roar performance.
