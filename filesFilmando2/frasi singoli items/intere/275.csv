1;backed 'peace keeping force' joins with a bunch of reactionary rebels.
2;Amazingly, the rebels are right to despise 'western ways' in their desire to cling to 'traditional' beliefs.
3;This film was a bit long, but really quite interesting.
4;While I wouldn't say that Tom Cruise or any of the actors for that matter gave an oscar performance, this film was interesting in the way it contrasted West and EAst.
5;It is through Algren's observations of samurai connection between mind and body that he finally rejects the West and its ways.
6;This film was also interesting in its rich symbolism, and of course I was glad that there was no gratuitous sex scene.
7;A movie with production value like The Last Samurai will never go unnoticed.
8;Especially when it boasts some of the most recognizable names in Hollywood.
9;And The Last Samurai, albeit with some reservation, does manage to stand on its own against the likes of Dances With Wolves and Glory.
10;The Samurai are known for their extraordinary loyalty , honour and fighting skill and there traditional sword, the 'Katana', is considered to be the finest sword in the world.
11;the sudden change in Japan appalls the Samurai, and it is provocation enough to make them turn against there own master.
12;He needs a credible force to defeat the Samurai once and for all.
13;It is during this period that Algren slowly comes to respect his enemy and learns their way of life.
14;And the community in return learns to admire his transformation.
15;slowly but surely, Algren understands the plight of the Samurai and joins their cause, culminating in an epic battle between modernity and honour.
16;The settings are lavish and completely authentic.
17;The costume design is flawless.
18;Though the movie's story does not do justice to the factual events of Japan's history, it is nonetheless interesting.
19;The cinematography is beautiful and the music by Hans Zimmer is exemplary, wonderfully theme oriented.
20;The overall production value will no doubt, keep this movie in the limelight for quite a few years to come.
21;the cast:This movie was supposed to showcase Cruise's acting talent,but it ended up being a Japanese delight.
22;He was really compelling, dignified and totally original.
23;She brings a rare and beautiful screen presence to the movie, not to mention her silent but wonderfully conveyed feelings towards Algren.
24;And she is downright beautiful.
25;Part,if not most of this fault lies with director Edward Zwick too.
26;face basis, TLS will not beat the true originality of DwW.
27;unfortuantely the Producer and the Director themselves were resposible for this movie to reach the level of 'a good.
28;This has to do with the individual themes in the movie than as a whole.
29;Their way of life and honour is extremely interesting and educative.
30;The cinematography and music are the movie's other assets.
31;The main battle scene is utterly realistic and in the end, poignant.
32;at over 21/2 hrs, the movie has a laid back feel to it that will ultimately give you your money's worth.
33;The story is set in 1876 or so at a time of great change in Japan, the forces of modernization fast pacing Japan into the modern age.
34;Some of the extras are very interesting, I liked learning about how things were built or designed.
35;ey for my taste as well.
36;The acting was superb and the movie has gravitas.
37;I will just say that this epic and beautfully written tale leaves you with a whole new respect for what samurais have done for the legend of Japan.
38;tom Cruise is simply phenomenal!
39;This is his best performance on the silver screen by far.
40;As for the fighting, there are many great scenes that range from sword training to being raided by ninjas to the final bloody battle that can stand up to any other ever filmed.
41;Speaking of blood, the special effects are outstanding and the sound is excellent, they really bring the action to life.
42;The anamorphic widescreen format is the icing on the cake.
43;packed with incredible fights and battles, breathtaking cinematography, and violence up the yin.yang(I know that is chinese) The Last Samurai is a must have for any movie fan!
44;One of Tom Cruise's best, I wish he made more films like this!
45;ray my Dad loves it!
46;Much needed movie in today's times.
47;I loved the landscape scenes, the stillness of the village and home, the Taka character so beautifully portrayed, in skilled and sensuous movements.
48;The battle scene with the Samurai Lord and Captain Algren and his men was spectacular.
49;in terms of love: I like the way love was portrayed without the use of sex.
50;I loved the way Taka dressed Algren for battle.
51;Her gentle caresses, his tender kiss and the way she leaned behind and embraced him as she rested her head on his shoulder.
52;To me it was absolutely beautiful, her love given to him at his greatest hour of need, without compromising either of them, in terms of their respect for each other.
53;It made me reflect that was the way a woman should support her man.
54;on the side of peace: The wild cherry blossoms true to Asian tradition, were revered and loved by the noblest of men.
55;The temples were featured in all the brilliant architectural glory.
56;All projecting a meditative mood.
57;It moved me to tears .
58;grand father was a samurai lord of a tiny land in the northern Japan.
59;Very suitable to a Hollywood spectacular.
60;usually, Ken Watanabe uses kimono very wisely to play a noble samurai role with a very elegant and dangerous atmosphere.
61;This traditional dance is an essence of Bushido.
62;The sets of old Yokohama city was excellent.
63;in this movie, Hollywood proved they had capability to create a historical epic set in Japan.
64;and I slit him good.
65;The best acting from Cruise since Magnolia.
66;Great scenery, wonderful actors, especially magnificent Ken Watanabe.
67;A crucial moment in Japan's history, good action, lots of sincere drama.
68;romantics who were mugged by life.
69;When I saw it the first time, I said, I must have that one!
70;The last Samurai is a very good film that falls just short of being great.
71;that should not take away from the fact that it is one of the year's ten best films or that it contains one of the year's better performances in the form of Ken Watanbe, whose portrayal of a loyal Samurai leader is amazing as he draws you in to his world and culture.
72;This film is directed very well by the underrated Edward Zwick and Tom Cruise gives a very good performance.
73;We get the point that this is a big historical epic.
74;clarity of Sound is good, but is mastered at quite a low volume around 10.15db), but is still great.
75;This disc truelly shines, and if you're a fan and want the the BEST possible transfer for home viewing,you won't be dissapointed.
76;ray version but this is still good for the price
77;This is a very good film.
78;I have wathched this movie and must say that it was great, the dialogue was very nicely done and the acting was also okay.
79;when you read some of the reviews of this movie you will wonder.
80;in doing so doesn't that put as above the director and above the story??
81;but it still has some good dramatic content to keep you glued to the screen till the end.
82;to me, this is the best movie for Tom Cruise.
83;And it will be a while till he can do something that is better than this one.
84;It deserves the 5 stars without hesitating.
85;I really enjoyed The Last Samurai, but it's complete bull.
86;I thought it was going to be awful and I only went to see it because my fiance wanted to, but it turned out to be a film well worth watching and owning.
87;The acting (yes, even Tom Cruise) is generally good, the soundtrack stirring, the pacing taut, and the battle sequences awesome.
88;Yes, it's Shogun set later in time and minus Richard Chamberlain, but/and it's excellent.
89;Still, a much better movie than it might seem.
90;"I found Ken Watanabe interesting, in pictures or snippets I had seen, regarding his nomination for Best Supporting Actor, but didn't know anything about him, and I expected the movie to be more similar to the ""Shogun,"" mini."
91;He certainly met the high standards he set quite some time ago.
92;he was intriguing, somewhat mystical, as well as a warrior, a man of honor.
93;Katsumoto, Watanabe's character, was a man who was doing his best to lead his people, and protect their traditions, as best he could, despite the opposition of his Emperor and the people advising him.
94;when the movie was over, both I and my son were left deeply moved by both the story and the wonderful performances of Mr. Watanabe and Mr. Cruise.
95;And I love Hollywood because mostly it's all entertaining.
96;The Last Samurai is entertaining and somewhat historically accurate, but the best thing about this movie to me is the underlying message.
97;The mind, the culture, the beauty of the Japanese(Samurai) mind.
98;One of my all time favorite movies w/special features that show the profound respect the actors/directors have for this ancient culture.
99;One of my Husband's favorite movies!
100;Tom Cruise played a very good role, one of his best!
101;The movie is long but a wonderful movie all should see it highly recommend.
102;Reasonably priced also best bargain for your buck.
103;One of my all time favorites.
104;Arrived early in great condition.
105;The Last Samurai is entertaining.
106;i got involved with the characters and wanted everything to turn out well.
107;the action sequences are well done.
108;the acting is well done.
109;The production on this film was very well done, the battle scenes were great and the hand to hand fighting (although a small part of the film) reminded me of some of the better kung fu type action flicks I remembered as a kid.
110;"In Alan Colmes' book on liberalism he talks about how liberals are better because they are progressive and being progressive and moving foward are better qualities and it is the ""better"" people that think progress."
111;i bring the topic up because in this flick the ideal of being a Samurai is so romanticized and the ideal of Americanism is so bashed that it takes away any kind of serious nature the film might have had in an historical sense.
112;tHE LAST SAMURAI is simply a beautiful story about a man who is able to see the best in his enemies.
113;If you watch and enjoy this movie for nothing more than the beauty of Japan and the wonderful way that the makers of this movie put it on the screen you will be richly rewarded.
114;supporting Cruise, Ken Watanabe is superb in his role as the Samurai chieftain, Katsumoto, and Hiroyuki Sanada is a scene.
115;Yes, it has action in it (amazing battle scenes), however it's central theme has to deal with honor, the loss of it, and the loss of a way of life in exchange for a more modern society.
116;On the one hand you have the Japanese civilization in the middle of adopting a more Western style of living, and on the other you have the Samurai, more than willing to die fighting to keep Japanese tradition alive.
117;No offense to Tom Cruise since he was impressive in doing all of his own sword work.
118;Tom Cruise is excellent as a brooding US Army captain who is an alcoholic constantly haunted by his past.
119;Cruise gets captured and slowly comes to realize he's been on the wrong side in a journey of self recovery and honor.
120;round with some excellent action scenes.
121;Some nice cameos from not least Billy Connolly, and a very moving and thought provoking movie.
122;the director of this movie is best known for directing the classic Civil War epic Glory.
123;This movie shows a lot of similar aspects of Glory.
124;He is told he needs to take his army into battle, their superior weapons will help ensure victory.
125;He is kept alive because the samurai leader, Katsumoto, is interested in this fierce fighter, and wants to learn of his enemy.
126;this was a well acted, well shot, and engaging.
127;The important part is how it is carried out.
128;this movie has well choreographed action sequences.
129;They humanized so that you relate with them, but are still their own people.
130;There is a discussion where they talk of Custer's last stand, one that we look at with embarassment.
131;Katsumoto on the other hand is impressed with their bravery and thinks they died a good death.
132;Dying in combat against incredible odds was not only brave to him, but honorable.
133;He isn't at the level of Sean Connery or George Clooney, but he is competent and believable in this role.
134;all in all this is a well made and entertaining film.
135;There should be elements for all types, so it would be a good date movie.
136;Action to keep guys interested, and complicated romantic elements that will entertain the women.
137;It doesn't reach the same levels as Gladiator or Braveheart, but it is worth the price of admission.
138;As well as being a treat for those who love asian culture.
139;I'm a big fan a Japanese period movies.
140;If you were born into a certain class you remained in that class until you died.
141;The development of the movie at the beginning was good, the first battle scene being very good, actually.
142;I would have liked to have seen a lot more detail about his assimilation and the family that took him in.
143;"The ""heart"" of the movie was moving, and it has an ending that stuns the viewer."
144;I'm sure it's not the most historically accurate portrayal but it does a nice job of conveying the culture and time.
145;well, it may not be new, but it works.
146;This has a lot to do with the breathtaking camera work .
147;, the visual impact of the movie is stunning.
148;The story of a renegade samurai leader's fight to uphold his and his men's honor in the distinctly samurai fashion meshes well with the visuals of the movie, and the battles are well choreographed, if a little far.
149;in all fairness, Edward Zwick has come with a pretty good, mainstream movie.
150;It has enough adventure to supply goose.
151;The Japanese cast comes up with sterling performances, and provide a lot of authenticity to some of the interpretations of honor, duty and respect provided by the movie.
152;overall, this is a movie that will catch your attention at first viewing.
153;I enjoyed the Last Samurai.
154;ken Watanabe delivers a phenomenal performance as Katsumoto.
155;very entertaining as a whole, although people expecting a Braveheart level of action may be disappointed, as the battles are perforated with quieter moments of plot development and character insight.
156;Unable to keep a job, he decides to accept an offer from a Japanese noble.
157;While in Katsumoto's village, Algren begins to discover many admirable qualities of the Samurai, including their discipline, their loyalty, and most importantly for Algren, their serenity.
158;"this was a great film
159;THAT'S how funny this movie is.
160;Props to Eddie Zwick for making what will likely go down as the greatest comedy of this generation.
161;was one of the movies I have seen so many times from 2005.2009 that I found myself able to practically recite the entire movie by memory despite not having viewed it since then.
162;Now that I'm a bit more mature, however, I find enjoyment in the more subtle, underlying themes, and the Native American backstory of the protagonist.
163;This movie is really good.
164;A drunkard and actually a warrior seeking some means of relief from his tormenting dreams and conscience.
165;The script was well written and the acting was well done.
166;its also the emotional bond between each charecter.
167;Ken Wantanbe and Tom Cruise were excellent and yes 'Taka' the sweet and beautifull sister of Wantanbe, how could I ever forget her.
168;The film's tone, mood, action, acting, directing, sets, and scenes (especially the exteriors) were magnificent!!!
169;This is a movie with a heart, and Tom's gradual transformation.
170;You'll want to see it many times, as each viewing shows you how very much more there is than when you saw it earlier.
171;In his first encounter against the Samurai, Algren is captured by Katsumoto, played brilliantly by Ken Watanabe.
172;He quickly is impressed by the Samurai's skills in battle and unexpectedly drawn to their way of life while in captivity.
173;Ultimately, he finds himself at Katsumoto's side, driven by his sense of honor.
174;this is a great film and probably Tom Cruise's best.
175;It is beautifully written and acted.
176;It is also loaded with brilliant cinematography and amazing battle choreography.
177;An epic and worth mentioning with such great films like Gladiator and Braveheart!
178;nOW FOR MY BLU RAY THOUGHTS: A very nice transfer that enhances all the beauty of Japan's landscape.
179;All the special features are carried over.
180;Awesome scenery, action packed great story.
181;A small glimpse into how society evolves from traditional times to a more modern era.
182;First off, let me state that this is an enjoyable film to watch.
183;It is entertaining and truly worth a watch.
184;The Samurai in the end are pretty much props.
185;the action scenes are fun to watch (though Kill Bill's got this one beat) and fantasize a bit about such an idyllic life.
186;by the way, The Gods Must Be Crazy covers this ground (what happens when two cultures collide) with a more comical, intelligent and subversive spin.
187;Very well made movie not sure about the messagge.
188;I really enjoyed this movie.
189;So I will be brief:This is a film for all those (and judging by my reading of Amazon reviews: they are legion) who loathe America and love a romanticized and fictitious culture peopled with wise and far nobler folks than we crass capitalists.
190;But it has a vast and gullible audience that eats it up.
191;every culture and all people everywhere have their glories, delights, and their failings and shames.
192;It looks pretty, it was well.
193;made, the art direction was fine, and the performances were tolerable.
194;I am not sure how accurate the history was but we enjoyed learning a bit about Japan's culture and past.
195;Great story,Great casting,Great acting,Great Cinematography,Great price to own this movieYou should view this productionBoyd
196;He said lets see it again.
197;The Last SAmurai is one of the greatest movies I have seen.
198;Tom Cruise plays an award winning preformance.
199;Eventually Tom Cruise will have a chnage of heart and follow the ways of the samuria.
200;Throught the movie audiaunce laughed many times.
201;And im sure some cryed , because the movie simply touched my heart.
202;Do yourself a favor and go see the Last Samurai and you will recognize that it ranks empiral among other war movies.
203;Zwick makes a smart decision to focus on the story while walking the delicate middle ground of the setting and characters.
204;But if we suspend out disbelief just a little, what we get is a mesmerizing, and powerful story about a man who reminds the Japanese of who they are.
205;all the acting performances in this film are top notch, and I wouldn't be surprised if Watanabe was nominated for an Oscar.
206;He's such a huge mega.
207;the Last Samurai is a breathtakingly beautiful film that is sure to land cinematography nominations.
208;while the story is not perfect, and we are forced to endure a few cheesy moments of Algren, it is undeniably powerful and moving.
209;This is an interesting role for tom Cruise.
210;Many times, you'll see him playing himself in films .
211;the story in the film is touching and ironic, and is respectful of all the cultures represented within it.
212;The last Samuri is the man Tom Cruise's character is captured by, whom he develops a respect for and odd sort of captor.
213;there are battle scenes and fights aplenty for the action driven, a forbidden and unspoken atraction, and gorgeous scenery caught by the camera in lovely detail.
214;Cruise is a drunk American soldier fresh from the Indian wars, shellshocked and consumed by memory.
215;The acting was excellent all around, though I had trouble believing Cruise as a Civil War veteran"
216;Watanabe did a terrific job, for which he received multiple nominations as Supporting Actor, and everyone else was great, as was the direction (Edward Zwick) and cinematography.
217;The film can be heard in English or French, and subtitled in English, French or Spanish.You will probably like this if you enjoy historical films, Tom Cruise or samurai films.
218;ray is so much better.
219;All the action scenes look so real, almost like you are there.
220;As a Japanese living in the United Staes, I can say totally, that this film is amazing.
221;The commentary was good though.
222;Its got a good story behind it, with some level of historical basis behind it with Samurai becoming phased out into Japan's modernization.
223;it does a good job in immersing you into the conflicts that warriors must endure.
224;A very strong movie despite historical inaccurateness and a Hollywood ending.
225;Even though I knew when I was watching this film that the historical portrayal was inaccurate, I still found the movie a very entertaining story.
226;I was very pleasantly surprised by this movie.
227;As does the great support acting from Ken Watanabe!
228;And the other Samurai characters are developed enough in the plot that you do care what happens to them and feel sad when they die.
229;Having seen the film I hav to say I was pleasantly surprised.
230;what I will say is that the cinematography of this film was breathtaking.
231;The scenes of rural Japan were gorgeous.
232;His presence on screen was commanding and his ability to be stern and understanding really worked.
233;"overall ""the last samurai"" was a fantastic film with great acting and some great imagery."
234;Brutal, yet sweet and moving.
235;The love story in the background showed how mankind's hard edges are softened by love, no matter how subtle and restrained.
236;This is a tear jerker movie with excellent acting.
237;The production is full ofexcellent photography and lots of action.
238;The Last Samurai is a fine example of regard for another culture taken to such a superficial extreme that the result is smelly cardboard.
239;"In ""The Last Samurai"", not only does the white hero receive an oriental spiritual transplant
240;had this film truly honoured Japanese culture with the respect it professes to feel, the white hero would have died or at least turned out to be less than God's gift to Japan.
241;The performances by Ken Watanabe and Hiroyuki Sanada are superb and they do wonders within its shallow arc.
242;But even good performances cannot save this film from the consequences of its presumption.
243;There is good and ill in every social framework, and unlike a Costner film that shall remain unnamed, Samurai doesn't preach such a dogma.
244;instead, the film lifts you above it, and illustrates a fundamental truth of the human condition.
245;It does not blunt us over by our shortsightedness"
246;Our pleasure, our pain, our trials and struggles.
247;They establish who we are, and how we lived, and if at least one person remembers that, then we shall find life again.
248;While not entirely historically correct, and not without it's grandiose notions of good and evil evident in a traditional epic of scope, what The Last Samurai does is remind us of that greater truth, the greater potential inside each and every one of us.
249;"And, if one looks carefully enough as the light fades in Autumn, one will see that each and every petal is indeed ""perfect."""
250;I saw this on the 'big' screen and, it was just as entertaining the second time on a 46 home tele.
251;Great acting with well developed characters.
252;Always liked the story, sprinkled with some history about a by.
253;gone era marked by epic battles between the old and new guard.
254;If you're familiar with / liked the TV series Kung Fu, then you'll enjoy this movie.
255;ray shows well on my high def system as well.
256;This is a Good movie, One of tom Cruises best roles.
257;samurai senses in flux, he proceeds to slice and dice his enemies.
258;The whole thing struck me as, to be honest, sorta amusing.
259;And, eventually, he's able to battle alongside the samurai general against a band of the emperor's invading ninjas.
260;All this in less than six months!That said, THE LAST SAMURAI is an entertaining, beautiful.
261;But the supporting actors, particularly Ken Watanabe as the samurai general Katsumoto, are uniformly terrific in it, and they make Cruise look better and less wooden in each progressing scene.
262;ish ending to the film.
263;but it's fun, for the most part.
264;It's not going to win an Oscar, except maybe for Watanabe's supporting work, but it's a fun film.
265;other than that, it was a pretty good film.
266;Algren ends up becoming a prisoner of the Samurai, but after spending a number of months as their captive, subsequently finds peace in their way of life.
267;not only is the plot interesting and original, but the performances of the actors are nothing short of amazing.
268;Tom Cruise puts forth an outstanding effort, which I consider his best ever.
269;Ken Watanabe is perfect as Katsumoto, commanding even more attention than Cruise, and all of the secondary characters are equally convincing in their roles.
270;the execution of the battle scenes was excellent.
271;This can be attributed to a cast full of professional sword.
272;There are a few lines in the script that come across as slightly bland or predictable, but overall the script is very well written.
273;Tom Cruise actually speaks Japanese in a handful of scenes, and he does it well.
274;what really makes the movie, on top of everything else, is the beautiful score composed by Hans Zimmer.
275;Though he often recycles his scores and changes them very little, this one is unique and powerful.
276;There is also a handful of interviews and a look at the real history of the decline of the Samurai in Japan.
277;all in all, The Last Samurai is an extremely entertaining and convincing film.
278;I received quickly and at a price I was happy with.
279;I rank this movie right up there with Braveheart and Gladiator as far as epics go.
280;"At first I thought this was going to be one of those ""face time"" movies just to get a paycheck for Tom Cruise, but to my suprise it was a great movie."
281;"this is one of the best movies to come out in the last couple of years and a breath of fresh air compared to those movies like Master and Commander that claimed to be action movies but were really just ""face time"" for their leading man."
282;A great movie that will keep you entertained to the end.
283;I really enjoyed this movie and think it is definitely one worth owning if you enjoy movies like Dances with Wolves.
284;I walked out of the theater very, very, very satisfied with the movie.
285;This movie keeps it realistic.
286;The captain gets captured and taken to a place with many Samurai.
287;At first, he's their enemy.
288;But I can tell you this much: go see this movie.
289;My brother thinks of this as one of the best movies ever.
290;I thought it was pretty good, but I sent it to him for a what the heck gift, and it was worth it to make him happy.
291;The Last Samauri is a good movie, beautifully filmed and well acted, yet it really does nothing to make it stand apart.
292;The best part of the film is the hour or so that Cruise spends living with the Samurais.
293;He lives with the family of the man he killed and the kids grow to like him and the beautiful wife learns to accept him.
294;the Last Samurai seems like a Japanese version of Braveheart, with epic battles and valiant characters.
295;It doesn't break any new ground in the epic battle genre, but it is still fun to watch.
296;the transfer is perfect .
297;Boy was I surprised at how good this movie was.
298;It makes you feel for the Samurai and it is just a moving story all together.
299;I don't recall seeing Ken Watanabe(Samurai's leader) in any other movie but believe me he steals the show in this one.
300;Great job by Tom Cruise, his best movie in awhile.
301;Trust me on this one you will be pleasantly surprised at how good of a movie this is.
302;He plays the tormented captain with surprising intelligence and conviction.
303;I was very impressed to see him speaking Japanese .
304;I loved the way this film mixed both English and Japanese toghether because it gave it a strong edge.
305;He played Katsumoto with such a commanding and intense presence that it was hard to concentrate on Cruise or any other actor in the film.
306;Without doubt deserves the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.
307;As supporting roles, they both acted convincingly without saying much but succeeded in showing that there are many more interesting characters besides Algren and Katsumoto.
308;great music score by Hans Zimmer and fantastic costume design that will not doubt trigger a trend in Samurai.
309;Tom Cruise amazing as was Ken Wantanabe (sp).
310;Also Hiroyuki Sanada was in the movie and he was excellent.
311;Great to see him in a variety of movies.
312;It is one of the best with Tom cruise.
313;This is one that will watch more than once.
314;Although Kubrick was certainly a bit twisted himself and some of his later films showed it, this early film is a success.
315;Tom Cruise's best feature thus far, cleverly written story, great acting.
316;A classic story focusing on the complexities taking place at the end of the samurai era.
317;but this film is a great exception, as his performance is very sincere and he seems completely immersed in the character of Nathan Algren, the Westerner who slowly but surely comes to understand and appreciate (and even identify with) the Japanese concept of `bushido' = code/ philosophical underpinnings of the Samurai.
318;this film does a worthy job introducing the uninitiated to the fascinating (but difficult to fully comprehend) intriguing but often deadly culture of the Samurai ==> discipline, Loyalty, selflessness, honor .
319;inspired `meditative serenity and contemplation' vs. `predisposition for blood.
320;drenched battle'There are a number of scenes in this perceptive film that effectively express this intriguing paradox.
321;`The Last Samurai' is a truly unique and impressive film by director Edward Zwick, with a great Japanese cast in addition to Cruise: including Ken Watanabe and Hiroyuki Sanada.
322;This is a good companion film to the other insightful Hollywood interpretation of the `bushido' code concept = Sidney Pollack's 1974 film called `The Yakuza' (much more interesting and insightful than the overly simplistic title would suggest!)
323;Conclusion: Edward Zwick has displayed himself in the past as a true patriot.
324;Just look at the protagonists in his films, striving for independence, justice and honor: Denzel Washington's characters in 'Courage Under Fire' and 'The Siege', or Matt Broderick in 'Glory'.
325;This is a star performance, and never for a second is Tom anyone but Tom .
326;The film follows a simple structure: Cruise as American .
327;Watch Kurosawa's classics instead .
328;even Jim Jarmusch' 'Ghost Dog' has a more authentic samurai feel than this degrading feature.
329;The movie is romantic and fanciful.
330;The fighting scenes are dead on and actually quite beautiful.
331;By far though the star of this movie is Ken Watanabe.
332;Rolling in late December 2003, this movie surprised me a great deal.
333;This is definitely one of Tom Cruise's best outings.
334;One of his most emotional performances is given here.
335;The landscape of the movie is beautiful, and Hans Zimmer's score plays gloriously in the background.
336;the movie really makes you eventually hate the modern enemy of a modernized Japan, with a fully.
337;out war between the samurai and the new Japan and it is an incredible scene when these two go at it, definitely one of my favorite movie war scenes of all.
338;definitely a very powerful, albeit a bit fictitious, film.
339;after saying that this is a good performance for him.
340;While the plot is fairly predictable I think it is an interesting look into a historical time period.
341;I would recommend the film to anyone who loves history.
342;This is my favorite non.
343;trilogy movie (RotK is actually my truly favorite), and while I respect anyone who loves this movie and gives it 5 stars, I must say that none of these reviews gives this movie any justice!
344;there's a lot more to it than that!
345;What captivated me and all my friends (17 .
346;he lives in the house and is cared for by the Red Samurai's widow.
347;Tom Cruise sees the beauty of the Samurai people and understands the honor and respect and culture and discipline of these people and realizes they are not the enemy!
348;He learns a lot from these people and earns their respect in many ways!
349;Beautiful movie in every way!
350;The battles are a very small part in the greatness of this movie!
351;The Samurai are a beautiful people!
352;By far this is the best movie that I've seen in a long while.
353;Not only does it depict strong issues about honor, trust, integrity, values, sound morals, lodyalt, duty, and respect, but it also shows a deeper sense of love and loving than I've seen ages.
354;That was a wonderful departure from the norm.
355;This is a great movie.
356;I thought this is a well.
357;I thought Cruise did a great job.
358;I didn't see any of the reckless grinning that he known for, and he did a great portrayal of a disillusioned but fierce and loyal soldier.
359;This was a great fantasy film about a time of great change in Japan.
360;And the love scenes were well crafted, no obligatory sex scene (thats absolutely impossible for a gaijin and nihonjin in that time period!!!)
361;"minded ""message"" movie without the courage of his own convictions."
362;Tom Cruise's heart is obviously in the right place.
363;He gives an incredibly earnest performance.
364;important for attaching himself to such an important film.
365;"It's yet one more movie in which the creators give the audience not one single amount of credit for having a brain
366;Great cast and acting and truly excellent premiss.
367;There's something about Zen and Samurai that I enjoy.
368;They kick butt in this movie!Tom Cruise is a very crappy actor these days but I think this has been his best performance in a long time.
369;He conquers his alcohol addiction and learns the way of the Samurai warrior.
370;this tale is very touching because of the Zen way of life the Samurai have.
371;He killed one of their own, and then is accepted as one of them and fights along side of them to prove themselves worthy of their honor.
372;You may think I am joking but Honestly, I enjoyed this movie from start to finish.
373;this movie tells a good story with well paced action scenes.
374;Beautifully photographed and with a very nice music score throughout.
375;It is rare that movies with historical perspectives can capture all three sides of a conflict so accurately.
376;As anyone who's studied Japanese history can tell you, the conflict herein was almost perfectly portrayed on all levels"
377;And while he comes out on top, and stronger for it, he is now alone in his new world because those who got him to it have been slaughtered around him.
378;It IS historically accurate (no matter what anybody tells you, take it from someone who used to live in Japan and has studied Japanese history for 13 years), it is worth watching, and it was far more oscar.
379;"worthy than that abortion of a film about Japan ""Lost in Translation."""
380;a very enjoyable film with captivating visuals (the filmmakers deserve much credit for filming in actual authentic locations) and powerful, realistic fight scenes.
381;There is so much here to enjoy.
382;This movie was excellant and byfar the best I had seen all year.
383;This movie had a great story brillant battle scenes.
384;In the process he is captured in battle and exposed to the samurai way of life which he ultimately embraces.
385;An intriguing look into this arcane culture.
386;But it's Ken Watanabe's razor.
387;sharp performance and Koyuki's stunning elegance that steal the show.
388;This movie shuffled along the line between action movie and epic story, and it kept a somewhat uneasy balance between those two styles.
389;It was beautifully, if obviously, shot, capturing both majestic landscapes and gorgeous detail, and the acting, for the most part, was very good.
390;Ken Watanabe deserves all the praise he has received for the role, and Koyuki performed very subtly and ably as the quasi.
391;The scenes with the young emperor were perhaps the most moving of the entire film, and there was enough attention paid to the individual lives contained in the story without forgetting the big picture, so to speak.
392;One of the best Tom Cruise movies I've ever seen.
393;This is truly an incredible film.
394;the direction is poetic and confident.
395;Cruise is serviceable, but not memorable.
396;The real steal in the film is the acting by Ken Watanabe.
397;His character really moves and enlightens you.
398;There's an effortless grace that he posesses.
399;i would recommend this film to anyone who likes sweeping epic dramas.
400;He really is a talanted actor and all his movies are worth watching, I watches this already three times.
401;I am a high school student that is in love with the samurai.
402;Tom Cruise gets a new outlook on life when he meets the samurai and finds something he loves.
403;wow, this movie was great.
404;im serious, everyone should watch this movie.
405;It's about Tom Cruise, he starts to train a Japanese army and then during a battle between his troop and the saumrai he killed a samurai and then he is taken prisoner with the samurai but they are kind to him and stuff.
406;well eventually, he makes friends and what not with the samurai and he goes to battle on their side.
407;it was just so beautiful.
408;and i laughed at some of tom's lines.
409;he really isnt such a bad actor nd this is by far his best movie yet.
410;my best friend is asain and she cryed and loved the movie!
411;i'd be proud that soeone survived and passed on the legacy of my people.
412;every part was beautiful and filled with depth and emotion.
413;didnt u see the tension!
414;anyone who loves historical movies, action movies, funny movies, dramas, or any kind of movie at all.
415;"century Japan is convincing
416;While this movie was quite long, and long winded in some parts, it is still a terrific movie played by some terrific actors.
417;tom Cruise's Nathan was a great character in this story and was one you really wanted to pull for.
418;And the lord he grew to respect and become great friends with, Katsumoto, was played brilliantly by Watanabe.
419;the action scenes and scenary in general was beautiful in this movie.
420;Thats why this is a 4 on my scale.
421;I'm sure he'll love to own it.
422;There aren't that many movies set in late 19th century Japan, so top marks to director Edward Zwick for originality of setting.
423;the battle sequences are undeniably spectacular, and the sets, costumes and audio are always first rate.
424;I very much enjoyed Timothy Spall's support role, and Watanabe was convincingly stoic.
425;The Last Samurai is clearly Tom Cruise's best film to date.
426;after being captured by the Samurai and their leader Katsumoto, played skillfully by Ken Watanabe he soon learns what the meaning of the word honor is.
427;He also develops a romance with Taka, who besides being the sister of Katsumoto is also the very widow a Samurai Warrior that Algren killed.
428;in this movie you see some great scenery, and of course great action scenes.
429;There is also a solid storyline and you really get to know the characters in this movie.
430;The costuming was terrific and the weapons such as the swords were very authentic looking.
431;The Last Samurai is a breathtaking, historical, panorama that examines the blending of cultures and the clash of competing value systems.
432;In this film, Tom Cruise plays Nathan Algren a twelve year old boy who has moved from New Jersey to the California Coast with his single mom.
433;boyfriend is the star pupil and the instructor is a sadist.
434;A great film that in any other year would've been a serious oscar contender.
435;Tom cruise Delivers a brilliant performance along with ken watanabe.
436;A truly entertaining, emotional masterpiece.
437;Go and see the movie, and take it for what it is, and outstanding piece of cinema
438;actually, the Japanese samurai were an oppressor class in their own right.
439;Avoid it like the plague.
440;Teenager level movie, well built, simple, predictable but watchable.
441;Amazon streaming does a fantastic job, never had a buffering issue.
442;A strange friendship grows up between him and Katsumoto, and Algren also finds himself attracted to his host's sister, whose husband he killed in the battle.
443;algren isn't always a likeable character, but he's very human and comprehensible, and Cruise portrays with sensitivity and believability his slow conversion to the Samuari cause.
444;Hans Zimmer's thunderous scoreThe Last Samuraiand the excellently choreographed duel and battle scenes are pluses, and while the movie is rated R for violence, discreet and creative camerawork prevents any really shocking or disgusting sequences.
445;This """"romantic vision of a lost world,"""" as Time Magazine called it, will impress you and stay with you."""
446;I think tom cruise sucks but this movie he is great!
447;"When Edward Zwick made ""Glory"" in 1989, I thought it was the start of a career that would bring us many fantastic films."
448;"Looking back, while I still consider ""Glory"" one of the best modern."
449;day historical pieces in cinema, I realize that I probably overrated it and an accurate production design, a top notch score, and superb performances by actors who were relatively unknown at the time such as Denzell Washington and Morgan Freeman probably boosted it more than anything.
450;The man does have some talent and sure does make a pretty picture, but when you take into account the screenplay, the characters, the ending.
451;hour movie, but make sure the screenplay deserves that amount of time!
452;"Make no doubt, ""The Last Samurai"" is a sweeping, well."
453;produced epic that is immensely entertaining.
454;Several battle sequences, especially early in the film when Tom Cruise's character is surrounded by armored samurai, are tremendously exciting.
455;I also appreciate Hollywood's recreation of actual events in Japanese history involving samurai warrior Saigo Takamori during the 1870s.
456;"Film director Edward Zwick (who also brought us the superior epic ""Glory,"" which did not have a tacked on Hollywood ending) details throughout this film that this band of colorful and fluffy samurai warriors, the last of their kind, are headed for a Charge of the Light Brigade type conclusion."
457;Tom Cruise gives a good performance as a former captain in the U. s. Army.
458;During his first encounter with a samurai rebel force, his men flee and he is captured.
459;Along his symbolic journey, Cruise bonds with the warrior's leader, wonderfully played by American newcomer Ken Watanabe.
460;"great filmmaker Akira Kurosawa, who produced brilliant samurai epics during his day including ""The Seven Samurai,"" ""Ran"" and ""Kagemusha."""
461;Kurosawa touches are evident throughout, and the film does not suffer for it.
462;This is a movie that is great and which exceeds beyond movie limits.
463;It has action, a great plot, and great actors.
464;Tom Cruise does a great job.
465;"But this movie is a stellar example of one where the ""star"" is just one part of a much bigger picture."
466;The scene where Cruise's female caretaker sends him off to fight was perfectly done.
467;"I figured, at the least, Samurai are interesting to watch
468;gobs of money were spent on the finest talent, set design, musical production, and effects.
469;This movie is beautiful to look at and interesting to watch.
470;the Samurai, as cool as they were, were dead meat.
471;The whole purpose of a Samurai is to defend their masters (typically the ruling class).
472;well, the Emperor needed to modernize Japan.
473;This revives it and exposes people to the Japanese culture.
474;Being able to turn back the clock and achieve this level of realism and show the lost pride of the Japanese is an amazing feat.
475;Cruise is at his best in this movie surrounded by talented Japanese actors.
476;Ken Watanabe is simply brilliant.
477;Now i know im a sappy person, but to me this movie was packed with emotion and drama, and was the best movie I'd seen in quite a while.
478;This movie is well worth your while even tho it is similiar to Dances with wolves.
479;Good movie with a great storyline!!!
480;Tom Cruise did a wonderful job in this movie.
481;This movie is one of my favorites very entertaining.
482;I wanted a personal copy so that I could turn on the subtitles and be able to follow along during the Japanese dialog.
483;But within 20mins I was riveted to the screen.
484;ken Wantanabe is a superb actor.
485;Katsumoto is the sort of leader whom rules with a firm yet honorable and compassionate fist.
486;His faiths and beliefs are rendered beautifully for the viewer yet does not bash you over the head.
487;You easily accept and believe his convictions.
488;The first scene when the troops engage with the Samurai is phenomenal and will surely send a chill up you spine as you hear Samurai battle cry through the morning fog.
489;and the final battle scene will have your heart beating at top speed and I assure that you will ask yourself.
490;And lastly the love interest.
491;All I will say is that it is handled in a very graceful manner.
492;i am please that I had the chance to see this movie and it has prompted my interest in the code of the Samurai which is called Bushido for """"way of the warrior""""."""
493;For that I thank all involved.
494;One of the most awesome movies ever.
495;It gives hope that people who start as enmities can become family.
496;Congratulations Ton Cruise you have finally made a film I can watch without wanting to punch you in the middle of your smug face, you took a back seat for once and let more talented actors have the stage.
497;It is superbly well made, visually stunning and very moving.
498;Koyuki and uijo were deeply impressive as was katsumoto.
499;I have to say that I feel this is Tom's best film.
500;It has so many emotions involved.
501;A definite must see !
502;This is an excellent movie, and the blu.
503;ray edition does it justice.
504;This movie was a beautiful, emotional journey.
505;Good action, good acting, wonderful story, and a top.
506;But he is a great actor and this movie was so well done.
507;This is one of my favorite movies.
508;how much better can it get.
509;maybe I just didn't read all the info, I received the downloadable verision with it so I can watch on my next long flight.
510;This turned out to be one of the best films I have ever seen.
511;I knew this film could easily be misunderstood, and whereas I had doubts myself in the beginning, after watching it they had all but removed and I was in love with it.
512;As with all good films, this one had picked the right people to play the characters.
513;It smartly blends in the flares and drama in both American and Japanese cultures and anyone who can appreciate both cultures can easily testify to great illustration of both.
514;The film could easily be misunderstood for a few reasons: 1.
515;"as most movies are strictly fictional, the fact that this is actually ""based on a significant historical event"" is of great educational value."
516;having some understanding and appreciation of the Japanese culture before viewing this, have to say that this illustration of the Japanese culture was absolutely true and beautiful.
517;plots to actually allow the audience to breathe and smile at times amist the serious storyline of a part of a nation's tradition becoming extinct.
518;The balance in the movie was very well done.
519;Tom Cruise's character's integration into a part of Japanese culture itself is a success story.
520;It did so through respect, appreciation, camaraderie, and deep feelings.
521;other than that, as a movie, the cinematography, the music and sound, the the historical illustrations, the traspassing of two cultures that in most people's eyes are largely incompatible, the entertaining value, should make this one of the top movies ever had.
522;this is highly recommended, and even if certain things in the movie may seem strange at first, it is definitely worth watching.
523;This film was successful in many ways, communicating the message that basic human values, Samurai values .
524;honour, loyalty, courage, discipline and the essence of service, one's basic duty to one's family, the clan and one's country, holds more value than technological advances.
525;as has been mentioned many times, the true star of this picture is Ken Watanabe, as the Lord of the clan he displays all the virtues of the Samurai without having to utter a word.
526;This actor has great presence, and for me, made this picture worthwhile.
527;Japan's simplistic beauty in architecture, landscape and period costumes appear to be accurate and very beautiful.
528;As a period piece, my feeling is that they captured the atmosphere of the time, making the film a pleasure to view.
529;the Last Samurai does capture the basic philosophy of the Samurai warrior and does so with great respect.
530;This alone is worth the price of admission.
531;This is easily one of my favorite movies of all time.
532;Japanese purists will find plenty to take offense to, but for the uninitiated this is a unique, beautiful insight to the world that once was, but no longer is.
533;Tom Cruise and the entire cast did a fantastic job of bringing this era back to life.
534;So, on one hand, you've got a unique perspective being presented to you from the Japanese actors that you absolutely cannot understand without speaking Japanese, and in the other hand you've got something roughly equivalent to its previous media release.
535;ray, it was cheap, and it was a fantastic movie.
536;Many said it was a good film, but not up to the epic status it had obviously tried to achieve.
537;What I had seen when it ended was a moving, excellent film which, if not perhaps an epic, is certainly a wonderful tale of a culture and heritage slipping away from an ancient and lasting civiliazation.
538;the Lord of the Rings, for example.
539;despite superior firepower and numbers, the Samurai win a resounding victory at the battle, and Algren is captured.
540;But after several difficult months, he finds himself living among friends, not enemies.
541;He is captivated by the ideals and disciplines of the samurai, and comes to fight on their side in a climactic battle whose outcome will decide Japan's future.
542;the directing is certainly very good.
543;edward Zwick seems to be one of those talented fellows who can have two characters very obviously love each other without commiting fornication.
544;That was one of the most amazing aspects of this movie.
545;limits, and The Last Samurai was refreshingly free of sex.
546;work is also excellent, giving us some views of the wonderful countryside of.
547;I find it a little strange that this movie was not actually filmed in Japan, but the country is so beautiful I can overlook it, and it looked to me like a place that could easily be found in Japan.
548;the acting is good, and having no previous exposure to Tom Cruise I was able to be satisfied with his performance and not have any unpleasant memories from his past films.
549;Ken Watanabe is very good as Katsumoto, and Hiroyuki Koyuki is wonderful as Katsumoto's sister.
550;but perhaps the best of all are the values in Last Samurai.
551;Honor, devotion to duty, discipline, and courage to do what you believe is right in the face of danger are all lauded here.
552;"I don't think Western culture is being universally blasted here, but I do think the film makers are trying to say that technology is not all that matters
553;East vs West, challenged, experienced, and well defined culture accepted.
554;Budo code of the Samurai, seemingly complex presented simply can become irresistible.
555;Katsumoto, the emperor's former teacher, is played skillfully by star of the flick Ken Watanabe.
556;As a prisoner in the samarai village, he is eventually schooled in the disciplined ways of the samurai.
557;He is lured into their culture and ridding himself of his emotional demons becomes one of them.
558;the battle and fighting sequences were stunning, the way of samurai life enticing but the movie could have been edited to remove about 10.15 minutes of redundant action.
559;I really have enjoyed the story and the beauty of the movie.
560;ray technology it's even better.
561;As a fan of Japanese culture and history, this film holds up fairly well.
562;there was a nice transition from languages to illustrate his communication with the Japanese samurai.
563;Nevertheless, the director did a good job of capturing the culture.
564;Even though I tend to be a purist, it's possible to watch this film and be entertained, despite some inaccuracies.
565;Great action, great scenery, and a good story!
566;Both video and audio were well done.
567;I liked this movie more than I thought I would.
568;Certainly, a beautiful story about the transformation of the Japanese culture without the Tom Cruise character, but the story of Nathan Algren is a nice mirror to that of the real hero of the story, Katsumoto who is portrayed in magnificent fashion by Ken Wantanabe.
569;He is drawn into a minor program of the American trade delegation to train Japanese soldiers to use Western military weapons and to perform as Western soldiers in the suppression of a band of renegade Samurai.
570;Of course, he is won over to their cause and helps them in their final battle against the massed armies of the Emperor.
571;that is all I want to say about the story.
572;It really does work and is filmed very beautifully (and a strong reason for the widescreen version).
573;It helps us realize what was being lost and corrupted.
574;This is where the movie really starts to shine and and a beautiful forgotten world that we know little about comes alive thanks to the great director Edward Zwick and the ledgendary Hans Zimmer brings an unforgettable soundtrack.
575;tom Cruise has been in the movie industry for a long time and to date in my opinion this is by far his best performance.
576;Another special part of the film is that a relationship develops between Algren and a quiet widow by the name of Taka, however this isn't a main part of the film it shows that the film isn't all about power and a disappearing nation but an emotional and beautiful aspect of the film.
577;the Last Samurai is a deep emotional and violent film which has become a triumphant in the movie industry.
578;Thanks for it's gripping storytelling, and excellent character design.
579;By far Tom's Cruise's finest hour.
580;Historically accurate as far as the Samurai existence and lifestyle makes this not only an enjoyable movie, but a learning experience.
581;Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe are excellent in their roles.
582;Would recommend to anyone who is into the martial arts type movies.
583;Fantastic movie and a must by on blu ray for anyone who appreciates it as much as I do.
584;I'm brought to tears every time I watch it.
585;The soundtrack is consuming and hypnotic.
586;This is a great movie, their is nothing more to say.
587;Japanese Warlords have won the entire country with rifle.
588;This has got to be one of the best films I have ever seen in this genre.
589;Without giving the entire plot away, the scenery, locations, and acting were top notch.
590;A must see movie if you love action!!
591;worth watching more then once.
592;new description was spot on.
593;In terms of history, thie movie is a fiction, but it succeed in explaining the main idea of samurai spirit.
594;I enjoyed The Last Samurai as a piece of epic entertainment, but it misses true greatness by at least a mile.
595;actually, the movie works best when it's in Dances mode, chronicling the adventures of a depressed white Civil War hero (Cruise in the Costner role) who adopts the lifestyle and teachings of a threatened civilization and ends up defending said civilization against encroaching white society.
596;This is the most compelling aspect of the movie, even though its structure is borrowed whole from a film that most people now claim to despise because of its political correctness.
597;Cruise is very good as Nathan Algren, the alien in 19th century Japan, caught in the middle of a civil war of another kind, between ancient Samurai warriors and a government seeking to modernize itself with weapons imported from the U. s. He's bested by Ken Watanabe as a Samurai tribal chief interested in learning the ways of his enemy.
598;Most of the action scenes are exciting, and there's plenty of Bushido lore and swordplay to keep Samurai enthusiasts happy.
599;The photography is gorgeous, too.
600;The Last Samurai, the new Tom Cruise action epic features nice perfomances and great battle sequences.
601;Director Edward Zwick who made the astounding """"Glory"""" along with the fine film""""Legends of Fall,"""" makes another epic with powerful direction."""
602;tom Cruise delivers a powerful performance ascaptain nNathan Algren.
603;Ken Watanabe is so compelling as the Samurai leader he nearly humiliates Cruise.
604;Cruise is so amazed by the teachings and beliefs of the Samurai he stays with them and fights for their cause.
605;being a $140 million epic, The Last Samurai truly does deliver.
606;The battle sequences are spectacular, some of the best since Mel Gibson's Braveheart.
607;The Last Samurai is rated R for Strong Violence and Battle Sequences.
608;They are made to be more intense than actually gory.
609;Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor and Best Origianl Score are the nominees.
610;It will probably receive a substantial amount of Academy Award nominations, we'll just have to wait and see.
611;I thought it was an excellent movie.
612;The acting was believable and it provided a historical context I think Tom Cruise did a really great job.
613;cruise with the more intense and inwardly tortured character seen in his better works.
614;"Certainly the film has its moments
615;Based in actual facts about the life of Mutsukashi (considered one of the best samurais ever existed) they added a lot of good actors and great locations and you get a fantastic film that really gives you the sensation of being among samurais and their mysticism.
616;This will become a classic.
617;The film is bold, dynmamic, and beautiful.
618;The cinematography done by John Toll (of Braveheart fame) is simply astounding.
619;Ken Wantabe and Tom Cruise are magnificent as well.
620;The entire movie plays out like a captivating story one cannot put down.
621;And the Hans Zimmer score will put tears into your eyes.
622;Not only the best picture of the year, but one of the greatest films of all time.
623;The Last Samurai is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen.
624;The only one any of those movies deserves is Best Special Effects.
625;Nevertheless, The Last Samurai has all the elements of a true classic.
626;out to be a story about the last rebellion of the Samurai in 1877, I believe the movie's more profound than that.
627;The story was passionate, exciting, beautifully written, directed, and acted, and I don't understand how it wasn't anything more than a smash.
628;One of the best movies I have ever seen.
629;The character development is amazing, and the end is very satisfying.
630;I have always loved this movie!
631;A great addition to any collection.
632;I would recommend it to anyone.
633;It's beautifully shot, wonderfully acted, full of humor, poetry and sensuality and considering the fact that it is of course A MOVIE (for those of you overly concerned with real looking sets, etc), I was mesmerized and entertained for the 2 plus hours I was watching this great movie.
634;My wife, who reluctantly attended the sneak preview, fell so in love with this film that she insists on seeing it again on Friday when it makes its full release.
635;There will always be the inevitable haters and those comparing it to Dances With Wolves, etc, but disregard those folks and go see what is sure to be an Oscar Winner.
636;This one is R because of the realistic battle scenes.
637;i have to say that Ken Watanabe is great in this movie.
638;The battle scenes are 'glorious', and the shifts from normal speed to slo.
639;It is a movie I will watch again sometime.
640;Every one of these large scale epics is full of wild battles, romance, outstanding performances, and the cream of the crop celebrities.
641;These are the films that are especially created to win the coveted Academy Awards.
642;A fun action film that longs to be SCHINDLER'S LIST.
643;tHE LAST SAMURAI at it's best boasts some of the most breathtaking close up battle scenes I've seen in a long time.
644;It was real, and true battle choreography.
645;Now that made me smile.
646;i also loved the scene in which Algern battles a group of overzealous Japanese soldiers who are attacking his friend.
647;The scene actually works and is a rare sight.
648;sAMURAI also features a nice relationship between Algern and Katsumoto.
649;Enemies that become friends, Wantanabe's character is strong because it feels real.
650;Wantanabe exudes the feeling of a real Samurai and not of a silly Kung Fu movie reject.
651;I loved how he could embody this man who is torn between his country and his king.
652;You watch it with this feeling that at any moment you'll see a graphic pop on the screen that says """"FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION."""
653;On one hand its breathtaking to watch and on the other its kinda of silly.
654;I'm going to recommend it to those whom like really cool battle sequences.
655;They are far better films.
656;have liked the martial arts.
657;The Last Samarai is one of the greatest films released in 2003, starring Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe.
658;Its hardhitting impact is intense enough to keep audiences' eyes wide open through the whole movie.
659;Its written plot of a US soldier changing his life for the better in Japan is brilliant.
660;Despite the war themes, there are some great heartwarming scenes, namely when the US soldier starts healing his pains from his US war battles.
661;As this develops, the drama also develops, which keeps audiences interested.
662;This allows the conflicts between the two sides to be brought out as brilliantly as it was.
663;His friends' life stories add an additional unique flavor.
664;The war scenes are uniquely intense.
665;nominated 1870's Japanese setting is flawless.
666;The war scenes are desplicted as brutal as they should thanks to the special effects.
667;The costumes are accurate from those times.
668;Such great background offers an improved sense of this masterpiece film.
669;tom Cruise's underrated role as US soldier Nathan Algren is his best in years.
670;The pain and agony expressed are as pure as if he actually lived it.
671;He proves that he will become a big.
672;All other actors also performed their roles beautifully.
673;The Last Samarai is great for those looking for a unique war movie with emotion.
674;This is sure to please many audiences.
675;This is destined to be a classic in the following years as it deserves.
676;The Last Samurai is a beautiful film, the kind of epic that David Lean might have made.
677;The film is true to historical events that happened in Japan during 1876.77.
678;The clash of tradition versus the influence of the West is sharply portrayed in these contrasts.
679;What makes The Last Samurai an excellent historical film is what also makes for a great historical novel: sticking close to historical facts, knowing the details of the society your characters are living in and developing a believable and interesting story.
680;The story of The Last Samurai fulfills all of this for me.
681;edward Zwick has captured some excellent performances.
682;Tom Cruise as Captain Algren has a truly memorable performance, one that he trained for several months to deliver.
683;I must confess that I was not a early fan of Tom Cruise but his work in recent years has been impressive and in this film he truly becomes the character he is portraying.
684;Ken Watanabe is wonderful as Kasumoto, loosely based on the life of Saigo Takamori, capturing the essence of the duty of a samurai and also the contemplative side of a warrior.
685;The performances by the supporting cast are excellent.
686;Her sensitive performance is one of the highlights of the film.
687;the cinematography is very impressive and the music by Hans Zimmer beautifully builds the mood.
688;The Last Samurai is a film that will be highly regarded years from now as among the best Hollywood has produced.
689;Received in a timely manner and movie was free of defects .
690;came in its original container and was priced well
691;A very well crafted [though violent] movie, with many parallels to the spiritual life, especially the priesthood.
692;could be deserving of an oscar for cinematography.
693;Oh yeah, he'll draw people into the movie so the movie will make money.
694;I'd rather havea good movie I could be proud of then have star power to lure people into the theater.
695;i went into this movie with excitement .
696;in previews, it definitely looked beautifully filmed, and I'd heard that some Japanese historians helped with it to keep it pure and on target historically.
697;I thought, against the fact that Cruise is in it, it would manage to pull itself up and be something really special.
698;And though the cinematography even sometimes tends towards clicheness, it is overall quite excellent and a pleasure to watch.
699;This is one of the best action movies since interview with the vampire.
700;"Though set in Japan, ""The Last Samurai"" is an American film for American audiences."
701;as far as it went, the film was enjoyable enough .
702;elaborately choreographed action and stunning (New Zealand) landscapes.
703;strong rebel army fought with modern weapons and tactics.
704;wielding knights in shining armor.
705;One of the best movies/Asian related movies of all time.
706;i have been to Asia many times and this evokes the best of Asia
707;Amazing storyline, fantastic scenery, moving.
708;I even got over the fact that the main character is played by Tom Cruise.
709;If you don't see any other movie this year, make time to see this one!
710;While I'm not a fan of Tom Cruise, his performance in this movie is outstanding, but the real star of the movie is Ken Watanabe.
711;Great acting and a great storyline.
712;I guess I'm a fan of Tom Cruise's action movies, but this on has a great story as well.
713;the movement of the movie was the right pace.
714;I love to watch a movie several times, study it, what makes it work, what really irritates the second or third time.
715;Cruise was brilliant in the small role and everything pointed to him being a great actor.
716;There is a BIG difference between a great actor and a superstar.
717;This has always tarnished his performances .
718;I hate to see great talent not reach their potential.
719;it was breathtaking to see the film where he FINALLY stopped being Cruise and go for the golden ring.
720;He is recruited to go to Japan to teach their soldiers how to fight.
721;Cruise goes down fighting as a true warrior and earns the awe and admiration from the Samurai leader Katsumoto .
722;katsumoto takes Algren back to his mountain strong hold, heals him.
723;The people are gentle, live by a code and do not fear death .
724;if it comes with honor.
725;He gradually joins the warriors training and earns the love and respect of the Samurai, and comes to love them in return.
726;They go forward knowing they are out numbered, out gunned, but in the timeless way of the Samurai, they face death with honor in order to make a statement.
727;it is beautifully filmed, deftly directed with a true understanding of the subject, and Cruise and Watanabe are brilliant.
728;My husband and I have viewed this movie several times, and we get more insight with each viewing.
729;From the spectacular scenery and colors to the powerful battle scenes, I am in love with this film.
730;I'm not a huge Tom Cruise fan, but this film has to be one of his best.
731;I love the storyline, and the fact that it is based on a true battle (the Satsuma Rebellion) and the real last samurai (Saigo Takamori) makes it even more compelling.
732;I know I will watch it again.
733;Some of his films have been among my favorites (Jerry Maguire, for instance.)
734;But this one belongs entirely to Watanabe who makes Katsamoto a character we empathize with and ultimately understand on an intimate level thanks to Watanabe's nuanced portrayal.
735;and manages to tell a story that is much more than that of the dying Samurai's rebellion.
736;Against this backdrop two men form an unexpected relationship: Cruise, the war shocked veteran of both the Civil War, and later the war against Native Americans as the US dominated and obliterated without truly understanding the culture that had lived on the soil first.
737;This is the true story of the film.
738;If you love the sorts of glorious epics that Edward Zwick has created in the past (GLORY, LEGENDS OF THE FALL), and even if you don't but simply love a beautiful film with characterization at its center, this is a must see movie.
739;It's a samurai flick starring Tom Cruise, and you know what: He's turing Japanese, I think He's turning Japanese, I really think so.
740;The Last Samurai is a film that tries to take a huge step into this imported.
741;productive and impressive film to see.
742;"Hey, this is an epic movie
743;Actually, the formula works in high numbers for this flick.
744;american village his men caused many years ago, and how he was adjust to a Japanese village while he was captured was intriguing, especially when he knows much about the Japanese culture: how the people were respectable though silly like normal people, be spiritually intertwine, understand nature, and aware about life and death, even children must know about it"
745;Adding Aldren knowing the hidden samurai spirit within, and the whole plotting structure makes this raw sushi well.
746;great as it seems, on the less greener side, the movie doesn't have a certain ingenuity that makes it inspiring and feels like it plays a big role in the movie industry and in our hearts.
747;The movie is very emotional and breathtaking, but it's not exactly thought.
748;Breathtaking is what I like to say the most on the movie's production value: good selection of cast, above.
749;par acting, wonderful musical score, and battles mixed with somewhat.
750;"'The Seven Samurai', this movie is so not at its league, but ""The Last Samurai"" is a great epic film to watch."
751;It's not profound, but it's still compelling in many ways.
752;IMHO his best movie ever .
753;Again I watch it every few weeks and always enjoy it .
754;I am a Social Studies teacher and wouldlike to share this issue, if a true account, with otherteachers in my local area.
755;I'm not always an avid fan of him and that has nothing to do with his Scientology views but this ranks as one of his best performances as a damaged Civil War vet who regains a sense of self when he encounters the Japanese culture.
756;Ken Watanabe is also excellent in his first starring English role and I think he was nominated for an Oscar if I'm not mistaken.
757;Being Asian I was entranced by Zwick's sensitive direction and also by the stunning photography.
758;While no movie is perfect, and all art can be improved, this effort comes pretty close.
759;The film blends the the epic and the personal, the external and the internal in masterful fashion.
760;cruise does well in his role, but the finest performances come from the Japanese cast.
761;"Ken Watanabe's portrayal of the Samurai leader is timeless
762;this is a film that must be seen, must be experienced.
763;It takes an immediate place on my all.
764;time list, blending the power of Braveheart with the feeling and morality of The Mission.
765;A rare and remarkable achievement.
766;Of all the films I have watched this year (and I have seen most of the Oscar contenders), this was the first time I actually thought to myself """"Wow."""
767;Tom Cruise is amazing in this film, as are the rest of the cast, most outstandingly Watanabe (Katsumoto) and Koyuki (Taka).
768;The Last Samurai is a story of love, spirit, and, most of all, a sacred honor which guides us all.
769;the battle scenes, while gruesome (if you're squeamish, you might avoid this one), were amazing.
770;deep down, it is a feel good movie.
771;Despite the death, the sadness, the lost hope, one ultimately cannot help but smile for the beauty of mankind.
772;Extra disc has fascinating stuff.
773;The sheer arrogance of this films is mind blowing.
774;He, like Mel Gibson, has often cast himself as characters whose bravery and martial skills are of almost mythic proportions.
775;Is he so hot and so wonderful that the wife of the man he killed can't keep her hands off of him?
776;After finally doing so, it's an okay movie.
777;This one is in my top 200.
778;seeking Japan and the ancient ways of the Samurai is very moving.
779;Beautiful cinematography, authentic costuming, and a sweeping story prove that hollywood CAN still create epics.
780;This is one of my all time favorite movies.
781;It has such an amazing story of compassion and love.
782;I have always been fascinated with Japanese culture and I know its just a movie, but they do such a great job of making you feel you are watching an epic tale of truth.
783;Great movie all around and the sounds and colors on Blu.
784;Good costumes, terrific and brutal battle scenes in a breath.
785;"Edward Zwick's work is a good ""modern"" action movie but certainly not a classic."
786;The last samurai is a classic that is a must for anyone's movie collection.
787;He has watched it several times, and says he would recommend it to anyone that likes these types of movies.
788;'Good enough' is about as good a review I can think of for this movie.
789;As long as your prepared for the formula ending you should be able to enjoy this movie purely on its solid production merits.
790;There are many wonderful scenes in the movie.
791;"I don't care if it's been ""done before"", this is a common archetype in all cultures and times and it is well portrayed through this film."
792;I find it well done, quite emotionally gripping at times.
793;the action in this film is great, Star Wars eat your heart out.
794;I grew up in a traditional martial art family, and Tom Cruise did a very solid job with the sword play in this movie.
795;Anyways, good work in the martial arena as well in this film.
796;Everytime the end came around at least one person both men and women cried.
797;This movie can hold your attention, but historically it is somewhat inaccurate.
798;Plain and simple if you like action this movie is for you.
799;If you like drama this movie is for you.
800;If you like foriegn this movie is for you.
801;iTs my favorite move, and Tom Cruise is awsome in this movie.
802;The degree to which I loved this film was really surprising.
803;It is a film of epic proportions.
804;The story is absolutely captivating.
805;I was glad I did because throughout the film I reflected back on what I saw and heard.
806;It was a movie that captivated my whole family.
807;There was plenty of action to keep your attention and to me it was not boring.
808;Movie is one of Tom Cruise's best acting.
809;Sound isgreat and the picture was wonderful.
810;But Tom Cruise puts in a strong performance here and won me over by the end of the film.
811;If you love swords this is the movie for you.
812;The action is spectacular, and the score is stirring.
813;For a movie with some brutally violent action sequences, it also features some amazingly peaceful and relaxing moments in the middle of the film.
814;Anyone who believes in honor and chivalry will find this movie inspiring.
815;A beautiful tale of a man finding redemtion in an unlikely plave.
816;SOMEHOW in the background of Japan becoming a modern society, and ending centuries of Feudalism, the United States become the BAY GUY.
817;One of the best movies, but why did Tom Cruise ruin it?
818;I'm not a huge Tom Cruise fan, but he has impressed me in some of his films.
819;'The Last Samurai' just so happens to be one of those films!
820;Cruise is excellent here and handles the lead role both physically and emotionally.
821;I do think that 'Dances with Wolves' edges this one out, but it is a wonderful film all the same.
822;the film is also beautiful to look with gorgeous scenery and breathtaking battles.
823;There are a few tiny instances where I smelled Hollywood, but they are so tiny, I can't take away from this impressive film about honor and loyalty.
824;It's just a beautiful film!
825;I retract my initial impression, retract a star, and absolutely do NOT recommend this insidious, slyly racist movie in any manner.
826;in 'Dances With Wolves,' the main character lived with the Native Americans and shared their lives.
827;history is stripped from those who made it, and placed at the feet of Racism.
828;civil War hero and former Indian Fighter who holds the rank of Captain in the U. S. Cavalry, `The Last Samurai' opens with a dream .
829;They believe in rebelling, they are doing the greatest service for him they are capable of.
830;figure to her sons, taught himself Buddhism, cured his alcoholism, and battled a veteran Samurai to a draw in a pitched match.
831;See Tiger Tom hold off eight Samurai, with a stick.
832;See Charming/Sexy Tom win over everyone in four months, from the widow of a warrior he killed, to the warrior's sons, to the Samurai themselves.
833;See GI Joe Tom become proficient in Martial Arts, without being taught.
834;See T2 Tom kick a bunch of Ninja's butts.
835;See Patriarchal Tom and his new friends go back to town.
836;See Wise Tom become head advisor to an ineffectual Katsumoto.
837;See Intrusive Tom steal Katsumoto's final honor.
838;the battle scenes are excellent, the effects are spectacular.
839;the only redeeming part of this film was the story, the wonderful scenery, and the supporting cast.
840;the modernization of the west (meaning the USA) is sweeping away the old ways.
841;The Emperor gets an American veteran named Nathan Algren to help train his troops.
842;Algren is an alcoholic, filled with angst because he killed American Indians, and he hates his new job.
843;from Cruise's love interest to his change of heart .
844;In fact, you may cheer when he gets beaten up.
845;he has the presence of a future screen legend, and he plays Katsumoto with vulnerabilities and real feelings.
846;This guy deserves to be the lead of such a film.
847;Koyuki also shows incredible expressiveness as the widow Taka.
848;directed film that happens to be set in Japan, check out the immortal samurai films by Kurosawa.
849;"Even merely taken on its own, ""Last Samurai"" is swamped in its own sense of self."
850;Watanabe and New Zealand are the best things about this film.
851;i highly recommend anyone who has not seen this movie should see it asap.
852;You will want to watch this movie more than once.
853;I feel that the movie had most of its power from the supporting actor Ken Watanabe.
854;The way that he acted throughout the movie could give him the Oscar in the Best Supporting Actor Catagory.
855;His great scene comes towards the end, where he gives emotion and power at once.
856;But Algren gets a job when Japanese businessman Omura wants him to train the new army, with somebody that he knows Bagley.
857;The Last Samurai was a beautiful film.
858;It had a beautiful sceney, beautiful action, some beautiful acting, and beautiful direction.
859;I really did love it, and I am including it on the best of 2004, only beause I saw it at the very beginning of this year.
860;This is one of those movies that you have to see in the theatre, otherwise it is not going to be an good.
861;Try and see it now, before it totally disappears.
862;The beautiful filming of the locations, the acting and the soundtrack unify really well in this movie.
863;The special features are also plentiful.
864;This movie is a must.
865;The good news: this is a big, beautiful movie relating an unusual story.
866;"Algren is taken to Katsumoto's mountain outpost and kept alive so that ""we may learn our enemy""."
867;Cruise is an attractive actor, and this may be his best performance to date.
868;Cruise's scenes with Watanabe, another charismatic actor, are the film's most defining.
869;The climatic battle is strikingly photographed by John Toll, as is the whole production.
870;The world of mid.19th Century Japan is richly reproduced, and there's even a fascinating glimpse of 1876 San Francisco.
871;"But, the ending notwithstanding, ""The Last Samurai"", spectacular and intelligent, was one of the best movies of 2003."
872;i thought the casting was fantastically done.
873;Though not the best actor in the movie, he certainly did good enough of a job in developing his character throughout the course of the film.
874;Ken Watanabe was excellent as Katsumoto.
875;when I found out that the lead actress, Koyuki, was 28 years old!
876;another good thing about this movie is that the Japanese characters actually speak Japanese to one another (there are subtitles, of course).
877;Unless you absolutely cannot stand the mere sight or thought of Tom Cruise, I'm quite confident that most audiences will enjoy this movie
878;Tom Cruise does a beautiful job portraying a Civil War veteran that is having a lot of difficulty accepting what occured in his past.
879;He ends up becoming a part of the warriors he was training to kill, and so begins the epic tale of Nate Algren.
880;The acting is amazing, Ken Watanbe plays a cool headed philosopher type samurai that has interesting and touching ideas.
881;This movie is definatly one that is worth seeing.
882;For sure a five star movie.
883;The film itself is great now that i saw it on blu.
884;This film is a fantasy, pure and simple, beyond just the addition of a white American to the rebel samurai ranks.
885;force onto the pages of history by, in effect, overthrowing the Emperor in the 12th century and usurping his power.
886;the symbols of their status.
887;nevertheless, the character of Katsumoto is indeed based on a real person, and the film on real events.
888;But the those who revolted were, first, a tiny minority of the samurai who continued to live by (or re.
889;"the portrayal of Japan and, specifically, samurai ""society"" in this film is the Western romantic version."
890;The cinematography is gorgeous, and I would happily watch the film again for that alone.
891;The acting is fairly strong.
892;"I personally think Tom Cruise is an excellent actor, when he chooses a good role (like in ""Rain Man"", ""Eyes Wide Shut"", and others), and he performs adequately here."
893;"altogether, I can best describe the movie as ""fun""."
894;"I find it enjoyable in the same way as I do anything from ""Terminator 2"" to ""Sleepless in Seattle""."
895;Most of Akira's films were about the Samurai and the complex warrior ethos that drove the development of some very meaningful and artistic storylines.
896;i think this movie is a very good introduction to the everyday North American (i. e. white) audience of the Samurai and their warrior culture.
897;The makers (and financiers) of this movie decided to entertain first and educate later.
898;The film was beautifully shot, the acting more then adequate, and the period costumes and props were exquisite and extremely accurate.
899;Very Exciting Film, and Ken Watanabe looks real Samurai.
900;I hope he will wins the oscar, because his acting very amazing.
901;The historical themes were also very cool.
902;Definitely Tom Cruise's best role, does a great job of showing you the Japanese Samurai culture.
903;The last samurai is one of my favorite movies.
904;The performances in this film are spectacular and it has a very entertaining story.
905;It's just a good blu.
906;The way this movie was shot was just beautiful and the blu ray does not take advantage of it very well.
907;fortunately, there are a ton of really good extras on the disc.
908;They are interesting to watch if you want to know more about how the movie was made.
909;if you are looking to get the last samurai this is definitely the version to get.
910;loyal soldiers for Japanese Emperior.
911;Chinese and rest of Asia knows very well that these are people who kills civillians, children, women and anyone else if the Emperior ask them too.
912;the Last Samurai may be an epic and Tom Cruise may have made Oscar worthy performance but would you honour a film portraiting how loyal Nazi was to Hitler or how English soldiers bravely killing Native Americans ?
913;One of my favorite movies of all time!
914;Would watch this movie many times and recommend to everyone!
915;The Last Samurai is a solid film that shows us cultural clashes between American ideals and Japanese philosophies in a truly enjoyable way.
916;The Last Samurai is a historical epic with a deep personal and spiritual meaning often not seen in sweeping Hollywood pictures.
917;"Every person involved in this film obviously brought their ""A"" game and truly bought into its unique vision."
918;Edward Zwick presents a fitting story for our modern times, times that are increasingly driven by technology, greed, and efficiency while often neglecting the importance of true inner peace.
919;The Samurai represent a simpler, more honorable way of life in which honor, virtue and loyalty to a set of moral principles proves more important than mere material success.
920;the redemption of American Captain Nathan Algren is beautiful to behold.
921;The figure of Katsumoto, last guardian of a rejected worldview, is inspiring.
922;The influences that both Algren and the Samurai have on each other are a pure joy to watch.
923;The battle sequences are awe.
924;inspiring, and truly moving, as the characters are painted with such a delicate touch that one truly feels the personal significane and moral weight of the conflict.
925;"see for us all living in a time when life is driven less and less by what is right, and more and more simply by what will make us more ""successful""."
926;So much so that it's a little hard to give the rest of the movie credit for the original parts it does well.
927;But taken on its own, I feel it merits four stars.
928;Still, he turns in a fine.
929;the other actors in this movie were well cast.
930;There is much to admire about that culture, but there is much to detest, as well.
931;Overall, I felt it was a dramatic and appropriate ending in keeping with some earlier themes (not to mention the title of the film).
932;all in all, this is an entertaining film with some nice cinematography and exciting action sequences.
933;"As a man who loves Kurawowa and other films of this genre, when I saw Tom Cruise was making this, I thought, ""You have got to be kidding."
934;Crouching Tiger deserved best pic darn it!!!!
935;It has Ken Watanabe in it, what else does one need!
936;He was fantastic in his role as the last samurai.
937;When should Tom Cruise get an Oscar nomination and wins it ?
938;I'm not a serious Cruise's fan, but I like his work and he works hard for his roles as many A. list actors do.
939;Again, he should be nominated for best actor Oscar for his role in the Last Samurai.
940;The movie is visually stunning.
941;it is a very good movie to watch, and certainly one of the 2003best movies.
942;I love historical dramas, and this was a really wondrous story.
943;Anyone who loves history will love this film.
944;All the Japanese actors were great.
945;Something you'll want to watch a few times.
946;I primarily enjoyed the evolution of the main character brought on by.
947;Lots of personal interaction of a philisophical nature.
948;Tom Cruise receives a lot of criticism for his films but I believe that this one is among his best.
949;great cast and very well filmed location shots.
950;Ken Watanabe, though, was the real soul behind this film.
951;His performance, his accent, his pacing, his lines.
952;Pretty good action scenes, Dances with Wolves.
953;and it's still better than the recent 47 Ronin.
954;Overall it was a good.
955;The Last Samurai is one of the best movies I have ever seen and it is by far Tom Cruise's best role.
956;Also adding to the film's greatness is the performance by KEN WATANABE as Katsumoto.
957;He is an incredible actor!!!
958;It is one that you will want to watch over and over again.
959;on a plus side, its well shot and good visuals.
960;"if you are in the mood for an ""independence day type blockbuster action movie"" see this."
961;This is a great movie.
962;Tom Cruise, Ken Watanabe, and the rest of the cast play their parts perfectly.
963;This movie is more than just some excellent battle scenes.
964;Oh, and there ARE some great battle scenes.
965;i was a little sceptical when I was about to watch this the first time, but it blew my expectations away, and I loved it.
966;Very few movies can bring this man to tears, but the end of this movie accomplished just that.
967;Do yourself a favor and get a copy of this powerful film.
968;I had a Japanese driving student, a Nurse Practioner in the US Army and she told me that it was a very accurate portrayal of hte culture.
969;"Filled with thrilling battle scenes, fabulous cinematography, and the rich culture of ancient Japan, ""Last Samurai"" delivers on every level."
970;Cruise's background and personal torment are glossed over a bit .
971;this could have been explored more, and his romance with the widow of the warrior he defeats in battle is left unresolved, but this is a great adventure story.
972;The Last Samurai is a movie clearly made by Westerners for a Western audience.
973;So what the movie lacks in realism it does, in a way, make up in heart.
974;american, I'm always on the prowl for the next good movie featuring Asian people and cultures.
975;I enjoyed the process of development the main character (Algren) underwent.
976;all inspired and taught to him by the samurai who become his friends.
977;The obligatory sex scene was also excluded (thank goodness), which is more consistent with how a Japanese widow would have conducted herself.
978;the movie boasted strong performances.
979;Tom Cruise's performance indicated his passion for his role, and if you watch the behind.
980;Ken Wanatabe was a charismatic and dynamic presence and he owned every scene he appeared in.
981;the cinematography was well done and the scenery was absolutely gorgeous.
982;This is a film that is very pleasing to the eye to look at.
983;Whoever oversaw art direction for this film deserves a raise.
984;The fight scenes were choreographed nicely, as well.
985;The film could have been better, but its heart was in the right place.
986;As with our American Civil War, it is fair to say the good guys won, yet it is wrong to view the losers as perfect devils in every way.
987;"There were some good qualities to them
988;Also I hope Japanese audiences will bear with us Americans for Hollywoodically inserting ourselves so prominently into their historical moments.
989;But as one who had previously lived in Japan for three years and worked alongside ordinary Japanese factory workers for a couple years, I sure enjoyed this movie a lot when I first saw it in 2009.
990;I think it is a great story and very well acted.
991;I have liked many of them and re.
992;This is Tom's best work by far.
993;Perhaps its the story or locations maybe the supporting cast or the great directing, whatever the efforts were that went into making this film, a wonderful movie was the final result.
994;I can only hope that TC can top this one in the future.
995;I really enjoyed the emotion and inspiration that unfolded throughout the entire film.
996;Of course, it has to end with the white man taking the Asian woman as his bride.
997;In short, great film to say the least and the music (Hans Zimmer) is excellent and blends perfectly with the movie.
998;I was happy with the product and the packaging and it came on time.
999;First of all, the story line is so intersting.
1000;It is around 1876 and Japan is on course to introduce western lifestyle in the country.
1001;Thus he decides to stand next to the Samurais and fight with them for their freedom.
1002;this is an epic movie.
1003;Tom Cruise is brilliant, his acting is amazing.
1004;This is must have for movie lovers.
1005;This movie is that short story expanded to feature length and moved to the Orient.
1006;He was one of the chief architects of the dismantling of the Shogunate and the dragging of Japan kicking and screaming into the modern world.
1007;many are recognized as great decades after their death.
1008;Saigo was that rare individual who was rightly recognized as great by his contemporaries.
1009;It makes for a fascinating story to learn how such a man could end up dying in a futile rebellion against the government he helped to create.
1010;while the movie got the sequence of events and the motivations of the protagonists wrong, the scenery, costumes, and weaponry appeared to be quite authentic.
1011;another area the movie got right was the archery with the assymetrical bow.
1012;notwithstanding the many inaccuracies of the movie, it is a stirring adventure of epic proportions, and quite enjoyable viewing.
1013;Just remember as you watch this very good movie, it is not, I repeat, not history.
1014;The battle sequences were suberb and stunning.
1015;I loved the fighting and plot.
1016;It was also historicly accurate.
1017;So you can learn from this film.
1018;It is story about regaining self respect.
1019;Everyone deals with demons in their past, if you would like to see a film that is exceptionally well acted, and beautifully filmed set in 19th century Japan, that deals with overcoming past mistakes this is a film you will love.
1020;I enjoyed the film, and will watch it again.
1021;developed plot, and a fair amount of things that in perspective to the history and culture being treated are just plain silly.
1022;this film could have been so much more, but alas it seems the film makers just didn't have it in them to go beyond the ordinary and produce something truly special.
1023;Ultimate conclusion: Somewhat enjoyable, but nothing more.
1024;But 'The Last Samurai' is a lovely film, very emotive and with a nice soundtrack, and some great perfomances from all concerned.
1025;he also understands and eventually sides with Katsumoto who also is protecting his people by way of protecting traditions a 1000yrs old.
1026;he also takes a sword the village crafts men made for him.
1027;At first a captive, he comes to understand, respect, and eventually side with the samurai in their noble but futile struggle against what must be.
1028;an excellent film for afficinados of Japanese culture, martial arts, and those who desire their action films to have three dimensions.
1029;the story of one man's moral redemption immersed in the tradition of the Samari.
1030;Beautfully filmed, violent, and inspiring.
1031;Possibly the best American film I have seen this year.
1032;tom Cruise does a wonderful acting job as he plays a soldier divided by his duty and personal values.
1033;Choosing between duties and personal values is something most of us can relate to in the everyday world, so this movie will make a personal connection with you.
1034;also, it's just amazing action!
1035;Some of the best battle sequences since BraveHeart, made this a real treat.
1036;The casting was excellent and the acting was solid.
1037;Shots in the rain, fog or sunset with tom cruises black silhouettewere artistic and perfect(a real treat for the artistic eye).
1038;The characters got you involved emotionally on levels of sadness and anger(which is another tribute to fine acting).
1039;I saw a couple good and fun films this year, but this one was thought provoking, emotional and a near masterpiece.
1040;Good news: the Japanese actors and actresses are very good at acting.
1041;Fair enough, and he responds to a question about scalping with a honest account of the method's brutality, which would seemingly be a mark against the noble.
1042;Liberal academic then forces us to say that since Indians are the real Native.
1043;Like 'Wolves', this film is bloody and beautifully shot, with large battle sequences.
1044;the supporting cast is excellent, with Ken Watanabe simply marvelous as the Samurai Leader, Katsumoto.
1045;I think just terrific, and would have been solely from the Japanese point of view.
1046;This really stretches the imagination .
1047;Japan was a VERY closed society in 1876, yet we are to believe that the Cruise character literally becomes one of them in a matter of months!The film is beautiful to watch, with spectacular action and realistic battle scenes.
1048;The final battle is inspiring, with the Spartan stand at Thermopylae being used to rally the Samurai against a clearly superior enemy.
1049;all in all, 'The Last Samurai' was enjoyable in spite of it's Hollywood origins.
1050;'Samurai' is really about Japan, and the Japanese actors did themselves and director Ed Zwick proud!
1051;He does an excellent job at making his character awestruckingly real, which is of course, the result of talented acting.
1052;Watanabe also has a breakthrough role, in which he is part of a group of legendary samurai warriors.
1053;Usually, movies that attempt to blend all these aspects together do a terrible job, but Last Samurai succeeds by a grand scale.
1054;a man believed to be the earthly manifestation of holiness.
1055;Most of the film is concerned with the gradual spiritual awakening of Algren, his commitment to the Samurai principles of battle and of life and Director Edward Zwick handles this quietly and with great dignity by exploring the growing bond among Algren, Katsumoto, and Taka.
1056;the entire cast is excellent and a large cast this is!
1057;The cinematography is breathtakingly beautiful, the musical score is thoughtfully eloquent, and the BIG scenes are a spectacularly Grand as the intimate scenes are extraordinarily tender.
1058;Sometimes a great film passes us by because of the megalomania of the media hype overpowering the actual film.
1059;Give this one a try in your home and see that it is better than you'd expected.
1060;Probably the best original historical movie, EVER.
1061;I would even go as far as saying that it is the best movie i have ever seen in my life.
1062;Otherwise the film was fantastic, a great cast, great script, and even better effects.
1063;I highly recommend viewing this fantastic motion picture
1064;I really enjoyed this movie Edward Zwick , it was a masterpiece it had it all.
1065;Action, suspense, a love story, sympathetic characters.
1066;Its gathered a great rating on IMDB, the movie is beautifully acted, has a good story and has an epic feeling like the movie """"Glory""""."""
1067;catching an HBO special on it, you could tell Tom realizedhe did something special with this film.
1068;He encounters and is captured by Katsumot (KenWatanabe).
1069;I bought this movie for my son and he loves this movie!
1070;ray Steelbook]Everyone knows the movie and in most ways i love it, it does have its fundamental flaws like the feel good hollywood ending but overall it is an entertaining flick, well if you can stand Cruise it is but if you don't like him don't watch his flicks.
1071;The Steelbook overall is pretty ho hum.
1072;This is a good film that's one of Cruise'sbest with an excellent score by Hans Zimmer as usual.
1073;ray has nice picture and sound plus neatextras.
1074;Ken Watanabe is fine, noble, strong yet vulnerable and easily out.
1075;In fact most of the Japanese cast is uniformly above average.
1076;Contrast this with the same composer's outstanding score for The Thin Red Line (incidentally a FAR superior film in every respect about men in battle/war/self.
1077;He wants that bloody Oscar SO BAD you can see him straining with the effort in nearly every scene.
1078;Several times I thought that bulging vein in his forehead was simply going to burst right there on screen.
1079;Cruise can be effective given the right role and a strong enough director to rein in his own worst instincts (this summer's Collateral for example).
1080;Even though I was dissatisfied with much of what had come before, a decent ending could have at least redeemed the film somewhat.
1081;"Beautifully shot and scored, this movie is enjoyable, but PLEASE do not think you are ""learning"" anything from it."
1082;the message of the movie is that the old ways are better.
1083;In some cases, this is true.
1084;It seems like a wonderful place filled with exotic, Eastern customs, honor, and so on.
1085;invented by the samurai themselves to justify their existence and stave off their eventual obsolescence.
1086;"It was in the 17th century that Bushido was invented out of whole cloth and ""samurai history"" was recast in this fictional light of honor and loyalty."
1087;loyalty was pretty much non.
1088;but it's beautifully rendered, with some nice (mythical) swordplay.
1089;This movie is surprisingly good .
1090;it is an exciting action film and is respectful of Japanese culture.
1091;My friends who saw it liked it, including Japanese people.
1092;That is interesting to know, because in general the Japanese I talked to did not like the TV series Shogun, which had a similar plot.
1093;The makers of The Last Samurai clearly had affection and respect for their material, which is evident on the screen.
1094;I liked all of the cast.
1095;As people have pointed out, Akira Kurosawa and others have made awesome action movies about the samurai before.
1096;I recommend Seven Samurai and Ran as two of the best.
1097;Watch Toshiro Mifune's incredibly moving speech about their injustices in The Seven Samurai.
1098;This film is a romanticized portrayal of the samurai, and I was comforted to recall during the movie's sad moments that their departure wasn't such a terrible thing after all.
1099;friendly government policies, Algren finds himself unexpectedly impressed and influenced by his encounters with the Samurai, which places him at the center of a struggle between two eras and two worlds, with only his own sense of honor to guide him.
1100;This is an outstandingly written, directed and acted film with a fascinating subject matter, the Japanese Samurai.
1101;This movie is one of the greatest action movies I have ever seen, with great acting, directing, and a great plot.
1102;It keeps you interested for the full 2 and a half hours.
1103;He lives with the Samurai and their leaded Katsumoto, who after a while the two take a great liking to one another and Nathan begins to train with them and learn their lifestyle and discipline which he comes to highly admire.
1104;That's all I'll tell you but you have to go see the movie, it's GREAT and you'll be pleased, especially at the ending and the honor and discipline that is promoted through the movie.
1105;I'll give this movie points for:1.
1106;they were very good and were able to do the physical stunt work in a convincing manner.3.
1107;a very interesting period in Japanese history.
1108;the issue that I have with The Last Samurai is that the film does turn into a 'Bwana adventure towards the end.
1109;Then he becomes a general of this rebel army at the same time, due to his vastly superior experience as an American soldier of course.
1110;I thought The Last Samurai, was an excellent movie.
1111;I have little doubt that I will watch this one many, many times.
1112;i chose this product cause it has a lot of natural and colorful scenes.
1113;the result was really amazing, visualy, blu.
1114;the movie per say is a must see for all those who like action titles.
1115;What is amazing is the instantaneous metamorphosis of Japan from a feudal society to a major industrial power.
1116;This is the first historically accurate portrayal of Custer EVER by Hollywood.
1117;these two contexts are the heart of this movie and it is amazing to see how a cowboy becomes an indian.
1118;The Japanese actors are absolutely engrossing in their first film before western audiences.
1119;Ken Watanabe has the key role as the Last Samurai leader, Katsumoto, who is dedicated heart and soul to the code of bushido.
1120;He is also the heart and soul of this movie.
1121;Shin Koyamada plays Nobutada, the son of Katsumoto and is unforgettable.
1122;We are also introduced to a captivatingly beautiful actress Koyuki, who plays the sister of Katsumoto and wife of a samurai slain by Algren.
1123;This movie is about duty and honor and being faithful to these principles.
1124;It is also about the power of redemption that can be acheived by commiting to these values.
1125;This makes a great double feature along with Kurosawa's Ran.
1126;The acting, actors, story line and scenery were superb.
1127;This is a movie that I will watch time and time again.
1128;As a teacher of the martial arts and more specifically Bushido.
1129;"Think what you will about tom Cruise (Love him or hate him) but his character is a good balance to the movie and helps mainstream an otherwise ""foreign film"" even people I know that will not typically watch a martial arts film enjoy this one."
1130;Ken Watanabe is the best as Katsumoto.
1131;The sense of honor is timeless.
1132;The best film Tom Cruise made since Rain man.
1133;Cruise's portrayal of the American soldier turned student of the Samurai is amazing.
1134;All the actors' performances as the Samurai are exsquisite, the whole movie is amazing and powerful.
1135;Brought tears to my eyes.
1136;This was a fantastic story about a man whose past haunts him.
1137;The story was fantastic, the scenery was gorgeous, the costumes were exquisite, the acting was phenomenal.
1138;This movie is definitely on my 10 best of 2004.
1139;I first watched this film in a theater, surrounded by a quiet group of twenty.
1140;as for the art direction, the film makes a commendable attempt at creating Yokohama's port life during the Meiji era.
1141;the real scene stealers are Koyuki and Watanabe Ken.
1142;Watanabe is powerful, charismatic and wholly manly in his role as an impassioned rebel samurai.
1143;Koyuki's loaded gazes and effective physical acting gives us a stellar performance and she doesn't even speak a word of English throughout the film.
1144;lastly, the portrayal of samurai village life with its emphasis on training truly portray the spirit of Bushido, and in a larger sense one of the underlying characteristics of Japanese belief, the pursuit of mastery.
1145;on a side note, the scenes of domestic life introduce a more realistic view of Japanese home life beyond the one.
1146;dimentional perspective held by North Americans.
1147;the film is a wonderful introduction to Japan at that time, and for those familiar with Japanese history already, it's an affirming portrayal of the challenging and exciting times of Meiji.
1148;Secondly, it's a first rate drama, gripping the viewer in a coming of age story, and reminding us that even though West and East cannot meet or agree, that Western people and Eastern people can meet and moreover, be worthy of each other.
1149;seeming Hollywood blockbuster, The Last Samurai was remarkably true to its subject matter.
1150;My main concern walking into it was that the director would confuse the code of the samurai with western ideas about courage and honor, disregarding the more morbid side of the tradition to present some sentimental parable about discovering yourself or being good.
1151;In fact, though, the samurai ethos is treated with enough depth, the acting and pacing is excellent, and while there is some sentimental nonsense, it restrains itself more than most films do these days.
1152;The final battle is especially impressive .
1153;it's still nothing spectacular, though .
1154;but it's probably as good a movie as we could expect to be produced for a mass audience.
1155;The Last Samurai is a 2003 action.
1156;The Last Samurai is one of Tom Cruise's best film roles since Born On The Fourth Of July.
1157;This film deserves to be part of the AFI's top 100 greatest movies ever.
1158;The additional segments about the making of the movie, Japanese culture, and the Samurai were also very good.
1159;This movie is wonderful in Blu.
1160;These formats were created for movies with great vistas and battle scenes, which abound here.
1161;It's a movie about honor, bravery, nobility and redemption.
1162;Along the way we have subplots including the clash of civilizations in 19th century Japan, a tender, thought.
1163;I consider him to be more of a movie star than he is an actor, yet I keep finding myself watching and enjoying his movies and this is my favorite.
1164;He did a fine job in this movie, however.
1165;the direction, filming and editing is as good as anything you're going to see.
1166;The sets, primarily in the Warner Bros lot in Burbank and in New Zealand were outstanding.
1167;The extras were equally outstanding, with the voice.
1168;the Last Samurai is a brave film that reveals the significance of the honor in the Samurai culture .
1169;He is a haughty man .
1170;ken Watanabe perfomance is the most remarkable character of this film .
1171;Is the last goal of a warrior to be happy ?
1172;This resolution final twists a wondeful film loaded with epic spirit .
1173;but if you miss this little detail you will be rewarded by far with this picture .
1174;superb art direction and special effects .
1175;An excellent movie that I loved.
1176;rated LOTR trilogy, where none of the characters really comes alive, this magnificent film if full of characters one admires, and loves .
1177;but the beauty and power of the film still overwhelm its shortcomings.
1178;Tom Cruise is amazing at any role he plays.
1179;This is an amazing movie!
1180;One of my all time favorites!
1181;From the opening scene, in which a haunting image is cast of samurai charging headstrong into battle with demonic masks and medieval weaponry, to the severing of a defeated samurai's head, the audience finds itself captivated.
1182;The Last Samurai is their story.
1183;tom Cruise, in an Oscar.
1184;worthy performance, is Capt. Nathan Algren, a man repelled by his past, a man weeping for redemption.
1185;His commanding officer beckons his services in the elimination of the unruly samurai who oppose American influence on their native Japan.
1186;armed with Winchester rifles and superior numbers, though utterly ill.
1187;right away, Katsumoto believes Algren to be this mystical feline that dominates his visions, something the others find hard to believe.
1188;in the process of winning over the companionship of the samurai and learning their language and discipline in the realm of battle, Algren comes to find his true identity.
1189;There were times on the battlefield where I came to dispute the existence of any sort of god, but there is a soulful enchantment about this place of which I've never known, he says.
1190;"some critics laughed off this $120 million epic as ""Dances with Sushi"" long before its release."
1191;well that was then this is now.
1192;"why such an epic movie, a superb production and what I consider Cruise's pass to inmortality in the world of true films, was given a ""foreign movie"" treatment??!!"
1193;As much as I enjoyed this movie, I think everyone should read this:The Last Samurai : The Life and Battles of Saigo Takamori, by Mark Ravina.
1194;The ideal we have today is rather the same as the ideal of the Authurian knights.
1195;The best movie I have seen so far this year, it is absolutely wonderful.
1196;I recommend it to anyone and everyone, a must if you like good movies.
1197;Great story, great acting, love the fight scenes (one.
1198;Captures an interesting time in history
1199;One of the best movies I've ever seen.
1200;It is without a doubt Tom Cruise's finest film.
1201;Personally I don't like the movie but the recipient did so I'm happy.
1202;"It has battle scenes yes
1203;The human side of the soldier (interesting now that these are war times).
1204;And also the family, friendship, loyalty, adult/children relationships (Cruise and the little Japanese boy, superb!)
1205;and above all, love a pure and sustained vision of love.
1206;Wacht out for Ken Watanabe's camera friendly expression"
1207;Nathan grows to respect and admire the Samurai, which is what the movie boils down to.
1208;Tom makes the movie believable, but with good help from Ken Watanabe (Katsumuto).
1209;It has a serious tone throughout the whole movie.
1210;With a movie like this it is probably hard to make a great ending.
1211;Definitely worth watching, preferably at night when you are doing nothing else.
1212;I always wanted to see this movie, and I wasn't disappointed.
1213;It is so compelling and may even make you cry at the end.
1214;I saw this movie when it first came out and still this movie is great!
1215;Seen as a historical epic, this is positively bad.
1216;And all his Western battle strategies fail, so some of the Samurais want to kill him but there's this one well.
1217;turn around and shoots the good caring Japanese Samurai in the shoulder!Unfazed, the Japanese samurai gets back up and charges towards Tom with his sword as Tom is frantically trying to reload his gun to light the fuse to take a second shot at the samurai.
1218;I know that the True Story is not correlated with the Film but this movie with its Story is great.
1219;One of Tom Cruise's Best works.
1220;ray has a great sound.
1221;The Last Samurai was one of those exceptionally rare films that I am sure I'll always remember.
1222;I too became a captive of the discipline, honor, and other virtues depicted in the Samurai culture.
1223;It was a completely absorbing movie.
1224;But it actually had a fantastic ending.
1225;i'd give it 10 stars!
1226;I then bought it and watched it again.
1227;From the strength of the superb supporting characters, to the gradual changing of cruise's character, and the details of the time re.
1228;created so credibly by the filmmakers, this was an excellent film of substance, not traditionally done by hollywood.
1229;I also feel cruise's portrayal was more convincing than Costner's, and that this film is of equal power and effectiveness.
1230;Watch it with an open mind, and scrutinize the background/secondary characters, all of whom .
1231;Japan was modernized at first to the best profit of the USA.
1232;This film concentrates on the final push against feudalism and its old code of honor represented by the Samourais.
1233;The film shows this very well.
1234;Just change, and profits for a few.
1235;adventure, some historical basis, some romance and drama (though you do need to excuse a number of cheesy lines particularly towards the end).
1236;It is a really interesting story, it shows parallels between Native Americans and Japanese people trying to preserve a very important piece of their culture.
1237;Tom Cruise is great in this movie, personal favorite of all his works.
1238;the story is pretty good.
1239;In time, Captain Algren finds himself wanting to become one of the Samurai and learning more of their way of life.
1240;It was fantastic, especially seeing the colorful Japanese landscape in all of its magnificence.
1241;Otherwise, the pacing of the movie is pretty good.
1242;It give one a perspective of history.
1243;It brings out a lot of emotion as well as having good action scenes.
1244;This is, in our minds, one of Tom Cruise's best works.
1245;If you like historical drama, you should love this.
1246;the subtle romance, the downtrodden Captain with his internal struggles, finding healing and honor in such gorgeous landscape.
1247;Tom Cruise is accessible and likable in this movie, the cast is superb and every moment is worth watching.
1248;This is a fun film if you watch it as a fantasy adventure with no basis in history.
1249;Have seen this pic in cinema here irelandthought it was pretty damn good cruise pulled off this one very well .
1250;Anyway, Tom Cruise delivers his finest performance as an ex.
1251;"While he is living in the village as a ""slave""
1252;The final battle scene is amazing how sword bound samurais fighting rifle shooting Japanese army.
1253;And when I saw the commercials when this movie came out in the movies, I couldnt help but laugh.
1254;It is a solid epic movie, which can drawn comparison to the blockbuster Gladiator (another of my favorites).
1255;And the unique storytelling is what makes it an epic.
1256;But what i found best served the movie was the fact that it didnt try to add any torrid romance to it.
1257;Thank goodness Zwick understood that making a movie about the morals of the Samurai and adding a couple extra sex scenes wouldnt work.
1258;basically, if you like epic movies like Gladiator, this is a great movie for you to watch.
1259;cuff sort of way ( Many brave men on both sides will die today. )
1260;In my opinion anything that shows the ability for one culture to come together with another is a movie worth seeing.
1261;Yes I know how the movie ended, but please note that the main character went into the movie thinking that the Samurai were savages like he was led to believe.
1262;However, he came out of the whole ordeal with new respect for not only another culture that was indeed not savage at all, but he also came away with a new respect for himself.
1263;He learned a great many things from the Samurai, and it helped his soul heal.
1264;Ok, the fight scenes were great too!
1265;Fantastic film that gets better with age.
1266;The scenery and music are striking and the performances by Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe are memorable.
1267;A good movie to watch as it not only has historical relations to it, it has a well brought together cast as well.
1268;One of Tom Cruise's greatest films I put this one on one of his top ten best films he ever accted on here.
1269;The Last Samurai is a movie of great action that ends in sadness.
1270;The fight scenes and the cinematography are at times awesome.
1271;once one gets past the politics of the makers of the movie and the inaccurate historical presentation it's a pretty good movie for those old enough for an R rating.
1272;For a better sword action movie with sharp editing and a great screen play, check out Antonio Banderas in the Thirteenth Warrior.
1273;I liked this movie a lot.
1274;The acting ranged from good to excellent.
1275;How often do we see a truly original movie storyline thse days?
1276;The treatment of the samurai and bushido was excellent, and the final battle (samurai vs cannons and guns) was truly horrific.
1277;this is one I will be watching again.
1278;Katsumoto's appeal as the intriguing, strong, lighthearted and wise leader of the Samurai, certainly earns him the best supporting actor nomination (if not award), in my opinion!However, the appeal of Katsumoto also helps to highlight one of this movie's two weaknesses.
1279;Katsumoto (Watanabe) is so good, that he deserves more screen time than he receives.
1280;in the end, you leave a whole appreciation for Samurai culture and beliefs and with a little bit of relief that the delicate cultural themes throughout the movie could have been handled far less sensitively!
1281;In its released form, the actual product is very moving, however, its needs a little bit more polishing to make it a masterpiece.
1282;This will be a remembered movie, nonetheless.
1283;mr. Watanabe, you may accept your Oscar come springtime!
1284;The sets and scenary were beautiful.
1285;Tom Cruise created a complex character.
1286;The comparison to Dancing with Wolves is fairly accurate.
1287;The fight scene between ninjas and Samurai was good.
1288;There are probably far better Japanese movies of the period.
1289;Was and still is one of my favorite movies, Tom cruises best movie in my opinion.
1290;Let us call it something celebratory and romantic, like, The Last Confederate.
1291;Glad Amazon had such a great deal on it too!
1292;My son's favorite action movie ever!
1293;This movie was the greatest movie I've ever seen, it will continue to be my favorite movie for a long time.
1294;The Last Samurai had better special affects and a most intriguing story.
1295;I loved the relationship between Algren and the Samurai class, the fight for survival in the newly modernized country Japan after 1868 when Meiji's reign as Emperor began.
1296;Its quite fascinating how this story, even though the character Algren and the dealings with the Americans were fiction how this story was so well drawn out.
1297;The character that portrayed the legendary Saigo, or """"Dai Saigo"""" otherwise known as a fictional character as Katsumoto did such a dramatically important role, a role in which it took a strong will and personality to play."""
1298;I love to read about Japanese history, and I can say right now that they did a spectacular job in recreating the nation of Japan back in the times of Meiji.
1299;This film is a must see!!!
1300;I agree with the critics (something I rearely do.)
1301;when they say this film is of epic porportions.
1302;This film moved me very deeply, but it also had a touch of humor here and there.
1303;I can't wait until it's released so I can see it again!!!!
1304;The final battle scene in particular sounds phenomenal in its uncompressed, high definition format.
1305;Came with everything as promised and in perfect condition!
1306;Yes it's fiction, but a great movie.
1307;The acting is well done and I recommend everyone see this tear jerker.
1308;But this movie is, in my opinion, good for the whole family, if you don't mind, bloody action sequences.
1309;The fighting choreography was brilliant.
1310;All the actors play their parts really well, and after each fight, you are left hanging for more.
1311;This kind of takes the essence away from stronger weapons.
1312;it's all a bit Dances With Wolves but, although The Last Samurai isn't in the same league as that movie, it remains an engaging and watchable, albeit flawed, epic.
1313;modern Japan should look elsewhere (Akira Kurosawa's films, and the recent Twilight Samurai, would be good places to start) .
1314;The samurai are depicted as peace.
1315;over much of the native audience here, mind you, leaving only us gaijin to scoff at the inconsistencies.
1316;if you can overlook the inaccuracies (and I'm sure the average viewer would be happy to), The Last Samurai is a pretty entertaining watch.
1317;Cruise turns in a decent performance .
1318;but it's Watanabe who provides the most compelling screen presence.
1319;His Katsumoto is a dignified, commanding figure, whose commitment to the ancient Bushido samurai code (which, with its let's rush headlong towards a bloody and unnecessary death!
1320;Director Edward Zwick comes up with some exhilirating set pieces, too: the final battle is well.
1321;What you're left with is a handsome and entertaining movie .
1322;a bit hollow at the core, maybe, but well worth a watch.
1323;One of Tom Cruise's best performances and Ken Watanabe is just incredible in his intensity.
1324;The Last Samurai was a great movie.
1325;Probably the best American made Japanese movie of all time.
1326;Being that this was based partly on a true event, this makes this movie even more incredible and remarkable.
1327;Everyone I know enjoyed this movie.
1328;Others including me felt this was the best movie they've ever seen.
1329;There comes a time when you are watching a movie when you know what you are watching is a great movie.
1330;I felt that way while watching this movie.
1331;the Special features were incredible also.
1332;So many documentaries were incredible.
1333;And I especially enjoyed the Japan premiere segment and hearing how the actors felt on the opening of this movie in November.
1334;It was very thorough and very interesting.
1335;And you keep trying to compare this to Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece the Seven Samurai.
1336;If you like it, that's good.
1337;I felt it was a much better movie and story from my view.
1338;It was an incredible technique to use.
1339;This was a great movie.
1340;But I felt this was a great movie, and the flaws that you talked about that you felt about this movie don't have much relevancy with the movie I saw.
1341;encompassing Japanese empire loyal to the divine emporer.
1342;"so in order to create a viable and sympathetic ""Last Samurai,"" director Zawick and screenwriter Logan created a fictional Katsumoto to replace the historical Saigo."
1343;This way, they were able to focus on a pastoral outlook of samurai life and discipline .
1344;In doing so, they created a very pretty film filled with very pretty images and highly sterilized ideas.
1345;"He joins Katsumoto's rebellion and learns bushido, the ""way of the warrior."""
1346;The young Meiji emporer, on hearing the manner in which this loyal samurai perished, rejects Westernism and gives all of the evil businessman's money to the people.
1347;It's a great piece of eye.
1348;the shining highpoint in the century.
1349;It's a lovesong to the romantic ideas of Orientalism .
1350;a throwback to the days when American housewives wore kimonos and played mah.
1351;are gorgeous, the swordplay is gracefully violent, and the natural earth.
1352;"an invasion once designed and supported by the real ""Last Samurai."""
1353;"Americans and Europeans, still in the throes of ""yellow fever,"" will love this flick."
1354;This could have been a great movie, had it presented balanced viewpoints from both Katsumoto and the industrial tycoon who opposed him.
1355;the ambiguities and impurities to both sides of a tenacious struggle in which there is no one correct way.
1356;The Meiji Restoration was a tumultuous period in Japanese history, and the struggles of the period were highly layered and complex.
1357;instead, Zawick and Logan gave us a fable and a fairy tale, and so their historical narrative is severely weakened.
1358;simplification of something very real and very relevant to modern times .
1359;photographed, so it gets two stars.
1360;Add one star for the wonderful screen presence of Ken Watanabe as Katsumoto, the one character in the movie anyone cared about.
1361;"Jim Jarmusch's ""Ghost Dog"" is an interesting modern meditation of bushido, and many arthouse Yakuza flicks deal with issues of honor and loyalty in grittier, more human terms (check out ""Beat"" Takeshi's ""Brother"")."
1362;"[Edit] An infinitely better depiction of the Japanese samurai spirit is ""Letters from Iwo Jima."""
1363;but the values so prized by the samurai .
1364;loyalty, bravery, and sacrifice .
1365;I loved the movie myself.
1366;Great camera work, nice action scenes, and alot of drama.
1367;i think Cruise did a fine job.
1368;But I'm sorry so do most actors that people think are great.
1369;I love Anthony Hopkins myself, but he always seems the same.
1370;i liked the relationship between Cruise and the people of the village.
1371;And, he got on well with her kids.
1372;Call me chauvanistic here, but any man that is good with a woman's kids will hit a soft spot.
1373;"The act moved an ""honorless white man"" (culture gap again) to come before the emperor and even offer to end his life in some accordance to the Bushido code."
1374;Recognize what you have and are and move forward with pride in those things.
1375;anyhow, I found the movie to be both entertaining and moving.
1376;They really made up a lot of history for this one.
1377;I guess the music was pretty good, and it had some gread scenery, but i wouldn't watch it twice.
1378;my curiosity got the better of me!
1379;ridden, Indian War veteran is hired by Japanese government to stamp out rebellion, gets captured, dries out, and over the course of a few months becomes a disciplined, fierce, Zen.
1380;He switches sides, becomes a master tactician, kills countless Japanese soldiers and a few Americans along the way, and lives to tell the tale.
1381;the scenery was nice, the Japanese actors terrific, and thankfully the incipient love affair wasn't allowed to blossom on screen, which would have violated every norm of Japanese culture of the time.
1382;This movie is a glimpse into the history of the Samurai Warrior, and his way of life.
1383;I recommend it to anyone interested in this subject.
1384;everything from the acting to the set designs was great.
1385;The dialogue was very engaging and the fight scenes was out of this world, especially when TOM cruise's character fights Ujia in training.
1386;this is our favorite movie.
1387;We have seen it numerous times on television, and it is always exciting and entertaining.
1388;The role of the emperor is played by a famous Kabuki actor, from a family of highly respected Kabuki actors.
1389;I realy have enjoyed this mo9vie.
1390;Last Samurai is no masterpiecebut technically it isthe visuals, the sound effects, the music.
1391;I was very resistant to see this movie.
1392;The true story without the fictional character that Tom Cruise plays was just as intriguing.
1393;i must admit this was a good movie.
1394;It was cinematically lush and rich.
1395;The views, scenes, and camera shots were amazing and captures a spirit of Japan that is rarely seen.
1396;Hans Zimmer makes a emotionally captivating soundtrack.
1397;The costumes were well crafted period pieces.
1398;The actors gave commendable performances.
1399;I was most captivated by Ken Watanabe's performance.
1400;His character was a beautiful balance of opposites.
1401;He was powerful yet serene, and a leader yet a servant, a rebel yet was dedicated to the emperor.
1402;Loosely based on the life of Siago Takamori, the movie is overall a good film.
1403;Algren holds the samurai, yet it appears that the whole of the troops are bowing to Algren!
1404;Algren accepts the position (the money is good), and begins to train the Japanese.
1405;i thought this was a beautiful movie.
1406;The cinematography was just stunning and while the film may have had a slower pacing, I found it incredibly engaging.
1407;"Edward Zwick is the director of the underrated ""Courage Under Fire"" and ""The Seige"", ""Legends of the Fall"" and the excellent film ""Glory""."
1408;The Last Samurai is one of the year's best thus far, and I would definitely recommend it.
1409;The last Samurai was a really good movie.
1410;The Captain gets captured during a battle and stays and trains with the samurai.
1411;It is really good watch it.
1412;sometimes makes a good movie.
1413;He is contracted to whip the Japanese army into a fighting force.
1414;In battle he is captured by the Samurai.
1415;Their leader is played very well by Ken Watenabe.
1416;He is impressed by Cruise's fighting skills and spares him.
1417;Lots of really good extras in this two disc set.
1418;Cruise is really charismatic and likeable in the extensive interviews he gave.
1419;He put a lot of time and effort into this movie.
1420;Lots of background and interviews with other principals.
1421;In some ways the extras are better than the movie.
1422;I highly recommend this film to anyone who can appreciate war drama.
1423;This is,in my opinion, Tom Cruise's finest role in any film to date.
1424;"The musical score by Hans Zimmer is emotional and inspiring
1425;At the Amazon price, this is a must.
1426;A very promessing film, The Last Samurai talks about something that is sacred to many of us: Honor.
1427;The willingness to live in accordance with a code honor in all aspects of life.
1428;Being captured by the enemy he actually finds his peers.
1429;Looking at the trailer i can garantee a superb blockbuster i tell this.
1430;When it first came out, all signs seemed to point to it being a horrible, tedious, Tom Cruise wants an Oscar, epic flop.
1431;'The Last Samurai' is a riveting action adventure semi.
1432;I laughed at the idea just as much as anyone.
1433;It's shocking how easily you are drawn in and believe everything you see.
1434;This is how well done the movie is.
1435;The law banning samurai from carrying their swords is true, the rebellion of the samurai is true, and even the Emperor of Japan in the movie was a real emperor who actually did all the """"Westernizing"""" of Japan."""
1436;After finishing it, I immediately delved into the special features, needing to know more about the movie, which is rare for me.
1437;I suggest it to anyone who loves a great action/epic.
1438;Despite the simplistic plot, the movie is delivered with a great earnestness and sense of purpose.
1439;Watanabe is at once fierce and serene as the lead samurai, [was he a daimyo or in the service of one?]
1440;This film hints at the beauty and depth of bushido, trying to make it understandable to the western sensibility.
1441;"I have a great love for Japanese culture, history, and aesthetics
1442;While it may be decried as a star vehicle for Cruise I think one can watch and enjoy it from period piece point of view.
1443;Last Samurai is a fantastic movie.
1444;The acting is superb, the scenery is spectacular, and the costumes are extraordinary.
1445;A great story that is well told.
1446;an amazing and sweeping old fashioned epic historical fiction drama from the director of the modern classic """"Glory"""" Edward Zwick is one of the decade's best pictures."""
1447;The acting is flawless as is the direction, the action sequences are gory and well made and the photography is just stunning as is Han Zimmer's score.
1448;This epic film demonstrates that the technical competency of modern American filmmakers is complete.
1449;however, in addition to technical virtuosity, there is undeniably artistic merit here.
1450;In my mind the most artistic and therefore most interesting scene in the film is when Algren (Cruise) disembarks at Yokohama.
1451;The lavish and loving care that obviously went into the creation of this time.
1452;One could watch this scene over and over again, seeking new details each time, and enjoy the pastime.
1453;The geology of New Zealand is similar enough to Japan that this setting comes off very well in the story telling.
1454;"Also, kudos to the carpenters and design team who created the structures
1455;also in the positive column is the costumery, especially the Samurai armor.
1456;All visual aspects of this film are superb.
1457;and so is the story line"
1458;this is withal a very good film, but with such elements described above going for it, it could have been a timeless classic of the filmmaker's art.
1459;Is it necessary to make this film a financial success?
1460;I submit the correct formula for great story telling is to make such scenes brief interludes, then get back to the human drama, which hopefully will include some inspiring dialogue.
1461;i admit I'm nitpicking here, but Taka, played by Koyuki, looks like the modern model she is.
1462;so, my recommendation is to watch this movie because it has very considerable merit, but my question is: who decided modern American moviegoers are primarily induced to pay money to see gory battle scenes and care little about complex human interaction?
1463;I'm really into samurai culture and the way the samurai lifestyle was portrayed from a foreigner's point of view was made for a very interesting movie.
1464;This is one of the best movies I've ever seen.
1465;Tom Cruise has alway been a good actor, but I consider this to be his best work to date.
1466;It is the sory of a man who found the meaning of who and what he was, in anouther land, and found the piece mind that he had thought lost forever.
1467;i am happy to add this movie to my library!
1468;This movie, was incredible, simply put.
1469;Such a mix of romance and honor, all beautifully blended together.
1470;He is held in captivity with the Samurai, and thrives off the peace that is afforded him there.
1471;He begins dwell in the same way he observes the people do in the village, and learns honor with the help of Katsumoto.
1472;When an assassin team of ninja attempt to kill Katsumoto, he refutes his american heritage and helps keep Katsumoto alive.
1473;a simply AWE inspiring film, a must see, for anyone.
1474;One of the best battle scenes ever (at the Lord of the Rings/Braveheart/Glory level)2.
1475;"It's an epic
1476;Superb performance by Wantanabe, Cruise.
1477;The Saurai are misrepresented as pure good guys and the Japanese govt.
1478;Later, he can't even touch them in a practice fight!
1479;despite its flaws, it ranks #9 in my Personal Favorites b/c I'm an epic lover (the Lord of the Rings, Lawrence of Arabia, Braveheart, Gladiator, Glory, Spartacus, Patriot, etc.) It has great costumes, excellent cinematography, solid acting with honorable mention to Wanatanbe, and is just a great movie.
1480;Tom Cruise was very commendable is his role, and the action sequences were stunning.
1481;I think Americans are cool!)
1482;He killed her husband, and symbolically takes his place as a way of keeping his honour and as a message of karma in the film.
1483;It's my personal favorite ever, """"and that's saying a lot"""" *quoting Samwise Gamgee* I loved Two Towers, watched it 3 days in a row before going to see this, and still this one tops it off."""
1484;This is one of the best movies I have seen in a very very long time.
1485;I will not bother giving a synopses for the movie, but I will tell you what I loved.
1486;The movie has a great theme, that of a man seeking to atone for his sins.
1487;In the end, he finds the means to forgive himself through the help of another man, Kasamoto and his culture.
1488;If anything, watch the movie for him!
1489;"This film started out interesting and good,and then just became ""Top Gun""."
1490;This movie had to be the most inspirational movie I have ever seen.
1491;If you haven't seen it yet, you have to see it.
1492;If you liked Gladiator, you will love this movie, especially if you are interested in Oriental culture.
1493;mouth disobying little rat but still there is something about him that makes you like him, maybe it's the fact that he uses quite a bit of humor in interacting with the local people he eventually ends up staying with.
1494;even though Cruise is good I believe the show.
1495;stealer in this movie is Ken Watanabe, he delivers an amazing performance that will have you cheering for him at the end of the movie and also will make you want to go check him out in other movies, I know one of the first things I did after watching the movie was to find out what other movies he had been in.
1496;even though the plot of the movie is pretty predictable the way the movie has been shot and the exterior shots are so beautiful that you just keep on watching, for some reason the movie doesn't seem as long when you are watching it for the first time, I believe that to be a sign of a great movie, one that keeps you entertained for hours without it seeming like its taking hours.
1497;scenes you are going to be treated to one of the better movies of 2003, highly recommended epic movie
1498;This it's a movie very good for all audience , my prefer at this moment, and good areas to makes
1499;In the process, the man gets captured by the samurai and during this captivity he begins not only to learn about their ways and philosophy, but also has peace for the first time in many years.
1500;the Costume Design is incredibly accurate and the cinematography is absolutely superb.
1501;The music by Hans Zimmer is just beautiful, like another Gladiator epic.
1502;This movie is for people who love those little details.
1503;The production is really ambitious and works to deliver an astonishing view.
1504;A touching story coupled with highly realistic and detailed battle scenes.
1505;It issimply superb in term of visual satisfactions.
1506;From the beginning of the film, you are led to believe that Ken Watanable is a master of war.
1507;And may I mention that the advice given to Watanable by the American captain is to take away the advantage of gun .
1508;It was a decent action/ adventure flick.
1509;This movie is a very interesting look at opportunism, guilt and shame on the one hand and opportunity, pride and honor on the other.
1510;the comparison between the opportunism of the US against the native American tribes compared to the resistance of the old world Japanese Samurai was fascinating to say the least.
1511;algren finds himself in a new world and a new mentality.
1512;the movie reflects a full range of emotion from sorrow, to anger to love and deep reflection.
1513;He has a few lines that come across funny to a degree.
1514;the battle scenes, from the two larger battles to the one small skirmish are pictured very intensely.
1515;I wonder if the scenes showing the battle between the Samurai and the newly formed Japanese army are really a reflection of the American Indian fighting the US Army in the great Indian wars.
1516;the basic story though is well thought out and well presented.
1517;The scene of hand to hand combat was appropriate and realistic.
1518;I particularly was impressed with the intense desire to live shown in that scene.
1519;the sensation of emotion is very intense in this film and sensationalism was not necessary for me.
1520;i will watch this movie again and will add it to my wish list.
1521;This movie was very entertaining.
1522;Fairly accurate from a historical perspective, the Last Samurai details Japan's change from a old school monarchy to a western influenced emerging power.
1523;Tom Cruise plays a good washed up war hero, but the strongest performance is by Ken Watabe, who plays the 'last samurai.'
1524;Good, entertaining, well worth watching.
1525;This is the best damn tom cruise ever.
1526;this movie is a masterpiece.
1527;Great performance of Tom cruise.
1528;i am not a big fan of him but I just love this movie.
1529;This was a very important part of history that everyone should want to know, also important to see how the western civilization affected nations across the globe.
1530;Fantastic Movie one of Tom Cruise's best performances.
1531;this is a great story and very well done.
1532;I also like theKen Watanabe as Katsumoto he is a fantastic actor.
1533;If you loved Dances with Wolves, you'll love The Last Samurai.
1534;this movie is a good mass.
1535;Japanese culture and history is dumbed.
1536;Ken Watanabe gives a great performance as the eponymous Last Samurai.
1537;this film succeeds as an entertainment.
1538;For those who enjoy the book SHOGUN by James Clavell, sit back for a true treat.
1539;From the epic scenery of Japan(wow!)
1540;to the battles scenes(double wow!)
1541;The romance was refreshing and beautiful as there are no nudity or sexual scenes that hollywood soo depends on to get ratings(or points across).
1542;The Asian actors, Ken Watanabe, Hiroyuki Sanada, and Koyuki(gorgeous in all graceful forms) all deserve nominations as I rarely see such inspiring performances.
1543;Everything you'd expect in a grand adventure from director Edward Zweck.
1544;The music by Hans Zimmer is truly deserving.
1545;"If you like this, perhaps you'll also enjoy a Japanese animation that's called ""samurai X: trust, and samurai X:betrayal""."
1546;Since I got it, I have watched it 3 or 4 times.
1547;While I have never been a Tom Cruise fan (the publicity about him does not sway me one way or the other), this movie has given me a great appreciation of his talent.
1548;It made me also realize what a tremendous amount of preparation work and physical training it takes for an actor to develop the skills for his roll.
1549;Other performances in the movie were exceptional, especially that of Ken Watanabe.
1550;After you have seen it, you will want to own it.
1551;My husband doesn't like him, yet he loved this movie.
1552;"His remark: ""Tom Cruise must be a really good actor, because I don't like him, and yet I really liked the person he played."""
1553;The final hour in particular is breathtakingly well done.
1554;Every shot of the Samurai village is postcard perfect almost to the point of unintended parody.
1555;"Like Robert Redford's take on Montana in ""Legends of the Fall"", every view is spectacular, every sunset is orange, every leaf is colorful and falls just so and all the characters are freshly scrubbed and dressed in their Sunday best."
1556;Of course the old time Samurai are romanticized to the nth degree.
1557;Yet the picture despite one or two faults works.
1558;The acting, with one exception is uniformly excellent.
1559;The battle scenes are plentiful and full of surprise and the pacing is good.
1560;His strangely self effacing dialogue doesn't help his cause, yet it truly is his performance that is cringe worthy.
1561;I still recommend The Last Samurai highly however as a thinking mans action movie.
1562;this movie is amazing on all of these fronts.
1563;even Tom cruise being Tom cruise is very good portraying his role in this movie.
1564;Now this is what I like.
1565;"The atmospheric element in this movie is stunning
1566;I loved the ninja attack.
1567;This is one of the few recent productions in which the masculine is portrayed in a wholesome manner: the warrior spirit, the camaraderie, the honor, and the respect for the inner peace that is brought by zen meditation practice, are brought out very well.
1568;the whole film was a vibrant, violent, passionate look into a past that Japan has never been able to reclaim since the days of the Samurai.
1569;cruise does well not to fluff the Japanese language too much in the movie, I liked that they used subtitles, it gave the movie considerable authenticity, and the fight scenes as gory as they were, were breathtaking to watch, along with a fabulous musical score and scenery that I can't even do justice to in this critique.
1570;by far one of the best movies to come out of 2003 in my opinion.
1571;This is a great action movie.
1572;Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe did a fantastic job on this movie.
1573;The Last Samurai is a showcase for Tom Cruise and he does a credible job of portraying Civil War veteran Nathan Algren who is haunted by his role in the slaughter of native Americans at the Battle of Little Big Horn.
1574;He learns to respect the Samurai as he lives among them and learns their ways.
1575;There are lots of battle scenes, but never does this movie touch the emotions of the viewer.
1576;This is an epic film which fails to be a great one.
1577;I believe this was one of the best movies ever made.
1578;This is a great movie!!
1579;Tom Cruise is great and learning things about the Samurai was very insightfull.
1580;Great story of loyalty and coming to terms with your own demons.
1581;aNYWAYS best dang movie of all time 5 out of 5.
1582;I rated The Last Samurai 5 stars because it was the best movie i have ever seen.
1583;It's got it all mad good action, a little comedy, and some romance.
1584;And I liked the movie so much I went to go see it again.
1585;I am going to see it again.
1586;So go see The Last Samurai I garntee you will love it.
1587;The movie really brought out the true beauty of Japanese culture and history, as well as the violence and conflicts.
1588;My older sister, a well.
1589;I recommend this movie to people to have an interest in the Orient and its history and to anyone who enjoys a movie with a touching story, rich in sentiment and that evokes emotion.
1590;Bless you all, thank you!
1591;Lots of action and good story line.
1592;Worth the money and would watch it again!!!
1593;This film is a wonderful exploration of interaction among societies and how the world as a diverse planet can learn from one another.
1594;The film was excellent because it really showed the audience about Samurai life and built on the characters and their ideologies.
1595;Through the intense character development comes the importance of the ending.
1596;Cruise also gave a good performance but as you've all heard, Ken Watanabe steals the show.
1597;Hans Zimmer's score also brought the movie to life as does all of his incredible scores for their movies.
1598;This is a movie that is a little gem, not a masterpiece, but not something you want to throw away.
1599;i must recommend this movie.
1600;It's the best that I've seen this year.
1601;One of my friends who hates when Americans usurp a role that should have been played by a person indigenous to the country the movie was set in refused to see it.
1602;The spotlight is aptly directed at the true last samurai and the actors that play them (and do so excellently).
1603;The Japanese locales that the movie is shot in are absolutely breathtaking .
1604;This is a movie for everyone.
1605;It's unfortunate that some people dont see the true beauty of this film, like me if you are a anime fan you should see it.
1606;The last samurai is great from beginning to end the fight scenes were great and the story and plot was so perfect it's almost unbelievable.
1607;tom cruse did a great job in this movie but the awards should go to Ken watanabe or Katsumoto and the other men/samurai who made this movie great.
1608;This is a great movie.
1609;The rest is a great story.
1610;The poetic resonance of """"The Last Samurai"""" makes it a unique and thoughtful epic where two warriors contrasted by culture are akin in honor."""
1611;Almost poetically and serenely does the movie converge these two characters as one is seeking his lost beliefs and the other is sustaining his honor from an ever.
1612;"the second act of ""The Last Samurai"" is the heart and soul of the movie as we marvel at the ways of the society from the sword training and disciplined lifestyle."
1613;I admire the battle scenes and I do find it the source of the problem.
1614;please finish my review at [.]
1615;Until the ending (which a previous reviewer correctly described as maudlin ), Edward Zwick's THE LAST SAMURAI is a magnificent samurai epic, filled with great big emotions but also blessed with more thoughtfulness and intimacy than the usual Hollywood epic.
1616;The insights into Japan during this particular time setting.
1617;are sure to fascinate, and the action scenes are first.
1618;rate, as is the widescreen cinematography here by John Toll.
1619;he really takes the screen by force.
1620;boy image got in the way of either the epic's grand ambition or the effectiveness of his own performance.
1621;he seemed convincing enough here, although he certainly is upstaged by the sheer authority of Watanabe's performance.
1622;in short, THE LAST SAMURAI is overall a grand and glorious epic that admirably attempts to be more than just pretty pictures and awesome action scenes, and, more often than not, it succeeds in its noble ambitions.
1623;sentimental in the usual Hollywood manner.
1624;"The more one knows about the samurai, the more ""phoney"" this film appears to be."
1625;wielding bullies who enforced the will of the local warlord or Daimyo.
1626;Nonetheless, this film is a good introduction to the CONCEPT of the samurai to anyone who knows little about this complex warrior elite that have come to symbolize the old agrarian Japan that is now seemingly lost in today's technocratic Japan.
1627;Acting is excellent, movie is suspensful and exciting, action is extrodinary.
1628;I honestly can't think of anything that would make the movie better.
1629;The story was excellent and exciting tell the end.
1630;I loved everything about this movie and there is nothing i can critisize on.
1631;Excellent movie, a must see.
1632;This movie got made fun of a lot, but I don't see why.
1633;It's a great story of an American soldier who went to Japan in order to teach their soldiers how to use modern weapons.
1634;He soon fell in love with the peoples dedication, and spirit of tranquility.
1635;i really love this movie.
1636;I'm not a Tom Cruise fan, but he honestly did a great job.
1637;I was moved by the drama, and action portrayed here.
1638;This is one of my favorite all time movies.
1639;I highly recommend it to anyone out there that wants to see a great film.
1640;One of the best Tom Cruise movies.
1641;Great cinematography and some cool costumes are used in this flick.
1642;One of my top 5 favorite movies
1643;This movie was a masterpiece.
1644;I felt it should have deserved more credit for what it received.
1645;One of Tom Cruise's best performances of all.
1646;The most sophisticated warrior of its time.
1647;The scenes shot in the movie were picture perfect and awe.
1648;inspiring for admirers of Japanese culture and Japanese history.
1649;A story of West meets (Far)East.
1650;I recommend anyone to this movie and if you didnt know it will open up a new perception of a people who lived long ago.
1651;i was truly surprised, it was VERY well done, the acting and story line were far more solid then I had expected.
1652;If you like samurai or Japanese culture, you'll love this movie.
1653;But, yeah, like all movies you have to remember it's a movie and made for entertainment purposes only.
1654;Let it entertain you, and it will.
1655;He is ultimately captured by the Samurai, who need him as a source of information about their enemy.
1656;as a captive of the Samurai, Nathan learns the ways of the Samurai and their people, and eventually learns to respect their philosophy about honor and service.
1657;I don't know the first thing about the way of the warrior but this movie is the best.
1658;The action, drama and discreet romance all blended so perfectly in this movie.
1659;I was drawn in from the very beginning and was impressed the whole time.
1660;I am a sucker for a good film score and this one is right up there with some of the best.
1661;After all what's a movie without great music to carry it.
1662;I recommend this movie to anyone in the mood to see some good drama!
1663;I really enjoy this film.
1664;Very solid action, some well choreographed fighting, and it's nice to see Tom Cruise actually performing said choreography.
1665;This epic film has to be one of Tom Cruise's best efforts.
1666;Ken Watanabe's performance was simply outstanding.
1667;Tom Cruise put his heart and soul into this film.
1668;He is such a powerful actor!
1669;He is neither outstanding or poor, but he is effective and unlike other movies where he has overacted (Born on the Fourth of July), he here is stable and is enjoyable to watch (however, his best performances in my opinion is Minority Report).
1670;Ken Watanabe is simply outstanding!
1671;He provides a strong anchor to carry this movie along.
1672;the fight/battle scenes are exceptional and fall a little short in epic style to Gibson's Brave Hart.
1673;"If one can concentrate on the redemption of Cruise's character and the changing of people's attitudes towards each other, then one will come away from this movie with a great experience
1674;the film score works very well.
1675;All in all, this is a good movie with a lot of energy and beauty.
1676;I began this movie thinking that it was just another vehicle for Tom Cruise, but I must say I was pleasantly surprised to find a real movie.
1677;Overall, I did enjoy this film.
1678;It does have some beautiful cinematography.
1679;This leads to a mutual respect and discovery of wisdom for both Nathan and Katsumoto as they both deepen their enlightenment of Bushido.
1680;Last Samurai is a story that fuses Western values with Eastern values, but both value sets are still intact as they merge.
1681;Zwick leaves the audience with a heroic tale about sacrifice, honor, friendship, love, and commitment that offers a noble cinematic experience.
1682;Liked the story line and scenery.
1683;I don't usually enjoy watching Tom Cruise movies, but this was really good .
1684;he did a great job.
1685;Excellent depiction of Japanese culture and the conflict between traditional and modern forces.
1686;This movie held my attention all the way through.
1687;It has a lot of action, but it was well.
1688;intertwined with great drama and cinematography.
1689;The similarities this movie has with Dances with Wolves is intellectually stimulating and welcomes thoughtful discussion.
1690;official mercenary force that goes to Japan to help the pro.
1691;that pretty much sums up the basic storyline of The Last Samurai and while it can be compared with Dances With Wolves, it is more action filled.
1692;the fight scenes are superb and the battle scenes will have you on the edge of the couch.
1693;the characters are believable and throughout the movie you will form attachments to them.
1694;cruise is at his best, while Ken Watanabe is sensational as the samurai fighting for his country's traditions and values.
1695;Timothy Spall also plays a wonderful role as a former British diplomat turned photographer.
1696;the Last Samurai is excellent viewing and will appeal to those who like beautiful photography, a good storyline and terrific battle scenes.
1697;The Last Samurai is a thrilling epic drama set in 1876 Japan, starring Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe.
1698;this is such a beautiful film.
1699;It has lots of battle scenes, but they are balanced by quiet vignettes where Algren learns the language and culture, and begins to take part in village life.
1700;He comes to admire the traditional values of these people.
1701;The overwhelming sense of honor, duty, tradition, and respect fill the story with grace and elegance.
1702;cruise is very good here, but I was even more impressed with the wonderful performance of Ken Watanabe, who plays the title role.
1703;He combined ultimate power and quiet elegance to create a memorable character.
1704;The photography and music make a truly lovely epic.
1705;It is a lovely film.
1706;SPOILERS INCLUDEDTHE LAST SAMURAI is one of the best efforts of Tom Cruise's uneven and strange career.
1707;Watanabe is the true star of this film.
1708;His powerful but understated performance is electric, and Katsumoto's character expresses the best of the Bushido Code and of Japanese tradition.
1709;Algren, the professional soldier, comes to see the Bushido Code and the disciplined lifestyle of his captors as the highest expression of his own art.
1710;the """"Extras"""" disc is an """"Extras"""" disc."""
1711;a vast and sweeping epic in the vein ofBraveheart,Spartacus, andLawrence of Arabia (Limited Edition), THE LAST SAMURAI is an engaging, respectful, and moving tale well worth watching many more times than once.
1712;This movie will almost certainly appeal to persons who like action films and quasi historical epics.
1713;I found the movie generally interesting and entertaining as a movie.
1714;"series and the film ""Dances with Wolves."""
1715;"The ending also reminded me of ""The Charge of the Light Brigade,"" starring Errol Flynn."
1716;"As an action movie i would rate ""The Last Samurai"" four stars."
1717;The Last Samurai is certainly worth watching.
1718;Ken Watanabe is the true last samurai in this film (and was nominated for best actor in a supporting role) All the Japanese warriors in the final battle scene all commit seppuku instead of being captured.
1719;I was very impressed with this movie.
1720;Although the characters were very good and the actors chosen to play the roles did fine jobs.
1721;But it did a fine job of depicting one result of those politics.
1722;It achieved a fairly good balance of allowing the characters to all enjoy an importance in the film that made it more informative and enjoyable to watch.
1723;i was impressed with this film, and highly recommend it.
1724;The Last Samurai is one of this year's best movies!
1725;It is brilliant and poignant, with emotional and brilliant performances by Tom Cruise, Ken Watanabe, and the rest of the cast.
1726;He is offered a job in Japan, where he is going to train the emperor's soldiers.
1727;That he is where he learns about his enemy and gets enlightened by them and decides to stay with them.
1728;Timothy Spall plays Simon Graham, a translator and photographer who is with Algren in this magnificent journey.
1729;This is a brilliant movie with a powerful story and a powerful word about how you look at things and you think at what they should be.
1730;Edward Zwick's directing is brilliant.
1731;The costume design by Ngila Dickson is splendid.
1732;The production design by Lilly Kilvert is incredibly beautiful.
1733;The film editing by Steven Rosenblum and Victor du Bois is excellent.
1734;The cinematography by John Toll is brilliant.
1735;The music by Hans Zimmer is powerful and brilliantly excellent.
1736;The story and screenplay by John Logan, Marshall Herskovitz, and Edward Zwick is emotionally powerful and brilliant.
1737;Go see this movie and it might inspire you and make you think about things in perspective.
1738;"See it before you see ""The Lord Of The Rings: The Return Of The King"" in theaters everywhere."
1739;I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys these kinds of movies.
1740;Even a person who isn't a Tom Cruise fan will probably enjoy it as well.
1741;Good story and beautiful scenery to look at.
1742;Our 11 year old enjoyed it too!
1743;I subsequently read reviews that claimed that it was in fact a great movie, a cut above as it were, and that the movie was sensitive towards Japanese culture etc.
1744;It is essentially a Hollywoodization, regardless of the unique twist to the story.
1745;Lots of action and a gripping plot made this movie seem shorter than it's actual run time of 2 1/2 hours.
1746;As epic movies go, The Last Samurai is a superb one despite any historical inaccuracies which is what the History Channel is for.
1747;All of the big named male actors such as Mel Gibson and Russell Crowe had their epic war movies and Tom Cruise was sorely due for one and in this movie he chose very well.
1748;along with the superior performance given by Tom Cruise, his co. actors in Timothy Spall, Ken Watanabe, Billy Connolly, Tony Goldwyn, Hiroyuki Sanada and Koyuki and so many others added greatly to the overall feel of the movie through their performances which were all of great depth and feeling.
1749;over the years, Edward Zwick has directed some of the finest movies to ever grace the silver screen such as Glory and Legends of the Fall and The Last Samurai serves well to his legacy by being added to his library of exceptional films.
1750;Additional credit goes to Hans Zimmer for the score for this outstanding film.
1751;what follows from there is an exceptional film both in its touching and intriguing story and the extraordinary battle scenes.
1752;I highly recommend this film to any and all fans of films in this genre as they will be highly satisfied with it.
1753;Soon after arriving in Japan the unprepared Japanese regiment is overwhelmed by a highly disciplined force of Samurai fighting to preserve their old customs.
1754;overall I greatly enjoyed the film.
1755;The acting is very good (especially from the Japanese actors but Cruise plays his role quite well).
1756;As usual Hans Zimmer delivers a very good muscial score.
1757;I confess that James Horner is probably my faovrite film composer but Zimmerman does exceptional work as well.
1758;The cinematography and production values are superb (particularly regarding 1870s Tokyo and the main Samurai village).
1759;The Battle scenes are very well coreographed.
1760;There is a memorable scene in which the protagonists face a force of ninja assassins.
1761;the film is for mature audiences as it clearly deserves its R rating during the violent combat scenes.
1762;"The depiction of Samurai culture is very interesting
1763;after much training and eventually engaging in an initial battle against the Samurai, Captain Algren is taken prisoner by the enemy and thrust into the unfamiliar world of a Japanese feudal society.
1764;In the following months of captivity, Captain Algren becomes immersed in the Samurai culture where he eventually adapts to and embraces the sacred code of honor known as Bushido.
1765;respect and dignity, Captain Algren and the Samurai confront the Japanese army in an epic and final battle that will determine the survival or demise of the Samurai warrior class.
1766;i'm of the opinion that this role is not a career best for Tom Cruise but he does come across admirably and carries himself well.
1767;The rest of the cast also performs very nicely and the story holds together for the movie's duration.
1768;The cinematography, costumes, props, and scenery are all quite appealing through and through.
1769;Open field battle scenes are beautifully choreographed and practically rival those of such movies as Braveheart, Glory, and The Patriot.
1770;The second disk in the set offers numerous special features which are both educational and entertaining alike.
1771;The story is strong and keeps you interested during the whole film, while there may not be a whole lot of action, all action scenes are well choreographed.
1772;The acting second to none, the story moving and flawless, the characters deep and passionate, a must see, again and again.
1773;In the months to come Algren embraces the code of the samurai and befriending his savage enemies to soon discover there is nothing savage about honor, duty, and respect.
1774;The Last Samurai [Widescreen] This is a very very good movie.
1775;I would recommended this movie to anyone.
1776;Loved this story and the martial arts, sword techniques!
1777;Has great underlying philosophy and ethics too.
1778;Very well done and of couirse Tom Cruise is dynamic as usual.
1779;Loved seeing the cultural contrast but also the way the two main characters (warriors) complemented each other and learned from each other.
1780;Good movie and one of the best movies i have seen for the the price of 3.99 on black friday.
1781;I just loved this movie!
1782;So subtly moving, and the cast was to die for!
1783;Tom cruise is a great actor, love practically all his movies.
1784;This movie was done exceptionally well, well done!
1785;Well researched historically while still entertaining the audience.
1786;Tom Cruise manages to weave action, suspense and romance together in a manner that will enthrall a wide audience
1787;It is not Lawrence of Arabia but it tells a good story.
1788;the film is brilliant in that way because it allows us to connect our own tainted dreams, hopes and ambitions to Cruise's journey through the higher mindedness of the Samurai.
1789;talk about an amazing transformation and outlook on life.
1790;talk, but this film is amazing in both its depth of character interaction and preciseness of dialogue, through which great thought and resonance is placed upon every scene, every word and every action sequence.
1791;And did I mention the film's intense and pointed musical score?
1792;Yup, Hans Zimmer is back with yet another perfect addition to the film's many strengths and a rousing score that was still buzzing in my head as I washed away the tears of the characters gone by.
1793;And before I forgot about one of the film's greatest attributes, consider its all.
1794;The love affair with Cruise and Taka is sweet but with Blackthorne and Mariko it was detailed, passionate, forbidden and conspiratorial.
1795;The script and Cruise's voiceover explains his love of the discipline and simplicity, which interestingly enough is what seduces Blackthorne.
1796;all in all a nice ride, sufficient enough to take it out of the 'manly men doing manly things' genre and allow you to think.
1797;ken Wanatabe as Katsumoto is excellent and should have won him a best supporting.
1798;Taka is wonderful"
1799;The use of Cruise speaking Japanese was an excellent touch and again, seemed to add credibility.
1800;and the epic scenes are, well, simply put, NOT EPIC.
1801;Really liked pretty Japanse actress, the big fight, and the fact that it is Japan( Every thing good comes from Japan).
1802;This is a cool film.
1803;I bought this movie yesterday, and watched it last night.11.23.10I thought it was a good movie.
1804;Yeah, yeah, I get the fact that this is a war movie, but it takes away from the underlying message.
1805;only redeeming feature is costuming and final message of the movie!
1806;I found this to be a very good and interesdting film.
1807;the goods are very accurate colors and contrast level, black level is also good with ample shadow detail.
1808;All in all it's an above then average discs, and if you like the movie then this is the best it looks right now on home video.
1809;"I enjoyed watching ""The Last Samurai"" again."
1810;It's one of my daughter's favorites and was under the Christmas tree for her this year.
1811;Being part Native American, I found these sequences particularly moving and disturbing.
1812;So for me, Algren's depression that sent him to drink seemed quite believable.
1813;edward Zwick directed the picture and won the Best Director Award from the National Board of Review.
1814;"He has also directed ""Glory,"" ""The Siege,"" and ""Blood Diamond."
1815;Ken Watanabe as Katsumoto shined in this picture.
1816;He demonstrates intelligence, compassion and the rarest of all screen commodities, wisdom.
1817;The final battle sequence is incredible.
1818;He well deserved his Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination.
1819;Sanada has been nominated for five Best Actor awards from the Japanese Academy with two wins including one for his brilliant portrayal inThe Twilight Samurai.
1820;Sosuke Ikematsu does a delightful job as the young boy Higen who tries to be tough like a Samurai, but can shed a tear.
1821;Shin Koyamada is a good looking young actor.
1822;He plays Nobutada who takes a number of arrows on his escape on the bridge and brings humor and determination to his screentime.
1823;Zwick does a nice job of creating a good ensemble with his cast.
1824;in addition to Watanabe's nomination, this film was also nominated for Oscars for Best Sound Mixing, Best Art Direction and Best Costume Design.
1825;"The Japanese Academy awarded it as ""Best Foreign Film."""
1826;As a piece of fictional cinema, it is a tale well told.
1827;This is a great learning tool that I've actually used in a medieval history class that shows the differences between individualistic and collectivist societies.
1828;This Movie by far is the best movie I have ever seen in my entire life!!!!!
1829;Its about damn time they came out with a movie like this!
1830;I give him as well as Ken Watanabe great props!!!!
1831;They are truly wonderful actors and now one of my most favorites.
1832;I cant tell you how great this movie was!
1833;It moved me in sooooo many ways.
1834;Ways as in the movie having parts that were funny, a lot of actions parts, and the best of all the dramatic parts.
1835;That just tells you how more powerful this movie is!!!
1836;It takes you there with all the Japanese Samurais and gives you another perspective on that kind of people.
1837;Leaving the movies had me at a higher respect and a new look at the Japanese culture!
1838;for I give a lot of respect to them and what they've done!!!
1839;This movie has been definitly life changing for me and I recommend it to Everyone!!!!!
1840;it is the best movie in a couple of years.
1841;i loved the Acting, Cast and of course the whole place where it was shot.
1842;I recommend this movie to everyone, awesome movie.
1843;But I was more than pleasantly surprised, but absolutely inspired!
1844;This movie is SO culturally rich, will elegant cinematography, and an amazing soundtrack.
1845;It has several fantastic actors, an interesting and tear.
1846;jerking story line, and all around it is just a fantastic movie!
1847;I would recommend this to anyone!
1848;A very pleasant surprise, Last Samurai, brings to the screen exactly what the title says: Samurai.
1849;tom Cruise, Ken Watanabe, and the rest of the cast, have outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least.
1850;(Ken Watanabe really should have won the Oscar for his part in the movie!)
1851;History, Honor, Battles, and swordfights are all about.
1852;Great dialogue and terrific performances by all of the principal actors.
1853;This was a great movie not because of Tom Cruise.
1854;but because Ken Watanabe steals the movie.
1855;He is fantastic in this film and is an exceptional actor.
1856;He makes the movie worth watching.
1857;The scene at the end is beautifully played by Watanabe and a tearjerker.
1858;There's a cast of thousands and millions of dollars invested in this epic and it will probably pay off for Hollywood.
1859;The theme is an inspiring one too.
1860;soon, Cruise is captured by the Samurai and, learns to respect them.
1861;Ken Watanabe is the Samurai leader who believes in honor and all that other good stuff as compared to the avaricious Americans.
1862;There's excellent cinematography of a Japan that no longer exists and well.
1863;orchestrated battle scenes that are spectacular and bloody.
1864;But it's basically a genre film that cost big bucks.
1865;it's fine escape fiction though.
1866;To me, The Last Samurai is one of the most beautiful movies ever made.
1867;Whether you like Tom Cruise in every movie, this is one of his best efforts.
1868;More importantly, the theme and story of the Last Samurai is worthy of a best picture nomination.
1869;Lastly, the musical soundtrack by Hans Zimmer is fantastic.
1870;This is movie is so great.
1871;He does such a good job to make us feel for his character and care about what happens to him and the samurai.
1872;The action is wonderful and there is no unnecessary romantic scenes like it seems many movies do these days.
1873;It is such a wonderful movie for the whole family and it's dissappointing to see that it wasn't nominated for an Oscar.
1874;I'm not a huge fan of Tom Cruise yet this was a good movie.
1875;One of those movies that makes you ponder the history of the US at the turn of the century .
1876;He is persuaded to travel to Japan to train the army to fight against the samurai, Japan's traditional warriors.
1877;"The Japanese government, motivated by financial reasons, wants to modernize and develop relations with the West
1878;Algren predictably comes to admire the samurai way of life and eventually sympathizes with their struggle.
1879;A woman named Taka (Koyuki) is the inevitable love interest, as the wife of a man Algren killed in battle.
1880;She struggles between her grief and growing fondness for Algren.
1881;perhaps the most effective scene in the film is the last battle, where we see a rapid.
1882;This image is a stark image of modern society mechanically wiping out a less technologically advanced culture.
1883;I think a better portrayal of a similar story can be found in the miniseries (based on a novel by James Clavell) Shogun.
1884;In the same tradition as Dances With Wolves and Braveheart, this historical epic really showed me a world of amazing bravery and a beautiful culture that has found itself dying out.
1885;the story is a classic hero's journey of a man haunted by deeds of his past, who finds unexpected redemption through his involvement with a people whom he at first sets out to destroy.
1886;Taken prisoner by the samurai leader, Katsumoto, he develops a bond with the great warrior and a respect and love for both the Japanese people and the samurai way of life.
1887;the settings in the movie are beautiful, depicting a bucolic and serene Japanese countryside steeped in mystery and tradition.
1888;Even in a moment of fun and celebration they are called upon to defend their people against cloaked assassins.
1889;Still, Mr. Cruise did a wonderful job of showing the inner demons of Nathan Algren and the subsequent transformation that took him from a disillusioned Civil War hero to an honorary samurai warrior willing to lay down his life for a people and a way of life not his own but still worth saving.
1890;i also loved Ken Watanabe, who demonstrated the quiet strength, wisdom and bravery that would have made his character, Katsumoto, a legend among both samurai and the Japanese people.
1891;the only complaint I have is that I would have loved to see the relationship between Nathan and his caretaker, the beautiful Koyuki as Taka, developed.
1892;Perhaps it is simply the romantic in me that would have loved to have seen more.
1893;for a great story, this movie really fits the bill.
1894;Action, intrigue, a tortured hero and a subtle love story .
1895;are all blended together to make for a wonderful experience.
1896;The Last Samurai is one of the best movies I have ever seen.
1897;Although the last scene with the emperor concerning his decision whether to fully open Japan to the West is pure fiction, the rest is generally accurate.
1898;Watching it, you yearn to add these values to your own life, and feel achingly their loss to today's society.
1899;This is the true value of the film .
1900;to raise the samurai once again, in their full glory of life, and the strange glory of their deaths.
1901;Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe are glorious.
1902;Watanabe received a Best Supporting Actor nomination.
1903;I feel The Last Samurai should have received more nominations, and at least one Oscar.
1904;He is now a hero in Japanese legend and culture.
1905;Movies that have some soul.
1906;movies that make you think and feel, all while keeping you entertained.
1907;At this time Japan is a nation undergoing remarkable change.
1908;But Tom Cruise gets captured in the first encounter with the sammuri, and after living amongst these amazing people and learning thier ways, finds his own salvation in thier cause.
1909;the plot isn't very complicated, but is rich in historical context and philisophical themes.
1910;All the charcters in the movies are very well done, and the acting in this film with only a few minor exceptions was absolutley fantastic (especially the portrayal of Katsomoto, which was just a brilliant performance).
1911;This is a movie that you will feel.
1912;You'll laugh, you'll be inspired, you'll be anxious, and you may even get a little watery eyed at some of the more tender moment.
1913;There's martial arts, humor, sword fighting, ninjas, battles, love, philosophy, drama .
1914;The movie has some great action sequences and battle scenes but these are not over.
1915;The movie feels almost poetic at times, and the cinematogrophy is beautifully done.
1916;Many gorgeous shots are in the movie.
1917;And, unlike many movies, the slower scenes don't leave you yawning but are very well done.
1918;all in all this became one of my all time favorite movies the moment I saw it.
1919;Many of the ellements reminded me of a slightly less gritty version of brave heart.
1920;And while Im not sure about the historical accuracy of the plot, the film does an AMAZING job depicting the beauty of japanese culture and the fascinating ways of the sammuri.
1921;wise, the film hit it right oin the nose in terms of accuracy and really got it's points across all while being very entertaining.
1922;paced, I found every last moment of the last sammuri to be a pleasure.
1923;i wouldnt hesitate to call this a masterpiece and the best film of the year.
1924;The Last Samurai proves to be a very entertaining movie although I thought it was bit too long for the story.
1925;Tom Cruise does a good job protraying a guilt.
1926;On the whole, the movie will worked for most people watching it because it gives a very idealistic look at the Japanese samurai culture at its best.
1927;however, most of it proves to be pure historical fantasy at its best.
1928;Both shows how a lone white man surrounded by an alien culture, """"went native"""" so to speak and aligned himself with that culture."""
1929;Both movies introduced these alien cultures through that white man's perception and his inevitable acceptance and entrance to that culture.
1930;In both cases, this was well done and it serves the viewers well.
1931;I really enjoyed this movie, so it was one of the ones I wanted to grow my blu.
1932;I enjoy all the behind the scenes and commentary.
1933;Tom Cruise stars in this wildly entertaining prequel to Nick Castle's THE LAST STARFIGHTER.
1934;My advice to you is to watch this, and any movie you order, as soon as you receive it to make sure its right.
1935;I recommend it to family members of returning war veterans.
1936;It is a great drama of what war and civilization does to a country and world.
1937;It is also a great story about a man's journey to find a place where he belongs and where he can forget about his past and think about the future.
1938;A beautiful thing to behold.
1939;, this is a first class movie.
1940;"One of the all too rare ""blockbusters"" that transcends the cliche."
1941;it is a one of those very rare not.
1942;the best part of the movie is Ken Watanabe, who gives an excellent performance portraying Katsumoto, the leader of the Japanese Samurai.
1943;katsumoto is based upon Saig Takamori, was one of the most influential samurai in Japanese history, who lived during the late Edo Period and early Meiji Era.
1944;saig initially disagreed with the modernization of Japan and the opening of commerce with the West.
1945;Legend and art show that Saig committed seppuku, a traditional form of suicide.
1946;This was Tom Cruise's best movie ever.
1947;This movie is one of the best movie every time you see it.
1948;"I have to admit that I fell in love with LOTR's Ngila Dickson's costumes
1949;That said, this movie is a great movie.
1950;When we see a Tom Cruise film, he is usually the center of the film and always a larger than life character.
1951;The cinematography is beautiful and the story is captivating.
1952;You feel for the samurai and are frustrated with the emperor, and you are actually happy with the way it all ends, in a bittersweet way.
1953;Fully believable, and very in tune with the Japanese culture that I was exposed to while living there.
1954;The main character learned about mindlessness, mindfulness, and other tennants of Buddhism, but overall the main theme of this epic was HONOR.
1955;Honor in living, honor in battle, and honor in death.Young teens and older children could watch this field, because it lacks the graphic violence and sexuality as I mentioned before.
1956;Ken Watanabe and Hiroyuki Sanada were exceptional.
1957;superstar that he is naturally became the focus of every single scene he was in.
1958;See important death scenes for more details.
1959;The editing together of the scenes was pretty good with the exception of the first 8.10 minutes.
1960;The premise of this story is good, by having Tom Cruise as yet another hero type reduces the level of actuality non.
1961;This is the most upseting movie I have ever watched in my life.
1962;And how is it that Taka and her children fell in love with the man that murdered the most important man of their lives.
1963;And people claim this is such an amazing tribute to the Japanese culture.
1964;First off, a person should already be proud of their heritage, and what great tribute is there?
1965;This was one of the most hurtful movies that I have ever watched in my entire life.
1966;A person will never truly understand until it hits them.
1967;I love the music and the story.
1968;Through Watanabe we see that the samurai are noble and intelligent.
1969;Hiroyuki Sanada was impressive as Ujio, the tough, brutal, yet loyal and disciplined Samurai.
1970;this film has amazing sets and battles.
1971;The sword fights are well rehearsed and the cinematography is well orchestrated.
1972;The costumes were striking and good replicas for a period movie.
1973;This film reminded me of Dances with wolves, which I also liked.
1974;Its not about which culture is more superior, it is about our mutual willingness to listen and learn from each other.
1975;I really enjoyed it and it has a good ending.
1976;Best edition out there for the money!
1977;I'm not a fan of Tom Cruise, but I love this film.
1978;I liked the story, the Japanese actors, the costumes and scenery.
1979;This is a great movie to show in history classes.
1980;It's a great tool of showing how Japan was """"westernized."""""""
1981;And give you an idea how the samurai and their families lived.
1982;not only is this a great teaching tool but it's great entertainment.
1983;There's a little humor in it and some serious moments where you can actually learn something about life itself.
1984;this movie has actually sparked my interest in the Japanese history.
1985;modern Japan and the changes Emporer Meiji made.
1986;The second disc has the special features and the inside booklet details all of them.
1987;The best part is honestly the movie.
1988;thank god it goes right to the movie menu just like master and commander.
1989;The movie is just brilliant.
1990;Ken Watanabe is amazing and Tom Cruise gives us just a brilliant performance.
1991;He pours his heart into this role and it shows.
1992;the emotions of the story show and he shines.
1993;It is just beautiful to watch.
1994;the views of the country are breathtaking.
1995;It was closer to bringing that viewpoint to life than even Kurosawa's epics which were influenced heavily by Shakesphere and other western themes.
1996;How he finds peace and honor is another.
1997;the filming in Japan was fantastic.
1998;The Meiji period where foreigners saw Japan as another China full of savages to be conquered is captured quite well.
1999;The Emperor who found himself in a position he was not prepared to handle with advisorsthat took advantage of him is also quite well captured.
2000;A set of characters move around in front of lavishly colored back.
2001;One of Tom's best roles in my option.
2002;Great movie, with very good supporting actors.
2003;The bravery of the samurai, their un.
2004;wavering faith in each other, and their unbreakable will, is portrayed with brilliance!
2005;Both Ken Watanabe and Tom Cruise did an outstanding job in their perfomrances in this movie, though for Watanabe san it was mere rotuine for him since he has regularly played such roles in his native homeland of Japan.
2006;His skills as a Samurai in this movie shined brightly and I was also taken by his english speaking capability.
2007;Tom Cruise also did a very good job in adapting for this role unlike other movies of his.
2008;After purchasing a book about the making of this movie, it explained very well all the details as to what when into the making of this movie from choosing locations, costume design, history of the Samurai and other details.
2009;"In ""The Last Samurai"" she shows that she is able to gain your undivided attention not only by her beauty, but by her presence even if she does not have many speaking roles."
2010;"for those who do not understand the Japanese culture much at all, ""The Last Samurai"" can and will shed some light for you in not only understanding but appreciating the culture as well."
2011;what's up Warner?But don't understand me wrong, I love this Movie.
2012;"it has Bookmarks and a good Extras ""Setup"" ."
2013;i am not a real Tom Cruise fan, but he did a really great job of acting in this movie.
2014;He has watched it a couple of times and enjoys it each time he views it!!!
2015;I'm not much of a Tom Cruise fan, but I love this movie.
2016;Good themes, wonderful sets and costumes, and an overall calm demeanor to the movie makes it very re.
2017;There are few movies I can watch over and over.
2018;He is a very nice looking man and can act fairly well.
2019;That being said, I have enjoyed many of his films and look forward to many more.
2020;I think he did a wonderful performance in this picture, however, even if he weren't in the picture, it could have stood on its own.
2021;Ken Watanabe is a superb actor, not to mention a very sexy man who played Katsumoto.
2022;You won't feel slighted and you will find yourself wanting to watch it again and again despite knowing the ending.
2023;I watched it with my family.
2024;the cinematography is great, especially in all the battle scenes.
2025;The scenes in the village when the samurai are training, and later, when the young archer holds off the ambush, are also beautifully shot.
2026;the attention to detail in the costuming is fantastic.
2027;Ngila Dickson definitely deserves her two Oscar nominations, and could have won for either Samurai or ROTK.
2028;He is such a modern icon that he simply cannot play a period role.
2029;As a movie, this title earns 5 stars, as a blu.
2030;I will cede that the blu.
2031;The Last Samurai is a powerful tale that stays with you.
2032;He is one of the greatest Samurai to ever live and is well respected and loved by his people.
2033;Katsumoto captures Algren after seeing the passion and fire in his eyes during battle.
2034;algren is treated fairly well by the people.
2035;He hates the place at first, but as he lives there and sees the discipline of the Samurai people he begins to accept and love their culture.
2036;He becomes friends with Katsumoto and gains respect from most of the village.
2037;the acting is phenomenal in this movie.
2038;Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe are amazing in their roles as Algren and Katsumoto.
2039;Cruise plays the role with passion and intensity.
2040;He does a great job displaying the change that Algren takes emotionaly and physically.
2041;ken Watanabe really shines in this picture.
2042;He becomes Katsumoto and is amazing.
2043;He's funny, brave, charming, and smart all at the same time.
2044;He deserved the Oscar nomination he received and probaly should have won it.
2045;I'm excited about seeing Ken in the new Batman movie.
2046;edward Zwick really does a great job with this movie.
2047;Zwick has plenty of experience in this area of movies with Glory on his resume.
2048;He shots this movie well and it's all done in tastes.
2049;The fight scenes are shot especially well.
2050;The camera angles are great and we really get a good idea of how the Samurai fought.
2051;Zwick has made a masterpiece.
2052;a lot of people have bashed the ending of the movie.
2053;Algren loved Katsumoto and so did the Emperor so thats why we have that scene at the ending of the well.
2054;I found it to be a powerful ending to a dynamic film.
2055;this is a great movie.
2056;It's so well made and attention is paid in it to the tiniest details.
2057;This movie will stay with you for days and all the good dramas do.
2058;If you like dramas or war films than you must see this film.
2059;If you love Tom Cruise you have to pick this one up.
2060;Don't let Tom Cruise's presence fool you: this is an excellent movie!
2061;The costumes, the music, the acting, they'e all top.
2062;fetched, but the narrative develops the characters so well that you get sucked right in.
2063;It was a wonderful must watch movie.
2064;The screenplay was fantastic, Tom Cruise did a spectacular job in the movie.
2065;I can see that a lot of time and effort went into the making of this wonderful film.
2066;This action packed film keeps you on the edge of your seat and will also tear at your heart.
2067;I will watch this film again and again.
2068;time favorite films), it addresses the Christian themes of atonement, the human desire for heaven, and the value of the traditional family, albeit in a pagan context.
2069;There is also a wonderful scene similar to one in Gladiator that has a main character seeing the beauty of the next world as he dies on the battlefield.
2070;The enduring spirit of master filmmaker Akira Kurosawa is alive and well in Edward Zwick's gorgeous, moving The Last Samurai.
2071;And what a refreshing, vibrant, and even spiritual film this is.
2072;up war hero with skeletons in the closet coming to learn the way of the samurai is a movie done truly in a classic Hollywood fashion.
2073;John Toll's cinematography is tear.
2074;inducingly brilliant in every frame, Hanz Zimmer's lush score proves haunting, and even Mr. Cruise creates a stunning, believable character arc as Nathan Algren, imprisoned by his samurai enemies, but eventually in love with the beauty and the legend of the art.
2075;There were elements of the film I wanted to dislike: Algren's voice.
2076;But Samurai is such an immensely satisfying experience (especially in its quaint, beautiful midsection where Algren comes to accept his destiny as a warrior) that those things become mere quibbles along the way.
2077;It's long, it's epic, it's a tear.
2078;jerker, and the battle scenes are so alive you have to blink twice.
2079;This film caught the flavor of those older films and brought to light the strength and honor of the Samurai that has been lost.
2080;This is a pretty enjoyable movie with a good amount of Japanese history in it.
2081;It's not entirely accurate, but it is still a good film nonetheless, and Tom Cruise does a good job in his role.
2082;The setting of Japan is also done well as well as its Westernization as Japanese citizens either embrace it or fight against it.
2083;Overall a good historical film.
2084;One of the best movies ever!
2085;Avid martial artists who likes stories of samurai and the possibility of what could happen.
2086;Brand new, perfect condition, good price, fast delivery.
2087;This movie is a great story and reminds me that Tom Cruise can be way more the a Top Gun or Mission Impossible kind of guy.
2088;Now if we look around the dressing, make up and efx, we can move into that age in the ancient Japan, and we learn an important message that master Tsu's ever told.
2089;fighting somewhere in the forests of Japan, his army is easily defeated and the rebels capture him and take him back to their village.
2090;Japan is facing a new modernized world and is seeking to keep up with the times by throwing away the traditions of old in favor of a more.
2091;Gaining his sense of honor and redemption back, Algren joins the Samurai and aids them in a fierce battle that decides Japan's history for the rest of time.
2092;the movie does have its dose of action scenes and story moments, but what really make this movie unique are its philosophical moments.
2093;The Samurai, as you know, are people that follow the way of the Bushido, the traditional code of the Japanese samurai, stressing honor, self.
2094;discipline, bravery, and simple living.
2095;It's a tough life, to be sure, but it's the principles of their life that stands out.
2096;"Tom Cruise said it best about the Samurai: ""They are an intriguing people."
2097;I have never seen such strong discipline.
2098;Everything had to blend in for the movie a sense of honesty into the whole project.
2099;the action is wild, but again, had to be realistic.
2100;So realistic, in fact, that there was some close calls on the set.
2101;The fighting sequences also add some depth and insight as to how the Japanese and Americans deal with combat, especially in the climatic battle that had both samurai and soldier confronting each other in the end.
2102;overall, The Last Samurai is worth checking out, especially if you are a student of Japanese history or if you're into everything or anything Japanese.
2103;It's also some of Tom Cruise's best work by far.
2104;Anyone that's a huge fan of Cruise ought to pick up The Last Samurai.
2105;This movie is embarassing to all involved.
2106;This is Hollywood crap, pure and simple.
2107;You want an epic that actually delivers, this is it.
2108;Best use of ninjas in a serious film ever.
2109;Great perfomances by both Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe.
2110;It should have had several more nominations and taken best picture too.
2111;with superb cinematography, as well as excellent sets and costumes that are consistent with late nineteenth.
2112;"century Japan and America, ""The Last Samurai"" is a beautiful, yet tragic film."
2113;The film earned four Oscar nominations: Ken Watanabe for Best Supporting Actor, as well as nominations for Best Set/Art Decoration, Best Sound and and Best Costume Design.
2114;"Overall, I rate the 2003 ""The Last Samurai"" with 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it."
2115;Writer John Logan and director Edward Zwick did an excellent job of creating a plausible story based upon an actual Japanese historical event.
2116;The only redeeming features of this movie are great sets, excellent cinematograpy, and fantastic battle sequences.
2117;And the Japanese actor, who was great and should have won an academy award for best supporting actor (the normally excellent Tim Robbins somehow won for a shockingly poor performance in Mystic River).
2118;drawn as those in Last Samurai.
2119;The Japanese emperor saw that his society was brutally backward and did a magnificent service to his country by becoming modern as quickly as possible.
2120;Many Samurai, upset that their caste system and free lunches were coming to an end, rebelled.
2121;Watch the film if you must .
2122;honestly almost turned it off but Cruise's performance held my interest so I kept watching.
2123;Thank God I did because it really is a good film.
2124;The whole movie is carefully balanced by tremendous action sequences in the middle and final section of the film and the sympathetic Japanese characters (Watanabe, the love interest, the kids etc.).
2125;They are all so believable and easy to connect to.
2126;but the film works people.
2127;It isn't Gladiator or Braveheart but the characters are interesting and compelling, and many of the action sequences are truly suspenseful and entertaining.
2128;a perfect film in my mind which Edward Zwick also directed).
2129;Cruise is one of the best actors out there I've decided after watching this film.
2130;And besides he has done a wide array of roles and is surprisingly transformational.
2131;Don't be jealous 'cuz he's rich and good looking and has worked with some of the best directors ever (i. e. Oliver Stone, Kubrick, Spielberg, Scorsese, Brian De Palma, Tony Scott, Michael Mann).
2132;Lastly, reflective of Hollywood's Eurocentricism, some of the main Japanese characters are played by Asian actors with rather Eurocentric features, especially the actors who play the female lead Taka and her main son.
2133;Cruise is so much of a contemporary man that he usually has trouble making anything other than that believable.
2134;algren is captured by a group of contra Samurai, trying to hold onto their ideal world and while being held captive, learns the ways of the Samurai that he eventually adopts as superior to what he has experienced in his life up to this point.
2135;And in many ways this break from the feudal to the modern in Japan is very much like our break, after the Civil War from an agrarian society to an urban based modern one: from the innocent to the worldly, from keeping things outside our borders to inviting them in.
2136;as a whole, The Last Samurai is breathtaking to watch but the scenes of hand.
2137;hand combat are thrilling: gruesome yet beautiful.
2138;And shamefully, it is a world we will never see the likes of again.
2139;In the tradition of the Shogun miniseries, this movie paints a wonderful picture of life under the Japanese Samurai.
2140;cruise's regiment is easily wiped out by the attacking Samurai and Cruise himself puts up an enormous fight.
2141;As he becomes more skilled with the sword he starts to win the admiration of the Samurai and he bonds with the woman's son.
2142;great directing, action, and a riveting story.
2143;One of the best films Cruise has made.
2144;It's a great action movie, and passable as a drama.
2145;"This isn't because I think he's a bad actor
2146;in other respects, this film succeeds greatly, and masterfully avoids falling into most of the Hollywood traps.
2147;The battle scenes are wonderfully shot, and the setting is excellently delineated.
2148;The emotional interplay between Cruise and his Japanese counterparts is good in most instances, though there are a few moments that falter.
2149;And Katsumoto's final scene is powerful and moving, an excellent note on which to end a movie.
2150;if you can convince yourself to forget that awful piece of filmmaking, however, The Last Samurai has some resonance, a moving story, and compelling characters.
2151;Katsumoto in particular is one of the most interesting characters to come onscreen in recent years, and I cannot stress enough how well Ken Watanabe plays him.
2152;In my opinion, this movie opened my eyes showing me that culture is very important in our society because it protects and prevails our natural rights.
2153;By the way, the most interesting about this movie is that it does not contain sexual scenes most likely others.
2154;check, classic sense, of films like In the Line of Fire, Rob Roy, and so on, a true action film.
2155;Absolutely worth watching and owning.
2156;It is one of Cruises best performances.
2157;I was very impressed by this film.
2158;The characters portrayed much emotion and realism.
2159;This is one of the rare films that the would be bad guys are actually good.
2160;The extras on the second disc were pretty good, I liked the history of the film and the era which it takes place.
2161;This is one of my favorite movies of all times.
2162;I have watched it multiple times over the last couple of years, and always manage to pull something out of it.
2163;The Samurai culture is a bit glamorized, and removed from the actual reality of the past.
2164;This is a cinematic spectacle with lush cinematography and action, as well as a fantastic storyline!
2165;com and ordered it and am happy I did.
2166;It definately makes my top 25 films of all time in a collection of over 7000 titles!
2167;They were expecting a formula based on action, clever plot twists, and more action.
2168;After so many slice and dice 'em samurai movies, this one is a slice way above the rest.
2169;Ken Watanabe starts the movie in deep meditation and having a vision.
2170;His strong centeredness from meditation is carried through the entire film.
2171;This chemistry was special throughout the film.
2172;This is a formula that includes real story telling, action, a demand to stretch your understanding, and more action.
2173;I respect Tom Cruise a lot more now after seeing this movie, and knowing it became a personal project.
2174;Not a big Tom Cruise fan, but I think he did a great job in this movie.
2175;I've always loved Japanese Culture and how disciplined they are.
2176;Kuwamoto lord was a strong Shogun supporter and held up to fight back the modernization of Japan.
2177;This is a Hollywood movie with a matinee idol who has star power to attract audience so that the producers will benefit the mega bucks.
2178;In Aldren's mind, the American Indians and Samurais had a common thread"
2179;A handsome white Samurai was very attractive even those who never seen them before.
2180;Tom's ability to master the Samurai swordsmanship in the movie is just as good as Japanese actors.
2181;Sutle performance by Koyuki(Taka)is so true to the era when the women were second class citizens and did not have any rights of their own.
2182;I strongly recommend the movie, and enjoy it for what it offers to the eyes and senses.
2183;This movie is probably one of the best movies Tom Cruise has starred in as far as a storyline goes.
2184;While it may not be an action movie along the lines of the Mission Impossible series, it is a love story told against the backdrop of feudal Japan.
2185;The scenery is gorgeous and it actually has a plot to the story.
2186;Awesome scenery and well acted, even by Tim Cruise.
2187;Ken Watanabe gives an amazing performance well worth the Oscar nod, personally I feel he should have won.
2188;So much of this was just stunning.
2189;i hope he found peace in the mountains and lived a long life.
2190;If you can accept that about the movie, then you will likely enjoy it.
2191;the thing that makes this movie work so well is the acting.
2192;It is, in my opinion the best I have ever seen Tom Cruise in (admittedly I have not seen all of his movies, so I cannot say whether it is his best performance ever).
2193;His interactions with the Samurai leader played by Ken Watanabe, were wonderful.
2194;"This is really a film where all the actors from the ""main"" characters to the supporting actors all did their job wonderfully."
2195;What I loved about the movie is that very little was done via green screen, and the little that was, was blended in seamlessly so it did not look fake.
2196;For those who like the physical discs there are a ton of extras.
2197;if you can suspend your disbelief and accept the provisos I stated at the beginning then I think you can find this movie enjoyable.
2198;It was very good film.
2199;And Algren grows to respect this imposing man and the ancient traditions of the Samurai that Katsumoto is fighting to preserve in the face of a rapidly emerging modern Japan.
2200;The Last Samurai is a terrific example of what Hollywood does best.
2201;It is a epic of legendary proportions.
2202;It sets the personal stories of a few heroic individuals against a sweeping and beautifully photographed historical background.
2203;It is a great story, but not a realistic one.
2204;It's a grandly entertaining myth.
2205;The characters speak not as real people would, but in moving and thoughtful monologues.
2206;Even when they are speaking to each other, they are actually speaking to the audience.
2207;"life tales like no one else, and ""The Last Samurai"" is epic filmmaking at its best."
2208;scale project that requires that its cast have great screen presence so as not to be lost among the fantastic costumes and sets.
2209;Tom Cruise is adequate here, but Ken Watanabe steals the show as Katsumoto, spiritual and military leader of the Samurai.
2210;His presence on screen is more than up to the film's epic proportions.
2211;I have rarely seen such charisma on a movie screen.
2212;He successfully embodies the concept of the warrior.
2213;I look forward to seeing more of Ken Watanabe in Western films, as well as Japanese.
2214;There are notable supporting performances from Koyuki as Taka, a woman who takes Algren into her home when he is injured and captured, and from Timothy Spall as a British translator.
2215;This is a film that aspires to bring an engrossing and monumental story to its audience before it aspires to accuracy in detail.
2216;The film's Katsumoto is based on the very real Japanese hero Saigo Takamori, who helped usher the Shogunate out of power and restore the Imperial family to power before eventually leading an armed Rebellion against the Emperor on account of the policies of the Meiji Restoration, which instituted sweeping reforms intended to modernize Japan.
2217;The Samurai were politically influential and militarily powerful.
2218;"i highly recommend ""The Last Samurai"" as an excellent example of signature epic filmmaking."
2219;paced story that holds the audience's interest even at nearly 2 1/2 hours in length.
2220;Ken Watanable's performance is thoroughly enjoyable.
2221;The battle sequence is breath.
2222;"It will even appeal to the martial arts crowd
2223;It's a melange of history and fiction, but I see no reason to sweat the details since """"The Last Samurai"""" isn't claiming to be anything more than that."""
2224;The leader of the Samurai, Katsumoto ( Ken Watanabe), is interested in the American culture and wants to keep Algren alive to learn from him.
2225;As time passes, Algren comes to develop a friendship with Katsumoto.
2226;He also comes to embrace the Samurai way of life as well, and trains to become one of them, so that he can fight along side of the Samurai against the Japanese forces that oppose them.
2227;"with the acception of ""Mystic River"", ""The Last Samurai"" was my favorite film of 2003."
2228;For 2 1/2 hours, I was literally glued to the screen, and loving every minute of it.
2229;"In fact, ""The Last Samurai"" is almost better."
2230;They have a deeper sense of honor, and their fighting style is much more deadly.
2231;Director Edward Zick did an amazing job of capturing every aspect of the Samurai culture, from the costume designs and simple way of life, to the weaponry and fighting style.
2232;"The final battle between the Samurai and the Japanese soldiers is the best I have seen since ""Braveheart""."
2233;The Samurai are completely outnumbered, and still manage to put up one heck of a fight.
2234;Tom Cruise gave one of the best, if not the best performance of his career.
2235;The film's soundtrack and scenery are extremely beautiful as well.
2236;"overall, ""The Last Samurai"" is an amazing film."
2237;Every aspect of the Samurai way of life is captured accurately, the performances given by the actors involved were amazing, and the final battle was incredible.
2238;Very insightful and very well written.
2239;Watching the samurai and learning about their values and the culture was really inspiring.
2240;I loved every minute of this movie.
2241;In some ways though I love the ending the most.
2242;He's a melding of two cultures.
2243;"In the last few years, epics have seen an amazing resurgence, climaxing in the classic ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy."
2244;When it does get good, it's breathtaking.
2245;The $120 million production is a visual feast, with beautiful sets juxtaposed seamlessly with sweeping locales in Japan and New Zealand.
2246;The film's visual pedigree is furthured by the wondrous cinematography of John Toll.
2247;time academy award winner, is a master at what he does.
2248;The film is gorgeously shot and the hectically edited battle scenes are given a sense of clarity and extra punch, especially when set to Hans Zimmers' muscular score.
2249;It could have been one of the best epics ever.
2250;Great development of characters and very good insight to the last great honor based society in the world.
2251;There is a lot of violence and blood in the very large and realistic battle scenes.
2252;who should have won an Oscar as well)rebel band of samurai's who are fighting to keep their tradition alive in a time when Japan is looking to become more westernized.
2253;This movie has a little bit of something in it for everyone and I highly recommend it.
2254;Our boys loved it for the action.
2255;My husband and I loved it for the history lessons.
2256;I would recommend it to families that love high action content and yet want a movie that has an engrossing story line.
2257;The scenery and set are the best part of the movie, as are the Japanese actors and actresses.
2258;I enjoyed it both times I saw it on the big screen, but for some reason when I bought and watched it tonight it seemed so much better than the previous viewings.
2259;The love story is classy and not overdone as in most epics and the acting is wonderful.
2260;Tom Cruise delivers his most convincing role to date and this is one of the few parts I actually liked him in (thats saying a lot!)
2261;Very unrealistic and is truly the only part that brings the film down a bit.
2262;Great cinematography and an excellent soundtrack as well.
2263;Based on actual historic events, the Meiji restoration, it does take liberties, but remains overall an interesting movie.
2264;so the ending was nothing spectacular, but better than most scenes because they actually show other people besides tom, and i just don't like movies when the only time they focus on the side characters is when they die.
2265;so with a tad more action and some a better final scene, and an overhaul done to the story to showcase at least one other person besides tommy boy.
2266;it does have a couple of good action scenes and the production value is very high, just don't expect to see a real samurai movie.
2267;Good job in cinematography and fight scenes.
2268;The results are predictably disastrous and Algren is captured alive.
2269;The real man was one Saigo Takamori, who also committed seppuku according to legend.
2270;A good book about the man isThe Last Samurai: The Life and Battles of Saigo Takamori, which is also an excellent read.
2271;tom Cruise puts in an excellent performance, I have to say, as the dysfunctional Algren.
2272;Ken Watanabe is amazing in his protrayal of the samurai rebel leader, Katsumoto, bringing an intensity and depth to the movie that can be lacking in other characters.
2273;the battle scenes are truly amazing, and well shot.
2274;There is enough action and some comic relief to keep everyone pretty well entertained.
2275;The cultural differences between Algren and his Japanese hosts are a source of some amusement, especially as the younger samurai take a liking to him.
2276;despite the predictability of the movie, and the lack of originality in some regards, I thoroughly enjoyed it.
2277;I liked the style, the action, and the plot, and came away feeling thoroughly entertained and somewhat moved.
2278;I just simply liked the movie as overall, well.
2279;To me this movie is purely entertainment.
2280;It has a good story.
2281;It's got great battle scenes.
2282;Some of the acting is excellent.
2283;Far better other actors in the film.
2284;Tom Cruise lends it his star power.
2285;An epic film worth owning.
2286;I just finished watching this movie and loved it!!!!!
2287;In memory of this movie i bought a set of samurai swords because i loved it so much
2288;This is an excellent movie for blu.
2289;The cinematography in this movie is beautiful.
2290;A sweeping and emotional film with powerful images and an incredible storyline.
2291;An incredible story about a man who tries to find his place and ends up pleading his cause to the way of the samurai.
2292;the best part was at the ending.
2293;"This scene told me I was watching probably the best drama film ever made (besides ""The Passion of The Christ"")."
2294;i strongly recommend this film.
2295;This film is an instant masterpiece.
2296;The movie was a solid B. For a movie that Tom Cruise doeesn't have sex with the female lead, it was entertaining.
2297;Disappointing how the movie ended, but that's real life.
2298;One of my favorite films.
2299;The depiction of societal change is first rate.
2300;Hans Zimmers score is perfect for the mood of the film.
2301;It has lots of action and a lovely human story base coupled with excellent acting, which develops into an unusual love story.
2302;I'm not a huge Tom Cruise fan, but he has impressed me in some of his films.
2303;'The Last Samurai' just so happens to be one of those films!
2304;Cruise is excellent here and handles the lead role both physically and emotionally.
2305;I do think that 'Dances with Wolves' edges this one out, but it is a wonderful film all the same.
2306;the film is also beautiful to look with gorgeous scenery and breathtaking battles.
2307;There are a few tiny instances where I smelled Hollywood, but they are so tiny, I can't take away from this impressive film about honor and loyalty.
2308;It's just a beautiful film!
2309;Last Samurai is one of my all time favorite movies.
2310;Of the two movies (both regarded as classics) I personally think Last Samurai is the vastly superior film.
2311;"while it has been billed as an ""action"" film or a ""historical drama"" (both which accurately help describe the movie), The Last Samurai is first and foremost an Epic romance."
2312;"a simple tale that beneath the surface is actually incredibly ""deep."
2313;"First and foremost, the movie is a romance of lofty epic"" ideals: change vs. tradition, friendship, honor, self discovery and self forgiveness, fighting for what you believe in, redemption."
2314;yet he is definitely modernist.
2315;he truly believes that bringing American power to the less civilized nations of the world is the right thing to do.
2316;the true hero in the Last Samurai is the antithesis of fear, the romanticized ideals of hope, friendship, honor, self discovery.
2317;"At its core, the Last Samuari it is about the spiritual changes that come over two men who fight to preserve the ""old ways"" (which they see as a culture of discipline, respect, beauty, and communal solidarity in jeopardy of being overrun by ravenous forces of corruption and greed)."
2318;the acting is amazing, the cinematography breathtaking, and the musical score beautiful.
2319;The movie is filled with individual scenes of incredible power that rank among the greatest ever put on film: for example, the scene where Taka dresses Algren for battle is an example of cinematic PERFECTION.
2320;not a word spoken, yet so much emotion conveyed.
2321;"The last line of the film (narrated) is one of my favorites of the entire film with Simon Graham philosophically concluding that Algren may have at last found a small measure of peace ""that we all seek, and few of us ever find."
2322;It definitely isn't a perfect film, but for some(like myself)it's an immensely powerful film and its spiritual depth and beauty far outweigh its flaws.
2323;It's one of the few films that I can watch any time.
2324;Algren: There is Life in every breath.
2325;a perfect brother film to DWW (Dances with Wolves)
2326;I agree with most of the other reviewers.
2327;This movie is an excellent, touching, and soon to be classic movie.
2328;The director does a good job, and this is one of the rare movies of 2003 that makes sense unlike Matrix or Terminator sequels.
2329;I recommend this one as a resolution for '04!
2330;What can i say but an all action film just brilliant tom should win an oscar.
2331;well, when Tom Cruise ends up captured by the Samarai enemy.
2332;throughout the flim, the plight of the Samarai is contrasted with that of The Native Americans in the United States.
2333;One example of this is the depiction of Emperor Meji.
2334;"it is worth noting that the Samarai make a ""successful"" last stand only because they have the help of a white Westerner."
2335;There is a terrific sound track that compliments the phenomenal camera work and first class acting by all the cast.
2336;the battle scenes and the fights are so good I found them spell binding.
2337;the suppressed emotion between Algren and Taka which turns from hate to love was beautifully done.
2338;A suitable label for this production.
2339;This movie was very very good.
2340;I did not think tom was a great person for the part, but when i saw it, he did fantastic.
2341;This movie is easily one of the best films ever made.
2342;One thing is that the movie keeps people interested.
2343;This movie should win the oscar awars easily becuase it is the best movie made.
2344;The Last Samurai in my opinion is the best movie made in 2003.
2345;It has better action and battle sequences.
2346;It really gives you a feeling that you are there experiencing the war.
2347;I don't care what people say, Tom Cruise does just fine as a samurai.
2348;Insomuch as the movie was not designed to be a historical account of what happened during this period in Japan, rather an interesting, beautiful work of fiction in the form of a movie, I liked it.
2349;This is an amazing movie especially after watching the special features afterward.
2350;The collection of Japanese actors and their intense desire to be a part of this film.
2351;Visually beautiful with an insite to the Japanese culture.
2352;Very entertaining on several levels.
2353;"We are huge fans of Japanese historical films and samurai epics (""Seven Samurai"" being the Valhalla of the genre)so we lined up early to see ""Last Samurai."""
2354;But Watanabe steals the movie and the supporting cast is terrific.
2355;in the end, the movie is a spectacular paen to Bushido culture.
2356;But heck, its the action scenes which are worth enduring Tom Cruise, and I sure liked watching him get pummeled by Watanabe's No. 2.
2357;"In this respect, it has a strong similarilty to ""Dances With Wolves"", not only for its worshipful depiction of a dying culture, but favoring the twilight over the end."
2358;especially on a big screen.
2359;The noble white man comes to the tiny idyllic remote village and is reformed and turned to the way of bushido by the kind and benevolent natives who come to respect him too.
2360;And on top of that, he manages to change the mind of the emperor!
2361;there are some redeeming qualities, which include Ken Watanabe's excellent performance, and the beautiful and lush scenery/clothing which was relatively authentic.
2362;but the set pieces were very well researched)If you want a film with substance, start checking out films from people actually from Japan.
2363;This is a great movie.
2364;It is well made and well acted and gives the viewer a glimpse into the culture that formed the foundation of Japan.
2365;A pretty good movie actually.
2366;If you have never seen this movie, watch it.
2367;I promise you will not regret it, as it is very nearly a cinematic masterpiece.
2368;I was captured by the strong similarities between Samuari culture and Native Americans back in the day.
2369;The use of horses, bow and arrow, weaving, agricultural lifestyle, respect and honor.
2370;Portrayed romanticized life of Samurai with great action scenes and beautiful cinematography.
2371;This movie was easy to enjoy.
2372;highlight was Lord Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe), a samurai who envisioned a powerful animal while meditating.
2373;Similarly, with Native tribes of the Americas, dreams or visions were also very powerful.
2374;"As their encounter develops into respect, Algren becomes a student of Katsumoto's people with curious intrigue, he learns their philosophy, their way of life and a peacefulness that he referred to as a ""deep reservoir of spirit""."
2375;algren's flashbacks to his battle fought with Custer lends historical accuracy to an important part of U. s. history and occurs throughout the movie until his friendship with Katsumoto reaches a level of trust, respect, and compassion.
2376;Enjoyable movie, wonderful Japanese cast: kudos to a fine actor, Ken Watanabe for putting self into his character that made me believe in Katsumoto, a man of integrity and honor.
2377;musical score was absolutely beautiful!
2378;The Last Samurai has all the right ingredients of a modern day masterpiece, it's ultimate flaw however is it's too predictable Hollywood components.
2379;"When Algren is captured, he learns and eventually adopts the way of the samurai
2380;That aside though, the Last Samurai is still a great film, and Cruise and Watanabe are brilliant when both share the screen.
2381;All in all, despite it's shortcomings, the Last Samurai is a wonderful film.
2382;I liked everything about this film"
2383;I'm fascinated w/ Japan, and know enough of the history to realize this film was very well researched.
2384;This is a great movie, it has everything to please anyone.
2385;I liked this movie a lot.
2386;I felt inspired and proud as to how the samurai are portrayed in this film .
2387;I feel its an accurate portrayal of their mentality and actions.
2388;large scale and beautiful to say the least.
2389;the japanese actors were all fantastic.
2390;making the film even more authentic.
2391;Tom Cruise is believable as a courageous leader and soldier.
2392;"overall a good movie and it will get you ""pumped"" after you see it ."
2393;the film provides a sample of a Japan that has newly opened itself to the Western World, with tradition and new ways having an uneasy relationship.
2394;it is possibly one of Cruise's best performances of the 2000's, and the movie narrative is rich with action and meaningful story.
2395;"The Last Samurai is, without a doubt, one of the finest action epics thatI have seen ever since ""Braveheart""!"
2396;The Last Samurai is one of those rare films that combine a sweeping, heroic epic with an intimate, extremely poignant personal story of love, honor, and tenderness.
2397;"The direction of Edward Zwick (""Glory"", ""Courage Under Fire"") was top."
2398;"And the performance of superstar Tom Cruise (""Minority Report"") was unforgettable!"
2399;"Surely one of the best Tom Cruise performances since ""Top Gun""!"
2400;The samurai lord, Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe), is impressed with Algren's magificent fighting spirit and resourcefulness and decides to nurse him back to health so that he might learn more about his enemy.
2401;He soon allies himself against his former compatriots and must learn what true honor is and how both life and death can help one reach his destiny.
2402;the film started like a Tom Cruise movie, stopped being one for a fascinating hour or so, and then returned to its Hollywood roots.
2403;Thank goodness for the strength and charisma of his co. star, Ken Watanabe as Katsumoto.
2404;Watanabe is as focused and economical an actor I have seen in some time and manages to communicate more rage, love, or concern in a steely glance than Cruise can with a monologue's worth of bluster.
2405;Cruise is at his best here when he's 'listening', when someone else is driving the scene.
2406;The Last Samurai is beautifully filmed, and like two of director Ed Zwick's own definitive films .
2407;"In conclusion, ""The Last Samurai"" not only has two unforgettable performances by Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe, but also a fine supporting cast including Timothy Spall, Billy Connolly, Tony Goldwyn, Koyuki, and William Atherton."
2408;The Last samurai is an epic about a drunken military man who agrees to train the Chinese with modern day weapons, while fighting for the Chinese he is somehow on the other side, the Japanese.
2409;As he trains to become a warrior, a Samurai, he learns honor, a most of all what he didn't seem to have before, pride.
2410;I like this movie, but I found some things about it dissapointing.
2411;first, lets get to the good things .
2412;the storyline wasn't anything special but the way the movie was done was amazing .
2413;the scenery was beautiful and a lot of the acting was really good.
2414;I'm also happy when I see asians in movies where they are actually acting because it's very rare that asians get casted as major roles in major movies in the US.
2415;more specifically, Katsumoto and his son were very good and the little boy that takes a liking to Tom Cruise was so cute and a very good actor, especially for someone of his age.
2416;this movie was very touching in many ways.
2417;I loved the ending and the climatic scene.
2418;It was all very well done.
2419;despite it's flaws though, and my personal problems with it, The Last Samurai is a good movie worth viewing at least once.
2420;Just a really well done movie.
2421;This has it all: an epic scale, a love story, outstanding soundtrack, and fight scenes.
2422;Watch the movie and you'll see what I mean.
2423;It's amazing what long hair on a guy and losing the whole Scientology thing can do for a person.
2424;You'll walk away from it with a greater vision of life.
2425;Even if you think Cruise is a weirdo, it's worth checking out.
2426;These words are just added so I can hit the submit button.
2427;i thought it was an intesting twist how it took a outsider to convince the young emperor to make the stand he made at the end.
2428;It's as though they saved the best for last.
2429;It is an act of honor.
2430;You see this in the modern world today.
2431;There is much shared between the two cultures, and Algren learns to adapt to the Samurai way of life.
2432;For example, Algren stays with the Samurai for almost a year, honing up on his skills and learning Japanese.
2433;When he is returned with safe conduct back to the modern area, he is received among a flurry of rapid and liberal changes.
2434;The army has uniforms, is extremely well.
2435;Again, good movie, good entertainment, but also great clashing in cultural tradition.
2436;She allows him to wear her husband's Samurai armor, and they kiss.
2437;Clearly a Romantic movie about non.
2438;"conformity and fighting for the conservative and traditional values of an antique heritage, the narrator describes how the ""American Captain's"" history after that was a legend, listing some beliefs."
2439;As he enters the town, Taka sees him and smiles.
2440;It is entertaining, there is a hint of suspense, and there is an excellent use of symbols.
2441;Overall, you we be entertained.
2442;Those who think this good are real suckers.
2443;Before he has had a chance to do his job properly, he is called upon to lead a well.
2444;algren eventually rises to enjoy great respect and admiration among Katsumoto's people, becoming in effect the samurai lord's right.
2445;overall, I found this to be a very enjoyable and moving tale of the clash of cultures, somewhat loose in its historicity, with a strong emphasis on concepts like valor, honor and independence.
2446;I feel thsi is a better moive than Lord of the rings the Return of the king, the best movie i have ever seen.
2447;I thought the movie was good, and the japanese were very authentic.
2448;The movie is good with a plot, but as I said, the producers didn't think of how historically accurate this movie was.
2449;The overall movie had a plot and was very well made, and it seems like they put in a lot of time for every scene, just to make you feel immerssed in the culture.
2450;Despite the gross inaccuracies concering the depiction of the Satsuma rebellion, I very much enjoyed this movie for its likable characters, honest portrayal of human relationships, and laudable themes.
2451;it's a bit long, but it's worth it
2452;Edward Zwick directs this 2003 film on a historical incident involving an American military advisor sent to Japan to modernize and train the ruling emperor's forces in 1876.1877.
2453;this was a good story that just never seemed to soar.
2454;in conclusion, the film is decent but comes far short of the epic it could have been.
2455;Brilliant performance not only from Tom Cruise but also from other Japanese actors actress.
2456;The Samurai's Bushido will really make you feel intense.
2457;Movie is on the disc one and lots of extra goodies can be found from disc two.
2458;Overall, excellent film, rich features!
2459;I'm normally not a Tom Cruise fan, but this movie was excellent!
2460;His acting was good and I loved how they showed the Japanese culture.
2461;This movie stirs you in a profound way.
2462;Ken Watanabe should have one an Oscar for this performance.
2463;The clash of cultures is done well, and for a change, the Western observer of the culture is a dispirited alcoholic who has lost his way in life.
2464;the themes have great application to daily life.
2465;the modern world really makes you wonder if we will ever return to a time where a man's fundamental character is used to judge him .
2466;enjoyed the Samurai legend and thescenery and the evolving on Tom Cruise's characterand the story line
2467;imagine again, that within 6 months, he has learned everything there is to know about being an American, and has embraced the American culture and now becomes a leader in the fight against his own countrymen.
2468;"So dedicated is he to his new ""family"", that he even goes into battle wearing your dead husband's uniform."
2469;This is an awesome movie, by far my favorite from Tom Cruise.
2470;I recieve the movies in a good time and loved having it ever since.
2471;This is a wonderful movie.
2472;i recommend this movie to all.
2473;It's one of his favorite movies.
2474;I'm not sure why he likes it so much, but I know he appreciates the historical significance.
2475;The Last Samurai is an inspiring, artistic, touching movie.
2476;It even manages to stay pretty close to the historical facts it's based on.
2477;the premise of the movie is anything but new, even so, it's a unique production.
2478;It offers insight into the japanese culture and we, the audience, take it in through the senses of the main character, Nathan Allgren [Tom Cruise].
2479;We learn about the samurai, honor, trust, pursuit of perfection and harmony, discipline and tradition, all adjectives that make Japan what it is today.
2480;the last scenes of the movie could have definitely done well without the typical hollywood dramatic dialogue and action.
2481;It was a bit over the top compared to the rest of the movie which was realistic and down.
2482;Absolutely brilliant, the tracks are a combination of japanese traditional music and western music.
2483;It's one of the few titles I would enjoy watching again once in a while.
2484;The noble past with true ability versus modern 'get along' technology and number.
2485;ray discs in addition to being an enjoyable movie.
2486;Tom Cruise is excellent, but Ken Watanabe is outstanding!!!!
2487;It's a great piece of fiction based on some historical facts.
2488;When I watch a movie that I enjoy, I'll watch it many times with months in between to allow it to breath.
2489;Such is my finding for this exceptional movie.
2490;It offers up a wide variety of important, even vital, lessons of life portrayed to perfection by everyone involved.
2491;The writing, directing, acting, locations, depth of meaning are all most excellent!
2492;In today's world we often race by the more subtle and beautiful aspects of life.
2493;A movie such as this calls forth pause and consideration of what is being served up for our enlightenment as well as our enrichment.
2494;The Last Samurai is about the redemption of humanity as well as the individual.
2495;the awakening to a deeper level of life, honor, purpose, self sacrifice, and pure, love.
2496;While watching this film for perhaps the 7th time, I fully realized that it is a true masterpiece.
2497;I suggest to the viewer, that they treat this film as one would a rare and fine wine.
2498;"The point is to take your time with this film, sipping it slowly and savoring every drop of it's wonderful bouquet of thoughts and emotions, and in the end become enriched by an understanding what films have the potential of delivering and sadly also, what they seldom do and that is a fuller appreciation of ""life in every breath."""
2499;How great can it get?
2500;If you liked Braveheart, you'll love this movie!
2501;Still a good movie but that should sum it all up.
2502;I don't like Tom Cruise but this movie is great.
2503;The story is great, as are the visuals and the acting.
2504;Tom Cruise does an amazing job in this film, a look at the Samurai and a touch of history.
2505;The acting is impressive, world intriguing, and a story that will draw you in looking for more.
2506;recommended for anyone who enjoys history, samurai, fantasy, or if you are just interested in a bit of Japanese back story.
2507;An excellent action movie, with an interesting point of view.
2508;"The other performances are also fantastic
2509;(They should have an Academy Award for """"Best Casting"""""
2510;but the eyes, body movements, and lighting speak to us in soft tones.
2511;"the Japanese actress KOYUKI (who plays ""Taka"", widow of the warrior Cruise kills in battle near the beginning) is BOTH fantastically beautiful and a most subtle and superb actor."
2512;This movie is a MUST!
2513;One of my favorite movies.
2514;I am not sure of the historical accuracy so I treat it as fiction and never regret watching it.
2515;i'm not a Tom Cruise fan but concede he makes some good movies.
2516;I probably watch this movie every 1 to 2 years.
2517;The presentation of the disc is superb and for a movie enthusiast like myself, I appreciate knowing the thoughts of Director, the cast, the process, the location, the designs of costumes and the set, and so forth.
2518;This disc collection has got them all.
2519;It's wonderful to note that some of Japanese actors and actresses in the movie played a significant role by assisting the Director, Zwick in understanding the protocols and behaviours of the past when Samurais roamed Japan.
2520;There's a tremendous respect between the Japanese and the production crew as they assisted one another in bridging the cultural gap enhancing one another's performances.
2521;I have enormous respect for Tom Cruise as he's a focused and dedicated actor.
2522;Anyhow, this movie is very well.
2523;"done as the production crew took the best element from their location shots particularly in those old shrines in Himeji Kyoto, Japan
2524;Japanese cast is superb namely Ken Watanabe who lost out on Oscar's Best Supporting Actor Award.
2525;The documentary about samurais in the second disc is very informative.
2526;At the end of the day, it's a bit of both.
2527;Still, we have to come to terms that time changes everything.
2528;made and touching movie that shouldn't be missed.
2529;I'm pretty tired in the evenings and this took about 3 days to watch!The acting is good and the battles and sword fights are great.
2530;I'm really surprised it was even made.
2531;office hit and factually inaccurate, I love this movie and would definitely put it in my top 10 favorites of all time.
2532;ray disk to see the difference for myself.
2533;The colors are much more vibrant, the clarity is remarkable and it serves to submerse you in a movie that was already great as it was.
2534;In The Last Samurai, director Ed Zwick creates a beautiful epic that alternates wildly between almost over the top and just perfect.
2535;soldier Nathan Algren, does finally triumph, returning a solidly intimate performance.
2536;His interactions with the people of the remote villiage where he is kept, half prisoner half patient, are both touching and extremely pleasant to look at.
2537;Each face fills the screen just long enough to give us riveting portraits that are at once immediate and deep.
2538;it is thanks to such artistry that when the final battle comes, with its emphasis on process rather than product, we believe and care about what happens.
2539;certainly this film is worth watching more than once.
2540;the story of sacrifice seemed a lot more compelling to me in this movie than in Braveheart (who doesn't like Braveheart).
2541;I also really enjoyed being familiarized with the history and tradition of the Samurai (from other reviewers, I understand that the accounts are fairly accurate).
2542;i appreciated the authenticity of the characters and how the movie stayed true to the Japanese culture.
2543;the movie did a great job of utilizing Cruise to familiarize the movie goer with traditions that we might not have understood by introducing the values of this society through the eyes/values of someone the movie.
2544;the visuals in this movie were excellant.
2545;The movie had me hooked up until I heard this spouted from Cruise's mouth.
2546;One of my favorite movies.
2547;I'm not a Tom Cruise fan, but this movie is packed with a lot of action, great story line, strong characters, great acting.
2548;Ken Watanabe is a favorite actor of mine.
2549;If you like a really good story, this is the movie for you.
2550;but in this movie you can say, """"look this guy can be a good actor""""."""
2551;However, Mr. or Mrs. Purist, it certainly serves as a decent introduction into the Samurai film genre!!!
2552;"It really is ""Dances with Wolves"" with Samurai!"
2553;"Nevertheless, it still was a good film despite a lack of originality and the usual ""clich 's"" of honor, loyalty, integrity and love."
2554;Its good family fare and I hope will provoke interest in some of the other Samurai films (which usually are poor family fare).
2555;The action sequences are tightly and neatly done.
2556;Despite this, the fights were still entertaining, just far and few between!
2557;The good was the attractive performance Wantanabe gives.
2558;He appears to be enjoying the role and that is always infectious!
2559;Every time he stepped into a scene, his being TOM CRUISE detracted from the moment and his decent performance.
2560;The extras are fairly generous.
2561;Instead of expert analysis, we got a fairly informative and slightly inaccurate historical overview on Samurai history.
2562;The rest of the extras are informative if a little on the short side.
2563;Obviously, there are plenty of fine Samurai films to watch but not all of them are easy to come by.
2564;Here is small but decent list:Older.
2565;Tom Cruise is one of our favorite actors and this one of favorite movies.
2566;It's good to have these in our library to watch again and again.
2567;now I understand that this movie is literally a rice queen's dream come true.
2568;Once we question the realism of a man being able to master a form of martial arts in a few months, we begin to question the success rate of whether we, can indeed go around killing men if we want to sleep with their wives.
2569;The photography was good and the acting wasn't bad.
2570;all in all, I thought it had great potential.
2571;I gave it an extra star because it came close to capturing how horrific war is, especially when one side is over.
2572;armed, and the other has, only honor.
2573;What place do these hold in life and all it encompasses.
2574;"Warner Bros. ""The Last Samurai"" attempts to depict the epic and time age tale of traditional norms versus a new and modernizing society."
2575;The skilled and experienced samurai easily overpower the unpolished army and take Cruise as their prisoner.
2576;Cruise eventually grows to love the simplicity and stillness of the samurai way of life.
2577;"He adopts the concept of Bushido (Japanese for ""way of the warrior"")
2578;Over the course of a year he learns samurai ways, their fighting methods, and even eventually begins to learn their language.
2579;But when his new found life is threatened by the old, he chooses to fight with the men he once considered his enemy.
2580;And while Cruise's performance is exceptional even he cannot take precedence over the grandeur and scope of what """"The Last Samurai"""" does symbolize."""
2581;"asian actors Ken Watanabe (Katsumoto), and Koyuki (Taka), play their roles brilliantly
2582;Katsumoto, is a proud, thoughtful, and an integrible samurai leader.
2583;For more than 900 years he and his ancestors have protected the ways and honor of his people.
2584;He and Cruise periodically converse in philosophical meetings sprinkled with humor.
2585;Taka shines as Cruise's caretaker.
2586;perhaps one of the more historical points is the weakness of the Japanese Emperor, Meiji, played by Scichinosuke Nakamura.
2587;But this is portrayed in more of a symbolic matter throughout """"The Last Samurai."""
2588;"Both the complexity and simplicity of The Last Samurai,"" enjoy ubiquity throughout the film."
2589;With every scene there is a sense of duty and honor, while there is at the same time enjoyment in the stillness of life.
2590;"And while these aspects may have lended something to the movie, simply enjoy it for what it is
2591;after the movie was over and the credits began their usual scroll, I noticed that nearly half the people in the audience sat there while the other half stood and enjoyed the music.
2592;I am no movie critic, just as no one else who writes their own user reviews on this site is but in many ways, we are more important than the world.
2593;as a mere movie fan, I feel as if every actor who achieves greatness has their definitive film that catches my attention and convinces me that they are more than I bargained for.
2594;Despite their inability to perform, the new Japanese army marches into battle prematurely and amidst a stampede by the samurai, he is captured alive.
2595;the acting by the entire cast is superb.
2596;One of the finest ways that this is captured is the poetic and ballet.
2597;esque motion of the battle sequences.
2598;It is instead a great, epic film about a culture that was driven into the annals of history and all but forgotten about.
2599;the total package includes a supplement disc containing a virtual well of special features that take you on a stunning detailed ride behind the camera with interviews, historical comparisons, costume and set designs and training for battle sequences.
2600;A package this superbly concocted is a crime to ignore.
2601;Loosely based on a real person, it gives a glimpse into the early years of the Meiji period in Japan.
2602;The action is way above average.
2603;As a bonus, there is a peek into the slaughter of native americans by encroaching modern civilization.
2604;I highly recommend this movie.
2605;I find it very entertaining.
2606;The captain is free to move thru and observe the village and thru much trial eventually learns to respect their ways.
2607;He and the tribal leader, who is well educated and actually speaks some English, become close friends learning from each other while coming to honor their mutual ways and values.
2608;The Captain carries his message of honoring the values and traditions of the Samurai and their importance to the history and culture of the people to the young Emperor and it is in death where the rebellion achieves victory.
2609;This is a wonderful film, well acted, with a well written script, filmed in a magnificent location (New Zealand i think).
2610;This move has great action, great cinematography and good acting and story.
2611;the costumes are excellent and there are ninjas too!Overall it is easy to enjoy this film if you are not dogmatic.
2612;It's one of the most powerful Hollywood epic dramas.
2613;I also am impressed by the great acting of the supporting cast, such as Katsumoto's son.
2614;His performance was very good indeed.
2615;When Tom Cruise was captured in his village, we saw a kind, innocent and pure boy.
2616;When he was helping his father to escape, he became brave and determined.
2617;The diverse sides of this young man were well handled by the actor.
2618;i truely think Tom Cruise is a great actor.
2619;His acting is getting better and better, unlike some actors/actresses who never improve themselves but merely depend on their good looks.
2620;conclusion: A breathtaking movie and performance.
2621;I saw this movie in the theatre and loved it.
2622;action, drama, history, it had it all.
2623;Tom Cruise was excellent, oscar worthy in my opinion, but the costars also gave powerful performances.
2624;Just as the ocean has shallow ends and deep ends, The Last Samurai is a film whose story, in part, lies on the surface and also lies, in part, deeper beneath the surface.
2625;At face value, you will find a tale about an old world culture (the Samurai culture) clashing with a rising, powerful modern culture (Western culture).
2626;In fact, the story and setting in and of themselves are merely a convenient backdrop for which to convey its actual message"
2627;He is a troubled and tormented man who is haunted by tremendous guilt, brought on by his experiences fighting and killing American Indians circa 1876.
2628;He is generally lauded as a hero around the US, ironically admired for the very actions that precipitate his self.
2629;Still present are the post.
2630;His acquired inclination toward the excessive consumption of libations notwithstanding, he does his best to cope, however unfruitful his efforts may be.
2631;although he has been begrudgingly following orders to this point, he nevertheless has done his best to fulfill them dutifully.
2632;Algren, ever the fearless warrior, stands his ground with a ferocious vigor, showing tremendous valor and honor in displaying that he will fight until his last breath.
2633;It is here that Samurai elder and leader, Katsumoto notices Algren's impressive will to fight to the death.
2634;Indeed, Captain Algren experiences the personal growth and enlightenment that changes lives and raises one's consciousness above darkness and despair.
2635;"it is during this portion of the story that the ""meat"" of the movie lies."
2636;"The Samurai's life is a simple one that focuses on virtues espoused by The Samurai Way
2637;Much of the village's daily life in this movie is summed up quite well by that maxim.
2638;Fast paced, rather emotionally detached, and primarily concerned with wealth, true happiness and peace.
2639;Artificiality has no home there"
2640;the Last Samurai is a fantastic movie with a profound message and beautiful cinematography.
2641;notch, as Cruise and Ken Watanabe (Katsumoto) pull off a magnificent performance with excellent chemistry.
2642;I certainly was, and I liked it so much that I intend to view the film several times more.
2643;great movie and came in good timing if you like samurai and history but not tom cruise you will probably still like this movie
2644;Great story, likable characters, and one of my favorite films from the action genre.
2645;If you haven't seen this movie give it a shot!
2646;The message is one of service and sacrifice.
2647;The filming is beautiful, the sets very realistic and the costuming is spot on.
2648;note the subtle colours of the kimono's, true to the era.
2649;a brilliant piece of casting.
2650;Director Edward Zwick continues to make emotional, epic films.
2651;Tom Cruise is in fine form here yet I feel the real stars are the Japanese actors.
2652;his message about the Cherry Blossums after a spectacular battle leaves a lump in one's throat.
2653;Koyuki Kato is a lovely, spiritual Taka and the entire production deserves far more praise than it received.
2654;The Hans Zimmer soundtrack fits beautifully.
2655;it is both heroic and moving.
2656;it is very spiritual, zen.
2657;I went to see this film in the hopes of seeing some good action and perhaps a bit of engaging plot concerning the history of modern Japan, and I'll admit, I was not disappointed.
2658;My overall effect, upon walking back into reality, 127 years later, was one of feeling good.
2659;This is pretty much what we expect from American cinema, and thus, they've made it.
2660;As other reviewers have said, this film has gorgeous scenery and remarkable attention to visual historical detail such as costume and architecture.
2661;anyone who knows anything about the history of Japan knows that the samurai were essentially feudal warlords.
2662;But modern weapons win and the honor of fighting is lost.
2663;I really loved this movie.
2664;The story itself sparks an interest in Japanese and Samurai warrior history.
2665;A lot more of the movie was spoken in English than I was expecting.
2666;The swordfights are really realistic and graphic.
2667;There was a fairly decent number of parallels with Dances with Wolves.
2668;A lot of reviewers wax philosophical as they describe their reasons for disliking the movie .
2669;I'm pretty well read with friends of all ethnic origins, and I enjoyed this movie thoroughly.
2670;it's a simple story about a man's struggle to belong and regain his honor through helping others.
2671;Tom Cruise did his usual good.
2672;The real star of the movie is the allure of a simple life.
2673;But one day in battle, he is wounded and captured by the enemy.
2674;The strength and determination Algren shows in defending himself against the samurai fascinates the leader of the samurai, Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe).
2675;"the lowdown:Edward Zwick, who made ""Glory"" directs this film with the eye of an artist."
2676;"The entertaining film moves at a brisk pace, and it is always fascinating to watch Algren's character change as he sees another world in a village perched high on a mountain in supposedly ""enemy"" territory."
2677;The film's beautiful colors and long shots, brought to life by the great John Toll (Thin Red Line), takes us to a world of another day.
2678;"The other highlight is the score by Hans Zimmer, one of my favorite composers (Black Hawk Down, Thin Red Line, etc.) These two technical aspects help the film a great deal, and help draw us into the conflicting worlds of old Japan and new Japan
2679;The vivid imagery brings to mind the great films of Kurosawa"
2680;Tom Cruise does a fine job in the role of Algren, though I think another actor would have been more fitting, as Cruise is more of a modern and contemporary actor.
2681;But still, he makes his character convincing.
2682;The Japanese actors, especially Watanabe help the film a lot.
2683;with that said, this is a very good movie, but not a great one.
2684;I mention these two films, because these are both grand epics that are as focused on their characters and conflicts as they are with action and battle scenes.
2685;The film does not delve deeply enough into these matters, but it is still entertaining and at times even thought.
2686;One can't help but think as grand and spectacular Kurosawa's colors and battle scenes were, there lay a heart, a soul, a deep meaning about life and people behind those epic canvas shots of war and blood.
2687;There was a message about life in all of Kurosawa's films, and here a rather straightforward story is told in a clear.
2688;And as I said before, all these scenes are fueled by great cinematography by John Toll and powerful music by Hans Zimmer.
2689;The Last Samurai scratches the surface of the many great samurai films and Kurosawa's depth and is not as multi.
2690;layered as it should be, but there is enough fighting and entertainment to keep mainstream audiences content.
2691;Nevertheless, the film is beautiful to look at, entertaining, well.
2692;done, and as I said before, has an amazing soundtrack (see my review of the soundtrack).
2693;This is definitely miles ahead of a lot of garbage released these days and is highly recommended.
2694;I appreciate the moral code and style of living that the samurai live.
2695;A few of his films are entertaining (MIP, Top Gun, Taps), but not great.
2696;this film is very enjoyable.
2697;Katsumoto and Cruise's character have a very good and interesting relationship.
2698;The scenes between the two have great dialogue.
2699;in that they are enemies with great respect for each other.
2700;the cinematography is awesome (Widescreen edition is a must to get the full benefits.
2701;The clothing and buildings are historically accurate.
2702;the battle scenes are very graphic, so beware.
2703;i highly recommend this film for its action, story, charactization, and acting.
2704;It is a great film that belongs in everyone's collection.
2705;This edition is very good.
2706;The movie is excellent and look authentic.
2707;The extra credits are also a must see and are interesting and informative.
2708;For a picture of life in Japan during the Meiji Era (1868.1912), this movie does an excellent job of showing the division between the two societies battling for supremecy: the traditional Samurai and the new Western.
2709;Granted, this is a highly romanticized view of the time period, and the ending may strike viewers as overly sappy, but overall, this is a solid story of adversity, change, and adaption during a tumultuous time.
2710;"doc"")that leaves a lot of detail out."
2711;While the Cruise interview carries what there is, the doc hints at some analysis on why one person believes the movie's storyline is very Hollywood.
2712;Features interviews primarily of the Japanese cast and crew.
2713;considering the above, get this for the movie and enjoy it.
2714;Okay, first off I want to say that this was a great movie, great acting and directing, great battle scenes and beautiful Japanese scenery.
2715;I saw it in theaters and loved every second of it.
2716;It is the reason that I love Japan and Samurai.
2717;Another big point is that the cinematography and the just plain beauty of the mountains is captured with extraordinary talent and adds much to the ability of the movie to involve us.
2718;It is the storytellers art, the Homeric epics that once were passed down around campfires by old men to their grandchildren.
2719;Whispers in the dark about the giants of reknown, the heroes of the golden ages, the fighters like the battle of Thermopylae (a tale told in the movie) whose courage saved a nation.
2720;All that matters is that the clothing is authentic, the characters are believable to the masses of us who didn't get much out of 8th grade world history, let alone a college history of Japan class.
2721;It appears to be honor for honor's sake, value without a fundamental object, without a big point, but honor simply as a survival value on the battlefield.
2722;To have honor motivates, inspires, swings the sword harder and longer, kills without compassion, it the basic utilitarian value of the warrior class.
2723;all subtile honor is valuable for its own sake take home message.
2724;This movie is about the honor of a disappearing culture falling to the ever enchroaching imperial world in both 19th Century America and Europe.
2725;Tom Cruise is great in this role and is quite possibily his best role yet.
2726;the production values of this movie are great and well directed by Edward Zwick (Glory).
2727;Definitely the a great directed movie.
2728;So if you are worried about historical inaccuracies then you can get the real tale in the documentary on the special features disc.
2729;the last samurai is one of my favorite movies i loved watch'n it n the theaters and loved watchen it now
2730;The real reason for this review is the fast dependable service provided by Amazon.
2731;It was a really good movie.
2732;This is one of Tom Cruise's better movies.
2733;It is worth the money.
2734;This is one of the few movies that I can watch time and time again.
2735;I think this is one of the best movies I have ever seen and if my memory serves me right, think this is the only movie that Tom Cruise has acted well in, in my opinion!
2736;the acting, for the most part, is first rate.
2737;One can see the power of one's heritage being overrun simply because something is 'inevitable'.
2738;This is probably the best that I have ever seen Tom Cruise in a movie.
2739;It was directed very well and all the actors fitted their rolls.
2740;You really should see this movie.
2741;Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe were excellent choices for the characters they played.
2742;While watching the film I was sometimes standing and cheering and at other times I was moved to tears with emotion.
2743;the film also conveyed how important family values were to the Samurai as well.
2744;I found the final scene in the film very moving.
2745;one message the film conveyed very well is some of the cultural history and values that can be found in ancient Asian cultures.
2746;The Samurai believed their Emperor to be a living God.
2747;They believed in serving their Emperor with dignity, respect, devotion and honor.
2748;There are many ways that the words could be translated, one that I've seen is: Since ancient times to the present, God is with those who serve with dignity and honor .
2749;Having studied some of the other asian martial arts I can say that they also include some of these values.
2750;Watching The Last Samurai gave me a new appreciation of that history.
2751;the three wise men that traveled to Bethlehem two thousand years ago.
2752;One of history's great ironies is that the machine gun was designed with the goal of making war more humane.
2753;This is an expression of a reality that the makers of The Last Samurai seem to be highly aware of: that progress is a relative term, and technology brings as much woe as it does improvement.
2754;Specifically, he works for the Winchester gun company, halfheartedly promoting the high.
2755;in the end, he accepts a well.
2756;and eventually is drawn into a series of penetrating conversations with Katsumoto.
2757;As time passes, director Zwick and his talented cast paint an absolutely enthralling picture of a society governed by discipline, tradition, and a sort of Zen stoicism that Algren begins to love.
2758;I feel it is more important as iconography than as history, however.
2759;predictably, Algren throws in his hat with the samurai, learning Japanese and the expert use of the ever.
2760;But before the end he returns to the samurai village via some incredible swordplay, in time to take part in the final battle.
2761;And by the way, the scene wherein he is armed by Taka in her deceased husband's armour, though completely chaste, is one of the most truthful and moving scenes of sensuality I have ever seen, largely due to the subtle and wordless acting of Koyuki.
2762;i. e. the soul of Japan .
2763;Since the sympathy is so clearly with the samurai, the film becomes a reactionary piece, perhaps even Luddite.
2764;"But as I mentioned earlier, the iconography is much more important than the actual history
2765;this is, after all, a classic theme with plenty of resonance, so it ends up working very well and not feeling too heavy.
2766;Here the cinematography becomes quite stunning, and the power of the symbolism is undeniable.
2767;in the end, this is a classic tale of tradition fighting against the overwhelming tide of modernity.
2768;It correctly identifies the Good Life as something non.
2769;Since the film portrays classic themes and boasts a cast able to bring the themes to life with a considerable degree of success, The Last Samurai rates five stars.
2770;Throw in a wolf and some blue face paint and that's pretty much what you've got: Dances with Wolves meets Braveheart.
2771;aside from the derivative nature of the movie (and the music"
2772;Tom Cruise carries the film brilliantly and outshines any other cast member by far, partly because his character was the only one that was shown to develop.
2773;the message of the film is a very positive one, that of honor and courage, even in the face of unbeatable odds, a code almost completely foreign to the average American.
2774;The last criticism is a technical one .
2775;while the cinematography was wonderful, the sets were not.
2776;I still thought it looked glorious and that Tom is becoming a fine actor and that Ken Watanabe was fantastic!
2777;For the length of the film, you're transported back in time 100 years and get a wonderful taste of the period.
2778;The sword fights are wonderful, especially one where Tom's character is set upon by four samurai.
2779;This one looked quite a bit more compelling.
2780;this isn't The Godfather, but if you get it for a trip back in time complete with lush costumes and thrilling swordplay, this is a great ride!
2781;the latest Tom Cruise movie, The Last Samurai is a terrific movie.
2782;He stands up to these powers because it is the right thing, the noble thing to do.
2783;the movie was one of the best of the year, with Oscar caliber acting, script, set, and costumes, in a season with a plethora of disappointing films.
2784;I left with a glow in my heart and feeling both inspired and disgusted.
2785;I'm curious how conservatives viewed this flick.
2786;The Last Samurai (2003) with Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe is a fantastic movie and a visual work of art
2787;"Every single person who was a part of this film brought ""The Last Samurai"" to life."
2788;Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe are by far two of the best actors ever!
2789;The whole score is magnificant and stunning.
2790;Hanz put his heart and soul into this score and he did not get credit for it.
2791;I am truley and absolutley stunned that this brilliant movie did not recieve any oscar awards nor was it nominated for best picture or best actor!
2792;The story is so uplifting and groundbreaking!
2793;Make sure to have the closest person beside you weither it is your martial arts master, your wife, or your best friend because this movie will make you want to hold someone until the very last frame is gone!
2794;The Last Samurai is the best movie EVER!
2795;It tells of honor, tradition, and courage beyond what any army can give nowadays.
2796;But the Samurai were true heroes, because they depended on their own strength and bravery.
2797;cruise and Watanabe were both spectacular, and they both brung the movie alive.
2798;It was another war movie yes, and I've seen so many, but there was a lot more spiritual meaning to this film than with other war films, a much more profound meaning.
2799;this was a truly captivating film to witness, and I recommend it to all.
2800;As most of the previous reviewers pointed out, the imaginary in this film is good and often beautiful.
2801;The story line is quite fantastic and somewhat loosely based on historical events, but it does work as a simple adventure film.
2802;One of the main characters is in this film Katsumoto, is based the historical figure on Saigo Takamori.
2803;the film makes no mention of Saigo Takamori's political ideas, which included Japan becoming an imperial power and invading Korea.
2804;This film has been compared (a lot) to Dances with Wolves due to the fact that they both share similar themes.
2805;But Algren's past demons are redeemed by his courageous actions helping the Samurai.
2806;the true worth of this movie is its look.
2807;A whole village was built and the attention to detail is astonishing.
2808;The costumes are simply amazing, especially the battle armors.
2809;also of notice are the battle scenes, which are breathtaking.
2810;as for the acting, Cruise does a fine job, and is slowly but consistently becoming a better actor (even if this particular performance was not nominated for an Academy Award), but the movie belongs to Ken Watanabe (who was indeed nominated) as Katsumoto.
2811;He is the center of every scene he's in.
2812;Koyuki's performance as Taka, Katsumoto's sister and Algren's love interest, should also be noticed.
2813;This movie succeeds in its primary objective: it entertains.
2814;There is a solid story here that engages the viewer, moves at a smart pace, and never drags.
2815;There is a fascinating overarching theme here: the transformation of Japan into a modern, industrial nation and the fact that elements of Japanese society, i. e. the Samurai, will not easily fit into the new order of things.
2816;The sets and scenery, by the way, in this film are about as good as you will ever find in any movie, and this one rewards the viewer who either sees it in a theater or on a first.
2817;Tom Cruise does a pretty good job in this film, and he has plainly matured as an actor over the years.
2818;overall an excellent film to which the viewer will return more than once.
2819;"Set in 1870's Japan, ""The Last Samurai"" is most effective when it sticks to the harsh realities of its blood."
2820;"director Edward Zwick, who made one of the best war films of modern times (""Glory""), has had less success here, mainly because he stacks the deck so shamelessly in favor of the samurai that we can't help feeing manipulated all throughout the film."
2821;"And all the talk about ""honor,"" ""shame,"" the beauty of cherry blossoms and getting in touch with the inner self through a zen."
2822;The makers of the film want us to see a vast moral chasm separating the samurai from both the Japanese military and the evil American colonials who support them, but it is, ultimately, a distinction without a difference.
2823;"technically, ""The Last Samurai"" is a mighty impressive achievement."
2824;In addition to the eye.
2825;catching vistas of rural Japan and a beautifully recreated 19th Century city, the film's large.
2826;heart should note that the body count on screen is enormous and the blood flows generously throughout.
2827;it's a good flick and worth owning.
2828;Tom Cruise gives a stellar performance!
2829;The historical and cultural backgrounds were perfect.
2830;The traditional Samurai sense of honor and respect prevails even through the darkest period in their history.
2831;Ken Watanabe did an outstanding job portraying Katsumoto, the strong and honorable leader of the last army of samurai.
2832;Holding out and fighting against all odds for what he believes in, honor.
2833;Finally a movie that gives the samurai all of the credit they deserve!
2834;felt, pure epic of sorts which are very rare in this day and age.
2835;This movie is filled with breath.
2836;taking scenary of the Japanese landscapes, and riveting battle sequences.
2837;Films of this caliber are very rare.
2838;Beautifully shot ~~,if only tom cruises character in this film could be,Its a good film.
2839;Cheapening of martial artslearning the art of the sword and unarmed combat in 3 months vs someone whose spent their life with it and he can draw that man in 3 months plz.
2840;wow the actor spent 8 months learning martial arts for this movie, he must be REALLY good in 8 months, like thats almost a year of training in martial arts, sword and unarmed combat.
2841;this film is a 3/4 star, its an ok film, but honestly to give this 5 stars is a bit hopeful/woefully uncritical/written by someone with vested interest in selling it?
2842;It is a true gift from Hollywood's finest to have such a beautifull movie that so wonderfully expresses the genuine honor of the samurai code.
2843;"Only one other film illustrates the true meaning of the samurai spirit better than this Tom Cruise epic, it's called ""Men Behind the Sun""."
2844;I rate this movie up there with The Godfather.
2845;I liked it so much I bought it and downloaded it to my Kindle cloud so I can watch it any time I want.
2846;Then one of the top ranking Samurai steps up to him and demands him to give up the sword.
2847;He is to proud to give it up.
2848;The Last Samurai is every bit as good as you've generally heard.
2849;Everyone both in front of the camera and behind it has crafted an awesome experience here, especially Tom Cruise.
2850;"in addition, Ken Watanabe does indeed also excel
2851;Regardless of one's opinion of Cruise or of some creative historical moments, this is a beautiful, moving, epic movie and a must.
2852;This is a Great Movie And i love it.
2853;The movie had real strengths in the supporting cast and succeeded in convincing you that you were indeed in the middle of 19th century Japan.
2854;With what seemed to be """"genuine"""" shoji filled spaces and beautiful countryside landscapes it was impossible to dismiss the films charm."""
2855;During the first battle scene I found the music seemed to detract from the intensity of the battle and what should have been heart.
2856;in the end however the film was carried by strong supporting characters and a believeable Tom Cruise.
2857;product of Ken Watanabe's performance and the beautifully intricate armor and weapons.
2858;The Last Samurai was certainly one of the best movies of 2003.
2859;the acting is, on every front, excellent.
2860;The actors cast in the supporting roles are equally suited to the film, each giving realistic and powerful performances by turns.
2861;director Edward Zwick infuses the entire film with the necessary serene feel.
2862;if The Last Samurai has a real problem, it's that the story is about somewhat immaterial concepts: tradition, honor, and the character of a culture.
2863;And the stories of the characters and their relationships within this defense are powerful enough to provide more than enough emotional resonance to compensate.
2864;in a year that saw the release of many excellent films, The Last Samurai is among the best.
2865;Patient, mature viewers will find much to admire herein, though those seeking a light.
2866;As a fan of the legendary Japanese director Akira Kurosawa, I held rather low expectations for a great Japanese Samurai epic starring, of all people, Tom Cruise.
2867;and, in the end, that is where The Last Samurai shines.
2868;The soundtrack, the cinematography, the surprisingly good acting and the relatively slow pacing somehow combine to present a quiet, breathtaking version of feudal Japan.
2869;It may not make the most profound statements about the world (despite its philosophical overtones), but it does succeed in transporting the viewer into its own beautiful world.
2870;And, for me, that beauty is well worth two or three hours of my time.
2871;Even at 16 when I first saw The Last Samurai I abhorred it, and five year later I still can honestly say the same.
2872;I really loved watching the cultural elements of the movie, the acting is very good, and it's beautifully filmed, but this is one that loses much of its appeal as I think about it the next day.
2873;This is a movie that is based in ancient japan and shows you the real way of the samurai.
2874;It gives you a better understanding about that time period in japan.
2875;It just a great film.
2876;The story, the scenery and the characters are all brought together very well.
2877;Ken Wantanabe is the true star of this movie.
2878;He does not overpower the other actors and is very believable in this part
2879;This movie is great all around, of course there are things that someone will complain about, but I am completely satisfied with this film.
2880;The fighting is great because it shows the actually processes that original Samurai used to both follow, show, and perform in their everyday lives.
2881;The areas are just gorgeous.
2882;The foreign actors, also bring a whole new respect to all others through this film.
2883;Overall this film is very emotional for some, but most of all, a tribute to the image and values of the Samurai.
2884;Thought this was a very well done movie about a portion of history that doesn't get very much publicity.
2885;Cruise did an outstanding job and there was an excellent supporting cast.
2886;I bought it to watch it with my grandsons.
2887;The film also shows that we need to keep a balance between our traditions that are good and at the same time embracing new ones.
2888;The cinematography is in itself spectacular.
2889;Good American samurai movie, but the ending was totally hollywood.
2890;If you want to see a real samurai movie check out Azumi and aragami.
2891;Not 100% FACTUAL but a great movie with a wonderful view of changing cultural upheaval and the clash of traditional with technological
2892;Beautifully filmed with a plot that truly touches the heart.
2893;The cast chosen were oerfect and the theme was good.
2894;"Former Paramount studios chief Robert Evans used to call his holiday pictures ""Christmas gifts to the world,"" and ""The Last Samurai"" is staged just so: Much of it is handsome, magnificent and morally decent, yet the movie is full of itself, in both solemnity and faraway gaze."
2895;The samurai are led by their last great fighter, Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe), fight by sword and bow, and have the fealty of the people.
2896;"The samurai village is beautifully realized
2897;With a valley in the distance reminiscent of a fertile green ocean, Algren begins to adjust to the mood and practice of the warriors and prove himself worthy of it while kindling a romance with a samurai's widow (beautiful, expressive Koyuki).
2898;while Katsumoto may belong to an ancient order, he speaks English, displays a quick sense of humor and seeks to trade wisdom with Algren rather than merely dispensing it.
2899;Watanabe is so good because he plays against the expectation of the stern, authoritarian titan, and, with a smile, steals most of the scenes away from Cruise, who affects the broken man about as well as a naturally expressive actor can.
2900;The ninja raid has a hint of Kurosawa, while the forest sequences echoes the Vietnam movies of Stone and Coppola.
2901;The final battle is a close cousin to """"Braveheart"""" and deserves to be mentioned with it."""
2902;Zwick is a fabulous combat director, and considering the movie's scope, deserves a mention during awards season.
2903;It tacks on a needless, uplifting epilogue to a naturally earth.
2904;Such stark lines of romance and villainy detract from the movie's underlying elegy of samurais courting death against the machines.
2905;Great transaction, product in excellent condition as promoted, prompt shipping and extra care taken with bubble wrap inside a padded envelope!
2906;I am not necessarily a Tom Cruise fan but I thought he did an outstanding job in this role.
2907;It was well cast and written.
2908;I really tried to enjoy this film.
2909;I like Japanese culture and I like Tom Cruise.
2910;He takes it and moves overseas.
2911;And he thought that a film like this would make him a shoe in.
2912;But cool sword fights and epic battles a movie do not make.
2913;I didn't have high expectations for this movie, but it surprised and pleased me enough to watch it 3 times.
2914;And Koyuki as the Samurai widow was just plain gorgeous.
2915;Good acting, good story and yes Tom Cruise does do a good job of fitting into the role.
2916;I loved the cast, there's a lot of them I've never seen before and they do an awesome job.
2917;The Last Samurai is a beautifully shot film that everyone seems to have thrown themselves into with gusto, but the movie somehow lacks the oomph that would have propelled it into the cinematic stratosphere.
2918;a darn good movie that, with two exceptional aspects, will not be considered a classic (and it could have been!)
2919;directed by Edward Zwick (of the magnificent Glory ), Samurai tells the story of Civil War hero Capt. Nathan Algren (Cruise, in an earnest performance).
2920;The story's parallels to Kevin Costner's Dances With Wolves are well.
2921;He stands in stark contrast to the first Japanese we see, Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe, who steals the movie), the Samurai lord .
2922;we see him in his tranquil village having a vision of a tiger in a scene of stark, lethal beauty.
2923;After all, we know how Hamlet is going to wind up, and it's still an emotional roller.
2924;Samurai certainly gets a lot of the visual elements correct .
2925;the early battle scene involving the cavalry charge of the samurai through the mists, as if emerging from their own mythology, is a triumph.
2926;Contrast Cruise's performance with Costner's in Wolves .
2927;(To be fair, in many other ways the movie gets the look and feel of the period very well.)
2928;Ken Watanabe's portrayal of Katsumoto is the movie's high point.
2929;A complex man, capable of great emotion within his samurai stoicism, Katsumoto is intrigued by Algren and learns much from him.
2930;the climactic scene, the last battle of the Katsumoto's samurai against the Western.
2931;This movie dared to tackle a huge, powerful story, and in many ways it works.
2932;Being that the film is very creative with it's adjustments to major historical events and figures, it leaves plenty of room for analysis.
2933;if you are watching just for fun, which is probably more than 99.9 percent of viewers, then this is a perfectly good action movie, and to Tom Cruises great credit, his Japanese pronunciation is about as perfect as it should be for the character he plays.
2934;It is rare we see a Hollywood movie focus on Japanese culture.
2935;They, of course, lose to the samurai led by Katsumoto (Watanabe) and Algren is captured.
2936;As he is being held at the village of the Samurai he learns their ways and befriend Katsumoto.
2937;As promised when winter ends Katsumoto returns Algren where he must make the choice to go home or join the samurai and defend what he has come to love.
2938;tom Cruise is one of those actors whose good looks overshadow his acting ability.
2939;By that I mean that a lot of people don't think he is a talented actor because all the women love him.
2940;All three are talented actors, and Cruise shows it with this movie.
2941;While his performance here isn't on par with films such as Magnolia and Jerry Maguire, he still gives a powerful performance.
2942;Watanabe brilliantly captures the essence of a samurai warrior.
2943;The ending is something that will bring tears to many people's eyes.
2944;I really enjoyed Hiroyuki Sanada as Kotsumoto's most loyal friend.
2945;He is the true picture as well for a warrior.
2946;i have enjoyed Edward Zwick movies since I have begun watching them.
2947;Glory of course is the best.
2948;This movie may not quite live up to Glory but it is sure nice to see them making a film about a subject that I never thought we would see in film again.
2949;They capture the very essence of a samurai in their screenplay.
2950;The set designs are beautiful, along with the costumes.
2951;The score by Hans Zimmer is equally impressive.
2952;I loved that story line.
2953;so in the end, I recommend you seeing this movie.
2954;It brilliantly captures what life in Japan was at that time period.
2955;It showcases amazing performances by Watanabe, Cruise, and a great supporting cast.
2956;The cinematography is beautiful as is the set design.
2957;I will tell you how he lived.
2958;but I still love this movie.
2959;He might be bat s*** crazy but this movie is pretty solid.
2960;One of, if not, the best samurai movies ever.
2961;The story was great, very true to the way of the samurai, and very dramatic.
2962;The action was intense and incredible, the ninja attack and the last battle are o so very cool.
2963;The performances were good all around esspecially Tom and Ken.
2964;"Tom Cruise and Edward Zwick set out to make a film that had great spiritual depth, using the samurai ""bushido"" code as the foundation for understanding the culture of the samurai warriors."
2965;i found myself watching, in my opinion, a great, spiritual film about a Civil War veteran who has lost himself in guilt and shame for actions done during the Indian campaigns.
2966;"He goes to Japan to train the ""new"" soldier, and quickly finds himself the captive the samurai."
2967;This film, in some ways, goes deeper.
2968;"One must go deep to truly understand the way of the samurai
2969;those familiar with Star Wars will see how and why George Lucas used the samurai as inspiration for his Jedi.
2970;The samurai demonstrated themselves by being loyal, being compassionate, being honest, etc.
2971;i thought Tom Cruise did a very good job (although I find myself wondering how much better this film would have been if someone like, Daniel Day.
2972;i will also argue that this film has the best """"love"""" scene of any movie I've ever seen."""
2973;The subtlety and feeling that emerges as Taka is dressing Nathan in his garments, preparing him for battle, is one of the most poignant love scenes I've ever had the pleasure to see on screen.
2974;i find it extremely interesting the most people believe that those who came before us had to have been more primitive.
2975;in fact, it seldom is.
2976;"the Japanese Emperor sums up the words beautifully: ""."
2977;this is a great story, and I feel that the Last Samurai speaks volumes to the way of the warrior and to the way of being.
2978;Amazing movie, probably one of tom cruises best.
2979;Lots of exciting action, every character is well thought out and developed, and the story is beautiful
2980;it's worth seeing again and owning, but ONLY on sale!
2981;I think that this is a great movie for my collection.
2982;Great visuals and great story!
2983;This movie has a solid story line which it follows throughout the whole movie.
2984;"This movie is also quite informative
2985;Also there are some great fighting scenes in this movie that are worth watching.
2986;Overall, I think this was a great movie and I recommend for people to see it.4.5 stars but Amazon doesn't have halves.
2987;Nevertheless, I believe The Last Samurai is one of Tom Cruise's best films, if not his best film ever, because he does an outstanding job of portraying the role of Capt. Nathan Algren"
2988;cruise does an excellent job of capturing this particular spirit in the film.
2989;Watanabe was simply terrific as the Samurai warlord, Katsumoto.
2990;Besides the performances the battle sequences and costumes were spectacular.
2991;In addition, the scenery and setting were also very good and captured the atmosphere of a 19th century Japan that was experiencing rapid Westernization.
2992;At several instances in the film it is easy to see vestiges of traditional Eastern Japansese culture stand side by side with modern Western culture.
2993;As always, Zimmer delivers a rousing an emotional score that complements the film and actually heightens the sensitivity at certain crucial moments of the film.
2994;It would have been nice if the other characters, Ujio, Taka, and Katsumoto, received more screen time since they were all so likeable and each delivers a great performance.
2995;"I found myself moved, although there were strains of ""Dancing with Wolves"" I was intrigued enough by the story to overlook it."
2996;additionally, this movie had quite a few accurate historical moments and weapons.
2997;i highly recommend this flick.
2998;Another recurrence of 60's Hollywood movies where Japanese speak perfect English.
2999;Tom Cruise was hit so many times and he is still alive, unbelievably in arms and legs only!
3000;There are a lot of sword.
3001;done, and if you enjoy watching them you'll find entertainment value in the movie.
3002;Also, the Japanese countryside is filmed beautifully here, so if you have an appreciation for nature, it's another incentive to watch.
3003;dimensional and unquestionably the fine and good people in the film.
3004;For Cruise it's one of those self.
3005;The opening scenes had me speechless when I saw how clear and vivid everything looked.
3006;Really enjoyed The Last Samurai.
3007;I love epic movies that sweep me away, and this one surely did!
3008;I can't find the words to describe this truly amazing movie.
3009;Tom Cruise really surprised me and delivered such a wonderful performance in this movie.
3010;I thought for sure it would have been.
3011;It is such a beautiful movie, full of emotion, and wonderful performances.
3012;This movie is a true masterpiece.
3013;The movie arrived on time and in perfect condition.
3014;One of my all time favorite movies, no matter how many times I see it.
3015;it looked and ran great.
3016;maybe that is because they both are kind of animists who believe that every things on Earth has spirit.
3017;trees, mountains, rivers, seas, rocks, etc.
3018;"like the American Indians say
3019;Here, as well as profoundly understanding the meanings of life and death, accepting one's own life as it is is a crucial point to get through.
3020;Because you have your own purpose of life as you are born to the circumstances you were given.
3021;If you see this film and take it correctly, you should understand that as well.
3022;Your readiness to die makes your life meaningful.
3023;Meaningful life makes your soul shine.
3024;that is every human being's purpose to be born to this world.
3025;The Last Samurai made me think about where I came from and who I am.
3026;Many have seen this wonder of a movie.
3027;The first disc has the movie and right after that they have the full movie again but this time with the directors commentary on every aspect of the film as it plays.
3028;The meaning and essential core of Bushido .
3029;what has guided generations of Japanese .
3030;is exemplified in these writings.
3031;The woman who plays Taka displays the epitomy of feminine beauty and grace.
3032;warning to all men: She will steal your heart.
3033;It is very touchingly done .
3034;your paternal and maternal instincts will emerge and highten.
3035;more than any I have seen .
3036;love, Courage, Loyalty and above all .
3037;this movie is a shinning example.
3038;Getting rid of them was probably the best thing that ever happened to Japanese democracy.
3039;that said, the film is beautifully photographed, and had some nice battle scenes.
3040;People get down on Tom Cruise for his limited acting range, but he does a good job here.
3041;The supporting cast is entirely watchable and believable.
3042;if you're in the mood for an action flick that doesn't require much in the way of critical thinking, it's worth seeing.
3043;The result is a Tom Cruise film that doesn't revolve around Tom Cruise and in which Cruise does some genuine acting.
3044;The Japanese cast are veteran actors but unknown outside of Japan.
3045;Beautiful outdoor settings in both Japan and New Zealand where shot with care.
3046;The music is mix of John Williams.
3047;Enlisted to stand in for one, are several characters proposing to change Japan into a more modern country similar to the US and Europe, but this is never developed well so it seems the small band of Samari are fighting against, well, something.
3048;the Director's Commentary track is good and serviceable but it's just that, the Director's Commentary.
3049;man Movie, kept my attention the whole time.
3050;I like well acted war movies.
3051;Wonderful movie, one of the best you'll ever experience and since most reviewers wrote a lot about this movie I won't.
3052;i'm not a huge Cruise fan, but I do think this is one of his better performances.
3053;disgust (MAGNOLIA) and he taps into it here.
3054;The film's first act is its strongest part.
3055;Indeed all of the action scenes are very well put together.
3056;in the film's middle section, Cruise learns how wonderful it is to be Japanese and follow the way of the Samurai.
3057;tHE LAST SAMURAI is entertaining, if a bit bloated, and contains several superior action sequences.
3058;This is, without a doubt, the most underrated movie of 2003.
3059;This is Edward Zwick's crowning achievement and would be Tom Cruise's best performance if he hadn't been in """"Born on the 4th of July""""."""
3060;"I enjoyed ""Master and Commander"" but it is so 2nd rate to this."
3061;This movie is a beautiful story about a civil war captain, scarred by the way he saw the Native Americans get salughtered by his fellow troops, who is brought by fate to these very spiritual people (the samurai), who learn him their customs and heal his psychological wounds.
3062;(Another thing, the art and costume design in this movie are breathtaking, another reason to see this movie).
3063;Tom C's best movie .
3064;I am not a big Tom C. fan but this is his best movie.
3065;Good pace, good acting, great soundtrack it has it all .
3066;For the first hour and forty minutes this is a near faultless film which examines the very heart of the human soul.
3067;In the opening battle he is captured by the Samurai and it is then that he can see the parallel with the Indians and eventually switches sides.
3068;All this is beautifully filmed and some of the scenes in the Samurai village, when Captain Algren is gradually adapting to the Samurai way of life reminded me of Kevin Costners Dances with Wolves.
3069;i am not especially a fan of Tom Cruise but he is good in this.
3070;In supporting roles Billy Connelly and Timothy Spall are bothvery good.
3071;"Don't get me wrong
3072;as for this film, the cinematography and supporting actor roles are it's primary attraction.
3073;The settings and costumes are beautiful.
3074;He is the real star of this movie.
3075;Katsumoto spares Algren's life and brings him back to health (queue the music).
3076;Algren learns the way of the Samurai warrior and earns the respect of his Samurai brethren.
3077;Eventually he has to face the very Japanese Army he helped train, this time fighting on the side of the Samurai.
3078;Other performances are great as well, including Timothy Spall (the photographer) and especially Ken Watanabe.
3079;The story is extremely well written and the action scenes are well done, with no extra choreography or special effects that make the action seem less authentic.
3080;It's easily my favorite thing about the film, and it's quite possibly the best soundtrack and score composed without being grandiose.
3081;note melodies but they're so poignant and fitting, that you can't not be moved by many scenes.
3082;time favorite films and deserves to be seen as equally as legendary and epic as similar films such as Braveheart and Gladiator.
3083;I thought the last samuri was good,
3084;But everybody was so still in their sits.
3085;I take that as a sign of acceptance from the Japanese audience.
3086;It arrived as promised and I'm happy with the order and the way it was processed.
3087;now, years later, I watched it again, and I was so pleasantly surprised.
3088;The story is very dramatic, it's beautifully photographed, and the action is breathtaking.
3089;The performances across the board are great, including what I consider a career best from Tom Cruise.
3090;If you like historical dramas like Gladiator, Braveheart, or Dances with Wolves, you should really enjoy this.
3091;Besides the emense amounts of gore *do to violent war scenes* it has beautiful scenery and wonderful messages of love.
3092;'The Last Samurai' is a one of those films that has it's flaws but you can't help but enjoy anyway.
3093;Throughout the story it immerses you in aspects of the history of Japan, and although slightly stylised, gives a good feeling of life and culture in those times.
3094;It has beautiful film locations, beautiful music, a good story line and a good cast.
3095;I feel this to be one of Cruise's better films and his performance is very credible.
3096;This film may be slightly long, but it holds your interest right to the end and is a great nights viewing.
3097;It was beatifully pieced together, and quite accurately depicted Japan at that time.
3098;They even got it right when it came down to the scrawny, wimpy, underaged Emperor of Japan, Meiji.
3099;Well, I can sit here and tell you all about the movie, but you can also see it for yourself.
3100;If you like historically accurate, well pieced together, action.
3101;packed, movies, with great actors, actresses, plot.
3102;lines, and a movie that can bring a tear to the eye, then by all means, please see this movie.
3103;I think this is the most wonderful movie I have seen in my short life of 15 years.
3104;and when I saw this movie I came out crying because it was so touching and really got to me.
3105;See when you like something like that very much and they make a movie based on it.
3106;it will make you get upset at some point.
3107;This is my favorite movie of all time and it's amazing!
3108;Everyone should see this touching, romantic, action, drama movie!
3109;I personally enjoyed this movie for several reasons.
3110;like denial of technology and the west, a very smart clique of leaders soon realized that the Japanese themselves had to take the lead in modernizing their country.
3111;I'm sure that's how they pitched it .
3112;at some point, one of the Hollywood studios is going to wake up and realize that Americans like to see positive, heroic portrayals from time to time instead of the diseased anti.
3113;heroes that they keep foisting on us, and whichever studio gets this will clean up at the box office.
3114;if you are into Japan see one of Kurosawa's films.
3115;Drama, action, amazing battle scenes .
3116;the best I've ever seen.
3117;It's definitely a must see.
3118;If the """"I haven't figured out the right dose of Ritalin to take yet"""" presence of Tom Cruise grates on your nerves as much as it does mine, you'll be pleasantly surprised to find that he at times gives a measured and even subtle performance as a shell."""
3119;"Zwick even plagiarizes his own film, the much better ""Glory,"" and fans of Hans Zimmer's ""The Thin Red Line"" soundtrack will be pleased to note that some of it seems to make its way into this film."
3120;With an attractive cast and nods to historical authencity, such as ill.
3121;To start off, this was a splendidly filmed movie with a fine sound track.
3122;Emporer Meiji, the greatest of their modern monarchs was a strong and decisive ruler (and wasn't referred to as Meiji until after his death, just as Hirohito is now referred to as Shoa).
3123;The story and location and acting are all top notch.
3124;To see Tom Cruise's character in such a pit of despair, yet work himself to a much better place is very moving.
3125;Ken Watenabe is likewise very moving as always.
3126;He feels so strong and understanding.
3127;Anyway, everyone who loves this movie already knows what I am talking about.
3128;It isn't in the title, but I could see the logo in the picture, so I took a chance.
3129;I love have a physical copy as well as a digital one that I can watch anywhere.
3130;Yes, Tom Cruse does shows some wonderful acting chops and, yes, Ken Watanabe steals the show but let's move on.
3131;The original release was pretty darn good.
3132;I remain disappointed with the lossy audio but it still provides an excellent film.

3136;Were it not morally reprehensible, they'd probably manage to make a compassionate film about the Nazis.
3137;The Last Samurai is worth the lengthy investment of time for the stirring emotional outpouring it wrenches from those willing to excuse the flaws and occasional cloying misstep.
3138;The Last Samurai is one of the greatest historical epics of our generation.
3139;The battle scenes are created with great action and detail, as are the solo sword fights.
3140;And while the action is breathtaking, they only help to tell an amazing yet somber story of honor, sacrifice and change.
3141;Tom Cruise gives what is possibly the performance of his career, and Ken Watanabe gives an Oscar.
3142;worthy performance as Katsumoto (He was robbed at the Oscars).
3143;Any fan of true film will want this epic in their collection!
3144;While no movie is perfect, and all art can be improved, this effort comes pretty close.
3145;The film blends the the epic and the personal, the external and the internal in masterful fashion.
3146;cruise does well in his role, but the finest performances come from the Japanese cast.

3149;It takes an immediate place on my all.
3150;time list, blending the power of Braveheart with the feeling and morality of The Mission.
3151;A rare and remarkable achievement.
3152;The Last Samurai is filled with gorgeous scenery but that is about all it has going for it.
3153;The production design is superb and Cruise, Watanabe, Goldwyn, along with Koyuki, Timothy Spall, and Billy Connolly do good work in their roles.
3154;I have found this this to be very interesting and entertaining.
3155;I enjoyed the movie's plot and the struggles of the main characters, Algren and Katsumoto.
3156;Tom Cruise is really at his best in this historical movie, with the action and then background to who he plays, just creates intensity through the whole film :)
3157;Tom cruise best movie to date, it one of the best films I have ever seen and hope eveyone sees this movie because if you haven't you are past due.
3158;The production values were terrific.
3159;It's a Japanese 'Dancing With Wolves', without the originality, dialogue or artistic vision.
3160;In the 1850's Admiral Perry's expedition brought enormous change and the downfall of the traditional Samurai caste system of the Edo period.
3161;watanabe's Feudal lord is charming and complex, but ultimately he's an anti.
3162;An 18 year old King reconsiders his position.
3163;I was surprised that I actually liked this one, particularly since it seemed to promise just another run.
3164;Of course I happen to be partial to these kinds of stories and I have a great fondness for the Japanese variants of same.
3165;The story held together and was absorbing if somewhat predictable while Cruise actually proved to be a somewhat convincing American dissolute.
3166;But the film makes it look convincing and that's usually enough in this kind of thing.
3167;The battle scenes are also nicely done and the Samurai lord, Katsuomoto, who captures and ultimately befriends the American Algren is powerfully portrayed.
3168;I'd see this one again for its ambience and tight storytelling, even if it didn't ultimately swallow me up, which, on my view, is the true measure of a great film.
3169;First you must understand I am a huge Tom Cruise fan therefore my review may come off bias, but this is truly a great movie believe me or not!
3170;If you are a fan of epic movies (Braveheart,Gladiator, etc) then The Last Samurai is your film, and if you are a fan of the epic genre and Tom Cruise the world can get no better!
3171;This film has it all great cast, passionate and exciting storyline, and beautiful cinematography to top it off.
3172;I recommend this film to anyone and everyone, enjoy!!!
3173;he comes to admire the Samurai who cling to thousand.year.
3174;true methods until better ones have proven themselves.
3175;watch this movie to see why conservatism is wisdom, and liberalism is folly.
3176;my man tom delivers in every way possible.
3177;It was an awesome movie with a great meaning about honor.
3178;It is one of my all time favorites and I have seen it three times!!!
3179;Returns us to the classics!
3180;sweep for the Oscars, the Golden Globes, the Screen Actors Guild, and the remainder of the awards season!
3181;Tom Cruise (Captain Nathan Algren) gives the best performance of his career!
3182;My favorite movie of ALL TIME!
3183;I also like the explanation of why the Western Influence into the Japanese culture had both a positive and negative affect.
3184;hour or so and it hit me hard.
3185;All the actors did a great job in my opinion.
3186;I have since watched this about 8 or 9 times and will definitely watch it again and again.
3187;It is a visual delight.
3188;Of course, you have the Dancing with Wolves angle of purity of purpose on one side versus abject evil on the other.
3189;Watching this movie and liking it is like watching a movie that glorifies Hitler and liking it.
3190;to die for another person or for one's belief is courageous and honorable.
3191;:)I played it on my PS3 in 720p, its just great.
3192;as the plot has been detailed by other reviewers I'll stick to the impression this film leaves you with.
3193;The """"Last Samurai"""" is actually a pretty cool flick."""
3194;old philosophy he comes in contact with there is well in effect here and it works like a dandy.
3195;"cruise gives his usual very good performance but the show is actually stolen by the Japanese cast headed by the ""Katsumoto"" character (the Samurai leader) who's simply a treat to watch."
3196;there is loads of battling in vast open fields and a lot of gore that accompanies it, and these escenes are absolutely great.
3197;The martian arts choreography is excellent and the filming is impeccable as well.
3198;These sequences are the top stuff this film has to offer and it does so with style.
3199;while the Last Samurai does remind of the Lord of the Rings when it comes to the spectacular battle scene and it equally reminds of Braveheart with the super.
3200;overall though, this is a probably unexpectedly cool film.
3201;Definately recommended, allthough if you see it on a small screen you'll be inevitably missing out on the great photography and camera work, but most importantly the stunning combat scenes, many of which are shot aereally.
3202;The stuggle between the hnorable old, and promising new.
3203;it even got me to shed a few tears when katzumoto's son died.
3204;Definitely worth watching a second time.
3205;But, like the quiet slice of sword through air, the pieces began to come together, and I found myself enraptured with the film.
3206;ken Watanabe (Katsumoto)'s presence on the screen is breathtaking, as were his family and friends.
3207;Taka, the heroine, was beautiful in her silence, and the scene with her and Tom at the end was.
3208;Omura is excellent and, like the rest of those mentioned here, enfuses so much emotion in one gesture or expression.
3209;It's almost as if he, like his character, is enraptured and humbled by these people, and he's purposefully pulling himself in, so that THEY shine on screen.
3210;overall, an absolutely spectacular film.
3211;It is, however, a film that I hope will inspire others.
3212;I have a home theater (my screen is over 9 feet wide!)
3213;Highly recommended if you're a fan of the Japanese culture or Tom Cruise.
3214;And if you're a fan of Ken Watanabe then this movie is a MUST HAVE, because his role and his acting job are superb (as usual)!
3215;I myself enjoyed this movie alot, although I do have to say it reminds me, in principle, of dances with wolves.
3216;With that said, the action scenes are entertaining and I found the character development between the samurai and cruise to be pretty good.
3217;Even though I generalized it like that it is still a really good movie.
3218;I really like his movies and this is one of my favorites because it shows a big comeback of a man who sinks pretty low from a high place and then rehabilitates himself because of friendship and honor and a desire to help.
3219;It's beautifully filmed and illustrates the samurai tradition which to me is fascinating.
3220;It has a full spectrum of emotions running through it.
3221;well done won best supporting actor Tom should have won best actor but did not.
3222;First off I must say that I did not think that Tom Cruise would shine in such in a roll, but he well exceeded my expectations.
3223;This was a splendid movie.
3224;The scenery was beautiful and the storyline was excellent.
3225;I would recommend this movie to anyone out to see a spectacularly moving movie.
3226;my conclusion: the Japanese loved it.
3227;There is little to criticize about the vast majority of this extravaganza: the acting and direction are excellent, the cinematography is superb, the battle scenes are spectacular, all production values are first rate.
3228;"see point one) ""happy ending"" was an insult to all events which preceded it."
3229;"Out of the ENTIRE Samurai army, guess the identity of the single survivor of the this epic and heroic ""battle to the death""."
3230;i still recommend this movie for all of the substantial and compelling positive reasons cited above, but see if you don't share, or at least acknowledge, the basis for my criticism after you have watched it.
3231;It has war, it has love, it has justice, it has gorgeous scenery, it even tries a little humor.
3232;ups, and favored characters with stony glares and a tear dripping down their cheek.
3233;The other actors overcompensated for him, delivering plenty of open mouthed, wide eyed stares, specifically Koyuki, Cruise's love interest.
3234;Once we meet the lovely and FORGIVING widow, we're sure its a sparkling romance, but it never truly blossoms.
3235;And their effort makes a watchable movie (thus the two stars).
3236;It has a great story to it.
3237;And is also a moving movie.
3238;In doing so, he shares with his newfound samurai brethren his definition of honor, perserverence and respect.
3239;But the heart of this movie comes down to the interplay between Tom Cruise's character and the samurai he has befriended.
3240;then this probably a good movie for you.
3241;This was a really good movie.
3242;The Last Samurai shows the viewer a look into the lifestyle of the the ancient ways of the Samurai during the 1800's.
3243;after being sent to the front lines with troops he believes aren't ready to fight yet, Algren is captured after a battle and is brought to the village of Katsumoto's brother in the mountains.
3244;the movie shows us breath taking landscape shots of the mountains the Samurai live in.
3245;this movie also comes with some great fighting style scenes.
3246;"this movie is great in so many ways: The vibrant color of the scenery, the style of fighting is smooth yet terrifying as lots of men die, and even the dialogue between Algren and Katsumoto is great as they have their ""Many Conversations."
3247;I reccomend this movie if you really want to see a story of a man who realizes what he really wants for himself in this world.
3248;Having seen it before I knew what to expect and the panorama of the movie doesn't disappoint.
3249;It's a pretty good movie overall.
3250;The Last Samurai is a good movie though, in a world with a lack of Samurai flicks.
3251;"The Last Samurai is equivalent to the beauty and eloquence of director Zwick's previous masterpiece ""Glory""."
3252;The film is exceptionally portrayed by not only Cruise, but especially Watanabe as the heroic Japanese fighter that leads his village against the mighty American.
3253;The battle scenes are gruesome and mind.
3254;Although not a typical Cruise role, certainly one of the better films of 2003 and one that should inspire viewers and congratulate all those who have fought for something they believed in.
3255;This is a good movie to watch if ur interested in samurais,which was pretty cool.
3256;But for the price i got it for it was a sweet deal and very good movie for those who havent seen it.
3257;This is a very entertaining movie.
3258;good action, good scenery and good story.
3259;A few interesting characters (I liked Ken Watanabe), but nothing really original.
3260;A yawner mostly, but it will entertain people who have not seen any other movies.
3261;I love this movie , its one of my favorites.
3262;It is a powerful analogy which explores what it means to be succesful in society and what it means to be a modern man.
3263;I'm not a huge Tom Cruise fan, but this is probably his best work.
3264;Excellent story and battle scenes.
3265;One of the better movies of the new millenium.
3266;The leader of the samurai keep him alive so that he can learn about the ways of his American enemies.
3267;taken as entertainment, this is an excellent movie.
3268;Despite this, if you realize that this movie is just historical fantasy and enjoy it as such, then it's a great piece of entertainment.
3269;Through this carefully crafted movie, people (especially non.
3270;The Last Samurai shows the way of life and precious traditional culture of the Japanese.
3271;Through the flow of the movie, values such as honor, perseverance and dignity are depicted.
3272;"in ""The Last Samurai,"" the actors, both Asians and Westerners, did a wonderful job."
3273;He represented the undying determinacy of the Samurai well.
3274;He even is nominated for the best supporting actor of the Academy Awards!
3275;This movie portrays the dilemma really clearly and makes people think about the conflicts of the old versus the new.
3276;Is the new always good?
3277;Could almost be a documentary I am half Japanese and this is a very good movie People should get this movie to learn a little bit about the feudal days of Japan
3278;Great flic but how is it that when searching for the movie I stumble on a blu.
3279;The Last Samurai is a film about honor.
3280;Great battle scenes never seen in this scale.
3281;ken Watanabe and Tom Cruise was superb.
3282;This film has great visuals, if nothing else.
3283;The Samurai armor and Katana swords in the film are beautiful, and Ken Wantanabe does a great performance in the film (I can't wait to see him as Ra's Al Ghul in Batman Begins).
3284;The Japanese soldiers were brave, and fought valiantly and proved their worth against the Samurai in battle, and they won.
3285;The Samurai are portrayed as brave, moral men who want to preserve the Japanese culture and prevent westernization (which obviousely is something the director does not like), and the Japanese army is portrayed as cowardly weaklings, who the Samurai slaughter like Orcs from the Lord of the Rings.
3286;Rare that an action packed star studded Hollywood movie would actually retell a story about honor and Tradition.
3287;It had a very good story and action scenes.
3288;so I found myself pleasantly surprised that not only did I not mind Tom Cruise so much (after the first 15 minutes or so, where he overdoes the 'Tom Cruise' bits) and the sword work (bokken and shinken) was handled with an acceptable degree of authenticity.
3289;handled and the movie made a real impact .
3290;Just a perfect crystal clear image from start to finish.
3291;ray and expect us to say, thank you for releasing it.
3292;The music is impressive, especially before the large battle.
3293;I feel goosebumps everytime I watch it.
3294;The change to the power structure lead to a revolt of the samurai class upset at the loss of their traditional privalages.
3295;being an American film the action is seen through the prism of an American officer.
3296;This of course is the first point at which we move into the land of fairy tale.
3297;In this film he is redeemed.
3298;In his time he becomes a convert to the samurai life style and decides to switch sides in the last epic pointless battle to keep the feudal system going in Japan.
3299;He is also able to kill the American officer who commanded him to kill the native Americans.
3300;the film is gratutously insluting to important figures in Japanese history.
3301;dimensional characters you really come to care about by film's end.
3302;My only complaint about the movie is that there is one perfect .
3303;Aside from that assumption to the audience's lack of imagination, The Last Samurai is a nearly perfect example of it's genre and is certainly one of the best offerings of 2003.
3304;The fighting is so awesome!
3305;2nd best movie of the year.
3306;The acting is pure and portrays passion, especially from those portraying the Samurais.
3307;I have never been a big Tom Cruise fan, but I thought his acting was exceptional in this movie.
3308;The young lady who was his love interest was so beautiful and her facial expressions moved me to tears sometimes.
3309;What happens next is amazing and extremely truthful to ones eye.
3310;there is so much more to this movie, especially with the great acting and action and what not, that it turns out to be a MUST SEE motion picture, and I mean ASAP.
3311;This picture will win awards easily.
3312;he was so generous and forthcoming with his time and himself,the locals absolutey love him.
3313;but I did go and see it and I loved it,every single minute of it.
3314;i even liked Mr. Cruise altho I did think he was out acted by just about everyone else in the movie.
3315;i'll certainly go and see it again.
3316;even if you're not a Tom Cruise fan you'll love it too.
3317;throughout the movie, there is a conflict of interest between the new and old traditions and it is interesting to see the ways of the samurai throughout the film.
3318;There are both small fights and epic battles, both of which are done very well and are very entertaining to watch.
3319;Through all of the culture, battles and story line is some amazing cinematography.
3320;On top of that, the acting was superb.
3321;the Last Samurai is very entertaining and interesting movie that is solid from start to finish and fits in nicely with any collection of epic style movies.
3322;This movie is a thing of beauty, with the substance to match its style.
3323;A stunning spectacle of cultural violence and a loving tribute to the great Japanese samurai.
3324;The story is captivating, with political intrigue, the terrible choices forced upon a young emperor at the cusp of industrialization in Japan, ruthless capitalists that forge ahead regardless of centuries.
3325;if you can get past the wooden acting of Cruise you should be able to enjoy the rest of this movie.
3326;The Faustian bargain seeking wealth and power in exchange for the soul of Japan proves only the folly of Japan's new destiny.
3327;Few movies today offer both drama and history worthy of your time.
3328;The Last Samurai is a great movie, good story, very entertaining.
3329;I keep getting drawn back to this.
3330;I believe that this is Tom Cruise best movie.
3331;His acting was very good, but I think the story, and more importantly the exposure to Martial Arts values is what makes this film.
3332;"Having studied many years under a true Korean Master, the ""DO"" way of life is the most important thing I have learned."
3333;This movie gives a glimpse of that.
3334;Yes I thought this movie was alright when I first saw it and I kept thinking that the story was vaguely familiar and then it hit me replace the samurai with Indians and Tom Cruise with Mel Gibson and you've basically got dances with wolves.
3335;Now I've seen a couple of To Cruises movies but this still is my favorite among his not mission impossible, this movie he plays the character well i think and you can tell there was a lot of respect put into this movie of the culture of the samurai.
3336;This movie is a good one, but it could have been much better.
3337;Tom Cruise is enjoyable, but he gives his standard performance.
3338;But the performance still works, it's just shame about the missed potential.
3339;ken Watanabe is very charismatic as the traditionalist.
3340;The chemistry between he and Cruise is very good and it's one of the more pleasurable aspects of the film.
3341;The cinematography and the costumes are also great and are bound to get oscar nominations.
3342;There are some great moments in the film, don't get me wrong.
3343;Edward Zwick proves he can still crank out a battle scene and he clearly outdoes himself in the last battle of the film.
3344;Great fight choreography, great action, but awkwardly placed and no justification for it.
3345;Thereby proving the effectiveness of rifle over swords.
3346;It's because it makes for a great action scene, that's why, and the audience will eat it up.
3347;the film is good and I recommend it.
3348;I was hoping for an epic, instead I got a really good action flick.
3349;Three stars instead four due to studio induced Oscar pandering
3350;Tom Cruise does an excellent job of acting.
3351;I believe this film won an academy award.
3352;The fighting scenes are great.
3353;All in all, even it's not a masterpiece I still enjoyed watching it.
3354;This is one of the best movies that I have ever watched.
3355;I think that it brings you into the plot.
3356;I found myself siding with the Samurai.
3357;The opening part of it with the dream of the white tiger flag and then seeing it happen in the first battle really help to set the movie's great level.
3358;this is definitely a movie that you will get a lot of enjoyment not only in owning it but in being able to watch it anytime you want and anytime you want to feel that there is still hope.
3359;the story is enjoyable and entertaining.
3360;"Anyone who enjoyed ""Shogun"" will also probably enjoy the Last Samurai!"
3361;I love historical movies of any kind and although this was a somewhat romanticized view of the historical events that occured, i still thought it was a very good film.
3362;I also bought the soundtrack.
3363;It is a timeless story of a lost culture in which dignity, respect and perseverance are honored.
3364;Gaining strength, he walks freely through the village and discovers that each person, every day, is striving to do each task well and to overcome obstacles along the way.
3365;He trains in martial arts with the children, then with the men .
3366;first as recreation, then with a growing respect for their dedication and ability.
3367;I really enjoyed this movie.
3368;This movie has action/adventure and yet has at least one scene which has brought a tear to everyone I know that's seen this movie.
3369;In a nutshell, this movie shows what respect is all about!
3370;But the cinematography is beautiful and adds on to the story.
3371;Ken and Tom keep the audience within the realm of the film with their natural performances.
3372;This is probably one of Tom Cruise's best movies along with Collateral.
3373;When he is captured by the Japan Samurai rebel forces, the natural scenery and the clash of cultures is perfect.
3374;The fighting scenes and the use of nature to drive the story is very effectively done.
3375;This director knows what he is doing as he has directed other movies like Blood Diamond, which was also a great story with stunning resolution to the African vegetation and culture.
3376;Another one of Tom Cruise's awesome performances.
3377;A great story of how the human spirit transcends color, race and ethnicity to side with one's beliefs of right and wrong.
3378;Great direction, very well shot.
3379;I really enjoyed the cinematography and the culture of the Sumurai.
3380;This movie is an exquisite masterpiece of cinematography and direction.
3381;The Academy missed its important message and passed on an excellent acting performance by Tom Cruise.
3382;filmed in New Zealand it takes on the persona of 19th century Japan.
3383;The villages and costumes are so authentic that you are transported back into a beautiful time, with lush vegetation and a purity of living.
3384;The film is soothing and spiritual despite the battle scenes.
3385;the battle scenes are epic and real, extreme attention is given to each and every detail.
3386;The warrior costumes appear historically accurate and a tribute to the Samurai culture.
3387;Cruise is captured in battle by the Samurai and eventually adapts to the culture that heals his integrity again.
3388;The sword fighting scenes are flawless and powerful.
3389;His adaption into this ancient society is impressively spiritual and he gains his belief in himself through code of the Samurai: Honesty Justice, Duty Loyality, Polite Courtesy, Compassion, Complete Sincerity, Heroic Courage and Honor.
3390;It is an interesting concept to debate.
3391;This is one of Tom cruise best movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3392;This is a great movie about the Samurai,it is simply the best movie!!!!!!!!
3393;This is a wonderful movie if you like war/soldier/warrior/hero action and drama.
3394;But if you like the Samurai stories, you'll like the film.
3395;"Proceed with caution
3396;I was able to see an advanced showing last night and i was very impressed.
3397;I had very high expectations going into it, and I was not let down.
3398;Tom Cruise is very good (as usual) and does not just rely on his good looks.
3399;The movie moves along at a pretty good pace and doesn't seem like 2 and a half hours long.
3400;The film is also very beautiful to look at.
3401;If that does not bother you, I strongly encourage you to watch it.
3402;I thought it was an excellent film and the theatre roared with applause after the film was over.
3403;This movie is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.
3404;It has action, humor, and lots of emotional moments.
3405;ken watanbe is an amazing actor and has the talent and focus to carry off a deliberately lopsided work of fiction that offers nothing but blood thirsty, pagan, animals for the japanese and stupid, but sacred, cows for the anglos.
3406;filmed beautifully, with watanabe hoisting all the poise and grace of the movie on his shoulders, trailing behind him with lilliputian rage is an american actor who's impotence and flatulence hasn't changed since 1984.
3407;Had my FULL Attention the entire Movie!The Impact was not to Judge without knowing the Entire Story of any Situation!Consider this a Movie that Teaches you about Prejudging also has such a Great Story Line you will remember this Movie for a Long Time !
3408;The Last Samurai was a great trip down memory lane, a movie both educational and entertaining.
3409;Thanks for making it possible.
3410;A solid war film with epic battle scenes.
3411;the way it should be for historical narrative.)
3412;what we have here is an eclipsing of the times.
3413;devouring nation ravaging itself and thereby allowing outsiders to ravage it further.
3414;divides the nation and sets the stage for an unforgettable clash of political ideology.
3415;You know, I don't know why, but I love this movie.
3416;There are so many things in this movie that suck me in, that I just love watching this over and over again.
3417;the beautiful sound track that sucks you into the world and makes you want to visit this idyllic Japan.
3418;But honestly, there's a reason for it.
3419;It let's you be a foreigner in a strange land and shows you their culture, their way of life, their values.
3420;it shows you that your enemies don't always necessarily have to be your enemies.
3421;it's a powerful movie, and notice that I didn't mention Tom Cruise until now?
3422;That's because, although he was fine in the movie.
3423;He's just there to serve as MY avatar, so that I am interacting with these fascinating people.
3424;He's there, so that I can see what happens to the Japanese and their way of life.
3425;if you have the time, definitely give this movie a watch.
3426;The final battle alone and it's amazing soundtrack is well worth the price of admission.
3427;The portrayal of Tom Cruise as the last samurai was outstanding as was the rest of cast, crew and director.
3428;Although the breathtaking battle scenes are its centerpiece, """"The Last Samurai"""" tries to be more than just a big."""
3429;His performance as a drunk is also an eye.
3430;The bottom line though is that this is a movie worth seeing.
3431;The cinematography is stunning, the storyline is touching, it is well acted by its Japanese cast, and the closing battle is like nothing you've ever seen before.
3432;Just know that the Japan you see in this movie has a lot of Hollywood in it.
3433;The situation, the final wresting of power from the last of the feudal lords, is historically true.
3434;It addresses the Japanese culture with knowledge and respect.
3435;It brings to life one of the defining moments of Japanese history, possibly the one moment that marks the start of modern era.
3436;The costuming and architecture are beautiful.
3437;It presents the bushido, the samurai ethic, as an all.
3438;still, I have reservations about semi.
3439;Takamori's final battle is an historical event, and this presentation of it is fiction.
3440;Lord knows that Americans need more exposure to world history and that this flick is an enticing way to present it.
3441;Still, the movie blurs the line between fact and fiction, between entertainment and events as documented.
3442;"A beautiful movie following the same template in ""Dances with Wolves""."
3443;There is a nice touch in the love triangle between our hero and the wife of his fallen enemy .
3444;but that he comes to honor.
3445;What an interesting feature that adds marvelously to this template.
3446;But modern weapons win and the honor of fighting is lost.
3447;this is a beautiful movie and provokes thinking.
3448;If you have any interst in Japanese History or culture I highly recomend it.
3449;on the first battle between Algren's Japanese trained troops and a samurai group led by Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe), Nathan is captured yet kept alive after showing immense courage on the battlefield ground.
3450;while in captivity, Algren discovers the samurai code, honor, pride, love, and build a personal fantastic friendship with Katsumoto.
3451;The last Samurai is a great story The acting is great I believe this is one of if not the best Tom cruise film.
3452;If you enjoy stories about the Samurai or martial arts this movie is definitely for you.
3453;"wHAT WORKS: The movie is beautiful to look at
3454;The story is generally engrossing and it's great to envision how the Samurai may have really lived in Japan hundreds of years ago.
3455;Speaking of which, the costumes and sets are outstanding, no doubt about it.
3456;wHAT DOESN'T WORK: I enjoyed the movie, I did, but the plot is obviously taken from """"Dances With Wolves,"""" a very superior film."""
3457;"off of ""Dances With Wolves,"" the story takes place in the modern world, so it definitely possesses its own uniqueness)."
3458;"BOTTOM LINE: Although The Last Samurai"" could be subtitled ""Dances with the Last Dogmen of Arabia,"" it's still quite enjoyable."
3459;"obviously influenced ""Samurai"" will likely rate ""The Last Samurai"" higher than I have."
3460;If you really like this film and haven't seen these other movies I've mentioned, I encourage you to pick 'em up ASAP .
3461;"especially ""The Last of the Mohicans"" and ""Dances With Wolves,"" which are two of the best movies ever filmed, period."
3462;first off, Mr. Cruise did a pretty decent job.
3463;His japanese was very good for a non.
3464;His dialogue was even humourous at times, and he was able to do the fight scenes so that it looked genuine.
3465;however, Ken Watanabe deserves the most credit .
3466;he was funny and sarcastic.
3467;He was able to deliver funny lines without even a change in his facial features, which makes it all the more humourous.
3468;overall, the film was very well executed, there was some comedy, which helps you to maintain your sanity while you're sitting at the edge of your seat and biting your fingernails.
3469;A movie that truly plucks at your heartstrings as it presents the possibility of the extinction of a beautiful culture.
3470;A lot of bonus content, and I was impressed by the Japanese revolution at that time.
3471;By the way, the actress is very beautiful!
3472;The Last Samurai is a great pieace of film making, the battle scenes and actings are superb!!!
3473;"and even as a chinese, i was touched by the spirit of Samurai, how much ""Honour"" means to them."
3474;"i do agree with some of the stuff in the film, ""when they wake up in the morning, everything they do, they try the best they can."
3475;"there is something special about this place""."
3476;that is the spirit japanese have, and one of the reason Japan become such a strong nation.
3477;they think they want to be the best, and want the honour.
3478;I regard this film as a great entertainment!
3479;For anyone else, especially those with friends or family who may be returning from serving overseas in Iraq or Afganastan, this movie can help give you a small glimpse of the conflict those who fight face.
3480;And his personal road to reclaiming his personal honor, and mental health.
3481;It also shows how we can learn from other cultures if we just take the time to understand them.
3482;Technology and all it's benefits are great, but it's the human spirit that is mankinds greatest tool or weapon, depending on how it's used at any time.
3483;I liked the bokken scenes and the battle scenes the most.
3484;Overall, the movie was entertaining and interesting to watch how the Japanese people wrestled between modernization of Japan and preservation of the old Japan.
3485;Great movie saw it a while ago in the theaters when it was just released.
3486;Now that I have it on Blu ray I can watch it whenever.
3487;Absolutely great film, I have not met very many who don't like it.
3488;What the heck?This film should be .3,000,000,000,000,000 stars!
3489;Ok, yes the movie has plenty of beautiful imagery, it showcases the samurai traditions, and it respects that.
3490;Dig deeper and you'll realize that what this movie is saying is .
3491;It shows an insight on what how the samurais lived, their beliefs and their values.
3492;The acting was superb, the storyline was riveting, the landscape was beautiful, the music was captivating, and the battle scenes.
3493;Stories that involve a learning process and finally understanding the ways of another is what I love to see in my movies, so I really do applaud the movie for what it does.
3494;The Last Samurai is an excellent film, respectful of its source material even while telling a fictional story.
3495;"The ""foreigner joins a warrior culture, taking on their strange dress and winning their respect"" story is well."
3496;"themed ""Shogun,"" which is based on the life of Miura Anjin/William Adams."
3497;The warrior code of Bushido is not explained, and the lifestyle is completely romanticized, yet this is a movie and not a history text.
3498;And there are ninjas, which improves every film.
3499;"in the vein of the big Hollywood epics, ""The Last Samurai"" serves up healthy doses of sweeping score, beautiful vistas and Japan."
3500;The country has rarely looked so beautiful, although I bet some technicians spent plenty of time computer.
3501;The samurai armor,while not historically accurate, looks beautiful on film.
3502;There are more than a few scenes that leap beautifully from a Kurosawa flick.
3503;A great looking cast helps as well.
3504;The Last Samurai has some good lessons for modern Japan, and some good entertainment for us all.
3505;The acting, as with most Cruise movies, is about par, the only decent performance comming from Ken Watanabe for Katsumoto.
3506;The characters lack uniqueness and originality, making the movie a mission to watch, as they all follow the same predictable pattern.
3507;there is very little to credit this film and it provides itself as another mere supplement for my love of Japanese orientated movies, will there ever be one that is is comletely satisfactory?
3508;Interesting thing is whole story with Japanese revolution from samurai to new age is by a American soldier and a British reporter.
3509;Well, show by Tom Cruise is also excellent.
3510;If you want a great movie with beautiful scenery, great story, and HUGE battle scenes, watch this masterpiece.
3511;It fits perfectly in my collection between Braveheart, Glory, Dances with Wolves, and Saving Private Ryan.
3512;regardless this movie is incredible and is essential for anyone into epic history/war movies.
