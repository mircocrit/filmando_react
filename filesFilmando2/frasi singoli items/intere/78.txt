I:8578;1;it's a joy to watch and a joy to live.
I:8578;2;What is your favorite movie of all time?
I:8578;3;When people ask me that, the first that comes to mind is African Queen starring the most talented actress I've ever seen, Katharine Hepburn, and Bogie at his best, not as a tough guy but as a real character .
I:8578;4;And it gives you a happy little ending there too.
I:8578;5;Samuel is shocked by the events and dies.
I:8578;6;The personal interactions keep the story going.
I:8578;7;There is another perilous passage through rocks.
I:8578;8;A heavy rain raises the river and lifts the boat, they drift into the lake.
I:8578;9;The presence of the gunboat is a new hazard.
I:8578;10;There is a happy ending, mission accomplished.
I:8578;11;"I wonder how this follows the novel or real history?PS If you browse the book you will find a much richer and complex story
I:8578;12;Filming on location in Africa with early.
I:8578;13;fifties technology was absolutely grueling, and that's reflected in the look of the film.
I:8578;14;ray, but it is without a doubt the best this film has ever looked.
I:8578;15;Yet, it is still 100% delightful still today.
I:8578;16;The acting, story line and filming are all superb.
I:8578;17;Was it enjoyed as much the first time as it was the 100th time?
I:8578;18;Bogart is easy, on the eyes, ears, and soul.
I:8578;19;He was funny, captivating, and in control of every scene he was involved.
I:8578;20;They were great to watch on.
I:8578;21;I loved what 50s cinema tried when doing a destination shoot.
I:8578;22;"Either way, these are the characters that create ""The African Queen"", whether you like them or not, they are with you throughout the journey."
I:8578;23;The cinematography will definitely need a strong re.
I:8578;24;The story itself keeps you seatbelted to your seat for the 104 minutes .
I:8578;25;Finicky with the characters , what juggles my mind with this film more of the overall platter than just one part of the serving.
I:8578;26;I didn't connect with the character, that's obvious, the story was fun .
I:8578;27;The boat itself was actually the scariest part of the film because of the cramp living area.
I:8578;28;"overall, ""The African Queen"" is a classic."
I:8578;29;It is a classic, however, that is slowly deteriorating over time.
I:8578;30;able, and the acting (albeit fun) seemed cheap by the end.
I:8578;31;Descriptions could mean life or death, and only the printed page will give us a true sense of emotion.
I:8578;32;Bogey is the character that steals the show, while Africa .
I:8578;33;A classic yes, but will it remain that way?
I:8578;34;I think its Bogarts best film.
I:8578;35;ray and can be enjoyed over and over again.
I:8578;36;thank you guys who put this film on Blu.
I:8578;37;It is one of a kind and with Katherine Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart it can't lose!
I:8578;38;I recommend it for anyone.
I:8578;39;The old movies are still the best.
I:8578;40;Bogart and Hepburn are at their best in this movie about two symbiotic characters (Charlie and Rosy) who, despite being from opposite ends of the social spectrum, link up to achieve a common goal.
I:8578;41;To me, the film is an egalitarian love story.
I:8578;42;At the same time, we enjoy watching them both become British heroes as they instill in each other the courage and determination needed to fulfill their objective: Rosy persuades Charlie to rig up the African Queen as a home.
I:8578;43;he won an Oscar for his performance, anyway.
I:8578;44;With its minimal cast the movie is fast.
I:8578;45;The screenplay and music are wonderful.
I:8578;46;The acting is top drawer.
I:8578;47;i can watch movies (and actors) of this calibre again.
I:8578;48;again and find something new with every viewing.
I:8578;49;This is wonderful entertainment for all ages.
I:8578;50;This is my favorite movie
I:8578;51;This movie is one of the best ever made.
I:8578;52;Neither of them were young or particularly attractive by today's standards and yet they are compelling here because they are believable and you find yourself rooting for them.
I:8578;53;If you have any sense of adventure you will like it.
I:8578;54;it's a great film, has some wonderful moments in it.
I:8578;55;The bigger story is the ability to stand strong through all things and that's precisely what Hepburn brings to the film.
I:8578;56;classic great movie,wonderful story and acting.
I:8578;57;love these older movies and the stars of that era.
I:8578;58;The sound and picture was clear with great color.
I:8578;59;Bogart and Hepburn were great together
I:8578;60;Two legendary stars at the height of their faculties and abilities, plus, a to.
I:8578;61;No CGI here folks, just talent, talent, talent!
I:8578;62;Watching it, I love how the beauty and difference of Africa shines throughout the movie.
I:8578;63;"Like all good journeys, the travels of ""Charlie"" and ""Rosie"" result in transformation."
I:8578;64;It gives great joy to see two great stars convey transformation and romance within the simple story of a trip downriver.
I:8578;65;As another reviewer I read noted, a love story centered on a middle.
I:8578;66;although depictions of native peoples may be stereotyped, the characters also show a deep and surprising love of the continent.
I:8578;67;A wonderful movie that will not fail to satisfy!
I:8578;68;watching it, it is still a great film.
I:8578;69;But, this is a story, and some really great actors doing some really great acting.
I:8578;70;Do yourself a favor and watch it.
I:8578;71;ray] [UK Release] From the Golden Age of cinema The African Queen is a truly magnificent film adapted from a novel by C. s. Forester.
I:8578;72;winning portrayal of Charlie Allnut, the slovenly, gin.
I:8578;73;the African Queen may well be the perfect adventure film, its roller.
I:8578;74;Along with masterful direction from John Huston, the wonderful script makes this a rare treat indeed.
I:8578;75;This is a fine example of how todays technologies can protect and preserve classic films both digitally and photo.
I:8578;76;ray Review 'The African Queen' has been consistently praised and admired by critics and audiences alike since its 1951 premiere, but for several years John Huston's stirring romantic adventure also carried the dubious distinction of being the only picture on the AFI's list of the 100 Greatest American Movies yet to see a digital release.
I:8578;77;and let me tell you, the wait has been worth it.
I:8578;78;Classic movie fans who don't rhapsodize over this superior effort, which breathes new life into this venerable drama, should head straight to the optometrist, because 'The African Queen' is a kingly specimen that will thrill even the most discriminating high.
I:8578;79;notable for its ambitious location shooting in the Belgian Congo, colourful production history, terrific chemistry between stars Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn, and sweet, captivating story (based on the novel by C. s. Forester of Horatio Hornblower fame), 'The African Queen' scored big upon its initial release and hasn't lost any of its lustre since.
I:8578;80;water shipmates spar, bicker, and ultimately become smitten.
I:8578;81;Charlie and Rose's romance is as unlikely and unexpected as it is endearing and cute, and the middle.
I:8578;82;odds attitude and core values of guts and perseverance, but more likely stems from the irresistible appeal of its improbable hero and heroine.
I:8578;83;oiled military machine, is both ludicrous and delightful, and Bogart and Hepburn play their roles to the hilt.
I:8578;84;Never for a moment does their affection seem anything less than genuine, and with a mastery of their craft that few others in the industry possess, the two legendary actors infuse their eccentric, charismatic characters with palpable warmth and spirit.
I:8578;85;no stranger to big, outdoorsy tales of indomitable will and chutzpah, John Huston (who teamed with Bogart on the equally rugged and immortal 'The Treasure of the Sierra Madre' just three years before) deftly blends rousing physical sequences with scenes of exquisite tenderness and charm.
I:8578;86;The director's keen sense of rhythm keeps the story flowing like the river itself, ramping up tension at some points, gently drifting along in others, to create a comfortable mood punctuated by stunning landscape and wildlife shots.
I:8578;87;The marvellous script (which he co. wrote with James Agee) contains several memorable exchanges, and despite the fact that most of the film is a two.
I:8578;88;person dialogue, the characters are so richly drawn and brought so vividly to life by the actors, we never tire of them.
I:8578;89;amazingly, 'The African Queen' was not nominated for Best Picture, but both Huston and Hepburn did receive nods for Best Director and Actress, respectively.
I:8578;90;Charlie and Rose, as sweaty and dishevelled as they often appear, and as quirky and stubborn as they often act, are one of the movies' immortal couples, ranking right up there with Scarlett and Rhett, Rick and Ilsa, and Jack and Rose.
I:8578;91;And 'The African Queen' is still quite an awesome film.
I:8578;92;Working from the original three.
I:8578;93;taking clarity and sharpness, lush colour, and plenty of high.
I:8578;94;The African countryside and wildlife, especially a herd of crocodiles, nearly jump off the screen, often producing a you.
I:8578;95;The original mono track gets the job done, producing full.
I:8578;96;bodied sound with plenty of tonal depth and presence.
I:8578;97;Dynamic range is quite good, with high ends resisting distortion and low ends possessing good weight, and the action.
I:8578;98;And just because the track is front.
I:8578;99;Best of all, dialogue is always clear and easy to comprehend, and Allan Gray's music score benefits from solid fidelity.
I:8578;100;A truly amazing and fascinating audio commentary.
I:8578;101;embracing Chaos: Making The African Queen [60:00] An outstanding in.
I:8578;102;it comes with a very good audio track and a very strong audio commentary by the late Jack Cardiff.
I:8578;103;a territory only, then keep in mind that the UK Blu.
I:8578;104;ray release is Region B/2 locked and worth purchasing a Multi.
I:8578;105;While I understand why some like this movie, `love' is another equation, and so the response to this film and to a lesser degree the performances within it are astounding to me.
I:8578;106;sure, the film is gorgeous to look at, but pretty is only part of the equation.
I:8578;107;this brings me to the performances.
I:8578;108;We'll start with Bogart, since he actually won the Oscar.
I:8578;109;I consider his `Casablanca' performance one of the best of all time and find that his each and every performance is at least entertaining.
I:8578;110;I was shocked by this, because I am a fan, but that is honestly what I saw.
I:8578;111;I think that she is serviceable always, but only great once in a while.
I:8578;112;She wears concern so well that her face alone was acting circles around Bogart.
I:8578;113;Starring two of the most loved actors of their time.
I:8578;114;This is Bogart at his best and Katherine Hepburn is superb.
I:8578;115;The story is terrific, Scenery is luscious.
I:8578;116;It's a must movie for any collection.
I:8578;117;Bogart and Hepburn play two diametrically opposed personalities in this classic film set during World War I.
I:8578;118;She is a prim and proper, middle.
I:8578;119;What follows is part comedy, part tense drama, and part high adventure.
I:8578;120;this is a wonderful movie.
I:8578;121;The acting is superb (Bogie got an Oscar for Best Actor ), the story is excellent, and the scenery is beautiful (it was shot on location).
I:8578;122;"Great seeing this ""Classic"" again after so many years."
I:8578;123;Of course some of the special effects are outmoded, but the acting is fantastic, the drama palpable, and there is edge.
I:8578;124;"seat suspense.5 stars all the way for ""The African Queen."""
I:8578;125;This is essential for anyone that appreciates one of the finest movies ever made and probably Mr. Bogart's best role.
I:8578;126;Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn in a duel of personalities that come together in a great finally.
I:8578;127;There's a reason The African Queen has survived the decades and is known by many as a truly remarkable classic.
I:8578;128;These two talented performers star as two polar.
I:8578;129;Hilarity, romance, and lots of action and hardship ensue as this seemingly ill.
I:8578;130;I was on the edge of my seat through so much of the film, engrossed in what was happening on screen.
I:8578;131;The African Queen is inarguably a masterpiece, and I would highly recommend it to anybody!
I:8578;132;The African Queen has something for everybody.
I:8578;133;It is a war, romance, comedy, action/adventure, travel log movie of the highest caliber.
I:8578;134;Katherine Hepburn shines as the stalwart, English, spinster, Rose Sayer, who finds herself alone in Africa when her missionary brother dies as a result of an attack on their village by the Germans in 1914.
I:8578;135;Her resolve far surpasses his better judgment and he takes them on a trip that he knows will surely end both of their lives.
I:8578;136;I sat down and watched this two times the evening I received it, it is still an awesomely wonderful movie.
I:8578;137;, it is a great copy of the original, no problems with it at all!
I:8578;138;Taking place in 1914, even after 60 years it holds up well.
I:8578;139;To understand the difficulty that was encountered in using this process on location, I highly recommend the accompanying hour.
I:8578;140;I cannot imagine the film ever looking better than it does here and the plus of the documentary, added to the fact that you can get it for 15 bucks makes it a no.
I:8578;141;even after all these years the story line and acting are riveting and engaging.
I:8578;142;I bought this for my husband for Christmas as it is his favorite movie of all time.
I:8578;143;This is a real classic.
I:8578;144;Put together two great stars and this is what you got.
I:8578;145;"i was never a great fan of John Huston's ""The African Queen"", as I viewed it's television airings, over the years."
I:8578;146;"new, and I could finally truly savor the remarkable performances of Bogart and Hepburn (Bogie won the 'Best Actor' Oscar in the role, beating, among others, Brando in ""A Streetcar Named Desire"", and Clift in ""A Place in the Sun"", and after viewing this edition, I can honestly say he deserved it!)"
I:8578;147;Jack Cardiff's technicolor cinematography is breathtaking (even if he calls it 'routine', in the marvellous 'Making of' documentary, included), and the Agee/Huston adaptation of C. s. Forrester's novel crackles with witty one.
I:8578;148;The boxed edition also includes a one.
I:8578;149;"hour Lux radio adaptation, starring Bogie and Greer Garson, Katharine Hepburn's funny written account of the production (""The Making of The African Queen or How I Went to Africa with Bogart, Bacall and Huston and Almost Lost My Mind""), lobby card photos, and a four."
I:8578;150;panel recreation of how classic technicolor works.
I:8578;151;lots of goodies at a very reasonable price!Do yourself a favor.
I:8578;152;Watch the film again after watching the extras.
I:8578;153;"Two of Hollywood's Best Actors
I:8578;154;Beautiful African locations are pure eye.
I:8578;155;candy and Bogart and Hepburn are a joy to watch.
I:8578;156;Also with some exciting adventure sequences, a beautiful script, and, as always, perfect direction by John Huston.
I:8578;157;This movie is worthy of repeated viewings and is one of the all.
I:8578;158;From a scale of 1.10 I give this film a 10!
I:8578;159;This colorized version of African Queen is super!
I:8578;160;It was a great visual pleasure to watch this version.
I:8578;161;The color gave this classic movie a whole new life.
I:8578;162;she has Alzheimer's and is really enjoying watching the old classic movies!
I:8578;163;It's pure and refreshing and I highly recommend it!
I:8578;164;directed by John Huston!Just so well done.
I:8578;165;Well worth watching at least once.
I:8578;166;But the sparks just weren't there.
I:8578;167;but I love this movie!
I:8578;168;acted, spectacular scenery and a few unexpected surprises .
I:8578;169;this movie holds up very well after nearly 50 years.
I:8578;170;okay, to the plot .
I:8578;171;swilling skipper of the African Queen , a beat.
I:8578;172;Rose believes the two should somehow contribute to the war effort.
I:8578;173;a very memorable movie that is well worth the money.
I:8578;174;The actors are people who can actually act and do so at a very high level.
I:8578;175;The dialogue was excellent with just the right mix of humor and drama.
I:8578;176;"The African Queen is a movie for all ages, it is a prime example of what ""Film Makers"" can make, that is fun to watch."
I:8578;177;As I said in my title, this is the one to get.
I:8578;178;It even has English subtitles and a commentary track.
I:8578;179;Bogie and Hepburn light up the screen in this thriller.
I:8578;180;Adtion, adventure and a love story to boot.
I:8578;181;A must have for anyone who loves classic films.
I:8578;182;The movie African Queen is a great old film of simpler time with two of the great actors and a good story to tell.
I:8578;183;it is a classic and I am so glad Amazon.
I:8578;184;When a seedy river cargo boat captain and a lady from America who is somewhat on the Puritan side are forced to flee downriver from German troops, their adventures and trials are well chronicled by this fine film.
I:8578;185;however, the story and adventures are really just a set piece to exhibit the fine one on one acting between two legends of the profession, Humphrey Bogart and Katherine Hepburn.
I:8578;186;The initial antipathy that gradually resolves into mutual respect and affection thru the course of their trial by fire is entirely believable, very funny, and often painful (for the characters, not the viewer).
I:8578;187;Bogart delivers what may have been his best acting performance.
I:8578;188;this is a must see classic for all fans of great cinema, and is a sterling example of how two top notch actors can hold the stage and your rapt attention virtually by themselves for an entire movie.
I:8578;189;This is one of the best adventure films ever made.
I:8578;190;Many movies made today are fun to watch but after a few years they just collect dust.
I:8578;191;This movie is one you will enjoy year after year.
I:8578;192;It has romance, action, hardship, and the effects of war.
I:8578;193;Along the way they learn to work together, see the good in each other, find love, and fight for a common cause even if it means risking their life.
I:8578;194;Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn are excellent together and this timeless classic will go on delighting new audience's for generations to come.
I:8578;195;Maybe the best of Bogie's films.
I:8578;196;I loved how they played off each other.
I:8578;197;Our whole family loves this movie, but this is my husband's favorite movie.
I:8578;198;There are a lot of movies I watched as a kid, and thought they were special.
I:8578;199;This movie holds up easily, and still has all it's magic.
I:8578;200;I have to say, all the people assoicated with this movie (not just two of our favorite actors), did a great job.
I:8578;201;I'm very grateful it is on Blu.
I:8578;202;ray doesn't have a lot of extras, but it does have a feature on the making of, which I thought was pretty cool.
I:8578;203;I can't say I am interested in how movies are done, I like it being a mystery, but I do enjoy hearing about the stories behind the making of a film, the human stories.
I:8578;204;It also has numerous language options, and CC, which I like having for all movies I watch.
I:8578;205;":)On a side note, the book/movie ""White Hunter, Black Heart"" adds a bit more to the story as well."
I:8578;206;I am sure the disc is in great shape and would place very well.
I:8578;207;Bogie and Hepburn are great together in this film!still a classic.
I:8578;208;It was in perfect condition.
I:8578;209;time favorite movie and leading actors.
I:8578;210;I am not a Humphrey Bogart fan but I have always loved this movie.
I:8578;211;The Blu Ray transfer is top notch.
I:8578;212;This will be the best you have ever seen the African Queen bar none.
I:8578;213;I was a little surprised when I first saw this as many movies of this grand scale are of the wide screen variety, but that was just the technology of the time.
I:8578;214;This detracts nothing from this great production.
I:8578;215;Very happy with this version and you will be too.
I:8578;216;Yet, there are more twists and turns than they encounter in the river, and for any fan of classic movies, this is a must see.
I:8578;217;On the ship they where trying sink they got married to each other and are happy!!
I:8578;218;This I've seen many, many times and still love to watch it.
I:8578;219;Except for the unrealistically civil way Mr. Allnut responded to his gin being poured into the river, and then his wonderful behavior without the gin, it was an amazing journey.
I:8578;220;This movie held up well to time and transfered well to Blu.
I:8578;221;The special featurette was good too .
I:8578;222;This movie is perhaps one of the top best 20 movies ever made by Hollywood.
I:8578;223;they were two of the very best actors to ever come out of Hollywood.
I:8578;224;It was liked even by the young adults in my family!
I:8578;225;I reccommend it to everyone, young and old alike!
I:8578;226;Katharine Hepburn's expressions alone are worth the watch.
I:8578;227;A story of heroism, love, redemption and possibilites, filmed mostly on location in Africa, the great director, John Huston, creates magic with just two actors and sometimes cheesy effects with a toy boat in a dirty puddle in your backyard.
I:8578;228;A must for any armchair traveler.
I:8578;229;"I remember seeing ""African Queen"" years a ago in a movie theater."
I:8578;230;To me it is an outstanding Adventure, Drama and Romance all in one.
I:8578;231;Thanks for your good service and reasonable price.
I:8578;232;I will beback and tell others to check you out!Sincerely, Jack Johnson.
I:8578;233;African Queen may be an old movie, but my husband and I think it is a great one!
I:8578;234;Those two actors are the best out of the 40's.
I:8578;235;"The dialogue was real
I:8578;236;I am quite disappointed, This is my wife's favorite movie so we were very happy to get it.
I:8578;237;Kathryn Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart are at their best in this classic film set in Africa.
I:8578;238;A wonderful story of an unlikely relationship that is wholly believable.
I:8578;239;You can easily see that they used miniatures but I always watch that part closely because it's so funny.
I:8578;240;This commemorative edition is wonderful.
I:8578;241;I loved this movie when the only way you could watch it was to go to the movie theatre.
I:8578;242;And I must add that the commemorative edition is worth the extra money.
I:8578;243;This is a clean family worthy film.
I:8578;244;I have always loved this movie and just wanted to see it again.
I:8578;245;It's a likable classic film because of those two famous actors, a nice romance, good adventure and even some comedy thrown in to the mix.
I:8578;246;Hopefully, they'll produce a sharp Blu.
I:8578;247;ray disc of this film.
I:8578;248;The story also a little unusual in that neither lead actor is in his/her prime, meaning it's almost a middle.
I:8578;249;to be honest, the film does slow down a bit in the beginning of Bogie and Hepburn's romance but the last 30 minutes finish strong with one obstacle after another hitting the pair of adventurers, and it's interesting to watch.
I:8578;250;I've seen this movie so many times and always enjoyed it.
I:8578;251;ray edition and it was FABULOUS!
I:8578;252;It made a great movie into an excellent movie!
I:8578;253;It wasexciting and had great actors.
I:8578;254;I just thought itwould be fun to own it and watch it again.
I:8578;255;Adventure,great acting and a good story.
I:8578;256;Beautiful restoration job with the film looking better than it has at any time since it's original release.
I:8578;257;"While not as stunning as the ""Wizard of Oz"" and ""Gone With the WInd"" restorations it still has that glorious Technicolor look."
I:8578;258;ray is a new one hour documentary on the making of the film.
I:8578;259;It's very good and in high definition too.
I:8578;260;The film holds up beautifully after almost 60 years and has never looked better.
I:8578;261;ray is worth the money.
I:8578;262;Stick with the regular version, it's nearly as good.
I:8578;263;The restoration of this film classic was remarkable.
I:8578;264;Now I can swat mosquitoes and ride down the river with two fabulous actors.
I:8578;265;What a pleasure it is to have this classic film preserved.
I:8578;266;Humphrey Bogart, Katherine Hepburn and an intriguing exotic plot.
I:8578;267;ray version makes the best of this, presenting it the way it would have looked and sounded in the best theatres of the day.
I:8578;268;screen, no stereo sound, but truly outstanding film.
I:8578;269;The acting is superb, the writing excellent, and the African jungle is breath.
I:8578;270;You have to admire Bogart and Hepburn for enduring the obvious discomfort and danger the filming required of them.
I:8578;271;You really believe in these characters, and their budding romance, and you really want them to survive, succeed, and live happily ever after.
I:8578;272;This is a classic movie that doesn't require you to be a movie critic to appreciate.
I:8578;273;It is just plain entertaining.
I:8578;274;bogart and Hepburn shine in this classic.
I:8578;275;i think that it's one of Bogart's finest performances.
I:8578;276;Suppose you lived in the late 1940s and early 1950s and you read this story in book form, then closed your eyes and said: Call John Huston and ask if he could convince Katharine Hepburn to join him in Africa along with Humphrey Bogart to film a sweat ridden, feverish film set during the outbreak of World War I and convince an audience they were entertained.
I:8578;277;but it was done and much to the delight of audiences then and even now as this classic is a new and as fresh as it was when it was released.
I:8578;278;ray really makes a huge difference,the color and clarity are stunning !!
I:8578;279;,for what its worth,Im just passing this on to fans of the african queen,I have bought several blu.
I:8578;280;So be happy with what we have got in this Asian import.
I:8578;281;The picture and sound are just fine.
I:8578;282;It's a must and well worth the money.
I:8578;283;This is an excellent movie and Kate is such a strong actress in this movie.
I:8578;284;"I love that voice of hers
I:8578;285;This is one of Bogie's best and the two make an excellent team.
I:8578;286;If you have not seen this, watch it, remember this was done in the 1950's so you won't have CGI, but still a very enjoyable movie.
I:8578;287;One that I own and this movie is a great addition to your collection.
I:8578;288;It is also a nice movie to watch with your woman or family because it is a clean movie, minus leeches, WWI Germans, the river, and the annoying insects.
I:8578;289;"Most of us have seen the movie African Queen many times
I:8578;290;The video had moments of sharp clarity for example the lace trim on Rose's dress in the first scene, mixed with occasional moments of graininess.
I:8578;291;The video on the whole made a positive contribution to the enjoyment of the movie.
I:8578;292;I was delighted to see that it even fit in the rack with my other Blu.
I:8578;293;"In many instances the older comments on history, actors and acting are timeless
I:8578;294;ray remaster of THE AFRICAN QUEEN is the greatest Blu.
I:8578;295;simply, the sound will still be stunning.
I:8578;296;There is no tinniness, it's great to listen to.
I:8578;297;If you are a fan of this movie, or of the classics .
I:8578;298;This movie is a classic.
I:8578;299;One of the truly great performances of Hepburn and Bogart.
I:8578;300;The restored version of The African Queen sparkles.
I:8578;301;The picture is detailed, and the colors are rich.
I:8578;302;The sound is great as well.
I:8578;303;Nevertheless, I highly recommend this version of the film.
I:8578;304;"It is a ""must see."""
I:8578;305;I'll spare the review of the movie itself.
I:8578;306;"this is a ""just fine"" print of the movie."
I:8578;307;A movie featuring 2 of the greatest stars of all time.
I:8578;308;A pleasure to watch and enjoyable throughout.
I:8578;309;thank you for getting this to me so promptly.
I:8578;310;He is enjoying it and I fulfilled his Christmas wish!
I:8578;311;The humor, romance, adventure and happy ending make it a movie I'll keep on watching .
I:8578;312;Yes, it is that good!
I:8578;313;So amazing to me that movies this old are still better than almost any of today and they hold up so well.
I:8578;314;first it is a beautiful and touching love story.
I:8578;315;They're in the middle of Africa during the Great War.
I:8578;316;The beautiful thing about this love story is how Charlie proves his mettle and wins her heart.
I:8578;317;a heart never won before.
I:8578;318;by sheer gumption and by finding the courage he never knew he had.
I:8578;319;egged on and inspired by her relentless strength of character.
I:8578;320;The moment that she realizes, despite all the differences between them, that she loves him is beautifully and exactingly captured by John Huston's superb direction.
I:8578;321;"She has given many outstanding performances
I:8578;322;She is just perfect for the part and delivers every line with style and a deep understanding of her character.
I:8578;323;She allows us to understand that Rose's crazy, nave beliefs about what is possible infect Charlie to the extent that he becomes something more than himself, and it is that self that she falls madly in love with.
I:8578;324;the third reason is the inspired performance by Humphrey Bogart.
I:8578;325;wise, tough guy that Bogart usually plays.
I:8578;326;Yet, so taken with the relative status and the exquisite high.
I:8578;327;toned righteousness of Miss Rose Sayer, he is able to do things that ordinarily he wouldn't try.
I:8578;328;And when she falls in love with him, he is amply rewarded, and the audience loves it.
I:8578;329;i should add that shots of the boat, the African Queen, and of the animals along the river and in the river seemed authentic and atmospherically perfect even though I've seen a couple hundred much more modern African nature videos.
I:8578;330;"by the way, this movie contains the famous quote, spoken by Miss Hepburn: ""Human nature, Mr. Allnut, is what we were put on this earth to rise above."
I:8578;331;Those are two of the best writers to ever work a Hollywood screenplay, and it shows.
I:8578;332;a great filmhas had a wonderful reconstruction i am very pleased with it.
I:8578;333;"What can I say
I:8578;334;One of those classics you have to see!
I:8578;335;Humphrey Bogart and Kathrine Hepburn at their best, the interaction between the two great actors is timeless.
I:8578;336;A great period piece, it is one of those movies that will still be popular for generations.
I:8578;337;This is a classic film and my favorite Bogart flick.
I:8578;338;It's an excellent blend of drama, adventure, and humor.
I:8578;339;When a good one comes out, I'll be throwing the one I bought away.
I:8578;340;Everyone should see this at least once.
I:8578;341;It is a true classic which has stood the test of time.
I:8578;342;I thought Bogart and Hepburn were both excellent in it.
I:8578;343;"ray (disc only) version of ""The African Queen,""and what other commentators have said is true ."
I:8578;344;A big THANKS to the individuals whole created this stunning restoration last year.
I:8578;345;A classic movie with a classic love story.
I:8578;346;I would recommend it for the whole family.
I:8578;347;Excellent rendering of a fine old movie into digital form.
I:8578;348;It was just as enjoyable as the first time I saw it in a theater.
I:8578;349;Bogey's Mister Alllnut is truly a interesting patriot and Hepburn is the perfect foil.
I:8578;350;I've seen this film many times and it never ceases to please.
I:8578;351;Hollywood is an industry that likes to double and triple.
I:8578;352;one of the reasons for this delay is the unique history of the way The African Queen was financed.
I:8578;353;The film was an independent production released in 1951 at a time when the studio system was teetering over the cliff and in its final years.
I:8578;354;John Huston had the clout to finance an independent production, especially with Humphrey Bogart and Katherine Hepburn as co. stars.
I:8578;355;The film would eventually be distributed by United Artists and go on to win a well deserved Oscar for Humphrey Bogart.
I:8578;356;the production is well documented in the Hepburn memoir and the 1953 novel by Peter Viertel, White Hunter, Black Heart.
I:8578;357;This book was made into a terrific 1990 movie directed by and starring Clint Eastwood and makes a great companion to The African Queen.
I:8578;358;Viertel, a friend of Huston, went on location in Africa to work on the screenplay after original writer James Agee had a heart attack.
I:8578;359;Viertel's biggest contribution was the climax of the story.
I:8578;360;ray comes with an excellent one.
I:8578;361;I bought a copy of this release, and I'm happy I did.
I:8578;362;It's a classic and is a perfect example of the way acting should be.
I:8578;363;Again my wife and I love Katharine Hepburn.
I:8578;364;This movie is a Classic of the first degree.
I:8578;365;She was in her fifties when she shot this movie.
I:8578;366;John Huston directed it and a fine job he did too.
I:8578;367;What a joy for true fans of Bogie and Hepburn.
I:8578;368;It was an excellent copy.
I:8578;369;Thanks Amazon and the powers that be for giving us a true classic.
I:8578;370;A true classic and a restored print without any flaws.
I:8578;371;The effects are remarkable considering the state of technology in 1951.
I:8578;372;The process shots and model work are excellent, again considering when it was made.
I:8578;373;One of my top 10 movies!
I:8578;374;Great acting, and a great story of unlikely love that joined together to do a noble and almost crazy mission.
I:8578;375;I always liked the movie.
I:8578;376;Now I can watch it when ever I want.
I:8578;377;amazon was good to deal with.
I:8578;378;The reputation of this deserved classic rests primarily on the shoulders of master director John Huston and his two legendary stars, Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn.
I:8578;379;character high adventure that moves its narrative in a rather contrived manner.
I:8578;380;She concocts an ambitious plot to use the explosives aboard Charlie's boat, The African Queen, as a means to destroy the powerful German gunboat, the Louisa, which rules the large lake at the end of the river.
I:8578;381;Charlie reluctantly agrees, and their perilous journey takes up the bulk of the film.
I:8578;382;what makes the film memorable is how the characters evolve from lonely souls who have given up all hope for happiness in their lives to the heroic defenders of the British Empire whose mutual patriotic dedication turns to love.
I:8578;383;A Huston favorite, Robert Morley has a few effective moments at the beginning as Rose's reverend brother Samuel, and toward the end, Peter Bull brings appropriate Teutonic bluster as the captain of the Louisa.
I:8578;384;obviously inspired by the real.
I:8578;385;life locations he uses in the Congo and Uganda, Huston directs the proceedings with passion, and he brings genuine excitement to scenes such as their conquest of the rapids and Charlie's dredging of the boat through the mud.
I:8578;386;More importantly, he allows the two stars ample room to generate the chemistry that has made this such an enduring classic.
I:8578;387;Jack Cardiff's cinematography is appropriately evocative for the first color film by either star (or for the director for that matter), though some of the later scenes, especially the storm sequence, feel comparatively claustrophobic given that they were obviously shot inside a studio tank in London.
I:8578;388;A classic film that will live on indefinitely.
I:8578;389;Great story, great acting, superb actors.
I:8578;390;The ingrediants that legendary films are made of.
I:8578;391;The African Queen is a great movie.
I:8578;392;The interplay between Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn is superb.
I:8578;393;The moments of tension, and moments of ecstasy are outstanding.
I:8578;394;Plus an interesting view of African wildlife.
I:8578;395;What can be said about a classic movie that stands on it own.
I:8578;396;Just an enjoyable movie to sit back and watch.
I:8578;397;I really, really loved this movie!
I:8578;398;It is a great adventure story, with a wonderful plot and great dialogue between the two stars thrown in as a bonus.
I:8578;399;Also, it features great perfomances from the silver screen's most legendary stars, Katherine Hepburn and Humphery Bogart (both ranked #1 in all.
I:8578;400;drinking Mr. Alnutt (Humphery Bogart, in a Oscar winning performance).
I:8578;401;My summary really doesn't do justice to this movie, but be sure that The African Queen is incredibly entertaining!Additionally, because this movie was actually shot in Africa, the scenery is breathtaking.
I:8578;402;Exciting adventure, romance, great dialogue, quirky characters, and Kate and Bogie!
I:8578;403;I've seen this moving several times on TV and always loved it .
I:8578;404;Amazon's price was also very good, but I would have paid more for this movie great.
I:8578;405;One of my favorite movies ever.
I:8578;406;I love both Hepburn and Bogart and to put them together in a well.
I:8578;407;acted movie, well, that's perfection!
I:8578;408;will get one soon I hope.
I:8578;409;A classic whose story entertains every bit as well today as it did then.
I:8578;410;No matter how many times I watch this movie it always stirs the excitement and adventure centers I the brain.
I:8578;411;Great photography and story without needless violence and foul language.
I:8578;412;Worth viewing more than once
I:8578;413;What a great Michie with some of the greats of the past.
I:8578;414;I enjoyed watching this again after so many years.
I:8578;415;it deserves a spot on anybody's Best Movies List.
I:8578;416;written stories and engaging plots.
I:8578;417;But The African Queen has one other bonus: Katherine Hepburn.
I:8578;418;The political climate there is dangerous, so he has to be both smart and courageous to pursue that freedom.
I:8578;419;She is the sister of a missionary, and her goal is to help people find God.
I:8578;420;She loves that trip down the rapids.
I:8578;421;She begins to develop an interest in the boat itself .
I:8578;422;katherine Hepburn wrote a wonderful diary about the making of the movie, The Making Of The African Queen.
I:8578;423;The African Queen is an essential John Huston movie.
I:8578;424;"the most charming moment in the film happens the morning after Charlie and Rose have obviously been intimate with each other (a moment handled with great sensitivity and discretion), and she says to him, ""Dear ."
I:8578;425;with equal parts humor and tragedy, their struggle is engrossing.
I:8578;426;The resolution of their story is both gratifying and believable.
I:8578;427;This is one of the best romances I've ever seen, but it's not just a chick flick either.
I:8578;428;Pretty good action/adventure movie for it's time.
I:8578;429;Bogart's character is a river.
I:8578;430;trader who hops from village to village delivering goods.
I:8578;431;There is white water and of course romance.
I:8578;432;This is probably my favorite film of Bogie's.
I:8578;433;All with another woman necking with her hubby!
I:8578;434;When I receieved and opened it I discovered that it was a subtitled version for Chinese.
I:8578;435;Enjoy it for what it is, a classic that is well worth watching.
I:8578;436;"Great movie with plenty of excitement
I:8578;437;Bogart and Hepburn make a great pair in this film.
I:8578;438;ray presentation in a home theater environment allows us to experience this film better than in the Movie houses of 1951!!!!
I:8578;439;Although Standard 4:3 Aspect Ratio (before Widescreen introduced in 1953) the beauty and magnificent screen play is acted out by our stars flawlessly.
I:8578;440;The picture color/clarity and Dolby Digital Sound is sooooo vivid you can feel the jungle humidty and heat and hear clearly the sounds of the jungle/river as if you were there.
I:8578;441;Bogie and Hepburns chemistry and presence dominates this beautiful Love Story wonderfully.
I:8578;442;Their bond is so great that they are willing to die rather than to be separated.
I:8578;443;This is truly a heartwarming story of love and loyalty with two legends who literally light up the screen.
I:8578;444;I've always been a big fan of Humphrey Bogart and to a lesser extent Katharine Hepburn but I have to say that the chemistry the two show in this film is remarkable.
I:8578;445;I suppose given the fact that both Spencer Tracy and Hepburn were real life good friends of Bogie and Bacall at the time helped in this regard but it was still nice to see Bogie in colour for a change.
I:8578;446;ray] it was a joy to see just how well this blu.
I:8578;447;"This release also comes with a nice slip case and the special feature documentary ""Making the African Queen"" was pretty good too."
I:8578;448;Just fantastic: love, action, history to make anyone be enthralled.
I:8578;449;And, you get to meet two of the best actors of all time.
I:8578;450;The remastered film was a treat.
I:8578;451;both visual and audio aspects were much improved from the gritty, staticky original and we really enjoyed it.
I:8578;452;Bogart does it again with a superb performance in this very suspenseful and successful film for everybody to relish and be thankful for!!!!!
I:8578;453;And so we take it for granted.
I:8578;454;"Filmed on location in the Congo, the cinematography is remarkably fine without being obtrusive
I:8578;455;"give justly famous performances
I:8578;456;"As an adventure, it has a sense of realism that most adventure stories lack
I:8578;457;And it can be enjoyed by many people of diverse backgrounds and ages without the faintest qualm.
I:8578;458;Sit down with the film and watch it with fresh eyes.
I:8578;459;Great movie about the Germans in Africa and Bogart keeping them from succeeding.
I:8578;460;Hepburn and Bogart also in a fun love story.
I:8578;461;Bogart, Hepburn and the African Queen, an adventure and boat ride ranks as one of Hollywood all time great movies.
I:8578;462;"For those who may never have seen ""The African Queen"" are in for a treat you will not soon forget and for those who hav viewed A. q. many times as I have, its an enjoyment to be repeated over and over."
I:8578;463;One of my most favorite movies of all time.
I:8578;464;If you haven't seen it, please do.
I:8578;465;It will become one of your favorites too!
I:8578;466;We enjoyed the entire movie without a hitch!
I:8578;467;Very satisfied with the service and the movie!!
I:8578;468;They make a very unlikely love interest, but they do it very well.
I:8578;469;Great story with great actors.
I:8578;470;Bogey and Hepburn give amazingly good character portrayals.
I:8578;471;It's also an exciting story, and the locale is beautiful.
I:8578;472;A classic with two wonderful actors.
I:8578;473;One of the memorable films which could rank with Casablanca I really enjoyed seeing it again.
I:8578;474;This has always been a favorite of my wifes' and mine.
I:8578;475;ray makes it that much more enjoyable to watch.
I:8578;476;Colorized version is really pretty good.
I:8578;477;Another example of a lost Hollywood art, just good writing and fine acting.
I:8578;478;I bought this as a gift for my mom and dad.
I:8578;479;Suited its purpose and they loved it.
I:8578;480;A wonderful digitized version of a great classic movie.
I:8578;481;This revelation helps the unlikely duo to appreciate each other and to sustain their fortitude through true adversity.
I:8578;482;The journey in the boat, the African Queen, during a very unstable time period leads to adventure and love in a highly unusual setting.
I:8578;483;This is a must have for Bogart or Hepburn fans!FYI: The clarity of this picture is a must see in itself.
I:8578;484;Gives life to an old classic!
I:8578;485;This is a nice movie and while not compared with the action packed Indiana Jones I think it has some elemnts that were used in the later .
I:8578;486;its quite good for its time , nice visuals yet sometimes documentry like footage was thrown in which I dislike .
I:8578;487;well got my first Blu.
I:8578;488;"the remastering of this film is remarkable
I:8578;489;if you enjoy this movie, basically a love story of two middle age loners, then this is the one that you'll want .
I:8578;490;highly recommended for those who enjoy this classic film!
I:8578;491;The best African Queen Movie made to date.
I:8578;492;Anymovie with Katharine Hepburn ( and I have them all) is fantastic, Thank you.
I:8578;493;I liked the whole idea.
I:8578;494;He had commented how much he had liked this movie years ago.
I:8578;495;I love Bogart and all of his movies are great .
I:8578;496;Great story line, great action and cinematography for it's time and two huge stars.
I:8578;497;It's hard for me to believe that this is the only one of his films that Bogart won a best actor oscar for!
I:8578;498;This is another that I feel is a must have for those of us who truly enjoy the Classics!
I:8578;499;The movie has a good basis and carries out interest from beginning to end.
I:8578;500;The acting is perfect as are the actors.
I:8578;501;This is a Full Screen film.
I:8578;502;Watch the entire movie at once2.
I:8578;503;My brief opinion: The scenery is stunning, Bogart is his usually tremendous self, Hepburn rarely does much for me and the plot isn't really believable.
I:8578;504;This is one of the best movies ever made.
I:8578;505;I've always been a big fan of both Bogart and Hepburn.
I:8578;506;The African Queen is a 1951 adventure film adapted from the 1935 novel of the same name by C. S. Forester.
I:8578;507;The film stars Humphrey Bogart (who won the Academy Award for Best Actor his only Oscar), and Katharine Hepburn with Robert Morley, Peter Bull, Walter Gotell, Richard Marner and Theodore Bikel.
I:8578;508;"This movie should have a ""G"" rating becauseit's a classic film from 1952."
I:8578;509;I liked it then and, I like it now.
I:8578;510;Always liked Bogart and African Queen a favorite.
I:8578;511;The price was reasonable, and I received the Blue Ray disk on time
I:8578;512;I love this movie, can watch it over and over, they are really cute together in this in spite of the real storyline being one of war and death.
I:8578;513;I've loved African Queen since I first saw it in a theater .
I:8578;514;Bogart and Hepburn were brilliant.
I:8578;515;ray and when it arrived, I was surprised because the price had actually gone down!
I:8578;516;Great film and great job of transfer!
I:8578;517;Inspired piece with the presence of these immortal actors as Hepburn .
I:8578;518;"This work is complete in itself 
I:8578;519;for many Huston hard fans this is his greatest artistic achievement.
I:8578;520;Set in 1914 with memorable sequences.
I:8578;521;I am so pleased to see it again and share it with younger friends who never knew how great Hepburn and Bogart were in this movie.
I:8578;522;Then it happened, the picture froze, and I tried all the usual ways to move it along.
I:8578;523;I tried another movie in the player and it was perfect.
I:8578;524;This is a timeless movie and has not lost any of its appeal.
I:8578;525;It's a great story and is entertaining throughout.
I:8578;526;If you love movies you NEED to have this movie in your collection.
I:8578;527;It's a true classic and for good reason.
I:8578;528;It is a treat for the eyes and ears!
I:8578;529;Every scene pops and many look so clear you'd swear it was filmed yesterday instead of 60+ years ago.
I:8578;530;Such a fine mix of actors put together!
I:8578;531;It was funny and kept my interest worrying if the famous two would survive their dilemma!
I:8578;532;Two of the screen's greatest stars are only part of what makes The African Queen a movie to cherish.
I:8578;533;His tiny ramshackle open steamboat is grandly called the African Queen.
I:8578;534;"The crowd in a Canadian movie theater always responds with raucous laughter when Bogart describes himself as a ""Canuck""."
I:8578;535;Regardless, two stars at the peak of their powers, a great story directed by Hollywood master storyteller John Huston, and a high.
I:8578;536;definition restoration of the film all combine to deliver one of the finest viewer experiences from Hollywood's golden era.
I:8578;537;"An excellent extra, ""Embracing Chaos: Making The African Queen"" is included on the Blu."
I:8578;538;"For old folks this is a visit to the glorious past
I:8578;539;The VHS Tape was as advertised and made my wife very happy.
I:8578;540;A little far fetched but a grand adventure nonetheless!
I:8578;541;"The Classic""African Queen"" with Humphrey Bogart and Katherine Hepburn is one of the greatest movies ever made!"
I:8578;542;ray makes it even better.
I:8578;543;We watched it Monday evening ad enjoyed it totally.
I:8578;544;The clarity, vivid color, made it the great movie it still is and will always be.
I:8578;545;I've always known this is a great movie.
I:8578;546;The sound of the jungle is,you are there.
I:8578;547;The color is amazingly alive.
I:8578;548;Anyone who likes Bogart and Hepburn will enjoy this movie.
I:8578;549;The movie is nice and clear not grainy like to older movie.
I:8578;550;This is a classic and would recommend this one.
I:8578;551;This is Bogie and Hepburn at their best.
I:8578;552;Between the two of them, they bring out the best in each other despite all the odds.
I:8578;553;Well worth it to any classic movie fan!
I:8578;554;Katherine Hepburn with either Bogart or Tracy is a recipe for excellent entertainment.
I:8578;555;time favorites and had to ensure that I had it in my movie library.
I:8578;556;Humphrey Bogart and Katherine Hepburn were wonderful in this great movie.
I:8578;557;I love the humor and bantering between the couple all while experiencing hazards.
I:8578;558;I fell in love with this film the first time I ever saw it and it is well worth seeing more than once.
I:8578;559;Also the special feature about the making of the film was outstanding.
I:8578;560;All in all a remarkable film and well done rendition of it and its history.
I:8578;561;The African Queen is one of my all time favorite movies period.
I:8578;562;The great writer James Agee conributed to the scipt (an suffered a heart attack playing tennis with Huston but lived to finish the script) and the meeting and mating of the gin.
I:8578;563;soaked steamboat captain (Bogart) and Christian missonary (Hepburn) clash at first but slowly but wonderfully touching and funny find each other and need each other for survival, love and even high spirits.
I:8578;564;Filmed in Africa with beautiful cinematography.
I:8578;565;The movie itself is a precious, funny, adventure, well.
I:8578;566;acted and directed and a true classic that can entrall the whole family.
I:8578;567;Fun to see the old special effect techniques and the classic movie stars.
I:8578;568;great acting, an inventive story line, and wonderful characters.
I:8578;569;In spite of this, Bogie and Kate give outstanding performances.
I:8578;570;Bogart won an Oscar for best actor in this role.
I:8578;571;Bogie and Kate together telling one of C S Forester's yarns.
I:8578;572;Goodly amount of drama punctuated by some intelligent humor.
I:8578;573;Great acting and characters, filmed in African.
I:8578;574;Good restoration on the film, very colorful.
I:8578;575;This is one of the best of the best.
I:8578;576;My husband absolutely loves Humphrey Bogart.
I:8578;577;She turned 94 and we use to watch that movie every holiday.
I:8578;578;At least I got my Region 1 copy!
I:8578;579;While the rendering could be a bit brighter (maybe it's my TV), it's extremely good for a movie shot for 1951.
I:8578;580;I was excited by there.
I:8578;581;Katherine Hepburn and Bogart should have been a good pairing and the story is ripe with potential.
I:8578;582;The story starts with Rose (KH) and her brother as missionaries in Africa when the Germans come and round up the villagers.
I:8578;583;It's a classic and superb.
I:8578;584;Great story, lots of action and Katherine and Bogey were just wonderful.
I:8578;585;A super couple of hours spent!
I:8578;586;This is a wonderful movie.
I:8578;587;I don't understand why it took so long, but it was worth the wait.
I:8578;588;I ordered this as a gift for my mother after having difficulty finding it at my local shopping centers.
I:8578;589;This movie really is a classic, It combines the talent of Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn together on a riverboat and thier adventure together down a jungle river.
I:8578;590;Many good and bad things happen to them on thier route on the river and we share this with them on thier adventure .
I:8578;591;Which makes this a wonderful film.
I:8578;592;The African Queen was close to being the last movie he made and of course he fianlly got the Academy Award for Best Actor in this movie.
I:8578;593;Get out the pop corn and drinks and let them enjoy it.
I:8578;594;This is an awesome movie.
I:8578;595;Bogart and Hepburn are stellar!
I:8578;596;I would recommend this to any Katherine Hepburn fan out there!
I:8578;597;Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn made a good match.
I:8578;598;The character development was exceptional.
I:8578;599;The interplay between Hepburn and Bogart was enjoyable and interesting.
I:8578;600;His observations of Bogart, Hepburn and John Huston are both humerous and insightful.
I:8578;601;Very good the movie was one of the best movies I have ever seen I like puppy Bogarde and Katherine Hepburn
I:8578;602;All the while, he and Hepburn have developed a romance, culminated by marriage just before they're about to be hanged as British spies.
I:8578;603;Take two unbelievable actors and put them in a fascinating story then just watch them do it.
I:8578;604;This was the perfect movie for her and nobody else could have done it.
I:8578;605;The Amazon service was great as always.
I:8578;606;We especially enjoyed the special features.
I:8578;607;The story is wonderful and a must for any family movie collection.
I:8578;608;This is one of the greatest movies ever.
I:8578;609;Bogart and Hepburn are perfect.
I:8578;610;It holds up exceptionally well over so many years.
I:8578;611;a great movie for an excellent price and it was delivered to my door sooner than I expected and was packaged very nicely so it looked like it came right out of the video store.
I:8578;612;my old VHS finally broke so this was a necessityI'm delighted with the service and the product
I:8578;613;The old technicolor process that was used at the time is wonderfully reproduced with no bleeding colors and minimal grain.
I:8578;614;Although the sound is mono it too is very well done.
I:8578;615;It does have a very good hour long making of feature.
I:8578;616;And the romance is superb!!!!!!
I:8578;617;"None of the sexuality associated with today's ""romances"" and simple humor and sweetness throughout."
I:8578;618;I was very impressed with this film, and this is a highlight from both actors' star.
I:8578;619;This has and will stand the test of time.
I:8578;620;One of my favorite movies!
I:8578;621;The blu ray looks very good I tell you.
I:8578;622;After many years, when almost everything else under the sun has been released, John Huston's version of the C. s. Forester book is here to delight us once again with its wit, its sense of adventure, its grandness.
I:8578;623;"if you are still truly riveted by CITIZEN KANE
I:8578;624;smile at Bogie and Katie sparring with each other.
I:8578;625;Tremble on the edge of your seat as the Queen passes Shona.
I:8578;626;Embrace Huston's clever use of romantic coincidence.
I:8578;627;THE AFRICAN QUEEN remains timeless and unforgettable.
I:8578;628;Spectacular direction by John Huston.
I:8578;629;I enjoyed it as a kid.
I:8578;630;It remains one of the best movies of all time.
I:8578;631;Bogey and Hepburn do a wonderful job of making us believe in an unlikely romance that happens under the worst of circumstances, on an African river in early World War 1.
I:8578;632;Great acting and character progression, i. e., their relationship.
I:8578;633;Good twist in the end.
I:8578;634;This movie deserves to be the classic it is.
I:8578;635;Great performances by both Bogey and Hepburn.
I:8578;636;I saw absolutely nothing wrong with this version of the classic African Queen.
I:8578;637;I loved the African Queen.
I:8578;638;They were actually stars and worth watching.
I:8578;639;One of the best movies ever made.
I:8578;640;Great acting, great filming, great story line.
I:8578;641;Bogart won an Oscar for his acting in this film.
I:8578;642;Superb film all the way around.
I:8578;643;It's one of those films that everyone should (and can) see.
I:8578;644;great classic film remastered old Bogart played his best role !
I:8578;645;'The African Queen' is a truly classic film, with two of the greatest stars ever put on screen.
I:8578;646;Enter your e. mail on the sign.
I:8578;647;up list to finally get this wonderful gem the credit it deserves.
I:8578;648;This movie belongs among Warner Brothers' numerous two.
I:8578;649;It may be an okay film, but it holds no candle to the 1951 treasure.
I:8578;650;bogart), best actress (Hepburn, of course), director John Huston, and screenplay by Huston and James Agee.
I:8578;651;A Place in the Sun, An American in Paris, and A Streetcar Named Desire all earned their spots rightfully, but the Academy overlooking this classic is a true misjudgment.)
I:8578;652;The film ranked 17th on the American Film Institute's list of greatest American films of all time, (and 14th on greatest love stories) with the two stars topping AFI's list of greatest screen legends.
I:8578;653;Both of their performances are excellent, and Huston weaves a terrific journey down a river in hot, humid Africa.
I:8578;654;It combines love and adventure flawlessly.
I:8578;655;if you haven't seen it, I recommend it highly.
I:8578;656;"It has excitement, comedy, a wonderful pair, great direction, a beautiful setting, leaches, and Kate telling Bogie ""Nature, Mr. Allnut, is what we are put in this world to rise above."""
I:8578;657;We all watched it and enjoyed the movie and bonus features.

I:8578;659;I will definitely be watching and rewatching this throughout the years!

I:8578;661;A lot of the African jungle shown in this film is stunningly beautiful).
I:8578;662;the real attraction of this movie is just seeing Hepburn and Bogart paired up together, and they do a great job.
I:8578;663;There is a timelessness to this movie.
I:8578;664;Two misfits who come together to make a whole.
I:8578;665;It deserves to be a classic
I:8578;666;I have played it, it's great.

I:8578;672;Old movie with great actors.
I:8578;673;Highly recommend this movie for anyone who loves that era.
I:8578;674;The movie shows sacrifice and determination in the face of danger and turmoil, and is a wonderful movie, not only for memories for the Baby Boomer generation, but, future generations to come.

I:8578;680;"Disc One is the movie in glorious Technicolor and the bonus is a comprehensive video presentation showing the massive effort required to film ""The African Queen"" along with in."
I:8578;681;I encourage you to spring for the extra bucks and add this superb commemorative release to your growing movie collection.
I:8578;682;Great classic film with two wonderful stars.
I:8578;683;This is an all time classic with great acting, Bogart as an uneducated Canadian steam boat captain and Hepburn as a maiden who is a missionary find themselves together running from then fighting the German Navy during World War One.
I:8578;684;Their marriage near the movie's end is funny and with irony.
I:8578;685;The movie came in perfect condition .
I:8578;686;It gets better every time I watch it.
I:8578;687;There's so much more to the story than one watching can bring out.
I:8578;688;I saw this movie in high school and loved it.
I:8578;689;A good clean movie with two great actors that interact together in a masterfull way.
I:8578;690;This was one of the best movies of all time.
I:8578;691;Movies are subjective, but honestly this one of my favorite old movies.
I:8578;692;It is an engaging story.
I:8578;693;Without a doubt, Bogie's best performance and I have seen all of them.
I:8578;694;Hepburn is superb as prim and proper Rosie .
I:8578;695;one of the best films ever made.
I:8578;696;The movie was two people and they keep ne clued to the screen every time.
I:8578;697;The movie is a classic and you can never tire of it.
I:8578;698;Bogart and Hepburn make wonderful chemistry.
I:8578;699;They were both great actors.
I:8578;700;Excellent plot, excellent acting, enjoyable movie!!
I:8578;701;the studios do right by we fans and issue it properly here in the US.
I:8578;702;In a rare role for Bogart as a weak coward and opportunist he meets more than his match with the strong.
I:8578;703;willed Katherine Hepburn who leads him on a mission during WWII to defeat the Germans' most valuable asset in the African theatre.
I:8578;704;This movie has it all!
I:8578;705;It is a terrific adventure while being funny, suspenseful and romantic.
I:8578;706;It is one of my all time favorites.
I:8578;707;Amazing performances from 2 of the greatest actors that ever lived!
I:8578;708;Huston again directs Bogie in a later career masterpiece of character development and study .
I:8578;709;Actors of the highest calibre who in real.
I:8578;710;long friends as a result of the making of this film .
I:8578;711;This has always been one of my favorite Hepburn movies, so happy to have in my inventory.
I:8578;712;Thank you again Amazon for a job well done!
I:8578;713;Really well done in color format and still laughed at the appropriate places.
I:8578;714;"Bogarts ""Palsm Singing Skinny Old Maid"" line still makes me laugh and brings tears to my eyes."
I:8578;715;The love story of these two characters is wonderful and I highly recommend this classic!
I:8578;716;Katherine Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart are just great in this old movie.
I:8578;717;now, fifty years later, I look at this film with fresh perspective, especially since I had never seen it before.
I:8578;718;Perhaps it was the script, but some of his lines seemed awkward, and it surprised me that he won an academy award as Best Actor that year.
I:8578;719;Her striking features, unique voice and personality added depth to her role.
I:8578;720;Even within its limitations though , I definitely recommend this film.
I:8578;721;It is a classic worth seeing and a part of film history.
I:8578;722;A pair of Methodist ministers, brother and sister, are deep in Africa .
I:8578;723;Rose, from England, feels in a way that life has passed her by.
I:8578;724;She's long past her youth, and she has resigned herself to doing this work until she dies.
I:8578;725;it's interesting to see how Africans were portrayed in 1951.
I:8578;726;something Allnat thinks will scare her, but she loves it.
I:8578;727;She litters the river with all the bottles!In the end, they of course fall in love with each other's spunk, they take on the boat .
I:8578;728;and against all odds, they win.
I:8578;729;But they're together, and that's all that matters.
I:8578;730;It's also touching that this is a love story about people who are mature.
I:8578;731;Even so, they are able to come together and accept each other.
I:8578;732;I love all his movies.
I:8578;733;I would rate this movie a 10 compared to his other movies, although I rate all of them very high.
I:8578;734;This terrific film stars Katherine Hepuburn as a prim missionary's sister, stranded in the wilds of Africa when her brother dies, and the Germans are coming.
I:8578;735;I enjoyed the film with my Mom we just loved it.
I:8578;736;"I bought the African Queen here at Amazon recently as an ""All Region"" film, and we are Region 1."
I:8578;737;"We called the TV store first and they told us that ""All Regions"" would be fine on our TV screen which is a Sony."
I:8578;738;I tried it, and the English subtitles were clear and on target.
I:8578;739;The film was clear and the sound was fine.
I:8578;740;i'm so very glad I bought it!
I:8578;741;The English subtitles were fine.
I:8578;742;which it's quite wide enough.
I:8578;743;But it's out on the porch, and the seating is more comfortable in the den.
I:8578;744;The film was fine for us.
I:8578;745;What really comes through is the sparkling performances of Katharine Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart.
I:8578;746;One of my all time favorite movies.
I:8578;747;Of course the stars are among my favorites too.
I:8578;748;The cinematography was pretty cool for those days.
I:8578;749;just real live African animals.
I:8578;750;I will try to be brief and to the point as the movie itself is probably well known by most.
I:8578;751;The movie was introduced to me by one of my grand moms when I was about 7, so it has a special feeling.
I:8578;752;For those of you whose main Language is not English, this release comes with alternative French and Spanish audios, and with French and Spanish subtitles.
I:8578;753;This movie is was fantastic.
I:8578;754;It had adventure, slight comedy, drama, and romance.
I:8578;755;Boggie and Hepburn were fantastic together.
I:8578;756;would recommend this movie to any movie buff.
I:8578;757;This movie came to me in the best condition.
I:8578;758;i thought the it was the greatest movie I had ever seen,After I meet and married my wife it came out on VHF in the 70ies and I bought it.
I:8578;759;i remember thinking when I took it home and watched it that I still remember the way I felt the first time I watched way back then.
I:8578;760;and I still think this is the greatest movie I have in my collections.
I:8578;761;The great Robert Morley does a fine job with an all too brief role at the beginning of the film, and it would have been nice to see more of him.
I:8578;762;lip, Prussian bearing and hauteur.
I:8578;763;the movie just has great everything: acting, drama, story, action (the running the rapids scene has to be one of the best non.
I:8578;764;special effects action sequences of all time), suspense, and a thrilling and suspense.
I:8578;765;Great Bogart and Hepburn movie.
I:8578;766;A real classic with great acting and a lot of adventure!
I:8578;767;I would highly recommend this movie.
I:8578;768;Super acting, great script, wholesome depiction of two people who most surprisingly fall in love, yet nothing is displayed by the camera to have to hide the kids!
I:8578;769;A fine movie for early dating.
I:8578;770;The plot is believable and the special effects are not outrageous.
I:8578;771;Simply put, a great movie.
I:8578;772;When I first watched this movie many years ago, I thought it was just a war story.
I:8578;773;I really enjoy watching it over and over.
I:8578;774;Have always like Bogart and Hepburn they always seem to be great to bring out the story line.
I:8578;775;The service received from this business was wonderful.
I:8578;776;It was interesting watching a mature couple form a love relationship.
I:8578;777;Will see all of them soon my husband and I enjoy them all.
I:8578;778;Great movies that's his favored mine is moonstruck
I:8578;779;it is one of these movies one can see over and over again.
I:8578;780;It is a real classic with outstanding acting
I:8578;781;probably, now that I have the context, one of the top ten novel.
I:8578;782;They happied up the ending a bit.
I:8578;783;not much, really, if you read the book the ending is kind of open, but this is inarguably happy.
I:8578;784;He's great, really, except the book does make more sense, wherein he is as scrawny as Rose, and dying of disease before the Germans arrive.
I:8578;785;a great touch in the movie is NOT providing subtitles for the Germans.
I:8578;786;rose when the Germans are talking, which is a lovely device that unites us with the protaganist.)
I:8578;787;After Charlie and Rose consumate their relationship.
I:8578;788;the dialog is so funny, and altered cleverly from the book.
I:8578;789;"
I:8578;790;the couple's delight as they each find joy in being with another person is so fresh and beautiful.
I:8578;791;That's great acting, putting life into it beyond that in the book and better than the script itself.
I:8578;792;It was great movie in its time, but it's really showing its age now.
I:8578;793;When you listen to Jack Cardiff's spectacularly good feature.
I:8578;794;"length commentary on the actual filming of ""The African Queen"" in 1951 (he was Director Of Photography), it's a small miracle that this beloved independent gem ever got made at all."
I:8578;795;Jack Cardiff's commentary and a truly superb near 60.
I:8578;796;Their romance was genuine and real and it's treated with great affection here.
I:8578;797;is a feast of detail and beautifully put together storytelling .
I:8578;798;a treat to look at.
I:8578;799;screen info snippets which are good rather than great.
I:8578;800;which brings us to the print itself .
I:8578;801;Digitally restored in 2009, the vast majority of the film is a joy to look at.
I:8578;802;school and filmed as such, so when your player actually throws the print onto a modern.
I:8578;803;I was gobsmacked at how beautiful it looked almost all of the time.
I:8578;804;James Agee's wonderfully loaded dialogue spiked up the tension between the two at first, then the slow burning romance and then the mutual appreciation of each other (Huston loved beautiful losers) right up the hoisting of the Union Jack and the patriotic torpedoing of a German gunboat at the very end.
I:8578;805;Such was the chemistry and force of their brilliant performances .
I:8578;806;A genuinely amazed and humbled Bogart even nabbed the Oscar from the clutches of Marlon Brando and Montgomery Cliff.
I:8578;807;this BLU RAY reissue is a triumph because it works on the two most important levels .
I:8578;808;the print is as lovely as it's ever going to be and the two main extras match that.
I:8578;809;The African Queen is 60 years old next year and this superb 2010 Blu Ray reissue does that enduring classic proud.
I:8578;810;Great classic movie one of my all time favorites the story and the characters from a time gone they don't make them like that anymore.
I:8578;811;Great location scenery, a compelling story, and two fine actors combine to make the African Queen a truly great film.
I:8578;812;The picture is clean and deep, and the sound is good as well.
I:8578;813;This is a good story.
I:8578;814;Hepburn and Bogart were wonderful.
I:8578;815;move across decades (Casablanca comes to mind).
I:8578;816;Still an enjoyable couple of hours.
I:8578;817;Should have walked with the oscar, but career wise she did just fine.
I:8578;818;Humphrey Bogart won and deserved the Oscar for this.
I:8578;819;there is only a brief appearance by some great actors.
I:8578;820;this movie is about Bogart and Hepburn at their best.
I:8578;821;The restoration is beautiful Houston's direction as flawless as the performances.
I:8578;822;I like the classics, this one I remember for both actors to me were great.
I:8578;823;It has a great story about two people.
I:8578;824;"The ""African Queen"" is one of the greatest films ever made."
I:8578;825;This movie is thoroughly enjoyable and exciting.
I:8578;826;I remember first seeing it in the movies as a kid.
I:8578;827;good story line ( I love all of C. s. Foresters stories).
I:8578;828;African Queen is just a great old movie to watch.
I:8578;829;Humphrey Bogart and Katherine Hepburn were two of Hollywood's best actors
I:8578;830;One of the best movies ever.
I:8578;831;Academy Awasrd performances by both leads, one received.
I:8578;832;I have seen it many times and still enjoy it.
I:8578;833;Great tale set at the time of WW I with adventure and suspense in just the right amounts.
I:8578;834;The Making of the movie documentary was as good as the movie.
I:8578;835;This is my favorite movie and have seen it many times.
I:8578;836;Bogie (in his lone Oscar winning role) and Hepburn at their best .
I:8578;837;:) Would definitely recommend to anyone!
I:8578;838;Well, this package is worth it!The restoration is one of the best I've seen.
I:8578;839;fabulous Technicolor, great sound and a smooth, seamless movie.
I:8578;840;The bonus documentary is interesting, and a copy of Hepburn's book, along with the lobby cards and a three.
I:8578;841;strip Technicolor frame card are also nice extras.
I:8578;842;the film may be simple in plot, but certainly makes up for it in the characterization.
I:8578;843;Hepburn is perfect as the missionary Rose Sayer.
I:8578;844;Charlie and Rose change and grow, falling in love, and this is delightful to watch.
I:8578;845;john Huston got the most out of his stars, and his direction is perfect.
I:8578;846;they work well together, and are totally convincing.
I:8578;847;in all, one of the best films of the 1950s, and great performances from its two stars.
I:8578;848;"see film that I am constantly recommending to those who think that Bogie was just a ""tough guy"" actor."
I:8578;849;he was very versatile, and deservedly won the Oscar for this role.
I:8578;850;it really was worth the wait!
I:8578;851;Action adventure with a sweet love story.
I:8578;852;A great adventure with two great stars.
I:8578;853;This is a classic with Humphrey Bogart and Katherine Hepburn in the lead roles with a decrepit steam.
I:8578;854;powered boat as the primary supporting cast.
I:8578;855;I like to watch this at least once or twice a year.
I:8578;856;The movie's history speaks for it's self.
I:8578;857;The features alone are worth the price of this beloved film.
I:8578;858;Watched with the kids last weekend and they actually enjoyed it.
I:8578;859;A few comments about the special effects, but a good story.
I:8578;860;It brought back memories of when I enjoy watching this movie with my mother.
I:8578;861;I recommend this movie to everyone.
I:8578;862;First let me say Bogart is perfect in this movie.
I:8578;863;His blend of stubborness and kindness, compassion and strength define this movie.
I:8578;864;He's the perfect man for the job of portraying someone who is self reliant and hard, yet with a little prodding shows his true character.
I:8578;865;He obviously makes the film what it is.
I:8578;866;Very good plot and action.
I:8578;867;ray at a bargain price.
I:8578;868;it's great to see Humphrey Bogart playing a very unattractive grungy character.
I:8578;869;the subject matter of the film is worth some attention, too.
I:8578;870;visually, the film easy on the eyes.
I:8578;871;I am not a Katherine Hepburn fan, but this is a good role for her.
I:8578;872;This is just one of the best movies ever made.
I:8578;873;The performances are great and so is the story.
I:8578;874;ray release of The African Queen is impressive, and I'm looking forward to seeing it in its remastered form, after previously only being able to watch a faded and discoloured print with tinny sound.
I:8578;875;fronted box in front of the camera lens.
I:8578;876;This is the ultimate for African Queen lovers.
I:8578;877;This set was beautifully boxed, with so many extras.
I:8578;878;It is worth the money.
I:8578;879;I saw this movie years ago and loved it then and love it now!
I:8578;880;Great acting by both actors!
I:8578;881;Good job, great photography, quite entertaining.
I:8578;882;Enjoyed an adventure movie with no bad language and classic movie stars.
I:8578;883;Will share it with other members of our family!!
I:8578;884;The African Queen is a great movie, period.
I:8578;885;ray is nice, too (I said that about Beta).
I:8578;886;It won a clutch of Oscars in 1951.
I:8578;887;i love this great romantic adventure filmclassic, but at this time I will give it just four stars.
I:8578;888;Reason One: See above paragraph.
I:8578;889;"Most images are clean
I:8578;890;release with what I hope is a first.
I:8578;891;ray version as this year's Christmas present to myself.
I:8578;892;I've loved this since I was a kid.
I:8578;893;As a child I loved the jungle adventure aspect of it.
I:8578;894;As I grew older I came to appreciate the performances from Hepburn and Bogart all the more and the carefully paced romance they share.
I:8578;895;It's an amazingly engaging film for movie lovers of any age.
I:8578;896;This is the core of the story.
I:8578;897;It was a notable movie because it was truly filmed in Africa, unusual for those times.
I:8578;898;The charismatic stars, though both getting older, drew audiences.
I:8578;899;It was based on a popular novel by C. S. Forester, a popular adventure writer.
I:8578;900;however, I believe that it was the basic theme that I stated in the first line of this review that gives the movie a feeling of greatness.
I:8578;901;A man and a woman in a tense situation together, even with seemingly opposite personalities, are bound to turn to each other for the moment.
I:8578;902;the actors of course were exactly right to breathe life into this situation.
I:8578;903;And Robert Morley was also effective as Katherine Hepburn's brother missionary.
I:8578;904;The realization that this was filmed on location, not on the studio's back lot, or in Griffith Park, enhanced the film.
I:8578;905;I have watched this movie many times over the years and still marvel at the performance of Bogey and Hepburn.
I:8578;906;hepburn and Bogart at their best!
I:8578;907;This is one of my comfort movies that always takes me away from the modern, crazy world into a world of exotic adventure.
I:8578;908;The two of them (Bogart and Hepburn) are involuntarily thrown together in an unexpected adventure, filled with danger and discomfort.
I:8578;909;If you love old movies, you will LOVE this one!
I:8578;910;this release is a ~WINNER~ all around!Thank you, South Korea, for giving us an import worth much more than it's price!!!
I:8578;911;one of the best film classics of all time.
I:8578;912;Apart from Casablance, this is definetely Bogart's best work.
I:8578;913;And you get to truly appreciate why katherine Hepburn is a master in her craft.
I:8578;914;It is a beautiful movie whose center lies in the chemistry of both actors.
I:8578;915;This is a must have if your a serious movie collector or just want a very entertaining flick.
I:8578;916;It was a wonderful old movie
I:8578;917;Without a doubt in the world, thisn is Bogart's finest film and one of my all.
I:8578;918;time top tens in movies, for a number of reasons.
I:8578;919;meaning and slightly michevous Canuck living alone, as a bachelor, in the Central African region during the outbreak of WWI.
I:8578;920;Both are shocked and embarassed, and, sensing they have done wrong, each of them recoil into their own space to ponder this bold act.
I:8578;921;Their reactions are cute and whimsicval, as both actors display what I felt it musdt of been like to fall in love for the first time, something every human should experience at least once in a lifetime.
I:8578;922;Well, from now on, these two are hooked on each other, and Hepburn's character, now entranced with Mr. Alnutt, looks at him with the heart of a woman in the rapture of her greatest love of her life.
I:8578;923;charlie builds the weapon and the two clean up and spruce up the old tub, and even make a replica of the British Union Jack flag, seeing hiw she represents the Royal Navy.
I:8578;924;Filled with patriotic idealism and bravery, but mostly with love for each other, they while away the few hours left before the confrontation on the lake in romantic dream world, yet set in reality.
I:8578;925;All they see is each other, as it should be, and these scenes are amongst the best ever in romance clips in Hollywood history.
I:8578;926;Is the geneous of diredctor John Huston, who gives us the real Charlie Alnutt, Bogie's all time best role, and who ewlse but Huston could pull this off?
I:8578;927;Still, it's the old Kate wqe see in the afernoon tea sxcene with Charlie, that reminds us of her carreer character type, so why is she such a great actress?
I:8578;928;The director is the conductor of a film production, and the finished product is more his than enyone elses.
I:8578;929;peter Lorrie, one of my favorite supporting actors.
I:8578;930;The photography in the AFrican Queen is good and filled with action, when needed, but the real gem here is the convincing roles of hepburn and Bogart, the sript and the story.
I:8578;931;A film classic the entire adult audience will enjoy and find enchanting, intelligent and 100% entertaining.
I:8578;932;This is one of the old time Must See movies.
I:8578;933;It has a good story, well directed, with good scenery, excitement, and with a surprise ending .
I:8578;934;The item was well packaged, it arrived in perfect condition, and the shipping was fast.
I:8578;935;This one will take you back to when movies didn't have to have sex or cursing to be entertaining.
I:8578;936;This video has a great picture and sound.
I:8578;937;I am thrilled to have it and if you love this movie as much as I do you will be happy, also.
I:8578;938;This is just a simple, and brilliant, mix of adventure, character, and humor.
I:8578;939;"Even with all of the superb jungle backgrounds, (another Jack Cardiff triumph) the real beauty of the film lies in its gentle portrait of it's disparate leading characters
I:8578;940;"Don't let this description fool you
I:8578;941;"Bogart and Hepburn at their most winning
I:8578;942;It also jumps right into the action, with no stops or wrong turns along the way (no pun intended.you'll find out).
I:8578;943;A poem of a film!
I:8578;944;Kathryn Hepburn was wonderful as Rose.
I:8578;945;This is a great classic movie.
I:8578;946;I enjoyed it, but it did not grab my 21 year old daughter's interest.
I:8578;947;Wonderful action and first time Hepburn and Bogie made a film together.
I:8578;948;Great story, great acting, great photography.
I:8578;949;In its day, a surprise hit.
I:8578;950;Even if the acting styles seem dated, Bogart and Hepburn are terrific.
I:8578;951;One of the first films shot on arduous foreign locations, it's about two losers who, thrown together in extreme circumstances, accomplish great things by combining her determination and belief, his jack.
I:8578;952;dynamite cast, dynamite Director, dynamie photography.
I:8578;953;Great find on here, and a value to anyone's collection regardless of age.
I:8578;954;The movie is just as good as I remember, after seeing it years ago.
I:8578;955;this is one of the all time classic films and one that is a MUST HAVE.
I:8578;956;What a work of art!
I:8578;957;This is one of the best movies of all time.
I:8578;958;up old boat, The African Queen, the fun begins.
I:8578;959;until she realizes that he is an intelligent person who may be able to save their lives by his cool wit.
I:8578;960;He good naturedly sloughs off her constant criticism, while she endures his slovenly ways and colorful language.
I:8578;961;At some point they start developing a strong like for each other.
I:8578;962;When Bogie finally shaves, well you know romantic sparks are about to fly.
I:8578;963;This is one of the great old time classics.
I:8578;964;The African Queen is such a great movie.
I:8578;965;The lead characters just seemed to be so real.
I:8578;966;I first saw this movie years ago, and always remembered it as outstanding.
I:8578;967;The interaction between Bogart and Hepburn is a pleasure to watch.
I:8578;968;I recommend it to everyone.
I:8578;969;Bogart and Hepburn in one of the best movies ever made.
I:8578;970;Now on blu ray the picture and sound are fantastic to say the least.
I:8578;971;I have a 106 inch movie screen and a very nice high def wide screen projector, 7.1 surround sound.
I:8578;972;There is no better way to see this film.
I:8578;973;This is a friends' favorite movie and kept asking me about it so I ordered it to add to my collection.
I:8578;974;I was surprised it had to be imported from China and was happy to see it was in English (wasn't sure for a minute).
I:8578;975;A wonderful movie any one would enjoy.
I:8578;976;The African Queen is simply one of the best movies ever made.
I:8578;977;It has adventure, romance, comedy, and some great scenery of the African countryside.
I:8578;978;Bogart and Hepburn display great chemistry.
I:8578;979;Huston directs with his usual skill.
I:8578;980;This movie has something for everyone in the family.
I:8578;981;They are great together and this is a classic
I:8578;982;Maybe the best movie ever made.
I:8578;983;Romance, comedy, and action .
I:8578;984;at the beginning, when it was over they had really enjoyed the movie.
I:8578;985;I do hope it still comes .
I:8578;986;It is always wonderful to watch this exciting classic movie.
I:8578;987;charlie: What's that?Rose: The Louisa.
I:8578;988;She is determined to have her way and sees Charlie as a way to help save her country.
I:8578;989;"as Rose would say: ""Nature, Mr. Allnut, is what we are put in this world to rise above."""
I:8578;990;eventually Rose has to let go of her civilized English ways and starts to rely on her wild natural instincts.
I:8578;991;Fighting a river becomes the most exciting experience of her entire life and she enjoys this new feeling of being completely unconstrained in her passion for this new adventure.
I:8578;992;Fighting the river causes respect to be born and this grows into love.
I:8578;993;The calm times when you can relax and enjoy the scenery and the stressful times when you are holding hoping for better times.
I:8578;994;Just like this trip down an African river, marriage takes courage and staying there may in fact test the bedrock of your character.
I:8578;995;adventure, romance, comedy and an unexpected conclusion.
I:8578;996;This is one of the greatest motion pictures, ever made!!!!
I:8578;997;It was worth the wait.
I:8578;998;i highly recommend, that you pick up a Blu.
I:8578;999;Bogie as usual is great.
I:8578;1000;What is with that?Thankfully, Korea has released this version.
I:8578;1001;who knows how many more years it will take these numbskulls to release this wonderful film in America.
I:8578;1002;But in the meantime, I have this wonderful film now to enjoy and to show my grandchildren who have never seen it.
I:8578;1003;"It's actually a great love story, but not ""billed"" that way."
I:8578;1004;"The only problem is that it is not produced in the United States, but the Asian version is fine and you can eliminate the ""sub."
I:8578;1005;The African Queen is absolutely One of, if not The Best movies ever made!
I:8578;1006;The small ensemble cast is wonderful!
I:8578;1007;And of course the acting is superb!
I:8578;1008;if you are a classic movie fan.
I:8578;1009;The African Queen has always been one of my favorite movies (didn't see it when it was first released because I was only seven years old).
I:8578;1010;a grownup movie that's actually FUN!
I:8578;1011;aged sexy is all about.
I:8578;1012;"And the gorgeous technicolor, which is crisp and thrilling on this disc (and don't reach for the ""Zoom"" button on your remote."
I:8578;1013;The accompanying documentary, making use of home movies and photos, is excellent and informative.
I:8578;1014;I'd like to just confirm what others have written, this is just one of the greatest films of all time.
I:8578;1015;oh and Hepburn wins on the female side.
I:8578;1016;and that is great to report.
I:8578;1017;the Blu Ray looks terrific and the making of is nice.
I:8578;1018;Bogie and Kate a perfect match in any movie .
I:8578;1019;On location scenery, a great story line and brilliant acting make this film a timeless classic for true movie buffs.
I:8578;1020;And the extras helped me understand the trouble that John Huston went to while making this film.
I:8578;1021;Eccentricities of actors and actresses aside, the production and attention to detail was spectacular.
I:8578;1022;This is a true classic film.
I:8578;1023;Strong performances from all the actors with a worthy storyline.
I:8578;1024;At times you felt you were almost there with them.
I:8578;1025;Excellent character development and good effects, especially from a time when special effects was almost unheard of and there was definitely no CGI!
I:8578;1026;possibly the best transfer of a classic movie to Blu.
I:8578;1027;Original film grain structure intact [thankfully] wonderful warmth and detail!Audio .
I:8578;1028;Hepburn, perfect as the woman you'd like throw over board!
I:8578;1029;There always seemed to be scratches and dots in the viewed print.
I:8578;1030;What a treat to watch this classic film as if it were a 1st run premier.
I:8578;1031;Bogie and Hepburn were simply perfect in these roles, and Huston's direction was positively inspired.
I:8578;1032;Watch this one again, and be wowed as never before.
I:8578;1033;"ray restoration of the classic 1951 film, ""The African Queen"" is so breathtaking, especially given the age of the film and the fact that a decent print of it had not been seen in decades, that it looks as if it was made yesterday."
I:8578;1034;The accompanying documentary on the making of the film is just as entertaining as the film itself.
I:8578;1035;A classic all time great movie presented in an excellent format.
I:8578;1036;this movie will grab and hold thinking young people's attention.
I:8578;1037;in fact I have never seen it looking this good in all the years I have viewed it.
I:8578;1038;the experience has had the opposite effect and she is exhilarated and is more determined than ever to carry through.
I:8578;1039;after an awkward few moments they passionately embrace and both realize that love has somehow touched them both.
I:8578;1040;close but no cigars were Hepburn for best actress,James Agee and John Huston for the screenplay and Huston again for director.
I:8578;1041;the story is fairly simple but well written and is greatly enhanced by its' principals Bogie and Hepburn as both are in top form here.
I:8578;1042;technically the film has been beautifully restored and remastered in a hi.
I:8578;1043;"def print which is simply gorgeous
I:8578;1044;"if you have been waiting for the best print of The African Queen you can possibly get,then wait no more my friends
I:8578;1045;It is, and deserves to be, considered an American classic.
I:8578;1046;This is a classic but the color was exalent, it looks as fresh to day as it did when it was made
I:8578;1047;It is a quintessentially classic film, the script, the actors, the direction are all perfect.
I:8578;1048;It is a masterpiece of golden age cinema, period.
I:8578;1049;Simply put, this is a very well crafted movie with sprinkles of brilliant dialogue, storytelling and acting throughout.
I:8578;1050;if, like me, you haven't watched this movie in a while, you will find this release a thoroughly enjoyable re.
I:8578;1051;It may well even jolt some older memories of when you had first watched it .
I:8578;1052;For me, it was well worth it.
I:8578;1053;I also found the bonus short about the making of the film well worth watching.
I:8578;1054;This is one of those films that is a novel that does not have to be realistic, but is such a good story (for those of a certain age, I suppose) to be absolutely irresistible.
I:8578;1055;I saw this 35 years ago and it was as fresh and exhilarating on this viewing as it was in my youth.
I:8578;1056;But enthralled I was, as they tolerated my enthusiasm.
I:8578;1057;this is a lovely story about a spinster, thrown into the chaos of life when her brother breaks down because of the vicissitudes of war.
I:8578;1058;She has lived in an ethereal world of religion, probably as a virgin in her late 40s, and experienced little in life though has observed much as a colonial missionary.
I:8578;1059;The two of them discover an extraordinary synergy, to renew their lives and move into new territory.
I:8578;1060;They bring out the best in each other and, of course, fall for each other.
I:8578;1061;It is absolutely preposterous, and their relationship might be doomed, but I loved and believed every single second of this film.
I:8578;1062;this is an absolutely perfect film, a middle.
I:8578;1063;Great authentic movie, loved the plot, script and acting.
I:8578;1064;Brings back memories of the real movie making days in a nautical setting
I:8578;1065;Brilliant acting, directing, and story . . . when there wasn't any need for special effects, sex, or violence to draw crowds into a theater.
I:8578;1066;Most polls that have been done in recent years typically denote Humphrey Bogart as the greatest movie star of all time, and frequently Katherine Hepburn gets the number two slot (and always gets the number one slot for women).
I:8578;1067;It was a spectacular undertaking (which Katherine Hepburn recorded in a book she wrote about making THE AFRICAN QUEEN).
I:8578;1068;What is crucial is the remarkable dynamics between Bogart and Hepburn, as they go from loathing one another, to liking, and then to loving.
I:8578;1069;It has to be the most unlikely love story in the history of film, and yet somehow these two great actors not only manage to sell it, but make it quietly majestic.
I:8578;1070;But surely Katherine Hepburn is the perfect Rose Sayer.
I:8578;1071;Like in THE PHILADELPHIA STORY, she can communicate self.
I:8578;1072;Of course, she is superb as Rose Sayer and her performance may well be her most fulfilled as she (Rose) evolves from a priggish spinster who initially views Charlie Alnutt (Bogart) as something to be scraped from his boat but over time develops grudging respect, admiration, and then even love for him.
I:8578;1073;"deserved stature as a ""classic."
I:8578;1074;Throughout much of the film, she faithfully follows that suggestion.
I:8578;1075;In one of the film's most glorious moments, she falls totally in love with the scruffy and sometimes irascible but undeniably courageous Charlie.
I:8578;1076;All of her inhibitions and defense mechanisms are overcome by this kind and brave little man with whom she soon faces almost certain death.
I:8578;1077;it is worth noting that Huston enlisted James Agee to help him with the screenplay, based on C. s. Forester's novel.
I:8578;1078;It is also worth noting that Robert Morley has a small but pivotal role as Rose's brother, the Reverend Samuel Thayer.
I:8578;1079;Also, I think, Huston wished to introduce elements of menace and danger as early in the film as appropriate.
I:8578;1080;The African Queen was Bogart's fourth film to be directed by John Huston and his performance in it was very likely the best in his career as well as one which finally won him an Academy Award.
I:8578;1081;The screenplay by Huston and the celebrated movie critic.
I:8578;1082;star tour de force in a deeply touching romance linked to adventures and heroics.
I:8578;1083;bogart and Hepburn were delightful as they infused their personal conflict with a warmth, humor, and tenderness rarely seen in films.
I:8578;1084;Mixing comedy and adventure, it was a two.
I:8578;1085;The sensitive interaction between her and Bogart (in an unfamiliar guise) undoubtedly benefited from her many films with Tracy.
I:8578;1086;infested, suffocatingly hot and humid African Congo.
I:8578;1087;But the result was a brilliantly entertaining film, a successful mixture of comedy, character and adventure.
I:8578;1088;"This BD version of ""The African Queen"" is quite astonishing."
I:8578;1089;The picture is near perfect, and a great ad for BD.
I:8578;1090;The film itself holds up very well, with wonderful performances from the stars.
I:8578;1091;The acting in this movie is outstanding, the photography is spectacular, and the story is second to none.
I:8578;1092;The growing affection between Charlie and Rose is the underlying plot.
I:8578;1093;Kate was at the top of her game with this one, Bogey got to play one of his favorite characters, and we all get to enjoy the results.
I:8578;1094;time great performers in this movie.
I:8578;1095;Both Bogey and Hep are great.
I:8578;1096;This is a great movie because of the acting, the setting, and the plot.
I:8578;1097;bogart is at his best here, and so Hepburn.
I:8578;1098;They both play classic characters, but they are also opposites, which keeps the dialogue lively and entertaining.
I:8578;1099;This is the role for which Bogart won an Oscar for best actor.
I:8578;1100;Release these two greats into the wilds of Africa, and you have the makings of a timeless movie.
I:8578;1101;The scenery is spectacular with first.
I:8578;1102;The contrast of the rusty old boat with the lush wilderness and the fresh river makes for a great background for this adventure.
I:8578;1103;I believe that I have read almost everything written by C. s. Forrester and certainly The African Queen lists up there as one of my favorites.
I:8578;1104;I loved the book, and I loved the movie.
I:8578;1105;Bogie is perfect as the captain of the Queen.
I:8578;1106;The cast play their parts well and, apart from the wooden Germans at the end, the whole movie is a joy to watch.
I:8578;1107;My husband and I saw this movie before, but enjoyed it so much we wanted to get our own copy to view on our own schedule.
I:8578;1108;this movie has action, historical content, romance, comedy and is just marvelous to watch.
I:8578;1109;'The African Queen' is an acknowledged classic of the first order.
I:8578;1110;managed to produce a movie that grips the mind and keeps one on the edge of one's seat for the duration of the film, only 'boggles the mind'.
I:8578;1111;this film deserves every award it received along with the actors.
I:8578;1112;It is, simply, a marvellous movie!
I:8578;1113;To believably play the good.
I:8578;1114;matured, uncomplicated riverboat driver in this film is a testimony to one of the best actors their ever was.
I:8578;1115;And the chemistry with Hepburn was just perfect.
I:8578;1116;It looks great and plays well on my European TV.
I:8578;1117;All of your favorite scenes are there in good color.
I:8578;1118;"One of the greatest motion pictures of all time ""The African Queen"" finally gets released on a modern format."
I:8578;1119;Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn star in the romantic adventure film from legendary director John Huston.
I:8578;1120;i absolutely love this movie and have waited years to see it again.
I:8578;1121;ray and the article mentioned how good the restoration was.
I:8578;1122;ray is an absolute must.
I:8578;1123;And to fully appreciate the movie, see it on the biggest screen you can get.
I:8578;1124;I think this is best movie bogart and Hepburn have done.
I:8578;1125;humphrey Bogart won his only Oscar for this film, although I believe he had better roles and did better work.
I:8578;1126;Katharine Hepburn does a great job as the crazy, psalm.
I:8578;1127;I enjoyed this classic and recommend it highly.
I:8578;1128;This is one of my favorite movies.
I:8578;1129;Through Amazon Prime Video service I am able to watch this great movie as many times as I choose.
I:8578;1130;It was adequate for my purpose to review for a discussion group.
I:8578;1131;This movie is a real treat, not only does it have Katherine H. and Humphrey B. but the photography is also great and the colors are so vivid that you almost feel like you're there.
I:8578;1132;But one of the things I really enjoyed was the expressions that crossed their faces at times, making them seem so human and ordinary.
I:8578;1133;This was an arranged marriage of sorts and the innocence and purity that they brought to these roles was just heart warming.
I:8578;1134;I guess I relate to that as well, you know that saying behind a good man stands a good woman and it really shows how women in particular can take a diamond in the rough and make something out off him.
I:8578;1135;It's a great story about 2 ordinary people who get together and with respect and love can become extraordinary.
I:8578;1136;An interesting story in a time when people are very self sufficient and don't want to take on a problem.
I:8578;1137;Good jobs, great potential and no baggage are definite requirements these days in relationships.
I:8578;1138;Good old fashioned stuff for the soul and also very entertaining at the same time.
I:8578;1139;He has produced a new remastered version of this CLASSIC .
I:8578;1140;the last holdout on the American Film Institute's List of the 100 Best Movies of All Time.
I:8578;1141;It may be a bumpy ride, but is sure to be an excellent experience, one which film afficianados have been awaiting for a very long time.
I:8578;1142;A very good vevicle for Both major actor and actess and almosttrue to the book except for leaving out the activities of the Royal Navy on the Lake narated in the book.
I:8578;1143;You feel like you're right there on the Queen with Bogie and Katherine!
I:8578;1144;This movie is a classic example of two people so talented that they can virtually carry the entire movie by themselves!
I:8578;1145;"guzzling ""jack of all trades"" can keep the story rolling with laughter and suspense."
I:8578;1146;The color and detail with the Blu.
I:8578;1147;I recommend this movie for the whole family!
I:8578;1148;Looks great on Blu Ray.

I:8578;1150;Best part is that I ordered kind of late but it came in time for Christmas.
I:8578;1151;My favorite movie of all time so I had to have the tape so I can watch it over and over.
I:8578;1152;I have, in the last several years, opened up my husband's mind to the old classics.
I:8578;1153;He is now a fast fan of Bogart.
I:8578;1154;This Christmas he got several Bogart films and is happy as a clam that he got them.
I:8578;1155;Love the movie, it's a classic.
I:8578;1156;The chemistry between Bogart and Hepburn is light hearted and entertaining.

I:8578;1158;Stellar Cast and such a fine story.
I:8578;1159;Received promptly and was here in time for a gift.
I:8578;1160;Thank you so much for your attention of fast delivery.
I:8578;1161;I loved this movie from the 1st time I saw it years ago.
I:8578;1162;After all, every guy I know loved it .
I:8578;1163;the story is a little cheesy, but fun.
I:8578;1164;What they find is that while they drive each other absolutely nuts, they are in love.
I:8578;1165;while the movie is definately a previous generation's mindset, it is still fun to watch today.
I:8578;1166;K. h. and Bogie are totally natural together have fun with their roles.
I:8578;1167;It's still a wonderful little film superbly acted by Bogart and Hepburn.
I:8578;1168;"The audio and video on the movie are great
I:8578;1169;I would recommend this set to anyone interested in this movie and more details about the making of it.
I:8578;1170;It really brings the Queen back to life.
I:8578;1171;If you love The African Queen, and you have Blu.
I:8578;1172;ray capability, This recording is a good bet.
I:8578;1173;Katherine Hepburn was tough classy old girl and Bogart's character let her be all of that!
I:8578;1174;And near the end he was smart and treated her like a lady
I:8578;1175;Good plot, great characters, good ending.
I:8578;1176;The old films with a concentration on characters are much better than today's technological productions.
I:8578;1177;This is a classic film that everyone should see.
I:8578;1178;and it is a great family film too!
I:8578;1179;As an ardent fan of the African Queen, I beseech the movie studios to get going on a special edition with all of the extras, and pronto!
I:8578;1180;This masterpiece of filmmaking gives us two of the best actors of all time, in a sweeping, gorgeously filmed story.
I:8578;1181;With a satisfying ending and sweat you can almost taste, this is a stunner from the old Hollywood system.
I:8578;1182;A perfect romance/action/adventure film, one of the rare greats.
I:8578;1183;It's nice to watch such a great pair of actors clearly.
I:8578;1184;if you haven't seen in a long time it's always worth watching.
I:8578;1185;One of the best casting's for a pair of actors ever.
I:8578;1186;I have always loved this movie.
I:8578;1187;Just about everyone knows that this is one of the great movies.
I:8578;1188;Great actors, great director, now even better with the picture and sound of Blu.
I:8578;1189;Plus you'll get a great price on it at Amazon.
I:8578;1190;I have watched this movie several times over several decades and with the restoration of the film, so much more is experienced.
I:8578;1191;It was just wonderful to watch and listen to two of my most favorite actors (actress) of all time.
I:8578;1192;I had this fabulous film on a VHS tape .
I:8578;1193;this is a timeless classic, and I love everything about it.
I:8578;1194;and watch the African Queen, along with other classics.
I:8578;1195;thank you for this excellent entertainment!
I:8578;1196;One of the greatest movies of all time.
I:8578;1197;It's one of those my dad loved so I first saw it as a kid.
I:8578;1198;This is my favorite Bogie film.
I:8578;1199;I went somewhere else and got the movie and may rethink ordering from you again.
I:8578;1200;This is my all time favorite movie !
I:8578;1201;A wonderful entertaing love story.
I:8578;1202;This movie is a total classic, and I saw it in the 1950's and now I have it for my own.
I:8578;1203;But along the way, they encounter storms, rapids, mosquitos and.
I:8578;1204;hepburn and Bogie are at their best in this film.
I:8578;1205;"Hard to imagine how a woman falls in love on a rickety boat with a man who refers to her as "" old girl"", nonetheless she does, and it's a good story."
I:8578;1206;I just recently had the opportunity to watch 'African Queen' and found it quite interesting.
I:8578;1207;I managed to keep myself busy while watching by drinking coffee.
I:8578;1208;Same good story as ever now in color.
I:8578;1209;a very small cast is all it took to make a timeless classic.
I:8578;1210;What a combination in this entertaining story of World War II intrigue mixed with romance and adventure.
I:8578;1211;It is a classic with one of the best casts and director Hollywood has ever produced.
I:8578;1212;He and Katharine Hepburn interact beautifully, perhaps even better than Bogie and Bacall.
I:8578;1213;The sharpness, contrast, and color saturation are amazing.
I:8578;1214;Was happy w/ the price and timely fashion this was shipped.
I:8578;1215;But this is one of his all time favorites and I'm sure he will enjoy it.
I:8578;1216;ray version is a great improvement over the old version.
I:8578;1217;Picture is much clearer and sound seems cleaner as well.
I:8578;1218;Fast shipping as always from Amazon!
I:8578;1219;com and find it right away and a lot cheaper too.
I:8578;1220;It came in perfect condition, I loved it, and will definitely use Amazon.
I:8578;1221;Just one of the greatest classic's of all time.
I:8578;1222;Received VCR in good condition and in timely fashion.
I:8578;1223;This is that classic movie but it is the colorized version.
I:8578;1224;The original in black and white is better.
I:8578;1225;It's one thing to experience recent blockbusters on Blu Ray, but it's even more impressive to experience an old classic like this in an entirely new light.
I:8578;1226;Is it really possible to make a 60 year old movie look brand new?
I:8578;1227;This has got to top my list of best Blu Ray transfers ever.
I:8578;1228;The color sparkles and dazzles with such depth and clarity that Michael Bay couldn't have done it better.
I:8578;1229;ray] on Blu Ray I saw hope for old movies to become better than ever, but I never imagined I'd see a color film look this good.
I:8578;1230;okay so to the point .
I:8578;1231;James Agee writes a brilliant screenplay that takes two dynamic characters that you love more and more after they go through each adventure.
I:8578;1232;The transfer is STUNNING and looks positively brand new.
I:8578;1233;If this movie holds any place in your heart, it is absolutely well worth getting this Blu Ray.
I:8578;1234;It actually blows my mind how they can make a movie that looked so OLD look so perfect.
I:8578;1235;But perfect is the only word to describe it.
I:8578;1236;i liked it even better this time, it makes you want to go out and haveyour own adventure.
I:8578;1237;For the good of others.
I:8578;1238;Excellent story, great scenery with wonderful actors.
I:8578;1239;This is a great movie, but I've never found it showing on TV.
I:8578;1240;I really wanted my wife to see it, because I knew she would love it.
I:8578;1241;Well, she finally was able to see it.
I:8578;1242;Now, she can watch it as often as she likes (and she watches the good ones over and over again.
I:8578;1243;the scenery and the wild animals are amazing to behold.
I:8578;1244;I love when Rose calls Charlie a coward .
I:8578;1245;this is why the movie is considered so good!
I:8578;1246;clear crisp image seen in the other two titles.
I:8578;1247;ray looking as majestic as possible.
I:8578;1248;Paramount has done a marvelous restoration on the film restoring much of the luster lost with the passage of time.
I:8578;1249;The African Queen came along at just the right time in both Bogie and Hepburn's careers as the Black List threatened to swallow them up like it did many other major stars of the time.
I:8578;1250;Huston's direction and the script he wrote in collaboration with James Agee are both marvelous and filled with wry humor and observations about our characters.
I:8578;1251;colors look quite nice and detail is remarkably sharp considering how badly the original elements of the film have aged and degraded with the passage of time.
I:8578;1252;"Kudos to Paramount for making sure that ""The African Queen"" was released in a restored version rather than just pulling the best looking print available for home video."
I:8578;1253;"the documentary ""Embracing Chaos"" Produced by Nicholas Meyer and directed by Eric Young gives us an intimate behind."
I:8578;1254;"Making good use of interviews with assistant director Guy Hamilton, Lauren Bacall, actor Theodore Bikel, archival interviews with director of photography Jack Cardiff, Bogart, Hepburn, Huston and intercutting rare home movie footage, ""Embracing Chaos"" gives fans and first time viewers a strong impression of the challenges of the location shooting of the film."
I:8578;1255;It's a well made documentary that does justice to its subject.
I:8578;1256;It is my favorite movie of all time.
I:8578;1257;The acting is great, classical.
I:8578;1258;Humphrey and Catherine are at their best and deliver a moving performance.
I:8578;1259;If you've never seen this classic, do yourself a favor and settle back for a truly wonderful work.
I:8578;1260;Pros: Bogart, Hepburn, cinematography, writing.
I:8578;1261;"humphrey Bogart won his first and only Oscar as Charlie Allnut in John Huston's classic adventure ""The African Queen""."
I:8578;1262;Perhaps it could be he poked fun at his usual tough guy image by playing a drunken captain.
I:8578;1263;Nevertheless, he is excellent in the role, being charismatic, romantic, charming and funny.
I:8578;1264;She is often, during the first half, dressed like a lady, talks and acts like one (Some might also point out her tea drinking).
I:8578;1265;She knows that in order to survive, she needs to be strong willed.
I:8578;1266;"It also helps that she discovers she loves sailing the rapids (""I never dreamed that any mere physical experience could be so stimulating."")"
I:8578;1267;Anyway, Bogie and Hepburn cross the lake and spot the Louisa.
I:8578;1268;The man, however, seems happy.
I:8578;1269;Still, I wonder if Charlie and Rosie survived.
I:8578;1270;the photography looks real nice, with a lot of it being shot on location in Africa.
I:8578;1271;The writing is filled with danger and witty dialogue, and the direction is quick to the chase and focused on development of the two leads, who for most of the film are the only ones on screen.
I:8578;1272;"Bogart and Huston made one more together, ""Beat the Devil""."
I:8578;1273;Anyone of these movies would look good on your video shelf.
I:8578;1274;Although I am a fan of C. S. Forester, Hollywood actually improved on this story.
I:8578;1275;A much cleaner and effective ending.
I:8578;1276;The acting is superb and the location is perfect.
I:8578;1277;This is obviously a truly outstanding movie.
I:8578;1278;This is a very good presentation of the movie.
I:8578;1279;So until there is an American version of this old classic, do yourself a favor and get it today.
I:8578;1280;I remembered seeing it in the theater.
I:8578;1281;I think this is perhaps the best movie Bogart ever made.
I:8578;1282;This particular video release is the best I've seen.
I:8578;1283;The picture is brighter and clearer, the sound better.
I:8578;1284;The film actually presents a surprisingly good story.
I:8578;1285;There's a man and a woman working together without any obvious female chauvinism attempting to emasculate the man or put him in the shade.
I:8578;1286;however the original book presented the romance between the returning missionary and the habitual drunk, it's an innocent love story in the movie.
I:8578;1287;defines classic and brilliant film making.
I:8578;1288;Beautifully restored video and sound on the disc.
I:8578;1289;strip elements, is a huge improvement.
I:8578;1290;I also realized on this viewing that maybe Charlie and Rose, uh .
I:8578;1291;But if they did, it's suggested very subtly.
I:8578;1292;I selected it to show to a groupof seniors citizens that I share movies with on Friday nights.
I:8578;1293;I selectedbecause it is a decent and good film, and that kind is hard to find.
I:8578;1294;Good classic, no problem with sud titles, but movie was defective, the picture keep breaking up.
I:8578;1295;One of the very best movies ever.
I:8578;1296;Great story with an amazing ending.
I:8578;1297;The characters are engaging and the action suspense is continuous.
I:8578;1298;The juxtaposition of western religion and raw African nature and nativesis rich beyond words.
