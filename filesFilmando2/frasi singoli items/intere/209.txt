I:9494;1;nobody important showed up on audition day.
I:9494;2;this is not a lifetime movie and can be enjoyed by the guys.
I:9494;3;the real deal is this movie is good.
I:9494;4;so,my point is this movie follows that formula and is therefore good.
I:9494;5;Great move about culture and life, and what you can do to jack that up for yourself and all
I:9494;6;A great movie, best described as a poignant black comedy with a not so happy ending, one which parallels the lives of many users.
I:9494;7;These are likable characters, still young and somewhat carefree as long as their access to drugs keeps flowing.
I:9494;8;there is enough retro appeal in the movie to serve as a partial period piece.
I:9494;9;As Bob eventually tries to dry up he finds its much harder to escape his past then he thought it would be, and his associates easily choose their own addiction over love or friendship and he finds himself alone.
I:9494;10;charismatic and smart enough to run his own crew and stay (for the most part) one step ahead of the law, one is left to wonder how successful Bob could have been if he had followed his mother's advice and not loved his drugs more than her.
I:9494;11;Holds up very well after all these years, fans of BarflyBarflywill also enjoy.
I:9494;12;Great tale of the prescription drug abuse that goes on nowadays and particularly at the time in Portland.
I:9494;13;Was a great movie and Matt Dillon was fantastic!
I:9494;14;Worth watching again fun and touching !
I:9494;15;In Drugstore Cowboy, all the actors fit their roles perfectly.
I:9494;16;Matt Dillon is ideal for the role of Bob, the main character.
I:9494;17;man charm and a willingness to accept the consequences of his actions.
I:9494;18;At the very least, he knows what he is.
I:9494;19;His speech to the social worker contains a kind of weary cynicism.
I:9494;20;the other characters are less important to the film, but they are also played very well.
I:9494;21;For this role, he found some guy who looks exactly like David Roper at thirty.
I:9494;22;He goes after Bob because it's his job and his conviction to do so.
I:9494;23;He just views Bob as a punk who poses a threat to society and should be eliminated by any means.
I:9494;24;But when he realizes that Bob has actually given up drugs, he becomes sympathetic and genuinely tries to help.
I:9494;25;and the famous Beat writer William Burroughs is the most perfectly cast of all.
I:9494;26;more educated, more refined, more honest .
I:9494;27;The film is carried by the actors.
I:9494;28;But Drugstore Cowboy is a good film.
I:9494;29;I thought Matt Dillon was great in this film and it was well produced and the parts with Burroughs were classic.
I:9494;30;The story of Bob and his drugstore raids through various cities is a very real story.
I:9494;31;He goes and gets a job, he goes to the methadone program, he completely gives up on his relationship with Diane.
I:9494;32;"There has never been one like it before
I:9494;33;The visionary camera work along with the narration of the film are nicely blended together to give Drugstore Cowboy a surreal look.
I:9494;34;The simplicity is in the acting of Matt Dillon: how unconvincing he is as an actor, but he finds a way to be appealing as a character.
I:9494;35;He is just captivating to watch.
I:9494;36;Drugstore Cowboy is a provocative story with wonderful surprises.
I:9494;37;There is a nice debut for Heather Graham, and it is a masterful acting from William S. Burroughs.
I:9494;38;Drugstore Cowboy is a style that Gus Van Sant experimented with and is improved more for his next film My Own Private Idaho.
I:9494;39;He eventually puts together all of his trademarks and have them realized fully for actualization in Good Will Hunting.
I:9494;40;All in all, Drugstore Cowboy is a superb film.9/13: Matt Dillon's performance makes Drugstore Cowboy a very watchable picture.
I:9494;41;One nice thing about Drugstore Cowboy is that drugs are not being glamorized.
I:9494;42;There is a nice chain of ebb and flow about the habits of the junkies, and then the decision is made to go clean.
I:9494;43;All in all, I enjoyed watching Drugstore Cowboy.
I:9494;44;I love this movie because it is funny, interesting and rings true.
I:9494;45;I would recommend it to anyone.
I:9494;46;This is Gus Van Sant's best movie to date, no question.
I:9494;47;The acting and script for Drugstore Cowboy are so tight, it's great.
I:9494;48;And the music is divine too .
I:9494;49;like conclusion pops us one.
I:9494;50;Above all, this movie comes across as very honest and heartfelt, emotional without being corny, effective without being preachy.
I:9494;51;edition features a fine transfer of the film .
I:9494;52;if your a junky, or just enjoy watching junkies this movie is awesome.
I:9494;53;if you just enjoy using however its also a great movie to get high to.
I:9494;54;so that was fun, i wouldnt recommend it thou.
I:9494;55;This was a interesting movie.
I:9494;56;A story about a couple of young adults that were very bad and finely one got himself clean.
I:9494;57;Excellent yarn about a group of addicts that rob pharmacies back in the day.
I:9494;58;It is DEFINITELY worth a look!
I:9494;59;van Sant's visual style, however, is a small redeeming factor.
I:9494;60;The natural grittiness sets the mood well, and his ability to linger on a shot (though not as dramaticly as he would in films like Gerry) is noteable.
I:9494;61;The hat on the bed is worth the price of admission alone.
I:9494;62;He stole the truth from the rightful people who lived in and around Robert Hugh's life and still do, that of course is his family.
I:9494;63;Not one bit from cover to cover reflects an ounce of his life, the truth and a his personal testimony.
I:9494;64;This film came out in 1989, funny because it looks modern.
I:9494;65;Drugstore Cowboy is probably the most surreal of them all, with visuals of pills and needles flying in front of your face.
I:9494;66;It also showcases Matt Dillon's best acting as a superstition.
I:9494;67;But it's still one of the best movies I've ever seen.
I:9494;68;I am always surprised at how many people have not heard of this film.
I:9494;69;Although released back in 1989, this is definitely one of Van Sant's best films.
I:9494;70;Some of the pranks they pull on the detective they are eluding are also pretty humorous.
I:9494;71;the movie definitely captures the 70's era well with its acting, dialogue and wardrobe.
I:9494;72;this movie is a creative little exploration into the day to day routine and psyche of the junkie, so if you can't handle the portrayal of this reality, then this is another movie that isn't for you.
I:9494;73;Interestingly, William Burroughs plays a short role as a junkie priest, adding some penetrating social commentary towards the end.
I:9494;74;Matt Dillon is really good in this movie.
I:9494;75;The old junkie priest is great and kind of creepy.
I:9494;76;leaves the viewer to reach their own moral of the story.
I:9494;77;Would recommend for mayor viewers.
I:9494;78;This is a must see for people who grew up in the late 60's and 70's drug culture.
I:9494;79;"set in Portland during the early 70s
I:9494;80;"Excellent quips such as Dillon's character referring to a young junky as a ""TV Baby"" make for a meaningful and scintillating script."
I:9494;81;It's also a humorous movie with certain scenes retaining an understated comic appeal.
I:9494;82;While the sets give a fantastic portrait of 1970s west coast junkie life.
I:9494;83;the always intriguing late William Burroughs makes an appearance in the last quarter of the picture as Father Murphy, a well known old school addict who also happens to be a man of the cloth.
I:9494;84;drugstore Cowboy is simply brilliant all the way around and stands as an example of what American film making can achieve if the giant studios are kept from meddling in the artistic process.
I:9494;85;matt Dillon, impressively for the first time I have ever seen, acts really well and does something great, displaying a character (Bob) who knows how to deceive the police with his tricks, attended also by his beautiful lover (Dianne, played by pretty Kelly Lynch) and two others (Rick and Nadine),who follow him throughout to get their portions, and [oftenly] getting killed by their gold.
I:9494;86;"what the movie displays here as message is that, maybe, if you have freewill and belief in yourself, you might transcend your wounds and vices and get ""fixed"" in a ""real life"" ambit."
I:9494;87;The film just gets better and better with time.
I:9494;88;the fantastic acting and script is combined witha brilliant picture to present a film that is equal partsfunny and serious.
I:9494;89;Van Sant does a great job of smoothlypresenting a story that is straightforward and thought provokingwithout being cloying or over.
I:9494;90;The film's score is excellentas well.
I:9494;91;Cast was fantastic and very realistic.
I:9494;92;The actors really brought to life the essence of their characters.
I:9494;93;It revealed the mindset of the times.
I:9494;94;Great performances by the cast.
I:9494;95;The commentary track by director Van Sant and actor Dillon is informative.
I:9494;96;of documentary is superior to most.
I:9494;97;this is a truly great film, and is one of my top ten favorites of all time.
I:9494;98;The acting is superb, and the story is refreshingly unique.
I:9494;99;This is a film EVERYONE should see in their life, and its importance is matched by very few films ever made.
I:9494;100;It delivers its message without being graphic.
I:9494;101;A brilliant piece of film.
I:9494;102;making I encourage everyone to see.
I:9494;103;Matt Dillon is unusually good.
I:9494;104;The story is exciting and suspenseful with some surprisingly funny moments as well.
I:9494;105;but something, something to releive the pressures of their everyday life.
I:9494;106;The filming is good, the acting is good, the story is good.
I:9494;107;One of my favorite new additions.
I:9494;108;an seminal work framed in a beautiful, haunting city.
I:9494;109;The commentary by Van Sant is spiced with behind.
I:9494;110;For those familiar with Portland, OR .
I:9494;111;The transfer is great and well worth the conversion from VHS.
I:9494;112;An added bonus is the featurette that follows the production.
I:9494;113;This is one of my all time favorite movies so I was thrilled when I found the book in a library about 8 yeas ago.
I:9494;114;It's nice to see a filmmaker use the best parts rather that leave them out like so many book.
I:9494;115;i also like that the book has a happy ending, Bob lives!
I:9494;116;That makes you stick to your addiction, to your group.
I:9494;117;But one thing is sure.
I:9494;118;The documentary with Dillon and Gus Van Zant discussing how they made the film was fantastic.
I:9494;119;Their is also a behind the scenes segment that show's the director setting up carious arty shots.
I:9494;120;Matt Dillon and Kelly Lynch are great, as is James Lagross and Heather Graham.
I:9494;121;William S. Burroughs is pretty cool as a defrocked priest.
I:9494;122;One of my all time favorites.
I:9494;123;Remarkable performances by a brilliant ensemble of actors, from Matt Dillon to Kelly Lynch, Heather Graham to William Burroughs.
I:9494;124;They not only deliver a brilliant and original story, but make you care about each of these less.
I:9494;125;This is the type of movie that not only is fascinating to watch, but makes an impact on you.
I:9494;126;Hughes takes his gang of four on the road in pursuit of drugs.
I:9494;127;Even to the point where Matt Dillon's own mom won't even let him into his house because she's afraid he'll steal something to pond for dope [The most powerful scene in the movie]This movie's acting is excellent, as well as the directing, and I would recommend this to anyone.
I:9494;128;Dillon excels as the quick.
I:9494;129;superbly played by Lynch, LeGros, and a young Heather Graham.
I:9494;130;With stylish camerawork and black humor, Van Sant depicts the ravaging effects of drug abuse on this dysfunctional family, while Dillon's voiceover adds a twinge of sadness.
I:9494;131;And who else but William S. Burroughs could make such a convincing dope.
I:9494;132;First off, let me say that Drugstore Cowboy is a great film, one of my favorites.
I:9494;133;Other times, it looks really nice.
I:9494;134;The sound is a 2.0 digital mix.
I:9494;135;Nothing great, but a good mix.
I:9494;136;Everything sounds clean and it has very good detail and level.
I:9494;137;The documentary is an interesting making of look at the film and is a nice extra.
I:9494;138;The commentary track features both Matt Dillon and Gus Van Sant and is fairly interesting.
I:9494;139;I recommend that you spend your money on something like Trainspotting instead.
I:9494;140;"Same drug culture, more originality 
I:9494;141;Matt Dillon establishes himself as Hollywood's A. list Bad Boy and all around brilliant yet unassuming actor.
I:9494;142;The entire cast shines through the scenes of adolescent depravity as we become more and more invested in their misguided lives.
I:9494;143;Totally holds up and is as entertaining as ever.
I:9494;144;"fated alcoholic pair in ""The Days of Wine and Roses"", Bob and Diane are destined to part ways, the drugs that brought them together eventually dooming their marriage."

I:9494;150;he plays a druggy and he has a girlfriend played wonderfully by Kelly Lynch and he has two friends, James LeGros and Heather Graham and he also has a cop on his ass played nicely by James Remar.
I:9494;151;It is raw giving an in depth view of those who chose to walk on the wild side of main lining drugs.
I:9494;152;Matt Dillon and co stars do a fantastic job.
I:9494;153;"This Indie exceeds all expectations and genuinely takes the viewer on a ""trip."""
I:9494;154;Matt Dillon is perfect as the team.

I:9494;156;"She plays good ""dead"" by the way."
I:9494;157;It is a sheer delight to see William S. Burroughs in this excellently directed drug.
I:9494;158;I think it's Gus van Zandt's finest work because it never takes sides regarding drug use/abuse, gets the most out of Dillon's persona, and is just a very engaging story.
I:9494;159;One of the classic mstt dillon mmovies .
I:9494;160;Directed by Gus Van Sant, _Drugstore Cowboy_ is a totally unique film with a totally unique cast:Bob .
I:9494;161;There are valuable lessons to be learned here.
I:9494;162;This story takes place in the Pacific Northwest during the early 1970s and it has a great soundtrack.
I:9494;163;Another touching scene comes when Bob's mom finds him and Dianne at her door: Oh Lord, it's my dope fiend thief of a son and his crazy little nymphomaniac wife.
I:9494;164;A series of misadventures (some of them very funny) lead Bob to the conclusion that there must be more to life than just staying high.
