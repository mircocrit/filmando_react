I:9805;1;Almost Famous is equally about the love of music as about the story of a band.
I:9805;2;The characters and plot are well crafted and it's even more interesting to watch because it's Crowe's autobiography.
I:9805;3;Anyone who has a deep love of music will probably enjoy this movie, especially the many references to (what I consider to be) good music ( Pet Sounds , Raw Power , White Light/White Heat , etc).
I:9805;4;It was definitely worth the price I paid for it!
I:9805;5;"Deserving of the Oscar nods and rave reviews it received, ""Almost Famous"" not only reflects on a generation searching for itself through the excesses of sex, drugs and rock and roll, but expresses the human side of us that keeps us honest no matter our role in life."
I:9805;6;At times exciting, nostalgic, captivating and moving, Cameron Crowe's semi.
I:9805;7;autobiographical story of becoming a rock and roll journalist in a time when rock and roll was spreading its wings on new horizons finds itself appealing to many people on many levels.
I:9805;8;"cast assembly of actors tell a wonderful story that hits the human side of ""Behind the Music""."
I:9805;9;but none the less, this is a great movie!
I:9805;10;Cameron Crowe creates a delightful film about an up.
I:9805;11;This film has a great story and some brilliant acting to back it up.
I:9805;12;While trying to do an assignment for Creem Magazine, William comes across the new band Stillwater.
I:9805;13;Kate Hudson does a excellent performance as Penny Lane, a groupie William befriends who helps him get inside of Stillwater.
I:9805;14;So William joins the band on a tour to end all tours.
I:9805;15;Almost Famous has some great scenes that include a charming Tiny Dancer bus ride that will make you smile.
I:9805;16;what makes this film so great is that it is true to what the film is all about.
I:9805;17;With a soundtrack that includes Led Zepplin, The Who, Lynyrd Skynyrd, and Elton John, the music truly adds to the mood of the film.
I:9805;18;The film is done wonderfully from the beginning credits to the subtle yet surprising ending.
I:9805;19;Almost Famous is a great film that is destined to be a classic.
I:9805;20;Its so well made that it looks like it was made in 1973.
I:9805;21;Fantastic story, really funny, great cast, all this and an unbelievable soundtrack to sing along to.
I:9805;22;this is my favorite movie of all time.
I:9805;23;basically its about a boy that just loves music, and he went to a radio station and was given a report to write about a band, and he goes to a concert.
I:9805;24;This is one of my favorite movies of all time.
I:9805;25;Great sound track, great plot, great movie.
I:9805;26;I recommend this movie to all the people that just want to sit down and musically get into a groove.
I:9805;27;Critics stated this was the best movie of all.
I:9805;28;There is something very endearing about this film.
I:9805;29;I have seen it several times and it doesn't disappoint.
I:9805;30;Curl up in a nostalgic mode and enjoy.
I:9805;31;It seemed like such an era of real emotion and adventure.
I:9805;32;By the description above you can tell I really connected with this movie.
I:9805;33;I guess it's because the script was based on Crowe's real life and he did actually live the story.
I:9805;34;Along with the great actors who put themselves into the characters.
I:9805;35;The realism was unlike anything I've ever seen, it was like watching a documentary but a whole lot more enjoyable.
I:9805;36;His name is Michael Angarano and he played the 11 year old version of William Miller and even though he was only in the movie for the first 8 minuted of dialogue, I thought he was really great.
I:9805;37;Mike added to the real emotion as well as the older and more well.
I:9805;38;This move gave me the best feeling I had in years.
I:9805;39;it works on so many levels,but I enjoied it mostly becouse it rocked.
I:9805;40;i felt the fame,the heartace,the love.
I:9805;41;This movie will make you nostalgic for a simpler time even if you were born in 1998.
I:9805;42;hoffman action and though his part is short and sweet, it really is one of his roles in my opinion.
I:9805;43;Great soundtrack, great humor, and great dialogue and character development.
I:9805;44;But this is his best work of art.
I:9805;45;well, at first I was thinking: Hmmm This is kind of good movie.
I:9805;46;And so far I had a great stomach.
I:9805;47;and I think it was one of the best movies Ive seen this year or maybe ever.
I:9805;48;Great acting, great music (I still don't like this type of music a lot, but it was great.
I:9805;49;version of this song performed by my favorite singer Vanessa Paradis), great screenplay, great work of all the film's cast.
I:9805;50;So I want to thank everybody who made this touching, happy and lyrical picture about music, love, life and growing.
I:9805;51;kate Hudson does a standout job as the band.
I:9805;52;She follows the band around because she is a fan.
I:9805;53;She also a charming relationship with the main character.
I:9805;54;Hudson's character is convincing and lovable, in spite of her obvious issues.
I:9805;55;patrick Fugit does a great job as the teenage lead.
I:9805;56;one can tell that Crowe care deeply about this film.
I:9805;57;It seems that this film comes from Crowe's own longing to be cool.
I:9805;58;You won, Cameron Crowe.you made a cool movie.
I:9805;59;this also features an early role for Zooey Deschanel.
I:9805;60;She is charming as always.
I:9805;61;it's a fun movie and a very realistic portrayal of life on the road.
I:9805;62;Finally a movie that got the early seventies right.
I:9805;63;sweet or to the satanic, at last we have a film that is true to its era and will be enjoyed by the millions of people who remember it fondly.
I:9805;64;and, I hope, by millions of younger people too.
I:9805;65;the plot is pretty straightforward.
I:9805;66;He goes out with the band on tour and has to wrestle with keeping his journalistic integrity intact in the face of his growing affection for the band.
I:9805;67;it's very true to life and in my opinion captures the wide.
I:9805;68;open mood of the late sixties/early seventies in good spirit.
I:9805;69;This is a tremendous movie, extremely satisfying, and I can recommend it to anyone who qualifies for its MPAA rating.
I:9805;70;There is an occasional laugh and reasonably good acting especially by the lead singer, the mentor writer from Creem and the kid weren't too bad.
I:9805;71;It seems as if based on many of the reviews, the soundtrack is the real star of this movie which brings up another point.
I:9805;72;After the touching tale of Jerry McGuire, Crowe comes back to write what could be interpreted as a type of self.
I:9805;73;As a young kid growing up, Crowe was also a rock journalist, and he acturately portrays the triumphs and downfalls of the profession in this movie.
I:9805;74;Crudup and Jason Lee are truly the best two performers in the movie.
I:9805;75;Lee gives an outstanding performance as the lead singer of the band Feverdog, and Crudup is a kid who the audience feels for the entire movie.
I:9805;76;level band learning what it takes to stay together through the media, ALMOST FAMOUS is definitely a movie you need to check out.
I:9805;77;love this freaking awesome movie and good directing.
I:9805;78;Probably my favorite of Cameron Crowe's work.
I:9805;79;Fantastic period piece with masterful acting across the board.
I:9805;80;If you haven't seen this, you should get it today and enjoy it.
I:9805;81;It'll take you back to an era when music was more than marketing.
I:9805;82;I watched this movie and many others, as a homage to Mr. Hoffman's work.
I:9805;83;Great music written by Nancy Wilson (Heart).
I:9805;84;Just like the dinosaur music that makes up this self.
I:9805;85;Nothing, and on top it has some great actors that do a rather fantastic job of make the movie a GREAT movie.
I:9805;86;Cameron's love of music and film really shines in Almost Famous.
I:9805;87;And the cast is just perfect!!
I:9805;88;This film has a special place in my heart and this edition makes me love it even more.
I:9805;89;as well as his previous works Jerry Maguire, Singles, and Say Anything.
I:9805;90;has been the story of love.
I:9805;91;The film revolves around William, with well.
I:9805;92;written dialogues by Crowe, attached with emotional, dramatic, realistic and humorous subplots.
I:9805;93;To be completely honest, when I first saw this film about five years ago I was under.
I:9805;94;It had been hyped up and won all sorts of awards and received so much attention, and really I didn't see why.
I:9805;95;"The film moved me in ways I didn't remember the first time
I:9805;96;The script is so real and raw, which I attest to the fact that director Cameron Crowe wrote this as a semi.
I:9805;97;autobiographic tale, and that first hand insight really gives `Almost Famous' an edge as possible his best film to date (and that's saying a lot since he has always been a genuinely talented director).
I:9805;98;What he finds within their world is something starkly contrasts to anything he imagined.
I:9805;99;It is a world that entices and appeals to him, but at the same time it's a world that conflicts with his inner person, especially as he watches the fame tear the band apart and take out innocent bystanders in the wake.
I:9805;100;speak and the process proceeds to shake up the members and all those in their company.
I:9805;101;the performances by most the entire cast is strong and lends much support to Crowe's vision.
I:9805;102;Crudup does a good job of filtering through his characters inner contempt for the corruption within his profession.
I:9805;103;but he has a feeling of honesty in his performance that works well for what Crowe was attempting.
I:9805;104;Philip Seymour Hoffman is rarely seen moving around, but his grasp of his characters idealisms has a strong influence on the film.
I:9805;105;Her innocent devotion to a machine that just wants to use her, a machine that doesn't care enough about her to deserve her unwavering adoration is just so raw and believable and sympathetically captivating I just can't help but fall in love with her.
I:9805;106;His stamp of reality is felt on every frame.
I:9805;107;His direction is flawless, but even more amazing is the script, which bleeds on every page the smell of honesty.
I:9805;108;It may not be my favorite script of the year (`You Can Count on Me' remains one of my favorite screenplays ever written) but it is certainly one of them.
I:9805;109;`Almost Famous' truly has that extra something (not to mention the amazing soundtrack), that honesty that makes it worth every second of your time.
I:9805;110;Cameron Crowe really put himself completely into this picture, and the finished product is something he can truly be proud of, and something we can all praise him unflinchingly for.
I:9805;111;There is a difference between a movie and a film.
I:9805;112;Almost Famous is a brilliant film.
I:9805;113;It is one of the best contemporary film that I have ever seen and is an instant classic.
I:9805;114;The acting is wonderful and best of all, this film has substance.
I:9805;115;There are wonderful moments that remind you of days when you were young.
I:9805;116;It is simply a wonderful film.
I:9805;117;It captures you the moment you see the handwritten credits from the beginning.
I:9805;118;Crowe does an excellent job at being subtle about the themes of image vs. reality, coming of age, and others.
I:9805;119;"I avoided seeing this one for ages because I assumed from the previews it would be another ""kids are cool ."
I:9805;120;This movie works on so many levels and rings so absolutely true from start to finish that you don't watch it, you live it.
I:9805;121;If you were around in the 70's, and you didn't live under a rock, you knew this world, in the same way that a young boy feels he knows the players on his favorite baseball team.
I:9805;122;although there is plenty of star power here, all the monumentally talented actors are still unknown enough to bring nothing but talent to their roles.
I:9805;123;Even Kate Hudson, the archtypical Hollywood insider, is fresh and new and utterly believable.
I:9805;124;As an Oscar winner and three time nominee, she's nobody's unknown, but her gift for loosing herself in memorable roles shines again as the mother of a young Carmeron Crowe.
I:9805;125;"there are moments
I:9805;126;A classic movie to watch with friends.
I:9805;127;This has always been a favorite movie of mine, I can't help but watch it.
I:9805;128;ALMOST FAMOUS Is a totally awesome and entertaining movie.
I:9805;129;loved it from the first time I saw it :) FIVE STARS across the board!!!!!
I:9805;130;Haven't enjoyed a movie this much since viewing AUGUST RUSH
I:9805;131;This movie was soo great.
I:9805;132;The movie had some funny parts, especially with the mother.
I:9805;133;if you haven't seen it, you should because it is worth seeing.
I:9805;134;Easy Oscar contender with those scenes, understandably not without.
I:9805;135;I always liked this movie but the bootleg cut is outstanding if made the movie new.
I:9805;136;as a whole this copy is a new movie and I loved all of it if there were revivals of movies this copy would win another Oscar.
I:9805;137;In this film, these bands are rolled up into a four.
I:9805;138;A young man raised in an unusual household, with an unusual mother, is taking his first steps to adulthood.
I:9805;139;Elaine Miller is able to freak out most people, with a few choice words but to her son, she is home, safety, love and in a way.
I:9805;140;She is very intense but caring and it is this combination which drives her eighteen year old daughter to a life of airline stewardship.
I:9805;141;We can see Elaine's true courage however, when she agrees to let the fifteen year old William go on the road with a drug taking, womanizing rock band.
I:9805;142;one of the most important people William comes into contact with, on his journey, is Penny Lane.
I:9805;143;She is a beautiful, glowing, perfectly permed young dryad who follows the bands and has a following of her own.
I:9805;144;Her subscribers refrain from sex with the performers in an effort to more truly embrace the pure experience.
I:9805;145;She talks a good game but in the end, she's just a young woman in love.
I:9805;146;Despite William's best intentions and the good advice of his mentor, Lester Bangs, the band manages to seduce him.
I:9805;147;There is one truly touching scene where the band, (and company), is riding their bus to the next gig and singing along to Tiny Dancer.
I:9805;148;William leans over to Penny and says, I have to go home!
I:9805;149;To which she replies, with a magical pass of her hand, You are home.
I:9805;150;William starts his professional career as a fan, loving the band, the music and the whole lifestyle.
I:9805;151;Conversely, Penny Lane is introduced to us as the epitome of sophistication.
I:9805;152;She is young but knowing, and handles William as an older sister might.
I:9805;153;She is just as fragile and naively hopeful as any other girl her age.
I:9805;154;everything about this film is fascinating.
I:9805;155;The music is just wonderful, with Billy Crudup and Jason Lee bringing authenticity to every performance.
I:9805;156;This climaxes during the famous plane crash scare, when each confesses their deepest secrets to the unrestrained laughter of the audience.
I:9805;157;William, his Mother and Penny are all unforgettable creations.
I:9805;158;Crowe is a wonderful writer, so good in fact, that I am disappointed he didn't turn this story into a book.
I:9805;159;Watching the movie will just have to be enough, for now.
I:9805;160;"Cameron Crowe has without a doubt made many great films (though his recent work has been lacking), but it's no contest which of his films is his masterpiece: ""Almost Famous""."
I:9805;161;"Funny, inspiring, and at times heartwarming, and backed by one of the best soundtracks ever, ""Almost Famous"" is a cinematic masterpiece that I would place right up there along with ""Goodfellas"" and ""The Godfather""."
I:9805;162;Mentored by world renowned rock writer Lester Bangs (a perfectly snide Philip Seymour Hoffman), he is given by the biggest assignment of his life.
I:9805;163;"He also meets the woman who will change his life: ""band aid"" Penny Lane (Kate Hudson, who steals the show)."
I:9805;164;Over the course of the tour, William does a lot of growing up, and learns of the harsh realities of the music industry.
I:9805;165;The cast is wonderful, and the soundtrack is the greatest ever put onto a film (this can be said for several of Crowe's film soundtracks).
I:9805;166;Almost Famous is a film you'll want to watch again and again.
I:9805;167;Almost Famous is a delight from beginning to end.
I:9805;168;Cameron Crowe's valentine to his youth is warm and very funny, touching without being sacharine, and beautifully written and played.
I:9805;169;newcomer Patrick Fugit is a terrific find as the 15 year old Rolling Stone writer, bright but inexperienced, innocent but learning fast.
I:9805;170;Kate Hudson is enchanting as Penny Lane the premier band.
I:9805;171;Billy Crudup is charismatic as the lead guitarist and Jason Lee as the insecure lead singer.
I:9805;172;All the surrounding players are excellent.
I:9805;173;He has done so here.
I:9805;174;All of it rings true, because it IS true.
I:9805;175;crowe lived it and remembers with fondness the people who helped shape him.
I:9805;176;But, if you like movies with people who are flawed but basically decent, and movies with a heart.
I:9805;177;when you don't feel like thinking, but want something feel good that actually has a plot and a great sound track.
I:9805;178;This is a really great movie.
I:9805;179;It's the story of William, who's a 15.
I:9805;180;Along his trip that just keeps getting extended, William has some crazy encounters.
I:9805;181;This movie is a great movie for all people who love rock and the 70s.
I:9805;182;It's also a good story about friendship, family, and relationships in general.
I:9805;183;This movie is a must to view more than once.
I:9805;184;Though the subject is set decades ago, Almost Famous has a fresh, 21st century slant to it.
I:9805;185;The scene in the plane is just too hilarious to describe!
I:9805;186;winning flick will make you laugh, cry, and sing along with the characters and you might even learn a thing or two about the 70's.
I:9805;187;free attitude in this movie will bring you back to a more exciting time in history and can make anyone wish they were on tour with a 70's rock band.
I:9805;188;All in all, Almost Famous is a great movie.
I:9805;189;"William Miller, played by Jason Lee Patrick Fugit, finds himself at a crossroads in his life when he is given an opportunity of writing a piece for the ""Rolling Stone Magazine."""
I:9805;190;William, a fifteen year old kid, has never felt like he fits in with the rest of the crowd.
I:9805;191;He's smaller, smarter and just doesn't get what it takes to blend in with his peers.
I:9805;192;It is about a teenage boy who wants to become a reporter for the Rolling Stone, so he joins the tour of Stillwater, an up and coming rock band.
I:9805;193;Perhaps not worthy of the hype and vast praise that it has garnered, it is certainly an enjoyable film that does what it does well.
I:9805;194;That this idea has merit is substantiated by this remarkable period piece both written and directed by Cameron Crowe.
I:9805;195;"As he did in his quite captivating original screenplay for ""Fast Times At Ridgemont High"", he mines his personal background with an uncanny ear for realistic situations, dialogue, and personal experience to pull us deep into the quirky and sometimes surrealistic world of sixties rockThe protagonist of the film is a teen."
I:9805;196;open view of everything swirling around him, from sex, drugs and rock and roll to all the happenings associated with the rock and roll lifestyle itself.
I:9805;197;One finds William (newcomer Patrick Fugit) sucked into the vortex of a fictitious rock band's pulsating experience, and the moment to moment happenings surrounding Stillwater are so realistic, believable, and palpable that we roll along with it all, finding too much to remember from what we recall of the sixties.
I:9805;198;Also excellent are the ensemble of supposed Stillwater rock musicians, from Billy Crudup to Jason Lee, and the very lovely Kate Hudson showing her future potential as a leading lady in a powerful and convincing role here.
I:9805;199;The fact is that Cameron Crowe actually did experience a lot of what goes down here himself as a sixteen year old reporter, and the verve and energy in the film owes to this authentic recollection of those times, and to his uncanny ear for all the elements of the rock scene.
I:9805;200;This is a terrific movie, and although it is fiction, is also quite representative of the times it purports to describe.
I:9805;201;Regardless thoguh, I feel compelled to add my voice to those that call this a great movie.
I:9805;202;I hate to beat an overplayed drum, but it really is funny and heartwarming.
I:9805;203;Do youself a favor and take a look at it.
I:9805;204;This deservedly won the Best Original Screenplay Oscar but was pretty much ignored.
I:9805;205;Having finally gotten around to seeing it I must say that this is one of the best movies I've seen so far this year.
I:9805;206;Cameron Crowe's autobiographical film about a young music journalist wannabe who ends up on the road with a rock band is truly brilliant.
I:9805;207;Billy Crudup, Kate Hudson and Patrick Fugit all give terrific perfomances,in fact the whole cast is excellent.
I:9805;208;Heartfelt, funny, sad, touching this is a must see.
I:9805;209;I guarantee you'll LOVE it.
I:9805;210;But ALMOST FAMOUS is probably the best movie of all time.
I:9805;211;It's humorous and heartwarming (and I'm a 17.
I:9805;212;Along the way, William learns about life, true love, how to have fun, and how to be cool .
I:9805;213;The supporting cast was excellent, too especially the girl who played Anita Miller, William's older sister, Jason Lee (Stillwater's lead singer), and Ana Paquin's character.
I:9805;214;Also, the guy who played Lester Bangs was great, as well.
I:9805;215;aLMOST FAMOUS isn't just about Crowe's life as a rock writer: it's about rock 'n roll, sex, drugs, love, and everything that was great about the 70s.
I:9805;216;This is a timeless classic and if you have a great sense of humor and love everything or something about the 70s and don't want to see a movie with cheesy or corny parts, then this is definitely for you!
I:9805;217;At times it's like being at a concert!
I:9805;218;I'm not sure what players this was meant for, but I have a US player and it is perfect!
I:9805;219;After watching the Oscar nomination announcements today, I was extremely pleased to see this movie so well.
I:9805;220;After the movie was over, my girlfriend and I seriously considered seeing it again.
I:9805;221;age story is hardly new, but young Cameron Crowe's adventures were told in a delightful and unique way.
I:9805;222;and that's a good point the movie makes .
I:9805;223;Music is a driving force in many people's lives: It captures all of the emotion, love and heartache of the human spirit.
I:9805;224;Crowe made a great movie that shows us just that, and the soundtrack ain't to shabby, either.
I:9805;225;For those of you who missed this gem in the theaters, this is your chance to see one of the best movies of 2000.
I:9805;226;People fight, people love, but there is always the music.
I:9805;227;A young William lead the most unordinary childhood one could imagine.
I:9805;228;One in paticualr catches William, a girl who calls herself Penny Lane.
I:9805;229;the movie is fair in the sense of camera work, sound, and shot selection.
I:9805;230;Russel, the band's guitarist is the one that is what the lead singer wants to be.
I:9805;231;He is the famous band player and truly is what everyone wants, an easy going slacker.
I:9805;232;After a long fight and pain between the band was the best scene in the movie.
I:9805;233;The music brings them together.
I:9805;234;One of the most important things that comes of this instictual life is an affection for Penny Lane, THE bandaid.
I:9805;235;The tour had to end and everyone has to return to their respective homes and their respective lives.
I:9805;236;One part of Russel's life is his girlfriend back home.
I:9805;237;which brings us to the most interesting character of the movie, possibly of the year.
I:9805;238;She loved the music, not the thousands of screaming fans.
I:9805;239;She was the band's tiny dancer, she wanted to marry a music man.
I:9805;240;She was the tiny dancer for all of them, she is in them and always with them from then on.
I:9805;241;this was a powerful story about love, pain, but importantly life.
I:9805;242;Great script, great direction, great actors, great everything.
I:9805;243;amazing movie, and definitely in my top 10.
I:9805;244;I have to recommend this movie who hasn't seen it before, and to those people who haven't seen it, see it now, or else you will live a lonely life.
I:9805;245;I hadn't seen it since it was in theaters, and it was just as fresh and entertaining as the first time.
I:9805;246;With an excellent cast and writing, I highly recommend it.
I:9805;247;This is a fun movie to watch, the dynamics between the characters is excellent, I loved the scene in the airplane near the end, and I think it captured the spirit of the times.
I:9805;248;"OK, I can dig the cat having been a ""rock 'n roll journalist"" when he was a kid, but ."
I:9805;249;I remember `your name's not on the list' and being in love with a `band.
I:9805;250;This movie captures exactly the way it felt back then: the musicians, the road crews, the music, the girls, everything.
I:9805;251;there were a lot of little details that made it very real for me.
I:9805;252;There's a shot of the band's tour manager when he introduces the band.
I:9805;253;comedies like Still Crazy and Spinal Tap do a great job of lampooning this eras rock bands while still paying a sort of tribute and both are excellent movies but this movie falls into a category of its own.
I:9805;254;gold, the tarnished knight who comes through in the end.
I:9805;255;The extra scenes make the movie even better after having seen it a few times over the last few years.
I:9805;256;If you love this movie, this edition is worth picking up.
I:9805;257;What I enjoyed most was the use of music to emphasize what was happening in the film.
I:9805;258;Music is a large part of our lives, and its ability to take us back to specific times and places is amazing, and this movie will do that for the viewer.
I:9805;259;The story and the characters are well written and Cameron Crowe directing his own writing is always a sign of a good movie.
I:9805;260;"If you like his past movies like ""Say Anything"" or ""Singles"" you are going to Love this one."
I:9805;261;Then after watching it, I realized it's a great movie too!
I:9805;262;This has been one of my favorite movies since it first came out and I was excited to see the extended edition.
I:9805;263;Any fan of the original movie will love this version.
I:9805;264;If you liked Cameron Crowe's other well known effort Jerry Maguire then this movie will probably leave you with the same satisfied nice feeling and the same silly grin on your face.
I:9805;265;a semi autobiographical work it creeps along with humor, sentimentalism and a strong cast, ultimatly leaving you with an affectionate look back on rock culture and what it means to the musicians and the fans alike.
I:9805;266;patrick Fugit does a very good job as the young man in question and Billy Crudrup and the always great Jason Lee (Chasing Amy, Mallrats) are equally good in support.
I:9805;267;kate Hudson is the revelation, as Penny Lane she exerts the same beauty, and strange mixture of innoncence yet world weariness as a 70's Holly Golightly and by the end of the movie you feel as though you could fall in love with her in an instant, which if anything adds credibility to the fact that most men in the movie seem to do this.
I:9805;268;the soundtrack is fantastic, and while I do have a soft spot for the kind of music from the late 60's and of the early 70's I was never really a fan of some of the artists used.
I:9805;269;So credit must go to the director for this scene.
I:9805;270;depth interviews with (amongst others) Led Zeppelin, Joni Mitchell and Neil Young, fascinating reading, especially as I've already said, i have a soft spot for some artists from this time, these being some of them.
I:9805;271;I personally just love this movie!
I:9805;272;It is sweet and funny and emotional all at the same time.
I:9805;273;Kate Hudson is adorable as always!
I:9805;274;I really enjoyed the deleted scenes, even if they didn't add much to the plot.
I:9805;275;It's great to see it all, even if it's not ALL the deleted scenes!
I:9805;276;The extras, like the Stillwater concert, are fantastic.
I:9805;277;I found the director's commentary particularly interesting.
I:9805;278;I liked hearing about what inspired Cameron Crowe to make this movie.
I:9805;279;In a chat transcript for Playboy online, Bebe mentions always wanting to visit Africa someday!
I:9805;280;Boy I'm happy I decided to watch it again, as I appreciated much more now that I'm older.
I:9805;281;This is simply one of the best coming of age stories I've ever seen.
I:9805;282;It features great acting, a funny and entertaining story, and very original characters.
I:9805;283;It also features the perfect ending, I don't think I would change anything about the movie.
I:9805;284;Almost Famous is the best movie I've seen since The Hurricane.
I:9805;285;It features great performances, great humor, and an excellent story that's true and original(unlike Gladiator).
I:9805;286;This is undoubtedly the best movie released last year.
I:9805;287;Jason Lee and Kate Hudson lead the way in a hilarious movie about a rock bands rise to fame and fortune.
I:9805;288;Just take a moment to watch this instant classic and revel in the beauty that is music.
I:9805;289;For once, thank god for the Oscars!
I:9805;290;With it's Oscar win, this movie will finally get the attention it deserves.
I:9805;291;It is a simple film for the most part.
I:9805;292;It is a fantastic movie!
I:9805;293;The script is one of the best of the year 2000 and the film is an over all joy.
I:9805;294;Knowing this had to do with a rock band, and also knowing all the hype that surrounded it during it's release, I finally decided to watch it.
I:9805;295;I found I was completely correct in this assumption a mere 20 minutes into the film.
I:9805;296;"Along the way he meets, and befriends, a ""Band Aid"" who calls herself 'Penny Lane.'"
I:9805;297;She basically shows him how a band functions.
I:9805;298;but this movie is about more than just the story, it's also about the music.
I:9805;299;It features one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard, and the rousing sing.
I:9805;300;along of Elton John's 'Tiny Dancer' is worth the price alone.
I:9805;301;with memorable performances from everyone involved, this movie is without a doubt the best one I've seen in years.
I:9805;302;and didn't think he did as good as he could've), but he shows he can carry a movie as well as the next person.
I:9805;303;But the true standout is definitely Kate Hudson.
I:9805;304;Billy Crudup as Russell is one of my favorite people in this movie though.
I:9805;305;One minute he's the typical 'drugs, sex, and rock and roll' guy, the next he's a true human.
I:9805;306;Jason Lee even puts on a very good performance as the band's lead singer.
I:9805;307;A five star movie all the way.
I:9805;308;At first impression, the story of a young boy coming of age.
I:9805;309;on second thought, much more than this.
I:9805;310;He absorbs the impact of his new experiences in the wild world of rock and roll.
I:9805;311;it is fitting that he should love a woman who represents the opposite .
I:9805;312;conscious fantasy world, in love with a rock star.
I:9805;313;She walks as if an apparition.
I:9805;314;It is through her eyes that the lead guitarist sees himself as genuine and talented.
I:9805;315;The band wonders whether he wants them.
I:9805;316;He wonders whether he wants the band.
I:9805;317;but he stays with them because it makes him look cool.
I:9805;318;He accepts popularity with his band as an alternative to developing his full talent.
I:9805;319;his band is becoming popular, taking the leap from small.
I:9805;320;the question facing these characters is what is real?
I:9805;321;Seen this way, the movie becomes a stunningly integrated masterpiece.
I:9805;322;the boy's face has an innocence that stems from truth.
I:9805;323;"And that is why everyone is unusually honest with him
I:9805;324;An age of innocence and of responsibility.
I:9805;325;An age of happiness and of anger.
I:9805;326;An age of music and of everything but music.
I:9805;327;Penny shows Miller the otherworldness of rock music.
I:9805;328;She shows him it's heart and soul personified by Stillwater.
I:9805;329;present hysteria of 70's rock and roll bombard Miller in this powerful film with a wonderful pace and brilliant performances.
I:9805;330;And this film brings it all together to tell us the true story.
I:9805;331;I remember the dedication and memorial in Creem when Lester Bangs died.
I:9805;332;I also love his hatred of Rolling Stone, a magazine that regular readers of Creem always knew was a poser and pretender in the world of rock magazines.
I:9805;333;The boy, Patrick Fugit, is charming and perfectly cast as a shy, naive fledgling reporter.
I:9805;334;A lot has been written about Kate Hudson's performance and it's all true.
I:9805;335;Billy Crudup's character is likable, despite his bad behavior.
I:9805;336;the supporting cast are all outstanding.
I:9805;337;Despite the bad behavior of the band and the potential to show the dehumanizing treatment of groupies by misogynistic rock stars the movie glosses it all over and everyone acts with honor.
I:9805;338;I really enjoyed this movie.
I:9805;339;No blood and guts, no action, In the spirit of Mr. Hollands Opus,This is truly a good movie, It may not be considered great, but It compells me to submit a review to give credit where credit is due, 5 stars, it made me feel.
I:9805;340;I saw ALMOST FAMOUS last year and loved every minute of it.
I:9805;341;It's about a young man pursuing his dream!
I:9805;342;aLMOST FAMOUS will make you laugh.
I:9805;343;Above all else, this movie made me remember just how passionately I loved music when I was a teenager.
I:9805;344;They tell you when to start playing it and the scene is complete.
I:9805;345;Grat price and Good story with great rock n roll soundtracks from the past.
I:9805;346;ray provided clear picture and good sound.
I:9805;347;depth than the theatrical version and the extras are well worth it.
I:9805;348;depth with really great interviews and an honest and unmerciful audio.
I:9805;349;For anyone who loves true rock music, I highly recommend this special edition as you get swept along for the highs, lows and everything in between.
I:9805;350;A few years ago, when i first saw this movie, i absolutely loved it!!
I:9805;351;"Now that i have the ""bootleg"" edition, i love the movie even more!"
I:9805;352;the extra footage is great at adding more depth to the characters and to the story!!
I:9805;353;if you're a big fan of the movie as i am, you should definitely pick this up!!
I:9805;354;I got lucky to see this movie once, and I am thinking about to see it twice.
I:9805;355;The little kid finds hipocresy, corruption, lies and fake success in a medium also filled with love and friendship.
I:9805;356;The dycotomy of life, just exactly how it is.
I:9805;357;The music is beautiful, of course, and Zep could have been less egotistical and give a few more tracks to the soundtrack.
I:9805;358;Plus he meets this sterotypical wild girl that has sex with him plus with a few other girls in the room.)
I:9805;359;This story is truly about Sex, Drugs and Rock.
I:9805;360;It is NOT a family movie though.
I:9805;361;what I liked best about the movie is the ending.
I:9805;362;director Cameron Crowe makes a movie every bit as good as his Say Anything and Jerry McGuire.
I:9805;363;He is equally good at handling teenagers and adults in his work without making them look like caricatures.
I:9805;364;Patrick, who plays the young Crowe, does a wonderful job throughout too.
I:9805;365;Crowe understands people and he renders them as perfectly as the rock music scene, which makes this a movie everyone can enjoy.
I:9805;366;Crowe deservedly won the Oscar for his writing.
I:9805;367;beautiful film with an awesome soundtrack.
I:9805;368;It draws you in and makes you forget who and where you are.
I:9805;369;Fans will enjoy the extras scenes, commentaries and behind the scenes info on this long version.
I:9805;370;The bootleg look and style of this edition are great fun too.
I:9805;371;The performances and script are memorable, plot and story make it one of my all time favorites!
I:9805;372;She is NOT a groupie, she is a Band.
I:9805;373;"aids"" do it for the love of the music."
I:9805;374;Probably more Allman Brothers, though not nearly as Southern, with a charismatic guitarist, Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup), representing Duanne Allman, and a talented, though overshadowed, lead singer.
I:9805;375;What is eerie about it is that the opening scene of Almost Famous, the first music heard, is actually the aforementioned Chipmonks, as the young William Miller (Michael Angarano) listens on the radio.
I:9805;376;Back to Jason Lee, though, he not only sang well, he also acted his part superbly, bristling in the shadow of egomaniac Russell Hammond.
I:9805;377;Crudup's character is revealed when he attends a party with some mid.
I:9805;378;There is a lot of mistrust and animus between musician and journalist.
I:9805;379;One of the Rolling Stone interviews is of Frampton, just after the huge success ofFrampton Comes Alive!
I:9805;380;But the amiable Frampton took his success in stride, and seems to have also taken his subsequent fall from grace quite well.
I:9805;381;But the writing is very impressive, and all the more so when you consider the author's tender age.
I:9805;382;patrick Fugit, playing the Cameron Crowe/William Miller character does a fantastic job of acting as well.
I:9805;383;acted, and what is most striking is that he makes eye contact with Penny Lane throughout, and you feel that there is some kind of strange love between them, however unrequited it may be.
I:9805;384;Another scene that shows Crowe's skill as a director was one in which Penny Lane (whose real name is finally revealed as Lady Goodman) is smashed on qualudes.
I:9805;385;It is just this sort of juxtaposition that makes the mise en sc ne of auteur Cameron Crowe unique, and why watching any of his films is always such an enjoyable experience.
I:9805;386;crafted comedy about writer/director Cameron Crowe's real.
I:9805;387;life adventures as a precocious teenage rock and roll journalist in the seventies.
I:9805;388;It has wit, great pacing and editing, and a big heart.
I:9805;389;"The music is okay though it can never be mistaken for being the soul of the story
I:9805;390;She deserved the Oscar nomination.
I:9805;391;Ultimately, the film is a bit gentle.
I:9805;392;I just got this movie yesterday.
I:9805;393;Im going to start an online group dedicated to bringing back Rock and discovering modern day artist who hold on to that unique sound.
I:9805;394;It speaks to me in more ways than one.
I:9805;395;These songs can do that again.
I:9805;396;One of my favorite movies of all time.
I:9805;397;This movie makes the seventies rock scene appear cutsie and innocent.
I:9805;398;Coming of age was never so exciting and wonderful than it was for william miller in the year 1973.
I:9805;399;He sets out for the adventure of a life time which we all wish we had, and he does that with he's boyishly charm and heart.
I:9805;400;When kate Hudson laughs, you just laugh back.
I:9805;401;it's always nice to make memories a little prettier then they really were, and cameron succeeds in doing just that, for the viewers pure pleasure.
I:9805;402;and he does that magically well and to the beat of Rock Roll.
I:9805;403;the plane crushing scene was one of the funniest and sophisticated in comedy history.
I:9805;404;it's a movie to watch again and again, and to embrace as a make.you.
I:9805;405;good film, because it's just that.
I:9805;406;This is a great movie with a great soundtrack about a kid who gets caught up in the rock and roll scene after getting an opportunity to write for Cream Magazine.
I:9805;407;A great watch especially for rock junkies.
I:9805;408;What an incredible edition of an incredible film.
I:9805;409;This movie was the best movie I had ever seen before this release, and i couldn't imagine how better it could have gotten.
I:9805;410;Everybody in this film gives a superb performance (Kate Hudson was robbed at The Oscars), and the film itself is a masterpiece.
I:9805;411;"It gives an honest backstage view of the final glory days of rock, before rock changed to an ""Industry of Cool""."
I:9805;412;One of the most entertaining movies I have ever seen.
I:9805;413;The soundtrack is incredible, also.
I:9805;414;But First, he has to write an Article on a Up and Rising band named Stillwater, he has to spin weeks with the Group.
I:9805;415;Great Performances by Fugit, Crudup, Hudson (In a Oscar Nominated Role), Francis Mc Dormand (In a Oscar Nominated Role) and Jason Lee.
I:9805;416;Cameron Crowe win an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay and it was Oscar Nominated for Best Editing.
I:9805;417;This is a one of a kind film.
I:9805;418;Okay, I love classic rock.
I:9805;419;like in its evocation of 70's era rock, its look and its sound.
I:9805;420;Rock and Roll is a lifestyle as much as a form of entertainment?
I:9805;421;on the other hand, the performances are above average throughout this film.
I:9805;422;In fact, the strongest part of this movie is in the likeable and realistic characterizations.
I:9805;423;Crowe clearly uses his experiences to great advantage here.
I:9805;424;Crowe seems to labor under the impression that a wide audience will be as interested as what his formative years were like as he is.
I:9805;425;but this is such an uncommonly good film,I'm going to throw my two cents worth in anyway.
I:9805;426;for whom music would become not something they simply enjoyed,but more something that they lived for.
I:9805;427;some will go on to write and record,others to write about those that do.
I:9805;428;it's all good!This film is about those people, and that music.
I:9805;429;Cameron Crowe's brilliance lies in his ability to,in this film give the music a face.
I:9805;430;one scene in particular that stands as a testimony to both Her skills as an actress and Crowe's as a Director is when her character boards the plane.
I:9805;431;hudson is able to convey so much and so many emotions just through Her face, that you are simply blown away.
I:9805;432;i've watched a great many films in my life,but I've never,ever seen anything that I would consider PERFECT.
I:9805;433;It is one of my favorites of all time.
I:9805;434;The movie has a lot of feel to it, you are on this roller.
I:9805;435;Jason Lee, as the egotistical but likeable singer, Jeff Bebe, is my favorite.
I:9805;436;This movie goes from hilarious to sad and back again.
I:9805;437;Almost Famous was one of the most highly anticipated movies of the year.
I:9805;438;Almost Famous is one of the most satisfying films of the year.
I:9805;439;"But what these critics don't realize is that Almost Famous is a piece of nostalgia
I:9805;440;He loved everything about the seventies, especially the music and the fact that he got to grow up in that decade.
I:9805;441;this labor of love has it all: great performances, great dialogue, and a wonderful story.
I:9805;442;The film's centerpiece of rock is observed gracefully by newcomer Patrick Fudgit (I think that's his name).
I:9805;443;Crowe does a masterful job of showing us this world through Fudgit's excited, wide eyes.
I:9805;444;As a writer myself, I saw this movie looking forward to a film i heard was really great and deserving of every award it was nominated for.
I:9805;445;She had a few good lines, but all she did was prance around and smile.
I:9805;446;It was sweet of Penny Lane to give the Stillwater leader Crowe's address.
I:9805;447;Almost Famous is one of those movies that give me great pleasure every time I watch it.
I:9805;448;The characters are so easy to like and the story is just so humane.
I:9805;449;Practically anyone can relate to those people personified by top.
I:9805;450;This was one of least entertaining movies I have ever seen.
I:9805;451;This film hits very close to home.
I:9805;452;life journeys and writings of some of rock and roll's biggest names(at least during the 70's anyways), the film is a kind of autobiographical.
I:9805;453;liked that Rolling Stone offers to send him on tour with the band and do a piece on them.
I:9805;454;And so the journey begins.
I:9805;455;Flawed, funny, and weirdly likable.
I:9805;456;Patrick Fugit is good in some scenes but other scenes it's almost like he didn't go further than he could've.
I:9805;457;Phillip Seymour Hoffman also gives a great performance as Lester Bangs, an actual journalist.
I:9805;458;personally on a given day, I still prefer Jerry Maguire but this is probably Cameron's 2nd best film, even though it's obviously his most personal.
I:9805;459;It is absolutely mindboggling that ANYONE could possibly like this movie .
I:9805;460;yet look at all these glowing reviews.
I:9805;461;faced journalist guy (So cute!
I:9805;462;if you think a life of rock and roll is this sweet and tame, you're an idiot.
I:9805;463;A good movie, espically for fans of Classic Rock.
I:9805;464;One of the best movies ever made.
I:9805;465;Great story and great acting overall.
I:9805;466;a perfect film, one of the best .
I:9805;467;shows time and place perfectly .
I:9805;468;Which is why I swooned throughout the entire movie the very first time I saw it, falling in love with each of the characters (Penny Lane especially, for her motherly concern for the well being of others, her fragile facade of iron will while being so obviously soft, and her unbelievably real sweetness).
I:9805;469;Penny Lane is a falling leaf in this film, beautiful and fragile and adrift on the changing winds of other's emotions.
I:9805;470;I feel this is perfectly appropriate for the scene, for its underappreciated beauty and time.
I:9805;471;capsule capture of that one fleeting sense of drifting away from innocence and daydreams, wanting to hold on, yet understanding and saying goodbye anyway.
I:9805;472;concert grounds with a rose and a smile, spinning on a napkin, and the innocent, unabashed brown love gaze of William Miller through the colored scarves of the band.
I:9805;473;i can watch this movie a million times and I would give it as many stars if I could.
I:9805;474;One of the best quotes: The only currency in this bankrupt world are the things we share with each other when we're uncool.
I:9805;475;This is a perfect film.
I:9805;476;son love ever displayed in cinema.
I:9805;477;The bond between young William and his wise sage of a mother is the true heart and soul of this story.
I:9805;478;It is interesting that Cameron Crowe is such a fan of To Kill a Mockingbird.
I:9805;479;That film is the best father.
I:9805;480;look at her love and relief that he's. . . HOME.
I:9805;481;Further, her dressing down of Billy Crudup's character is one of the funniest scenes in any film ( ye.yes, ma'am. )
I:9805;482;There are so many wonderful scenes in this film and the acting is superb.
I:9805;483;The ensemble is as good as any I've seen.
I:9805;484;Phillip Seymour Hoffman as the lonely, uncool mentor is perfect.
I:9805;485;Billy Crudup as the soul of rock and roll is the best.
I:9805;486;This guy will win an Oscar someday though his looks are becoming a problem!
I:9805;487;Kudos to Cameron Crowe and his mother Alice.
I:9805;488;like band in the 70's, and a beautiful groupie.
I:9805;489;each person is faced with intense highs and terrible tragedies at the hands of the others throughout the story.
I:9805;490;a huge part of the movie is probably the soundtrack, a collection of original works and the best soaring rock of the 1970's.
I:9805;491;I really enjoyed this comedy.
I:9805;492;A good movie to relax and pop some popcorn.
I:9805;493;I new that it was destined to be a great movie and it was.
I:9805;494;But, I honestly was pleasantly shocked and surprised at just how wonderful this movie really was.
I:9805;495;i highly recommend the Bootleg Version for anyone who is a fan of the regular movie.
I:9805;496;The Bootleg Cut is a little pricey, but totally worth it.
I:9805;497;This movie is hilarious, heartwarming, nostalgic, and stylish.
I:9805;498;First off, the movie is wonderful.
I:9805;499;the movie has a gentle touch to it with a delightful love story and a fair amount of laughs.
I:9805;500;This is a fun package.
I:9805;501;This is a great movie, one of the best.
I:9805;502;Let me say that I'm glad I can finally say I've seen it, and what a wonderful experience it was.
I:9805;503;Penny is such a free spirit, and she's so devoted to the music she loves that you're instantly drawn to her.
I:9805;504;Billy Crudup also does well as the bands lead singer and Penny's crush, and Jason Lee is hilarious as the lead guitarist.
I:9805;505;As I'm sure all have read that this is a fictional tale based on Cameron Crowe's younger years as a reporter for Creem and Rolling Stone and so as the director Crowe makes sure that the film has those personal touches that lift it from sheer entertainment and create a realistic and homey feel throughout the film.
I:9805;506;I loved it, and I'm sure that everyone else will too.
I:9805;507;The film is just so happy and free you can't help but enjoy every minute of it.
I:9805;508;Almost Famous is one of the best films that I've seen in a long time.
I:9805;509;Cameron Crowe masterfully comes up with a semi.
I:9805;510;autobiographical story about a boy named William, who gets the ultimate chance of a lifetime: go on tour with a rising rock band, and write about it for Rolling Stone Magazine.
I:9805;511;On his adventure with the band (Stillwater), he meets people that change his life completely and help him come of age.
I:9805;512;The movie is funny and moving at the same time, and if you're a music freak, than I think that helps make the experience even better.
I:9805;513;Instead, the film creates something so much more extraordinary by remembering what it means to be a teenager, what it means to be on the cusp of fame, and what it means to fall in love.
I:9805;514;These are only three of the many themes that the movie takes time to delicately address in the most subtly moving 2 hours you'll ever spend at the theater.
I:9805;515;confident on the outside, inside he's just as much of a kid searching for himself as Patrick Fugit's William Miller is.
I:9805;516;Fugit's so good you almost forget he's even there until you realize that he's the one you've been identifying with.
I:9805;517;She calls herself a band aid, and that's exactly what she is.
I:9805;518;We see their public moments and their intimate moments and both seem to be just right.
I:9805;519;It's nice to have characters to care about again.
I:9805;520;The movie is magical without realizing it, incredibily perceptive without preaching and when you watch it something just makes you feel like you are home.
I:9805;521;Good music, excellent comedians, a few laughs.
I:9805;522;Nowadays, a former rock journalist can direct a movie involving his mother, his sister, his first love, his first sex night, his first paper, his intimate friends and his be cool attitude and show it to an admirative audience.
I:9805;523;Nothing deprives this movie of being one of the best in the past decade.
I:9805;524;The storyline gives the film the image of a fantasy.
I:9805;525;Billions of young teenagers dream about the day they tag along with their favorite band while they are on tour.
I:9805;526;This masterpiece also offers witty comedy that you will enjoy every now and then, giving the movie a lighthearted and believable touch.
I:9805;527;In addition, seeing the bands life beyond closed doors in this proved to be a lot more entertaining than VH1 specials.
I:9805;528;The ending is memorable and unexpected, to say the least.
I:9805;529;most of the acting performances were above average.
I:9805;530;Patrick Fugit brought about a great personality to his role.
I:9805;531;He was a peaceful, very smart music fan who endured an experience that made him change from being a starstruck kid to a professional journalist.
I:9805;532;Her character accomplishes nothing, as far as I am concerned.
I:9805;533;It still is a very engrossing and convincing documentary that really stands out when compared to other movies related to this subject matter.
I:9805;534;Cameron Crowe goes above and beyond here to show that the old adage is true, the best stories in life are the ones that actually happened.
I:9805;535;The pace of the movie flows much like many of the classic rock songs that play almost non.
I:9805;536;Everyone is perfectly cast here, with Billy Crudup proving he is worthy of a leading role and this movie MADE Kate Hudson the leading actress she is today.
I:9805;537;With the exception of one scene that drags on just a little too long (Plane Turbulence), the rest of the movie is generally flawless and I've yet to meet anyone who doesn't like this movie.
I:9805;538;Almost Famous is one of those rare movies that become enjoyed by all generations of people.
I:9805;539;It isn't a family movie, but the story is very interesting no matter who you are and what your age is (not to mention, it is based on actual events).
I:9805;540;It shows a common high school student at the time, with common likes and dislikes, and with dreams.
I:9805;541;depth with the detail to all of the rock stars lives.
I:9805;542;It shows the viewers that rock stars are human beings.
I:9805;543;The publicity of rock stars is displayed well.
I:9805;544;The lives of real rock stars from that time era seem to be very accurate with the movie.
I:9805;545;Patrick Fugit does a convincing performance as a starstruck 15 year old journalist major.
I:9805;546;He shows respect to everybody and is polite, but acts very emotionally.
I:9805;547;The movie is funny too and isn't all that explicit.
I:9805;548;It is about a rock band of the 70s, and the movie has talk about drugs and sex, but it is more informative than offensive.
I:9805;549;I now own it and must say it is well worth the price (if you like the movie, that is).
I:9805;550;I thoroughly enjoyed watching the 'Director's Cut' of the movie.
I:9805;551;you definitely get a lot more insight into some of the characters.
I:9805;552;The cast is great .
I:9805;553;I also really like Jason Lee's character, he's good for a lot of the movie's laughs.
I:9805;554;It's a great time period for me.
I:9805;555;Kate Hudson Should have won an Academy Award for her performance.
I:9805;556;This extended version is even better than the original.
I:9805;557;This is one of the best movies released in 2000.
I:9805;558;He takes certain events that occurred during each tour and gives it to the movie's band.
I:9805;559;Every piece of that fits perfectly amongst one another to create one masterpiece movie.
I:9805;560;It's great that Crowe can make some of those serious events and put some comedy in them.
I:9805;561;deserving of his Oscar win for Best Original Screenplay.
I:9805;562;patrick Fugit makes a triumphant debut as William Miller.
I:9805;563;If he continues to do movies in this style, he'll go far with his acting career.
I:9805;564;This is Billy Crudup and Jason Lee at their best as the lead guitarist and lead singer of Stillwater.
I:9805;565;"This is one of Paquin's best roles since her Oscar winning role(at the age of 11) in ""The Piano""."
I:9805;566;Almost Famous could be a huge influence for those who dream of making the big.
I:9805;567;There are many surprises so one will laugh unexpectedly in various parts.
I:9805;568;Anyone who grew up in the 70s and loved rock music will go to this film with an enormous amount of goodwill.
I:9805;569;Not only are the characters well written and wonderfully acted, but all the details are right as well.
I:9805;570;I want to see this film again just to watch the backgrounds and set direction.
I:9805;571;And there's a great scene on an airplane.
I:9805;572;love the scene where the whole tour bus starts singing to Tiny Dancer .
I:9805;573;the additional footage really makes this edition a must own.
I:9805;574;the commentary track is a riot with the director trading stories with his mother make this movie a joy to watch throughout.
I:9805;575;this is the definitive version of the film.
I:9805;576;it's all here for your viewing pleasure.
I:9805;577;"Heartfelt, touching, funny, and one of the best uses of rock and roll in motion picture history, from ""Pet Sounds"" under the bed to the Chipmunks and ""Oogum Boogum"" on the soundtrack."
I:9805;578;'Almost Famous' is as much about music as it is about growing up.
I:9805;579;It's about embracing what you love and finding the willingness to let go, to move on, to fit in.
I:9805;580;Cameron Crowe's first film since his smash hit 'Jerry Maguire', 'Almost Famous' is the story of young William Miller (newcomer Patrick Fugit), a music fan, who lies his way into his dream job: touring with a rock n roll band while composing an article about them for Rolling Stone Magazine.
I:9805;581;Along the way, William meets a group of 'band.
I:9805;582;groupies), one of which, a ravishing young girl named Penny Lane (played wit great charm by Kate Hudson) with whom he eventually grows to love.
I:9805;583;What transpires through the film is beautiful coming.
I:9805;584;age tale with humor and wit to burn.
I:9805;585;They will become your friends, your heroes, and you will cheer them on and weep for them.
I:9805;586;Such is the brilliant simplicity of Cameron Crowe who, as both writer and director, has fictionalized a portion of his own life to share with us.
I:9805;587;It's rare that a movie has the power to effects it's audience in a way this film does.
I:9805;588;Much like William, we are newcomers to the world he experiences.
I:9805;589;William's slow realization that these guys in Stillwater might be larger then life when they are on stage, but when they are not, they are just as vulnerable as we are and just as human, is pure magic.
I:9805;590;The members of the band include Billy Crudup as the charismatic guitarist whose good looks cast him in the limelight, Jason Lee as the lead singer whose desire for attention creates tension through.
I:9805;591;out the group, and real.
I:9805;592;Their music was written by Crowe's wife Nancy Wilson of the group 'Heart' and was actually performed by the actors themselves.
I:9805;593;And they are quite good, both musically and performance wise.
I:9805;594;Lee continues to show his versatility and Crudup delivers his second great performance of 2000, the other in the wonderfully skewed 'Jesus's Son'.
I:9805;595;This is the best film of 2000 and one you cannot afford to miss.
I:9805;596;I saw an advance screening of this film and I just can't say enough good things about it.
I:9805;597;as usual, Crowe's gotten a superb ensemble cast together.
I:9805;598;Philip Seymour Hoffman, Jason Lee, and Billy Crudup are predictably great, but the real joy is newcomer Patrick Fugit, whose winsome, innocent portrayal of a teen coming of age is pitch perfect.
I:9805;599;the plot is gripping and unpredictable.
I:9805;600;The subject matter is intimately familiar for anyone over the age of 25 or so, but younger folks will also identify with the characters' love for music.
I:9805;601;but the real strength, as with all of Crowe's work, is the *writing*.
I:9805;602;Good writing is rare in movies of any sort, particularly this summer's blockbuster sludge, but Crowe nails all the details of dialogue, characterization, and pacing with unparalleled skill.
I:9805;603;Every time he makes a film he renews my faith in the medium.
I:9805;604;i'm not one to gush over films, usually, but this touching, honest gem is worth losing the cynicism for a while.
I:9805;605;n. roll managers into some of the most interesting and fun.
I:9805;606;watch individuals ever to share a movie set together.
I:9805;607;add to this mix one very likeable.
I:9805;608;entertaining movie about ambition, music, a devoted mother's love, soul.
I:9805;609;every scene in this film is a memorable one.
I:9805;610;"The whole movie feels ""real"", in this writer's opinion."
I:9805;611;A reason for this, of course, is in large part due to the fact that the film is a great deal auto.
I:9805;612;"there are two scenes in this film that are true ""set pieces"" in my mind (and after just seeing the movie one time)."
I:9805;613;This fabulous scene is at the same time comical, bittersweet, and poignant.
I:9805;614;memorable portion of the film takes place on the band's tour bus.
I:9805;615;And the Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround soundtrack is definitely robust enough to give those speakers a nice workout, especially during the many musical numbers heard throughout the movie.
I:9805;616;"desirable environs that people of that ilk generally inhabit, let me assure you that ""Almost Famous"" will pleasantly surprise you."
I:9805;617;It's one that could easily be viewed time and again, and enjoyed just as much with each successive screening.
I:9805;618;"Very cool song, the chorus, ""My daddy was a Gibson, my mama was a Fender, that's why they call me, Mindbender."""
I:9805;619;I enjoyed this movie from the first time i saw it on video.
I:9805;620;it is a well acted film and well written film.
I:9805;621;old boy who loves rock and roll and gets to write articles for Rolling Stone magazine.
I:9805;622;talk about a cool job!
I:9805;623;and for anyone who loves Led Zeppelin or any other 70s rock band, this film is dedicated to you.
I:9805;624;Enter Fairuza Balk's Bio and press up on your remote.
I:9805;625;Hit enter and you will see a haunted take of Phillip Seymour Hoffman.
I:9805;626;Cute, warm and fuzzy movie.
I:9805;627;This movie reminds me of my college years.
I:9805;628;It makes me happy, it makes me sad !!
I:9805;629;"my life was saved by rock n' roll and if you love rock n' roll then ""Almost Famous"" will steal your heart."
I:9805;630;I've always loved rock'n'roll and the culture surrounding it.
I:9805;631;The characters all have heart and soul, no matter what their flaws.
I:9805;632;As a result this movie is always entertaining, at times hilarious, and sometimes heartbreaking!
I:9805;633;Every scene is excellent, all the main characters so fleshed out.
I:9805;634;If Oliver Stone had directed this movie, you KNOW Penny Lane (the lead band.
I:9805;635;Like the male characters, Penny is portrayed as a human being.
I:9805;636;All the actors are excellent.
I:9805;637;I especially loved Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of Lester Bangs, he really hit the nail on the head!
I:9805;638;The casting in this movie is perfect, as is the screenplay and direction!!!
I:9805;639;Letting the Music tell the story on the Bus scene was brilliant!
I:9805;640;I thought it was just so, so cute, and so touching and warm, even though I know it's only [my] rock and roll fantasy.
I:9805;641;I watched practically the whole thing with tears in my eyes, partially from nostalgia from the music and the clothes and the hair styles done so perfectly, and partly because the story of Penny Lane, sweet flower child groupie, seamstress for the band (to borrow a lyric) who has a rock and roll record to borrow another lyric (Great White, this time) who wears her sophistication on her sleeve to cover her heart that's also there.
I:9805;642;Kate Hudson (Goldie Hawn's daughter) is unforgettable in a completely original creation dreamed up (or better yet, probably remembered) by Crowe, who here improves on his fine directorial work in Jerry Maguire (1996).
I:9805;643;billy Crudup (a name to look at twice) manages to look exactly like all the wanna.
I:9805;644;Patrick Fugit is William Miller the would be teenaged writer as hero who is charming, boyish, vulnerable and well, heroic.
I:9805;645;the entire cast was terrific and the characters were truly original.
I:9805;646;The Academy Award winning script was clever and at times profound, interspersed with sparkling lines.
I:9805;647;Everything seemed amazingly authentic right down to the floral stitch on Russell's shirts and the bottles of Jack Daniels in his hands.
I:9805;648;I'm thinking in particular of Lester Bangs, mentor and cynical rock critic brought to life in a fine performance by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, and William's sweet and slightly dippy sister, vividly portrayed by Zooey Deschanel.
I:9805;649;Yes, I loved this film, and I predict that the Academy, whose members obviously did not really SEE this film, will be rewarding the producers sometime down the road for the oversight.
I:9805;650;Almost Famous is a great movie even if you don't like rock and roll.
I:9805;651;Patrick Fugit as William is great in his first role as are seasoned verterans like Billy Crudup and Kate Hudson.
I:9805;652;The direction by Crowe is very good and he is very well informed about the music.
I:9805;653;Gems like this only come from the pen of Cameron Crowe and while this is the type of movie that everyone will love, you'll feel the passion if you're in on the same music fan wavelength that Crowe is.
I:9805;654;"there are several touching scenes
I:9805;655;If you once were a struglling musician or unknown journalist, you will be thrilled by this movie.
I:9805;656;not to mention the charming Penny Lane and the amazing making of .
I:9805;657;and Cameron Crowe's articles to Rolling Stone magazine are a treat as well.
I:9805;658;can I give it 6 stars?
I:9805;659;then you'll understand exactly what this film is about!
I:9805;660;This movie, along with High Fidelity, is good to show to anyone who might wonder why music is the central focus of your life!
I:9805;661;Most people my age (33) stopped listening to and following music when they left high school, but this movie is genius in showing why music still matters and will always matter for myself.
I:9805;662;"Don't worry about the higher pricetag here
I:9805;663;This is one of the best movie ever in hollywood history.
I:9805;664;Kate Hudson is just wonderful.
I:9805;665;Watch this movie and you will see what I'm talking about.
I:9805;666;If you're only wanting the movie, this package is fine.
I:9805;667;Possibly my favorite movie of all time.
I:9805;668;It captures a time and culture but is made timeless by it's story of adolescence and family.
I:9805;669;I had high hopes for this movie.
I:9805;670;The acting was perfect, flawless.
I:9805;671;Each character was matched with an actor who captured the spirit to a 'T'.
I:9805;672;Jason Lee is in his best role ever, despite it being a seemingly small part.
I:9805;673;Billy Crudup is now in the running for my personal list of best actors.
I:9805;674;And of course, it was great to see the lovely Fairuza Balk return in another simply dazzling film.
I:9805;675;Even with the perfect cast a movie could still do badly, but Cameron Crowe added a beautiful script, and lastly, an extremely well done soundtrack that epitomizes the feeling of the movie.
I:9805;676;While the script is the actual star of the film, the cast is exceptional as an ensemble and every actor here is worth mentioning at least once.
I:9805;677;play and the situations that these fine actors find themselves in that propells the film forward.
I:9805;678;The script is so sharp, in fact, that many times during the movie I felt some of the actors had a hard time keeping up.
I:9805;679;written with such a huge cast as its centerpiece.
I:9805;680;He is notorious for his films having fantastic soundtracks.
I:9805;681;I have watched this movie many times and I always laugh and get carried away with the interesting lives of those on tour.
I:9805;682;This movie has great acting, an exceptional script, and another great soundtrack.
I:9805;683;This is a journey worth taking.
I:9805;684;Some really funny scenes and great actors too!
I:9805;685;The movie has a lot of sparkle and comedy to it, which makes it shine like no other film of this genre since Forrest Gump.
I:9805;686;The protagonist surrounded by all of this is William Miller, who lives with his mother and sister in San Diego.
I:9805;687;This sets up the coming stages of William's life: he finds his sister's collection of record albums, which his mother describes as the poetry of drugs and promiscuous sex, at which point the movie shoots ahead to his fifteenth year.
I:9805;688;n. role lifestyle, yet he is completely entranced by finally getting out and into the mix of it all, especially so close to the real action.
I:9805;689;Crowe is magnificent in bringing out his childish wonderment and awe, which will serve as the higher power for the rest of the film.
I:9805;690;His experiences with the band and their followers provide us with an in.
I:9805;691;depth look at the music as well as the complications and arguments that arise from its creation.
I:9805;692;William is thrown into a mix of things he has never experienced: drugs, sex, music, parties, screaming fans, to mention a few.
I:9805;693;Penny is involved with Russell Hammond, the member of the band most focused on by William as well as the movie, and her relationship with him goes against everything she claims that the Band Aids stand for ( Groupies sleep with rock stars because they want to be near someone famous.
I:9805;694;Penny and Russell's relationship will reveal something much fuller about both of their characters, as they come to terms with what they have experienced and what they really want in life.
I:9805;695;His journey from a protective mother to the wilds and thrills of the rock scene becomes an engaging trip for the audience.
I:9805;696;He still retains his values and moral beliefs, and he even picks up new ones along the way.
I:9805;697;everything about this movie is fun and entertaining.
I:9805;698;It's got lots of elements at work in it: there's lots of loud music that has meaning, there's a human story behind that music, there's a little bit of romance, themes about friendship, loyalty and trust.
I:9805;699;Everything here comes to life in this movie, whether it be the bright and airy attitudes embodied in the characters, or the delightful costumes and set pieces that bring the beginning of the 70's to life in vivid detail.
I:9805;700;There are bursts of comedy and deep thought that combine in bringing this era to life as well, keeping the movie entertaining and meaningful all at the same time.
I:9805;701;crowe also employs one of the best ensemble casts of 2000.
I:9805;702;Billy Crudup plays Russell Hammond deeply and with emotion, while Kate Hudson supplies cheeriness and bright wonderment to the movie.
I:9805;703;This is a dynamic collection of acting talent from all arenas, bringing a diversity and nostalgia to the movie that keeps it alive and frivolous.
I:9805;704;Almost Famous bubbles over with the sheer joy and happiness that the era was filled with, and it succeeds in bringing that joy to life.
I:9805;705;It tells an involving story about a boy who sees more than most were ever able to, giving us a unique view of a unique group of people.
I:9805;706;Its ideas are in the right place, as are its messages and elements.
I:9805;707;"I felt a great sense of exhilaration in watching this movie
I:9805;708;autobiographical ALMOST FAMOUS captures this extraordinary time, when rock bands and their groupies explored communal love and carnal desires in tour buses and flea.
I:9805;709;old William Miller (Patrick Fugit), a talented teen who gets a once.
I:9805;710;Stillwater is led by lead guitarist Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup is sensational), a mega.
I:9805;711;Yet the band is smart enough to allow William into their midst to befriend him.
I:9805;712;the interactions of the band, their fans, and William's eye.
I:9805;713;popping observations of all that transpire, are as believable as they are hysterical.
I:9805;714;The music is terrific, the interactions totally credible, and the comedy flaunts a distinct, hard edge.
I:9805;715;It is essentially a more detailed, slightly slower.
I:9805;716;paced, but richer version of the movie, where the magic moments take more time to unfold, the sense of reality is more firmly established, and the characters are better explored.
I:9805;717;Crowe richly deserved his Best Screenplay Oscar, as well .
I:9805;718;this movie contains magic moments aplenty, and the dialogue shifts effortlessly from the gloriously funny to the achingly heartfelt.
I:9805;719;testing, but still amusing sequence shot of Penny Lane .
I:9805;720;cameron Crowe's love of music has translated into cinematic form.
I:9805;721;And the feeling envelops us all.
I:9805;722;We are the better for it.
I:9805;723;Almost Famous has become my favorite movie, ever!
I:9805;724;I also enjoyed hearing more about Penny Lane from Cameron's own mouth.
I:9805;725;life girls he met while touring with bands.
I:9805;726;I would've loved to see pictures of these two ladies, heard them comment along with Cameron's mom.
I:9805;727;I loved watching the interview with real.
I:9805;728;Many of the cut scenes were good enough to be in the actual movie.
I:9805;729;Especially the hilarious Stillwater radio interview (what a whack job that DJ was!)
I:9805;730;, Penny and Russell alone at the Riot House, and Penny cutting the cake .
I:9805;731;The Stillwater concert is a great perk, especially Hour of Need , my favorite song by a band that doesn't exist!
I:9805;732;This is a wonderful movie with wonderful extras!
I:9805;733;I would recommend this movie for older people.
I:9805;734;Great movie of life in the 70s traveling with a rock and roll band.
I:9805;735;Some great music and a cute story line with a charming ending.
I:9805;736;perfect recreation of the rock music millieu before it had exhausted itself in excess in the middle to later 70's.
I:9805;737;Especially interesting is the examination of the range of participation that people have with music.
I:9805;738;it generates love to be shared between people.
I:9805;739;the characters and actors (great casting!)
I:9805;740;are all believable and, in the end, inspiring.
I:9805;741;The sex and drugs aspects are sanitized a bit, but then this is a love story with a relatively happy ending, not a tale of failed music.
I:9805;742;if you like the theatrical version and are interested in the autobiographical aspects in more detail, I highly recommend the director's cut.
I:9805;743;all true!Another interesting note from the director's cut is that Cameron is married to Nancy Wilson of Heart and they co. wrote the fictional Stillwater band's songs and she wrote other parts of the soundtrack as well.
I:9805;744;finally, In addition to the autobiographical richness, the director's cut adds insightful personal and relational depth to virutually every major character in the movie.
I:9805;745;unless you really dislike the aforementioned musical sources, I recommend you take a look at this movie as a cultural historical document, if nothing else.
I:9805;746;Watching the film probably helped bring back good memories, the way American Graffiti would to kids of the early 60's.
I:9805;747;The difference between those two films is that American Graffiti had deeper characters that you could identify with regardless of when you grew up.
I:9805;748;i think people were so hungry for a halfway decent film last year that they globbed onto this one as brilliant just because of what it was based upon.
I:9805;749;Spinal Tap and Woodstock are the greatest rock and roll films ever, because they already know music is something special, while Almost Famous spends all of its time trying to tell you the obvious.
I:9805;750;autobiographical movie about the 1970s rock scene, gives a glimpse of the life of a young reporter (based on Crowe himself).
I:9805;751;Almost Famous is a fantastic mixture of expose and tribute .
I:9805;752;there's music, there's romance, there's comedy.
I:9805;753;romance between Penny and William is very sweet, rooted in genuine affection.
I:9805;754;"The dialogue sparkles (""Last words: I dig music."
I:9805;755;"many men have gone before""), and the direction is superb ."
I:9805;756;pumping scene actually contain an element of romance.
I:9805;757;patrick Fugit is a surprisingly solid lead, with a sort of wide.
I:9805;758;eyed innocence that contrasts sharply with everyone else.
I:9805;759;is one of the best lines in the movie.
I:9805;760;"music lovers and rock aficionados will love ""Almost Famous,"" a bittersweet coming."
I:9805;761;If you love music, if you love actors, if yo ulove movies.
I:9805;762;I love old Heart music.
I:9805;763;Miller, played so perfectly and brilliantly by Patrick Fugit, wants to be a rock journalist much to the chagrin of his mother.
I:9805;764;She was also excellent in this movie, and definitely deserves her Oscar nomination.
I:9805;765;Speaking of Oscar, Kate Hudson, who is also nominated in the same category, Best Supporting Actress, is also great in the movie.
I:9805;766;She plays Penny Lane, a groupie.
I:9805;767;She would rather be around famous people cuz they are more interesting.
I:9805;768;He is to go on the road with a band and write a fantastic article about his journey with the band Stillwater.
I:9805;769;There are a few songs you won't recognize, but you will know who's singing.
I:9805;770;I actually originally wanted to see this movie because Billy Crudup, who I admire as an actor and just like to look at, was in it.
I:9805;771;I also wanted to see it because it was the latest Cameron Crowe flick as I have loved most of the films he has done: Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Say Anything, Singles.
I:9805;772;I consider Almost Famous to be one of the best films of the year 2000.
I:9805;773;I just love this movie.
I:9805;774;Patrick Fuget is superb as a naive, innocent yet brilliant young man trying to break into the crazy world of rock journalism.
I:9805;775;i have always enjoyed Cameron Crowe's movies, but in my opinion nothing he has done before or since has approached the brilliance of this, his life story.
I:9805;776;This is in my top ten.
I:9805;777;If you haven't seen this yet, take the plunge, watch more filmmaking that crosses the threshold from simply a movie, to a journey.
I:9805;778;that my fine friend, that in all its joyous craft and benevolence is what Almost Famous is to me.
I:9805;779;A journey of the heart, a journey of the soul and a journey of a boy and a dream and the perservarance to give it all he could.
I:9805;780;Truly something that finally deserves 5 stars in my book.
I:9805;781;Cameron Crowe is a powerhouse with this motherload!So grab a handful of this and run with it, it deserves a place in your heart as well.
I:9805;782;Would recommend it to anyone of any age!
I:9805;783;In the beginning, you meet his overbearing but well meaning mother, who surprisingly enough allows him to tour with Stillwater.
I:9805;784;Miller meets his favorite rock critic, Lester Bangs, and Bangs has Miller writing for Bangs's magazine, Creem.
I:9805;785;The next thing Miller knows, Rolling Stone wants him to write for them!
I:9805;786;That's how Miller ends up on the road with Stillwater and the wonderful Penny Lane (Kate Hudson).
I:9805;787;The music is great, and if you like the movie, pick up the soundtrack as well.
I:9805;788;The characters are wonderfully constructed and easy to identify with, the movie is darkly hilarious, everything about it is great.
I:9805;789;There's about a half hour added onto to movie and it's all worthwhile and meaningful.
I:9805;790;And in case you're watching it with people with shorter attention spans, it comes with the original version as well.
I:9805;791;It is classic from start to finish!!
I:9805;792;Great story line that never stalls, the music is every great song you ever heard.
I:9805;793;This is the one you'll want to own and watch over and over again.
I:9805;794;with the volume on 100 so you can sing along
I:9805;795;The story is effortless, the characters are strong, and the music transports you to the decade of the early seventies.
I:9805;796;Spot on casting also makes this one of my top ten movies all time.
I:9805;797;despite a few annoying moments, the movie is an absolute gem.
I:9805;798;I love the understated simplicity of so many of the performances.
I:9805;799;there are some incredible moments!
I:9805;800;I so want to go into that world right now.
I:9805;801;it spoon feeds the plot to you
I:9805;802;Definitely a hit for us on movie night.
I:9805;803;good movie of 2000 and luckily it escapes that sticky.
I:9805;804;"That his mother lets him go on tour with the band ""Stillwater"" to get his story is surprising enough (she thinks rock n roll is evil and that all musicians are on drugs)."
I:9805;805;Fugit, in his first role, plays William with an honesty that is essential to the character's success.
I:9805;806;eyed and curious and completely star.
I:9805;807;going performance that he makes it look simple) and considers him and the band his friends.
I:9805;808;But William, just a kid, can't help but get pulled in.
I:9805;809;also capturing William's attention is the beautiful Penny Lane, a Stillwater groupie and Russell's on.
I:9805;810;"Hudson's performance is stunning
I:9805;811;She gives Lane a softness and vulnerability without losing the character's edge.
I:9805;812;Fugit shows us this growing love with right.
I:9805;813;In fact, his face gives away most of what his character is feeling all of the time, often in the absence of words or actions to help tell his story.
I:9805;814;We're proud of William at the end.
I:9805;815;One is William's sister, Anita, played by Zooey Deschanel.
I:9805;816;She's a rebelious teen who moves out when she turns 18 to live with her boyfriend, and who decides to become a stewardess.
I:9805;817;the movie's ending is also a bit of a disappoitment.
I:9805;818;Still, it's a minor point in a movie that does so much so well.
I:9805;819;This is one of the best movies I've seen in years.
I:9805;820;It brought back faces and places I hadn't thought about in 30 years.
I:9805;821;"cool, rock star worshipping 15 year old, ""William""."
I:9805;822;It is also a beautiful coming of age story.
I:9805;823;I had never seen Kate Hudson before, but from the moment she enters her first scene, you'll be enamored of her beauty, screen prescence, and obvious intelligence beyond her years.
I:9805;824;"How perfect that, in ""real"" life, he got his own rock goddess, in marrying Nancy Wilson, of the fabulous ""Heart""."
I:9805;825;Dreams really can come true.
I:9805;826;There's really so much to say about this great film, so, just SEE it.
I:9805;827;I've seen this about 4 times now, and loved it more at each viewing.
I:9805;828;So, enjoy one of the best movies made in 2000 (or in many a year.)
I:9805;829;I thought this film was original, well.
I:9805;830;This film is packed with great actors but they starred in this film before they got big.
I:9805;831;I'm a huge fan of coming of age stories and this one did not disappoint.
I:9805;832;Almost Famous was a good, enjoyable movie.
I:9805;833;and found much of the story to be quite sweet.
I:9805;834;goldie Hawn shines through her daughter's smile.
I:9805;835;It was really nice to see the talent and beauty passed on.
I:9805;836;He is particularly insightful when he is writing from his own experiences.
I:9805;837;The result was an honest and genuine high school flick that was too real to be fiction.
I:9805;838;Though the band and the most of the people in this film are fictitious, many of the situations are based on real events and the characters are composites of real people.
I:9805;839;Tap was a spoof documentary with its tongue firmly in cheek.
I:9805;840;AF is raw and real with a believable plot (except perhaps the silly airplane confession scene) and affecting characters.
I:9805;841;Crowe went to great lengths to capture the rock scene precisely, sending the actors to band camp to get them to the point where they could actually perform.
I:9805;842;Nancy Wilson and Peter Frampton wrote most of the band's original music to give the songs an authentic sound.
I:9805;843;Though the pacing of the film is a bit uneven, dragging at times, his ability to depict the feelings of the time through the performances of the actors is superb.
I:9805;844;the acting by the ensemble cast is outstanding.
I:9805;845;In keeping with the theme of the film, most of the actors are bright young talents who are almost famous.
I:9805;846;Crudup's performance as the self.
I:9805;847;absorbed and brilliant guitarist who holds the band together is first rate.
I:9805;848;in a cast replete with fine performances, Kate Hudson stands out, giving a brilliant presentation of Penny Lane.
I:9805;849;She brings enormous emotional power to a very demanding role that ranges from effervescent to suicidal.
I:9805;850;Newcomer Patrick Fugit finds the right balance between nerdy and wise as William.
I:9805;851;Jason Lee is wonderfully turbulent as the temperamental lead singer.
I:9805;852;this film is a winner.
I:9805;853;By capturing the emotions rather than just a series of rock events, it takes us behind the scenes of the rock revolution in a way that no documentary ever has.
I:9805;854;It is necessary viewing for rock fans young and old.
I:9805;855;I got this director's cut edition because I so was so intrigued by the original theatrical release.
I:9805;856;In fact, a BETTER film I would have to say.
I:9805;857;Pure nostalgia of the highest order!
I:9805;858;Plus some really great music.
I:9805;859;In the past 18 months I have seen two films which I absolutely adore.
I:9805;860;kate Hudson is remarkably talented.
I:9805;861;Her charisma and talent just oozed out of that screen.
I:9805;862;She never ceases to amaze me.
I:9805;863;I've seen this three times now, and it just keeps getting better.
I:9805;864;keep up the good work, Cameron Crowe!
I:9805;865;It was well worth the cost.
I:9805;866;layered account of a family where the children are in the process of leaving the nest.
I:9805;867;It's a coming of age time and the main story concerns the son who gets tied up with a tour of Stillwater, a rising band in need of good press.
I:9805;868;It's a fun story, and very well put together.
I:9805;869;If you've ever wondered what it might be like to be on the inside of a rock 'n' roll tour, well, this is probably as close as most of you will ever get.
I:9805;870;the movie is well put together.
I:9805;871;"The soundtrack is a wonderful rock and roll collage that would fall into the ""oldies but goodies"" category."
I:9805;872;The flow of the story is quite good.
I:9805;873;The acting is well done and I especially appreciated Kate Hudson, one of the tender young Band Aides.
I:9805;874;It's a fun and uplifting movie.
I:9805;875;If you like rock and roll, you should love this one.
I:9805;876;Be sure to look over the included extra materials as they add a lot to the telling of the story.
I:9805;877;what I love about the movie, besides its gentle humour, its superb choice of music and uplifting theme, is that the characters are so fully rendered that there is so much going on in each scene.
I:9805;878;I'm happy to let my ten.year.
I:9805;879;(I'm using it mainly as a covert means of getting her to appreciate the 70s music that I enjoy so much!)
I:9805;880;Lester Bangs makes an excellent mentor in this movie .
I:9805;881;far more wisdom spews from his lips than say, William's Mum's.
I:9805;882;Setting the climax in an aircraft poised on the brink of crashing in an electrical storm was a brilliant stroke.
I:9805;883;the choice of songs for the movie was excellent.
I:9805;884;Camercon Crowe chose the high.
I:9805;885;Even the Cat Stevens' track ('The Wind') was a revelation which has considerably increased the respect I have for the artist.
I:9805;886;My appreciation of Led Zep's acoustic numbers and even Simon Garfunkel has also improved as a result of Crowe's highly intelligent juxtaposition of sound and vision.
I:9805;887;(There I go sounding like William's Mum!)
I:9805;888;Many thanks, Cameron, for making this excellent tribute to the period.
I:9805;889;This is a awesome movie.
I:9805;890;I love the music and the it is very funny.
I:9805;891;I'm a big fan of all things 1970s, and am into a lot of rock bands from that era (Yes, Genesis, Jethro Tull, Pink Floyd, etc, etc, etc).
I:9805;892;Being born in the 1980s, I can't say whether this was an accurate potrait of the music scene back then, but I certainly found it interesting.
I:9805;893;william Miller (Patrick Fugit) is a clever kid, so clever he's been skipped ahead two grades.
I:9805;894;He likes to write, it seems, and he loves rock music and the scene that surrounds it.
I:9805;895;He wants to become a rock journalist, so he finds a local writer, who gives him a few pointers, and his first job .
I:9805;896;William writes his article, and it goes down really well.
I:9805;897;"He's underage, and has lots of exams to do at school, but with a deep voice over the phone and the help of a ""band."
I:9805;898;On the tour he sees the ups, the downs, the dirty and the cleaned up.
I:9805;899;That's a lot of points of view, and they're all handled thoughtfully, I thought.
I:9805;900;I like the look of the sets and the locations.
I:9805;901;The young extras are a nice touch too.
I:9805;902;The music playing in the background really helped set the scene, I felt.
I:9805;903;It's always nice when a good film has a good soundtrack.
I:9805;904;if you're interested in 1970s music, this film is definitely worth a look.
I:9805;905;Love the story line and natural transition.
I:9805;906;Characters well developed and interact well.
I:9805;907;Great depiction of the time era.
I:9805;908;He is just a good writer who happens to be underaged.
I:9805;909;1973 was the golden age of rock n roll as many styles of music were still considered cool.
I:9805;910;~This has got to be The BEST film I have senn in all time.
I:9805;911;Kate Hudson as Penny Lane, literally shines in every scene.
I:9805;912;His article earns the mature.
I:9805;913;almost Famous constructs its plot with effective time constraints which create suspense and establish the film's sense of humor.
I:9805;914;Both the editor and the mother, who require that William constantly check back with them and who impose deadlines (to submit the article outline or to return home), communicate with the protagonist via the phone throughout most of the film.
I:9805;915;The comedy rises from William's efforts to be seen as a free adult .
I:9805;916;a status the band members claim to have reached.
I:9805;917;A good movie about rock, Almost Famous is also one of Cameron Crowe`s best efforts to date.
I:9805;918;Billy Crudup and Kate Hudson shine as the young, innocent and passionate teen couple who is discovering life through music and must face a new and complex world that forces them to make hard choices.
I:9805;919;Almost Famous is clearly a labour of love, since everyone seems to be enjoying what they`re doing, and the fact that some elements are based on Cameron Crowe`s experiences also helps.
I:9805;920;Enjoyable and bittersweet, offering strong acting, direction and music, this movie is a worthwile cinematic experience that doesn`t quite change the world but makes it look like a better place.
I:9805;921;The character that Crowe based on himself is William Miller (well played by Patrick Fugit).
I:9805;922;Bangs tells William to write an interview for Cream Magazine.
I:9805;923;William is befriended by groupie Penny Lane (Kate Hudson, who deservedly won a Golden Globe and an Oscar nomination), whose boyfriend is the band's lead guitarist (Billy Crudup).
I:9805;924;What follows is William's sometimes funny and sometimes painful experiences with life on the road.
I:9805;925;As Lester observes: They made you feel cool.
I:9805;926;These situations are all observed with a lot of heart and soul in Cameron Crowe's Oscar winning script.
I:9805;927;The second disc includes the original film.
I:9805;928;"The package also gives you commentary by Crowe and his mother Alice
I:9805;929;Almost Famous is one of my favorite movies in recent years.
I:9805;930;The story makes you laugh and cry, the characters are all three dimensional, the cast is absolutley extraordinary.
I:9805;931;This zany road trip captures all the essence of the period but doesn't stop there.
I:9805;932;This is a classy little film by Cameron Crowe that deserves to be up there with the best of the year.
I:9805;933;Bravo to all for this sensitive, feel good movie.
I:9805;934;and I hope there are more to come from this crew!
I:9805;935;I originally saw this film in the theatre, and after having bought this particular package, I have to say it's a much better movie with the extra footage.
I:9805;936;Oh, did I mention the performances?From top to bottom, everything about this movie is perfect.
I:9805;937;Cameron Crowe seemingly goes from strength to strength, and this film represents the pinnacle of his life as a filmmaker.
I:9805;938;Hopefully she'll get more dramatic parts, but I have a feeling this will be the crowning gem in her career.
I:9805;939;She's absolutely luminous, and has you alternately saddened and infatuated at various times throughout the movie.
I:9805;940;This movie is so good it hurts.
I:9805;941;anyway, the acting is flawless!
I:9805;942;Of course there is my favorite actor, Jason Lee, who was born to be a rock star, (not a mallrat!)
I:9805;943;Patrick Fugit is just great for the character he plays, Billy Crudup is fantastic, and needless to say Kate Hudson is astonishing.
I:9805;944;She's so alive throughout the whole movie, and is just.
I:9805;945;The Tiny Dancer scene is so good that it makes me cry.
I:9805;946;Of course, the soundtrack is fantastic, i bought it right away.
I:9805;947;In closing: For me, this is, and will always be, my favorite movie of all time, but maybe that's just because I can relate so much to it.
I:9805;948;The guy who plays Cameron Crowe's alias, William Miller, is brilliant.
I:9805;949;The soundtrack is perfect and the extra scenes add so much.
I:9805;950;I never get tired of watching this movie, and the other thing I really enjoyed on this version was the commentary from Cameron Crowe and his mother, Alice, which provides a very interesting angle.
I:9805;951;Some great lines, and the way they created a group for this movie, Stillwater, was a major feat in itself.
I:9805;952;Anyone who loves early 70s rock music will love this movie.
I:9805;953;one) Phillip Seymour Hoffman is one of the best actors on screen today and I wished he would've been in it more.
I:9805;954;This one has Awesome characters, but deals around 70's rock music.
I:9805;955;Kate Hudson was outstanding and so was the kid.
I:9805;956;I loved seeing Jason Lee in something other than a NEW JERSEY film, too.
I:9805;957;if you love 70's rock music then disregard the 4 stars and give it 5!
I:9805;958;I've always been a fan of Cameron Crowe's work (Fast Times, Say Anything, Singles, Jerry Maguire) but this film is his masterpiece.
I:9805;959;Warm, sympathetic characters, a amazing soundtrack, perfect pacing .
I:9805;960;Patrick Fugit delivers an astounding performance (made more so by the fact that he's a newcomer to major motion pictures), conveying a blend of naivete and enthusiasm that makes his character utterly believable.
I:9805;961;Kate Hudson portrays the intricate and subtle emotions of her character with ease and considerable skill, and rightly deserves her various nominations.
I:9805;962;And Phillip Seymour Hoffman is excellent as always as William's mentor Lester Bangs.
I:9805;963;Far and away one of the best movies in recent years, an instant classic.
I:9805;964;Best watched with a breeze flowing through your window and a bag of Fritos!
I:9805;965;Almost Famous is a perfect movie.
I:9805;966;This is a very bold statement, I know.
I:9805;967;Crowe has an amazing ability to give his characters down to earth personalities.
I:9805;968;kate Hudson, Bully Crudup, Patrick Fugit and all the actors were perfectly cast.
I:9805;969;She handled the character of Penny Lane like a pro.
I:9805;970;Her facial expressions, the ways she moved and positioned her hands, and her laugh, made Penny Lane seem like an innocent yet mysterious and experienced groupie.
I:9805;971;Even though the part was small, Fairuza's Sapphire was a great addition to the film.
I:9805;972;I love the scene in which William's Mother called the hotel and Sapphire spoke of what a great boy William was.
I:9805;973;Fairuza seems like an old soul, perfect to play a groupie from the 70's.
I:9805;974;She reminds me of my Mother's old hippy friends from when I was a kid.
I:9805;975;written, the acting is almost uniformly excellent, the cinematography is really sharp, etc.
I:9805;976;But let's face it, what really makes this movie is the music.
I:9805;977;He is able to capture every emotion and display it in the most subtle of moments.
I:9805;978;Great package of the best movie ever about rock music.
I:9805;979;It's almost unfair when Cameron Crowe simply shoots album covers from thirty years ago, and you suddenly are reminded how important the music was, and how much fun those days were.
I:9805;980;In other words, a nostalgia flick, but a very charming one.
I:9805;981;This is a warm, fuzzy memory to dream on.
I:9805;982;Great film that is timeless.
I:9805;983;Great film that almost anyone can enjoy regardless of taste.
I:9805;984;and the girls who loved them.
I:9805;985;And in Almost Famous, William Miller shows us the things that the Oscar.
I:9805;986;The struggle, the patched together nature of scratching at the ceiling of success, the business that is necessary and the glory of that moment of breaking through are all here, as well as misassigned loves, romances that're more about the moment than the heart and how one great romantic's broken heart causes a reckoning for the hero, the writer and the girl herself.
I:9805;987;some of the greatest lines about life and rock and roll ever delivered.
I:9805;988;Fun and good hearted and nostalgic!
I:9805;989;I grew up in the 60/70's and played in a band for 6 years.
I:9805;990;The movie brought back a lot of great memories of that era, especially the days in the band.
I:9805;991;Cameron Crowe did a great job bringing his story to life.
I:9805;992;I feel that there is a little bit of William in all of us, wanting to experience new things and meeting famous people.
I:9805;993;The soundtrack was equally enjoyable.
I:9805;994;This movie is definitely a must own for the baby boomer generation and for the younger generations to experience a unique time in life.
I:9805;995;Great movie, open your eyes see new way of life.
I:9805;996;Great music and able to see how rockstars lived in a world back then.
I:9805;997;Thirty of the 35 minutes of newmaterial was great stuff.
I:9805;998;"Thereare lots of new music references for the classic rock fan
I:9805;999;round, you'll really love this set.
I:9805;1000;This movie has EVERYTHING: a fantastic cast, great dialogue, an incredibly interesting plot, plot twists, a soundtrack to die for and much more.
I:9805;1001;Patrick Fugit is William Miller who, while still in high school, gets the chance to write a piece on a band on the brink of success for ROLLING STONE MAGAZINE!
I:9805;1002;William meets an utterly charming, beautiful groupie, Penny Lane (Kate Hudson) who steals every scene she is in.
I:9805;1003;Phillip Seymour Hoffman is wonderful.
I:9805;1004;Billy Crudup and Jason Lee are amazing as band members.
I:9805;1005;You HAVE to see it!
I:9805;1006;i looked forward to seeing this movie for a week and finally today i saw it with two of my friends.
I:9805;1007;let me tell you we all luved it.
I:9805;1008;it was such a great movie and it was so real and all the characters were played so well.
I:9805;1009;my friend even cried as did i and she admitted that she was happy that she came to see it.
I:9805;1010;i though william was a greatly acted character adn i could totally relate to hiim because i saw part of myself in him and so i recommend that everyone go out and see this movie it'll touch you, move you, and make you laugh and take you on a wonderful journey.
I:9805;1011;this movie is so good.
I:9805;1012;Everything about Almost Famous is perfect.
I:9805;1013;Watch this and you'll never know how you got along without it.
I:9805;1014;"This movie was fun and well scripted
I:9805;1015;I have few perfect movies in my collection and this is one of the rare ones.
I:9805;1016;Probably due to the fact that I grew up during the time period in question (1973.)
I:9805;1017;The story revolves around a young teenager's passion for music and writing and the behind.
I:9805;1018;scenes dynamics of his family.
I:9805;1019;Kate Hudson made for a memorable Penny Lane, Phillip Seymour Hoffman hit it out.
I:9805;1020;Although now divorced, Mr. Crowe's then wife, Nancy Wilson, helped with the musical score, which makes me one degree from Cameron.
I:9805;1021;In 1978, I sat in on our station's interview with Heart.
I:9805;1022;it that all she could do was chortle in that high.
I:9805;1023;it invoked a lot of nostalgia on my part because I identified with Patrick Fugit's character growing up.
I:9805;1024;I was so immersed in the movie that it didn't matter.
I:9805;1025;This movie was very entertaining.
I:9805;1026;Kate Hudson is a very beautiful and amazingly gifted actress, and I hope to see Patrick Fugit in some more movies after this.
I:9805;1027;The characters are so engaging.
I:9805;1028;Love seeing the fun costumes.
I:9805;1029;This movie is fits in every genre possible without it being a complete mess, and it works so perfectly.
I:9805;1030;THe story, which centers around a 15 year old who writes for Rolling Stone, is very interesting, and even more intriguing when you know that this story is based on the Director's life.
I:9805;1031;The music is way cool, and captures the era well.
I:9805;1032;Billy Crudup is great as the guitarist/star of the ficticious band: Stillwater.
I:9805;1033;There's also a cool Stillwater video.
I:9805;1034;It was great, along the the fabulous perfomances from every characters.
I:9805;1035;i fell in love with this movie, and maybe most of you will as well.
I:9805;1036;In the year 2000 a number of fabulous films were made.
I:9805;1037;"'Traffic, Gladiator, and the film that came from nowhere
I:9805;1038;As our young protagonist William ventures around the country with a up, and coming rock band 'Stillwater' The film is essentially a comedy, but has moments of drama and romance ribboned through it's highly lucid and entertaining storyline.
I:9805;1039;the performances in 'Almost Famous' are flawless leading the charge with brilliant performances by Billy Crudup and Kate Hudson the film can appeal to a variety of age levels and lovers of the era.
I:9805;1040;through Crowe's masterful directing the audience are subjected to a wild ride of sex, drugs and rock and roll.
I:9805;1041;The viewer can experience what life is like in the late 60's and how each of us deals with fame.
I:9805;1042;A tour de force soundtrack again allows the audience to feel this lifestyle.
I:9805;1043;overall the film is an utter triumph, one that is unsurpassed in scope and vision.
I:9805;1044;In a year that was dominated by 'Gladiator' which was a genre peice it was great to see a big film with a 'small film' feel.
I:9805;1045;It's multiplicity of genres to allow the film to convey this feeling.
I:9805;1046;It is tasteful and true to point
I:9805;1047;I knew that it was getting great reviews, especially acting wise, but I passed on it.
I:9805;1048;After seeing Kate Hudson win several awards, including the Golden Globe, and then get a nomination got me interested.
I:9805;1049;I love Goldie Hawn, and Kate is a whole new version of her.
I:9805;1050;I was hooked right from the begining.
I:9805;1051;Immediately I loved this character, and completely forgot she was Goldie Hawn's daughter.
I:9805;1052;She was sweet, loving, and probably the most loved character in the show.
I:9805;1053;The boy was great, and Billy Crudup was wow!
I:9805;1054;She showcased this great person, yet when she gets her heartbroken which almost ends in tragedy, I felt myself litterally praying for this character.
I:9805;1055;Cameron Crowe has created one of the best films ever.
I:9805;1056;As soon as this movie hits a more reasonalbe price, well, I'm adding it as fast as I can to the collection.
I:9805;1057;Furthermore, Kate has gained herself a new fan, and this is because of her acting skills and her exceptional performance, not because she is Goldie's daughter.
I:9805;1058;But then I thought, look at it this way, this is technically her fourth film in which she is a lead, and in only four films she gets that kind of recognition, and in only two years.
I:9805;1059;You can read other reviews for the details, just chalk me up as happy I bought it.
I:9805;1060;If you light a candle and listen to Tommy, you'll see your future .
I:9805;1061;Of course there are a few funny moments.
I:9805;1062;"
I:9805;1063;live among the stars and fall in love with Penny Lane.
I:9805;1064;humor, tears, and hey even a happy ending.
I:9805;1065;just a great movie for anyone who loves music.
I:9805;1066;drumming to stairway to heaven is absolutely hysterical.
I:9805;1067;something, Crowe does what we all do at that stage.
I:9805;1068;He looks backwards, with longing.
I:9805;1069;And so, in ALMOST FAMOUS, he offers us a loving reflection on his youth and the music that lit the way.
I:9805;1070;he makes us nostalgic for the 70s.
I:9805;1071;Somehow, thanks to Crowe, the era has taken on that burnished glow that only memory can endow.
I:9805;1072;crowe starts his film with credits.
I:9805;1073;The credits have not even finished and I already love this movie.
I:9805;1074;This is a personal story being told by somebody.
I:9805;1075;And a young somebody, to boot.
I:9805;1076;If the credits are this good, what will the movie be like, I wonder.
I:9805;1077;It is that period of his life that provides the basis for the movie's plot.
I:9805;1078;He is befriended by the burned.
I:9805;1079;out editor of Creem Magazine, Lester Bangs, brilliantly played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman.
I:9805;1080;be, ranting that `Rock is dead' and providing other such heartening insights, while also giving him a willing ear and an encouraging word.
I:9805;1081;Though based on an actual figure, Hoffman's Les Bangs is an original film creation.
I:9805;1082;Upon boarding the tour bus, young William/Cameron journeys like Dante into the inferno.
I:9805;1083;one of his Virgils is the band's enigmatic guitarist, Russell, brought to vivid life in actor Billy Crudup's breakthrough performance as the Rock n Roll hero with feet of clay.
I:9805;1084;The other is the siren Penny Lane, the beautiful free spirit who, as a `band.
I:9805;1085;Kate Hudson's Penny Lane is a magical character, and it's a star.
I:9805;1086;making performance, worthy of her Oscar.
I:9805;1087;Like his earlier films, music is the heart and soul of this film, both in the dramatic moments and concert scenes, dramatizing the effect on both the players and the audience as together they create, for a moment, a surrogate family for all who need one.
I:9805;1088;He makes movies about life.
I:9805;1089;And so, he tells stories about us.
I:9805;1090;They are stories worth telling and he tells them wonderfully well.
I:9805;1091;Like all of Crowe's other films, ALMOST FAMOUS is a tale both personal and universal.
I:9805;1092;That's the power of a great storyteller and, make no mistake, Crowe is perhaps the foremost auteur of his generation.
I:9805;1093;This may be my favorite movie of all time.
I:9805;1094;Somewhere in all of us we want to be a rock star with crowds groupies and airplanes and all that goes with it.
I:9805;1095;Watching William chronicle it is really fun.
I:9805;1096;Having been involved in the music industry at the time I can tell you that the story though fiction is pretty close to what really happened.
I:9805;1097;If it weren't for Jason Lee (who does and outstanding job given his under developed character) I would have given it a 2.
I:9805;1098;the story is based around a young boy with a gift for writting, he teams up with a band grows up a bit along the way.
I:9805;1099;the actors are good, but I believe a few were cast for the wrong parts.
I:9805;1100;Portrays the time era perfectly and superb acting!
I:9805;1101;I've loved it since I first saw it in high school
I:9805;1102;First, this is an excellent film.
I:9805;1103;Second, it's an authentic portrayal of life in the early 70s, the rock band culture, and growing up during that period .
I:9805;1104;I was in a rock band, and I saw myself and the people I knew at every turn.
I:9805;1105;This film is a work of art.
I:9805;1106;I liked 'Almost Famous' a lot when it came out in the theater.
I:9805;1107;tripping DJ and enough extras to keep you entertained for an entire sick day .
I:9805;1108;If you like good '70s.
I:9805;1109;era rock music (Allman Bros., Led Zep, The Who, Elton John), this is definitely worth checking out.
I:9805;1110;true autobiography of rock n roll writer Cameron Crowe.
I:9805;1111;great story, great acting and TOTALLY AWESOME MUSIC make this a must see for anyone who loves classic rock.5 out 5 stars.
I:9805;1112;Patrick Fugit is perfectly cast ( and could pass for a young Crowe) as William, with all the emotions and insecurities of a typical 15 year old boy.
I:9805;1113;kate Hudson is extraordinary as groupie Penny Lane,sensitive yet all knowing.
I:9805;1114;beat, eccentric, yet loving mother with her usual zeal.
I:9805;1115;this film is a great reminder for all us kids who grew up on 70s rock.
I:9805;1116;Stillwater , the fictitious band dramatized in the film, is a perfect amalgamation of Zeppelin, with touches of other 70s greats (Foghat?)
I:9805;1117;"Don't get me wrong
I:9805;1118;I thought it was the best film of 2000.
I:9805;1119;of special, and Crowe's original RS articles.
I:9805;1120;great acting, a clever and original story, and many quirky characters that you can't help but love.
I:9805;1121;great movies need great moments that grab you as they happen, and this one has several.
I:9805;1122;For example, listen for Elton John's song Tiny Dancer and savor the moments that accompany it.
I:9805;1123;Another great moment occurs near the end of the movie.
I:9805;1124;and this one is really great.
I:9805;1125;You can see it in his face, and live the moment with him, as emotions flow from anticipation, to confusion, bewilderment, dawning realization, awe.
I:9805;1126;i suspect the movie works so well because it was based on the actual experiences of Writer/Director Cameron Crowe as a music reporter.
I:9805;1127;The music tract by his wife, Nancy Wilson (member of the band 'Heart'), certainly helps the experience along.
I:9805;1128;As a writer I've come along way, and I know how difficult it can be working on a subject that is as dangerous as Rock and Roll, and learning how music is life and love.
I:9805;1129;This film was great, I took a dull Sunday afternoon to watch this movie and I was entertained.
I:9805;1130;This film is good on many levels.
I:9805;1131;He believes he is cool because that is how the band makes him feel.
I:9805;1132;His mentor helps him come to the realization.
I:9805;1133;off land, she realizes that she must move on.
I:9805;1134;on the next level, the rock band, Stillwater, is the quintessential band coming at the end of a generation of musicians.
I:9805;1135;The idealized notions they have will hit the wall once they hear of the article on them.
I:9805;1136;Afterwards, they must mature to continue.
I:9805;1137;this is a fine movie, and I would highly recommend seeing it.
I:9805;1138;It is witty and serious at the same time.
I:9805;1139;This won't be to everyone's taste but it's an affectionate nod to the pop scene of the early seventies which by today's standards seems like classical!
I:9805;1140;Fans of the era will love it and will particulary enjoy the outstanding soundtrack which really does stand out.
I:9805;1141;I get the feeling this was a labour of love and it shows.
I:9805;1142;All of the cast are superb and gave a lot to this film.
I:9805;1143;I thought it was pretty good.
I:9805;1144;If you really like music or just good movies go see this movie.
I:9805;1145;"Cameron Crowe has won an Oscar for best screenplay for this movie and he has been nominated for an Oscar for ""Jerry Maguire""."
I:9805;1146;This movie was released in 2001 and is approximately one hour and eighty.
I:9805;1147;"Miller meets with a ""Band."
I:9805;1148;Both Russell and Miller fall in love with Penny Lane and it hurts their friendship.
I:9805;1149;i would recommend this movie to anyone who appreciates Rock `n Roll.
I:9805;1150;I thought that Kate Hudson did a great acting job as Penny Lane.
I:9805;1151;She was both believable and fun to watch.
I:9805;1152;The story line was good as well.
I:9805;1153;The soundtrack to this movie is important as well because it compliments certain scenes such as in the bus when they are listening to Elton John after they were all in a big fight.
I:9805;1154;i am an 18 year old girl who loves the 1960's.1970's and appreciates the movies, clothes and especially music of that era.
I:9805;1155;this movie is appealing (at least to me) because its about a young man who travels with a band and experiences it all.
I:9805;1156;It's literally a dream come true for most people.
I:9805;1157;I certainly would love to know what makes Pete Townshend write the songs he does, because he is one of the greatest lyricist's alive.
I:9805;1158;You will laugh and love and appreicate all the characters you come across in this movie.
I:9805;1159;It certainly is the best movie of 2000.
I:9805;1160;If you don't watch the movie for the performances and the plot, just watch it because it has the one of the best movie soundtracks out there.
I:9805;1161;This is a beautiful film.
I:9805;1162;Sublimely watchable, with character and definition, this film is not only a beating heart, but the beating heart of rock and roll.
I:9805;1163;It fills the screen with love and humanity, with music and energy and cinematic vitality.
I:9805;1164;It's the ultimate warm and fuzzy film of the last twenty years.
I:9805;1165;Pretty, sweet, honest, and fun (not to mention outrageously funny.
I:9805;1166;With great performances from Philip Seymour Hoffman, Billy Crudup, and Kate Hudson, as well as some great stuff from Jason Lee.
I:9805;1167;Watch and enjoy, with a smile on your face.
I:9805;1168;Wow, how do you review a movie like Almost Famous?
I:9805;1169;The kids got extreme talent for a fifteen year old, but is growing up in a time when Rock and Roll is being bought out.
I:9805;1170;At first they wont talk to him because he's a critic, but he proves that he's a fan above all and they befriend him.
I:9805;1171;Later her gets a call from the Rolling Stone magazine and pretending to be older he gets a job.
I:9805;1172;He also falls in love with Penny Lane, but she loves the lead singer.
I:9805;1173;This movie gives off great vibes and is the basis for great music.
I:9805;1174;Cameron Crowe's fictionalized account of his young days as a rock writer is a beautiful tale and a trip down memory lane.
I:9805;1175;So many roles in here are award.
I:9805;1176;The soundtrack is absolutely amazing, and it is integral to the tale Crowe is weaving for the audience.
I:9805;1177;Writer/director Cameron Crowe digs into his past and comes up with a rose.
I:9805;1178;colored gem in Almost Famous, a touching and entertaining trip that rolls along through the wild rock scene of the 1970s.
I:9805;1179;patrick Fugit plays the young protagonist, a smarter.
I:9805;1180;Although the film tends to shy away from the truly darker parts of the era, the characters uncover in sweet and more personal moments the various shades of honesty and reality that are part of being an adult.
I:9805;1181;"Each is thoroughly drawn and played with gusto, from Stillwater's prickly lead singer (Jason Lee) who refers to William as ""the Enemy,"" to the manic and outspoken Lester Bangs, through whom Phillip Seymour Hoffman shows his seemingly unending range by countering Fugit's innocence and energy with a jaded razor wit."
I:9805;1182;This is a movie about the 70s after all, and the music takes center.
I:9805;1183;But Crowe asks the audience to simply listen and experience the bond that occurs when music gets a hold of you.
I:9805;1184;Almost Famous is definitely on my top 5.
I:9805;1185;I just love everything about it.
I:9805;1186;She shows that she has completely inherited her mother's unexplainable charisma, although I haven't seen it since in the average romantic comedies she's done since.
I:9805;1187;The bootleg cut makes this film much better, and it is now my prefered way to watch it.
I:9805;1188;Also, there is a hilarious scene involving the band being interviewed by a pothead DJ.
I:9805;1189;Kate Hudson steals the film, She is innocent, charming, and kind of quirky all at the same time.
I:9805;1190;She is one of the best actesses around, and it's a shame she doesn't get more work.
I:9805;1191;Jason Lee is a great supporting role, and I am not saying that because he's one of the greatest actors of all time.
I:9805;1192;Great sound track, fits the movie perfect.
I:9805;1193;This movie, if we can call it that, is absolutely, totally, reprehensibly pathetic on all accounts.
I:9805;1194;How humorous it is when journalist boy speaks like a man over the phone.
I:9805;1195;Beleive me, I love movies, and I know what a good movie is.
I:9805;1196;I also know what a crowd.
I:9805;1197;pleasing, multiplex filling, heart warming excuse for a film is.
I:9805;1198;"The ""extended"" version of Almost Famous also known as Untitled is one of the best films of the past decade."
I:9805;1199;it is a masterpiece to every extent.
I:9805;1200;i laughed , i cried , and i had a good time watching.
I:9805;1201;protective, yet absolutely loving mother of aspiring rock.
I:9805;1202;journalist William (Patrick Fugit) absolutely nails her character.
I:9805;1203;out in her hands becomes a quirky, yet sympathetic and lovable individual.
I:9805;1204;"And Fugit's portrayal of William was so honest and believable that you truly forget you're watching a movie
I:9805;1205;kate Hudson is perfect as the tough.yet.
I:9805;1206;She is a marvel to watch, and imbues her character with warmth, humor, a touch of tragedy, and ultimately, an indominable spirit.
I:9805;1207;And fortunately for us all, the rest of the cast is just as good.
I:9805;1208;You'll find yourself transported back in time and riding with the band .
I:9805;1209;and it's a great ride.
I:9805;1210;here it is in three words: See this movie.
I:9805;1211;One of my all time favorite movies.
I:9805;1212;This is also a great date night movie.
I:9805;1213;the original theatrical release version is a great movie in itself.
I:9805;1214;This, in my opinion, is Cameron Crowe's crowning achievement as well as one of the greatest rock n' roll movies of all time ( This Is Spinal Tap, The Last Waltz, Jailhouse Rock, etc. ).
I:9805;1215;It's packed with more bonus features than you can shake a stick at.
I:9805;1216;thank you Cameron Crowe for creating an extended cut that actually improves on greatness.
I:9805;1217;Thank goodness it came out on videotape!
I:9805;1218;Kate Hudson was wonderful as the band's groupie.
I:9805;1219;"The music in the film was fantastic
I:9805;1220;Camerone Crowe did a great job with this movie.
I:9805;1221;I was so happy to see that he won the Oscar for best original screenplay.
I:9805;1222;Almost Famous is a fantastic (and true!)
I:9805;1223;this is one of my favorite films of all time.
I:9805;1224;I was afraid that the director's cut would screw up a great narrative, but the scenes that were removed were cut simply for time.
I:9805;1225;Letting his mother join the commentary proves to be both daring and insightful, as she corrects some of the slight differences between the film and real life.
I:9805;1226;this disc takes one of the best films of all time and makes it better.
I:9805;1227;writer Cameron Crowe's ode to rock n roll is more thanjust the coming of age tale he wanted to tell for a long time, it is the crowning achievement that not only vastly impressed critics, but it also vasly impressed audiences as well.
I:9805;1228;I willstop talking here, just see this wonderful wonderful movie.
I:9805;1229;thing and Jerry Maguire, but it is Almost Famous that is hismain crowning achievement and to prove it, he won a more thanwell deserved oscar for best original screenplay.
I:9805;1230;mand won a well deserved oscar nomination for best supportingactress.
I:9805;1231;However it is the talent and gorgeous Kate Hudson whosteals the show as rock groupie and wallflower Penny Lane.
I:9805;1232;Shewas so great shw should have won the best supporting actress oscar.
I:9805;1233;This movie is a must.
I:9805;1234;This has to be one of my all time favorite movies.
I:9805;1235;I was transported back to my past.
I:9805;1236;Thank you, thank you, for this work of genius, Cameron Crowe.
I:9805;1237;However the biggest asset to the success of this movie is the incredible music which is pivotal to the narrative of the story,the stunning soudtrack is ably backed by the infusion of the mythical band Stillwater and the stunning life concert footage which is incorporated into the movie.
I:9805;1238;Almost Famous is a beautifully observed coming.
I:9805;1239;age drama that captures the spirit of an era with soulful warmth and bittersweet insight.
I:9805;1240;eyed newcomer Fugit all deliver vivid, well.
I:9805;1241;rounded performances, while a brief early appearance by Philip Seymour Hoffman as real.
I:9805;1242;Crowe's songs of innocence and experience will rock your world.
I:9805;1243;One of the best movies let alone rock and roll movies ever made.
I:9805;1244;Brings back many awesome memories.
I:9805;1245;So, I will simply say that the availability of Almost Famous with its fabulous soundtrack on Blu ray is an overdue delight.
I:9805;1246;a great transfer with great sound.
I:9805;1247;Available as an import with this listing.
I:9805;1248;highly recommended as a result of their excellent help).
I:9805;1249;Well, it plays without any problems and is beautiful looking and sounding.
I:9805;1250;in short, if you love this movie, you will enjoy it more than ever on Blu ray!
I:9805;1251;He knows that remarkable things can be done with simple people in simple stories.
I:9805;1252;What is surprising to me is that Crowe is able to make such good movies that are utterly without pretense.
I:9805;1253;This movie is touching without being maudlin, and manages to develop the character of an ultra precocious 15.
I:9805;1254;crowe has squeezed remarkable performances from all his actors, who present us with finely realized, 3.
I:9805;1255;This movie also has some truly funny moments.
I:9805;1256;roll (even the tail end of it, as I did), this flick is a memorable blast from the past.
I:9805;1257;The movie is a terrific film, and I am talking about the Director's Cut.
I:9805;1258;I just felt so GOOD after watching this movie, it made me feel so happy and just glad to be alive.
I:9805;1259;Throughout the film we take this journey with him, and Cameron Crowe presents the film in such a way that it feels as if we are taking the journey with him.
I:9805;1260;But in the end I just felt so good, and I was completely full of joy and warmth from this movie.
I:9805;1261;And that's what this movie is really about, life, and the lessons and journeys you take through and with you.
I:9805;1262;A very, very good film.
I:9805;1263;This movie is wonderful but in a subtle way, and Oscar prefers less subtlety.
I:9805;1264;Almost Famous is a superb coming.
I:9805;1265;ego, is played by newcomer Patrick Fugit, and he is a real charmer!
I:9805;1266;Kate Hudson shines as band.
I:9805;1267;aid Penny Lane, but is it really an Oscar.
I:9805;1268;This movie will bring back pleasant memories of rock and roll in its pre.
I:9805;1269;corporate heydey, back when the fans decided what was good, rather than having MTV tell them.
I:9805;1270;I felt this was a great adaptation of Cameron Crowe's adventures as a journalist for Rolling Stone, powered by strong performances, especially with Jason Lee and Kate Hudson.
I:9805;1271;The soundtrack, though not exactly my type, does a great job setting the mood for this classic story.
I:9805;1272;This is one of the most original, touching, at times flat.
I:9805;1273;out hilarious rock and roll stories ever created!
I:9805;1274;It flowed very easily and told a good story.
I:9805;1275;the Director's edition is worth the extra money.
I:9805;1276;It has the theatrical version as well as an extended Director's cut, which I found worthwhile.
I:9805;1277;this one lives up to the billing as a Special Edition.
I:9805;1278;It not only has two versions, but great commentary by Crowe and his actual mother.
I:9805;1279;Everything about this film is just incredible.
I:9805;1280;the score is just magnificent!
I:9805;1281;the style of directing is A+ directing once again from Mr. Crowe.
I:9805;1282;Steven Sodenburg for Best Director?!?
I:9805;1283;You have to be kidding!The film is very mesmorizing, and also very inspirational.
I:9805;1284;I recommend this film to everyone, especially to the music lovers out there.
I:9805;1285;One of my favorite movies!
I:9805;1286;I actually have a small music credit in the movie so I'm partial proud.
I:9805;1287;Ok this movie didn't make any real impact at the Academy Awards accept for Best Original Screen Play.
I:9805;1288;Perhaps so many people grew up during those years (early 70s) and are the big movie watchers and critizers of films today.
I:9805;1289;You have two worlds, one of sweet idolitry, and one of the life of a rock star.
I:9805;1290;The intertwining and meshing of them is told very well by this movie.
I:9805;1291;This was always one of my favourite movies of all time.
I:9805;1292;When I finally got my hands on my very own copy of The Bootleg Cut I was pleased and exited.
I:9805;1293;I was so very happy to see Anna Paquin's character in a few more scenes, because I didnt ever think her character was explored enough.
I:9805;1294;I love the Directors Cut it adds a little more than the theatrical version.
I:9805;1295;this is a best movie and I really love the storyline.
I:9805;1296;I also like the fact that this moviehas many stars in it that were just getting started in their career.
I:9805;1297;I have added this since I wrotethis little piece Philip Seymor Hoffman was really great in his role of Lester Bangs.
I:9805;1298;"Cameron Crowe, former teenaged rock critic matured into essayist, screenwriter and film director, created my favorite film of 2000 (tied with ""O Brother Where Art Thou"") by bottling a precious ingredient found in few movies."
I:9805;1299;drawing from his own rich autobiography, Crowe vividly relates the journey of a teenage Odysseus (played here with wide eyed purity by Patrick Fugit) who embarks on a journey of discovery, pain, love, maturation, loss and spiritual awakening.
I:9805;1300;the magic of Almost Famous lies in its characters' abilities to reach that most heroic of human experience: transformation into a better self.
I:9805;1301;"fugit plays William Miller, a fifteen year old genius based upon Crowe himself, who is given the impossible task of writing a ""think piece"" in Rolling Stone magazine about a fictitious rock and roll band called Stillwater."
I:9805;1302;aides here, Miller finds himself caught between staying true to his calling.
I:9805;1303;and betraying new found friends.
I:9805;1304;crowe's genius, as previously expressed in his earlier films Say Anything, Jerry Maguire and Singles lies in his ability to craft through careful collaboration with his always superb casts, real people who despite great character flaws and warts, have the spark of goodness inside them.
I:9805;1305;In a Cameron Crowe film, everyone has the chance to be saved.
I:9805;1306;everyone does end up forgiven and transformed.
I:9805;1307;"That love radiates throughout every frame of every film he makes (this does not speak to his misstep ""Vanilla Sky"")Crowe also possesses an uncanny instinct to marry music with the film."
I:9805;1308;"The sequence fusing Elton John's ""Tiny Dancer"" to a Stillwater's collective forgiveness of Russell Hammond is pure bliss."
I:9805;1309;There is a real general callous soulessness that lurks on the tip of each scene threatening to consume the frail humanity of this Odyssey.
I:9805;1310;But that evil is held at bay and ultimately destroyed by the great good that certainly dwells in every character's heart.
I:9805;1311;as consistent with all previous Crowe films, the acting ensemble is perfect.
I:9805;1312;She has so many scenes that literally broke my heart while making me smile.
I:9805;1313;He is a star in the making.
I:9805;1314;The commentary by Crowe and his mother is priceless as is the fleshed out sequences which manage to humanize and elevate the characters even more.
I:9805;1315;Being able to read the complete script is fascinating also as a reference point.
I:9805;1316;It proves the old addage that all good films must begin with a great script.
I:9805;1317;What a great movie !!!
I:9805;1318;As someone who grew up in the 60's and 70's, I must say this movie really got it right, Sex, Drugs and Rock and Roll.
I:9805;1319;an absolute dream come true for many a teenager in that era, to travel on tour behind the scenes with the likes of Led Zeppelin, Aerosmith, AC/DC, or the Stones.
I:9805;1320;Special kudos to Kate Hudson, she truly stole the show, what a wonderful performance.
I:9805;1321;"Yes, the extended version (supposedly titled ""Untitled"", but presented here as ""The Bootleg Cut"") is a wonderful, immersive experience that is a lot of fun to watch for people who love this very lovable film."
I:9805;1322;"as I said in the review title, in another year or two you can definitely expect an ""Ultimate Collector's Edition"" or some such, containing both films (as well as, probably, the 6."
I:9805;1323;That said, the extended cut does look and sound terrific on this disc.
I:9805;1324;Oh well, what are ya gonna do.
I:9805;1325;Fun movie with one weird/dodgy moment.
I:9805;1326;I thought this was a good movie otherwise (Kate Hudson's character is so well.
I:9805;1327;played and the plot is very well put together).
I:9805;1328;Some people really love this movie and I enjoyed it but I wasn't amazed by it or anything.
I:9805;1329;"Well worth a watch though
I:9805;1330;great soundtrack, great acting, good movie.
I:9805;1331;I have always loved the movie and just discovered that I was a year ahead of Les Bangs at El Cajon Valley High School.
I:9805;1332;Patrick Fugit is so amazingly talented, and it just blew me away that it was his first movie.
I:9805;1333;my favorite parts of the movie are when he runs to The Plaza Hotel to comfort a drug.
I:9805;1334;overdosed Penny Lane, he tells Penny he loves her, and when Russell Hammond apologizes to William about Rolling Stone.
I:9805;1335;i love how it has a sweet ending of William and Russell parting on good terms, and William's story finally being published in Rolling Stone.
I:9805;1336;By the time I finished watching Almost Famous, I had a silly grin on my face and sincerely wished I had been one of the characters in it.
I:9805;1337;Even if you don't hang with bands this movie is a lot of fun.
I:9805;1338;It's a new look at bands and how they really bond and work with each other.
I:9805;1339;An innocent drawn to a world that looks glamorous to him and where he thinks and he'll be cool.
I:9805;1340;It's the story of everyone's innocence of their teenage years.
I:9805;1341;William wants to fit in and his innocence is palpable and real.
I:9805;1342;Director Crowe really hits the nail on the head with William's feelings and experience.
I:9805;1343;You can see it William's face, he's crushed.
I:9805;1344;That theme shows itself again and again during the movie.
I:9805;1345;"If one the band's fans could save the world, ""it means rock can save the world!"
I:9805;1346;by the end of the tour William, who has seen and experienced more than he ever thought he could, and even understands the world better than Penny emerges with his innocence intact.
I:9805;1347;He reunites his mother and sister, and when Russell shows up at William's house, William is still willing and able to get the interview from Russell that he always wanted.
I:9805;1348;Russell calls Rolling Stone and tells them William's story is true, and Stillwater rediscovers the innocence and joy of creating music when they step back from the high power business of Rock `n' Roll and go back to their roots of playing smaller venues.
I:9805;1349;crowe hits all the right notes in characterization and the times.
I:9805;1350;Everyone seems perfect for their roles and they're delivered with sincerity that most viewers can identify with.
I:9805;1351;I believe that Almost famous is one of the best movies I have ever seen.
I:9805;1352;I really enjoyed seeing Kate Hudson in this movie as well.
I:9805;1353;She is a great actress and a beautiful person.
I:9805;1354;Well I think that it's finally time Kate has had a good recommendation for how good of an actress she really is she deserves to be seen a lot more.
I:9805;1355;I really enjoyed this film, and I will continue to enjoy it( even though I have seen it about 30 times since it came out on video.
I:9805;1356;I love the movie thanks to all.
I:9805;1357;Almost Famous is a great movie.
I:9805;1358;I won't try to get too eloquent or elaborate and I'll try to keep things simple.
I:9805;1359;On the surface it's about music and love, but dig deeper and you'll find so much more.
I:9805;1360;I originally thought that I enjoyed the film so much because as a pseudo.
I:9805;1361;journalist myself, I could relate to a lot of the issues as a film.
I:9805;1362;But really, this is a film that everyone can relate to.
I:9805;1363;Kate Hudson does a terrific job of playing the one who got away .
I:9805;1364;the first love that everyone's got and everyone thinks back to over a warm beer on a boring day.
I:9805;1365;The scene where she's one the phone with William in the kitchen and after he hangs up she throws the phone to the floor is classic.
I:9805;1366;In fact, there are so many scenes in this movie that are classic .
I:9805;1367;I wanted to add my voice to say that this is a lovely little gem of a movie.
I:9805;1368;The actors are perfect for their roles, the soundtrack is great, and the coming.
I:9805;1369;age story feels authentic and raw thru the whimsy.
I:9805;1370;William wins out as he is invited to go on tour with Stillwater, a ficticious R R band.
I:9805;1371;One minute he is treated as one of the boys and the next, he is regarded as the enemy .
I:9805;1372;The music and the interaction between characters is believable and sometimes touching.
I:9805;1373;Performances by Fugit, Kate Hudson, and Billy Crudup are excellent.
I:9805;1374;Cameron Crowe really outdoes himself here, and clearly uses some of his own personal experiences and observations to create what is one of the best movies of 2000.
I:9805;1375;himself appeal, rather like a 1970's 'Perks of being a Wallflower', yet the characters are exceptionally developed and appealing, especially the divine Miss Pennylane, a groupie come professional band aid.
I:9805;1376;the plot has a handsome gentle humour and a fabulous way of ordering scenes to maximise the effect of the piece.
I:9805;1377;the director delivers a sensitivity to the film and the characters, and reveals beauty admist the drug culture and ideasof the 1960's and 1970's.
I:9805;1378;this film is truly fabulous, reminding us what we love about music, and what we love about life.
I:9805;1379;I wasn't alive in this time period (sad, I know) but still love this film and it creates some unconscious nostalgia.
I:9805;1380;the Bootleg version is better and has some additonal scenes which I believe illustrate the theme of the movie perfectly (such as the scene of Penny dancing alone in the auditorium after everyone has left).
I:9805;1381;the soundtrack is of course great, and at times you want to sing along.
I:9805;1382;this is my favorite movie of all time, and I make everyone I know watch it.
I:9805;1383;Well written story, great acting and the music was good and not over the top.
I:9805;1384;Nothing like an excellent Rock and Roll movie!!
I:9805;1385;Ok, so that title of one of the world's best movies ever sounds hokey.
I:9805;1386;It is also one of the finest movies ever made about the golden age of 1970's rock n'roll.
I:9805;1387;throughout the film William walks a fine tightrope between becoming friends with people who are his heroes and maintaining his journalistic integrity.
I:9805;1388;This film is a brilliant meditation on why we like music and what is the meaning of being a 'true fan'.
I:9805;1389;Crowe's additional footage greatly adds to the story and gives us a greater understanding to the motivations and emotions of the characters.
I:9805;1390;this edition makes up for this with Crowe giving us a both inciteful and hilarious commentary with his real life mother.
I:9805;1391;These two laugh and reminice with great chemistry and make it very obvious, that their relationship was accurately captured in the movie.
I:9805;1392;If you are a fan of 1970s rock n'roll then this is the movie for you!
I:9805;1393;The media has done an effective job of convincing the world that nothing existed between the Baby.
I:9805;1394;cameron Crowe is the first person from this generation to create an accurate portrayal of the 1970s and our generation.
I:9805;1395;all the characters in the film, from William Miller and Penny Lane, down through the Zeppelin fan to the partygoers in Topeka, are all amazing accurate and correspond closely to people who I knew at the time.
I:9805;1396;all the locations in the film, particularly backstage at the San Diego Sports Arena and at the Continental Hyatt on the Sunset Strip, were also amazingly accurate .
I:9805;1397;all this amazing accuracy is made possible by the film being an autobiography.
I:9805;1398;what is remarkable is that Cameron was able to remember so clearly many of the tiny details, details which make the film like a time machine for those of us who came of age in the 1970s.
I:9805;1399;it's very satisfying that now the record has been set straight, and that there is finally a true depiction of those times, that are of great significance in the lives of a generation who previously were not even acknowledged as existing!Many thanks to Cameron Crowe for putting us on the map!And please see all the other fine reviews on this page for descriptions of the excellent acting and filmmaking in this production.
I:9805;1400;A little drawn out but overall a good movie.
I:9805;1401;Interesting storyline and Kate Hudson really carried the cast.
I:9805;1402;I got Untitled and all things considered, I do enjoy it a lot.
I:9805;1403;And so far, of the 3 Easter Eggs found, they are pretty good.
I:9805;1404;If you are a fan of Rock (not rock and roll, that is the 60's) and came of age in the 70's, as I did, this is a film for you.
I:9805;1405;It has some the great songs of the era, and is an earnest look at a (fake?)
I:9805;1406;It is a good film.
I:9805;1407;I like Cameron Crowe's films, and I would recommend this film based on that, although first I would say Jerry Maguire and, especially, Say Anything, are more essential viewing.
I:9805;1408;Again, this is surprising, because the film is at least semi.
I:9805;1409;The performances are no better than good in most cases.
I:9805;1410;She actually received an Oscar nomination for her performance.
I:9805;1411;Billy Crudup is better as the guitarist.
I:9805;1412;This is one of the best movies that I have ever had the pleasure to watch, and is definitely Cameron's best and most personal project to date.
I:9805;1413;I thoroughly enjoyed this movie!
I:9805;1414;warming story, I found myself smiling throughout the whole movie.
I:9805;1415;I love to leave a theatre feeling good, about myself as well as mankind.
I:9805;1416;excellent flick for all Romantics.
I:9805;1417;I was exactly the age of William in this film, but actually enjoyed the music of the fifties and early sixties better at the time.
I:9805;1418;cameron Crowe captures the feel of a segment of society that has come through the late sixties flower.
I:9805;1419;power era and has developed a hard.
I:9805;1420;edge, in things like their drug use and their attitudes towards money and success.
I:9805;1421;Nothing new to add to the other fine reviews here .
I:9805;1422;Great story with an awesome cast of characters.
I:9805;1423;"But the real story is in the journey of the band, the boy, his mother, his sister and of the ""band aids""."
I:9805;1424;Almost famous is a fun blast from my secret past.
I:9805;1425;if you grew up in the late 60's ,70's,80's you'll love this movie.
I:9805;1426;Alot of fun, some serious notes,definately entertaining.
I:9805;1427;And it's not only because Cameron Crowe and I are close in age so we grew up during the same time, but the cast for this film was well selected and the film is well shot.
I:9805;1428;The music, both the scoring and the period pieces, are great choices and in the case of the score well produced.
I:9805;1429;This films captures the joy it was to see and be with a rock group that was growing in popularity and status.
I:9805;1430;As I said a good cast that was well thought out.
I:9805;1431;In this case though the players fit the rolls they're assigned to and play them very well.
I:9805;1432;The language used in the screenplay was very good and (dare I say it) right on.
I:9805;1433;a great film depicting a time that, although, has been seen before in film was never as well played out as it is in this film.
I:9805;1434;I loved this movie when I saw it at the theater.
I:9805;1435;I also had a lot of questions about the story and the characters.
I:9805;1436;The uncut version of the film is excellent and explains the relationship between Penny Lane and Russell much better.
I:9805;1437;Excellent entertainment and I highly recommend it to any fan of Kate Hudson's or Goldie Hawn.
I:9805;1438;However if you just want the film, this is a great product.
I:9805;1439;has humor and romance and is an all around good movie
I:9805;1440;Amazing acting, super cool plot, great writing and quotes!
I:9805;1441;I can watch this movie over and over.
I:9805;1442;And the music is fantastic!!!
I:9805;1443;The story is fun and there are some fine performances by Patrick Fugit, Billy Crudup, Jason Lee and Phillip Seymour Hoffman.
I:9805;1444;i also thought that since the character played by Fugit (Billy Miller) is essentially Cameron Crowe himself, he pretty much has portrayed himself as a perfect child with few faults.
I:9805;1445;overall, it was a good movie, especially if you enjoy the great music that is part of the soundtrack.
I:9805;1446;paced a movie like Almost Famous is a welcome breather.
I:9805;1447;"cameron Crowe's loose fictionalization of his stint as a journalist for Creem and Rolling Stone can take you back to a time in your life where music really mattered and hit you on a personal level
I:9805;1448;And watching Patrick Fugit portray an intelligent, kind, passionate, and yet, uncool, music fan strikes a real chord in the heart of every aging teen misfit.
I:9805;1449;He makes solid films with some reliable emotional spots, with no pretensions to grand style .
I:9805;1450;I didn't know what to expect going into the movie but two minutes into the movie I knew I loved it.
I:9805;1451;But most of all it's about growing up, and I think that it will amaze anyone at any age, any race, anything!
I:9805;1452;Everyone will love this film.
I:9805;1453;I found myself crying at scenes that weren't even sad.
I:9805;1454;I was pulled in through Penny Lane (Kate Hudson) and I cried as I watched her grow.
I:9805;1455;com, bought the screenplay book by Crowe and found a rare theater mylar I hope to keep forever.
I:9805;1456;It will make you laugh, make you cry, make you happy, but most of all make you live.
I:9805;1457;based on a true story, this film is one of the future classics of the American film industry.
I:9805;1458;Directed by Cameron Crowe (the story is based on real events that have happened to him), it gives one of the most realistic portrayals of what it is like to be the extra guy in the band.
I:9805;1459;It gives a very accurate depiction of the lives of groupies, musicians, and reporters of the 70's rock scene.
I:9805;1460;If you like 70's era rock and roll this is the movie for you.
I:9805;1461;If you are simply a good movie fan this will also be a great watch.
I:9805;1462;cameron Crowe makes movies that seem to blend between the visuals and the soundtrack to help tell the story.
I:9805;1463;please give this one a shot.
I:9805;1464;I watch it every few years.
I:9805;1465;It really captures 70s rock culture .
I:9805;1466;a time when I was growing up and getting into music.
I:9805;1467;i finally saw this film alone last night and it was raining and i have a horrible cold and afterwards, i had to wait forever to be picked up, but it was all so worth it because this film is absolutely brilliant.
I:9805;1468;so many tiny, subtle scenes filled with such huge emotional value gave 'almost famous' this heartwenching beauty.
I:9805;1469;he has such an intense honesty to his face that is hardly ever seen in actors his age (and it's great to know that he is a teenager because it's so silly when a character who's 15 or 16 is played by an actor 10 years too old).
I:9805;1470;i really hope to see him in other things.
I:9805;1471;"kate hudson's luminous performance brought to mind a couple of wonderful old film's heroines (audrey hepburn in 'breakfast at tiffanys'
I:9805;1472;her stunning portrayal of penny lane brought a real depth to 'almost famous'.
I:9805;1473;there are so many amazing pieces in 'almost famous', both funny and touching.
I:9805;1474;and the cinematography is gorgeous.
I:9805;1475;everyone should watch this film.
I:9805;1476;it will steal your heart and by the end return it softened with love and music inside.
I:9805;1477;This has always been one of my favorite movies.
I:9805;1478;It was a great surprise!
I:9805;1479;Almost Famous is my favorite movie of all time and Cameron Crowe is my all time favorite writer/director.
I:9805;1480;This movie is by far one of his best films yet.
I:9805;1481;old William Miller (Patrick Fugit), who's dream is to become a great rock journalist while his overprotective mother strives for her son to go to law school.
I:9805;1482;"He becomes torn between wanting to belong with his new rock star friends and his wanting to be a ""honest and unmerciful"" rock journalist."
I:9805;1483;The character of Penny Lane was derived from many girls who went on tour with the bands simply because they loved their music.
I:9805;1484;amazing movie, amazing performances by the actors, amazing music.
I:9805;1485;My husband and I really enjoyed it.
I:9805;1486;This was an interesting film.
I:9805;1487;Kate Hudson is very good in this film and oh so lovely!
I:9805;1488;Gives you some inside information on working in the background of Rock Groups and life on the road as well trying to break into the business of being a rock critic!
I:9805;1489;This original screenplay won an academy award this year and I can understand why.
I:9805;1490;There's a lot of heart in it as it's based on the writer/director Cameron Crowe's own experience as a teenage writer for Rolling Stone Magazine.
I:9805;1491;He's a true innocent and plays the role with wide.
I:9805;1492;Billy Crudup, with his chiseled good looks plays the lead guitarist of the band and his role goes beyond the stereotype of a rock musician.
I:9805;1493;And then there is the lovely Kate Hudson, who adds sparkle and sensitivity to her role as a groupie.
I:9805;1494;William Seymour Hoffman also adds his talents as the writer/rock critic who the young William looks up to as his mentor.
I:9805;1495;the best part of this film, though, was the way the screenplay captured the time and place of the rock music scene of the 70s.
I:9805;1496;the attitude, clothing, and youthful energy that was so much a part of the times.
I:9805;1497;the world that this film captures so well is long gone.
I:9805;1498;The characters have grown up and the young reporter is now a successful Hollywood screenwriter.
I:9805;1499;The intensity of the times have faded and we now live in a world of computers and cell phones.
I:9805;1500;What a delight it was though to again feel the pulse of the 70s and hear the music once again.
I:9805;1501;If you are a fan of classic rock, you'll love this movie.
I:9805;1502;This is pretty much my favorite movie of all time.
I:9805;1503;So excited to find this movie on Amazon.
I:9805;1504;Being able to watch it from any device anywhere is a great thing!
I:9805;1505;Amazing soundtrack if you like music from the '70's.
I:9805;1506;Crowe brought inspiration throughout this movie.
I:9805;1507;An all time Feel good movie with great music.
I:9805;1508;I always feel good after watching it.
I:9805;1509;This is a classic must see Rock film.
I:9805;1510;Funny, tragic, and captures the era well.
I:9805;1511;"Kate Hudson's character was based on Liv Tyler's mother Bebe Buell (so the rumor goes) and Kate does a splendid job of playing the quintessential ""I'm with the band girl""."
I:9805;1512;The Bootleg Cut (Director's Edition) has extra material that fills in the gaps that add so much more to the story.
I:9805;1513;I recommend that you don't pass it up if you can find it.
I:9805;1514;Almost Famous is a charming movie with heart and soul rarely found in today's mire of blockbusters.
I:9805;1515;on one level, it's a great movie about a talented and earnest teenager commissioned by Rolling Stone Magazine to write a feature on a rock band called Stillwater (they don't know he's only fifteen, of course).
I:9805;1516;He develops a passion for it, and his role as a young rock critic garners the attention of Rolling Stone.
I:9805;1517;On the road with the band, he meets (and becomes infatuated with) Penny Lane, a groupie whose character (played by the lovely Kate Hudson) is heartbreakingly delicate.
I:9805;1518;on an ancillary level, it's a movie about rock music.
I:9805;1519;It's about a critic's integrity, the cruelties of the biz, and more.
I:9805;1520;why this movie is so wonderful is that it's a great movie about growing up.
I:9805;1521;eyed idealist who witnesses the broken hearts and inclemency of the real world, yet still steadfastly clutches at confidence and optimism.
I:9805;1522;William is a smart kid, and his character is very well.
I:9805;1523;acted with the right amounts of naivet and youthful exuberance to add credence to his role.
I:9805;1524;Sights, sounds, clothing and thought processes of the era are all faithfully reported in this gem of a movie.
I:9805;1525;watching the Crowe interview in the special features section, and checking out his Rolling Stone articles, you know that the casting director for the film was a genius.
I:9805;1526;the real star of the movie is the music, and the mix of authentic and pretend rock of the era, along with some of its unusual anthems (all of Elton John's early music touched cords in rock lovers .
I:9805;1527;The group scenes in the movie, most set to music, have an authentic camaraderie and sense of chilling that made ecletic groups of band members such memorable icons of the era.
I:9805;1528;many of the band members and wannabes were well cast, but the centerpiece is Kate Hudson, who illuminates the screen with her charisma and vulnerability.
I:9805;1529;A well deserved Oscar for a talented young actress.
I:9805;1530;this film earns a resounding 5 stars .
I:9805;1531;This movie captures the spirit of those times.
I:9805;1532;Terrific performances by all involved.
I:9805;1533;Definitely in the top 25 of my favorite movies of all time.
I:9805;1534;What else can I say, but this movie ROCKS!
I:9805;1535;This special edition is so worth the money because you not only get fab commentary by Mr. crowe himself, but get some commentary from his mom Ann.
I:9805;1536;I liked it better than the original version.
I:9805;1537;I just love this movie!
I:9805;1538;This is an all time favorite movie.
I:9805;1539;Gotta see it, gotta get it.
I:9805;1540;Crowe captured every feeling I had for the music represented in this stunning movie.
I:9805;1541;This is the best movie that has came out in a while, very possibly, Coppola's Virgin Suicides .
I:9805;1542;of this movieis the depiction of the young, drifting groupie.
I:9805;1543;layered humanity with the testosterone.
I:9805;1544;in the very best sense, this is a superb chick flick about aremarkable woman.
I:9805;1545;An entertaining, funny, character movie with so many familiar faces in it.
I:9805;1546;Regardless, it is a nice surprise from an older movie you might have missed when new.
I:9805;1547;Director Cameron Crowe has created a masterpiece of a movie with his delicate direction .
I:9805;1548;it is a tremendous injustice that this film was not nominated for the Best Picture Academy Award because it should have won the statue for Best Picture of the Year.
I:9805;1549;In my opinion, it is the best film of this past year, and I do not understand how you can see this movie and not think this.
I:9805;1550;Director Crowe should have also been nominated along with the score and several of the supporting performances.
I:9805;1551;These people are so real and caring that the story can only be seen through a warm perspective .
I:9805;1552;you will smile throughout the entire two hours.
I:9805;1553;"kate Hudson's performance of the ""band aid"" Penny Lane is a near flawless performance."
I:9805;1554;She inhabitats this character's thoughts and actions .
I:9805;1555;her laugh will make you laugh, her smile will make you smile.
I:9805;1556;She should have the won the statue for Best Supporting Actress (although Marcia Gay Harden was a good selection too).
I:9805;1557;The other members of the supporting cast are also good, and everyone is worthy of some recognition.
I:9805;1558;the soundtrack also perfectly matches the feelings.
I:9805;1559;"i cannot say enough about this movie
I:9805;1560;it is so warm and inviting and real.
I:9805;1561;When you are finished viewing this film, you will have wanted to know these characters .
I:9805;1562;they will keep you smiling for days.
I:9805;1563;"The extra features allow fans to really understand the making of the film
I:9805;1564;What you once thought about the characters still remains true, but with this version, Crowe digs deeper with each scene.
I:9805;1565;(The version with Crowe and his mother talking over the film is fun to watch and listen .
I:9805;1566;their commentary is very amusing.)
I:9805;1567;If you are any type of human with a true heart, you need to love this movie.
I:9805;1568;The acting is the best part of this movie.
I:9805;1569;Everything about Billy Crudup's performance is right on target.
I:9805;1570;His character comes across as likeable and very believable.
I:9805;1571;Patrick Fugit, Kate Hudson are also real and refreshing.
I:9805;1572;i didn't think the movie itself was all that memorable but the acting was so good, it made the movie quite enjoyable.
I:9805;1573;but if you like this flick, you'll want the extra goodies.
I:9805;1574;Almost Famous reaches out to anyone who has ever been caught between the expectations of normalcy and experiencing the extraordinary.
I:9805;1575;William, the main character, struggles with the pressure from his mother to be a person of substance in the real world.
I:9805;1576;The emphasis on the real world is just a personal construction that changes every day.
I:9805;1577;More people may accept a certain way of life as reality, but others create their own unique reality.
I:9805;1578;"For William's mother it is education and success
I:9805;1579;stillwater adopts William as part of their family.
I:9805;1580;As William befriends the band, he realizes it is hard to be honest but concludes that honesty is true friendship.
I:9805;1581;Few writer/directors working today can match Cameron Crowe's consistently beautiful work.
I:9805;1582;He continues his his winning streak with Almost Famous.
I:9805;1583;Almost Famous cotinues the Crowe tradition of laugh out loud comedy combined with sentimentality, and heart rendering drama.
I:9805;1584;Far be it from me to jump on the Kate Hudson bandwagon, but she absolutely deserves an oscar for her supporting role as the lead band.
I:9805;1585;She captures the screen everytime she is on.
I:9805;1586;She will break your heart and make you love her character.
I:9805;1587;Why he got so little attention for his finely shaded performance is beyond me.
I:9805;1588;They all deliver fine performances, even Lee whom I have always found a bit stiff.
I:9805;1589;"When the music was extremely creative
I:9805;1590;extremely beautiful moment in the movie.
I:9805;1591;it makes me remember the fact that music seems to be there for a reason, and it is to tie sounds to your memories, to times during your life, and that is priceless.
I:9805;1592;definitely worth seeing, owning, and listening to also.
I:9805;1593;This movie has a bit of everything.
I:9805;1594;Drama, romance action you name it this movie has it.
I:9805;1595;I thought I would end up bored and dissatisfied with this new version: It's one of my favorite films anyway, how can it be better.
I:9805;1596;All of the extra footage is very good, and it truly adds to the plot of the film, rather than just being there for the sake of being included.
I:9805;1597;Some of the stuff is totally new, including a very funny radio station interview scene.
I:9805;1598;It's a whole new (and much better) movie.
I:9805;1599;Yet, much like an Old Navy commercial, this film fits into this rare category.
I:9805;1600;the editor of Cream Magazine is played in a nail.
I:9805;1601;ish, burnout guys you may know who perform comic roles in your local community theatre and who can't stop talking about Iggy Pop.
I:9805;1602;"Then, you will not find this movie annoying at all
I:9805;1603;and he has a gift for getting out of jams by convoluting the truth (like all the best writers do).
I:9805;1604;"curlers and to the backdrop of Simon and Garfunkel's ""America"" his older sister Anita has finally had enough of `no' Mum and exits the nest (dialogue above) leaving young William a parting gift that will shape his whole life ."
I:9805;1605;a carry bag full of vinyl albums under his bed.
I:9805;1606;Lighting a candle as instructed by sis (an early part for the gorgeous Zooey Deschanel) .
I:9805;1607;And like many of us Crowe also seems to feel that something changed between 1973 and 1975 .
I:9805;1608;sporting a fantastic ensemble group of actors .
I:9805;1609;Lester correctly surmises that the icons William loves so much will eat him up and spit him out a truly sullied being.
I:9805;1610;But the kid is just so damn earnest.
I:9805;1611;"so Lester tells him ""to be honest and unmerciful."""
I:9805;1612;and hopes he'll survive a tour with rising rock band Stillwater who are supporting Black Sabbath on a US tour.
I:9805;1613;Cue tour bus rides with paperbacks of Ray Bradbury, Circle magazine, sexy girls with long flowing hair boogieing to The Allman Brothers and the most fantastic use of an Elton John song in any movie .
I:9805;1614;but at least the longer 'Director's Cut' does feature material that expands the fictional band's relationship with their fans and more of William's coming.
I:9805;1615;and it genuinely adds rather than detracts.
I:9805;1616;"marvelling at just how truly gorgeous Led Zeppelin's acoustic ""That's The Way"" from ""III"" is ."
I:9805;1617;you're transported to a time when music could change the world and expand your horizons and record shops were places you stood in shaking with excitement at what new thrill you would find.
I:9805;1618;one of Blighty's best ever singers was right.
I:9805;1619;pS: Crowe went on to make the equally wonderful music.
I:9805;1620;Oh what a terrific movie.
I:9805;1621;Stillwater is your typical rock band from the seventies: Sex, Drugs, and Rock Roll.
I:9805;1622;It is warming to see William see things for the first time in his life and just look around in awe with gleaming eyes.
I:9805;1623;Almost Famous is enlightening and provocative.
I:9805;1624;This is a movie that you can sit down to in a bad mood, and emerge warm and happy.
I:9805;1625;Simon and Garfunkel's America especially sets the mood in one scene near the beginning.
I:9805;1626;There is terrific acting by all and a great plot.
I:9805;1627;Cameron Crowe does a terrific job of bringing his story to life on the screen.
I:9805;1628;He develops the characters so well that you actually feel like you are traveling through the Rock and Roll world with William Miller.
I:9805;1629;Almost Famous is funny, touching, happy, enlightening, provocotive, and great in almost every way.
I:9805;1630;I guess it goes without saying that history is best told by those who lived and participated within it.
I:9805;1631;The film is a sentimental treat, even for those who didn't exist in the early '70s when it took place.
I:9805;1632;William's life is never the same as the likes of Bob Dylan and the Who navigate his life down a new, exciting path.
I:9805;1633;every sequence is filled with love, compassion, confusion of youth, and humanity.
I:9805;1634;William and Russell's relationship is one based on trust that they know when each is in their professional or friends mode and their actions and words jump around based on who is functioning as what.
I:9805;1635;as good as the central actors are, it's the supporting cast that steals the show.
I:9805;1636;old William Miller and his journalistic journey to capture the lives of the rock group, Stillwater, for Rolling Stone magazine.
I:9805;1637;autobiographical screenplay is superb and the actors bring each and every one of his characters to life.
I:9805;1638;Billy Crudup portrays Stillwater's lead guitarist Russell Hammond just the way you would picture a rock star to be: cool, confident and temperamental.
I:9805;1639;Patrick Fugit also gives a good performance as the wide.
I:9805;1640;eyed and innocent William, while Kate Hudson gives great energy to the worldly teen Miss Penny Lane.
I:9805;1641;almost Famous was definitely one of the best films of 2000.
I:9805;1642;Almost Famous humanizes rock stars and lets the viewer see what their world of drugs, sex, fame and music is all about.
I:9805;1643;If you are looking to see a movie with great acting, great music and a great script, then look no more, you've found it.
I:9805;1644;The cast is enchanting, especially Patrick Fugit, as William Miller in his film debut, and the charming Kate Hudson as Penny Lane, the first band.
I:9805;1645;Since I'm a music journalist myself, I can vouch that just about everything in the film is pretty much how things go.
I:9805;1646;The music in this movie is also outstanding, if a bit nostalgic.
I:9805;1647;most of the rest of the Special Features are bios and photos of cast members and the actual movie makers, but they were still interesting to read.
I:9805;1648;It covered the newly emerging world of rock'n'roll and the stars with an upfront and personal hand.
I:9805;1649;Cameron Crowe has converted his memories of life as a 16 year old rock stringer, a career he started on a lark, (with little knowledge of the music)into a very watchable and likeable movie.
I:9805;1650;the cast is outstanding and true to the times.
I:9805;1651;Patrick Fugit is perfect as the wide eyed, idealistic young man( William Miller, the character Crowe based on himself), entering a world previously unknown to him.
I:9805;1652;It is easy to see this as a star making role for her, she inhabits the role of a proud, ever hopeful band aid and draws your heart to her.
I:9805;1653;A wonderful look into the beginnngs of rock and roll, bringing back many , many memories.
I:9805;1654;Sometimes a film comes along, and it enchants and excites you.
I:9805;1655;It makes you believe in movie magic again.
I:9805;1656;Of course, even the best movie triggers these feelings in only part of its audience.
I:9805;1657;writer and director Cameron Crowe has had a charmed life, and he knows it, as can be seen in this partly autobiographical and partly fictionalized tale.
I:9805;1658;She gives in when he promises to be back in time for high school graduation and swears he won't do drugs.
I:9805;1659;He keeps his word on the drugs, but the tour and the group mesmerize the kid.
I:9805;1660;It is, to say the least, an interesting trip.
I:9805;1661;this is perhaps the best coming of age movie I have ever seen.
I:9805;1662;It ranks arguably at the top of movies about rock and roll, and it certainly feels like the most authentic.
I:9805;1663;The songs performed by Stillwater were written for the movie by Crowe and others, and they fit in seamlessly with the vintage rock and roll tunes played throughout the film.
I:9805;1664;The look and the feel of the 70s is captured perfectly.
I:9805;1665;this movie has a lot of drama in it, but it also has a lot of laughs.
I:9805;1666;It remains upbeat more often than not.
I:9805;1667;it touches you without making you feel manipulated.
I:9805;1668;It is, I suspect, the best movie of last year.
I:9805;1669;I think Almost Famous is perfect for teens.
I:9805;1670;For fans of great commentary tracks, extra footage, etc. it's one of those titles that you'll want to watch when friends come over just to show them the commentary track with his mother, along with the 36 minutes of footage that was seamlessly put back into the film.
I:9805;1671;having seen the new cut, it now makes my list as one of the best films I've ever seen.
I:9805;1672;I hope it finds the audience in video that it deserved while it was in theaters.
I:9805;1673;Hopefully Cameron will also go back to Singles and give that the treatment it deserves as well.
I:9805;1674;Vanilla Sky is as remarkable.
I:9805;1675;Almost Famous was easily among the best films of 2001.
I:9805;1676;Just watching her is enough to make a viewer smile.
I:9805;1677;The film features an Oscar.
I:9805;1678;winning screenplay, superb acting from Kate Hudson, Patrick Fugit, and Billy Crudup, and a story you will never forget.
I:9805;1679;So, bottom line: See this film!
I:9805;1680;I bought this movie with the expectation it would be good to have in my D. v. d collection.
I:9805;1681;The most obvious hidden album cover is Pink Floyd's 'Dark Side Of The Moon' during an early car ride.
I:9805;1682;He's writing a piece on the new up and coming rock band Stillwater for the magazine Rolling Stones.
I:9805;1683;Penny is definitely one of those `out of this world' types of girls.
I:9805;1684;She's a legend to the rock bands because she's just so much fun to have around, and she can always light up a room when she steps into it.
I:9805;1685;She tugs on the tendrils of every heart of every man who comes into contact with her.
I:9805;1686;will is accepted as a friend and not just `the enemy' as usual by the band members of Stillwater.
I:9805;1687;Jeff is the lead singer and Russell is the lead guitarist and also heart throb of the group.
I:9805;1688;He's becoming the front man of the band when it was supposed to be Jeff, like the plan was.
I:9805;1689;i absolutely love this movie.
I:9805;1690;Every time I watch it I have a big smile on my face almost the whole the time.
I:9805;1691;From the atmosphere to the music to the settings to the parties, everything just makes me happy.
I:9805;1692;The whole story is so much fun to watch unfold.
I:9805;1693;Getting to witness the first time William gets to go back stage to the first time he gets to hang out at a hotel party, all the while making sure he calls his mom in the morning to check in, is just so much fun.
I:9805;1694;i actually watched `The Bootleg Cut' of this movie to do this review, and I'm pretty sure it was the first time I ever watched it.
I:9805;1695;It was kind of funny and also a little informative of the situation between Russ and Jeff.
I:9805;1696;That was a great scene, so I don't know why it was taken out.
I:9805;1697;also all the actors were great.
I:9805;1698;Kate Hudson was very good, and I love the scene where Will tells her someone sold her for 50 bucks and a case of beer.
I:9805;1699;Patrick Fugit was good also, being the nice, sweet, and innocent kid and getting introduced to the life of the rock star.
I:9805;1700;Jason Lee rocked his part perfectly.
I:9805;1701;I also liked Billy Crudup and really everyone that was in Stillwater.
I:9805;1702;So real I'd love to get a faux poster of the actual actors in their get up with a big STILLWATER above them.
I:9805;1703;She was a great mom, even though a little crazy.
I:9805;1704;it was also fun to see a lot of cameos.
I:9805;1705;`Fever Dog' sounds so good as well as the other songs.
I:9805;1706;I absolutely love this movie.
I:9805;1707;this mostly Autobiographical story follows you William, a fifteen year old as he tours with an up and coming 70's rock band for a dream shot at writing for Rolling Stone.
I:9805;1708;Much of what you see here really did in some for.
I:9805;1709;Simply put, it makes more sense and is more involving with the extra info.
I:9805;1710;this is a watch it two.
I:9805;1711;a great movie that might have been an Oscar contender had this complete version been the theatrical release.
I:9805;1712;in short, everything is absolutely perfect in this film.
I:9805;1713;Cameron Crowe somehow managed to make a quintissentially funny, romantic, nostalgic, melancholy, celebratory, tragic masterpiece, and anyone who has ever loved something and seen its deterioration will respond, primally, to this film.
I:9805;1714;handedly got my hooked on classic rock music.
I:9805;1715;Besides the great soundtrack, this movie is touching, moving, engaging and amazing in almost every way.
I:9805;1716;So many themes are evident.
I:9805;1717;It's a character study, a comedy, a drama.
I:9805;1718;It evokes so many feelings while watching and in the end it is simply heart.
I:9805;1719;Almost Famous is by far my favorite movie.
I:9805;1720;It takes you back in time to make it seem like you're actually in the 70's.
I:9805;1721;It's such a captivating movie for everyone watching it.
I:9805;1722;Excellent movie, loved every line, every character, every song.
I:9805;1723;Cameron Crowe's best work, no 'almost' about it.
I:9805;1724;Would highly recommend this flick.
I:9805;1725;You will only enjoy watching this movie if you appreciate the art of journalism and history and the formation of Rock And Roll.
I:9805;1726;Rock was more innocent and more wild all at the same time!
I:9805;1727;this movie is genuinely produced to satisfy all themes of what movies are typically based on.
I:9805;1728;Almost Famous reflects the heartbreakes, true love, self .
I:9805;1729;Music is an influence to us and we dont even know how much it impacts our lives!
I:9805;1730;This movie hits closer to home to younger generations than anyone else.
I:9805;1731;the point of view of this movie is that of a teenage boy getting the real life story on rock band Still Water from the side of the stage.
I:9805;1732;He dramatically transforms from a sheltered kid under his mothers wing to a roadie of a famous rock band.
I:9805;1733;Fugit's character proved to me that living an adventurous life leads to the wildest things you could ever imagine and the stories you can tell to people.
I:9805;1734;aids, rooming with Americas favorite band or rising every day to the flamboyant orange and yellow sunrise, not expecting what will happen today.
I:9805;1735;This movie is a rollecoaster!
I:9805;1736;It takes the viewer to highs and lows.
I:9805;1737;which really keeps your eyes glued on the TV screen.
I:9805;1738;I have seen it twelve times and still learn something new every time!
I:9805;1739;Fugit's character inspires us to get out in the world and meet new people.
I:9805;1740;Those who help you acheive your dreams and learn lifes most valuable lessons.
I:9805;1741;Let go of moms hand and see for yourself a world full of the most wonderful places!
I:9805;1742;I strongly suggest seeing this wonderful movie.
I:9805;1743;It will make you feel like a child all over again!
I:9805;1744;This Is the greatest movie ever known.
I:9805;1745;It's all about being a groupie and peace love and rock and roll.
I:9805;1746;wonderful, always in play in on form or another in my home.
I:9805;1747;This is defintily one of the best movies I have seen in a looong time!
I:9805;1748;Me and MANY of my friends who were growing up in that generation, LOVED it.
I:9805;1749;Take it from someone whos best friends are in a band.
I:9805;1750;I guess thats why i loved this movie so much because i could totally understand all of it.
I:9805;1751;So I feel don't listen to Drews opinion, this is a GREAT film, take the time to watch it!
I:9805;1752;This movie just keeps getting better and better with time.
I:9805;1753;rate actors even in small roles.
I:9805;1754;A good measure of its appeal for me is, of course, nostalgia.
I:9805;1755;But every so often it pays great dividends to watch it again.
I:9805;1756;This one was done right.
I:9805;1757;The main disc has the Director's Cut of the movie with the commentary tracks and a few other goodies.
I:9805;1758;The extra 30 minutes is really interesting and fits nicely.
I:9805;1759;It is very personal, and you learn a ton.
I:9805;1760;It is worth the price all by itself.
I:9805;1761;I'll own if forever and watch it many times over.
I:9805;1762;Obvious affection for the times portrayed and the characters who are at least partially based on the real thing.
I:9805;1763;The BR version looks great with a feature on the making of the movie as an interesting extra.
I:9805;1764;The character development of this film is flawless.
I:9805;1765;Crowe guides us through the plot with humor, sentiment, and nostalgia.
I:9805;1766;This, in my opinion, was the best film of the year.
I:9805;1767;class ending to a first.
I:9805;1768;The last minute aside, this movie is a classic, one that I will watch many times for years to come.
I:9805;1769;A tale of a young boy, William Miller, who lies about his age and finds a way to interview rockstars for Rolling Stones magazine.
I:9805;1770;While he does not play with the band, you get a sense that little Miller is overwhelmed with joy at the prospect at following the band into their VIP hideaways.
I:9805;1771;the movie also provides an aspiring message to those who aspire to reach the heights of their career.
I:9805;1772;In America, the story tells us, merit is what is important.
I:9805;1773;He's able to carry out the duties of someone twice his age.
I:9805;1774;As an avid fan of rock and pop music, and being at an age where I can actually remember 1973, this movie is absolutely one of my favorites.
I:9805;1775;Though he's talking about music, I thought the comment to be a little ironic.
I:9805;1776;Jerry McGuire was good, but this movie absolutely ROCKS!!
I:9805;1777;I love this movie, and it get better every time I watch it!
I:9805;1778;Cameron Crowe said it best at the Oscar's, This movie is a love letter to the music industry.
I:9805;1779;I could probably write for pages on what makes this the best movie of the year, ie acting, directing, story, soundtrack.
I:9805;1780;"Crowe finally had the chance to insert the sequences that explained more of his characters, gave him a better piece of mind, and probably told things that wouldn't be understood by the audience (the film originally ran 2 hours long, and the 35 minutes that appear in ""Untitiled"" would probably make some squrim out of boredom in their seats)."
I:9805;1781;But in actuality, William loves Rock and Roll, and he uses his love of music to write reviews and reports for several local and underground papers.
I:9805;1782;One day, Rolling Stone magazine gets ahold of his work, and asks William to do a story for them.
I:9805;1783;She's very informative, and also helps keep the conversation lively.
I:9805;1784;"There's also a longer cut of a scene featuring the band ""Still Water,"" as well as articles Crowe wrote for Rolling Stone in his youth (this film is actually a biopic of his life, with some fiction)."
I:9805;1785;What it's for is a great scene that was cut because they couldn't get the copyright for the song.
I:9805;1786;as an added bonus, there is a 6.
I:9805;1787;Every single song is Excellent!
I:9805;1788;the set contains the original cut of the film on Disc 2, which is a great way to compare the cut for the big screen, and the true director's vision.
I:9805;1789;put some people ( almost all my family didn't like it), but for those that like music, nostalgia, and a film that is really unlike what most people create or experience, this is a great set to get.
I:9805;1790;The best Picture of the year was not nominated.
I:9805;1791;Its was done to perfection, and is one of those rare films that allow you to escape to another time.
I:9805;1792;I rate movies on a simple scale.
I:9805;1793;Excellent film to own and watch over and over again.
I:9805;1794;The sound track is one for the ages.
I:9805;1795;This was without a doubt one of the best movies of all time.
I:9805;1796;So i finally saw it about 7 months ago and just again last night and it definatly explains the life of a rock star.
I:9805;1797;I own this movie and you definatly should too.
I:9805;1798;This film is a love letter to rock music in the 70s and includes heartfelt performances from the entire cast.
I:9805;1799;The music is fun .
I:9805;1800;the relationships are fun .
I:9805;1801;Almost Famous is a great film, but its 'Bootleg' version is even better.
I:9805;1802;yep, I'm definitely in that group!)
I:9805;1803;I myself still feel burned.
I:9805;1804;interesting going on in this movie at any point, on any level, with the possible exception of PSH.
I:9805;1805;It's mindboggling that so many people liked this.
I:9805;1806;The music of the film is also great, and very symbolistic of the early 70's rock era.
I:9805;1807;Now Here is Cameron Crowe's best work ever, and considered by many, including myself, to be the best movie that represents 1960's and 70's Rock And Roll.
I:9805;1808;I love the soundtrack, some of the best songs ever and other rarities of Rock and Roll are included.
I:9805;1809;oK now back to the movie, He picked the best actors for the best parts, like Kate Hudson (who actually is married to a rock star) playing the famous band.
I:9805;1810;And on a closing note, this movie actually takes place at the end of the greatest period in American History, The 60's.
I:9805;1811;A great coming of age story.
I:9805;1812;Kate Hudson was worthy of a Golden Globe.
I:9805;1813;is in love with music.
I:9805;1814;Almost Famous is based on his experience with Led Zeppelin back in the 1970's, and it is a startling and amazing film that intrigued me with its developed characters and viewpoints of live in its set decade.
I:9805;1815;cameron Crowe is really getting on my good side.
I:9805;1816;I loved Jerry Maguire, and thought it was one of the best films of 1996.
I:9805;1817;He's done teen movies, romantic comedies and now Almost Famous is his tribute to music, that has a bit of everything .
I:9805;1818;drama, funny and comical scenes and a mysterious romance.
I:9805;1819;Crowe comes off as a natural in his directing department and his writing skills are even better.
I:9805;1820;Crowe also wrote the film, and he shows true talent for bringing his stories to the screen.
I:9805;1821;the acting in the movie is outstanding.
I:9805;1822;Crudup and Lee are horribly underrated as actors.
I:9805;1823;They gives a very realistic performance of band members struggling on the hard side of rock `n roll and still managing to party on and have a good time.
I:9805;1824;She just has amazing on.
I:9805;1825;Fargo won her Oscar, this one gave her a nomination and in Wonder Boys her underwritten performance was very enjoyable.
I:9805;1826;I strongly recommend seeing how this woman works.
I:9805;1827;"Fugit, the newcomer of the actors, is very human and sweet, however hard his character tries to be ""the enemy"", Fugit comes off as just a cutie on the edge of stardom."
I:9805;1828;Her character is mischievous and mysterious, and Hudson is truly a perfectionist in her role.
I:9805;1829;Balk and Paquin are pretty much there just to look at, but they have some good scenes, especially Balk, who has a hilarious telephone conversation with William's (Fugit) mother.
I:9805;1830;The chemistry between Fugit and Hudson is very believable.
I:9805;1831;I'd love to see them do more work together.
I:9805;1832;the Oscar nominated editing in the film is also a highpoint.
I:9805;1833;The sequences in which the band perform use many techniques and extras to bring the concerts off as believable and exciting.
I:9805;1834;to fully appreciate Almost Famous you have to at least like music a little, and I like music a lot.
I:9805;1835;This movie worked for me on many levels, it had the power to engage me, I had lots of people to care about, and overall I just had a heck of a fun time.
I:9805;1836;welcome to fully official stardom.
I:9805;1837;An amazing score features classic 70's tracks by Elton John and others, with too many classic scenes to mention.
I:9805;1838;If you've not seen this yet do yourself a favor.
I:9805;1839;Great movie, timeless and holds up well.
I:9805;1840;Cameron Crowe is a genius, so many great roles and performances.
I:9805;1841;Why did he take a perfectly serviceable 122.
I:9805;1842;minute movie that appeared to say everything, and turn it into a 162.
I:9805;1843;It blows up Almost Famous , makes it spectacle and spectacular, while never losing its intimate edge.
I:9805;1844;Backstories are fleshed out, relationships are better defined, and the humanity becomes more human.
I:9805;1845;And we get a full.
I:9805;1846;But most of the additional footage comes from existing scenes being lengthened.
I:9805;1847;The second path is the heart.
I:9805;1848;Besides being a doting mother, and quick to offer praise for her son, she also offers some real insights into the genesis of the film.
I:9805;1849;It's amazing to see how much of the movie was really based on actual events.
I:9805;1850;also included on Disc One is real life video footage of an interview with Lester Bangs.
I:9805;1851;Lester's vitriol is palpable, his menacing nature is enormous, but his warmth shines through.
I:9805;1852;It's an interesting tidbit, in that it offers further proof that Hoffman is one of the greatest actors working today, for he doesn't stoop to imitating Lester.
I:9805;1853;Some of the works actually inform specific scenes from the film, which is kind of a neat trick.
I:9805;1854;scenes moments from the Rock Camp the actors had to go through.
I:9805;1855;Also included is the full.
I:9805;1856;The music's not that great, but the vibe, captured by on.
I:9805;1857;stage camera work, is authentic.
I:9805;1858;view, and it's just stunningly beautiful.
I:9805;1859;I think the look and feel enhance the movie.
I:9805;1860;"autobigraphical piece the question is asked ""What do you like about music?"""
I:9805;1861;If your answer is action, sex and fart jokes, this is a movie to stay well away from.
I:9805;1862;the story tells the tale of William Miller, a 15.
I:9805;1863;old aspiring journalist who finds himself working for Rolling Stone, covering the 1973 tour of an almost famous band called Stillwater.
I:9805;1864;The major strong point is the universally superb acting.
I:9805;1865;Patrick Fugit as the young writer holds the screen with striking authority without falling into over acting, reminiscent of John Cusack in one of Crowe's earlier films, Say Anything.
I:9805;1866;He is aptly supported by Kate Hudson, Goldie Hawn's daughter, as the object of William's affection, whose character has arguably the finest scene in the film.
I:9805;1867;"His lyrical waxings are the core of Williams's journey, from ""Hey, I met you."
I:9805;1868;The film itself has a sumptuous look, complimented by an almost painless attention to detail.
I:9805;1869;There were some great films last year, but this one for me took the cake.
I:9805;1870;romance, fun, adventure, drama, comedy, passion, love, heart and soul.
I:9805;1871;It is definately a classic treasure.
I:9805;1872;this Film Works Because the Pacing alone is really cool.
I:9805;1873;You are 17 years old in the mid 1970s and you are on the road tour with the Allman Brothers.
I:9805;1874;Ahead of you in a short time are tours with the Who, Deep Purple, Sabbath, David Bowie, The Eagles, and Led Zeppelin.
I:9805;1875;This movie has so many outstanding character portrayals.
I:9805;1876;That's how powerful this movie can be.
I:9805;1877;The soundtrack is also a must own for any lover of classic rock.
I:9805;1878;but there were some good points.
I:9805;1879;The acting is top notch.
I:9805;1880;The dialogue and direction is natural and engaging.
I:9805;1881;There were one or two moments that made me chuckle with their gentle humor.
I:9805;1882;a good film, not great.
I:9805;1883;It still holds up really well and stands out as being one of the best films to be released this unsteady year.
I:9805;1884;This is one fantastic looking and sounding blu.
I:9805;1885;The colors really shine in this hi.
I:9805;1886;This is well worth the upgrade!
I:9805;1887;It had depth, while being enjoyable.
I:9805;1888;The intensity was at the right level so that it can be a feel good movie, or a serious film.
I:9805;1889;The music played was spectacular, and brought me back to some of my favorite songs.
I:9805;1890;we can relate easily to this movie, because the protagonist is an intelligent, normal kid.
I:9805;1891;The supporting actress (Kate Hudson) is superb in her role.
I:9805;1892;And the band is amazing.
I:9805;1893;This movie was nostalgic for most, and a new adventure for many.
I:9805;1894;This movie was absolutly great.
I:9805;1895;it was well written and very well acted.
I:9805;1896;kate Hudson is most certainly going to have a very good career.
I:9805;1897;The best thing Kate Hudson has ever done.
I:9805;1898;It's made even better by being autobiographical for Cameron Crowe.
I:9805;1899;I mean it, this is truly one of the best movies ever made.
I:9805;1900;It has lies, and decet, drugs, and most importantly music.
I:9805;1901;He gets all his sisters albums when she leaves and decides he waqnts to be a writer for a music magazine, he gets an awesome assignment to go on tour with this 'Allman Brothers/Aerosmith' sounding band and writes this amazing artical for Rolling Stone, and has all of his hopes and dreams crushed to the ground before him in a matter of seconds.
I:9805;1902;And get the soundtrack while your at it as well cause it is amazing like the film!
I:9805;1903;this movie has a great sound track and great castits about a young rock and roll journalist who has an opportunity to have a cover story in rolling stone on the band clear water.
I:9805;1904;this movie definitely deserves the awards it's gotten
I:9805;1905;the film is fun, serious, honest and realistic without ever getting too dark in tone.
I:9805;1906;It's also nice to see Fairuza Balk, such a greatly underrated actress.
I:9805;1907;She was still very good, just not as superb as I had been led to believe.
I:9805;1908;"In short, he's never truly ""free"", restricted by his own emotions for the beautiful Penny Lane."
I:9805;1909;this is a gorgeous film and one that everyone should see.
I:9805;1910;crowe normally has good actors in his films,but in this one,well,all I can say to Patrick Fugit is don't give up your day job.
I:9805;1911;coming fictionalised rock band Stillwater and one of their most special fans, Miss Penny Lane (the excellent Kate Hudson).
I:9805;1912;this has everything you'd expect from a movie about a rock band, girls, drink, drugs, fighting and general excessive bad behaviour but it skilfully avoids ever falling into clich because the characters here are not just rock stars or groupies, they are real people, with human weaknesses and human strengths.
I:9805;1913;Crowe's writing and direction are both subtle and beguiling and he draws extraordinary performances out of all the main leads including Billy Crudup (as lead guitarist and charismatic star of Stillwater), Kate Hudson (as Penny Lane), young Patrick Fugit (as William) and great supporting turns from the finest young character alive at this moment, Philip Seymour Hoffman (as legendary rock journo.
I:9805;1914;i must admit to being a big fan of Cameron Crowe's work ever since seeing Say Anything and Jerry Maguire and unlike the, by all accounts, very disappointing Vanilla Sky, Almost Famous is up there with Crowe's finest work.
I:9805;1915;Great romance, great humour and great warmth, this semi.
I:9805;1916;Whenever I want to Feel what the essence of the 70's were about coupled by it's music and sense of innocence.
I:9805;1917;This is the movie I reach for.
I:9805;1918;Billy Crudup plays the mashup 70s musican that is good enough to make the rock star category and Kate Hudson plays penny lane the ultra cool.
I:9805;1919;together love struck groopy, a real life character all based upon the experiences of Cameron Crowe as he was a teenager who 'Broke.
I:9805;1920;This is Basically the Directors (Cameron Crowe's) Teen age life reenacted perfectly naturally by ,,, and Zoe Deschanel plays his sister, along side a strong cast.
I:9805;1921;Get the Directors Cut it fleshes out the story nicely.
I:9805;1922;Love this movie, I love Kate Hudson in this movie.
I:9805;1923;Such a true as to what that time was like.
I:9805;1924;Zoey Deschanel is another good actress in this movie as well.
I:9805;1925;A true cult classic and under.
I:9805;1926;Brilliant story and great acting.
I:9805;1927;our family quotes this film often, lol.
I:9805;1928;Should be nominated for best picture in OSCARS, its a great movie for guys that like music from the 70s.
I:9805;1929;But i dont recommend this movie to anyone.
I:9805;1930;Just an all around fun movie to watch.
I:9805;1931;Its one of those movies you go back to watch over and over
I:9805;1932;I was charged twice for the same movie and it took forever to load the movie.
I:9805;1933;This is a true classic.
I:9805;1934;Anyone who is at all into music should see it.
I:9805;1935;It's also a great coming.
I:9805;1936;I love it that the lead guitar player of StillWater is egocentric and self.
I:9805;1937;centered yet is still a pretty good guy.
I:9805;1938;Really brings the 70's alive without parodying it.
I:9805;1939;I highly recommend this to anyone who loves character driven movies.
I:9805;1940;My sister received it and was THRILLED.
I:9805;1941;This Bootleg edition is a great gift item.
I:9805;1942;The plot was original, fast.
I:9805;1943;paced, and exciting: a fifteen.year.
I:9805;1944;This movie does a great job of chronicling the musical scene during the 70's, as well as portraying the journalism world accurately and interestingly.
I:9805;1945;The main character is very easy to identify with, and the girl he loves is charming and a great actress.
I:9805;1946;There was a very touching scene with the two of them in the hotel room, as well as several other telling scenes such as on the airplane ride and at the stranger's party.
I:9805;1947;This movie reveals a lot about human character and life in general, and especially about music.
I:9805;1948;I highly recommend this movie to anyone, especially those interested in music and/or writing.
I:9805;1949;It will remind you of your passion and how important it is to follow it no matter what the cost.
I:9805;1950;A very inspiring and uncommonly good movie.
I:9805;1951;I thought this movie shows what really talented filmakers can do.
I:9805;1952;Just when everyone thought movies were going down the drain and noone had an original thought in Hollywood, along comes a movie that breaks those barriers and establishes itself as a classic.
I:9805;1953;The stroty and cast were made for each other and the funny moments were just as tender as the sad moments.
I:9805;1954;aide Penny Lane (Kate Hudson in a star making, Oscar nominated role), who will introduce him to the fast paced world of rock stars.
I:9805;1955;Guitarist Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup in a perfomance that definitely deserved an Oscar nomination), is the first to take a liking to William, and the two will form a bond that is held together by Penny.
I:9805;1956;while traveling with the band, city after city, William is no closer to the angle of his story, but with the help of legendary writer Lester Bangs (Philip Seymour Hoffman), he may come up with the story of a lifetime, and learn some important lesson's on life.
I:9805;1957;"Almost Famous is the best movie of the year, it is PACKED with superb performances
I:9805;1958;roll world of the 1970's,Funny, touching, and totally entertaining, Almost Famous is a MUST see!Nick Gonnella
I:9805;1959;Almost Famous is the best movie I've ever seen.
I:9805;1960;I was born a generation too late to experience the 60's and 70's (grr) but I got a pretty good idea of what they were like.
I:9805;1961;I liked how at the beginning the kid is going through all the records.
I:9805;1962;i thought that was neat.
I:9805;1963;that movie was the best!
I:9805;1964;This movie is based on music, this movie revolves around music, this movie lives on it`s music.
I:9805;1965;One might have the impression that the movie's makers had an easy one producing this movie, because never again did us humans have such a creative Phase as towards the end of the sixties, and the music makes this movie what it is.
I:9805;1966;Anyhow, as we see on MTV every day, Music's effect on us is even bigger when it has a good music.
I:9805;1967;"Pretty eyed ,pirate smile, you'll marry a music man""."
I:9805;1968;"Elton John's classic ""Tiny Dancer"" is about a girl in the sixties , a groupie."
I:9805;1969;"She believes to be better than the ""regular"" Groupie, she actually doesn't consider herself to be one, but as someone who loves music and for this reason spends so much time with the band called ""Stillwater""."
I:9805;1970;Indeed also she's just one of the toys available to play with for the band and the crew, especially for self.
I:9805;1971;Joining them on their journey is the film's main character William Miller (Peter Fugit).
I:9805;1972;mogul Lester Bangs (Philip Seymour Hoffman) tells him, but he knows everything about modern music and is very ambitous to become one of the big time music.
I:9805;1973;She plays an important role in this context.
I:9805;1974;But she aswell has to accept that the times they are a changin and her son is changing ,too.
I:9805;1975;Patrick Fugit has a great film.
I:9805;1976;debut and embodies the uncool genius with the advantage of being loved by everyone he meets.
I:9805;1977;The entire cast of the movie did a great job in expressing the time's feelings and emotions but the greatest contribution is done by the music.
I:9805;1978;This movie has one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard in hollywood and gives you the creeps in many parts of the movie.
I:9805;1979;The times of the groupies are over, but is that a positive cognition?
I:9805;1980;I truly enjoyed this film, over.
I:9805;1981;There are far too many wonderful scenes, great joints of dialogue, and an overflow of brooding young men and women.
I:9805;1982;i think the greatest flaw in this movie .
I:9805;1983;is that there are simply too many great performances and too many fascinating characters for the film to center itself.
I:9805;1984;I'm positive that the director's cut is the version to see.
I:9805;1985;story, supporting roles, and important moments.
I:9805;1986;The director's cut is over forty minutes longer, and I look forward to seeing it.
I:9805;1987;By far, this is Cameron Crowe's best effort yet.
I:9805;1988;cameron Crowe hits it outta the park with his semi.
I:9805;1989;"If you dig music or coming of age flicks, this is a ""gotta see."""
I:9805;1990;Great movie with a great soundtrack.
I:9805;1991;The story pulls you in and you can't help but like the main character.
I:9805;1992;William Miller, a 15 year old aspiring rock journalist of the 70's, lies about his age and goes on tour with the upcoming band of the moment Stillwater to do an interview for Rolling Stone magazine.
I:9805;1993;Kate Hudson plays Penny Lane, the gorgeous wild.
I:9805;1994;this is a great movie .
I:9805;1995;definitely one of my favorites of all time.
I:9805;1996;this director's edition bootleg cut is great to own .
I:9805;1997;songs of the band that you can take with you in the car!
I:9805;1998;The movie also has a great soundtrack that was put together by Crowe's wife, Nancy Wilson (guitarist from the 70's/80's band Heart)Great movie, highly recommended!!!
I:9805;1999;Because it got overwhelmingly good reviews, I had high hopes for this film .
I:9805;2000;the fictional band at the heart of the action .
I:9805;2001;now, I have the best of both worlds: An absolutely gorgeous Blu.
I:9805;2002;"ray version of the extended ""Almost Famous"" movie with a terrific English 5.1 DTS."
I:9805;2003;"ray version of the ""Bootleg Cut"" to a large retail chain store."
I:9805;2004;"i have been reading reviews of the previous extended version of ""Almost Famous"" with great interest."
I:9805;2005;It's an amazing experience that will go down in film history forever.
I:9805;2006;It has an amazing cast and amazing story.
I:9805;2007;It's hilarious and sad at the same time.
I:9805;2008;He finally catches his break when Rolling Stone stumbles upon his writing and decides to give him a chance.
I:9805;2009;the movie really has some amazing performances.
I:9805;2010;Phillip Seymour Hoffman has an incredible supporting role.
I:9805;2011;It really is one of his best performances of his career.
I:9805;2012;Billy Crudup, has the best performance of his career, as the troubled guitarist of the band Stillwater.
I:9805;2013;Patrick Fugit, William Miller, has the best performance as the troubled young journalist.
I:9805;2014;The supporting cast is also very good.
I:9805;2015;the direction and writing of Cameron Crowe, are both flawless.
I:9805;2016;In my opinion, the Untitled version is a much better experience.
I:9805;2017;Enjoy every second of the wonderful experience.
I:9805;2018;What do you love about music?
I:9805;2019;that's one of my favorites quotes of the film.
I:9805;2020;Smart and realistic dialogue, mood, story, feeling, and above all real emotion.
I:9805;2021;Every single actor and actress hit the right notes.
I:9805;2022;If you forgot the reason of the existence of motion pictures then watch, live and experience this amazing and magical creation.
I:9805;2023;THe movie is marvellous, touching, redempting.
I:9805;2024;tHis is a fine movie.
I:9805;2025;It just has sense to it that makes it a good movie, and it's just pure fun!William is a 15 year old who wants to become a critic and he catches up with a rock n roll band StillWater and travels with them while he talks with his mom and she gives him details to not take drugs.
I:9805;2026;SO he gets caught up in a friendship with guitarist Russ, and the band seems to always be fighting and Russ is sleeping with Penny, who claims she is a band.
I:9805;2027;And Penny tries to kill herself after Russ introduces his wife to her, and that is when William tells Penny that he is in love with her.
I:9805;2028;And so the story goes.
I:9805;2029;it was a very capturing movie.
I:9805;2030;It will deffinitaly become one of my favorite movies of all time!
I:9805;2031;ray because I switched over to digital downloads a while back and now having this one disc is another thing for me to keep track of and who knows maybe it would be worth it.
I:9805;2032;this Bootleg Edition fixes that and makes the movie amazing.
I:9805;2033;cleans up scenes and plot points for you to really understand how things developed.
I:9805;2034;Expands a lot on Russell and Penny's story and Penny's story overall.
I:9805;2035;One of the best added scenes was the expanded walk into Rolling Stones at the end.
I:9805;2036;overall: If you thought the original was good you will love the extended edition and if you thought the original was missing stuff then watch this and you will discover why so many love this film.
I:9805;2037;There is always SOMETHING unique about every movie this man has been a part of.
I:9805;2038;hour smile on my face, at the same time remembering a bunch of adolescent memories like my first girlfriend, my first kiss, the first time I got to experience real freedom away from home.
I:9805;2039;And I am sure I'm not alone here, because what made this film so wonderful is that it has provoked similar memories in those that saw this wonderful film.
I:9805;2040;The 'main menu' has a choice of 'special features', 'scene index', 'audio options' and 'subtitles'.
I:9805;2041;The Making Of special is a nice look into the film, with interviews by many cast members.
I:9805;2042;(I'm an editor, I notice stuff like this).
I:9805;2043;The 'scene index' is wonderful.
I:9805;2044;It has a title for each scene and moving menus which create a very attractive screen.
I:9805;2045;Reading these articles makes you realize what a terrific writer Cameron Crowe is, and how much of a pleasure it must be to read his scripts.
I:9805;2046;now to the technical stuff about the movie.
I:9805;2047;I was very VERY impressed with this beautiful anamorphic widescreen transfer.
I:9805;2048;The cinematography in this film is wonderful.
I:9805;2049;Colors are beautifully rendered, blacks are rich and the concert footage is gorgeous.
I:9805;2050;The audio is also wonderful.
I:9805;2051;Ambience sounds are surrounding and the music is outstanding.
I:9805;2052;If you watch this on a surround system, the concert footage will envelope your ears and bring you right into the show.
I:9805;2053;I was even impressed with the audio on a 2 speaker system.
I:9805;2054;Having the dialogue strictly centered makes the concert footage EXPLODE!
I:9805;2055;The sound design is terrific, clean, clear and beautifully recorded.
I:9805;2056;(Yes, I found myself singing Tiny Dancer.
I:9805;2057;In conclusion, Almost Famous is one of my favorite films from the past few years.
I:9805;2058;It's full of emotion and PERFECTLY casted with wonderful performance from all involved.
I:9805;2059;If you ARE a teen, trust me, you'll still enjoy this movie.
I:9805;2060;i think you may love this film!
I:9805;2061;You'll laugh, cry and go through all the emotions a Cameron Crowe movie brings out of us.
I:9805;2062;A terrific film documenting a young man's coming of age in the music industry.
I:9805;2063;Anything that Cameron Crowe has ever made is worth watching.
I:9805;2064;He has this knack for writing real, down.
I:9805;2065;aids, William's own personal struggle of finding out who he is , what's he's capable of as an aspiring 15 year old rock journalist, and his personal struggle to fit in to a crowd not of his own.
I:9805;2066;Crowe's Oscar for best original screenplay is long, long overdue and well.
I:9805;2067;"I'll address the latter group in a second
I:9805;2068;The story revolves around a young 15 year.
I:9805;2069;The film has a few brief concert sequences of the band on stage, but these are secondary to the behind the scenes look at the band and how life on the road changes those involved.
I:9805;2070;If you like films about teens coming of age or just a film that is a well.
I:9805;2071;written balance of laughs and poignancy then this is one you'll enjoy.
I:9805;2072;This one is character driven and intelligent.
I:9805;2073;I also have to make a special mention of the soundtrack (being a huge music buff): the songs included in the film are a great mix of popular stuff and lesser.
I:9805;2074;They are based on Mr. Crowe's own family's struggles and the fact that he was willing to air his family's problems in public adds a touch of humanity and reality to the film.
I:9805;2075;They have a natural fear of the press and refer to William as the enemy.
I:9805;2076;In fact, William struggles to get an one on one interview with Russell throughout the film.
I:9805;2077;Their leader is Penny Lane played wonderfully by Kate Hudson.
I:9805;2078;She is in love with Russell, but it is William whom she confides in.
I:9805;2079;The tender relationship between Penny William is one of the film's great strengths.
I:9805;2080;Throughout the film, William seeks and gets advice from legendary rock critic Lester Bangs.
I:9805;2081;Mr. Hoffman provides the film's conscious and his brief time on the screen is electric.
I:9805;2082;All the performances in the film are first.
I:9805;2083;rate including Ms. Hudson who is luminous, Mr. Crudup is brooding and dark, Mr. Lee is self.
I:9805;2084;But the most startling performance is that of Patrick Fugit as William.
I:9805;2085;He plays William perfectly and captures the essence of what Mr. Crowe was trying to capture.
I:9805;2086;Mr. Crowe guides the film with an eye for detail as the sets and feeling are completely real and harkens the spirit of the 70's.
I:9805;2087;His screenplay perfectly balances drama and comedy and has some of the sharpest dialogue in a long time.
I:9805;2088;Mr. Crowe took home a Best Original Screenplay Oscar at the 2000 Academy Awards for this great script.
I:9805;2089;The film is easily his most personal, but it is the personal touch he adds that gives the film its universal appeal.
I:9805;2090;The story centers around a teenager traveling with a rock band, during the early 1970s, while fulfilling journalistic duties.
I:9805;2091;The previews made this movie look much better than it actually was.
I:9805;2092;, but a true believer in good cinema.
I:9805;2093;Anyway, I bought the disc and let me say that it is his best work.
I:9805;2094;Right up there with Say Anything.
I:9805;2095;Give Untitled a chance and you won't be.
I:9805;2096;From beginning to end, I really loved this movie.
I:9805;2097;Its cast alone is enough to please even the harshest of Cameron Crowe's critics.
I:9805;2098;His performance is truly groundbreaking and I don't mind saying that he's got even the rest of this awesome cast beat!
I:9805;2099;As with most of his portrayals, he has a way of stealing his scenes very subtly.
I:9805;2100;Kate Hudson does an adequate job of pulling Fugit's character into what he's supposed to observe from the outside.
I:9805;2101;I prefer the more suble performances of Anna Paquin (an Oscar winner, you will remember) and Fairuza Balk.
I:9805;2102;They play just as convincingly the fan roles, or truly, the groupies.
I:9805;2103;She has been so good in so many things lately (e. g. hurlyBurly, and she was even excellent in the X. men movie, however little it allowed her to show off her acting chops).
I:9805;2104;Anyhow, with an outstanding cast and very good story writing, this movie really pulls it off.
I:9805;2105;Well, in my opinion, this one is right up there!
I:9805;2106;What can be said about this movie that hasn't already been said by everyone else, this has got to be the finest film of 2000 and here's my opinion why: Director Cameron Crowe, who I should remind is famous for overdoing the drama like a drama queen in dinner theatre ( Jerry McGuire is a fine movie, but please, hold the extra cheese on our emotions.
I:9805;2107;pours his heart out on film, and does it with respect to his then profession.
I:9805;2108;He kindly views the groupies.
I:9805;2109;In the end, it feels as if we went through a journey of profound wonder that just like the main character, we see the world as it really is.
I:9805;2110;I hope you see this film and love it as I loved it.
I:9805;2111;This is truely a journey worth taking.
I:9805;2112;Almost Famous is charming and you can watch it with your older teens.
I:9805;2113;Roaming the world in bus and jet like gypsies, that's really cool for a little while.
I:9805;2114;The actors are okay, the sets look rock.
I:9805;2115;In film, the era is sanitized for paying customers, my teens and the nostalgic baby boomers.
I:9805;2116;Penny Lane is sure nice for a really bad girl.
I:9805;2117;Read the screenplay and it's as good as the movie.
I:9805;2118;Oscar nomminations don't come often for most rising stars.
I:9805;2119;Seldom do most stars continue excellent careers after there Oscar success.
I:9805;2120;The film follows the journey of an ambitious and budding teen boy who was given the assignment to write an article . . . for Rolling Stones.
I:9805;2121;The characters bring most attention to themselves because you can laugh, cry and feel every emotion.
I:9805;2122;The nomination was perfect for the role she did.
I:9805;2123;Now we can see her work up the ladder to winning Best Actress in a Motion Picture.
I:9805;2124;She is only starting and has a lifetime of career ahead of her.
I:9805;2125;There is a jinkes to Best Supporting.
I:9805;2126;has the sweetness and honesty characteristic of all crowe movies.
I:9805;2127;great performances in the lead as well as kate hudson, billy crudup and others.
I:9805;2128;ALMOST FAMOUS is truly the greatest film ever made.
I:9805;2129;I never even knew I'd enjoy this kind of film.
I:9805;2130;old who doesn't normally like rock 'n' roll but a teen Pop fanatic who loves the Backstreet Boys instead of Led Zeppelin loved this film!
I:9805;2131;good, smart comedy that takes place in 1973.
I:9805;2132;William Miller (Patrick Fugit) is an extremely smart young teenager who, even though he is only fifteen, is a senior in high school.
I:9805;2133;William manages to get his reluclent mother to let him do this, and he goes to the Black Sabbeth concert.
I:9805;2134;Finally, Rolling Stone magazine calls William and asks him to do an interview with Stillwater, which takes him on an incredible journey.
I:9805;2135;experience with Stillwater, where he eventually becomes friends with the band, especially close to the band's lead guitarist, Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup), and the beautiful, but mysterious band aid follower, Penny Lane (Kate Hudson).
I:9805;2136;aLMOST FAMOUS has humor in it's own right.
I:9805;2137;The cleaver, original script and screenplay is only a part of this masterpiece.
I:9805;2138;The actors are a large piece of the masterpiece .
I:9805;2139;the chemistry between all the actors is the thing that holds this film together.
I:9805;2140;All the actors are perfect for their roles .
I:9805;2141;from Patrick Fugit, who is a truly gifted actor, to Jason Lee, who plays the lead singer for Stillwater.
I:9805;2142;looked by the Academy for Best Picture.
I:9805;2143;I was glad that ALMOST FAMOUS won Best Original Screenplay, which it deserved, but it should have won more Awards.
I:9805;2144;And I think Kate Hudson deserved the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress more than that other woman who won it.
I:9805;2145;this, by all means, is my favorite film of all time .
I:9805;2146;I recommend this film for anybody .
I:9805;2147;you don't even have to like rock 'n' roll to enjoy this film.
I:9805;2148;Easily my choice for the best movie of 2000, it's a shame it was a shame that AF was overlooked for a Best Picture nomination.
I:9805;2149;At least the Academy did right by it by giving it the screenplay Oscar.
I:9805;2150;I especially enjoyed the 'making of' with the interviews and the addition of the actual Rolling Stone articles by Cameron Crowe.
I:9805;2151;The day I received it, all I wanted to do was finish work so I could go home and relive the great experience that this movie is.
I:9805;2152;The acting is superb and fresh.
I:9805;2153;Stillwater, the fictional band that everyone wishes were real, has that classic rock presence that today's real bands could learn from.
I:9805;2154;When I saw this film for the first time, I remembered why it is I loved movies and couldn't wait to go and see it again.
I:9805;2155;first off, this is a great movie for fans of rock movies.
I:9805;2156;At times it shows some of the comic genius of Spinal Tap (especially the scene in the aeroplane).
I:9805;2157;The fictional band Stillwater have some great early 70s tunes that really take you back (or take you there, depending on how old you are.)
I:9805;2158;Almost famous is really an exploration of the meaning of friendship.
I:9805;2159;tour world where every relationship is as shallow as a one night stand, William unwittingly shows what real friendship can be, and calls those around him to live up to the best in themselves.
I:9805;2160;It far surpassed my expectations.
I:9805;2161;The story line, acting and of course the great music ranks this movie as one that I enjoy watching over and over and never tire of.
I:9805;2162;The actors portraying the band Stillwater are so believable I wish they were an actual band.
I:9805;2163;I viewed the film today for the first time and oh my I must say that this has to be one of the greatest films of last year and truly one of the best of all time.
I:9805;2164;Cameron Crowe is really a genuis, the writing in this film is just phenomenal.
I:9805;2165;Patrick Fugit is an incredible actor, he has such heart in this film especially when speaking with Penny Lane about how Russell really cares about her.
I:9805;2166;You really forget that you are watching Kate Hudson on the screen and you think you are watching Penny Lane, and that is what great acting is all about and very few films and actors have the ability to do that anymore.
I:9805;2167;Frances gives one of the best performances of the movie, behind Kate and Patrick, who just hold the whole movie together.
I:9805;2168;Patrick is the innocense and Kate is the heart.
I:9805;2169;Penny is in love with the music, she is there as a fan who is in awe of the music along with her other bandaids.
I:9805;2170;So I give him credit.
I:9805;2171;this is really a movie about the love of music, finding your true self and just having a helluva time expeirencing and meeting new people.
I:9805;2172;I encourage everyone to see this film and I promise you that will not regret it.
I:9805;2173;Even if you hate Kate Hudson you will appreciate her just for giving you the pleasure of seeing her perofrmance.
I:9805;2174;Yeah it was so cool being part of the scene.
I:9805;2175;Oh well I'll be back in a minute.
I:9805;2176;Oh yeah so as I say I dug the movie.
I:9805;2177;Almost Famous is one of my favorite movies of all time.
I:9805;2178;I loved this movie when it first came out and thought it was really awesome.
I:9805;2179;ray edition with the director's cut on it.
I:9805;2180;I immediately bought this movie and watched the very awesome director's cut and all my questions were answered.
I:9805;2181;I'm very glad I can watch both versions, but I definitely prefer the director's cut over the original.
I:9805;2182;ray player, go get one!
I:9805;2183;That is, unless they include great dialogue, comedy and drama, top.
I:9805;2184;notch performances and a fantastic soundtrack.
I:9805;2185;Against the odds, Fugit works his way into the inner circle of the band, initially winning their respect through his knowledge of their music.
I:9805;2186;month odyssey during which Patrick follows the band as it tours and grows from a second.
I:9805;2187;tier rock group into superstars.
I:9805;2188;Several compelling relationships develop along the way, including a unique friendship between William and the band's guitarist, Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup), and a touching bond between William and Penny Lane (Kate Hudson), a Stillwater groupie who prefers to be referred to as a Band.
I:9805;2189;You bet your a. the brilliant ensemble cast wonderfully compliments Crowe's razor.
I:9805;2190;In the lead role, the underrated Fugit is utterly believable.
I:9805;2191;Academy Award nominee Hudson gives a performance that's simultaneously sexy, strong and vulnerable.
I:9805;2192;Crudup is by turns obnoxious, kind, egotistical and funny.
I:9805;2193;The best movies often draw you into their world and allow you to share their characters' fears, loves, sadness and joy.
I:9805;2194;"In ""Almost Famous,"" we share William's exhilaration as he lives the life of a rock star, and his sadness as he experiences the darker side of life and love."
I:9805;2195;Almost Famous is the rare film that earns its feel.
I:9805;2196;good sentiment by showing us the humor and heartbreak along the way to achieving it.
I:9805;2197;This is truely one of the best movies I've come across this year.
I:9805;2198;, but it reflects the true meaning and feeling of a real fan.
I:9805;2199;I'm sure you'll enjoy this movie.
I:9805;2200;What I found most interesting was how the movie explored the relationship between journalist and celebrity and how one feeds off of and uses the other and vice versa.
I:9805;2201;The fact that this movie did not get nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars proves, again, that the truly great films are all beyond reach.
I:9805;2202;good telling about life on the road with a Rock And Roll Band Kate Hudson And Fairuza Balk Were Excellent in it
I:9805;2203;and this movie easily made the cut.
I:9805;2204;Well worth purchasing, and now let's hope that Crowe issues a Vol.
I:9805;2205;This is a wonderful, sensitive film that develops a number of themes: finding a mentor, making your first foray into the world, discovering what (relative) failures most of us are as people, and of course, the decline of rock in the 1970s.
I:9805;2206;It is amazingly successful at all this, and for kids there is a lot to learn from it.
I:9805;2207;wrote my life somewhat while enjoying this adventure of youth!
I:9805;2208;It is lovely, sad, and uplifting.
I:9805;2209;This is a great director.
I:9805;2210;This is one of those rare films that brings you right back into the 1970's.
I:9805;2211;"The excitement, the decadence, the long hair and beards, the earth shoes, and the great rock 'n' roll music that was as thick in the air as the smoke
I:9805;2212;director Cameron Crowe's own life, the story of the adventures of young William Miller (played to innocent man.
I:9805;2213;rock band Stillwater during their romps with groupies, prostitutes, and assorted druggies, held my attention from beginning to end.
I:9805;2214;Let's begin with the excellent, and informative, writing from the pen of Cameron Crowe, who saw it all at such a tender young age.
I:9805;2215;Let's continue on with the well.
I:9805;2216;out characters, who are so real and yet always seem to have that magical way of revealing something about themselves in nearly everything they say.
I:9805;2217;Let's conclude with the always.
I:9805;2218;compelling story, which has many twists and turns, yet never feels contrived.
I:9805;2219;all in all, this film has it all.
I:9805;2220;key starring debut of Patrick Fugit, we have a wonderful, fully.
I:9805;2221;"realized performance from Billy Crudup (one of the best actors of his generation
I:9805;2222;Also impressive is the realistic performance of egotistical lead singer Jeff Bebe by Jason Lee.
I:9805;2223;making performance of Goldie Hawn's beautiful progeny, Kate Hudson, in an extremely well.
I:9805;2224;This was one of the five best films of 2000.
I:9805;2225;But an entertaining movie with a bot of true heart, and eminently watchable.
I:9805;2226;"Cameron Crowe's highly personal and slightly fictionalized 70's coming of age musical road trip with a Led Zeppleny kind of band gets an extended director's cut and an utterly amazing commentary with Crowe and his mom in ""ALMOST FAMOUS: THE BOOTLEG CUT."
I:9805;2227;Sentimental and sweet, this simple, attempt at a feel good movie evokes a bygone era and the tunes that underscored (and undermined?)
I:9805;2228;It is a story about a naive boy (William Miller) who has the most exciting experience of his life when he is given the chance to cover the US tour of a new band, stillwater, for Rolling Stone magazine.
I:9805;2229;During this trip, William becomes more mature and aware of what happens on rock shows backstages, which represents a new world to him.
I:9805;2230;Doing his job, he mets some groupie girls, who belong to music bands universe and make this film even better.
I:9805;2231;the soundtrack is great and the characters have complex plots.
I:9805;2232;The cast was very well chosen, and the best performers in scene are Kate Hudson, as the crazy groupie penny lane , and Philip Seymour Hoffman, who has a small part, but does it extremely well, as always.
I:9805;2233;Most part of the film she is worried with her son, and the influence sex, drugs and rock'n roll may cause in his teenage life.
I:9805;2234;I also enjoyed the groupies girls .
I:9805;2235;In order to fully understand this movie, it is necessary to watch this special, in which Cameron Crowe reveals how autobiographical this film is, showing real pictures he took with rock stars on the 70's and also telling us about his early days experiences at show backstages.
I:9805;2236;as over 150 critics agreed: Almost Famous is one of the top 10 films of the year!
I:9805;2237;This will work on any American player and the clarity is remarkable.
I:9805;2238;I'm extremely happy that I picked this up while I had the chance!
I:9805;2239;Love the soundtrack, love the actors/actresses (Kate Hudson).
I:9805;2240;The rest of the cast was spectacular.
I:9805;2241;The ending is such a bittersweet ending.
I:9805;2242;"What makes ""Almost Famous"" so much fun to watch is that it manages to capture a glimpse of the pop culture past without ever becoming heavy."
I:9805;2243;It clearly loves the rock music world it is exploring, yet the film is also clear.
I:9805;2244;"As he did in ""Jerry Maguire,"" writer/director Cameron Crowe shows himself to be a master at mixing disparate moods and exploring universal truths within the context of a light romantic comedy."
I:9805;2245;"based on Crowe's own experiences as a teenaged rock journalist, ""Almost Famous"" tells the unusual story of a 15."
I:9805;2246;William also observes how fame, fortune and recognition often require a compromising of both artistic integrity and the musical purity that made the members want to be rock stars in the first place.
I:9805;2247;Like all the members of the team, as well as the hangers.
I:9805;2248;on, groupies and roadies, William is drawn to rock and roll because it speaks to some indefinable need in his soul .
I:9805;2249;On the contrary, Crowe keeps the proceedings light, airy and fast.
I:9805;2250;paced thanks to the fact that William himself always remains such a clear.
I:9805;2251;eyed, steady and likable young man.
I:9805;2252;William is the anchor that helps keep Crowe's movie real.
I:9805;2253;eyed fifteen year old seems far more mature and emotionally grounded than all the older people he is involved with.
I:9805;2254;"These include the band's handsome lead guitarist, Russell Hammond, and a beautiful, sweet and radiant ""band."
I:9805;2255;As Penny, Kate Hudson literally lights up the screen with warmth, sincerity and vulnerability every time she appears in a scene.
I:9805;2256;She is truly a natural.
I:9805;2257;Billy Crudup conveys just the right combination of arrogance and good.
I:9805;2258;natured insecurity to make Russell a complex and believable individual.
I:9805;2259;tight, but obviously loving mother, who can do little but stand back in open.
I:9805;2260;"mouthed astonishment, aghast at the ""immoral"" lifestyle of the people who have ""kidnapped"" her child."
I:9805;2261;the strength she has imparted to him .
I:9805;2262;will triumph in the end.
I:9805;2263;Thus, she reluctantly and anxiously allows him to fulfill his dream.
I:9805;2264;"lovers of early `70's ""classic"" rock will adore the sound, the look and the general time capsule feel of the film."
I:9805;2265;"Crowe has gotten all the ""accoutrements"" of the period absolutely right ."
I:9805;2266;Almost Famous is a movie to relax into, especially if you yourself came of age in that era.
I:9805;2267;The film captures the early 70's in lovely tint of nostalgia.
I:9805;2268;Adding to this is the excellent musical selections.
I:9805;2269;Not only do they fit the period, but they tie into the movie as well.
I:9805;2270;acting is solid all around.
I:9805;2271;It doesn't matter, he does a great job.
I:9805;2272;I'm not a huge fan of Kate Hudson, but she does a great job as Penny Lane.
I:9805;2273;It's still my favorite part she's played, and I think she'll have a hard time topping it.
I:9805;2274;Instead it gives the viewer a cozy feeling.
I:9805;2275;The ending is never really in doubt, but the journey is what makes it work.
I:9805;2276;Crow's direction is solid and involving.
I:9805;2277;this is one entertaining movie.
I:9805;2278;It skillfully combines comedy, romance, drama and nostalgia, balancing the mixture perfectly.
I:9805;2279;Any fans of music or coming of age stories will find plenty to enjoy here.
I:9805;2280;Almost Famous is a great movie.
I:9805;2281;fueled haze, and teenagers across America worshipped at the altar of Led Zeppelin with a fervor thought reserved by Star Trek fans, it tells the story of William Miller, a high.
I:9805;2282;"A steady stream of sex with the band's dedicated groupies (called ""Band."
I:9805;2283;Adding to Miller's stress is his own burgeoning love for Band.
I:9805;2284;Almost is a great movie, one of those understated gems from director Cameron Crowe.
I:9805;2285;Though an anthem to 70's rock fandom, the film excels on its characters .
I:9805;2286;Like a band, the film excels not only on solo acts but also on how the characters impact each other .
I:9805;2287;Above all, the script drips with tasty lines, bizarrely unforgettable zen koans (like the one about groupies who eat steak but don't use birth control) and a fair amount of period rock references.
I:9805;2288;Music fans will recognize real people in the characters.
I:9805;2289;Mrs. Des Barres real life attitude and experiences are more than a little reflected in Miss Penny Lane, played by Kate Hudson.
I:9805;2290;Cameron Crowe deserved his Oscar for this wonderful movie's delightful screenplay.
I:9805;2291;"Almost Famous is one of those movies that stays with you
I:9805;2292;The movie genuinely surprises you, and carries with it the ring of truth, in its situations, its dialog and its depiction of an era in time.
I:9805;2293;The soundtrack captivates the early 70s rush of rock/pop, and evokes the wistful feeling of adolescence, possibility and yearning .
I:9805;2294;the perfect complement to Crowe's autobiographical screenplay.
I:9805;2295;superior in every conceivable way.
I:9805;2296;Luckily, this Untitled version was great, and improved on an already good movie.
I:9805;2297;The commentary with writer/director Cameron Crowe and others (including his own mother, no less) is worth a listen, if only to hear some of the details Crowe gives into the making of this film and stories from his experiences on the road in the 70's.
I:9805;2298;This is a great movie.
I:9805;2299;You'll laugh and be close to tears.
I:9805;2300;Cameron Crowe has led a fascinating life and now enjoys an exceptional career in film.
I:9805;2301;This movie and the stories written about it, allow you to see that the influence of his college professor mother may have developed a base of knowledge to springboard him into a writing career.
I:9805;2302;Having enjoyed Crowes' masterpieces such as Ridgemont High and Jerry McGuire , I'll always watch his work and feel privileged to have experienced his autobiography.
I:9805;2303;the movie itself has exceptional casting.
I:9805;2304;Crudup as the rock star was perfect.
I:9805;2305;Kate Hudson as the groupie added an innocent charm that really pulled the movie together and generates the emotional response from the crowd.
I:9805;2306;And the newcomer who played a young Cameron Crowe really projected a sweetness of adolesence.
I:9805;2307;there's really two overlapping parts to the movie, his life touring with rock bands which is funny and amazing, and his family's stuggles with how he and his sister handle growing up.
I:9805;2308;But the family story adds a charm to the movie and makes you think to some of your interpersonal battle with loved ones.
I:9805;2309;I went with 6 other people and to a person, everyone loved it.
I:9805;2310;Their ages ranged from 47 to 24 with most in their 20's.
I:9805;2311;this is a great movie and will definitely be in my video library.You'll like this movie if you like pop or rock music, or experienced the 70s and want to go back for a second look.
I:9805;2312;I thought that this movie provided a mixture of emotions whichI think is very important in a movie.
I:9805;2313;It had very talentedactors and actresses who played their roles perfectly.
I:9805;2314;KateHudson and Patrick Fugit were excellent and made the moviewhat it is.
I:9805;2315;I thought this was a very well told story about the excesses of rock and roll music, music journalism, fandom and groupies.
I:9805;2316;Most movies on this topic tend to be overly cynical or over romanticized, and I appreciated that it was done from such an honest perspective.
I:9805;2317;i especially appreciated the line spoken by one of the old.
I:9805;2318;Although I am not, and never have been a groupie by any stretch of the imagination I am an avid rock/pop music aficionado, I thought that line in the movie captured the spirit and sentiment of die.
I:9805;2319;"and I thought he demonstrated that well when developing the characer of ""Penny Lane."
I:9805;2320;"It sure was fun to hear ""Go All The Way"" by the Raspberries as well as ""Tiny Dancer"" by Elton John."
I:9805;2321;I was born in the 70s, and I love the music, but the lifestyles and the culture of the time doesn't hold a lot of allure for me.
I:9805;2322;the characters were pretty much all likeable.
I:9805;2323;I loved Russell, even though he could be a jerk.
I:9805;2324;kate Hudson's performance in this movie was touching and endearing.
I:9805;2325;She captured the magnetism and wisdom and vulnerability that was required for this role.
I:9805;2326;Yes, wisdom, because Penny Lane was very wise about the lifestyle they were leading.
I:9805;2327;Billy Crudup did a fantastic job, and Patrick Fugit shone in his role.
I:9805;2328;Phillip Seymour Hoffman was also great as William's mentor, Lester Bangs.
I:9805;2329;the climax and resolution were certainly unexpected, but I thought it was an appropriate way to end this story.
I:9805;2330;"this movie also provides a great quote
I:9805;2331;All in all I give this movie a hearty recommendation.
I:9805;2332;This is an awesome movie.
I:9805;2333;A chance to become more deeply lost in one of the best movies about being in a band.
I:9805;2334;And the extra backstory, music and scenes alone don't automatically make this the definitive version.
I:9805;2335;The audio commentary makes you appreciate how much of the movie was based on Cameron's real experiences and how much detail went into each scene.
I:9805;2336;Clearly, it was a labor of love and it shows.
I:9805;2337;You'll just feel good if you go see this movie.
I:9805;2338;Kate Hudson is as sparkling as the glitter that surrounds her.
I:9805;2339;eyed an innocent as you could hope for.
I:9805;2340;This is one of my favorite films and I love using Amazon because I always get what I ordered with out hassle!
I:9805;2341;"Wow, never have I seen a movie that came so close to what it was ""really"" like to grow up in the 70's!!"
I:9805;2342;The actors were right on the mark with clothes, and the music was exact.
I:9805;2343;It is one of my favourite movies of all time and never gets old, regardless of how many times I've seen it.
I:9805;2344;The story takes place in 1973, when real music ruled the world and people turned their love for it into a lifestyle.
I:9805;2345;It's a life I've often fantasized about myself, and I know I'm not alone there.
I:9805;2346;william, the band, and their faithful Band.
I:9805;2347;The story is dynamic and offers a lot to the viewer, including a fantastic resolution at the end.
I:9805;2348;This is the ultimate movie for music lover.
I:9805;2349;This is one of the best movies of 2000!
I:9805;2350;Aside from all the Oscar stuff, let me just say it now: This movie is amazing!
I:9805;2351;All the performances are right on target!
I:9805;2352;First to applaud the performances.
I:9805;2353;Even the characters that aren't big parts are great.
I:9805;2354;I loved Fariuza Balk and Zooey Desmerack (I don't think I spelled that right at all) whose characters had small but pretty important parts.
I:9805;2355;Fugit gives a wonderful debut.
I:9805;2356;He's adorable with his dimples and his innocence.
I:9805;2357;"Almost Famous has all the right ingredients to be a success
I:9805;2358;The movie is impossible to dislike it, mainly because it is crafted with such heart.
I:9805;2359;felt sincerity, and it helps greatly when the array of performances shine from beginning to end.
I:9805;2360;In terms of touching upon issues such as growing up and realizing your own identity, Almost Famous does a fairly effective job using the 70's rock.
I:9805;2361;It is evident that Cameron Crowe is infusing the film with his own experiences, and it generates a feel of affection (a bit TOO much at times) for the story and it's characters.
I:9805;2362;He has a great eye for detail, with both the physical and emotional dynamics.
I:9805;2363;I was genuinely impressed with Kate Hudson's performance as Penny Lane, she helps build the most poignant moments, and plays her role with beguiling nuance.
I:9805;2364;But overall, this is still a good movie that will definitely be remembered as one of 2000's few cinematic highlights.
I:9805;2365;Oh yeah, and the soundtrack is an all.
I:9805;2366;O. k. be kind since I am going to be honest here.
I:9805;2367;It was the best ten dollars I've ever spent.
I:9805;2368;This is one of my favorite movies.
I:9805;2369;from reading the other reviews you are all probably familiar with the great special features.
I:9805;2370;The best part of this though is the Directors Commentary.
I:9805;2371;As you all know, the real life inspiration for Elaine Miller.
I:9805;2372;Cameron reveals a lot, has a very sharp memory,a good sense of humor, and does not hesitate to tell which experiences actually happened,(the de.
I:9805;2373;He talks about his experiences as young journalist.
I:9805;2374;great information you will not be able to find anywhere else.
I:9805;2375;Which are actually very very good.
I:9805;2376;Also is a fantastic clip of a Lester Bangs interview.
I:9805;2377;You can actually see him speaking and talking.
I:9805;2378;That was fun, because you do not see the full concert in the movie and it does contain the original full length theatrical version of the film, in case you do not own it already.
I:9805;2379;More importantly, a honest and truthful look into Camerons real life experiences.
I:9805;2380;but it was still money worth spending because I am such a huge fan.
I:9805;2381;I also write for an Hard.
I:9805;2382;rock Magazine, and this movie tells the truth.
I:9805;2383;It's warm, enjoyable and with incredible actors.
I:9805;2384;The music is fantastic, and you can feel this great time in every second of this journey.
I:9805;2385;Fun to watch, and taking me back to the years I grew up.
I:9805;2386;Both the theater edition and the Directors cut were great
I:9805;2387;Aside from Philip Seymour Hoffman, who infuses life into every role he plays, these people were as interesting and compelling as a sack of hair.
I:9805;2388;"a young kid gets a shot to do what all young, aspiring journalists want to do
I:9805;2389;After that first shot of cute, the entire movie tries to ride it out for 2 hours.
I:9805;2390;The reason this scenario is interesting is because it's potentially dangerous.
I:9805;2391;Conversations that went nowhere, drug use that never materialized, the whole rock and roll fantasy here is about as adrenalin worthy as a tumbleweed blowing across state lines.
I:9805;2392;Hanging out with a band is nearly every kid's dream but this dream is, at best, slightly more interesting than trigonometry homework, if only because he's on a bus.
I:9805;2393;If you love this film, you'll love the unedited version.
I:9805;2394;n. roll life and most importantly, Crowe's love for rock.
I:9805;2395;n. roll and why it's important to so many of us.
I:9805;2396;fugit comes of age and experiences love and loss in ways that are familar to us all, backed with a soundtrack of a lifetime.
I:9805;2397;music has always went hand.
I:9805;2398;One of my favorite scenes is when the band are at a low point, Crudup and Jason Lee having just had a blow.
I:9805;2399;It has changed my life (to use a well.
I:9805;2400;worn cliche) but it's true and this film is a tribute to the love story that many of us have shared with music throughout our lives.
I:9805;2401;This film is amazing when you begin to think that it is basically true.
I:9805;2402;The characters in this film are probably the best developed ones, considering they don't say much.
I:9805;2403;This is an amazing accomplishment in my eyes.
I:9805;2404;Check out the Tiny Dancer scene on the bus, this is one of the greatest uses of music in a film since the Wise Up scene in Magnolia.
I:9805;2405;This scene summaries the entire feel of the film, it's amazing.
I:9805;2406;Stillwater's music is awesome and has the classic feel that it needs.
I:9805;2407;Jason Lee and Billy Crudup are great in this film although they obviously try to hold back and not take for the main story.
I:9805;2408;Also, one can relate in many ways to the vast array of characters in the movie.
I:9805;2409;This movie was MAYBE good.
I:9805;2410;People treat Crowe like he is the Second Coming after this flick.
I:9805;2411;It truly is an interesting movie and I highly recommend it to anyone!
I:9805;2412;It brings back memories of the 70's, the best time for a lot of people.
I:9805;2413;It is about a up and coming rock n roll band, StillWater and an ambitious writer who knows more than alot of 15 year olds do.
I:9805;2414;They travel around the US and he is interviewing along the way along with the Bandaids, a few girls who are groupies.
I:9805;2415;This movie has excellent music, superb acting and a dynamite plot.
I:9805;2416;A must movie for fans of both Jerry McGwire and 70's era.
I:9805;2417;Ladies and gentlemen, the director Cameron Crowe keeps it real once again, kudos big time.
I:9805;2418;welcome to the music world seen through the eyes of a teen rock music writer.
I:9805;2419;great rock music, pretty band.
I:9805;2420;stopping, swinging tour and lots more of this so. called INDUSTRY OF COOL world.
I:9805;2421;Terrific ( great ) screenplay filled with the way.
I:9805;2422;cool MOVIE MOMENTS ( if you loved those Jerry Maguire moment scenes, you will do this one too ) and sublime performances from the great cast.
I:9805;2423;The film also won the Oscar for original writing work as well.
I:9805;2424;plot:4.5,A funny, honest look at Cameron Crowe's real life experiences.
I:9805;2425;c. characters:5, Beautifully crafted and funny characters.
I:9805;2426;You can easily identify with the William character.
I:9805;2427;overall:4, a great, funny, and true story.
I:9805;2428;You'll have a great time watching this.
I:9805;2429;A fun movie and light hearted break from reality.
I:9805;2430;Good music included throughout the flick and puts you in a better mood than before you turned it on.
I:9805;2431;milieu rock scene seem so genuine and accurate .
I:9805;2432;The scene in which William Miller becomes mesmerized by the album cover art while listening to The Who really hit a nerve with me.
I:9805;2433;Much of the rock world that stays on the periphery of the familiar coming.
I:9805;2434;age story is fascinating, and because it feels like it had been informed by insider knowledge, I felt like I had been brought along for the tour.
I:9805;2435;Moreover, Crowe inserts us into an eminently fascinating period of rock 'n roll, when it was going through one of its cyclical downturns.
I:9805;2436;ego learns the important journalistic lesson of being honest and unmerciful , that advice appears to have escaped Crowe.
I:9805;2437;A movie with a soul.
I:9805;2438;It is honest, sensitive, raw, and wonderfully entertaining drama.
I:9805;2439;both of the main character, William Miller (brilliantly under played by newcomer Patrick Fugit) and the music industry as a whole.
I:9805;2440;Penny Lane befriends the young Miller and is his guide into the world of rock and roll.
I:9805;2441;the achievement of this film is it manages to show the drugs and sex, the emptiness, and shallowness of the music industry without making the viewer lose fascination or obsession with its stars and glamour.
I:9805;2442;The people are human, talented, affected, and driven.
I:9805;2443;That's where the film so gloriously succeeds.
I:9805;2444;every one is in it for the music and living for the moment.
I:9805;2445;While the ensemble cast in this film is one of the best ever assembled (Altman eat your heart out), Fugit and director Crowe are the glue that hold this movie together and make it what promises to be one of the most enduring films ever made.
I:9805;2446;Not to mention Academy Award winner Anna Pacquin and Phillip Seymour Hoffman in Oscar.
I:9805;2447;I just hope he sends a few more their way.
I:9805;2448;If dipping into his own experiences yields this kind of entertainment, I hope the well never runs dry.
I:9805;2449;In Almost Famous, he bared his soul and created a cinema masterpiece that captures more about the human spirit than anything put on celluloid in two decades.
I:9805;2450;What a movie!I remember seeing this movie in the theatres when it came out and i just loved it.
I:9805;2451;everybody who has seen the movie already knows what a great rock n roll movie it is, possibly the best.
I:9805;2452;anyone who has not seen it yet should simply because this is a classic.
I:9805;2453;If you are old enough to have experienced the music of the 60's you will enjoy this movie.
I:9805;2454;this is a sweet, funny and at times heartbreaking story.
I:9805;2455;It brings back memories of my own.
I:9805;2456;The cast is perfect and the music is amazing!
I:9805;2457;Cameron Crowe's screenplay is a beautiful thing.
I:9805;2458;Very funny and deeply moving.
I:9805;2459;It looks and sounds great, absolutely.
I:9805;2460;nominated breakthrough as groupie Penny Lane, and it's the same movie that got jobbed as a Best Picture nominee (Chocolat?
I:9805;2461;But it's still a great movie.
I:9805;2462;It showcases rock and roll from a fan's perspective .
I:9805;2463;rock and roll is at its most magical from the eyes of a 16 year.
I:9805;2464;It was a 'gift request' I secured for a friend of mine.
I:9805;2465;It went directly to him just as I received it.
I:9805;2466;Well this is how it was, and full marks to Cam Crowe and his insanely talented team for blessing us with this dead.
I:9805;2467;cameron and wife Nancy Wilson of Heart even wrote many of the songs, including the superb Fever Dog, with some additional contributions from music guru and Rock God, Peter Frampton.
I:9805;2468;There is also a delightful cameo by Peter as the Humble Pie manager, Reg.
I:9805;2469;crowe classics Fever Dog, Love Thing and Love Comes And Goes.
I:9805;2470;stillwater are totally believable as a band, musically and visually, and the Cleveland Concert (one of the numerous Special features) looks 100% genuine.
I:9805;2471;easily one of the best movies I have ever seen, with a simply stunning soundtrack.
I:9805;2472;Well, Crowe certainly knows the story of a very young journalist on his first assignment covering a rock band on tour .
I:9805;2473;william Miller, the boy at the heart of the story, has to balance his boyish desires to be one of the gang with his journalistic intentions to tell the brutal, honest truth.
I:9805;2474;A special treat are the actual Rolling Stone articles that Cameron Crowe wrote, including his classic story about Led Zeppelin.
I:9805;2475;this is definitely a keeper.
I:9805;2476;"Cameron Crowe's ""Almost Famous"" is a love letter to rock music."
I:9805;2477;You can feel his affection for the music and the culture that it spawned coursing through every scene of this film.
I:9805;2478;When creators talk of projects that are deeply personal to them, this is the type of project they are talking about.
I:9805;2479;As William's journey with the band becomes more prolonged, he discovers more and more with each passing day that his romanticized perception of rock stars was a product of his youthful idealism.
I:9805;2480;Almost Famous is an enchanting work that is blessed with memorable performances.
I:9805;2481;Hudson in particular sparkles in her role and proves that she possesses that rare ability to light up the screen every time she appears in a scene.
I:9805;2482;Her work in this film is like an announcement to the Hollywood community that a new star has arrived.
I:9805;2483;Crowe must also be singled out for his good work.
I:9805;2484;She was right, they were really on Pot.
I:9805;2485;Always listen to your Mom.
I:9805;2486;I would say it's a perfect date movie.
I:9805;2487;It has a lot of extras, mostly James Cameron giving back story to stuff.
I:9805;2488;Didn't realize I had worn out my copy of Almost Famous so was pleased with the sound and clarity of the original version too.
I:9805;2489;the boyfriend is the best in that scene!
I:9805;2490;great source for used items.
I:9805;2491;This is one of my favorites.
I:9805;2492;I watch this movie over and over again and love it more each time.
I:9805;2493;I love the clothes, music, and feel of this movie.
I:9805;2494;It's the type of film that both sexes will enjoy.
I:9805;2495;Great coming of age movie.
I:9805;2496;PSH is great as Lester Bangs.
I:9805;2497;mag Rolling Stone to go on the road with up and coming Stillwater and deliver a report on them.
I:9805;2498;during a wild 3 weeks on the road he (and we) sees the inside of rock n' roll of that era.
I:9805;2499;Almost famous is a brilliant film.
I:9805;2500;documentary touches (makes sense, as the story is a semi.
I:9805;2501;biographical account of Cameron Crowe's) and loving the main characters (all charismatic in their own sense).
I:9805;2502;"the film's main ""weapon"" is its superb humor."
I:9805;2503;good sense all over it as well.
I:9805;2504;all the actors do a terrific job to make the time machine work here.
I:9805;2505;"The mother is great in portaying a representative of the mothers generation that first perceived music as an ""enemy"" and as a gateway to drugs and (oh my god) wild sex."
I:9805;2506;The teeny reporter (in my opinion the least convincing of the lot) is decent too while the show is stolen by the enigmatic and pivotal character of groupie Penny Lane.
I:9805;2507;the dialogue is great, the directing is great, the actors do a great job.
I:9805;2508;"the fact of the matter is that ""Almost Famous"" is a wonderful film in very many respects."
I:9805;2509;It goes from hilariously funny to touching with its dripping nostalgia.
I:9805;2510;i've seen this movie twice already and loved it both times and i hardly see how anyone could not love it actually no matter what other thoughts are to be had on the side.
I:9805;2511;almost famous is almost perfect
I:9805;2512;It is so good, the extra's so in.
I:9805;2513;line with the movie, the menues so fitting, and the commentary so entertaining that I can't say enough good things about it.
I:9805;2514;Both versions are excellent, but since the bootlegged release (or untitled , as it's called) is simply more of what made the original so good, the same comments can more or less be applied to both.
I:9805;2515;piece, a movie about Rock and Roll .
I:9805;2516;It is just as easily a movie about family, a movie about love, a movie about money, and a movie about music in general.
I:9805;2517;The innocent yet extremely subtle acting.
I:9805;2518;"This magic is demonstrated in any number of emotional scenes
I:9805;2519;course, helps it maintain it's vision.
I:9805;2520;in one of the best composed scenes in the movie, the band has just talked to a new manager who wants them to hire him.
I:9805;2521;The scene cuts to Penny Lane, our main groupie in the tale, dancing over the stadium of what was but a night before a concert all.
I:9805;2522;The magic and energy of the concert that is now gone, part of the past, can still be felt in the air.
I:9805;2523;Penny literally dances with it.
I:9805;2524;The contrast between the band selling out and Penny, thier biggest fan, basking in the bliss of what makes music so powerful, is moving beyond words.
I:9805;2525;Even if you have never had any interest in rock (or music, for that matter), you will still be appreciate how real some of these scenes are.
I:9805;2526;The commentary is worth noting, however.
I:9805;2527;It is easily the warmest Commentary I have ever heard.
I:9805;2528;in short, this is highly worth the price.
I:9805;2529;it was a glorious time.
I:9805;2530;down the best picture of 2000.
I:9805;2531;It is a funny, dramatic, romantic, and stunning auto.
I:9805;2532;biographical love letter to 70s rock.
I:9805;2533;The acting is immpecable, with Billy Crudup, Jason Lee and Kate Hudson giving the strongest performances of their careers.
I:9805;2534;Newcomer Patrick Fugit holds his own in high company with a performance that ties together every aspect of the film, and Philip Seymour Hoffman steals his scenes in slight subtlety.
I:9805;2535;The direction, the acting, the cinematography, the script, the soundtrack .
I:9805;2536;they are all masterfully executed and combined by Cameron Crowe, who with every picture gets better and better.
I:9805;2537;driven movies will love this.
I:9805;2538;Mr. Crowe and I share a favorite director, Mr. Billy Wilder, and I must say that with every picture he gets closer and closer to attaining a diverse and consistently brilliant filmography to rival that of the master Wilder's.
I:9805;2539;I strongly recommend that everyone who enjoys movies of a deep and profoundly entertaining nature see this.
I:9805;2540;I saw this just a few hours ago and I still feel it.
I:9805;2541;This was an opportunity to make a great, or at least fun, movie about the music and larger than life characters from 1970s rock and roll.
I:9805;2542;The movie gives us an excellent soundtrack, but we learn nothing about the artists who made that music.
I:9805;2543;There is some potential in the storyline .
I:9805;2544;while she offers up such amazingly brilliant lines as We.
I:9805;2545;Wow, I am deeply moved.
I:9805;2546;Jerry Maguire was a better film by trusting the material and the actors and telling the story first and foremost.
I:9805;2547;First, this was the first truly great film of the new milennium (I hate Gladiator with a passion, but that's another story).
I:9805;2548;One of them is pure brilliance, Cameron's homage to Truffaut.
I:9805;2549;Also included is a wonderful full.
I:9805;2550;This is, by far, the best commentary I have ever heard.
I:9805;2551;There are insights into his life, how the film was made.
I:9805;2552;In short, it's a lovely kiss blown to the kiss blown to rock n' roll.
I:9805;2553;In my opinion, the best films make you want to do something.
I:9805;2554;This film, like Cameron's others (Say Anything, Singles, Jerry Maguire, Vanilla Sky), makes you want to do something great and scary.
I:9805;2555;"She wants to encourage him to be great
I:9805;2556;It is a love story between all of the characters and rock music (clarified by the Untitled cut.
I:9805;2557;It is a love story between Russell and Penny, complicated by rock politics and the cool factor.
I:9805;2558;"And it is a family love story
I:9805;2559;this film is a prime example of brilliance in making the specific universal.
I:9805;2560;We are each a fan of something.
I:9805;2561;Cameron Crowe is a fan of rock music, but he used that fandom as a flavoring in this beautiful coming of age story.
I:9805;2562;William is no longer a boy, Mom respects her son's ambition, Russell is more selfless, and Penny.
I:9805;2563;well, she was the most adult person in the film anyway.
I:9805;2564;She brought the others to her level.
I:9805;2565;Almost Famous is beautifully entertaining and easily sinks into your heart.
I:9805;2566;Just as William enters the world and finds the true meaning of being on tour, he finds himself overwhelmed hanging out with a fictional hard rock band Stillwater.
I:9805;2567;this movie is a classic instant winner, with a cast that shines, and music that catches you.
I:9805;2568;It's so touching and happy, you'll fall in love with it endlessly.
I:9805;2569;I bought this Bootleg Cut of Almost Famous because I absolutely love this movie.
I:9805;2570;This version offers almost 20 minutes worth of extra scenes added into the movie that makes the viewer feel more connected and understanding of the characters.
I:9805;2571;The artwork on the cover is fantastic and the price on Amazon is unbeatable.
I:9805;2572;If you love Almost Famous, you will love it even more with this extended version
I:9805;2573;Its timeless and always a good shot in the arm come Sunday morning when too many adult beverages the night before have left you to melt into your couch for 123 minutes, all to remind you that the night before you may or may not have yelled I am a Golden God, on some strangers roof.
I:9805;2574;Truly a classic, and always fun to watch, with a 88% on Rottentomatoes.
I:9805;2575;It is surprising that a movie that takes place in the unreal world of the rock and roll circus is much more grounded in reality than most movies.
I:9805;2576;It concerns William, an endearing 15 year.
I:9805;2577;old who is mature but nave and tags along with a rock band in order to write a profile of them for Rolling Stone.
I:9805;2578;Both have to enter the other's world, both physically and emotionally, to become complete.
I:9805;2579;Fluttering between them is Penny Lane, the groupie who is about William's age but can't see his love for her because of her infatuation with Russell, who is easily twice her age and who uses her as a plaything.
I:9805;2580;It reminds me a bit of the love story in Forrest Gump, where the woman goes for a series of manipulative men who embody the Zeitgeist of the kooky `70s while she ignores the simple and true love that is hers for the asking.
I:9805;2581;Despite the debauched background of a mid.70s rock and roll tour, this is a sweet film that is by turns funny and touching.
I:9805;2582;I would have to say that this is one of the best movies I have ever seen, if not the best.
I:9805;2583;Period pieces can be a gamble, they're usually inaccurate, or overly goofy, but this movie was very well done.
I:9805;2584;He probably won't win any awards for it (the best ones never do), but he is definitely deserving of it.
I:9805;2585;Patrick Fugit is a likeable young actor, and Kate Hudson is extremely talented (not to mention very beutiful).
I:9805;2586;The story, basically, is of a young writer in the early 70's who goes on tour with a nascent rock band to interview them for a magazine article, during which he befriends the band members, and finds love with a mysterious female follower.
I:9805;2587;I found the story to be particularly enthralling, due to my love for music, and for the fact that I myself love to write, so it was easy for me to put myself into the place of the main character, and see the story through his eyes.
I:9805;2588;I also enjoyed the gritty depiction of the life of a rock star, it's important that people remember that it's not all glitz and glam.
I:9805;2589;It will surely stay in your mind for days after you have watched it.
I:9805;2590;Also, there are tons of great songs in this movie, many of which can be found on the soundtrack.
I:9805;2591;Anyway, there are plenty of reasons why you should see this movie.
I:9805;2592;It is the greatest thing to come out in a long time.
I:9805;2593;And look, Kate's on the cover, excellent choice:)
I:9805;2594;It is especially funny and entertaining if you happen to be a music lover.
I:9805;2595;Another perk is the great soundtrack.
I:9805;2596;drug, college bound and intent on success independent of anyone's help, financial or otherwise.
I:9805;2597;Rock and roll as a way of life.
I:9805;2598;So I owe a wink and a nod to all those friends, and a big thanks to Cameron Crowe for keeping in touch with something I may have never had.
I:9805;2599;Not only is this the best film to be released in the year 2000, it is the best movie about the rock scene of the early 1970s that I have ever seen .
I:9805;2600;although I was only about five years old when this story takes place, I'm fairly well read on the history of rock music.
I:9805;2601;the film is well executed in every area .
I:9805;2602;this film is a timeless classic and deserves all of the praise it's been getting.
I:9805;2603;I thoroughly enjoyed this film, it showed me the music in American cities that we only read about in Melody Maker and Rolling Stone.
I:9805;2604;I was mighty impressed that Peter Frampton helped to keep the '70's music sound real and Still Water lived the dream.
I:9805;2605;How good that some one recreated the Riot House I now think I've been there.
I:9805;2606;We had our top rock venues here in Manchester(and still do) but this film captures the magic of a musical generation that no one appears to be able to compete with anymore.
I:9805;2607;This was a kind of fun little movie.
I:9805;2608;It's a mixture of a comedy and a little romance.
I:9805;2609;Once in a great while there comes along a movie that everyone must see and that everyone will appreciate.
I:9805;2610;This is one of those movies.
I:9805;2611;With a relatively unknow cast, this movie searches every viewers soul and shines a light on what you really believe.
I:9805;2612;A very moving story concerning one boys seach for himself, but there is so much more behind it.
I:9805;2613;I can now see why this won so many awards the year that it came out.
I:9805;2614;Every role is taken seriously by each actor and that seriousness shines through in droves.
I:9805;2615;Nice job everyone!THE BOTTOM LINE: See this movie, plan and simple.
I:9805;2616;It had a profound impact upon my life and did what I said it would, change you.
I:9805;2617;This is the rare instance where the director's post.
I:9805;2618;release tinkering has improved what was already a fantastic film.
I:9805;2619;The additional scenes bring viewers further into both the hero's home life and the surreal life on the road of a touring rock band.
I:9805;2620;The commentary with Crowe and his mother is at turns insightful, touching and hilarious.
I:9805;2621;The part where they discuss whether Crowe lost his virginity the same way his alter ego on screen did is worth the price of admission alone.
I:9805;2622;The satisfaction of seeing the characters on screen react to your dubbing is incredible.
I:9805;2623;The songs are a great pastiche of 70s rock that heighten the believability of the film.
I:9805;2624;as for the movie itself, the original film deservedly won an Oscar for best original screenplay and should have won more.
I:9805;2625;Billy Crudup perfectly personifies both the innocence and the arrogance '70s rockers exuded, while Patrick Fugit's performance captures the uncool kid yearning to be cool we all were at that age.
I:9805;2626;put simply, if you even just mildly enjoyed Almost Famous, you owe it to yourself to give this a spin.
I:9805;2627;It's everything about the movie you liked, raised to a higher level.
I:9805;2628;rock and roll is poetry See her attempt to sneak simon and garfunkle into the close minded grown.
I:9805;2629;ups house, then when she gets caught clutch it defiantly to her chest.
I:9805;2630;Next everyone gets together and sings allmost a minute and a half of tiny dancer with joyous, self riteous looks on thier faces till we finally get to the good part of the song.
I:9805;2631;the good: The music of the faux southern rock band was decent.
I:9805;2632;I understand that one on the girls from heart wrote the original music.
I:9805;2633;And goldie hawn's daughter is very beautiful (maybe prettier than goldie?
I:9805;2634;I grew up in that era it is truly a great movie to have in your collection a must Kate Hudson is awesome
I:9805;2635;I recently had the chance to see Almost Famous , and was suprised at how much I enjoyed it.
I:9805;2636;Usually when a movie is raved about by the critics I, well quite honestly, usually ending up NOT liking it.
I:9805;2637;Patrick Fugit and Billy Crudup were fantastic, as well as Kate Hudson.
I:9805;2638;Watching young William's journey from the beginning when he was so awestruck and beguiled by the rock n roll lifestyle, yet never fully succumbed to it, till he realized that their way of life and treatment of people was not always what it seemed was truly touching.
I:9805;2639;I thought the whole cast was just fantastic in their parts.
I:9805;2640;Overall the movie deserved all the kudos and awards it received this last year.
I:9805;2641;I saw this film and thought it was very entertaining.
I:9805;2642;Cameron Crowe definitely captures the spirit of the time this film takes place in because he lived through that era.
I:9805;2643;They can go watch The Mummy Part 2 or Joe Dirt and I'm sure they'll enjoy themselves since a lot of these people have short attention spans.
I:9805;2644;The humor is subtle at times( It takes 18 minutes for the machine to copy one page. )
I:9805;2645;and the actors have a lot of nice dramatic moments.
I:9805;2646;i liked the performance of Kate Hudson, but I thought the actor who played the lead character was outstanding.
I:9805;2647;Jason Lee, from Chasing Amy and Mallrats, also gives a good performance as one of the bad members of Stillwater.
I:9805;2648;I absolutely love this movie!!
I:9805;2649;I bought the stripped version a long time ago when it came out and absolutley loved it.
I:9805;2650;I'm an huge DTS fan, okay.
I:9805;2651;and naturally, loving this movie I HAD to have the bootleg cut.
I:9805;2652;I thought the best scene was during the near plane crash.
I:9805;2653;Jimmy Fallon did a good turn as the supporting character.
I:9805;2654;It is always nice when you can take your favorite movie and expand it in such a way that the final product is even better than the original!
I:9805;2655;This is a movie I really enjoyed.
I:9805;2656;While it is definitely in Crowe's voice, it is a fairly unique movie and has a lot of charm.
I:9805;2657;This is essentially a film about family, both actual families and adopted families of friends, with all the problems this entails.
I:9805;2658;the performances range from really good, to decent.
I:9805;2659;You feel that this is the guys family with them.
I:9805;2660;Jason Lee, who before this movie was know for comedy, also really carries his scenes, and it is easy to see how he keeps getting work and increasing notoriety.
I:9805;2661;Both delivered very real performances, showing a huge range of emotion though the film and really portraying broken people.
I:9805;2662;the writing itself is for the most part good.
I:9805;2663;The story is very believable.
I:9805;2664;It is a nice looking film, but not so to the point you will think about the visuals later.
I:9805;2665;There are some really good performances and some just good music scattered throughout.
I:9805;2666;The performance of Tiny Dancer in particular is spectacular.
I:9805;2667;For someone who loves drama, this is a must see.
I:9805;2668;Cameron Crowe has once again managed to write and direct a wonderful piece of work.
I:9805;2669;The money comes next but the good times are always there.
I:9805;2670;enjoy this movie again and again.
I:9805;2671;There is something about Cameron Crowe movies which touches a chord somewhere deep inside,nevermind what the movie is about.
I:9805;2672;music,friendship,love and most importantly growing up which is not a easy thing to do.
I:9805;2673;hence through the eyes of a fifteen year old unfolds a story which is extremely engrossing and bittersweet.
I:9805;2674;the entire movie is filled with songs that go on to enhance every scene and great dialogue and acting.
I:9805;2675;this is what I call a complete movie,one which stays with you for a long time and which you dont mind watching over and over again.
I:9805;2676;Almost Famous is a terrific movie that plays almost like a fan's love.
I:9805;2677;"this and ""High Fidelity"" are probably two of the best films that will remind you of why you love rock music so much (and both rank in my personal favorites for both films of the last 10 years or so, as well as rock n roll films)."
I:9805;2678;ray version: Overall, it's a good transfer, though i don't know that i'd say it's a spectacular transfer to the point of being revelatory in the visual sense.
I:9805;2679;It's funny, yet truly touching at the same time, a hard mix to achieve.
I:9805;2680;I really think there's something in this movie for almost everyone and I recommend it wholeheartdly!
I:9805;2681;For one stunning moment, it was the 1970's again and my life was perfect.
I:9805;2682;the movie was a loving reminder of my youth and it brought me back there again, it all came alive for me in such a personal way.
I:9805;2683;Oh what a glorious movie.
I:9805;2684;It is a great ballad to the rock bands, those who love music and to all of us who grew up to the passionate, moving and emotional rock music and times of the 60's and 70'sYou will watch Almost Famous and listen to the wonderfully produced soundtracks over and over and over again.
I:9805;2685;this is a wonderful two.
I:9805;2686;This is the academy award winning version that was released and it's great.
I:9805;2687;The story is well told and very engaging.
I:9805;2688;this version is a gift.
I:9805;2689;unlike many extended versions which add little to character development, this version of Almost Famous brings more insight and depth to nearly all characters.
I:9805;2690;the acting is outstanding, and it's clear that the scenes not in the original release were cut strictly due to time constraints as the acting is right on.
I:9805;2691;this is a great cast.
I:9805;2692;Billy Crudup is wonderful as well, this is the movie which should have made him a movie star.
I:9805;2693;Jason Lee ( of Chasing Amy and other Kevin Smith films ) is hysterical and just enough over the top to be believable.
I:9805;2694;She's done a wonderful job with this complex character.
I:9805;2695;the director's commentary is priceless, much like attending a film school seminar as conducted by Cameron Crowe.
I:9805;2696;i would recommend this set.
I:9805;2697;I didn't want to like this movie, but it's so very likeable.
I:9805;2698;Yeah, there are plenty of corny moments, but there are more moments of honesty than camp.
I:9805;2699;Her performance is endearing, a little provocative, but ultimately vapid.
I:9805;2700;The real star here is Patrick Fugit.
I:9805;2701;If for no other reason, see this movie to see his performance.
I:9805;2702;His screen time is brief, but he uses it very well.
I:9805;2703;This is one of the sit down with the popcorn and just enjoy yourself movies.
I:9805;2704;It is just simple fun and Kate Hudson is hot in her break out movie.
I:9805;2705;This movie makes you feel young again.
I:9805;2706;So, if you love 70's rock, always wanted to tour with a band, or just love free spirts, this is the movie for you.
I:9805;2707;This is a good movie with great music.
I:9805;2708;The scene on the bus where they all sing Tiny Dancer is probably one of the best movie scenes, ever!
I:9805;2709;Every single additional scene fits perfectly into the original movie, adding more substance, explaining something, or simply providing more information you finally thank for.
I:9805;2710;And give some thought on your professional life.
I:9805;2711;Whether you love the music, you love the actors, or you love the story.
I:9805;2712;There is something that makes this movie directed by Cameron Crowe (Jerry Maguire).
I:9805;2713;This movie tells the tale of a William Miller who is only 15 years of age, who begins to write for Rolling Stone.
I:9805;2714;Some of the funniest scenes and dialouge that has come along in quite some time.
I:9805;2715;My husband and I have very few movies we like in common, great movie, very enjoyable, really loved soundtrack!
I:9805;2716;I was 11 in 1973, in a household full of older brothers who listened to this music!
I:9805;2717;This film captures the magic, spirit and beauty of that time.
I:9805;2718;And the music's great too.
I:9805;2719;It is certainly worth your time.
I:9805;2720;The story's great, it's such a deep, heartfelt film, so real, and at the end you have a new perspective, as the journey of life flows on, that everything will be alright.
I:9805;2721;They got captured in this film.
I:9805;2722;It is one of those films where you know there are flaws here and there, but it is so utterly engrossing and the tone is so perfect you forget that there are moments when there should have been more drama, but it was toned down for inexplicable reasons.
I:9805;2723;kate Hudson was mysteriously intoxicating.
I:9805;2724;the writing was often clever and involving, if a little on the lighter side (sometimes, not for the best).
I:9805;2725;Overall a wonderful movie that I could watch over and over.
I:9805;2726;Sometimes it's to the disadvantage of a classic.
I:9805;2727;along with the stunning documentary Hearts of Darkness by Coppola's wife).
I:9805;2728;sInce music is so essential to all of Crowe's films I can't help but wonder what he will do as a film director/writer once he finishes mining the past.
I:9805;2729;ego rising rock stars really hits home.
I:9805;2730;is very focused upon because all the ticket stubs from rock concerts and stickers as well.
I:9805;2731;and Crowe likes to make point of that as often as possible throughout the movie.
I:9805;2732;"He puts on The Who's ""Tommy"" and then flashforward 4 years."
I:9805;2733;"Billy Crudup really shines as the ""hey, I'm the good guy who'll befriend everyone"" but who really has a lot of issues of his own."
I:9805;2734;William Miller is the kid in all of us as we watch .
I:9805;2735;very relatable to the viewers.
I:9805;2736;Cameron Crowe really makes William a solid character as the only solid member of the whole tour.
I:9805;2737;He is what a lot of us are like, at least I really relate to him.
I:9805;2738;He is an innocent fan in a world of drugs, sex, and rock 'n' roll .
I:9805;2739;The way he really grows up in the movie is awesome, and one of the most enjoyable character developments I've seen.
I:9805;2740;i really enjoyed this film overall.
I:9805;2741;Led Zeppelin is the highlight band in the soundtrack, as songs like Tangerine and That's The Way are played a few times throughout.
I:9805;2742;This is Crowe's best achievement to date .
I:9805;2743;spot in the scale, because this movie would be a 4.5.
I:9805;2744;Either way, this movie is awesome from star to finish.
I:9805;2745;"From his 1996 blockbuster hit Jerry Maguire to his newest movie: Vanilla Sky , he seems to be on a role
I:9805;2746;It's a brilliant story that at many points trys to include you in the movie.
I:9805;2747;He's stellar, and you can't help but fall in love with him.
I:9805;2748;We also see appearances by the famous (or infamous, which ever you prefer) 'Penny Lane', played by the beautiful, yet cute, Kate Hudson.
I:9805;2749;And if you know anything about the actual band, this movie strikes new hope into the based.
I:9805;2750;The two main stars of the band, Russell Hammond (played by Billy Crudup) and Jeff Bebe (Jason Lee) work wonders with each other, even if they are just fighting throughout the movie.
I:9805;2751;and as you see, the cast is just piling up with stars.
I:9805;2752;All in all every part is covered, and covered well.
I:9805;2753;It's an awesome storyline that is as dramatic as it is funny.
I:9805;2754;the best movie of 2000.
I:9805;2755;When it comes to Almost Famous, we have a perfectly entertaining movie.
I:9805;2756;It's fun, sexy, and dramatic, yet we feel for all of the characters.
I:9805;2757;All the characters are likable, plus there are funny moments that you wish that OTHER MOVIE (GLADIATOR) had.
I:9805;2758;Almost Famous is a brilliant movie that tells the story of the rise (and implied fall) of the fictional 70s band Stillwater.
I:9805;2759;Crowe has said that Stillwater was inspired by the Eagles and he perfectly captures the heady 70s rock scene.
I:9805;2760;The movie is sentimental whithout being too sticky and several scenes are instant classic.
I:9805;2761;In particular, I love the bus scene where the actors all sing Tiny Dancer.
I:9805;2762;The picture was sharp and the colors good.
I:9805;2763;The audio was also very good.
I:9805;2764;It was worth the price I paid for it.
I:9805;2765;'Say Anything', 'Jerry Maguire', and 'Almost Famous' are all deeply moving films showing a film maker learning and improving on his craft and his storytelling with each year.
I:9805;2766;It took an edge off the original experience.
I:9805;2767;Now it's here, and it was worth the wait.
I:9805;2768;The extra scenes in the Director's Cut give more depth to the characters and connect the story together even better.
I:9805;2769;It's not that there's anything amazing in the extra stuff (or else it would have been in the theatrical version), but it's certainly fun to watch .
I:9805;2770;Interesting to watch, good music, although it does sound like studio recordings with a bit of crowd noise before and after the songs.
I:9805;2771;I enjoyed hearing Mr. Crowe's rundown of the Top Albums of 1973.
I:9805;2772;It is kind of an amusing scene, and gives us a chance to watch Crowe's mom playing one of the teachers.
I:9805;2773;Several of the other extras were worthwhile, like the Nancy Wilson demo for one of the Stillwater songs.
I:9805;2774;I enjoyed it even more than the Stillwater version.
I:9805;2775;a great movie that manages to capture the joy, decadence, fun and earthy feel of the rock scene in the early 70's.
I:9805;2776;While much is made of Kate Hudson and Billy Crudup (who are both solid actors in star.
I:9805;2777;both underrated actors who seem to flourish in these surroundings.
I:9805;2778;fictional account of an up and coming band starting to make waves and a loving homage to the music of Cameron Crowe's youth, many have questioned it's authenticity.
I:9805;2779;This is a film made for music junkies like me who smile everytime we recognize a song (the movie is chock.
I:9805;2780;full of those moments)and for those who were actually around during that magical era in music.
I:9805;2781;"Moments like Stillwater taking to the stage and ripping into ""Fever Dog"" or sitting around thier hotel strumming guitars and drinking with their women are classic!"
I:9805;2782;This is one of the best rock'n'roll movies ever made and gets better every time I watch it.
I:9805;2783;Almost Famous is very enjoyable and hits all the right notes for a music/film geek like myself.
I:9805;2784;I have watched this film several times over the years, and each time i see something new.
I:9805;2785;A great film about a genious 15 year old true fan of music that gets the break of a lifetime to write for rolling stone magazine.
I:9805;2786;But the music is great, the story is good, and you really get to know the characters.
I:9805;2787;"She leaves him her record collection with a note ""Light a candle while listening to Tommy and you will see your future."""
I:9805;2788;"Lead singer Jeff Bebe (Jason Lee) is in love with fame (""Make me look cool, man!"")"
I:9805;2789;"and Russell the guitarist just wants everything to be ""real, man!"""
I:9805;2790;Rock stars have kidnapped my son!
I:9805;2791;Last but not least is an introspective commentary given by Mr. Crowe (with support of his mother!)
I:9805;2792;"If you liked classic rock and have yet to see Almost Famous, to paraphrase a line from a Stillwater song ""you have to be there!"""
I:9805;2793;if that means anything to you, well .
I:9805;2794;"You will love this Movie ""Almost Famous"" will take you down memory lane for those who grew up in the 60's and 70's but is not a Film about Rock Music is about a Rock Writer with Big Dreams a very likeable 15 year old boy who gets to travel with STILLWATER a Hard working Band and about to Tour the Country for the First time."
I:9805;2795;"William Miller gets the opportunity of the life time when he is asked to write an article for the Rolling Stone MagazineAlmost Famous is a very sweet Story of determination, not only for the Kid but for the Band ""Follow your Dream, One day You will be Cool"" ."
I:9805;2796;A coming of Age Tale, very funny at times with all the behind scenes, drugs, sex that comes with the Rock and Roll World.
I:9805;2797;Great Music from those days, but if you are not a child from the Woodstock Generation, it might just be a nice Movie with nice Rock Music!
I:9805;2798;This has become my favorite movie!
I:9805;2799;I love the music in it and I love that it is all about the music.
I:9805;2800;After reading about it, it made me really want to see it.
I:9805;2801;William ends up going on tour with Stillwater, as well as Penny Lane and the rest of the Band Aids, and witnesses the ups and the downs of this up.
I:9805;2802;i really enjoy it everytime I watch it.
I:9805;2803;I loved it so much, that I downloaded it on my Kindle (which is something I don't normally do, if that says anything).
I:9805;2804;i hope my review was helpful, and made you want to see it, like Rolling Stone did for me.
I:9805;2805;This is a must see, and you will not be wasting your money, it's worth it!
I:9805;2806;It is witty and fun, genuinely honest about relationships and self.
I:9805;2807;respect, and is simply a two hour must ride.
I:9805;2808;But the movie is a lot of feel.
I:9805;2809;good nonsense in the tradition of the 70's.
I:9805;2810;Just goes to show you that you have to make up your own mind on these things.
I:9805;2811;Cameron Crowe just makes good films.
I:9805;2812;Each song in the film complements each scene perfectly.
I:9805;2813;Almost Famous is one of the best films of our time.
I:9805;2814;The story is real good.
I:9805;2815;This is one of those movies that you just like to watch over and over.
I:9805;2816;The acting is brilliant, Kate Hudson is perfect for this movie, Jason Lee (of mallrats fame) does a great performance.
