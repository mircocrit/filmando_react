1;This is Tim Burton's best film to date .
2;all of his macabre and funny observations on myth and human nature culminate in this slightly altered version of Irving's timeless horror classic.
3;The ensemble work is exceptional.
4;The cinematography, art direction, editing, score and sound are superlative throughout and make for a seamless and brilliant roller coaster ride through a nightmare world.
5;This is just as good as it gets .
6;The artwork in Sleepy Hollow is simply masterful.
7;I am a sucker for American Folklore, and Sleepy Hollow really hits the spot.
8;the story is way off,but the movie is quite good anyway.
9;this is his best movie.
10;i think it is the best of many,many versions of this story including one by disney.
11;johnny depp doesnt deserve any awards but this is the best movie he happens to be in.
12;the real deal is its good.
13;hundred year old story is, in my opinion, fresh.
14;I prefer IchabodCrane the constable to Ichabod Crane the teacher.
15;Depp's portrayal of Crane is one onlyDepp could have delivered.
16;What I enjoyed most were the set designs andlocations.
17;Burton was able to somehow create a sense of beauty andforeboding in this film.
18;sH is an excellent blend of story, imagery, special effects, andsuspense.
19;I watch it every October as it fits right in with the seasonas do apple cider and pumpkins.
20;Of course it can be violent at times with the death scenes overall this is an excellent tale.
21;Johnny Depp who plays Crane does so very well.
22;The acting is excellent in this tale Burton seems to recreate this time very well.
23;I have watched many of Burtons films and was happy to see his use of imagery.
24;Good enough to see every detail on Depps face.
25;For art direction alone, the Sleepy Hollow is a masterpiece.
26;No one but Tim Burton can make a set look at once so real and so fanciful.
27;This wonderful retelling of Washington Irving's novel changes Ichabod Crane from a schoolteacher to a constable, investigating the decapitations in the small town of Sleepy Hollow.
28;There, his science comes into direct confrontation with magic and mystery.
29;Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci provide wonderfully entertaining performances and Christopher Walken makes the most of an interesting cameo.
30;The incredibly charismatic Fallen Angel proved once again the magnitude of his talent and godlike presence!
31;This movie is a mystery thriller, very suspenseful, full of action, and quite scary.
32;This film was very very cool.
33;It was a completley immersive movie that put you in Sleepy Hollow, and gave you haunting scenery to enjoy.
34;Tim Burton is thankfully at the top of his game, for the first time since Batman Returns, and showcasing fine actors.
35;Johnny Depp is funny and completley lovable as Ichabod, and Christinia Ricci is hypnotic as Katrina Van Tassel.
36;This Movie is soooo great!
37;Violence is what this movie is rated R for.
38;I was surprised because I actually liked this movie.
39;It's kind of dumb in parts but the story is interesting and Johnny Depp is wonderful, as usual.
40;Tim Burton is a fantastic director who always steps outside of the bounds of normality.
41;He is visionary and Sleepy Hollow is no exception.
42;This is a very beautiful movie at times and I highly recommend it to anyone.
43;Man, this movie was really wonderful, and it is one of the few movies which I can regard as a work of art .
44;Briefly, every aspect of this movie was nearly perfect, which is the most distinctive characteristic of Sleepy Hollow.
45;"Marvelous costumes
46;deserved Oscar"
47;Andrew Kevin Walker: se7en ) and finally great cast.
48;"and awesome acting!I think the cast was the greatest of this year
49;I especially loved Christopher Walken portraying the Hessian Horseman.
50;Moreover, during the prologue to the film, what a nice surprise was it to see Martin Landau!!!
51;What a nice favor of him!
52;I recommend this movie to everyone!
53;Go and see it and do yourself a favor!
54;Brilliant, graphic, intense, romantic, eerie, and wonderful art direction.
55;The acting is quite good and this R rated version of the Washington Irving story is a facinating experience.
56;i found it to be good.
57;The colors are very strong (scene when Depp gets blood squirted in the face).
58;Sound its also very decent.
59;The Art Of Sleepy Hollow book explains how it happened but if you just see the result the experience is unforgettable.
60;She is probably not the best choice for this part.
61;so if you like Tim Burton of The Nightmare Before Christmas fame see this beautiful picture.
62;But better concentrate on the design.
63;Such is the impact of highly explosive flour.
64;but I promise you will not notice the difference.
65;Now you made the big one and the money it brings will finance your more subtle creations in a years to come.
66;I love horror movies and have seen many of them.
67;Tim Burton and Christina Ricci were amazing, the plot the special effects, everything was GREAT!
68;He captured the man perfectly, and for that I'd say see the movie.
69;mr. depp is such an amazing actor and it has its funny parts and also spooky parts.
70;this is a true Gothic horror movie, the first of it's kind to come along in years and the last of it's kind for years to come afterward.
71;The use of color and shadow with the bombastic and heavily haunting scoring of Danny Elfman certainly give it the feel of a Hammer horror period piece like Horror of Dracula or Frankenstein Created Woman.
72;It's both refreshing and nostalgic at the same time.
73;Every scene is full of sublime, surreal visuals.
74;this is a wonderful film that is part supernatural thriller and part murder mystery.
75;It has a complexity to be appreciated.
76;Ichabod Crane is a lot more relatable and likable in this version of the story.
77;Our nerdish hero is masterfully played by Johnny Depp.
78;And the ending of the film is very satisfying.
79;i strongly recommend this for anyone who loves Gothic Horror.
80;I saw this movie 3 times in the theater and I could watch it a zillion more!
81;Although the movie doesn't match the sketch by Washington Irving 100%, it is still an A+++ feature.
82;defininately, one of the best parts is when the Hessian enters the house of the midwife, her husband, and their son.
83;So if you liked Darth Maul in Star Wars, all his spectacular saber.
84;There's nothing more exciting than seeing some heads get lopped off by a headless horse.
85;This film was an absolute fantastic success story for Tim Burton.
86;It is majorly differnt from the original Washinton Irving legend, but I think for comming up with a brand new story line, they did a fantastic job.
87;The first time i watched it, I really enjoyed it for all the spooky action and dramatic storylines, but the more I watched it, the more I really began to understand the in.
88;depth story line and I began to enjoy it more and more.
89;So if you're one of those people that are bad at following a story line, you can still really enjoy the movie and take it for what it's worth.
90;it's an awesome movie and a fantastic legacy.
91;You really got to watch the whole thing (the ending parts are fantastic.)
92;This was a creepy but good movie
93;this is one of my all time favorites.
94;The story of course is taken from the tales of the headless horseman, but the portrayal is truly original.
95;Johnny Depp is amazing and the entire cast makes this a must see movie.
96;Action is upbeat and the movie takes on a true to life feel.
97;Not only did it include fantastic music by master Danny Elfman, but it also provided spectacular imagery.
98;burton's adaptation of the Washington Irving tale is an instant haunting masterpiece.
99;It provides suspense, a little bit of humor, and a few shocks along the way.
100;Burton's creative mixing of science and classic American literature is phenomenal.
101;furthermore, Depp is astounding as Ichabod Crane.
102;He brings a spookiness to the role, while still retaining the overall timidness of the character.
103;Not to mention a delightful appearance by horror film veteran Christopher Lee.
104;the dark scenes, the haunting music, and the driving story line make Sleepy Hollow a movie worth seeing and owning.
105;My wife and I enjoy watching This every Halloween.
106;Sleepy Hollow is the perfect kind of movie for his directional Midas touch"
107;"In the film, an adaptation based on a story by Washington Irving called The Legend of Sleepy Hollow
108;The way everything is presented, the trees look like something out of a fairy tale and the scenery represents deception in a mysterious wonderland, is what makes this production one of the year's most captivating and magical film experiences.
109;Its a older movie but i love it.
110;if you're fan of the story this is a nice twist on the classic telling.
111;the acting was wonderful and story exciting.
112;better story than Irving's original.
113;an excellent supporting cast and Christopher Walken IS the Headless Horseman!
114;This is one of my favorite Depp movies.
115;Johnny Depp shines as the eccentric Ichabod Crane, and Christina Ricci is great as the beautiful, mysterious Katrina Van Tassel.
116;As for the story, Burton does take a few liberties with it, but still makes it very enjoyable.
117;And of course, he adds his own brand of twisted, zany happenings that make the hour and 45 minutes a very fun ride (and if you can get this in Blu.
118;ray, I highly recommend it!)
119;I still remember it, so it made quite an impression on me.
120;It was such a huge change from his pirates movies.
121;Christina Ricci did an excellent job in this movie.
122;She has grown into a talented and underrated actress over the years.
123;The setting, the sets, and the period costumes were perfect.
124;It is an essential part of the movie.
125;I liked the movie, but I absolutely loved the score.
126;Well, Tim Burton was certainly the best modern director to make this film.
127;It is great upon the first and second viewing.
128;I have seen much better versions of the legend, and I remember most of them pretty well.
129;this movie is a real winner.
130;the plot is a delightfully spooky remake of the origonal tale.
131;johnny depp's facial expressions keep the movie entertaining in the slow parts and the blooming romance between him and katrina keep you pining for more.
132;lovely little twist about the owner of the hessian's head controling him (did anybody but me notice that the skull's sharpened teeth are a lot closer together than the actors?)
133;as a whole, i think the movie is a lot more satisfying than the actual story and would definently recomend it if you swing by the video store on halloween.
134;Being an English teacher, it is a regular occurrence to see students eager to read the story after seeing this film.
135;As a matter of fact, the set itself was quite admirable.
136;The storyline even pays homage to the first settlers of the region: the Dutch.
137;All of these events can be nostalgic for those who got excited to see the Disney version every October.
138;Furthermore, it is worth mentioning twice that the chase scene was pretty intense.
139;The stunts looked realistic, and whoever filled in for the role of the Horseman and Ichabod were remarkable in the amount they were dragged across the dirt trail of a set.
140;It is also a valiant performance by Christina Ricci who provides this movie with a slight pulse.
141;the teaser trailer stated, """"Close your eyes."""""""
142;It is Katrina who is actually into sorcery and witchcraft.
143;This tale could certainly become a great movie if filmed in the Catskills of New York.
144;Focusing on Irving's reason to write these tales would be more enjoyable as he satirized the American Revolution.
145;It's worth checking out once, but do yourself the favor and read the short story first.
146;Sleepy Hollow is a brilliant masterpiece.
147;It is the best thing that I've seen for a long time aready.
148;and I've seen the Sleepy Hollow movie 18 times already including in French.
149;The actors are wonderful, the scenery is beautiful, the architecture is gorgeous and the computer graphics that they use are AMAZING.
150;I strongly reccomend that every own a copy of the sleepy hollow movie in their home, because it is truly the best movie there is out there.
151;Funny, romantic, and a period story.
152;Both leads at the top of thier game with a really good supporting cast.
153;I love Tim Burton/Johnny Depp movies!
154;Nicely creepy, very well done.
155;Every time I watch it I see something new.
156;This is a masterpiece, with a perfect cast, very good stunts and special effects.
157;The headless horseman is fascinating, and so well done here, with a beautiful black horse!
158;Once you get past that, it's a very well done film.
159;the dark and melodramatic style of the cinematography matches the darkness of the tale.
160;The special effects are masterfully done, particularly much of what was done with the tree.
161;Ichabod's obsession with witchcraft is replaced with an obsession with science.
162;I found the ending of the movie more conclusive and satisfying that the ending of the original story.
163;"This is one of the few times I prefer the movie to the ""book""."
164;It is an utterly fantastic work of animation.
165;The sequence undoubtedly owes its initial inspiration from the wonderful anthropomorphic forest in SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS.
166;But it's as good a piece of fantasy drawing as anything in print.
167;One of my favorite movies.
168;Wonderful mastery of the story of sleepy hallow.
169;It even merits a comedy award at times.
170;comical performance as the easily grossed.
171;The location and setting are amazing and really put the viewer back in time.
172;U can tell this is a tim burton movie, its all dark, and gloomy but it really fits this movie well.
173;A great movie but bloody.
174;I forgot how awesome Mr. Walken and Depp are.
175;Sleepy Hollow is an awesome movie.
176;Its dark and yet it seems to have a hidden humor about it (mostly thanks to the talented Johnny Depp) Johnny Depp, as in all of his work, protrays his part perfectly.
177;And the costumes are beautiful!
178;"as in ""gosh, I wish I was a youthful , gorgeous hunk, who had these terrifying powers""."
179;Boy it feels good to stop doing that!Oh yes, by all means, take the malleable teenage mind and MOLD it.
180;"VEry carefully instruct them that ""a white witch is where the real power is""."
181;"Thank you for 'saving me' You are our real and true savior ""."
182;Boy, do I love Johnny Depp and Tim Burton.
183;This is the tale of the Headless Horseman, played by Christopher Walkin, who is perfectly terrifying.
184;the best thing about this movie is Depp's acting as Ichabod.
185;Ichabod's character is so comical!
186;This movie is another example that proves Johnny's acting is unparalleled.
187;just so you know), it is creepy, it is dark, and above all, it is a masterpiece.
188;New view of an old classic.
189;This picture draws you in, and never lets go.
190;It's nice to see a revival of such a wonderful story.
191;Christina Ricci is marvelous as Katrina, and Johnny Depp provides a fresh take on Ichabod.
192;Probably the best of all was Christopher Walken, whose time was short, yet powerful enough to scare this seasoned horror fan out of her seat.
193;A truely haunting and enjoyable film.
194;But its nice to watch the film in pristine clarity.5 stars for the film, 5 stars for it being on Blu.
195;note, it works on Australian Blu.
196;Johnny Depp is such a cutie and he was perfect for the role.
197;Suspend your realism and enjoy the show.
198;Adding to the collection of my most favorite actor.
199;Item in perfect condition and will be an all time favorite.
200;Can't wait to see it again!
201;the movie is spared a one star because of some cool looking sets and a great (non.
202;Sleepy Hollow is a marvel.
203;Tim Burton has to be seen as a genius after this film.
204;It is compelling and one hell of a ride.
205;Everybody knows the story of Ichabod Crane and the Headless Horseman.
206;And what delicious horror it is!
207;The movie is one of the most visually stunning films I've ever seen.
208;It instantly hooks you in and never lets go.
209;The acting is good too.
210;The expressions, action, and grunting were enough.
211;All in all, this is an exquisite piece of work.
212;done movie with an excellent cast.
213;The scenery really sets the mood for the story.
214;Fun to watch, especially around Halloween.
215;The reason I give Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow a relatively high four.
216;rating is that it is simply one of the best looking films of the decade, but as many other films by director Tim Burton, Sleepy Hollow suffers from its lack of strong characters.
217;the main plot of this film about a headless hessian (That's where I am from, by the way) horseman who runs amok in a small village is really nice.
218;This is sometimes funny, but very often confusing and scarcely captivating.
219;As a creator of strong imagery, he is unsurpassed.
220;But the movie was fine without them.
221;There is alot of blood, see.
222;i thought some of the killings were quite clever, like two kills and one body.
223;But it is a great movie to watch if your looking for a slasher that makes you think.
224;Icubod Crain is played very well by Depp playing a detective way over his head in unnormal goings on in the small town he visits.
225;Christina Ricci is also grate as Depp's' love intrest.
226;All suporting cast are grate and the costumes and sets are out of this world,this is truley one of Burtons best to date.
227;Sleepy Hollow is a mildly chilling, elegant movie.
228;Visually lavish, it's costumes and sweeping cinematography will exhilarate.
229;, it just adds to all the fun.
230;Well, overall, it's been a while since an elegant, mildly scary movie came out, so please.
231;notch cinema, but it is a great film, and the leading actors do a great job.
232;This is Burton at his best.
233;A dark atmospheric tale: stunning visuals combining with a masterful soundtrack from Danny Elfman.
234;as you would expect layer upon layer of intrigue and mystery is played out by some great characters.
235;The dark, brooding feel of this film is well placed for a story such as this.
236;And, surprisingly I think, Johnny Depp is just right for the part of Ichabod Crane.
237;What there is are moments of suspense, sprinkled with an occasional good scare.
238;right cinematography and the Gothic, old.
239;world setting that raise this movie to a higher level.
240;It certainly deserves better than it got in its theatrical run.
241;so, sit back, get some popcorn and a soft drink, and enjoy.
242;ichabod Crane in this movie is a New York City police constable, a rebel with a cause .
243;this is an engrossing movie, but it has some flaws.
244;But that's always been necessary in murder mysteries, so I guess it's unavoidable even by the best directors and writers.
245;as with Depp, the rest of the cast is quite effective.
246;Miranda Richardson is her wicked stepmother Lady Van Tassel.
247;Martin Landau (Best Supporting Actor Academy Award for Ed Wood) has a cameo appearance as Peter Van Garrett, and so does the veteran horror star Christopher Lee as The Magistrate of New York.
248;a fine cast in a fine movie, worthy of multiple viewings.
249;This is an instant classic.
250;A must see for anyone who is into a gothic type of movie.
251;I also recomend the book.
252;um, well, shoulders with the dreaded horseman.
253;Katrina Van Tassel (Christina Ricci) is a young, beautiful witch, who is either out to help or hurt Mr. Crane.
254;creepy atmosphere, and perfect casting, make SH a horror classic!
255;Tim Burton has cooked up a comic / gothic brew of darkness and dreamlike imagery.
256;Miranda Richardson is perfectly wicked as Mrs. Van Tassel.
257;Also, check out Christopher Walken as the hessian!
258;Christopher Lee even makes a cameo as the Burgomaster!
259;Best when viewed near halloween or any time past midnight.
260;and it takes on some of the clich s of the genre as well.
261;but the effects are perfect and nearly credible, the acting is brilliant, and the story is OK.
262;So, compared to the standards of this kind of movie, Sleepy Hollow is the best one in several years!
263;depp is so unique and such an incredible actor that most any movie he is in is fun to watch.
264;The wicked step mother was amazing.
265;All the actors did a great job.
266;the movie had great eerie atmosphere and believable scenery, but the movie had several problems (IMO).
267;That version is STILL my favorite rendition of the story.
268;Johnny Depp was a great wimpy hero (if thats possible).
269;anyway, it is one of those movies where you laugh and jump at the same time.
270;The movie, Sleepy Hollow, embodies Tim Burton's unique take on one of the most well.
271;"known horror tales of all time, with a few new plot twists and greater character development, including a dark past for Ichabod Crane and a ""story behind the story"" of what's going on in the haunted town, which is beautifully rendered, dark and foggy for an eerie atmosphere."
272;the dream cast puts in great performances, but obviously it's Johnny Depp who steals the show with his intuitive and sometimes over.
273;top portrayal of the anti.
274;hero, Ichabod Crane, who displays admirable bravery while at the same time often succumbing to fear.
275;"the lavish production, masterful acting, background music, beautiful periodic sets and costumes and the careful attention to detail, most notable in the special effects used to bring the headless horseman ""to life"", if you will, all come together to tell the tale of Sleepy Hollow's plight and deliverance as it's never been told before."
276;As the film unfolds Depp unravels a convoluded (and silly) plot that implacates some of the town's elite citizens with the headless horseman, the gentleman cutting off the heads, played by a constantly snarling Christopher Walken.
277;sleepy Hollow is certainly one of the funniest movies of the year.
278;Depp's performance is also slyly excellent.
279;He manages to play a character who is both an idiot and a genius at the same time and also someone the audience can laugh at and applaude in equal proportions.
280;Christina Ricci is given a part that is small and forgettable but does a really good job with the material she is given.
281;as usual it is the cinematography and visuals that shine through, like in all of Burton's films.
282;Right from the start the viewer is bombarded with beautiful, twisted gothic imagery that never lets up until the end.
283;The best sequence of the whole film occurs at the very beginning where Depp travels from NY to Sleepy Hollow.
284;As he travels you notice that the stunning countryside shots become more and more bleak with each moment.
285;It is very entertaining and there are a lot of things to be praised about Sleepy Hollow.
286;It certainly won't change your life but you will have a great time watching it.
287;This was a great movie, I loved it the first time I saw it and it's an awesome addition to my home film library!!
288;This movie was stunning in its ability to keep me watching but not terribly concerned if Depp kept his head or not.
289;Walken was also cool, seeing as he was acting sans head.
290;"I always liked the story of ""Sleepy Hollow,"" but I felt it was overrated."
291;This movie is a MAJOR improvement.
292;He arrives at Sleepy Hollow and finds the people to be clannish.
293;But he does make some friends who are willing to help him.
294;One especially artful moment is when Ichabod is cutting at the tree of the dead.
295;The climax defines horror, and there is an especially interesting twist.
296;Between the phenomenal scenery, the great music, the interesting deviations from the book, the interesting connections between Crane's past and present, the great acting by Depp, Gambon, Ricci, Lee, Walken, and others, the gradual unfolding, and the surprise twists, this movie is a masterpiece of horror.
297;Johnny Depp will probably always be best known as Edward Scissorhands and Captain Jack Sparrow.
298;But personally, I think this is his best movie.
299;Then Tim Burton brings out This, a Horror film that was Fresh, Original, Brilliantly Brought to the Screen and, most importantly.
300;"(like ""The Dude"" played by Jeff Bridges in ""The Big Lebowski"")Burton also creates a World of his own, A Nightmarish."
301;He Stocks the film with Oddball characters that fit the film like a glove, and Oddball actors who fit their roles Perfectly.
302;catching performance, as he always does, and Christina Ricci (this girl was Born to act in Tim Burton films) gives a Mature and Beautiful performance as Katrina, Depp's Love interest and a girl more Involved in the Mystery than she lets on.
303;Sleepy Hollow is among Burtons Very Best, which also makes it one of the Horror Genres best, and most Unique.
304;If you wanted a creepy, quirky visually stunning Burton/ Depp.
305;Hello I thought that Sleepy Hllow was a pretty good movie basedon the time it took place.
306;It was actually more funny than scary.
307;Although it is dark humored it is pretty good.
308;We love this movie for Halloween Night.
309;It is the cherry on top for movie night at our house on Halloween
310;He has created some of the most unique and visually stunning films I have ever seen and Sleepy Hollow did not disappoint.
311;I sat in the theatre mesmorized by the effects, the story, the scenery, the acting, the photography, etc. etc.
312;What a wonderfully scary, yet delightful picture.
313;This is a great movie, and it doesn't dissapoint on blu ray.
314;Tim Burton's cinematography is superb as usual, and Depp and Ricci do excellent jobs, as do the entire cast.
315;Tim Burton clearly enjoys his craft.
316;atmosphere and sets are as important as characterization in a Burton piece, and SLEEPY HOLLOW never disappoints in any of these elements.
317;i believe filmmaking is, for Burton, an intensely personal experience.
318;the commentary certainly has its moments .
319;such as Burton's constant guffaws at Jeffrey Jones' impossibly huge wig, or his use of the word amazing so many times that you'll start counting them .
320;he does a good job, for instance, talking about some of the actors and his admiration for them .
321;The featurette will show you.
322;sLEEPY HOLLOW is Burton at his finest .
323;Great price and terrific movie.
324;A perfect fit for Halloween.
325;I highly recommend Sleepy Hollow to all fans of Tim Burton's work as well as other students of the arts.
326;Something about this movie is thick and involving, I watched it twice.
327;The acting also deserves honorable mention, especially after taking time to relate to the setting.
328;There are some very graphic scenes.
329;Johnny Depp is an exceptional performer.
330;Look at all the movies he has done.
331;He is one of the best Chameleons I have ever seen.
332;He throws himself totally into his roles.
333;I love this modification of the original story.
334;Making Ichabod Crane a detective rather than a teacher was brilliant.
335;The support cast is great and some well known names are amongst them.
336;Tim Burton did a wonderful job of making the atmosphere beautiful and frightful.
337;christopher Walken is magnificent as the Hessian that is now headless.
338;Walken is another Chameleon that can marvel you with his stylish bravado.
339;The special effects are incredible including the seamless transitions of the horse and rider entering and exiting a tree.
340;The are numerous extras that make this the best Halloween movie I have.
341;Ok, I truly loved this movie.
342;It's so excellent, right down to the very last detail.
343;He, ladies and gentlemen, is the #1 reason I wanted to see this movie in the first place.
344;Marc Pickering, if your out there, keep up the good work!!
345;::sighs::) The special affects in this movie are great, and Ray Park was very gracefully as the Headless Horsemen.
346;up/sequel to this movie is possible, I'd love to see the continueing adventures of our heros.
347;This is a great movie and must see, it is horror at it's finest and also has one of America's hottest actors .
348;"Johnny Depp!It is Tim Burton's finest work too and plays on the old original tale of ""The Headless Horsemen"" though there are better changes to make this movie more fun and interesting."
349;It has a gorgeous gothic atmosphere and beautiful to watch and marvel at.
350;And tim burton worked wonders with his version of this movie.
351;Tim Burton has done it again and created a moody masterpiece.
352;Depp is delightful as the delicate and scarred Icabod and Ricci is deliciously radiant as young Miss Von Tassel.
353;I enjoyed the beautiful historical recreations, but be warned.
354;I loved this movie from start to finish.
355;If you are a Depphead like myself, you should definitely watch this one.
356;Christina Ricci was great as the love interest, and of course Johnny was brilliant as usual.
357;While being frightening, the movie also had some delightful Depp.
358;ish humor slipped into it.
359;Tim Burton films are delightfully witty and creative.
360;They are visually stunning and the wild twists of plot are very entertaining.
361;"He also pushes his actors into ""over the top"" performances, and Johnny Depp is totally over the top in this film."
362;there is a certain charm to this tale even if there is one decapitation after another.
363;wife and her husband while their child is hidden in the basement is pretty grim.
364;Burton is so good at mixing horror and humor.
365;I recommend the film highly.
366;since I was a kid I had always loved the story of the Headless Horseman and Ichabod Crane.
367;"As with all of his films ""Sleepy Hollow"" is a very dark ( i. e. Batman Batman Returns) and visually rich film."
368;Though Depp has made a career of playing the offbeat character, he really comes through with a terrific performance as the young detective struggling with what he sees and what he thinks to be true.
369;The supporting cast around Depp is wonderful, and full of people you recognize but don't really know.
370;I love Burton's use of color, and the way he makes everything look so dreary.
371;His depiction of turn of the century New England is fascinating and the look and costumes of the townspeople are also top notch.
372;I also applaud the casting of Christopher Walken in the role of the Horseman with a head.
373;Walken always brings some little something extra to any character he plays, especially the evil ones.
374;The scenes in which the Horseman reeks havoc on the town are really exciting and well choreographed.
375;The headless black figure on the enormous black stallion is quite a site, and looks real enough.
376;I found myself wanting to like this movie, and maybe that's why I did, but I think this version of the Legend of Sleepy Hollow is definitely worth a look.
377;The visual and special effects alone are really worth watching the film for.
378;It's one of the scariest movies I've ever seen.
379;The acting and action are good.
380;It's suspenseful from the beginning till the end.
381;Filmmaker Tim Burton was the perfect choice to bring this adaptation of Washington Irving's creepy classic to the big screen.
382;No one can match his ability to create an atmosphere that is both creepy and whimsical, and you can see it in full force here.
383;The sets and designs in Sleepy Hollow are just as much stars in the movie as are the actors.
384;Johnny Depp is a great actor who enjoys taking unconventional roles, and he manages the fine line between Ichobod's timidity and his nobility extremely well.
385;Christina Ricci and Miranda Richardson are great, too.
386;Plus, any fan of Burton's movies will find a lot of familiar faces here as well (most notably Jeffrey Jones, Michael Gough and Martin Landau).
387;Still, these are minor quibbles compared to the quick.
388;moving plot, haunting visuals and really good casting that make Sleepy Hollow an unforgettable movie.
389;Tim Burton really is an artist.
390;Johnny Deep was perfect for the role of Ichabod Crane.
391;The other cast are also perfect for their parts, especially Christopher Walken (in his second Tim Burton film) as the horseman.
392;I also adore the gothic atmospher that Tim Burton puts into his best films.
393;sleepy Hollow is a master piece that brings out the humourous constable's work and the thrilling moments that revolves around the mysterious town in upstate New York.
394;there are subtle special effects that accentuate the foggy ambience in the town that will surely send a chill down the spine.
395;this movie is a classic that you would love to keep for time to come.
396;A great twist to a classic American tale, all of the actors are not top notch, but it still is good.
397;First rate acting by Johnny Depp (as always).
398;It takes the viewer for a ride on the dark side of the turn of the 19th century and frightens the viewer out of his wits.
399;And, both Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci are convincing in their roles.
400;filled movie that leaves the viewer on the edge of their seat until the very shocking end!
401;Sleepy Hollow is an excellent movie.
402;Johnny Depp is wonderful and charming with his light touches for comic relief .
403;He is perfect as Crane.
404;All the actors did great, especially Christopher Walken as the Headless Horseman.
405;You'll get a kick out of him, great make.
406;this movie has to be one of Tim Burton's best.
407;This is a very sophisticated movie, with a perfect amount of suspension, action, romance, and humor.
408;And the plot takes a nice twist and the mystery behind the Headless Horseman is surprising.
409;i definitely recommend this movie.
410;It's really entertaining and it appeals to all types.
411;Give this movie a try, you'll like it.
412;Sleepy Hollow is a wonderful movie, and it is veryyy spooky.
413;Gotchaa, Tim Burton is a wonderful director and this film shows all his talents.
414;A nice twist to the legendary story of sleepy hallowAnd much less expensive than any retail outlet!Always the best products here for sale.
415;First off I think this is one of Tim Burton's best movies ever.
416;Johnny Depp did an amazing job of creating a new Ichabod Crane.
417;He had that unmatchable mix of nervousness and wit.
418;Ray Park was an excellent headless horseman, along with the role of Darth Maul (Star Wars:Episode One) under his belt he has proven to be the most admired villain there is, atleast from my point of view.
419;Danny Elfman, collaborated an amazing score, that made the movie ten times more scary.
420;I've always admired Danny's ability to be able to know what the audience needs to hear at a certain point in a movie.
421;When they get together, they make a great team (hence Edward Scissorhands).
422;This was a great movie because of these two guys and it was a creepier version of the classic tale.
423;But one thing really got to me.
424;Johnny Depp was supurb in his role, and the rest of the cast was believeable and well displayed.
425;Good cast, and good acting.
426;I especially liked the supporting roles.
427;I hope you enjoy it.
428;I absolutely love this movie, or pretty much any movie with Johnny Depp, or directed by Tim Burton.
429;The plotline is great, and the acting is superb.
430;This is such a beautiful movie!!
431;An American horror classic, Sleepy Hollow tells the harrowing tale of Ichabod Crane.
432;wonderful Christopher Lee, Ichabod Crane travels two days journey to the town of Sleepy Hollow.
433;The incredible sets coupled with top.
434;"notch storytelling
435;Gothic big come to mind when defining the beauty of his musical work for the film.
436;Both informative and heartfelt, you get a real sense of the director's perspective as he realizes his vision of this American literary classic.
437;Upon viewing the disc I am happy to report Paramount provided a new improved anamorphically enhanced BRIGHT and beautiful transfer!
438;The colors are not necessarily vibrant throughout the feature but, in certain parts, namely, the party at Boltus Van Tassel's in the beginning of the film, the interior of Van Garret's coach Ichabod's initial meeting with the town leaders in the back room of Van Tassel's country manse, the colors are absolutely beautiful.
439;in addition to the great audio commentary the two trailers for the film.
440;This segment takes you behind the scenes with cast crew interviews gives you an insightful view into the production of some of the film's special effects stunts.
441;Additionally, it paints a picture of the ensemble cast establishing the kind of atmosphere created when a group of actors that is this talented gets together with a director like Tim Burton!Sleepy Hollow is one of the greatest American horror stories ever written.
442;Tim Burton's vision is richly terrifying deliciously evil.
443;In homage to the Hammer films of old, Tim Burton brings to life one of horror's most frightening visages, the Headless Horseman.
444;I fell in love with Sleepy Hollow on my initial viewing greatly enjoyed all that Burton did with the storyline.
445;I have to say that I am a great fan of Tim Burton's work this film further cemented that opinion.
446;If you are looking for a good rich scare, I highly recommend this feature to you.
447;On every level, this film makes an awesome presentation!
448;Instead I got a twisted, but darkly amusing thriller/drama.
449;Johnny Depp Christina are great as Ichabod Katrina, and the way the movie gained a new twist every 10 minutes was amazing.
450;same as above movies were in one package again thanks for taking care so they were in great shape when recived
451;A beautifully, filmed and scripted version of the classic short story by Washington Irving.
452;The special effects help to draw the viewer deeper into the story as it unfolds cryptically and dramatically across the screen.
453;Well worth a viewing during Halloween or any other time one feels the need for a scare.
454;The movie itself is very good and definitely worth owning.
455;The product in general was in good condition and it was obviously new.
456;Don't get me wrong I loved the movie.
457;Overlooking that part of the movie, I do recommend this movie for a great weekend flick.
458;Tim Burton always has a distinctive style, except Planet of the Apes which could've been directed by anyone.
459;, he returns to the more gothic dark flavor which can be seen in Batman and Beetlejuice.
460;Plotwise, it's not the best but visually it hits its mark.
461;it's a pretty common story but as usual, Tim takes a story and changes it a bit.
462;before I get into the look, I have to mention the plot.
463;Sure it's not some spectacular landscape images or beautiful gardens, but oddly enough it looks beautiful.
464;It's the kind of film that when there's no action or great looking scenery, you want the action and fortunately this has it.
465;Although the story had been changed from the original, it was still wonderful to watch due to the amazing Johnny Depp.
466;He is a feast for the eyes.
467;The photography was wonderful and added tension to the story.
468;The combination of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp is sheer chemistry .
469;hope they continue working together.
470;A work of art, and funny as hell, it was funny while scaring you half to death with plenty of action.
471;I hold this movie in me top 3 with interveiw with a vampire.
472;All and all a good movie.
473;The movie is one of me favorites.
474;Hope this helps with your shopping.
475;I absolutely love this movie.
476;it's one of the few Johnny Depp movies I truly enjoy watching.
477;they are so big they take away from the picture of the movie.
478;Cause I really do love this movie!
479;This is one great movie.
480;the setting is real great all cloudy and dark makes it really great.
481;the acting is real great he plays the real jumpy Ichabod crane,Chirstina ricci plays the beautiful Katrina van tassel.
482;Tim Burton is and always will be an awesome director.
483;as far as this movie goes, the atmosphere of the movie is so incredibly decorated and detailed that the movie, even though could be described as a horror/slasher film, is beautiful.
484;there is comic relief in the film as well, and its intelligent in the way that like another reviewer stated before, there are very limited jokes in the film, just the way that expressions are displayed happen to be entertaining.
485;this movie is a great movie, especially around the fall.
486;This movie has become a Halloween movie tradition in my family!!!
487;I not only got this movie because I'm in love with Johnny depp but I absolutely love Tim burtons dark movie visions.
488;The cast is wonderful and the storyline is never dull.
489;I highly recommend this movie.
490;This was interesting and would be a great movie to watch on Halloween .
491;Sleepy Hollow is another Tim Burton masterpiece!
492;By far one of his best works yet!
493;The film is absolutely stunning.
494;This film is a delight to LOOK AT as well as watch.
495;Joining the real star here, which is the visuals, Johnny Depp (who has said he played the part of """"Inspector Crane"""" in the manner of a skittish teenaged girl) is great as always in this his third collaboration with Burton."""
496;Backing up Depp are Christina Ricci, Miranda Richardson, Jeffrey Jones (Ed Rooney, himself!)
497;"outs and a couple of ""jumper"" moments but mainly Burton relies on a sound storyline and beautiful backgrounds to host his re."
498;telling of a classic American ghost story.
499;In my opinion it's worth watching again and again.
500;It's by no means a wonderful film, but its stylish take on the classic tale is a bit intriguing.
501;Christina Ricci, who plays Depp's mysterious love interest, does a decent job as well, carrying her weight in a Depp driven project, but its Burton who really steals the show.
502;Tim is one of our finest directors, and as was mentioned, he is over.
503;top, but that's what makes him so enjoyable.
504;There's no subtlety, and like with most of Burton's masterpieces it is layered with humor which adds to the atmosphere only Burton can paint.
505;i didn't find this to be a scary film, not in the least, but it was an interesting film with enough entertaining value to keep the viewer watching time and time again.
506;It is an excellent story.
507;that being said, I thought this was a very good film that was a bit too ambitious in trying to cross genres.
508;from the standpoint of the sets, props, costumes and visual effects, this film is masterful.
509;The woods were spooky, the tree of death was fantastic and the windmill was a marvel.
510;The creation of the headless effect was brilliant use of digital technology.
511;The decapitations were also superbly grisly and realistic.
512;He played it a bit too tongue in cheeky, but I'm certain that was more Burton's direction than Depp's interpretation.
513;Somehow I don't think she has to stretch much to play the sassy and flirtatious type, but she played it to perfection.
514;i rated this film a 7/10.
515;It is very entertaining and has moments of brilliance, but overall the whole is less than the sum of the parts.
516;py Hollow, a film that will eventually become a classic in its genre.
517;DEPP and Burton are a masterpiece made in heaven.
518;Great Setting, story and plot.
519;The scenery, acting, and overall mood of this story are so enchanting that you think your actually involved in this movie.
520;They really made this horseman really interesting.
521;You will undoubtedly love how they emphasize the horses hoofsteps.
522;All in all, this movie is Tim Burton's best.
523;If you are like me and love the dark and mysterious you will put this movie at the top of your list.
524;This movie is like an eerie waavy poem.
525;There is also some really funny comedy.
526;The one fault is that the Hessian, when he is alive, has some kind of sharp fang.
527;So don't pass this eerie tale of loud horses, lots of blood and really really good settings.
528;If i had to rate this movie I'd give it a very well deserved 9/10,
529;a great performance by johnny depp and christina ricci, a great story and all done by a great director.
530;i recommend this one to everyone!
531;The incredible production values and performances really shine on this Blue.
532;This is the most magnificent horror movie I have ever seen and one of favorite movies of all time.
533;The movie does take so many liberties with the original that Washington Irving might have a hard time recognizing it, though.
534;The increasingly supernatural aspects of the story do nothing to take away from a spectacular ending.
535;sleepy Hollow boasts a spectacular cast and a stellar crew of filmmakers.
536;Tim Burton, with a little help from Francis Ford Coppola, has created a work of art.
537;The settings are incredible and truly evocative of a farming community of the late 18th century.
538;The dark and moody atmosphere of Sleepy Hollow makes the very town an important character in and of itself.
539;When we view the scenes of Crane's childhood memories, full of vibrant color seemingly leaping off the screen, the contrast between the two atmospheres is incredible.
540;No actor is more at home in a Gothic setting than Johnny Depp, and he truly shines in Sleepy Hollow, giving Crane a depth of character that is crucial to the film's success.
541;"Christina Ricci is utterly charming and enchantingly beautiful as Katrina
542;Then there is Christopher Walken, who was the perfect choice to play the role of the Hessian soldier/Headless Horseman.
543;I must say that these are some of the best, most impressive beheadings I have been witness to.
544;Burton even adds special touches such as one scene in which the head spins around quickly before leaving the shoulders of its suddenly former body.
545;The representation of the headless horseman is also quite exceptional and disturbingly realistic.
546;The music complements every bit of the action very well, and the beautifully realistic mood that only Tim Burton could have created is guaranteed to draw you completely into the story.
547;Other than that short complaint, the movie was superb.
548;What I recieved was a thrill ride down a very spooky trail of terror, Not to mention humor.
549;Johnny Depp made a very good wuss.
550;I enjoyed it, but it was hard to follow and figure out the plot.
551;Taking a long established tale, Depp and cast managed to put more sparkle into this story.
552;There is comedy, intrigue, and all the elements of good filmmaking and most audience appeal.
553;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow is one of my favorite short stories of all.
554;There is something about this American folk tale that captivates my mind and imagination.
555;I can remember watching the Disney animated version of the tale as a kid around Halloween time.
556;And later, while studying English literature in college, I returned to the stories of Washington Irving with an """"adult"""" and critical eye."""
557;Yet, despite the deadlines of college and the sheer mass of reading to accomplish, I always took special time out to enjoy Irving's work.
558;It can make you a kid again.
559;sLEEPY HOLLOW delivered on all of my high expectations for the film.
560;While I am normally upset by films that depart from the stories they purport to represent, Burton has managed to capture the feel and appeal of the legend, while at the same time churning out an entertaining Hollywood picture.
561;In my opinion, almost no one does this better than Tim Burton and he deserves much credit for it.
562;sLEEPY HOLLOW is, from a visual perspective, absolutely stunning.
563;The action sequences with the Headless Horseman are marvelous and rank among some of the finest action sequences I've seen lately.
564;Another thing that SLEEPY HOLLOW nails is its comedic sensibility.
565;"Burton's films are usually quite good at maintaining a level of ""fun"" throughout their length and this picture is no exception."
566;There is plenty of comedy to lighten the mood of the picture and allow it to take itself less seriously.
567;Tim Burton has made a GREAT film that incorporates the greatest aspect of classic horror: creepiness, suspense and just the right amount of humor.
568;the production values are superb and have Burton's fingerprints all over them.
569;The performances are great, from Depp's whimsical but squeamish Constable Ichabod Crane to a supporting cast that is, simply put, to die for.
570;This would have made a fun sequel .
571;would that Burton had brought the original story to film with this much energy and whimsy and spookiness.
572;Alas, it was not meant to be, but it's still a good film overall.
573;Tim Burton, the director of this movie, is a really twisted filmmaker.
574;Just look at the 2 Batman films he made.
575;The movie's look is absolutely amazing, the most stunningly beautiful Burton film to date (and that's saying something).
576;The movie is definitely spooky and even humorous at points, but some of the acting is below par, especially Christina Ricci.
577;but, focusing on the movie, it's definitely worth watching once.
578;Although a completely serious movie, the film has it's share of laughs.
579;Note when Johnny Depp throws the horseman the skull the amazing through and the horseman's perfect one handed catch.
580;i'll take that peace pipe in Fear.
581;As always Johnny Depp delivers a superb performance in this masterpiece.
582;The story for Sleepy Hollow is said by many to be a classic tale of witchcraft and the supernatural.
583;This was a very enjoyable telling of the classic tale that is very heavy on atmosphere.
584;the look and feel of the film are great.
585;o. lanterns, and twisted trees.
586;The movie has a great deal of suspense built into it, and we are treated to lots of tense moments when the horsemen is near, along with some fairly short, but sometimes very intense scenes of decapitation.
587;the plot is quite complex and usually laid out well.
588;for me, one of the best parts of the film was the Danny Elfman score .
589;it was very rich, with lots of interesting effects built into .
590;It added both suspense and humor to the film.
591;Depp shows a nice range of emotions as the somewhat nervous Ichabod Crane who was investigating the horseman's murders.
592;Christina Ricci played a very pretty but very mysterious young lady with links to the horsemen.
593;The whole cast was very good and tended to play a bit over the top (this is Tim Burton after all).
594;a particular favorite for me was Christopher Lee in a small but powerful role as a judge who sends constable Crane off to Sleepy Hollow.
595;One of my favorite horror movies, and I strongly reccomend purchasing it.
596;"Christopher Walken, Jeffrey Jones, and Christopher Lee highlight the supporting cast
597;Jaw dropping Oscar winning art direction.
598;Expectably fine work by Johnny Depp as the bumbling Ichabod Crane.
599;Too bad all of this is in the service of a byzantine script that practically undoes all that's good about the film.
600;Director Tim Burton stages some interesting set pieces and at times there are some genuinely scary moments.
601;In this version, Ichabod Crane is an iconoclastic New York police inspector who is an early believer in the value of forensic science.
602;All of this makes for a supremely entertaining mix of thrills and humor.
603;Two examples: a whole happy family is beheaded, one by one, with each member seeing a loved one's severed head before being killed"
604;When and if I go mad I can only hope the things dancing in front of my unblinking eyes resemble characters from Tim Burton movies.
605;The whole film oozes atmosphere.
606;And the effects are simply amazing.
607;Johnny Depp's portrayal of Ichabod is great, playing him as a frightened little girl trapped inside a man's body.
608;Once set upon the case he meets Katrina Van Tassel, played by the impossibly beautiful Christina Ricci, and a whole town of squabbling politicans and doctors.
609;some of which are old veterans of British horror, all of which are great.
610;Given what little screen time these actors are given, it's testimony to their performances that we feel very comfortable with them and actually like them, no matter what dark secrets they might be harboring.
611;What Tim Burton has done here instead is make a perfect fable, a bedtime story told extremely well by a man who has an uncanny knack for creating whole living, breathing worlds whose inhabitants and scenery are not only unforgettable but also wholey original.
612;Burton's best film so far.
613;My daughter and I loved watching Sleepy Hollow, and not just because Johnny Depp is in the starring role!
614;This interpretation of the classic spooky tale of the Headless Horseman has everything a good spooky film should have.
615;The spin from the Irving story was pretty original and the atmosphere was perfect.
616;Strong cast who all earned their pay with the skill one would expect and a rather nice job by Christina Ricci which was a pleasant surprise, not having seen any of her other work.
617;A bit gory but in a suitable manner and not disturbing and fitting for the story.
618;Having written all of that, I'd put this up with, The Woman in Black as far as spooky is concerned but with a light hearted touch, a bit of humor.
619;As a lover of this story for many years, this version is one I will own and watch often.
620;Great movie from the master of photography and mistery, Tim Burton.
621;Once again, the dark misterious athomsphere famous from Tim Burton's movies really shine here.
622;known to many, but told in a manner of great imagination and mistery.
623;The fighting sequences are great, dual wielding swords flash in the air and blood everywhere, some o the most impressive violent.
624;fighting scenes in this movie as well some of the most impressive misty environments ever created.
625;The actors were very well chosen too and play their parts very nicely.
626;All in all a great movie from a great master, dont miss if you like fighting sequences with weapons and misterious stories with a bit of terror to spice it up.
627;It was a good movie.
628;I always was a big Tim Burton.
629;fan, and Sleepy Hollow met all my expectations .
630;dunnit, partly a horror movie, partly even a love story, but to me just as much a comedy, because it always keeps its self.
631;As usual for Tim Burton movies, it comes complete with supreme cinematography, unique mood and a nice soundtrack.
632;All in all, the best film I have seen this season, and the one I can least wait to own.
633;By far one of my favorite scarey movies of all time.
634;Great story, great visuals and the cast was excellent.
635;As with most of Johnny's flicks, I LOVED IT!I loved the morbid atmosphere, I loved the characters, I loved the effects.
636;Just a really good movie.
637;Tim Burton just has a way with film that even if you are flicking through channels at lightning speed, you can spot one of his films easily.
638;and, of course, Johnny was just really delicious icing on a great STRANGE cake!!!!!!!
639;Tim Burton is the master of moody storytelling, and here he proves his worth as he retells the classic tale of Washingtion Irving's The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow.
640;Christina Ricci is fantastic as Katrina Van Tassel, daughter of the most powerful man in town, co. conspirator of something sinister that may be related to the headless horseman, the one behind the killings.
641;What follows is a suspensful mystery, with excellent picture and sound.
642;And the sets are fantastic, with lots of grays and dark.
643;toned colors adding to the dark mood.
644;Tim Burton does a great job here with a great cast and plenty of action.
645;This movie has become a Halloween tradition for me and my wife.
646;Great movie and classic Tim Burton cinematography.
647;And of course an uncredited Chris Walken as the Horseman is great.
648;Watching Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow every October has become a family tradition for us.
649;Just the right amount of creepiness, gore and humor to set the mood for Halloween.
650;While it's not suitable for very young children, it's a classic that older kids won't outgrow.
651;Those of you who haven't seen any of Tim Burton's great films, you just have to know that he is unique in creating this so special atmosphere, this climate of greyness, blackness, or simply emptiness, a surreal environment which is though so full of mystery and suspens.
652;I know I may not be describing it the best way, but this atmosphere is the best you'll ever experience in a movie of any kind.
653;I was also stunned by the realistic presentation of the Headless Horseman, until I watched the movie.
654;Add that up with the fact that, not having a face to show, the Horseman actor could rather well be a stunt man very good in handling swords and axes, and you get a wonderfully directed mystery, with great action scenes and an equally satisfactory ending.
655;This is another classic from Johnny Depp, well made and worth your time!
656;Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow is a dazzling visceral feast for the brain.
657;It dips into elements of timid comedy, macabre imagery and suspense and mystery that all coems wrapped in a sensory package that brings Washington Irving's tale to a vivid new life.
658;, but I looked at this as a serious movie with comical undertones, which is what makes it work so well.
659;This brings Constable Ichabod Crane into the picture, who is sent by his superiors to ivestigate the deaths of several people.
660;Crane believes it to be cold murder, and sets out to prove his theory, along with making good with the citizens as he dismantles town life with his discoveries.
661;johnny Depp plays Ichabod Crane, and this pairing of his character with the rest of the town sets up a lot of the tension that keeps the movie's mystery and intensity moving.
662;Crane's discovery that there really is a ghost sends him on a journey into the woods to discover if it is true, and what he will discover will bring the town to a jaw.
663;there are more than enough elements at work in this movie, but the most intriguing is the mystery behind the Headless Horseman, and the forces at work that bring him into the picture.
664;the story works well with this mystery, moving along at an easy pace, with moments of fast action mixed with slow scenes that revolve mostly around one of two things: the love relationship developing between Crane and Katrina Van Tassel, the daughter of a wealthy resident, or in giving us the small clues aforementioned.
665;There is a nice balance that allows us to catch our breathes in the midst of all the suspense while not ever becoming to melodramatic or woeful.
666;The sets and the costume design are resonant of the time period, while also increasing the high.
667;class nostalgia of the characters that dwell within them.
668;This adds to the mysticism and keeps up a sense of unease and tension.
669;This is the ultimate walk in the woods, people.
670;beat skin tones, which give the characters a more.
671;Danny Elfman's music is effective and brooding, adding to the sense of romantic phantasmagoria that pervades the movie's plotline.
672;the acting in this movie is purely magical, like a dream.
673;Johnny Depp as Ichabod Crane is goofy and intelligent, his dialogue sounding natural and coming at us with ease.
674;His investigation of the crimes brings out his aspirations of austerity, while his clumbsiness in handling an autopsy is comical and brings humor to the movie.
675;Christina Ricci is bright and gorgeous as Katrina Van Tassel, and the perfect match for Depp.
676;Their chemistry is convincing and inviting, and we begin to enjoy watching them together onscreen.
677;All of the characters are given the wittiest and most pristine dialogue I've heard in a movie in ages, which adds to the aristocratic sense of the movie.
678;i enjoyed Sleepy Hollow because it is able to do what most movies cannot: it can take a classical story, give it a more.
679;praiseworthy makeover, and combine elements of horror and humor without going into to much of one without the other.
680;The movie is witty, intelligent, and frighteningly good fun with a surprise twist ending that delivers satisfaction.
681;Through my wife I'm becoming more and more of a Johnny Depp fan, and this movie has added to that.
682;The atmosphere is spooky, the characters wonderful yet a certain surrealism pervading everything (which is dead.
683;One of my fav movies so I thought it was time to own it.
684;Johnny Depp is in fine form in this Tim Burton reworking of the classic Sleepy Hollow Fable.
685;the supporting cast is also outstanding making the film a delight to watch.
686;get version of an american classic with a side of funny will be a classic of its own within the coming years
687;There is tons of suspense and the movie is awesome.
688;It's best if you watch it at night.
689;The classic tale of the Headless Horseman, brought to life by Tim Burton.
690;Johnny Depp is so believable as Icabod Crane.
691;And Christopher Walken is the perfect choice for the Headless Horseman.
692;The plot and story will definately keep you on the edge of your seat.
693;Also amazing was the scenery.
694;It was interesting to see this film.
695;Christopher Walken was great as teh headless horseman.
696;Christina Ricci was good also.
697;The special effects were good too.
698;Johnny Depp portrail as Ichabod Crane was good.
699;I can't even explain how good it looks.
700;The headless horseman is about as realistic as a man without a head can get.
701;The special effects and CG are stunning.
702;I still reccomend this film to anyone who appreciates a good decapitation, and to any Tim Burton fan.
703;Great acting and a new twist to an old story.
704;And could see it as many times as I wanted.
705;I am a huge fan of Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow in the Pirates of the Caribbean.
706;And I think he is long overdue for the best actor Academy Award.
707;Certainly Depp is very good in this part.
708;Obviously the star and director have a great deal of simpatico to judge by all the films they turn out together.
709;The original was carried along on some of the finest lyric prose ever penned by anyone.
710;Burton never for a second catches Irving's delight in everyday human nature, the charm and whimsy of an author's happy bliss as he creates a great comic character .
711;It also twists the sunny side of the story inside out turning everything into one long nightmare.
712;Gone with the humor is contrast and complexity.
713;Is it possible few modern reviewers can appreciate just how wonderfully Irving juxtaposed the scary legend with one eye giving a very broad wink?What is perhaps more appalling in the overwhelming majority of the reviews here on Amazon is the non.
714;Counting the earlier battle scenes there must be well over twenty!
715;Ichabod simply disappears from town.
716;in sum, absolutely not for impressionable young children.
717;Tim Burton enjoyed revamping the story in his own image, and took, as always, the easy self.
718;Maybe someday a more mature director will return to this wonderful story, and we can enjoy Irving's fabulous story in a wiser and more fully mature reading.
719;filled glass, the ghoulish half of the story, will be all Hollywood will deign to present.
720;This movie is a wonderful throwback to the days of the great Hammer films.
721;The cast is, quite litteraly, to die for.
722;"In an era when ""Horror Movie"" usually means mindless slasher films of exceeding visual ugliness and moral repugnance, ""Sleepy Hollow"" is a welcome return to the classic gothic chillers of the past
723;Depp is hilarious, and Miranda Richardson and Christopher Walken add sinister icing on this Halloween cake.
724;A terrific movie, here served with a Tim Burton commentary track.
725;But we've all seen Irving's story already, so this new tale is welcome indeed
726;Makes the movie much better.
727;this is the most beautiful film i have seen, and probably will see for a long time to come.
728;each frame is worthy of being blown up and displayed in an art museum.
729;the production design is simply amazing.
730;who cares about the script"
731;what a treat for the eye and the soul.
732;there is a very interesting twist at the finale, where it is revealed who the true puppeteer is, thus connecting the sub.
733;marvellous camera angles, special effects which compliment the story instead of distracting, splendid darkly elegant visuals, a 'gothic' adventure, and a most intriguing version of this delighfully ghastly tale comprises this pleasing adaptation of Sleepy Hollow.
734;tim Burton continues to create marvellous de.
735;facto Satanic productions {virtually ALL visuals, and most characterizations},, combined with Danny Elfman's ingenious orchestrations, makes for a truly powerful combination, both of which are frequent pleasures.
736;Over all I like the movie and think it a great watch!
737;The cinematography is there, the costumes are there, the music is there, the action and pacing are there.
738;great characterization is, to me, what separates the truly great movies from those that are merely mechanically proficient.
739;You can marvel at his technical proficiency, and you have to respect the dedication and hours of practice, but if the music doesn't move you, what's the point?This is what I felt like after seeing Sleepy Hollow.
740;The characters are merely props to move the story along.
741;that said, I know that there are lots of people who love Tim Burton's movies, and I have a great deal of respect for Burton's work, but if you are the type of person, like me, who requires great characters to pull you into a movie, Sleepy Hollow might not be for you.
742;If you've liked lots of Burton's other movies, though, then you'll most likely love this one too.
743;It certainly is well executed.
744;This is certainly one of Tim Burton's best films.
745;The look of the film is incredible and Johnny Depp and the whole cast is excellent.
746;Everything about SLEEPY HOLLOW is first rate, from the sets, cinematography, and music, to the costumes and special effects and make.
747;Tim Burton has created a brilliant, timeless, gothic fantasy masterpiece.
748;I still watch this movie every Halloween night.
749;Make sure and check this one out.
750;If you're a Johnny Depp fan you'll like this movie.
751;he gives it a kind of modern spin on this classic,with a touch of CSI.
752;"1999's ""Sleepy Hollow"" is director Tim Burton's surprisingly entertaining reimagining of the classic Washington Irving ghost story."
753;Instead of a school teacher, Crane in this version is a New York City police constable experimenting with new.
754;The movie features a very solid supporting cast.
755;I really enjoyed this film.
756;I like to call it a beautifulmovie It had beautiful actors, costumes, sets, and even the way they spoke was beautiful!
757;when i saw the trailer, i thought the movie was going to be too scary to see)I loved all the humor.
758;Anywho, this is a MUST SEE!
759;I don't recommend it for small children.
760;i really liked this movie,it was scary,it had a mystery to it,good acting,cast,everything!i was very scared from this movie.
761;johnny Depp is very good in this movie.
762;this one had some witchcraft stuff in it and i really like those kind of movies.
763;thats part of the reason i liked this.
764;If anything, the music being played and the sound effects made you jump.
765;If you like classic Halloween tales like I do, you'll love this movie.
766;Johnny Depp fans will enjoy his performance.
767;Christina Ricci is equally good.
768;Now you can watch it the way it was meant to be.
769;Loosely adapted from Washington Irving's story, this Tim Burton classic is part romance, part detective story, and part gothic horror .
770;and Johnny Depp helps elevate it to a brilliant supernatural thriller.
771;until he has a close encounter with the Horseman after he committed some of his murders.
772;but Ichabod is still convinced that someone living is controlling the Horseman, and it's all wrapped up in a complex scheme involving a pregnancy, a marriage, a will, and a tangled family tree.
773;, eerie gothic buildings, and skeletal trees.
774;tongue/eyeballs always make me burst out laughing.
775;It's a pretty sharp contrast to the rather sweet, shy romance between Ichabod and his host's daughter, Katrina Van Tassel.
776;as for Depp, he's absolutely perfect .
777;he plays Ichabod Crane as a young man with a horrifying past (which is revealed via dreams) and an abiding love for logic, science and reason.
778;"He's also pretty nervy, fragile and neurotic
779;Pickering is excellent as a young orphan who latches onto Ichabod as a surrogate father, and Miranda Richardson is all spidery creepiness as Lady Van Tassel.
780;Also keep an eye out for Christopher Lee, Michael Gambon and Christopher Walken's hilariously over.
781;Sleepy Hollow is all creepy atmosphere and weirdness, but it also has a solid story at its center.
782;Blood, magic and a deranged undead horseman, all done with Tim Burton's gothic style.
783;Not his best film (I think that honor goes to Edward Scissorhands or Nightmare Before Christmas), but a wonderfully told rendition of this classic tale in his trademark gothic style.
784;Johnny Depp brings an interesting interpretation to Ichabod Crane, and I think all the actors really had fun with it.
785;Crane was as fearful as he was brave and the combination made this flick worth watching.
786;Johnny and Christina are great in this movie, the storie is fantastic, the headless horseman and the witch, is all horrorific and well achieve, Depp plays this doctor who is kind of genious and clumsy, is a true classic!
787;The setting is during colonial times in America, and the people who made this movie did an excellent job recreating that scene.
788;This is simply a brilliant movie, one of Burton's best.
789;He took a simple story, added a brilliant back story, casted it well and went on his way.
790;Excellent performances all the way through and a creepy dark air worthy of a Hammer film.
791;But nonetheless, it was a great film.
792;But it was well acted and well written, and directed brilliantly by Tim Burton.
793;Who i think is one of the best directors of today.
794;Christine Ricci was perfectly cast as the young witch, and i think she already looks that sallow and ghoulish, even without the black/white/greenish film.
795;All in All, if you like a good spook story that isn't too scary for the kids, this is a good movie to watch.
796;watch it with all the lights off!
797;I gave this four stars because it's not perfect, but is enjoyable.
798;I've seen this movie many times and it's kind of loosing it's charm but my sister doesn't seem to grow tired of it so I decided to give it four stars.
799;But give it a look.
800;Overall this is an enjoyable and mysterious movie with an eerie atmosphere to add flavor!
801;Johnny Depp plays a fantastic Ickibod Crane!
802;This story is SO much fun and played by some fantastic actors!
803;Its a wonderfully spooky period piece!
804;But Tim Burton films so much of this in dream.
805;I still believe that a bit more sharpness could have been coaxed out of the original negative for this release, so this is why I give this gem of a movie 4 stars.
806;Excellent movie, well done"
807;At first I thought this movie was going to be really stupid because I usually don't like anything Tim Burton does (I hated Edward Scissorhands), but I ended up seeing it because I do love Johnny Depp!
808;My friends and I saw this in the theatre, which really adds to the spookiness of the film.
809;The graphics are great in this movie .
810;In any consolation, Sleepy Hollow is a great movie.
811;But even with all the death and blood and murder there is something positively sweet and even cute about this storyline that is admittedly a far cry from Washington Irving's tale of a funny Halloween prank.
812;Ichabod Crane, still hilariously done by Johnny Depp, is a neurotic cop from New York City sent to investigate the murders.
813;the story is a tight, fun, and thoroughtly satisfying one that is endearing in all its bloodshed with its likeable characters that seem to have jumped right out of a storybook, albeit one that spends the entire plot in overcast gloom.
814;Even the blood, which defies all knowledge of clotting and reality, is fun in its macabre way.
815;this is honestly one of my sentimental favorites, a deranged fairy tale brought to life.
816;"Jonny Depp is a brilliant actor
817;Love this classic tale of terror from Washington Ivring!
818;brought to life for us all to see!
819;It has the famous Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci!
820;This movie is probaly the best Halloween movie!
821;Great Musis, Stunts, sound effects!
822;I have this movie and i watch it probaly every day!
823;This movie has some great images and it takes the scary children's story to the ultimate level of horror.
824;It's considered a horror film for its general eerieness and beautifully creepy images.
825;johnny Depp and Christina Ricci give out brilliant performances for the younger crowd, while Michael Gambon and Miranda Richardson will grab the attention of the older crowd.
826;Christopher Walken is absolutely freaky as the Hessian [headless] horseman, while Christopher Lee's small role is a treat.
827;tim Burton's imagination has been put to good use once again: sets and costumes are truly gothic and beautiful to look at.
828;Danny Elfman strikes again with his unique musical style (the main theme will have people shivering).
829;told, acting is good, and the cinematography and scenery evokes the kind of imagery that is necessary for this to be believable.
830;Overall a fantastic film (in the sense that it is successful in the realm of fantasy).
831;Excellent movie very well done by Tim Burton, Johnny Dep and the other actors were also excellent.
832;The sound is excellent as for the picture you will be disapointed if your looking for high def sharpness you will be disapointed also.
833;This movie had some scenes of good cinematography that just had too much grain.
834;I just love this adaptation and enjoy the portrayal of the characters very much.
835;Visually it is just fantastic and moody as well!
836;This film is another in a long line of excellent Tim Burton film's.
837;His interpretation of the Washington Irving classic is definitive: At least for me.
838;And the supporting cast of Christina Ricci"
839;deserved place in the annals of great and entertaining films.
840;"i really liked the surrealistic vision that Tim Burton gives to the village of ""Sleepy Hollow."""
841;It is really a great film.
842;And Christopher Walken as the Headless Horseman is diabolical as ever.
843;"This entire film
844;That, and I enjoy laughing where others don't see the humor!
845;Firstly I should say that this film is well made.
846;the colouring of the movie is excellent it has a gothic mood.
847;the music is good , the pictures sre good eveything in this film are well designed.
848;Burton's interpretation of the Headless Horseman myth was masterful and conveyed the perfect atmosphere for the story.
849;For those of us who had only the merest passing affiliation with the original myth, much (if not all) of the story was surprising and suspenseful.
850;Personally, though, I think the occasional use of comedy helped to keep the story from becoming too dark in tone, and I really enjoyed this movie.
851;For anyone with an interest in suspense, drama, horror, or even fantasy (much of the movie had a fantasy feel to it), this movie is sure to delight.
852;Tim Burton breathes new life to the macabre tale of the tormented Ichabod Crane.
853;nosed school teacher of the original is turned into a sophisticated, charming New York City constable who is called upon by the townspeople of Sleepy Hollow to investigate the mysterious, gruesome be.
854;Besides countless severed heads, there is a lot Tim Burton throws at the audience and it's all done with the Burton style that his fans find irresistible.
855;Very few can deny the fact that this film looks great from every angle.
856;It's dark, dreamlike atmosphere will inspire awe and dread.
857;Johnny Depp is in sharp contrast physically to the quirky character depicted in the Disney version or the Jeff Goldblum 1980 film but he is very believable in the role and Christina Ricci's pale, angelic features shines even amidst all of the bloodshed.
858;But one of the best characters in the film is the incomprehensible, vicious headless horseman portrayed by the great and always compelling, Christopher Walken.
859;And thanks to the creative genius of Tim Burton, it's never dull.4.5 out of 5.
860;Now, the positivity: This film is classic and beautiful.
861;It's a dark and mysterious horror film that's rich with atmosphere and imagination.
862;If you like Tim Burton, you'll appreciate the look and feel of this movie.
863;Danny Elfman also composed a fantastic soundtrack that adds to the mood.
864;Also, the special effects are fabulous, realistic, and interesting.
865;First off I must say I was quite impressed with Johnny Depp's acting in this movie.
866;He is a great Icabod!
867;For someone who is supposed to play a grizzled constable that doesn't believe in the supernatural this is a pretty brave asumption!
868;Read the book, it will be more rewarding.
869;Instead of sticking to symbolism the movie just bombards you with neat scenes of the horseman running people down.
870;Very well done Halloween movie!
871;a real horror film that delights its viewers.
872;gothic scenes are frightining,spring and verdure scenes are appealing.
873;Good retelling of Irving Washington's classic tale, fabulous period acting from Depp, lovely moody look to the piece.
874;Criticisms aside, this film is very, very funny, Depp's performnance as a less.
875;man is extremely refreshing and very attractive, and the five or so times he faints are some of the funniest moments.
876;Still, i think you should see it.
877;Would recommend it to anyone who loves suspense.
878;It came early, at a very good price, and well packaged.
879;Pros: It has Chris Walken (!)
880;It has the kind of spooky, dark, visually.
881;stunning backdrop you expect from Tim Burton, and that you would hope to see in a film for the Sleepy Hollow story.
882;The action scenes are engaging.
883;It has very little to do with the classics.
884;i'll be honest, if it were any other director I might have given another star to the rating.
885;But I have come to expect much, much more from Burton and yes, I hold his films to a higher standard.
886;In my opinion, the film is standing on those two actors and the costume/set dressing team talent.
887;Tim Burton has done it again.
888;Sleepy Hollow is a wonderful, dark, moody film.
889;Burton's vision of the world of the Headless Horseman is breathtaking.
890;It helps carries the movie.
891;The movie combines horror and comedy (albeit very little comedy) to make a very entertaining film.
892;His portrayal of Crane shows the character at his weakest and strongest.
893;a recommendation is in order for this film.
894;As with all of Burton's films this one is visually stunning, dark, cartoony and with gothic atmosphere.
895;Burton has certainly proved himself of being an original filmmaker and his films carry his stamp.
896;And with all his visual flair, 'Sleepy Hollow' is one of his best looking films, beautiful costumes and sets are brilliantly captured by truly impressive cinematography.
897;But as a film, it is a lot of fun"
898;Johnny Depp, who has collaborated with Burton in many successful films, is excellently cast as the bumbling Ichabod, he is funny, heroic and makes for a very likable hero.
899;Christina Ricci is also great as Ichabod's love interest, a great characterization and a slight change of pace from all the heavy stuff she did on 'The Opposite of Sex' and in 'Buffalo 66'.
900;In fact the casting was impressive all around, but casting Christopher Walken as the headless horseman, that was inspired casting.
901;Excellent foggy atmosphere and a truly brilliant score also help.
902;house romp to a serious mystery.
903;That brought down the film a little but not too much, it still remains entertaining and fun.
904;Extras: Martin Landau, who won an Oscar working with Burton in 'Ed Wood', has a cameo at the beginning of the film.
905;From a scale of 1.10 I give this film a 7!
906;Its one of his most beautiful films photographed and Art Directed.
907;When I see a Tim Burton film, I usually come away with a senseof awe and bewilderment.
908;It is an excellent story.
909;that being said, I thought this was a very good film that was a bit too ambitious in trying to cross genres.
910;from the standpoint of the sets, props, costumes and visual effects, this film is masterful.
911;The woods were spooky, the tree of death was fantastic and the windmill was a marvel.
912;The creation of the headless effect was brilliant use of digital technology.
913;The decapitations were also superbly grisly and realistic.
914;He played it a bit too tongue in cheeky, but I'm certain that was more Burton's direction than Depp's interpretation.
915;Somehow I don't think she has to stretch much to play the sassy and flirtatious type, but she played it to perfection.
916;i rated this film a 7/10.
917;It is very entertaining and has moments of brilliance, but overall the whole is less than the sum of the parts.
918;To my mind this is the finest of the Burton/Depp collaborations.
919;All of Burton's work suggests the atmosophere of this film, but nothing else captures that essence so completely.
920;writing of Ichabod Crane as a modern detective is great, in my opinion .
921;one more striking element I'll mention is supremely Burtonesque.
922;It's been a long time since Tim Burton has actually directed a film that was successful, with disasterous hits like Mars Attacks!
923;Sleepy Hollow is an extremely well made film, the set pieces are hauntingly beautiful, good special effects, a film score by Danny Elfman, and a long list of first rate actors.
924;"It's one of those movies that takes you on an adventure(something that I havent experienced in a while, going to the movies)This is a very uncommon film
925;I think this is a wonderfully entertaining movie, so I just don't understand the negative reviews.
926;It is true, as other reviewers say, that it is grany, and it shouldn't.
927;hey, we're talking about high definition here.
928;ray yet but still looks good.
929;The storytelling is great fun and the 'Dark"""" spooky skies and atmosphere Burton creates is not to be missed."""
930;Danny Elfman's music is a real treat and will scare you to death!
931;The plot is fairly complex.
932;But it is still a great movie with great acting,direction,set design and soundtrack.
933;I feel this is like most Burton movies, a little bit of his quirky style and not much else.
934;Johnny's a gorgeous, smart, talented actor!
935;Oh yeah, this movie is awesome with him in it!
936;Christina is good in this movie as well!
937;It's rated R for a reason, and that reason is some of the creepiest and most chilling story telling ever to hit your TV.
938;"The acting was good and it would be a great movie to show at a Halloween gathering
939;the Headless Horseman himself, played to brilliance by Christopher Walken.
940;the special effects are wonderful in this movie, the costumes are nicely done, and the spooky atmosphere that is built from the opening credits on lends itself to the movie to great effect.
941;The haunted woods that the Horseman hunts through are beautifully creepy.
942;this is one of my favorite Burton/Depp movies.
943;When you see this movie you do feel as if your back in the 1800's, and every thing is nicely put together to add to that feel.
944;He's still a good actor today and I do think anyone would like to aleast see this movie once.
945;this movie is a great collectors add.
946;I really like this movie, Johnny Depp is a great actor, and I recommend this movie for anybody who likes slightly scary movies.
947;In a lot of ways, it's a really excellent movie.
948;First, the filming is just wonderful and fit's the story so well.
949;Those dark gloomy woods are wonderful and the film sites within the woods are just marvelous.
950;It's just a well done movie!
951;And the accompanying music by Danny Elfman suits the background and story so well and is a pleasure to listen to in itself.
952;Give me a lot of supernatural hocus.
953;But, it's a reconstruction of a highly acclaimed work of literature.
954;It's been a classic fiction story way back from when I was an undergraduate fifty years ago.
955;But, people love the story and just look at all the high ratings.
956;I'm sure the majority of people wound love this movie and it's so well done.
957;So basically, this is just a serial killer movie, except it takes place in 1799, and it's got a lot of Tim Burton wackiness added into it.
958;Reviewing this one is easy, really, and it can all be summed up in a single sentence: If you're interested in intriguing, surreal and beautiful imagery in movies, you simply have to watch this film.
959;There are very few films that can compare with the visual splendor of this movie, which is remarkable on pretty much all fronts from the costuming to set design to outdoor scenery to matte paintings to cinematography and so on.
960;The colors are all deep and strong, mostly earth tones, but with a sorta depth and intensity that the film never appears lifeless.
961;The scenery is particularly striking, with banks of fog all about, and the surreal forest, with the gnarled and dark, nearly charred looking trees against the yellowed leaves.
962;It's just amazing, and the film creates another world in a way more powerful and convincing than in any other film I can think of.
963;(They certainly still look great, however.
964;The casting was is appropriate, at least from a visual standpoint, as it includes plenty of odd looking people to fit in with the unusual world that they locate.
965;Elfman's score is your fairly typical Orchestral stuff, but it does work very well, and is both quite beautiful and quite eerie.
966;Some of it is fairly impressive, though most of it is done with CG effects, and I definitely prefer the real thing when it comes to gore effects.
967;If a movie looks this good I can put up with about anything else.
968;Still, it's more than worth seeing.
969;it is one of my favorite johnny depp movies.
970;once a gain he has master the old fable hero.
971;and that is the best review you'll ever need to read about this film.
972;Burton managed to make an outstanding picture, based on folklore, without being cheap or commercial.
973;The movie is funny, fast.
974;Johhny Depp gives total credibility to Incabold Jones, the great technical detective.
975;In the end there is some unforgettable humour scenes.
976;Funny also is Walken, who doesn't speak a world the whole movie !
977;This movie ruled,it's that simple.
978;I'm not a big Depp fan,but he was great in this.
979;It has it all it's scary,funny and action packed.
980;I can't do slasher films, I get too scared, but I love a good scary movie as much as the next girl :.)
981;As far as adaptations of old American novels go, Tim Burton's visually rich, tightly composed, resplendent version of Washington Irving's 'The Legend of Sleepy Hollow' ranks in the top echelon.
982;much of the magnificence of this film is due to the atmospheric set design by Rick Heinrichs (with art direction by Ken Court, John Dexter, and Andy Nicholson with set decoration by Peter Young) and Colleen Atwood's extraordinary costumes.
983;It is not usual to credit these artists when reviewing a film, but their contributions are an integral part of the success of the movie.
984;as far as acting, Johnny Depp as Ichabod Crane shines in a fully nuanced character portrayal complete with paraphernalia and ticks and mild madness.
985;They appear as though they are daguerreotypes, so perfectly in keeping with the time and period and mannerisms of Irving's novel.
986;The musical score by Danny Elfman and cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki are synchronous with Tim Burton's brilliant direction.
987;This is a treasure of a film.
988;The acting was good and all.
989;Good movie for free, just regret spending money on it.
990;A new Tim Burton movie is an event at the best of times, even for us limeys, so I was straight down to my local theatre on opening night .
991;Visually magnificent, as is par for the course with films by this maestro, but also enthralling, spooky and witty.
992;A modern tip of of the hat to the classic Hammer pictures of the 60's, with a Christopher Lee cameo to really push it home!
993;In this wonderful new film adaption of the classic story, Tim Burton continues his eerie but tasteful career in the strange.
994;the story in this movie itself flows along at a nice pace, never slowing down too much, and includes many twists along the way.
995;Johnny Depp, who plays Ichabod Crane, does a great job playing his part.
996;Christina Ricci does a good job playing a common townsgirl who is also slightly suspicious seeming.
997;one of the things that makes this movie so appealing is the new special effects that add to this already strong movie.
998;They enhance the visual experience, making this a good scary (but not too scary) movie to see.
999;SLEEPY HOLLOW is an incredible achievement.
1000;It succeeds on every level: script"
1001;Tim Burton has always had fantastic moods in all of his films.
1002;The forest scenes make you feel like a child again when you were scared of what lurked out THERE!
1003;The script builds and fleshes out the classic Irving fable with a detailed depiction ofthe creation of the headless horseman.
1004;Johnny Depp gives a fine restrained and subtle performance.
1005;(He's always so dependable for good acting.)
1006;Christopher Walken is a masterstroke in casting as the headless one.
1007;One of my favorites, Jeffrey Jones, again contributes a fine job.
1008;Once more Icannot give enough credit to the set design and FEEL of this film.
1009;Watch this with the lights out!
1010;Loosely based on both the original Washington Irving story as well as the Disney version, Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow takes a revisionist approach and ends up with a genuine horror classic.
1011;Christopher Walken is absolutely frightening as the horseman, and Christina Ricci and a cast of classic British actors flesh (pardon the pun) out the story with hints of shady business among the town's statesmen.
1012;The commentary by Burton is fairly optional, but the making of and other features enhance the movie superbly.
1013;Burton uses a foggy, bleached style to enhance the appearance and tone of the movie, creating a genuinely unique vision.
1014;A really good flick to watch on Halloween night.
1015;Its well made, with a storyline to keep your eyes on the screen for the whole lenth of the film, witch (hint, hint) as some parts horror and others full of storyline.
1016;This movie is too gritty and very violent, based in those middle ages where the Headless Horseman strikes terror into a small town, the tale is realistic and this movie will give you the chills, Jonny Deep and Christina Ricci are both great in this convincing horror.
1017;"The movie is very well directed by the Master Of Idiosyncrasy, Tim Burton (see ""Edward Scissorhands,"" a bittersweet love story, or""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber Of Fleet Street,"" a stylish and operatic ""Kill Bill"" set in Victorian England)."
1018;The performances in this movie are first.
1019;"I love the tender moments in the film (when Katrina holds Young Masbath in her arms and when she holds Ichabod in her arms)
1020;The suspense is chilling, and the ending will shock you.
1021;Very complex and intriguing gem of a film.
1022;The special features are quite interesting, beginning with a Making of featurette, and exclusive cast and crew interviews, which are very thorough.
1023;i highly recommend the film.
1024;One of Johnny Deeps best movies, not quite as good as From Hell but almost as in its class.
1025;The acting, costumes and cinemetography was absolutley amazing.
1026;the lines were witty and the characters were intresting.
1027;this will be an american movie classic
1028;The classic tale of Sleepy Hollow is brought blazingly alive in the competitive film year of 1999 and it has a lot to qualify for to be one of the year's best movies.
1029;It is truly one of the modern greats and one of the year's best films.
1030;The film has awesome mystery, horror, comedy, romance and fantasy balled into a great and amazingly intelligent script by Andrew Kevin Walker.
1031;In fact, this is one of the most well written and clever horror films of all time.
1032;Depp is in almost every scene, and he steals every one with his wit, great accent and great enthusiasm for the film.
1033;Christina Ricci is also very beautiful and mysterious, although a little out of her depth.
1034;I enjoyed Miranda Richardson's performance, and she has a surprising waiting in the end.
1035;The cinematography for the film is lush and stunning, the art and sets are fantastically Sleepy Hollow.
1036;ish, and the visuals are truly breathtaking.
1037;So much effort went into this film, and a lot of people brought the unforgettable story alive.
1038;But most of the credit must go to the visionary and endlessly plausible director Tim Burton, who, with his great ideas, vision, abilities and past credibility's, has the right stuff to make this movie the perfect horror.
1039;This is one of the most memorable movies I have ever had the pleasure of watching, and one of the creepiest too.
1040;perfect masterpiece that is Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow!
1041;The whole movie is dark and filled with lurking fog which gives a certain unsafe feeling.
1042;What it actually is, is a very clever update of the classic Hammer horror film formula.
1043;The Hammer formula was to take a well known story .
1044;the presence of the venerable Mr. Lee himself at the beginning of this movie is a dead giveaway"
1045;Johnny Depp's portrayal of Ichabod Crane is delightful.
1046;i never thought to use the words sexy and Miranda Richardson in the same sentence, but it happens here.
1047;to sum up, this movie is a lot of fun, and should not be taken terribly seriously.
1048;this movie works as both a suspense flick and a respectful but tongue.
1049;I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
1050;Tim Burton, the master of dark moody films, has probably created his best movie to date in this loving tribute to the old Hammer horror films.
1051;While not true to the letter of Washington Irving's classic tale, SLEEPY HOLLOW is very true to the story's spirit.
1052;Johnny Depp makes a most unconventional hero as Ichabod Crane, but he more than provides the glue which binds this flick together.
1053;Christina Ricci makes a good impression as the china doll like love of Ichabod's eye.
1054;A lot of Burton's usual acting stalwarts are solid in small roles including Micheal Gough and Jeffrey Jones.
1055;There is also a wonderful cameo by horror great Christopher Lee as the magistrate who sends Ichabod on his mission.
1056;This film is spooky, creepy and very funny.
1057;but for anytime you want to enjoy spooky thrills.
1058;Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci star in the Thanksgiving hit based on the novel by Washington Irving.
1059;The beautiful costumes distinguish the time period perfectly, and the dream sequences create the only color the film has.
1060;Depp gives his best performance in a long time as Ichabod Crane.
1061;He gives his eccentric character bothheart and humor and works well with Ricci.
1062;Despite their age difference, the two make the perfect movie couple with their on.
1063;screen chemistry as engaging as the film's cinematography.
1064;Sleepy Hollow was a wonderful film on the big screen but is even more visually haunting on the small screen.
1065;Sleepy Hollow is the perfect mix of humor, suspense, and romance in a movie and it looks really good doing it.
1066;Burton and Depp again prove how well they do when teamed up.
1067;Armed with scientific knowledge and a zest for bringing criminals to justice, Crane goes about trying to rationalize the deaths of people from seemingly supernatural means.
1068;depp is wonderful as the bumbling and easily disgusted Ichabod.
1069;He doesn't really have the stomach to be a crime scene investigator, but he does his best and with a hero that hides behind a child once and a woman another time, Depp still makes him extremely likable.
1070;The movie is bloody and has quite a bit of gore at some places, as a movie about headless bodies would imply, but it's an engaging piece that is perfect Halloween fare.
1071;I absolutely love this movie.
1072;Tim Burton does a fantastic job of creating a dark mood.
1073;Johnny Depp's character, Ichabod Crane is a quirky and amusing.
1074;The best is Christopher Walken as the Headless Horseman.
1075;i especially love johnny depp and tim burton.
1076;the film is beautiful and has an amazing atmosphere.
1077;Sleepy Hollow is in my opinion Tim Burton and Johnny Depp's best movies.
1078;It is a dark movie putting Washington Irving's classic story to the big screen.
1079;the movie is fascinating with a haunting score by Danny Elfman, gorgeous visuals, wonderful acting and an awesome ending.
1080;The movie also has awesome fights and adventure scenes.
1081;this movie is definitely on my top 25 films of all time.
1082;It's a movie that everyone should see.
1083;The visuals alone make this a must see.
1084;It's a movie that I will definitely rewatch soon and a lot in the future.
1085;While this isn't Tim Burton's best, but it is still a Very, very good, Very FUN movie!And this Blu.
1086;ray high def version looks absolutely great.
1087;"The girl that witnessed the beheading said that she ""sold her soul to satan that moment."
1088;"i also found the clash between science and religion (Christianity) and paganism and religion interesting, i. e., the comment of ""The only book you need to know is."""
1089;This was a nice spin on the short story of the same name.
1090;The twist and turns keep you guessing and the action keeps you on the edge of your seat.
1091;Tim Burton is crazy and brilliant.
1092;This story has been brought to life in such a creative and stylish way.
1093;Johnny Depp has such an awesome way of bringing his characters to life.
1094;This movie will be a classic someday.
1095;beat performance as an over.
1096;man i love this movie.
1097;the plot is great, the atmosphere is superb, and tim burton is a genius.
1098;the sword scenes are beautifully choreographed and my favorite part is when casper van dien is dismembered.
1099;Although I am usually unhappy when Hollywood drastically alters a classic, I was happily surprised with this film.
1100;The Oscar nomination for best cinematography is well earned.
1101;sleepy Hollow is not for young children or sensitive viewers as there is a lot of blood and gore, but everyone else should enjoy this film .
1102;Very, very good film indeed.
1103;The story opens up immediately and it has 'got' you till the end.
1104;The scenes are all very dark and misty and that adds to a good atmosphere throughout the whole film.
1105;It certainly has got some scary moments in it, but I think this film wasn't made to scare you.
1106;It's more like a 'thriller.
1107;BUT, despite that, a very good film you must see.
1108;Well, this is certainly brutal, talk about heads rolling!
1109;This is definitely filled with very grim/dark atmospheres.
1110;I think they did an outstanding job on this area, because it just adds to the morbid nature.
1111;This was a Christmas gift.
1112;I haven't reviewed it but the recipient seemed quite happy with it.
1113;esque, almost surreal imagery is in every flick.
1114;this however, is a pretty middle of the road effort that just kind of works.
1115;In any event, Depp gives a pretty solid performance.
1116;Again, if you're at all familiar with the folklore behind this flick, it's pretty darn interesting.
1117;Great scenery, good mood, predictable surprises, and decent effects.
1118;five bucks for something a little more worthy.
1119;Sleepy Hollow is a very good Tim Burton film with very powerful preformances from Deep and Ricci.
1120;But what won it for me was the fact Burton got Chris Walken to do the headless horseman role.
1121;To me he is a very talented actor, I hope Tim Burton and Deep do many more roles together.
1122;So if you like some horror mixed with few comedical lines then pick this movie up and see a new version and twist on the legend of Sleepy Hollow.
1123;Just a good old spook movie to entertain you on cold nights.
1124;studded (quasi horror but more of an) action/adventure flick is an immensely entertaining joyride!
1125;Practically all actors and actresses involved played their respective parts perfectly, almost as if they were born for these roles.
1126;Which is indeed very surprising .
1127;who would've thought that Depp, for instance, could portray a convincing (and hilarious!)
1128;As an amateur arnis / stickfighting afficionado, I found these particular scenes truly fun to watch, and I believe that they're a fine testament to the growing popularity and high screen impact of this particular martial art.
1129;Kudos likewise goes to the headless Hessian Horseman himself, Christopher Walken, who proved that great actors need not be given speaking lines to exhibit their remarkable talents.
1130;I'm sure it will make a fine and rewatchable addition to anyone's collection.
1131;Tim Burton did a fantastic version of Sleepy Hollow.
1132;I would recommend this movie.
1133;Sleepy Hollow Has just the right amount of everything to make it quite a memorable movie.
1134;The atmosphere that Sleepy Hollow portrays makes this moviea quite essential Halloween treat!
1135;It was a very well done Tim Burton film.
1136;Surprised people are more aware of it.
1137;Exactly what you would expect sleepy hollow to look like, Depp is perfect as Ichabod Crane, and the story is enticing.
1138;Brilliant casting/acting, excellent f/x and a good cameo by Christopher Walken as the grotesque headless horseman.
1139;Everyone put in a great performance in this movie, Christopher Walkin (doesn't he ever play anything other than a psycho in the movies?)
1140;I thought this film looked interesting when it first came out in the theaters but never got around to watching it.
1141;Johnny Depp shows his ability to create unique characters in his portrayal of Constable Ichabob Crane in this rendition of the classic tale.
1142;The film keeps you wondering throughout.
1143;That it won no major awards is a mystery, This film has everything going for it: great story, fastastic visuals and effects, great cast, and settings and atmospheres second to none I've seen well.
1144;"Yes, but Burton's violence is stylized and not really that gory but it is scary, filling the screen with amazing images of twisted trees, fogs, distant, haunted vistas
1145;Burton works many times with actors he's confortable with like Johnny Depp, excellent as Ichabod Crane, and and all.
1146;star suppoting cast, including Christine Ricci, Jeffery Jones, Michael Gabon, Michael Gogh (Burton's faithful butler Alfred in his two Batman movies) and cameos by Martin Landau (beheaded without having a line to utter), and Chistopher Lee, veteran of dozens of horror movies, a strong brief appearance and we hear that great booming voice of his.
1147;In its darkness, there is a beauty rare in any of this or any other year's films.
1148;Burton loves these gothic landscapes, and tales told by firelight and dark woods taking on a life of their own.
1149;This is a great film.
1150;Rarely does Burton repeat himself, risking his considerable powers on unusual prodjects like Sleepy Hollow, a film that will eventually become a classic in its genre.
1151;photography is wonderful, atmosphere very imaginatively done.
1152;good to great performances abound, as one after the other important townsmen gets their heads lopped off in high fashion.
1153;God love him!The script is fine for the chewing.
1154;The direction, darkly, bleakly, comedic, as the gorgeous dark cinematography graces your eyes glowing from the screen.
1155;A rich tapestry of dark hues and shades, contrasted by vividly bright hues, all in the right places, enhancing the viewing experience.
1156;a great film for Halloween, or any dreary grey day or stormy night.
1157;Sleepy Hollow will charm you, thrill you, and make you laugh!Heads up!
1158;Peter Van Garrett (Martin Landau) has just written a very important letter and sealed it in red wax with his symbol stamped on it.
1159;rick Heinrichs and Peter Young won the Academy Award for Best Art Direction.
1160;nominations also given for Best Cinematography and Costume Design.
1161;I always look for the fine details in a blu ray, and I was not let down.
1162;This is a very fine movie, made better by the upgrade to blu ray.
1163;Christopher Walken was pretty terrifying though!
1164;Follows the book fairly closely and that makes it a bit drawn out.
1165;The Washington Irving classic will always be remembered as the headless horseman tale with flaming pumpkins and an idiot hero.
1166;What Crane finds shocks and changes our hero slowly into a man.
1167;Sleepy Hollow is by far one of Tim Burton's greatest films.
1168;Ever since he captivated the world by bringing the real Batman to the big screen, ten years ago, he has always been flirting with making a great gothic horror film.
1169;Every film he has touched has been enchanted with gothic charisma.
1170;in Sleepy Hollow he finds his true calling as he delivers us into his gothic mystique.
1171;As he did in the first two Batman films, the camera stands back and then swoops into the great city of New York.
1172;This is Tim Burton at his best.
1173;In two other Tim Burton films Johnny Depp has opened us to the world of Burton much like Richard Dreyfuss did in early Steven Spielberg films.
1174;As Icabod explores the town to Sleepy Hollow we are treasured by the presence of other Tim Burton vets like Michael Gough, Jeffery Jones, Christopher Walken and Martin Landau.
1175;She has come along way from being Wednesday Addams.
1176;Sleepy Hollow will be remembered as one of Tim Burton's masterpieces.
1177;As for the actual story and such, I knew what to expect.
1178;It was the clarity that surprised me.
1179;But after doing the first two Batman films he began to mature and take on bigger and better projects.
1180;He has an extraordinary visual sense which shines through in Sleepy Hollow.
1181;It is a beautiful to just look at.
1182;The Production Design is also terrific.
1183;The action sequences are staged wonderfully and are very suspenseful.
1184;What keeps this film from being excellent is the script.
1185;Depp and Ricci are beleiveable in their roles and work well together on screen.
1186;The cast Burton put together for town is also quite good.
1187;This movie HAD potential and was interesting up to a point.
1188;Yes its got the original 90's theme of the evil intolerant Christians vs. the wholesome, good hearted witches who desire nothing more than to spread goodnes and mirth through the use of occult charms and satanic spells.
1189;They were outstanding and played likable, believable characters with their own neuroses, who were determined to survive the Headless Horseman.
1190;Miranda Richardson is as always a delight and easily stole the show.
1191;Tim Burton is one of my favorite film.
1192;makers and his use of color and lighting (or lack of) sets the stage perfectly.
1193;The setting and scenery were again perfection.
1194;Regardless, it is an excellent adaptation of an American classic and an ideal movie to play at Halloween.
1195;I like this movie very much, I am a Tim Burton fan for years, that's the main reason why I bought it"
1196;still I enjoy the movie very much!
1197;This is Tim Burton's homage to the great Hammer horror films of his youth, and it may be his most visually spectacular film ever.
1198;From Burton, that's saying quite a great deal, and should let you know that no matter what else the film is absolutely worth a close look (though prefarably on as large a screen as possible): the muted nightlike colors of the town are sumptuous, the Horseman is terrifying, and the cinematography is absolutely stunning.
1199;the story is quite exciting, and hardly ever lets up, although it's pretty easy to figure out early in the filom who is responsible for everything.
1200;i won't reveal the name here, but watch for the performance given after the revelation of the mastermind's identity: it's pretty unintentionally hilarious.
1201;I'm not necessarily a huge fan of Tim Burton, but I absolutely respect his craft and what he does.
1202;This movie is a perfect culmination of Burton's imagination combined with a timeless tale of horror.
1203;The Cinematography and the Art Direction are so perfect for the story that is being presented.
1204;The story intriguing, the performers st their best, and the movie simply fun.
1205;Superbly directed and amazing editing makes this a diamond in any collection.
1206;Sleepy Hollow starting Depp at one of his best interpretations of another complicated character.
1207;If you grew up having Grimm's fairy tales read to you, and you loved them, this movie is for you.
1208;Tim Burton and the marvelous cast do an incredible job of creating a hauntingly beautiful movie.
1209;The sets and photography are superb.
1210;I expect to view this movie, with children, many times, and each time to be transported into a wonderful world where children are good but vulnerable, stepmothers are wicked, and evil appears triumphant but is ultimately vanquished.
1211;Highly stylish and original thriller set in the imaginary town of Sleepy Hollow.
1212;The special effects are great (as with every Tim Burton film), and the cast is perfect.
1213;Johnny Depp may be the best young actor we have, and he plays the part of Icabod Crane to hilarious perfection.
1214;Even Christina Ricci gives a solid performance as his love interest.
1215;The action sequences featuring the headless horseman come fast and furious, and make this movie well worth your money.
1216;Ever since I saw this at the theatres I've loved Burton's take on an early American gothic legend of the Headless Horseman and Ichabod Crane.
1217;The casting is great, Depp and Richie have chemistry and Miranda Richardson is unforgetable in her role.
1218;Great cast and of course great orchestral score.
1219;Oh well, I thought, I have time to kill, I'll go anyway.
1220;That got me even more excited for Sleepy Hollow.
1221;I KNEW it would be good.
1222;the good: The film is beautiful.
1223;It and American Beauty were the two best.
1224;Everything from the colors to the framing was spot.
1225;The acting was great, and the action scenes were cool.
1226;Not a bad film (and the best for Burton, visuals.
1227;Nevertheless, lots of genre fans seem to love it, so byall means, try it at least once!
1228;I ended up seeing it again at a discount theater, and I liked it a bit more there, but not enough to pre.
1229;order it, even with the director's commentary.
1230;Now THERE is a Burton film that delivers on all counts!
1231;It's a good movie and the cast play their parts well.
1232;This is the absolute best movie in the entire world!
1233;Johnny Depp is one of my favorite actors(along with Ewan Mcgregor) The stunts are pure Nick Gillard (Star Wars) The whole movie is pure Tim Burton.
1234;She looks like she's 12 or 13!
1235;Johnny is perfect for the part of Ichabod!
1236;I was wrong this movie is an excellent film, it has very good acting by both Johnny Depp and Christina Riccha.
1237;A cool plot from an old story, but really weird twists are added to it to make the movie better.
1238;Also this is one great movie.
1239;It's scary, fun, sexy, and it has a lot of suspense.
1240;And this film version, brought to the screen by the very talented Tim Burton, brings Sleepy Hollow to life the way it should be.
1241;Johnny Depp and the very talented Christina Ricci play the lead roles and quite convincingly also.
1242;One of those few movies that actually take the original classic story and bring it to life without tarnishing it.
1243;Tim Burton has brought this literary masterpiece to life in a thrilling and suspenseful film.
1244;With excelent special effects, and great acting, this movie goes strait to the top of my list.
1245;Some may think this is a lame effect, but it really adds to the scenes.
1246;A great movie if your looking for something to keep you on the edge of your seat.
1247;top as these, although it still tells the story with a delightful tongue.
1248;Dark and complex with beautiful costumes and sets, this is a fantastic Halloween story.
1249;Burton really hit the nail on the head with this.
1250;I have a very healthy respect for this movie, and everyone that has watched it knows why.
1251;All in all, Sleepy Hollow is one of my favorite movies now, and.
1252;though I am surprised it is rated R. was very interesting.
1253;(I loved the part where the people's heads came ou of the tree and were moving around.
1254;I really enjoy watching this spin of the classic story around Halloween.
1255;One of my favorite Tim Burton movies.
1256;I was expecting the same old Ledgend of Sleepy Hollow, but was very surprised to see a diffrant view or story.
1257;The effects, There ,the acting, There, the plot, and so forth.
1258;Depp makes this film believable with his newly found dialect,maybe hes been around Madonna or something.
1259;com come's through once again with great value.
1260;Depp still brings much needed humor and charm to the film though.
1261;Ray Park shows once again why he's one of the best stunt men as the Headless Horsemen, the guy's movement is incredible.
1262;Christina Ricci has fine chemistry with Depp and gives her best performance as well.
1263;Tim Burton was the perfect person to bring this story life although it's not exactly faithful to the original story much at all.
1264;Still though Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow is a new Horror classic that could be compared to the original Frankenstein and Dracula movies.
1265;Sleepy Hollow is probably his best work to date and I wouldn't mind another film from him like it.
1266;everything is better in Blu.
1267;It has an interesting twist at the end!
1268;What makes this film really work is the terrific, spooky atmosphere, from the marvelous opening credits that swim eerily onto the screen and evanesce into ghostly nothingness, to the dark and gloomy environs of Sleepy Hollow itself, with its haunted forest and its crazily corkscrewed death tree, under which lie the heads of the victims of the Headless Horseman.
1269;Johnny Depp gives an excellent performance as Ichabod Crane, and Christina Ricci makes a winning Katrina Van Tassel.
1270;"The special effects are impressive, to say the least
1271;Tim Burton clearly enjoys his craft.
1272;atmosphere and sets are as important as characterization in a Burton piece, and SLEEPY HOLLOW never disappoints in any of these elements.
1273;Irving's original story was mostly about mood, and that's what Burton is after here.
1274;The commentary certainly has its moments .
1275;Still, SLEEPY HOLLOW is Burton at his finest
1276;This movie is a must see.
1277;It's cinematography is excellent, as are all the performances.
1278;Tim Burton has again done an excellent job at directing.
1279;This movie is spooky and yet somewhat romantic.
1280;This good offering from Tim Burton is bound to please his fans.
1281;The movie is visually captivating, with a grand style all it own.
1282;The sets (almost all of it was done on soundstages) are magnificent.
1283;i also greatly admire Danny Elfman's musical score which adds immensly to the fim.
1284;featurette detailing the filming and the comlicated special effects.
1285;Tim Burton did an excellent job of Washington Irving's novel The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow .
1286;Burtons adaption of the novel is clever and interesting.
1287;A murder mystery in the 1790's is just what the movie needed.
1288;Johnny Depp did a superb job as Ichabod Crane and Christina Ricci is suprisingly effective as an innocent love interest.
1289;Most brilliant casting was Christopher Walken as the Headless Horseman.
1290;Unquestionably one of Tim Burton's best films to date.
1291;Burton is, of course, the greatest living film director, and Sleepy Hollow lives up to his standard of beautiful film making.
1292;The camera work and lighting is suburb is this movie and this is one film that you should watch on the big screen.
1293;Mr. Burton manages to capture the mood and the eerieness of the era with uncanny and unsettling accuracy.
1294;Christina Ricci also gives an excellent performance in this film as the mysterious girl who may or may not be hiding a secret.
1295;He is good and he makes this movie work.
1296;good looking man but thats hard to do when Johnny Depp is in that role.
1297;I loved it from start to finish and it's a great film to watch on cloudy days.
1298;(Johnny is great as usual!)
1299;This is a fun movie to watch and, at times, pretty scarey.
1300;Johnny Depp is a very skillful actor and he handles his role with professionalism.
1301;This movie is under $10.00 and weel worth the price .
1302;So, grab you're sweetie, some popcorn and enjoy.
1303;A true masterpiece of film making.
1304;Ironically, I thought the best performances were given by the supporting actors, not the main cast.
1305;If that's true, it definitely shows.
1306;Crane then says, """"This shows there was a powerful singular thrust to the neck."""""""
1307;last, because it has a lighter tone and an upbeat ending.
1308;But it's good enough to watch any time of year.
1309;fun fact: Christopher Walken plays the Horseman.
1310;Sleepy Hollow is one of the great horror films.
1311;It's a Tim Burton film that is a mix of spookiness, evil, gore, and humor.
1312;It all seems to work rather nicely.
1313;The acting is top notch.
1314;Johnny Depp is splendid in the role of Ichabod Crane.
1315;Christopher Walken is perfect for the role of the Headless Horseman.
1316;Christina Ricci does a great job as well in the role of Katrina Van Tassel.
1317;this is a scary movie with an atmosphere and setting that really works.
1318;The trees in the woods are leafless and abundant.
1319;"The Headless Horseman's ""home"" is the scariest looking tree you'll ever see."
1320;The town dwellings and structures such as the church, the windmill and private residences fit so well with the time period.
1321;if you're up for a great horror movie, then definitely get this movie and watch it late at night on Halloween night after the trick.
1322;It is scored by Danny Elfman, one of the great movie soundtrack composers.
1323;This movie doesn't follow Washington Irving's novel to a T, but it is spooky and entertaining and that's what really matters in a movie like this.
1324;In the trend of other Tim Burton films, the complextion of the film is creamy, and satisfying.
1325;It tells the common veiwer about Sleepy Hollow, yet puts new tantalizing details in the middle of well known scenes.
1326;The cast is believable, yet the only weak point is Christina Ricci, who seems to be trying to hard to pull off her role.
1327;The cinematography is brilliant, something only Tim could do.
1328;It becomes dark at the right moments, and is bright and sugar.
1329;sweet when it tells the back story of Johnny Depp's mother, and once again is dark as it learns her fate.
1330;This film is not only wonderfully thrilling, but comedic in points where you would think it couldn't.
1331;Johnny Depp is a wonderful pick for this movie, as he gives us exactly what we want from anyone playing Ichabod Crane, plus a little bit more.
1332;That is a good thing.
1333;(please note that not all commercial is [bad] and not all [stuff] is commercial) Anyway, I really enjoyed the movie and indeed, I bought it.
1334;It was dark and mysterious and whodunnit and magical and they didn't really follow up with the gadget thing.
1335;Sleepy Hollow was a great movie.
1336;I would highly recommend this movie.
1337;Movie was in great shape, shipped fast, got it here in time for Christmas, sister was very pleased.
1338;Johnny Depp is great in this film.
1339;I liked that Tim burton directed this.
1340;Its a unique take on Sleepy Hollow.
1341;One has to wonder just how Tim Burton sees the world around him.
1342;Assuming you can see though its typically Burton.
1343;Sleepy Hollow is a smooth spooky film.
1344;Overall I thought the film was very well done and the decapitations and other death scenes were brilliant, so I would have to give Burton two thumbs up.
1345;As usual, Depp's performance is priceless and flawless.
1346;great ensemble acting from the entire case.
1347;Not a real horror film, funny.
1348;Depp is always adaptable to any role.
1349;The twist of events will surely catch you off.
1350;johnny Depp/Ichabod was a funny character.
1351;He made me laugh all through the movie.
1352;It is rare that you see the lead character bringing the light/funny moments in a suspense/thriller movie.
1353;christina Ricci likwise played the role quite well.
1354;overall, I recommend viewers to watch the movie.
1355;It's a good movie not a waste of time at all.
1356;*Sleepy Hollow* is a clever retelling of Washington Irving's folksy horror tale.
1357;If this story had to be redone, we can go ahead and thank our lucky stars that a legitimate cinematic visionary like Tim Burton did it for us.
1358;The sets and photography are as outstanding as you might expect from a Burton film .
1359;The costumes are surprisingly accurate, the only anachronisms being some weird autopsy tools and far.
1360;But even that makes sense, given Burton's conception of the hero: the director obviously is aware of the intense debate between Science and Faith during the time period he's depicting, and this debate is brilliantly characterized by Ichabod Crane (very well.
1361;This new conception of the Crane character as a Constable is the best thing in the film.
1362;It provides intellectually stimulating ideas as well as helping to make this old tale a neat murder mystery.
1363;The scenery and costumes are magnificent.
1364;The creepy surroundings are so stylish they are almost beautiful.
1365;This is a version that will even scare the adults.
1366;I loved this movie almost as much as Edward Scissorhands.
1367;It is a fantastic moody atmospheric horror movie.
1368;All I'll say about the movie is that is was entertaining, scary, good, what makes this movie excellent is the techniques Burton used.
1369;This makes the splashes of color in the movie that much more powerful and visually stunning.
1370;Sleepy Hollow is the perfect movie for the Burton look.
1371;He and Depp did a great job in this movie.
1372;Fantastic acting on the part of all.
1373;The movie is very graphic in it's violence but it was done very well.
1374;Christopher Walken is great in this movie as well.
1375;Having said that Johnny Depp gave an outstanding performance of Ichabod Crane.
1376;type horror will nail you to your seat.
1377;johnny Depp is surprisingly good as the earnest young Ichabod Crane, summoned from New York City to investigate the bizarre happenings in the village.
1378;Christina Ricci's nuanced performance as his romantic interest is well performed.
1379;The dreamy, greyish lighting and the haunting music contribute to the constant spooky feeling this movie conveys.
1380;To say simply: Great Film.
1381;The atmosphere is absolutely gorgeous.
1382;known actors, this film is a hit and a half.
1383;But this film is definitely worth seeing nonetheless.
1384;Product came as advertised, and in a timely manner.
1385;Excellent movie for mature viewers.
1386;This movie was not a thing like the book, but I thought it was a good movie.
1387;Tim Burton is a pretty good Director because he has a connection, he is weird and very smart.
1388;These two men are a perfect pair when it comes to movies, and it gets even better when you add Christopher Walken and Christina Ricci.
1389;Great movie so much blood it's unbelievable so it's not scary just thrilling.
1390;I always enjoy his work, even if I don't enjoy the story.
1391;But what a plus when the story's really fun as well?
1392;The more I see it, the more enjoyable it becomes.
1393;And I'm grateful to have this new interpretation of the story available to me.
1394;plus, this movie is just plain fun!
1395;I absolutely loved this movie.
1396;While not an absolute masterpiece, Sleepy Hollow was a most enjoyable movie.
1397;I also thought the effects were AWESOME.
1398;The acting was good as well.
1399;I highly recommend seeing it when you get a chance!
1400;All these years I have watched movies and I never knew this.
1401;Whilst Johnny Depp is fantastic as the lead, that doesn't make the movie.
1402;And I thought that in this day and age we could do better than poster paint for blood.
1403;this is an excellent movie.
1404;It has great acting, plot, and an excellent set.
1405;The atmosphere created by the fog costumes and actors is creepy and captivating.
1406;It's hard to describe such an odd, yet incredible movie.
1407;It's everything you have come to know and love from his movies.
1408;Anyone who grew up intrigued with the original Legend of Sleepy Hollow should find this movie fascinating!
1409;elements that pave the way for a great movie.
1410;Special effects are spectacular .
1411;The cinematography is excellent/creepy .
1412;really puts you in the mood for a good 'ghost' story.
1413;This is a good movie, if you like Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci.
1414;The movie has some funny parts and isn't really scary at all, but still a good movie.
1415;"I've always enjoyed Burton's work, but I felt that he might have gone a little overboard with the second ""Batman"" flick."
1416;Johnny Depp is perfectly cast as Ichabod Crane.
1417;He's a chicken, yet a brilliant mind lies under that facade.
1418;"Christina Ricci, as Katrina Van Tassel, is also perfectly cast, since she combines beauty, brains, and ""goth"" all into one."
1419;Miranda Richardson is another standout as Katrina's wicked stepmother.
1420;Jeffrey Jones, underrated since the dawn of time, has a smaller role in this flick, but his acting skills make his character shine.
1421;the special effects were excellent.
1422;was an excellent choice for the Horseman.
1423;It has just enough scares in it to mess with the younger kids(though anyone under thirteen should probably steer clear of this one), just enough fight sequences for the action fan, and great acting coupled with a plotline that'll keep even the toughest critic at attention.
1424;But I give this great movie a 5!
1425;Worth watching more then once.
1426;A bit graphic perhaps, but still a great movie.
1427;This movie was surprisingly better than I thought it would be.
1428;Johnny Depp gives a very good comedic performance.
1429;All around it's a very good movie.
1430;I love this movie, it is totally the best film of 1999.
1431;The most stylish and best horror in a long time.
1432;this movie has it all!
1433;Should of won over American Beauty at the Oscars.
1434;It's a real good classic just like Beetlejuice.
1435;Yes, visually it was pleasing but the characters were one.
1436;dimensional and hyperbolic with few exceptions.
1437;"factor going on, but it's a great watch on nights leading up to Halloween
1438;I can't speak to how this compares to other editions of the movie, but I was satisfied with this one.
1439;In a way, these scenes make the science versus superstition subplot of the film what it is: fascinating rather than insulting.
1440;another credit to this film and its makers is the power of its characterizations.
1441;swinging scenes, but his head is blue.
1442;a look at the film on the Internet Movie Database reveals that, like a lot of Tim Burton films, this movie divides opinion as thoroughly as the modern.
1443;In a nutshell, if you want an intelligent film with well.
1444;developed characters and an almost flawless plot, then Sleepy Hollow is most certainly the one to look at.
1445;Quite why it only received one Academy Award for Art Direction when there are performances, special effects, and a script worthy of such recognition, in contrast to the films that actually won these awards, most notably The Matrix, is beyond me.
1446;I hate to give it 1 star because I do love this movie, but I also feel that most of you already have an opinion of the film and aren't here to read what mine is.
1447;imagining to a new level!
1448;Depp is brilliant as Ichabod Crane and the all star cast really makes this film a treat.
1449;Visually, the effects and sets create a mood that is essential to taking the viewer on a frightful ride through a well known legend.
1450;Walken as the Hessian, and I mean bad as """"good"""" here, The Ugly ."""
1451;With his signature quirky wit and charm, Johnny Depp shines as the title character, Ichabod Crane, in Sleepy Hollow.
1452;telling of Washington Irving's masterpiece in true Tim Burton style.
1453;It is beautifully filmed and a pleasure to watch.
1454;exciting and humorous in a slightly dark or macabre way.
1455;The color of the film, the mood, and acting of Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, Miranda Richardson, and the legendary Christopher Walken adds to the stylish rendition of Washington Irving's short story.
1456;Although there were more added to the original story such as the backstory on Miranda Richardson and the romance between Christina Ricci's character with Johnny Depp, this is one version of Sleepy Hollow that sends chills down your spine and still manage to entertain both genders.
1457;Tim Burton's take on Washington Irving's spooky headless horseman tale is one of the most fantastic horror movies ever made.
1458;An unsettling and sometimes shocking film, this is stylish, sexy and wonderful cinema that should not be missed by any fan of the genre.
1459;time fan of Johnny Depp and owner of 25 of his movies, I have always loved Hollow since it scared the hell out of me in the cinema.
1460;Depp turns in one of his best performances yet, playing the queasy doctor Ichabod Crane to pleasing effect.
1461;Danny Elfman draws on past BATMAN music for the unsettling but refreshingly original score.
1462;"Anyway, this is my favorite Burton film and a modern classic, worthy of the title ""Most beautiful horror movie ever made""."
1463;Burton's visionary touch takes the tone much deeper than the animated 1958 Disney version, with the headless horseman lopping off heads all over the place.
1464;The desaturated color and stunning cinematography goes a long way to making the action and shocking decapitations just that bit more gruesome, yet at some times, strangely poetic.
1465;The screenplay, written by Andrew Kevin Walker (Se7en and 8mm) is fitting to the film's thematic touch and overall bizzaro Burton.
1466;Danny Elfman's downright chilling score takes the darkness even further.
1467;But there is humor amidst the full.
1468;"blooded ghost story
1469;This is Burton's weirdest film since Batman Returns.
1470;I enjoyed this film from beginning to end.
1471;A few minor content flaws, but nothing to make a fuss about and overall, quite enjoyable, especially if you're into Halloween like I am.
1472;I really had no expectations before watching this movie but REALLY enjoyed it.
1473;Depp was excellent in the role of Ichabod Crane.
1474;Tim Burton is a master at this type of film.
1475;She is absolutely stunning in this film.
1476;She makes this film worth seeing over and over again.
1477;Tim Burton's latest film plays more like an action movie than a horror but is so stylish and exciting it makes for an excellant movie.
1478;He is quickly swept up into a world of ghouls, witchcraft and conspiracy.
1479;He delevers lines with such greatness that he plays there humour or seriousness perfectly.
1480;Ricci is also good as his love interest.
1481;He swings his sword so well and has such a demenor about him that you can't help but sort of route for him.
1482;so all in all, it is a well played, beautifully directed and very exciting thriller which I would recommend to anybody, art film lovers and blockbuster lovers alike.
1483;Tim Burton has definitely outdone himself with Sleepy Hollow .
1484;I loved reading The Legend of Sleepy Hollow but, the movie is just incredible.
1485;I also found it kind of funny especially the number of times Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) passed out.
1486;Christina Ricci also puts on a spectacular performance as the lovely Katrina Van Tassel.
1487;I give Sleepy Hollow 2 thumbs up.
1488;expectations, besides the fact that I didn't really think it would be very good.
1489;Depp gives us a very human hero, full of his ideas and certanties at first, then slowly beginning to doubt what he himself sees.
1490;burton imbues this film with a very dry wit, making it hilarious in parts, and the humor coupled with the nervousness it gives you makes for quite a laugh.
1491;The whole film was pretty good.
1492;I had never watched Sleepy Hollow before and I really enjoyed this movie.
1493;The movie was suspenseful and the acting was well done.
1494;Christina Ricci was cool too.
1495;Better than many of the old classics.
1496;This is Tim Burton at his best.
1497;As a child, I loved the gothic tale of the Headless Horseman .
1498;Johnny Depp is well cast as the somewhat nervous, eccentric, but always ernest Ichabod Crane.
1499;Christina Ricci is beautiful and Christopher Walken is perfect as the Horseman.
1500;Miranda Richardson is delicious and one might imagine that she thoroughly enjoyed playing her role.
1501;The old animated Disney version is better suited for the little ones.
1502;the cinematography is marvelous .
1503;watch for the changes from the vibrant red Cardinal in the beginning to the near black and white motif in Sleepy Hollow.
1504;Superb fantasy, great score by Danny Elfman, and a thrilling ride through the forest.
1505;Turn off the lights, get out the popcorn, and enjoy the fun.
1506;I'd give it 4.5 stars.
1507;As with all films today, this is best seen in widescreen (""""Letterbox"""")."""
1508;The scenery and sets are beautiful, and the costumes, particularly Lady Van Tassel's dresses, are marvelous.
1509;Add to this the dazzling special effects of the numerous beheadings and the Horseman himself, and you've got a great film.
1510;On top of all this, Burton has recruited some amazing acting talent.
1511;I thoroughly enjoyed the director's commentary by Tim Burton, although he seems to have an unhealthy fascination for Jeffrey Jones's wig.
1512;The interviews with the cast and crew were fun, and the Behind the Legend featurette was informative and interesting.
1513;All in all, _Sleepy Hollow_ is a great film and worth owning.
1514;Great movie one of the few Tim Burton's movies I liked.
1515;Liked the humor in the movie.
1516;A great movie from the late 90's.
1517;I love a good scary movie now and then.
1518;The story follows Washington Irving's story somewhat, but put a whole new spin on it.
1519;Excellent story and scary, too.
1520;the headless horseman is my fave Halloween persona and he is my hero.
1521;also Ebenezer scrooge and the Christmas carol.
1522;Along with the Blair With Project, this is definitely my favorite Nineties.
1523;Because it has more style.
1524;Think what you will, I would recommend this movie to everyone and I'm gonna call on some headless Horsemen if it isn't under my Christmas Tree next time!
1525;I really enjoyed this movie.
1526;Johnny Depp does a wonderful job, as always.
1527;Tim burton's genius and the music by Danny Elfman, [both of which did the nightmare before christmas movie], brings the story to life.
1528;And the plot line between the characters was creative, although sometimes confusing.
1529;I recommend this movie very much.
1530;Tim Burton is wonderful as are the characters, and, if I'm not mistaken, I don't see you making or acting in movies.
1531;And she shows exactly Ichobod Crane opinion, but in a wonderful way that makes you think that he is actually right and there really is no horseman.
1532;I also loved the way Tim Burton actually created an ending to the headless horseman tale.
1533;I, and anyone who hates an ending that leaves you hanging on what happened to the end, will love how it ends.
1534;This is the best movie I've ever seen!
1535;I really recomend you see SLEEPY HOLLOW!
1536;The movie Sleepy Hollow (based upon a story by Washington Irving) has an interesting twist in Tim Burtons version.
1537;Christopher Lee offers an excellent performance in a small bit part at the very beginning which really sets the mood somehow for the entire movie.
1538;This movie is a must for Christopher Lee, Johnny Depp, or Christina Ricci fans for their collection at home because they all really give some of theirbest performances in this film.
1539;Christopher Walken is good in every movie he stars in so it makes perfect sense he'd be in the best Sleepy Hollow I've ever watched.
1540;he plays the perfect headless horseman and Miranda Richardson apart from havinga very expressive face and beautiful eyes plays her part exceedingly well also.
1541;I recommend Sleepy Hollowfor everyones Halloween traditions and movie collection.
1542;I have viewed it several times.
1543;The photography of Sleepy Hollow is absolutely stunning.
1544;deserved Academy Award for it.
1545;Sleepy Hollow is truely a visual masterpiece!
1546;The acting is good, and so is the dialogue.
1547;It also has some very good comical moments.
1548;up film, or a subtle, comedy.
1549;bUT it is a great movie and (surprise!)
1550;It is witty, scary, moody, mesmerising and fun.
1551;The story of the Headless Horseman is a classic and this film brings it to life in a manner no 1950s film ever could.
1552;even Johnny D manages to keep me absorbed!
1553;After seeing the movie Sleepy Hollow which is directed by my favorite director, Tim Burton, I automatically decided that this would be my favorite movie of all time.
1554;I really love gory movies and this movie is far the goriest movie I have ever seen (This and Braveheart, of course.)
1555;and I was quite pleased at the graphics that this movie brought.
1556;Before you watch this movie, please have a heatry meal!
1557;Yes, it was not as scary as many people would think, due to the fact that it was directed by Tim Burton and had to do with gruesome murders, but the lost scares are made up for with superb acting and excellent storytelling.
1558;Sleepy Hollow, I feel, is one of the greatest movies I have seen in years, tied with Aliens and Predator.
1559;Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, and Christopher Walken (who doesn't get enough credit for this movie) play wonderfully and captivate your sould with marvelous acting.
1560;This is a great movie.
1561;Ichabod Crane, played by Johnny Depp, has such a mix of emotions, which Johnny Depp plays wonderfully.
1562;He is scared and smart and sad and even funny.
1563;I think this is the funniest part of the movie.
1564;The way Tim Burton made this movie is amazing.
1565;The colors, the atmosphere, and the set are perfect for the story.
1566;And the music that Danny Elfman wrote compliments the images and mood perfectly.
1567;tim burton and johnny depp create magic again with this deliciously creepy deptiction of the classic ichabod crane and the legend of sleepy hollow tale.
1568;"the twists and turns added for a ""real"" feeling of mystery only add to the enjoyment of this film."
1569;well told, brilliantly directed, and wonderfully acted, this movie is fantastically gorey and fun.
1570;This movie is not only a spooky, horror story, it has beautiful cinematography and the clothes are beautiful.
1571;"It's not your average horror movie
1572;Definitely a GREAT movie, Sleepy Hollow, brings to the screen the story of the Headless Horseman.
1573;johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, Miranda Richardson, Christopher Lee, Richard Griffiths, Jeffrey Jones, Christopher Walken, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% making this movie one of the best of its kind.
1574;The actors' great talent and chemistry clearly shows, thus providing an entertaining film that can be watched over and over again.
1575;Great movie and just in time for Halloween.
1576;As a horror movie it could have been so much more gothic and subtle.
1577;He's always been a little offbeat himself, and so this role suits him well.
1578;She has never looked more beautiful, slimmed down and dressed in the outfits of a rich young lady.
1579;miranda Richardson as Lady Van Tassel was excellent, bringing just the right amount of sexiness and horror into her performance.
1580;She definitely outshone the younger actors.
1581;this is a good story and the script done well.
1582;It swept me along in the mystery and there were enough twists and turns of the plot to keep me interested.
1583;I loved all the chases and spooky sounds and startling details.
1584;The scenery was just right and cinematography excellent, often shot in shadow with filtered lenses.Yes.
1585;I found it entertaining although its not for everyone and certainly not one I would rush out to try to see.
1586;But if you're in the right mood for this kind of a yarn, you might just enjoy it.
1587;usually I HATE it when a classic story is updated , but I've got to admit that I really enjoyed Sleepy Hollow with Johnny Depp.
1588;Black humor, to be sure, but I really enjoyed this version of Washington Irving's horror story.
1589;One of my favorite Halloween movies ever!
1590;Great classic story that never gets old.
1591;I thought this movie was great.
1592;The graphics were terrific, storyline followed the book, and not to mention Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci were in the starring roles makes this film splendid.
1593;he does his best to catch the quirks of every character he plays, and Ichabod Crane is a quirky guy!
1594;Christina Ricci has matured from Wednesday Addams into a beautiful and talented Katrina Van Tassel.
1595;The original short story is enriched well and loaded with the best talents from Miranda Richardson to Michael Gambon and more.
1596;I thought it's pretty beautiful and very entertaining, and I enjoyed Depp's and everyone's performance.
1597;since growing into an adult this is the first time I was scared so much!!!
1598;If you love Johnny Depp, you'll love this movie.
1599;Great way to tell the age old story of Sleepy Hollow.
1600;This movie will immediately have you interested!
1601;Sleepy Hollow is one of my very favorite Johnny Depp movies.
1602;This movie came on time and the packaging was in perfect condition.
1603;Very entertaining and a must see for Johnny Depp fans.
1604;Sleepy Hollow is a rare blend of gothic atmosphere, slice.
1605;Tim Burton fleshes out the legend of the Headless Horseman and creates a starkly striking and frightening world.
1606;with the deft touch that Burton has at his best he builds a world of unparalleled imagination that is completely believable.
1607;And in Sleepy Hollow, that world is the stage for a story that's thrilling and with just the right amount of twisty.
1608;Tim burton comes through with a great version of this movie.
1609;Christoffer Walkmen is the best as the headless horseman.
1610;Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is sent to Sleepy Hallow to find and capture the Horseman (wonderfully played by Christopher Walken).
1611;The special effects are great, the acting is superb and this is definately a film that will scare and make you laugh, all at the same time.
1612;For all that it's worth, Burton did a nice job with presentation of Sleepy Hollow.
1613;We all watched it that day, and it was pretty good.
1614;Must watch this movie, its a Classic.
1615;Well known actors and great special effects.
1616;it is funny when they are telling the tale of the Headless Horseman and how he bacame headless because he was hideing in the woods and found two little girls there and said, Shhh.
1617;I can watch this movie over and over.
1618;It allows you to feel like you are living in Sleepy Hollow.
1619;If you ever heard the Tale of Sleepy Hollow growing up then you must see this movie.
1620;Its the same basic tale but with a few new twists that make it as great as possible.
1621;A word to the wise however, the amount of blood shed in the film is vast.
1622;If you're queasy, make sure you're prepared to close those eyes tight!
1623;Nonetheless, the film is perfect for young and old, well, not too young!
1624;Johnny Depp is marvelous and quirky
1625;As a summary, I do not recommend this movie, particularly to a younger audience.
1626;This was the best 1800 scenery and costumes I've ever seen in a movie.
1627;Combined with the clever use/lack of color, they conjured up an image of precisely what we would think 1800 New England would look and feel like.
1628;In fact, it was much more entertaining and satisfying than the original.
1629;For that much money, you would expect her to be able to fake it , but it was still a decent job.
1630;She has proven worthy with perfect performances in Merlin and Alice in Wonderland .
1631;christopher Walken was absolutely incredible and easily stole the show!!
1632;He was a perfect choice for the role and will be the face to remember the movie by (Sorry Johnny).
1633;This movie is a work of art.
1634;winning production designer had an extrordinary visual imagination.
1635;tim Burton brings it to life.
1636;combining scary moments, a romantic lovestory and comical elements this is a MUST see movie.
1637;johnny Depp plays Ichabod with such a delicious irony it is a real pleasure to watch him solving the crimes in Sleepy Hollow, where a headless horseman is chopping off heads.
1638;parts adds too the mood of this beautiful film.
1639;Have long loved this tale and this film did not disappoint.
1640;Dark, eerie and hauntingly beautiful.
1641;A style that can only be Burton, the art was beautiful.
1642;This time of the year has always been my favorite.
1643;So I take my pleasure where it comes.
1644;So naturally this film is a great favorite of mine.
1645;It was beautifully shot and acted.
1646;The scenes were Ichabod dreams about his childhood are beautiful.
1647;to us Americans who grew up with this story well, we love the movie.
1648;The soundtrack is great also, trust me I have it!
1649;New twist on a halloween story.
1650;bravo,BravoBlood and guts for all ages.
1651;I saw the trailer for this movie and it went straight to the top of my must.
1652;This movie has A+ actors, direction, atmosphere, setting, effects.
1653;There were so many breathtaking scenes that I couldn't even list them.
1654;It's definitely an entertaining movie and it has a lot of strengths.
1655;i would recommend this movie for its good points.
1656;Batman was superb, Batman: Returns was mediocre"
1657;Sleepy Hollow, on the other hand, is probably Burton's best film, because though he changes Washington Irving's original story quite a bit, he does such a good job of it that most people shouldn't or won't care.
1658;That and the film, the acting, the sets.
1659;everything look so darn good, that one can't help but to enjoy this retelling of one of America's first fairy tale.
1660;There have been better on.
1661;Depp's performance is wonderful, bringing to mind an absent minded professor who succeeds inspite of himself.
1662;greys, greens, browns and black is enhanced, giving the film a Dickensian dream.
1663;So many movies these days like to cover the motivations of their villains in high minded ideals, but in Sleepy Hollow's case, it's good old fashioned greed, spite and revenge.
1664;everyone is superb in their roles.
1665;cheek action film, complete with chases, a grand explosion, sword fights and gun battles.
1666;But everything is so seamlessly crafted that it carries the viewer along.
1667;It has lots of atmosphere and manages to be genuinely creepy at times, even providing a few scares.
1668;something truly hard to accomplish in a film these days.
1669;A good twist on an old tale by a director who is coming into his own.
1670;This is a great movie.
1671;A good one to watch not just on Halloween but anytime.
1672;He's an excellent actor, but I must say some of the movies (not necessarily the characters) leave me cold.
1673;This one is one of his more interesting characterizations.
1674;This is one that I can actually watch over.
1675;Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci do a great job of this legendary tale as well as Tim Burton's all time grim view excellently put as always, of Icabod Crane and the great Holloween American Tale of the Headless Horse man and how he deducts things from an official investigator's point of view even when things he has to accept from Hell enter the picture in an original yet classical point of view.
1676;The photography and sets are just perfect for this story, and the acting is top notch as well.
1677;Just an overall entertaining popcorn movie with with high production values.
1678;Johnny Depp continues to be one of the most underrated actors around.
1679;He has more range and faces than 80% of Hollywood.
1680;This is my favorite of his films because, while it still has all the usual elements, including a rather flat plot arc that plods from A to B to C, it manages to stay engaging throughout and still closes the plotline in a satisfying way.
1681;wise at the end, Sleepy Hollow stays cohesive and clear all through, and has the same spectacular Burton visual style.
1682;Otherwise, she's as good as anyone in the film and the character actors that glut this thing are fantastic and many.
1683;As usual, this actor gives you your money's worth.
1684;Strongly recommend to all fans of J. Depp
1685;I really enjoy this version Sleepy Hollow, Johnny Depp and Ms Ricci are outstanding.
1686;I would recommendHolds your interest, What a great way to improve the cartoon version.
1687;I saw, this it was good and alittle scary it's not based, on a true story.
1688;but I liked, this movie good.
1689;I know other people loved it.
1690;"forget about any others
1691;Well done, exciting and stayed close to the classic storyline.
1692;It is brilliantly made so that the viewer really does know the town of Sleepy Hollow.
1693;The main titles grab you by your neck and pull you in.
1694;I have found myself liking it more and more, and I am appreciating the depth and confusion of the plot.
1695;You really have to understand it to love it.
1696;the main focus of this film is not the story, however, but it is the absolutely stunning and beautiful visual rush it delivers.
1697;The actual town was built for the film, and it is brilliantly constructed to form the film into a work of art.
1698;The other main set of the woods was built on a soundstage, but Tim Burton does a flawless job of creating it to be and outdoor world of magic and mystery.
1699;His collar was made inside the computer and it looks completely real.
1700;i can't tell people enough that they have to see this film because it is a true form of what the art of film should be, and it is so elegant at times that you will almost be forced to love it.
1701;Johnny Depp's perfomance is brilliant as Ichabod Crane, the nutty detective from New York.
1702;He makes the film very funny at times, and he creates a VERY unlikely hero.
1703;Christina Ricci is spellbinding as the absolutely beautiful Katrina Van Tassel.
1704;She plays her roal wonderfully, creating a sense of mystery.
1705;This is by far her best performance that I've seen, and she makes this film even more beautiful.
1706;Christopher Walken's short role is great, and he truly creates a frightening horsemen.
1707;Tim Burton's classic vission of this story is so wonderful in every way.
1708;The town itself will live inside you when you are watching this film, and you will want to experience it again and again.
1709;It is a really great movie.
1710;I thought that it was just one of the best movies ever.
1711;The story line was really really great.
1712;It was just amazing and really great.
1713;I think everyone should experience this great movie
1714;Tim Burton's latest effort, Sleepy Hollow, is a delight with one exception.
1715;He is one of my favorite directors, and here are some of his most wonderful creations: PeeWee's Big Adventure, Edward Scissorhands, The Nightmare Before Christmas, Batman and Batman Returns.
1716;what makes Burton a great director is his style, which is unique to him.
1717;The upstate New York village of Burton's Sleepy Hollow is a quaint and almost inviting one.
1718;Still, the sun never shines, and the countryside is anything but inviting.
1719;depp, the great physical actor of our times, leads a cast of wonderful performers.
1720;Every role is memorable, especially his and Miranda Richardson's.
1721;He he can make even a bad movie watchable, and he can make a good one great.
1722;as in any Burton movie, the sets are fascinating.
1723;This would have opened this otherwise delightful period piece to a broader audience.
1724;He's as unique and stylish as directors get.
1725;He sets the tone for a darkened classic.
1726;Spielberg wants to build suspense before jumping into the big bagje.
1727;He builds up our excitment to see the big effect.
1728;He jumps right on the wagon with the Headless Horseman.
1729;It's interesting when you look at similar directors who start off with the big boom and get the audiences' blood running instead of dragging out this whole process of building their anticipation.
1730;His name is Ichabod Crane, a man who's determined to piece together the logical pieces of the everyday crime saga that lurks his world of work.
1731;Francis Ford Coppola also produces the film.
1732;what is so fun about this movie is that is carries every aspect of film you need.
1733;Whether in the movie you want good visuals, frightening sequences, interesting plot, strong performances, excellent art direction, comedy, action, suspense, drama, horror, and mystery.
1734;When painting a picture that's going to stand out among other bright colored pieces.
1735;this astonishing film is fun and freakily mysterious.
1736;It is toned specifically for a unique ride.
1737;Tim Burton is a master of originality.
1738;Everything works in the film.
1739;Take my word for it: everything is on a roll for this film .
1740;SLEEPY HOLLOW is definetely the perfect film for a fun night.
1741;But I am a Tim Burton fan, as well as Johnny Depp.
1742;So I viewed this film last week and had a ball!
1743;line Heads Will Roll is appropriate.
1744;Which is fine with me.
1745;Mr. Depp's performance is very good.
1746;as far as the decapitations go, I found them lots of fun.
1747;mr. Burton's usual attention to set design and overall mood is meticulous.
1748;I like the fact that this film is photographed on sets.
1749;It shows you how much a medium.
1750;perspective were utilized to make it look bigger.
1751;Very interesting!I loved SLEEPY HOLLOW.
1752;Typical of a Burton film Sleepy Hollow is richly atmospheric.
1753;What is potentially a dark and gloomy tale is made lively through Depp's delightful and off.
1754;Much of the movie serves as an homage to the classic horror genre.
1755;The artistic expression of Burton and Depp truly complement each other well as can be seen in Edward Scissorhands, and now in Sleepy Hollow.
1756;This is a classic and if anyone likes Johnny Depp or legends they need to check this out.
1757;The cinematography was amazing and the acting is Oscar worthy!
1758;Depp did it again"
1759;Tim Burton is a great director and has a cast that goes beyond incredible .
1760;Christopher Walken once again plays the best character it the movie.
1761;Not one of the absolute best but definitely one I crave once in awhile.
1762;Sleepy Hollow was a delightful version by Tim Burton.
1763;Johnny Depp is Incabob Crane, and i must say a very funny version of him.
1764;this film is a true burton film, it has his style in it very rich, deep, and intense.
1765;this is really a burton film
1766;I just love movies with Johnny Depp, especially when they're directed by Tim Burton.
1767;This movie has just the right mix of gore and humor to suit anyone's needs.
1768;This is a hilarious movie!
1769;A little bit of blood never hurt anyone, but Mr. Depp once again proves that he is able to make you giggle with just a small change in facial expression.
1770;Burton, eccentric and edgy, has literally filmed a painting.
1771;It's part horror film, part detective story, and all romance!
1772;Depp does a great job as always, Christina Ricci is simply beautiful, and the scenery is enough to make you want to step out of the audience and into the fantasyland full of groping trees, pumpkins, and New England mists.
1773;This is great fun and what good storytelling is all about.
1774;I love watching this movie.
1775;It's the classic match between Johnny Depp and Tim Burton, dark and mesmerizing.
1776;The story is one everyone is familiar with, but Johnny Depp and the other cast bring such reality to their roles.
1777;Definately one I'll be watching again and again for these reasons, and the fabulous acting and sets.
1778;Tim Burton has proven you can take a classic story, give it new twists, and still maintain the flavor of the original.
1779;This is a wonderfully filmed and acted spook and laugh fest!
1780;Johnny Depp is perfect as Ichabod Crane, and the supporting cast is outstanding all the way around.
1781;The British actors, especially Miranda Richardson, Michael Gambon and Richard Griffiths, not to mention horror veteran Michael Gough, are all outstanding and lend the most effective creepiness to this lushly filmed epic.
1782;"The casting of Christopher Walken as the Horsemen was inspired
1783;That's fine, if Burton could come up with a good story to replace it with.
1784;Johnny Depp is sensational in this movie .
1785;Really enjoy this movie, no matter what time of year it is.
1786;Tim Burton is, in my opinion, one of our great visionary filmmakers, and Sleepy Hollow is yet another creative triumph.
1787;Inspired by the classic 19th century story The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, by Washington Irving, this film depicts a United States that is just about to enter the modern age.
1788;Sleepy Hollow works on may levels: as historical costume drama, as mystery.
1789;thriller, as love story, as fantasy, even as satire.
1790;up, special effects, and sumptuous Danny Elfman score blend marvelously to create an atmosphere that is both creepy and romantic.
1791;The filmmakers have assembled an amazing ensemble cast of veteran character actors to support Depp and the luminous Christina Ricci (as Crane's love interest).
1792;I was also impressed by Marc Pickering as Young Masbeth, a brave boy who becomes Crane's right.
1793;depp is excellent in his role, yet another in a series of oddball outsiders and weird prophets which he has played to perfection over the years.
1794;Depp's Crane is eccentric, comic, heroic, and very appealing.
1795;The changes that have been made (most notably, changing Ichabod Crane from a schoolteacher to a police investigator) make sense and are handled deftly by the screenwriters.
1796;integrated into the overall plot and atmosphere.
1797;Having said that, though, Tim Burton's film is a beautifully scary piece of work.
1798;top performance as the neurotic Constable Crane .
1799;eyed Christopher Walken is perfect as the Hessian swordsman with teeth filed to points.
1800;The cinematography is dark and stormy, the trees are gnarled, and Danny Elfman's score is quintessentially spooky.
1801;It's just a fun, exciting film by a director who stands out among his peers with a remarkably individual take on flim.
1802;The sound and picture are beautiful and crystal clear.
1803;There is an interview with cast and crew, as well as a Making Of documentary, and both trailers.
1804;The optional french language track is fun to listen to, but the real treat is the director commentary.
1805;Tim takes great pleasure in ragging good.
1806;naturedly on his own film, and also gives wonderful insight into the process.
1807;He was always amusing, and he reveres his actors very much.
1808;Most Burton fans know that Tim is an actor's director, and that really shows through.
1809;The five town elders could have been boring side characters, but they were brought to colorful realization by superb performers with artfully charismatic faces.
1810;It's a great movie, well worth putting down money for.
1811;And to me, the story this film is based on is a classic.
1812;So I am happy to say, in my eyes, this movie is also a classic.
1813;The music is wonderful, the sets and landscapes are perfectly dark and scary, the stars selected for their parts were selected with a eye towards fitting their characters.
1814;The Headless Horseman is played by a real stunt man, not a computer generated spirit, so much of the fighting is real.
1815;has some good frights, but also some laughs sprinkled around.
1816;still makes a good october/halloween entry to watch.
1817;This will be a classic.
1818;Of course, Johnny Depp is always good.
1819;He did a great job in this show!
1820;This is one of the top movies on my scary movie list.
1821;while not exactly the same as the original story, it's still fun, creepy and very worth watching every halloween season.
1822;This movie is one of my favorites.
1823;movie okay but Johnny Depp always easy on the eyes.
1824;Worth watching nice movie scenery good for Halloween nicely done
1825;Good combo of creepy, using your mind, some action, and sense of reality.
1826;Love the setting and good music choice made for the movie.
1827;Sleepy Hollow was just an amazing film achievement for Tim Burton (the director), I am not saying Tim's a bad director, he is one of my favorite (if not the best).
1828;I loved the gothic sence of the forest, the village, the fact that it was never sunny and bright outside.
1829;Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci both did superb acting jobs in the film.
1830;While its characters are based on the those depicted in Washington Irving's """"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,"""" and the tale takes place in Sleepy Hollow, New York, the story varies greatly from the novel."""
1831;Tim Burton's approach gives a new twist to the tale, and the performances by the leading actors are remarkable.
1832;The added features provide insight to the making of the film.
1833;"Overall I greatly enjoyed the movie and recommend the film to those who enjoy horror with a twist of ""gallows humor,"" Johnny Depp and Tim Burton films."
1834;Well Tim Burton (one of my favorite directors) more than makes up for it with this incredible film.
1835;Loosely based on the Legend of Sleepy Hollow, this film not only has incredible effects and acting, but the twisted vision of the classic as only Burton could see it!
1836;However, Burton does explore the origins of the Headless Horesman, played wonderfully by the disturbed Christopher Walken.
1837;It all takes place in a dark, atmospheric landscape that I thought only able to exsist in Burtons animated films!Again, the always loyal to his friends director employs Depp (edward Scissor Hands,Ed Wood), Christopher Walken (Batman Returns)and a number of actors as the town elders who have appeared breifly in other Burton films.
1838;I did, and was thoroughly engrossed by the picture!
1839;I liked EDWARD SCISSORHANDS and ED WOOD, both Tim Burton films starring Johnny Depp, and I suppose I was expecting something like that from this one.
1840;While it's visually interesting, like most of Burton's movies, and while Depp manages to amuse in a few places, on the whole this seemed like a very by.
1841;Maybe a little more stylish than most, but nowhere near as eclectic and clever as Burton's other films.
1842;How my spine tingled deliciously throughout the film .
1843;In the middle of the mist we hear a horse ride, accelerated rhythm, until the fog dissipates and we see an impressive figure, his presence irradiates pure evil, his arm is ready to take another head.
1844;ish, Sleepy Hollow shows us the vision of this extravagant director about Washington Irving's tale.
1845;the sleek Constable Ichabod Crane puts science above everything.
1846;visually stunning, Sleepy Hollow has some elements from the horror genre.
1847;That the hero is in more danger that the damsel is one of the great twists in this film.
1848;He's funny without being clowny.
1849;alongside him, there's a cast of excellent actors that help recreate Burton's story.
1850;But still, is a movie that achieves to recreate a world of fantasy with great realism, thanks to the skills of those who imagined an 18 century village that it could well be hell's portal.
1851;sleepy Hollow also confirms that Burton continues to ride on the dark side of creativity, hearing his own voices.
1852;real Strong Chemistry between Johnny Deep Christina Ricci.
1853;christopher Walken is Creepy as Usual it works really well here.
1854;All of the performances are great but Johnny Depp gives one of the best of his career as the constable/scientist Icahbod Crane.
1855;Ricci is also convincing as the lovely Katrina Van Tassel.
1856;Some great scares and great action await you in Sleepy Hollow so snuggle up and enjoy the supernatural thrill ride!!
1857;Everyone knows the movie and you're here because you love it, like me.
1858;"i wanted a high def transfer of all the fog and mist that gives it the feel of film because this movie is worth that ""look""."
1859;life terrifying, the suspense is palpable and if you give the movie a chance, the tension and creepiness slowly seeps into your skin, and stays there.
1860;the cast here is outstanding, led by Depp, whom I am enjoying more with every new role I find him in.
1861;His cautious Crane is a far cry from his turn as the flamboyant Jack Sparrow, but Depp is so achingly convincing you forget he ever donned eye.
1862;visually the film is wondrous.
1863;The cinematography is breathtaking, giving a surreal gothic look to the film.
1864;The film is also superbly edited, and the visual effects are just about seamless.
1865;The horseman sequences are well.
1866;This movie is gorgeous to watch if you don't mind a little blood.
1867;The costumes, sets and special effects are amazing.
1868;Gorgeous sets and powerful use of color are in display for Burton's film version of the short story by Washington Irving.
1869;The deer on the posts give the viewer the impression that one is going into a surreal dream.
1870;This is accented by the use of color.
1871;While Crane has been transformed from an ugly school teacher to a rational, yet tainted by magic, constable, he is understandable and sympathetic.
1872;The performances (especially by Miranda Richardson) are very well done.
1873;No, this isn't the scariest version or movie you'll ever see, but the suspense is handled well, and there are a couple of jump scenes.
1874;The transfer is good, with the film much richer, of course, in the 1.85:1 than it ever could be in pan and scan.
1875;There are some notable surprising stars showing up here (Christopher Walken, especially after mentioning the legend in Dead Zone) and overall, a very well done mystery/suspense film.
1876;Sleepy hollow is a great movie.
1877;It is an amazing collaberation of johnny depp and tim burton.
1878;The movie has a great story that keeps you interested the whole film.
1879;love it its awsommmme its truly epic yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay it is the best,ty so much its awsome ty ty ty ty
1880;The mood and plot is right on.
1881;The score is hand in glove .
1882;This is one of the ultimate Halloween movies.
1883;It features spooky sets, one of Danny Elfman's best music scores, enough gore to make Sweeney Todd proud and the visual touches of Tim Burton.
1884;The acting is good all around, with no one standing out from the crowd.
1885;I like Johnny Depp in this, but it's not one of his best performances.
1886;As a whole, Sleepy Hollow is my favorite flick from this director and it has been since I first saw it in theaters back in 1999.
1887;action interpretation of the Disney version of Washington Irving's classic Halloween tale, but if you are a fan of that second half of Disney`s the Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad, you will definitely notice the similarities!
1888;There's no doubt that Christina Ricci's Katrina Van Tassel is nearly every bit as delicious looking as the Disney version, and so many of the visuals, such as the covered bridge scenes, will take you right back to that classic cartoon.
1889;But in this strange little village, everyone makes a good suspect.
1890;I'd have to label this as Burton's best work yet, possibly the best he'll ever do, as it will be very hard to top.
1891;The casting in this film is excellent by the way!
1892;Johnny Depp is a surprisingly good Ichabod, Christina Ricci is perfect as Katrina, Casper Van Dien is an equally excellent choice as Brom, Marc Pickering was very likeable as Young Masbath, and the film is full of other wonderful actors such as Christopher Lee, Martin Landau, Jeffrey Jones, and none other than Christopher Walken as the headless horseman!
1893;A must own for lovers of great films and visual masterpieces!
1894;so this is a fairy tale that plays out like a real movie, it's kind of hard to explain, but this movie does have agood realism about it.
1895;that is really all you need to know, not every scene is a classic, but the action scenes are wonderful.
1896;So the kids like 9 and over will probably be ok with this.
1897;i love pretty much about this movie, except for a few scenes that I thought could have been better.
1898;But the music was the best part for me.
1899;It was so loud and strong, it exacted what the atmosphere looked like.
1900;I don't know who scored it but he did an awesome job.
1901;^_^ i was really happy when i saw the entry in the book for the pentacle katrina had been drawing.
1902;but this is an incredible movie and i'm actually watching it on tv now (while flipping back and forth between that and 'congo'.)
1903;i highly recccomend this movie!
1904;this film is sheer brilliance, Johnny Depp gives a Oscar worthy performances, Christina Ricci is sexily mysterious and Tim Burton gives his best directing effort yet.
1905;Sleepy Hollow is one of my favourite movies, it is a faultless, scary and beautiful movie that no.
1906;Even if you're not a huge Johnny Depp fan (believe me I'm not either), you will appreciate his dedication to every aspect of his character in this film.
1907;I'll let you discover the engrossing American horror tale of the Headless Horseman for yourself.
1908;Phenomenal set and costume design, a fantastic musical score, and even some timely humor round out a great story.
1909;A rousing, accurate, entertaining, horror story that shouldn't be overlooked.
1910;Really scary and sometimes really funny.
1911;These words basically summarize this wonderful adaption of Washington Irving's classic tale.
1912;Maby plot twists and great acting make this a great movie.
1913;In cartoons and other movies, the headless horseman is often associated with a jack.
1914;There is a scene where we see the horseman carry a jack.
1915;Speaking of Johnny Depp, he is great in this movie.
1916;He is very funny in some of the scenes he's in (e. g. everytime he inspects a dead body, blood would splatter on his face, etc.).
1917;this movie is filled with great acting, and great special effects!
1918;Tim Burton did a good job of getting Washington Irving's masterpiece into the big screen.
1919;This is one of the great movies where the film makers followed the novel as close as they can without changing it.
1920;In addition to Bram Stoker's Dracula, and Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (both great movies), this is one I strongly recommend!
1921;I don't know how many films they have made together, but everyone I have seen is memorable.
1922;suitable for today's 10.11 year old that likes to be scared.
1923;Sleepy Hollow is one of the best movies of *99The acting is Great{Christina Ricci's is the best.}
1924;This movie is awesome, nice and dark the way it should be made.
1925;First of all Sleepy Hollow is a visual masterpiece.
1926;It should have won the oscar for cinematogrophy, because there are times when you want to touch the screen to see if the paint has dried.
1927;The film sustains this menace for about half its length, drenched in mystery, voilence and a wonderful human centre in Johnny Depp as Icabod Crane.
1928;Yet he is funny and likable, and provides a good counterpoint to the gory goings on.
1929;He always operates on some level of parody, with tongue in cheek.
1930;Surely a film with such terrefic visuals and performances deserves a better script than this.
1931;filled the promise of those gorgous looking sets.
1932;The best Tim Burton film is still easily ED WOOD, where the material is more suitable to his ironic tone.
1933;looks brilliant sounds superb,very good ensemble acting performances, particularly the faint(sic) Mr Crane!
1934;he delivers a great performance.
1935;christopher Walken also nailed the horseman a star studded cast with a great story
1936;Depp played the character well, I just didnt like the character!
1937;The rest of the cast was OK but noone jumped out as special or well.
1938;A great hommage to the old Hammer Horror, a modern Classic in an old tradition.
1939;I love Johnny Depp's acting, and he is very entertaining in this movie, you have humor, drama, horror, and a love story all in one movie, great entertainment.
1940;A brilliant masterpiece rebuilt again by Master of arts Tim Burton.
1941;Great costumes, great scenery and great decapitations.
1942;The atmosphere in the movie makes you suspect everything and everyone in the movie.
1943;All in All : A must see for everyone who is fond of some good old horror movies.
1944;Probably Tim Burton's best masterpiece ever since Edward Scissorhands!
1945;Great storyline and plot makes this a one hell.
1946;Not forgetting Danny Elfman, his score is always, without a doubt, sweeping with emotions.
1947;"I loved ""Edward Scissorhands"", ""Beetlejuice"", and ""Ed Wood"", and always looked forward to what came next."
1948;I caught up to one of those recently though, and I'm happy to say that my fears were not (mostly) justified.
1949;As the film develops, Ichabod believes there's a perfectly rational explanation for the murders, and it's to the film's credit and Depp's that as he gradually learns that in fact there is a fantastic, mystical presence behind them (Christopher Walken as the silent but deadly Headless Horseman), he continues to probe the secrets, never entirely giving up his rational belief system but also finding the ability to accept some of the religious/magical possibilities behind the horseman .
1950;it's all quite beautifully shot, excellently acted with perhaps the exception of Ricci (one of those actors I can never really accept in period roles), who isn't really bad, and it's a wonderful mixture of comedy, scares and thrills, and a bit of the mystic.
1951;"Oh well
1952;Really, loads and loads of fun and probably my 2nd.
1953;favorite Burton film at the moment after """"Ed Wood""""."""
1954;Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci compliment each other beautifully on the screen, and I think that Tim Burton does a brilliant portrayal of the headless horseman and Ichabod Crane.
1955;But I was really hoping for more of Christopher Walken in this movie as he is one of my favorite actors.
1956;But other than that I think that this was a great movie and unlike a lot of horror movies this is one that you can watch again and again.
1957;Theres lots of spooky scenes and it is scary, but not over the top.
1958;A classic children's tale masterfully turned into an edge of your seat thriller .
1959;Tim Burton has done it again!
1960;I loved every moment of this movie, from the queer and melancholy town of Sleepy Hollow, to the background music that seems to just jump at you at all the right moments, to the never.
1961;Though those of you with a weak stomach may want to fast forward some parts because Burton doesn't leave anything out, please note that!
1962;Well, I won't ruin the movie for you but will tell you that Depp and Ricci light up the screen.
1963;who seems to be a perfect person for these sorts of movies .
1964;You should be very pleased!
1965;The actors are excelent, it's scary and it's got a good love story.
1966;If you haven't seen this yet I strongly recommend you do, it's great!
1967;johnny takes on the role like the pro he is.
1968;It is a great movie for anyones collection.
1969;I LOOOOOVEEE this movie, i always loved the story of The Legend of Sleepy Hollow in all its formats, from the made.
1970;classic of the story, this has always been one of my favorite scary halloween tales.
1971;this movie has two things that makes it absolutly spectacular to experience: GREAT style and GREAT music score.
1972;his music is so emotional, so SCARY and DARK.
1973;gives you goosebumps, and it stays with you.
1974;this is a very suspenseful, atmospheric horror movie that has such great set designs, great acting, VERY atmospheric (lots of fog, hardly any sunlight, lots of dead trees and everything very dark), this movie has it all for a big horror fan and while it does have some gross moments (personally, i think they are scary as hell), it really is done so well that it grabs you and doesnt let go.
1975;the first scene in the movie makes hooks you in and it takes you on a real scary ride!
1976;if your a Tim Burton fan, this is a must see.
1977;i thought i'd never be able to watch it again, but now i find myself watching this great horror flick on a monthly basis!
1978;one dumb actress doesnt make this movie any more worse, johnny depp is funny and very cool and he gives alot of humour and great acting to the story.
1979;i still give it 5 stars, great movie.
1980;With his usual sense of visuals, Burton tells the story of the haunted town of Sleepy Hollow with great expertise and lots of subtle humour.
1981;Christina Ricci is wonderful as always, and I enjoyed all the near.
1982;The man carries the whole movie on his shoulders in his absolutely outstanding performance as the insecure and yet brilliant constable Ichabod Crane.
1983;Depp displays countless subtle facial expressions that really makes his character come to life.
1984;And everything else, from his voice to the way he moves is beyond words.
1985;One of the best performances I've ever seen!
1986;Sleepy Hollow might not be his greatest movie yet, but it's certainly the funniest.
1987;And Johnny Depp is still developing his talent.
1988;A refreshing interpretation of the Sleepy Hollow legend.
1989;Featuring humor, good special effects, and a great feel for the period portrayed.
1990;I was actually very pleased with this movie, it had a little bit of everything for everyone.
1991;All the characters are perfect and near the end you dont know who to blame for the murders.
1992;All in all this movie was very well done and i would definatley recconmend it for anyone.
1993;Breathtaking cinematography provides just the right atmosphere for a halloween.
1994;the plot deviates from the Washington masterpiece a bit, while the characters diverge some way from their eighteenth.
1995;Nonetheless, this has all the ingredients that made the original great .
1996;All this combines to make it more faithful to the original than a first glance would imply and at the same time a masterpiece in its own right.
1997;i was held rapt by this movie, and I will break the door down to get the video when it is released.
1998;This movie was a wonderful thriller.
1999;It had an amazing cast of actors and actressess in it.
2000;The acting was superb, the makeup and costumes were gorgeous, and the special effects were great.
2001;This is the movie that introduced me to Tim Burton`s phenomenal gift of creating visually stunning films.
2002;I`ve always loved the story of Sleepy Hollow and saw it as an incredible movie just waiting to happen.
2003;This entire film looks GREAT, not to mention it has wonderful performances (expecially Johnny Depp, whose role as the nervous wreck Ichabod Crane is worth the entire price of the movie and then some) and some of the best music Danny Elfman has ever composed for a movie.
2004;"I guess those people just aren`t Tim Burton people
2005;So if you`ve seen some other Burton movies and liked them, definitely check this one out.
2006;Tim Burton and Johnny Depp are truly a match made in cinematic heaven.
2007;Depp's comic take on Ichabod Crane is authentic and inspired, he has become a delight to see in nearly everything he does, Depp holds an onscreen sense of magic that is rarely ever seen.
2008;Tim Burton is also one of my favorite directors.
2009;He almost always tackles very unique and interesting visions unlike the normal crop of directors, he breathes a new life into his films, a breath that surely wouldn't have existed in lesser hands.
2010;The originality and daring of Burton and Depp really makes this film and their others gems.
2011;I applaud one of filmdom's great film pairings, Burton and Depp.
2012;For me everything works and looks brilliant on this film.
2013;Great script, wonderful performance by Depp and a surprising choice with Ricci and, even more surprising, she truely delivers.
2014;Most important, Burton nails this whimsical gothic tale and, in my humble opinion, created a film classic.
2015;Depp and Ricci shine in this unusual take on Irving's classic tale.
2016;It is certainly more interesting.
2017;Tim Burton has made some great films in the past 25 years.
2018;Movies like Beetlejuice, Batman, Batman returns, Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood, Sleepy hollow, and Pee.
2019;wee's Big Adventure helped establish him as an A. list director with a trademark vision.
2020;His films are characterized by a unique creative vision.
2021;telling of the classic American short.
2022;story written by Washington Irving.
2023;Together with a small orphan and a love interest played by Christina Ricci, Ichabod faces an adventure chock full of lives lost and secrets revealed.
2024;johnny Depp is incredible in this film, portaying the character of Ichabod Crane with genuine realness and outstanding authenticity.
2025;This behavior causes Ichabod to faint several times in the film, leading to many comical moments, such as a particularly funny scene in the bedroom.
2026;Ichabod continues Tim Burton's tradition of having the main character in his films be a misunderstood outcast from society.
2027;the spectacular visual appeal of this film is more than enough to dictate atleast one viewing.
2028;Tim Burrton's unique vision produces a dark and atmospheric environment in the film, perfectly representing the dark mood of the plot.
2029;The environment is so important to the movie that Burton demanded that the entire town and forrest be built onto a soundstage, so he could control every aspect of the environment.
2030;all the extra effort was definently worth while, because Sleepy Hollow is a very beautiful movie, and the best representation of Burton's unique vision since Edward Scissorhands.
2031;another great aspect of the film are the great costumes and character designs.
2032;The characters wear authentic clothing from the era, with everybody wearing a very interesting wardrobe.
2033;The most interesting character design is the headless horseman.
2034;His design is just so cool, and the fact that he's played by Christopher Walken makes him even cooler.
2035;overall, Sleepy Hollow is a great, atmospheric film with interesting characters and an engaging plot.
2036;This isn't my favorite Burton film, but it's definently one of his best.
2037;Sleepy Hollow is a beautiful, beautiful horror film.
2038;It is a pretty good horror film except for the various points of comic relief that plague the movie.
2039;Director Tim Burton has created the ultimate halloween type atmosphere.
2040;although cheesy at times, this is an very good film with a strong story and EXCEPTIONAL art direction.
2041;This is where director Tim Burton shines once again.
2042;Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow is a good film with great special effects and visuals, along with another terrific score by Danny Elfman.
2043;convincing, out of this world characters.
2044;Burton's films are always hit.
2045;On a positive note, the film does have surprising scenes of humor, and on an even bigger upside, the beheadings in the film are more humorous than gory and violent.
2046;That part that is gory is the aftermath, and you'll know what I mean.
2047;Christina Ricci was good in this movie, both in her looks and performance.
2048;a visual work of art with a good story.
2049;It's a Tim Burton film so it's very stylized.
2050;The story itself expands wildly upon the original Washington Irving tale, departing from it totally at some points.
2051;It's a pretty good, intelligent yarn and, although the visuals tend to dominate, strong enough to make the film more than just pretty pictures .
2052;The use of visuals that both horrify and attract supports the story and its themes well.
2053;This is a great movie.
2054;It is suspenseful and has a great plot.
2055;On a final note, I believe Johnny Depp's original trademark is when he yells and faint (smile).
2056;And he does it so well in this film and others (i. e.
2057;All in all, he really works hard @ his craft and it is evident in this movie.
2058;Johnny Depp before his second coming during the 2000s showing us what he is capable of when pushed to perform at the top of his game.
2059;The story is well known but the execution and depth of the characters, the costumes, and the Visual Effects make this an enjoyable experience.
2060;I would recommend this movie to any Tim Burton or Johnny Depp fan.
2061;Hard to deny a film with Tim Burton because if you love his work, you love the casts he employs.
2062;This is a classic Tim Burton film.
2063;This is one of Tim Burton's best"
2064;This has secured Burton as my favorite director.
2065;Itwas freaky, humorous, and gory.
2066;The horseman is now the best character ever seen in a movie.
2067;Johnny, Chris Walken, and Rick Heinrich's production design are all excellent.
2068;This is definetely the best looking movie ever made!
2069;Danny Elfman also deserves credit for creating one of the best scores EVER.
2070;His twisted musical tour de force matches perfectly with Burton's vision.
2071;THEN, I see a unique and awesome cast made up of Christina Ricci, Casper Van Dien, Christopher Walken AND Christopher Lee in the movie?!?!
2072;Exceptional scenery, acting and atmosphere, this is as good as it gets when it comes to modern day horror movies, (eventhough it was set in the late 1700's).
2073;One of Johhny Depp's best performances and a one of a kind horror movie.
2074;Definitely worth the price of admission and worth watching more than once.
2075;Tim Burton's adaptation of the Irving classic is one of the most stylish and best.
2076;outs, and the Horseman continues to add to the body count.
2077;I haven't seen much to compare with this outstanding film, in any movie genre, for ages.
2078;"The Hound of the Baskervilles, (the magnificent cinematography version), then you will clearly love ""Sleepy Hollow."
2079;THE STORY: This yarn springboards from Washington Irving's compelling tale of terror, the companion work toRip Van Winklefrom this Classic American author's famousThe Sketch Book.
2080;this is a terrifying mystery thriller of the First Water, directed by Tim Burton.
2081;The screenwriting (Kevin Yagher) is incredibly compelling, the cinematography is magnificent, the locations (mostly in England) are magical, the filmscore compositions (Danny Elfman) are faultlessly appropriate, and the acting is superb.
2082;Johnny Depp as Ichabod (at least for the purpose of this particular film version) amounted to flawless casting.
2083;I was also very pleased to see the great Christopher Lee (The Lord of the Rings .
2084;but there is never any drag and the action is both tasteful (for the genre) and non.
2085;The aspect ratio is 1.85:1, a presentation of enhanced widescreen (16:9).
2086;winning 1999 film is one that you won't want to pass by.
2087;The film is rated R due to one mild and brief sexual scene as well as for the violence and the gore of the numerous heads which bounce wide.
2088;This is definitly the most stunning movie ever to hit the silver screen.
2089;well you get my drift.
2090;Well I thought this was going to be some hooror fest but it is the best movie ever.
2091;Tim Burton is a genius, Johnny Depp is gorgeous and talented as ever.
2092;While a good movie it is a remake of the previous movie and is just the same as the older version
2093;and the cast is superb!Johnny Depp delivers one of his most offbeat performances.
2094;the image here is top notch.
2095;Crystal clear, high definition picture as you've never seen .
2096;which is interesting: since the film has a dark cinematography you'll be amazed how well the High Def takes advantage of all it can do to give you a kind of image you'll think you only get in a movie theatre.
2097;in fact, to see the forest with all the fog and those trees in gorgeous high definition is a trully cinematic experience.
2098;And I do believe this is one of those movies who beg for high definition .
2099;excellent directing by the ever creepy tim burton.
2100;johnny depp is magnificent as is christina ricci.
2101;christopher walken makes the perfect headless horseman.
2102;great great great movie an absolute must see.
2103;especially for those who are expecting it to be just another movie about ichabod crane and the headless horseman like i was.you will be pleasantly surprised.
2104;For example, he starts off very confident in the opening scene and seems to be brave, but for the rest of the movie it's as if he's someone else.
2105;The only thing that saves this one from getting one star is that visually it's very good.
2106;This is classic style over substance as in most of Burton's films.
2107;There are fantastic sets and Burton's trademark style of imagery make it very watchable.
2108;Tim Burton must pick movies based on the potential for visually exciting sets than for the story or script.
2109;There were some unintentially funny moments too.
2110;It was worth a look anyway.
2111;'Sleepy Hollow' holds a special place in my heart as being the first R. rated film I saw (I was 11 or 12 at the time).
2112;Looking back on it almost a decade later it's not as effective as I remembered it to be but it's still a nice blend of Gothic horror and humor.
2113;the film is a very loose adaptation of Washington Irving's original story but I feel that it holds true to the spirit of it.
2114;storywise, I have to give credit to the screenwriter for actually trying to make an intelligent film as opposed to a period piece slasher.
2115;the real star of the film is Tim Burton's directorial style.
2116;"The film is drenched in style and gives it a real sense of atmosphere
2117;There's some interesting behind the scenes stuff here (a bit surprising how much work went into making the Headless Horseman, well, headless).
2118;'Sleepy Hollow' is a fun film to watch during the Halloween season.
2119;It's not a classic by any means but it's definitely worth checking out.
2120;Combine Johnny Depp with Tim Burton and you can generally count on good entertainment.
2121;Holds true for this flick also.
2122;some interesting camera work and a good bit of action.
2123;Good little let's watch that again flick.
2124;This movie is every bit a Tim Burton's movie with its haunting atmospheric setting.
2125;romance movie but it's also a black comedy as well.
2126;Johnny Depp is comfortable as the role of the male lead, an eccentric detective cop from the Big Apple.
2127;He is hillariously funny at times has proven his versatility in playing other roles in Donnie Brasco, or even Astronaut's Wife.
2128;Christina Ricci is definitely coming of age is convincing in her role as this voluptuous but intelligent female lead.
2129;She seems to have gone from strength to strength since her heyday in Addams Family.
2130;Christopher Walken is great as the headless horse rider.
2131;If you are a Tim Burton's fan, you would definitely enjoy the movie.
2132;Our family watches this movie every Halloween and love it!
2133;Johnny Depp is an amazing actor!!
2134;The movie is even better on Blu.
2135;From the costumes to the scenery, just a very eye pleasing beautiful movie.
2136;I will always like this movie cause I watch a lot of movies to entertain me and keeps me out of bars."
2137;Funny, a little scarey and just plain entertaining.
2138;I chose it not just because I love Johnny depp but because it was really good.
2139;the settings were brilliant .
2140;It's a real 'wine, candles, choccies and curl up on the sofa' type film.
2141;every scene has a dark cloudy look which just adds to the excitement .
2142;and a good story on which this film has been based upon .
2143;the secret is revealed in a matter of fact way .
2144;but overall a fine movie with good performances by johnny depp the boy .
2145;I like this movie during halloween.
2146;It's a dark movie and I like that it feels sort of gothic.
2147;Here it comes to life with a brilliant twisted director Tim Burton, (Beetlejuice, Edward Scissor Hands, Nightmare Before Christmas) as he puts his own dark but beautiful style into this art.
2148;Scenery is very beautiful and realisitic, along with the brilliant acting performances from Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, Christopher Walken, Miranda Richardson and more.
2149;This is definitely the best Tim Burton movie to date.
2150;Breathtaking special effects and acting make this movie a gem for all movie collectors!!!
2151;Tim finally found a classic story that matches his style.
2152;Johnny Depp is great as Ichabod Crane, and Christina Ricci proves she is ready to play more grown.
2153;Yes it is gory, yes it is moody, but that is the best way to make a movie about The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.
2154;Great story and just love Johnny Depp, he plays a good Icabod Crane, love this movie
2155;It's perfectly done for the dark and dreary world of Sleepy Hollow and Johnny Depp did a great job.
2156;While this film is slightly darker than most others I watch it was very enjoyable.
2157;While this film was a bit too much for me as it has a fair amount of bloody scenes, I still enjoyed it.
2158;I would recommend this film, but also caution it at the same time.
2159;This is one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen.
2160;Thereis also a great soundtrack, fabulous cast and everyone performs justfine.
2161;But I wonder if the fans of this film honestly cared about the villain's plot revelations at the end.
2162;It's pretty, atmospheric has nice music and some excellent gore action.
2163;And that's about all it has.
2164;Decide for yourself if narrative is important.
2165;I would rate this alongside Deep Blue Sea or Godzilla, both of which I have in my collection and both of which are fun/shallow diversions.
2166;I guess Tim Burton has succeeded too, in creating an extremely beautiful distraction.
2167;It is a slick, visually splendid, highly stylised work of art with a forgettable plot thrown in at the end.
2168;I might have enjoyed it more.
2169;Impeccably designed by Rick Heinrichs, and with striking costumes by Colleen Atwood, this visually arresting film is lit by Emmanuel Lubezki in a stylised, desaturated colour scheme which borders on monochrome and fuels the spookiness of its milieu.
2170;Ichabod is assisted in his detective work by Young Masbeth (amazing Marc Pickering), who plays quiet Watson to Ichabod's pompous Holmes.
2171;It's atmosphere is mesmerizing, but little else is.
2172;I love Tim Burton's films, which is all the more reason this broke my heart.
2173;Through my childhood I loved this dark fable, and I could think of no better person to make a film of it then Tim Burton.
2174;every moment advances the storytelling.
2175;Compares favorably to Bram Stoker's Dracula in that both artfully blend gothic horror with a certain lightness of mood and humor that keep the viewer absorbed at all times.
2176;Design, cinematography, effects, audio .
2177;Making of documentary greatly enhances enjoyment.
2178;Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow is an eerie version of the Washington Irving short story that goes beyond the initial narrative.
2179;the film itself is amazing.
2180;Burton adds a gothic dimension to Irving's tale and captures the gothic aspect of the story with a dark, foggy, and gory exhibition that is displayed with the characters, costumes and props in the film.
2181;The cinematography is exceptional as well as Burton's teaming with Danny Elfman for the film's score.
2182;He discovers a most gruesome discovery as he digs deep within the tree, which will make you leap out of your pants.
2183;Nevertheless, Burton captures the Halloween spirit with much precision.
2184;But it was a fun movie to watch, and was well acted.
2185;The suspense was great, and I kept on guessing until the end who the true villian was.
2186;I was pleased by the plot being so convincing.
2187;Overall, definitely a movie to see, it will make the hairs on your back stand up if you watch it online or at night in the woods like I did.
2188;In my opinion, Johnny Depp is perfect for this movie.
2189;Tim Burton's masterful artwork is shown to the maxium in this beautiful film.
2190;Based on the famous, yet humorous tale, The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, by Washington Irving, this movie takes that folk tale to a whole new level of suspence and mystery.
2191;this movie is fantasic and I whole.
2192;This film is one of the best I've seen in a real long while.
2193;sleepy Hollow is a great movie.
2194;good job Tim Burton, Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci.
2195;Any film with Christopher Walken will be a classic.
2196;The faces are so grainy it makes it tough to watch.
2197;Back to the drawing board guys !
2198;And so, equipped with the latest and most sophisticated wherewithal science has to offer (many instruments of which are of his own design), Constable Crane begins his investigation.
2199;Working from a terrific screenplay by Kevin Yagher (adapted from the story by Washington Irving), Burton makes use of magnificent sets and the talents of an exemplary cast to bring his tale to life.
2200;"He creates an atmosphere of darkness and foreboding that permeates the drama and captures that same sense of menace and disquietude evoked by the classic horror films of the `30's and `40's, such as ""Frankenstein,"" ""Dracula,"" ""The Wolf Man,"" and the like, and infuses it with some rather graphic, yet stylishly presented and realistic decapitations and various other bloodlettings, all enhanced and delivered with cutting."
2201;All of which, for the fan of true gothic horror, becomes a bona fide cauldron of unspeakable delights.
2202;"fest"" by any stretch of the imagination
2203;It's a matter of integrity.
2204;Depp gives an exceptional performance as Crane, affecting a style reminiscent of Colin Clive in the original """"Frankenstein,"""" or Basil Rathbone in """"Son Of Frankenstein,"""" which fits so nicely with all that Burton is attempting (successfully) to do with this film."""
2205;"As he did before with such films as ""Edward Scissorhands"" and ""The Nightmare Before Christmas,"" Tim Burton, with ""Sleepy Hollow,"" has given us yet another entertaining and exciting film that veritably carves out a singular niche for itself in the genre of the unique."
2206;To be sure, a perfectly precise book.
2207;as much as possible painting on film what Irving paints with words and prose, while maintaining the original story's literary integrity.
2208;to me, the appeal in Irving's story is that he is able to capture the mood, humour, excitement, and even horror of the Headless Horsemen through a technique of building suspence and implying terror .
2209;making us work for it, making us use our imagination .
2210;as opposed to offering it up on a platter for us to merely gawk at the incessant computer generated spectacle.
2211;I was yearning to see something with high emphasis on historical and technical accuracy .
2212;"For me, the most enjoyable of the thrilling/scary type movies, be they period pieces or set in the present day, are the ones that come so close to 'reality' that you think, ""hey, this could almost really happen""."
2213;For me, that's when it gets you.
2214;That's why Irving's story works so well .
2215;serious, humourous, touching, and scary (i. e., beleivable).
2216;"And I fear now that since Burton is a pretty big Hollywood name, no one is going to take this story on and do it justice
2217;do James Finimore Coopers """"Last of the Mohican's"""" for instance, after Mann has done it?"""
2218;That's okay in this case though, because that movie was great.
2219;If you're just looking to watch a Johnny Depp movie and don't really care whether it's made up or supposedly based on something then this movie is fine to watch.
2220;It's more about Ichabod's intrest in winning the heart of the young Katrina as much out of greed for inheirting her father's fortune (Baltus van Tassel was, after all, a wealthy farmer) as his actual genuine intrest in her.
2221;And as much as it was a bit of a love story it was also a ghost story.
2222;Disney's animated classic is much closer to Irving's story than this.
2223;If you don't care about it, then this movie may appeal to you.
2224;A great movie, the dark film sequences create a fantastic mode for this film and plays along wonderfully with Johnny Deps recreation of Ichabod Crane.
2225;Johnny Deps out side the box acting really makes this character very believable which plays along wonderfully with the whole cast.
2226;A great movie that will leave you on the seat of your pants, nail biting thought the entire film!
2227;And the added bonus of Christopher Walken cast has the Headless Horsemen , completes this fantastically made film.
2228;A must see for the Halloween season!
2229;This film starts off well purely due to the fact that the acting is hilarious (I suspect intentionally).
2230;I was genuinely surprised at the end when I realised that the janitor actually didn't do it.
2231;Christopher Watkins was great too.
2232;He also was very cute.
2233;A director/actor combination to challange Spielburg/drafus.
2234;Sleepy hollow is magnificent and it isnt because of the story or the special effects (which are both strong) its all about the atmosphere, again Burton is Artistic and passionate and it really comes across.
2235;An American story told in a cult style, very dark and very mythical.
2236;The sword fight at the bridge is one of the best ever.
2237;Elfmans score is brilliantly Burton and Ricci is back to her old self.
2238;Depp is a supurb (as usual) because his insane view of life is natural in this 'world'.
2239;This is one of my best discs.
2240;Some scenes are obviously sets but you dont care because it fits, and it fits because it is Burton.
2241;Of course, a Burton/Depp combination is almost guaranteed to be enjoyable.
2242;It has some head turning moments, but still manages to maintain the lightheartedness of Edward Scissorhands and the bubblyness that Johnny Depp is best known for.
2243;Christina Ricci comes out of her Casper shell and does a great job playing royalty.
2244;i gotta say, Johnny Depp is an amazing actor.
2245;He's one of the very few actors in today's world that can fit into literally any role.
2246;top of Tim Burton's movies.
2247;I have always liked this movie and I am glad that I found it.
2248;I love Tim Burton's work, but THIS one.
2249;despite the visual beauty, impressive special effects, and a campy Depp performance, fell by the wayside.
2250;If you can wade through Icabod's dreams about his mom, it is really a very good movie.
2251;A good mix of Police Files meets Night Gallery (sorry you young ones can't relate).
2252;I found this film extremely good.
2253;Johnny Depp played a very good Icabod Crane.
2254;And, though he's uncredited (at least, until the end credits, that I noticed), I love Christopher Walken.
2255;personal: they found the single ugliest child in the human race to play Ichabod as a kid.
2256;sure, there's good stuff to be said.
2257;"Walken, Walken, Walken, Johnny Depp, a fine cameo by Christopher Lee (with two minutes of screen time, one wonders why he's in the opening credits), Van Dien, and for that matter most of the villagers
2258;Sleepy Hollow could be called the best film by Tim Burton, it shows him moving up in the world from the Batman, Mars Attacks!
2259;stuff which was good, but this is better.
2260;Sleepy Hollow is visually hypnotic and frighteningly fun.
2261;It works best as an art film, filled with so much richness in set design, costume design and cinematography.
2262;Burton takes us into his own little world here, and it's a great experience.
2263;The screenplay by Andrew Kevin Walker (Seven, 8MM) is in the tradition of great storytelling, filled with entertaining characters and ridiculous situations of gothic fantasy that never keep us from being entertained or from having a good time.
2264;It's great, visual storytelling that at some points has the feeling of classic cinema.
2265;Sleepy Hollow is a rich, dazzling work of the imagination.
2266;A great blend of creativity with storytelling.
2267;Burton's true masterpiece in atmosphere and art.
2268;Nothing beats a good old classic movei with some good acting and great one punch lines.
2269;Over all i am very happy with what i got
2270;Burton is okay in that mild gothic humor he likes to do, but this quasi.
2271;If excessive gore and gray skies can keep your attention for any length of time, you may enjoy this.
2272;While in the original Icobod, is a kind of local twit of a teacher .
2273;that being said, Depp creates a very good character: a bit of a dork, but courageous in overcoming his fear.
2274;THe atmosphere is as vivid and dense as one would expect from Burton, with excellent actors adding to it.
2275;Everything you will see in it was created or put together for the movie.
2276;Even the forest was designed and put together inside a studio for the movie.
2277;the music is intense and sometimes almost romantic.
2278;The movie is scary but funny, bloody but romantic, dense and intense but beautiful.
2279;It will keep you on your toes and Johnny Depp pulls off playing the part of Constable Crane well.
2280;My wife loves this movie and never sees it on network television.
2281;It was a gift for her for Christmas.
2282;She can watch it anytime she wants now.
2283;ray holds such promise, and this disc fails to deliver on it.
2284;do this and do it right unless you just must have it.
2285;i have seen some good movies in my time by Tim Burton.
2286;sleepy Hollow was not only good, but it had some real nice acting actors in it.
2287;, it was so good.
2288;The darkness of a Tim Burton movie always appeals to me.
2289;As for Johnny Depp well, he fits sad and questioning characters and I like to see him work with Christopher Walken and in Tim Burton movies, it just fits.
2290;This is truly scary, completely replacing the original story with a serial killer.
2291;The acting is marvelous and the story fascinating.
2292;Johnny Depp is great as the Scientific detective.
2293;The Good: Great sets Costumes.
2294;Fairly inventive plot (Ichabod isn't a schoolteacher, he's a NY cop) and respectable acting.
2295;The Great: A cameo from the great Christopher Lee.
2296;Summery: A good attempt at resurrecting the films we all loved to watch on Saturday night.
2297;This movie had all the ingredients: great cinematography,amazing special effects,and plot twists.
2298;burton's best movie since Batman!
2299;He also comes across as something of a vampire.
2300;Other than this I found it to be a good, period horror flick.
2301;Even Depp, who comes across often as creepy and somewhat gay, was rather cute with his stylized acting.
2302;I give it 4 stars instead of five because of the odd Hessian look.
2303;Excellent portrayal of colonial America and the story we all loved as children.
2304;Johnny Depp is good as an overconfident criminalist who is frequently forced to retreat.
2305;That is, until he witnesses a sample of the Horseman's handiwork himself!
2306;What follows is a delightful blend of elements, with the film alternately a horror, fantasy, whodunit, romance and suspense.
2307;Tim Burton's intensely stylish (as always) direction takes off with Danny Elfman's brilliant (as always) score, uncanny visual effects, superb period detail, and scrumptious art direction, evoking the haunting and surreal atmosphere of Sleepy Hollow and the surrounding forest.
2308;The scenes in which the Headless Horseman applies his trade are really fun, and while graphic, hardly gory, and done with a sense of wit and dark humor.
2309;Depp's idosyncratic portrayal of Ichabod Crane is perfectly complemented by the child.
2310;like beauty of Christina Ricci, and her delicate performance as Katrina Van Tassel.
2311;This movie is special because it has horror and humor, all mixed up with Tim Burton's great vision and concept art.
2312;one of the most provoking movies I have seen.
2313;It opens your mind's eye to wander a bit.
2314;I love it, it have action, adventure ,romantic ,funny I just love Johnny Depp he's great.
2315;Just love the whole atmosphere.
2316;the opening sets the mood for the rest of the movie, a surreal journey of awe and nightmares.
2317;the mystery element of this story is a little muddled, but if you understand it, it is kinda clever.
2318;he gets that spooky place in your heart and mind precisely the way you want it.
2319;liberties are taken with the original legend, this movie surely delivers a rush of spooky delights, and Johnny Depp, in a mannered and winning performances, is delightful.
2320;If you love the Halloween holiday you will enjoy this movie.
2321;it is wonderfully filmed,spooky and unique.
2322;The script was hilarious to some extent, possibly a little predictable, but overall this movie was one of the best movies of 1999.
2323;(Depp's performance, as always was superb).
2324;The beautiful Christina Ricci was perfect (and if you think she was a tad bit young for the part you might want to catch up on your history).
2325;My wife and I really like this movie.
2326;The story is good and the acting is great.
2327;I personally really enjoyed this movie, and found it to be a good rendition of the story.
2328;Once again Tim Burton brings us another gothic fairy tale full of dark corners and mystic characters.
2329;This time around he gives us goth with a touch of class and elegance.
2330;This movie is probably the most scary and edge of your seat Burton film.
2331;It is full of great scares and chills, and it is a wonderful movie to watch on a dark spooky night.
2332;This may have not been Edward Scissorhands, The Nightmare Before Christmas, or even Batman, but it is definately one of Tim Burton's greatest movies.
2333;Ive always been a fan of the occult, and after reading multiple forms of the book by Washington Irving, it became a goal to see the movie.
2334;Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci were positively stunning in this thrill ride of suspense, lust, power, horror, death, and revenge.
2335;It's positively delicious to watch Ichabod (Depp) deduce to the true twisted plot behind the so. called """"innocent"""" step."""
2336;Sleepy Hollow combines terror with just about every human emotion that you could possibly imagine.
2337;We dive into the true intentions and the twists that power can have on the mind, and how revenge can warp a sense of justice.
2338;'Sleepy Hollow' is definately one of the greatest horror movies out there.
2339;Watching the horseman and his faithful black horse emerge from the Tree of the Dead is one of the most incredible scenes in the movie.
2340;Later seeing the old windmill fly up in glowing orange fkames is spectacular.
2341;I highly recommend this movie from the bottom of my Tim Burton.
2342;Burton does an excellent job with this classic american horror tale.
2343;Depp does a great job as the stalwart believer in fact and evidence, and really makes a great Constable Crane.
2344;Any Burton fans wil agree this is a MUST HAVE, and most people can enjoy this twist on a classic american 'myth'.
2345;Very entertaining kept you riveted to your seat.
2346;Tim Burton, as always shows his powerful views through visualization.
2347;The town of Sleepy Hollow alone is enough to give anyone the shivers.
2348;Now Ichabod is a constable instead of a schoolmaster, but he still has the funny little quirks of the original.
2349;Through the new screenplay, the story receives many a new twist.
2350;A whole new subplot joins in involving the possessor of the horseman's head, and a bit of background of the horseman himself (played by a growling and screaming Christopher Walken, who utters not one intelligeable word throughout his short appearances in the film).
2351;The screenwriter gives the movie a bit of a zany feel.
2352;There are quite a few clever lines (Villiany wears many masks, none of which are more dangerous than virtue. )
2353;All in all, this came out to be one of the most entertaining atmospheric, period movies of last year.
2354;Quite a bit of suspension of disbelief is necessary, but due to wonderful art direction mixed with beautiful (though by the book) cinematography, it is not too hard to believe in a town upstate, haunted by the legendary Headless Horseman. . .
2355;Johnny Depp is brilliant and the ensemble cast was perfect in this adaptation of Sleepy Hollow.
2356;It has become a favorite to watch and this movie just doesn't get old.
2357;Stylish, visually excellent, and a total entertainment treat, both aurally and visually.
2358;The amazing thing about this re.
2359;telling of the story, is that although it is an original script, all of the threads of that great story are present in the film.
2360;Which is part of the reason, I feel, that this film works so very well.
2361;so kind of interesting there).
2362;picking, detail orinted, and partially jittery character that seems to be expressed by Roddy, and uses it well in the films course.
2363;eminent Brom, and the mysterious second wife of the Patriarch.
2364;the film is well paced, from the start where the Elder of the Village is attacked, through the introduction of Depp's character, with the all too brief appearance of Christopher Lee, the cast draw out an amazing series of performances.
2365;the unravelling of the threads of deceit and conspiracy make for a well crafted tale.
2366;And Christopher Walken's role as the body and head of the Horseman is truly masterful.
2367;I love Johnny Depp in this movie.
2368;The looks on his face are priceless.
2369;Great story, good suspense, twists and turns.
2370;I really liked this movie!
2371;It had pizazz and also was very funny at times!
2372;It was scary and johnny depp looked really good!
2373;hope you enjoy the movie!
2374;It has a great cast and suprisingly a little humor.
2375;This is not one of my favorite movies, but it is an interesting adaptation of Washington Irving's classic story.
2376;We think that Tim Burton produced the legend of Sleepy Hollow in the best format and the best way anyone could.
2377;This is certainly not a real horror movie, but more a type of gothic thriller with humor to ease the tension.
2378;The effects are very good, except for Johnny Depp being squirted with blood a few too many times, but since it's Depp it's not that annoying.
2379;Sleepy Hollow communicates the mood of a gothic thriller through its cinematography and with the supporting soundtrack very well.
2380;It almost appears to be a black and white movie, but of course it isn't, as some of the important colors emphasize certain situations, and they did a very professional job at it and this comes across very good.
2381;The musical score is also just perfect for this movie and adds a lot to tell the story and to communicate the dark, terrifying mood.
2382;We enjoyed the movie and during this season it's certainly the right movie to watch.
2383;It's been ten years since this cool Johnny Depp film came to play and it's still as fun and as comedic as they come.
2384;the detective mystery aspect is fascinating since I did not see that ending coming.
2385;great flick for a Halloween night.
2386;uncredited appearance by Martin Landau in the beginning of the film, and a short but masterful rendition of a court judge by Christopher Lee.
2387;to add, the photography was the best.
2388;Tim Burton's films, often praised for the intensity of their mood, bring with them a glimpse of the darker side of the human psyche.
2389;jointed, dark, but at their core, always human.
2390;It is his central character that the story seems to evolve around, and it is often seen from that perspective, providing the audience a narrative thread that they can relate to throughout the film.
2391;"filled with rich imagery, lavishly created special effects, and plenty of genuine frights, ""Sleepy Hollow"" promises to bring thrills, chills, and plenty of scares."
2392;Unlike so many horror movies released in the past ten years, Hollow does not rely on gore to create thrills, but instead, (as with most of Burton's work), it uses subtle mood, growing tension and human vulnerability to really bring the story home in a way that is both terrifying and immensely engaging.
2393;While it does have minor flaws which become more noticeable towards the end, overall it is an extremely well.
2394;acted, creepy but darkly funny film.
2395;Although the story is good in it's own right, the Burton film is far more engaging and suspenseful, due to it's multiple plot twists and eerie, gothic atmosphere.
2396;The second best thing are the characters themselves and the dialogue, both of which are incredibly charming and old.
2397;I thoroughly enjoyed Sleepy Hollow, and this film is without a doubt my favorite Tim Burton film!
2398;I love Tim Burton's work, and Sleepy Hollow is no exception.
2399;This film has fantastic effects, yet another atmospheric score by Danny Elfman, and yet another inspired turn by Johnny Depp (I actually think this is one of his finest performances .
2400;his Ichabod Crane is a funny, deft combination of fussiness and phobias, with just a dab of the effeminate.)
2401;That's why I rated this 4 stars .
2402;(And considering that she's naturally wide.
2403;I still enjoy watching this movie for it's creepy story and otherwise excellent cast.
2404;Well, I bought this movie about 7 years ago.
2405;"It definitely has a little twist from Washington Irving's ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow""."
2406;It constantly has me on the edge of my seat.
2407;That about it sums it up, a good, scary, funny movie all in one.
2408;I definitely recommend this, it's fun for everyone to watch, no matter what your age is.
2409;(Johnny Depp is good for those type of movies, by the way, so you should look into more of them)
2410;Tim Burton's work is always lovely to look at and you will not be disappointed in his artistic vision.
2411;I always felt that the original story was good but over rated.
2412;This movie grabs us right from the start.
2413;Making Icobad an officer of the law who defied his superiors and was sent to investigate the murders in Sleepy Hollow supposedly by a headless horseman was a great improvement over the original story.
2414;Burton also skillfully speeds through the events of the original story and tells us in a subtle way that this movie will be much more complex.
2415;Along with Icobad, we are gradually exposed to the reality that the terror from the past has somehow worked its way into the present.
2416;But I will say that we are actually given the option of offering the headless horseman a small amount of our sympathy.
2417;(Shatters the boundaries of all rules!
2418;This movie offers us a wonderful combination of great action, drama, horror, suspense, and even some light comical moments.
2419;But the good points do not stop here!
2420;But just as in Burton's Batman Returns, he offers us dramatic images that carry dignity.
2421;"First you will enjoy trying to solve the mystery and seeing how it unfolds
2422;In this day and age when media seems to have taken a turn for the much worse, it is wonderful to know that a phenomenal masterpiece like this does turn up now and then.
2423;this is definately one of johnny depps best films even thought the blood looks kinda fake like nailpolish its still one of the best films ever
2424;Everybody knows the story of the headless horseman in Mark Twain's story of Sleep Hollow.
2425;Now it comes to life with Johnny Depp and Tim Burton in the picture again.
2426;They are a great team.
2427;my favorite video of the fall, watch it every year and always appreciate this well done movie thriller with johnny
2428;Johnny Depp's is hilarious as the scared hero and the story is dark enough to pass as somewhat horror.
2429;Christina Ricci was excellent too, who happens to be way more brave the Depp's character.
2430;Very entertaining movie, dark humor worked really well
2431;I share the frustration of other reviewers.
2432;Tim Burton is master of creating foreboding moods, using unique visual techniques and telling strange tales occuring in fantastic worlds mostly inspired by his childhood nightmares and dreams.
2433;The result: visually stunning movies with own realities.
2434;I reckon this is his homage not only to Washington Irving, but also to great Hammer Films of his youth.
2435;in terms of technical aspects, """"Sleepy Hollow"""" is one of most visually spectacular and seamlessly crafted picture in Burton's oeuvre."""
2436;Thanks to Emmanuel Lubezki, the cinematography is dazzling.
2437;The colors are wonderfully washed out that at first glance it gives the impression that the film was shot black and white.
2438;the art direction is impressive too.
2439;Sets are masterfully designed from the foggy town to creepy woods.
2440;It's hard to believe that 90 percent of the movie was shot in the studio, on specially constructed sets with some scenes enhanced with CGI (especially Hessian's sequences).
2441;horror, humor and romance go hand in hand throughout the movie.
2442;He fearlessly cuts up corpses with Cronenberg.
2443;Evidently, their romance is the spice added to the spooky mood of the story.
2444;last word: absolutely fantastic and entertaining film on every aspect .
2445;I am not a fan of scary movies, but this was just the right amount of suspense and thrill.
2446;it is really a frightening number.
2447;I still enjoy watching it.
2448;Very beautifully and darkly filmed, great acting, fun dialogue and the usual Tim Burton tongue.
2449;If you haven't seen it you really have a treat waiting for you!
2450;This movie has some of Johnny Depp's most loveable moments as an idiosyncratic lead actor.
2451;It also provides an 18th century New England fantasy world you will love to get lost in.
2452;This Is A Great Film!Johnny Depp as usual plays a unusual role in this movie and did a Great Job.
2453;I think this is one of the best movies i have seen in a long time and urg every one to see it.
2454;This movie is one of the good ones.
2455;Johnny Depp plays Ichabod Crane he is very good.
2456;This is definitely a new spin on a old classic.
2457;This is the classic tale of Icobbod Crane (Johnny Depp) and his fight with the headless horseman.
2458;He overcomes his fear of religion and the unknown to find the person responsible for controlling the horseman dispite the help of this God fearing town.
2459;The special effects in this movie are second to none, the soundtrack/musical score adds a chilling feel to the movie.
2460;A must see for all Johnny Depp/Christina Ricci fans.
2461;Oh, it's no masterpiece, but it EXACTLY captured what I used to see in my head when Grandma told me bedtime stories.
2462;my Grandma was pretty scary, but it was fun scary, the kind that made you scrunch down under the covers but not far enough so that you couldn't hear every word.
2463;I simply love this movie, phenomenal and eery landscaping with great direction and a more whole approach to the sleepy hallow legend!
2464;he is always perfect in every role he's cast for, and he's great in this film for the small amount of time he's in it.
2465;the rest of the cast are also masters of their craft and do a superb job.
2466;i love Tim Burton's work and I was excited to see this movie.
2467;He stayed true to the spirit of the original story in many respects and kept you guessing and on your toes for a while.
2468;there is one awesome scene, in which you see the headless horseman exiting his hidden lair.
2469;seeing that just once almost makes the movie worth seeing (almost).
2470;The film was good at startling the audience in many places and the costumes and backdrops were excellent.
2471;a feast for the eyes for this genre.
2472;a good take on the story we grew up on.
2473;I liked this movie because I like Tim Burton a lot, and that may make the difference between did you like it or did you not like it?
2474;Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci did a really good job, and Christopher Walken (I think that's his name) also did a really good job playing the Headless Horseman.
2475;Added to the fantastc soundtrack by Elfman it made a stupendously good film.
2476;I would recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it.
2477;It's got special features on it that aren't on VHS.
2478;My husband and I re watched this for Halloween and were surprised at how well it held up.
2479;This is a very good movie I love how Tim Burton portays his views of the movie in his weird twisted way.
2480;The acting was great and Chris as the headless hourse man was great I give it two thumbs, up way up.
2481;I liked this movie because it had a dark, gothic atmosphere.
2482;The whole movie draws you into a cold autumn town being stalked by the headless horseman.
2483;The movie had great gore and bloodshed in it The butchery is beautiful.
2484;It has a very good story line that was way more developed than the original headless horseman story.
2485;This is a great Halloween movie.
2486;Sleepy Hollow is one of the most entertaining films in a long time.
2487;It is funny, scary, exciting and a visual masterpiece.
2488;The cast are all great especially Johnny Depp who is fantastic as the nervous detective, though one of the (unbilled)stars is slightly wasted .
2489;The most impressive thing about the film is its visual look.
2490;You can tell that every single frame was carefully planned and the special effects are fantastic.
2491;Not the best Tim Burton film, but certainly a welcome return to his gothic sensabilities after the kitch of Mars Attacks.
2492;This is a lot of fun and well worth a look.
2493;Simply put, his films are a joy to watch (except for the miserable Planet Of The Apes).
2494;Watch this movie and you'll see what I'm talking about.
2495;From start to finish, this movie is captivating.
2496;All of the characters are wonderfully real, even the ones you know aren't going to survive very long.
2497;On that same note, the acting is wonderful.
2498;Depp does a nearly perfect job as Crane, and Christina Ricci is good as Katrina Van Tassel, Crane's romantic interest.
2499;Overall, the movie is great, with excellent sets and special effects (that creepy tree with the nasty surprise comes to mind).
2500;like visuals I doubt you'll mind.
2501;This movie has the same type of visuals and musical score.
2502;plus there are quite a few other great actors, christopher walkin being one of them.
2503;If you're a fan if Johnny Dep, I am, then you'll enjoy this movie since he's ever bit as endearing as most of the characters he plays under the directorship of Tim Burton.
2504;He comes equipped with a whole lot of theory and some strange contraptions, more charm, and some baggage from childhood that wakens in Sleepy Hollow with the help of the lovely Christina Richie, from the Addams family movies, aka Wednesday now all grown up and blonde.
2505;She's excellent in this movie.
2506;it's typically Tim Burton with weird cinematography, gnarled trees, dark sets, but it really does work in this one, since it should have all those things.
2507;It's a good script, a very good cast including Christopher Walkin as the Horseman.
2508;I will easily give this 4 stars for entertainment value alone.
2509;Another good one to curl up with anytime.
2510;Sleepy Hollow is as creepy and exciting as it is visually stunning.
2511;It tells the ancient story of Ichabod Crane and his bout with the legendary HEadless Horseman.
2512;This movie has many strengths, such as Beautiful yet creepy and gothic.
2513;like atmosphere, a solid plot, and an EXTREMELY creepy portrayel by Christopher Walken.
2514;But I think that this movie is Tim Burton's best and definitely one of the more unique(in a good way) horror films put out in a while.
2515;This one is so much more than that.
2516;Sleepy Hollow adds a delightful combination of suspense and even humor that makes it one to be enjoyed repeatedly.
2517;"Christina Ricci did very well
2518;Christopher Walken as the Horseman is nothing short of extraordinary.
2519;This cast was brilliantly put together.
2520;Tim Burton and Francis Ford Coppola make quite a team.
2521;I see so many subtle hints to numerous other horror movies and I usually don't like that but it was very effectively done here.
2522;the sound effects, set design, cinematography, music, and special effects combine to make this movie exceptional.
2523;I find it extremely interesting and fascinating"
2524;I highly recommend this to horror/suspense/thriller fans!
2525;This is the first horror movie that I've seen (possibly ever) that is both scary and funny but most of all entertaining.
2526;My bet is you will enjoy this movie.
2527;I take it with a grain of salt.
2528;I love look and feel of all of his movies.
2529;A great movie with a great cast.
2530;This is a wonderful movie!
2531;The cinematography, acting, and script are wonderful.
2532;I highly recommend this movie for anyone who likes Halloween Movies
2533;This unique movie takes you from 17th century(?)
2534;The setting and line of characters (including the traditional witch and wicked stepmother right down to the well.
2535;The skillful lighting and great resolution lend a hand to the originality.
2536;Jonny Depp particularly adds to the enchantment with this well excecuted portrayal of his unusual character, Ichabod Craine.
2537;known Sleepy Hollow legend on screen, you must experience it for yourself.
2538;Tim Burton certainly has a knack for noire, and this is the best of his films yet, Edward Scissorhands following a very close second.
2539;The art direction and cinematography in this film is amazing, not only for the creepy and ethereal scenery but coupled with interesting camera angles and long, focused shots on dream.
2540;this is a film for all ages, just as Edward Scissorhands is, and both films share the properties that make them great.1)Johnny Depp.
2541;This man has an incredibly mobile and almost comedic face, his expressions endearing and farcical.
2542;He makes an impressive turn with his character here, playing the endearing, faint.
2543;His constant episodes of passing out, turning up his nose at numerous corpses and consistent nervous stutters make him a very enjoyable presence on.
2544;This is the beauty among the muck and blood in this film, and it captivates viewers young and old who share a fascination with magic and mystery.
2545;Burton may be a scholar in the area of gothic cinematics, but he has a special and unmatchable ability for uplifting and mystical moments in his films, a prime example in yet again Edward Scissorhands , where Winona Ryder twirls happily in circles while snowflakes fall slowly around her, the choral music making the moment even more touching and serene.3)The special effects.
2546;I loved all the blood and the head.
2547;If this is going to be classified as a horror film, it has to have some of the winning traits that make it so.
2548;I am a horror fan, and I thoroughly enjoyed the disgusting cadavers and consistent decapitation.
2549;Burton doesn't have a history of graphic violence in his films, but it worked out well for him in this one, combined with the computer.
2550;That is a great starter film for anyone who wants to get acclimated in the Burton film genre.
2551;This was a really cool flick!
2552;The acting by Depp,Walken,Jones, Ricci was all great, and of course Burton's unique style of directing made for a visually stunning film as well.
2553;Sleepy Hollow is without a doubt one of the best pieces of work Tim Burton has contributed to American Cinema.
2554;Burton takes scary movies to a whole new level, weaving his own morsels of fantasy, detail, and mystery into the story.
2555;his movie is based upon Washington Irving's classic tale, The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.
2556;also living in the house is Lady Van Tassel, played wonderfully by Miranda Richardson, and Baltus's beautiful daughter, Katrina (Christina Ricci).
2557;He also notices Katrina's secret practice of magic, which he is accustomed to because of past events revolving around his mother and father.
2558;He also begins to realize, with us by his side, that the things the town has told him about the Headless Horseman are true, and that another villain, with much more power than the Horseman, could be lurking amonst the villagers.
2559;It is definitely worth your time and money.
2560;Even if you don't like scary movies, close your eyes when you want and watch the rest just to see the beautiful scenery, because this is the most gorgeous eye.
2561;candy to be made yet.
2562;It is one of my favorite horror films, even better that Rosemary's Baby, Final Destination, and The Exorcist.
2563;A great story with an excellent plot.
2564;A good story always makes me come a part of the story.
2565;"That ""Sleepy Hollow"" manages to evoke memories of Saturday afternoon monster thrillers is its biggest strength
2566;It's really worth about three and a half stars, but with Amazon's system, I'll round up to four because of the appearances of so many great character actors .
2567;Again Burton proves that his impressionistic, dark, and completely absorbing imagination is at its peak.
2568;This is not Beetlejuice , it is something far superior.
2569;Digging deeper into the madness he began's to find a trail, and following this trail could lead to his grave.
2570;burton remains true to the legend in many aspects.
2571;Ricci's surreal character is alluring and well thought out, enchanting the viewer with her beauty and mystery.
2572;the magic, mayhem, and complete majesty of this haunting film will ensare viewers, and although the tongue.
2573;Definitely a welcomed change for Hollywood's usual idea of horror and a much needed return to the classic traditions.
2574;Tim Burton's take on the classic tale is very intriguing.
2575;The cast is fantastic and most interesting is the minimal use of Christopher Walken as the horseman, who make him much creepier with a face.
2576;A few minor gripes but it's still an entertaining watch.
2577;The film has a number of suspenseful moments.
2578;Christopher Walken perhaps gives the best performance in the entire film.
2579;Walken has virtually no dialogue and has only several minutes of screen time but he exudes an absolutely terrifying presence.
2580;Tim Burton is just the man to bring Washington Irving's macabre little tale to the screen, and his gothic touch is deftly applied.
2581;The result is movie with the perfect balance of horror and humour, leaving just enough space for the familial feud at the centre of Andrew Kevin Walker's tidy screenplay to see the light of day.
2582;The largely English cast is a joy to behold even in minor roles, as are the wonderful action sequences, subtle special effects, and stupendous art direction which more than deserved the Oscar it eventually won.
2583;Depp shows, yet again, that he's one of the most under.
2584;This is a great movie for anyone.
2585;It's got something for young and old.
2586;If your family likes spooky movies this one would be great to view together.
2587;They'll love the scary parts and you'll love the humor Johnny Depp and lovely Christina Ricci bring to this story.
2588;A great Halloween movie set in an early American Dutch village.
2589;I really love this movie, I think you will too.
2590;I watch it every year around Halloween"
2591;IF you want the scary version, watch the animated Sleepy Hollow by Disney.
2592;Burton does an AMAZING job with the visual and sound effects.
2593;I think he did a superb job interpreting Ichabod Crane (a regular wimp trying to impress a girl is always one of the funniest things to observe.
2594;I know because people tell me I look funny when I try to impress the ladies.)
2595;a seat in the horror movie section.
2596;I'd love to see it either in the suspense or comedy sections.
2597;The movie is one of the best movies Burton has come out with since Beatlejuice and Batman.
2598;My sister and I love Halloween, and this movie is a perfect one to watch to get in the appropriate spirit.
2599;In addition to fine acting, the special effects and artistic rendition of Sleepy Hollow is classic Tim Burton.
2600;The lighting is fanciful, changing as the film nears its conclusion.
2601;`The legend of Sleepy Hollow' is one of those stories that everyone has known for as long as they can remember, and because everyone knows it, it is sometimes hard to step away from the big picture and understand why this story peaks the interest of so many.
2602;"Really though, it's quite simple
2603;played by the brilliant character actor, Christopher Walken, in Tim Burton's interpretation of the Sleepy Hollow story, he is as fierce and menacing as ever.
2604;christina Ricci is the beautiful, young daughter of Baltus Van Tassel (head of one of two wealthy families in the town).
2605;Instead, it gets right to the heart of the story, which is, of course, based primarily on the supernatural.
2606;between the classic, creepy story, flawless atmosphere and talented actors, `Sleepy Hollow' has earned itself a place among the rare breed of horror movie that succeeds at being both gory and good.
2607;heartedly give this movie five stars.
2608;A gorgeous film with many wonderful actors, Sleepy Hollow is hindered by a mediocre script and a bit too much scenery.
2609;Tim Burton did it again,strike!
2610;The years best,funniest,creepiest and most bizzar movie!
2611;With great landscapes and breathtaking Speciall Effects, plus very talented actors including:Depp, Ricci and Walken!
2612;While Burton's Sleepy Hollow isn't Washington Irvings', the fact is that the movie is simply wonderful.
2613;Forget the book for a while and enjoy it.
2614;The photography is amazing and the idea of using Ichabod Crane to parody the image of the image of the distant, calculating detective is brillant!
2615;The pacing and infusion of comedy makes the entire film a joy to watch.
2616;The sequence of the horseman stalking a small child in a home will make you hold your breath.
2617;The performances are flawless and the special effects are done to enhance the story line, rather than being an end in themselves.
2618;Burton and Depp are a wonderful team together and I hope they do many more projects in the future.
2619;Personally, I love his movies (hence the 5 star rating) and think that this is one of the best!There is a great cast here, and Johnny Depp, in particular, shines in a role that seems made for him.
2620;Well acted, fast moving, a mystery within a mystery, but that master of American Lit, Washington Irving, probably not only turned over in his grave, but turned it over to the headless horseman
2621;He uses Johnny Depp in a lot of his movies, so since I am a Johnny Depp fan and a Tim Burton fan, I enjoyed this movie.
2622;This picture is a great story about Ickabod Crain, The story was first told a Long time ago with an animated version from Disney, The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.
2623;Even tho, Christopher Walken was not given any credits in the movie, He played an important and very convencing role.
2624;Depp was perfect for the role with his boyish look , but Christina did't fit so well.
2625;This movie is great for anybody who isn't well with horror movies , but is fond of funny and maybe a little scary.
2626;Another stellar performance by Johnny Depp.
2627;This should also go down as one of Tim Burton's finest works.
2628;Having enjoyed the movie, I am rather surprised to read that other reviewers consider this a horror flick.
2629;The set for this town truly makes the film come alive.
2630;The screenplay definitely deviates from the cartoon I saw as a child .
2631;In fact, I was more amused by the subtle humor of the film than I was frightened by the gore of it.
2632;both good and evil .
2633;are quite prevelant in the film.
2634;I got excactly what I wanted when I got this.
2635;there are only a few gentle laughs to be found here, unless you find it hilarious to witness a foppish Johnny Depp recoil from cadavers in disgust.
2636;developed, and their scenes are so bereft of passion and legitimate emotion that I was unable to muster up the energy to care about their dilemmas.
2637;There are teenage pranks involving jack'o'lanterns (ooh!)
2638;heavily atmospheric, Gothic settings and gorgeous, lush cinematography .
2639;It LOOKS good, but that's about it.
2640;SLEEPY HOLLOW (1999), starring Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, Miranda Richardson, Michael Gambon, Casper Van Dien, and Jeffrey Jones, combines horror, suspense, and comedy brilliantly.
2641;Directed by Tim Burton, the film looks terrific with exquisite sets and evocative cinematography.
2642;If Burton takes liberties with the Irving classic, he succeeds in creating a superior black comedy with his distinctive trademark.
2643;King Burton has done it again!
2644;Sleepy Hollow is a tremendous eclectation of what today's special effects can accompish, and what Tim Burton's (one brick shy of a building) brain can concieve.
2645;Washington Irving himself would have been proud to see how his brainchild has been brought up.
2646;This movie really captures the true talent of Johnny Depp.
2647;But even decent special effects can't save this thing.
2648;but there is something positive to say about this movie: I managed to get a good nap.
2649;Last thing I remember, Chris Walken was growing his head.
2650;Heck, give one to a friend.
2651;With a great cast and a great story, the movie really comes to life, or should I say, it rolls some heads?
2652;The special effects in the movie are awesome and the color of the town really makes an atmosphere of death, just how good can Tim Burton get.
2653;But I can only say that you'll love this movie, it has so much to offer and can appeal to most people, even the love story type of people (yuck).
2654;I absolutely love this movie.
2655;johnny Depp and Tim Burton at their best.
2656;a great story with unforgettable characters and a great twist to the old story that gives an amazing backstory to the origin of the headless horseman.
2657;Great production values, fun plotline, exciting action, and good acting.
2658;Good sound?This film really captures the spirit of Halloween .
2659;the feeling is really expressed with a well.
2660;placed line early in the film: You're a long way from New York, constable.
2661;This Movie Is great it reminds me of the times of simplicity interlaced with horror.
2662;This movie was greatly casted and directed and is a must see.
2663;This is one of my favorite movies to watch at Halloween.
2664;I've always loved the original story by Washington Irving and have enjoyed the various film and animated adaptions over the years.
2665;Jeffrey Jones has appeared in several early American themed films including Ravenous and the Crucible and this time plays the town Reverend with his usual fervor.
2666;Burton does a wonderful job of capturing an authentic look and feel of early America.
2667;The effects were very well done and also give credit to the great Christopher Walken as the Hessian soldier, sharpened teeth and all, who would go onto become the phantom horseman.
2668;There's a lenghty making of documentary, interviews with the cast, and commentary by Burton.
2669;Just a fantastic movie to watch at this time of the year.
2670;Like most Tim Burton movies, this is a beautiful movie without much of a plot.
2671;This movie is the best depiction of this urban legend (THE HEADLESS HORSEMEN).
2672;it is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo funny it deservs to be bought for that reason alone, and if you love comic books you will definently love this movie, it is like watching the pages turn.
2673;johnny Depp (as Constable Ichabod Crane) displays his skill at portraying a character who is both humorous and earnest in this adaptation, applying Burton's concept of 19th century forensic equipment to the task of uncovering the origin of the mysterious circumstances that are causing people to lose their heads in the small village.
2674;top as, for example, his characters in Mars Attacks!Best watched around Halloween, Sleepy Hollow is an entertaining ride through a nightmare with a distinctly Burton.
2675;Can be viewed by any age and great story line.
2676;I thoroughly enjoyed watching this.
2677;It has become one if my favorite movies.
2678;It is a classic and this movie rendidtion is absolutely superb.
2679;Johnny Depp is genius in this movie.
2680;this was a really good movie.
2681;SLEEPY HOLLOW (1999) is a stunning film that draws the viewer in from the beginning.
2682;Tim Burton does a superb job as usual in creating the right environment and atmosphere.
2683;Johnny Depp shines in this film as the vulnerable, somewhat complicated Ichabod Crane.
2684;He comes into town with an aura about him that he knows what he's doing and isn't afraid and wants you to know it.
2685;Overall, this film is a winner, and Burton is once again the master of creating an environment.
2686;I recommend this movie, especially around this time of year.
2687;Great movie that offers a darker side to the headless horse man story!!
2688;Slepy Hollow is an amusing twist on the old fable and of course tomany80's did its usual outstanding job.
2689;A great up dated story you can not miss on Halloween tale.
2690;great for the whole family.12 stars, great FX.
2691;It had many twists and turns and it really catches you in the end.
2692;I enjoyed Johnny Depp, who seems to have blossomed since 21Jumpstreet.
2693;Good movie, very suspenseful and worth the price.
2694;you'll like it for years.
2695;This gripping tale begins with a shocking scene within the first 5 minutes!
2696;Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci are great.
2697;Tim Burton, being the genius that he is, has, in this delightfully sickening and humorous story, taken three of the best genres and crammed them into one.
2698;secondly, thanks to Johnny Depp and his catalogue of hilarious yet sinister facial expressions, we have a film which not only makes us shudder, but laugh in the midst of the darkness.
2699;He plays hapless Constable Ichabod Crane, with an air so realistic, so camp and so.
2700;He stumbles his way through the film with likeable cluelessness, loveable eccentricity and a wave of sparkling intellect that sometimes make time when he is offscreen simply waiting time.
2701;the third is of course, the fairy tale.
2702;But when you can appreciate it for a fairy tale, a dark comedy and a horror film, you will be drawn to it with an indefinable fascination.
2703;Johnny Depp was perfect for this roll.
2704;The first thing you have to do with this film is give up your preconception of the story which you got during your childhood and from Disney.
2705;I then came here to see what others were saying and was surprised to see how many people gave it five stars.
2706;It's the adults' version of the legend transformed and managed with the confident creative eye of Burton.
2707;Depp is wonderfully adept as Ichabod Crane and does some very creative acting which works perfectly.
2708;The whole look of the film is delicious in its dark way and always convincing.
2709;It's got the riveting tension and visuals of the best modern horror films entwined in Burton's quirky vision and balanced with some visual comedy.
2710;Christopher Walken is a delight as he always is.
2711;He has to be the funnest actor in Hollywood.
2712;the special features give a good reminder of how much work, and how many people, and how much money goes into a major film of this type.
2713;So much talent and resources in one spot.
2714;Johnny Depp's version of this classic tale is only enhanced by Blu.
2715;Starting with the dark, yet beautifully filmed scenery, great stoy and wonderful acting, I don't think it could have been done any better.
2716;johnny Depp shows great talent, and it everything I invisioned Icahbod Crane should be.
2717;He speaks well, looks adorable =) and is able to inject a little humor in certain scenes.
2718;She is carries herself rather well, with a lovely voice to follow.
2719;Young Masbeth also does a great job, as does the rest of the cast.
2720;this acting combined with great scenery and a great script makes a great movie.
2721;The action scenes are filled with tension and humor.
2722;Leave it to Tim Burton to create such a beautuful and humor.
2723;Any combination of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp is a guaranteed hit in my opinion.
2724;The world that Tim created for this movie is so amazing, I wish I could visit it!
2725;One of my favorites of all time.
2726;excellent special effects, art direction, story, direction, costumes and casting!
2727;town counstable who has been sent to investigate the decapiting murders of the town of Sleepy Hollow!You'll scream, you'll laugh, you'll have fun!
2728;the best film of 1999!
2729;Sleepy Hollow is a pretty cool movie.
2730;The Headless Horseman myth has always fascinated me so I was delighted to watch Burton's take on the legend.
2731;Its great because this movie has just the right amount of elements.
2732;Its mysterious, its spooky and thilling, its subtle and romantic too and its even a comedy.
2733;Of course, this isn't to be taken seriously, and its really not a scary film whatsoever, but it is a fun film.
2734;I thoroughly enjoyed watching it.
2735;Its a really good 'popcorn flick'.
2736;Johnny Depp, as usual, gives a first rate performance.
2737;Christina Ricci once again shows why she's one of our most interesting and talented actresses.
2738;And Christopher Walken as the Hessian Horseman is perfect casting.
2739;It's also great to see Christopher Lee (the first Dracula I ever saw in movies).
2740;Tim Burton's director's commentary is also fun to listen to.
2741;While Sleepy Hallow isn't that scary, it can be kind of gross, it's a fine halloween movie.
2742;This take on the old story is very entertaining.
2743;Dep is mesmerizing, as usual.
2744;The backstory of Crane's mother having been a child of nature is especially good.
2745;Great new twis of the story line of Sleepy Hollow!!
2746;The movie rides the tale out quite well while Tim Burton takes his own spins of certain plot points they are often for the better.
2747;A solid film with decent proformances, it gave me more than I expected.
2748;I love movie I been looking for it for yrs and now I haver found it and own it thank you so much
2749;His direction for this film was absolutely fantastic.
2750;While investigating, Crane develops a love interest for a lovely townsperson (Ricci).
2751;All the actors give great and believeable performances.
2752;And it was really nice to see Christopher Walken as the Headless Horseman.
2753;Actually, its a rather nice piece of cr*p starring johnny depp, who i could eat with a spoon.
2754;This classic Halloween tale has been taken to new scare tactics by the fantastic imagination of director Tim Burton.
2755;The heroine Katrina Van Tassel (Christina Ricci) is wise in her own regard having a few ancient tricks up her sleeve to aid Crane with his fight against the evil haunting in Sleepy Hollow.
2756;depp and Ricci are always great together and especially when paired with the amazing mind of Burton and the set creations he manages to conjure up in all of his pictures.
2757;The special effects are really astounding and the world of Sleepy Hollow (created in a film studio) is spookily enchanting just as a fairy tale should exist within.
2758;As with all of Burton's films between the darkness there exists a sense of comical wonder that creeps between the edges of fear.
2759;This is a great Halloween movie but I wouldn't watch it until the young ones are asleep because it is penetrating enough to cause a few nightmares worth waking up from.
2760;A wonderful version of the Legend of Sleepy Hollow tale told from the imagination of Tim Burton and the brilliant acting of Johnny Depp.
2761;Funny yet disturbing this movie will keep you interested from start to finish.
2762;The team work of Burton and Depp just keeps on delivering delightfully wicked movies for us to enjoy.
2763;The Sleepy Hollow is a good movie,for a mature audience with historical background in culture of the Colony from America.
2764;A good movie,from a good novel,by a good author with historical ghost,demon and detective works.
2765;Highly recommend,a legend of headless demon from greed or revenge plot to detective or scientific work.
2766;Fun movie,for an enjoyable audience with mature mind.
2767;This picture draws you in, and never lets go.
2768;It's nice to see a revival of such a wonderful story.
2769;Christina Ricci is marvelous as Katrina, and Johnny Depp provides a fresh take on Ichabod.
2770;Probably the best of all was Christopher Walken, whose time was short, yet powerful enough to scare this seasoned horror fan out of her seat.
2771;What a wonderful take on the old chestnut.
2772;Depp is the perfect choice for the only slightly less hapless Ichabod Crane character.
2773;Burton weaves the tale perfectly, leading Depp down a giddily frightening sequence of increasingly wild events culminating in a satisfying and mind.
2774;Dark, scary, humorous, an eccentric, fun take.
2775;Washington Irving would enjoy it immensely, I think.
2776;My wife and I love it!
2777;This is by far our favorite version of this classic Halloween tale!
2778;All of the actors do a great job and Tim Burton's vision of upstate New York in the late 1700's is just brilliant!
2779;If you are looking for a great Halloween movie to watch, pick this one!
2780;This is an awesome movie.
2781;Jhonny Dep at one of his best acting.
2782;He's the best Ichbod there could be!
2783;Like To have half of my money back and ill be very happy.
2784;I had high expectations for this movie
2785;I think this movie is a great film the best I've seen yet, Johnny Depp is a great actor in this film.
2786;depp is amazing as the milque toast crane and he puts this tale into an eerie perspective as the sort of beaky and benevolent 18th century policeman/scholar.
2787;This disc seemed in good condition at first glance.
2788;this is a great movie.
2789;one of johnnys best films out there for that period.
2790;I love all of his movies.
2791;One of my favorite movies of all time.
2792;Sleepy Hollow, a creative twist on an old classic.
2793;It had moments where it could have been better, hence the four star rating, but overall it was enjoyable.
2794;Washington Irving laid the foundation for this story.
2795;a wonderful structure, but not what Irving had in mind.
2796;depp, of course, is wonderful as an overly straight.
2797;Ricci does an outstanding job, too.
2798;The real star, though is Tim Burton's visual sense.
2799;made product, with ripples and pontil marks.
2800;the story is well paced, with a web of interlocking tensions between the main characters.
2801;The visuals create a rich, spooky ambience.
2802;This movie is easy to enjoy and well worth the time spent.
2803;Sleepy Hollow is epiclly gorgeous,full of eye.
2804;tim Burton,the creator of singular masterpieces like Edward Scissorhands and Beetlejuice outdoese himself here,presenting his most visionary film yet.
2805;based on the look and feel of classic Hammer horror films of the fifties and sixties,the film largely takes place on an expertly crafted soundstage,giving the scenes in the woods and around the fabled town of Sleepy Hollow a classicly evocative feel.
2806;tim Burton is an expert at creating atmospheres,and here he imbues the film with a perfectly forboding,autumnal resonense that's perfect for Holloween,it may become the October 31st classic that movies like Frankenstien are now.
2807;the film stars Johnny Depp,one of the most fearlessly dedicated actors working today,as the indomitable Ichabod Crane,the New York constable(it's 1799)sent to Sleepy Hollow to investigate several murders where the victim's heads were lopped off clean as dandilion heads ,as the great Christopher Lee puts it in sly cameo.
2808;crane is a great believer in sense and reason,and the scientific,logical explanations behind things.
2809;his journey, three days to the north ,sets the tone of the film.
2810;his carriage ride through beautifully wrought landscapes,backed by Danny Elfman's sweeping score,establishes a thrilling mood that is only strengthened once he arrives.
2811;he's introduced to the other characters.
2812;reverend Steenwyke,played by the priceless Jeffery Jones,Magistrate Phillipse,Notary Hardenbrook,and Doctor Lancaster.
2813;there's also a surprisingly tender(if under developed) romance between Ichabod and Katrina,as she beguiles him with her white magic .
2814;johnny Depp and Christina Ricci give fine performances,finding the heart and intelligence in thier characters,and lending a grounding sense of believability even as the heads start piling up.
2815;the overall sense of this film is something deep and primal,it hints at the origins of fairy tales,as well demonstrating why they retain such a hold on our collective psyche,tapping into elemental fears,and confronting them.
2816;it's thrilling,moody,frightening,funny,completely absorbing and smashingly entertaining.
2817;It's A Wonderful LIfe is often called the perfect Christmas film.
2818;well,say hello to the perfect Holloween film.
2819;Burton's take on Sleepy Hollow gives us a chilling new look at the Headless Horseman.
2820;Johnny Depp turns in what could be his best performance to date as Crane.
2821;Christopher Walken is an excellent choice for the Hessian Horseman.
2822;Gough, Jones, and Griffiths give us a look into the upper class of Sleepy Hollow.
2823;The action and scenery of this movie are incredible.
2824;Tim Burton does an excellent job especially on the windmill scene.
2825;the creation and detail that went into this movie is astonishing.
2826;But who can deny his great visual talants?
2827;This guy knows how to make a film LOOK good, that's for sure.
2828;as for """"Sleepy Hollow,"""" this is Burton's stylish 1999 take on Washington Irving's classic tale about Ichabod Crane and the Headless Horseman starring Johnny Depp as Crane and Christopher Walken as the Hessian horseman."""
2829;As is usual, Depp is outstanding.
2830;other than Depp, four things really impress me about this picture: (1.)
2831;"I love the spooky Fall atmosphere
2832;in an incredibly horrific/supernatural fashion, not to mention skilled with weaponry and virtually unstoppable.
2833;the last half hour or so is packed with action, so if your attention starts wandering, don't worry, it picks up big time.
2834;emphasize that """"Sleepy Hollow"""" is defintely the ideal creep flick for the autumn."""
2835;but wow, this movie is great!
2836;its really gothic and although its probably a horror movie, it has its bright sides as well :P johnny depp is wonderful and the entire movie is just spine tingling.
2837;This movie was recommended to me by my cousin.
2838;it is even more fun to watch at night.
2839;great classic love story with characters that everyone quotes all the time.
2840;I love that it's in blu.

2843;I loved how the horsemans teeth were filed to points because it made him look remarkably pirhanna like.
2844;I had an excellent time watching this at the theatre because it keeps you on the edge of your seat.
