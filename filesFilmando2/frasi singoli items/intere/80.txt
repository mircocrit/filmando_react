I:9343;1;I was fascinated at first with how intriguing Magnolia seemed to pretend to be.
I:9343;2;Great performances by he actors.
I:9343;3;all did a charming job.
I:9343;4;Half the movie was a music video for Aimee Mann's great songs.
I:9343;5;as the movie has it .
I:9343;6;Still, the experience, once experienced, will loom larger than the grudging, prosaic truth .
I:9343;7;this is also the best movie of its type since Short Cuts.
I:9343;8;What is important to some may not be to others, but director Paul Thomas Anderson obviously wanted to say something he felt was important and I believe he accomplished that goal.
I:9343;9;There is a beautiful poetic sense here that I feel was overshadowed by last year's poetic champion, American Beauty.
I:9343;10;The last hour is when I begin to feel being in the theatre, but the ending always makes up for it and revives me.
I:9343;11;This film deserved far better accolades than it received.
I:9343;12;It is funny how Hollywood demands seriousness and self.
I:9343;13;This is tragic, because the Boogie Nights commentary was so good.
I:9343;14;Sound and picture are very good.
I:9343;15;there is a lot of gratuitousness.
I:9343;16;the acting is what saves it from a one star rating.
I:9343;17;This is really a great film.
I:9343;18;The interplay between Cruise, who gives a performance which is just beyond belief, and his father is remarkable.
I:9343;19;The end is very unique and special.
I:9343;20;Alot of credit to those involved.
I:9343;21;The movie starts and you're caught in the stories that life can offer for us to know, and with the hand of liitle more than genious Paul Thomas Anderson, Magnolia offers you the chance to experience sweet, sour, devastating, funny, dramatic moments in the life of some people one rainy day in San Fernando Valley.
I:9343;22;Mellorah Walters performance is magnificent.
I:9343;23;Laughing, crying or screaming, Mellorah manages to capture Claudia's constant desire to be saved and loved.
I:9343;24;One of the last genuine good people left in San Fernando and the world, jim's only wish is to help people and find someone to love.
I:9343;25;Tough sometimes ingenuous jim manages to make you beleive in his good intensions towards others.
I:9343;26;Phillip Baker Hall is superb displaying an amazing dominium of his experienced actor skills.
I:9343;27;A regular family man, famous host of the most popular tv show ''what do kids know?''
I:9343;28;Claudia's secret is then revealed and so is jimmy and our minds and judmental side start to interact with this complex characters.
I:9343;29;The whole character is defined with his great dialogue.
I:9343;30;''I really do have love to give.
I:9343;31;the new star of jimmy's show.
I:9343;32;julianne Moore, truly one of the best actreses of our time.
I:9343;33;she asks him with a look that says more than her vivid words.
I:9343;34;Tom Cruise's greatest performance so far, another great character with a big secret about his past.
I:9343;35;In his case, his past is revealed in front of the cameras by a reporter.
I:9343;36;Cruise's performance at these scenes is just amazing.
I:9343;37;Earl's nurse, phil feels that he has the need to help earl's final whish come true and he works as a channel for it.
I:9343;38;phillip seymour hoffman's performance is remarkable even in the little scenes.
I:9343;39;These scenes are also great.
I:9343;40;all in all magnolia is a great piece of cinema and something is garanteed, at some point even if its just a second, you will see your self there at San Fernando valley one rainy day.
I:9343;41;studded film that presents varying perspectives on the coincidences of life.
I:9343;42;Good and bad happenstances that intertwine for an entertaining look at life and the ripples that flow from ordinary people caught up in extraordinary events.
I:9343;43;Those that thought it was brilliant and moving, and those that thought it lacked interconnectedness and was perhaps somewhat pedantic.
I:9343;44;O. k., I concur that all the elements don't always appear to fit together as a seamless package.
I:9343;45;still, this movie is, without a doubt, powerful and stirring.
I:9343;46;It WILL make you feel something and that is the true criterion by which to judge a movie such as this.
I:9343;47;As an aside, a suggestion for viewing.
I:9343;48;This movie has great power.
I:9343;49;Try to enjoy it for what it is, and not what you might wish it could be.
I:9343;50;It's an amazing film when the brain allows a moving step to the next faze of live to be better of as defined by Abraham Maslow 1908.1970 with his Maslow theory.
I:9343;51;I've liked Boogie Nights .
I:9343;52;Taking home the second of the year's floral offerings .
I:9343;53;I was preparing myself for something very rewarding.
I:9343;54;for the first half an hour I was intrigued by the 3 accidents .
I:9343;55;i sat back and thought .
I:9343;56;my attention span exceeds the movie's length by couple hours.
I:9343;57;when the transitional age comes everything is so complicated, nice people just pretend to be nice, your body changes and demands it's due, you get nasty, you flare up.
I:9343;58;later we mature, become more balanced, see things in a perspective, acquire stoicism and understanding, the will to carry on.
I:9343;59;Ambitious and undereducated genius wants to show us the way life is, the adult life, the life that provided him with so few meaningful experiences.
I:9343;60;and her touching narrative is transformed into the nerve.
I:9343;61;one of the central to the film.
I:9343;62;also has to be used to the full.
I:9343;63;the film is twice the normal size .
I:9343;64;I've married him for money and now I love him!
I:9343;65;Yes, the finale is unexpected.
I:9343;66;Tom Cruise shines in this movie as a boisterous chauvinist self.
I:9343;67;It is a compulsively watchable movie, even if the ending is a little inaccessible to the audience.
I:9343;68;This is a must for anyone interested in how films are created, from the concept to the script, to the actual shooting.
I:9343;69;I adored Boogie Nights and thought the cast and director could only top it.
I:9343;70;But my research revealed mostly positive ratings by reviewers.
I:9343;71;if you want a positive look at some of the same types of problems, with fine performances and useful insights, try Lawrence Kasdan's Mumford or Grand Canyon .
I:9343;72;i love this movie it is one of my favorites.
I:9343;73;its a good movie i recommend it to any one
I:9343;74;This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.
I:9343;75;Though it was long and I was exhausted by the end of the movie I really felt it was a great movie.
I:9343;76;A Wonderfully quirky MovieWe enjoyed seeing this again as we haven't seen it since it first came out.
I:9343;77;We enjoyed the music score and the humor also.
I:9343;78;I will instead give my personal experience with this movie.
I:9343;79;After 12 years I still listen to it regularly, and in fact I'm listening to it now as I type this review.
I:9343;80;It's sad and poignant, and the music and the movie fit together perfectly.
I:9343;81;The people who passionately love this movie love it on an emotional and experiential level.
I:9343;82;Just remember that there's only 1 first time, and if you love it, be prepared to watch it again many times.
I:9343;83;There's the question of Tom Cruise's performance, as well, undeniably forceful, yet a touch shrill and mannered for my taste.
I:9343;84;PT Anderson, America's finest young filmmaker, worked on two excellent movies before this (I'm especially impressed with Boogie Nights ), but who could have expected such an awesome, ambitious, utterly outrageous monster like Magnolia on only his third try?
I:9343;85;Indeed, this is a visionary work of art, one that gazes directly at the tempest of modern life (and death) without flinching.
I:9343;86;At the very least, he had me thinking about such things, which is a rare accomplishment for a mainstream American movie these days.
I:9343;87;She's absoltuely stunning here, in what must have been a quite challenging role.
I:9343;88;The fact that she's matched strengh for strength by a huge ensemble cast that includes John C. Reilly, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Melora Walters, Phillip Baker Hall, Melinda Dillon, William H. Macy and the great Jason Robards only reaffirms what was obvious from Anderson's previous two outings: He's a great actor's director, capable of coaxing strong performances from even mediocre talent (ie.
I:9343;89;Gwenyth Paltrow's haunting portrayal in Hard Eight ).
I:9343;90;That Aimee Mann's marvelous songs take such a central role is only icing on the cake.
I:9343;91;See this movie for yourself.you may love it, you may hate it, but it will make you think.
I:9343;92;Paul Thomas Anderson is today's greatest filmaker.
I:9343;93;hotties guru, his character's sheer vileness works against any sympathy the audience may build for him.
I:9343;94;Anderson thrilled me with Hard Eight, and blew me away with Boogie Nights.
I:9343;95;Many viewings later, this movie has become one of my favorites.
I:9343;96;"The story is great
I:9343;97;"paul Thomas Anderson is a great director and writer
I:9343;98;"Tom Cruise is wonderful as the sex guru
I:9343;99;Julianne Moore is one of the best actresses out there today.
I:9343;100;, but he is also wonderful in this film in an understated role as Phil, a male nurse.
I:9343;101;Melora Walters, John C. Reilly, and Jason Robards also have wonderful roles.
I:9343;102;There are so many excellent actors and actresses in this film, it is hard to name a favorite performance.
I:9343;103;"the soundtrack is excellent also
I:9343;104;I loved the entire movie, and wouldn't change anything.
I:9343;105;This is the type of thing you watch with friends, then discuss it afterwords.
I:9343;106;Maybe you'll love it and watch it again and again (each time I see it, it's like seeing it for the first time).
I:9343;107;Just take a chance and watch the film.
I:9343;108;Magnolia is one of the few movies I have ever seen that can be classfied as pure art.
I:9343;109;You will begin to notice that all their lives intertwine in an excellent climax.
I:9343;110;Even if the plot does not attract your attention this film is an original and is worth a look.
I:9343;111;The ending in this film answers some things and others it leaves unsolved.
I:9343;112;I think that Magnolia was a brilliant movie full of symbolism and art.
I:9343;113;If you want a light, easy.
I:9343;114;The one sin I haven't heard enumerated yet by other disappointed reviewers is that PT Anderson demonstrated so little storytelling ability!
I:9343;115;The actors are perfectly casted for their roles.
I:9343;116;Each and every one of them fits his/hers better than a glove.
I:9343;117;The storyline with all its twists and turns, the laughter and the tears .
I:9343;118;the Coen brothers and Robert Altman come to mind.
I:9343;119;Paul Thomas Anderson's unique ironic view of reality will stay with me for the rest of my life.
I:9343;120;Paul Thomas Anderson is a remarkable creative mind.
I:9343;121;the film is good, but it is missing something.
I:9343;122;"It surprises me, because that is one thing I find so fascinating about Anderson's other work
I:9343;123;Even something as dark as `There Will Be Blood' is emotionally landscaped in way so that you can feel the ups and downs, the highs and lows with precise effect.
I:9343;124;"`Boogie Nights' balanced tones so effortlessly
I:9343;125;Even a film as `uneven' as `Punch Drunk Love' felt remarkably well thought out (despite my lack of true passion for the film, I easily consider Anderson's direction exceptional).
I:9343;126;Going all the way back to his debut, `Hard Eight', it is notable the way that Anderson plays with darkness in a way that feels eerily accessible.
I:9343;127;There is one emotion that permeates the entire film.
I:9343;128;but, there is something about this film that speaks to me.
I:9343;129;I mentioned, in my review title, a sliver of the film's conclusion, and it is a moment that took me by complete surprise and helped me to appreciate it all the more.
I:9343;130;It added a layer to this film that I wholly need to explore.
I:9343;131;Julianne Moore is heartbreaking and completely sincere as the trophy wife with a plateful of regret.
I:9343;132;William H. Macy and Jeremy Blackman complement one another beautifully, playing the same role just decades apart.
I:9343;133;"Cruise is a firecracker, throwing charisma at everyone in his path and yet it is his emotional breakdown that feels the most real
I:9343;134;"The way he uncovers us layers of true caring while watching over Cruise's dying father
I:9343;135;"the film
I:9343;136;In fact, I kind of find this film utterly fascinating.
I:9343;137;"Like many have said about most all Anderson's work
I:9343;138;anderson has undeniably honed his skill as a director.
I:9343;139;and yet, maybe it is a masterpiece.
I:9343;140;It is touching, funny, surprising, involving, has great dialogue, amazing cast, fascinating characters with a character driven intertwining story all to meet at one hell of a climactic ending, sustainging its position as the most shocking, amazing, and truly brilliant endings to a movie I have ever seen.
I:9343;141;paul Thomas Anderson is a genius.

I:9343;143;Spend any amount on it, I promise any amount you pay is a good price.
I:9343;144;I do have love, says William H. Macy in a moment of bitterness that is both heartbreaking and funny.
I:9343;145;I have so much love to give.
I:9343;146;For anyone who ever had a dark day, or who sang along when the song One came on the radio, have I got a movie for you.
I:9343;147;this is the best film I've seen in years .
I:9343;148;humor and pathos, high drama that scales almost operatic heights, and sweet ironic light touches of sweetness that will stay with me forever.
I:9343;149;It's a gorgeous piece of work.
I:9343;150;But even for him there is hope for redemption, as the film points out.
I:9343;151;what's wonderful about Magnolia is the way Anderson takes everything a step further.
I:9343;152;And then we see that all of this is just a facade, and that there's a good person still capable of tears locked away behind that mask.
I:9343;153;It's incredibly powerful, and yes, Cruise was robbed of that Oscar.
I:9343;154;(Sorry, I love Michael Caine, but really.
I:9343;155;Yes, there are some not so nice people in this film, but as with American Beauty, there's an overall sense of compassion and forgiveness to Magnolia, as if an unseen eye really wants all these people to find happiness and a moment of grace.
I:9343;156;And for every character in the dark there's another in the light .
I:9343;157;characters like the incredible Philip Seymour Hoffman's quiet caregiver, or Reilly's sweetly optimistic cop.
I:9343;158;Throw all these characters together, along with some moments of quiet awareness and mythical whimsy, and Magnolia is a gorgeous movie.
I:9343;159;The wonderful songs by Aimee Mann become almost another character in the film, the voice of their hidden hopes and fears.
I:9343;160;This is most poignantly illustrated in the final moments of the film, as well as in another absolutely strange, absolutely amazing scene that I won't even begin to spoil for you.
I:9343;161;You'll know it when you see it.
I:9343;162;And a special mention has to go to Melora Walters, who in the end provides the story's surprising but all.
I:9343;163;The changing expressions on her face at the film's end, combined with the perfect musical accompaniment in Aimee Mann's Save Me, provided me with one of the most perfect movie moments I've ever experienced.
I:9343;164;All of their parts were good and easy to keep straight.
I:9343;165;i think all of the storylines were very good.
I:9343;166;I thought the script was very good.
I:9343;167;It was about 3 hours long, but it was so interesting the time flew by.
I:9343;168;A fantastic film full of creativity and wonder.
I:9343;169;although I gave this film five stars, it's mainly due to a personal preference.
I:9343;170;I liked this film years ago in the theater.
I:9343;171;I sometimes watch favorite movies again and again.
I:9343;172;"but I've never had this experience of a movie I liked and knew pretty well just suddenly knocking my socks off and vaulting to the top of my ""best movies list""."
I:9343;173;"and I'll also add a nicely written piece of an old review which I think sums it up well for me:""If you can appreciate that a movie can touch your heart, can be something more than just simple entertainment, and can actually say something both simple and profound about the human condition, then you will love Magnolia."
I:9343;174;And yet, through all of this there is a beacon of hope and redemption that shines through, and most of the characters do find the strength to carry on.
I:9343;175;Watching Magnolia is like having an entire lifetime's worth of powerful emotions crammed into a three hour movie.
I:9343;176;If you have an open mind, and an open heart, you must see this movie.
I:9343;177;It was a great copy of the movie and will always be a classic movie.
I:9343;178;Well, Magnolia will definitely entertain you, but it will also make you think and feel deeply.
I:9343;179;It is fiercely intelligent and unashamedly passionate.
I:9343;180;but it IS by far my favourite film of the 1990's.
I:9343;181;If one looks very carefully at one point in the crowd at the game show, a man even holds up a sign with the Biblical citation on it.
I:9343;182;When the sunshine don't work, the good Lord bring the rain in.
I:9343;183;Congratulations, Paul Thomas Anderson, for not dumbing down your film.
I:9343;184;Thank you, again, Paul, for enriching my sadly impoverished American mind.
I:9343;185;I really DO love American culture at its best.
I:9343;186;This film is one great example.
I:9343;187;it has more to say than you may think.)
I:9343;188;P. t. Anderson has written and directed a film that you either love or hate.
I:9343;189;For those who love this film are true fans of great movie making.
I:9343;190;It's very obvious that P. t. is one of the best directors as well as writers out there today and by making Magnolia he's on the top of my list.
I:9343;191;It's allot better then it sounds.
I:9343;192;Overall, I just have to agree with Roger Ebert and say: Magnolia is alive and free to surprise us.
I:9343;193;This is one of those rare intelligent, artistic movies that manages to deliver both entertainment and impact.
I:9343;194;With its large, magnificient cast, it spins a story of many people, both as individuals and as members of the society they belong in.
I:9343;195;There are so many threads in the movie, you'd almost expect it to disintegrate in some sections, but somehow it all holds together to form a beautiful mozaic.
I:9343;196;it's profound, entertaining, provoking and produced with zeal and talent.
I:9343;197;A great reflection of what life really is like.
I:9343;198;well homosexual, (g) a cocaine.
I:9343;199;Writer/Director Anderson must have a pretty awful view of this world of ours.
I:9343;200;It's more than one month I saw this film and I am still thinking of it.
I:9343;201;Part of its lyrical context, part of its splendid cast, part of its splendid screenplay.
I:9343;202;It's what a call a true movie.
I:9343;203;Magnolia is the latest film by P. t. Anderson,a director whose previous Boogie Nights was one of the most exciting pieces of American cinema to come around since Tarantino.
I:9343;204;the camera's 360 degree panning and frequent crosscutting unite the seemingly disparate stories and subtly reveals its theme as the character's connections to one another become clearer.

I:9343;211;my personal favorite scene is the one where the major protagonists quietly sing Aimee Mann's Wise Up ,a scene in lesser hands which would have come across as silly,is exhilarating as it triumphant in Anderson's power to create the unforgettable.
I:9343;212;the large cast is so well acted and has been nominated and won so many awards, that there is no need to single out anybody.
I:9343;213;known Melora Walters,whose performances in Boogie Nights and this film are so strong,we should be hearing more about her in the future.
I:9343;214;But the delivery of the monologues and the use of the soundtrack make this one of the best movies I've ever seen.
I:9343;215;Magnolia , P. t. Anderson's philisophical and imaginative follow up to Boogie Nights , is a daunting descent into realms of human emotion.
I:9343;216;All the actors in this film express the desire of the same kind .
I:9343;217;"While these actors subject their instincts into their character's drives and feelings, we begin to suspect that Anderson's creations are just metaphors for ourselves
I:9343;218;Anderson, inventive, subjective, morally and immorally, creates a world of truths and lies, and does so beautifully.
I:9343;219;Yes, I can see how some people like it.
I:9343;220;The best actor was the girl who was molested by her father.
I:9343;221;She is a wonderful actress and did a supurb job with her part.
I:9343;222;Magnolia is one of those movies that reminds one of the power of film.
I:9343;223;Director Paul Thomas Anderson masterfully weaves together the stories of several people, all interrelated, into one brilliantly orchestrated work.
I:9343;224;Every aspect of Magnolia adds tremendously to its ultimate design, from the cinematography to the music to the flawless cast.
I:9343;225;all the performances are right.
I:9343;226;Aimee Mann's songs also add further dimension.
I:9343;227;all, I give Magnolia my highest rating and recommendation.
I:9343;228;It is bold and beautiful.
I:9343;229;I agree that this film was the best film of 1999.
I:9343;230;Here is a tip for the film makers.your characters must be at least semi believable and potentially likable for an audience to care about the story you are trying to tell.

I:9343;235;Watch it at least for the ensemble cast (including Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Tom Cruise, Julianne Moore, Jason Robards, William H. Macy, etc. etc. etc.).
I:9343;236;Everyone did great, and the premise of colliding coincidences makes the movie unusual and entertaining.
I:9343;237;One of the best movies ever!
I:9343;238;The script is wonderful, characters are complex and well written and the acting is superb from every actor.
I:9343;239;This is a great cast with a great story (or should I say stories) to tell.
I:9343;240;This is a great movie.
I:9343;241;Doesn't the best sound, but works anyway.
I:9343;242;PTA is a master, a brilliant Director.
I:9343;243;The actors are on the top.
I:9343;244;Julianne Moore gives the best acting I ever seen.
I:9343;245;Aimee Mann did the perfect song that matching with the story.
I:9343;246;THe third release from director Paul Thomas anderson ( Boogie Night, Punch Drunk Love) is a classic as his other works.
I:9343;247;"This is a movie you have to watch when your REALLY awake it clocks in at over 3 hours
I:9343;248;More for the anthropologists to review in 3030 A. d. than enjoy as an evening's entertainment.
I:9343;249;I know that many people love this movie, but.
I:9343;250;Except one guy, who loved it.
I:9343;251;Magnolia is one of the best films ever made, period.
I:9343;252;I haven't enjoyed a movie so thoroughly the first time through, thought about it for months afterward, watched it again, and was even more astounded by it, ever.
I:9343;253;hour running time may turn off the audience members with cases of ADD, but for those of us who stick around, it's a filmmaking experience like no other, driven by the kinetic energy of a director whose sheer joy for the art gives every moment on the screen poignant meaning and visual grace.

I:9343;255;(She was robbed by Phil Collins at the Oscars) Yet, amongst all of the music from one of the world's most gifted musical artists, there are some of the finest screen performances of 1999.
I:9343;256;amphetamines, but she pulls it all off nicely, and Philip Seymour Hoffman always wins us over with his heartfelt performance as the nurse to the sickly Earl Partridge, played with devastating authenticity by the late great Jason Robards.
I:9343;257;And those are just my personal favorite characters.
I:9343;258;I'll say it again, this is one of the very best films I've ever seen, and working in a video store, I've seen a lot of movies.
I:9343;259;It's endlessly inventive, engaging, wonderful, heartwarming and breaking at the same time, with an endless supply of life being fed into it by one of the best directors since Scorsese.
I:9343;260;"And there's no shortage of ""actor"" moments with such a big cast, as each one seems to have their personal grandiose scene."
I:9343;261;oh yeah and I forgot to mention, I bought the New Line 2.
I:9343;262;but w/Magnolia, P. t. Anderson's masterpiece, I could not take my eyes away from the screen for a second.
I:9343;263;Aimee Mann's soundtrack is incredible.
I:9343;264;I got goosebumps and shivers up my spine.
I:9343;265;It was such an incredible moment in the film, probably one of my favorite moments in film.
I:9343;266;But the movie speaks for itself.
I:9343;267;For added fun, try to count all of the references to the numbers '8' and '2'.
I:9343;268;For even more fun, try and figure out what they mean.
I:9343;269;There are about ten characters who are prominent and Paul Thomas Anderson cleverly weaves their stories together over the course of the film.
I:9343;270;paul Thomas Anderson does a beautiful job writing and directing this film.
I:9343;271;The screenplay juggles each of his richly developed characters so that all of them seem convincing and powerful.
I:9343;272;This is only a minor quibble with another wise perfect film.
I:9343;273;After seeing the brilliantly entertaining 'Boogie Nights', what a dissapointing film.
I:9343;274;Yes it's spectacular, and yes good acting (Cruise a standout), but the film goes nowhere.
I:9343;275;Magnolia is one those rare films that I can watch over and over again and am always moved to tears by the final frame.
I:9343;276;This is filmmaking at its brilliant best.
I:9343;277;"the scenes that stand out and touch me the most are Julianne Moore's emotional ourburst at the pharmacy, William H. Macy's heart wrenching speech of having love to give but not knowing where to put it, the goosebump inducing musical interlude to Amy Mann's touching ""Wise Up"" and of course the frogs."
I:9343;278;everything about this film is perfect.
I:9343;279;THIS is what movie making is about, a film lovers dream.
I:9343;280;Top notch acting by a top notch cast, brilliant direction, excellent cinematography, an engaging plot and a perfect soundtrack.
I:9343;281;One my top ten all time favorite films.
I:9343;282;I would recommend turning up the volume on this movie.
I:9343;283;The soundtrack is great and the scenes are in perfect harmony with the score.
I:9343;284;Wonderful acting, especially by Cruise, his best performance to date.
I:9343;285;The theme of the movie is very relevant today .
I:9343;286;Nice work PTA, Im waiting for the next one.
I:9343;287;If you look at the cast list, you'll obviously see alot of exceptionally talented actors.
I:9343;288;And if you watch the film, you'll be shocked to see that nearly every one of them is also in their best role.
I:9343;289;The opening 5 minutes of the film is also one of the greatest openings i've ever seen.
I:9343;290;Did I mention that the middle and the End are also brilliant, It really is a great film.
I:9343;291;See it anyway, at over 3 hours, your bound to find something you like.
I:9343;292;such a mind bender great to watch in any state of mind definitely a re watch and tom cruise is great hahah
I:9343;293;"certainly an antecedent can be found in the work of robert altman, most notably his classic film ""short cuts."""
I:9343;294;all of the characters are bound irrevocably to some past transgression, a breach and moment of defiance that they have yet to lend closure to.
I:9343;295;also, it was given inspiration from a piece of medical history that it was once thought to be capable of assessing the general health of a town by examining its amphibian members.
I:9343;296;it is in this confidence and in this design that magnolia ascends to a true masterwork, and discerns itself as one of the defining moments in american film.
I:9343;297;a film bristling with an indefatigable vivacity and sense of life that under no condition compromises itself and presents one of the greatest most kinetic and kaleidoscopic visions of contemporary american life is deserving of my utmost reverence.
I:9343;298;I'm a huge fan of P. t Anderson so going in I was expecting a very good movie.
I:9343;299;What I got was a masterpiece a cinematic experience like no other i've seen.
I:9343;300;However for those of you who have never seen P. t Anderson's work I suggest you watch Hard Eight and/or Boogie Nights first and if you like them i'm sure you will like this.
I:9343;301;I suppose this is the kind of movie one either completely loves, or wholeheartedly loathes.
I:9343;302;I saw it in the theater, and I came out unimpressed.
I:9343;303;this movie was good in parts, excellent in others.
I:9343;304;"Regardless of what you think about the actual story, the acting is superb
I:9343;305;The beauty of this film is that it will never be made again.
I:9343;306;The story becomes something worth more than the sum of it's parts, because in this intersection we see something of humanity and more about life.
I:9343;307;Life itself is a series of middles and connections and interactions, where often things remained unresolved and we avoid things, and are put on by things, and forced into things, etc. normally such a high.
I:9343;308;But it did here and it did beautifully due to the magnificent acting of the characters and the amazing strength of the writing.
I:9343;309;It created powerful scenes, highly emotional and humanistic scenes of every gambit of emotion and every difficulty of life.
I:9343;310;The characters are each memorable.
I:9343;311;The film also has standout performances by Philip Baker Hall, Jason Robards, and Melora Walters.
I:9343;312;the soundtrack by Aimee Mann is wonderful.
I:9343;313;Anyone familiar with Anderson's films will see familiar faces and themes.
I:9343;314;And above all, enjoy this flowery film.
I:9343;315;As if Boogie Nights wasn't great enough, PT Anderson comes back with a film on the same scale with as much impact but touching on more facets of the human condition.
I:9343;316;this is a film about love, dysfunction and worlds colliding.
I:9343;317;this tapestry is so tightly woven it floats.
I:9343;318;Like the people colliding, the cameras directly collide with the people via zoom close ups.
I:9343;319;this film has the perfect ensemble cast.
I:9343;320;The PT Anderson acting troupe is my favorite.
I:9343;321;All the actors we are familiar with are great as usual.
I:9343;322;The guest actor, Tom Cruise, does his best work to date.
I:9343;323;My sole advice is to just see the film.
I:9343;324;This is one of my favorite films ever.
I:9343;325;It is a magnum opus, operatic masterpiece.
I:9343;326;This is the kind of movie that you watch many times and find something you didnt see before.
I:9343;327;Where a consummate vision, a ton o' luck, and the synchronicity with the Archetype arrive at the intersection at the same needy moment.
I:9343;328;Only years beyond now (like C. Kane, etc.), will our children's kids realize the genius that Anderson's gesamtkunstwerk was in 1999. '
I:9343;329;"There Will Be Blood has its icy greatness, sure, but ""Magnolia""'s superior power balances upon a knife edge of so cold/yet so warm."
I:9343;330;Magnolia is entertainment that makes me contemplate God.
I:9343;331;Not the most fulfilling moral in the world.
I:9343;332;All of the others had outstanding performances in incredible movies, yet Cruise didn't do a whole lot in this movie.
I:9343;333;I definitely do not recommend this film.
I:9343;334;Upon reading the wonderful reviews of many critics, I decided that this was a must see movie.
I:9343;335;The story line with the branching plots seemed to be an original and inventive way to create a movie.
I:9343;336;Those who have read Faulkner's A Light in August appreciate the stream of consiousness effect, an almost circular pattern of telling a story, with the work starting with one character, moving to others, and finally back to the beginning character to finish.
I:9343;337;the movie starts out going at a good pace, with each character being displayed and examined, giving the movie.
I:9343;338;This is in my top 5 favorite movies ever, and you learn all sorts of new, amazing things every time you watch it.
I:9343;339;"I just wanted to note that I went and saw the movie ""Crash"" this weekend in the theater, and it reminded me of Magnolia a great deal."
I:9343;340;It was a wonderful film, making you think in the same ways that Magnolia does.
I:9343;341;"I recommend anyone that loves Magnolia to go see ""Crash"" as well."
I:9343;342;Magnolia is an incredible array of humanity and human experience, a veritable banquet of sin and forgiveness, of coincidence and synchronicity, of broken dreams and cherished sorrows.
I:9343;343;It is a gripping masterpiece of a film, with astonishing performances (Tom Cruise is a long way from 'Jerry Macguire' in this flick.
I:9343;344;it's a disturbing and courageous performance), editing that moves the stories along with breathtaking fluidity, and a remarkable soundtrack that is a character in itself.
I:9343;345;All the characters have distinct and compellingly grim sagas to witness or to tell.
I:9343;346;for me, the clearest voice and the narrative thread of the piece comes from John C. Reilly's exquisite performance as the lonely, fragile cop, Jim Kurring.
I:9343;347;And, if the writer's point of the film is still missed by his audience, he highlights it with an awesome spectacle towards the end of the film, which may confuse some people even more.
I:9343;348;just see this monumental testimony to The Human Community.
I:9343;349;Kudos to the brilliant Paul Thomas Anderson.
I:9343;350;truly one of the most remarkable and poignant segments in recent cinema history).
I:9343;351;This theme is magnificently unfolded in the finest first 20 minutes of exposition of any film, anytime, with a soundtrack which is also perfectly synchronous (I can't think of a play or opera that does a better job, in fact).
I:9343;352;It has been reported by several sources that he really is not long for this world, which would deprive the stage of one it's great interpreters of O'Neill, in particular.
I:9343;353;The acting is uniformly great.
I:9343;354;Nilsson had some cute moments, and background voices near the end of One rhyme `divided' with `they finally decided' the one thing for certain brings down the curtain because nothing keeps them together.
I:9343;355;It was like a long parade of victims, all of them somehow wronged by the world, by birth, by people, by drugs, by themselves.
I:9343;356;if you enjoy seeing movies and being disappointed, if Radiohead's lyrics REALLY appeal to you, you'll like the film.
I:9343;357;It is a story of forgiveness and relationships among people.
I:9343;358;Wonderful cinematogrpahy, screenplay, and acting.
I:9343;359;Tom Cruise stands out as a wacky character with his best acting to date.
I:9343;360;He was nominated for an Oscar, and truly deserved to win it.
I:9343;361;The lives of these people and others form a beautiful web of connections.
I:9343;362;And I'm only 16 years old, but this movie held my interest for the whole time.
I:9343;363;The best performance in the movie is by Philip Baker Hall, who plays Jimmy Gator, a game show host who's trying to patch things up with his daughter before he dies.
I:9343;364;Tom Cruise as Frank TJ Mackey is excellent as well, and John C. Reilly gives a very emotional performance as Jim Kurring, a police office in love with a coke addict.
I:9343;365;The great thing about this movie is how all of the 9 main characters are connected in some way.
I:9343;366;Paul Thomas Anderson is truly a genius: first Hard Eight, then Boogie Nights, and now Magnolia.
I:9343;367;This movie is absolutely perfect.
I:9343;368;I had high expectations going into this film because I enjoyed Paul Thomas Anderson's last effort in 1997's Boogie Nights .
I:9343;369;nominated performance of Tom Cruise.
I:9343;370;It is only during his scenes that the movie comes alive.
I:9343;371;male convention are the best.
I:9343;372;I love that the director put so much effort into the film and wasn't shy about puting his feelings into his characters.
I:9343;373;It makes me very happy that there are people like him making films, something to look forward to.
I:9343;374;I'll just tell you some good stuff to make you look forward to the movie.
I:9343;375;"He has my favorite line in the movie ""i have some much love to give, i just don't know where to put it""."
I:9343;376;Tom Cruise is also good as the woman hating macho man.
I:9343;377;My favorite story centers around a lonely cop who seems like the nicest guy in the world.
I:9343;378;There is a lot more great stuff too.
I:9343;379;I'd heard a little bit about it: Critics generally loved it, and one friend of mine whose opinion I respect said I absolutely HAD to see it.
I:9343;380;So I take it home and start watching .
I:9343;381;and suddenly I'm completely swept up by one of the most remarkable and sublime movies I've seen in a long time.
I:9343;382;Philip Seymour Hoffman is IMMENSELY likeable as a sensitive hospice care worker.
I:9343;383;"The direction, by ""Boogie Nights'"" Paul Thomas Anderson, is inspired if occasionally frenetic."
I:9343;384;Please give this movie a chance, because once you start watching, you will be sucked into it, and your jaw may occasionally drop, and you may occasionally laugh, and you will most definitely reach for the Kleenex.
I:9343;385;Overall this movie packs a SEVERE emotional wallop, and personally it seems I watched it at exactly the right time in my life.
I:9343;386;"All I can suggest is that if you can pick a gloomy, rainy Sunday afternoon to curl up on the couch and immerse yourself in ""Magnolia,"" I'm quite confident you'll be glad you did."
I:9343;387;help sex speaker is wonderful, but his piercing stare and proselytizing rants cannot redeem the drivel surrounding it.
I:9343;388;*2 Days In The Valley* is much better done as a shared experience movie, and Kieslowski's *Three Colors* trilogy is a far more insightful look into the human spirit.
I:9343;389;This is a wonderful film in the spirit of Robert Altman's Nashville and Short Cuts.
I:9343;390;This is Writer/Director PT Anderson's third film and the best yet.
I:9343;391;(He also wrote/directed Hard Eight (Sydney), and Boogie Nights).
I:9343;392;Tom Cruise gives an exceptional performance as Trevor Mackey, a sex tape guru who was abondened by his father when his mother was dying of cancer.
I:9343;393;hoffman in another wonderful performance.
I:9343;394;PT Anderson is the master of swirling camera's and has a visual style all his own.
I:9343;395;This film was the best film of 1999 and is my personal favorite film ever.
I:9343;396;But i say go see it, thingIt's the [best] you ever saw .
I:9343;397;I tuned into this movie primarily because I'd heard lots of good things about Tom Cruise's performance.
I:9343;398;This film should have been up for a lot of Oscars, including best picture, and not just Cruise's performance.
I:9343;399;There are many wonderful performances in this film since there is no lead role.
I:9343;400;This gives everyone a chance to dig in and give it his or her all.
I:9343;401;It reminds me of Robert Altman's Short Cuts but I felt this film was even more artfully done than that one.
I:9343;402;This fits since Magnolia is the name of an intersection in the San Fernando Valley where the movie is set.
I:9343;403;Somehow he's come to believe that the most vital thing is to set oneself up as the one with the power right from the start.
I:9343;404;director Anderson is a talent I am going to keep my eye on, you can bet.
I:9343;405;Next movie of his, I'll be there.
I:9343;406;The beautiful music, directing, and cinematography do not make up for the lack of ANYTHING WORTHWHILE gained from this film.
I:9343;407;with all of the star power and otherwise good directing, why does Paul Thomas Anderson make such terrible movies?
I:9343;408;One of the things I tell people who haven't seen this movie yet is to keep an open mind.
I:9343;409;It makes you think and it makes you feel something almost indescribable.
I:9343;410;You have to look deep within the picture, listen deep between the lines and dialogue and you will know and feel what each character knows and feels.
I:9343;411;It's about real people who experienced real ordeals and found their own way (whether good or bad) to deal with what they experienced.
I:9343;412;Kudos to P. t. for a wonderful film that touched me so much.
I:9343;413;Wonderful actors in wonderful performances.
I:9343;414;A study on human relations.
I:9343;415;It is kind of like a mosaic, where a lot of interrelated characters and intertwined stories keep our interest, keep us waiting to see how it will all connect and how all the story threads will be tied together.
I:9343;416;The mosaic, flower petal structure is kind of like the Oscar winning Crash.
I:9343;417;quiz Kid Donnie Smith: That's right.
I:9343;418;Paul Thomas Anderson is a very ambitious director, and one wonders how he seemingly went from grip to auteur overnight.
I:9343;419;He has absorbed so much film history that you would almost think he was just a copycat but he always uses what he has learned in a very creative and original way.
I:9343;420;He likes to work with an ensemble of actors, and in that he is like Robert Altman, the Coen Brothers, or even Will Ferrell, and indeed lots of his regulars are also shared with those directors.
I:9343;421;Really great performances from Magnolia's ensemble cast, and a really compelling vision from director Paul Thomas Anderson.
I:9343;422;A really long movie, but one that held my interest throughout.
I:9343;423;Happy Jack MulraneyThe Good Girl (2002) .
I:9343;424;thurston Howell: Stay that way.
I:9343;425;American Beauty was excellent, but Magnolia was the Best Movie of the year.
I:9343;426;With its complex story, Incredible acting, and awesome filmwork and direction, Paul Thomas Anderson PROVES that he is the next Great film director.
I:9343;427;Julianne Moore was also amazing, with Philip Seymore Hoffman, Jeremey Blackman, Phillip Baker Hall, Jason Robards, and Melora Walters doing superb as well.
I:9343;428;Though many would complain about the length, this is a movie that is exciting through every single minute, and if a minute is lost, that's how lost the movie would be at the end.
I:9343;429;The themes are really deep, but that's why the movie is amazing.
I:9343;430;And through the twists of fate, the characters all end up accomplaishing there goals or something, by the end.
I:9343;431;In the opening scenes of 'Magnolia' PT Anderson goes a great length in setting up the premise that the implausible is certainly not impossible.
I:9343;432;power guru who has the chance to watch his estranged father dying.
I:9343;433;All these stories and more are told masterfully.
I:9343;434;Anderson will show you that he has what it takes to convey such vivid emotions across the screen.
I:9343;435;It exudes arrogance and for once you remember as an average moviegoer you are at the mercy of the director.
I:9343;436;PT Anderson has certainly mastered the art of film.
I:9343;437;When a movie captures your very being for an hour or more and leaves you detached from the rest of humanity during that entire period, it's rare gem.
I:9343;438;You recover from the absorbing experience, reach for your first hand of popcorn and realize the gravity of the loss of a fine actor .
I:9343;439;The writing in this movie even made Tom Cruise seem brilliant, and his speeches in this movie are full of character, they flat out rock.
I:9343;440;get this movie buddy.5 stars/5The bottom line is this movie is a great insight into the human mind.
I:9343;441;This movie is also very metaphorical in its own respects and keeps you wondering what's going to happen next.
I:9343;442;Definitely a must see movie!!
I:9343;443;intellects out there who see something deep and apocolyptic in this film.
I:9343;444;the great climax has power only in its ability to turn ones's stomach.
I:9343;445;Some critics were angry or baffled at this but, i thought it was brilliant.
I:9343;446;The perfect touch to a perfect movie with incredible acting, story telling and music all combined to make a modern classic.
I:9343;447;"I recommend this movie to anyone who is breathing and has love in their heart.9/10 ""And the book says ""We may be through with the past but, the past ain't through with us"""""
I:9343;448;Very moving, sometimes darkly disturbing film.
I:9343;449;It is a real thought provoker.
I:9343;450;it ranks right up there with some of my favorites such as Gandhi, Reds, Dances with Wolves .
I:9343;451;a real epic with absolutely wonderful performances by all.
I:9343;452;Some do a decent job while movies like this do it in an untasteful way.
I:9343;453;It's one of those films that are really innovative and people like it because its idea.
I:9343;454;Movies are for entertainment, and this one was not a good one.
I:9343;455;I found this movie to be all that a moive should be.
I:9343;456;It was creative, easy to follow, and got more and more interesting as the movie went on.
I:9343;457;The singing in the middle of the movie and the surprise at the end are the elements that make this movie stand stand alone as a mountian of entertainment.
I:9343;458;john C. Reilly's performance in this movie is one of the greatest, most thoughtful and most underrated.
I:9343;459;In fact, I think it's his best performance to date (since he seems to pretty much be playing his own slimy self).
I:9343;460;He is one of the few true geniuses we have working in Hollywood.
I:9343;461;A very ambitious film, but a film so ambitious needs to have a point.
I:9343;462;P. t. Anderson's 1999 film MAGNOLIA is one heck of an ensemble drama.
I:9343;463;The great theme of MAGNOLIA is the sins of the fathers visited upon their children.
I:9343;464;mAGNOLIA is a powerful film.
I:9343;465;There is a fine screenplay, often praiseworthy acting, impressive cinematography, and a great soundtrack by Aimee Mann.
I:9343;466;historical tales of amazing coincidences, is entertaining enough, but it could have easily been cut without affecting the main of the film.
I:9343;467;if you are a fan of the film, the two.
I:9343;468;disc edition is well worth getting.
I:9343;469;"The extra Frank ""T. j."" Mackey material is hilarious, and the making."
I:9343;470;Magnolia is a long sad movie about walking wounded and human fragility featuring intricate plotting (an interwoven set of storylines from a large cast that's been compared to Altman) excellent acting (Anderson's cokeheads all always REALLY coked out) relevant topics (The Men's Movement whose importance I predict will unfold across decades is finally addressed in Tom Cruise's star turn as a charismatic misogynist), sweetly melancholic music (which rekindled Aimee Mann's career), and a sure directorial hand.
I:9343;471;It's one of the most arresting sequences in recent cinema.
I:9343;472;The audio was good also, but most of the sound came from the front, left, and right speakers.
I:9343;473;There are films we watch to forget about life, then there are films we watch to learn about life.
I:9343;474;It is a character journey depicting the interconnectedness and randomness of organized chaos which actually brings everything together as by some divine force.
I:9343;475;These are all questions posed by the brilliant P. t. Anderson and his incredible cast.
I:9343;476;It also makes for a very real film.
I:9343;477;magnolia is one very smart film.
I:9343;478;It is filled with themes of redemption, courage, freak accidents, and God.
I:9343;479;He knows we are smart, capable people and leaves it all up for our own interpretation.
I:9343;480;On the suplemental disk is an interesting documentary about the making of Magnolia that offers much insight into PT Anderson and the way he works.
I:9343;481;This is a story of faith, and of the the value of empathy and good works.
I:9343;482;"The divine intervention and ""deus ex machina"" at the end of the film may be controversial, but it makes the point brilliantly."
I:9343;483;is that of the nurse and cop who have the gift of empathy and the ability to see and to bring out the best in people.
I:9343;484;the seemingly disconnected stories come together in a brilliant and compelling way.
I:9343;485;tom Cruise is surprisingly good in his role as the huckster son.
I:9343;486;Julianne Moore proves why she is one of our finest actresses.
I:9343;487;And then you have wonderful actors like Jason Robards and William Macy in supporting roles.
I:9343;488;"Like ""The Shawshank Redemption"" it was a bomb in the theaters but will be seen in future years as one of the great films of the decade."
I:9343;489;With Magnolia , Paul Thomas Anderson was filmed a broad canvas, with a number of intertwining stories in Los Angeles .
I:9343;490;He elicits superb performances from all his actors with the standouts being Julianne Moore as the gold.
I:9343;491;However the best performance comes from the always excellent William H. Macy .
I:9343;492;After his excellent Boogie Nights , he has progressed with a scintillating work of genius that will have a certain Mr Altman proudly acknowledging his true heir.
I:9343;493;the second hour saw the important decisions these people made.
I:9343;494;The heavyweight character actors executed their parts beautifully and the shots were well.
I:9343;495;sequenced, successfully building up an atmosphere of urgency, I found Julianne Moore at the pharmacy store a mesmerizing performance.
I:9343;496;She was so beautiful yet cold, quiet yet restless, until her sudden outburst of spitting venom bespoke her guilt.
I:9343;497;there is just a fine line between stories of clich s. pretensions and sincerity.
I:9343;498;At least this movie can be given the benefit of the doubt of being original and it displayed sincerity as well as good directing.
I:9343;499;Yes, the movie can be slow at some point but it had its gripping moments.
I:9343;500;But i did, and it was one of the top best decisions i've made this year so far.
I:9343;501;With the movie's brilliant variety of characters, you will find someone to relate to in this movie.
I:9343;502;Magnolia has such an eerie, breathtaking way of making you feel at home.
I:9343;503;the superb ensemble cast, including Julianne Moore, Melora Waters, Tom Cruise, and Jason Robards among others, makes this movie, along with Anderson's interesting direction.
I:9343;504;Julianne Moore's character comes closer and closer to the brink, Tom Cruise's sex.
I:9343;505;kid, gives a great performance as a character you can't help but sympathize with.
I:9343;506;all these conflicts and intersections are finally brought together with an act of Biblical proportions that truly displays the uniqueness and innovation of P. t. Anderson and his directing.
I:9343;507;And in the words of Stanley, This is something that happens.
I:9343;508;While not all of the characters find happy endings, Anderson makes a genuine effort to try to make sure they all find something they've wanted (whether consciously or subconsciously) at least.
I:9343;509;I expect a lot more from Anderson in the future, and he just might deliver.
I:9343;510;MAGNOLIAPaul Thomas Anderson made a small, thoughtful film a few years back, the film Hard Eight (which he calls Sydney) is an earnest little movie that introduced his fluid camera work and ear for dialogue to an world still charged with a Tarantino need for quick words, quick violence all wrapped in a shimmery, ultra.
I:9343;511;But we stayed with it, rode it out, and loved the outcome.
I:9343;512;i loved the film on several levels.
I:9343;513;it gets better every time you see it.
I:9343;514;the documentary, MAGNOLIA DIARY, is worth the price of admission alone.
I:9343;515;Can't wait to see the next one (it'll probably be two days long, but I'll probably love it all the same).
I:9343;516;MAGNOLIA is a masterful piece of filmmaking.
I:9343;517;times justify great films .
I:9343;518;a satisfying gift is as good as the package from whence it was wrapped.
I:9343;519;This is true of GONE WITH THE WIND and although a film like CITIZEN KANE doesn't reach this drastic time length, there are certainly similarities between these films listed in regards to MAGNOLIA .
I:9343;520;"they are bold examples of filmmaking
I:9343;521;from what I've seen in BOOGIE NIGHTS and MAGNOLIA, PT Anderson is a man who loves CA and Los Angeles to which these films undoubtedly pay homage.
I:9343;522;Paul is giving us films that are fun to watch .
I:9343;523;production technique strikingly similar to the Golden.
I:9343;524;as far as the performances are concerned, PT consistently uses a cast that works well for him (HARD 8, BOOGIE AND MAGNOLIA) and a fresh bunch of actors for PT's direction that give meaning to the label 'tour.
I:9343;525;And a 'boy genius' played by a virtual 'boy genius' is something very touching in newcomer Blackman who as well as similar young children, may be facing some of the same struggles as Stanley Spector.
I:9343;526;heightened realism for our age (ex.
I:9343;527;'Silence of the Lambs' winning a Best Picture Oscar).
I:9343;528;There's something in this film for anyone who loves good cinema.
I:9343;529;Like anything people can create, opinions will vary and it's nice to have that choice of being able to like what you want and pursue your specific interests since there's so much material and picks to choose from.
I:9343;530;Such was the case with Magnolia which I found on first viewing to be incredibly self.
I:9343;531;indulgent and seemed as if it wanted to do anything it can so that people can see what a complex and ambitious work it was.
I:9343;532;the film has a wide assortment of characters with the key being that they all intersect and through association, know each other.
I:9343;533;magnolia I think is one of those kind of films where there's just a genuine spunk of energy and spontaneity that even if you didn't like it, you had to admit there's a lot of passion to make it work and everyone gives it their all.
I:9343;534;solid performances all around from Cruise (yes, I said him: forget the crazy antics, when he wants, he CAN act) to the Reilly/Walters story to the confidence in the writing and directing, it's a film I can certainly appreciate.
I:9343;535;From the characters to even the pacing and several memorable moments, there's always something that'll click.
I:9343;536;minded filmmaking to the Matrix and its visuals, Magnolia fits right in.
I:9343;537;hour film, but Magnolia's fascinating plot and eccentric characters captured me.
I:9343;538;There are other stories in the film.
I:9343;539;This is a rather touching film that should have gotten more recognition.
I:9343;540;Believe me, it's worth it.
I:9343;541;This is one of the very few movies that I felt a deep emotional connection to upon watching.
I:9343;542;Magnolia is truly a remarkable piece of artwork, and a must.
I:9343;543;see film for any movie lover.
I:9343;544;certainly one of 1999's best and most misunderstood films, magnolia is not for everyone.
I:9343;545;it is most certainly an arty film, and a dificult and sad one to watch, but is most worthwhile.
I:9343;546;ooh and the extra stuff on the second disk is very good.
I:9343;547;a wildly overpraised movie that will leave you with an intense headache from its length and volume as well as three hours gone from your life.
I:9343;548;thread story in this film about life and the strange turns it sometimes takes, and the connections that exist between its characters.
I:9343;549;A wonderful movie, a film buff's movie.
I:9343;550;In this sense, the movie is no more realistic than those sentimental films of the past, where everyone is a good decent person at heart, and the good guy always does well in the end .
I:9343;551;image will be applauded just as much as the original was.
I:9343;552;the movie features excellent performances (however, not Tom Cruise), good production, and powerful direction.
I:9343;553;One common consequence of one.
I:9343;554;Worst movie I ever seen.
I:9343;555;Better yet find 3 hours of something better to do.
I:9343;556;Frequently refer to this as my favorite movie ever, it's more than just good it's one of the best modern movies ever made.
I:9343;557;This film provides an emotionally powerful character study of emotional trauma, naked pain, bitterness, forgiveness .
I:9343;558;The cast is simply outstanding, and Paul Thomas Anderson is a brilliant writer/director.
I:9343;559;tom Cruise gives arguably the best dramatic performance of his career, and as far as I'm concerned, was downright ROBBED of the 1999 Best Supporting Actor Oscar.
I:9343;560;"I suspect that the real reason he didn't win (and Michael Caine did for that cinematic snorefest ""The Cider House Rules"") is because Hollywood is just plain jealous of the guy: He's good."
I:9343;561;The Academy will probably make Cruise wait a while (like Steven Speilberg, Julia Roberts and Al Pacino had to wait) before bestowing Oscar gold upon him .
I:9343;562;crafted film with a good script and good acting but one of the best films of '99 and groundbreaking?
I:9343;563;Everyone from a genius kid on a quiz show to a TV.
I:9343;564;The first hour of the film is the best because it sets up all the conflict and introduces us to a handful of interesting characters.
I:9343;565;The acting is very good for a Hollywood film.
I:9343;566;If you want to see real family tragedy at it's best you should see clips of Jason Rubert Jr. performing Eugene O'Neill in the theater.
I:9343;567;I won't give away the ending but I thought it was very contrived and tried to be arty and symbolic without making a good film.
I:9343;568;Magnolia is by no means a bad film and I recommend watching it but I can't even begin to accept it is brilliant and groundbreaking.
I:9343;569;Boogie Nights still remains Paul Thomas Anderson's best work so far.
I:9343;570;earl (Jason Robards) is tragic and likeable enough.
I:9343;571;earl's wife (Julianne Moore) is gorgeous as ever, but her character again doesn't seem to affect the plot much.
I:9343;572;earl's male nurse (Philip Seymour Hoffman) gives one of the better performances of the film, and he is probably the most likeable and engaging character of them all.
I:9343;573;the Cop (John C Reilly) is convincing enough as the clumsy cop he plays and another likeable character, but again, as pointed out by Richard .
I:9343;574;stanley (Jeremy Blackman) puts in a fine performance as the young prodigy forced into the limelight, and is another likeable character.
I:9343;575;kid Donnie Smith (William H Macy) is strangely likeable even through his irritating self.
I:9343;576;providing one the films twists near the end, and is well played.
I:9343;577;all the actors actual performances AS their characters are very good, as are the direction, score and screenplay.
I:9343;578;the film does of course, have many good points, including, as mentioned, it's introduction and it's score.
I:9343;579;PT Anderson is a great director.
I:9343;580;when i first watched it i felt as though there was a little part of me in every charcter of the film and that's what got me so emotially attached to it and why i loved it so much.
I:9343;581;i was really impressed with Cruise's part in the film.
I:9343;582;he did a really great job of acting like the egotistic male then being complealty sensitive on the inside.
I:9343;583;After all, it won a lot of awards.
I:9343;584;a very dark yet magnificent movie.
I:9343;585;all the symbolism makes this movie the best one yet.
I:9343;586;Very powerfull movie with lots of meanings.
I:9343;587;I give two thumbs up to the director also for being able to bring this stories together and making them whole.
I:9343;588;Definitely a must see if u like movies that are odd yet make sense.
I:9343;589;Magnolia is an interesting film.
I:9343;590;It is littered with colorful characters, and each has a story to tell.
I:9343;591;As I said to a friend, Magnolia would be wonderful if it was cut in half and made into two seperate films.
I:9343;592;And believe me, this movie has many strong characters and actors.
I:9343;593;The only character I could connect with was Tom Cruise's, because Cruise gave easily the best performance of his career.
I:9343;594;So, take the advice, P. t., keep writing these interesting characters but please please keep the time to two hours or less.
I:9343;595;Skip this one and go do something worthwhile.
I:9343;596;MAGNOLIA is one amazing film.
I:9343;597;it is quite bizzare and you really have to pay attention.
I:9343;598;it has a great cast and was one of the best films i have seen in a long time.
I:9343;599;the other features were ok but the movie is the real prize.
I:9343;600;He changed my life by making this exquisite, beautiful epic of eleven interwoven, powerful, and stunning characters.
I:9343;601;What I will speak about though are the characters.
I:9343;602;What made this film so exceptional was that the characters ARE life.
I:9343;603;They all experience emotion that we, the audience, as normal people, relate to becuase we feel the same emotions.
I:9343;604;melora Walters was so honest as Claudia.
I:9343;605;Julianne Moore (my favorite actress) proved once again that she can take on any role given her (this is probably my favorite performance from her).
I:9343;606;He is surely one of the most honest and controversial filmmakers today, and I can only hope that his career blossoms with Magnolia, definitely his best film to date.
I:9343;607;p. t. a. has courage to show us what life is, and for that he should be commended.
I:9343;608;It is now my goal to make films, because of the beauty of this one, and Magnolia is surely not only my favorite film, but also the one closest to my heart.
I:9343;609;top performances call more attention to the fact that the viewer is watching a movie .
I:9343;610;one amazing thing about this film is how the score enters and simply does not know when to stop.
I:9343;611;In giving the film two stars instead of one, I found a couple storylines interesting.
I:9343;612;The interview and gradual breakdown Cruise shows is believable.
I:9343;613;important monologues and camerawork that aspires to Kubrick and Scorsese, I will watch the real archetypes at work in the future.
I:9343;614;Thanks to everyone who's been writing reviews.
I:9343;615;What a powerful, powerful film.
I:9343;616;If you haven't seen it yet, hold on, give it time, stay with it.
I:9343;617;The connections of characters, themes, cuts, and music are all perfect.
I:9343;618;egypt certainly clinched that image.
I:9343;619;like Leonard Cohen's powerful song Future .
I:9343;620;"character told guys to lie about to women but the policeman is sincere
I:9343;621;It has been vastly UNDERrated!
I:9343;622;The cuts, the characters, the music, the themes: Get it right for yourself and give a hand to those around you.
I:9343;623;"Just know, this movie is worth your time
I:9343;624;it's modern poetry, beginning with the title.
I:9343;625;He is right though, you do need brains to watch and understand this movie.
I:9343;626;I thirst for more, enlighten me again Mr. Anderson.
I:9343;627;Life is dark and beautiful at the same time, don't you think?
I:9343;628;Paul Thomas Anderson's sweeping, biblical film is too epic for its own good.
I:9343;629;Every scene is overflowing with emotion, and it becomes exhausting to watch after the first two hours.
I:9343;630;The film is very self.
I:9343;631;indulgent, and it could win the award for the most hubristic piece of cinema I've ever seen.
I:9343;632;It's all in their, every theme you could ever want.
I:9343;633;On the better side, the acting is fabulous.
I:9343;634;It found it to move rather fast.
I:9343;635;Magnolia is one of those films that we're told is 'important,' so you see it.
I:9343;636;Fun in the sense that I enjoyed bouncing from one interesting character to the next, wondering when I'd get to go back to another character and see where they are in the grand scheme of things.
I:9343;637;the performances are very good, with a lot of Anderson's regulars here.
I:9343;638;Each character is well developed and enjoyable.
I:9343;639;The film is a bit long but nevertheless enjoyable.
I:9343;640;"Tom Cruise is wonderful as the smarmy ""seduce and destroy"" seminar leader, until the deathbed scene near the end, when he goes right over the top, wailing and flailing."
I:9343;641;i keepreading that 'Cruise steals the show' that is a lot of .
I:9343;642;The length is good for this type of movie.
I:9343;643;it is brilliant, i am actually writing this as i am watching it for the second time.
I:9343;644;For most other movies you always feel this 'great sensation' of suspense at the very end of the movie.
I:9343;645;so those are just a few things i thought i should share.
I:9343;646;It is a near masterpiece.
I:9343;647;Cruise manages to shine, delivering an energetic and overall excellent performance.
I:9343;648;And be weary of all the great reviews.
I:9343;649;Can the world really be this messed up .
I:9343;650;People are very good about not revealing much about it, as it is an indescribable piece of work.
I:9343;651;I responded to this film unlike I have responded to anything in a long time.
I:9343;652;from reading the reviews before me, I can certainly see that this is a work that begs for opinion.
I:9343;653;we take a beating), cancer, the foibles of humanity.
I:9343;654;Anderson jumps around his world, makes up rules, breaks them.
I:9343;655;He puts the unconventionality in your faCE, and lets you know that your life watching this film is going to go on the same ride that the characters go on.
I:9343;656;I think Cruise is excellent.
I:9343;657;John Reilly is fabulous as well.
I:9343;658;Well, let's face it, this is a wonder cast.
I:9343;659;one possible drawback There is one great moment in the documentary where Phillip Baker Hall is lamenting the use of the f. word so much, and that certainly is a quandry.
I:9343;660;I think this is one of the most original, challenging pieces I have ever seen.
I:9343;661;You will love it, or hate it.
I:9343;662;i love the Wise Up section.
I:9343;663;after all, this was such a highly acclaimed film that I owed it to myself to give it every change possible.
I:9343;664;"Whoever knows he is deep, strives for clarity
I:9343;665;combined with outstanding acting .
I:9343;666;particularly from Tom Cruise and Phillip Seymour Hoffman, snappy dialogue and wonderful directing, Magnolia is a film that speaks to your heart.
I:9343;667;But PT Anderson creates engaging scenes and dialogue (watch Henry Gibson at the bar) and pulls you all over the place.
I:9343;668;it's possible to be a fan of Altman and enjoy this movie.
I:9343;669;Watch it, then go check out Hard Eight and Boogie Nights and watch for the same camera tricks PT Anderson has been using since his first film.
I:9343;670;There have been many terrific reviews written by other Amazon members that go into great detail about why this film was fabulous or why it worked or didn't.
I:9343;671;Magnolia is a near masterpiece.
I:9343;672;to the decision to keep super star Tom Cruise's name in the background .
I:9343;673;"Now that I've seen ""Magnolia"" on video and have finally been able to philosophically, intellectually and logically string together its elements, there is no doubt that this is a wonderful accomplishment on film."
I:9343;674;Magnolia takes you on a journey whereby a master story teller challenges you to hang onto a breathtaking ride of images, content and music, and find the thread that strings everything, including the last 20 minutes.
I:9343;675;"But it's also worth ""previewing."""
I:9343;676;I guarantee you will enjoy it.
I:9343;677;The acting, the story, the dialogue are consistently mesmerizing.
I:9343;678;it's 99 7/8ths the work of a young master.
I:9343;679;Magnolia Should have won an Oscar like Crash.
I:9343;680;but the real great movie was Magnolia and timing is everything.
I:9343;681;provocative Performances from everybody in it.
I:9343;682;The cast list reads like a Who's Who of contemporary character actors, each pitch perfect in their role.
I:9343;683;The direction and cinematography are obsessive in detail.
I:9343;684;it is a challenge to its audience's aesthetic expectations and their humanity.
I:9343;685;Those that meet the challenge, who are willing to forgive Anderson's pretensions, as his characters ultimately forgive each other's, are rewarded with one of the most emotionally involving and wrenching films of this or any age.
I:9343;686;Full of revelations, this movie is a complex study of the human psyche.
I:9343;687;A self proclaimed womanizer, a gold.
I:9343;688;You can understand and empathize with their lives.
I:9343;689;It allows you to understand what compels people to make the choices they do, while taking little pity on them.
I:9343;690;It gives you a behind the facade look at characters that film rarely portrays.
I:9343;691;He lets you make your own associations at your own pace.
I:9343;692;Three times in the movie he links all of the characters together.
I:9343;693;1) Through watching a popular television show.
I:9343;694;2) Through singing a popular song.
I:9343;695;On a deeper level it reminds us that we are all connected just by being humans on the earth.
I:9343;696;It brings them back into reality, reminds them we live in an unsure world and you don't always know what is going to happen next.
I:9343;697;You can watch this movie time and time again each time taking away a new meaning and a new level of understanding.
I:9343;698;In the end, I was quite impressed with its boldness and emotional power.
I:9343;699;It was a very good film.
I:9343;700;From the first frame it struck me as daring, vivid and unconventional.
I:9343;701;But I was still captivated by what I was watching.
I:9343;702;Every actor fit his or her part perfectly.
I:9343;703;I saw a film that had a genuine message and took risks in order to convey that message in the most effective way.
I:9343;704;But this scene, while admittedly fantastic, worked.
I:9343;705;Another message I saw is that we must challenge ourselves to be honest, open and forgiving.
I:9343;706;But by the same token, I saw each character show genuine happiness and contentment as well.
I:9343;707;I understood this to be an expression of how we all have happiness and sadness, and the best way to find peace and love is to be yourself.
I:9343;708;And if you are fascinated by the human condition and life in general, and if you find bad situations slightly humorous on some level, then you will love this movie.
I:9343;709;It is also one of the finest castings of Tom Cruise that I've ever seen.
I:9343;710;it is the best movie I have ever seen.
I:9343;711;he should have won the Oscar.
I:9343;712;John C. Reilly was great.
I:9343;713;Movies lacked originality, message, and art.
I:9343;714;magnolia is one of the new breed of movies that tells a story with thought, grace, beauty, and sincerity.
I:9343;715;Along with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Traffic, I am proud to be a movie.
I:9343;716;tell the movie industry that the public will reward them for a brilliant, creative product.
I:9343;717;It is refreshing to see him play a guy with some issues and a pretty crazy profession.
I:9343;718;When will I learn?This movie is fantastic!
I:9343;719;Incredibly complex, yet it all fits together.
I:9343;720;Paul Thomas Anderson is a brilliant director (and scriptwriter.)
I:9343;721;worthy performances, most notably Julianne Moore and Melora Walters.
I:9343;722;(The frog scene on the other hand was great!)
I:9343;723;So many things seem to be happening at once and watching it is very intense.
I:9343;724;it only stands to reason that such an ambitious movie production would of course take on ambitious subjects of the human condition.
I:9343;725;It opens showing a series of humorous events, supposedly true, about strange coincidences and unexpected connections between people.
I:9343;726;The whole movie expands on this theme, with a large ensemble of characters are unexpectedly linked in various ways.
I:9343;727;As we follow the characters on one particular day, we explore how hate and insensitivity cultivates itself, what it means to be in love, what it means to be human, and how small compassionate acts can extinguish hate and lead to redemption.
I:9343;728;The movie is more of a stunt show showing these ideas in rapid fire action, rather than contemplating them.
I:9343;729;This is a movie that prefers to yell rather than whisper, but succeeds because of its creativity, ambition, and fearless risk taking with the material.
I:9343;730;Great move, performances and intrigue!
I:9343;731;I also watch this at least once a year.
I:9343;732;Love moves that depict unique interconnections.
I:9343;733;Tom Cruise is great, William H. Macy is great.
I:9343;734;It's great weakness is the ending.
I:9343;735;Something greater is at work here connecting people's lives together.
I:9343;736;Audiences and critics alike see that the film lasts over 3 hours and think, Oh wow, a 3 hour movie, that's gotta be good.
I:9343;737;There has to be a lot in it for it to last 3 hours!
I:9343;738;The performances are so over.
I:9343;739;Avoid this movie at all costs.
I:9343;740;Fans of Hollywood endings and/or happy flicks probably would not be a fan of this beautiful movie.
I:9343;741;Many critics comment on the length of the film (3hours) but I believe every moment is vital.
I:9343;742;The mood of the story is somber but there are many funny moments throughout Magnolia.
I:9343;743;Tom Cruise is amazing and provides much of the comic relief in the beginning of the film.
I:9343;744;I watched this film numerous times (a sign of a good movie) and it gets better each time.
I:9343;745;Fans of intelligent cinema will enjoy this gem.
I:9343;746;I was first introduced to PTA via Boogie Nights.
I:9343;747;If you liked that film, you should love Magnolia.
I:9343;748;Paul Thomas Anderson (fans call him PTA) sees life through the eyes of a film.
I:9343;749;He gets his actors to act in ways you never thought they could.
I:9343;750;he gives them lines and films them in ways that draw you into their lives.
I:9343;751;Yes, it's a morality play at a time when we need morality plays.
I:9343;752;There is a right and a wrong, and strange things happen, but there is justice, and peace, and love after the rain of frogs.
I:9343;753;magnolia itself is a rain of frogs, and nothing will ever be the same for you once you've succumbed to this beautiful, disturbing storm of emotions.
I:9343;754;it's an amazing piece of work and has stayed with me all the this week since i saw it.
I:9343;755;it resonates on so many levels, lonliness, realization, family relationships.
I:9343;756;aimee mann's music fits so well into the film, you aren't even surprised when the characters start singing halfway through the movie.
I:9343;757;crafted, meandering and beautiful film.
I:9343;758;never a strong actor to begin with, he almost manages to wring a believable performance out of the script, when he's clearly outgunned by the rest of cast, who are strong and incredibly understated.
I:9343;759;For all the reasons that audiences praised American Beauty for depicting the human experience on film, Magnolia adds a more realistic, relatable, and multi.
I:9343;760;layered version of modern day themes of humanity.
I:9343;761;It is a reflection of our own lives, flashing back to us a reminder of what's important in life and how it's never too late to make amends for lifelong mistakes.
I:9343;762;on a technical note, the soundtrack is beautifully implemented and the picture quailty is very detailed and clear.
I:9343;763;Most important, this is a movie where the extra disc full of bonus materials will help to illuminate the mulitple dimensions and deeper layers for the film.
I:9343;764;simply put, this film is an amazing work, more deserving of Best Picture than American Beauty.
I:9343;765;Magnolia is a film of the highest regard, taking on a massive amount of story and turning it into three hours of nothing but real.
I:9343;766;This is done with the utmost precision and intelligence in storytelling and brilliance, providing an intriguing and mesmerizin look into their lives.
I:9343;767;the cast, the moving ways in which the script manipulates them, and the overall effect are outstanding, making this the best picture of 1999.
I:9343;768;But I wanted to see PHillip Seymour Hoffman, who is, as always, wonderful.
I:9343;769;This is one of those movies you don't see often.
I:9343;770;The way of filming isn't normal either, and I think that real movie lovers will love this movie because of the beautifull way of filming and montage plus the very good score and songs which fit perfect in the film.
I:9343;771;the movie begins brilliant which shows right away that this isn't a normal movie.
I:9343;772;The acting is also fantastic, from the prefect preformance of Tom Cruise as the sex.
I:9343;773;therapist to the boy genius.
I:9343;774;i think this movie is a must to see for all movie fans, and you will like it as well if you like strange and very deep movies.
I:9343;775;PT Anderson pulled of an amazing bit of magic with this dark, intense, maddening but oh.
I:9343;776;are amazing: Hoffman, J. Moore, Walters, John C., and William H. Macy who is simply astounding.
I:9343;777;I know some people find it tough going or are intimidated by the long running time, but patience here provides an amazing reward.
I:9343;778;I loved every hour of this monster masterpiece.
I:9343;779;The plot defies description, so many diverse lives, so much desperation and beauty that the mind reels.
I:9343;780;Somehow it all comes to about as much resolution as any life does.
I:9343;781;Watch this work of art with an open mind and heart.
I:9343;782;the complex themes and character development take time to fully comprehend.
I:9343;783;True art makes you think a bit and helps you see the beauty in even the rough parts of life.
I:9343;784;about the aesthetic appeal of the movie .
I:9343;785;Aimee Mann's soundtrack played an integral role and helped create a definite mood.
I:9343;786;"Go watch it yourself
I:9343;787;Great, the bible says something about frogs in a verse that was referenced throughout the movie, but come on.
I:9343;788;Once again, I can respect the director's idea, to show how the random events in a series of lives intertwine, but overall I did not enjoy this movie the least bit.
I:9343;789;I give the director an A for effort and originality, but I give the movie a big thumbs down.
I:9343;790;I can only hope that Anderson wakes up and goes back to making a really good film like he did with Boogie Nights and Hard Eight.
I:9343;791;Either one will be worth owning.
I:9343;792;It documents stories of amazing coincidence that have occurred in real life, and then tries to establish freak coincidence as the theme of the film.
I:9343;793;Has anyone ever been successful at this?
I:9343;794;"7) Anderson throws in every ""issue"" he can he to give the film more dramatic heft."
I:9343;795;let it be known that I enjoyed PT Anderson's last two films.
I:9343;796;They were tightly constructed, entertaining, and always made sure to not take themselves too seriously.
I:9343;797;The performances were all great.
I:9343;798;William H. Macy was excellent!
I:9343;799;He had the best line in the movie, I've got some much love to give.
I:9343;800;Anderson's developed an innate talent for crafting versatile, flawed, joylessly realistic characters facing the end of their rope, and in that regard this might just be his best work.
I:9343;801;While the author's deliberate pace is admittedly a major hurdle, it also allows him to explore his cast to an intimate degree that's untouched by his contemporaries.
I:9343;802;A terrific exercise in characterization, it's tragically narcoleptic at times.
I:9343;803;this film is absolutely for you!
I:9343;804;Though it's longer than most viewers would like, or even be able to stand, it was worthwhile.
I:9343;805;I was so completely taken in by the strange depth and profound troubles of the characters that unfolded more and more through the film, along with the slowly revealed motivations for their actions and their unexpected connections to each other simultaneously, that time flew by without my awareness.
I:9343;806;"And Mr. Tom Cruise's Academy award nomination was no accident or publicity stunt
I:9343;807;And as far as the screen play is concerned, the recurring line about the past in this movie is one that should become a part of cinematic history.
I:9343;808;worth seeing more than once.
I:9343;809;It's more like a well orchestrated opera .
I:9343;810;or like a carefully crafted car: everything works so in sync that the final result is visually, mentally and spiritually enjoyable.
I:9343;811;magnolia is a movie with amazing characters, a well crafted plot, dark.
I:9343;812;comedy moments, some surprising twists and a lot of provoking visual metaphors.
I:9343;813;No moral lessons here, just a fantastic portrait of our world on the stories of these persons and the (casual?)
I:9343;814;all united under the fantastic music of Aimee Mann.
I:9343;815;funny how 9 years ago, when the movie first came out.
I:9343;816;but now 9 years later, I watched the movie again,and this time I have to say that I liked it.
I:9343;817;I TRIED to enjoy this film, very hard, in fact!
I:9343;818;Simply for the fact that super star Tom Cruise and wonderful character actor Philip Seymour Hoffman were in this film.
I:9343;819;I think you really, really need to concentrate while viewing this one, and I just didn't have that time/effort ready the evening I was watching set aside to concentrate as steadily as the movie demanded or deserved.
I:9343;820;which is so unlike me that I had to give this movie two stars.
I:9343;821;I thought it was a phenominal film.
I:9343;822;Just hearing a movie is three hours inspires gasps in most of world.
I:9343;823;Magnolia is such a detailed and fragile tale that seems like it will explode at any moment.
I:9343;824;Each character is so delicate that you feel like they might get cruched under their own emotions.
I:9343;825;Jon Brion's haunting score just adds to the atmosphere.
I:9343;826;Magnolia is easily and without a doubt one of the most original, interesting, and insightful films I have ever been fortunate enough to have seen.
I:9343;827;"acted plot spellbinds viewers
I:9343;828;This truth is that it is human nature to hurt and be hurt, to need and be needed, and is expertly illustrated through a spiral of everyday.
I:9343;829;compelling events intertwining the lives of the film's variety of characters.
I:9343;830;I thought Tom Cruise's performance was fantastic.
I:9343;831;"This is unlike any other Anderson movie
I:9343;832;necessary antidote for those of us who feel more and more alienated by modern life culture.
I:9343;833;The ensemble cast is uniformly inspired, and savagely underscores the stupidity of Oscars and Golden Globes.
I:9343;834;singling out an outstanding performance here is akin to taking apart a perfectly.
I:9343;835;one further point: you hear a lot about Anderson's audacity and ambition in discussions of MAGNOLIA.
I:9343;836;is one of the most haunting in movie history, one I hope to carry with me forever.
I:9343;837;frequently reffered to as malongia this film is masterpiece of films making.
I:9343;838;after boogie nights critics were p. iling up to smash PTA but he socked em in the nose with magnolia, a pure treat, with some of the most wonderful acting in years.
I:9343;839;you could say its one of the most realistic films for human life today, and after seeing the film, if it happend in amovie you wouldn't believe it, but would you believe it, when it rains it pours?
I:9343;840;This is my favorite film of 2000.
I:9343;841;Plus the extra interviews and diary of the film is fun and interesting.
I:9343;842;It maintains a brilliant delicate balance between the characters interconnecting them in strange and moving ways.
I:9343;843;The music is what makes the movie because it connects all of the characters in one emotional movement.
I:9343;844;Aimee Mann's music is simply poetic.
I:9343;845;Julianne Moore is one of the best American actresses of the shiny screen today and her performance is one that is complex and makes you feel tremendous sympathy for this woman who is so desperate.
I:9343;846;Tom Cruis' role is at the same time hilarious and moving.
I:9343;847;Philip Baker Hall gives a great performance.
I:9343;848;Those who loved 'Boogie Nights' will love this film.
I:9343;849;But even so, the film has so much to offer you will definitely feel you've got your money's worth.
I:9343;850;Few films can achieve greatness in the several important dimensions of a great text: acting, scripting, photography, pacing, etc.
I:9343;851;This is the mark of a good film.
I:9343;852;The random connections which keep cropping up between the nine main characters make this film all the more powerful, as if the universe were charging on without explanation or reason, throwing people onto the rocks as it did, randomly smashing their best attempts to live ordered lives.
I:9343;853;An ensemble cast in a wholly surprising and overwhelming film by the director of Boogie Nights.
I:9343;854;The entire cast is in top form, all conveying their extremely human flaws and still coming across in a way that evokes sympathy from the audience.
I:9343;855;The always spectacular Philip Seymour Hoffman portrays Robards's in.
I:9343;856;He is lonely and places a personal ad.
I:9343;857;There are many stories going on at once, and they connect to one another brilliantly.
I:9343;858;Paul Thomas Anderson's film 'Magnolia' is a movie that captures the full attention of the viewer from the first stories of chance and coincidence to the seemingly apocalyptic storm of frogs that draw all of the characters together.
I:9343;859;It's very rare to find a young writer/director who is equally adept with a camera and a pen.
I:9343;860;The movie is a masterpiece, both complex and visually stunning.
I:9343;861;A film like this should be the hallmark of a director's career.
I:9343;862;Fortunately for everybody, Anderson has the best years of his career ahead of him.
I:9343;863;A great movie all around.
I:9343;864;I found myself identifying with every single character in one way or another.
I:9343;865;Combine that with the excellent performances and the masterful direction, and what you have is a beautiful interlocking mosaic of a movie that may take two or more viewings to fully appreciate.
I:9343;866;I have seen too few films with this much hidden intensity and strength.
I:9343;867;In a subtle, seamless way, all things come together, follow each other, resolve themselves, and even the things that die come to terms with what is around them.
I:9343;868;This is an immensely thought provoking film that will last, passively perhaps, in your mind for a long while.
I:9343;869;Don't miss it, and you shall be rewarded.
I:9343;870;it was gripping, heartfelt, and very much sad.
I:9343;871;this is one of the best films i have seen it is a near master piece.
I:9343;872;with such a great cast.
I:9343;873;a great film from the director of boggie nights, and punch drunk love.
I:9343;874;Magnolia is a urban collision of lifes, presenting extraordinary facts many people has told that this movie isn't realistic at all, but I have to say that the prologue speak for itself, many of this things really happen and if you are emphatic enough you will just love this movie.
I:9343;875;Tom Cruise learned how to act, everyone on this movie is great.
I:9343;876;Has some secret goofs, music video of aimme (great video).
I:9343;877;I definitely agree with the reviewers who say that P. t. Anderson's Magnolia is extraordinarily self.
I:9343;878;The film sharply divides movie fans as it very well should.
I:9343;879;paul Thomas Anderson would do well to attain a bit of subtlety, but he is undeniably a very good filmmaker.
I:9343;880;When they're not overacting, though, the performances are very good.
I:9343;881;crafted, beautifully shot, with interesting stories and characters, a solid narrative structure and features an unforgettable ending.
I:9343;882;Even with these flaws, though, Magnolia is a dazzling display of filmmaking, and for those who appreciate ambitious cinema, it's (mostly) a joy to watch.
I:9343;883;"tom Cruise shines in the excellent portrayal of a tough guy who teaches in the ""Seduce and Destroy"" meeting how to tame women, but he will have problems which have something to do with his family."
I:9343;884;the movie develops everyone's personality and it lasts three hours, but it's worth watching it at once and again, and again, because you feel so carried away by all the stories that you suddenly feel like one of them.
I:9343;885;This movie has an important moral teaching, I think, and I'm still trying to understand the meaning of the frogs raining from the sky.
I:9343;886;Besides, Paul Thomas Anderson's work is really good, because of the way he links one story with another, and the technical camera movements to make it possible, and its soundtrack.
I:9343;887;The soundtrack of the movie is really good, above all, I liked a lot the Aimee Mann's songs.
I:9343;888;I love the scene in which all of them sing a song of her at the same time.
I:9343;889;magnolia is layers of wonderful acting and dialogue, not to mention out of this world cinematography and a beautiful sountrack by Aimee Mann.
I:9343;890;The entire cast and crew put their hearts and souls into this film and it sure does show!
I:9343;891;I've seen this epic drama many times now, and every time, there's something new I appreciate about it!
I:9343;892;I won't go deep into evaluating the performances, because everyone is their own powerhouse, but Philip Baker Hall and William H. Macy moved me more than I have ever been moved before.
I:9343;893;It's a real dark and emotional film, so try to watch it on a sunny day, not one that is gloomy and raining cats and frogs.
I:9343;894;I'll give it a shot.
I:9343;895;"I loved ""Two Days In The Valley""."
I:9343;896;They were fragmented movies that came together at the end and were very entertaining.
I:9343;897;fartsy to appreciate it, but let's get real here .
I:9343;898;mouth I'm picking up, I felt the need to speak up.
I:9343;899;this is a great movie.
I:9343;900;Paul Thomas Anderson maintains tension and energy throughout, via a combination of great writing, directing, and editing.
I:9343;901;This movie is unquestionably a must see.
I:9343;902;Paul Thomas Anderson gives us a powerful auteur piece that succeeds on most levels, but comes up short of its true potential.
I:9343;903;Anderson does inspired work, giving us deep character development for each of the nine.
I:9343;904;This is clearly some of the best and most thought provoking dark writing ever done.
I:9343;905;from a directorial standpoint, the film was a magnificent display of directorial virtuosity.
I:9343;906;Anderson handled scenes, actors and visual details with the flair of a maestro.
I:9343;907;The swirl of scenes from character to character, the use of the camera and music, the juxtaposition of scenes, everything was superbly done.
I:9343;908;michaelangelo once commented that inside every block of marble, there is a masterpiece, and the sculptor needs only cut away the right pieces.
I:9343;909;this film had everything necessary to be one of the truly great films of our times, but it suffered from excess.
I:9343;910;Anderson was trying to make important points with both of these devices, but in the process, they trivialized an exceptionally powerful drama to the point of eye rolling incredulity.
I:9343;911;He could have had a commercial success, critical acclaim, and he still could have given people an opportunity to see his entire vision.
I:9343;912;as to the acting, this is probably the best ensemble performance I have ever seen.
I:9343;913;"Tom Cruise was nominated for a best supporting Oscar and much as I love Michael Caine and his performance in ""The Cider House Rules"", this was no contest."
I:9343;914;This was one of his best performances ever.
I:9343;915;I also thought Jason Robards' performance was worthy of supporting actor nomination.
I:9343;916;He was tremendous as the dying patriarch.
I:9343;917;The rest of the cast was phenomenal without exception.
I:9343;918;I must admit to feeling both emotions.
I:9343;919;It will undoubtedly become a cult classic rather than the true classic it could have been.
I:9343;920;Where is the miraculous movie announced at the start?
I:9343;921;Everything that follows resembles an expensive, beautifully shot and star.
I:9343;922;Cruise is good, but not on peak form.
I:9343;923;I really liked Boogie Nights, but this one was dire.
I:9343;924;Is this some kind of great hidden truth?
I:9343;925;"I love movies from A to Z. I love Chaplin, Spielberg
I:9343;926;I rate it 2 stars for the songs, the outtakes and the pre credits sequence.
I:9343;927;I love movies that make you think, this was one of those movies.
I:9343;928;I also love movies where all the characters are connected in some way and they do not realize it.
I:9343;929;I thought that this was a great movie.
I:9343;930;Tom Cruise gives a wonderful performance that is completely unlike anything he has ever done.
I:9343;931;Julianne Moore and Phillip Seymore Hoffmann are great in this film.
I:9343;932;Even William H. Macy adds to the movie with the small part that he has.
I:9343;933;The soundtrack by Aimee Mann is also defiantely worth picking up.
I:9343;934;This movie is long, but so worth.
I:9343;935;I recommed it to anyone.
I:9343;936;This is art, this is a Paul Thomas Anderson painting.
I:9343;937;Everyone delivers incredible performances, but the man who stole the show was TOM CRUISE.
I:9343;938;In this film, people from all walks of life break down and come face.
I:9343;939;The film's script was written inspired by lyrics written by Aimee Mann who provides the film's poignant soundtrack.
I:9343;940;But the human condition, although puzzling at times, proves resilient.
I:9343;941;but there is forgiveness, redemption, compassion, and hope.
I:9343;942;going art student friends and uni.
I:9343;943;I feel that PT Anderson does indeed create well.
I:9343;944;rounded characters, compelling dialogue and stuff like that.
I:9343;945;The actors cast in his movies always deliver brilliant performances .
I:9343;946;I thought it was cool how all of their lives eventually come together in the end.
I:9343;947;this movie is a masterpiece!
I:9343;948;I'm going to keep this review short and sweet.
I:9343;949;This is one the greatest movies ever made.
I:9343;950;If you have yet to see it, see it.
I:9343;951;It's been a long, long time since I've seen a film this good.
I:9343;952;I bought the two disc version and the extra features are well worth the extra money.
I:9343;953;Magnolia is a magnificent film by Director Paul Anderson.
I:9343;954;all the dreams of youth and the little hopes of middle age are woven together into a storyabout those who were sure that life would treat them better than it has or ever will.
I:9343;955;jason Robards last film, a role that expanded Tom Cruise's skills as an actor, Julianne Moore reveals even more of her talentand William Macy gives one of his best performances, Jeremy Blackman plays the long suffering child prodigy as well as anyone has.
I:9343;956;i ran out to see this picture immediately upon its release because I was so impressed with Anderson's Boogie Nights.
I:9343;957;in a large ensemble cast in a multi.
I:9343;958;plotted story very remniscent to the works of director Robert Altman and P. t. Anderson's own previous work, the message is best summated by the introductory film Anderson uses to begin the story.
I:9343;959;It is a real connection which exists between all of us, and how one thing happening to one person will affect and effect a mysterious chain of events and people.
I:9343;960;"aimee Mann, best remembered as the lead singer of 1980s pop group 'Til Tuesday, provides several original songs as well as covers others for the film
I:9343;961;from themselves, from each other, and most certainly, from the past wrongs they've committed against each other.
I:9343;962;The Past is a very strong character in this film, and is everpresent in the present day these people are trying to get through.
I:9343;963;A film of this complexity demands your time and undivided attention.
I:9343;964;This was probably the best ending to a great movie I've ever seen.
I:9343;965;The whole movie sets up for what's coming at the end, and I guarantee you'll like it!What a great cast with a good story and music.
I:9343;966;I'm usually not for mushy dramatic movies, but this one won me over.
I:9343;967;It has comedy, romance, drama, action, and brains.
I:9343;968;all the ingredients the perfect movie needs.
I:9343;969;All of their lives cross each other and mix into one on this fine day.
I:9343;970;it makes you laugh and cry all at the same time.
I:9343;971;However this is on the whole a massive, ambitious, funny, imaginative, and unusual film and surely is among the best of '99(of course, it is part of a group of very good pictures from that year which did not receive best picture nominations .
I:9343;972;There are some very fine performances (Philip Seymour Hoffman, Tom Cruise, Julianne Moore, Philip Baker Hall, John C. Reilly ) and a few subpar ones(Jeremy Blackman and that coke.
I:9343;973;It does manage to be captivating through its entire running time, and the frogs are cool even if they are biblical.
I:9343;974;It is also a directorial triumph for P. t. Anderson, who impressed many critics with 'Boogie Nights' but seems to have truly forged a style of his own with 'Magnolia.'
I:9343;975;If anythingm this is a masterpiece of editing technique, one that would make Robert Altman proud, with its complex intermingling of a gigantic cast.
I:9343;976;But speaking strictly for myself, I thought it was extraordinarily moving and poignant.
I:9343;977;I was also captivated by the basic themes of the film, it seems to be redemption, forgiveness, and defiance.
I:9343;978;All in all though, I really was moved.
I:9343;979;I'd hate to recommend it to people that may not like it, but all I'm saying is that if you like really deep films, or stellar acting, or both, then you should definitely check this out.
I:9343;980;the start of the movie is enticing enough for you to sitthrough it.
I:9343;981;"I was hoping it would be a good drama, especially as I enjoyed ""Boogie Nights"", one of PT Anderson's previous offerings."
I:9343;982;The main problem is that there is nobody really likeable in the story.
I:9343;983;Magnolia is an opera, an epic, a confession, a prayer.
I:9343;984;Paul Thomas Anderson is an excellent filmmaker and a first.
I:9343;985;rate dramatist, and his cinematic storytelling most definitely helped uplift me at a troubled time.
I:9343;986;paul Thomas Anderson presents us with a powerful drama that becomes (among other things) a meditation upon the long.
I:9343;987;experiencing the raw emotional honesty of the characters (such as the grown.
I:9343;988;I've rarely seen such powerful and emotionally vulnerable performances.
I:9343;989;The cast is truly remarkable.
I:9343;990;at yet a more abstract level, Magnolia is more than an interesting character study.
I:9343;991;It depicts the intricate nature of human relationships and the way in which relationships weave their way into the fabric of our individual existences.
I:9343;992;anyone who has lived long enough to have made significant choices that have changed the course of their life will find this film to be a powerful journey.
I:9343;993;Okay, I give the technical aspects of this film 5 stars.
I:9343;994;The acting is all the way from pretty good to extraordinary.
I:9343;995;The energy to keep all the balls in the air on this film is very high.
I:9343;996;This is a perfect academic case of a director going straight up his anus all the way up the alimentary canal and out his mouth again and then proceeding to take another roundtripper through the digestive system.
I:9343;997;I get the redemptive elements, I get the human elements.
I:9343;998;I'm good at writing that kind of dialogue on my own.
I:9343;999;What I want in a movie is some semblance of eloquence.
I:9343;1000;Tom Cruise's acting is great but if you've ever had real exposure to self help seminars and the actual content of those seminars it's some of the most brilliant balloon juice you've ever heard: Wayne Dyer's Power of Intention, Susie Orman or Dave Ramsey's financial shows, etc., etc.
I:9343;1001;"and keep saying to yourselves, people, ""it's just a movie."""
I:9343;1002;Try getting your own sense of style and DIRECTION.
I:9343;1003;the complex themes and character development take time to fully comprehend.
I:9343;1004;True art makes you think a bit and helps you see the beauty in even the rough parts of life.
I:9343;1005;about the aesthetic appeal of the movie .
I:9343;1006;Aimee Mann's soundtrack played an integral role and helped create a definite mood.
I:9343;1007;"Go watch it yourself
I:9343;1008;It has great moments, it has adequate moments, it has really good dialogue, it has really bad dialogue, etc., etc.
I:9343;1009;PT Anderson gets many points for the sheer ambition of the film.
I:9343;1010;He's very ambitious, and rarely makes gratuitous pop culture references in his films.
I:9343;1011;Second, the game show sequences are well edited and put together.
I:9343;1012;Third, the camera work is first rate.
I:9343;1013;Fourth, the opening sequence (shot on an old, handcrank silent camera) gives the film a great introduction.
I:9343;1014;There are some reasons to see this film, but maybe not enough reasons to watch the whole film.
I:9343;1015;When you see the casting, you just expect a great movie and I guess the acting is the only thing positive in it.
I:9343;1016;when the movie starts in a really cool and interesting way and when you know that you have 3 hours movie to watch, you just think What a great moment I am ready to enjoy .
I:9343;1017;The one star rate is really for the actors only !
I:9343;1018;Magnolia is one of those wonderful films that goes beyond thenormal boundaries of film.
I:9343;1019;the movie is long but more than worth the time invested.
I:9343;1020;a number of stories are woven together.
I:9343;1021;Instead it sucks you into to its reality with a pacing worthy of Kubrick's Barry Lyndon.
I:9343;1022;through the story of a number of stories in Magnolia we experience a whole new out look into the ordinary world, seeing it as a type of hyper.
I:9343;1023;All of us have at one time or another experienced a coincidence.
I:9343;1024;Call them a layers of rhythms that existence beyond our perceptions, call them synchronicity, call them the hand of God, in this movie we are prodded into experiencing ever so gently and with more than a little humor is that something is going on.
I:9343;1025;The true art of this movie is that we are not told a story we experience it.
I:9343;1026;a famous powerful ancient TV game show producer, Earl Partridge, is dying.
I:9343;1027;All both Stanley and Donnie want is to be loved.
I:9343;1028;the sound track by Aimee Mann greatly adds to the movie.
I:9343;1029;This movie is one of the best movies I have come across.
I:9343;1030;It is exciting and full of emotion, providing more character depth.
I:9343;1031;My opinion: Magnolia is one of the greatest and most important films ever made.
I:9343;1032;book, and it demands you to accept it upon its own terms.
I:9343;1033;Magnolia is nothing short of a masterpiece, and like all art that is ahead of its time, it will take decades for the film to be widely appreciated.
I:9343;1034;You really liked it, sire?King: Well, of course I did!
I:9343;1035;Just cut a few and it'll be perfect.
I:9343;1036;All of them are interesting and carry a somewhat similar theme of regretting the past.
I:9343;1037;But this event is what makes the movie good, like it stops the stories for a few minutes then finally pulls them together.
I:9343;1038;Superb!It should be nominated in every category , and won, in the Oscars.
I:9343;1039;Instead, the more palatable American Beauty got all the attention.
I:9343;1040;This was the last masterpiece of the 20th century.
I:9343;1041;What a fantastic director that P T Anderson was able to transform Tom Cruise into a real fine actor.
I:9343;1042;As for Julianne Moore, she's breathtaking.
I:9343;1043;good stench that becomes pervasive by the last few minutes, the simple storytelling ability and innovative narrative structure would make it a superb work.
I:9343;1044;very believable characters are Magnolia's greatest strength.
I:9343;1045;Despite the wide range of social class and personality, every character has human weaknesses and strengths.
I:9343;1046;The stories were solid enough on their own!
I:9343;1047;From top to bottom Magnolia is one of the best most powerful movies of the past few year's
I:9343;1048;I love P. T. Anderson's work but this might be my favorite film of his.
I:9343;1049;The way he weaves and compares lives on the brink is the work of a master filmmaker.
I:9343;1050;The nineties Decade aroused the greatest interest all over the world.
I:9343;1051;"magnolia was somehow, a work that clearly anticipated related films (The butterfly effect, Memento) and became a mainstream within the ambit of a new approach narrative as well a true rearrangement of the classical structure, kinetic frenzy, ellipsis and aggressive camera angles, but mainly a real concern for expressing, exploring that confirm that old statement of Orson Welles: ""The cinema is a ribbon of dreams"" ."
I:9343;1052;The film is extremely ambitious: to face the challenge to tell twelve stories, linking them and focus about the little triumphs and failures, of the merits and miseries of the common people.
I:9343;1053;It is mature movie without special effects.
I:9343;1054;And far beyond the fact of being nominated for the Academy Awards, the picture will show you the importance of the crossed incidents that may cause the interruption of a successful life, or the turning point of an peaceful existence.
I:9343;1055;dazzling edition work and brilliant performances of Julianne Moore, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Tom Cruise.
I:9343;1056;pT Anderson also thinks moving the camera all over the place is having visual sense.
I:9343;1057;This is classic Paul Thomas Anderson.
I:9343;1058;He offers an interplay of interesting characters and you just stand back and enjoy the spectacle as their lives clash and intertwine.
I:9343;1059;I loved reading the reviews on this one.
I:9343;1060;I really liked John C Reilly in this, and I normally don't.
I:9343;1061;Robards was really good and so was Hoffman.
I:9343;1062;A really great cast, and EVERYONE was at the top of their acting game.
I:9343;1063;the beginning and ending of this film (both very prolific and involving)are pulled off nicely.
I:9343;1064;the infamous raining frogs scene is simply fantastic and one of the best scenes.
I:9343;1065;we all share throughout our lives.
I:9343;1066;top it is done well, just like one would sing their favorite song from the top 10 to themself.
I:9343;1067;this film has attributes most others don't, and that is overall clarity (which most films prefer to blur), is moving (which most films prefer to implement with only a death), and a passion to reveal to the audience that a film doesnt have to be about supernatural or otherworldly things to catch an interest, all a film has to do is be honest.
I:9343;1068;This might be the best film ever made.
I:9343;1069;I have now seen it at least a dozen times and it literally gets better every time.
I:9343;1070;Nothing comes quite as close to peeking under the surface of the big everything.
I:9343;1071;The opening sequence is fantastic.
I:9343;1072;Tom Cruise, I hate to say, is terrific.
I:9343;1073;It's a remarkable piece of writing.
I:9343;1074;the directing is the best I've seen.
I:9343;1075;julianne Moore gives a great performance.
I:9343;1076;She does an excellent job in that as well.
I:9343;1077;"She ""holds"" the character's emotions in every job and carries it through every change and turn."
I:9343;1078;the emotions in this film are deeply portrayed and prepared in the most knowledgable way, with understanding of what these people are going through.
I:9343;1079;It should be our understanding always to accept people in any admiration, and it is necessary to admire these people when watching this.
I:9343;1080;I say this much knowing that the film gets good reviews here, and it really is a good experience with the score by Jon Brion, which is also available.
I:9343;1081;Thus, this is a film of good faith in people.
I:9343;1082;There is so much more to the world.
I:9343;1083;i have a certain ideal for movies that haven't been made yet, and it is closer to reality but relevant throughout, in the way of lifting our emotions at certain scenes as Six Feet Under has done so well.
I:9343;1084;And Magnolia is done intensely and in an exaggerated way but still bringing you to feel for these people.
I:9343;1085;If you are one to this movement, you will appreciate much of what Magnolia is.
I:9343;1086;Only simply because it is one of those rare and complicated films that fuses so many emotions and stories that you're left wondering.
I:9343;1087;It was a masterful, intricately webbed film about love, hate, failure, death, life, and our own journeys to truth and self.
I:9343;1088;This film slowly grows into its own darkness and beauty.
I:9343;1089;This complex movie is superbly acted and directed .
I:9343;1090;Tom Cruise's Oscar nomination is definitely warranted here, and Aimee Mann's songs are the glue that holds the multiple plots together.
I:9343;1091;Julianne Moore is spectacular as the harried wife of dying Jason Robards, and Philip Seymour Hoffman is a standout as Robards' male nurse.
I:9343;1092;A complex story with the whole range of emotions, this is a definite must see.
I:9343;1093;I have just seen the VHS Version of this movie, and I can tell that with no doubth this is the best 1999 movie.
I:9343;1094;p. t. anderson continues surprising us with it's assebly of characters, music and dialogs.
I:9343;1095;I thought the performances in this film were stupendous.
I:9343;1096;Cruise was nominated for best supporting actor for it and I thought should have won it, hands down.
I:9343;1097;This movie also can lay claim to the weirdest beginning and ending in movie history!
I:9343;1098;Penis crazy Tom Cruise gets sensitive enough to restrain himself from kicking a dog.
I:9343;1099;Julianne's been one of my favorite actresses for a long time, but the script has her only saying variations on the f. word and making unattractive faces.
I:9343;1100;See it and decide for yourself.
I:9343;1101;Magnolia was a very interesting movie.
I:9343;1102;I went too see because of the collection of excellent actors involved.
I:9343;1103;ridden because she loved him for his fame and money.
I:9343;1104;I though Paul Thomas Anderson did a fantastic job juggling characters and making me think how they're lives are linked through consequence.
I:9343;1105;I found the acting incredibly strong and convincing.
I:9343;1106;The movie clocks over 3 hours and you need an open mind to enjoy the movie.
I:9343;1107;I would strongly recommend this movie.
I:9343;1108;Marvellous, divine, angelic, with a good dose of sugar on top and whip cream la mode.
I:9343;1109;and to make that miracle of reformation happen God will send a powerful sign in the middle of the night from the sky and that I won't reveal.
I:9343;1110;The taller the tale, the more believable.
I:9343;1111;An extremely intricate and enthralling story played out by a perfectly assembled ensemble cast.
I:9343;1112;Just thinking about it makes me want to watch it again.
I:9343;1113;P. t. Anderson is one of the few directors out there worthy of the title Auteur.
I:9343;1114;Hitchcock, Scorcese, Tarantino (if he decides to make more).
I:9343;1115;They are a new breed of director who don't just make movies, they make films.
I:9343;1116;watch and you'll notice that Anderson is in full control of MAGNOLIA (he wrote and directed it).
I:9343;1117;He takes long scenes and keeps them interesting by way of great performances and constant motion of the camera.
I:9343;1118;You feel yourself moving through his films as the films move within themselves.
I:9343;1119;MAGNOLIA opens with a fantastic first half hour filled with continuous cameral panning, music overlay and character introduction.
I:9343;1120;It really is one of the most exhilarating openings.
I:9343;1121;The middle of the film has a musical interlude with Aimee Mann's beautiful song Wise Up .
I:9343;1122;A very nice and unusual touch.
I:9343;1123;up to the ending is truly uplifting as John C. Reilly's character talks about people and redemption.
I:9343;1124;It leaves the viewer with hope.
I:9343;1125;Because the movie is about the good in people.
I:9343;1126;The sound is phenomenal, especially with a film whose music is as integral to the plot as the characters.
I:9343;1127;and 3 hours is a lot to invest in a movie, but if you loved Anderson's BOOGIE NIGHTS, you'll appreciate MAGNOLIA.
I:9343;1128;Cruise IS as good as the critics said, and everyone else surely deserved to be nominated as well.
I:9343;1129;Someday The Academy is going to have to offer a BEST CAST PERMORMANCE award, because Anderson's actors are always at their best.
I:9343;1130;First off, the myriad positive and well.
I:9343;1131;Then, you have films like 'MY OWN PRIVATE IDAHO' or 'MEMENTO', films that march to a beat all their own and demand that the audience pay close attention.
I:9343;1132;The flow and ebb of this film is akin to a heartbeat, with natural pauses, natural progressions, natural rhythms.
I:9343;1133;life of all characters involved, and start to see how they are all connected, each revelation heart.
I:9343;1134;there's one other factor that goes into watching this film that, while not taking away from it, is absolutely essential in understanding and appreciating it, and that's a certain level of experience and understanding with the lonliness that the film exudes like sweat.
I:9343;1135;The issues in this film hit home the most with people who've lived a life a little outside the norm.
I:9343;1136;All in all, I find this film beautiful, heartbreakingly real, and true.
I:9343;1137;I would hate ruining someone's experience of a film, especially one I love this much.
I:9343;1138;"It is true that he confesses his infidelity to Rose, but I'd argue this is because of his selfish need to unburden himself
I:9343;1139;The survivors are given another chance and a clean slate.
I:9343;1140;He wants only to be with her, help her to heal, and listen to her without judgement.
I:9343;1141;He finally seems to understand how to put his Christian morality to use, and you get the idea he will be a much better, more discerning police officer for it.
I:9343;1142;This gives the dad a second chance.
I:9343;1143;He wanted no doubt in the minds of the characters or the audience that this occurrence was divine in nature.
I:9343;1144;i love, love, love this film.
I:9343;1145;related and go back and forth throughout the movie, very clever, interesting and well done.
I:9343;1146;i thought the first song went especially well with what was going on in this movie.
I:9343;1147;that sequence*many memorable scenes, twists, witty humor, Magnolia will stay with you forever
I:9343;1148;One of my favorite movies of all time .
I:9343;1149;One of the few movies I own that I had to go back and make sure I rebought on Blu.
I:9343;1150;handed), Magnolia seems to me now the most heartfelt and original movie epic since, well, since forever.
I:9343;1151;(I was going to say since Nashville, but the truth is, Magnolia is a considerably richer and more personal work than Altman's.)
I:9343;1152;With only his third film, Anderson made a masterpiece, a film that walks the high.
I:9343;1153;Even so, Magnolia confounded many viewers (myself included obviously) with its brazen originality and disregard for movie conventions.
I:9343;1154;To fully appreciate the scope, depth, and intensity of Anderson's film, it may be necessary to meet the writer.
I:9343;1155;"As Anderson said to the crew on the first day of shooting, making a great movie is ""nothing to be ashamed of."
I:9343;1156;As a work of art, Magnolia is hugely entertaining, as well as being the closest American movies have come in recent years to a genuine labor of love.
I:9343;1157;Against all odds, Anderson has made an intimate epic that stays true to his individual vision, a film that is both disturbingly personal and sweepingly universal in its reach.
I:9343;1158;"Anderson makes a proud and plaintive cry to be saved from the ranks of the freaks who suspect they can never love anyone
I:9343;1159;with his ability to pull off something this freakish.
I:9343;1160;paul Thomas Anderson proved himself to be a truly Promethean talent, a bona fide filmmaking genius.
I:9343;1161;"As Pauline Kael wrote of Coppola in his heyday (The Godfather Part Two), ""that's the inner voice of the authentic hero."""
I:9343;1162;Brilliantly directed, fantastic performances all around.
I:9343;1163;telling, with a very original framing device.
I:9343;1164;Stick with it, it's worth it.
I:9343;1165;This is the greatest movie than i ever seen!!!!!!!
I:9343;1166;Paul Thomas Anderson is the best writer and director of all the 90', and an amazing peformance of all the cast
I:9343;1167;I couldn't recommend anyone away from MAGNOLIA simply because it's worth seeing John C. Reilly's superb performance as a messed.
I:9343;1168;up cop and William H. Macy's equally fine performance as a former child genius.
I:9343;1169;I wonder what it's like for a person like p. t. anderson to make a movie so complex, intriguing and interesting that it inspires people to write really long paragraphs about it.
I:9343;1170;"Everyone doesn't just say 'good movie, go see it', they in fact write a really detailed fully paragraphed review that's actually more than just a review
I:9343;1171;Boogie Nights (especially being written at the age of 19), Punch Drunk Love, There Will Be Blood, The Master and this movie are all masterpieces, this is a what happens when a truly bright intellectualist makes it in the movie business.
I:9343;1172;Stanley Kubrick, P. t. Anderson and Wes Anderson make truly amazing movies that touch the hearts of the intellectual beings.
I:9343;1173;Magnolia was a great movie for many many reasons.
I:9343;1174;The intricate plot, with amazing character work.
I:9343;1175;and even though the movie is three hours long, it really moves along nicely.
I:9343;1176;Tom Cruise is absolutely spectacular.
I:9343;1177;All of the intricate plot lines and character analysis is what makes the movie an amazing joy to watch.
I:9343;1178;it can really change the way you view life.
I:9343;1179;Let me preface this review by stating that P. t. Anderson has real potential and Frank T. j. Mackey is one of the all time funniest characters ever to grace the screen.
I:9343;1180;Tom Cruise gives his career performance, Macy is amazing as always, and Philip Seymour Hoffman is solid as Phil.
I:9343;1181;PT Anderson's Magnolia is a beautiful picture that tackles many interpersonal issues.
I:9343;1182;"Mr. Anderson has said he got the idea for the film from his good friend Aimee Mann, who had written a song with the lyric, later to be used in the film, ""now that I've met you, would you object to never seeing each other again?"""
I:9343;1183;"When newly acquainted with someone you are putting on your best face
I:9343;1184;"So I will run away first before I ruin the good first impression you have""."
I:9343;1185;the filming style of this movie (cinematography) is amazing.
I:9343;1186;Julianne Moore plays perhaps her best role yet as a woman who marries a man not for love, but for his money and only when he is dying of cancer does she finally realize that she loves him deeply.
I:9343;1187;the best description of the ideas of this movie comes in the form of the songs of Aimee Mann, on the soundtrack.
I:9343;1188;She inspired this movie and the music is transcendental.
I:9343;1189;"overall an amazing film, and awkward to talk about
I:9343;1190;Magnolia is a wonderfully crafted and executed account of 9 people whose stories and troubles are all strangely connected with eachother's.
I:9343;1191;worthy performances from the entire cast (especially Tom Cruise, Melora Walters, John C. Reilly, and Phillip Seymour Hoffan) and crew (especially P. T. Anderson), this is probably the most underated movie of all time.
I:9343;1192;Deeply moving, and highly entertaining, this film is nothing short of genius.
I:9343;1193;this movie, sporting an excellent cast, had great potential.
I:9343;1194;The first ten minutes of the movie made me feel I was truly in for a great movie.
I:9343;1195;The next hour and a half kept me on the edge of my seat waiting for how the plots were going to come together.
I:9343;1196;All I can say is.
I:9343;1197;when it rains, it pours!
I:9343;1198;This is my 3rd favorite film of all time besides The Godfather and Pulp Fiction.
I:9343;1199;Following might be Taxi Driver, Star Wars Trilogy, Fargo, Memento, LOTR Trilogy, Goodfellas, and others.
I:9343;1200;But anyways, this is truly a great movie.
I:9343;1201;There's been so much talk about this film, either hearing it's amazing or it sucks.
I:9343;1202;paul Thomas Anderson is one of the best new directors of our time, and is one of my favorite directors of all time.
I:9343;1203;Some other new directors to note would be Quentin Tarantino, Joel Coen, Darren Aronofsky, Spike Jonze, Sofia Coppola, Kevin Smith, Christopher Nolan, Guy Ritchie, and so on.
I:9343;1204;The film essentially tells the story of 9 lives in the San Fernando Valley following one day.
I:9343;1205;The film is 3 hours, but works perfectly operaticly with the time.
I:9343;1206;It actually is one of the most operatic movies in the running time it works within.
I:9343;1207;Read Roger Ebert's review if you want to fully understand why this is such a great movie.
I:9343;1208;But the story is great, welding 9 stories in one blend of themes and emotions, and I really felt chills down my spine.
I:9343;1209;It's simply engrossing to experience Magnolia.
I:9343;1210;I liked Paul Thomas Anderson's Boogie Nights when I saw it a few years ago, so I gave Magnolia a shot after stumbling over it at the video store.
I:9343;1211;What really suckered me in was the roughly ten minute opening sequence, one of the most original and intriguing opening sequences I have ever seen in a movie, about a murder filled with amazing coincidences hinting at inescapable fate.
I:9343;1212;But there is something else going on here that transcends these ideas and moves Anderson's picture into the realm of the religious.
I:9343;1213;Magnolia concerns a day in the life of a host of characters both big and small in modern day Los Angeles.
I:9343;1214;His concern at the present is a taped interview he agreed to do with a nosy reporter, an interview that ominously threatens to lift the carefully crafted veil of secrecy Mackey placed around his personal life and childhood.
I:9343;1215;All of the performances in this film are excellent.
I:9343;1216;As good a job as Cruise does here, John C. Reilly steals the show in the role of police officer Jim Kurring.
I:9343;1217;Then something remarkable happens: the healing begins.
I:9343;1218;Match the religious themes with a great soundtrack, the performances, and the somber feel of the film and you have the makings for a marvelous three.
I:9343;1219;as far as the movie, I really enjoyed it.
I:9343;1220;A masterpiece movie that gets under one's skin and grows in retrospect.
I:9343;1221;this is one of my all time favorite soundtracks.
I:9343;1222;"Aimee Mann, who incidentally was the inspiration for a few of the story lines, singing ""Save Me"", ""Wise Up"" and covering Harry Nilsson is a thing of beauty."
I:9343;1223;I loved this movie the first time I saw it, but I knew there was something more to it.
I:9343;1224;The way the director pulls you into each of the nine characters is amazing, and the climax was hilarious, awesome, and disgusting at the same time.
I:9343;1225;There is also some symbolic play with the colors used.
I:9343;1226;If you have any insights into this I would love to hear them!
I:9343;1227;I absolutely love this movie, and keep learning more and more about it every time I see it, which is only two times.
I:9343;1228;And if you missed some of these things, try watching it again, and maybe you'll see something deeper.
I:9343;1229;This is a review of a great film, that I like a lot.
I:9343;1230;What a really great film, just great.
I:9343;1231;He may be a visionary, but not a writer.
I:9343;1232;This movie is sprawling and sometimes disconnected and pure genius.
I:9343;1233;time top ten favorite movies list, but I have noticed that a lot of people either love it or hate it.
I:9343;1234;The packaging was nice and snug.
I:9343;1235;Very trustworthy and worth every penny!
I:9343;1236;Made a wonderful Valentine's Day gift.
I:9343;1237;Thank you for my movie!
I:9343;1238;This is a movie of characters facing great challenges in their life and how each individual challenge is linked together.
I:9343;1239;The acting is terrific, the use of music superb, and the view of life as a depressing weather forecast is clever.
I:9343;1240;Magnolia is one of the most fascinating movies ever made.
I:9343;1241;Best thing Moore and Cruise have ever done, and that's saying something!
I:9343;1242;Macy and Reilly are terrific.
I:9343;1243;Ranks up there in my top five of all time.
I:9343;1244;Tom Cruise's performance alone was worth watching the film.
I:9343;1245;I had a great feeling about this film when it started.
I:9343;1246;The opening scenes concerning coincidence were great, and the sharply edited introductions to the characters had me expecting something truly exceptional.
I:9343;1247;So from the outset I had this feeling I was really going to enjoy this film .
I:9343;1248;I usually tend to love or hate films, but with this one it's both at the same time.
I:9343;1249;There are some truly outstanding performanes here, and there are moments of genuine brilliance in terms of direction, script, camera work etc. which made me feel I was watching something truly special.
I:9343;1250;all of a sudden, my feelings of 'this is an incredible film', started to be replaced by 'I'm being preached to'.
I:9343;1251;To conclude, it's a brilliant idea, marvelously acted .
I:9343;1252;I'd recommend that people see this film to make up their own minds, and I'm glad I saw it myself .
I:9343;1253;It is a movie of urban legends, wrath, human sense and sensibilities.
I:9343;1254;"Paul Thomas Anderson (""Punch Drunk Love,"" ""Boogie Nights"" among others) both directed and wrote this eclectic film."
I:9343;1255;The film was very creative in using narration, the beginning history lesson on chance and during the film, chance sums up the film.
I:9343;1256;It was one of the most creative films made, packed with stars and I will guarantee you that you have never seen another film like it.
I:9343;1257;The film follows the trials of people, successful and outcasts and had some great performances and ended with religious overtones (the wrath part), maybe as a metaphor for how the people in the film lives developed and ended.
I:9343;1258;I loved it not knowing it was hollywood.
I:9343;1259;the characters are totally real.
I:9343;1260;"On the edge of being a general ""character"" but very very real."
I:9343;1261;This movie is real be quiet.
I:9343;1262;But the director is nice to rich, powerful people, so, despite this schlock and romance novel show, I'm sure he will annoy us on Oscar night for many years to come.
I:9343;1263;A story that reaches into the human sould and reveals all of the dirt and all the beauty.
I:9343;1264;It is human and that is probably the best term that I can use to describe this epic story.
I:9343;1265;One way that you can tell how good a movie is the response that it generates.
I:9343;1266;Well I loved it and I will tell you why.
I:9343;1267;It is what we are and it shows what we can be.
I:9343;1268;It will split you open and tear you apart on a first or second viewing.
I:9343;1269;When I first watched this movie, I thought the prologue was ingenius and totally got drawn in to the story.
I:9343;1270;We treat each other wrong and do it over and over.
I:9343;1271;now I realize how powerful and amazing this movie truly is.
I:9343;1272;I have to see it again!
I:9343;1273;What I liked about this movie is the characters.
I:9343;1274;They are frail and have weakness in them, and sometimes you have to look for reasons to like them, like in real life.
I:9343;1275;Tom Cruise takes a good turn here, I think, better than most of his movies.
I:9343;1276;There is a Frank TJ Mackey infomercial that is hilarious, some deleted scenes (check for them on the color bar segment), and a nice Amy Mann video.
I:9343;1277;There was a great story, incredible actors and performances, wonderful photography and production values, but a butchered screenplay and editing job.
I:9343;1278;Crash got 4 1/2 stars from me, this gets 1 1/2 stars, strictly for the technical work and acting.
I:9343;1279;MAGNOLIA is one of the greatest movies ever made.
I:9343;1280;I have watched it many times and am still in awe.
I:9343;1281;This film, this Magnolia, was a piece of heavenly humanity on film.
I:9343;1282;We see a number of seemingly all.
I:9343;1283;This something comes together in many realistic ways but under the umbrella of a miraculous event at the end of the film.
I:9343;1284;The man's son, Tom Cruise, is living with his own pitfalls and attempts harboring his pain by playing the daily role of a extremely confident sex guru.
I:9343;1285;Tame her is his theme and his following involves thousands of men with voids themselves.
I:9343;1286;there is a Christian cop who has the heart of a lamb but the insecurities of a psych patient.
I:9343;1287;It is their relationship, in my opinion, that steals the show.
I:9343;1288;"there are others, of course
I:9343;1289;manages to steal our hearts in a handsome display of well.
I:9343;1290;Despite their confident smiles and tones, each person in this film is deeply frail.
I:9343;1291;a stirring film with raw emotion and deep compassion.
I:9343;1292;provoking and beautifully graceful, Magnolia is an emotional powerful film if there ever was one.
I:9343;1293;If you have three hours to spare, give this film a chance!
I:9343;1294;cute, all lower case p. t. anderson in Magnolia's credits)is both a wonderful writer and director.
I:9343;1295;I loved both Hard Eight, and Boogie Nights, in which he managed to wring an interesting performance out of drab Mark Wahlberg.
I:9343;1296;there is an assortment of interesting characters, who deliver at times great, wholly unique believeable lines ( It IS safe to confuse children with angels! )
I:9343;1297;driven as it is emotions.
I:9343;1298;For over three hours, we see characters agonize their way through their day.
I:9343;1299;beating hysteria that characterizes most of this movie.
I:9343;1300;Hidden themes, unveiling of an extraordinary plot, and the correlation of all the actions and words out of a character to build up to one of the most mind.
I:9343;1301;moving endings that a movie could possibly offer.
I:9343;1302;The cinematography is perfect, used to enhance each moment of this drama.
I:9343;1303;The musical score and soundtrack for the movie is practically award.
I:9343;1304;Watch it with an open mind and look hard and try to reveal for yourself the true theme.
I:9343;1305;If you do this successfully, you will find that Magnolia is the best movie you have ever seen.
I:9343;1306;The power of this film is however the brilliant directors ability to blend these stories into a tale of the bizzare and the unusual through one day in the San Fernando Valley.
I:9343;1307;The mix of characters are moving and the stories can make you think and make you cry.
I:9343;1308;Next to American Beauty this is my favorite film of 1999.
I:9343;1309;Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia is a brilliant film.
I:9343;1310;Anderson beautifully directs this film to perfection, and makes us want more.
I:9343;1311;This film will keep you hooked from the beginning to the final conclusion, and I highly recommend it if your a fan of Anderson's other 2 films.
I:9343;1312;also to be applauded is the music, by Aimee Mann.
I:9343;1313;He's saying that life mirrors nature.
I:9343;1314;that life's imperfections, indeosyncratic ripples, and poignant stories all interconnect and depend on one another.
I:9343;1315;Anyway, Aimee Mann's soundtrack caps of this fulfillment of one of the greatest motion pictures every made.
I:9343;1316;This film is emotionally charged, tapping into the strongest feelings that we have: love (whether it be heterosexual or homosexual), loss, and ultimately happiness and reconciliation.
I:9343;1317;I thought it was pretty clear what the climactic moment of the movie was (coughfrogscough).
I:9343;1318;another thing that Hoffman said was that he loved playing a good guy, someone with real morals and his ducks all in a row.
I:9343;1319;I admire Anderson for directly confronting this trait of our society.
I:9343;1320;so go watch all of your wonderfully hip stories of losses of innocence and sadness.
I:9343;1321;See if you get any emotional fulmillment.
I:9343;1322;The unusual narrative, which jumps from one storyline to the other, adds a lot to make magnolia a very special movie, certainly unlike any you've seen.
I:9343;1323;The mix of the stories is very well conducted, not rendering your mind useless if you blink, like other I've seen experiences on this area.
I:9343;1324;It'll stay on your mind, keeping you thinking, and soon you'll watch it again.
I:9343;1325;And you'll find it even more pleasant.
I:9343;1326;The movie is long, but will keep your mind's attention.
I:9343;1327;A good friend of mine reccomended this movie to me, telling me it was good.
I:9343;1328;The same goes for Unbreakable , which I thought was a genius film.
I:9343;1329;All of the charcters are very believable in the sense that their personality traits are very common, however beautiful or ugly they may be.
I:9343;1330;I personally HATE his idea, but it is the fact that he is a human being, and that nobody is perfect, that makes it believable.
I:9343;1331;The best scene in the movie, by far, is the universal singing scene.
I:9343;1332;That's one of the few scenes in a movie that has ever made my eyes fill with tears.
I:9343;1333;It wasn't sad, but it was just so powerful.
I:9343;1334;This film is a true piece of art.
I:9343;1335;This film is a true masterpiece.
I:9343;1336;I hope he knows that he has made one of the greatest films of all time.
I:9343;1337;This film changed my life, it is filled with ideas and stories and scenarios that you will most likely relate to yourself, at least with one of them, but this filmmaker masterfully crafts these multiple stories and characters and never leaves any of them hanging, they all have their voice heard and will have you discovering meaning with each additional viewing.
I:9343;1338;This movie held my interest, particularly because of the cast.
I:9343;1339;The acting was exceptional, though at times, I felt that maybe some of the performances were a bit over.
I:9343;1340;"Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Magnolia"" is a beautiful, breathtaking collage of a film, a rare three hour movie that doesn't seem it's length."
I:9343;1341;"Every scene matters, and the haunting music of Aimee Mann, whose ""Save Me"" was nominated for an Oscar, drives the film and gives it a unique grace."
I:9343;1342;Magnolia takes place on one eventful day in the lives of eight men and women living in California.
I:9343;1343;There are several themes that run through all of the stories, namely the search for real love, the death of fathers, misunderstood children, and the need for forgiveness.
I:9343;1344;ridden about her infidelity, and his estranged son (Tom Cruise) has become a popular sex self.
I:9343;1345;Claudia also begins a tenative relationship with a well.
I:9343;1346;"these characters and their stories all interconnect in surprising and moving ways, and ""Magnolia"" emerges as a study in human connection."
I:9343;1347;The performances are outstanding all around, with special credit going to Tom Cruise as the ferocious Frank Mackie, and Julianne Moore, whose Linda spends much of the film on the verge of a complete breakdown.
I:9343;1348;"John C. Reilly also impresses in a role that is a nice change from the clueless husband he played in ""The Good Girl"" and ""The Hours."""
I:9343;1349;Also noteworthy is the fantastic performance of Jason Robards, who conveys completely the slow, painful indignity of death.
I:9343;1350;Magnolia is a movie that may try your patience, and its last half hour has to be seen to be believed, but the acting and Paul Thomas Anderson's expert direction make it well worth your time.
I:9343;1351;The ending as well, is very dissapointing.
I:9343;1352;The acting, is top notch, by far.
I:9343;1353;Everybody (a very impressive cast) shines as an actor, and inspite of disliking this movie, I will see anything that PT Anderson does in the future.
I:9343;1354;He's young and filled with promise, and I am sure in the future he will outdo this movie.
I:9343;1355;Magnolia is one of my favorite movies of all time.
I:9343;1356;And the frog and Wise Up sing.
I:9343;1357;along scenes are a little hard to swallow at first, although Wise Up is one of my personal favorite parts of the movie and I've come to love the frogs, too.
I:9343;1358;You may end up hating it passionatly and thinking it's the worst piece of crap ever made, but on the other hand, you may discover an emotional, deeply moving, and beautiful movie.
I:9343;1359;Granted, this is a difficult movie to pace but it is done masterfully with an unbelievable score and soundtrack.
I:9343;1360;William H. Macy is one of the most underrated actors around.
I:9343;1361;both funny and very real in any movie that he's in.
I:9343;1362;Paul Thomas Anderson is a brilliant director, and possibly an even better screenwriter.
I:9343;1363;He will win two or three Oscars before he's done.
I:9343;1364;up to his very strong 1997 effort Boogie Nights (which launched the by now very successful film career of one.
I:9343;1365;mark Wahlberg) is a confident, brazenly directed piece of Altmanian.
I:9343;1366;scorseseness that keeps the tempo pounding, the effects coming, the actors Heroding, and the old melodrama successfully dripping for three or so odd hours.
I:9343;1367;It is brave, fearless, ambitious, gonzo filmmaking that puts most of 1999to shame, and seems alongside a movie like DiCaprio's The Beach (new on video this week) a dollar to a donut.
I:9343;1368;child genius (Macy) in love with a brawny bartender.
I:9343;1369;and part of the fun, ostensibly, is figuring out how they all connect in the end.
I:9343;1370;And connect, of course, they do, but to reveal these connections in this review is to disservice the film of one of its most effective powers.
I:9343;1371;but there are many powerful moments of acting and direction in Magnolia that I can mention.
I:9343;1372;rated Cabin Boy) then you really ought to tune in and watch her go.
I:9343;1373;Somehow, through her conviction and her commitment to the sometimes two.
I:9343;1374;The film's most memorable scenes (and for me, the most well.
I:9343;1375;PTA's camera work and editing are very distinctive.
I:9343;1376;The pace in TWBB, to its credit, is more stately.
I:9343;1377;"He also structures his films very well
I:9343;1378;Tom Cruise is really great in this, but he's done this so many times: the sleek ultra.
I:9343;1379;confident guy whose facade breaks down.
I:9343;1380;On the other it shows confidence and a willingness to embarrass yourself for the sake of good art.
I:9343;1381;i guess I see it as a necessary step towards TWBB.
I:9343;1382;I'm really excited about his new Scientology movie.
I:9343;1383;"But the deal with the frogs is this:They are of a class of events known as ""Fortean phenomena"", after Charles Fort, their first serious recorder."
I:9343;1384;"If you noticed this book on Jeremy Blackman's desk during the ""study hall"" scene, you're very, very good."
I:9343;1385;But I hope this helps the many viewers who found the climax repellent or perplexing.
I:9343;1386;Most of the characters are fascinating, and ultimately there are maybe too many stories going on.
I:9343;1387;The movie is in some ways a disappointment, but it's worth seeing for some individual scenes and knockout performances (Tom Cruise got an Oscar nomination and a lot of attention for his role, but the rest of the cast is just as good if not better, especially Julianne Moore, Jason Robards and William H. Macy).
I:9343;1388;There is minimal film grain, and the colors are clear and crisp.
I:9343;1389;There are multiple supplemental features including a feature length documentary on the film.
I:9343;1390;while I enjoyed parts of the film, its not something I will probably care to watch again.
I:9343;1391;From a visual standpoint, the film is well made.
I:9343;1392;line is original and intriguing.
I:9343;1393;ray itself works great, but the sad fact remains that in spite of the film's interesting set.
I:9343;1394;But all of them will cross paths, some in tragic ways, but all in redemption for a new look at what tomorrow will bring.
I:9343;1395;Magnolia is a great film with an excellent cast.
I:9343;1396;Director P. t Anderson (Boogie Nights) brings a film with ragged emotions, romantic dreams and generational termoil to a cinematic masterpiece.
I:9343;1397;The way P. t. Anderson directs this film is brilliant.
I:9343;1398;An excellent cast with a crafty director shows why this film was nominated at both the Golden Globes and the Academy Awards.
I:9343;1399;Tom Cruise give a more than Oscar worthy performance.
I:9343;1400;Other notably great performances come from Macy, Moore and Hoffman.
I:9343;1401;Probably my favorite PT Anderson movie.
I:9343;1402;For the person, however, who wishes to witness a genius filmmaker at his best, P. t. Anderson's Magnolia is perfect.
I:9343;1403;The characters have great depth and the film moves effortlessly between stories, picking up the pace and slowing it down at just the right spots.
I:9343;1404;A film can only earn that kind of emotion with fine writing, a great performance, and well.
I:9343;1405;The actors are all terrific in their handed roles but the roles themselves are idiotic.
I:9343;1406;rain in the end is good but it won't save the movie.
I:9343;1407;The star above is for that rain.
I:9343;1408;Tom cruise is the best part.
I:9343;1409;So the movie started with quite a promising introduction .
I:9343;1410;it's gonna be good, I said to myself.
I:9343;1411;One hour into it I was thinking it is a bit slow, but there will be a great twist at the end to tie it all up, right?
I:9343;1412;"Yes, I did like Jason Robards' Philip Seymour Hoffman's parts
I:9343;1413;pta is his genreation's altman.
I:9343;1414;Anderson is great at moving the camera, and he has a good eye for lighting and composition.
I:9343;1415;He would make a wonderful commercial director.
I:9343;1416;And the special effects during the EVENT are a lot of fun to watch.
I:9343;1417;After watching this film I really appreciated what Robert Altman accomplished with Short Cuts .
I:9343;1418;the movie start out with characters living their own lives and cleverly weaves them all together eventually leading to this weird ending.
I:9343;1419;I personally think it's a great movie.
I:9343;1420;"If your writer/ director, Paul Thomas Anderson you create a brilliant three hour opus titled ""Magnolia"", involving a television quiz show and nine desperate, lonely, interelated characters."
I:9343;1421;Some characters are intricately involved with the show, while others have a fleeting connection.
I:9343;1422;P. t. Anderson has crafted and structured an amazing film.
I:9343;1423;The wonderful script is brought to life by a great ensemble cast.
I:9343;1424;But to be honest all the actors give fantastic performances.
I:9343;1425;special note should also be made for the wonderful soundtrack made up of songs written and sung by music artist, Aimee Mann.
I:9343;1426;It has a wonderful clear picture and sound.
I:9343;1427;There is a whole second disc packed with extras including an hour and a half, detailed, video diary of the making of the film.
I:9343;1428;time favorite movie and I have been unable to find it anywhere else!
I:9343;1429;Positives of this movie: Great acting.
I:9343;1430;What happened to the quiz show kid and the quiz show host?It was a fun movie to follow, but I can't begin to understand what it was all about!
I:9343;1431;So many interwoven stories beautifully told.
I:9343;1432;Beautifully acted, and beautifully shot.
I:9343;1433;I would recommend this movie for sure.
I:9343;1434;This movie is a total piece of.
I:9343;1435;The director is so self important.
I:9343;1436;The director, Paul Thomas Anderson, creates a quickly moving film, where every character is developed thoroughly.
I:9343;1437;A long movie, that dives deep into the heart of everyone who watches it.
I:9343;1438;Cruise by far steps out of his comfort zone in his role as Frank TJ Mackey, and he does a superb job in capturing the character.
I:9343;1439;Tom is my favorite actor, and when it comes to a role like this, it couldn't get any better.
I:9343;1440;Even braver and deeper emotionally than Paul Thomas Anderson'swonderful 'Boogie Nights', and in some ways a more mature, if lessblazingly dynamic work.
I:9343;1441;Full of amazing shots, amazing performances.
I:9343;1442;layered film 'Short Cuts' wanted to be.
I:9343;1443;I appreciate the ideas behind it, but it's an ending that'sless emotional than the film that proceeded it.
I:9343;1444;This is one of the greatest movies ever!
I:9343;1445;Paul Thomas Anderson is a rare talent.
I:9343;1446;His 3rd film was in my opinion his best so far.
I:9343;1447;It's hard to describe Anderson's genius in words, but all it takes is one look at his work to see it.
I:9343;1448;Look at this, Boogie Nights and Punch Drunk Love in particular for a unique movie making style.
I:9343;1449;They both should have won Oscars for their work.
I:9343;1450;The whole part leading up to the frog scene with all of the actors singing along to the similarly great and under rated talent, Aimee Mann, just had me mesmerized.
I:9343;1451;There is a great movie making diary and some other wonderful features on the 2 disc set.
I:9343;1452;That was the reaction of many to this odd yet intregueing film.
I:9343;1453;Mr. Anderson did a superb job in the first half.
I:9343;1454;This introduction to film had some meaning to the theme of the film (chance and coincidence).
I:9343;1455;Many of us thought the end of the movie would have explained the answer to question the begining gave.
I:9343;1456;plots, by Mr. Anderson, lead us closer and closer to a point in which all these ideas become completely intertwind.
I:9343;1457;The tension in each story continues to built.
I:9343;1458;And just as there is one final piece to be added to the puzzle, Mr. Anderson 'knocks over the table'.
I:9343;1459;With possibly the dumbest ending in movie history.
I:9343;1460;And we only got a small glimpse of the characters past life.
I:9343;1461;This was probably Cruise's best performance yet, hence the nomination.
I:9343;1462;I did happen to like certain aspects of it and liked certain characters more than others.
I:9343;1463;A lot of movies seem to want explore this degree of separation theory.
I:9343;1464;I reply, It's a story of chance and coincidence in the San Fernando Valley with a romance at its heart.
I:9343;1465;This is rather vague and broad, but it is intriguing to the moviegoers.
I:9343;1466;I do warn them that Tom Cruise's character, Frank T. j. Mackey, has some very graphic and harsh dialogue, and that the running time is long, but I would say that ninety percent of the audience walks out happy having seen such a beautiful film.
I:9343;1467;The TV game show is at an exciting point in its run for a new group of Kids led by Stanley Spector (Jeremy Blackman) is close to breaking the record for consecutive wins held by former quiz kid Donnie Smith (William H. Macy).
I:9343;1468;It is their romance which I feel is central to the film.
I:9343;1469;what does happen is a painfully brilliant and heartbreaking story of love, coincidence and redemption.
I:9343;1470;the whole film is told through constant cross cutting between stories and interactions.
I:9343;1471;For the first two thirds of the film there is always some form of music the pictures are set to, be it the score or rock songs.
I:9343;1472;The director has learned a lot of his show.
I:9343;1473;"offy technique from Martin Scorsese and Robert Altman
I:9343;1474;a great foundation for a director.
I:9343;1475;In his previous film, Boogie Nights, the director just seemed to be quoting those two, but in this present film, he has found his own style and rhythm.
I:9343;1476;His ear for dialogue is great, he elicits great performances from his actors and knows how to make every minute count.
I:9343;1477;Paul Thomas Anderson is completely enamored with everything in this film.
I:9343;1478;It showed me that I should remember the small things, that love isn't as hard as it may seem to find, and that I need to know somebody loves me back and I should accept their love.
I:9343;1479;This may sound like the lovelorn teenager in me, but I feel it to be true.
I:9343;1480;This is my kind of romance film.
I:9343;1481;This movie is worth seeing, simply because you have never seen anything like it.
I:9343;1482;Anderson jumps from story to story, weaving a quilt that casts a sad spell over the viewer.
I:9343;1483;i liked this movie much more the second time I saw it.
I:9343;1484;The second time I saw it I had digested the style and come to appreciate it and could concentrate a little more on the stories.
I:9343;1485;There is also the wonderful Aimee Mann soundtrack .
I:9343;1486;There are some snippets of dialogue that come right out of the Aimee Mann songs.
I:9343;1487;He was very intrigued by the storyline.
I:9343;1488;He's interested in screenplay writing.
I:9343;1489;What can I say about this movie, it's Altmanesque, it is a series of small stories that move towards a common denouement.
I:9343;1490;John C. Reilly is fantastic as an L. a. cop who gives us a stream of consciousness monologue reminiscent of a bad episode of _Cops_.
I:9343;1491;Tom Cruise is equally fantastic as a misogynistic huckster selling a dating video for men called Seduce and Destroy .
I:9343;1492;Cruise's acting is fantastic in this movie, I know, I used the word acting in sentence with Tom Cruise's name, and not in a negative fashion, but he's good, damned good, showing us a misogynistic thug who is deeply damaged and hurt inside due to a childhood betrayal.
I:9343;1493;Juliette Moore is excellent as gold.
I:9343;1494;it is just beautifully cathartic.
I:9343;1495;the acting is incomparable to anything.
I:9343;1496;it is just utter beauty.
I:9343;1497;this is certainly one of the most beautiful masterpieces of our time.
I:9343;1498;i guess you prefer Steven Seagal than good filmmaking.
I:9343;1499;i will only tell you i felt crushed when this gem was actually over.
I:9343;1500;Paul Thomas Anderson is absolutely brilliant.
I:9343;1501;The idea of taking an artist's music and basing a movie on it is one of the most creative things I have ever seen.
I:9343;1502;One of the best movies ever, it was all I could think about for the next two weeks.
I:9343;1503;engrossing, good plot, well acted, all in all a great movie!
I:9343;1504;I was also pleasantly surprised to see that Tom Cruise can actually act (who knew?)
I:9343;1505;, and his scenes are some of the most hilarious that I have ever seen.
I:9343;1506;personally, I would award Julianne Moore a lifetime achievement award for over acting, and Magnolia only adds to her body of work, but Cruise, as usual, is riveting and spell binding.
I:9343;1507;Manolia just tries way to hard to be thought provoking and quirky but it's still draws you in.
I:9343;1508;PT Anderson outdid himself with this one.
I:9343;1509;these all occur in symphonic unison, which is further illustrated by brilliant editing, scoring, and a kind of titling of chapters.
I:9343;1510;performance: Anderson provokes electric, powerful performances from the entire cast.
I:9343;1511;And, dare I say, the happy coincidences of life.
I:9343;1512;over all, this is a stunning film.
I:9343;1513;And that, my friends, is true theatrical cinema.
I:9343;1514;But it was worth it.
I:9343;1515;"paul Thomas Anderson's film ""Magnolia"" is a movie about the inter."
I:9343;1516;twinning lives of a handful of characters in Los Angeles on one day.
I:9343;1517;The film uses the characters and their lives to question coincidence and the order of the universe in a way but beyond all that it is another rich, multi.
I:9343;1518;the acting in this film is among the best in 1999.
I:9343;1519;paul Thomas Anderson's directing is incredible.
I:9343;1520;He gives the movie a perfect feel and never over sentimentalizes anything.
I:9343;1521;He just shows us raw, human emotion as he sees it and the result is overwhelming.
I:9343;1522;"The beginning sequence about coincidence is great
I:9343;1523;The film is quite arty so I wouldn't recommend it to the blockbuster summer movie crowd but to anyone who loves a profound, high.
I:9343;1524;I usually enjoy ferociously original films that are a bit too raw or honest for the masses.
I:9343;1525;Altough through the course of the film, we meet interesting, honest people and get to enjoy Mann's haunting songs along the trip, I wasn't fulfilled.
I:9343;1526;William H. a comedic star from things like Mystery Man plays a weird guy, he does it well, I love the part where he gets drunk and begins to throw his weight about .
I:9343;1527;Hoffman is brilliant, he plays a likeable character and does it well he may grow up to be as good as his dad yet this film does him justice, but he'll need to do something pretty good to catch up with Dustin.
I:9343;1528;A very satisfying movie with powerful performances by Jason Robards, Tom Cruise, and Philip Seymour Hoffman.
I:9343;1529;This drama is exactly the way a great dramatic movie should be, which is best illustrated through the good acting and characters that play and fit the roles perfectly, and the mosaic style of the scenes is quite engrossing.
I:9343;1530;magnolia is a rare breed that actually effects the viewers emotions and causes a person to think.
I:9343;1531;the true definition of a drama.
I:9343;1532;that I am positive you will enjoy.
I:9343;1533;it is a masterpiece .
I:9343;1534;I have watched it about a dozen times and everytime it brings home a new meaning.
I:9343;1535;It is probably one of those rare movies where all the actors and actresses gave their life time best performance .
I:9343;1536;it is about our life .
I:9343;1537;we look for help and sometimes we get that help.
I:9343;1538;If you ever have had a tough life then you will find a rare connection with a Hollywood movie and fall in love with it.
I:9343;1539;child relationships set in modern California has some good things going for it.
I:9343;1540;the directing by Paul Thomas Anderson (of Boogie Nights fame) is superb.
I:9343;1541;Each part was meaty, giving the actor ultimate opportunity to showcase his or her ability.
I:9343;1542;It's as if the writer wanted to create good roles, and he certainly did.
I:9343;1543;Specifically, the roles for aging men were outstanding.
I:9343;1544;the music was well used too, sometimes introduced discordantly, creating and enhancing the several themes.
I:9343;1545;and, after all the buildup and tension and fine acting performances, about three quarters into the movie, all the characters broke into a song which was totally out of place.
I:9343;1546;this film is an intense emotional experience and will undoubtedly have several well.
I:9343;1547;YOU MUST SEE THIS FILM!
I:9343;1548;something like that happens in (and to) MAGNOLIA, the new film by the madly ambitious Paul Thomas Anderson (BOOGIE NIGHTS).
I:9343;1549;Anderson loves the bullying CONTROL of being a movie director.
I:9343;1550;"Anderson is more gentle
I:9343;1551;"anderson busily sets up many ""literary"" parallels."
I:9343;1552;MAGNOLIA is like a season's worth of soap.
I:9343;1553;opera vignettes, acted vigorously by a sincere cast.
I:9343;1554;"talent
I:9343;1555;He has a genuine gift for melancholy, and some of the pieces of MAGNOLIA are first.
I:9343;1556;"But this film and BOOGIE NIGHTS keep veering between wildly contrasting moods: dynamic energy and sodden depression
I:9343;1557;it's got everything and is presented artfully.
I:9343;1558;Just get it and watch it with an open heart.
I:9343;1559;This odd and touching movie by Paul Thomas Anderson is a treat for anyone who is willing to give up three hours and apply themselves (yes, that is the word) to this at times disjointed, disturbing, and ultimately enlightening film.
I:9343;1560;acted by a score of extremely talented actors, some known and some not so well known, the movie is a series of scenes from the lives of several people.
I:9343;1561;There are many more amazing and enjoyable characters, literally too many to mention here, although I would like to.
I:9343;1562;One of the best acted and most gripping scenes at the beginning is never followed up on!
I:9343;1563;And toward the end of the film, a surreal, post.
I:9343;1564;This is the best movie ever made.
I:9343;1565;Here is how to enjoy the film.1 .
I:9343;1566;this moment, a moment of grace, is the real message of the movie.
I:9343;1567;"Rather, marvel at the shadowed parallels in the character's lives
I:9343;1568;as you walk away your mind plays with the richness of the details and the power of the craftsmanship of the director and actors.
I:9343;1569;"Esoteric films like Magnolia are often judged largely on a basis of stylistic merit
I:9343;1570;for that reason, I'm honestly confused by why it is I loved this movie so much.
I:9343;1571;there's some interesting stuff here.
I:9343;1572;I nary gave a thought regarding style during the films entire length, but obviously something was done to make this Magnolia great, because my attention was fixed on the intricate weaves of emotion that sluice the film.
I:9343;1573;The movie has a quiet layer of psychological and emotional intensity that is powerful, yet it remains indefinable to me.
I:9343;1574;i attribute this film's greatness to the sterling performances of the talented coterie of actors formed around the singular vision of Paul Thomas Anderson.
I:9343;1575;The characters aren't likable people, but wow, they are presented with remarkable acuity.
I:9343;1576;Tom Cruise's performance is especially powerful.
I:9343;1577;Cruise is not a favorite of mine, but when he's good, he's very good.
I:9343;1578;Yet this is one of the movie's greatest merits, as it underscores the elusive theme of subtle determinism and random correspondence.
I:9343;1579;although it might seem pointless and dumb, the movie has an operatic flair and grandiosity that eludes so many others.
I:9343;1580;There is an ineffable magic to this film.
I:9343;1581;"This is not for everyone
I:9343;1582;finally, the sound Magnolia is incredible.
I:9343;1583;I was awed by the astonishing clarity of the bullet tearing through the foliage during the action scene.
I:9343;1584;It is a movie that only certain people will enjoy.
I:9343;1585;The movie has both comedy and poignant scenes as the vignettes strive to gain your interest.
I:9343;1586;Tales of chance, coincidence, and someone met someone's so and so lead a group through tales of forgiveness.
I:9343;1587;It is therein the beauty of the story lies.
I:9343;1588;Magnolia is possibly the best film of the 90'es.
I:9343;1589;The ending is one of the most unpredicable ending's in movie history.
I:9343;1590;thats what movies are all about unpredicable,good acting,good story,good cinematography,and good direction and magnolia has it all.
I:9343;1591;Despite the fact that his next film supposedly stars Adam Sandler, Anderson is also probably one of this best filmmakers in this generation, too.
I:9343;1592;Magnolia is a good movie, however I do have a few arguments about it.
I:9343;1593;The life experience of Black.
I:9343;1594;At the begining you may find the plot a little confuse, but after some minutes you will watch a video that is really amazing.
I:9343;1595;the film has really a brilliant argument and it is the kind of story you hardly ever see on TV.
I:9343;1596;The characters, the soundtrack, every little moment is incredible.
I:9343;1597;There is a so nice scene when all the characters, living in the same neighbourhood sing sequences of the song performed by Aimee.
I:9343;1598;All the characters are essential to build the plot.
I:9343;1599;P. t. Anderson has created one of the most compelling films in the last two decades with his MAGNOLIA.
I:9343;1600;Anyway, Anderson fleshes out each character, with the help of some brilliant acting (John C. Reilly is again a stand.
I:9343;1601;Beyond that, each story line is compelling, and interweaved with a delightful abandon, I love the opening five minutes with its frantic pace.
I:9343;1602;"As I said the acting is brilliant, with one exception
I:9343;1603;My hat's off to Anderson for this epic undertaking, and I look forward to his next.
I:9343;1604;released this movie with a commentary track by the director and possibly the cast.
I:9343;1605;Yes, this was my favorite film of 1999.
I:9343;1606;This film is absolutely a piece of brilliance.
I:9343;1607;This was by far the best acting for a cast of this size in a number of years.
I:9343;1608;They do their best work for him and they give the audience their best.
I:9343;1609;If your intelligence is only for popcorn films then please stay away from this one.
I:9343;1610;Thank you Mr. Anderson for giving us something special for years to come.
I:9343;1611;the documentary is definately solid and gives us an exhausting look on the grueling work behind the making of the film.
I:9343;1612;He's a funny guy who can't control his swearing sometimes, but he's the kind of director that gets right into the action of each shot, wanting to be right there with the character.
I:9343;1613;released Boogie Nights with a better edition and expanded commentary.
I:9343;1614;oh yeah, the picture and sound was very good.
I:9343;1615;In fact, it detracts from the film.
I:9343;1616;I liked, Magnolia but even though it's 3 in a half hours it's good.
I:9343;1617;In retrospect I should've given it 3 stars, that's as high as I'm willing to go with this.
I:9343;1618;On the plus, it has a really great soundtrack.
I:9343;1619;The scene where the actors sing along was pretty cool and the direction was very energetic.
I:9343;1620;Phillip Seymour Hoffman said in an interview that Magnolia, in which he acted, was his favorite movie of all time.
I:9343;1621;All in good time that will be made clear.
I:9343;1622;the script is great, but Anderson has also put together a fantastic cast to bring it to life.
I:9343;1623;John C. Reilly, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Philip Baker Hall are some of the best character actors around and they just light up the screen.
I:9343;1624;it's so hard to review this film, simply because it is told in such a unique way.
I:9343;1625;All of the characters are connected to one another in some way shape and form and Anderson uses a variety of styles to tell the story.
I:9343;1626;This movie is funny, sad, poignant, and absurd.
I:9343;1627;It's simply one of those films that you'll be talking about days after seeing it, still trying to put all the pieces together.
I:9343;1628;Overall, this film is a movie lover's feast.
I:9343;1629;A feast full of rich a delectable tastes.
I:9343;1630;Magnolia is a long film at 3 hours but well worth it.
I:9343;1631;otherwise you will be disapointed.
I:9343;1632;This movie also will take a little bit of thinking on your part during as well as after.
I:9343;1633;In the end youll either love it,or you will curse the day you ever thought of seeing it(and ask yourself why you listen to me).
I:9343;1634;I also remembering thinking how much it was worth it.
I:9343;1635;But for those with a mind for film, for great, grandiose pictures, this is the pinnacle.
I:9343;1636;I liked Boogie Nights, but P. t. Anderson hit it out the park with Magnolia.
I:9343;1637;The ensemble cast is superb (especially John C. Reilly, William H. Macy, and Philip Seymour Hoffman), the interweaving storylines are impeccably done, the integrated soundtrack by Aimee Mann gives it a haunting ambiance, and the overall feel of the movie is just golden.
I:9343;1638;It has since become one of my favorite movies and is one which I definitely recommend one see at home as opposed to in the theater.
I:9343;1639;I recommend this not only for the opportunity it offers to get one's head together but because it will allow you to discuss the film with whoever you happen to be watching it with or at least give some thought to what is being said and what is being done if you happen to be on your own.
I:9343;1640;Hopefully Mr. Anderson will take a lesson next time and go ahead and tack on an extra ten or fifteen minutes to allow his audience a chance at some digestion.
I:9343;1641;Magnolia which was written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, is a landmark in film.
I:9343;1642;It's more than just a movie.
I:9343;1643;It's a concept and it's a way of thinking.
I:9343;1644;Full on symbolism, repeating themes, great character developement and wonderful direction, this film is a pure pleasure to watch.
I:9343;1645;the cast is simply incredible.
I:9343;1646;Hoffman, Macy, Moore, Cruise, Reiley all shine, just to name a few.
I:9343;1647;Aimee Mann also puts together one of the best soundtracks for any film to date.
I:9343;1648;If you saw this movie and got nothing out of it, watch it again.
I:9343;1649;Paul Thomas Anderson is a director with nothing but a bright future ahead of him.
I:9343;1650;With the sprawling and ambitious Magnolia, writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson establishes himself as one of the most gifted film makers of his generation.
I:9343;1651;Over three hours long, the movie will prove too much for some viewers, but I found this look at a day in the lives of some San Fernando Valley residents to be fascinating.
I:9343;1652;magnolia was passed over at the Oscars this year, though there are a number of award winning performances.
I:9343;1653;much has been made of the movie's startling and unconventional ending.
I:9343;1654;I thought it was perfect, though many people disagree.
I:9343;1655;"I saw this film a few years ago in the theatre and approached it as another Hollywood ""entertainment"" piece."
I:9343;1656;some important tips for watching this masterpiece: Pay close attention to the cop.
I:9343;1657;He is actually a christ figure.
I:9343;1658;simple but a truly good person who never loses his faith even when he undegoes an embarrassing ordeal.
I:9343;1659;Ultimately he delivers the lines on forgiveness at the story's climax.
I:9343;1660;entities independent of love and pain and not needing of forgiveness or spirituality.
I:9343;1661;"truly refreshing in the face of such garbage as ""American Beauty."""
I:9343;1662;There is a lot of love.
I:9343;1663;star rating speaks to how I feel about it.
I:9343;1664;Instead, I hope that people will look at these situations and apply them to their own lives.
I:9343;1665;The emotions are real, even if the roles or performers are not.
I:9343;1666;Of the unexpected, which you may find out if you read other reviews, well, my opinion is that it was an important part.
I:9343;1667;Think of how you met your partner, friend, job, etc., there is probably something that happened to you due to just pure luck.
I:9343;1668;Watch this with an open mind, at home, with a friend or two.
I:9343;1669;Hopefully this works for you when you watch it.
I:9343;1670;Magnolic is going to go down in history as one of the top 10 movies of the 20th century.
I:9343;1671;And for all the people that want an interesting movie, you will get your money's worth.
I:9343;1672;I really love this movie, i think i can't add anyhing that hasn't been said about it.
I:9343;1673;When I see it again on blu.
I:9343;1674;ray, I feel like watch it on new experience.
I:9343;1675;the story never dies, it's so real, even now.
I:9343;1676;ray is the best format to show it beautifully on your home cinema.
I:9343;1677;But Magnolia is a very emotional film.
I:9343;1678;The performances in the movie are wonderful.
I:9343;1679;Jon Brion's score is amazing, perhaps the most importnat aspect of the film.
I:9343;1680;It sets the pace, and creates the mood.
I:9343;1681;Of course, we know how wonderful Aimee Mann did on her songs.
I:9343;1682;This is one of the best stories of the last couple of years.
I:9343;1683;all of the actors are playing their best role in this movie.
I:9343;1684;Every item, every shot means something for the story.
I:9343;1685;great movie, great story, see it.
I:9343;1686;And I'd also like an explanation about the frogs.
I:9343;1687;There's enough going on to keep my interest through a couple of viewings already, and I'd watch it again.
I:9343;1688;known actors give strong performances, and the movie is visually intriguing, if rather dark.
I:9343;1689;I liked Magnolia , it's has just the right mix of realism and wierdness to keep my interest, and the fact that there didn't seem to be any point doesn't bother me at all.
I:9343;1690;so, if you loved anderon's other film boogie nights, then you'll love this film.
I:9343;1691;"Hall's character is the first of several to make this loose and indicative religious quote in ""Magnolia,"" a film so emotionally complex, alarmingly twisting, and arrestingly original that it should be marked as the last truly great film of the 1990's."
I:9343;1692;"As mundane as that appears, ""Magnolia"" is so inventive that it towers to become much, much more than it sounds."
I:9343;1693;being a movie with many diverse characters, it includes a very fine.
I:9343;1694;on top of these main players, there are yet more.
I:9343;1695;The film opens with a surreal examination of chance that sets us up for the series of occurrences and collisions that take place between all these people in the day the film takes place.
I:9343;1696;It would be criminal to go into the film in any more detail, for the turmoil, psychological manipulation, and powerful sequences it holds need to be experienced first.
I:9343;1697;director, writer, and producer Paul Thomas Anderson is emerging as one of the most creative and articulate forces in Hollywood.
I:9343;1698;Anderson seems to have a knack for building impressive, cohesive ensemble casts, and this is certainly no exception.
I:9343;1699;a very compelling element of the film is the soundtrack, almost all of which is tackled by the brilliant songwriter Aimee Mann and her sometimes.
I:9343;1700;Mann's sharp music lends a stunning vulnerability to the story, but Anderson is not content at just dropping songs into his film for atmosphere.
I:9343;1701;"Mann's songs actually helped Anderson to compose some of the characters in the story, and several songs are used to very poignant and unique effect at key points in the film
I:9343;1702;"Somehow, that blunt description evolved into the towering, psychological, profound, brutally bold work of art and reflection of life that is called ""Magnolia."""
I:9343;1703;An exhilerating journey into the tangled wrecks of these beautifully deep, traumatised characters.
I:9343;1704;"i was entranced for the duration
I:9343;1705;The beautiful soundtrack, acting as the distraction that we all have in our minds, when events take over our thoughts.
I:9343;1706;The performance of each character was as soul.
I:9343;1707;searching as possible, and each character found themselves in the unpredictable situations that life can present, given one small change to the fragile formula of our lives.
I:9343;1708;You bet., life is full of it.
I:9343;1709;you will miss the point, and rate it one star.
I:9343;1710;a magic and unforgettable all time favorite.
I:9343;1711;An absolute masterpiece, which will provide you with hours of thoughts, long after the credits have rolled.
I:9343;1712;He uses Altman alumni in his cast as an homage, including Nashville veterans Michael Murphy and Henry Gibson (the latter is particularly good as a cynical world.
I:9343;1713;the film is wildly ambitious but doesn't entirely succeed, as a recent revisiting demonstrated to me.
I:9343;1714;Anderson probably started from the central, haunting and Biblical image of a rain of frogs and saw it as a way to tie these stories together in thematic unity.
I:9343;1715;The frog sequence IS magical and has always astonished me, and I imagine even those who find this the most boring movie they've ever seen suddenly perked up when they saw this sequence.
I:9343;1716;Henry Gibson deserves note for helping to keep afloat his scenes with Macy as a self.
I:9343;1717;I follow anything he does and think There Will Be Blood is one of the great American films.
I:9343;1718;Altman is a filmmaker whose works I can appreciate as I get older because they are born from experience.
I:9343;1719;This is a character focussed movie in the spirit of Boogie Nights or Nashville.
I:9343;1720;but the pacing is great and the stories unfold and intertwine very beautifully.
I:9343;1721;The ensemble cast is unbelievable in depth and talent and this film may very well be Tom Cruise's tour de force role.
I:9343;1722;its a two tape long movie but its great and its actors do good.
I:9343;1723;the end with all the frogs was unexpected fot me and it was hilarious to see that, its rainging frogs damnit!!!
I:9343;1724;Tom Cruise delivers the powerfullest performance in here as the son of a dying father and he confronts his father in tape two.
I:9343;1725;the relationship bewteen Melora Walters and John C. Reilly is oddly likable.
I:9343;1726;drunk Love and Boogie Nights I recommend too
I:9343;1727;Very rarely does a film like this come by.
I:9343;1728;"evaluate it after seeing P. t. Anderson's masterpiece, ""Punch."
I:9343;1729;I was already impressed with Sandler long before that movie, so I decided to re.
I:9343;1730;It all takes place in the time frame of one day, and with that day comes revelations, strange situations, confessions, and redemption.
I:9343;1731;"It really reminds you of the power that took place in Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction."""
I:9343;1732;He was able to make a very complex film that doesn't have to revolve around plot.
I:9343;1733;The writing and directing was really amazing.
I:9343;1734;That's right: 3 HOURS LONG!
I:9343;1735;It's a very depressing and tragic movie, but it is done in such an impressive and unique way.
I:9343;1736;This is a film that you will either love it, or you will hate it.
I:9343;1737;I really did enjoy it more the second time around.
I:9343;1738;Now, I was able to let it soak inside my mind and fully appreciate it for what it was.
I:9343;1739;"friendly film
I:9343;1740;Maybe this is a film that the more you see it, the more you appreciate it.
I:9343;1741;A very, VERY impressive film from Mr. Anderson, indeed.
I:9343;1742;To its credit this is an engrossing marvelously directed film that sucks the viewer in and refuses to let go.
I:9343;1743;It is also one of the best cast and acted movies I've ever seen.
I:9343;1744;The performances aren't great in that grand over the top way where everyone says What a great performance!
I:9343;1745;The perfromaces are great in that you forget that you are watching actors and start to believe that the characters you see are real people.
I:9343;1746;Early on, there was fierce discussion, pro and con, about the merits of this film.
I:9343;1747;less settled down now and knowledgeable film buffs seem to agree that this is a gem of a movie.
I:9343;1748;And I dont agree with some of the reviewers that this is an artsy.
I:9343;1749;For my part, I love classic action films and American movies, in general.
I:9343;1750;While this is not simply an action movie, it is a VERY excellent movie and already is considered a classic film.
I:9343;1751;It is filled with exquisite performances by some of my favorite actors, folks like William H. Macy, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and of course, Tom Cruise and Julianne Moore.
I:9343;1752;In fact, it is fascinating and it would appear that the cast was inspired, through and through.
I:9343;1753;It is one of the very few movies that I enjoy seeing again.
I:9343;1754;It was the first of it's kind and a masterpiece.
I:9343;1755;Tom Cruise's performance is worth the price of admission.
I:9343;1756;Each performance is an actor's showcase.
I:9343;1757;P. t. Anderson has created in Magnolia a modern masterpiece.
I:9343;1758;"The ensemble cast is amazing
I:9343;1759;My favorite performances, though, are carry.
I:9343;1760;overs from Anderson's last film, Boogie Nights.
I:9343;1761;The pathos and humanity that William H. Macy and Julianne Moore bring to their respective roles are astonishing.
I:9343;1762;Chance and relationships connect all the characters lives.
I:9343;1763;They are each uniquely, touchingly, humanly, even beautifully flawed (some more so than others).
I:9343;1764;while some have found the storm near the end ridiculous or even pretentious, I thought it was brilliant and somehow fitting.
I:9343;1765;good movie of the year, it is nonetheless among the best of the year.
I:9343;1766;P. t. Anderson continues to demonstrate unique and honest talent, if not near.
I:9343;1767;There are scenes, and lines, in Magnolia that will stay with me for the rest of my life.
I:9343;1768;"Aimee Mann singing ""Wise Up"" and ""Save Me""."
I:9343;1769;"Policeman Jim Kurring saying ""Sometimes people need a little help."
I:9343;1770;But if you can forgive someone, well, that's the tough part.
I:9343;1771;This is the most deeply human movie I have ever experienced.
I:9343;1772;if you can appreciate that a movie can touch your heart, can be something more than just simple entertainment, and can actually say something both simple and profound about the human condition, then you will love Magnolia.
I:9343;1773;And yet, through all of this there is a beacon of hope and redemption that shines through, and most of the characters do find the strength to carry on.
I:9343;1774;Watching Magnolia is like having an entire lifetime's worth of powerful emotions crammed into a three hour movie.
I:9343;1775;If you have an open mind, and an open heart, you must see this movie.
I:9343;1776;I loved every minute of it.
I:9343;1777;I regret only going to see it twice in the theatre, but it was just such a heavy revelation to digest.
I:9343;1778;There are so many neat subliminal nuances in this film, so much ultra.
I:9343;1779;phenomenal acting, and such a dynamic music score as well as the best damned real.
I:9343;1780;"julianne Moore is immaculate, John C. Reilly is Thee Mann, Jeremy Blackman makes that Sixth Sense kid Osment seem average, Philip Baker Hall
I:9343;1781;Tom Cruise made a fan of me because of his Oscar.
I:9343;1782;William H. Macy, what a great character performer.
I:9343;1783;This is THE best ever ensemble movie.
I:9343;1784;out astounding piece of work.
I:9343;1785;Its extra features were quite satisfying.
I:9343;1786;It is raw and impactful.
I:9343;1787;The herb magnolia is actually a lung.
I:9343;1788;discer also has a delightful slew of cool trailers and a hilarious infomercial amongst its many treats.
I:9343;1789;Now I work at a video store, and Magnolia still being a fresh release plucked from our shelves, I hear feedback on it most every day.
I:9343;1790;And hopefully most of them learn throughout this single day that:.
I:9343;1791;it is a powerful messageIn the end, as Officer Jim Kurring tells us in his voice over narration Sometimes people need a little help.
I:9343;1792;It is a powerful film.
I:9343;1793;And it is worth three hours to see that smile and know what it means.
I:9343;1794;Magnolia is on par with his previous effort Boogie Nights another excellent film.
I:9343;1795;As you watch this movie it engulfs you in its intricate plot.
I:9343;1796;I never knew what was going to happen next but I wanted to keep watching because the characters were so interesting, especially Tom Cruise's character T. j. Mackey who gives an astounding performance and should have won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, not Michael Caine.
I:9343;1797;This movie also has other great performances by Julliane Moore, Phillip Baker Hall and many others who were also in Boogie Nights .
I:9343;1798;this movie is very fast.
I:9343;1799;paced and has a lot of characters.
I:9343;1800;this movie is very interesting, but long, so people who don't like long movies might want to think twice before sitting down to watch it.
I:9343;1801;paced movies, this is for you.
I:9343;1802;It will make you laugh, it will make you cry, and it will make you think.
I:9343;1803;welcome to Magnolia, one of the most unique and rewarding filmgoing experiences you will ever have.
I:9343;1804;"Like Boogie Nights, the previous effort from director P. t. Anderson (and don't think the P. t. nickname is useless
I:9343;1805;good mess in the wrong hands, strikes just the right note of love's beauty.
I:9343;1806;the excessive length, the endlessly moving and zooming camera work, to name two.
I:9343;1807;including the wonderful work from the cast (especially from Tom Cruise).
I:9343;1808;is so fascinating, fresh, and genuine, that you can't help but be swept up in it.
I:9343;1809;"invest some time, and an open mind, in this film and you may well have a truly unique film experience
I:9343;1810;They are an escape, a way for someone to make their own conclusions about the incidents both in the film, and in their own lives.
I:9343;1811;Just like a painting, film is an art form.
I:9343;1812;this is right about where Paul Thomas Anderson comes into play.
I:9343;1813;A brilliant writer/director, he had his beginning with the little known movie, Hard Eight.
I:9343;1814;Afterwards, he became strongly credited for his fascinating work in the masterpiece Boogie Nights.
I:9343;1815;P. t. knows his characters well enough to be able to make their actions forgivable, and knows how to make them utterly realistic.
I:9343;1816;moving camera technique to show how incredibly detailed and expansive his worlds are.
I:9343;1817;The range of emotions that these people face are incredible, and the entire movie will, quite simply be, the most emotionally exhausting 3 hours of your life.
I:9343;1818;one of the best films ever made, and there is no excuse for anyone not to own it.
I:9343;1819;Paul Anderson, like Brian Singer, is one of todays most important, watchable directors.
I:9343;1820;In a way, it had one of the simplest of plots of Anderson's movies.
I:9343;1821;halls family and that of Bill Macys story.
I:9343;1822;Back again are the incredible talents of william H Macy, Baker.
I:9343;1823;He desrved the oscar here, giving a magnetic performance with such jumpy electricity not seen from Cruise since the Color of Money.
I:9343;1824;Robards was also incredibly effective, given his charcaters state of being.
I:9343;1825;I thought all of the stories and characters stood up nicely on their own.
I:9343;1826;Let me just say this movie was completely engaging, interesting and thought provoking, right up until it started raining frogs.
I:9343;1827;What so brilliant about raining frogs?
I:9343;1828;All in all, some nice performances, interesting stories and characters which no doubt some people could relate to, but it all crashed and burned with that ending.
I:9343;1829;One of my favorite movies.
I:9343;1830;Stanley Kubrick films are often visually exciting and contain very intelligent scripts.
I:9343;1831;He's definitely more about how a movie looks and sounds than whether or not we can identify with his characters.
I:9343;1832;His last film was 'A Prairie Home Companion' and that really summed up his strengths.
I:9343;1833;His weakness is how sometimes he and his actors are enjoying themselves so much, the movies he's made come off less as statements of purpose, and more just a good ole time around the camera.
I:9343;1834;paul Thomas Anderson, the director of Magnolia, is a fan of Kubrick and met him once before Stanley passed away.
I:9343;1835;He is also a fan of Altman, and helped him as a fill in director when he passed away during the end of filming 'A Prairie Home Companion.'
I:9343;1836;It's safe to say he's let both directors influence him deeply, and brought all he learned to this glorious film.
I:9343;1837;notch all around, cinematography excellent and always curious, and this movie seems to me the perfect marriage of a good feel while having human characters who are easy to relate to.
I:9343;1838;thank you for your time and I hope my review allows more people to give it a chance and be open.
I:9343;1839;Director/writer/producer Paul Thomas Anderson delivered this Christmas present to critics and filmgoers in 1999 with his follow.
I:9343;1840;"Anderson's sense of filmmaking tends to mimic some of Robert Altman's best films (""Short Cuts"", ""Nashville"" come to mind) in which an ensemble cast with little connection cross paths in unexpected ways."
I:9343;1841;confidence in his personal and professional life.
I:9343;1842;the film is full of stellar performances throughout.
I:9343;1843;The always remarkable Moore stews in a scene where the pharmacists question her need for the strong narcotics she is getting at a drug store.
I:9343;1844;It is hours long and yet completely and absolutely engrossing.
I:9343;1845;The characters are real people and their stories are beautifully woven by director Paul Thomas Anderson.
I:9343;1846;This is a movie that will haunt you for years to come with its beauty.
I:9343;1847;I don't usually do movie reviews because I'm not a movie critic but I can say this: Magnolia is a masterpiece.
I:9343;1848;I love ensemble pictures anyway and this is such: A collection of tragic lives.
I:9343;1849;There's definitely some resolution in this film.
I:9343;1850;All the performances are brilliant.
I:9343;1851;The documentary of the making of Magnolia was fascinating to watch too.
I:9343;1852;I always like to see what goes on in the filmmaking process.
I:9343;1853;But this movie really surprised me.
I:9343;1854;Bottom line, it is one of the best films I have seen in a long time.
I:9343;1855;If you ever have a little time on a rainy day and want to see a truly unique film, go see Magnolia.
I:9343;1856;Magnolia is yet another Dramadys, where it is for the most part a drama but it can be funny in parts.
I:9343;1857;The king of Dramadys has to be As Good As it Gets and the prince is American Beauty.
I:9343;1858;It becomes a moving and powerful film.
I:9343;1859;I actually liked the preview for the film better, it makes it look intense and satisfying, while it does pull it off.
I:9343;1860;In the real Preview the one that is over 2 minutes long, it shows ALL of the action that happens in the film.
I:9343;1861;I probably laughed when you weren't supposed to, so I probably screwed it up a little.
I:9343;1862;This film is a shining example of a film, it is a seductive movie, that is powerful and somewhat scary, since all of the issues that happen in this film, could actually happen, in fact some did.
I:9343;1863;Some of the movie is insulting, and some of the movie is brilliant, but all and all it is a magnificent film, just a pretty good film.
I:9343;1864;This film is somewhat of a sleeper.
I:9343;1865;the premise is one of simplicity: An extremely detailed portrait of the lives of nine humans living in San Fernando Valley.
I:9343;1866;as a little boy sings in the last line of the Aimee Mann song Wise Up, which all the characters have a part in singing at the end of the film.
I:9343;1867;The film is also highly enhanced by its haunting score, and the wonderful songs from the remarkable Aimee Mann (most notably One, Save Me, and Wise Up, which are used throughout the film).
I:9343;1868;for all it's worth, Magnolia is a great piece of the detail of everyday human life in a 24 hour period, and at its epic running time, it seems that it could encompass an entire day.
I:9343;1869;Yes this is one of those movies, obviously inspired by Robert Altman, that takes a look at 'life' and what changes it.
I:9343;1870;it starts off incredibly well, explaining what exactly effects our lives, be it coincidence, chance or divine intervention.
I:9343;1871;Yet it's so gloriously entertaining, moving and beautifully acted that it definitely stands out as one of the best movies of recent years.
I:9343;1872;Being a series of vignettes every watcher is bound to find some stories more interesting than others but as a whole this is really a superb piece of cinema.
I:9343;1873;even in their relatively small roles the actors are absolutely superb.
I:9343;1874;Listening to the tracks this certainly makes sense, with Mann's tracks at times giving things a lighter tone and at times suggesting the emotional trauma that the characters are going through.
I:9343;1875;Indeed, what is one of the film's best points is that it does have a number of small characters that are genuinely funny and help stop it all getting bogged down in its serious tone.
I:9343;1876;this is one movie that is absolutely gorgeous and extremely involving, although probably not to everyone's taste, especially if you are offended by bad language.
I:9343;1877;stunning movie, three hours of luxurious movie pleasure.
I:9343;1878;make sure you watch hard eight as well, it aint as flashy but it's just as good
I:9343;1879;For the first hour I was riveted, not because anything particularly.
I:9343;1880;namely forgiveness, truth, faith, co. incidence and fate.
I:9343;1881;This movie was quite a surprise, and it scared me on a lot of levels.
I:9343;1882;Contrary to what other people have said, Anderson did a fine job of balancing the multitude of actors, and throughout the whole movie.
I:9343;1883;"In my opinion this is a great film
I:9343;1884;"This movie has great acting, tumultuous relationships and phrases that are still embedded in my brain (""you might be done with the past, but the past is not done with you"")."
I:9343;1885;This film may not be for everyone but anyone who enjoys film, true cinematography should appreciate the art that is this film.
I:9343;1886;PT Anderson is a great filmmaker, and he seems destined for household status one day.
I:9343;1887;Yes, those three are many of the themes intertwined in this film.
I:9343;1888;The performances are solid, and as all the critics raved, Tom Cruise is excellent as a misogynistic sex guru with a checkered past.
I:9343;1889;Anderson's script combined with the actors, manage to provide real depth to these damaged people including late great Jason Robards as a dying TV producer with one last sin to atone for, and John C. Reilly as a decent cop.
I:9343;1890;The appearance of a commentary is non.
I:9343;1891;Paul Thomas Anderson is a genus.
I:9343;1892;This movie is his shining star.
I:9343;1893;These are the questions PT Anderson asks the viewer, and in doing so, he weaves a brilliant tale of several people with seemingly no connection that are truly completely connected.
I:9343;1894;I love every single second of this movie, and even though it is over 3 hours long, I could, and will, watch it over and over again.
I:9343;1895;the first camp finds the movie absolutely brilliant, and the second claims that its too confusing and drawn out.
I:9343;1896;first of all, this movie had a lot of potential to be brilliant and original, but there's a lot that stopped it, and we'll get to that.
I:9343;1897;sure the movie was long, but I found it surprisingly engrossing, and even easily entertaining.
I:9343;1898;I thought everything about the movie worked.
I:9343;1899;the script was fresh, and heartfelt, and really made you listen, and there were some pretty unique approaches to things.
I:9343;1900;phillip Seymour Hoffman and John C. Reily stole the show completely with genuinely emotional and real yet understated performances.
I:9343;1901;their performances are truly what save this movie.
I:9343;1902;the rest of the performances were solid enough, and would've been fine, if there hadn't been such downers from the aformentioned actors.
I:9343;1903;"I mean it just pained me to see some actors give heart and soul, whose performances had me admiring their craft every step of the way, while some actors had me wondering how the director stood there and allowed that kind of ""acting"" to be filmed."
I:9343;1904;paul Thomas Anderson is immensely talented, but he needs to learn about subtlety, and that its not neccesary to have every single moment of the film be a dramatic revelation/realization/confrontation.
I:9343;1905;Rarely does a film take the viewer on an emotional rollercoaster as incredibly stunning as this.
I:9343;1906;This film is three hours of stupendous, top.
I:9343;1907;line acting from the greatest ensemble of actors in a long long time.
I:9343;1908;P. t. Anderson has put together a mind.
I:9343;1909;blowing journey through a day of the lives of nine people.
I:9343;1910;It exposes everything behind the faces in the media and in the world.
I:9343;1911;The beginnings, the ends, the incredible love we posess for each other.
I:9343;1912;One word can describe this film, beautiful.
I:9343;1913;This film is absolutely beautiful.
I:9343;1914;It has THE perfect cast, brilliant writing, and is an intellectual challenge.
I:9343;1915;This was one of the best edited films I've seen.
I:9343;1916;It also had a hint of Kubrick flavor to it.
I:9343;1917;The slow music playing in the background the entire time was wonderful.
I:9343;1918;I found myself repeating over and over I love this movie.
I:9343;1919;P. T. Anderson crafted this jewel perfectly.
I:9343;1920;This movie gets seven stars!
I:9343;1921;Magnolia is a film that I greeted with high expectations .
I:9343;1922;a brilliant, tight little thriller .
I:9343;1923;as the opening sequence reveals.
I:9343;1924;The result is completely anarchic and nauseating.
I:9343;1925;Like Scorsese, he seems fascinated with aesthetic for aesthetic's sake.
I:9343;1926;The Southern California dialogue is consistently filthy and indistinguishable from person to person.
I:9343;1927;The Coen Bros.' Fargo is a remarkable example of a film that dealt with seriously disturbed characters, yet created a unique rhythm for each one.
I:9343;1928;"There is a great divide amongst those who have watched this film
I:9343;1929;It is, indeed, a very polarizing film.
I:9343;1930;good movie, the characters are very well drawn and developed, the music is great as well, highly recommended to anyone who likes good stories
I:9343;1931;The dialogue here, and the direction, is reminiscent of other films that have previously been hailed as thought.
I:9343;1932;provoking film, speaking of its powerful message about society.
I:9343;1933;It mocks its characters, it mocks its audience, and it mocks other films that manage to entertain by providing a pleasant and/or complete resolution.
I:9343;1934;I commend this film on its success, for it has managed to prove its point: film audiences and critics alike know nothing about storytelling, only about what they are expected to appreciate.
I:9343;1935;More importantly, though, a second disc is included which contains a number of interesting extras, including a seminar done by Tom Cruise while in character.
I:9343;1936;I think Paul Thomas Anderson is one of the best American directors and hopefully over time and through his career which is already amazing (There Will BE Blood, Boogie NIghts, Punch DRunk Love, Hard EIght) he will be included alongside other great American Directors such as John Huston and Robert Altman.
I:9343;1937;This film was extremely well written.
I:9343;1938;At the theatre I was moved,shaken,inspired,uplifted and emotional.
I:9343;1939;Paul Thomas Anderson is one of the finest filmmakers of all time, we will know this when the world ends and we can cast our vote.
I:9343;1940;Magnolia is absolutely amazing, excellent writing, character orginization, time, elements, color, weather, plot, story, resolution, cinematography.
I:9343;1941;Every element of a fine film.
I:9343;1942;Magnolia is a brilliant movie.
I:9343;1943;It draws you in and drives you on to its final crescendo.
I:9343;1944;from its writing and directing to the numerous stunning performances and the excellent cinematography.
I:9343;1945;moore plays Robbards's wife) is flawless.
I:9343;1946;The frogs, and the respite following the frogs, offer us each the chance to soften our hearts and live open and free lives.
I:9343;1947;The Hours, which came out a few years later and took home the top prize, borrowed deeply from Magnolia's style and form.
I:9343;1948;magnolia blooms, not just with its artful description of humanity's pain, but also with the hope of better days and the possibility of love and grace being just around the next bend.
I:9343;1949;On the positivie side, there is some good character creation: I particularly liked the work of Robards, Macy and Cruise.
I:9343;1950;There IS some really nice camera work.
I:9343;1951;And there are a few riveting scenes.
I:9343;1952;But there are also scenes that played like nails on the blackboard .
I:9343;1953;While I found this movie interesting, captivating and compelling, it was also very moving.
I:9343;1954;The film introduces our protagonists and follows them through an extrordinary day.
I:9343;1955;While I found the film to be at times melodramatic (screaming, crying, etc.), the film overall was powerfull and innovative.
I:9343;1956;I liked this movie and found it very interesting.
I:9343;1957;This film is pretty good.
I:9343;1958;The Bottom Line:A great film that introduces and develops a half.
I:9343;1959;dozen connected storylines in a thoroughly unique manner before introducing a plot element that has polarized viewers but completely fits in the context of the film, Magnolia is a modern masterpiece by PT Anderson which will stay with you long after much tamer and shorter (it is long, though very fast.
I:9343;1960;"moving) films are gone
I:9343;1961;The characters of this poingant film are each caught in their own tradgedy, trapped and struggling to find meaning, to find resolution, even to find life, and yet in the chaos of thier lives is an honesty, and an inexplicaple beauty.
I:9343;1962;Paul Thomas Anderson has created a masterpiece.
I:9343;1963;He uses fresh tecniques to tell a complex set of stories about sorrow, cancer and corruption, that instead of being depressing, is a life.
I:9343;1964;Many of actors adeptly portray fascinating characters, Tom Cruise in particular is a suprise with a fresh new style.
I:9343;1965;I can honestly say, without reservation, that this is the best movie I have ever seen.
I:9343;1966;I just wrote a review stating that Polanski was my favorite director and The Tenant my favorite film.
I:9343;1967;Magnolia is my favorite film and the Tenant is second.
I:9343;1968;Paul Thomas Anderson is a brilliant filmmaker and cements his already sure status with this brilliant three hour opus.
I:9343;1969;In 1997, he came into Hollywood with Boogie Nights, a 2 1/2 hour epic about a porn star's rise and fall in 1977.
I:9343;1970;He preceeded that with Hard Eight, a 1997 film about gambling and the relationship between a pro and a bum.
I:9343;1971;His ear is for dialogue, his characters are sympathetic and hopeful,and his real talents lie in the brilliant Camera he possesses.
I:9343;1972;But the film itself is something else and really moved me.
I:9343;1973;"Yes, it's a long movie, but it is put together well
I:9343;1974;Granted the story line is a tad unrealistic, but it makes it nonetheless enjoyable.
I:9343;1975;It's worth picking up just for Tom Cruise's performance!!!
I:9343;1976;I prefer movies that deal with relationships and this fits the bill for me.
I:9343;1977;It is an older movie, but vey engrossing.
I:9343;1978;I recommend it highly for those that prefer this type of movie also.
I:9343;1979;I am definitely going to watch it again soon.
I:9343;1980;After that I had given up all hope for this being a good movie.
I:9343;1981;That's disappointing too because the beginning of the movie is so good.
I:9343;1982;The stories they show in the very beginning are interesting.
I:9343;1983;And not one story has a satisfying ending.
I:9343;1984;At that point you can tell that the director has given up on this and he just wanted to get it over with as soon as possible.
I:9343;1985;This film has more in common with Richard Linklater's Slacker than it does with Boogie Nights, so if you liked the former and not the latter, you might want to give this film a try.
I:9343;1986;If you liked the latter and not the former, give it a pass.
I:9343;1987;This movie is a must see for anyone who appreciates artistic well thought out movies.
I:9343;1988;The music, Starring Aimee Man's Beautiful voice captures the atmosphere of the movie with insane accuracy as does the superb camera work.
I:9343;1989;Paul Thomas Anderson IS the most creative, most brilliant, most daring writer/director of all time.
I:9343;1990;i was literally swept away from each and every cast member's preformance and I marvel at the symbolism and irony that this film captures.
I:9343;1991;And for that, Magnolia is my favorite film of all time!KUDOS TO EVERYONE THAT WAS APART OF MAGNOLIA!
I:9343;1992;This movie has a lot of depth.
I:9343;1993;Each one is written well.
I:9343;1994;Each one with one exception has a mouth on him or her.
I:9343;1995;since it is such a counter culture picture and the culture of the last 20 years celebrates all that is dysfunctional a counter culture picture can only be one of confidence and redemption and happy endings.
I:9343;1996;i'm sure PETA had a fit at the end of this picture.
I:9343;1997;then again it could just be a cheep stunt for some guys who couldn't figure out how to get from a. b. Either way you'll find the performances all very good particularly by the supporting cast.
I:9343;1998;This film is an absolute masterpiece.
I:9343;1999;Every part of the film is outstanding.
I:9343;2000;So the acting was incredible.
I:9343;2001;The songs were great and in order all the time.
I:9343;2002;The editor was great and the script was really well written.
I:9343;2003;I like esoteric filmaking and was lured by the stellar cast and Roger Ebert's thumbs.
I:9343;2004;I thought it was ok, beautifully filmed, but it didn't meet my expectations.
I:9343;2005;Because I knew of the multiple storylines, i expected something tarantino.
I:9343;2006;esque with something that tied together neatly.
I:9343;2007;Boogie Nights also really affected my expectations.
I:9343;2008;It is very emotional, and that is why i had trouble dealing with it.
I:9343;2009;I noticed so much more, and i realized how amazingly real the acting is.
I:9343;2010;I thought about this movie everyday of my life.
I:9343;2011;i don't think it's perfect yet, but it might be perfect to me one day.
I:9343;2012;it continues after the credits have rolled and creeps into your life.
I:9343;2013;This is a movie that keeps growing everytime you watch it.
I:9343;2014;I'll count myself in the minority who don't think this movie is completely brilliant or alternately a waste of celluloid.
I:9343;2015;no one can deny that P. T. Anderson is ambitious in the scope and style of the story he attempts to tell here.
I:9343;2016;I found the multiple plot lines, acting and themes to be captivating.
I:9343;2017;The final resolution (and the whole film for that matter) was completely original.
I:9343;2018;The melding of music and story was beautiful.
I:9343;2019;Anderson chose well in using Aimee Mann's music to reveal the complex emotions of the characters.
I:9343;2020;conversely, the acting (while well done) at times seemed out of place.
I:9343;2021;but all else being equal, it was a beautiful, haunting and original movie.
I:9343;2022;highly highly HIGHLY recommended if you want an enriching and interesting movie experience, far from the usual Hollywood cookie cutter plots .
I:9343;2023;Someone whom I highly respect and appreciate made me promise to see this so I did.
I:9343;2024;He said it was his favorite movie of all time.
I:9343;2025;I sense that the more times one sees it the more they will appreciate it.
I:9343;2026;Someone who has the patience and temperament to absorb it can see the artistry that went into it.
I:9343;2027;intellectuals, emotionally unstable people, and holdovers from last decade's coffeehouse scene.
I:9343;2028;in which case, enjoy, you have found your pied piping prophet
I:9343;2029;I have seen this film three times and each time am struck by the brilliance of director, Paul Anderson.
I:9343;2030;Tom Cruise in one of his best performances as the crude Frank.
I:9343;2031;Jason Robards as the drying man so loved and hated.
I:9343;2032;All of these lives come together and in the final minutes of the film the skies open up and all have their lives in front of them.
I:9343;2033;three for writer and director Paul Thomas Anderson, 29, who follows Hard Eight and Boogie Nights with his most ardent and ambitious movie yet.
I:9343;2034;Anderson keeps a tight lid on his work so that audiences can approach his character.
I:9343;2035;based dramas with a sense of discovery.
I:9343;2036;Magnolia is one of the best movies of the year .
I:9343;2037;startling, innovative, hugely funny and powerfully, courageously moving.
I:9343;2038;hilarious performance of Tom Cruise as the male dominating sex guru really grabbed me.
I:9343;2039;top drugged out wife, Julianne Moore.
I:9343;2040;She could have accomplished the same shock with fewer exclamatory f. words.
I:9343;2041;She played the range of hysteria.
I:9343;2042;if you can stick through the early parts of the film that bring you to the brink of despair as you witness the depths of the pain of these characters, you will be rewarded by the depths of simple goodness and warmth of some of them.
I:9343;2043;That role is carried mostly by John C. Reilly as the good cop.
I:9343;2044;The relatonship between Reilly and Melora Walter, who is Wonderful!
I:9343;2045;affecting William H. Macy are the true stars of the film.Yes, Hoffman has a depth that is rare in film actors and he is very affecting here.
I:9343;2046;That's a quibble, though, and the fact that he went to such lengths to contact Robards' son is one of the moral strong points that makes this film more than a horror show.
I:9343;2047;henry Gibson gives a brilliant bit as a cynical character Macy meets in a bar.
I:9343;2048;this is a film that attempts grand themes.
I:9343;2049;I loved the suggestion of another reviewer.
I:9343;2050;At any rate, the acting is uniformly first rate.
I:9343;2051;I rarely watch a film more than once.
I:9343;2052;But this is one that I think I will see again.
I:9343;2053;This film is a true classic.
I:9343;2054;unbelievable performances from a huge cast, delivering emotionally potent performances in the most difficult of circumstances, allows Magnolia to win through rewarding the viewer with one of those rare movies which can touch the soul.
I:9343;2055;Another feature which is hidden from the user is outtakes which I found very funny.
I:9343;2056;esque version of Wise Up in the middle of the film.
I:9343;2057;the whole movie just bunched together at the end, and hit me like an atomic thrust to the heart, made me think about myself and others in a whole new light.
I:9343;2058;i recommend this movie to anyone preoccupied with living, breathing, sucking the marrow out of life.
I:9343;2059;Although the film concentrates on the lonely, destitute, confused people, it really hits the ones that take love and affection for granted.
I:9343;2060;It really touches those of us who never thought that all we have can be taken away at any second.
I:9343;2061;This is the second movie of Mr. Anderson's that I have watched.
I:9343;2062;"The first was the phenomenal ""Boogie Nights."""
I:9343;2063;"The fact that is deals more intimately with familial relationships makes it, in that respect, a bit more difficult to watch than ""Boogie Nights."
I:9343;2064;To say that they are in the midst of a storm is a masterpiece of understatment.
I:9343;2065;"The cast, many of whom were in ""Boogie Nights"" is again positively first."
I:9343;2066;The calming influence in the midst of all the turbulence is John C. Reily as a police officer who is lonely and in need of someone to love, so much so, that we become appalled at the fact, that his need of love is so strong as to cause him to make a monumentally horrible choice.
I:9343;2067;If you are in to character study, this is indeed an excellent vehicle.
I:9343;2068;Tom's performance here is riveting.
I:9343;2069;provoking, and ultimately worthy to be included in any movie collection.
I:9343;2070;rate, and at no point, does one thread become more interesting than all the others.
I:9343;2071;So there is no disappointment when the scence changes.
I:9343;2072;This movie has a lot to say about the role of chance in one's life, and about how much of what we do is really our own choice.
I:9343;2073;The ending is both funny and surprising, and will most likely cause you to think about it for days.
I:9343;2074;Okay, this film deserves 4 stars, but I added one for the supplimental stuff on the second disc.
I:9343;2075;which was a nice treat and is well.
I:9343;2076;And I'm also proud to say that I'm a fan of Mister Anderson's work (do yourself a favor and check out Hard Eight and, of course, Boogie Nights ) and his story.
I:9343;2077;image (I know you want to be known as a nice guy Tommy, but you're an actor) and for the emotional depth of his performance which was quite stunning to watch (was he panting like a dog in one scene?
I:9343;2078;he's outstanding in mostly everything he does.
I:9343;2079;Redemption comes in the form of a Biblical downpour of frogs, which is creative and Oh.
I:9343;2080;The metaphysical side of the movie is extremely subtle but always present.
I:9343;2081;I thoroughly enjoyed the whispy nature of the metaphysical side of the film.
I:9343;2082;the third viewing is just fun to try to find all the references to Exodus 8:2, like a Where's Waldo on a moving screen.
I:9343;2083;This exercise is actually more enjoyable to do with more than one person.
I:9343;2084;"It is this point that is key
I:9343;2085;a flawless union of filmscoremusic and a moment in time.
I:9343;2086;You get a feeling that you've got your money worth and thinking to yourself I am going to get this.You will know this is a classic the moment you start watching the film, like all good movies, the cast has to gel well, the story has to be good, the acting has to be great and the director must be on form.
I:9343;2087;Every actors here gave great performances, Tom Cruise deservedly got his Oscar nomination, PT Anderson (writer and director of boogie night, which he also wrote this too) should have got one too, he certainly at least deserved a Oscar nomination for best director and best film.
I:9343;2088;Each one have their own problems to deal with and the director deal with them all superbly.
I:9343;2089;All the characters have a connection with one and other through either relations or this What do kid know game show.
I:9343;2090;the real treat here is that all these stories are told in such a way that you won't keep your eyes off the screen, all the scene have an importance in the film in the story telling.
I:9343;2091;Even though the film is a little over 3 hours long, it will fly by.
I:9343;2092;Which brings me to the editing of this film because the film is so well put together from one scene to another, this helps the stories immensely, in addition the music by Aimee Mann is also well suited to the film, it gave the film an extra dimension and character.
I:9343;2093;"All these elements together made this the movie of the year for me
I:9343;2094;Excellent, Wonderful, Clever, Brilliant and Engaging only comes close.
I:9343;2095;s. look out for the strange weather phenomenon at the end of the film, you'll never see that coming and it's so funny and clever.
I:9343;2096;Do you like great characters ( Better Call Saul comes to mind), great writing and great acting?
I:9343;2097;Cruise,Philip Seymour Hoffman, Bill Macy and others are superb in a movie that relies on the theme rather than one or two characters.
I:9343;2098;Amie Mann's songs add to the mood.
I:9343;2099;This is about real people not super heroes with a twist of fantasy.
I:9343;2100;I came to watch some great performances.
I:9343;2101;anderson seems to emphasize two aspects of film in Magnolia: the complete and uninhibited expression of his characters and the emotional connections those characters share with each other.
I:9343;2102;face glimpse into the depths of human beings, one which deserves undivided attention.
I:9343;2103;in can share an emotional bond that exceeds their opposing circumstances.
I:9343;2104;More subtly, the connection that Philip Seymour Hoffman and the Seduce and Destroy hotline man .
I:9343;2105;stresses the undeniable significance of personal bonds between the most unlikely, and in some cases unnecessary, of human beings.
I:9343;2106;I love this movie, go see it.
I:9343;2107;"Thought provoking questions for the ages, some would say, proficiently addressed here by writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson in his discursively brilliant film, ""Magnolia."""
I:9343;2108;Anderson puts the lives of a diverse cross.
I:9343;2109;The story Anderson weaves is fast.
I:9343;2110;paced, sometimes frantic, and thoroughly engrossing, achieving levels of emotional intensity that are at times remarkable.
I:9343;2111;It's a dynamic piece of filmmaking, extremely well written and delivered by Anderson and his superb cast.
I:9343;2112;There are a number of memorable performances here, among them Tom Cruise, who plays Frank T. j. Mackey, a self.
I:9343;2113;"It's an intense performance (for which he deservedly received an Oscar nomination), quite unlike anything he's done before, and possibly his best work since ""Rain Man."""
I:9343;2114;But the most superlative performance of the movie is given by Philip Seymour Hoffman, as a male nurse named Phil Parma.
I:9343;2115;His sensitive, subtle portrayal of this caretaker to dying man Earl Partridge (Jason Robards), is delivered with nuance and incredible depth, and provides some of the most poignant moments in the film.
I:9343;2116;"One of the best films of 1999, ""Magnolia"" conveys a moral without moralizing, is rich in metaphor and altogether captivating, with an ending that may take you aback, if indeed, you haven't been paying close attention (there are at least two clues during the film, admittedly obscure, but there nevertheless)."
I:9343;2117;"It is intense, unremittedly so, and may leave you breathless and pondering the mysteries of life
I:9343;2118;watchers, one that absolutely must not be missed.
I:9343;2119;"Possibly the best character movie since ""Short Cuts,"" this film is more off the wall and a whole lot of strange."
I:9343;2120;The multi stories are all interesting.
I:9343;2121;His performance was so antistereotype of his persona and was so brilliantly acted.
I:9343;2122;His scenes were breathtaking at times.
I:9343;2123;John C. Reilly also did a superior job, but these men aren't alone.
I:9343;2124;All the cast was super and you care about the characters.
I:9343;2125;That part was simply great.
I:9343;2126;One of the best movies that was not nominated for best picture.
I:9343;2127;I find that movies that have a lot of characters and a lot of factors involved are among the best.
I:9343;2128;I also loved the way the film was directed.
I:9343;2129;A fantastic film, from a fantastic film maker.
I:9343;2130;I would recommend it to anyone.
I:9343;2131;It is a bit on the long side but still really awesom.
I:9343;2132;"i find myself thinking about the film often, and then thinking about it again, hunting for the soundtrack with the amazing Aimee Mann songs (""Save Me"" and ""Wise Up"" are particularly good), and connecting elements of the film as I listen to the music, considering what it means to me, what it might mean to people I know."
I:9343;2133;To go from that chaos, though, and create such a powerful film from it.
I:9343;2134;"Despite being more than 3 hours long, ""Magnolia"" is well worth seeing more than once."
I:9343;2135;PT Anderson has done it again!
I:9343;2136;After Hard Eight and Boogie Nights, he has again pulled off one of the best dramas I've seen.
I:9343;2137;The characters are real, the story is compelling and the acting is out of this world.
I:9343;2138;Clocking in at over 3 hours this is perfect to watch on a rainy day or cuddled up in bed at night.
I:9343;2139;Some really wonderful performances by an ensemble cast, and it's a layered movie.
I:9343;2140;We actually watched it twice in two nights just to be able to catch more of the show.
I:9343;2141;I thought it was really enjoyable, and the music is great.
I:9343;2142;known of movies, but an excellent film.
I:9343;2143;Magnificent performances by everyone in the cast.
I:9343;2144;John C. Reilly, Phillip Seymore Hoffman and William H. Macy are absolutely stellar.
I:9343;2145;It's not a movie for everyone, but it is worth watching at least once.
I:9343;2146;This abomination makes the director's wonderfully under.
I:9343;2147;I say unequivicably that this is the best movie of the year.
I:9343;2148;"stories
I:9343;2149;with Aimee Mann singing wonderfully, especially for the movie and some incredible acting, this movie was fascinating and disturbing.
I:9343;2150;And the scene where everyone sang all at once was a wonderfully symbolic and bold gesture that some may have found odd, but I absolutely loved.
I:9343;2151;so is it just a coincidence or is it a miracle?
I:9343;2152;The tension in the film as this mysogynist was being interviewed was palpable, a tribute to Anderson's direction.
I:9343;2153;there are few movies that are as bold and thought provoking as this.
I:9343;2154;I found this movie to be both disturbing and captivating at the same time.
I:9343;2155;I found it to be mesmerizing.
I:9343;2156;The performance rendered by Tom Cruise alone makes the film worth the price.
I:9343;2157;This was my favorite movie of 1999.
I:9343;2158;It's true that it feels almost like stream of consciousness with no editing (in length anyway), but that is part of it appeal.
I:9343;2159;It is an outpouring of emotion and energy.
I:9343;2160;The performances (especially by Hoffman, Moore and Cruise) are exceptional.
I:9343;2161;The music is astoundingly good.
I:9343;2162;P. t. Anderson once again shows his brilliance.
I:9343;2163;up Magnolia was a brilliant Altmanesc story of one day in the valley.
I:9343;2164;Astounding fast pace directing and fantastic performances make this a runner.
I:9343;2165;up for the best picture of 99' next only to Being John Malkovich .
I:9343;2166;Maybe visual effects are a new form of art in itself, but I wish movies were still movies , in the first place.
I:9343;2167;Saw this movie years ago and THOUGHT I loved it.
I:9343;2168;definitely worth your time to watch though, has a great cast.
I:9343;2169;High Praise must be given to this film.
I:9343;2170;The greatly intwined plot deserves much credit and the actors played their roles quite superbly.
I:9343;2171;It was great, unexpected, and brilliant.
I:9343;2172;This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat from the first minute.
I:9343;2173;Paul Thomas Anderson knows a thing or two about homages.
I:9343;2174;His second feature,Boogie Nights, was built around an ensemble cast.
I:9343;2175;Criterion Collection), and in some ways passed the great director.
I:9343;2176;this is a wonderful movie.
I:9343;2177;One of the best of the year, in a very good year by the way.
I:9343;2178;boogie Nights had been my favorite (and yep, I picked up the 2.
I:9343;2179;i think Paul Thomas Anderson is a genius.
I:9343;2180;Hard Eight was a beautiful small.
I:9343;2181;"scale, slowly paced film
I:9343;2182;it takes a lot of effort to remember you're watching actors.
I:9343;2183;Because they're so believable, you develop a large personal insterest in the characters, so it's easy to become emotional while watching the film.
I:9343;2184;Wise up might have been the single most beautiful sequence I have ever seen put to film.
I:9343;2185;minute documentary which is a fantastic profile into the development and production of the film.
I:9343;2186;It's a perfect compliment to the film.
I:9343;2187;"And check out those color bars
I:9343;2188;The moments with Luis Guzman at the quiz show table and John C. Reilly during the Wise Up sequence are good for some great belly laughs.
I:9343;2189;"Kudos to New Line for putting together such a comprehensive experience which goes so far beyond the film
I:9343;2190;big congratulations to P. t. Anderson for another masterpiece.
I:9343;2191;He's surprised me every time he's made a film yet.
I:9343;2192;this may be the best film you'll ever see.
I:9343;2193;This movie is a cinematic epiphany .
I:9343;2194;"If you don't get it you must ask yourself what you think ""good"" is."
I:9343;2195;Paul Thomas Anderson has made his masterpiece with Magnolia, a daring movie that may forever change the way we look at motion pictures.
I:9343;2196;all with incredible understanding and empathy.
I:9343;2197;The whole of the movie is greater than the sum of its ensemble cast parts.
I:9343;2198;As many know, Tom Cruise received a well.
I:9343;2199;deserved best supporting actor Oscar nomination for his part as a multimedia sex guru with a painful past.
I:9343;2200;sniffing love interest, William H. Macy as a former quiz.
I:9343;2201;Paul Thomas Anderson's direction brings out inspired performances from everyone in the cast.
I:9343;2202;one of the most touching and emotional parts in Magnolia is the Wise Up sequence, set to Aimee Mann's incredibly haunting song.
I:9343;2203;Mann's songs are used extensively in the excellent soundtrack, as well as a couple of vintage Supertramp compositions.
I:9343;2204;The Logical Song and Goodbye Stranger .
I:9343;2205;But if you invest your time and emotion, the payoff is worth it.
I:9343;2206;I'm a huge fan of Boogie Nights, There Will Be Blood, The Master, and even Punch.
I:9343;2207;drunk Love,but this is Paul Thomas Anderson's masterpiece.
I:9343;2208;and Aimee Mann's soundtrack is beautiful.
I:9343;2209;so I'll just say this: YOU WILL BE AMAZED!
I:9343;2210;It's well played, above all, and you feel close to the characters and at the same time, you're entertained by the sometimes extreme destinies they meet.
I:9343;2211;it's deep, but not disturbingly.
I:9343;2212;Great affects, fast forward to the frogs, they were far more interesting than anything else in this piece of tripe.
I:9343;2213;if you want to see cinema as a work of art, this is your movie.
I:9343;2214;It is a work of allegory.
I:9343;2215;It is all over the top to make a point.
I:9343;2216;"Magnolia, a 1999 drama film written and directed by P. t. Anderson, is in Anderson's own words, ""probably the best film I'll ever make"", which is wrong, as that honor goes to There Will Be Blood, at least in my eyes."
I:9343;2217;It features an ensemble cast of well.
I:9343;2218;"kid"" on What Do Kids Know who has a sorry excuse for a father and seems to be heading down the same path as William H. Macy's character, he's also one of the most likable and sympathetic characters in the film along side John C. Reilly's character Officer Jim Kurring, who, believe it or not, is an LA Cop."
I:9343;2219;This is made clear in an interview with a woman that he agrees to during one of his seminars.
I:9343;2220;In addition to these loosely connected plot threads, there is the common theme of chance and coincidence, best illustrated at the beginning of the film in a darkly humorous monologue focusing on three incredible coincidences that supposedly really happened and in a scene towards the very end which I won't spoil for you.
I:9343;2221;Overall it was an okay film, but not great or a masterpiece, and definitely not Paul Thomas Anderson's best film.
I:9343;2222;He is responsible for other genius works like There Will Be Blood, and most recently The Master, which lives up to its name.
I:9343;2223;Fast paced, intriguing, funny, and filled with pathos of a most revealing kind that indicate that Anderson has insight of the divine nature and connectedness of people and things.
I:9343;2224;top 20 of my films.
I:9343;2225;Look folks, I enjoyed Boogie Nights .
I:9343;2226;Slightly long, but overall a pretty solid, interesting story.
I:9343;2227;Yes, I know, dysfuctional life movies are being done left and right, but there was some really solid stuff here.
I:9343;2228;Magnolia is the movie that I thought really showed Paul Thomas Anderson's genius.
I:9343;2229;If you don't mind either of those, give it a shot.
I:9343;2230;I would really have liked to have the commentary.
I:9343;2231;It's got some nice behind.
I:9343;2232;time oppressor And he's running from the devil, But the debt is always gaining And if he's worth being hurt He's worth brining pain in When the sunshine don't work, The good Lord bring the rain in!Now that sh!t will help you solve the case.
I:9343;2233;P. t. Anderson's Magnolia is filled with so many great characters and fantastic bits of dialogue, it's almost tempting to overlook its flaws and hail it a masterpiece.
I:9343;2234;That's the first time you see it.
I:9343;2235;Anderson accomplished more artistically with the minimalist plot in Hard Eight than he does in this three.
I:9343;2236;There are scenes, such as the spontaneous sing.
I:9343;2237;p. t. Anderson is an enormous talent, but he needs to minimalize what he has to say.
I:9343;2238;Hopefully, he has finally gotten the big message out of his system so he can return to telling great stories once again.
I:9343;2239;One of those movies that you just can't take your eyes away from.
I:9343;2240;Stunning and rich in its character development and multiple competing and overlapping storylines.
I:9343;2241;An exquisite masterpiece from opening line to closing credit.
I:9343;2242;The kind of film that seems to linger on in the imagination and may possibly just change you.
I:9343;2243;worthy performances from a cast rivalling the likes of The Big Chill and Goodfellas.
I:9343;2244;This film is simply amazing.
I:9343;2245;The screenplay is mind boggling if you think about it.
I:9343;2246;The only way I could place this film in a catagory is to say it's an everyday epic with heart.
I:9343;2247;The cinematography of this film is simply beautiful.
I:9343;2248;Every scene is lit in a way that adds to the feeling of film.
I:9343;2249;The performances are amazing too.
I:9343;2250;The main reason this film was not a blockbuster is because its not the type of movie mainstream America likes.
I:9343;2251;if you are a person who appreciates a film for its beauty rather than its entertainment value, this ones for you!!!
I:9343;2252;This is a work of staggering beauty.
I:9343;2253;Anderson has painted a dizzying panorama of the human condition.
I:9343;2254;The performances are all top.
I:9343;2255;best work from Julianna Moore, Tom Cruise and the late, great Jason Robards.
I:9343;2256;But amidst the flurry of brilliant acting lies an absolute gem of a screenplay, one of the best.
I:9343;2257;written and most beautifully executed pieces of storytelling this viewer has ever had the good fortune to experience.
I:9343;2258;This random amalgamation of events and people had several good moments and does cause one to reflect on the chaos that is life, that part was about 20 minutes of the movie.
I:9343;2259;Aimee Mann's gorgeous score and Tom Cruise's momentary brilliance are the only two feeble reasons to trudge through this self.
I:9343;2260;that we always end up hurting the ones we really love.
I:9343;2261;Whenever something unusual or magical happens, it is ineffective or downright silly (e. g., a rain of frogs .
I:9343;2262;oddly, one of the less important characters, Donnie (played by William Macy) says something interesting: I really do have love to give.
I:9343;2263;Paul Thomas Anderson excels at writing tragic and love deprivedcharacters.
I:9343;2264;The deft director proved this ability in his secondfeature, Boogie Nights , which is considered by many, including Roger Ebert, a sprawling masterpiece.
I:9343;2265;Just by seeing Boogie Nights one can notice Anderson's affection and keenness for cinema.
I:9343;2266;He shoots long, subtle takes that slither from one character to the next.
I:9343;2267;Much like directors such as Martin Scorsese and Spike Lee have the map of New York engraved in their palms, Anderson knows L. a like the back of his hand.
I:9343;2268;It tells stories of chance and coincidence and is able to prove that strange things do happen.
I:9343;2269;with excellent performances ranging from Tom Cruise, in his most audacious role to date, to Melora Walters, the ensemble cast is first.
I:9343;2270;A great deal of patience is required, but if you're willing to sit through it all, the payoff is worthwhile.
I:9343;2271;Later on when the audience hears him say, My name is Quiz Kid Donny Smith and I have a lot of love to give , our hearts go out to his bluntness in admitting an intimate secret.
I:9343;2272;It is straightforward in expressing the pain of reality.
I:9343;2273;on a technical level, it's candy for the eye.
I:9343;2274;like camera movement to original angle shots, almost every frame is saturated with beautiful colors.
I:9343;2275;The kinetic camerawork and quick cuts all add up to its look.
I:9343;2276;With numerous songs from Aimee Mann and a score composed by Jon Brion, the tone is well set.
I:9343;2277;And finally there's Officer Jim Kurring (John C. Reilly), an honest and bible abiding cop who has fallen in love with Claudia.
I:9343;2278;By this scene you have to acknowledge the fact that Anderson is a bold filmmaker.
I:9343;2279;I was able to empathize with these characters, for they are all tormented souls experiencing difficult dilemmas.
I:9343;2280;I remember going to see this movie in the theater when it came out.
I:9343;2281;There are many movies that have several people who's live intertwine in many ways.
I:9343;2282;The characters and their emotions, how they feel about themselves.
I:9343;2283;This is one unique film and a fine piece of work, but it is not for the easily bored.
I:9343;2284;Makes you mentally take a double.
I:9343;2285;one incredible performance after another.
I:9343;2286;yet the experiences bring the best out of these characters.
I:9343;2287;Some characters you end up hating and others you end up liking in spite of yourself.
I:9343;2288;If you're into good film, deep thoughts and appreciate the art of fine storytelling, this is a film you should see.
I:9343;2289;After you see the whole film and it finally all makes sense, you'll want to watch it again to catch all the subtle clues and references (I can't tell you what references w/o spoiling the film) through out.
I:9343;2290;I really liked this movie until near the ending where for some dumbo reason large frogs started falling out the sky.
I:9343;2291;A unique film in one respect, i was told it was amazing and would blow me away by a couple of people.
I:9343;2292;the quiz kid story was the best and most original, and the cops story was initially good, but got lost badly in confused misdirection.
I:9343;2293;i think this is a film for those who want to be told they are watching something meaningful, and length = deep and meaningful.
I:9343;2294;Over ambitiousis the best way to describe Andersons work.
I:9343;2295;You never suspect for one moment that the movie will culminate with a reasoned and satisfactory ending.
I:9343;2296;I liked Hard Eight, and while i was impressed with boogie nights, i did not think that it was as deserving of all the raves, although it was still a very good movie.
I:9343;2297;It is about the most important things in life, family, love, anger, forgiveness, lies, truth, sin and beauty, simultaneously sentimental and brutal, obvious and deceptive.
I:9343;2298;the acting is inarguably superb, the most stunning facet of a film of much merit.
I:9343;2299;what i have come to realize that is most to the honor of this film is that it has really stayed with me as so few films do.
I:9343;2300;I find myself thinking of it often, and rethinking about its themes and characters.
I:9343;2301;I thought this was going to be great.
I:9343;2302;The first 10 minutes or so were very intriguing, literally pulling and drawing me into the film.
I:9343;2303;I thought I was in for something very special.
I:9343;2304;I was awating a climactic ending, along the lines of The Game .
I:9343;2305;anyone who has seen theaforementioned movies knows darn well that .
I:9343;2306;I sincerely enjoyed Anderson's Boogie Nights , so I was very excited about this movie and wanted to like it.
I:9343;2307;I have no problem with a movie that really has no sensible conclusion or plot, but it's got to be compelling and at least say something along the way.
I:9343;2308;See the movie, THEN read the screenplay.
I:9343;2309;Because, the beauty of it all is hidden within the film.
I:9343;2310;The acting, the cinematography, the music, everything.
I:9343;2311;It's a journey, that's what this film is.
I:9343;2312;A cinematic journey of life, love, death, family, sex, drugs, and everything else.
I:9343;2313;Magnolia is what I like to call a conceptual masterpiece, but it is far from being a masterpiece in the narrative sense.
I:9343;2314;P. t. Anderson's use of the musical soundtrack and the way he frames also reminded me alot of Scorsese's work.
I:9343;2315;It's a bold scene but it's also very familiar in our media culture that has been saturated with all sorts of post.
I:9343;2316;Such cinematic non sequiturs deliberately call attention to themselves that they take away from the visceral power of the film.
I:9343;2317;And the examination of coincidence vs. divine intervention has been examined previously as well, most notably in Kieslowski's films, and in particular, 'Red'.
I:9343;2318;I think he will be a great director.
I:9343;2319;I think he has a masterpiece in him.
I:9343;2320;Magnolia left me stunned, thoughtful, and more than a little unnerved.
I:9343;2321;The movie chronicles the unraveling of the lives of a large cast of characters, all of whom are revealed to relate to the others in some way, and finds a moral redemption from the chaos.
I:9343;2322;It has a dark fascination similar to American Beauty's.
I:9343;2323;It's my favorite of P. t. Anderson's films.
I:9343;2324;Phenomenal acting, script, characters, lighting, music, everything.
I:9343;2325;It is also one of the more emotionally moving films I have ever seen.
I:9343;2326;The movie simply tells stories of people that are all semi.
I:9343;2327;The movie itself is good and enjoyable to watch.
I:9343;2328;The extra with Tom Cruise's character is just so funny, you will want to show everyone it.
I:9343;2329;You have never seen Tom this way, it is great, I have watched that extra over and over.
I:9343;2330;this movie has an amazing cast and is visually rich and engaging.
I:9343;2331;Each actor hands in a great turn.
I:9343;2332;There are so many levels to the lives introduced here that for the first two hours, you don't mind the waiting game.
I:9343;2333;It unfolds like the flower that gives the movie its name.
I:9343;2334;This is the kind of movie that sours the more you think about it.
I:9343;2335;It's full of ostentation, extreme life situations, passionate (over)acting, symbolic import, and noise.
I:9343;2336;"The triteness of the ""moral"" is captured in the confrontation that a harried young boy makes to his demanding father ."
I:9343;2337;the beginning and ending segments of the film reach for some profundity concerning the connectedness between seemingly random events.
I:9343;2338;"it's clear that Anderson has ""issues"" he wants to address ."
I:9343;2339;"Perhaps it was good therapy for him to do so (Janov's ""The Primal Scream"" comes to mind because of all the shouting and crying scenes)."
I:9343;2340;This is an ambitiously put.
I:9343;2341;"together movie, directed by Paul Thomas Anderson (""There Will Be Blood"" and ""Boogie Nights""), and if you haven't seen it, I recommend that you give it a go."
I:9343;2342;soon you'll get a sense of these lines and what's at stake for the characters in each.
I:9343;2343;The movie covers a day in the lives of a number of San Fernando Valley citizens, and some of the stories begin and end on that day.
I:9343;2344;"But it becomes clear that for some characters, their pasts are the important stories, and we see the results of these pasts in the ""present"" (the day of the movie), but we don't see these stories enacted ."
I:9343;2345;the performances of these actors over the course of the movie are very fine.
I:9343;2346;top moments (if you agree that that's what they are) are a function of the movie's structure and not their shortcomings.
I:9343;2347;the two actors whose stories are pretty much contained within the day of the movie .
I:9343;2348;Interestingly, both are highly sympathetic characters, and they too give very fine performances.
I:9343;2349;Cruise has a terrific scene (rather a number of intercuts to the same scene) in which a news reporter interviews him and starts probing his past .
I:9343;2350;it's really quite chilling (Cruise plays a male self.
I:9343;2351;help guru whose schtick is motivating men to become manipulators of women).
I:9343;2352;When you consider these two sets of characters structurally in the movie, then you can see that the power of the past .
I:9343;2353;to do deep and lasting harm is one of the director's concerns.
I:9343;2354;but the organization of the multiple narratives gives it a fresh and involving twist.
I:9343;2355;"Stanley has a spectacular meltdown on set, and the last words we hear from him in the movie are to his father :""You've got to be nicer to me."""
I:9343;2356;so . . . see the movie.
I:9343;2357;There are interesting story lines that I haven't even mentioned.
I:9343;2358;Music is very well used, the cinematography is unobtrusively fine, and it has a weather event at the end that (as they say) you won't believe.
I:9343;2359;Guaranteed: the next time I see any of these names .
I:9343;2360;The critical acclaim, academy award nominations, intriguing previews, all.
I:9343;2361;The first five minutes of the movie started out pretty interestingly, which peaked my interest even more.
I:9343;2362;at least half the movie was dedicated to filling you in on what happened in these people's lives before this day and the rest builds toward piecing itself together.
I:9343;2363;In my opinion, true 'Worst of the Year' films intrigue you with promises of twisting plots and draw you in with a truck load of super stars, only to leave you frustrated and wishing you had spent your time doing anything but watching it.
I:9343;2364;Paul Thomas Anderson is a powerful new voice in American cinema.
I:9343;2365;with MAGNOLIA, Paul Thomas Anderson solidifies his stance in Hollywood as a modern Bergman, someone who understands and can accurately capture the human condition on celluloid.
I:9343;2366;As Ingmar Bergman tended to present crises of faith and redemption that reached down to touch the depths of your soul, Anderson does the same thing, and like Bergman, the message comes across technically and artistically through graceful tracking shots, meticulous editing, and powerful performances from a talented ensemble cast.
I:9343;2367;The interactions between the characters are so intricately woven into the narrative and so complex that an attempt to elaborate in this review would definitely lead to spoilers for those who have yet to see the film.
I:9343;2368;We see them communicate with God and search for God, until ultimately, God finds them in the most miraculous and spectacular of ways.
I:9343;2369;this is a film that has the power to either change lives or change the way you perceive the world and those around you.
I:9343;2370;The strength of the film lies not only in the masterful direction, but in the performances.
I:9343;2371;With a cast that includes Tom Cruise, John C. Reilly, Julianne Moore, William H. Macy, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Jason Robards, and Philip Baker Hall, Paul Thomas Anderson achieves the extraordinary.
I:9343;2372;When they do, it is wonderful.
I:9343;2373;as for the films controversial finale, it is one of the most memorable moments in the history of cinema .
I:9343;2374;a pure example of the way in which God finds his way into modern cinema.
I:9343;2375;and the perfect ending to a perfect film.
I:9343;2376;All performances are top notch, the best of all being that of former pretty boy turned damn fine actor Tom Cruise.
I:9343;2377;His scene by the bed with his dad is absolutely gut.
I:9343;2378;FEaturing many wonderful songs by former Til Tuesday girl Aimee Mann, the soundtrack is also money well spent.
I:9343;2379;"It is, in my opinion, not only Paul Thomas's magnum opus
I:9343;2380;Yes it's a tenuous link but that's fine.
I:9343;2381;Get some very good script writers and excellent actors and you've got an award.
I:9343;2382;A superbly scripted, acted and directed set of short stories bundled together and called a movie.
I:9343;2383;"Each one in it's own right is a gem
I:9343;2384;I liked Magnolia in the theatre.
I:9343;2385;The performances are really good, but it doesn't matter because the movie is to nuts and takes you out.
I:9343;2386;"The best part of this movie is the song by Aimee Mann called ""Save Me""."
I:9343;2387;the acting from all performers is exceptional.
I:9343;2388;John C. Reilly delivers a subtle performance as police officer Jim Kurring, a lonely heart who meets a troubled Claudia Gator (played by Melora Walters) and wants to help her escape her past.
I:9343;2389;the music in this film adds to the message.
I:9343;2390;"One scene shows each of the main characters singing along to ""Wise Up"" by Aimee Mann."
I:9343;2391;"The chorus ""it's not going to stop until you wise up"" is profound and we wonder: Will they wise up?"
I:9343;2392;Instead, this film rivals Robert Altman's classic works for its complex storytelling and character development.
I:9343;2393;Magnolia is a provocative, thought.
I:9343;2394;provoking, and satisfying film that reflects on human emotion.
I:9343;2395;For those of you who, like me, thought this movie sounded too strange when it first came out and never got around to seeing it, my advice is, see it immediately!
I:9343;2396;it is still one of the most impressive movies I've ever seen.
I:9343;2397;In this movie, Anderson asks a profound question, and while he gives his own answer pretty clearly, he nonetheless gives the viewer plenty of room to provide his/her own answer(s).
I:9343;2398;The performances are absolutely topnotch (this is the one movie I actually LIKED Tom Cruise in, and that is saying something indeed), the plotlines are interesting and well.
I:9343;2399;developed, the cinematography is interesting without taking over .
I:9343;2400;At the end of the movie I felt simultaneously satisfied and wanting more .
I:9343;2401;a great way to end a movie.
I:9343;2402;The thoughts and sentiments that Anderson wishes to convey with this sweeping opus take some time to develop.
I:9343;2403;This outstanding movie has some dragging moments at the start, but make certain to watch carefully!
I:9343;2404;In fact, you must view the movie at least three or four times to fully appreciate this young master's complex work.
I:9343;2405;the casting is flawless with the exception of Cruise.
I:9343;2406;True movie afficionados wait for his next movie with enthusiastic anticipation.
I:9343;2407;Everything in this movie is great, from the dialogue to the awesome soundtrack.
I:9343;2408;The characters in Magnolia are so well written it's like taking a peek into a family's home.
I:9343;2409;Jeremy Blackman (Stanley Spector) was my favorite and the rest of the cast were simply terrific.
I:9343;2410;I loved this movie because of the irony and symbolism mostly.
I:9343;2411;i say watch this film for yourself and you'll see what I'm talking about.
I:9343;2412;Magnolia has a lot to recommend it .
I:9343;2413;very talented cast, outstanding performances, interesting story lines and a great soundtrack.
I:9343;2414;The movie is so well done, that even the raining frogs seem to make sense.
I:9343;2415;All the performances are terrific and interesting, from Tom Cruise as a malevolent motivational speaker to the bit.
I:9343;2416;part Luis, a cantankerous but very funny game show contestant.
I:9343;2417;Perhaps it takes a few viewings to fully get all the connections.)
I:9343;2418;I did appreciate the fine performances and music, but wished I'd picked a more uplifting film on which to spend those three hours.
I:9343;2419;Earl want to see his son Frank Tom Cruise, in his best role!
I:9343;2420;In the end theres a nice realistic Frograin who brings everything back to normal!
I:9343;2421;Thats one of the best films yet, which you can talk about for a long time, and includes a wonderful Soundtrack by Aimee Man!
I:9343;2422;There is so much to be said about this film.
I:9343;2423;Brilliant writing, directing and performances.
I:9343;2424;Special thanks to Tom Cruise and Julianna Moore for wonderful performances.
I:9343;2425;This is an excellent movie which takes you on a kaleidoscopical and rhythmical journey of lives.
I:9343;2426;The film as art is top.
I:9343;2427;time favorite lines in this movie.
I:9343;2428;She is definitely into the whole post.
I:9343;2429;modern swing a little more than I am, but I thought I would give it a go.
I:9343;2430;Perhaps Moore's character was wacko and high.
I:9343;2431;"I was thinking that ""Chocolat"" did a better job in emotionally engaging you with it's post."
I:9343;2432;I somehow was able to glimpse a depth behind the schtick .
I:9343;2433;after that moment, I somewhat followed and enjoyed the various other emotional tones the movie was trying to bring out.
I:9343;2434;The cokehead's desire for honesty because she was sick of trying to please people was somewhat touching.
I:9343;2435;The cop's ability to stand up to rejection and to reach through the wall of the cokehead's defense was heartwarming.
I:9343;2436;Excellent script, fantastic acting, wonderful soundtrack, beautiful cinematography.
I:9343;2437;It's just a beautiful film.
I:9343;2438;Sometimes the actual beauty of it all overwhelmed me and I found myself teary eyed.
I:9343;2439;It's a complicated film released in a simple world.
I:9343;2440;I honestly don't understand how anybody could dislike this movie, but I realize that it takes a certain kind of person to enjoy it.
I:9343;2441;And I'm that kind of person.
I:9343;2442;"There's as much to admire as there is to pick at, and while ""Magnolia"" has great performances and a promising premise, it's a strange step backward for the director who gave us the vastly superior ""Boogie Nights."""
I:9343;2443;And while Paul Thomas Anderson is a gifted and articulate screenwriter, he must have skipped the class in film school that taught dramatic subtlety.
I:9343;2444;The score, while lush and beautiful, gets overempowering for a huge portion of the movie as it tries to underscore the film's dramatic tension.
I:9343;2445;Hitchcock will tell you that less is often more.
I:9343;2446;The first time i saw the trailer for this movie, i said, i know thats gonna be a good movie, and it turned out it was.
I:9343;2447;I've watched this movie numerous times and its breathtaking, everything about it is so lively, the reason i feel people dont like this movie is because they can't face the facts.
I:9343;2448;hubris and frailty of the human heart.
I:9343;2449;The opening 10 minutes of this film were great, exploring the urban legend of the diver who was scooped up by a water carrying plane on its way to a bush fire, after the fire the diver is found in a smouldering tree!
I:9343;2450;here comes a great film!
I:9343;2451;from a really entertaining intro came a bunch of little stories that climax into 1 plot.
I:9343;2452;hour Magnolia that is pure genius.
I:9343;2453;in a stunning, tender performance).
I:9343;2454;Another great segment of the film belongs to Jeremy Blackman, a talented young actor capable of evoking sympathy without acting cute or mannered.
I:9343;2455;The game show event, in which Spector decides to take a stand against the adult establishment that has abused him, is one of the most powerful and gripping scenes in film history.
I:9343;2456;some children, some women, some adulters and abusers (who a less capable director might see as strictly bad people) and all damaged souls with a humanness and decency, both sad and uplifting.
I:9343;2457;note: the music in this film is fantastic.
I:9343;2458;aimee mann's songs and jon brion's (fiona apple's producer) score compliment and sometimes actually involve the action brilliantly.

I:9343;2460;an incredible spectacle of a film, opening with the notion that there are no coincidences and that events transpire not by chance, but for a purpose and closes after over three hours with a brilliant underlying message paved by symbolism.

I:9343;2464;director P. t. Anderson manages to juggle all of these characters very well throughout the film, intertwining the plot points with ease and sincerity.
I:9343;2465;"Along with spectacular performances from Cruise, Moore, and Reilly, ""Magnolia"" possesses two incredibly memorable moments: 1) the unison sing."
I:9343;2466;"along to Aimee Mann's ""Wise Up"" is superbly hilarious and melancholy all."

I:9343;2469;"A genuine effort to show the desolation that engulfs when expectations are not met and mistakes are made, ""Magnolia cultivates into a film that glorifies the courage, calamity, and love that transpires throughout life."
I:9343;2470;"A great idea, a grand ensemble cast, and an amazing musical contribution from Aimee Mann
I:9343;2471;"A very good film, just no ""American Beauty""."
I:9343;2472;I've seen this movie before, and love it every time I come back.
I:9343;2473;Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Tom Cruise are both at their finest.
I:9343;2474;Phillip Baker Hall is also perfect.
I:9343;2475;The entire movie is a tour de force for director PT Anderson.
I:9343;2476;If you love studies of human frailty, you'll find this to be one of the best.
I:9343;2477;Magnolia has moments of brilliance, like intense performances by the red haired actress (her name escapes me), and an unconventional style of directing by Paul Thomas Anderson (king of the zoom in close up!)
I:9343;2478;The music of Aimee Mann also works effectively for this film, giving it a stately presence of somber bleakness.
I:9343;2479;Watching this film is like watching a train.
I:9343;2480;The acting is so good, the people so flawed but so real that becomes uncomfortable to see.
I:9343;2481;Like so many others have said, this is Cruise's finest work to date.
I:9343;2482;"as an example of ensemble acting, ""Magnolia"" is the film to watch."
I:9343;2483;It's going to freak them out!)
I:9343;2484;"The characters don't to react to frogs falling from the sky
I:9343;2485;, the film is one I will continue to go back to just for the pleasure of watching a cast of great actors at the top of their game, and to participate in some truly great film making and honest story telling.
I:9343;2486;ray releaes does add a new dimension to the film, especially the sound (that is so important in this movie).
I:9343;2487;I would have enjoyed both more than I did (and I really, really liked both of them) had he narrowed his scope.
I:9343;2488;help seminar, everything about Phillip Seymour Hoffman.
I:9343;2489;Terror in Tiny Town is a more sincere effort.
I:9343;2490;One of the most INTRICATE MOVIES I HAVE EVER SEEN, I think that everyone speeks rightly when they say that the movie didnt make much since or that it did not even weave in and out as much as everyone thought it would, But it is still an excellent film.
I:9343;2491;it does capture the viewer to the point that you have to watch everything and not miss one beat, much like a soap oprah but with REAL PEOPLE, they did not even look or act like actors, they actually did an excellent job of becoming those people.
I:9343;2492;excellent job acting or should I say looking like real people in real life situations with a camera that just so happens to be filming everything.
I:9343;2493;this is Acedog from THE LUCKYDOG NEWSLETTER: MOVIE REVIEW Have a wonderful Frogday afternoon.
I:9343;2494;First off, I have to say that this truly is my favorite movie.
I:9343;2495;The performances are stellar, the art direction is beatiful, and the writing/directing are fabulous.
I:9343;2496;Magnolia slowly became my favorite film of last year.
I:9343;2497;"Aimee Mann's music is the perfect backdrop to the film
I:9343;2498;magnolia is a masterful movie with masterful cinematography, art direction, acting, editing and .
I:9343;2499;The movie is quirky but thoroughly engaging to anyone interested in drama .
I:9343;2500;that is the human condition and emotion, and human conflict (internal and external).
I:9343;2501;Like a fine wine, its complexity can be overlooked, so keep your senses on full alert!The most stunning aspect of the movie are the risks the actors take.
I:9343;2502;Yup, Cruz gives a stunning performance, and that's coming from, how should I put it, a non.
I:9343;2503;The rest of the star studded cast deliver in full taking tremendous risks and displaying a complexity of emotion that you just don't see in most movies.
I:9343;2504;Performances as well as story turns had me at times amused, at times entranced, and at times, in tears.
I:9343;2505;Agreed, you need some patience and open mindedness to appreciate this one, but in the end, I found it well worth the effort.
I:9343;2506;This is one of the most defining films of 1999.
I:9343;2507;The work that PTA put into shines through in every scene.
I:9343;2508;He put a lot of hard work into a film that turns out to be one of the best of 99.
I:9343;2509;The story revolves around nine people, one day, and many unexpected and highly emotional events.
I:9343;2510;That is not the case with Magnolia as Anderson has created a longer, more daring, more complicated, and more cohesive film that rather than sprawling several decades spans just a single day.
I:9343;2511;Magnolia is certainly a film that challenges much of the formulaic tendencies of Hollywood, and for that alone is commendable.
I:9343;2512;It is also mostly brilliant.
I:9343;2513;At the very least he had created a film great enough for us to endessly debate its merits as art and entertainment.
I:9343;2514;cutting as the stories gradually begin to interweave into a (mostly) cohesive whole.
I:9343;2515;One has to be paying careful attention for about the first hour or becomming lost in the complexity is quite a realistic option.
I:9343;2516;on top of the intrguing storyline is Anderson's immense skill as a director.
I:9343;2517;His ability to dazzle us visually while advancing the narrative is quite a feat.
I:9343;2518;I was most impressed by how well he is able to shift from moments frequent of comic bliss to the more intense and grating dramatic sequences.
I:9343;2519;Much of this success was due to his varied and adventerous camerawork.
I:9343;2520;Anderson is a good starting point for gaining of appreciating the director's art, mainly because his style is so extroverted.
I:9343;2521;Its also an important look at the tendencies of the newest generation of American film.
I:9343;2522;PT Anderson already provided us with an impressive corpus of work and hopefully many more of his films will grace screens around the world.
I:9343;2523;This film is exceptionally well.
I:9343;2524;And that's about all it does.
I:9343;2525;It goes from expertly intercut five.
I:9343;2526;way scene to expertly intercut five.

I:9343;2533;way scene to expertly intercut five.
I:9343;2534;In a theatre, on a big screen, the film had a very real impact that is considerably lessened by moving to televison.
I:9343;2535;The film's considerable strengths were increased on a big screen.
I:9343;2536;The film's even more considerable weaknesses are more profoundly evident on video.
I:9343;2537;up to Boogie Nights has another extravagant cast.
I:9343;2538;William H. Macy, Juliane Moore, and Tom Cruise are the biggest of the names but Anderson's works aren't about selling .
I:9343;2539;This is an intelligent story of love, loss, confusion and many other juicy storylines that everyone loves.
I:9343;2540;Aimee Mann provides nine songs to the film and soundtrack including the Academy Award nominated Save Me .
I:9343;2541;Wise Up is featured in the casts sing.
I:9343;2542;Tom Cruise's role as the male dominate sex machine will offend many but it is wonderful acting reguardless.
I:9343;2543;This is a bold film that will be enjoyed by many (the one's that don't mind three hour movies) and will be hated by many (people that don't get it ).
I:9343;2544;For those that don't get it , the theme is simple, be loving to your children because they need you and you'll need them.
I:9343;2545;Boogie Nights was mildly amusing at best.
I:9343;2546;Even the two most seemingly interesting characters .
I:9343;2547;The entire movie is anti.
I:9343;2548;depth, intelligent dialog that analyzed the events of everyday life.
I:9343;2549;This film is nothing short of a masterpiece.
I:9343;2550;The characters are so well.
I:9343;2551;The film also intro'd me to Aimee Mann, and I eventually bought (and I love) the soundtrack as well.
I:9343;2552;Simply: This is a great film even if somewhat of an epic (it does run a little long.
I:9343;2553;But it's worth it to set aside the time and watch it.
I:9343;2554;i love movies, and usually can stay entertained by Teletubbies, but this movie was ridculous.
I:9343;2555;This is not ingenious, or profound.
I:9343;2556;PTA uses his signature stalker sequences, and beautiful crane shots in his third film, and his best, Magnolia .
I:9343;2557;It's great to see him maturing as a filmmaker, and to also see him still writing about life situations/plots.
I:9343;2558;I love this film so much, and it's on my X. mas list for 2003.
I:9343;2559;this is the true definition of a five star film.
I:9343;2560;The previews made it look like such a good movie.
I:9343;2561;That 'Magnolia' is a masterpiece and that whoever doesn't like it just doesn't 'get it'?
I:9343;2562;All I ask is for people to try it out, because it packs a great message with some wonderful cinematography and acting.
I:9343;2563;I knew basically nothing about this movie when it began and was fairly excited for a noteworthy cast to deliver a respectable performance.
I:9343;2564;I sincerely hope that the critics out there stopencouraging Mr. Anderson.
I:9343;2565;i'm sure it's possible to enjoy 'Magnolia' and 'BoogieNights' and 'Hard Eight.'
I:9343;2566;There are great actorsin `Magnolia' (and a few mediocre ones), but a great actingclass is still only acting class.
I:9343;2567;He has her acting styledown to perfection.
I:9343;2568;Cruise in his most powerful role.
I:9343;2569;The movie is a great story that reminds watchers where and why love exists in all our lives.
I:9343;2570;P. t. Anderson had been my favorite director ever since I saw this movie about 10 yrs ago for the first time.
I:9343;2571;This movie is so close to my heart .
I:9343;2572;Rarely does a film capture what is important about existence.
I:9343;2573;I bought a copy for a good friend.
I:9343;2574;I found this movie to have the best and longest build up that I have ever seen on screen.
I:9343;2575;PT anderson directs this movie as an epic and he paints this expansive story about a bunch of individuals with an operatic pallete.
I:9343;2576;The soundtrack score is the most bold and audacious.
I:9343;2577;The director and the composer are being bold here.
I:9343;2578;Right from the prologue scene up until say 45 mins into the movie, PT anderson builds the scenario with the bold score and his balletic and long steady cam shots.
I:9343;2579;The problem is that the the build up is so good that the movie is forever building up.
I:9343;2580;"The premise we are given is that these seemingly disconnected lives playing out in parallel are going to come together in some unexpected commonality or shall we say a kind of ""got you"" twist ending."
I:9343;2581;PT anderson's amazing direction of the story makes us believe there is more to this and there is a higher plan in all of this that we are not seeing.
I:9343;2582;I enjoyed the film for the pure art of the film making of it and the amazing element of suspense that is bred into the story which keeps us guessing on where the story is heading.
I:9343;2583;Although the matter in the story is little, the style and execution of the screen play is eye candy.
I:9343;2584;It's one of those 3 hr movies which you can actually see again right after you finished your first viewing.
I:9343;2585;Having enjoyed his performance in Boogie Nights, along with the rest of the film, I decided to watch Magnolia.
I:9343;2586;magnolia has one of the most interesting openers a movie has ever had.
I:9343;2587;An opener that warns us that coincidence and fate have a peculiar method of showing themselves sometimes.
I:9343;2588;I was rewarded with that and so much more.
I:9343;2589;every performance done in this movie are performances to be admired.
I:9343;2590;i believe Tom does his best performance in this movie.
I:9343;2591;One scene in particular, Tom shows was he's capable of in a matter of seconds.
I:9343;2592;and the rest of this great cast all have their moments to shine.
I:9343;2593;paul Thomas Anderson's wonderful follow.
I:9343;2594;what happens towards the end of the movie is worth the price alone.
I:9343;2595;There are a some good things about this movie though!
I:9343;2596;Also, Cruise plays a great egomaniac!
I:9343;2597;All of their lives intersect in Los Angeles in this marvelously acted if slighly overwrought drama.
I:9343;2598;Although it's a bit overlong with too many crescendos, it's another well made ensemble piece from Anderson.
I:9343;2599;everybody focuses on the frogs and their meaning.
I:9343;2600;the stories are framed by Aimee Mann's thoughtful, melodic songs and Jon Brion's effective score.
I:9343;2601;While it isn't a perfect film, it's notable for its ambitious story and the Altman.
I:9343;2602;like structure of the film.
I:9343;2603;"In fact, ""Short Cuts"" and ""Magnolia"" have a lot in common except that Altman's film works as a sustained narrative better than Paul Thomas Anderson's film."
I:9343;2604;both are extremely talented film directors with their own unique view of the world.
I:9343;2605;The 5.1 sound mix sounds terrific although some of the dialogue was drowned out at the trimphumant conclusion of the film if listened to in 2.0 format vs. the 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround format.
I:9343;2606;the extras include an exceptionally good documentary on the making of the movie which, while illuminating, isn't always enlightening.
I:9343;2607;There are good performances by Tom Cruise and Julianne Moore.
I:9343;2608;The acting is great by everyone.
I:9343;2609;There are some funny moments.
I:9343;2610;The surprise climax is quite breathtaking (and somewhat humorous).
I:9343;2611;This movie has become my favorite movie of all time.
I:9343;2612;The mark of a truly great film is how long its memory stays with you after you have seen it and whether the ideas contained within it lead to a change within you and in your actions.
I:9343;2613;this is certainly a very, VERY complex film.
I:9343;2614;the film can be understood as an explanation of a monologue set at the beginning of the film, spoken by a cop.
I:9343;2615;In this, the cop explains his philosophy for day to day living, that every day he tries to go out and do good.
I:9343;2616;and then we see the film and the film is an explanation.
I:9343;2617;but it is more than a simple, moralistic tale, the film is in part a description of the mystery and reason behind the actions of God, as well as containing some of the most fantastic acting, dialogue and a stunning soundrack to boot.
I:9343;2618;It is delivered with such style, such attention to detail and artistry that every moment, every scene has more to it than the simple events which go on within them.
I:9343;2619;There is something so much deeper going on here, something fundamental as to what drives us as human beings.
I:9343;2620;then this film, for you, might be a gift.
I:9343;2621;Sure the acting was great, but these actors are always good.
I:9343;2622;The story was TERRIBLE!I read in many reviews how the movie was so beautiful .
I:9343;2623;Each time as fresh as the last.
I:9343;2624;it is so refreshing to see a film willing to tackle human emotion especially in this era of mind numbing entertainment.
I:9343;2625;so, in closing, I urge everyone to partake in 3 hours of astounding cinematics, excellent acting performances, and a refreshing screenplay.
I:9343;2626;the fact is that you must see this film simply to see tom cruise act and act WELL.
I:9343;2627;"I was introduced to one of my favourite actors via this movie: William H. Macy, who is amazing in such movies as ""Panic"" and ""Focus."""
I:9343;2628;"where it all just hits you and sit back, breathing heavily for a moment, saying ""Wow."""
I:9343;2629;written scenes, excellent camera work, and a clear personal involvment of the writer/director.
I:9343;2630;There are several reasons for this, the most important being the length.
I:9343;2631;In fact, it is a sign of Anderson's talent as a narrator that he can keep all the storylines immediately recognizable and easy to follow.
I:9343;2632;The music is quite obtrusive in this film .
I:9343;2633;not my cup of tea, but for fans of the genre I'm sure they're a treat.
I:9343;2634;I have a strong suspiscion that Paul Thomas Anderson was totally bowled over by Short Cuts and deliberately intended to make a similar film.
I:9343;2635;In some ways he has succeeded, but on the whole Altman's work is still far superior and more mature.
I:9343;2636;And the grand natural cataclysm finish didn't work there either.
I:9343;2637;In general good but not exceptional features.
I:9343;2638;as for the film, simply astonishing.
I:9343;2639;The plot is a series of orbiting stories that come together in a themeatic way that is satisfying.
I:9343;2640;the score is excellent as are Amiee Mann's songs.
I:9343;2641;It sounds hoaky but was dramatically effective and touching.
I:9343;2642;Each story is bittersweet yet intertwine into a logic specific to the film.
I:9343;2643;You feel the sadness and are able to extrapolate the humor and irony within Magnolia.
I:9343;2644;this is a excellent film that may require some effort on some people's part.
I:9343;2645;If you enjoy stylish films .
I:9343;2646;stylish, not slick Hollywood .
I:9343;2647;eventually, i really got into this film.
I:9343;2648;you see, in the opening, most of the performances were either strong or pretty good minus julianne moore's, of whom was just kinda.
I:9343;2649;It's one of those movies that I will watch over and over again and see something new each time.
I:9343;2650;So many stellar performances, such humane characters, beautiful music and great story lines.
I:9343;2651;After seeing it 3 times, I now realize it's a brilliant work and one of the all time classics for a drama.
I:9343;2652;All of the actors completely immersed themselves into their roles.
I:9343;2653;This type of passion is rarely seen in today's cinema.
I:9343;2654;Paul thomas anderson captured magic in a bottle and Magnolia lives on as a documantation of brilliant cinema.
I:9343;2655;It is story driven and character driven and it is why Paul Thomas Anderson in my oppinion is one of the best directors and writers in Hollywood.
