I:36;1;greed clarifies, cuts through, and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit.
I:36;2;After all, the decade that WALL STREET famously and entertainingly captured with it's Reagan.
I:36;3;"era credo that ""greed is good"" is still so very much with us in so many ways."
I:36;4;And of coarse it is because that is the American way.
I:36;5;this is one of Oliver Stone's best.
I:36;6;As has been said countless times Michael Douglas is superb as one of cinema's all time great villains.
I:36;7;There are rewards for those who can pick winners in the stock market.
I:36;8;Information is a valuable commodity, it can win battles.
I:36;9;Gekko is also a shrewd investor in commodities like works of art.
I:36;10;Bud's new found wealth allows him to pay back his debts, and then move to a new apartment in the East Side.
I:36;11;"the ""Stock Watch"" group noted how Teldar was in play."
I:36;12;If ownership is widely distributed then management has a free hand to reward itself.
I:36;13;There is a dramatic scene between Bud and his father.
I:36;14;[This allows bigger companies to eliminate competition and then raise their prices.]
I:36;15;valued assets and sell them at a higher price.
I:36;16;[This film shows the high.
I:36;17;I had never watched this movie, but a friend recommended it to me.
I:36;18;I enjoyed watching it online through Amazon.
I:36;19;It was bringing back old memories so I bought him and I each the 20th anniversary edition!
I:36;20;Its everything you wish you could do but never would!Put Michael Douglass with Charlie and Martin Sheen and its a great entertaining movie!
I:36;21;Greed eventually crosses the line the end is predictable but there is a very good reason why so many businessmen love this movie!
I:36;22;"Having Daryl Hannah nude in a bedroom scene with Charlie is a ""bonus"" guy track!Give it with Boiler Room as a great one two punch since Boiler Room has a fantastic scene of those actors (Vin Diesel and Giovanni Ribisi) watching Wall Street on TV and acting it out in Vin's living room word for word."
I:36;23;great Guy Gift, its timeless and never falls short of entertaining!
I:36;24;Wall Street is the Oliver Stone's classic.
I:36;25;Best movie ever and watching it on blu.
I:36;26;Director Oliver Stone managed to capture on.
I:36;27;screen the `80s decade perfectly.
I:36;28;Wall Street is a very good movie thanks to the script, the direction, the dialogues, and above all the performances of the lead actors Michael Douglas, Charlie Sheen and Martin Sheen, all of them gave an outstanding performance, specially Michael Douglas in the role that got him an Academy Award.
I:36;29;as usual, Oliver Stone created a very personal movie, he co. wrote the screenplay and dedicated the story to his father, a former stockholder.
I:36;30;But Stone didn't exclude the audience because the movie presents the fascinating and complex world in Wall Street, and also the movie shows very human feelings such as the ambition, the greed, the envy, the revenge and the personal integrity.
I:36;31;Wall Street is a very interesting and entertaining movie, very recommendable.
I:36;32;also reflects the spirit of 1980's NYC.
I:36;33;Gives a great insight to the world of money.
I:36;34;What Oliver Stone attempted to make .
I:36;35;dimensional, it will be very interesting to see that Stone and Sheen actually put a lot of their thought and effort into it.
I:36;36;With friends like these, who needs enemies .
I:36;37;it is true that people who go to war are inextricably changed by it.
I:36;38;so to be fair that's his view at looking at modern life.
I:36;39;and for that reason he puts in the romance of Hannah to appeal to a larger audience.
I:36;40;and he was surprised she took the role.
I:36;41;as the union capitalist debate in this film dovetails.
I:36;42;The world of union politics versus capitalism,of the workers international,belongs in 'hard times' and charles dickens,the world we inhabit today is a globalized world.
I:36;43;the countries moving ahead now are also internally restructuring in this complex world.
I:36;44;every nation today is capitalist.
I:36;45;a modern economy is really needed and all that means to be successful.
I:36;46;but a good film viewed many years later.
I:36;47;with three of my favorite people many years ago surprisingly in this film,in which the author uses his war experiences to develop a fable.
I:36;48;I have seen this movie over one hundred times and each time I watch it, it gets even better.
I:36;49;This movie will inspire you to go after whatever it is that you want out of life .
I:36;50;love, wealth, power, or whatever .
I:36;51;work hard, work smart .
I:36;52;and be richly and justly rewarded.
I:36;53;Our free market is what has made our country #1 and the envy of the entire world.
I:36;54;In America, anyone can succeed!
I:36;55;This movie is a true classic which captured an entire era .
I:36;56;Great lines, great scenes, this is my favorite movie of all time!PLEASE E. mail FOXMOVIES@FOX.
I:36;57;With corporate greed and the money hungry mongrels it shines a speck of light on what can be the amazing yet confusing world of the stock market.
I:36;58;This was a great movie.
I:36;59;Michael Douglas, Charlie Sheen and his Dad are irreplaceble in this flick!
I:36;60;"While the subject of the stock market and trading on Wall Street doesn't interest me in the least, I loved how Oliver Stone made it interesting is ""Wall Street""."
I:36;61;It stands as one of his most intellegent and accomplished films, with a smart (if overly.
I:36;62;technical) script and superb acting.
I:36;63;He works his days selling stocks, all the while hoping to be a player in the same league as the big guys.
I:36;64;He takes Fox under his wing, gives him a taste of the wealth and power, and Fox becomes insatiable.
I:36;65;The acting in this movie is first rate, especially from Michael Douglas.
I:36;66;Oliver Stone's commentary is insightful and articulate, even though he rambles and speaks in an annoying deep voice.
I:36;67;"The ""Making Of"" documentary is a real treat."
I:36;68;"Simply titled ""Money Never Sleeps"", it is over 1 hour of new interviews with the cast and crew, discussing all major points of the movie and the stories behind the scenes."
I:36;69;exclusive documentaries I have seen.
I:36;70;"whether or not you find the subject interesting, ""Wall Street"" is a great movie in almost every way."
I:36;71;While the script wanders off into technical stock jargon, it is one of the best scripts I have ever seen put to film.
I:36;72;The acting is top notch, and Oliver Stone directs with panache and style.
I:36;73;The movie is a classic.
I:36;74;director Oliver Stone aptly depicts the culture of corporate greed and those who lead that rat pack in an exploration of the morality of placing profits over people.
I:36;75;collar party seems to have no end, as those willing to play the game by day will be rewarded with riches that millions can only dream about.
I:36;76;WALL STREET has always been one of my favourite Oliver Stone films.
I:36;77;from his Greed is good speech to the way he handles day to day deals with ruthless efficiency, you can see how Michael Douglas nailed this role of the ultimate amoral insider and deservedly won the Oscar that year for Best Actor.
I:36;78;the transfer is crisp and clear with good sound but the real selling points are the fascinating documentary .
I:36;79;which features Douglas and Charlie Sheen and their views and thoughts of the film after all this time .
I:36;80;and Stone's informative and candid audio commentary.
I:36;81;for someone like myself who has seen this film a zillion times, listening to Stone's observations on his movie was a real treat.
I:36;82;along with GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS, this is one of THE best films about money, greed and the people who ruthlessly pursue it.
I:36;83;Wall Street is truly a great film that accurately portrays attitudes of the 80's and unfortunately the 90's as well.
I:36;84;The acting, directing, storyline, camera.
I:36;85;More important than friends, more important than people, more important than life itself.
I:36;86;"That alone should make the man worthy of ridicule!Another comment I had issue with was that you had to be a ""bleeding heart"" to believe that capitalism is unfair and promotes greed."
I:36;87;"Honest capitalists will only argue that "" by gosh, its the best system we've got, Look at whats it did in Latin America for crying out loud, Socialism is a failure, look at Sweden for example!"""
I:36;88;Amazon, please get the message across.
I:36;89;This is Oliver Stone's disection of inside trading on Wall Street and the road to big bucks.
I:36;90;First half of the movie was fun.
I:36;91;"A movie, which is art, should portray the the world as it ""might and ought to be""."
I:36;92;A great look at the world of stock trading, Oliver Stone's Wall Street is very realistic.
I:36;93;successful firm in New York City.
I:36;94;Gordon is one of the richest men in the industry, in a donald Trump like role.
I:36;95;He then takes young Bud under his wing and shows him the ropes.
I:36;96;The writing is excellent, as is with an Oliver Stone movie.
I:36;97;Douglas definitely deserves his Oscar, but Stone should have also won for direction.
I:36;98;This is a must see.
I:36;99;west economy versus a planned economy and relegate this film to 1980's era nostalgia, like the now humorously giant cell phone Gekko is talking on as he walks along the beach.
I:36;100;The labor force that serves them, however, are in the wild.
I:36;101;west economy that was once advocated for everyone.
I:36;102;for scarce good jobs, good health care, education, etc.
I:36;103;It is a great movie, 1985 the stock markets are hot, people are making money.
I:36;104;Everything in the world is good and this movie captures it all.
I:36;105;classic story of good vs. bad.
I:36;106;"Wall Street is interesting as an entertaining and compelling story, that made for a very enjoyable movie experience
I:36;107;Greed is right, greed works.
I:36;108;Greed clarifies, cuts through, and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit.
I:36;109;Director Oliver Stone wanted this character to be the villain, giving him the name of a lizard.
I:36;110;Oliver Stone takes chances in his films, and though they don't always turn out the way he plans, you have to admire the man.
I:36;111;This film in particular really captured an era, and he showed tremendous foresight, in fact it was released in 1987, just before one of the biggest stock market melt.
I:36;112;It also shows the power of information, and even though that information is used to manipulate the market and destroy companies, it truly does foreshadow The Information Age.
I:36;113;so, this movie is enjoyable on these two levels, as entertaining drama, and as a serious message about money, capitalism, and the rampant greed of the late 80s, but it is also entertaining just for the behind the scenes drama of the people in it.
I:36;114;first, there is a very strong father/son element to Wall Street.
I:36;115;The film is dedicated to him.
I:36;116;And, Oliver Stone's own son, Sean Stone, plays one of Gordon Gekko's children.
I:36;117;Oliver Stone was himself a Vietnam veteran, and he had cast Charlie Sheen in Platoon, a big success for them both just the year before.
I:36;118;Father and son both had big success playing soldiers in Viet Nam, and both would have near.
I:36;119;I will revisit the father/son theme later when I discuss Michael Douglas, but back to the Sheen's for now.
I:36;120;Bud Fox's dad works for an airline, and he is hard working and honest.
I:36;121;He is part Irish, and part Spanish, and enjoys being Spanish almost as much as he does being Irish, and he really enjoys being Irish.
I:36;122;He also knows all the lyrics and can sing every song that was ever sung by Frank Sinatra.
I:36;123;I hold Charlie's accomplishments dearer than my own.
I:36;124;He has been through so much and overcome so much more.
I:36;125;Even if he weren't my son he'd still be my best friend.
I:36;126;Charlie Sheen's real name was Carlos Irwin Est vez.
I:36;127;"He was born a ""blue baby,"" and the doctor who saved him was named Irwin, and hence the middle name."
I:36;128;One of his nick names is Good Time Charlie, and the other is The Machine, which is partly due to his name being Sheen.
I:36;129;continuing the father/son theme, actor Michael Douglas is the son of well.
I:36;130;The elder Douglas is best known for his role as Spartacus.
I:36;131;Michael Douglas had a breakthrough role as Inspector Steve Keller on the TV cop series The Streets of San Francisco.
I:36;132;He played opposite veteran actor Karl Malden.
I:36;133;Recently there was a series on NPR (National Public Radio) of the most memorable characters from film and fiction, and Gordon Gekko was profiled.
I:36;134;Michael Douglas won an Oscar for the role.
I:36;135;gordon Gekko: The most valuable commodity I know of is information.
I:36;136;gordon Gekko: Greed captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit.
I:36;137;The Carnegies, the Mellons, the men that built this great industrial empire, made sure of it because it was their money at stake.
I:36;138;That's right, you, the stockholder.
I:36;139;Greed is right, greed works.
I:36;140;Greed clarifies, cuts through, and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit.
I:36;141;gordon Gekko: Greed is good.
I:36;142;She was nominated for an Oscar for Midnight Cowboy, and has been on the Hollywood/New York party scene for like ever.
I:36;143;James Spader (Sex, Lies and Videotape) plays a lawyer friend of Bud's.
I:36;144;What a classic movie, and was she ever great in it.
I:36;145;even as we speak a writer is working on a sequel to Wall Street.
I:36;146;thanks to the Internet Movie Database and Wikipedia for the quotes and other biographical information.
I:36;147;Thanks to those who do this.
I:36;148;There is a lot of grain in some scenes.
I:36;149;the movie was pretty good, not great.
I:36;150;WALL STREET is that film's title, and a young, wide.
I:36;151;A surrogate father of sorts comes Sheen's way in the devilish shape of Michael Dougas as a huge power player that mutters the immortal tagline: Greed is good.
I:36;152;this great film is quite a morality play and is just one of the shiny gems adorning Stone's filmography.
I:36;153;It is a film that has no clear cut protagonist, just a man who wants to be honest and get rich quick, but finds that one can rarely be both.
I:36;154;it is truly a contemporary classic.
I:36;155;One key scene in that film has the leads gathered together at home viewing WALL STREET.
I:36;156;These shady young brokers know each and every line by heart, showing viewers exactly what these men are and what they want to be.
I:36;157;BOILER ROOM is not as exceptional as WALL STREET, but a good flick nonetheless.
I:36;158;Commanding performances by Michael Douglas and Charlie Sheen punctuate a great movie of the 1980s world of financial capitalism.
I:36;159;Douglas, as Gordon Gekko, leaves you thinking that greed actually is good or that it is the ultimate temptation, or both.
I:36;160;Sheen in wonderful as well as many feel this is his best roll ever.
I:36;161;An excellent drama that is well worth it.
I:36;162;Oliver Stone captures Wall Street in the 1980s in this film.
I:36;163;looking back from the perch of 2002, Gordon Gekko's greed is good speech is a precursor of today's accounting scandals.
I:36;164;The sales manager in this film is perfect.
I:36;165;this great film transcends time.
I:36;166;ray transfers I have seen.
I:36;167;I give it four stars for the movie and one for the blu.
I:36;168;When Oliver Stone made Wall Street, he was riding high from the commercial and critical success ofPlatoon (Special Edition).
I:36;169;He gets most of the film's best dialogue and delivers it with such conviction.
I:36;170;It is one of the strongest scenes in the movie because you really believe what Gekko is saying and how Bud could be seduced by his words.
I:36;171;"He concludes by saying, ""Greed is right
I:36;172;Greed clarifies, cuts through, and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit.
I:36;173;has marked the upward surge of mankind and greed, you mark my words .
I:36;174;"will save not only Teldar Paper but that other malfunctioning corporation called the U. s. a."" This is one of the best delivered monologues ever put to film as Douglas goes from charming to downright threatening and back again, succinctly summing up the essence of '80 capitalism and greed."
I:36;175;As always, Stone delivers the goods, offering all kinds of fascinating insights into the making of the film.
I:36;176;the second disc features a new introduction by Oliver Stone that is brief and really should have been put on the first disc.
I:36;177;"another new extra is ""Greed is Good,"" an hour."
I:36;178;This substantial doc examines the appeal of Gekko and why he inspired people in the business world.
I:36;179;There is a nice little scene with Penn Jillette of Penn and Teller as one of Bud's clients.
I:36;180;The filmmaker puts all of these scenes into context and why there were cut.
I:36;181;"There is very little overlap with the ""Greed is Good"" documentary."
I:36;182;if you're a fan of this film and already own the previous edition, the new extras definitely warrant a double dip.
I:36;183;They are quite substantial in nature and shed more light on this excellent film.
I:36;184;It's hard to find a really good Charlie Sheen movie but this one is for sure!The scenario is great because it is something that can happen to anyone.
I:36;185;A young man finds that in order to get what he wants out of life he has to bend the rules.
I:36;186;The connoisseur of women will no doubt agree with me that a woman's back has a special beauty, and the shots of Daryl Hannah's back in this film were by far its high points.
I:36;187;It captures the essence of capitalism .
I:36;188;what's really at fault, and what I think this movie is, is an expos of human nature!
I:36;189;to be confronted with the equal and opposite reaction to our actions and the moral decisions they bring about!This is what makes this a good film!
I:36;190;Wall Street is a classic film that still has many things to say to people today.
I:36;191;This movie was riveting .
I:36;192;it fed right into my latent, grandiose desire to become rich and powerful and to win the contest.
I:36;193;He may not have salvaged himself perfectly, but he did a damn good job.
I:36;194;the acting, overall, was excellent.
I:36;195;Michael Douglas and Martin Sheen were stunning, and so were most of the lesser characters.
I:36;196;Daryl Hannah was good overall but at some key moments came across as too sweet and gentle for the part.
I:36;197;there's a reason this film remains a classic after over two decades.
I:36;198;however, Michael Douglas alone is worth watching this film and its the performance of his career.
I:36;199;Aside from Platoon it is Oliver Stone's best effort.
I:36;200;Michael Douglas absolutely chilling and Charlie Sheen gives his second best dramatic performance.
I:36;201;It was perfect for the timing!
I:36;202;Oliver Stone was just in time for his new blockbuster hit Wall Street.
I:36;203;The ultimate billion dollar Wall Street baller Gordon Gekko (played by Michael Douglas) is a business savvy money making machine!
I:36;204;A crook nonetheless Gordon was making millions a day and was at his prime.
I:36;205;Stone as usual throws in his idealogical slant and has Martin Sheen in the cast to give us the solid socialist perspective.
I:36;206;From an artistic point of view a good solid movie.
I:36;207;one of Oliver Stone's best movies, it was intended as a morality play in which Stone's mouthpiece, played by Martin Sheen as a stoic airline mechanic who has seen it all, condemned the helter.
I:36;208;"makers the world over: ""Greed is Good."
I:36;209;"and I wasn't the only one, to judge by fellow MBA alums and investment banking colleagues
I:36;210;perfect recitation of Gecko's lines.
I:36;211;era of rich, lush, rapidly moving images and an editing style that wouldn't have been out of place in a music video.
I:36;212;"And Wall Street"" is one of those rare reversals where life imitates art: throughout top."
I:36;213;sporting deal maker has become the ideal, sometimes getting the better of real Wall Street mavericks who let romance cloud their common sense and appeared on the covers of Fortune and Forbes.
I:36;214;"fox, for once, has an opening beyond Gecko's favorite box of cigars: he knows his father's airline, Blue Star, is worth more than the market thinks it is because of impending deregulation in the airlines
I:36;215;the acting is uniformly good: apart from Sheen and Douglas, you have the inimitable Sean Young as Gecko's social.
I:36;216;paced, frenetic, and exotic: the viewer, like Fox, is pulled into the upper reaches of a world where anything is possible and money is the common denominator.
I:36;217;and as a barometer of the notoriously fickle and fast moving Market itself.
I:36;218;"often imitated, never surpassed, ""Wall Street"" is a stylish, intoxicating, stunning embodiment of an era when anybody could carve his way to the very top of American society by ruthless ambition and sheer determination
I:36;219;Boiler Room is the one to watch, at least that has some decent acting.
I:36;220;This movie is a classic!
I:36;221;Anyone who has an entrepreneurial bone in their body must see this movie.
I:36;222;It has a wealth of ideas and facts about how successful individuals on Wall Street succeeded before America started to censor their actions.
I:36;223;"As the character Gordon Gecko stated, ""Information is the most valuable commodity"" and this is still true today."
I:36;224;I received it in plenty of time and in great condition.
I:36;225;I would order from this seller again and recommend them to family and friends.
I:36;226;This Classic film about Wall Street shinanagans is a must see for any film buff.
I:36;227;Michael Douglas gives his best performance.
I:36;228;I just love this movie.
I:36;229;Hello,This move is showing reality of the rich and wealthy running and operating this world.
I:36;230;It was an okay movie is all I can say for it.
I:36;231;This is definitely an Oliver Stone's masterpiece.
I:36;232;i also found the special features very interesting, with some very insightful clues on how the movie was actually made and the message that it should have conveyed (i. e. Behaving like Gordon Ghekko is BAD, Buddy is a model of integrity).
I:36;233;The PQ was not excellent, especially in darker scenes.
I:36;234;it contained significant grain and noise, but adequate to enjoy as a hi.
I:36;235;The AQ was not overwhelming, but sounds and music were correct for each seen, strong throughout.4/5.
I:36;236;The materialism often documented in the 80's appears full throttle, and all characters in the film, except the token reminder of morality.
I:36;237;The film is an interesting portrayal of the time period, but also how a person's character can become compromise.
I:36;238;i was in my teens in the 80's, and the decade holds a certain fascination for me.
I:36;239;The film is one of my favorites of the era, and is definitely worth seeing.
I:36;240;"grabbing serious character examination of the era, and the effect on character that limitless ""aquisition"" of materialism can cause."
I:36;241;the film is still relevant today, as it seems this greed is still present in our society, and has become an accepted norm and side effect of our capitalistic society.
I:36;242;Performances are solid throughout and further/introduce careers of interesting actors, including James Spader.
I:36;243;"I thoroughly enjoyed ""Wall Street"" when it first came out 25."
I:36;244;"fueled roaring 80s and corporate transgression and you get something called ""Wall Street,"" an incredible epic that works because its creator knows that business is ultimately a long game of chess."
I:36;245;And the intoxicating allure of power and mind.
I:36;246;boggling wealth is brought to the forte in Oliver Stone's classic WALL STREET.
I:36;247;And it's just as much fun to watch today as it was in 1987.
I:36;248;charlie Sheen (long before the substance abuse took its toll on his boyish looks) is marvelous as the easily.
I:36;249;"impressed, ultimately overwhelmed Fox
I:36;250;life papa Martin) proud of him, plus make his own way in the world.
I:36;251;Naturally over the course of events Bud's life unravels, and the SEC comes calling.
I:36;252;And at the risk of being redundant, it's very fun to watch.
I:36;253;in addition to Douglas and the two Sheens WALL STREET sports a grand cast, including John C. McGinley, Hal Holbrook, Daryl Hannah, and the wonderful Terence Stamp.
I:36;254;A great look into Dow Jones, rividing look at how money can make you do anything.
I:36;255;Stone well casts this movie, with great performances by the Sheens, and Douglas.
I:36;256;Overall excellent use of story and acting.
I:36;257;This is my favorite movie, and in my opinion, the greatest ever made.
I:36;258;Not only is this movie extremely deep in substance and thought provoking dialogue, but there are some great examples of moral values, as well.
I:36;259;This is such a great movie, I've memorized it line from line.
I:36;260;I forgot how good it was.
I:36;261;I used it for extra credit for a University class.
I:36;262;The original movie, very good and price was right.
I:36;263;Absolutely loved this movie when I went to the Premier.
I:36;264;Really excellent with great acting by Douglas.
I:36;265;This is, quite simply, the greatest film ever made about business and the capital markets.
I:36;266;Wall Street is brilliant and infinitely quotable.
I:36;267;There are just so many good lines in the film delivered to perfection by Michael Douglas.
I:36;268;This is certainly Michael Douglas' best work, for which he most deservedly won the Oscar.
I:36;269;The acting, writing, and directing are phenomenal and culminated in a true masterpiece.
I:36;270;"This is my favorite film
I:36;271;"Anybody who has any interest in the stock market or business must own this film
I:36;272;Must see for teens , great morality lessons an entertainment.
I:36;273;Douglas was great and the Sheens also
I:36;274;Great movie, fast shipping from Amazon.
I:36;275;You will absolutely NOT believe this but it's true, and it's happening.
I:36;276;Definitely my favourite film about the financial world.
I:36;277;I really liked this 1980s classic.
I:36;278;michael Douglas's voice and demeanor work wonders to create the classic greed.
I:36;279;douglas's speech in the shareholder meeting is excellent but misnamed: it should be Ambition is Good since excessive Greed leads to a deterioration of workers' living standards and an eventual collapse of the economy, like what happened in the 1920s and what is happening today on a smaller scale.
I:36;280;But he points out very directly that the desire to achieve and receive a badge of honor is the driving force behind human creativity.
I:36;281;This is a great movie that has it all money, lies, sex, and a story.
I:36;282;however, both did a fantastic job in portraying their characters.
I:36;283;Looking forward to seeing the sequel and hope Michael Douglas has many more years to enjoy his family and friends in addition to giving great performances playing a wide variety of characters.
I:36;284;Suspenders are worth fighting for.
I:36;285;He delivers one of the many exhilirating monologues in this Epic tale of greed, pride and innocense lost.
I:36;286;Now your boss will really start thinking he's Gekko the Great!
I:36;287;The character is right up there with Don Vito Corleone, Tony Montana, Popeye Doyle and some other members of that elite group of high.
I:36;288;Gekko is truly the mother of all high.
I:36;289;Charlie never really creates the electricity that Douglas shocks the audience with.
I:36;290;This theme introduces some good tension in the storytelling.
I:36;291;All they remember is the classic Greed is Good speech and ironically most of them agree with Gekko on the issue.
I:36;292;line concerning a fictive company 'Bluestar Airlines' that Gekko has his own plans with to make himself rich and get scores of hard working people fired that adds enough suspense to the tale.
I:36;293;scenes are some of the most exhilirating scenes in the history of cinematography.
I:36;294;That alone is a great achievement for any director in Hollywood.
I:36;295;See this movie again and again.
I:36;296;It's full of catchy one.
I:36;297;liners that will make you not only the toast of any party but might provide you with more of an energy boost than any Tony Robbins video ever will.
I:36;298;He delivers one of the many exhilarating monologues in this Epic tale of greed, pride and innocence lost.
I:36;299;Now your boss will really start thinking he's Gekko the Great!
I:36;300;blowing performance he really can be dubbed 'Gekko the Great'.
I:36;301;Apart from that it looks great with crisp Miami Vice type of clean.
I:36;302;The whole set up is utterly believable.
I:36;303;Aggression, impatience with political correctness and urgency to get deals/trades done is what this movie and real Capital Markets are all about.
I:36;304;Charlie never really creates the electricity that Douglas shocks the audience with.
I:36;305;This theme introduces some good tension in the storytelling.
I:36;306;All they remember is the classic Greed is Good speech and ironically most of them agree with Gekko on the issue.
I:36;307;There's a good plot line concerning a fictive company 'Bluestar Airlines' that Gekko has perfectly legal plans with to make himself rich and get scores of hard working people fired that adds enough suspense to the tale.
I:36;308;scenes are some of the most exhilarating scenes in the history of cinematography.
I:36;309;Spielberg immersed audiences with his scenes of Normandy's beaches in '44.
I:36;310;That alone is a great achievement for any director in Hollywood.
I:36;311;See this movie again and again.
I:36;312;It's full of catchy one.
I:36;313;liners that will make you not only the toast of any party but might provide you with more of an energy boost than any Tony Robbins video ever will.
I:36;314;Making money in the movie market is good and honest while making money at the financial market is a crime?
I:36;315;If you are a socialist you'll love this movie.
I:36;316;Other People's Money is a much better, and truthful insight.
I:36;317;A brilliant director and talented actors contributed, but the mostimportant was, and is, the script, still fresh and very much to the point.
I:36;318;But, believe it, it still rules Wall Street and the corporate world.
I:36;319;The latest news about the selling of America proves it.
I:36;320;First of all, this is one of my favorite movies, the role Michael Douglas was born to play.
I:36;321;a piece of inside information about his father's airline.
I:36;322;Gordon finds Bud a bit green but takes a liking to a reminder of his younger self.
I:36;323;really though the movie is a feel good film for Stones liberal audience .
I:36;324;That way Stone's liberal audience can feel good about themselves.
I:36;325;Imagine having to think that many wealthy people exhibit strong personal disciplines like hard work, courage, and initiative and that these people have created wealth for themselves and others through legitimate means.
I:36;326;He works hard and makes money capitalist style by selling a movie that attacks capitalism.
I:36;327;In any case the movie was entertaining.
I:36;328;Greed is good says Douglas' Gekko, and proves it to his innocent understudy, Charlie Sheen as a stockbroker.
I:36;329;It's also great to see Charlie and Martin together as.
I:36;330;mistress and Sheen's new love.
I:36;331;An interesting look as well into the financial wheelings and dealings of corporate America.
I:36;332;Gordon Gecko (Michael Douglas) commands the attention and respect of not only the characters in the movie, but the audience as well.
I:36;333;The viewer gets captivated into the seduction of a high rolling lifestyle and can understand Buddy's (Charlie Sheen) desire to become one of the sharks.
I:36;334;A true tale of a hungry starter in the biggest business in the world becoming what he's always dreamed of becoming, although under false foundation.
I:36;335;A MUST SEE for ANY business person!
I:36;336;The father (Martin Sheen) is that rarity in modern America, an honest man who would rather work productively than get rich quick.
I:36;337;it's the superb acting of Douglas and Sheen, and the taut directing of Oliver Stone, that make this film hugely successful as drama.
I:36;338;And believe me, it is entertaining.
I:36;339;"It happens that I knew Michael Milken personally for a while
I:36;340;Gordon Gekko has remained an iconic figure, such a plausible portrayal of the archetypal Wall Streeter that many people think the film was based on true.
I:36;341;Two movies evryone has seen.
I:36;342;This is my favorite movie of the 80's (sci.
I:36;343;It really puts me back in time, and totally captures the essence of the decade.
I:36;344;Am I excited to see a sequel?
I:36;345;Yes, because I love this story, and I hope a sequel will properly expand the story.
I:36;346;The original WS is a near perfect movie depicting the decadence and greed of the people running wall street in the 80's, and is perhaps a lesson to us living in 2010 as to what can happen when greed has no limits.
I:36;347;Between a flawless performance by Douglas and the advisory/cameo role of Jeff Beck, this movie backfired on Stone.
I:36;348;the movie was good and insightful.
I:36;349;Michael is great in this and it's definitelyone of his best films.
I:36;350;Charlie is also great and this anniversaryedition has nice picture and sound plus neat extras.
I:36;351;Definitely, most definitely give this one a look if you haven't already.
I:36;352;It holds up perfectly over time and I never get tired of watching it.
I:36;353;"Of course ""Wall Street"" has its own flaws, but it's the best of the genre and the success of this movie relies much on the shark."
I:36;354;michael Douglas's performance (if only Daryl Hannah knew how to act!)
I:36;355;": ""Greed, for lack of a better word, is good, is right, it works."
I:36;356;There's dad Fox on one side and Gekko on the other.
I:36;357;Cast, Douglas/father and son Sheen, director, Stone at his peak, but, what about the Blu.
I:36;358;This is an entertaining movie, and the acting is great.
I:36;359;And to make my point, I will put this into a historical context, illustrated by real.
I:36;360;"investors seemed somehow to be ""wise"" enough to get out of the stock market just before the Crash."
I:36;361;"The SEC ""investigated"", and later ""classified"" everything !"
I:36;362;This puts Wall Street and the Law into *real* perspective.
I:36;363;when partying, the power elite of Wall Street likes to make fun with the ignorance of Main Street.
I:36;364;the film is about the business they do together while in the beginning they seem to be friends and in the end strong enemies.
I:36;365;douglas, of coure,is in his best again.
I:36;366;Half of the prettiness of the movie comes from Douglas's dialogues.
I:36;367;You just listen to them and pick up the ideas and proverbs what are the basis for the success in this field.
I:36;368;Sheen is, I think in this movie, playing a little bit simple minded brocker and sometimes it seems even that the character of Sheen is the type of I sell you the best or I am the winner .
I:36;369;Wall Street is a classic from a time when America's film culture was changing forever.
I:36;370;"i first watched this movie after a book called ""Now Showing"" claimed it to be one of the best 25 movies."
I:36;371;I must say, all in all, it was a good movie.
I:36;372;I actually really liked Charlie Sheen and Martin Sheen's work in it and I believed their relationship.
I:36;373;The pull of an actual father and son relationship really added to the authenticity of the roles.
I:36;374;I finally got to see Michael Douglas just the way I like him .
I:36;375;When Douglas gets going into a lengthy monologue, he oozes confidence which is amazing considering the pressure he was under.
I:36;376;This was one of those roles that really made Charlie Sheen stand out and become a celebrity in his own right and brought the extra challenges of that responsibility with it.
I:36;377;Again I really loved seeing someone get the best of Michael Douglas, even if they couldn't get away scot.
I:36;378;free and had to face the music.
I:36;379;Always there to heckle and mock his good friend and has some of the best one.
I:36;380;this is especially a great movie for men and/or people who love business and stocks.
I:36;381;time favorites and many men can quote it readily.
I:36;382;First, there is a new commentary by director, Oliver Stone.
I:36;383;He is a precise fellow!
I:36;384;Douglas had a heck of a time with the lines.
I:36;385;When he finally put in the time and memorized his part better, he was able to put in the performance that was needed.
I:36;386;The commentary reveals more behind.
I:36;387;So many times after a line is said, he commented on how so.
I:36;388;Greed is Good focuses on what this movie meant to that audience in 1987 and how real brokers took it to heart and how some began to idolize Gekko as well and even asked Charlie Sheen to open accounts for them so they'd be able to say they had an account with Bud Fox.
I:36;389;It is also brought up how tempting it is to try and take shortcuts in the business and what their field of work really means to brokers and their families.
I:36;390;But I'd say the commentary and featurettes are great for fans of this movie.
I:36;391;"It has VERY similar themes, cutting corners, a father/son dynamic, and the actors even quote entire scenes from ""Wallstreet."
I:36;392;Even with Charlie Sheen and Michael Douglas in this movie it was still good to watch.
I:36;393;This movie has a lot of good scenes of New York in it.
I:36;394;I actually liked Charlie Sheen in his role.
I:36;395;Michael Douglas won an ascorbate for hid performance, the role was so well typecast my neighbors cat could have won an oscar.
I:36;396;Oliver Stone has made his second best movie after JFK, in my opinion with this powerful portrait of greeed and power in the middle of the financial capital of the world.
I:36;397;The good customes and the honesty finally win the game but how long can you smile with this bizarre triumph?
I:36;398;michael Douglas made the best achievement of his career to date.
I:36;399;A kinetic script and glorious camera work.
I:36;400;Stone has made a sequel to his modern classic film.
I:36;401;it is as fresh as ever.
I:36;402;Gordon Gekko is a treasure trove of wise statements on the nature of capitalism.
I:36;403;His speech to the shareholder assembly where he attacks the thieving management is brilliant and I never heard a better version of combining satire and serious analysis.
I:36;404;we all know the famous quote `Greed is good', but there is much more in it.
I:36;405;win' situations, and it is pure robbery and warfare.
I:36;406;But more often than doing good, these two bunches of criminals will gang up and siphon the juice out of honest shareholders and the work force.
I:36;407;To watch this movie in Moscow in 1988 as a student was a liberating and exhilarating experience.
I:36;408;Of course, a huge part of it was a superb acting by Michael Douglas.
I:36;409;WALL STREET is Stone's best film.
I:36;410;Obviously, this is a relevant lesson in any era.
I:36;411;the most interesting true story ever related to stocks is the life story of Jesse Livermore.
I:36;412;"Wall Street is a very good and at times great movie full of great actors good one liners and has one of best one liner's in movie history the ""Greed is Good"" line."
I:36;413;Basics about the movie is guy wants to try to get into the high life and learn from the master of the high life played by Douglas and the other guy by Sheen.
I:36;414;Still one of my favorite drama's in my collection of movies.
I:36;415;So if you like Michael Douglas, Charlie Sheen, Martin Sheen, and that guy from the show Scrubs who does all the rants then pick this movie up and enjoy a good drama showing you how money can gulp you down whole.
I:36;416;The film avoids as much as possible the sentimental side of things and concentrates on the financial depth of the business.
I:36;417;There is a slight touch of romanticism with the cover.
I:36;418;recorder and you will get a rap on the fingers from the judge while I will get to prison.
I:36;419;When you know that that I was the one who wanted to kill a certain company that that you decided to save by having it bought by the sworn enemy of that I, you understand what inside business and inside dealing and inside embezzling and inside anything you want means.
I:36;420;"Not too many ""special features"" or ""extras"" that clutter up things."
I:36;421;This is an important movie.
I:36;422;and becoming even more clever as time goes by.
I:36;423;This movie shows you in a very believable way how big money, power and out.
I:36;424;Great movie, good drama, believable plot.
I:36;425;This is my favorite Movie and it is how it works on Wall Street If your not inside your outside LOL!
I:36;426;Always wanted to own this.
I:36;427;Wall Street bashes you over the head with its message.
I:36;428;Bud soon meets powerful, charismatic corporate raider Gordon Gekko, incapable of love, remorse, or empathy.
I:36;429;"The speech most cited by critics and fans is the immortal ""Greed is Good"" monologue."
I:36;430;the fate of Gekko is hinted at rather than displayed.
I:36;431;be big shots, who are attracted to the glamour of his lifestyle and his up your's, I got mine!
I:36;432;overall, Wall Street is a tight, well done character drama populated with iconic characters delivering iconic dialogue that acts as an indictment of a decade.
I:36;433;The movie and its message will stay with you long after viewing it.
I:36;434;Excellent service from the vendor as it came within days in perfect condition.
I:36;435;background provided on film was also excellent.
I:36;436;This is one of my favorite movies.
I:36;437;I love the stock market and I love Charlie.
I:36;438;This was a good story with a great cast!
I:36;439;I want to first say that this is one of my favorite movies.
I:36;440;This movie is about greed,deception,power,money,it shows that man will pretty much do anything to get to the top.
I:36;441;Michael Douglas won a most rewarding oscar for the excellent performance he put on.
I:36;442;It tells a tale that rings true more than twenty years after the film was first released.
I:36;443;"The script is intelligent and memorably quotable (""The illusion has become real and the more real it becomes the more desperately they want it."")"
I:36;444;I found Hannah's performance to be mild, too mild for the character's disposition.
I:36;445;I am concerned that the release of WS2 will detract from what can arguably be considered Oliver Stone's finest film.
I:36;446;Perfect direction, editing, and acting.
I:36;447;Excellent storyline and compelling narrative.
I:36;448;"His worldview was perfectly encapsulated in his shareholders speech in which he gave out the famous line ""Greed is good,"" and then explained why.You'd think the movie would be a bit dated by the technology and market environment displayed in this movie, but actually the change in times is interesting to observe, and the movie never grows dated because the story is relevant for all times."
I:36;449;this movie is well worth purchasing.
I:36;450;and it's come up Red.
I:36;451;Everybody thought fhe Gekko character was great.
I:36;452;gekko, superbly played by Michael Douglas, was such a well defined villain that he steals, not just the money, but the show.
I:36;453;This was a pretty nice movie.
I:36;454;I saw it over a friends house and we both liked it since we both play the ponies( stock market).
I:36;455;I must say first i think tom cruise probably would have been a better choice for lead actor, and i would have been disappointed if i had went to see it at the movies, but it is a nice book to watch at home for fun, and worth money amazon.
I:36;456;"Oliver Stone's poisonous ode to the ""the go, go `80s"" hinges on Michael Douglas's bravura, Oscar."
I:36;457;"winning portrayal of Gekko, seemingly a composite of Michael Milken and Ivan Boesky, whose mantra ""greed is good"" justifies any means to execute the big deal, including insider trading."
I:36;458;Director Stone (whose father was a broker) expertly evokes the dizzying altitude of the mega.
I:36;459;wealthy, and young Sheen is perfectly cast as a misguided but willing pawn in a high.
I:36;460;And truly, Douglas was never better.
I:36;461;In my mind there is considerable merit in much of the wisdom that GG espouses.
I:36;462;One of my favorite lines from the film has to be when Buddy (Charlie Sheen) asks GG 'What about hard work?'
I:36;463;But he like so many others like him is at the mercy of the true powers that be.
I:36;464;He displays so much honesty in every scene whether it's snorting coke with a hooker, schmoozing secretaries to gain entrance, or utter deflation as he is being arrested.
I:36;465;Michael Douglas gives one of my favorite performances ever.
I:36;466;it's a real thrill to see the hope and naive exuberance of youth be contrasted with stark reality of truth.
I:36;467;one of my top 10 favorite films of all time.
I:36;468;Which one of the actor's portrays Oliver Stone's dad?
I:36;469;A true Hollywood classic, with excellent acting.
I:36;470;A totally believable story line with performances by several very well.
I:36;471;known actors that are outstanding.
I:36;472;If memory serves me right, Michael Douglas received the Oscar for best actor the year that Wall Street was produced.
I:36;473;Not a great movie, but a good one.
I:36;474;Excellent and believable performances by Michael Douglas and Charlie Sheen.
I:36;475;Well done movie that keeps your interest throughout.
I:36;476;Great choice to have the father and son team played by real father and son.
I:36;477;Michael Douglas always a great choice for a strong, rich and smart character.
I:36;478;Midly entertaining and ok if you are really at a loss for something to do.
I:36;479;Michael Douglas is nice and repulsive.
I:36;480;I think this movie is a classic.
I:36;481;Stunning and realistic performances by Michael Douglas and Charlie Sheen.
I:36;482;It's the kind of film that makes you want to see the young kid win.
I:36;483;It will keep you watching to see what happens next.
I:36;484;Gecko's speech to Budd about capitalism and American society is the true voice and point of this film.
I:36;485;It's even more relevant in the insider trading obsessed climate of the early 21st century, and I think its tale of backstabbing and betrayal will.
I:36;486;always have a place in modern society.
I:36;487;For anyone who enjoys Oliver Stone films or impressive drama with a solid cast, I'd recommend Wall Street.
I:36;488;This is an eye opening classic.
I:36;489;Michael Douglas and Charlie Sheen are excellent in this movie where life truly imitates art!
I:36;490;I will recommend this movie to any one in the corporate world to watch.
I:36;491;era stock boom is captured perfectly in this iconic film, starring Michael Douglas, Martin Sheen, and Charlie Sheen.
I:36;492;coming stockbroker who worms his way into the heart of darkness of Wall Street mogul Gordon Gekko (Douglas), who seduces the younger man into a lifestyle of stylish excess.
I:36;493;handed and obvious, WALL STREET's closing moral is satisfyingly vague and open to interpretation, giving this film an unintended depth that still draws audiences two decades later.
I:36;494;"douglas's Gekko is the avaricious embodiment of the Gimme Decade, believing that, from start to finish as the great tagline to this movie says, ""Greed is good."
I:36;495;"Director Oliver Stone named Gekko after the infamous ""f. u. lizard"" of Vietnam, and it's an appropriate choice."
I:36;496;Gekko, as the embodiment of a kind of ethical darkness, has much in common with APOCALYPSE.
I:36;497;smudging the seemingly simple lines drawn in the sand, Douglas's Oscar.
I:36;498;winning portrayal is so overwhelmingly powerful that it effectively capsizes the movie and inverts the lesson in ethics.
I:36;499;The mesmerizing, beautifully polished Gekko, reeking of amorality, becomes a study in the Will to Power.
I:36;500;His strength however, comes less from within himself than from his ability to tap into the egocentric desires of others around him.
I:36;501;True, he exhibits the predatory instincts of an alley cat throughout the picture, but he is also undeniably alluring.
I:36;502;Classic film with Charlie Sheen and Michael Douglas.
I:36;503;I'm not a big fan of Oliver Stone but he did turn out a great movie and was able to get Michael Douglas to give the performance of his career as Gordon Gekko.
I:36;504;This is one of my favorite films from the eighties, and were I simply reviewing the film itself it would unquestionably earn a solid five stars.
I:36;505;"some eighties films, such as""The Road Warrior"", look so incredible on Blu it seems as if they were made yesterday."
I:36;506;The picture is quite good (though it's extremely grainy, even with noise reduction), the special features are nice, and it can often be found for only ten to twelve dollars.
I:36;507;I was delighted to see that this film was available on my pay.
I:36;508;He takes young Charlie Sheen under his wing and we watch Charlie change his moral principles, grow rich, bed blond and beautiful Daryl Hannah and seem to become a younger version of his mentor.
I:36;509;But then, Michael Douglas goes too far when he tries to take over the airline that Charlie's father works for and Charlie has a change of heart.
I:36;510;oliver Stone directed this film and his extreme talent made it a winner.
I:36;511;I look forward to seeing its sequel now, hoping that it will be as good.
I:36;512;I enjoyed Michael Douglas in the first Wallstreet movie I'm looking forward to seeing Money Never Sleeps too.
I:36;513;Seeing this again and not since it first came out was kind of funny.
I:36;514;We have progressed so far beyond with technology for example with phones and computers.
I:36;515;Greed and avarice versus human decency and the greater good is what the movie is about.
I:36;516;He has a deep loving respectful relationship with him.
I:36;517;He is rich and powerful beyond the normal bounds of Bud's expectations.
I:36;518;Bud slowly but surely decides that this is much more fun than doing cold calls for his firm.
I:36;519;Bud ignores the advice and stays in the fast lane, using inside information from his father as well as getting a job in night cleaning to go through other people's files for insider information.
I:36;520;he moves up to an expensive apartment and a beautiful ambitious girlfriend to match (Darryl Hannah).
I:36;521;the movie has some bumps (Darryl Hannah's acting is awful as the girlfriend), but performances by Michael Douglas, Martin and Charlie Sheen make it riveting and a compelling watch.
I:36;522;The bittersweet twist is that we still see greed and hubris in top Wall Street and Banking firms.
I:36;523;This movie is one of the best portayals of Wallstreet out there.
I:36;524;The script is great, the cast is phenomenal and Oliver Stone does a really good job with this film.
I:36;525;Wall Street is a great film about a stockbroker working in New York.
I:36;526;I rate the film and this product 5 stars.
I:36;527;My only complaint is that the video and audio are good but not great.
I:36;528;Wall Street has an impressive amount of bonus material for a single disc Blu.
I:36;529;ray (Blade Runner, Pulp Fiction and Apollo 13 also come fully loaded).
I:36;530;Michael Douglas and Charlie Sheen are at their best.
I:36;531;This movie is an excellent portrayal of what made the Greedy 80's .
I:36;532;see movie for anyone who lived in the 80's or is interested in finance.
I:36;533;I definitely like this movie, and consider it a full.
I:36;534;The acting is superb, and the drama heart.
I:36;535;"very good movie
I:36;536;I also collect Michael Douglas movies.
I:36;537;It held up to time with a good (sad) story line, good acting, and had the added bonus of knowing how low the mighty will eventually fall.
I:36;538;"I hesitate to say this is a classic, but it certainly comes close, and I'll be interested to see if the ""sequel"" will be able to do as well."
I:36;539;An 80's classic with and excellent perfomance of Michael Douglas, with one of the most powerfull names ever.
I:36;540;ray I have ever seen.
I:36;541;"Wall Street is a cinematic masterpiece by Oliver Stone and Stanley Weiser
I:36;542;The plot moves along at a very good pace and the cinematography was excellent.
I:36;543;"finally, Bud does get at least some of Gordon's business and with it comes ""perks"" including drugs and women."
I:36;544;will it always be there or will there eventually be a conflict of interest.
I:36;545;Excellent!Wall Street is a powerful film that explores greed and the very high price that can be paid for living a life consumed by gluttony and materialism.
I:36;546;"This is definitely a morality film largely crafted by Oliver Stone
I:36;547;"It's not quite as stunning as Stone's movie ""Platoon"" but it succeeds very well without a doubt
I:36;548;Everything with the order came out smoothly.
I:36;549;Great movie and would recommend it to anyone.
I:36;550;Truly embodies the 80's and what it's about!
I:36;551;Even I bought the used version, it was in great condition and came to before the estimated date.
I:36;552;In this classic film about insider trading, Michael Douglas plays Wall Street high.
I:36;553;Ultimately, Fox has a change of heart and decides to bring Gecko down.
I:36;554;Better luck next time guys, need to burn this one.
I:36;555;I have the first one almost memorized and I very much liked this sequel.
I:36;556;Great acting, nice plot, good characters and a very satisfying ending.
I:36;557;Most of the movie focuses on Charlie Sheen's character, and even though Douglas is perfect in the role of Gordon Gekko, I wasn't overwhelmed by his performance.
I:36;558;Assuredly, Douglas embodied the corporate greed of Gekko, but it is ultimately a one note performance, without any shadings of real personality.
I:36;559;"There are nice supporting turns from James Karen as the duplicitous sales manager
I:36;560;"But I have always found myself disturbed by his movies in that they are not the most ""entertaining"" of films
I:36;561;Michael Douglas has given enough great performances that this Oscar to me rewards his body of work rather than this one role.
I:36;562;It's one of those noire films that just take you back.
I:36;563;This is one of the few films that truly captures the spirit of greed that was rampant on wall street in the 1980's an absolute must see.
I:36;564;Michel Douglas finest performance in my opinion.
I:36;565;Michael Douglas delivers a dynamite performance here as the ultra.
I:36;566;charlie Sheen does an excellent job as well playing the role of Bud Fox, a younger stock broker who finds himself drawn like a magnet to Gekko's world.
I:36;567;Bud Fox's dad Carl is played by Charlie's real.
I:36;568;life dad Martin Sheen, and the conflict of interests that occur between Gekko, his British rival Sir Larry Wildman (played by Terence Stamp), and the two Foxs, provide the movie with a healthy amount of edge.
I:36;569;Daryl Hannah's character is rather secondary, kind of like window dressing, but it works well in that respect and she does get the job done.
I:36;570;"interestingly, the ending of ""Wall Street"" has something of an ""evil will prevail"" vibe to it which is an unsettling, but chillingly effective way of wrapping up this supremely entertaining 1987 movie."
I:36;571;Bud Fox ( Charlie Sheen)is a young broker who is intelligent, ambitious, and hard working.
I:36;572;He has many ideas on how to make it big.
I:36;573;Gecko sees a younger version of himself with Bud, and takes him under his wing.
I:36;574;It is definately Oliver Stone's best film, and one of the best that I have ever seen overall.
I:36;575;Michael Douglas offers one of the most memorable lines of all time with Greed is good .
I:36;576;This perhaps, is the film's best feature because the story is so authentic.
I:36;577;Stone manages to fully capture all of the glory that Wall Street can bring, and the misery that it can cause.
I:36;578;of course, you need talented actors to make it convincing.
I:36;579;Michael Douglas gives the best role of his career as Gordon Gecko.
I:36;580;In fact, he won an Academy Award for Best Actor for the role.
I:36;581;He is the puppet, and Gecko is the puppeteer.
I:36;582;Martin Sheen delivers an extremely solid role as Bud's father Carl.
I:36;583;I loved the fact that Martin Sheen got the role, because only a real father could bring such a realistic portrayal of love.
I:36;584;wall Street is a classic story dealing with ambition, greed, and betrayal.
I:36;585;The story is extremely authentic, all of the acting is superb, and the suspense will keep you on the edge of your seat.
I:36;586;The making of documentary is great, and so is the commentary from Oliver Stone.
I:36;587;The snappy quips and memorable quotes are the features of a very well.
I:36;588;Michael Douglas as Gordon Gekko is one of the great all.
I:36;589;Oliver Stone's depiction of this time in American history is extremely well done.
I:36;590;scenes look at the actors and the legacy of this classic film.
I:36;591;I highly recommend this movie to anyone who values great acting and excellent character development.
I:36;592;If I am incorrect, please disregard the review.
I:36;593;If you have any business experience, you will laugh at this unrealistic look at big business.
I:36;594;Wall Street has the Oliver Stone pedigree.
I:36;595;This movie is great, so long as you keep in mind the decade that it portrayed .
I:36;596;A decade of dog eat dog, greed, and get rich quick schemes.
I:36;597;a film for it's time and it is Michael's movie for his Best Actor winner role.
I:36;598;In this original film they have a son and the KID LOOKED NOTHING LIKE THEM.
I:36;599;It was just as enjoyable as it was the first time around.

I:36;603;I have not checked out the extra features yet, but they look great.
I:36;604;is good, and they remember a pretty good movie.
I:36;605;The truth of the matter is that the real life stories of M A and corporate takeovers were exciting enough.
I:36;606;If you are interested an exciting and engaging account of Wall Street in the 80's, read Michael Lewis classic LIAR'S POKER.
I:36;607;"The Bottom Line:Wall Street wastes Daryl Hannah but makes up for it with a magnetic Michael Douglas in the lead
I:36;608;The ones that are bad I have returned and will continue to do so.
I:36;609;Enlightening movie, I learned a lot about our actual Wall Street!
I:36;610;michael Douglas as Gordon Gekko and Charlie Sheen as Bud Fox were excellent.
I:36;611;The very touching scene between Bud and his dad Carl (Martin Sheen) in the hospital was one of the more memorable in this great movie.
I:36;612;Now it's one of my favorite films and never gets old.
I:36;613;The dialogue is snappy and Michael Douglas is a treat to watch as the slimey Wall Street tycoon.
I:36;614;If you think the trader talk will be over your head it won't, Stone makes it pretty understandable and puts much leverage on the characters decisions to keep it juicy.
I:36;615;Another brilliant thing Oliver Stone did was putting the father and son at odds with their career choices, this keeps the film relatable.
I:36;616;Great script too which can be found online.
I:36;617;The movie is almost poetic about a world many of us will never be a part of.
I:36;618;Bud found his character in the end and fought to make things right.
I:36;619;He paid the due price, and yes, he proved it to himself that there is justice in the world.
I:36;620;"A crook got another crook
I:36;621;"In this light, ""Wall Street"" reminded me vividly of ""No Way Out"" for instance ."
I:36;622;powerful, vicious, influential and a sure winner.
I:36;623;By sheer force of will and unprecedented persistence, Bud sneaks into Gekko's office and tries to prove his value to him.
I:36;624;but rather well executed in this particular instance .
I:36;625;story of the young proteg who rises to the top at breakneck speed until, unexpectedly, something shatters his bond to the master.
I:36;626;Something that hits home and makes Bud question his beliefs.
I:36;627;What this is and how it plays out is the very heart of the movie, so I'll let that for you to find out if you didn't see it yet.
I:36;628;all the acting is quite superb, especially the relationship between Gekko and Fox.
I:36;629;is particularly compelling as a man who believes in hard work, not selling out and not letting others .
I:36;630;He reminds me of Donald Sutherland simply because he also seems to have that ability to outshine everyone whenever he's on screen a couple of minutes at a time.

I:36;634;It is a delight to watch every single time.
I:36;635;This movie deals with many important and all too real issues.
I:36;636;Is it worth betraying the people you love?
I:36;637;And when you do make it big, who can you trust?
I:36;638;These are just some of the elements Oliver Stone delved into in this movie.
I:36;639;Using Wall Street and the share market as his backdrop, he has created a masterpiece.
I:36;640;the first thing that immediately grabs you is the acting.
I:36;641;Superb performances from some of the most talented but often misused actors in Hollywood.
I:36;642;He is the epitome of corporate power.
I:36;643;The way he speaks, and acts.
I:36;644;He won a truly deserving Oscar for his portrayal of Gecko.
I:36;645;And the supporting cast, Martin Sheen (playing Bud Fox's dad with pure emotion, it seems like he's saying what he really means to his son) and Darryl Hannah (as Bud Fox's love interest) does not disappoint.
I:36;646;kudos to Oliver Stone for writing such a powerful script.
I:36;647;this is a brilliant screenplay with great dialogue.
I:36;648;And the camera angles were also something I found fascinating in this movie.
I:36;649;Beautiful!Honestly, everything about this movie seems to work perfectly, which is why the 5.

I:36;651;A deeply revealing and frank director's commentary from Stone following on from the excellent ones he has done for Platoon and Born on the Fourth of July.
I:36;652;WAL STREET is a very entertaining film about corruption in the world of high finance during the 1980's.
I:36;653;Although it is marred by the inclusion of too much gratuitous profanity, the film is noteworthy for several fine acting performances.
I:36;654;Charlie and Martin Sheen are both convincing as the neophyte stockbroker and the principled union boss respectively.
I:36;655;As usual Hal Holbrook rises above the crowd with his sympathetic portrayal of the dissillusioned older broker.
I:36;656;It is possible that Lemmon might have been a good choice for this part too.
I:36;657;In spite of the tough field, Michael Douglas still managed to win an Oscar for Best Actor in recognition of his work in WALL STREET.
I:36;658;Very good movie, excellent pace, and a hard story, easy to follow from beginning to end.
I:36;659;This is a classic movie about not taking the easy way out and working hard to make it in life.
I:36;660;A classic quote from the speech that Gecko made to the shareholders.
I:36;661;And I have to say, I love this movie.
I:36;662;sheen's performance is good, but I don't think great.
I:36;663;One of my favorite movies of all time.
I:36;664;A must see for everyone.
I:36;665;We watch this every couple of months and it is always a great movie.
I:36;666;And you're a part of it.
I:36;667;Wall Street, the film, has reached its 20th anniversary.
I:36;668;"The most amazing part of the film for me was to see John C McGinley, he of 'Scrubs' in his younger days, and James Spader, he of ""Boston Legal'."
I:36;669;Micheal Douglas, as the young, handsome and ruthless Gordon Gekko, won an Academy Award for his performance.
I:36;670;I liked several other Oliver Stone movies a lot and figured that with this great cast, that this would be an exciting film.
I:36;671;Martin Sheen was good as the quintessential good guy.
I:36;672;Well they both have good hair.

I:36;687;Great movie and good suspense plot that will keep you at the edge of your seat.
I:36;688;After 27 years it still holds up well.
I:36;689;Michael Douglas and Charlie Sheen are Great.
I:36;690;Most supporting roles are very good.
I:36;691;but the story behind the details and the motivations of the characters are as good a lesson as you're going to find.
I:36;692;This film was quite fun to watch and I enjoyed it.
I:36;693;Douglass and Sheen gave excellent performances, and Gordon Gekko had some classic lines(My personal favorite: A fool and his money are lucky enough to get together in the first place).
I:36;694;Bottom line: Very entertaining story, but it ain't no success manual.
I:36;695;This movie was great, it captured the greed involved in big business to the T!
I:36;696;if you haven't seen this movie, do yourself a favor and check it out.

I:36;706;"Gordon Gekko's ""Greed is Good!"""
I:36;707;speech at a stockholder's meeting is a classic.
I:36;708;but it is also true, and more or less explains the competitive nature of capitalism.
I:36;709;As such, it succeeds in conveying its message while at the same time being hugely entertaining.
I:36;710;Michael Douglas turns in a fantastic performance as Gordon Gekko, and Charlie Sheen is superb as Budd Fox.
I:36;711;The supporting cast is uniformly excellent.

I:36;738;The documentary contains interviews with several real.
I:36;739;there are also deleted scenes and a nice movie introduction by Oliver Stone, himself.
I:36;740;my Thoughts*To begin, the movie is excellent.
I:36;741;As I already have said, it is arguably the best movie I have ever seen.
I:36;742;it is definitely on the short list.
I:36;743;Yet, this is one of my favorite movies.
I:36;744;so that in itself speaks volumes of what an excellent, entertaining movie this is.

I:36;747;"While this movie should not be defined as a ""1980s movie"" it does excellently capture."
I:36;748;"Gekko responds with a discourse on how we live by our own greed for things in life: love (which is ironic, considering just a few scenes earlier he told Darien that he and she were too smart to believe in ""anything such as love""), wealth, happiness."

I:36;758;I enjoyed the movie for what I thought of it, not for what Stone was trying to say.
I:36;759;Yes, there are those of us out here who enjoy getting rich investing other people's money!
I:36;760;So stop pointing the finger and realize that it's what makes our country great!

I:36;767;Oliver Stone's commentary is insightful and there are little gems all throughput the film.
I:36;768;This is probably one of the most famous movies of all times.
I:36;769;The movie is absolutely amazing!
I:36;770;Almost 20 years after it was made it's still one of the best movies about business and capitalism.
I:36;771;Greed is Good is a great quote that comes from the film but Greed can get deadly and lead to jail for some.
I:36;772;Majority of the people who reviewed this movie enjoyed it a great deal.
I:36;773;Read the reviews, Americans value our greed and our win at all costs attitude.
I:36;774;It is a fun movie with excellent quotable lines.
I:36;775;GG and Bud are two of the best charecters to come out of a business world film.
I:36;776;Oliver Stone researched this movie pretty good to portray Wall Street behind the scenes as authentic as possible.
I:36;777;That's why the movie comes across fresh.
I:36;778;Michael Douglas gives an excellent performance and Charlie Sheen is doing good too.
I:36;779;While Gekko is supposed to be the bad guy, he comes across as very likeable and he shows us capitalism at its finest . . . it's a game as money is never lost but only transferred and whoever has the most in the end, wins.
I:36;780;Greed is good as Gekko proclaims in this motion picture.
I:36;781;You are looking at the real best picture of 1987 This is an all.
I:36;782;With a great plot and even better characters.
I:36;783;This has to be one of the most gripping and poignant movies that defined 1980's cinema and also characterized big business in Regan's America.
I:36;784;And the second part of this movie is great also.
I:36;785;This movie captures Americas' obsession with all things material in mid to late eighties.
I:36;786;Michael Douglas and Charlie Sheen give performances of their careers.
I:36;787;Perhaps Oliver Stone's best movie as well.
I:36;788;Screenplay is fast moving and keeps you at the edge of your seat throughout.
I:36;789;The movie is entertaining, honest and yet lets you draw your own conclusions.
I:36;790;The Wall Street types will probably idolize Gordon Gekko ( Greed is good! )
I:36;791;collar worker types will perhaps admire the father (an airline machinist) of Charlie Sheen's character.
I:36;792;This movie is a must see!
I:36;793;A good look into the Jungle of Big Business, the Corruption of Power, Personal Growth, and morality.
I:36;794;Even though this film is over 20 years old it is still relevant.
I:36;795;also, it is a great film, with real jeapody and tension.
I:36;796;Bud Fox may be young,but despite that, has managed to become a very talented and successful broker.
I:36;797;If you are on Wall Street and you find yourself with clients like Gordon Gekko,you are destined for success.
I:36;798;"Wall Street is a film that defines the word ""perfect""."
I:36;799;Wall Street is suspenseful and keeps one wondering what will happen next.
I:36;800;The impeccable character chemistry(brought to life by comprehensive acting)move the film along well and balance out the suspense and regular,everyday drama of the film.
I:36;801;"At the same time,""Wall Street"" pays homage to the 80's,showing what the whole ""scene"" in the 80's was about and documenting the technology of the 80's(as far as cell phones and computers are concerned)."
I:36;802;"Add all of that together with some of the most ravishing film cinematography that you will ever find,and you have the perfect and ideal film out of ""Wall Street""."
I:36;803;So,enjoy the bonus feautures,and don't worry about whether about originality or the act of recycling when going through them.
I:36;804;if you happen to enjoy nonfiction,suspense,drama,and a large and enjoyable amount of special feautures,you have come to the right place.
I:36;805;He also learns there are some rather unscrupulous and unethical ways to get ahead as well and his inner conflict is what brings this film to a head.
I:36;806;Essentially this film is all about the culture of greed on wall street during the eighties, but somehow there is something compelling about the wheeling and dealing and way the trades are manages.
I:36;807;All in all this is a well acted and directed film and although it feels a little dated now it still makes for two hours entertaining enough viewing.
I:36;808;Wall Street is a marvelous movie directed by Oliver Stone (JFK) and starring Michael Douglas (The War Of The Roses) in his only Oscar winning performance, Charlie Sheen (Scary Movie 3), Daryl Hannah (Kill Bill), and Martin Sheen (Catch Me If You Can).
I:36;809;bud Fox, played by Charlie Sheen, is an ambitious stockbroker who wants to make the big time as a highroller.
I:36;810;nearly 20 years after its release, Wall Street remains to be a powerful film.
I:36;811;What makes the movie so interesting is Douglas's convincing performance as a man who's got it all and has lost all sense of morality.
I:36;812;Wall Street is a remarkably good looking movie.
I:36;813;shot are irrefutably of a calibre that is well beyond that of the metteur.
I:36;814;"sc ne and puts Olive Stone firmly in the category of a movie auteur who provides the ""rising tide that lifts all boats"" (director's commentary)."
I:36;815;The acting by Michael Douglas , Charlie Sheen, Terence Stamp, Daryl Hannah, Sean Young and James Spader is consistently excellent.
I:36;816;And thus, on these levels, Wall Street is a winner on all counts.
I:36;817;A master eiron, given Oliver Stone's (self.
I:36;818;propagated, for the most part) popular image as a warrior against big and interventionist government.
I:36;819;Then again, the true auteur has a higher calling, than the US box office.
I:36;820;So many great lines are part of the Wall Street Vocabulary today.
I:36;821;Greed is good, That stock is a Dog with Fleas, etc.
I:36;822;I also like seeing the old technology back then.
I:36;823;Must viewing for anyone who wants to invest.

I:36;826;This is a story of greed and corruption and we see Bud take the latter option.
I:36;827;He's finally on a path that will result in him becoming a major player.
I:36;828;He begins spending money on a new apartment and artwork which reflects his success.
I:36;829;He also starts a relationship with a woman who would normally have been beyond his reach.
I:36;830;We see what money and success can do to a person.
I:36;831;will Bud achieve his dream and stay one step ahead of the law?
I:36;832;Will he prove his father and work colleagues wrong?Charlie Sheen is convincing as Bud, but the real highlight of the film is the Oscar.
I:36;833;winning performance from Michael Douglas.
I:36;834;He's a brilliant public speaker and easily wins the support of companies he's taking over, even if he means to destroy them.
I:36;835;There are a few other things which date the film and the funniest change has to be the differences in technology.
I:36;836;i always take note when a film holds my interest with subject matter that I usually find boring.
I:36;837;Wall Street is one such film and it's a gripping drama.
I:36;838;Fox/Sheen is an idealistic, ambitious young stockbroker, his father is his conscience, and Douglas as Gordon Gekko is pure tantalizing temptation.
I:36;839;Instead, he created a decade full of Gordon Gekkos.
I:36;840;Fox/Sheen is an idealistic, ambitious young stockbroker, his father is his conscience, and Douglas as Gordon Gekko is pure tantalizing temptation.
I:36;841;Instead, he created a decade full of Gordon Gekkos.
I:36;842;Very compelling viewing and a warning to where you put your stocks and investments.
I:36;843;One of the best movies I have ever seen.
I:36;844;MD is perfect in his role.
I:36;845;The opening titles to such a fantastic city as New York is matched in size and demeanor with Frank Sinatra along side singing.
I:36;846;fox's persistence finally pays off with Gekko taking him in and teaching him the in's and out's of the insidering trading game, The most valuable commoditity I know of is information quotes Gekko and it is exceptionally true in society at any time perioid.
I:36;847;this masterpiece of a film really pays homage well to the yuppie, bull market era of the 80's.
I:36;848;on the technical aspect of it, the picture is wonderfully clean and crisp in almost every scene.
I:36;849;The documentary about Wall St., and the commentary by Oliver Stone, are wonderfully inciteful and worth viewing at least once if not more.
I:36;850;on the whole the disc is a MUST own.
I:36;851;The story and the characters are what drive and enthrall you in this movie.
I:36;852;Douglas's performance alone as Gordon Gekko is worth the price of the disc to see again and again.
I:36;853;The moral and psychological dimension, especially in Sheen's character's Faustian aspirations in conflict with his conscience, is superbly wrought as well, and the performance of Michael Douglas (who won a Best Actor Oscar, 1987) as the megalomaniacal stock.
I:36;854;This movie is an eyeopener to what may really occur behind those hallowed walls of the financial giants in Wall Street, Charlie Sheen plays a masterful award winning part in this movie which will be enjoyed by most who view it
I:36;855;"Oliver Stone is one of my favorite ""Hollywood"" filmmakers, and I have enjoyed many of his movies over time."
I:36;856;"While I haven't seen a few of his works, he has given more than his share of fine cinema from his beginnings, and I count ""Platoon,"" ""Born on the Fourth of July,"" ""JFK,"" and ""Nixon"" as among his better efforts, and I applaud and repeatedly watch parts of all of these."
I:36;857;Wall Street is pretty much a standard length and mainstream studio production, and while, as in almost all Stone films, it has a message to preach, in this one, he goes for a much lighter, more obscure, and subtle but just as powerful approach.
I:36;858;day people, the message here, both moral and profound, seems as timely these days as when the movie was first released in the 80's.
I:36;859;"That ""morality"" message posits that pursuit of profits and materialistic riches above any/most other considerations, especially above individual human integrity and decency, is an eventually losing proposition for any truly decent, thinking person, with true integrity."
I:36;860;And this is a must see, and Stone's overall best movie.
I:36;861;charlie Sheen, (and to a lesser extent, his real life father and cinematic icon Martin Sheen, who amazingly enough plays the main character's real life father), as well as an outstanding performance by oscar.
I:36;862;winning Michael Douglas, and other acting gems, as well as a fast.
I:36;863;"After much effort, he finally and with dogged persistence, gets a short ""meeting"" with an all powerful, super."
I:36;864;rich, almost legendary established player in the form of Michael Douglas.
I:36;865;"selling his soul early on, ""Bud"" (Charlie Sheen) soon begins to throw aside all of his roots and basic decent, moral upbringings, as well as the fate of his father and many decent working folks, in order to happily fall under the spell of his sociopathic leader/teacher (Gordon Gekko ."
I:36;866;"Douglas), and enjoys enormous financial ""success"" within the philosophy of his indecent mentor."
I:36;867;"For awhile, the almost religious mantra of Gekko's ""greed is good"" more than succeeds, but for a short time only."
I:36;868;east side Manhattan apartment, with money and the company of a beautiful, intelligent, but shallow girl (the best that can be bought), and sees a promising future as a true Wall Street player and wealthy corporate parasite.
I:36;869;For those viewing this as simply a pretty decent flick, without any heavy moral undertones, it is still Stone's most satisfying and easily understood filmic experience.
I:36;870;In addition however, for those who read between the lines, and truly get the under.
I:36;871;"surface morality message here, it simply but powerfully renders upon the viewer a deep questioning of what ""success"" really is, and at what acceptable cost."
I:36;872;Wall Street was produced in the 80's, but its message and power, seem as true today as ever.
I:36;873;Unlike so many other murky or over the top Oliver Stone films though, it remains, and probably will for some time, the definitive cinematic morality play from one of America's greatest filmmakers.
I:36;874;if you only see one Oliver Stone film in your life, let it be his best, in my view, this one.
I:36;875;Dolby sound works great on previews not on movie.
I:36;876;i had never seen it before, so I bought it before I went to see Wall Street, Part II.
I:36;877;Great film, it was used in my MBA class to discuss gray areas in business decisions.
I:36;878;Gekko manipulates the market using inside information and his motto best describes his approach: greed is good.
I:36;879;Soon, Bud finds himself getting information from any source and using to gain an advantage.
I:36;880;"slick, wickedly intelligent and definitely a very entertaining movie, ""Wall Street"" continues to strike a chord when looking back at a very unique time of American economic history."
I:36;881;The script, powerful and loaded scene after scene.
I:36;882;Writing skills at their best, which has contributed to the movie's success more than all other aspects combined.
I:36;883;Michael Douglas has brought out the spirit of the story extremely well.
I:36;884;All other actors have done very well, too, and so has the director.
I:36;885;"The strong message of ethics presented makes this movie appropriate for teens as well as adults."""
I:36;886;Great movie but I didn't find anything special about the extras in the 20th Anniversary Edition.
I:36;887;I hope to hear from you soon!
I:36;888;this movie is so good, you will love the ending when.
I:36;889;well, this movie is great with wonderful acting by douglas and sheen (before drug over use).
I:36;890;true drama drawn from the headlines of insider trading that will make you feel the dirty side of wall street.
I:36;891;An interesting perspective on how things work on Wall Street.
I:36;892;life father, Martin Sheen plays his dad in the film, and it adds an important sense of realism to the film.
I:36;893;Terrance Stamp, a British actor, whose best known for being General Zod in Superman 2 with Christopher Reeve, sad since he's such a brilliant actor.
I:36;894;A great supporting cast surround the strongest of lead character's, though, Michael Douglas, who won an academy award for his portrayal, and rightfully so.
I:36;895;Of all his film's, this one truly exemplifies his brilliance as an actor.
I:36;896;I leave you with a classic line to one of his many brilliant speeches in the film, Greed is Good, Greed works.
I:36;897;douglas was excellent and deserved his Oscar, and Sheen (both dad and son) were terrific.
I:36;898;See this building over here .
I:36;899;At the time I thought it was all the money in the world .
I:36;900;now it's a day's pay .
I:36;901;surprised it didn't win the Oscar for best screenplay as well.
I:36;902;Michael Douglas is one of my favorite actors.
I:36;903;love him and his dad.
I:36;904;If you have not seen this movie, do yourself a favor and pick it up.
I:36;905;michael Douglas as Gekko turns in one of his most compelling performances to date, where he's spewing fire most of the time.
I:36;906;Definitely one for the liberal audiences.)
I:36;907;His job is in, like the late, great Walter Matthau said in one of his last comedies, 'moih.
I:36;908;Like most of it is.
I:36;909;the dialog, the acting, the topic.
I:36;910;An all too accurate depiction of the way Wall St. works.
I:36;911;The story of an ambitious young broker (Charlie Sheen) who wants it all right now.
I:36;912;Michael Douglas got the oscar but the whole cast is excellent.
