id;spiegazione
1;Barton depends on each of these men, and they all let him down in surprising fashion.
2;barton Fink is a beautifully crafted movie from the Coen brothers, who manage to recall David Lynch, as much as anyone else save themselves, in telling this extremely peculiar and hilariously bizare story.
3;by the way, this may be revisionist history at work, but I credit this movie for showing me the light away from Arnold, Jean.
4;If you like Fargo, Big Lebowski, or Blue Velvet, this is right up your alley.
5;This wonderful, dark, satiric, sardonic commentary on noble writers.
6;and the Hollywood system is so rich in crafty and satiric lines that you almost are forced to go back and watch the film over and over again just to get them all.
7;Barton Fink is a wonder to behold.
8;night audience at the stage production of Springtime for Hitler in Mel Brooks' hilarious film, The Producers.
9;As the person watching Barton Fink, you just can' quite believe the genius, the wit, the dark satirical vision at work right in front of your eyes.
10;and hilarious acceptance finally overcome you.
11;This film is so witty.
12;and deliciously wicked in a most satirical and sardonic way.
13;just get better and better with each viewing!
14;seeing is experiencing chutzpa raised to the level of finest art.
15;Fink is brought out after getting positive reviews on Broadway and is put to work writing a wrestling picture which proves beyond his abilities.
16;Clearly, this is not a movie for everyone, but if you're still reading, you'll probably enjoy it.
17;It is one of those movies which can spawn almost infinite conversation as to what it means, or it can be merely enjoyed as it is.
18;Oh, and by the way, it's really funny, with John Goodman uttering one of the most hilarious red herrings ever heard on film (it's near the end, and if you see the film, you'll recognize it).
19;ultimately, this most strange and quirky of Coen films turns out to be their best, in the opinion of this reviewer.
20;If you enjoy movies that make you think and that stay with you for an extended period of time, than this might be up your alley.
21;It won the Palme d'Or at Cannes, but, tragically, it never broke out here in the states.
22;This is essential viewing for fans of the Coens, as well as for adventurous viewers everywhere.
23;First, this is a great looking, well.
24;That's a strong thread that gives NOTHING away.
25;winner, with one of John Goodman's most involving performances, deserves a special edition with a proper film transfer and sound remix .
26;Write Fox for a special edition.
27;John Turturo is brilliant and John Goodman is as good as it gets in this wonderful satire of a disjointed place and time.
28;The Coen Brothers produce consistently great work and Barton Fink is one of the best.
29;The viewer is taken along with him on this wild ride that paints memorable characters with some great dilemmas and questions that arise when one can no longer tell the difference between life and art.
30;The final scene is one of cinema's best and most thought provoking.
31;Fink is asked to come to Hollywood and write a wrestling picture for famous working actor Wallace Beery.
32;And then he pained with writers block, a most savage case at that, and so he begins his long struggle to create a masterpiece.
33;As Fink tries aimlessly to write something with meaning and significance he gradually drifts into a madness that I can imagine plagues many writers working in Hollywood today.
34;the film is elevated by some intelligent and memorable performances, especially in the supporting category.
35;Judy Davis is stunning as Audrey Taylor, the lovely secretary who steals a little part of Fink's soul.
36;Michael Lerner (who garnered an Oscar nomination for his performance) is extremely memorable as Jack Lipnick, the studio head entrusting Fink with the script.
37;Tony Shalhoub (what an accent) and Jon Polito are also noteworthy
38;As Fink, Turturro brilliantly captures the desperation that is slowly unraveling within his soul.
39;We can see the outward symptoms of his madness, but it is always glossed over somewhat.
40;Goodman delivers what may be his finest performance ever, and one of my personal favorite supporting performances ever.
41;As Charlie Meadows, Goodman instantly draws in the audience.
42;He seems nice enough, normal enough, simple enough
43;It was in those minor details that Meadows became the most interesting character in `Barton Fink' and honestly the most real.
44;Charlie Meadows is probably the best way to understand the title character, but I really can't explain my reasons for saying this without giving away too much of the film.
45;Just watch closely and listen intently (you don't LISTEN) and you will understand the significance that Meadows has in the bigger picture.
46;there is no denying that the Coen brothers know how to make a film, and they know how to create something fresh and original while never conforming to create something overtly commercial.
47;Just take a look at even their biggest successes.
48;and their latest Oscar winning `No Country for Old Men' can join `Barton Fink' as thought provoking cinema that maintains a vision and delivers triumphantly.
49;Chilling twists and a unique cast make Barton Fink a great pick.
50;I was very happy to see this movie in the Amazon Prime free video library.
51;If you are a fan of coen brothers movies, this is a must see.
52;John goodman is really great in this, as always.
53;barton believes he writes from inner pain, and this pain transcends and transforms his work to echo the existential pain of the common man.
54;Barton believes he is one with and the voice of the people
55;believe is ironically going to introduce Barton to the real world in ways unforgettable to him and to we the viewers.
56;possibly one of the lesser accessible of the Coen films, I think Barton Fink is one of their finest.
57;There are clever observations of the time and place, with terrific,wry bits by the supporting players as the Hollywood mogul and the producers and Yes.
58;but the show belongs to John Turturro as Barton, and John Goodman, absolutely perfect as Charlie.
59;His Barton Fink believes his own BS, and when he finally realizes what a life of the mind really means, his total shock and disorientation is that of one whose last bit of self.
60;John Goodman's Charlie is simply stunning.
61;He hits every note right on the nose as he reveals the complexity underlying this seemingly simple and superficial man.
62;as in all Coen movies the devil is in the details, and their attention to detail here is, as is usual with them, superb.
63;With wonderful sound and camera work, the movie has its own destinctive look and atmosphere.
64;not for everyone, certainly, I find Barton Fink an exceptional film, worth viewing many times.
65;Five stars for Coen fans, and those that love films that are defiantly their own worlds.
66;Easily the smartest of the Cohen Bros. films (and the darkest), Barton Fink employs an amazing economy of substance to weave a multiplicity of complex stories and meanings into an entertaining piece of very appealing cinematography.
67;developed and supported by the meticulous detail in the film.
68;artistic milieu in the modern marketplace.
69;A much more enjoyable way to explore the complexity and astonishing intelligence of the writing behind Barton Fink, however, is to watch it repeatedly.
70;That the Cohen Bros. were not more richly rewarded for constructing such a remarkable text is sad indeed!One of the best films of the twentieth century.
71;What can I say, it's a Cohens' movie, so it's a masterpiece.
72;I think this one is a lot better than Miller's Crossing though, which is more realistic.
73;These are the kind if movies that bring excitement, value and joy in life.
74;barton fink is one of my favorite movies.
75;this movie won the palm d'or for pete's sake.
76;If you have seen one of the Coen Brothers' movies and liked it, you should try this one.
77;One of the greatest movies that Coen Brothers produced.
78;This movie would take you to a surreal world.
79;john Turturro and John Goodman play excellent.
80;John Goodman who shines in a brilliantly conceived and executed role.
81;It is one of the most dynamic and powerful performance in recent memory.
82;Like any Coen Brothers movie, this one recreates time and place perfectly for the viewer.
83;As always, they throw historical figures into the the mix like a terrific send.
84;with Turturro's Barton Fink, the plot embraces a remarkable character.
85;The characters of Lipnick and Geisler are also real treats.
86;A good start is to observe and listen to him.
87;He observes and listens to the most famous and powerful people to whom he has access.
88;It is a funny film, but certianly not the comedy of Big Lubowski or Fargo.
89;He stays at a fleabag hotel, and befrineds his neighbor Charlie Munt.
90;He bellows I'll show you the life of the mind when blowing the cops away with a double barrel.
91;This is a dig on the cop, but it may also be a way of bringing bigotry to Fink's attention.
92;Fink holds a box which most likely contains his dead lover's head, but he carries it without opening or finding out what is in there.
93;It is rare Fink is seen outside either.
94;apply, but thought is provoked by this brilliant film.
95;He has a weighty cross to bear.
96;In this case, a man with a shotgun, fitted with a silencer
97;And I certainly do not enjoy being manipulated .
98;The two Hollywood detectives are pretty funny, too.
99;Overall, this is an entertaining piece of artistry.
100;Barton Fink has a lot of promise, because it's about the art of creating, and the conflict that arises when an artist's idealistic belief in his art meets the cold, hard reality of commerce and public taste.
101;john Goodman is the only actor worth singling out of the cast of Coen regulars.
102;He delivers a bellicose performance that runs the gamut from nice.
103;Coen Brothers comedy at its darkest and weirdest.
104;Amazing to watch their twisted minds at work.
105;You can, however, see the beginnings of their genius in this film.
106;coming New York playwright whose recent successes attract the attention of a major Hollywood mogul.
107;This probably seemed a lot more clever in the script, but when you see the scenes you don't know what to make of them.
108;i believe the whole idea of a studio smooshing a passionate writer certainly held promise.
109;But there is so much extraneous matter floating around this film that what could have been thoughtful and meaningful ends up being blunted in every way.
110;Anything and everything you ever wanted in a movie by the Coens.
111;Every line is genius and every character, even the smallest bit parts are expertly written and played.
112;Every award this movie has won is well deserved.
113;but this is a far superior film in all aspects.
114;Is comedy this smart funny?
115;The Wally Beery wrassling pic motif pins brotherly Goodman, always a finally UNcivilized giant with a disarmingly gentle surface.
116;satire is a literary form, foppish past the set of expectations we like to take to American movies.
117;Oakie's great role was Benzino Napaloni in Charlie Chaplin's The Great Dictator.
118;A brilliant movie: comedy, tragedy, horror, satire, allegory all wrapped up in a hatbox.
119;Barton Fink a quirky film with a bizarre storyline conjured up by the talented and creative Coen brothers, Joel and Ethan, is buttressed by a multitude of outstanding acting performances.
120;The film abounding with symbolism is one that probably should be viewed more than once.
121;barton Fink played with a proper measure of neurosis by John Turturro is a New York playwright who has tasted his initial success in a well regarded 1941 Broadway show.
122;He parlays these sterling reviews into a position as a screenwriter for a movie studio in Hollywood.
123;he makes his way to Los Angeles ensconsing himself in a decaying bastion of an art deco era hotel serviced by wacky bellboy Chet played by a perfectly cast Steve Buscemi.
124;he meets studio mogul Jack Lipnick played in stupendous fashion by character actor Michael Lerner who assisted by Jon Polito as his gofer Lou gives him an encouraging pep talk.
125;he soon meets his hotel neighbor the schizophrenic but sympathetic insurance agent Charlie Meadows played wonderfully by the corpulent John Goodman.
126;They become friends and Goodman helps soothe the nervous Fink and allay his anxiety.
127;the movie concludes in fantastic symbolic fashion with Fink caught between the Coen brothers conception of Hollywood hell and heaven.
128;Hey, the acting is good.
129;be in Hollywood, so I will praise a movie that laughs at Hollywood .
130;if you want to see a good film about screenwriting, watch Adaptation .
131;If you want to see a good Coen movie, watch Fargo .
132;You want to take a shower after watching it, but it's still an enjoyable experience.
133;John Goodman, with his commanding screen presence, threatens to steal the movie.
134;this is really the best of the cohen brothers movies.
135;this is a real thought provoking movie that should have won many oscars.
136;They have a style that is unmatched in modern film.
137;Everything about it makes you think, and to tell you the truth it is the best combination of Comedy and Horror that I have ever seen.
138;He meets a writer he admires.
139;Surely they'll help him overcome his issues.
140;If you like movies that tend to be darker and make you think and question everything in them, you'll love it.
141;It is a fine period piece movie, a little slow in spots, but original and ultimately engaging.
142;barton Fink, played with fidelity and deep concentration by John Turturro, is an idealistic New York playwright experiencing his first success.
143;Lerner, in a burlesque performance that is strikingly and hilariously over the top (you've got to love the shot of him in open robe and bathing trunks by the pool, his ample, hairy belly vividly displayed, perhaps as a symbol of a devouring cauldron), plays the movie mogul who instructs Fink to write the script for a B wrestling picture starring Wallace Beery.
144;The satirical idea here is to measure the great gulf between literary art and writing film scripts for a mass audience, an audience further dumbed down by the expectations of studio execs.
145;He huffs and puffs his way into friendship with Fink, showing him a wrestling move or two.
146;Fink gets an undisguised yen for her and manages to get her to help him with his script.
147;And then comes a characteristic Coen and Coen twist, and all heck breaks loose.
148;memorable in a small role as the desk clerk and bellhop is Steve Buscemi who is first revealed to us coming enigmatically out of the hotel's cellar where God only knows what he was doing.
149;they loved this at Cannes because just about every aspect of the Hollywood industry is made fun of, except the actors, who interestingly enough, make nary an appearance.
150;The genius of The Brothers Coen lies in their ability to examine American Culture and tweak it until it screams in transcendent agony.
151;This fine film is no exception.
152;craft, blast them with the contrast of bright Hollywood sunlight and the stillness of deep shadow, and you begin to get the idea.
153;Since I first saw it about 20 years ago, Barton Fink has been one of my favorite Coen movies.
154;I'll leave it to the many previous older reviews to explain why the movie itself is great.
155;I checked a few days ago, there it was, and I bought it instantly without a second thought.
156;ray, they would clean it up and make it 100% immaculate.
157;All in all I feel like I wasted my money and I really, really hope they do proper blu.
158;barton Fink is rich in cinematic language communicating much more than just the words you hear the actors and actresses say.
159;There are more than a few completely unexpected plot twists and plenty of action at just the right times.
160;What does the picture of the girl sitting on the beach mean to you?I enjoyed this offbeat, quirky and yet fun film as I got to hang out with a fellow writer, Barton Fink.
161;i think you'll enjoy it too.
162;This classic Coen brothers title fully embraces the concept of dark comedy.
163;It has quickly become one of my favorite films.
164;Barton Fink is a surreal tale stylized into a 1940's piece.
165;Cinematography junkies will admire Roger Deakins work in this movie which is the Coen Brothers first picture with this wonderful cinematographer who brought us Shawshank Redemption.
166;this movie is surely entertaining.
167;John Turturro and John Goodman are great actors.
168;For Turturro fans, Turturro swing dances!
169;For Coen fans, Goodman screams, again.
170;I was slightly upset and surprised by who John Goodman's character really became.
171;They're still figuring themselves out, but it really works in this film.
172;Now I know that with beautiful production design, perfectly modulated audio effects and music, and imagination they can completely immerse the viewer in a surreal version of the real world.
173;At least when done properly as the Coen brothers did here.
174;It seems more like an overlooked gem, kind of a demented cousin of Miller's Crossing.
175;Cmon just watch the goddamn movie it's worth the time.
176;One of the finest Coen Brothers' films, Barton Fink (1990) is a skillful inspired mixture of the real and unreal, the nightmarish Lynch .
177;Barton Fink, a talented and serious New York playwright is hired by a big movie studio to write a screenplay about wrestling.
178;Soon he finds himself in a writer block, and his hotel neighbor, chatty insurance salesman Charlie (John Goodman, one of Coens' favorite actors) tries to help him out by teaching Fink about wrestling.
179;Barton Fink broke the Cannes Festival's record taking three major awards, Golden Palm, the director's prize and the best actor award for John Turturro (the regular actor in Coens' films).
180;This 1991 film by the Coen brothers is a very dark comedy about the pitfalls of Hollywood.
181;barton Fink (John Turturro) is a writer on Broadway that has claimed some success and is wanted by the Hollywood studios.
182;On the way he meets Charlie (John Goodman) an insurance salesman with a darkside and Audrey a girlfriend to a writer that Barton idolizes.
183;Barton hits a writer's block and things don't go so good.
184;for those that love the Coen brothers films, like myself, this is another good movie, but not for everyone.
185;I like this movie because my Dad and I are big huge fans of the Coen Brothers,example: Fargo In Cold Blood No Country For Old Men
186;From that simple of a plot it's amazing where the coens take the movie from that point.
187;It looks beautiful as do all of his future works with the coens.
188;Carter burwell once again creates a beautiful score for the film .
189;That's the most important thing.
190;This winner film in Cannes Festival 1991, belongs to the ten best American cinematographic jewels of that decade.
191;this penetrating script deals with the rise of New York playwright who achieved success, is hired as screenwriter by producers in Hollywood during the early forties.
192;the Coen brothers explore with magisterial intensity the war times madness in which the evasion was the raw material and the main ingredient for the industry of the entertainment.
193;So this talented but not great writer will be pressured by the producers to make a script about the free wrestle.
194;the talent is there, guys, you can do it, you can make good movies after all!
195;Where he is right, he is right.
196;Turturro is a recently successful leftish Jewish New Yorker playwright who gets himself reluctantly signed up by a Hollywood tycoon for a stint as a movie script writer.
197;i mention the Jewishness of the title hero on purpose: one of the strongest scene in this movie, which is a mixture of black and screwball comedy, is when Barton gets interrogated by the police in a serial murder case.
198;For those of you who have not seen this movie, it is an astounding film.
199;This is among the best of the Coen Brother'swork.
200;It is a DARK comedy.
201;Big Lebowski is much more lighthearted in its delivery.
202;His newest play is a major success, still his agent advises him to take a job writing films in Hollywood.
203;Will Fink be capable of writing a wrestling picture that captures the Barton Fink style?
204;hahathe other movies of Coen Brothers rock!
205;This film is profoundly disquieting.
206;It is shocking and surprising.
207;But the film is a lot more important than that.
208;existence and the devil who proposes a final solution.
209;This burning piece of hell becomes a visionary image of the Shoah, of the final solution for the Jews, though, it is true, it does not only concern the Jews.
210;Visually adept and brilliantly written, the Coen Bros artfully, entertainingly deflate literary pretense and the commerce we call movies.
211;Best enjoyed by those with a basic knowledge of Hollywood's Golden era.
212;This dark, symbolic and very funny movie brings to life the glory and grotesquerie of Hollywood's Golden Era.
213;two of the delights of the movie are Tony Shalhoub as the dyspeptic producer Ben Geizler ( Writers come and go
214;barton Fink is a very funny, very dark film about the meaning of art.
215;Probably the most enigmatic of the Coen Bros. movies, Barton Fink makes you think.
216;In a professed exploration into the life of the mind, the Coens have created a very much internalized movie that will appeal to some and turn off many others.
217;More important to pick up on the symbols the Coens provide which foreshadow the events to come.
218;This is very fine filmmaking, if you have the patience to soak it all in.
219;With wonderful set direction and cinematography in addition to great acting you don't need to have an analytical understanding of all the components of this film
220;This is one of the best cinematographic satires of the creative process.
221;Barton Fink is a New York writer with on the cusp of real success when he receives a lucrative offer.
222;The idea of a talented artist selling his soul to the moneygrubbers involved in the film industry is an important theme of Joel and Ethan Coen's classic 1991 film Barton Fink.
223;Oh, nothing more than your typical guy goes to Hollywood to make good, finds himself living next to a mass murderer, gets writer's block, has run.
224;This movie is one of the most original films I have seen in years.
225;Hollywood can be a very unforgiving town.
226;everything works in Barton Fink.
227;Only when he writes about something he has enthusiasm for does he find a sort of redemption, and even then Hollywood is right there to quash his masterpiece.
228;The most intriguing extras on the disc are the deleted scenes.
229;Barton Fink is a winner of a film that really isn't all that confusing after repeated viewings.
230;Very dark but pretty good not one of my favorite of the Cohen Brothers movies.
231;As easy as it is to laugh at, Barton Fink is a film that's hard to laugh off, and Carter Burwell's score must not be overlooked when considering why.
232;Period pieces have always been the Brother's fixation and forte, and Barton Fink is one of their best.
233;the plot unfolds very slowly,which makes for an interesting story.
234;the whole time, the photography is great.
235;the subtle dark comedy is hilarious.
236;the ending is strange and fascinating.
237;i'm still working on the film's theme, if it has one.
238;it was one of the best things this movie had going for it.
239;the ending made me smile.
240;i know that there is so much meaning with the girl in the picture above the desk ending up on the same beach where fink goes, but i just liked it because it was so obvious that that was how it all was supposed to end.
241;Like each Coen offering, this film also has a certain feel to it
242;deceiving neighbor (John Goodman, in a superlative performance).
243;John Mahoney and Michael Lerner are splendid in their supporting roles.
244;I liked the film's macabre ending, a fitting exclamation point on the page that, although blank, says a lot!
245;John Goodmen's best acting job ever?
246;It will keep everyone on the edge of their, waiting for the next squence to hint something at us.
247;category person B: Will figure it all out and love it.
248;category person C: (the one I'm in) Will want to watch it again, this time with a prepared mind.
249;this is a solid film and one that will certainly make everyone think.
250;score by Carter Burwell is solid as well.
251;Barton Fink is the greatest film about Writing I have ever seen.
252;It is simply a beautiful movie, rich with effective symbolism and thematic nuances.
253;The actors are absolutely amazing, particularly John Goodman, the common man of that time in history.
254;The power and resonance of this story is in its enigmatic nature.
255;Funny, absurd, horrifying, and poignant, Barton Fink takes you on a madhouse journey into The Life of the Mind.
256;if not quite great, you can certainly see where fargo sprang from.
257;bringing and moralistic view, has a palpable middle.
258;It's much like a Dostoyevski or a Scholem Aleichem story, both grippingly funny, god.
259;BF has elements of self.
260;And this wonderful nugget of self.
261;Nu?Listen to me: This is a picture that will break your heart if you haven't sold out already!
262;Only the Coen brothers to produce such a master piece.
263;This it a movie that I'm proud to add to my collection.
264;I've heard that this film is based upon the notion that men often acquire greatness through the influence of muses.
265;Was it the beauty on the beach, a painting that hung on the wall in his hotel room?
266;the siren in the rocks?The ironic twist of the film is that Barton struggles with writing a masterpiece that captures the essence of the common man.
267;this film is black humor at its best and also smacks of a film noir plot in which Barton spirals into an inescapable web that eventually traps his precocious writing talent seemingly forever.
268;Be prepared to think deeper than the plot that is on the surface
269;There are also some fine camera angles and unusual visual shots, often a trademark of the Coen Brothers' quirky films.
270;Okay, Barton Fink is a satire on the old studio system.
271;It may also well be a symbolic depiction of the Holocaust.
272;The Book of Daniel certainly features strongly in the mix.
273;Barton is frankly devoted to the life of the mind, obsessed with creativity and the longing to learn the secret of life and bring it home to the Little Man, the Common Man.
274;this is a Coen brothers film, remember).
275;wing congressman of the period, for what that's worth).
276;maps, but as takeoff points, which is as it should be.
277;But the standout, as is so often the case, is Goodman.
278;That's a rarity in any art form, particularly film.
279;So take a look, and be shown the life of the mind.
280;Barton Fink is a great movie, top ten all time in my book.
281;If you love the Coen Brothers, you should like this
282;Great John Goodman and a small part for Coen fave Steve Buscemi as Chet the disturbing desk clerk.
283;To its credit, the production qualities are all first rate: production design, acting, music, and cinematography.
284;just the Coens snickering to themselves as they visually say, See how cute and clever we are.
285;Barton Fink is one of the most fascinating films I've seen in a long time.
286;The amazing thing about this movie is that having seen it, one immediately wants to talk to someone about what it really was about.
287;There are so many sets and scenes in the film that have a creepy, surreal and dream.
288;known movie is a great achievement, on a par with Fargo or even with O Brother Where Art Thou, in its own right.
289;Barton Fink is a smart, well.
290;based movie that will keep your attention for the entire 116 minutes.
291;If you liked John Goodman in The Big Lebowski, then you'll love him in this movie.
292;He's a bit calmer, but delivers an amazing performance.
293;Turturro gives one of his best performances to date as a semi.
294;Turturro's studio boss in LA is played by Michael Lerner, who gives an excellent performance as a very dramatic performance as the self.
295;And as usual, the Coens give us a few unexpected twists and yet another unpredictable ending.
296;As a film it's pretty out there.
297;Unbelievably bold and vivid characterizations, a truly unpredictable plot, black comedy on such a high level it's (literally) sickening, and a nice (or not nice) surprise ending.
298;it's a Coen brother's film.
299;It seems that Joel and Ethan(director and producer, though they both do both jobs), ran into a touch of writer's block in the middle of penning their sublime gangster flick Miller's Crossing .
300;For whatever reason it may have been, thank God they did pen it, for it is an absolute Coen gem.
301;The faithful Coen crew are certainly to be found, with John Goodman as the larger.
302;An absolute must for the Coen fan, and most likely an interesting find for the more.
303;The Coen brothers have made a lot of good movies including this one, which was not particuarly well.
304;This film and Miller's Crossing are, in my opinion, the apex of art by the filmmakers.
305;so enjoy this flick and Miller's Crossing as great works of art from the Coen brothers, films that can take you from this world to another and back where suspension of disbelief is easy and the rewards are great.
306;Welcome to the wonderfully wacky world of the Coen brothers.
307;Joel and Ethan Coen are two of the most brilliant filmmakers in America today.
308;Every film they turn out is a cinematic gem, and Barton Fink is no exception.
309;The elevator is run by a cadaverous, pock marked, elderly man.
310;His bed creaks and groans with a life of its own.
311;Still, she is willing to try and help him overcome his profound writer's block.
312;He goes from living a life of self.
313;john Turturro is terrific as the introverted, tightly wound, pretentious, and neurotic Fink, who in Hollywood, away from the womb of the Great White Way, is like a lamb led to the slaughter.
314;John Turturro makes the role his with a purposeful intensity.
315;john Goodman is sensational as the garrulous Charlie Meadow, the epitome of the working class man about whom Fink likes to write.
316;John Mahoney is excellent as the Faulknerian.
317;like writer, and Judy Davis outdoes herself, as the self.
318;dazzle the viewer with his over the top portrayal of a fast talking studio head who is willing to pay big bucks for the cache of having a top Broadway playwright turn out screenplay swill for the masses.
319;Jon Polito is very good as the Uriah Heepish, quintessential yes man he portrays.
320;Tony Shalhoub is excellent in his role, underscoring the absurdity of the old Hollywood studio system.
321;His entrance onto the screen in this fashion foreshadows what is to come.
322;I bought this because it is one of my favorite films.
323;An excellent and artistic portrayal of the writer's process.
324;John Turturro is amazing in this wonderful film about a screenwriter in 1940s Hollywood.
325;A scary and mysterious film about a man who sells his soul to Hollywood and gets little beyond nightmares in return.
326;I highly recommend this one and would keep myself from knowing too much before the film begins.
327;I dislike giving bad reviews, but this, definitely deserves just that.
328;Besides that the acting is categorically suberb, the script is one of the Coens' finest, and it's quite humorous.
329;to me, John Turturro is probably the second best dramatic actor in Hollywood right now .
330;He can move effortlessly from a Latino (the Big Lebowski, Mr. Deeds) to a Jewish man (Barton Fink, Miller's Crossing) and his dark, penetrating eyes are about as expressive as they come.
331;watching his relationship with John Goodman's character evolve from total discomfort to total dependence is amazing to behold.
332;Though I must say the ending is absolutely brilliant.
333;The more I talk about it, the more I want to watch it again !
334;time favorites and a highly underrated film), sci.
335;of course John Turturro is a fine actor but the storyline leaves me wanting more.
336;as rich and wonderful as the script to Barton Fink is, watching it has a truly unique and mysterious effect.
337;We are constantly presented with haunting imagery, ambiguous character developments and riddles galore.
338;This shot shows us in painstaking yet quiet detail Barton's sexual repression and the way he views all other mortals in comparison to himself.
339;This relationship is fascinating as with each subsequent visit, Charlie grows deeper into Barton's head.
340;This ending brilliantly summarizes what Barton has been dealt in life and that if we were presented with the contents of the box it would completely diminish all of the fascinating quirks and mysteries laid throughout the film.
341;One great and perhaps more obvious example is when Barton goes dancing and begins screaming at the sailors, This is how I serve the common man!
342;, as he points at his head, This is my uniform!
343;Barton Fink is a rare exercise in truly alternative film making methods.
344;In the film Barton Fink, this question is precisely the point.
345;So here is what I got from the movie.
346;at the end of it all, we are still inside the writer's mind.
347;This is a very well crafted piece of cinema.
348;Barton Fink is a dark and subtle comedy with some outrageous and shocking moments.
349;Still, I was very entertained all the way through.
350;His job is to write a wrestling picture, something that Fink knows very little about.
351;His lively and loud neighbor, Charlie, takes a liking to him and offers his friendship and advice.
352;It's strange because it's so subtle and it disguises itself as something so innocent and harmless until you see the plot come full.
353;The Coen Brothers always know how to keep us on our toes when it comes to movies, and they prove that fact clearly in Barton Fink.
354;the acting was fantastic, as usual.
355;John Turturro gives it his all in the lead role.
356;It is clear that he was the right person for the job.
357;John Goodman is also very great and hilarious, and you even get to see some of his dark side.
358;What it all comes down to is that everybody did their roles justice.
359;There are a lot of crazy and interesting characters that Fink encounters during the film that are really worth getting to know.
360;The film was very well.
361;This is the perfect movie for an audio commentary, especially to listen to when you get to the remaining moments of the film.
362;Well, at least there are some extras and the trailers are pretty funny.
363;I'd recommend staying away from the Barton Fink trailer and save that for afterwards.
364;i don't think Barton Fink is the Coen Brothers' greatest achievement, but it is definitely an enjoyable and entertaining film.
365;And the dark and very subtle humor is always a joy to experience.
366;Every now and the you see an old movie on TV.
367;etc. that stands up on its own through the sheer greatness of the actors.
368;incognito is worth the price of admission alone.
369;There's a moment early on, in which the movie lays its cards firmly on the table.
370;He then gently puts one finger on the bell, finally stopping the ring.
371;I always found this to be a poetic, beautiful, and slightly unsettling sequence.
372;It's the first click up the hill, in the rollercoaster of surrealism that this movie embodies.
373;We've got John Goodman, who is a great common man, all pudge and sweat and plain.
374;John Mahoney pulls of a great magic act, with his dual personality southern gentlemen writer/barfing drunk.
375;Michael Lerner is frenetic as the manic studio boss, chomping all the scenery and generally having a grand old time.
376;Also great are Richard Portnow and Christopher Murney as the cops who come to question Barton.
377;Judy Davis is also great here, but her character is actually more of a device than a role, for it is her relationship with Barton (and its shocking aftermath) that propels the film down an even weirder path.
378;Whatever it is, it is certainly beautiful and entertaining.
379;The film gets five stars.
380;So it evens out at a solid four star rating.
381;its a great ride and you need to take it.
382;John Turturro and John Goodman give fantastic performances.
383;The shoes, of course, represent the adage walking in a pair of someone's shoes to understand their condition.
384;That is, there is plenty of what the common man wants to see.
385;In this way, the movie is wonderfully ironic and a joy to watch.
386;for added amusement, pay attention to all the references to the head, both verbally and with objects, in the second half of the movie.
387;Barton Fink is truly a movie worth a Criterion Collector's Edition, if not a Director's Release.
388;I personally thought Barton Fink's production values and attention to detail were a couple of marks above this movie.
389;He rubs elbows with a few odd.
390;All the actors played their parts very well, it's just that the story isn't that interesting.
391;Also Tony Shalhoub played a character that is way far from what you see him normally playing on T. v. and did a great job.
392;Goodman is a wild man.
393;Always has been, always will be.
394;Bizarre enough to keep you watching.
395;Some slow moments, but overall really good.
396;Must see for fans of theirs
397;For me it is hard to imagine anyone not liking this film, 'Barton Fink' with its brilliantly written script and masterfull camera movement, and performances that the stars of this movie will never come close to achieving again.
398;So in my humble opinion I recommednd this film for anyone who appriciates truely great films.
399;Quirky but very entertaining:) The type of movie you can watch over and over.
400;This is one of their best.
401;the whole film is certainly very srange, but not so much as to encumber it's rather magnetic style.
402;It has the same quiet self.
403;The hotel in which Turturro's character ,Barton Fink, is staying is a big player in itself, with Citezen Kane style lighting, wallpaper that peels from the wall because of the intense Hollywood heat, and a wonderfully strange cameo from Steve Mr. Pink Buscemi.
404;The outstanding performance for me though lies with John Goodman.
405;There's just something fantastically wierd and intriguing about the way he delivers the line, and this and other little nuggets of script writing mastery peppered throughout the film, are able testament to the brothers' ability to get the best from their cast.
406;Winner of three prizes at Cannes, including the Palme D'or, this movie is a real crowed pleaser and it is easy to see why.
407;the film is sometimes hilarious and extremely wacky.
408;There are lots of memorable characters and set pieces.
409;this script about a screenwriter is amazingly witty and extremely well written.
410;The dialogue is gold alone .
411;John Goodman who plays Barton's room neighbor, Charlie Meadows, is also wonderful in probably what is his best role to date.
412;This could also well be the best movie that the Coen brothers have to offer from their superb collection.
413;There is also a wonderfully surreal and moving ending to this great film!Thoroughly pleasing and extremely unpredictable!
414;I could see the satire.
415;John Goodman and all the other actors are fantastic, I love the way that Coen Brothers Films use alot of the same actors it alot of their films.
416;Also with Coen Brother's Films you are pritty much gauranteed amazing cinematography.
417;But I still rate it 5 stars.
418;What an honor to be the first to review a masterpiece such as this collection of celluloid.
419;Barton Fink explores the relationship between, artist, subject, audience, and those people of power whom facilitate art while not always sympathising with it.
420;The offer is from Hollywood, and with a great sense of guilt, he accepts.
421;john Tutorro (I can't be spelling that right) deserves the highest praise for bringing out every nuance in such a complex character.
422;Look also for a ramarkable turn in John Goodman's resumee, he proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that he can handle any chore a screenwriter might bequeeth him.
423;man, and I for one would just like to say, well done John, well done indeed.
424;one of the best films of the 20th century!
425;The other friend, a British colleague from work, was sitting up stiffly in her seat staring at the screen, and I was in the middle of the two, laughing at times albeit nervously and feeling highly entertained.
426;The story of a young New York playwright who accepts a lucrative contract to produce a movie script and goes off to Hollywood in the 40's is quite fantastic.
427;I still remember the movie's heat.
428;It sure makes the classic one in Stephen King's The Shining look like the Ritz, and this is an hotel where if you are already in a stupor bad enough to check in at the welcome desk, you don't want to check it out further when you've unpacked, or really ask about its history and the breakfast menu.
429;spirit, becomes best buddies with the gifted and lost New Yorker(the physical and personality contrast alone between the two men is a sight to be seen and a terrific spoof).
430;We have a great cast of actors here.
431;Some may want to avoid it at all costs
432;The critics at the time had plenty to say on the above, both the admirers and detractors, and it won several awards.
433;Be as it may, it is a highly original masterpiece which I always remember with a wry smile.
434;this one with appreciation for J. Farmer, who 'introduced' me to the Coen Brothers and also felt this was one of her favorites.
435;I had the greatest time watching it.
436;I was going along with the buddy moments, always smiling when John Goodman came on screen, and loving the conversations between Barton and his new friend.
437;the wallpaper peeling off, the hotel picture, the ending at the beach, the fast talking president of Capitol Pictures, the long shots of the corridors in the Earl hotel.
438;It's just a great Coen film.
439;i bought the film happily.
440;The way the camera moves toward peeling wallpaper is very surreal and mesmerizing.
441;to which John's character answers Because you don't LISTEN!
442;hit wonder, Barton Fink, who has written a successful Broadway play and is summoned by the powers that be to Hollywood.
443;After much cajoling to take the job from his agent, Barton arrives in Los Angeles determined to become the writer for the common man where he insists true stories live.
444;excellent performances from John Turturo, John Goodman, Judy Davis, John Polito (often overlooked, but his scenes ALWAYS become his!!)
445;The plot has some unusual twists and turns but the thing I came away with was the characters that emerge from the film.
446;It gets crazy at times but it works.
447;A great movie for/about writers.
448;One of their darkest and funniest films.
449;John Mahoney is fantastic as a William Faulkner based character.
450;This is a great movie which has as its theme the subversion of purpose by the Hollywood grist.
451;The character of Audrey is most probably a melange of Howard Hawks's real.
452;back transitions in Edgar Ulmer's Detour), damned fine acting and smart dialog as well.
453;The plot is a bit dreamlike where the great American novelist is a drunkwhose secretary writes his scripts for himand the New York fellow keeps writing hissame literary play over and over in writer's block.
454;Now I appreciate it as an example of highly intelligent comedy/drama that fully explores the two faced nature of Hollywood, of the struggles of writing, and of realizing that many of our heroes rely on image and image alone.
455;John Turturro's performance as Barton Fink should have won him an Academy Award.
456;It is haunting and mesmerizing, terrifying and comical.
457;One of the top ten movie performances by an actor during the 1990's.
458;See this movie and you'll understand, provided you're not 14 years old.
459;john Goodman's character is hilarious and actually scary.
460;Another interesting point I picked up on my latest viewing, this movie begins with an ending(the curtain falls on Barton's play) and ends with a beginning(a young man meets a beautiful woman on a beach).
461;Barton Fink is one of my favorites movies ever and the best film from the Coen Brothers.
462;It's funny and darkly, elegant and vanguardist.
463;There are moments here that rival even David Lynch in cinema as out.
464;the film begins in a relatively realistic, even subdued manner.
465;the hotel where Fink and Charlie live should be considered the real star turn in a movie with nothing but great performances.
466;well, you'll just have to see for yourself.
467;Barton Fink makes many references to heads and their respective contents, and who has possession of them at various times.
468;bones, Barton Fink remains an essential item for a thoughtful movie fan.
469;Miller's Crossing made me think that the Coens may be the greatest active moviemakers America had to offer.
470;It's beautiful to look at, and fun to watch, with outstanding performances from the entire cast.
471;John Turturro and John Goodman are both amazing in this.
472;The dialogue is fantastic, although not as wonderfully lyrical as in Miller's Crossing.
473;While the extras are nice, I wanted more.
474;Still, the movie looks great, and it's wonderful to finally own it in widescreen.
475;Loved the movie and the feel of it.
476;It is very worth it and full of symbolism.
477;The Cohen brothers are truly remarkable.
478;I have loved all of their films(in particular Miller's Crossing)but Barton Fink just took first place.
479;Recently, I had a chance to view it again.
480;This flick is one of the best films Ive ever seen, and I dont say that lightly.
481;Turturro is particularly impressive as the title character, a playright turned screenwriter.
482;John Goodman is sooooo freaking great, though.
483;It's style is a blend of the two traditions the Coens normally alternate between in their movies: noir and screwball comedy.
484;Set in the 1940s, Barton Fink is a nerdy Jewish playwright in the social realist mode, whose abiding ambition is to create a theatre for the common man.
485;Enjoying success in his hometown, he is lured to Hollywood to script wrestling pictures for a wildly zany, enthusiastic producer .
486;who gets some of the best lines in the film: 'You from New York?
487;I'm from New York, well, Minsk if you go back far enough'.
488;'you want some stories Barton, I'll tell you some stories'.
489;the skilled recreation of old Hollywood, the waspish portrayal of prevailing attitutes, the horned dilemma faced by the writers: maximum money for minimal originality, and the wild studio execs .
490;This marvellous surreal movie from the Coen brothers centers around Barton Fink (John Turturro), a successful New York playwright who is lured to Hollywood with the prospect of big money and stardom.
491;lipnick as played by Michael Lerber is the classic studio boss taken to the extreme.
492;Both terrifying in his power and very funny.
493;A truly mesmerising performance by Lerner.
494;John Mahoney is also great as W. p. Mayhew a famous Hollywood writer that Barton looks to for help.
495;As it turns out he is a roaring drunk and his wife actually does most of the writing.
496;The scenes involving Mayhew are hilarious.
497;so this is a typical Coen brothers movie, very funny in places, very weird in places, and overall superb.
498;Barton Fink is one of the greatest movies of the 20th century!Everything about it is absolutely flawless!!!
499;I'm a big fan of the Cohen brothers as well as John Goodman and Jon Turturo, but I did not enjoy this film.
500;I viewed this for a comparative literature class.
501;I thought the characters were engaging and the artistry phenomenal.
502;one interesting note: when Barton visits Mayhew's bungalow, there's a sheet of paper on the door which says that Mayhew is working on the movie Slave Ship.
503;Guess which one always wins.
504;The plot is more than a bit occult, but the acting is extremely good and was also extremely underappreciated.
505;One can hardly praise Turturro's work enough and Fink and Quiz Show are two of his best efforts.
506;The Coen brother have this amazing ability to look beyond the mundane world at the sinister, surreal existence beyond.
507;Barton is a relative virgin to the literary world.
508;Best line in the whole film: I'll show you the life of the mind!
509;The Coen Brothers put out films at a fairly regular pace so it's easy to forgive them for missteps and move on.
510;the Coen Brothers can always be counted on to make visually interesting films and BARTON FINK is that.
511;Barton Fink (John Turturro) is a privileged successful New York playwright who pens plays on the struggles of the common man, something he believes is new.
512;When he gets the call from Hollywood, he reluctantly takes the job.
513;Like any good Coen film, just when things start to slow down, they leap forward in an unexpected way.
514;The Coens did a lot of those movie effects, including one at the end I didn't quite grasp, but it looked clever and perhaps was one of those things you assign you own symbolism.
515;Definitely worth a view and an addition to your Coen collection.
516;Very interesting way to take a dream and make it a movie.
517;One of those movies that you love it, or hate it.
518;Very normal reaction when we talk about art.
519;Watch it and have a nice dream
520;Arrived fast and was in perfect condition.
521;I've loved and loathed Coen Brothers movies.
522;Loved The Big Lebowski and O Brother Where Art Thou.
523;The mere thought of The Hudsucker Proxy makes me happy.
524;The everyman that can't stand the artistic pretentions of the artist, while admiring the art nonetheless.
525;but it's enough humbling for a laugh.
526;so watch it with Goodman in mind as the hero.
527;Then you'll enjoy the movie.
528;Although this movie maybe a little slow to some, it is a surreal and symbolic masterpiece.
529;The brilliant aqspect of this film is that it is very enigmatic.
530;In a day immersed in sit and absorb films, this is a precious rarity.
531;still, this is a great movie and probably has not been seen by as many people as should have seen it by now.
532;this is also a great commentary by the Coens about the nature of Hollywood, how a writer struggles in that town, anti.
533;john Goodman and John Turturro do excellent work here as the madman and the writer, respectively, showing us both their comedic and their tormented sides.
534;the ending, with the hallway in flames, is unforgettable
535;This film was required viewing in Engl.
536;It was well worth the down load.
537;That still seems a valid course, as there is a genuine sense that, beneath its comic, surreal surface, Barton Fink is trying to tell us something urgent and important.
538;Perhaps, but the primal forces in a writer's mind as s/he shapes a great story do that, anyway .
539;tell us something about all of us, something beautiful.
540;hand, the postmodern flourishes (wherein genres clash and surfaces spill over one another in unexpected ways), cracks appear.
541;1941, the nice guy next door .
542;Nice Guy Charlie Meadows (the excellent John Goodman) is a twisted murderer.
543;He flips to Genesis, and there, on the page, is the opening of his screenplay .
544;the only part of it he's been able to write.
545;It's a brilliant sequence, that truly adds up.
546;There is something about it that, like Lynch's best work, goes right past the rational self and nestles more deeply in the unconscious.
547;I get something from every viewing of this film, and part of its beauty is that I cannot articulate exactly what that is.
548;john Turturro is excellent as the title character.
549;Judy Davis acquits herself nicely as Mayhew's secretary/lover/ghost.
550;this is one of those films that's worth really thinking about, and watching again and again.
551;It was like watching a nightmare but is veru well acted and the storyline is fresh.
552;I enjoyed it more after I finished watching it than while I was watching it.
553;Worth seeing at least once.
554;summarize this hilarious, powerful, and in.your.
555;This is a superb early film by the Coen Brothers.
556;It's a British import, but plays perfectly on U. s., Region 2 machines.
557;Great writing
