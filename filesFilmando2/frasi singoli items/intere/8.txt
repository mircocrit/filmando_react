I:9191;1;With the special features in this Criterion Collection, one gains an insight into the over hour.
I:9191;2;An interpretation certainly is helpful to a film that has little dialogue and is rich on visuals.
I:9191;3;director Robert Altman speaks about the film and influences from Kurosawa.
I:9191;4;"And one of the more informative features is an excerpt from ""The World of Kazu Miyagawa, the film's cinematographer."
I:9191;5;Boy was I surprised how well this popular movie was shot, the camera trickery through the woods is spectacular, I love how the sun blazes and blinds the camera in certain shots.
I:9191;6;"To have a film that holds the coveted title of being the reason that the ""Best Foreign Film"" category was created for the Oscars is one thing, but to be able to back up that myth with a powerful film that speaks both about humanity and the strength of truth is a whole new angle."
I:9191;7;Often we witness powerful foreign films that slip through the lines of cinema, regarded by so many as valuable assets to the film community, but never see the gold of Oscar.
I:9191;8;In the same sense, sometimes the most popular of those foreign films eventually become Oscar contenders, not because they are worthy enough, but because studios had the funds to allow bigger distribution to audiences, thus allowing popularity to do the rest.
I:9191;9;Rashmon is a rare breed of film.
I:9191;10;His bold storytelling, creative camera work, and powerful characters give us a unique story that should be included in everyone's film library.
I:9191;11;At the end of these films the truth is discovered, but not in Rashmon.
I:9191;12;"Kurosawa has taken the story and provided us with the main character being truth, and like Kaiser Soze, the greatest trick it ever pulled was convincing us that ""it didn't exist""."
I:9191;13;This is a constantly evolving film that will continually get better with time.
I:9191;14;outside of these beautiful themes, Rashmon is a flawless film.
I:9191;15;To begin, the performance by Toshiro Mifune ranks among the best in film history.
I:9191;16;He is insane, passionate, loyal, and villainous all at the same time.
I:9191;17;top, I found each of his portrayals as accurate and astute.
I:9191;18;When Mifune is on the screen his presence commands your eyes and you cannot help but become involved.
I:9191;19;While her characters is the most confusing/suspicious of them all, Masayuki Mori keeps us intertwined with the story by controlling her character with the greatest of ease.
I:9191;20;When it is time for her to be unleashed, the true drama of the story is thrown in your face with brilliance and expertise.
I:9191;21;overall, I thought that this was a near perfect film.
I:9191;22;Kurosawa is intense, original, and adeptly secure about his stories.
I:9191;23;My only concern with this film is that if you are going to watch this movie, make sure that you can devote your entire mind to it.
I:9191;24;I especially enjoyed the unearthed darkness of humanity, which is hinted on at the end.
I:9191;25;It is a powerful tale that should be enjoyed by all!Grade: **** out of *****
I:9191;26;Perhaps one of the greatest films ever made, the truth and beauty it brings to the screen is incredibly moving.
I:9191;27;With beautiful black and white cinematography, brilliant acting (Toshiro Mifune is amazing !)
I:9191;28;, and a wonderful, life.
I:9191;29;affirming ending, this is a must for any collection and one that you'll never tire of seeing.
I:9191;30;This is, without a doubt, an amazing acomplishment in post.
I:9191;31;"From start to finish
I:9191;32;Kurosawa seamlessly blends a unique multi.
I:9191;33;angle form of storytelling with a simple elemental setting, and his own minimalist direction to create a truly fascinating vision.
I:9191;34;The use of pounding rain, sweltering heat, a cool breeze, the shade of a tree, all serve so well to convey the atmosphere of each of the respective scenes.
I:9191;35;Takashi Shimura brings a wonderful humility and honesty to his role as the woodcutter, and serves to tie the various accounts together.
I:9191;36;Toshiro Mifune, in one of his earlier performances, creates a striking mix of ferocity and malaise, evoking a predatory lion, toying with his prey.
I:9191;37;Truly, a masterpiece from start to finish, and one of the greatest films to even come out of the land of the rising sun.
I:9191;38;Watch it as soon as humanly possible.
I:9191;39;And it's all based on our understanding of what we see and hear.
I:9191;40;Watch this movie and it will really open your eyes to how our society works.
I:9191;41;And there's even a surprise ending!
I:9191;42;class veiled woman on horseback and her solicitous spouse.
I:9191;43;top performance that is completely convincing nonetheless.
I:9191;44;(His career embraced over 70 feature films, mostly Japanese, including most of Kurosawa's output.)
I:9191;45;whistles that help open up the film.
I:9191;46;There was also a great use of mirrors (including one full.
I:9191;47;It uses a very precise screenplay that bears close attention and makes each witness's testimony at least plausible.
I:9191;48;Does anyone making films today put together philosophical, narrative and technical elements so well, and combine them with such outstanding action scenes?
I:9191;49;This is one of my favorite films of all time.
I:9191;50;hand, so I was able to follow it.
I:9191;51;The sharpness and contrast are beautiful.
I:9191;52;If you've spent sufficient time there, you have probably experienced the real thing.
I:9191;53;Better yet, can you say `unnecessary'?
I:9191;54;The film basically tells you up front that truth is nothing more than a belief subject to our own interpretation.
I:9191;55;In some films it works, but in a film as deeply entrenched (or so it would like to be) in the raw emotional realism of `truth' I found the acting here to be distracting and out of place.
I:9191;56;visually, the film is stunning, and there are moments (the ending and that medium scene) that are stellar, but overall, `Rashomon' was a miss for me.
I:9191;57;i give it a C, thanks in part to initial concept, Kurosawa's visual direction and Noriko Honma's BRAVE performance.
I:9191;58;If you have never seen this film, you will come to it and find it very familiar.
I:9191;59;It's story of an action involving several participants, each with their own differing version of the truth, has been elaborated and riffed.
I:9191;60;on by many others since it appeared on the world's stage in the 50's.
I:9191;61;And yet, I found it fresh and involving and well worth a look.
I:9191;62;Rashomon moves quickly, fluidly and gracefully, telling its story with economy and, to me, humor.
I:9191;63;Much is made of the dark philosophy underneath the theme, but I find great sardonic humor in the film.
I:9191;64;It is unique, and the result of a master filmaker's vision, unified and beautiful and unforgettable.
I:9191;65;If there's one thing that's undeniable about Rashomon, the movie that truely revealed its director to the world, earning him a Golden Lion in 1951 at the Venice Film Festial and a honorary award at the Oscars, is that at the time of its release, this movie broke grounds both technically and in terms of story.
I:9191;66;Such use of subjectivity to present a singular fact to the audience, therefore shaking their confidence in what they have actually seen, continues to this day to influence movies.
I:9191;67;It is certainly not an emotionally engaging movie: you're never really brought to care for the characters, which is probably the one reason why I couldn't give it 5 stars, no matter how much of a piece of history that movie is: I just need to emotionally connect with a movie at some level to be fully engrossed in it, and Rashomon just doesn't do that for me.
I:9191;68;What the director wants us to know without being put into words transpires through clever camera work, precise use of space and of the elements the environment provides (weather conditions, light, shadows of the foliage, etc).
I:9191;69;What I mean by that is that what they consider good acting may often be considered as unnatural and overacting by us.
I:9191;70;But the movie, through the camera angle during the testimony scenes at the court, puts you in the position of the judge, of the person who is there to seek out the truth.
I:9191;71;As for the woodcutter, even if he has taken the dagger to resale it, his generosity towards the child certainly more than redeems the theftInterestingly enough, Kurosawa, it seems, never thought of Rashomon as of one of his best movies.
I:9191;72;Also, the booklet that accompanies the single disc contains the two short stories on which the script was based, which is a most welcome addition
I:9191;73;Rashomon was one of the first to win him a worldwide audience and deserves its distinguished place in cinema history.
I:9191;74;though the film is entertaining if the audience is gassed with sleeping fumes.
I:9191;75;Though the film is entertaining if the audience is gassed with sleeping fumes.
I:9191;76;Rashomon is quite simply an amazing piece of filmmaking.
I:9191;77;The camerawork is also amazing, notice for example the shots when a character is walking through the woods in the beginning, there is no dialogue, the sequence is long, there are amazing shots of the sun through the trees, the camera movement is flawless.
I:9191;78;Also the tremendous impact this film has had on the film infustry alone is enough to consider it a classic.
I:9191;79;Even so, it's ability to move audiences of all nationalities and through the decades, speaks very well of how Kurosawa handled his themes.
I:9191;80;of running time, this film tells you more about human nature than most any film will, it has all the richness that reading a good book might give you, and it is cinematically amazing.
I:9191;81;If you like this film, I recommend 'Seven Samurai' for Kurosawa or 'Tokyo Story' for more great Japanese cinema.
I:9191;82;Kurasawa is exploring what truth is and to what extent will someone twist it to protect oneself.
I:9191;83;It's a great idea, but what really makes the picture work so well is that through each version of the story the characterizations deepen and become multi.
I:9191;84;Deservedly a classic, and devastating in its message of mistrust.
I:9191;85;The film brilliantly tells the story of a murder of a man and the rape of his wife from the perspectives of the people involved.
I:9191;86;Criterion has done a great job with the blu.
I:9191;87;The extra features, particularly the interview with Robert Altman, are wonderful.
I:9191;88;From the perspective of a film buff, even from a casual one, this is instructive and educational.
I:9191;89;as an average member of the audience, it's the story in which I'm interested.
I:9191;90;the art of direction and editing .
I:9191;91;Those factors, and the idea that the film dealt with the slippery notion of truth, led me to expect a truly engaging and thought.
I:9191;92;Of Kurosawa's films, I would handily recommend 'Throne of Blood' over 'Rashomon' for an intense movie experience .
I:9191;93;I enjoy seeing how the medium has evolved and learning about film in general.
I:9191;94;a good film with pioneering camera and storytelling techniques that will probably seem ho.
I:9191;95;Budding auteurs and film buffs will find much to value .
I:9191;96;One fact that isn't well known is that artists seized on this film, in the 1950s, as the most outstanding visual representation of perspective and point.
I:9191;97;Each believes in the total accuracy of his or her version but the differences from 4 sets of eyes and ears are remarkable to behold.
I:9191;98;I certainly have learned an enormous amount of art just by exposure to Japanese art without ever having set foot in the country itself.
I:9191;99;Music is lovely and the photography gorgeous.
I:9191;100;Worth watching being aware it is a movie exploring the use of the camera and its new storytelling medium.
I:9191;101;so it's good to find out what all the fuss is about.
I:9191;102;And make up your own mind.
I:9191;103;I got the point of what he was trying to say almost immediately (truth is relative and depends on the person and that everyone's version of a story is told to make him or her look best), and didn't need to go through every character's perspective to get that point.
I:9191;104;rashamon is a masterpiece because of the utter ease in which all this flows.
I:9191;105;The audience is effortlessly introduced to the story as if it were an after.
I:9191;106;A noble samurai and his loving wife are attacked by a ruthless bandit on the highway.
I:9191;107;and yet, amazingly enough, the movie digs deeper, and one of the peasants tells HIS version of the story, as he witnessed it from behind a bush.
I:9191;108;As I sat watching this final telling in utter disbelief, I suddenly thought: I have just watched the same thing 4 times in a row, and never once was bored!Of course, Toshiro Mifune gives a typically outstanding performance, yet this film is all about Kurosawa, the master director working behind the scenes.
I:9191;109;And what a story it is.
I:9191;110;It was one of the only films he directed for Daiei, and it is arguable the film that catapulted Kurosawa to fame (definitely the film that brought international attention to his talent).
I:9191;111;The film was the Grand Prix selection of the Venice International Film Festival and won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film.
I:9191;112;Though Seven Samurai is often regarded as his masterpiece (and often regarded as one of .
I:9191;113;greatest film of all time), Rashomon was a success that endures to this day and without that success, Kurosawa's later films may not have ever been realized.
I:9191;114;rashomon is interesting because of the broken narrative.
I:9191;115;The three characters are a priest, a woodcutter, and a commoner.
I:9191;116;the excerpt is included with this version of the film) that the film is a metaphor for the human spirit.
I:9191;117;Regardless of the symbolism, the film is an icon of classic Japanese cinema.
I:9191;118;I have seen the previous Criterion version, and it is very good.
I:9191;119;The viewer can see each stray hair on characters' heads.
I:9191;120;Other amazing scenes are the gorgeous forest backdrops, the close ups of the characters under the gate, and one particularly amazing and beautiful scene where the woman is running her hand through a stream.
I:9191;121;the sound is amazing, but there are a few scenes where the audio track is off so very slightly from the spoken dialogue.
I:9191;122;The music is at its eerie best.
I:9191;123;Another extra on disc is a 60 odd minute documentary with several members of the original crew.
I:9191;124;If you don't own a previous copy, then either version is worthy.
I:9191;125;It's a film that is timeless, and I applaud Kadokawa for spending the time and money on this masterful restoration for the 21st century.
I:9191;126;Akira Kurosawa had been a filmmaker for almost a decade, since his 1943 debut film Sugata Sanshiro, and had some renown in his native Japan, when, in 1950, his film Rashomon rocketed him to international acclaim, including the Academy Award For Best Foreign Film, after winning the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival brought the film and its director, and Japanese cinema, a Western audience.
I:9191;127;He deserved every plaudit he received for it, as well as every ticket sold, because it is an excellent film.
I:9191;128;the story is as familiar as it is simple.
I:9191;129;But, we allow for this dramatic license because the resonance of the tale's moral is so profound, as well the fact that Kurosawa does not cop out by giving us a `real' authoritative version.
I:9191;130;Off into the rain he goes, with his booty.
I:9191;131;The woodcutter offers to take the babe as his own, that he has six children already, and another mouth will hardly matter.
I:9191;132;The priest feels that his optimism about life and mankind, so tested by the events he has seen, is reaffirmed by the woodcutter's generous offer, and the sun shines through the clouds.
I:9191;133;The visual and musical aspects of the film's ends do much to mitigate the narrative drop to the floor Crime And Punishment bears, and Rashomon is still a great film, partly because its ending is not as bad as Crime And Punishment's, and partly because it reaches greater artistic heights, and dares more conventions, than Dostoevsky's novel.
I:9191;134;Yes, this film made him a star, but the best performance in the film is by Masayuki Mori, already a major film and stage star in Japan.
I:9191;135;In this empathy Kurosawa cinches and twists that bind, and we are turned from mere percipients into purveyors of an art and reality for our own selves that we, unfortunately, too rarely experience.
I:9191;136;This is the type of movie that will make you think.
I:9191;137;For those that want to disengage their brain and be entertained .
I:9191;138;This is an intriguing movie where the witnesses of horrific act each tell their own version of what happened.
I:9191;139;For those unfamiliar with Kurosawa's work, this film is a masterpiece.
I:9191;140;Kurosawa makes clever use of the camera in building the audience's suspense in a very similar fashion to what Alfred Hitchcock did.
I:9191;141;for those seeking a psychological exploration of the human mind at it's worst (and best), you will definitely enjoy this film.
I:9191;142;For film students, it is an first.
I:9191;143;hand example of innovation in film.
I:9191;144;making technique and dramatic effect.
I:9191;145;Yes, this is a very important and influential movie, but it is also fascinating to watch.
I:9191;146;Made more than fifty years ago, only five years after the end of World War II, it holds up extremely well and even without understanding all or even most of the things in the movie that speak directly to Japanese culture.
I:9191;147;She becomes possessed and recounts what he knows about his death.
I:9191;148;there is a very interesting commentary on the disk by Donald Richie, an authority on the films of Kurosawa.
I:9191;149;The person telling a real lie often understands how their story differs from reality because they are calculating their distortion to be believable but deceptive.
I:9191;150;Anyway, this is a fascinating and important film.
I:9191;151;Rashomon opened to Japanese audiences in 1950, about four years after the Emperor spoke to his nation and ended the war.
I:9191;152;watch carefully as Kurosawa takes his audience through the process of understanding.
I:9191;153;bandit knows he'll be blamed, and then recounts the episode with self.
I:9191;154;aggrandizing machismo in true kamakazi fashion.
I:9191;155;The skies clear and the woodcutter, who already has six children, insists that the priest allow him to take the baby.
I:9191;156;It is a gorgeous film visually, emotionally powerful, and is short enough to keep even the most impatient filmgoer content.
I:9191;157;The plot is deceptively simple: a heinous crime has been committed in the dream.
I:9191;158;like landscape of the forest.
I:9191;159;Few films manage to capture life with such a purity.
I:9191;160;the visual cinematography in this film is absolutely stunning.
I:9191;161;"The contrast of the downpour with the ""dreamlike"" forest is effective and disturbing."
I:9191;162;The forest sequence, which soon follows the opening, finds our principle storyteller walking into the woods, as if to symbolize a journey to another reality.
I:9191;163;The camera work in the woods is phenomenal and we get to witness several new techniques being tried out: shooting directly at the sun through the leaves of trees, casting dark (false) shadows from fake trees on the characters' faces, and one long.
I:9191;164;rail shot that, for its time period, is light years ahead of its time.
I:9191;165;The trial sequence is also unique and interesting.
I:9191;166;Moreover, the witnesses speak directly into the camera, giving the film the feel that they are confessing their story to us, the audience.
I:9191;167;rASHOMON is a brilliant film and I believe it holds up to Kurosawa's THE SEVEN SAMURAI, often regarded as his masterpiece.
I:9191;168;i recommend this film to all.
I:9191;169;Its ability to capture the darkness of the human condition is stunning.
I:9191;170;A beautiful transfer to digital.
I:9191;171;this movie is very well put together and has a few unique twists that makes it very interesting to watch.
I:9191;172;If you love Samurai movies like I do then this is a movie to look into.
I:9191;173;akira Kurosawa was ahead of his time and his movies are some of the best films ever made.
I:9191;174;It's got a solid story with interesting characters in an awesome feudal Japanese backdrop.
I:9191;175;if you're a Chanbara film fan this movie is a must see.
I:9191;176;Strangers taking refuge in a temple from a rainstorm relate the four stories and wax philosophic on the nature of humanity.
I:9191;177;With them, it's about the nature of humanity and our hope for the future.
I:9191;178;a twist at the end in the temple reminded me of the ending of 2001: A Space Odyssey.
I:9191;179;machina, but Rashomon will always be a classic, and deservedly so.
I:9191;180;But what a great job Criterion has done with this film.
I:9191;181;The clarity of both picture and sound reminded me of why I liked these films so much in the first place (see my review of Gate of Hell).
I:9191;182;If you are just discovering Japanese films this is a great place to start!
I:9191;183;There are so many other great things in this film.
I:9191;184;If you can afford the Criterion $bump, get it!
I:9191;185;When it won various awards around the world, including the Academy award for best foreign film, the reaction was one of some surprise.
I:9191;186;The camera work, storytelling, script, and setting are flawless, giving us the proper mood right from the start.
I:9191;187;film fans need to see this movie.
I:9191;188;while I feel there are some parts of the film that don't hold up very well, overall the movie has a very powerful effect at the end as everything finally comes to a head.
I:9191;189;The film Rashomon is a pure classic.
I:9191;190;The acting and plot twists make this a truly enjoyable movie to watch for everyone from film students to casual viewers.
I:9191;191;Overall, the film is enjoyable to watch, and the storytelling is superb, especially when taken in perspective with modern film.
I:9191;192;what makes Rashomon notable, besides the fact that it was made in 1950 in Japan, well before the modern convention was used in most films, is that is uses a non.
I:9191;193;the movie is full of action which keeps most viewers entertained, but it is also home to a stunning story of truth, justice, and consequences.
I:9191;194;The picture is better because background information about the film indicates that the director's favorite actor, Toshiro Mifune, plays the lead role.
I:9191;195;This unity is obvious throughout the film which is a work of art.
I:9191;196;"many consider ""Rashomon"" to be the first film that American and Western audiences were exposed to a Kurosawa film and with the film winning an Italian Critics Award and the highly coveted Golden Lion award at the Venice Film Festival and an Academy Honorary Award, there was quite a bit of interest in the film."
I:9191;197;the transfer was created from a 35mmm fine.
I:9191;198;grain master positive on a high definition Spirit Datacine.
I:9191;199;some scenes look very good such as closeups where we can see the beads of sweat on the characters.
I:9191;200;Also, the film utilized really technological uses of contrasting shots courtesy of cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa.
I:9191;201;"ray, fans can only hope that this new restored version of ""Rashomon"" will be considered for Blu."
I:9191;202;it is important to note that the main Japanese soundtrack is included but also the original English dubbed soundtrack.
I:9191;203;As a film critic well.
I:9191;204;(12:32) A Japanese documentary (with English subtitles) based on Akira Kurosawa's longtime cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa who talks about working with Akira Kurosawa and gives viewers insight to the director and the their professional relationship.
I:9191;205;"i was impressed how Kurosawa was able to film ""Rashomon"" despite receiving a low budget and keeping things to a minimalist set."
I:9191;206;Rashomon is definitely a Kurosawa masterpiece worth watching and having in your collection.
I:9191;207;I felt a bit the same way after seeing this remarkable film by Japan's celebrated film maker, Akira Kurosawa.
I:9191;208;It is set in 12th century Japan, and while most viewers would say it examines the nature of truth and finds it slippery, I think it more properly examines the nature of the feudal Japanese society.
I:9191;209;He admits to having his way with the lady, but lets the court know that she liked it so much that she began to embrace him while her husband was tied up watching.
I:9191;210;He speaks for the natural or animalistic man.
I:9191;211;He speaks for moral man.
I:9191;212;"masako represents the samurai's view of the nature of women when she is heard to say, ""A man has to make a woman his by his sword."
I:9191;213;What impressed me most about this film is the way Kurosawa was able to create an emotional atmosphere in each of the sittings.
I:9191;214;In the Grove we feel the trees and the light that sparkles through the leaves, and the disturbed serenity.
I:9191;215;It is more about the who is telling the truth about a samurai's killing.
I:9191;216;Is the woodcutter's story more true than ones dictated by the bandit, the samurai's wife, and the samurai himself?
I:9191;217;the movie in itself is interesting to watch because, as the commoner said, a lie can sometimes be entertaining.
I:9191;218;Akira Kurosawa is very indepth with human emotion.
I:9191;219;but in the end, there is always a new beginning for hope and faith.
I:9191;220;This film is both aesthetically beautiful and provoking of some of the long standing questions of our existence.
I:9191;221;Kurosawa constructed a world for the revealing of the impossibility of absolute truth, replacing it with hope in human kindness and empathy.
I:9191;222;especially the usage of light/dark in a symbolic fashion, the images of the rain, and the decay of the building that shelters them.
I:9191;223;The acting is superb (Toshiro Mifune is always great) and the narrative captivating.
I:9191;224;The actor picks up life in a way that offers redemption for all.
I:9191;225;One can focus on the opening or closing and build a story.
I:9191;226;this is great for movie buffs, those starting with their first subtitled movie and also anyone concerned with interpersonal relationships.
I:9191;227;The question is part of the universality and greatness of Rashomon.
I:9191;228;Come on, get off the masterpiece stuff.
I:9191;229;rated, so MEDIOCRE that my head nearly exploded.
I:9191;230;"Rashomon still contains hope that humankind on planet Earth may be a sort of ""WORK."
I:9191;231;"off that is the most fun to watch and most illuminating to me is probably an episode of ""All IN THE FAMILY"" titled, ""EVERYBODY TELLS THE TRUTH""."
I:9191;232;Of course, Archie Bunker does not deal in subtlety, so it is an interesting and comical take on the Roshomon theme.
I:9191;233;This film is hard to find, but well worth the effort.
I:9191;234;Still, I suggest the Japanese with subtitles.
I:9191;235;"In essence, this is a rather stark though epic production and it may take a few viewings to truly appreciate ""Rashomon's"" true splendor and significance."
I:9191;236;awareness may seek to improve their character.
I:9191;237;"Perhaps we are a kind of ""work."
I:9191;238;What a nice thought, though Kurosawa gives it to us rather like castor oil.
I:9191;239;The transfer is excellent for a 55.
I:9191;240;A definite must for the collection of the world lit professional.
I:9191;241;Somebody has committed murder, but nobody knows whodunnit.
I:9191;242;"Genius filmmaker Akira Kurosawa's ""Rashomon"" is a classic for its skillful direction, suspense and wonderful acting."
I:9191;243;But when taken before the police, Tajmaru claims that he has his fun with the woman and killed her husband honorably in a fight.
I:9191;244;light and shadow whirl and dance in a frankly beautiful woodland setting, serving as a pretty backdrop for some very ugly acts.
I:9191;245;The fight scenes are masterful .
I:9191;246;they look like real fights, as opposed to choreography.
I:9191;247;Kurosawa was even brave enough to touch on the unique idea of having the deceased testify.
I:9191;248;faced Fumiko Honma, is a haunting classic scene.
I:9191;249;In a fascinating, hypnotic way.
I:9191;250;Minoru Chiaki and Takashi Shimura add an extra dimension as the innocent young priest and the tormented woodcutter.
I:9191;251;"provoking and ultimately quite freaky, ""Rashomon"" still defies conventional filmmaking and will suck you right in."
I:9191;252;It's brilliantly crafted and exceptionally directed, and must be seen by all lovers of cinema.
I:9191;253;century Japan, it is a far more intimate film than its vaunted reputation leads one to believe and quite brief at 88 minutes.
I:9191;254;layered story focuses on the rape of a woman and the murder of her husband in a forest grove.
I:9191;255;Each account unfolds in a distinct style .
I:9191;256;In a blessedly economical style, the contradictions in their accounts multiply as the story unfolds.
I:9191;257;Miyagawa's expert camerawork is stellar in a way that raises the bar for subsequent cinema, especially the vivid facial close.
I:9191;258;ups of the main characters, the sharp angles of the sun.
I:9191;259;dappled forest scenes, and the dramatically ink.
I:9191;260;"Takashi Shimura, who later starred in Kurosawa's poignant ""Ikuru"", is also superb as the woodcutter."
I:9191;261;"daring narrative structure (for example, Martin Ritt's ""The Outrage"" and Edward Zwick's ""Courage Under Fire""), but none comes close to capturing the pervasive sense of ambiguity that makes this movie retain its initial power."
I:9191;262;Anyone interested in constructivism will probably love this movie, as you can read it as a philosophical refutation of objective truth.
I:9191;263;But it does not end there, it is a great movie as well.
I:9191;264;If you actually have never seen this movie, you should give it a chance, Akira Kurosawa has done a good job, you will love Toshir Mifune.
I:9191;265;It was very professional indeed.
I:9191;266;This is one of the BEST movies I've ever seen.
I:9191;267;This movie was beautifully put together.
I:9191;268;The black and white with slight yellow colorwashing was a good look for the story and added to the heat.
I:9191;269;very beautiful music and coloring and storytelling methods.
I:9191;270;Kurosawa did a wonderful job on this movie and it was very enjoyable.
I:9191;271;The outdoor filming, especially in the forest, gives the film an authenticity that you just can't get on a soundstage.
I:9191;272;Toshiro Mifune is, as he often is, over the top as the bandit.
I:9191;273;But being Toshiro Mifune over the top works extremely well.
I:9191;274;It comes across as genuine, and not just hammy acting.
I:9191;275;So what is Kurosawa out to prove in this masterful film?
I:9191;276;This is a great film, however, I do not believe that it is Kurosawa's greatest film.
I:9191;277;Rashomon has always been one of the most talked about films in Japanese cinema, and many place it amongst the greatest films ever, be it foreign or domestic.
I:9191;278;This woodcutter is portrayed by the late, great actor, (Takeshi Shimura).
I:9191;279;The way the woodcutter is walking through the forest, and especially the way the wind seems to capture the forest breathes life into the film.
I:9191;280;Moreover, I really like the way that Kurosawa uses the non.
I:9191;281;verbal area of the film: The visuals themselves.
I:9191;282;As in many Kurosawa films, the cinematography does much of the talking.
I:9191;283;this is one of the greatest films of all time.
I:9191;284;The story, the cinematography, the directing and the amazing acting make it both puzzling and enthralling.
I:9191;285;There is absolutely no way.
I:9191;286;Just accept the point that we often cannot know reality, but we must go on living anyway!
I:9191;287;Rashomon deals with such themes.
I:9191;288;This results in a profound, but delightful psychological and philosophical puzzle of a film.
I:9191;289;the visual aesthetics of Kurasawa's film are beautiful, and most innovative considering the very low budget.
I:9191;290;As a whole the film has a soft, meditative, and very Japanese feel.
I:9191;291;But what is most impressive, is that the pacing can be so lively, and entertaining, despite the fact that the majority of the film is made up of variations of the same scene.
I:9191;292;kurasawa's pallete of truth and humanity introduced western culture to Japanese cinema, and is still a fine introduction to the film of that culture.
I:9191;293;"All in all, ""Rashomon"" is most interesting, and satisfying fare."
I:9191;294;World cinema at its finest!
I:9191;295;One of the timeless classics offering a profound insight into the nature of human beings and the stories we tell.
I:9191;296;"How we see things, the filters we place on our view of the world, say more about us than the ""truth"" of the events we ""witness""."
I:9191;297;This film is a masterpiece .
I:9191;298;"Rashomon is one of the relatively few movies that truly deserves the name ""classic."""
I:9191;299;Many of Kurosawa's techniques were cutting edge at the time Rashomon was filmed.
I:9191;300;The greatness of the acting is best seen in how each actor or actress has to adapt to fit the 4 versions of the same story.
I:9191;301;Multiple perspectives and richness of meaning.
I:9191;302;The movie reveals a lot about human nature.
I:9191;303;Now here's perhaps the best reason for calling a movie great.
I:9191;304;This is also why great movies like Rashomon transcend time and culture.
I:9191;305;And while the multiple perspectives preclude knowing exactly what happened, Kurosawa still manages to communicate truth.
I:9191;306;I can't reduce the message of the movie to a moral, but suffice it to say that Rashomon leaves you with a strong sense of the evil of humanity but also with the possibility of redemption.5.
I:9191;307;But the way the story was told and developed engrossed all of us.
I:9191;308;i wish some grand experiment could be conducted on teenagers (and adults!)
I:9191;309;making over his entire lifetime then this film certainly goes a long way in putting all that to rest.
I:9191;310;We see this premise here as every witness somehow manages to relate the same event in a way that they feel achieves a positive outcome for them.
I:9191;311;thankfully we get Criterion in the driver's seat and not Kino or worse StudioCanal and taking responsibility for the very important task of restoring and making this essential film worthy of a blu.
I:9191;312;"like any true classic film Rashomon rewards repeated viewing and while I enjoyed ""Seven Samurai"" a lot more this film is still one that I look forward to watching again and again on my short list of films to view at least once every year."
I:9191;313;In the end, very few of my Asian friends .
I:9191;314;I think this is something to be kept in mind as you watch it.
I:9191;315;It is widely regarded as a masterwork of world cinema.
I:9191;316;set in 12th Century Japan, the film's premise is at once both very simple and very complex.
I:9191;317;but in numerous others, some obvious and some very subtle, their stories differ.
I:9191;318;As each character gives his or her version of events, the various differences pile higher and higher, leaving the viewer to wonder at the motivations involved.
I:9191;319;much has been written about the look of the film, which is indeed memorable.
I:9191;320;"Filmed by Kazuo Miyagawa, it presents the forrest as a living, breathing entity
I:9191;321;"the film has been extremely, extremely influential over the years, and as such it no longer has quite the same ""shock of the new"" that it had for audiences of the 1950s
I:9191;322;The Criterion edition is quite fine, offering a near.
I:9191;323;pristine print with your choice of subtitles or dubbing (the former is recommended) and several memorable extras.
I:9191;324;Strongly recommended for fans of world cinema.
I:9191;325;I watched this after a long time, still it was as fresh as when I watched it for the first time.
I:9191;326;However beneath the visuals, it deals with something more fundamental and abstract .
I:9191;327;that is of our perception of truth.
I:9191;328;When the film ends after delivering one of the finest example of imagery even by today's standard, we are also puzzled .
I:9191;329;Enjoyable is also the Japanese version of Ravel's Bolero used in the background score along with the brilliant photography.
I:9191;330;A film like this must be seen for the simple fact that it draws the audience into the story with every possible element.
I:9191;331;The acting aspect though theatrically hoaky which is typical of most early Japanese works can be amusing.
I:9191;332;Let me start by reminding people of the world that there are only a hand full of basic stories in existence.
I:9191;333;and the rest of those great artists.
I:9191;334;Money and murder etc. rashomon had a plot o this magnitude, and for the time, this film is amazing.
I:9191;335;I can't imagine what this guy looked like on set making it happen, but I imagine every time I watch this film.
I:9191;336;Rashomon, one of Kurosawa's masterpieces, is a deceptively clever and moving portrayal of human nature.
I:9191;337;The film is about the human tendency to DENY the truth, which is both real and essential to the growth of the individual.
I:9191;338;it is in this willingness that the road to truth exists, and self.
I:9191;339;The final scene is hauntingly beautiful in its symbolism: the man who has taken the first step to self.
I:9191;340;an absolute classic and highly recommended!
I:9191;341;Still, I suggest the Japanese with subtitles.
I:9191;342;"In essence, this is a rather stark though epic production and it may take a few viewings to truly appreciate ""Rashomon's"" true splendor and significance."
I:9191;343;awareness may seek to improve their character.
I:9191;344;"Perhaps we are a kind of ""work."
I:9191;345;What a nice thought, though Kurosawa gives it to us rather like castor oil.
I:9191;346;The transfer is excellent for a 55.
I:9191;347;Kurosawa stands out as one of the great directors of modern cinema.
I:9191;348;This movie in particular is often cited as a shining example of his artistry.
I:9191;349;the sets, lighting and cinemotagraphy are superb.
I:9191;350;He is only partially successful.
I:9191;351;"in what level are you when you assume the judgement about a fact?Remember his beliefs are always relative
I:9191;352;the reasonable doubt is a very well konwn device employed by all the lawyers in their cases .
I:9191;353;"The handle camera is superb
I:9191;354;"mesmerizing 
I:9191;355;"and this point is remarkable, just because the fragile human condition
I:9191;356;this film is a wonderful exploraton of truth and human weakness.
I:9191;357;This really is a work of art, from a film.
I:9191;358;And imagine how glorious those dappling.
I:9191;359;Watch the special features for a thorough understanding of the story and the film's cinematic artistry.
I:9191;360;I highly recommend this and any other Kurosawa film.
I:9191;361;I have been a fan of the Japanese director Akira Kurosawa for many years.
I:9191;362;His list of films he directed are all well known and admired by movie fans all over the world.
I:9191;363;"Many are considered masterpieces including films like ""Seven Samurai"", ""Ikiru"" and ""Ran"" among them."
I:9191;364;"The 1950 film ""Rashomon"" is another one considered a masterpiece by many."
I:9191;365;That is I like this film but don't feel it is ranks up there among he other masterpieces.
I:9191;366;"Before seeing it for the first time I had read a lot about ""Rashomon""."
I:9191;367;"Still for me ""Rashomon"" is just a near masterpiece."
I:9191;368;The story itself takes place in 12th century Japan.
I:9191;369;"The whole premise to the movie is just what is truth and who is telling it in ""Rashomon""."
I:9191;370;In that regard the film does prove interesting and compelling for the viewer to watch so they can put together just what they think the truth, as well as truth itself, really is.
I:9191;371;This is a movie that can get you thinking.
I:9191;372;At the same time there is some action to it as the road bandit and the murdered man, a samurai, get into a sword fight.
I:9191;373;There even is a touch of comedy in it.
I:9191;374;two things that do make this movie worth the viewing is the acting and the cinematography.
I:9191;375;"The cast of ""Rashomon"" is first rate with some of the best Japanese actors to appear in it."
I:9191;376;It is lead by Kurosawa's favorite actor over the years Toshiro Mifune who is the road bandit.
I:9191;377;I would rate this as one of Mifune's finest performances in his career.
I:9191;378;The cinematography is groundbreaking which helps to bring life to the movie with camera angles and unique shots which would become influential in other future movies by other directors.
I:9191;379;this is a movie everyone should watch at least once.
I:9191;380;"Maybe if you do you will consider ""Rashomon"" a masterpiece as many others do."
I:9191;381;Now after a couple more times watching I have found the film to be a 4 star picture.
I:9191;382;"The main thing is to give yourself a chance to see ""Rashomon"" and form your own opinion on it and how many stars you believe it is worth."
I:9191;383;I have always loved Kurosawa's Samurai movies.
I:9191;384;Red Beard is one and Rashomon is the other.
I:9191;385;san as one of the lead actors, although this was one of the early years.
I:9191;386;i beleive that Toshiro Mifune is the greatest actor of all time.
I:9191;387;I beleived that he was a compassionate doctor in Red Beard, a very strong Miyamoto Musashi, and even a Noble Makabe Rokuroto in Hidden Fortress.
I:9191;388;another good, but short role is played by Minoru Chiaki.
I:9191;389;It seems that he always gets the same role and always short.
I:9191;390;He also stars in a few other movies with Mifune/Kurosawa.
I:9191;391;Rashomon is, without any hint of doubt, one of the world's greatest motion pictures.
I:9191;392;One can go on and endlessly extol the marvel that is Akira Kurosawa, his technical prowess, the unparalleled cinematography which is still ground.
I:9191;393;breaking after 50 or so years, the theatrical acting led by Toshiro Mifune that effortlessly heightens the dreamlike tone of the film, and the unsolvable mystery of the tale by Ryunosuke Akutagawa.
I:9191;394;"Outside of the most controversial films ever made, ""Rashomon"" provokes the mind of its viewers just by its sheer 'complex simplicity'."
I:9191;395;"in short, you can enjoy ""Rashomon"" as a true perfection of a film, or as a philosophically enlightening parable."
I:9191;396;I bought Rashomon in VHS, and it was enjoyable, but a little grainy on the screen.
I:9191;397;The images are sharp and the rain imposing both visually and aurally.
I:9191;398;This picture is a major classic for anyone interested in film and epistemology (how do we know what we know).
I:9191;399;The tape arrived on time and in good shape My husband who is japanese really enjoyed the tape and saw it through to the end that same day
I:9191;400;This is a brilliantly told and acted film.
I:9191;401;Kurosawa was a master and this film is a good reason why.
I:9191;402;Who, if anyone, is telling the truth?Rashomon's Byzantine plot structure was unique at the time, and still feels fresh over half a century down the line.
I:9191;403;established classic , but this is one that's more than stood the test of time.
I:9191;404;and that experience is indeed a memorable one, between the artful collaboration of Kurosawa and Miyagawa.
I:9191;405;almost mystical, and surreal with strong contrasts in sunshine and shade, the sunlight (truth.
I:9191;406;while certainly not definitive, there is enough material to whet the appetite (at least) to one of filmdom's truly great masters, and is nothing that Criterion needs to be ashamed of!
I:9191;407;Truly the beat film I saw in film school.
I:9191;408;The same story from multiple points of view was one of the greatest cinematic explorations that I have been prove lived enough to see.
I:9191;409;Was Kurosawa really poking fun at the genre with the clumsy fighting, or was he depicting stark reality for an audience that still romanticized ancient times?
I:9191;410;And is the ending really redemptive.
I:9191;411;The film will make you contemplate the perspective of others as they recount events, as much as the words they use to retell their tales.
I:9191;412;Desire fear contribute signigicant influence over the retelling of events in our lives, and better than any other, this film exposes and contemplates the issues surrounding the truth.
I:9191;413;Has some good extras including an in depth analysis commentary that provides deep insight about the story, script writing, cinematography and directing within the context of traditional Japanese culture.
I:9191;414;Found using both together that it provides additional insight into the more subtle meaning of the Japanese dialog.
I:9191;415;It's an absolutely outstanding exploration of Truth, what it is, and how it relates to what people perceive, remember and want or wish to believe.
I:9191;416;Add to it strong probability of ulterior motives and self.
I:9191;417;The themes are universal and timeless, and Kurasowa's portrayal of the story allows the film to be readily understood in nearly any country/culture, 60+ years later.
I:9191;418;time greatest film with groundbreaking flashback.
I:9191;419;Not surprising to me that Roshamon received the 1952 Academy Award (Oscar) for Best Foreign Language Film, and has withstood the test of time, continuing to place high on lists of the best Japanese films.
I:9191;420;Truth was used simply as a tool of the powerful.
I:9191;421;In this magnificent Kurosawa film set in 9th century Japan a nobleman and his wife traveling through a forest are set upon by a highwayman.
I:9191;422;And with each telling the puzzle deepens and becomes more and more fascinating.
I:9191;423;Kurosawas ingenious breakthrough feature examines the elusive nature of truth, and our ability to reshape it to suit what we want to believe.
I:9191;424;provoking and surprisingly accessible, Rashomon is a cinematic triumph.
I:9191;425;Kazuo Miyagawa's cinematography is incredible in it's use of camera movement, light, shadows, rain and wind effects.
I:9191;426;I enjoyed the bonus excerpts from Miyagawa's documentary.
I:9191;427;In this study of human nature, the characters see what they want to believe.
I:9191;428;see film for anyone that appreciates great art.
I:9191;429;Rashomon is a great cinematic feat.
I:9191;430;Akira Kurosawa, probably best known here in the states for The Seven Samarai, creates a puzzling movie that the mind can't help but ponder over long after the movie is finished.
I:9191;431;what this movie eventually becomes is an experiment on truth and reality.
I:9191;432;Also, a Kurasawa expert, Donald Richie, has recorded a commentary that helps the viewer really appreciate the subtle nuances of Rashomon, little points like how much silent film influenced Kurosawa.
I:9191;433;this movie is a classic and has influenced film makers in the states for years.
I:9191;434;In my top ten movies of all time.
I:9191;435;Obviously he has created many classic films, but this simply, for me, defines what he was all about.
I:9191;436;It's one of Japan's greatest masterpieces.
I:9191;437;It's also Kurosawa's best film.
I:9191;438;"Roshomon is beautiful in ever way
I:9191;439;It makes the viewer constantly question which story is true or which parts of each story are true, even after watching the movie dozens of times.
I:9191;440;few classics in the cinematic world achieve such rare levels of cult status.
I:9191;441;The beauty of the movie comes from the way how everybody's truth and lies differ.
I:9191;442;A masterpiece that has been around for over 50 years and even today anyone watching world movies will find it extremely enjoyable.
I:9191;443;All the stories have a grain of truth but all the stories also contradict each other.
I:9191;444;Watch Rashomon and make up your own mind.
I:9191;445;its story and cinematography was surprisingly unconventional and could rival any Hollywood movie of mordern times.
I:9191;446;it had a story that you will find exciting enough to glue you to the screen to know the ending.
I:9191;447;its a better and more thought provoking movie than the more popular 7 Samurai and I would recommend to all this classic that have as theme that would never go out of date
I:9191;448;"Kurosawa deliberately leaves the viewer in suspense as to the ""correct"" account."
I:9191;449;witness reports literally, this is it.
I:9191;450;It's really genius the way he manages to capture the dappled light of the forest, and his ability to switch back and forth between the faces of the witnesses without in any way blocking the story's flow is admirable.
I:9191;451;the Criterion edition is, as usual, nicely transferred.
I:9191;452;But the accompanying booklet is well.
I:9191;453;This is classic Kurosawa at his best.
I:9191;454;The actors do an excellent job protraying the alternate stories.
I:9191;455;I especially like Rashomon because of the mystery of which story is true.
I:9191;456;Rashomon is a fabulous film.
I:9191;457;great film lottsa samurais rustic rural settings reel gud whodunnit i loved it it loved me etc wow what a film
I:9191;458;This is a fairly good movie, ridiculously overrated.
I:9191;459;There is such a thing as absolute truth.
I:9191;460;I punch you in the head.
I:9191;461;His motive is to paint himself as the kind of hero he admires.
I:9191;462;nobody really tells a convincing story here.
I:9191;463;One thing I like about the movie is that one of the witnesses is a trance medium who channels the dead man.
I:9191;464;That is its biggest weakness.
I:9191;465;it is a bit of a comedy.
I:9191;466;"A lot of ""in"" jokes for the viewer, making fun of the same old same old in Japanese films."
I:9191;467;They just give lecturers something to flimflam their audiences with.
I:9191;468;The subtlety of it is just a wee bit too subtle to make an impact on me.
I:9191;469;to sum up, this is a pretty interesting movie that is ridiculously overrated.
I:9191;470;To be great, a movie should move us.
I:9191;471;It means that the truth is elusive and people will remember things with their own particular spin.
I:9191;472;When the film first came out it was nominated for an academy award and is still considered the masterpiece of the director Akira Kurosawa.
I:9191;473;the acting is done in classical Japanese style, which is more appropriate for a large auditorium than for a small screen.
I:9191;474;There's passion throughout and a great mythic theme.
I:9191;475;It seemed all to be set on a great stage.
I:9191;476;The cinematography is also special, using the rain as one realm of reality and harsh sunlight as another.
I:9191;477;The woods in which the crime takes place look hot and stifling, and the actors are all excellent.
I:9191;478;I do applaud its art and its message.
I:9191;479;"Rashomon is one of those movies you hear allusions to at cocktail parties or see references made to in ""The Village Voice"", and you are chagrined because you don't know what everyone else seems to be carrying on about."
I:9191;480;So I rounded up my friend Renee the psychotherapist and went.
I:9191;481;"Compare it, for example, to 1950's Oscar winner, ""All About Eve""."
I:9191;482;"well, that IS what the hoopla was about with ""Rashomon""."
I:9191;483;all in all, this was my first excursion into classic Japanese cinema (unless you would count all those Godzilla and Gidra movies as classics of a sort), and it was not only interesting anthropologically, but entertaining as well.
I:9191;484;It won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival and eventually the Oscar for Best Foreign Film and Best Director from the National Board of Review.
I:9191;485;A very moving film that proved Japan as a powerhouse in cinema and Kurosawa as one of the greatest directors ever.
I:9191;486;This movie is truly great, but it seems to lose a bit of its power on the small screen.
I:9191;487;Rashomon (1950), shot in black and white, is nothing short of stunning.
I:9191;488;The first scenes show us a priest and a woodcutter taking refuge in an old temple, in order to escape from the heavy rain.
I:9191;489;A third man shows up, and they start talking about a recent crime that troubles them.
I:9191;490;Rashomon was the second Akira Kurosawa film I have seen after Yojimbo and I am proud to call it my best film experience so far.
I:9191;491;The plot is amazing and leaves the audience stunned with its mystery long after the film has ended.
I:9191;492;the screenplay and photography is wonderfull along with the incredibly amazing acting staff that really gave me a new perspective on films and how strong they seem.
I:9191;493;I really love this movie and is recommended very strongly.
I:9191;494;without doubt, this is one of the most wonderfull films to ever exist.
I:9191;495;Watch it and be prepared for a emotional experience
I:9191;496;A true treasure for fans of Japanese cinema, or just excellent film in general.
I:9191;497;One of the best, most realistic, and funniest fight scenes ever.
I:9191;498;This is among Kurosawa's best .
I:9191;499;and he made a lot of good films.
I:9191;500;He is a huge Kurosawa fan, and he ranks this film at the top.
I:9191;501;This movie needs no endorsement from me, it is a classic.
I:9191;502;But I think it should also be required viewing for high school age students as part of learning about citizenship.
I:9191;503;This movie and 12 Angry Men provide a dramatic insight into the need for skepticism and moral courage in making judgements.
I:9191;504;Both are able to get a philosophical point across while still being a tense drama.
I:9191;505;What I can answer is .
I:9191;506;is this a great movie?
I:9191;507;he is a good historian but you want to give yourself a chance to understand the film before he gives some of the meanings and layers away.
I:9191;508;Kurosawa's study on the nature of truth, of reality, and human nature is perhaps one of the greatest films ever made.
I:9191;509;"it tells the story from the perspectives of 4 sperate characters
I:9191;510;but there is redemption in the end.
I:9191;511;according to what i've been told and have read this is the first film to have a shot that's pointed directly into the sunlight and to use light reflectors to help light the actors.
I:9191;512;THe commentary alone is worth it.
I:9191;513;That prompted me to see his two other movies .
I:9191;514;original, voice over in English, subtitles .
I:9191;515;but the format and the scripting is interesting.
I:9191;516;Akira Kurasawa has done yet another great movie.
I:9191;517;This story is compelling and is one of the greatest films to come out of Japan.
I:9191;518;The Bottom Line:Rashomon's framing scenes don't work too well (especially the ending ones) and the message is diluted somewhat by the use of a medium to tell one of the stories, but Rashomon is still interesting and worthy of a look.
I:9191;519;Perhaps one witness saw the beginning, a second witness the end, and a third witnessed the entire event.
I:9191;520;the story is a mystery with a strange twist.
I:9191;521;Each of the three participants confesses to the stabbing!
I:9191;522;in the movie, Kurosawa has told us which version he believes is true by creating the woodcutter, who is not in the original story.
I:9191;523;He then tells a tale that is essentially the tale as told by the bandit Tajomaru.
I:9191;524;It is also to his benefit to omit the samurai's fearfulness, since the braver the opponent, the more noteworthy the victory.
I:9191;525;Probably for the sake of his name.
I:9191;526;Throughout the film you will be amazed at how far ahead of it's time it's film making experience was.
I:9191;527;While the film is decidely Japanese, it allows you to experience the story from several seperate views (including the views of the camera itself).
I:9191;528;The characters also play a vital role in the dynamics of the film (and audience perspectives) by representing all aspects of society itself.
I:9191;529;Without overstating the facts, it draws you in to understand the characters themselves.
I:9191;530;And so the setting of a court case is most fitting and its dynamics allow you to see all of it's seperate parts (including the jury and witnesses and audience within the court room).
I:9191;531;The camera work is also the second director in the movie.
I:9191;532;This movie is a must for any serious film.
I:9191;533;i still find it to be the best move I have ever seen.
I:9191;534;It's actually about WWI through the eyes of the Japanese.
I:9191;535;It has a sense of eternity that fits nowhere but everywhere.
I:9191;536;the direction of the film is beautiful.
I:9191;537;Every scene is perfect, like a fairy tale (one memorable scene is when the woman spins around in the dust and is possessed by her dead husband's spirit).
I:9191;538;Mifune's character, Tajomaru, is a rogue, full of mischief and animalism, basically what Mifune does best.
I:9191;539;the rest of the disk is truly excellent, and if you getthrough chapter 10 without any problems, mine may havebeen a freak occurance.
I:9191;540;Lyrical classic film drama from Akira Kurosawa with some of the most beautiful black and white photography.
I:9191;541;It is, and it has English subtitles (I did not try to turn off).
I:9191;542;Interesting story and good acting.
I:9191;543;Without doubt, Akira Kurosawa is one of the greatest cinematographic directors of all time.
I:9191;544;he is a master in delivering a complex message in mind.
I:9191;545;He reveals to us the onion's innermost by carefully dissecting away each layer from the surface, providing us with a clear view of the layer underneath.
I:9191;546;A spectator tells the story.
I:9191;547;This film is the one that brought Kurosawa to international fame.
I:9191;548;A tale of betrayal, lust, and, ultimately, murder, Kurosawa explores the depths of human capacity for evil, yet also leaves hope for redemption of the human soul.
I:9191;549;influential films of all time, it is beautifully acted by the entire cast.
I:9191;550;Rashomon is probably the greatest Kurosawa film.
I:9191;551;The restoration done for the blu ray transfer is incredible.
I:9191;552;This was a difficult movie to rate because the concept was excellent and well.
I:9191;553;this is an older movie which should be appreciated for what a masterful work it was in its' time.
I:9191;554;The acting is very good and, to better appreciate it, I watched it in Japanese with sub.
I:9191;555;I will probably look at that option the next time I view it.
I:9191;556;the story is simple yet complex.
I:9191;557;The story of what happened is related by four witnesses including, in a very impressive use of make.
I:9191;558;This is the magnificence of the movie.
I:9191;559;It ends with the sun shinning and we are given a note of hope to finish up with.
I:9191;560;Still other feel responsible for many things completely beyond their control.
I:9191;561;Rashamon is an incredibly influential film.
I:9191;562;There is also a self.
I:9191;563;12th Century Samurai and their sword fighting, the status of women in Japan, their victimization, all is standard film fare in the East.
I:9191;564;this one is a thoughtful film with interesting, original cinematography, but for those looking for huge battles as shown in the later Ran, this one is a Perry Mason court case.
I:9191;565;Compelling to watch, it may tale an effort on your part but at its conclusion you will know you have watched something special which will stay with you for some time.
I:9191;566;this alone makes it special for a student of cinema.
I:9191;567;One of the classics of Japanese cinema.
I:9191;568;Well acted, good production, and a plot that is both rewarding and entertaining.
I:9191;569;Considered one of Kurosawa's masterpieces and a groundbreaking film in terms of its narrative strategy, this Criterion release provides viewers with an excellent visual rendition of the film along with a wealth of extra material that enhances the experience for those who want to study the fil more closely.
I:9191;570;OK, OK, this is a classic film .
I:9191;571;I'm interested in films: it's nice to be able to add this to my collection.
I:9191;572;Each person tells their own version of events, including the murder victim who tells the story through a medium.
I:9191;573;Rashomon (Akira Kurosawa, 1950)It is a measure of how memorable I found Rashomon that, while watching it earlier this week, I realized roughly three.
I:9191;574;That said, and taking the fact that I'd forgotten I'd seen the film before into account, it's a pretty good little flick.
I:9191;575;knows what's real and what isn't.
I:9191;576;"And it's certainly not a bad film
I:9191;577;acted (well, except for that laugh), well.
I:9191;578;directed, and fun to watch.
I:9191;579;Enjoyable, but not Kurosawa's best.
I:9191;580;Is this the first film to fully embrace relativism?Certainly somewhat existential and post modern in its central conceit, this exceptionally absorbing drama still resonates with a timely and provocative tale of the illusive nature of so. called Truth.
I:9191;581;through an ingenious use of camera and flashbacks, Kurosawa reveals the seemingly paradoxical complexities of human nature as four people .
I:9191;582;Toshiro Mifune gives another commanding performance in this eloquent masterwork that secured his international stardom.
I:9191;583;with a restored image and sound, this classic revolutionized film language and introduced Japanese cinema to a global audience.
I:9191;584;Loaded with extras, including a video introduction by Robert Altman and a brilliant commentary by Japanese film historian Donald Richie.
I:9191;585;"Excerpts are also included from ""The World of Kazuo Miyagawa,"" a documentary about Rashomon's incredible cinematographer."
I:9191;586;even in the pantheon of our greatest filmmakers, Kurosawa stands apart as an intellectual and an artist.
I:9191;587;His best films have a shimmering beauty and a visceral impact while also engaging the mind.
I:9191;588;This 1950 masterpiece is an essential element of any serious digital library.
I:9191;589;Great acting, fast paced, and easy to understand why it's a classic.
I:9191;590;This film, of course, was the inspiration for the Paul Newman Western, 'The Outrage', so if imitation is the highest form of flattery this fascinating film has been flattered plenty.
I:9191;591;the murdered husband via a medium and 4.
I:9191;592;ties up the husband and rapes his beautiful wife in front of his eyes.
I:9191;593;Professor Porter gives us a careful summary of the film with his thoughtful comments on the challenge of knowing the absolute truth about what we experience.
I:9191;594;"I sat up close to my 32"" Panasonic and wished I had a larger TV so that I might be drawn in more completely as a witness to the complex and engaging story."
I:9191;595;Soon another man, a commoner, joins them and the woodcutter begins to share with the two other men his confusion about the facts surrounding a recent rape and murder.
I:9191;596;Then the samurai, by means of a medium, indicates that he committed suicide.
I:9191;597;Kurosawa demonstrates convincingly that in the telling of events each viewer is likely to put forward a version that enhances the way that viewer is perceived by others.
I:9191;598;In a world filled with competing stimuli, where do we focus our attention?
I:9191;599;Reality is fabulous, as in this Kurosawa film, but he shows us that it is also as ephemeral as the light passing through the trees in the forest creating shadows everywhere.
I:9191;600;rashomon was made for a Japanese audience and was very popular in Japan.
I:9191;601;In 1951 it was shown at the Venice Film Festival and won the Golden Lion Award.
I:9191;602;Since that time it has taken its place among the finest films ever made.
I:9191;603;the greatness of the film is the story it tells and the superb perfomances of all the actors.
I:9191;604;This film is a highly visual, almost a throwback to silent pictures.
I:9191;605;Additionally, the superb camera work is a most important part of the story telling process.
I:9191;606;Akira Kurosawa's 1950 masterpiece was the western culture's introduction to the greatness that is Akira Kurosawa.
I:9191;607;This is an incredible film.
I:9191;608;One of the best of all time, one that is not dated, features great acting, amazing direction, and one doozy of a story.
I:9191;609;This just may be my favorite Kurosawa film.
I:9191;610;It's an intellectual and entertainment treat.
I:9191;611;in the story line, it's so hot.
I:9191;612;A simple answer, and the one Kurosawa gave to his uncomprehending assistant directors was that we all invent our own little worlds, and our version of a story flatters our own self.
I:9191;613;the bandit wishes to be seen as bold and powerful, beyond the confines of law.
I:9191;614;"The woodcutter, when finally confronted, wishes to ""tell the truth""."
I:9191;615;"the film puts ""the truth"" into a relativistic purgatory, and is unfathomable, and yet, completely truthful."
I:9191;616;This is surely one of the most exquisitely filmed works of all cinema, so sensitively photographed that the shades of grey suggest colors.
I:9191;617;"I see Mifune's eyes, lit by a reflection of the sun from a mirror laced with foilage (a trick the cinematographer used to increase the available light in the forest while retaining the proper ""leaf."
I:9191;618;rashomon is the film that catapulted Japanese film into the international cinematic consciousness, made a reputation for Kurosawa, launched Mifune to international stardom, and revolutionized cinematography.
I:9191;619;Go and take a look.
I:9191;620;RASHOMON: One of many masterpiece sets from the six.
I:9191;621;"worthwhile mark by materializing the community school project for underprivileged children that had been put on hold for long before his FIN DE TEMPS eventually came
I:9191;622;telling sequence / screenplay ( More or less like Pulp Fiction's ) Rashomon was artistically portrayed in ways to continuously provoke viewers' thoughts wittily with the sublime performance by the main characters under magnificent light use within the tensed atmosphere wherever appropriate.
I:9191;623;the film will suit best the following viewer types: 1) Unconventional die.
I:9191;624;Kurosawa sensei ( master ) is probably the best conventional director of all time.
I:9191;625;one of the best movies ever made.
I:9191;626;provoking rumination on the nature of memory, truth and self, and the gorgeous work of Kurosawa make this a masterpiece.
I:9191;627;It has stood the test of time remarkably well.
I:9191;628;And, like the Catcher, it's a classic.
I:9191;629;life?Rashomon dovetailed beautifully with one of my favorite quotes:Truth has many faces, and any one of them alone is a lie.
I:9191;630;"but thats what gives the film it's charm,because the truth ""is"" and will remain hidden deep inside the heart of the film."
I:9191;631;tough the film might hide the truth at times theire is one truth that one knows after watching.
I:9191;632;it's that this film is a tresor.
I:9191;633;This film is really something special .
I:9191;634;so if I can convince someone to watch it I think it is worth my time.
I:9191;635;This is one of the finest Japanese films I have seen .
I:9191;636;so this philosophical film about truth is probably my favorite Kurosawa film .
I:9191;637;My favorite aspect of the film is the photography .
I:9191;638;the rain, the lighting, the forest with sun coming through the trees.
I:9191;639;ups of people are very powerful and every bit as classically cinematic as anything from hollywood.
I:9191;640;The story is so intriguing as well .
I:9191;641;it is more about the nature of story.
I:9191;642;so Kurosawa in a way is examining himself .
I:9191;643;and one that leads to philosophical contemplation .
I:9191;644;Rashomon is one of the great movies for the ages.
I:9191;645;"It challenges us to think about what ""reality"" might be, and leads us to wonder if we can truly comprehend ""reality."
I:9191;646;including the world of human affairs.
I:9191;647;This 1950 film, starring Toshiro Mifune as a bandit, is based on what seems to be a straightforward event.
I:9191;648;The three: a woodcutter, a priest, and a peasant.
I:9191;649;And each version (the dead samurai's version is provided through a medium) differs remarkably from the other two.
I:9191;650;And contemporary psychologists tell us the same: humans are remarkably able to distort reality to protect self.
I:9191;651;image and make their motives appear to be good (and competitors' to be not so good).
I:9191;652;In that sense, there is a great deal of human nature, psychology, and philosophy at stake in this movie.
I:9191;653;things sound pretty bleak, but the movie closes with an event that actually provides some hope that humans can produce value and make positive things happen.
I:9191;654;all in all, a wonderful movie.
I:9191;655;Effects are pretty simple (the budget was unbelievably small).
I:9191;656;In the end, though, this is a movie well worth viewing, in large part because of the difficult questions that it raises.
I:9191;657;A Warrior, his Wife, and a Thief encounter each other in a forest.
I:9191;658;Through a series of flashbacks and stories.
I:9191;659;I'm happy to report that RASHOMON can be enjoyed without notepad or textbook.
I:9191;660;It's a beautiful looking black.
I:9191;661;In other words, he's brilliant, and repeated viewings won't catch him playing it false.
I:9191;662;there are classics and there are Classics, and Akira Kurosawa's RASHOMON is a 600.
I:9191;663;RASHOMON can be enjoyed without digging deep into it.
I:9191;664;The commentary track by Donald Richie is informative, if a little didactic.
I:9191;665;The except from The World of Kazuo Miyagawa is interesting and abrupt.
I:9191;666;Akira Kurasawa may be the greatest director of all time and it is very presumptuous of me to attempt to rate this film.
I:9191;667;Basically, Kurasawa uses some of his best company actors, notably Toshiro Mifune, Takashi Shimura and Minoru Chiaki with cinematographer Miyagawa and musician Fumio Hayasaka to create one of the best films ever made.
I:9191;668;this is a marvelous film with great commentary so that even the uninitiated need not fear a lack of understanding.
I:9191;669;This great film is available at Amazon for a great price.
I:9191;670;rashomon remains one of the most popular and most famous Japanese films of all time.
I:9191;671;"It is very deserving of it's honor and worthy the ""Criterion Treatment."""
I:9191;672;The film won an Academy Award for best foreign language film.
I:9191;673;The movie also has excellent cinematography which has been imitated by many filmmakers.
I:9191;674;this film remains one of my favorites and has a very well done release by the Criterion Collection.
I:9191;675;some of the best scenes come from the version of the swordfight told by the woodcutter.
I:9191;676;It is refreshing not to see swordsmen charge at each other without hesitation as we see in most other movies.
I:9191;677;some of the acting may be a bit overdone by today's standards but this movie is unsurpassed and probably the best ever made.
I:9191;678;It has been called the the greatest film of all time, by directors, critics, and others.
I:9191;679;Watch it and you may come to agree.
I:9191;680;(It's interesting, too, that even a dead man has his own view and not some omnipotent third.
I:9191;681;point: watch the way the bandit and the man fight when described by one of them compared to the way the peasant sees it!
I:9191;682;In my opinion, and the opinion of thousands of people who have watched Rashomon over the years, this film is a bona fide masterpiece.
I:9191;683;But even though thousands of people agree that this film is one of the very best ever made, does that mean that my opinion and the opinions of those thousands are true?
I:9191;684;In fact, it forces you to think.
I:9191;685;does this film have truly stunning cinematography and camerawork?
I:9191;686;does this film have incredible actors in it?
I:9191;687;Yes, Toshiro Mifune and Takashi Shimura are both in this film, two of the very best actors you'll come across.
I:9191;688;This artist directed superb films like bees make honey.
I:9191;689;"There are four ""witnesses"" who give their own accounts of what happened that day."
I:9191;690;In fact, eyewitness testimony was once considered the bedrock of the justice system, something unassailable and key to proving or disproving a case.
I:9191;691;The fallibility of human perception is now beyond dispute.
I:9191;692;As with all great art, this movie poses great questions that don't have easy answers, if there are any answers at all.
I:9191;693;the Criterion Collection edition is great, lots of extras, interviews, etc.
I:9191;694;It's well worth the extra money.
I:9191;695;He was the greatest director in the history of film(the head of the American Film Institute also shares this opinion.
I:9191;696;it is not ventured lightly)and this is the greatest of his achievements.
I:9191;697;He probably made four out of the ten greatest films ever, but 200 years from now this is the one film students will study endlessly.
I:9191;698;From the exquisite pacing to the stunning cinematography to the classic story of the terrible unknowable nature of truth and the effect of perception on it, it perhaps never will be equaled.
I:9191;699;A film about the subjective nature of truth, Rashomon is a startlingly original film from Japanese director Kurosawa.
I:9191;700;Well known and regarded for his classic samurai films, Kurosawa's rich and sharply observed personal films are often overlooked by most fans of Japanese cinema.
I:9191;701;It has more to do with Kurosawa's unconventional approach to storytelling than anything else.
I:9191;702;Like Hitchcock, Truffaut, Kubrick and Spielberg, Kurosawa uses the camera as truth detector.
I:9191;703;We also begin to question the subjective nature of truth and personal observation about the world.
I:9191;704;mifune is marvelous as the rapist/killer/lover (you decide which hat he truly wears)in an unexpected role.
I:9191;705;He's just as compelling here as he was in The Seven Samurai and other Kurosawa epics.
I:9191;706;the Criterion transfer is crisp rendering the black and white photographer in stark, sharp images whose beauty belies the ugly truth underneath it all.
I:9191;707;i'd highly recommend Rashomon for fans of Japanese cinema as well as anyone who likes entertainment to be more than a giant meatball.
I:9191;708;"Rashomon (1950
I:9191;709;it has a certain hip cache, being one that cineastes have all seen and can discuss in great detail.
I:9191;710;droppers know they need only mention the name in a knowledgeable context to be viewed with awe.
I:9191;711;Honesty is also explored in detail, with the wife's honesty being most in question, but also with the three men sheltering from a rainstorm at the ruined gate of Rashomon who relate the story between themselves.
I:9191;712;insane Tajomaru is masterfully acted.
I:9191;713;The camera work is exemplary, shows what Kurosawa was best known for.
I:9191;714;Absolutely worth seeing, and proof of the saying that there are three sides to every story (to wit: mine, yours, and what really happened).
I:9191;715;Roshomon is a great film.
I:9191;716;capture the beauty of silent films, with their focus on imagery over dialog.
I:9191;717;The twisting plot, the characters, all combing to make a unique viewing experience.
I:9191;718;Mifune is wild, larger than life.
I:9191;719;It is a considered film.
I:9191;720;The Robert Altman interview is nice, comparable to the George Lucas interview for Hidden Fortress.
I:9191;721;There is a nice documentary on the cinematographer.
I:9191;722;my favorite extra is the collection of the original stories Roshomon and In the Grove.
I:9191;723;A recent documentary told the story of our female soldiers who were routinely being raped by male soldiers in a war zone and the top brass routinely covered it up.
I:9191;724;Akira Kurosawa, known as one of the greatest directors of all time, got international attention with this film, that opened up the Japanese film market to the world.
I:9191;725;Released in 1950, this film, along with the director won many coveted awards.
I:9191;726;The story is simple, but at the same time the film is very complex.
I:9191;727;Tajomaru, a bandit, played wonderfully by the great Toshiro Mifune, is accused of raping a woman, and murdering her husband, in the woods.
I:9191;728;Tajomaru, the woman, a witness, and the man himself (speaking through a medium) tell their version of the events.
I:9191;729;the film from a technical standpoint is perfect, with innovative use of the camera, and editing.
I:9191;730;The film is very serious, and is a meditation on the nature of truth.
I:9191;731;It is also about how each person makes up their own truth, lies, to deceive themselves.
I:9191;732;Our ego is so big we need to comfort it, and keep it safe from harsh reality.
I:9191;733;In all this film is perfect, and is even sometime called Japan's Citizen Kane, in the way it impacted Japanese filming.
I:9191;734;If you enjoy serious films, investigating the nature of truth, and ourselves, see this film.
