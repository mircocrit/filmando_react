I:230;1;It starts with a treasure hunt where the librarian Evelyn uncovers the Book of the Dead and accidentally uses a spell to bring back a mummy.
I:230;2;this is a great adventure story with a great story, great characters, and great acting.
I:230;3;This movie is also full of amusing jokes, which add to the fun of it all.
I:230;4;Still, it's a very enjoyable adventure.
I:230;5;The first Mummy film was a classic.
I:230;6;the 2nd film was good too , it added more humor and more special effects.
I:230;7;the box it comes in look cool too.
I:230;8;Taking pages from Raiders of the Lost Ark and drawing on his own experience from previous movies, Sommers crafted a fun supernatural adventure that plays like a true matinee.
I:230;9;And it is a true wonder.
I:230;10;Rick O'Connell, adventurer and mercanary, is sprung from jail by a beautiful British librarian and her questionable brother in the hopes that he will lead them to the lost city of Hamunaptra, City of the Dead, said to contain the wealth of Egypt.
I:230;11;dai, he would become incredibly powerful should he ever be awakened.
I:230;12;the plot is fairly cliched and predictable, but enjoyable nontheless.
I:230;13;The main cast is equally entertaining and impressive, with Brendan Frasier doing a fantastic Harrison Ford impersonation as O'Connell, Racheal Weis showing depth in her female lead character, and John Hannah providing some great physical comedy.
I:230;14;There are some great one.
I:230;15;liners and some fantastic banter.
I:230;16;like Raiders, The Mummy is an action movie, and the action delivers.
I:230;17;Sommers has a specific style of directing that is equally reminiscent of Spielberg and Micheal Curtiz, and he knows how to do GOOD adventure.
I:230;18;From the opening confrontation between the French Foriegn Legion and the bandit Tuaregs (which is reminiscent of Van Damme's Legionaire, only not bad) to the final fight and escape from the City of the Dead, Sommers keeps the pace tight and exciting, and the characters impressive, entertaining, and funny.
I:230;19;this movie does NOT take itself seriously, it's honest about it, and it is does so for a reason.
I:230;20;And this is a very easy thing to do.
I:230;21;It all ties into the story cohesively and systematically, but it is nice to get a fresh view of the characters that worked so well in the first film.
I:230;22;just like its predecessor, The Mummy Returns is a saturday matinee style adventure movie where the fate of the main characters, and often the world, hang in the balance again and again.
I:230;23;There are more set pieces, bigger special effects, nastier monsters, and generally more of EVERYTHING.
I:230;24;lord of the Rings era of early 2001, The Mummy Returns featured two of the biggest and most impressive battles scenes on screen, reminiscent of Spartacus and Braveheart in their scope.
I:230;25;The story and characters translate so seamlessly from the first film that it feels as though is is merely a continuation of the first movie, rather than a sequel made to make some extra cash.
I:230;26;The relationships have evolved, the characters, though wiser, are still just as endearing, and the story ties in more with the first movie than you would think.
I:230;27;Additionally, it's nice to see an adventurer stick with his love interest, rather than finding new hubbies each movie, ala Indiana Jones and James Bond.
I:230;28;all the acting in the second film is equally solid as the first, with the same tongue.
I:230;29;cheek situational humor that makes the movie subtely poke fun at itserlf even as the characters are in dire peril.
I:230;30;This kind of attitude toward the adventure movie keeps the mood light, even through some of the darker twists the plot takes.
I:230;31;We know how it's going to end, and it's a heck of a lot of fun to watch this movie get there.
I:230;32;Like its predecessor, The Mummy Returns is a case study in great matinee adventure, adding a modern twist to the genre.
I:230;33;Along with the falleries and trailers, the Making of segments on both movies are comprehensive and informative, with behind.
I:230;34;scenes looks at the cast, locations, and visual effects.
I:230;35;Steven Sommers and editor Ducsay share experiences about the shoot, stories about the actors, and keep the back and forth both entertaining and interesting, and they seem to be having a generally good time all the way through.
I:230;36;the complete package is one of the best adventure sagas in Hollywood today.
I:230;37;It's not going to become a timeless classic, but The Mummy Collection is the best way to kill an afternoon since Raiders of the Lost Ark.
I:230;38;Stephen Somers did a fantastic job directing this movie!
I:230;39;"Somers take on The Mummy is set in the 1920's because, adds Somers, ""."
I:230;40;namun (the pharaoh's mistress and Imhotep's true love).
I:230;41;namun under the pharaoh's orders, but Imhotep risked life to be with the woman he loved.
I:230;42;Jonathan has found a key with a map that will lead them to Hamunaptra, however when the map gets destroyed, they must go to Rick to help them find the lost city.
I:230;43;this movie has everything action, adventure, comedy, and romance.
I:230;44;Whether there is or there isn't, it's still a good movie to see.
I:230;45;The cast all give exceptional performances.
I:230;46;Anubis accepted his offer and spared his life, and gave the Scorpion King command of his army.
I:230;47;it is Egypt 1933, the Year of the Scorpion.
I:230;48;They eventually make it to Am.
I:230;49;namun while the Scorpion King battles with Rick and Imhotep.
I:230;50;the sequel brings back all the main players from the original cast and introducing The Rock as The Scorpion King.
I:230;51;Again, all the characters gave wonderful performances, and the storyline was brilliant.
I:230;52;I loved The Mummy when it first came to theatres and liked the Mummy Returns even better.
I:230;53;For a rare thing, every single character was portrayed to the best by superb actors and actresses.
I:230;54;A supurb job of casting.
I:230;55;what a treat and what wonderful movies to own.
I:230;56;A lot of us can only hope to see Oded Fehr in more movies in the future as well as the other actors.
I:230;57;They should have won something.
I:230;58;popping special effects, occasionally breath.
I:230;59;"points: Director Stephen Sommers is a master at directing action scenes, a talent which cannot be praised too highly
I:230;60;Sommers, like George Lucas, keeps the audience apprised of where the action is and where the next blow is coming from, which enhances the suspense of the fight sequences.
I:230;61;"the acting is competent all around, with Rachel Weisz consummately fetching, Brendan Fraser hamming it up, Arnold Vasloo menacing as the reborn Imhotep, and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson pulling off a final thrilling fight sequence with a warrior."
I:230;62;both films are offered up with ambience, panache, thrills, and enough Egyptian exotica to sate Ramses himself.
I:230;63;fight between the heroine and Imhotep's lost love, and scarab beetles, mummies, ghouls, and king cobras galore!The Mummy films rank as two of the most satisfying horror/adventure movies ever made, perfect for imaginative 10.
I:230;64;year olds (in spirit and body) the world over.
I:230;65;The Mummy and The Mummy Returns are two great movies!
I:230;66;You will hear how great this Boxset is.
I:230;67;The Mummy Special Features: Building a Better Mummy : Making of Documentary.
I:230;68;The Mummy returns Special Features: Feature Commentary.

I:230;70;Wander around the world of The Mummy returns in these locations: British Museum : Screenshots.
I:230;71;Hamunaptra : Screensavers and Hidden Features Game.
I:230;72;I would never own the Scorpion King, so this box set was perfect!
I:230;73;Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz are amazing in these films as a new couple, soon with a kid(in the second one)!
I:230;74;These are the best movies in the world.
I:230;75;The Mummy is touching and thrilling.
I:230;76;The Mummy Returns is funny, touching and thrilling too.
I:230;77;See both of these movies and you will be thrilled of what you watched.
I:230;78;Go and see both of them now!
I:230;79;the mummy is a fun, sexy indiana jones knock off (4 stars).
I:230;80;since this is a review of both movies together, a generous 3 stars are in order.
I:230;81;the two mummy films 'The Mummy' and 'The Mummy returns' are each fabulous films in there own right.
I:230;82;This is due to one simple reason.
I:230;83;That is the fabulous mixing of action and comedy that gives the films a lot of their charm.
I:230;84;the first film is essentially and action film however it can be enjoyed on a number of levels through the comedy, horror and romantic interludes that director Stephen Sommers ties in to the film.
I:230;85;It's great to see such a classic horror character of the Mummy resurrected in a new film and it works so well.
I:230;86;'The Mummy returns' has all the charm of the first film and then some.
I:230;87;The action is intensified as is the comedic moments, which makes 'The Mummy Returns' such a fabulous film.
I:230;88;Although the film is a sequel it works on its own as well, which allows the audience to engage the 2 films at any times.
I:230;89;The only specific difference between the two titles is the first 'Mummy' seems to have more or a 'continuous watchability' it always seems I reach for my 'Mummy: Ultimate Edition' before my 'Mummy Returns' but nevertheless the films are great.
I:230;90;In the Australian edition a 35mm film frame was given with the box set allowing it to work as a collector's item.
I:230;91;As far as entertainment is concerned, I loved both films.
I:230;92;especially if you are a historian and you study Egyptology.
I:230;93;I thought he was a little underdeveloped for such an impressive character.
I:230;94;The mmumy starring Brendan Fraser was an immediate family hit.
I:230;95;Brendan Fraser was already a family favorite for his George of the Jungle.
I:230;96;i loved this series of movies.
I:230;97;they were so much fun.
I:230;98;i loved every minute of all three of them if you include the scorpion king which was cool.
I:230;99;If you haven't seen 'The Mummy' and it's fantastic sequel, 'The Mummy Returns' then you've really missed out on two of the most brilliant action/adventure films of our time.
I:230;100;'The Mummy Returns' takes place ten years on from the original.
I:230;101;The now married, Evelyn and Rick, along with their son, Alex, have discovered the bracelet of Anubis that once belonged to the Scorpion King.
I:230;102;the special effects in these films are amazing and it's action from the word go.
I:230;103;All the character's are very easy to like, even Imhotep is a sympathetic figure when you realise everything he did was for love.
I:230;104;I recommend listening to the three men as they are very funny and you learn alot.
I:230;105;Plus, the case it comes in is also well thought out and the disks actually form part of a big picture that opens out.
I:230;106;this really is excellent value for money, well packaged and extremely interesting.
I:230;107;Probably the best Adventure Series since Indiana Jones.
I:230;108;This is a beautiful Box Set, soon to become classics.
I:230;109;It's something that I will keep forever!
I:230;110;The Mummy gets updated in this adventurous special.
I:230;111;candy in sets, special effects, stars like Brandon Fraser and Rachel Wiesz.
I:230;112;paced action, smart alecky dialogue, and a sense of humor makes this collection fun to watch.
I:230;113;The popular 1999 remake of the Boris Karlof original THE MUMMY and it's sequel THE MUMMY RETURNS are put together in a nice 2.
I:230;114;directed by Stephen Sommers (Deep Rising) THE MUMMY is a good.
I:230;115;It's great fun, and while there are some spooky moments, the general tone is humourous, and Brendan Fraser does the goofy hero thing, which makes it even more light.
I:230;116;That said, it's very silly, but in the Summer when we got THE MATRIX and THE PHANTOM MENACE, this one held it's own to become a big box.
I:230;117;office sucess and proved to be popular enough with audiences to warrant a sequel.
I:230;118;The characters are good, there are some impressive battle sequences, but the plot is predictable as they come, the special effects range from good to ropey (Scorpion King?)
I:230;119;it takes a lot to get and keep my attention.
I:230;120;the Mummy and The Mummy Returns did just that!W O W !
I:230;121;These 2 movies are good together.
I:230;122;The second movie is even better than the first which is unusual.
I:230;123;We have watched them as a family many times now, well worth the cost.
I:230;124;I had a friend who loved rollercoasters and it scared her.
I:230;125;But for 20 bucks it's definitely worth the money.
I:230;126;His mixture of bravery, bravado and comedy was great .
I:230;127;Rachel Weisz plays Evee, the perfect intelligent air head to perfection.
I:230;128;John Hannah's self centered character Jonathan, who always bumbles into to doing the right thing is timeless.
I:230;129;I throughly enjoyed his character Ardeth Bay as leader of the Magi.
I:230;130;Ardeth's timely entrance to help the O'Connell's in the second installment, The Mummy Returns is expected and welcome.
I:230;131;These are two movies that will remain enjoyable entertainment for years to come.
I:230;132;"For me,this is the kind of movie where you get some popcorn and soda
I:230;133;Mystery, intrigue, humor and of course the old love plot.
I:230;134;It takes a new twist on horror.
I:230;135;In the best tradition of ancient black and white horror films with half an eye on family holiday markets, I'm pretty sure the films were released during bank holidays at the Cinemas?
I:230;136;My daughter and I love to watch this movie, it is so entertaining .
I:230;137;we are always excited when it comes on tv .
I:230;138;These movies are so great.
I:230;139;Having them both in a nice case is a great way to display them to the world.
I:230;140;Thrilling adventures with the suspense of the Boris Karloff original, spectacular ILM visual effects, great performances and suberb storytelling that makes these films unforgettable honoary Universal triumphs.
I:230;141;"Brenden Fraser makes a great adventure hero that hasn't seen like this since Indiana Jones, If love ""the Mummy"" and ""the Mummy Returns"" then see ""Van Helsing"" is just as great, Stephen Sommers is very good director and I'm excited for his next project, the legendary space hero ""Flash Gordon"" returns."
I:230;142;In The Mummy Ultimate Edition which has been released in two discs, You'll got a DTS soundtrack which is great, but not a big deal.
I:230;143;on disc two, you'll receive same special features that available in the mummy single disc edition.
I:230;144;This package is really cool specially when you got two great movie with a total collectable box.
