id;spiegazione
1;This film is finally getting the treatment it deserves, a double.
2;discovered and newly discovered by Cronenberg and Criterion fans alike.
3;It's the organic nature of Cronenberg's style that sets him apart from everyone, period.
4;Because it's on and is certainly more entertaining than The Beachcombers, Magnum P. e. i. or any other Canadian television programming circa 1982.
5;office success, Videodrome (1982) marks the first time that Cronenberg creates a story revolving around a single character.
6;This is one of my favorites.
7;Basically, with this film you'll either love it and see it as visionary or hate it and think it's excessive.
8;with that said, the interface/menu on this is one of the best Criterion has done on any title, past or present.
9;There is, however, a nice set of vintage trailers which is probably NOT how you'd expect them to market Videodrome (though to Universal's credit, this would be tough to market today as well).
10;bucks for this great great film.
11;Combined with local favorite James Woods, it entertains you in a macabra way and is often compelling to watch though the movie itself is clearly a 'B' grade movie at best.
12;but for those into wierdness like yours truly this movie really fits the bill.
13;Even if there wasn't it makes for wonderful fantasy thoughts!I will admit that as a male fasinated with Debra Harry this movie is a perfect vehicle for alot of my fantasies about her.
14;Sardonic, visionary tale of an over stimulated society being transformed by its appetite.
15;Wow, now there's a dream job.
16;Father Brian O'Blivion is the funniest CEO since Burnbridge Waters in Champagne for Caesar.
17;I love that Sure, sure.
18;Icky special effects, sequences and a need to read between the lines makes this a hard ride to take but if you have the stomach and curiousity to make this ride you will be rewarded with one of the hundred greatest movies ever made and one that gets better and better with repeated viewings.
19;Nice cover and booklet, but that's all.
20;Debbie Harry gives an interesting performance, and James Woods does the same hyper.
21;Well im not quite sure, but believe me that it's a wild ride.
22;If you allow yourself to be taken in by the bizzare plot, you will enjoy yourself much more.
23;As in eXistenZ, the ending will provoke varied reaction, and much discussion)
24;The characters are far from sympathetic, the plot is often confusing and contradictory, and some of the dialogue is unintentionally hilarious.
25;Yet on the level of images and ideas, VIDEODROME is a rich, compelling experience which will take root in your brain long after the film is over.
26;Cronenberg's imagery, realized by FX genius Rick Baker, is incredibly sensual and powerful, using all the resources of the cinema to suggest multiple levels of reality and hallucination.
27;Harry's incredible charisma and style lend the role of Nicki just the right touch of simultaneous allure and wierdness (she is first introduced as an image on a TV screen, and actually spends most of her time in the film in scenes where she is clearly a hyperreal hallucination instead of a person.
28;She and Woods have a very believable chemistry and should have had more scenes together .
29;visual technologies since then have only underscored the seriousness and ambition of Cronenberg's vision.
30;Is the television screen now truly the retina of the mind's eye?
31;As previously I was impressed by the intriguing progression of the story (in its first incarnation .
32;The main character's vested interest in sado.
33;The intimation that our macabre obsession and media manipulation could ever contribute to the edification of anything remotely resembling Videodrome is both a strenuously unnerving and uncomfortably hilarious thought .
34;But despite this small failure, Videodrome is a remarkable film with an impressive commentary.
35;moving on to the supplemental material is another matter entirely.
36;one culminating the disparate talents of Mr. Cronenberg, John I made one good film then died into self.
37;abject torpor Carpenter, and John Landis into a discussion of film
38;A film that is as undercooked as Videodrome may seem tedious, but the social commentary grants it the impunity that will keep it on video store shelves everywhere for years to come.
39;David Cronenberg is obsessed with technology and body modification .
40;The performances are outstanding including James Woods at his most likeable, and Debbie Harry as a distant emotionally cold woman who is turned on by the atrocity that is VIDEODROME.
41;And now I finally boght it on Blu.
42;Cable's (& now internet and satalite TV) pushing the envelope with their programming.
43;And lots of other little extras that film lovers like me just love.
44;I have bought from them before this, and will do so again.
45;Great testament to the fear that rival underground factions will develop an undetectable means of controlling and mutating people in order to get the edge in their games.
46;The best expression of my opinion comes from Woods' supposed technical assistant when the truth about his role in things is revealed.
47;David Cronenberg is one of the greatest horror film directors to come on the scene.
48;His stylish mix of science fiction and horror gives us surreal films easily compared to directors like David Lynch amoung others.
49;Max Renn, played wonderfully by James Woods, has people go out and find new footage for the network to play.
50;an incredible film, with amazing performances from Debrah Harry, singer for the band Blondie, and Woods.
51;The film gives a surreal look at how what we see on television can control our lives.
52;I recommend it to anyone who loves Sci.
53;This movie is amazing in just about every way.
54;this movie is really weird, but great.
55;While some aspects of this movie don't age well (the focus on cable TV, video tapes), there are some themes about humanities relationship with technology that still ring true.
56;The SFX are pretty good for the time, and have a nice, organic feel.
57;James woods gives a tense performance, always seeming like he's on the edge of making something happen.
58;This film is an amazing weirdlook at how television can change your mind.
59;Im not a Cronenburg Fan but what he portrays is a techno mind twister that will keep you at your wits end.
60;Although people say its weird and disgusting, the whole idea and story is pretty incredible!
61;The image is crisp, clean, and debri free!
62;Sound is crystal clear, and takes you into the strange world of Videodrome!
63;James Woods is an extrodianary actor and fits the film well.
64;rittled bodies,a uniquely erotic sex.
65;Guess you'll have to see it.
66;This is Croneberg's best film (and that's really saying something).
67;Filled with intriguing ideas, slick direction, fine acting, and special effects that are just cool.
68;This (along with Brazil, Robocop, and Full Metal Jacket) is one of the best movies of the 80's.
69;There's a whole lot of stuff here that some people might not want to see.
70;This will change us as a society, as a civilization, even as a species.
71;I will give away part of the movie here.
72;i do recommend this movie.
73;Better to take a nap.
74;Better to watch an unplugged tv for that matter.
75;Contains lots of extras and looks great.
76;In the competitive market of cable programming, he fills a niche, and makes a profit.
77;It's definitely a puzzle, and all the pieces are there, it's just a matter of putting it together.
78;There is a fair bit of gore and surreal imagery, including the extra bit when Covex shows his 'new flesh' after a dramatic encounter with Renn.
79;Now, I knew I'd like it because I liked it before, but seeing it again after all these years, I think I understand it better now.
80;In most movies with hallucinations, you see what's really happening.
81;In Videodrome, much like Max, you have to discern what is truly real.
82;Canadian filmmaker David Cronenberg was fresh from the success of Scanners and this film would continue his fascination with blurring the boundaries between man and technology.
83;The folks at Criterion have now given it their deluxe treatment with a beautiful transfer of the uncut version and an impressive collection of extras for fans to enjoy.
84;It is a nice touch that enhances the experience of watching the movie.
85;The first is by director David Cronenberg and the film's director of photography, Mark Irwin.
86;This is a fascinating, thoughtful track as both men speak eloquently about their craft and the movie itself.
87;Woods, always the animated talker, not surprisingly dominates this track with his insight and entertaining comments.
88;The second disc starts off with a superb 27.
89;Effects Men is an audio interview with legendary make.
90;Fear on Film is a 26.
91;This is a wonderful extra for anyone who grew up watching horror films in the `80s.
92;videodrome arguably best represents Cronenberg's on.
93;going obsession with the merging of man and technology, flesh and electricity.
94;In this respect, it was very influential as evident with the same kind of ominous presence and effects of electricity as in David Lynch's Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me.
95;driven to clearly express the themes worked into the heart of the film.
96;It's easy to read a lot into this film, but that's as much of a credit to the viewer as it is to the filmmakers.
97;still, Videodrome is certainly a fascinating, unique film that compels the viewer to contrast the interplay between video and real life in our increasingly technological age.
98;TV defined the news, fashion, the latest fads, etc.
99;At least in my case, this robbed this otherwise perversely fascinating film of much of its power.
100;It's a world you have to accept first in order to enjoy the movies of this canadian director.
101;vIDEODROME is a very ambitious movie about mass manipulation through television images.
102;sterile perfect, but you knew that already: James Woods is seamy, desultory, wicked, precise.
103;Deborah Harry was born for this role.
104;always a visionary cartographer of the boundaries between the mind, the flesh, the Id, and high technology.
105;knows where he wants to take it
106;Soon our unenviable Mr. renn illustrates an entirely new meaning of Plug and Play.
107;The transfer is clean and crisp, which is precisely what you want in a flick where Deborah Harry's lips get plastered across the telescreen.
108;Cronenberg's commentaries are always intriguing, chiefly because he knows to fill in a few gaps with nuggets of information (like telling us that one of the Japanese porn producers in the film later went on to become Canada's Minister of Culture.
109;Best of all, this tasty special edition is served up like an old VHS Cassette with Videodrome 'hand.
110;in the final analysis, Videodrome is a film 20 years before its time.
111;it's good, don't get me wrong, just that it's one of those movies that messes with your head.
112;VIDEODROME is one of David Cronenberg's finest films.
113;While not for everyone, it is sure to provoke some interesting reactions.
114;the new transfer looks amazing, this is the best I have ever seen this film look.
115;The first is with Cronenberg and his D. p. Mark Irwin.
116;It's a very informative track.
117;Cronenberg always gives great insights into the workings of his films, while at the same time leaving just enough for the viewer to still have some questions to be answered alone.
118;The second track is with the films stars James Woods and Deborah Harry.
119;Woods is great while Harry doesn't really have much to say.
120;Still it is well worth a listen.
121;This 6 minute piece is amazing, thought provoking, creepy and even a little funny.
122;It is an excellent companion piece to Videodrome.
123;A must see for fans!DISC 2.
124;They are all very interesting for fans of the film and for those interested in special effects in general.
125;While not the most exciting convo fans of the three will enjoy it.
126;This disc also has stills from the set and lots of behind the scenes stuff as well.
127;The film is amazing and the extras are a lot of fun.
128;For sci fi fans, Cronenberg fans and those who like intelligent cinema this is a must have.
129;david Cronenberg is a consistently interesting filmmaker and his major themes are on display here.
130;the question of identity and the ways, both physical and psychological, that man is transformed by his technology.
131;Videodrome is prescient in the way it forecasted the ever.
132;increasing levels of depravity and sensation that has become available in the media.
133;All the pieces fit together.
134;Surreal experience and Cronenberg's best film.
135;James woods is awesome as always.
136;This was the film that opened up the very strange but fascinating world of David Cronenberg to me.
137;I have seen nearly all his films since then, and this remains one of his boldest and his best.
138;there are some jaw dropping visuals here, from breathing VCR tapes to melting body parts.
139;he always uses his gore as symbolism or as punctuation to tell us we have hit a major segment of his film.
140;Let me add Cronenberg got strong performances from the reliable James Woods and to everyone's surprise Deborah Harry from the rock group Blondie.
141;Cronenberg's interest in exploring the relationship between male and female, both within and outside a sexual framework is never fully formed.
142;Cronenberg's suggestion that viewers' demand for more unbridled sex and violence on television is leading humanity to a very dark place is his most consistent point throughout.
143;But it is in entertaining film if taken for what it could have been.
144;The movie has captivated me since I was a teenager.
145;esque world portrayed here by Cronenberg is dark and stark, providing the perfect ambience for this sinister story.
146;brilliantly brought to life by James Woods as a low.
147;Deborah Harry is perfect as the hot.
148;blooded and kinky Nikki Brand, a thrill.
149;The topic of media control of the mind is always relevant, and explored very creatively within the frames of this film.
150;This movie was a lot better than I had expected, and definately stands amongst Cronenberg's best films.
151;If you enjoy dark psychological science fiction, you will love this movie.
152;I've seen a lot, however Videodrome still manages to give me chills.
153;It's a genuinely creepy movie, and the weirdo special effects are something to behold.
154;Who could forget the images of the breathing videotapes or the cassette slot opening in James Woods' stomach?Videodrome is highly recommended for fans of bizarre, twisted films and especially David Cronenberg fans.
155;This is a chilling tale of what the future of TV could do and one man's descent into fantasy world by watching a 50 second clip of a snuff movie .
156;It is a complicated enough journey into seeing where reality lies and where fantasy begins .
157;As always with most Cronenberg films there is a lot of gorey parts to keep you satisfied .
158;As for the ending ( which I don't want to give away ), it leaves a permanent mark in your mind and leaves you wanting more
159;Part of me wants to give this movie 5 stars, but I can't quite make myself do it.
160;This film has strong performances, some very original and intriguing effects and some interesting ideas, but the plot falters a bit towards the end.
161;But, what is there is very good, so it's certainly far from a total loss.
162;One of his employees catches a portion of a new broadcast: Videodrome.
163;james Woods is one of the great strengths of this film.
164;He plays Max as a total sleazebag, and he's both very convincing, and kinda charming and likable in spite of his nature.
165;Though these themes are interesting to consider, they're more interesting in the way they are portrayed on the film, allowing for some interesting visual ideas.
166;Suffice to say, these visual ideas are some of the most intriguing parts of the film, and 'Videodrome' deserves to be recognized alongside 'Blade Runner' and 'The Thing' as visionary films which display practical special effects at their best.
167;it's generally more entertaining than the first 2/3.
168;The picture looks great, multitudes better than on the cheap one, and the packaging in very cool and classy.
169;somewhat flawed, but innovative and distinctive film making.
170;Watching this film in the context of our modern reality brings a whole new dimension to this film, above that which writer/director David Cronenberg probably originally intended, and because of that, I did find myself appreciating aspects of this film.
171;comings make it unlikely that I will ever watch it again.
172;I'm a Canadian myself and his later work is compelling.
173;cGI, their effects hold up over time while Videodrome's just look a bit silly.
174;Much in the same way that movies about the internet at the beginning of its arrival seem hilarious in their perspectives about what the net could be used for, Videodrome is a consideration of what mysteries lay behind analog video.
175;Criterion's print is beautiful and the colors are crisp and clear.
176;Extras are interesting, and the packaging is made to look like an analog tape from the era .
177;i recommend Videodrome for people who are compelled to watch ALL the Criterion films, fans of Cronenberg, and special effects junkies.
178;It's worthwhile primarily because of its position in time and in Cronenberg's career.
179;David Cronenberg had set a standard for creativity and will continue to spark inspiration for future filmmakers, years to come.
180;There were no problems with the product when i recieved it, i got it right on time, and overall i was very satisfied.
181;Cronenberg is able to do such a good job at making the most salacious sado.
182;He also makes a naked Deborah Harry about as sexy as a dishrag.
183;does this film make a statement, well yes, but the real question is: Is it worth listening to the message?Zeb Kantrowitz
184;It came in excellent condition brand new fully wrapped in plastic wrap.
185;VIDEODROME is finally getting some respect after all these years.
186;True, it is extremely bizarre and one viewing will never answer all the questions that it puts forth, but it is an incredibly ground breaking film that deserves multiple viewings.
187;And what better way to get back to the movie than with this stunning 2 disc release.
188;Even with that complaint, I assure any one interested in this set that it is worth every penny.
189;The extras that you do get are amazing.
190;For all of you rare people that are unfamiliar with David Croenberg, he is the maker of the new A History of Violence.
191;This is one of his most famous movies and rightfully so.
192;It is a masterpiece, a visionary experience from 1983.
193;even though it came then, it has absolutely unbelievable special effects.
194;The special effects notably found in the hallucination sequences are magnificent and stunning.
195;this is James Wood's best movie who gives a good performance playing, Max, the owner of channel 83, hard core stuff.
196;he is a perverted man, and he has a bizarre relationship with his girlfriend.
197;He realizes that this trully is real.
198;This program called Videodrome has a spell on him and causes him to hallcinate in very original and very well made sequences.
199;But can Max overcome this posessing power.
200;the movie combines lots of fantasy elements along with science fiction and is definitely out of the ordinary.
201;It is hard to understand at times and very creative.
202;Sawing people up in GTA!And that is the genius of this movie.
203;This movie is in all fairness a critique of thesociety but it does it in such a cool and creative way that it's hard not to love it.
204;videodrome is a piece of genius, Croenberg's best, and one of my favorite movies.
205;It is brilliant, disturbing and creepy.
206;The world we live in is trully a scary place and this movie shows that.
207;The visual effects are jaw dropping (1983!
208;it is a masterpiece, a chilling tale, a true tale, a fascinating tale.
209;It's so creative and the hallucinations will have you fully engaged.
210;Croenberg (writer + director of this movie) is definitely a very creative man and I applaud him and praise this masterpiece.
211;Another Cronenberg film that indelibly etched haunting images into my brain.
212;This film is more true today than it was when made, considering the internet and its unlimited access to such prurient material.
213;If any film deserves to be called a modern classic, it is definitely Videodrome.
214;The cast is brilliant, and Cronerberg seems to get his normal sleepy performances from everyone involved, including Woods and Deborah Harry, lead singer of 80's band Blondie.
215;This is an abosolutely outstanding film that touches on a subject that is still hush hush in today's soceity.
216;It is a movie for everyone.
217;This movie opens up a world that was startling 30 years ago, and is astounding now.
218;The most original concept to actually see production in the last 50 years.
219;This is a superb film, presented impeccably by Criterion Collection.
220;One of David Cronenberg's most transgressive and daring films.
221;Good special effects, too, which remind us of how many weird and fascinating effects can be accomplished without the use of CGI.
222;Bought this for a friend of mine who is a HUGE fan of Videodrome, and in a word she described it as perfect!
223;james woods and deborah harry give great perfomances in this highly stylish thriller.
224;It certainly inspired the concept of the RING series.
225;harry's character is a kinky radio personality who finds a new form of life in videodrome.
226;this film makes you think, and every time I watch it, it gives more space for interpretation.
227;it is a great movie to watch while under the influence of psychedelics.
228;After more than 20 years it is still one of the most daring and original sci.
229;Cronenberg strikes a perfect balance between sensuality and depravity, hallucinations and reality, ideas and imagery.
230;James Woods is perfectly cast as the oily Max Renn, Debbie Harry brings a vacant sexuality to Nikki Brand and the effects, while somewhat dated, are still quite distrubing.
231;As you watch this film .
232;and it is one that truly benefits from multiple viewings .
233;you will actually see the moment where a filmmaker hits his stride, and it's a wonder to behold.
234;This is the definitive Cronenberg movie.
235;after watching this I thought that this was a very Cronenberg film.
236;the acting is very good
237;The rest of the cast was fairly unknown to me, but they delivered a good enough effort considering the material they were presenting.
238;The double ending was well thought of by the way.
239;A remake should be made of this movie every twenty or so years to keep it fresh.
240;A virtual entity wants to become one with the original technology, that of the human body.
241;Videodrome is one of Cronenberg's finest films.
242;It's sick, twisted, and superb.
243;The last scene where him and his brother have a scan off, his transformation was very intense.
244;But this release for like 8 or 10 bucks is well worth it, especially for Cronenberg fans.
245;my favorite Cronenberg, in order is.
246;james Woods is good in almost all he's done.
247;Debbie Harry sexy and exotic as the masochistic Nikki.
248;This review is more about why this is one of the greatest films of all time.
249;age human with a body that mutates via hallucination.
250;Cronenberg gathered many parts of a script and ideas together to create a near avant.
251;This movie sets the thriller basis for which The Matrix and The Ring would so heavily borrow from.
252;The commentary from Cronengerg and James Woods is particulary interesting.
253;The extras on Disc two feature excellent interviews with the special effects team, and a TV interview show from Canadian TV with John Carpenter, John Landis, and Cronenberg.
254;The making of film is good and the actual torture and porn videos shot especially for the film are just bizzare to see, and they are provied with commentary.
255;I love this movie, I always have.
256;In fact, the dating of the effects adds significance to the visionary horror concept itself, light years ahead of its time.
257;This is Cronenberg's masterpiece and everyone associated with it can consider themselves lucky.
258;Cronenberg at the top of his game.
259;An amazing director, that all the world will hail a genius when he is gone.
260;This film is really impressive when you consider what Cronenberg was doing with special effects in 1983!
261;I recommend watching this movie in the dark and late at night .
262;Leave it to Canadian horror maven Cronenberg to concoct a bizarre but intelligent paranoid chiller involving televisual mind.
263;Woods is impeccable playing a man whose fetishes and voyeuristic tendencies in some ways mirror our own.
264;Blondie singer Deborah Harry is also surprisingly strong as Renn's kinky girlfriend.
265;This brutal Cronenburg film began with an intriguing story.
266;The hallucinating effects are brilliant, as is James Woods performance.
267;This film, like many of Cronenberg's, was way ahead its time.
268;This film really deserves Criterion treatment.
269;all it is is just something that flows and weaves, flows and weaves.
270;This has been a popular criticism of Cronenberg's as well (in this movie and others), since Cronenberg often avoids conventional plot structure.
271;This film is interesting, it is thrilling (Woods' performance is electric).
272;Videodrome is the better of the two.
273;It is rawer, cheesier, more visceral.
274;and again, Woods is terrific.
275;The nervous energy that is seen in all of his work suits this material perfectly.
276;This film is labeled as science.
277;Deborah Harry's sultry performance is one.
278;She looks pretty good as a redhead too.
279;As many reviewers have already noted, David Cronenberg's 1983 film, Videodrome, is both grotesque and intriguing.
280;While I am not a horror fan by any means, and this movie has frequently been described as a thinking man's horror film, I found it engrossing.
281;I would highly recommend this film to anyone who is willing to take a dark, hallucinatory journey into the world were biology and technology quite literally become one.
282;fi classic that is far better received (and understood) today than it was during its initial release.
283;the picture is crisp and the best it's ever looked, the special features are interesting and probably the best the fans have gotten or will ever get.
284;However this is easily one of the ones I'll be eager to show off and it's one I'm proud to have in my collection.
285;an amazing disc for an amazing movie.
286;Was really impressed by this along with the condition.
287;James Woods can make the best of any script, Deborah Harry didn't embarrass herself, and we can take comfort in the fact that Rick Baker's visual effects will improve considerably from these rough forms seen in the movie (yuk).
288;Max's job is to search and find programs that keep pushing the aggressive nature of the network and can keep the viewer numbers up.
289;This shadow land draws the audience into a paranoid cinematic experience where the threat is located directly in front of them, the television.
290;The exceptional special effects are a big part of creating the bizarre atmosphere, which are startling with the breathing video tapes, open stomachs, and a sensually moving television.
291;When Videodrome's end credits roll over the screen the audience will have experienced a truly unique film, which will cause much room for debate and pondering.
292;Debbie Harry does a great performance as a kinky talk.
293;she and Woods have great chemistry together, and it was too bad they didn't have more scenes together.
294;The footage looks realistic enough for him to suspect it may actually be snuff, so he starts to investigate further.
295;one, including the viewer, is quite sure what's real.
296;this movie is really bizarre, even for David Cronenberg, but his movies are always really cool, original, and fascinating (with the exception of Crash, which I actually dozed off during).
297;Rick Baker's FX are great, there's all kinds of funky bio.
298;The answer: because it is absolutely mesmerizing.
299;Barry Convex is actually a very well placed pun.
300;In any case, the movie, while extreme, is definitely worth seeing if you can take the violence and the lurid atmosphere.
301;David Cronenberg's VIDEODROME, his 6th movie, was the first of his great films.
302;Fans of cronenberg a must!
303;David Cronenberg directed this bizarre masterpiece about a man who is losing his grip on reality after watching a snuff film over a pirate broadcast.
304;The film is very unique because it shows you almost exclusively what Woods himself sees and experiences.
305;While a few ideas are dated (especially the size of the televisions shown and betamax tapes) this is one of the more original films you will ever see.
306;ray has held its value.
307;with the knowledge I'll be sounding like a pervert, I got this movie just to see the whole clip and then on the way, I was cast into a Twilight Zone typical movie that made me wonder just what was real and what wasn't.
308;It's an interesting movie in which Wood's character is showing soft to hard pornography on his channels.
309;there are a lot of positive aspects to be extracted from this movie, and being a huge fan of Cronenberg I was expecting to be as enthusiastic as everyone else about this one.
310;on the positive side, Videodrome IS a bit of a sly satire on television that's still relevant today.
311;Cronenberg's script is stuffed with issues of social and political importance, so much that it takes a few viewings to completely observe his intentions (the mark of a good film).
312;david Cronenberg is one of the most talented directors working today, and Videodrome IS a good movie, but.
313;What can one say about David Croneneberg's Videodrome?Just that it's one of his most interesting films.
314;Cronenberg's filmography is truely unique and strange.
315;I recomend watching this masterpiece of the 80s, and especially the Criterion Collection edition.
316;masochistic by nature, you might enjoy it.
317;His modern movie scores are much better.
318;Max Renn (masterfully underplayed by a top.
319;edge shows (most of which involve pornography and violence).
320;like most of Cronenberg's films, Videodrome is a viscerally dizzying experience, and one that is bound to leave you scratching your head.
321;For its time, the special effects are well done: televisions pulse like living blocks of veined flesh, guns graft themselves to hands with bone.
322;Videodrome is, most obviously, an unabashed critique of the culture of mass media (and, yes, the movie is aware of the hyper.
323;In some ways, this is what makes the flick a wonderful thing to watch .
324;Cronenberg takes pains to blend his motives within his films.
325;The carrot, in this case, is the promise of meaning and cognizance.
326;didacticism, especially when it is dressed with this kind of throbbing, unsettling flesh, can be distasteful for some, and it goes without saying that, for most, Cronenberg is an acquired taste.
327;But beyond the validity of any point he is trying to make with Videodrome, it must be said that the way he makes that point is certainly compelling.
328;great fx and fun stroy, and like Dr. Oblivion, as a public access cable producer myself.
329;It's my personal favorite of Cronenberg's films.
330;radio host Debbie Harry into the other world of Videodrome.
331;He manages to track down it's source and discovers the ultimate takeover using the new flesh.
332;Incredible special effects and in one scene hand gun takes on an all new meaning.
333;Just watch it and judge for yourself but be aware this is an intense and graphic film.
334;Fascinating viewing and absolutely bizarre.
335;This is one of those films you absorb rather than follow.
336;This is a frightening Acid Trip through bizarro reality with cool and gruesome special effects and an atmposphere that's imposing and engrossing.
337;Great transfer, solid extras, commentary, but no surround sound?
338;Cronenberg explores a wide range of issues and combines intellect with imagination to create something special, from the philosophies of Prof. Brian O'Blivion to Max Renn's concerns about his exposure to a satellite TV station that seems to transmit nothing but snuff movies.
339;Soon, all of us will have special names .
340;Rick Baker's special effects are great.
341;Overall, the movie is unsettling, complex, and stands as an exemplar of David Cronenberg's best work.
342;It is complex, but viewers of Videodrome are supported by the material to a greater degree than is the case with many of David Lynch's movies.
343;Everything in my opinion is absolutely perfect, from facial expressions, to hand movements, to dioluge, is just perfect in every way possible, and I could not ask for anything more.
344;the special effects are mind.
345;this Criteion print is, for lack of a better word, beautiful.
346;Featuretes on the special effects of Videodrome, and my favorite feature, a roundtable discussion with directors John Carpenter, Mick Garris, John Landis, and David Cronenburg from 1982 discussing horror films in general.
347;One of my favorite movies with John Hurt, John Woods and Deborah Harry.
348;A group working with a media philosopher (a nice parody of Marshall McCluhan) has created a signal that can be superimposed on a video program that will, quite literally, mutate the brain.
349;videodrome is a wonderfully original movie that mixes a well crafted script with some novel (for the time) special effects and a marvelous darkly comic sensibility.
350;Puns abound
351;integrated into society by providing them with exposure to television.
352;All in all, a compelling and original film that will delight any fan of cult films and erotic horror.
353;This is one of those movies that can suck you into it it's story waiting to see what happens next, and then literally shoots itself in the head in the end.
354;He soon finds he is in over his head when he begins to discover the mysteries of these broadcasts, and the effects they when you view it.
355;It's effects are decent for the time.
356;I must say tho, Jack Creley had a decent performance.
357;I actually thought he was Vincent Price, and i'm sure he was impersonating him.
358;He did a pretty good job of that.
359;I see this more as just a cult favorite of those into the directer/producers work or fans of the time who hadn't seen something like it before.
360;or a bigger one than it did.
361;One of the best movies ever made.
362;Cronenberg hit top form and top weirdness with this one.
363;The best way to watch this film is to have very little knowledge of what it is about before seeing it.
364;Other reviewers here have eloquently described all the fine points of this movie.
365;Like Cronenberg's other films, there is a method to the madness, with links and themes to the media and a scathing social commentary on the media run world we live in.
366;Television and video games draw us into alternate worlds and perhaps lodge into our sense of what is real more than we realize.
367;The greatest visionary of our age, and a genius of the screen.
368;The new flesh has come, go back in time and be reminded of the days when it had just been born with Videodrome.
369;The Criterion Edition of this film is a very nice edition to any collection.
370;Much nicer and pleasant to enjoy.
371;Lots of slimy special effects including a man who turns inside out after being shot and a pistol that fuses to Woods's hand.
372;Overall, a highly enjoyable and yet somewhat confusing film from the great master of biological horror.
373;James Woods is excellent as Max Renn, the cable station programmer who's violent program lineup provides an outlet for the viewers frustrations.
374;He believes his search for the perfect show is complete when he accidentally taps into a program called 'Videodrome' on a pirate satellite.
375;Cronenberg is a director unlike any other.
376;The subtlety of the plot makes each scene more abrasive in its aim to shock the viewer and the special effects really set the bar to the era this film was made.
377;Also the developement of Max Renn's character is convincing as he is becoming more and more desensitized to The Videodrome until the boundaries between the two subjects become blurred and Max inevitably becomes a monster as a result of his exposure to it.
378;By interpreting it in such a creative and entertaing way do I rate Cronenberg as being of the greatest science fiction storytellers of late, portraying the plight of human existence in the realm of technological overstimulation.
379;A must for any modern science fiction or post.
380;Given the rise in cable TV and reality programming of 2001, this now 20 year old film is like an eerie glimpse into the seedy side of modern entertainment.
381;Great f/x, fantastic kinky scene where Woods' pierces Harry's ears while they make love.
382;addict role that he plays so well, is a television producer for an underground station.
383;There is something Videodrome has that you dont have.
384;If you catch yourself sliding into a hallucinatory trance, just sit back and enjoy it.
385;This is one of Cronenbergs best films to date, also one of his most odd.
386;This movie is great and this criterion version is stunning!
387;after it was over, we just sat there and thought What the !
388;truly memorable (She was the hottest punk rocker at the time.)
389;The unrated director's cut is the way to go .
390;the included items and features are about as good as it gets for an old movie.
391;It's quite complete and well done.
392;Definitely a cult film and by far, one of the best Criterion releases (cover art, features, booklet, etc)This movie is bizarre, gory, provocative, insane and surreal.
393;His hallucinations eventually begin to transform his body, and he peels back the mystery of what Videodrome actually is.
394;this is a great film.
395;I loved it, and I'm a general fan of the Criterion Collection's library of films.
396;It has a beautifully designed case, and essays, and pleant of extras, as you would expect from a Criterion release.
397;overall, I'd say that the Criterion version of the film is worth it.
398;Over twenty years have passed since the release of this movie, and it still continues to amaze, confuse, disgust, and genuinely entertain viewers.
399;David Cronenberg struck us with ideas that are still frightening to this day, and we love him for it.
400;If you like your movies clean cut and wrapped up nice and neat, do not attempt to watch this.
401;Though not as out there as a David Lynch movie, this will surely have you questioning what happened several times.
402;The best version of Videodrome to be released.
403;One of the best psychological horror movies ever.
404;Without the technology of today he still produced great effects
405;James Woods gives a good performance as the main character who takes the next step and is transformed into the new flesh.
406;David Cronenberg made this film way back in 1983, back when t. v. was still somewhat good.
407;needless to say, this movie is incredible.
408;Add to his performance an incredible performance by a beautiful (and naked) Deborah Harry (singer for Blondie), and you've got one of the scariest, yet most thought provoking movies of all time.
409;this movie also wins my award for the finest ending in a movie I have ever seen.
410;James Woods says his final line with such conviction that it just adds a huge level of Wow to the movie.
411;David Cronenberg is a unique filmmaker whose vision of the world is somewhat skewed as compared with the rest of us.
412;Well that is one possible interpretation of this film, in fact he could equally just be pushing the boundaries a bit further himself.
413;He discovers Videodrome, or is a duped into discovering it, and from that point on starts to hallucinate.
414;Cronenberg is Canadian and this is a Canadian film.
415;provoking and strangely entertaining movie that I look forward to watching again.
416;It has a dystopian flavor to it, and, as phantasamagorical as it is, it commands your silent attention.
417;An adventurous film, one filled with strangely compelling sounds and images .
418;more than worthy of the praise it receives here.
419;It fits like a glove and demonstrates the kind of creative brilliance that exposes today's big.
420;It is more of a look at perception and the drug like manifestations of technology on the mind.
421;One of Cronenbergs best and most startling movies .
422;'videodrome' will have you very wary of computers, television, and technology long after you thought you shook away the Kafka like anxiety of modern times.
423;All of Cronenberg's movies confront some aspect of hallucination and perception .
424;Funny and disgusting, and certainly a cult classic.
425;Inviting extremes of response from disdain one of the least entertaining films ever made ) to academic euphoria, it's the kind of film that is simultaneously sickening and seemingly devoid of humanity, but also blessed with provocative ideas and a compelling subtext of social commentary.
426;giving yet another powerful and disturbing performance, James Woods stars as the operator of a low.
427;A potent treatise on the effects of total immersion into our mass.
428;media culture, Videodrome is also (to the delight of Cronenberg's loyal fans) a showcase for obsessions manifested in the tangible world of the flesh.
429;It's a hallucinogenic world in which a television set seems to breathe with a life of its own, and where the body itself can become a VCR repository for disturbing imagery.
430;unsettling, intelligent, and decidedly not for every taste.
431;videodrome is a really original film with plot elements which I think are likely inspirations for the Matrix films and The Ring.
432;the film has some very interesting scenes and special effects including a gun that comes out of the TV that can best be described by seeing it yourself.
433;Disc 2 contains a new documentary on the film's makeup effects titled Forging New Flesh, an audio interview with the film's special makeup effects creator and the video effects supervisor, a 26 minute scene from a Canadian talk show that has talks with David Cronenberg, John Carpenter, John Landis, and Mick Garris.
434;That is all I have to say.
435;james Woods does a great job asthe thrill seeking cable programmer.
436;Debbie Harry makes herdaybue, and plays James love interest.
437;All well and good, but they COULD have included an alternate 5.1/DTS track.
438;A lot has been said and written about Videodrome's influence on modern horror cyber.
439;criterion continues to deliver the ultimate package of movies that matter.
440;Being an avid David Cronenberg movie fan, I've come to appreciate the suttle details in his motion pictures that contribute to the macabre horror in his creations.
441;Videodriome is a movie I've been a fan of for years.
442;The best part of the film is that any day now Fox will greenlight a reality TV show where twenty.
443;When he finds this fettish show called Videodrome he figures he wants more so he can place it on his network.
444;But it's the sexual undertones that rreally set this apart.
445;Okay, so i got nothing better to do on a friday night, so i take out the VIDEODROME tape (out.
446;It's so unique, and even though you wanna turn off the VCR and watch CLERKS or something, you keep watching, because it keeps getting more and more intriging.
447;David Cronenberg's Videodrome has become something of a cult classic since it was released in the 1982.
448;Criterion has done a superb job of creating the ultimate edition of this film.
449;There's a nice, pleasing noticeable level of fine grain and I doubt the film has ever looked this good.
450;the print is the version that Cronenberg submitted to the MPAA prior to additional trimming to bring the film in line to what the MPAA considered an R rated film.
451;the audio soundtrack sounds extremely good with a 24 bit transfer.
452;Dialogue is crisp and clear and Howard Shore's creepy sythesizer based score sounds marvelous here.
453;the first features Cronenberg and his DP Mark Irwin discussing everything from the themes of the film and how the photography embodies them to technical challenges they faced in shooting the film.
454;Woods is quite talkative providing considerable insight into his role in the film and what attracted him to working with Cronenberg.
455;It compliments Videodrome perfectly almost like an extension of some of the themes from the film.
456;we also get a very good documentary Forging the New Flesh that examines Videodrome within the context of its time and its relevance today.
457;There's also Effects Men an audio interview as well as the complete footage from the Samurai dream sequence.
458;fans of the movie know the rest of the important plot points and discussing anything else would be major spoilers but if you've seen any of Cronenberg's other films you'll get a sense of the general direction of THIS film.
459;Videodrome is a rare jewel which could easily have been made in the 21st century with modern effects, but being an older film relies on the basic most important ingredient.
460;Cronenberg is a genius, period.
461;Great cast and genuinely original idea.
462;The best movie of the early 80's, for it's vision, for it's philosophy, for it's images and ideas, Videodrome is my favourite David Cronenberg movie, along with Crash and Naked Lunch.
