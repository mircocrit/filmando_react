I:299;1;One of my favorite movies as a teen.
I:299;2;It is written beautifully and describes in great detail which goes on behind closed doors in the life of a teenager.
I:299;3;i thought this movie was very good and realy captured what it can be like for a teen better than many other movies.
I:299;4;all in all i thought this movie was very exciting and a good watch.
I:299;5;this the most beautiful movie ever.
I:299;6;Special features could have been more extensive, but I enjoyed the audio commentary with director and actors.
I:299;7;Evan Rachel Wood does a fantastic portrayal of Tracy.
I:299;8;The cinematography is beautiful and fitting to the story.
I:299;9;Even though Tracy has a number of supportive and intelligent friends, her hidden desire to be popular and have guys objectify her wins in the end.
I:299;10;But there is a hitch.
I:299;11;as far as the story goes, if you allow for the initial suspension of belief required for Tracy to throw away a happy life to become one of the 'hotties', the story works quite well.
I:299;12;I have to admit I was very impressed.
I:299;13;The entire cast (with the exception of a couple of the very, very peripheral characters) was very good.
I:299;14;Honestly, I wasn't expecting much from Evan Rachel Wood, but she delivered a powerful, convincing, and even disturbing performance.
I:299;15;And though Holly Hunter had her awkward moments when I thought her interpretation of the role was a bizarre (e. g., rubbing Tracy's head and body and kissing all the way up Tracy's arm at the end), I have to admit she was very good.
I:299;16;Others prefer to keep them ignorant with the hope of keeping them safe.
I:299;17;This movie was very entertaining throughout the film, showing you truthful situations of young teenagers, falling into a trap that is hard to get yourself out of.
I:299;18;Witness it all in this movie.
I:299;19;sky poetry and big plans for her life.
I:299;20;"shortly after her socks are made fun of for being too geeky (remember when dj wore the same clothes as her teacher and got made fun of on ""full house?"""
I:299;21;after that, she gets some new clothes and hangs out with the popular girls who (GASP) are a bad influence!
I:299;22;"prose writing skills make ""Kids"" seem like a documentary, every line in this movie sounds like something i saw on a sitcom."
I:299;23;well, those 'troubled' kids say naughty words and do drugs, right?
I:299;24;"she knows what's up, and she's confident."""
I:299;25;Tracy is played by the gifted Evan Rachel Wood (Once and Again).
I:299;26;Wood is so good in this film that you will forget that she is not of legal age.
I:299;27;I really enjoyed the audio commentary by the director and co. writer Nikki Reed, also features Wood.
I:299;28;But this film is haunting and i love how the director changes the color to absolute drainage towards the end of the film.
I:299;29;I am 22 and I know that kids are learning things younger and younger.
I:299;30;"good acting
I:299;31;This is one of my favorite movies.
I:299;32;It is brutally honest and real in its depiction of the lives of teen girls.
I:299;33;Because, quite simply, this is perhaps the single most accurate portrait of contemporary adolescence I've ever seen.
I:299;34;Director Catherine Hardwicke tells her story of a 13.
I:299;35;mutilation, theft and promiscuity, with a clear.
I:299;36;that adults can be flawed, imperfect, and sometimes just plain wrong, that it's natural to wish to alter our bodies and minds when we cannot change what's outside, and that love, courage and faith can still survive in the midst of this, our very human predicament.
I:299;37;"rate: Holly Hunter does a stunning job as Tracy's mom, a recovering alcoholic prone to some bad choices herself
I:299;38;Thirteen is a movie that tells the story of Tracy, a young girl that takes the easy way.
I:299;39;tracy is played by the young actress Evan Rachel Wood, and Evan does an excellent job, she makes her character believable at all time, she has a lot of screen presence and she could be one of the best actresses of her generation, she is pretty and talented.
I:299;40;Nikki also co. wrote the screenplay of Thirteen , the other writer is Catherine Hardwicke, she also directs the movie.
I:299;41;there are a couple of things that I love about Thirteen .
I:299;42;Number one, this is a movie that showcases female talent (to the previous names, add the name of another actress, Holly Hunter), Thirteen shows that an all.
I:299;43;girl team can make a very good movie.
I:299;44;So if you don't want to see this film because you think it's a girly movie, get rid of that idea, Thirteen is a powerful movie.
I:299;45;The film looks so real that one might think that this a documentary.
I:299;46;Thirteen is a very interesting movie, showcases young and talented girls like Evan Rachel Wood and Nikki Reed, also there is veteran female talent like Holly Hunter and director Catherine Hardwicke.
I:299;47;it was a good movie and I have watched it a few more times since then.
I:299;48;good movie I still watch it till this day(5 years later).
I:299;49;"I have read many reviews on the movie ""Thirteen"" and am quite frankly surprised at just how, well, SURPRISED some of you all are that something like this could ever happen to someone 'so young.'"
I:299;50;a student and very much on the reserved side, just wants to belong to something bigger than herself, to somehow escape from all her household problems which continue to brew just below the surface.
I:299;51;She does eventually find an escape in human form .
I:299;52;enter Evie, a popular and beautiful young girl, troubled in many ways herself, who grabs Tracy by the hand and leads her into a world of drugs, sex, and just pure rebellion all in a scarily short period of time.
I:299;53;Yeah it's true, it all happened so fast in the movie .
I:299;54;I would not recommend this movie to the faint of heart.
I:299;55;I would, however, recommend this movie to anybody with young teens, regardless of whether you agree with the activities going on in the movie or not.
I:299;56;Not everbody grows up in a sheltered, perfectly made.
I:299;57;This movie is an all time favorite of mine.
I:299;58;it is so well written and so well acted.
I:299;59;I wasn't freaked out that much in the movie but there were terrific, powerful performances!!
I:299;60;Evan Rachel Wood and Holly Hunter's performaces together made me feel the tension between them and they were total worthy Oscar performances too!
I:299;61;They gave tears to my eyes they were soo good!
I:299;62;The way the movie was filmed was really cool how it was hand.
I:299;63;held because it felt realistic and that you were there watching it all.
I:299;64;This movie was so true.
I:299;65;It reminded me of my friends and i admit it reminded me of me when we were 13.
I:299;66;All the pressure of fitting in and being cool.
I:299;67;It was such a gripping movie.
I:299;68;I cried at the end.
I:299;69;Nikki Reed did a great job both starring in it and co. writing it.
I:299;70;Evan Rachel Wood's performance was even better.
I:299;71;This was a great film and i would give it more stars if i could.
I:299;72;the movie was given as a gift my sister enjoyed it so since she happi so am iamanda
I:299;73;forteen year olds it shows how fun life can be.
I:299;74;And that it sometimes doesnt have a wonderful ending like you would picture it.
I:299;75;the movie shows hjow people can betray you in amny ways .
I:299;76;like Tracy, she didnt dress as sexy as all of the other girls that guys liked in her school.
I:299;77;its a great movie for teens that are in between to watch .
I:299;78;Everything about this movie is GREAT!
I:299;79;It's great to show your to teenage daughters due to it doesn't just show the luxury of the story line, but the reality of the horror and consequenses as well.
I:299;80;Evan Rachel Wood deserves an Oscar for this damn performance.
I:299;81;The characters are dynamic and it is well acted.
I:299;82;In addition, it is a nice change from the mainstream look at adolescence (( i. e.
I:299;83;"It surprises me a lot to hear people talk about how ""startlingly real"" it is."
I:299;84;She pretty much transforms into a bad girl overnight.
I:299;85;saw this with my wife around a year or so ago and this movie is still fresh in my mind.
I:299;86;"The way they show the ""downfall"" of the lead character, and her desire to be liked (and to get a reality escape from events at home) has been done very well, and it feels very real."
I:299;87;she's justa 13 year old, who wants to be cool, hip like the other girl(s).
I:299;88;This is a movie which will make you think and wonder, and that's a good thing considering the major crop of movies that we get nowadays.
I:299;89;Thirteen, takes you on a personal rollrcoaster journey of teenage life today.
I:299;90;With it's excellent cast including new face Nikki Reed.
I:299;91;Thirteen tells the story of Tracey (Evan Rachel Wood) who goes to great lengths to befriend popular and beautiful Evie Zamora (Nikki Reed).
I:299;92;This film exploits perfectly the life of a teenage girl, who tries so hard to fit in!
I:299;93;Catherine Hardwicke has directed this film brilliantly, with the colours to suit the characters mood.
I:299;94;She really is a talented young girl and i hope to see more of her in the future!
I:299;95;The first time I watched `thirteen' I was stunned at how brutally honest a film it was.
I:299;96;It's so easy for Hollywood to sugar.
I:299;97;In it's honesty though it never crosses the line in becoming so overtly dramatic and edgy that it comes across forced and in other words Hollywoodized.
I:299;98;`thirteen' stays true and relatable and effortlessly absorbing.
I:299;99;While watching the film I found my heart invested in the story, in the characters and in their eventuality.
I:299;100;The cast, I should immediately point out, is so brilliant here that they really help keep this film true to form and each actress adds layers of honesty to her performance.
I:299;101;She begins to conform to Evie's standards and a shift begins to take place in Tracy's attitude and her actions.
I:299;102;the film spirals down to a breathtaking ending that resolves much and brings to the fore true intentions.
I:299;103;It's beautifully scripted by director Catherine Hardwicke and co. star Nikki Reed, who plays Evie.
I:299;104;Reed is tragic as Evie, really captures the essence of this girl lost in the shuffle and her breakdown in the end of this film is beautifully captured in all its raw reality.
I:299;105;Her character finally emerges in truth and honesty before everyone's eyes and as her exposure is made clear the sheer brilliance of her performance is made manifest as well.
I:299;106;Holly Hunter well deserved her Oscar nomination.
I:299;107;Her portrayal of Melanie is sincere and heartbreaking.
I:299;108;But no one here deserves more praise than Evan Rachel Wood who devours her role and delivers such tempered and controlled emotions, delivering believability and honesty in each brilliantly calculated move.
I:299;109;Watching her character transform in each scene is effortless and captivating.
I:299;110;As much as it may remain difficult I feel it's also very important that you force yourself through it.
I:299;111;It exposes quite well the dangers surrounding young girls today, from the desires and pressures to conform to your peers and the enticing effects of drugs, alcohol and sex, vices that are becoming more and more accessible to kids of younger and younger ages.
I:299;112;Directed with equal measures grit and concern, `thirteen' is a landmark film that sheds a much needed light on the dangers of adolescence and is one of the more moving and socially important films of the past decade.
I:299;113;By far the greatest film of 2003.
I:299;114;It is a good movie you can relate your own life to.
I:299;115;It has a great story, and great actors.
I:299;116;they could've made this movie great.
I:299;117;Of all the idiotic movies available, why would anyone back a movie based purely on the views of a teenager and think it's a good movie.
I:299;118;Take it from someone who was just there, this is what a thirteen year old girls life is like.
I:299;119;I freaking love this movie.
I:299;120;This movie gets really deep.
I:299;121;Teaches kids what it's really like in the real world.
I:299;122;Excellent acting by Evan Rachel Wood.
I:299;123;my opinion: it is based much in reality, for those who are able and daring enough to 'get away' with things.
I:299;124;its worth a look if the video cover and discription gets your attention.
I:299;125;much as the life of most teens.
I:299;126;I love the movie Thirteen.
I:299;127;If you are looking for a happy ending.
I:299;128;It is a great movie full of conflict and it is NEVER boring.
I:299;129;so go watch the movie and I am sure you will learn something!
I:299;130;I was so excited because I've loved this movie since I was a teen.
I:299;131;I was totally apalled (in a good way) with Reed's and Wood's amazing performences as two troubled teenage girls.
I:299;132;now my favorite part of the movie.
I:299;133;What you see is real .
I:299;134;For many of you who don't know, Nikki Reed, one of the co. writers, based the main character (played by Wood), on the true life of herself before finally getting help.
I:299;135;I watched this movie with my 13 year old daughter and we both cried by the end.
I:299;136;It helped her realize just what kind of people are out there in the world.
I:299;137;it touched on some true to life experiences, would recommend mothers watch this with their daughters who are middle school aged and up.
I:299;138;the main point of this film is the things the two girls go through which is shocking and intense that you have to watch it more then twice to truly understand each detail.
I:299;139;I always loved this movie and when I saw it on here I knew it was a must have so I ordered it right on the spot, still haven't recieved it but im calmly waiting :) and who says a teenager can't have an opinion
I:299;140;This movie is pretty incredible.
I:299;141;It kept me interested the entire time.
I:299;142;and continues with an unrelenting aggressiveness until its penultimate, quiet moment.
I:299;143;the frenzied camera work, the digitized color, the pounding soundtrack.
I:299;144;Her performance is raw and scary.
I:299;145;And Holly Hunter, a reliable veteran, delivers the goods as well as Tracy's mom.
I:299;146;down with Tracy is one of the most affecting coups de theatre I saw this year.
I:299;147;it's too obvious and stylized and blunts the effects of the film's realistic approach.
I:299;148;"First the good, ""Thirteen"" is a well acted horror of a story."
I:299;149;A friendship is made and over the course of the next four months and the girls end up using each other to their own self.
I:299;150;It's an interesting spiral to watch, the characters are well written and the situations do feel real (this in part to Nikki Reed's own experience as a teenager which she interjected into the script as co. author).
I:299;151;In the film, Tracy's mom (Holly Hunter) has a hard time finding a line to draw for her daughter, which is heartbreakingly accurate, but the movie never provides us with a solution.
I:299;152;"Thirteen is a good movie
I:299;153;I definitely recommend keeping this away from teenagers or younger and I don't think anyone really needs to watch it unless you have some unrealistic view of teenage years that they aren't difficult already.
I:299;154;Very compelling and realistic story.
I:299;155;So i wasnt sure if they even enjoyed the movie.
I:299;156;good movie though, suggest to teens and anyone who struggles or is interested in peer pressure, losing/making friends, drugs and/or self harm, illegal activites, and more.
I:299;157;"By the time I turned 13 a few months later, I had lived much of ""Thirteen""s storyline."
I:299;158;I was silently riveted by this movie every second, because every single element was perfectly real, just the sort of feeling I remember.
I:299;159;the truth is, this film is real, as perfectly real as it gets, especially for me.
I:299;160;This is a real story.
I:299;161;in any case, this is a wonderful film.
I:299;162;Evan Rachel Wood is astonishingly raw and I love her for that.
I:299;163;I have lived her life, and it's an awful life to live.
I:299;164;I felt that this movie was perfectly portrayed overall.
I:299;165;This was a wonderful movie, and I highly recommend it to everyone.
I:299;166;Catherine Hardwicke is red hot right now due to her direction of Twilight, which is a huge block buster with box office receipts that guarantee a sequel.
I:299;167;She discovered the vampire novels of Stephenie Meyers through her younger pals, and at a book signing she saw immediately the strong reaction and fan loyalty the books engendered.
I:299;168;two of Catherine's other films also benefited from her ability to see the world from the younger point.
I:299;169;"view: The Lords of Dogtown
I:299;170;Dogtown was a great film about the skate scene.
I:299;171;I can't feel anything, this is awesome!
I:299;172;Holly Hunter was Helen Remington [NOT the 2004 Oscar winner, the one with James Spader]Stealing Beauty(1996) .
I:299;173;tracy: Mothers, lock up your sons!
I:299;174;The only thing this movie is worth seeing if because of Evan Rachel Wood (Who I think should've had stayed Rachel Wood) and Holly Hunter's perfect performances.
I:299;175;A character like Tracy often gets a child actress who makes too many facial expresions for her own good, but this time, they got a real actress (not child actress) who can deliver lines alongside the great Holly Hunter.
I:299;176;I'll just say she's magnificent.
I:299;177;the script was well written, portraying how real teenage girls talk.
I:299;178;Thirteen is one of the best films I have ever seen in my life.
I:299;179;Tracy is a normal girl with normal friends and plays out the role of a good girl.
I:299;180;She begins to steal clothes,money and many other things.
I:299;181;This film is very touching and has a surprising ending.
I:299;182;The movie shows you what can happen to you and how you can become out of controll if you chose the wronge crowd.
I:299;183;I could watch this movie all day and it will have a great affect on me.
I:299;184;It is truley a wonderful film that everyone should see.
I:299;185;I found this movie to be a realistic portrayal of two girls with a lot of problems.
I:299;186;She is sympathetic because she has mental problems, family problems, and bad friends.
I:299;187;In contrast, her mother, mother's boyfriend, and her mother's ex.
I:299;188;Holly Hunter is good, as always, but her character seemed too fake and was not well drawn.
I:299;189;pass on this one if something else catches your eye.
I:299;190;I actually watched the 1979 movie Foxes right after this.
I:299;191;I hadn't planned on it, but after watching this I needed an antidote to it and I thought Foxes would be perfect for that.
I:299;192;Let's get back to life, please.
I:299;193;this movie is sooooo good it is one of my fav movies.
I:299;194;nikki and evan were so good in the movie, they were really in character.
I:299;195;its amazing to think this was a budget film.
I:299;196;I truely believe this movie is a great one.
I:299;197;Anyone who like a good story, this is the movie for you.
I:299;198;I feel like i connected with it personally because it reminds me alot of what myself and a friend got into last year.
I:299;199;Thirteen is a good movie, not great.
I:299;200;Wood has the best acting in the whole movie.
I:299;201;It gets a little gory at some parts, but it's still real.
I:299;202;Teens gone wild,good movie hope my daughter dosent turn out like this
I:299;203;At the beginning, I thought this movie progressed really well.
I:299;204;good lord, what a groan.
I:299;205;but the power of the three lead performances should stun you.
I:299;206;Her mother (Holly Hunter) is loving.
I:299;207;the three lead actors are outstanding.
I:299;208;Evan Rachel Wood captures the heartbreak and the brutality of being thirteen: one minute you're a little girl, the next Lolita.
I:299;209;Holly Hunter captures a mother in denial beautifully.
I:299;210;She knows but she doesn't know.
I:299;211;i would recommend this movie to individuals who gravitate towards serious, art films.
I:299;212;Being a teenager (still) and watching Thirteen was more than great.
I:299;213;My mom actually brought me to see it and we both enjoyed it and had lots of questions for each other.
I:299;214;"i recommend this to everyone
I:299;215;it's better to be aware than to not know.
I:299;216;one of the most disturbingly real films I've ever seen.
I:299;217;Tracy makes changes to finally fit in, to finally feel accepted.
I:299;218;You can see the difference in the two girls, Tracy being the girl who takes for granted the love she has and Evie being the girl that longs to have that kind of love.
I:299;219;melanie to me is the most interesting character, for she's not the perfect mother but she tries, she struggles to make the right decisions and she beats herself up for the wrong ones she makes.
I:299;220;She's selfless and devoted yet she always seems to come up short in the eyes of her daughter.
I:299;221;Holly Hunter does and extraordinary job of playing the tortured mother, battling with her demons both self inflicted and those brought on by the ones around her.
I:299;222;The performances by the entire cast are amazing, Wood, Hunter and Reed bringing grit and truism to this modern day masterpiece.
I:299;223;Woods performance in particular is pure brilliance, transitioning from a sweet and innocent girl suffering from naivety to a cruel and heartless girl suffering from naivety almost effortlessly.
I:299;224;This film will startle you but hopefully it will open your eyes to the problems and issues that really do exist and help us take notice of the dangers facing our youths.
I:299;225;Disheartening and beautifully done, Reed has proven to be a convincing writer and actress, and Catherine Hardwicke handles this film with the proper balance of care and caution delivering one of the most powerfully moving movie experiences to come along in recent years.
I:299;226;but, with confidence, i assert that every young person in America, every old person, and everyone who would not put themselves in one of these categories should see Thirteen, for the same reasons they should see Requiem for a Dream.
I:299;227;Likewise, I saw Thirteen today.
I:299;228;This film, FILM, bears notice as an outstanding screenplay, which penetrates to the heart of an outsider's desire to Fit In.
I:299;229;An honor student, like so many of us were.
I:299;230;She wins it through a single unethical act.
I:299;231;Tracy balances the karmic scale: she pierces her navel as a reaction to her mother's boyfriend, a former addict and a parolee.
I:299;232;mason's reaction to Evie, in particular, gives another dimension to this story.
I:299;233;"In the beginning, he delights in her
I:299;234;of the many, many remarkable aspects of this screenplay .
I:299;235;to recap, its truth, its genuineness.
I:299;236;most remarkable, it was written by Nikki Reed, whom viewers will know only as Evie.
I:299;237;fantastic storytelling and honest performances.
I:299;238;I'll grant the good reviewers that their are some amazing actors and actresses in this movie.
I:299;239;It is the screenplay itself I found a little, well, ummm.
I:299;240;While I'm sure the director was sincere in her effort to make an realistic movie about today's teenagers .
I:299;241;Holly Hunter is such a great actress, that I love everything she does.
I:299;242;"Evan Rachel Wood complimented Holly Hunter well
I:299;243;"as a screenplay writer and author, I found this movie to be a sincere effort at making a film about today's teenager
I:299;244;"I hope people who loved this movie are not too mad at me for any criticism I have for this movie
I:299;245;the same way the director has to make the film she wants.
I:299;246;abandoning her friends, Tracy (superbly portrayed by Evan Rachel Wood) befriends one of the popular girls, Evie (played with finesse by Nikki Reed).
I:299;247;holly Hunter, as Tracy's mother, is outstanding.
I:299;248;"Everybody is perfectly cast
I:299;249;"This is not a film for the squeamish
I:299;250;"It's gritty, it's engaging, and it's real.you may flinch, you may cry, you may gasp ""oh my God!"""
I:299;251;, but you'll come away with a sense that you've been in the mind of a troubled teenage girl, and are the better for it.
I:299;252;It stayed with me for weeks as a true work of art: scary, exhilarating and infuriating at the same time.
I:299;253;An incredible soundtrack is just another reason to check this out.
I:299;254;Aside from some questionable brown stuff on the case and disc, it works fine.
I:299;255;What is so gripping is the causal realities of expressed in this film: damaged people who inflict their wounds on their youngsters through apathy, divorce, and drug and alcohol addiction.
I:299;256;You can see why each of them are drawn both to each other and to the world they inhabit and it feels more like a documentary than a film.
I:299;257;Holly Hunter is brilliant as Tracy's Mom having to capture the character of a recovering alcoholic who's life is in turmoil without ever going for the TV movie of the week tear jerker.
I:299;258;I guarantee it for I did!
I:299;259;Thirteen is a highly intense drama worthy of watching.
I:299;260;The hardhitting scenes in this wrongfully underrated movie keep everything realistic looking and keep audiences eyes wide open.
I:299;261;Its daring theme earns the cast and crew trememdous respect for graphically exploring what few other moviemakers have.
I:299;262;This brilliant plot is loosely based on actress Nikki Reed's, who plays Evie, life.
I:299;263;Evan Rachel Wood's Golden Globe nominated (Best Actress) performance proves that she's one of the few child actors with talent.
I:299;264;Her intensity shines in every scene.
I:299;265;Holly Hunter's Oscar nominated performance (Best Supporting Acress) is one of her best roles in years.
I:299;266;She beautifully desplicts the stresses and turbulances as Tracy's mother struggling to keep her family together.
I:299;267;All other actors also perform their roles wonderfully.
I:299;268;Thirteen is a great movie for those looking for heartpounding drama.
I:299;269;This will surely please many audiences.
I:299;270;The film is very good at chronicling the boys, the drugs and the stealing, but I felt that it was a bit slim in showing what motivated Tracy to star down that path.
I:299;271;I realize that fitting in and being popular is of vital importance at that age, but I wanted to the movie to make me really feel that need rather than rely on my own memories of it.
I:299;272;Holly Hunter turns in a powerful, raw performance as Tracy's mother.
I:299;273;i really appreciated her story more than that of the girls.
I:299;274;office appeal, just utterly committed storytelling as authentic and chilling as BOYZ N THE HOOD and MI VIDA LOCA.
I:299;275;Yet as good as Hunter and Reed are, this is Wood's movie, and she all but steals the show with the gutsiest, most accomplished performance by a young teen actress that I can recall.
I:299;276;(I suspect that only the MPAA's squeamishness about the subject matter kept Wood from an Oscar nomination of her own.)
I:299;277;All the supporting actors give remarkably fine performances, too, especially Brady Corbett as Tracy's older brother, Mason, and Deborah Kara Unger as Evie's out.
I:299;278;our society often neglects what's best for our kids for fear of offending them or those who prey upon them.
I:299;279;In short, THIRTEEN is a gutsy and very accomplished film about something that really matters.
I:299;280;I'd give it 4 1/2 stars if permitted, but given the choice Amazon allows, let's make it an even 5.
I:299;281;The very concept of delayed gratification is utterly alien to her.
I:299;282;The opposite is true for Tracy (Evan Rachel Wood), a shy girl who earns good grades.
I:299;283;Her mother Melanie (Holly Hunter) is divorced from a man who has opted for a solidly middle class life.
I:299;284;Evie is considered to be the most popular girl at school, and Tracy wants to join her inner circle.
I:299;285;Oh well, Hardwicke still directed a first rate production.
I:299;286;She easily earns five stars for her efforts.
I:299;287;This is a real eye opener to young girls about the dangers of peer pressure and to moms about keeping communication open.
I:299;288;Watch before allowing young girls to watch.
I:299;289;Certainly an R rated movie for good reason.
I:299;290;i didn't like it but it was good.
I:299;291;the movie is a tale of a junior high school age chick (13.
I:299;292;the thing that really impressed me about this flick was the acting of the main girl.
I:299;293;holly hunter is always good and the bad friend was good as well.
I:299;294;thirteen is the one that really got me!
I:299;295;It broke my heart, and scared the hell out of me!
I:299;296;I have a daughter (17) and this is real!
I:299;297;nikki Reed is an amazing talent( recognized form Lords of Dogtown and Cherry Crush) wow!!!
I:299;298;This girl has it in a sexy way.young but extremely sexy in her roles.
I:299;299;This is a real look into the world of teen girls gone to the other side.
I:299;300;this is a movie for every dad and mom to watch and breathe in.
I:299;301;This is an excellent independent film with glowing performances from the entire cast.
I:299;302;But there are two, in particular, that drive this unnerving film home.
I:299;303;Evan Rachel Wood, in an auspicious performance, gives a powerful turn as a 13.
I:299;304;Her acting alone is reason enough to see this, but then Holly Hunter matches her scene for scene with a subtle, extraordinary performance.
I:299;305;On a personal note, this film provoked memories of alcohol abuse in my own family, making it all the more striking.
I:299;306;This is an unnerving film with good acting and a thought.
I:299;307;In junior high girls often feel the pressure to fit in and be popular and that often leads them to hanging with the wrong crowd.
I:299;308;For one, the main character during her transition to the dark side showed very little hesitation to trying new things, things just came a bit to easy for me to find it believable at times.
I:299;309;See angelic, thoughtful young Tracy trying to fit in with the cool kids.
I:299;310;See Tracy change her style from sweet to suggestive.
I:299;311;See Tracy drink and do drugs.
I:299;312;See Tracy terrorize her mother.
I:299;313;See Tracy's whole life start to unravel.
I:299;314;income enviroment as a hair stylist.
I:299;315;Evie and Tracy were beautiful girls who just had circumstances where they felt love wasn't enough.
I:299;316;As Tracy and Evie become closer friends, Evie makes up lies about her past in order to stay at Tracy's house and win over her family.
I:299;317;Wood plays her part so well that I wondered if she had experiences similar to those in the film.
I:299;318;It was equally impressive to read that it was written in such a short time period because the characters are very well developed.
I:299;319;Overall, it is an extremely impressive feat and worth a viewing.
I:299;320;"winning script, but certainly it might be more realistic than one written by an adult, and this is what we are asked to believe about ""Thirteen,"" which garnered many more awards than ""Leland""."
I:299;321;"I found the two films to be nearly equally entertaining, and they also resemble a third film ""Elephant""."
I:299;322;Thirteen has excellent cinematography,following the two teenage female leads around so closely we get to know them at ground level, so to speak.
I:299;323;Holly Hunter is also excellent as the sympathetic mom with a deadbeat boyfriend who is somewhat suspicious of her child's illegal activities but still wants to give her plenty of room to be herself.
I:299;324;based cinematography a bit hard to take.
I:299;325;I was excepting more realistic things in the movie, but as a story line, it was really good.
I:299;326;There were good parts in it, and some so.
I:299;327;While it tackles a rough and very real subject, there are ultimately only 2 reasons to watch this film: Wood's and Oscar Nominee Hunter's performances.
I:299;328;Hunter is utterly heartbreaking in her performance, and although she does not deserve to win the Oscar for THIS movie,( that honor should go to Patricia Clarkson)she definitely deserved the recognition.
I:299;329;I love this movie and use it when I teach child or adolescent psychology at the local University.
I:299;330;even though it is nearly ten years old it portrays many issues that make for prime discussion.
I:299;331;It was a really good movie but sad.
I:299;332;Very good movie, it came in perfect condition.
I:299;333;My daughter remembered this movie!
I:299;334;She is enjoying this movie.
I:299;335;I love this movie so much, and even though I never acted the way they did when I was thirteen I can still relate to it because I knew girls who did.
I:299;336;The movie, Thirteen, was very intense not only because of the subject of drugs, sex and stealing, but you could really get into the story.
I:299;337;Definatley worth watching in my opinion!
I:299;338;yet I found this movie amazingly profound, very disturbing and way to intense.
I:299;339;I remember thinking it was pretty cool.
I:299;340;I remember the angst that this movie portrays of what it was like to be 13.
I:299;341;I was a teenage guy, but I can still remember the mindset that we all subscribed to back then, and this is it.
I:299;342;"Stealing was considered ""cool"" and nobody wanted to be thought of as ""faggot"" or ""fudgepacker""."
I:299;343;"Life is still hard in being a teenager and the pressure to be part of the ""in crowd"" is still very great."
I:299;344;com, and the actor who portrayed the neighbor is Kip Pardue, born in 1976.
I:299;345;Evan Rachel was born in '87, Reed in '88.
I:299;346;"She leaves to ""use the restroom"" but the cut part of the scene is when her brother (played by Brady Corbet) catches her in the hallway, and wraps his arms around his sister
I:299;347;Which is exactly what is accomplished here, giving the audience a dark feel, and have their emotions run with each scene.
I:299;348;over all, wonderful, and touching film.
I:299;349;Evan Rachel Wood plays Tracy, a good girl and good student who wants to gain popularity and to fit in, not to mention rebel against her mother.
I:299;350;I got involved with drugs, alcohol, lies, sex, and all I ever did was want more.
I:299;351;This movie is extremely realistic, despite what others are saying.
I:299;352;This movie was an excellent potrail of being a teenager.
I:299;353;Also as a student film maker, I loved what they did with the color.
I:299;354;The way they pulled out the color at the end was perfect.
I:299;355;Also the way it was filmed (shaky and jerky) was excellent to give the audience cooler perscpective.
I:299;356;The use of dark colors is beautiful and gives you the feel of watching a home movie almost.
I:299;357;The underlying emotion and attitude was so strong that I could tell right away that it was going to have a profound message.
I:299;358;I was compelled to watch it.
I:299;359;it was astonishing in its honesty.
I:299;360;So many things about both of the girls struck a chord with me.
I:299;361;I think it would be a really good idea to watch and discuss it with your kids.
I:299;362;This is a positive review, I thought Thirteen was a very good film.
I:299;363;It is a testament to the film that the material rings so true as to elicit such feelings.
I:299;364;The story of Tracy and her family is so visceral and genuine that one is instantly transformed back to early post puberty and the horribly uncomfortable issues that were part and parcel of the experience.
I:299;365;modern family ferociously spiral into a decent tempered only by it's brevity.
I:299;366;There are very few good feelings within this movie but oddly you do feel better for going through it.
I:299;367;I guess that is really the ultimate and fitting compliment for the filmmakers that they have managed to take the audience through the emotions that are the beginning of the teenage years.
I:299;368;Few films I know have had this much emotional impact.
I:299;369;this movie is harrowing and nasty but incredibly realistic and true to real life.
I:299;370;With that being said the movie itself was pretty powerful and I thought well acted Evan Rachel Wood (Tracy) and Nikki Reed did a remarkable job of portraying dirty, trashy and down right slutty teenagers, and Holly Hunter did a great job of playing a confused mother who refused to take charge of her daughter's behavior.
I:299;371;for those who refuse to believe this is realistic need to open your eyes because it could be your son or daughter acting this way without you realizing it.
I:299;372;This movie shows what happens in the real world all the time.
I:299;373;The movie has great acting as well as a great message to be deliverd.
I:299;374;It really gets it's message across.
I:299;375;The movie pulls you in right from the begining and will keep you hooked to the end.
I:299;376;A decent movie if u want to get to know what average teenage american girls can get into according to Hollywood.
I:299;377;It is believable in most parts, pathetic and unrealistic trash in others but very watchable if u have the time.
I:299;378;I give the movie two stars instead of one because the directing and cinematography are very good.
I:299;379;the rest of the movie deserves one star.
I:299;380;In this way, the movie attempts to evoke a variety of emotions, through shock value, with each scene more outrageous than the last.
I:299;381;"An enticing and relevant indie effort, ""Thirteen"" stands as a pleasant surprise and a peculiar teen movie."
I:299;382;old girl (the impressive Evan Rachel Wood, from the TV.
I:299;383;"show ""Once and Again"") who suddently begins exploring her darker side isn`t grounbreaking material, yet suceeds as a compelling effort nonetheless."
I:299;384;director Chaterine Hardwicke offers an intriguing debut oeuvre, one that dares to take a deep and risky look at today`s teenagers.
I:299;385;Thirteen presents a strong and vivid visual style, full of energy and dynamism and somewhat reminiscent of MTV.
I:299;386;The direction also offers a documentary.
I:299;387;eyed perspective with enough ambiguity and depth.
I:299;388;The movie`s pacing is well.
I:299;389;balanced and the powerful soundtrack adds a vital sense of rythm and confusion.
I:299;390;The performances are noteworthy as well, especially Holly Hunter as a young and worried mother who doesn`t know how to react to her daughter`s behaviour.
I:299;391;I haven't seen this movie in a long time and it is just as amazing as ever.
I:299;392;THIRTEEN is a wrenching look at what is happening, at least in some arenas, to adolescents in our stressed society today.
I:299;393;The language is raw, the drug scenes are realistic, and the sex scenes are gratefully fogged over by the fine cinematographer using the blur effect to tell much more than playing actual witness could show.
I:299;394;This is a very fine, though very tough to watch, film about a real problem that surrounds us.
I:299;395;Much of this is due to the fine direction by Catherine Hardwicke, but the power comes from extraordinary performances Evan Rachel Wood (why did the Academy single out Keisha Castle.
I:299;396;, Holly Hunter, Nikki Reed, Jeremy Sisto, Deborah Unger (becoming one of the finer character actors around), and all the cast.
I:299;397;Kudos to those who had the courage to make this film and bring a mirror up close for us to see the cracks.
I:299;398;Holly Hunter and the girls are amazing in this.
I:299;399;Great movie to show in Psych Adolescent Development course in college.
I:299;400;if you want to see kids engaged in physical love, here's your chance.
I:299;401;well, for me it ended about 45 minutes after the movie started.
I:299;402;all said and done, this is well made and worth looking at.
I:299;403;Thirteen is probably one of the more depressing films I've seen in my lifetime, but strangely enough, I found it quite enjoyable.
I:299;404;many reviews of this film complain about its sexual content.
I:299;405;altogether, Thirteen is definitely worth seeing.
I:299;406;It's a great movie for all you melodramatic, melancholy personality types who enjoy being depressed sometimes.
I:299;407;Not a movie for kids, but I love the detail.
I:299;408;She also makes necessary ones albeit with an adolescent lack of tact.
I:299;409;She'll probably still want to keep her bedroom door closed.
I:299;410;She'll want to shop on Melrose Place without an accompanying adult.
I:299;411;Thirteen is unsparing in this regard.
I:299;412;Holly Hunter does a magnificent job as a mother who suddenly finds herself without any connection to or authority over her child.
I:299;413;"There is one particularly tragic moment when Hunter plaintively reminds her daughter that ""I raised you to be civil to me!"
I:299;414;This movie was amazing, true, and eye.
I:299;415;This is what happens in real life and it is all real.
I:299;416;This is the best realistic movie about teenage girls that I have ever seen in my life!
I:299;417;"The cinematography is amazing
I:299;418;it is just great and it is truely my favorite movie ever!
I:299;419;The events that take place in the movie, watching it almost seems surreal, like you understand that the events are very likely, making them unlikely.
I:299;420;it was interesting and moving and all, but no one ounce of real in it.
I:299;421;As we all know, 13 is a tender age.
I:299;422;If you're sensitive about blood, drugs, sex, and of that nature, this film will be a bit much.
I:299;423;This was a raw, yet insightful look at a teen girl who slips through the cracks and follows her new friend into the world of drugs and sex at only thirteen years old.
I:299;424;Overall, I enjoyed this film, and recommend it to anyone who wants a look into a troubled girls young life
I:299;425;It is amazing that a young person wrote this movie!
I:299;426;The story is truthful and frightening.
I:299;427;rachel Evan Wood is frankly amazing as is Holly Hunter.
I:299;428;It was targeted as something you should watch with your teenagers.
I:299;429;There is more going on than an out of control teen.
I:299;430;because it is great, and everyone should watch this movie.
I:299;431;Although this movie had some amazing performances by the two young female stars, the story line was far from being a ground breaking peace of art.
I:299;432;Actually at times I thought I was watching a 21st century's version of an after school special.
I:299;433;Both of the young girl characters as well as the rest of the family portray a family that is lost in transition perfectly.
I:299;434;I just thought it would shine some light on the subject of teen cutting and self absorbtion and destruction.
I:299;435;The shock value is for those that only have their heads underground, pretending that life is wonderful.
I:299;436;It's a great entertaining movie but also a movie that only sticks to telling America what it already knows, if you don't gain control over your children at a young age, they will gain control over you .
I:299;437;Thirteen exhibits teenage life perfectly.
I:299;438;Every second of this film plays out the real.
I:299;439;life feelings, desires, and attitudes of a teenager.
I:299;440;Evan Rachel Wood does a fantastic job of portraying Tracy, and deserved her Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress.
I:299;441;She also deserved her Golden Globe AND Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress.
I:299;442;Her script is sheer brilliance and is ultimately an eye.
I:299;443;And last but not least, Catherine Hardwicke does a great job of directing, and the use of only a digital camera makes the film seem so much more real.
I:299;444;Why do teens have to feel accepted by the popular kids to live and feel happy.
I:299;445;This film is riveting, and very very effective in all ways.
I:299;446;This really does happen to many teens everywhere.
I:299;447;To everyone reading this: Give this movie a try.
I:299;448;It will definetely haunt you with it's beauty for days!
I:299;449;this is a great movie to show teenage girls.
I:299;450;But I found myself holding my breath the entire time having to remember to breathe.
I:299;451;This is based on a lot of factual issues kids deal with everyday in this area of New York.
I:299;452;Acting is average and certainly very watchable.
I:299;453;It's funny how accurate this movie was to my life.
I:299;454;I was the unpopular girl and I became friends with this popular girl.
I:299;455;She turned me to drugs and the wilder way of life.
I:299;456;And I won't deny it, I had SO much fun.
I:299;457;This is my all time favorite movie.
I:299;458;I watched and bought this movie in my younger days, and just recently watched it again at 30, and I was quite surprised that I even bought this movie.
I:299;459;In some respects, it does portray a realistic sense of what it feels like to be 13 .
I:299;460;holly Hunter plays an outstanding single mother in this movie.
I:299;461;I thought this movie was fantastic.
I:299;462;I'm 33 and never had a wild period like these girls, but still found it captivating.
I:299;463;I agree that having the girls be 14 or 15 may have been a more believable choice, but the female teenage angst is raw and palpable in this film either way.
I:299;464;I thought the acting was brilliant and the desaturated scenes added a lot to the feel of the movie.
I:299;465;this is a great movie, that takes upo more than one important subject.
I:299;466;out, so well made that you sometimes can be tricked into thinking it's REAL.
I:299;467;and the acting is: well no words for it, it's t5hat good.
I:299;468;Wood and Hunter is amazing.
I:299;469;I have yet to see, however, any shows dealing with snarky senior citizens.
I:299;470;"Anyway, ""Teens gone wild"" has seen a surge of movies, documentaries, and assorted television programs in recent years."
I:299;471;"Larry Clark's ""Kids"" and ""Bully"" helped kick off the craze."
I:299;472;tracy (Evan Rachel Wood) is a beautiful young girl who lives in a rather chaotic environment.
I:299;473;She longs to hang out with the popular crowd, which in this case means the clique headed up by the vivacious Evie (Nikki Reed).
I:299;474;she's certainly an attractive young lady with an outgoing personality, but her attire and her manner reek of decadence.
I:299;475;An opportunity for Tracy to transcend her social status arrives on the heels of a snub.
I:299;476;Evie and a friend spurn Tracy's attempts to form a relationship at a local department store, so our girl promptly steals a lady's wallet outside and returns flush with cash.
I:299;477;The girls go on a spending spree, and from this point on Tracy and Evie are inseparable.
I:299;478;"The conclusion to ""Thirteen"" is slightly enigmatic and offers few concrete answers to these questions."
I:299;479;Thirteen is often a traumatic movie to watch.
I:299;480;Seeing kids of such tender years take part in sordid activities isn't the sort of thing most people like to witness, and the film pulls few punches in its portrayal of such activities.
I:299;481;Holly Hunter, a woman who simply looks better and better the older she gets, does a great job playing the put upon Melanie.
I:299;482;She goes through stages of depression, despair, anger, and denial while trying to deal with her wayward daughter, and does so convincingly.
I:299;483;Evan Rachel Wood and Nikki Reed bring a lot to their respective parts, both tearing up the screen as teens wildly and shockingly out of control.
I:299;484;"Realistic, raw, unnerving, and likely destined to become some sort of cult classic, ""Thirteen"" is a worthy addition to the ""Teens gone wild"" canon I spoke of earlier."
I:299;485;I liked this movie because it dealt with a side of adolescence I knew little to nothing about when I was a similar age, namely what it's like to be a teenage girl.
I:299;486;After watching this film, though, I can safely say I'm happy I don't have kids.
I:299;487;I love love love this movie.
I:299;488;I recommend this to anyone.
I:299;489;It is extremely well acted and the cast could not have been better.
I:299;490;see for anyone who wants to see a slice of real life.
I:299;491;Well I seriously felt like this movie was real.
I:299;492;It is one of the BEST movies of the year.
I:299;493;Evan Rachel Wood deserves an Oscar for her harrowing performance as Tracy, Holly Hunter is better than I have ever seen her, and Nikki Reed is inspiringly truthful in both her writing and her performance as a character she had not intended to play.
I:299;494;The acting in this movie was some of the best I've seen from this cast.
I:299;495;There's still a small bit of light fighting against the darkness in her head, in her mind.
I:299;496;By this time the real Tracy is starting to break.
I:299;497;**************************************************************************Anyways, after watching this there are some of the best performances, scenes and shots I've seen.
I:299;498;She absolutely nailed the manipulative attitude of Evie, while also making the viewer like her.
I:299;499;Holly Hunter's absolutely blew me away and I can't think of a better performance than Hunter's.
I:299;500;Thirteen packs a whole lot into an hour and a half, and, for that matter, into one girl.
I:299;501;Well I can tell you from personal experience, it's VERY realistic.
I:299;502;I am a gay teen and even though I can't relate to these girls' story, I can tell you that my best friend in the entire world has gone through much of what these girls do in this film.
I:299;503;Some teens may really have a pretty healthy family life and might be comfortable with who they are, but most of them don't.
I:299;504;Her mom is played by Academy Award Winning Actress Holly Hunter who is superb in her part.
I:299;505;I loved how Evie so desperately wanted Tracy's mom to adopt her.
I:299;506;the story is just so moving and really gives the viewer a look into what really goes on with teens today.
I:299;507;I also loved how the media presence could be felt and seen throughout the entire film, especially those glamourized eyes.
I:299;508;with that said, I think this movie is THE most realistic portrayal of teen life that I've ever seen.
I:299;509;The menu is set up beautifully and the special features are great also.
I:299;510;"writer, the theatrical trailer, and the featurette ""The Making Of Thirteen"" which has great interviews with the cast of the film."
I:299;511;This is a must see for everyone.
I:299;512;And there's no happy ending, giving everyone an easy solution.
I:299;513;I thought it was going to be a fun look at the life of a teenager, but reality hit home and it showed how much struggle life is!
I:299;514;Hunter and Wood portray the most realistic mother.
I:299;515;daughter dynamic of modern cinema.
I:299;516;She managed to win over the mom, to play herself off as a victim of abuse, while she was actually the driving force ruining the daughter's life.
I:299;517;This film never once got boring it is one of the best films i have ever seen !
I:299;518;What so great about this film is that the actors dont make drugs, sex, etc. look fun it truely looks frightning and that sends out a message to all teens !
I:299;519;and even greater actors and message!
I:299;520;Evan rachel wood and Nikki Reed both give stunning performances in this dirty teen drama called thirteen.
I:299;521;One day Tracy meets this other trick named Evi, (Nikki reed) who is infact very hot and popular.
I:299;522;This is a good film.
I:299;523;It was a good idea to use females and see their perspective.
I:299;524;The movie gives you the feeling that your childrens' personalities change quiet a bit during puberty.
I:299;525;hill change is almost too quick to be believable, but it is chilling to the bone.
I:299;526;The mother of the young girl, played flawlessly by Holly Hunter, is an interesting character.
I:299;527;permissive but has a heart of gold, kind of an interesting combination.
I:299;528;It's very interesting to see how she deals with all the chaos surrouding her.
I:299;529;up call to what drugs and corruption can do to an innocent and curious teenage soul.
I:299;530;And let me tell you, I can believe this movie for its reality more than I can for its shock value.
I:299;531;There is a lot to talk about and a lot to explain.
I:299;532;i give Holly Hunter props as an actress in this movie as well.
I:299;533;Her character definitely had her problems, as do so many adults.
I:299;534;"I work with teenagers and the best way for me to describe many of them is with the word ""nutcases"", particularly the females who often will do whatever it takes to be considered socially relevant."
I:299;535;She loves her mother, Melanie (Holly Hunter), and listens to her.
I:299;536;We see her longing for a great social acceptance than what she has.
I:299;537;Evie (Nikki Reed) is one of the most popular girls in school, as well as the hottest (as described by Tracy's brother).
I:299;538;Melanie is a recovering alcoholic herself, but she is doing the best she can as a single mother.
I:299;539;She is all heart, and other than her relationship with the ex.
I:299;540;Despite that lack of explanation on Tracy's motivation, this movie is filled with realistic, powerful performances.
I:299;541;Evan Rachel Wood and Nikki Reed had absolutely standout roles and they both did a fine job.
I:299;542;What a debut (both in acting as well as screenwriting)!
I:299;543;"I thought ""Thirteen"" was a rather good movie even though it doesn't provide any answers nor does it provide a motivation for Tracy."
I:299;544;And that is a scary thought.
I:299;545;Good acting and interesting writing considering the age of the co. authors.
I:299;546;'Thirteen' is a movie I have wanting to see ever since I first heard about it on a group dedicated to Evan's films on Yahoo! Evan.
I:299;547;Finally I got to one of the cinemas it was playing at, and found it had just finished beingshown at that cinema.
I:299;548;That was an excellent movie.
I:299;549;All but two of the shots are hand held.
I:299;550;one of the images I thought was so effective is of Evan and NikkiReed sticking their tongues out showing off their tongue rings.
I:299;551;the music is also great.
I:299;552;Another film I really love with a slightly blue tinge colour to it is 'Crazy/Beautiful' with Kirsten Dunst.
I:299;553;'Thirteen's tagline 'They're not little girls anymore' is great.
I:299;554;"Totally compelling"" is exactly right."
I:299;555;When Evan's characterTracy cuts her wrists on several occasions during the film I think Evan was just so brave to do this movie.
I:299;556;Evan is a great girl I imagine, and it is hard to watch someone inflict what would be excruciating pain on themselves.
I:299;557;She has a long way to go yet.
I:299;558;spoiling one's body, and having to deal with major issues so young.
I:299;559;That's for sure, even though my year was quite good it's still hard for anyone.
I:299;560;It seems very real to me.
I:299;561;In astrange way it is now one of my favorite movies.
I:299;562;'Mean Girls' is another favorite movie of mine recently.
I:299;563;I liked this movie mainly because of the acting performances.
I:299;564;Holly Hunter is great as the mom who watches her daughter transform into a minion of hell.
I:299;565;Wood (Tracie) is great as the goody two shoes who turns to the dark side, and Reed (Evie) is great as the conniving, evil girl who seduces Wood.
I:299;566;Finally here are two beautiful scantilly.
I:299;567;"If you want't to see movies that are a bit more realistic watch ""Kids"" and ""Bully."""
I:299;568;another ode to teenaged suburban angst, but its done really well, and you believe them.
I:299;569;Thirteen is a very real movie, probably since the author of the movie was thirteen at the time she co. wrote it.
I:299;570;Definitely worth the time to watch just to see how friends and wanting to fit in can affect you.
I:299;571;I had been searching for this movie for quite a while and and now I'm very happy that I was able to find it it is just one of those movies
I:299;572;I'm surprised the director let this happen to such a great film.
I:299;573;I guess if you have gone through some of that stuff and have overcome that then I think it is a great movie for you.
I:299;574;I gave it three stars because it was original and came from the heart.
I:299;575;Wonderfully acted, you'll recognize many of the faces although it wasn't huge box office.
I:299;576;I watched it and loved it, and recommended it to my mom when she asked about movies she could show in her college class about adolescence.
I:299;577;She uses it every semester and loves it.
I:299;578;the acting is superb though.
I:299;579;the film was great!The story is very nice.
I:299;580;And Evan Rachel Wood is fantastic and beautiful, for a such young actress.
I:299;581;I know her work since Once and Again, and since than I became her fan.
I:299;582;when you're a teenager, you're in high school, that kind thing can happen to you.
I:299;583;whatch the film and enjoy the perfomeces of the actress and if you are in high school time, think twice before do something to be someone that you are not.
I:299;584;I know first hand how real this movie is.
I:299;585;This movie represents a lot of things in my life that I feel for.
I:299;586;It's was beautiful, and a very close movie to many of us teens.
I:299;587;this movie was amazing, wonderful, and brilliant, but above all it's my favorite.
I:299;588;Thirteen was generally a good, thought provoking film and did cover topics that teenagers do cope with today.
I:299;589;The acting was excellent and the use of colour was really interesting.
I:299;590;as a 16 year old female, i can relate to the problems the protagonist encountered and the actress was very convincing.
I:299;591;in conclusion i think that thirteen is a good movie which demonstrates many tramatic experiences teenages go through, which in turn may help raise awareness, but is slightly ott.
I:299;592;I would recommend this movie to all.
I:299;593;This is a movie that everyone needs to see.
I:299;594;It presents life as a teen in a realstic way, a way very few movies have captured.
I:299;595;Keep that in mind while you watch the movie, before it's over you'll be crying.
I:299;596;I really like that it is alot about Nikki Reed's real life and she is a great actress.
I:299;597;it makes it look like a happy, non.
I:299;598;dramatic movie about a couple girls just having a good time, which is exactly opposite of what it really is.
I:299;599;The movie is much, much deeper than that.
I:299;600;old) definitely brought this movie to life.
I:299;601;"Evan Rachel Wood was fantastic in the dramatic scenes, as well as Holly Hunter, and Nikki Reed was awesome playing the typical manipulative, ""slutty"" popular girl without a stable homelife."
I:299;602;watched it with a group of 12.18 year old girls and they all said it reflected the reality of being teenagers, with all the actual pressures and stresses of their high school and social lives.
I:299;603;This is, quite simply, one of the most honest (and painful) movies about adolescence that I've ever seen.
I:299;604;"so it makes sense that Tracy would be drawn to ""the coolest girl in school"", Evie, a wild rebel with a penchant for danger."
I:299;605;it is impressive that this film is so utterly believable and the sensational and often shocking scenes make sense in the context of Tracy and Evie's lives.
I:299;606;Adding to the strength of this film is Holly Hunter's strong performance as a mother who is desperate to save her daughter but isn't quite sharp enough to find the right path.
I:299;607;One of the best films of the year, bar none!
I:299;608;This was a great movie especially if you have teens in your life.
I:299;609;Much to my suprise, the movie is extremely moving and a perfect example of how a life can go so horribly wrong.
I:299;610;But other than that, I recommend this movie for all!
I:299;611;I have seen tons of reviews for this film and some say this movie is very realistic and a lot say it isn't.
I:299;612;I for one say that this movie is very real.
I:299;613;Thirteen shows the truth and no not all teens do this but a good percentage of them do.
I:299;614;The acting is sharp and the kids do look like they're thirteen.
I:299;615;It was a real bonding experience for my daughter and me.
I:299;616;tracy (Evan Rachel Wood) is one of those girls who dresses in clothes that are not in style and does well in her class works.
I:299;617;She is not popular and hangs out with those that are like her, and of course, she is envious of those girls who are popular with the boys.
I:299;618;Trying to gain their friendship, Tracy steals a ladies wallet and goes on a shopping spree with her new gal pals.
I:299;619;Tracy gets a whole new make out with provocative clothes and makeup and her life has completely turned upside down.
I:299;620;The film is trying to convince us of Tracys sins with piercing and revealing clothes.
I:299;621;She has a salon in her house and earns her living through it.
I:299;622;Tracy and Evie inhale, drink, sniffs, and smokes.
I:299;623;The movie opens with Tracy and Evie inhaling and punching and slapping each other with humor.
I:299;624;Now I have a teenage step daughter and she likes it too.
I:299;625;i found both lead girls fairly convincing as 15.
I:299;626;Very vivid, real life like, inside experiences, the actors did a good job at being 13.
I:299;627;This attention is something that Tracy perceives as positive, and something she would like to receive as well.
I:299;628;She is also ridiculed for the clothes she is wearing, which is hurting her self.
I:299;629;At home Tracy's mother (Holly Hunter) is more of a friend than a mother.
I:299;630;"Therefore, Tracy seeks out the ""cool"" girl, Evie, who offers Tracy the affection and care that she wants."
I:299;631;Thirteen is a strong film that can be compared to similar films such as Pixote (1981), Kids (1995), L. i. e. (2001), and City of God (2001), which all deal with children and teenagers that have been mislead onto a harmful path in the beginning of their lives.
I:299;632;In Thirteen, the cast brings out solid performances to the screen which colors the characters and enhances the realistic environment in which Tracy is growing up.
I:299;633;scene and the outstanding cinematography adds extra layers to the film that boosts the overall cinematic experience and it offers a solid cinematic experience to the audience as they can follow Tracy's struggles with growing up.
I:299;634;This movie was so real to me that I thought it was a biography.
I:299;635;The acting is the best I have ever seen, and the main girl is amazing.
I:299;636;Holly Hunter's performance as Melanie, an L. a. hairdresser and single mother of two, is gripping and surreal.
I:299;637;The two teenage girl characters, Evie and Tracy, are on a one.
I:299;638;what I think was most effective about this film is the fast.
I:299;639;Melanie's n'er do well friends who come and go out of her household are especially realistic, and her good intentions are strongly portrayed.
I:299;640;They are painful and true and their performances are definitely worthy of the acclaim that they have been receiving.
I:299;641;Kids before you think about drugs and having sex watch this movie and see what can happen to you.
I:299;642;I am on the path of recovery but its a hard path please dont follow it like I did!
I:299;643;good movie for anyone coming of age in today's society.
I:299;644;i feel this movie is a good example of what could happen to young teenagers if they start to hang with the wrong crowd.
I:299;645;It's a well scripted, well woven drama that tugs at the heart and the mind.
I:299;646;Very well done on both accounts.
I:299;647;I escpecially like the performance by Holly Hunter, who I felt, was very properly cast as the young girl's single mother.
I:299;648;And brought quite a bit of realism to the whole thing.
I:299;649;The acting on all the other fronts are quite good with the character of Tracy leading the pack.
I:299;650;the directing here has a very arthouse feel to it, which suits this movie just fine, I thought.
I:299;651;Overall, a very realistic and entertaining film about a chunk of these people's lives.
I:299;652;if you're into real life dramas with a volume of risque material, then you have found a winner.
I:299;653;Tracy meets Evie, the most popular girl in school and from there Tracy is put into a world she knows nothing about.
I:299;654;Evie even manipulates herself into Tracy's mother's life and the end result is nothing pretty.
I:299;655;This is a must see movie.
I:299;656;This is one of my all time favorite movies!I love how it shows how girls can turn at such a young age.
I:299;657;Wood is Tracy, a seventh grader who lives with her single mom (Holly Hunter), a hairdresser who works out of the home.
I:299;658;Hardwicke suggested Nikki keep a journal and intervened in the young girl's life, taking her to museums and exposing her to the larger world.
I:299;659;hardwicke won the Director's Award at the Sundance Film Festival, Hunter is up for an Oscar, and Wood was nominated for a Golden Globe.
I:299;660;Entertainment Weekly argued that Wood should receive serious consideration to become the youngest nominee the Best Actress Oscar in history and surprisingly that indeed happen this year, except that the nomination went to Keisha Castle.
I:299;661;Thirteen is a brutally honest film, the sort that you might never see again because once was enough, thank you very much.
I:299;662;The emotional conclusion is powerful, but I would not say it qualifies as being truly cathartic.
I:299;663;It really gives you a look inside a teenage mind.
I:299;664;It is a real eye opening movie.
I:299;665;I was shocked to find out that the movie was brave enough to explore its important topics.
I:299;666;definitly check out this movie.
I:299;667;She wants to befriend this girl, and does out of character things to achieve this goal.
I:299;668;American Beauty meets Kids meets Traffic.
I:299;669;The other young star is Evan Rachel Wood, who starts out as a well.
I:299;670;Their performances are so real that I cringed constantly, remembering my own early youth.
I:299;671;Some of these scenes between mother and daughter are heart wrenching and tributes to love.
I:299;672;This film packs a big punch.
I:299;673;the film is fast paced, the dialog is crisp and nasty, the settings absolutely realistic.
I:299;674;There's tension throughout and it never lets up.
I:299;675;I was completely swept into the story.
I:299;676;From buzz I picked up about Thirteen, and the smutty poster featuring two 'tweens flagrantly showing their tounge piercings, I believed it to be a documentary of the lives of two thirteen.year old girls.
I:299;677;"Tracey's mother, Melanie, is a ""cool"" mom with hippie tendencies."
I:299;678;Catherine Hardwicke did a fabulous job directing, and it is unusual that Nikki Reed (the 13 yr.
I:299;679;I don't know what is needed to heal these teens, but love and understanding is a good start.
I:299;680;this is a great movie that shows you that all actions have consequences.
I:299;681;"I see that some people have called this film, ""un."
I:299;682;It reminded me how scary those years can really be.
I:299;683;Its real and it happens even in the nicest suburbs.
I:299;684;the acting is phenomenal and is emotional intensity is high.
I:299;685;The cinematography is nice as well.
I:299;686;This movie is a great movie to show your teenage daughters because it gives them a look at what peer pressure can do to people.
I:299;687;This is my favorite movie as a lo and I still listen to this one thing she said on how if you drink 16oz of water you lose a number amount of calories
I:299;688;I am now 20 years old and this movie was almost a spitting image of my life growing up.
I:299;689;to me, I would still have enjoyed watching it because it was intense.
I:299;690;I believe that part was the truest of true.
I:299;691;All I have to say is this will change your life and the way you view young adults.
I:299;692;I'll have to say, Thirteen was one of the best movies I've seen in recent years.
I:299;693;The acting was so good, that at times, I swore it was real.
I:299;694;The storyline jumped around a little bit, and sometimes you really didn't know what was going on, but it all came together perfectly in the end.
I:299;695;This movie was moving and relevant.
I:299;696;As the title tags it, it's about being a thirteen year old girl and trying to fit in with a cool crowd.
I:299;697;The camera shot choices give it a documentary feel and the plot certainly comes across true enough.
I:299;698;Kudos to the director for keeping this movie focused.
I:299;699;A very honest movie that touched on what faces the teenagers of today and don't kid yourself that it's only those kids in CA or NY.
I:299;700;"Flashes of advertisements showing distorted images of sexuality and beauty were effective and the scenes of socialization could be updated ""Lord of the Flies""."
I:299;701;There were so many social issues that were touched upon that I give it good marks for effort.
I:299;702;I also liked the whole way it dealt with these issues.
I:299;703;It was a powerful piece until the very end where it all unraveled for me.
I:299;704;Everything in the film is for shock and awe value.
I:299;705;For them the transition period from child to young woman is an interesting, informative journey.
I:299;706;A form of madness sets in that affects not only themselves but their families and friends as well.
I:299;707;class suburban home with her mom, Melanie [Holly Hunter], and her slightly older brother, Mason [Brady Corbet].
I:299;708;It is important to note that.
I:299;709;Where it does succeed, it does so brilliantly.
I:299;710;It definitely gets points for being a brave little movie.
I:299;711;I have 3 Girls and it show them to not do drugs and the pressure of teenagers and the dangers of peer press it's a excellent movie i would recommmend it to others
I:299;712;The girls in this movie scare me, especially the scary way they look and act.
I:299;713;style of filming is not bad but I was sometimes reminded of 'Requiem of a Dream' which is more about drugs and a true masterpiece in 'real.
I:299;714;`Thirteen' is scarily graphic, and scarily realistic.
I:299;715;This is one of the rare films that can really draw you into the movie, and make you feel like you're involved in the film, instead of just watching from the comfort of your own home.
I:299;716;It's easy to guess from the title, that it's a story about a thirteen.year.
I:299;717;she didn't need much persuasion, and she really enjoyed it.
I:299;718;It makes you think a lot, especially when you're a person who has been nearly four years out of high school.
I:299;719;I know many girls from high school, that are now going about pushing prams, which is a scary thought.
I:299;720;But to watch this film, and see drugs, drinking, having underage sex, girls teaching each other to kiss, shoplifting, self.
I:299;721;holly Hunter is fantastic as Trace's mum, who can't stop her daughter going off the rails.
I:299;722;She's 46, and it must have taken a lot of guts to go almost full frontal in this film for her.
I:299;723;She's managed to keep herself in great shape for a 46.
I:299;724;old, but I couldn't do that!Some of the camera work is absolutely amazing, and some of the scenes are very well lit, especially when it's a very poignant or shocking scene, and sometimes they appear to be almost black and white.
I:299;725;What people don't understand is that people can come from a good background, and still go off the rails.
I:299;726;"This could have easily happened
I:299;727;watchable, despite being too realistic.
I:299;728;but i wouldnt recommend letting your girl watch this if she is younger than me
I:299;729;I remember hearing about this movie when it first came out and reading an interview with the creator Nikki Reed.
I:299;730;It was pretty realistic, yes this stuff does happen to *gasp* even thirteen year.
I:299;731;olds, I've seen it with my own two eyes.
I:299;732;But the thing is, the thirteen year.
I:299;733;One day Evie and her friend insult her, and the next day all Tracy has to do is wear cool clothes and suddenly Evie lets her hang out with her?
I:299;734;I personally love this film.
I:299;735;It shows the very real pressures today's youth faces as the amount of chemicals and prescriptions become more and more readily available.
I:299;736;Evan Rachel Wood's performance is definitely note worthy, while Nikki Reed, had a hand in writing most of the script as it was semi.
I:299;737;This movie is so real and so amazing.
I:299;738;The movie sends a good message, but it is also frightening to think that some teenagers get themselves into the same trouble as the girls in the movie do.
I:299;739;Holly Hunter and Evan Rachel Wood are excellent, especially Hunter as the mother who has to deal with her daughters transformation.
I:299;740;It has some pretty hard to chew in your face moments.
I:299;741;This is the most affecting tale of debauchery i've ever seen commited to film.
I:299;742;Anyone alive in the 1990s and aware of what went on in teenage life can identify with this film.
I:299;743;I saw this movie and I was impressed w/the acting.
I:299;744;I give the movie 1 star for Jeremy Sisto because he is kind of handsome, 1 star for the general acting, and the final star because it was refreshing to see a film where the kids wildin out were White (or was Evie Hispanic???)
I:299;745;Evie takes Tracy under her wing, and soon her world includes sex, drugs, violence and body piercing.
I:299;746;Catherine Hardwicke was a family friend who encouraged Reed to find creative, as opposed to destructive, outlets for her energy.
I:299;747;Nikki stars in the movie as well, very convincingly playing the slightly older, manipulative Evie.
I:299;748;Evan Rachel Wood is fantastic in the lead role.
I:299;749;Her performance as Tracy is one of the best of the 2003.
I:299;750;The film looks remarkably good for something that was shot in 24 days on a small budget, which is a credit to Catherine Hardwicke and the cast.
I:299;751;fact respect that I find refreshing.
I:299;752;The audio commentary features the comments of director Catherine Hardwicke, Evan Rachel Wood, Nikki Reed, and Brady Corbet, who plays Tracy's brother.
I:299;753;The commentary is fun, spontaneous and informative, although I found it difficult to distinguish Nikki Reed's and Evan Rachel Wood's voices.
I:299;754;Dubbing is available in French and Spanish.
I:299;755;So, this movie brought back a lot of memories.
I:299;756;this movie is a great conversation piece.
I:299;757;I would recommend it to you IF you have kids, and wonder what they think about.
I:299;758;This movie shows many of the things that a thirteen year old can/will face.
I:299;759;So she decides to steal a womans walet, and in doing so, creates a close relationship between Evie and herself.
I:299;760;The two leads (Wood and Reed) are note perfect.
I:299;761;tailed innocent to a pierced tortured young adult effortlessly.
I:299;762;This is an actress with range, and uses it fearlessly.
I:299;763;is scary as the seductive Evie.
I:299;764;i can't say it's a pleasant film to sit through, but it certainly is eye.
I:299;765;opening, wonderfully performed and ultimately unforgettable.
I:299;766;so, she slept with guys, did drugs, shop.
I:299;767;lifted, and wore slutty clothes.
I:299;768;I found nothing compelling about the characters and I wasn't the least bit invested in their outcome.
I:299;769;in fact, while watching, I found my attention wavering, quite a bit.
I:299;770;Evan portrays the role as Tracey, obviously a 13.
I:299;771;A surprise ending, and a movie that'll keep you at the edge of your seats.
I:299;772;the ruse of going to someone's house to spend the night always works.
I:299;773;it takes seeing a pattern before you wise up.
I:299;774;"its funny how the movie mirrored our own experiences.2 of my daughter's friends even tried the ""please let me move in with you"" routine."
I:299;775;This movie has to be about the most intense movie I have ever seen.
I:299;776;"n. roll(or in this case, hip hop) with ""shocking"" twists to make it seem edgy."
I:299;777;grade friends reflected in the characters of Tracey and Evie.
I:299;778;We have Tracey,blond and sweet(of course) and somewhat innocent but obviously more socialy advanced and wild than her tame book.
I:299;779;She befriends Evie,the wiser,expiranced one by stealing a woman's cash.
I:299;780;"As the plot slowly unfolds,we see that Evie is in love with Tracey in the rare and very subtle tender parts of the film and when Evie convinces Tracey to kiss her ""for practise"" it is obviously a seduction."
I:299;781;Evie wants to openly love and be in a relationship with Tracey and have Tracey's mother accept this so they could all live together as a rather unusual, but happy psedu.
I:299;782;family, something Evie never had.
I:299;783;All of her emotional damage, carefully revealed in the film, have made her so jaded that she cannot bring herself to trust anyone.
I:299;784;Everyone in this film is painfully hip and beautiful.
I:299;785;The acting was ok an I really got into it, but I didn't feel there was a real theme or message.
I:299;786;It's very sad that kids end up dead or pregnant or with std's, but those things can be prevented, if you're committed to your child, and you have the right techinques, and you actually love your kid.
I:299;787;And she goes back into school tomorrow and she makes friends with the popular Evie.
I:299;788;I would have to say that this is a good movie, if you are a teen.
I:299;789;When I first watched this movie it touched me in so many ways.
I:299;790;It's about time for people to see what's going on in this world.
I:299;791;This is a great movie and I highly reccomend it.
I:299;792;Drawing more than a few comparisons with Larry Clarke's Kids, Thirteen is actually a great deal more restrained and deals with the subject of burgeoning sexuality among thirteen year.
I:299;793;old girls in an extremely tasteful way.
I:299;794;up has Evan Rachel Wood becoming best buds with pretty popular Nikki Reed and before you know it she's dabbling in body piercing, boys and drugs.
I:299;795;Though it has some fantastic performances .
I:299;796;In addition, you can clearly tell Nikki Reed's hand in the scriptwriting process as the movie has a clear 'insider's perspective' feel to it.
I:299;797;Though it's certainly something you'll remember, it's no masterpiece, though this is something in itself compared to the unintelligent and unambitious films on offer most of the year round.
I:299;798;I love movies like this, movies that seem to have been created to spite the box office revenues on which the film industry depends for survival.
I:299;799;This is film for the sake of things other than box office, a brilliant exercise in scriptwriting and dramatic acting, a warm welcome to the talended Nikki Reed, and a great resum' builder for rising force Evan Rachel Wood, who has previously appeared in a fair number of Hollywood films but this time gets the key to the city in return for her efforts.
I:299;800;letter name by an older woman who's seen your type before and wasn't impressed, and how you can lie down and sleep next to someone who loves you but, eventually, you must wake up and deal with who you are and what you've made of your life.
I:299;801;I think she's the best actor I've ever seen in TV or movies.
I:299;802;Think about how bold that statement is.
I:299;803;"There is a timeless virtuosity to her best work, something that seems effortless yet conveys the ""fully."
I:299;804;old American girl who starred in 'Down Will Come Baby' is the greatest film and television actor of all time, and I'm trying really hard to think of one actor who is legitimately better, but I can't come up with anyone.
I:299;805;I treasure each powerful performance I've seen in the movies .
I:299;806;but to be so good over and over again is truly remarkable.
I:299;807;Wood brought me to tears in 'Thirteen,' and she did it at least four times in 'Once and Again.'
I:299;808;"For those who don't know of her, this film is a great introduction
I:299;809;for those who don't care who Evan Rachel Wood is, 'Thirteen' is a great film on its own merits.
I:299;810;*contains spoilers*The story really got to me.
I:299;811;13 year old Tracy wanted to fit in with the popular girls at school, most notably Evie.
I:299;812;She wanted to be adopted by Tracy's family.
I:299;813;She envied Tracy because she had the things she wanted (a mother, family love, etc).
I:299;814;Stuff like this is happening out there in real life and I really want to do something about it.
I:299;815;"if you liked this movie, you will like Ken Park's ""Kids"", which has a more grittier feel as opposed to Thirteen's Hollywood feel."
I:299;816;"Plus Kids is much more graphic, and if that was not enough for you, you should also watch ""Ken Park"""
I:299;817;"ths movie is mostly about a kid that wants to fit in wit the ""popular"" crowd."
I:299;818;This is about a 13 year old named Tracy she's sweet at the beginning.
I:299;819;As she befriends Evie the beautiful, popular girl.
I:299;820;She introduces drugs,sex,sneaking out and stealing to Tracy.
I:299;821;there are some pretty amazing performances here, top of which is turned in by Holly Hunter as a single mom divorcee, reformed addict trying desperately to hold herself and family together.
I:299;822;Her performance is honest, true, and entirely believable.
I:299;823;And now to the best performance that turned in by the it girl played by Nikki Reed.
I:299;824;Here's the catch and the amazing story behind thirteen.
I:299;825;"She wrote the screenplay as a teenager, a simply phenomenal accomplishment
I:299;826;Yet another fine point driving you to watch Thirteen.
I:299;827;The message to this movie is the unspoken message.
I:299;828;In essence, this desire to have her child love her makes her weak.
I:299;829;This societal malady is portrayed with cringing credibility by Hunter.
I:299;830;I will be keeping my eye open for this young person.
I:299;831;Because it is unflinching in its presentation, the symbolism behind it can be misconstrewed as 'this is what all teens go through.'
I:299;832;Tracy ( Evan Rachel Wood), is the quiet and meek good girl.
I:299;833;Because Evie posseses raw sexuality and an overtly shallow confidence, Tracy finds her alluring.
I:299;834;Hunter's willingness to give love and befriend her daughter is most likely what contributes to Tracy's descent from a well.
I:299;835;as ambitious as it tried.
I:299;836;Holly Hunter's fierce and vulnerable performance is most convincing, as she desperately tries.
I:299;837;Co. star and co. writer Nikki Reed went through much of the same turmoil as displayed in the film, but viewers should remember that she is one teen among many, and this unflinching but the over.
I:299;838;"top ""expose"" of sorts only shows a slight piece of the reality of young teens."
I:299;839;This movie paints a realistic window into the scary reality of our kids lives.
I:299;840;This, of course, involves sex, drugs, body piercing, shoplifting, self.
I:299;841;hardwicke has provided a raw, up front straight forward picture of teenage values in our modern culture.
I:299;842;nikki Reed offers superb support as Evie, the wild and wildly popular girl who puts Tracy on the path to gradual self.
I:299;843;Her performance is gripping ,Atonshing is that reed also co wrote the script for Thirteen.
I:299;844;Thirteen is a gritty and some times distrubing film on an important topic, a topic that alot of teens are screaming to let the world know.
I:299;845;Overall a very good movie.
I:299;846;Because of this movie, Hundreds of teenagers are now cutting themselves just to get attention.
I:299;847;Cutting is now a normal part of growing up.
I:299;848;Again, overall this is a great movie.
I:299;849;i just love this movie, some people dont it just you taste on movies i guess!
I:299;850;Perfect movie for a teenage girl!
I:299;851;One of those movies that i could watch over and over again, this movie is great for a slumber party with your girlfriends and something that can really make you cry and feel the pain in the end.
I:299;852;Just an all around great movie.
I:299;853;Much like Larry Clark's Kids which was released almost ten years ago, Thirteen is a nearly unflinching look at an inner.
I:299;854;What helps make Thirteen all the more genuine is that Reed, an actual teenager, co. wrote the film with director Catherine Hardwicke, giving the film a realistic point of view combined with Hardwicke's handcam documentary style approach.
I:299;855;This is as powerful a movie as I have seen in the last few years.
I:299;856;The story by Nikki Reed is amazing, considering that she was a teenager when she wrote this.
I:299;857;And, she is an outstanding actress as well, playing the dark, conniving, manipulative friend of Evan Rachel Wood.
I:299;858;Having only seen Evan in a sweet children's movie, her performance is a revelation.
I:299;859;She was able to express the full range of emotions of a young teenage girl with total believability.
I:299;860;And, Holly Hunter's mother is another in a long line of great performances by the actress.
I:299;861;Nikki Reed's portrayal of Evie is surely one of the more insidious realistic young people ever in film.
I:299;862;Both well written and well played.
I:299;863;My daughter got it for her Xmas gift and she loves it.
I:299;864;I thought thirteen was a realy good movie.
I:299;865;This movie is one of the best movies i've seen in awhile.
I:299;866;Although some may view this film as controversal and disturbing, it is actually a wake up call.
I:299;867;"I love this movie more than any other
I:299;868;but its a good movie.
I:299;869;Ive become obsessed, but this movie is the best I've ever seen at capturing California Adolescence, for I was forced into a world of sex, drugs, alcohol, ect when I was in SIXTH grade.
I:299;870;Nikki Reed, Evan Rachel Wood and Holly Hunter are an amazing trio.
I:299;871;Evan Rachel wood is astounding as well, she truly is amazing.
I:299;872;i can relate to this movie so well and many people do, resulting in its popularity.
I:299;873;The neat thing about this film is how is was filmed, the camera is very jolty, in your face, and colorful.
I:299;874;it makes you feel every emotion, from the moments Tracey (Wood) is high, partying and spinning out of control, you feel the excitement, the fast pace of everything, and also to the sadness, depression and anxiety of a teen living in a dark world where kids want to be adults and independent as fast as possible.
I:299;875;probably my number one favorite movie ever.
I:299;876;I highly recommend this roller coaster of teen angst and rebellion for anyone!
I:299;877;I would highly recommend this film to anyone of the appropriate age demographic!
I:299;878;If you want to see high.
I:299;879;the leads include the talented Evan Rachel Wood and Holly Hunter.
I:299;880;she is also a friend to Reed.
I:299;881;All it made me do was laugh.
I:299;882;::eyeroll::Holly Hunter is very good as Traci's (Wood) mother, who's got issues of her own.
I:299;883;Wood is good as Traci .
I:299;884;a friendship develops between Traci and Evie in a matter of 5 minutes.
I:299;885;And in more ways than one.
I:299;886;traci was a wonderful student in school, very bright, very smart.
I:299;887;"As I mentioned prior, my reaction wasn't, ""Oh my goodness gracious!"""
I:299;888;i'd recommend THIRTEEN to a Holly Hunter or Evan Rachel Wood fan.
I:299;889;Both leads showed true skill in the acting department.
I:299;890;She can't act, simple as that.
I:299;891;Distrubing, engrossing, and hard to look at if you know of someone with the same situation of a family torn, bit by bit with gritty measures.
I:299;892;A very important film for our day.
I:299;893;i did see it and I'm glad.
I:299;894;This movie embodies the very essence of adolecence, as I remember it.
I:299;895;That is how I describe this movie.
I:299;896;She had a hard life.
I:299;897;If people want to see a shocking, eye opening movie about troubled teens, they should see the movie Kids.
I:299;898;That was sad, but great movie.
I:299;899;This is a powerful exposition of peer.
I:299;900;Director Catherine Hardwicke has presented a devastating and totally honest display of contemporary ideas, with the help of fellow screen.
I:299;901;It's a pure, 100% performance, with total conviction.
I:299;902;The movie literally pulls you out of your chair and spins you into a world so crazy and fast it scares you.
I:299;903;For storyline, camera, and performance i give it a 5/5 star rating.
I:299;904;despite Evan Rachel Wood's Best Actress.
I:299;905;This leads to such scenic contradictions as Holly Hunter and Deborah Unger's climactic confrontation over the behavior of their respective children, where Hunter can't seem to tell which way to turn to slap someone.
I:299;906;"place casting in The Piano)
I:299;907;the odd pairing of Hunter (born in 1958) and Sisto (born in 1974) serves to reinforce one of the movie's finest (and, perhaps, most ironic) moments: the attempted seduction of the next door neighbor by the two teens.
I:299;908;I thought this movie was powerful?
I:299;909;Ok I'll make it short and sweet for you1.
I:299;910;Glancing through all these reviews we have two sides to this film.
I:299;911;while Evan Rachel Wood's performance was powerful and beautifully layered the film seemed like a cross between 90210 and MTV.
I:299;912;the film does have many strong points.
I:299;913;Evan Rachel Wood, and ofcourse the amazing Holly Hunter.
I:299;914;there's a faux realism to the scenes with teens on their own, and the acting and directing are fine, but I wanted to scream at single mom Holly Hunter to take control of her kid's life.
I:299;915;"***1/2 Catherine Hardwicke's harrowingly realistic film ""Thirteen"" paints an unflinching, unsparing and uncompromising portrait of an American teenager circa 2003."
I:299;916;evan Rachel Ward, who is 15 in real life, plays Tracy, a fairly ordinary thirteen.year.
I:299;917;"old girl whose life falls to pieces when she decides she wants to fit in with the ""cool"" kids at her middle school."
I:299;918;This, of course, involves sex, drugs, body piercing, shoplifting, self.
I:299;919;wood provides a fully rounded, believable portrait of a young girl in search of her identity and Nikki Reed offers superb support as Evie, the wild and wildly popular girl who puts Tracy on the path to gradual self.
I:299;920;Holly Hunter hits all the right notes in the role, making the mother neither a hero nor a villain, just a recognizable human being.
I:299;921;In this, her first film as a director (she has previously been an art director and a production designer), Hardwicke proves herself a talent well worth watching.
I:299;922;Thirteen is one of those rare films that slaps you in the face and tells you to pay attention because 'there for the grace of God' could go you or your kids .
I:299;923;Two of us are 15, and the other, 14.
I:299;924;there are scenes in the movie that reminded us of our own friends.
I:299;925;i honestly think that everyone, girls and guys alike, ages 12 and up should see this movie.
I:299;926;i really enjoyed this movie, and wanted to spread the word.
I:299;927;This is pure Hollywood honesty as opposed to the brutal honesty of a movie like Kids .
I:299;928;I can actually see the writer sitting on the set thinking up more ways to screw this girl up in the film.
I:299;929;This movie was very believable and had a good progression to the point I wanted to my daughter to pick up on.
I:299;930;Holly Hunter is talented, and the publicity this movie received made it very intriguing.
I:299;931;The older brother was the best part of the movie, and he was barely in it.
I:299;932;i usually like most of the movies I see, but this.
I:299;933;I'm honestly going to say that I HATED it.
I:299;934;I highly enjoyed this movie!
I:299;935;Most films about teens portray them as glamourous and always having fun, not caring about anything.
I:299;936;This film portrays us as we really can be, through all of our pain.
I:299;937;I loved this movie, and immediatly after I watched it, I called my friends over to watch it again with me.
I:299;938;We all loved it and thought it was very insightful, and eerily endearing.
I:299;939;movie was ok, I'd recommend seeing it especially if you are entering into a helping profession it really helps open your eyes.
I:299;940;It is a commentary on how America's young girls are being transformed into willing whores.
I:299;941;at the beginning of the movie, she is a normal, well.
I:299;942;the movie is intended to shock and is successful in doing so.
I:299;943;Thirteen is a raw, provocative look at adolescence and all the confusion and chaos that comes along with it.
I:299;944;Holly Hunter is also wonderful as Tracy's mom.
I:299;945;this film is one of the most realistic depictions that I've seen of the pressures that come with being a teenager.
I:299;946;It is beautifully rendered and deserves the accolades it has received.
I:299;947;She deserts her previous friends and gets involved in drugs and consequently sex.
I:299;948;The performances of the whole cast is superb, and this is one of the reasons why the movie is so disturbing.
I:299;949;i actually found myself laughing in some spots, like when the girls are punching each other because they are high and can't feel anything.
I:299;950;Thirteen is a bold, gut.
I:299;951;Tracy is astonishingly portrayed by Evan Rachel Wood who gives such an amazing performance it should take child.
I:299;952;The Oscar nominated Holly Hunter ,as Mel, is brilliant as a bohemian, alcoholic single mom who watches her daughter Tracy descend into self.
I:299;953;The director Catherine Hardwicke directs the film with relentless, edgy appeal giving the film it's power and drive.
I:299;954;the mood of the film is an unflinching cinematic opus to a generation sadly spiralling out of control.
I:299;955;This film is an interesting and entertaining look at the lives of two 13 year old girls.
I:299;956;Tracey (Evan Rachel Wood) is a straight A student who just wants to fit in, she is envious of the beautiful and popular Evie (Nikki Reed).
I:299;957;The film is a realistic portrayal of what some 13 year olds go through, i cant really say i did any of these things when i was 13, but it still does happen.
I:299;958;Woods portrayal of the student trying to fit in is completely beliveveable, raw and emotional, she does a superb job.
I:299;959;Hunter also does well as Wood's mother, trying her hardest to help her out of control daughter.
I:299;960;Very much worth a look.
I:299;961;Thirteen is one of those vignette movies that make you feel dirty but alive.
I:299;962;Nikki (Evie), the writer and one of the main characters is very talented but the girl worried me.
I:299;963;It gives you a peek into what is happening to many middle and high schoolers especially the ones with broken hearts and homes and then left with no mentoring, correction or supervision.
I:299;964;Anyone who has a young girl coming into teenage years needs to see this movie!
I:299;965;But manipulation can create that kind of reaction.
I:299;966;There is actually quite a few good teenage wasteland movies out there.
I:299;967;"2001's L. i. e. easily outraws ""Thirteen,"" as does 1987's ""River's Edge."""
I:299;968;I was running around with kids that I look back at now, and wonder what I ever liked about them.
I:299;969;For the older people reading this when you did something wrong you got your a** beat for it.
I:299;970;But lets be real here.
I:299;971;we all got punished when we were kids, and look how we turned out.
I:299;972;THIRTEEN is a raw, uncompromising drama that ranks as one of the best of 2003.
I:299;973;tHIRTEEN is a snapshot of modern American pre.
I:299;974;This is a film that families should watch together.
I:299;975;This was one of the most moving films I've seen in a long time.
I:299;976;Drugs, alcohol, peer pressure and familiy issues are all touched on in this wonderfully written film.
I:299;977;I'm sure it will touch your heart and make you think.
I:299;978;It also is a great reminder for us as adults to pay attention to our teens.
I:299;979;Job well done to all the actors and actresses in Thirteen.
I:299;980;it is very realistic because there are otherteenagers that are living this sort of live style.
I:299;981;Tracy (played by Evan Rachel Wood) should be getting a Oscar for her performance and the supporting role of her mother(Holly Hunter) is at the same level.
I:299;982;i enjoy the movie a lot and highly recommend it to anyone.
I:299;983;to go into to much detail would be to rob this fine film of much of its emotional punch.
I:299;984;one bright spot I will reveal: a man, presented with these two Lolitas actually resists temptation and behaves as a man should.
I:299;985;The taunts, name calling, labelling and tremendous pressure to homogenize all brought me chills of memory.
I:299;986;evan Rachel Wood's character, on the other hand, is a fully fleshed out person.
I:299;987;Where there is love, there is hope.
I:299;988;Still, how the writers could have ever imagined having a 13 year old character utter it is beyond me.
I:299;989;This movie was above and beyond my expectations.
I:299;990;The movie feels really personal.
I:299;991;She wants this so much that she would do anything for the popularity, even if it means hanging around the popular girl in school, Evie.
I:299;992;"The acting was terrific
I:299;993;"i recommend ""Thirteen"" to anyone who likes Mean Girls!"
I:299;994;In this horrfyingly realistic outlook upon the life of teenagers in middle school Tracie is a well balanced girl until she befriends the most popular girl in school, Evie.
I:299;995;As Evie and Tracie come closer and closer together Tracie is transformed from her perfect being into a sex / drug / and crime addict.
I:299;996;this movie won my favorite movie of the Year award, i loved it so much i had my mom go out and bye it for me.
I:299;997;I would recomend this movie to anyone even if you are 80, this is a truly inspiring and heart.
I:299;998;"what I appreciated about ""Thirteen"" was how the 'good."
I:299;999;This movie was very intense,watched it for my sociology class on Juvenile Deliquency and it showed how close to real issue's like these are.
I:299;1000;"All she wants is to be accepted by the ""in"" crowd, and in doing so makes her way to the top while giving into peer pressure."
I:299;1001;For me, it really hit home.
I:299;1002;Another great thing about Thirteen is that it not only showed how Tracys mistakes affected herself, but her family and friends.
I:299;1003;Definately a good film, but I wouldn't reccomend it for younger viewers.
I:299;1004;Physical, emotional, and mental pain.
I:299;1005;All of what I have just stated comes from personal experience, so I should know.
I:299;1006;All of that aside, the performances are excellent all around, especially Evan Rachel Woods and Holly Hunter.
I:299;1007;When you can BECOME the character and get everyone to forget that it is a performance, that's when you realize that you've got true acting ability, and these women do have it.
I:299;1008;Nikki Reed is very good, too.
I:299;1009;She plays her part very well, also.
I:299;1010;You become very tense while watching this film.
I:299;1011;catherine Hardwicke is a great director, and this film proves it.
I:299;1012;Very intense look into a young woman's journey to drugs, sex, and self.
I:299;1013;This movie was a good look at the extremes of what today's teens have to deal with.
I:299;1014;Holly Hunter did a great job in the portrayal of a mother who is struggling with her own problems, while at the same time trying to balance between being a friend and an authority figure to Tracy.
I:299;1015;Nikki Reid (also the co. writer) made her stunning debut as Tracy's best friend Evie.
I:299;1016;She played the role of the friend you hope your daughter is not hanging out with.
I:299;1017;The acting was captivating and the story line hit close to home.
I:299;1018;I recommend this movie 100%.
I:299;1019;If you really identified with this movie and thought it was so real and so mind changingly great.you have real problems.
I:299;1020;As a mother of a teen girl this was a terrifying but oh so true movie.
I:299;1021;This is a really good movie.
I:299;1022;I enjoyed watching it with my friends.
I:299;1023;"ever powerful and shocking, ""THIRTEEN"" is reality."
I:299;1024;she waves to the neighbor across the street (she used to hang out with her kids) and the woman turns her back on her and walks away.
I:299;1025;the movie speaks the truth without ammending the more gritty details.
I:299;1026;"i could she the mask she wore so she could ""fit in"" and ""be happy""."
I:299;1027;NEED I SAY MORE?I love the cinematography.
I:299;1028;this is a great movie, I grew up watching it.
I:299;1029;It is great because it brings awareness to real dangers for teens!
I:299;1030;His role is much smaller than the other three, but he combines a lack of caring with a big brother instinct that is very real.
I:299;1031;I enjoyed the direction of this film, and it is shaky and grainy in some parts, adding to the realism of the situation.
I:299;1032;Simply put, she does do these things to herself, and it matters not what the reasoning is, just that they are done is enough.
I:299;1033;this is a great film, better than the other movie of this type, Kids , which was more an expoitation of youth than an analysis.
I:299;1034;That's the best way you can describe the way this movie was filmed.
I:299;1035;anyway, just watch this movie!
I:299;1036;Female, male, it's good for everyone, but more than likely it'll appeal to females more.
I:299;1037;it got great reviews, but DAMN its an 18!
I:299;1038;so refrained from watching it again.
I:299;1039;one day i watched it again and it made me burst into tears, as i thought about me and all my friends, as it seems we're all going down the same road as Evie and Tracy.
I:299;1040;why didnt i enjoy it the first?
I:299;1041;well isnt that obvious i wasnt mature enough to watch the movie, i couldnt empathise with the charchters to find it emotional enough, as that is what the film is really all about EMOTIOM!!!
I:299;1042;what i really enjoyed about this film is that it showes what really happens as a teen, when you dicover drink drugs and sex!!
I:299;1043;full of nail biting emotion, and is a real teer jerker.
I:299;1044;Well, I think this movie is pretty darn good.
I:299;1045;All of the popular people in my school.
I:299;1046;Believe it or not but,a good amount of girls the age of 13 do all of these things.
I:299;1047;And I knew alot of girls that were doing all of this.
I:299;1048;Because they don't ever really SEE what it does to you.
I:299;1049;And it does actually have a point to it.
I:299;1050;Will have you on edge throughout.
I:299;1051;A movie you can watch again and again.
I:299;1052;wrenching look at the pressures and temptations that face teenagers in the new millenium.
I:299;1053;In the space of 100 minutes, her character arc goes from sweet, needy pre.
I:299;1054;teens to also view this film and stay involved in the lives of your children.
I:299;1055;Perhaps it will open a few eyes as to the pressures children face at the start of the 21st century.
I:299;1056;It is probably one of the best teen movies out there.
I:299;1057;Its so real, the acting was wonderful I actually felt like I was in the movie, it was so great.
I:299;1058;I recommend it for anyone of any age to sit down and watch it.
I:299;1059;This movie shocked me to the core.
I:299;1060;Meanwhile, her brother is on his own pot escapades, and her mother is concentrating on her AA meetings and her coked up boyfriend.
I:299;1061;'Thirteen' is the epitomy of realistic teen dramas.
I:299;1062;It sets the stage for all that will be coming in this rare, but exquisid film.
I:299;1063;Go see it and enjoy.
I:299;1064;Though 'Thirteen' collected only $4,600,000 on the US boxoffice chart, it got one Oscar nomination (for Holly Hunter) and two Golden Globe nominations (for Hunter and Wood) not to mention the more than 300 reviews sent here by visitors to amazon.
I:299;1065;oK, good thing about the film is the acting, which is probably better than the underwritten script itself.
I:299;1066;Though Holly Hunter is top.
I:299;1067;handedly carries the whole film till the end.
I:299;1068;trust'), this is her first works as director.
I:299;1069;be a convincing protrait of teenager's life in America thanks to Wood and Reed.
I:299;1070;It brings back memories and I understood it right away.
I:299;1071;This is one of the best movies i have seen.
I:299;1072;It just showing you dont need a big movie production company to make a great film.
I:299;1073;It is one of those movies you just need to see it.
I:299;1074;Knowing that they actress of this movies Evan Rachel Wood, and Actress/co.
I:299;1075;"Its a wonderful movie about quot
I:299;1076;It just a need to see movie.
I:299;1077;"autobiography of actress Nikki Reed even though she is playing the quot
I:299;1078;Thirteen is the kind of movie that stays fresh in your mind even weeks after seeing it.
I:299;1079;Although many of the predominant themes exist in many other teen movies, Thirteen presents these issues in a daring and refreshing new style.
I:299;1080;work, far from inducing motion sickness, actually adds to the gritty realism, in my opinion.
I:299;1081;The characters are well rounded and believable, and the plot moves along at the perfect breakneck pace befitting the main characters' descents into decadent mayhem.
I:299;1082;And as far as cautionary tales go, it is beautifully engaging.
I:299;1083;engrossing and you just can't look away from the train wreck.
I:299;1084;now a word about shock value: If you're extremely easily.
I:299;1085;all performed by young teens.
I:299;1086;On the other hand, the educational and artistic value of the film overrides the shock value.
I:299;1087;another thing: The soundtrack is perfect.
I:299;1088;I love this movie it is definitely one of my all time favorites.
I:299;1089;But thanks to amazon I got a good copy and it is a great movie for teenagers and up.
I:299;1090;It is definitely worth the price.
I:299;1091;the bottom line is that this movie is realistic, worthwhile, well done, and perhaps the highest praise of all: relevant.
I:299;1092;Co. written by one of the actresses in the film as a sort of auto.
I:299;1093;biographical account of her thirteen year old life.
I:299;1094;Its very interesting to look at the film and realise that Nikki is playing the very character that pushed her over the edge, in fact its almost disturbing.
I:299;1095;the film features superb lead acting by Wood and Holly Hunter, who plays the most realistic 'movie mother' i've seen in a while.
I:299;1096;overall the film is a veritable knockout.
I:299;1097;The acting is superb, as is the casting.
I:299;1098;But better yet, the 'teens' in this film are for once played by actors that actually move within their age groups.
I:299;1099;Reed is eighteen, which allows her to bring the maturity and superiority to her role that is required.
I:299;1100;Its also quite impressive that a movie this cathartic was written by someone who's probably still in highschool.
I:299;1101;Reed has truly come far from her real 'Thirteen' experience.
I:299;1102;i sorta enjoyed this one and sorta not was a bit slow and boring at times but overall a decent movie
I:299;1103;A movie shot with in your face camera style to make it seem like a documentary .
I:299;1104;to make you feel that you are watching a real family coming to terms with a rebellious teenager.
I:299;1105;thirteen is watchable, but is definitely not as good as reviews would have you believe.
I:299;1106;After about four of my friends told me that THIRTEEN was one of the best movies ever, I decided to check it out.
I:299;1107;She wants to be friends with Evie, the it girl that everyone loves.
I:299;1108;sometimes the movie is in full color, while other times it looks black and white, and sometimes there's color but its faded.
I:299;1109;"There's a lot of swearing (many ""effs"" thrown around), there's also drug use, sexuality, and nudity."
I:299;1110;But it's an amazing film that I recommend to everyone.
I:299;1111;When I first saw Thirteen I liked it but I didnt really understand it.
I:299;1112;When I watched it again over and over I really started to see how much it affected me and just how much I loved it.
I:299;1113;I am alot like her, from looks to how she acts and that is why I love this film.
I:299;1114;My favourite film of all time.
I:299;1115;the performances in this movie are first.
I:299;1116;rate and sometimes you might think you're watching a documentary.
I:299;1117;"The spinning out of control"" part brings me to my next point."
I:299;1118;life's responsibilities, adults and their children alike.
I:299;1119;I love the movie and yes 13 year olds do get into everything just like in that movie.
I:299;1120;It could be happening to someone you know right now whose thirteen.
I:299;1121;This is one of my favorite movies EVER.
I:299;1122;and that is quite a compliment.
I:299;1123;It really gives a great look into what life is like for 13 year olds growing up in the world today.
I:299;1124;I highly recommend this movie.
I:299;1125;My mom recommended I see this movie.
I:299;1126;Yes,have your young teen see this,it may be a wake up call.
I:299;1127;Huh, I remember a lot from this movie.
I:299;1128;This movie is as true and as real as it gets.
I:299;1129;Holly Hunter does an amazing portrayal of a mother who doesn't know what the heck is going on with her daughter, even if it's happening right in front of her face.
I:299;1130;Maybe watching Thirteen again when that time comes will open your eyes a bit more.
I:299;1131;This movie was an excellent portral of the common teen morals today.
I:299;1132;I, myself, know many people who drink, do drugs, cut, and have sex, and I am only 16.
I:299;1133;The young actresses (especially Evan Rachel Wood) also did an excellent job acting as their characters.
