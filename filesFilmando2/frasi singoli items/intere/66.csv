1;Awesome movie, Hitchcock was way before his time!
2;This movie was well worth the price.
3;Rarely is the film carried by the strength of the actors.
4;The maid helps fuel the tension as she gossips while conducting her duties.
5;For one of the hosts it seems to fuel his own idea that he is superior to all his guests and that if they were his equal they could figure it all out.
6;rope boasts some big named actors such as James Stewart and Sir Cedric Hardwicke but also brings some less known actors such as John Dall and Douglas Dick.
7;The mix works out fine.
8;everyman roles, is perfect as the philosophical headmaster who with his abstract ideas that he passed on to his students really is responsible for the killing that takes place.
9;I really enjoyed watching Joan Chandler as the soon to be fiance of the murdered man.
10;It was a treat to see Hitchcock use a brunette instead of his standard blonde for this movie.
11;this was Hitchcock's first color movie and the set is beautiful.
12;The documentary was well done and informative
13;Rope, 1948 filmThe film opens on a bright sunny city street in the late afternoon.
14;A thrill killing by sadists behind drawn curtains?
15;"Brandon's megalomania starts to show
I:41981;16;The guests begin to show up.
I:41981;17;Then Rupert returns to hold a conversation with Brandon.
I:41981;18;Would such a play be successful today?
I:41981;19;The suspense is there, naturally, and the atmosphere is so thick you could cut it with a knife.
I:41981;20;It is certainly enthralling, philosophical, and peppered with typical Hitchcock dark humor.
I:41981;21;this is by far the shortest Universal picture he ever made, and it shows.
I:41981;22;Still, a recommended Hitchcock experience.
I:41981;23;From the opening 'rope trick', this movie kept moving.
I:41981;24;Nothing surprising and his face broadcast nearly everything he was thinking.
I:41981;25;and it was fun to watch him slowly come unglued.
I:41981;26;But I was glued to John Dall's oily self.
I:41981;27;This would be a good one to update.
I:41981;28;ROPE was one of Hitchcock's early masterpieces.
I:41981;29;it was also Hitchcock's first attempt at a new pioneering technique in filmmaking.
I:41981;30;upon viewing the film one will realize why.
I:41981;31;however, the film still remains a powerful experiment in the macabre.
I:41981;32;the audio is mono but is excellent for a film over 56 years old.
I:41981;33;the extras include an excellent documentary entitled """"Rope Unleashed""""."""
34;This is one of my favorite Hitchcock and James Stewart movies.
35;Any Hitchcock fan must see this film to appreciate these film shots.
36;ROPE had me riveted to my seat, right up to the end.
37;"actors John Dall ""Brandon Shaw"" and Farley Granger ""Phillip Morgan,"" deliver great performances but at first glance it would seem as though they can't act."
38;another interesting note is the filming technique that the brilliant director, Alfred Hitchcock, decided to use.
39;"This might be a little uncomfortable for some viewers, even though they might not even realize that's what it is, but it creates this feeling, as viewers, that we are staring
I:41981;40;as far as the two main characters being gay, well that's only subtly implied.
I:41981;41;The movie begins with two friends, Brandon and Philip, murdering a classmate David for the thrill of committing the act.
I:41981;42;hitchcock took a chance with this film and it turned out to work in his benefit.
I:41981;43;When Hitchcock did change takes he did it in very sneaky ways.
I:41981;44;An example of this would be cutting into the back of a person and then changing to another person.
I:41981;45;Watching the movie made it feel like one was actually at the dinner party.
I:41981;46;the acting in this movie was also a nice surprise.
I:41981;47;James Stewart fit very well into the role of Rupert.
I:41981;48;Rupert played an important part in the film as Philip and Brandon's old teacher.
I:41981;49;The emotions portrayed by John Dall and Farley Granger, who played the killers, were very believable to the viewers.
I:41981;50;Farley Granger, who played Philip, did an excellent job showing fear and remorse.
I:41981;51;She seemed to always be smiling even when the scene would call for her to frown.
I:41981;52;I was pleasantly surprised to find out that this film was unlike any other movie Hitchcock made.
I:41981;53;It was suspenseful in a whole new way.
I:41981;54;Rope kept my interest the whole time, which is unusual for me during any films.
I:41981;55;I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes the unusual in suspense films.
I:41981;56;Rope is an excellent film and Hitchcock pulled it off great.
I:41981;57;They raved how it was one of his most creative and effective ventures, and now that I've seen it I have to say that they are 100% correct.
I:41981;58;From start to finish, this film is thrilling and exciting and the final frames with that `confrontation' completely took my breath away.
I:41981;59;Adapted from a stage play that was inspired by actual events, this chilling film captures the subtlety of tension with each passing frame, and the fact that the frame rarely passes (it is shot in real time and in one long take, broken up by periodic blackness necessary for the cameras to change reels) makes the film all the more engaging.
I:41981;60;the jittery and somewhat manic performances by the film's stars, John Dall and Farley Granger, create a basis for the audiences connection to the film, and the brilliant supporting performances, especially that of LEGEND James Stewart make this film a true masterpiece.
I:41981;61;Stewarts eyes do a lot of talking and completely unravel the surprise before our eyes.
I:41981;62;That final scene is breathtaking and will have you on edge.
I:41981;63;Alfred Hitchcock is known all over the world for his famous and ground breaking work in the genre of suspense films.
I:41981;64;In """"Rope,"""" a planned murder, followed by a sick party, demonstrate Hitchcock's usual twists and surprises."""
65;The movie also lacked good music and sound affects to add to the suspense and drama of its scenes.
66;"Hitchcock is known for his famous camera work in the movie ""Psycho"" where he employs multiple camera angles."
67;Rope certainly sets itself apart from movies of that period and without question to the movies of today.
68;The story is based on an real.
69;what you're left with is a pretty straightforward plot.
70;there's no major character to engage your sympathy in a positive way until near the end.
71;despite these criticisms, this is a good dramatic movie.
72;The acting is very good.
73;Stewart gets the top billing, but Granger and Dall have the biggest roles.
74;There is also plenty of tension in the later part of the story, and the psychological study of the characters played by Dall and Granger is fascinating as the pressure of guilt and suspicion mounts.
75;It is a tense drama, however, and will hold your attention.
76;It isn't one of his best movies, but it's still pretty good.
77;In my opinion, this is one of Hitchcock's most underrated films.
78;It doesn't get as much credit as some of his other famous flicks, but it's equally as suspenseful and entertaining.
79;Hitchcock manipulates time and space in such a unique way with this experiment in filmmaking.
80;Viewed: 10/06, 12/12Rate: 410/06: Amazing, Rope is made in 1948, and already it's so groundbreaking innovative.
81;Everything about Rope is perfect.
82;In all said, Rope is a definitive Hitchcock masterpiece.
83;And it belongs in any top films list.
84;Among Hitchcock's films, this one ranks one of his bests.
85;I know: Hitchcock wanted to add the noir aspect.
86;All in all, Rope is a technically good picture, but anything more than that, it's better to study the mistakes.
87;Actually, the most interesting things about this movie are the backstories, such as the Leopold.
88;"But Granger's comments on how they had to move things around on the set to keep the shots continuous are amusing
I:41981;89;Outside of that, the film has some suspense, of course.
I:41981;90;And I always love the gorgeous Farley Granger doing his deer.
I:41981;91;The twist of their minds was suggested by the real.
I:41981;92;Phillip especially is enjoying a feeling of superiority, having committed the """"perfect murder,"""" and is totally confident that they will not be found out."""
93;It's a rather amazing psychodrama, but then Hitchcock is famous for that sort of thing.
94;This is one of my favorite Hitchcock flicks.
95;Great ensemble acting, tightly woven plot (based on stageplay) and superior direction make for a highly enjoyable viewing experience.
96;I recommend it to all Hitchcock devotees!
97;To take a film and direct it as if it were a play denies the film of all the unique qualities that make it a film and not a play.
98;"The plot was done better in the film ""Compulsion"", also based on the Leopold and Loeb case, with Orson Welles' great performance as Clarence Darrow."
99;Some plays make a successful transition to film.
100;The film is successful because of the intensity and passion of O'Neill's script.
101;Sympathetic characters, and strong performances from the actors make this film a fine film.
102;Great performances from all principals.
103;Great mood setting and interplay between the 2 major characters and Stewart is fantastic in his pinning their crime down.
104;This film sort of works backwards from showing you the crime up front and who did it and expertly and suspensefully, of course, rolling out events that lead up to solving the crime.
105;Jimmy Stewart is a gem!
106;One of my favorite actors of all time and he played his role with amazing skill and craftsmanship.
107;If you watch the actors John Dall and Farley Granger, you'll see an amazing contrast in their personalities after committing their crime.
108;Watching this movie will give you whiplash as you look from one actor to another and move from one scene to the next to find out when and how the villains (Dall and Granger) will be discovered.
109;Intriguing, suspenseful, clever directing and the ending was just right.
110;Rope's a great Hitchcock film.
111;A classic who dunnit set in a thriving metropolis.
112;Both suspense and philosophical with larger implications involved.
113;is without a single creative and exciting component.
114;This movie is one of Hitchcock's poorer performances.
115;This movie was Hitchcock's first color film.
116;His inspiration in directing the film version of the stage play the was his experience with the real life Leopold.
117;This allows the audience to watch the movie already knowing what truly happened.
118;in conclusion this film seemed to have an interesting and suspenseful plot.
119;"RopeFor it's time Alfred Hitchcock's suspense film, ""Rope"" was a masterpiece in it's own right, this is true today as well."
120;The movie brings together elements of suspense of how it feels to commit a horrendous crime along with the excitement of getting away with it.
121;All the while Brandon is keeping his cool playing along with keeping the murder a secret perfectly.
122;He has been sweating bullets since the guests have arrived to the party.
123;Towards the end when Philip is playing the piano and making many mistakes, something he never does also helps set a certain mood that Brandon and Philip are getting closer and closer to being caught by Stewart.
124;Though this film is set in one main room, Hitchcock uses is continuous shot method of camera work to get a sense of what the characters are thinking or feeling.
125;Granger does a wonderful job of playing the unwilling participant in this film.
126;Rupert does a wonderful job at wearing Brandon and Philip down to the breaking point.
127;"while ""Rope"" may not be the technological masterpiece of present day films, it is very well crafted and stands the test of time to remain on of the greatest suspense films of all time."
128;So begins this film, really a stage play, brought to the screen by Hitchcock.
129;The last 20 minutes thus builds and builds.
130;I remember that it is made by Alfred Hitchcock and know that it should be good because of this.
131;growing up in a generation of excellent technology I don't have much tolerance for anything below par.
132;Hitchcock also decided to film the entire movie in one apartment.
133;The thought that any one is so much better than someone one else, which gives them the right to kill them, is disgusting.
134;Brandon, one of the killers, was the host of the party and came up with the idea.
135;sat there laughing at everything.
136;The film is shot as a single continuous take (it's fun to spot the parts where they had to reload the camera.)
137;Suspense is a genre that today's many films are categorized into.
138;the whole movie, but the whole of it, is acted in a single room: a living room.
139;"'Rope' may not have many modern techniques that we are used to nowadays
I:41981;140;I recommend this movie to every suspense.
I:41981;141;lover, but especially to those who are aiming to get sophisticated about where the roots of suspense came from.
I:41981;142;This obscure movie has always been one of my favorite Hitchcock films.
I:41981;143;For the added thrill, they throw the victim's body into a chest from which they serve their guests their buffet dinner.
I:41981;144;These two interact very awkwardly, to the delight of their murderous hosts, until the end of the party.
I:41981;145;The point of all of this conversation at the party is to show that David .
I:41981;146;as is true with all human beings .
I:41981;147;He is a human, as important as any other, who has people who care about him and will obviously mourn his death.
I:41981;148;james Stewart is great as the murderers' former teacher, Rupert, who solves the mystery that the two killers have pretty much dared him to discover and solve.
I:41981;149;the inspiration for this film .
I:41981;150;It is a psychological thriller, not one of Hitchcock's action thrillers.
I:41981;151;That box set has a total of 14 of Hitchcock's better known films from the late 40's through the 70's, and """"Rope"""" is one of the included films."""
152;The project was to evaluate a piece of media and discover the worldview that shaped that piece of media.
153;This gteatly added to the suspense and eeriness of the movie.
154;The skill of the camera and the lighting crews as well as the actors stood out throughout the whole movie.
155;The best lighting in this movie is in the ending scene when just Phillip, Brandon and Rupert are in the room and the lights from next door are flashing into the room.
156;this is one of the first Hitchcock movies I have watched, following Vertigo and The Stranger.
157;This movie is just complex enough to where most people can watch it and pick up on evething that is going on, but it also allows for others to pick up on more hidden elements that come out through additional attention.
158;This movie was very well done.
159;I thought it was better the first time I saw it.
160;Ordered the movie the next day.
161;This film is truly a sleeper of suspence flicks.
162;See if you don't sympathize with the victim's father and former girlfriend who are among the invited guests at the dinner party where their loved one just took his last drink.
163;I think this is an amazing look into the thinking of a sociopath, the poor hapless fool who has wanted since childhood to be like him and the somewhat likeable, curmudgeonly former housemaster who unwittingly sets them on what could have been a lifetime of serial murders, but catches them after their first.
164;This film was director Hitchcock's first foray into the wonderful world of brilliant technicolor.
165;The action takes place at a dinner party.
166;Because this is Hitchcock, he no doubt delighted that the trunk was being used as a dining table.
167;The overall effect is very much like watching a play and I don't think audiences were prepared for that.
168;this is a crisp transfer from a clear master copy.
169;It is interesting and well done and the overall effect made me feel as though I was a fly on the wall, privy to an interesting conversation that becomes increasingly frightening and threatening as it continues.
170;The acting is very good.
171;That includes Alfred Hitchcock's films, which I loved in the '50s and '60s.
172;The biggest name actor in the movie is James Stewart but these other two guys are the main stars.
173;It's based on a true.
174;"life event, famously labeled ""The Leopold and Loeb Case."""
175;suffice to say, this is well.
176;acted, has a good amount of black humor with the dialog and has people that are easy to root against.
177;Some criticize the famous director for using the real.
178;time method, but I give him credit for trying something new and bold.
179;"That ""gimmick"" certainly has worked in the successful TV series, ""24."""
180;Rope is definitely worth a look if you've never seen it, just to see what happens to these arrogant punks.
181;I found subsequent viewings less appealing but I stillI think this is Sir Alfred's best work of the 1940s.
182;I first saw The Birds at the age of seven, and have been in love with Hitchcock films ever since.
183;The movie is extraordinary .
184;There's so much going on here that can be easily overlooked .
185;Rear Window still ranks as my favorite Hitchcock film.
186;I admired the creative lens Hitchcock used to show us this film.
187;some of his shots rank as creative and timeless.
188;Even though it was released over 50 years ago it stands the test of time and still thrills audiences even by today's standard.
189;the plot is simple but intriguing.
190;They reason, since they are superior to David, they have every right to kill him.
191;"This aspect makes it interesting for the viewer
I:41981;192;the movie """"Rope"""" has suspense from the opening scene to the closing scene."""
193;But Rope is a thriller of its own kind.
194;It is purely a physiological thriller, and doesn't rely on gory murders or special effects.
195;"The fact that Hitchcock can create such a great amount of suspense without these techniques shows how good ""Rope"" really is."
196;The plot, acting and dialogue are what make this movie the thriller it is.
197;A highly successful technical experiment.
198;This was Hitchcock's first color film, shot on one set in (almost) one unbroken shot.
199;Pretty amazing when you consider that the cameras of that time were not nearly as portable as those of today.
200;the performers are outstanding as well, particularly James Stewart and John Dall.
201;Real tension is generated as the players confront and confound each other while Hitchcock's roving camera moves through the room, always alert for the telling detail.
202;Alfred Hitchcock is my favorite Director!
203;i love the fact that this is the first movie to be shot in real time.
204;Kudos to the property master and the lighting department!Hitchcock also loved anything taboo and perverse.
205;He went to great lengths to let us know that these two roommates were not only killers but that they were lovers as well!
206;I will tell you that this is definitely Hitchcock's first masterpiece!
207;but it's worth a look.
208;james Stewart, Farley Granger, and John Dall are the stars here, with Stewart (as always) giving a flawless, effortless.
209;I really liked all the character portrayals in this film.
210;wise, being filmed in ten.
211;"minute, continuous takes, giving it a ""seamless"" uninterrupted look."
212;Rope is unique in another fashion as well .
213;"A very inventive cameo indeed (rivaling his ""newspaper"" appearance in ""Lifeboat"" for the most creative, IMO)."
214;"But Hitchcock, in ""Rope"" and ""The Birds"" (which was fifteen years later), did it quite successfully."
215;"But, overall, ""Rope"" looks excellent here!"
216;"This disc has very nearly as many Special Features as the other Hitchcock ""Collector's"" packages."
217;"minute documentary, ""Rope Unleashed"", covering the making of this motion picture."
218;Many backstage pictures are mixed in with the interview segments, including some eye.
219;I absolutely love this unique trailer.
220;It's just a short scene, but sets up some of the plot points very nicely in just a few seconds.
221;"I think the introduction of the murder victim in this ""added"" scene was a very clever idea by the filmmakers."
222;>> A very nice Photo Gallery (which has many behind.
223;"with ""Rope"", his first venture into the world of ""Technicolor"", resting among my personal ""Top 10 Hitch Flicks""."
224;I recommend it to those who like Hitchcock films!!!!
225;"Kind of a well directed, ""oh, what could have been"", film."
226;The blu ray is decent pic.
227;but overall, I still love the movie.
228;I happen to love this Hitchcock movie, and I'm really happy to be able to view it on Blu.
229;This one is probably a lesser known Hitchcock movie but it's beautifully done.
230;Jimmy Stewart is as always wonderful and remains one of my fave Hitchcock leading me, although not actually appearing in Rope until about 30 minutes in.
231;The ending is probably the best scene and really highlights Stewart's acting.
232;Alfred Hitchcock is my all time favorite and no one will ever be able to top him!
233;This is :)another great sitting on the edge of your suspense from the master!!
234;A great performance is given by Cedric Hardwick as the Dad of the unfortunate victim.
235;The other actors also played their roles well.
236;When this is thrown in Rupert's face he is shocked and dismayed.
237;One of my favorite Hitchcock films.
238;This is Hitchcock at his best if just experimentally so.
239;In one sense the film is about the difference between the artist and the manipulator.
240;"and such a murder is the center of ""Rope,"" one of Alfred Hitchcock's more experimental movies."
241;"Brandon wants to commit the ""perfect"" murder that proves their intellectual superiority, and as superior beings they are exempt from the morals that govern society ."
242;Frankly, I find it a fascinating piece of work, both artistically and thematically .
243;And yes, it's in real time.
244;it's also rather experimental in its chilling theme.
245;And the scariest part is this is based in reality .
246;"One of the most intense scenes is Rupert casually discussing how he supports murder of ""inferior"" people."
247;and the whole time, you're acutely aware that his students have actually put this into practice.
248;It leads to a beautifully harrowing scene when Rupert realizes the monsters he has helped create through his own careless insensitivity.
249;a cheery, casual psychopath who toys with David's loved ones for his own sadistic amusement.
250;Grange and Dahl are absolutely amazing in their roles, and they really elicit your loathing for the characters they play.
251;"chilling, odd and strangely ""real."""
252;There are better films inspired by the Loeb.
253;Compulsion, for instance, is very much of its time, but it knocked me out when I was young.
254;It's similar to Dial M, but with a psychological slant that, along with the factual basis for the story, make it a hard picture to really enjoy.
255;(Hitchcock wanted Cary Grant .
256;But, even if the picture doesn't work entirely it's still underrated, and at less than 90 minutes fascinating.
257;Alfred Hitchcock was brilliant at creating the perfect atmosphere in his films, and in this respect, Rope does not dissapoint.
258;Although Hitchcock has forfeited most of his intricate camera direction (Rope, as an experiment, was filmed with as few camera cuts as possible), the placing and movements of the actors around Brandon and Phillip's Manhattan apartment are impressively coordinated.
259;Though subtle, this masterful direction has a palpable effect on Rope's edgy, mysterious atmosphere.
260;Stewart's ability to balance cynicism and warmth, humor and graveness, is impressive.
261;The dialogue is witty and rolls of the tounges of these characters.
262;The use of double entendre is particularly humorous.
263;Also included: a clever trailer for Rope and many production photos.
264;Stewart dismisses the morals of society that govern against murder and speaks as if you should feel superior to them.
265;After all, the great director always had to have a great leading lady and some good romance.
266;This party works as a facade.
267;Throughout her presence, we can see a lot of ambiguity in her words, as well as in her gestures.
268;This beginning serves well as a framework to the film.
269;looking at it from this perspective, this film is brilliantly done.
270;I was completely prepared for the style and was also told that that was it's weakness(extended camera shots).
271;My favorite Hitchcock, with Notorious being excellent as well.
272;Great mix of characters and personalities.
273;"Alfred Hitchcock's first color movie, ""Rope,"" explores a rare but disturbing motivation for murder: mere thought."
274;Rope examines, via its morally diverse cast, both sides of this thorny fence.
275;a thriller in reverse, the movie begins with a murder.
276;Placing the murder minutes after the opening titles compels the viewer to focus on motivation.
277;People will arrive at the scene of the crime, a beautiful apartment that breathtakingly overlooks downtown New York, soon.
278;"And David, now hidden in the large chest that will soon provide the party's centerpiece, gets condemned as one of the ""weaklings."""
279;Finally, Brandon and Philip's inspiration, Rupert Cadell, played by a mesmerizing Jimmy Stewart in his first Hitchcock role, shows up.
280;"Someone tells him, ""it's good to see you again."""
281;"Brandon brings up ""the perfect murder"" and his beliefs about superiority."
282;He even adds in some bone.
283;chilling nuances of his own.
284;David's father, also an invitee, protests and demands that they stop their macabre conversation.
285;I highly recommend purchasing this now while it is still available in this format.
286;Rope and Lifeboat are, in my estimation, two of Hitchcock's best.
287;Both movies are done using one set/backdrop.
288;The dynamics among the cast is superb.
289;Rope, a thriller from Alfred Hitchcock, is based on the Leopold.
290;Hitchcock decided to make Rope a bit of an experimental film, filmed with one long set, so there are several pauses where the camera actually goes in back of a character.
291;While this was a unique way to create the film, it does have its advantages.
292;Rope is more a psychological thriller about whether the two men will get caught than whether they actually did it, and it examines what goes through the conscious of those who have killed.
293;the murder is committed within moments after the opening credits, as the two friends kill David and then put his body in the very spot where people will later gather for a party.
294;Brandon is sly, sneaky, and has a malicious and dark humor throughout.
295;He cleverly has everything all planned out, and can deflect questions and suspicion with ease.
296;But, will he be able to outwit the equally resourceful Rupert?
297;the skill in this film is clearly in a superb screenplay.
298;"Some viewers might not like the fact that there is little movement, or ""action"", but the exceptional feeling of suspense builds as more and more pieces of the puzzle come to light."
299;"The script is quite amazing, and leads to a suspenseful ""cat and mouse"" game between Brandon and Rupert."
300;"The last twenty minutes of the film are superbly crafted and written
I:41981;301;over all, this is a highly overlooked classic from the master of suspense.
I:41981;302;Vertigo, with Stewart, is Hitchcock's greatest film and on of the three or four best ever, but Rope is a worthy setting for Stewart's talents.
I:41981;303;The story doesn't need telling here"
304;jimmy Stewart is at his best in this thriller.
305;Get some popcorn, sit back and enjoy.
306;"Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rope"" (1948) is a claustrophobic masterpiece ."
307;it may be Hitchcock's greatest movie.
308;It's an amazing achievement of controlled tension.
309;It reflects the direction of the film because we're about to get inside the minds, motivations, and the personalities of the characters.
310;and revel in their superiority.
311;to make matters even more horrifying, Brandon and Philip are throwing a dinner party and inviting David's family, his girlfriend (Janet), the girlfriend's ex.
312;but even the cool and calm Brandon has moments of panic.
313;"When David's father asks where his son is, Brandon stammers: ""I thought he was coming with you!"
314;one of the greatest actors in American history .
315;Brandon has spoken of you.
316;the commanding personality of Rupert begins to melt Brandon.
317;He joins Philip as the weight of his crime is reflected back to him in the presence of his mentor.
318;a naturally suspicious and cunningly observant man .
319;"he comes up with gems like this: ""You're more than unusually allergic to the truth tonight Philip."
320;We really enjoyed watching it.
321;1948's ROPE is a thoroughly enthralling and disturbing look at a thrill killing perpetrated by two prep.
322;This film has often been characterized notably only as Hitchcock's great experiment.
323;minute takes contrary to his stylistic use of effective story telling through editing.
324;there is a bit of both purposeful and today inadvertant comic relief in this film, the former through a prudish, wheedling maid, and the latter by the utter hilarity of the way these college kids live throw a party, with champagne suits.
325;The funny thing with Rope is that from the beginning you know how it's going to play out, but the great part is watching it actually happen.
326;Oh this one's another good one.
327;And for VERY good reason.
328;I won't repeat all the summaries, just agree that its a film worth a look, an overlooked Hitchcock gem.
329;sPOILER:The screenwriter made an interesting point about the murder shown in the opening scene.
330;it succeeds on many levels the running time of this film is 1 hour 37 minutes and includes about 14 or 15 fades through various means, usually with the camera lens pulling into either someones back or a piece of set furniture.
331;This is one of Hitchcock's more creative films.
332;The dialog is probably the best piece of writing in any of Hitchcock's films.
333;"The Lady Vanishes still the best writing overall, ""Rope"" is not far behind."
334;top acting is shamelessly entertaining, you suspect Hitchcock was having a lot of fun making this technically complicated film.
335;"If you love cinema, you'll love ""Rope."""
336;As you probably know, this was Hitchcock's first color film, and he tried the experiment of filming it in as close to one continuous take as he could.
337;Generally, this is handled well, although a couple of times, coming out of the break the characters are not quite in their previous positions.
338;The film is set entirely in Granger and Dall's apartment, with most of the action taking place in their living room.
339;this being a Hitchcock film, there are some good touches, including the scene where the maid slowly clears plates and dishes from the box containing the body, while the other characters are deep in conversation, and nearly opens it before being stopped.
340;The movie always retains your interest from the shocking beginning to the surprising conclusion.
341;Mr. Hitchcock has done it yet again.
342;i gave the film four stars because Dall, Granger, the screenwriter and the composer of the piece on the piano played by Granger liked men.
343;This was an important cinematic experiment, and a gem in Hitchcock's collection.
344;The script is very good but not quite dynamic enough, considering that the movie is really all script, moving from one dialogue to another, mostly in a single room.
345;But, Alfred Hitchcock, the master of suspense also has many more masterpieces.
346;They kill him for the trills, excitement, and for superiority.
347;They invite friends including David's family.
348;And they eat and place food on top of the chest with David's dead body in it.
349;the movie is so fascinating and original because it takes place the whole time in an apartement room.
350;the acting is wonderful with everyone convincing for their parts.
351;the movie also has suspense because of these psychopaths.
352;But, in my opinion, Hitchcock movies should give you thrills because what happens in them could happen in reality.
353;This is a Hitchcock must see.
354;The murder considered as one of the finest arts.
355;A brilliant essay to prove the primacy of certain superior human beings respect others of minor intellectual punch.
356;also owns intelligence, refinement, scrutinizing mind and culture who eventually will face and unmask them in a vivid tour de force performance of James Stewart.
357;He is moving and brilliant.
358;This movie is a great take on Leopold and Loeb.
359;Some may argue there is nothing witty about murder, which you see in this film in the first few minutes committed by two elegantly dressed and well groomed handsome men on another elegantly dressed and handsome man in a well appointed apartment with a magnificent view of the city.
360;And what if you are among the most intelligent and well educated individual on earth, doesn't that make you better than others and give you the right to make decisions over others lives?
361;Richly photographed in colour, with outstanding actors.
362;But the story itself is so well done.
363;It's like Hitchcock practiced with this movie and then made Dial M for Murder where he perfected it.
364;The story starts out chilling, and continues all the way throughout.
365;It's definitely worth a view and stands up as a great flick today.
366;The men's tyrannical experiment transforms into something of a sickly alluring game and then, on satiric terms, emerges as a send.
367;Apart from everything else, this breed of black comedy is delicious.
368;It is a taut and riveting psychological thriller, shot nearly in real time and just a few very long takes within an apartment, giving it a claustrophobic immediacy.
369;James Stewart gives one of his best performances.
370;It certainly is an interesting way to start a film and it catches the viewer's attention but the film never fulfills its potentional.
371;It becomes a psychological study of human nature without really coming to any conclusion.
372;The intrigue and twist is that Brando and Phillip are having a dinner party that evening.
373;one funny aside is that when dinner is served, Rupert immediately lights up a cigarette.
374;Also interesting is the exact relationship of Brandon and Phillip.
375;Hitchcock is settling accounts with the united States in 1948, with the social Darwinism that has always been rampant, and in some period triumphant, in the USA.
376;Fundamentally it is the idea that only good human beings, honest human beings succeed in society because they are chosen by God, hence they are superior in ethical values.
377;masters are the rich and that young rich man believes he can kill another he considers inferior, except that he does it out of some challenge to provoke his own society.
378;The killed young man is a member of that top society.
379;Hitchcock finds it extremely funny to play on words and to create situations that become qui pro quos for us.
380;But He also brings in an old teacher of these young men who had philosophically taught them that the superior people have the right to dominate, in a way or another, the inferior people in our society.
381;Bringing this man in this party was the supreme achievement, and the supreme danger, for the killer because he is known as a dubitative and curious and scrutinizing and inquisitive mind that can read between lines and find out the truth even where it is not present.
382;He is a conjuror of the truth.
383;The twist is within a good protestant approach: if one really knows who is inferior, they would in that reasoning have the right.
384;The performances were so good to the point as if a camera is not even there!!!
385;Totally believable and scary at the same time.
386;fooled or not, still, it's clever and cinematic!!!
387;acted, but it was worth watching.
388;This kind of film is very rare and there is no other film like it.
389;How wonderful that they interviewed Farley Granger!The thing about ROPE is, I can watch this film over and over again and still my eye catches something new.
390;Just wash your tv screen and your glasses and sit with your favorite bowl of popcorn and enjoy.
391;This is a good classic made in the late 1940's and is in color, which is hard to find.
392;It also gives viewers a good picture of the young Jimmy Stewart, who is a professor that is first suspects and figure out the strangling of one of his students by the two students that live in the apartment.
393;thsi movie also puts on a lot of attention to the philospher Fredrich Nietzsche, who idea was that it is best for only the most powerfull people should live.
394;If a viewer could understand for a moment what must make film with a single setting good it is the story and the dialog.
395;Rope is superbly philosophical, diving into the idea of a master race, and then sucessfully portraying to the viewer how the society would react to the philosophy found real.
396;If you enjoy a movie which is witty, and fantastic in its psychological depth, may I recommend, Rope.
397;rope, based on a play of the same name, which was in turn based on a real murder case in 1924, opens with two friends .
398;a party partially in their murdered friend's honor.
399;played exceedingly well by James Stewart in one of his best.
400;As the two students engage him in a discussion about Nietzschian philosophy, and specifically philosophy of the ubermensch (overman or superman), Stewart's character puts two and two together.
401;The tension is so tight you hold your breath for the last half.
402;as well as the homosexual overtones, but the real genius in Rope comes from the acting and direction.
403;As opposed to today's roller.
404;Anyone can toy with an audience, using special effects, explosions, and fast cars to create action, but true suspense .
405;that hourglass feeling of grains of sand building a mountain .
406;takes talent, and Rope readily uses that effect, thanks largely to the preformances of the three main characters.
407;in addition, Stewart's ultimate conclusions on Nietzschian philosophy offer a refreshing step away from those who would indict it solely on the basis of notions (and books) like the Will to Power .
408;Hume Cronyn offers some genuine .
409;Also included is Rope's unique theatrical trailer, a kind of mini.
410;if you are a fan of Alfred Hitchcock, or just like great acting and pianowire.
411;One of my favorite movies!
412;It seems a lot of folks don't talk about this one so much when speaking about Hitchcock but this movie is just a feast of delicious drama.
413;Better than other Hitchcock movies?
414;Just watching the events unfold is gripping.
415;Besides being a great story that holds your attention from the beginning, Hitchcock has something to say about the power of (bad) ideas and the influence of educators on the young.
416;The film begins with a great setting and would catch any viewers' attention.
417;Brandon, played by Josh Dall and Phillip, played by Farley Granger are the killers to this bizarre style of murder.
418;The suspense and plot aspects of the movie were well done.
419;acting also played a faultfinding role in this film.
420;Dall, Granger, and Stewart did an okay job, but improvement is definitely needed.
421;the camera work engulfed a sense of uniqueness and captured my attention.
422;Hitchcock's unique style of switching scenes was greatly productive.
423;minute film reels as the filmmaking process.
424;The camera work was very similar to Alfred Hitchcock's films Psycho and The Birds, which also had extraordinary camera functions and fantastic angles.
425;Rope's camera work was exceptional, however, Hitchcock's decision to not use a soundtrack is unquestionably taking away from a movie that had potential.
426;This Hitchcock thriller is about two men who kill a third man, partly for the thrill but mostly because they believe themselves to be intellectual supermen with the right (if not the duty) to rid the world of their inferiors.
427;the camera work is quintessential Hitchcock, focusing sometimes on the main action and sometimes on the sidelines for added suspense.
428;Excellent characters and performances carry a movie that is rather simple in its plot, set and film style.
429;if you liked Dial M for Murder, you will likely enjoy this Hitchcock film.
430;This claustrophobic tale takes place in one evening in an upscale New York City apartment as two friends celebrate their perfect murder with a dinner party.
431;but also because they believe themselves intelligent and superior enough to get away with it.
432;Brandon, on the other hand, is thrilled at having done it, and can't help but make suggestive comments in front of the group.
433;had I seen this film a few years ago I'm not sure I'd have enjoyed it very much.
434;On the surface it's not a very exciting film, but it's actually a very well.
435;but the strange behavior of the pair serves to heighten the tension and build suspense throughout the film.
436;The transitions from one roll to the next are a bit odd, but nonetheless clever.
437;while it wasn't a commercial or critical success when released, and even Hitchcock wasn't particularly pleased with it, it's still an interesting and entertaining film.
438;"I agree with all the people who consider ""Rope"" the most underrated Hitchcock of all."
439;Even after you've seen it thirty or so times like I have and the suspense factor is irrelevant, you can still marvel at the brilliant manner in which the whole thing was executed.
440;The glorious Technicolor here is worthy of the name, and although the monophonic soundtrack is nothing to get excited about (multichannel soundtracks came with the widescreen era) at least it's crisp.
441;clear, and free of distortion.
442;The extra features are awesome, particularly the theatrical trailer which in effect provides an additional scene to the story!
443;movie purist like me, you'll be happy to see the original Warner Bros. logos restored at the beginning and the end instead of the tacked.
444;Glad to see this masterpiece getting the high.
445;In each of the plays, suspense is the chief element.
446;"In ""Rope"" we watch a dinner party held in a New York apartment."
447;The dialogue may be unnatural, and the cast members uneasy, but the man in charge of filming certainly knew how to build suspense.
448;I have to say I enjoyed this Film as much as his other works.
449;Many of the special features included on this Blu.
450;Like most Hitchcock films there is plenty of comic relief to break up the tension filled parts of the movie.
451;The color and picture are great on the Blu.
452;"Hitchcock bought the rights to a very successful Broadway play called ""Rope."""
453;Actually, it's not all that bad, but this is far from being his greatest film.
454;"In fact, the thing that marks him as a great director is his obsession with visual imagery and montage
I:41981;455;so, if it's good, it's because it's a good play.
I:41981;456;I watch this movie several times.
I:41981;457;It's a full screen format.
I:41981;458;This method of filming was largely an experiment by Hitchcock.
I:41981;459;They then host a dinner party as a way to see if the murder can go undetected so they can feel like they committed the """"perfect murder""""."""
460;The music is pretty good as well.
461;the plot is sick and twisted, but I find this an interesting movie.
462;The suspense is classic Hitchcock.
463;i highly recommend seeing this movie.
464;I'll let you read the blurb from the company if you want to see the story line.
465;This is one of Hitchcocks beautiful little gems.
466;the story is based on real life characters and the story line is based on real events as well.
467;the actors do an excellent job.
468;You will have to be the one to figure that out.Yes its worth having this little gem in anyone's collection.
469;In a good movie I look for good acting, a good story line and a good setting.
470;I also look to make sure that all these elements can withstand the test of time.
471;I'm a movie lover but I found it hard to stay awake during this one.
472;"the plot of the movie was somewhat interesting
I:41981;473;Many people seem to enjoy this movie because of the fact that Hitchcock was the director and they enjoy his works.
I:41981;474;Cadell, a bright man, realizes that something funny is going on and investigates.
I:41981;475;this is an entertaining movie.
I:41981;476;It rates 4 stars with me, at least.
I:41981;477;ingenious idea almost perfectly executed.
I:41981;478;great idea, great acting, great directing, editing, writing.
I:41981;479;Some people might say it's cheesy or boring, but it's classic Hitchcock.
I:41981;480;I highly recommend the watch and possible collection.
I:41981;481;the film is told in typical Hitchcock suspenseful fashion, the audience often becoming privy to things that the characters don't know.
I:41981;482;The audience is held in suspense, wondering if she will open the trunk and see what is there.
I:41981;483;Of the two young murderers, Brandon is the brash one with the devil may care attitude, while Philip has more of a conscience over what they've done.
I:41981;484;I've watched it twice already, and love it.
I:41981;485;Their interactions are of the intimate variety.
I:41981;486;but not once in the film will you hear the subject mentioned in any way.
I:41981;487;this is a great addition to Hitchcock's legacy, and one I would watch over and over.
I:41981;488;The conversations in this movie are riddled with subtext that is probably meant to add to the suspense, but can also be experienced as hilariously witty.
I:41981;489;Now I can share it with younger generation.
I:41981;490;This was a very good story, actually a play.
I:41981;491;The beauty and suspense of Hitchcock films is evident in this one, with only a handful of actors, set in primarily one room.
I:41981;492;Hitchcock was intrigued by the play, based on a real murder from 1924.
I:41981;493;The other man is so cocky and arrogant you want to slap his face, yet his arrogance is amazing to watch.
I:41981;494;He believes himself superior, and the things he does as he proceedes to have a dinner party with David's fiancee, relatives, and friends, is amazing"
495;This is one of Hitchock's best films .
496;"they are all great, but this one and ""Rear Window"" are my favourites."
497;"there's quite a bit more ""story"" to the story, in the relationship between the two main characters ."
498;Definitely ranks as one of the top 5.
499;there are also a number of extras on the disc that are very well.
500;Dall is charismatic and frightening as the more confident of the killers but Granger's weakling character is too highly.
501;All of the supporting actors overact throughout with the exception of Cedric Hardwicke, who is wonderful as a concerned party guest.
502;"the dialogue is too perfect and stagy with everyone taking turns speaking politely and with perfectly measured wit
I:41981;503;This is probably the oldest film I've ever recommended, an Alfred Hitchcock film from 1948 starring Jimmy Stewart.
I:41981;504;But despite its age it's definitely one of Mr. Hitchcock's most suspenseful films, right up there with Rear Window and Vertigo.
I:41981;505;They view themselves as superior to other people, and want to prove it by committing the perfect murder and getting away with it.
I:41981;506;Since Rupert is the one who taught them all about Nietzsche's philosophy, he is eager to impress the professor, partly, it seems, because, to him, Rupert's approval will justify the murder.
I:41981;507;Rope was a film that suitably impressed me the first time I saw it (on YouTube of all places!)
I:41981;508;Very gripping from beginning to end and it must've been quite daring at the time to have the killers be the protagonists, and have them be strangely likable (if utterly unsympathetic of course).
I:41981;509;The structure is also unique to me.
I:41981;510;We know who the murderers are, as well as the how and the why, and even where the body is hidden.
I:41981;511;It's subtly jarring in a way and helps set him apart from the other party guests as Brandon and Phillip's nemesis and also helps underscore how his relationship to them unfolds .
I:41981;512;He has a laid back, lazy, subtle and sly aura of what I can only call benevolent menace to him (if that makes any sense) and it helps keep the audience (as well as Brandon and Phillip!)
I:41981;513;guessing as to how much Rupert knows.
I:41981;514;His end speech is one of the most utterly powerful and emotional performances in his career I think.
I:41981;515;John Dall as Brandon deserves special mention as well.
I:41981;516;It was a gift for my daughter.
I:41981;517;She really likes the movie, which is one of my favorite Hitchcock thrillers.
I:41981;518;i enjoy observing the growth of Alfred Hitchcock as a film.
I:41981;519;maker, because as his experience develops, my appreciation of the art of film.
I:41981;520;making enables richer enjoyment of all cinema.
I:41981;521;an early Hitchcock film worth seeing.
I:41981;522;Suspense comes through the subtle cinematography, and the hideousness of the minds of the characters.
I:41981;523;The writing, the suspense, the acting, and directing are amazing.
I:41981;524;This is a film that you can watch again and again because of how it so thoroughly draws you in.
I:41981;525;It is truly a great piece of art.
I:41981;526;Along with David's dad, I had quite enough.
I:41981;527;I love Hitchcock movies, always have and always will.
I:41981;528;I think this movie is very underrated by many of his fans based on other reviews I've read on the web.
I:41981;529;Actually, this is one of my favorite Hitchcock movies.
I:41981;530;I highly recommend it because the story is one that just pulls you in via typical Hitchcock fashion.
I:41981;531;Jimmy Stewart movies are all great,but you have Hitchcock and Stewart they are great together.
I:41981;532;They are confident that nothing can go wrong.
I:41981;533;The chest is placed obviously in the middle of the room.
I:41981;534;he moves all the food and drink from the dining area so guests must face the chest and the murderes can delight in knowing there is a hidden body.
I:41981;535;cadell keeps Brandon and Phillip on their toes with his observations and deductions.
I:41981;536;The suspense builds and deepens as Alfred Hitchcock's unique dark humor blossoms in this little.
I:41981;537;one of the most widely known directors of all time .
I:41981;538;In 1948 Hitchcock directed the moral thriller Rope.
I:41981;539;In my opinion Rope is not only a very splendid film, but rather thought provoking as well.
I:41981;540;The methods and camera style involved in this film make it one of a kind.
I:41981;541;The plot is rather intriguing making the film a suspenseful thriller.
I:41981;542;this movie keeps you in suspense.
I:41981;543;One of the scenes in the movie that I thought was nail.
I:41981;544;The camera work was done very well in this scene.
I:41981;545;The camera work in this film is uncommon.
I:41981;546;The result of this impressive camera work is that the story is shot in real time.
I:41981;547;The actors cast in this film are superb and plausible, but James Stewarts performance as Rupert stands out.
I:41981;548;The scenes with Stewart and his two murdering former students are extremely gripping and believable.
I:41981;549;He solves the mystery of Davids strange disappearance in a way that is natural to his character.
I:41981;550;a good thriller film appeals to people of all generations, no matter what decade it was made.
I:41981;551;A film with excellent directing, successful actors, interesting plot, and unusual camera work is always worth seeing.
I:41981;552;After viewing this film I now understand why """"Rope,"""" along with other Hitchcock films, remains a timeless thriller."""
553;You see, these two perfectly preened dandies fancy themselves the elite and above the law and other nuisances meant for the dullards and nincompoops that comprise the vast majority of humanity.
554;What's clever and somewhat interesting about the story is how they decide to host a party in the very room where the body is hidden.
555;The view gives the scene a surrealistic feel that, overall, is a plus.
556;Worth seeing, but mainly for what must have been daring subjects at the time.
557;some thing that you can enjoy if you like mysters and the people who one the movie and a good picture
558;Its A good Halloween Movie.
559;I have never seen this one so will look forward to another good mystery.
560;Alfred Hitchcock movies are great suspense flicks with little violence or bad language.
561;"The film ""Rope"" was a remarkable movie directed by Alfred Hitchcock in 1948."
562;Hitchcock gives this film an unpredictable twist.
563;The camera, acting and sound all add to the suspense of the film.
564;the film holds a strong suspenseful situation in an evening's dinner party.
565;The action is captured in one room and is filmed to give a real time setting.
566;Hitchcock composed the film as if it was taken in one shot, but realistically it was developed from many ten minute shots.
567;The real feel of time gave this film a memorable outcome.
568;in recent films the suspense of the murders are held to the end of the movie to give the climax.
569;"For example, in the popular movie ""Scream"" many people are killed throughout the movie but the director hides the discovery of the killer giving us the suspense of not knowing."
570;Because of this uncertainty, the viewers were kept guessing at all times.
571;"one of the ways Hitchcock builds the suspense in ""Rope"" is by making the audience identify with the murders' fear of discovery."
572;One example of this takes place in the scene following dinner.
573;Hitchcock makes it positive that the body of David (Dick Hogan) was going to be found when the maid returns the books to chest.
574;Brandon, relaxed, pushes down the chest and the scene continues.
575;I was able to relate with the stress that Brandon was receiving from Philip.
576;I interacted with the film because I witness people often that are drunk and can't control the things they say.
577;He continues to drink because he was stressing over a situation.
578;The movie once again captured suspense.
579;The movie has added features that keep the suspense rolling.
580;It is committed by the superior to the inferior.
581;"In my opinion, this Hitchcock film was unique
I:41981;582;Rope is incomparable to any other movie I have viewed.
I:41981;583;Brandon (John Dall) and Phillip (Farley Granger) feel they are superior to their friends in every way.
I:41981;584;If not, which will give them away first, Brandon's arrogance or Phillip's guilty conscience?This is a very intriguing psychological thriller.
I:41981;585;While those transitions (to reload film) are obvious, the constant rolling of the camera adds to the suspense.
I:41981;586;There are some strange camera angles at times, but they build the suspense as well.
I:41981;587;The limited set is an added bonus as it focuses our attention to build the suspense.
I:41981;588;the acting is absolutely wonderful.
I:41981;589;While it does suffer at times from the overacting prevalent at the time (at least by today's standards), it captures the characters and their emotions perfectly.
I:41981;590;This is especially true of John Dall and Fraley Granger who bring such nuance to their characters we always know their thoughts.
I:41981;591;Their two characters are rich enough for some pretty in depth character studies.
I:41981;592;to be honest, I found how much I enjoyed this movie a little disturbing.
I:41981;593;It will entertain you and make you think for some time afterward.
I:41981;594;The merits of Hitchcock's experimental film ROPE have been endlessly debated.
I:41981;595;What I find fascinating about this film is what it reveals about the skill of the actors, especially Jimmy Stewart.
I:41981;596;In an ordinary film, a performance is as much the creation of the director and editor as it is the actor.
I:41981;597;As in a live play, they are on their own to maintain the pace and the intensity of the drama.
I:41981;598;Farley Grainger and John Dall tear right into the opening, visibly sweating their way through the early murder scene.
I:41981;599;Where the others are intense and theatrical, Stewart is comfortable and deceptively easy.
I:41981;600;Watch how skillfully he alters the tension and shifts the mood with his control of movement and voice.
I:41981;601;This is one of Stewart's most underrated performances.
I:41981;602;He enters this stagy drama, takes a deep breath, and makes it fascinating and fun to watch.
I:41981;603;this is still Hitchcock, of course.
I:41981;604;Note the pacing of the camera, the elegant set and moody lighting, and the cleverly suspenseful use of music.
I:41981;605;But ROPE I think is most interesting for this unique opportunity to study Jimmy Stewart's skill as an actor.
I:41981;606;watch it again and see what you think!
I:41981;607;This 1948 Hitchcock film is mostly noted for its technical achievements.
I:41981;608;Hitchcock filmed this story, about two well.
I:41981;609;Using some very inventive cutting techniques the film appears as if it was filmed all in one take.
I:41981;610;This is more impressive when you see the actual size that color film cameras were during this time period.
I:41981;611;They were absolutely enormous, bigger than a man standing.
I:41981;612;Another achievement of the film is in terms of lighting.
I:41981;613;It is a testament to this achievment that upon first viewing you don't really notice the effect.
I:41981;614;Yet, the filmakers took great pains to get it to look realistic, staging numerous reshoots for the final few scenes.
I:41981;615;This creates an excellent mix of suspense and the macabre.
I:41981;616;Throughout the party the murderers become more unraveled even as they are enjoying their little game.
I:41981;617;all of the acting is quite good.
I:41981;618;The two murderer (John Dall and Farley Granger) do a fine job of playing intelectual, society playboys, with a desire for excitement.
I:41981;619;The suspense is built, then lessoned by some well timed comedy, and then built again to a final crescendo.
I:41981;620;Hitchcock was excellent as a technical director and allowed his actors the breathing room they needed for fine performances.
I:41981;621;In the end I left the picture feeling more excited about the superb storytelling than any particular technical achievement.
I:41981;622;It is a testament to his craft, that Hitchock allows you to leave a picture being enamored with his story over his technical achievements.
I:41981;623;Some of the greatest effects are those you don't notice because they seem so natural and real.
I:41981;624;Although James Stewarts presence is so wholesome and devoid of sex that any notion of the characters sexuality is more a point of trivia at this point.
I:41981;625;alfred Hitchock manages a triumph of technical brilliance and suspense in Rope.
I:41981;626;It's influence in the technical realm of cinema far outshines any effect the story has on future movies.
I:41981;627;This is a shame, for the story being told is one of suspense, macabre and excitement.
I:41981;628;Rope is easily one of the best suspense movies I've ever seen.
I:41981;629;Every time I see this movie, I notice something new that illustrates Hitchcock's genius.
I:41981;630;Rope, a film based on a play and directed by Alfred Hitchcock, is a well.
I:41981;631;made thriller that entertains the spectator, but that is far from being perfect.
I:41981;632;i must say that the story is original, and that the beginning is quite shocking.
I:41981;633;From my point of view, you will also enjoy this whodunnit, specially if you are fond of Hitchcock movies, and don't mind the fact that albeit good, this is not one of his best films.
I:41981;634;belen AlcatPS: I give """"Rope"""" 3.5 stars."""
635;"Throw Them a RopeThe movie, ""Rope"" is a film that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish."
636;"Instead of a thriller with a lot of violence and action like many of Alfred Hitchcock's other movies ""Rope"" is more of a thinking thriller with a mean twist to it."
637;the occasional mysterious tune played on the piano by Phillip and the sound of silence is enough to keep one's heart beating, wondering what is to happen next.
638;"besides the occasional unsteadiness of the camera and a poor acting job by one or two of the actors, ""Rope"" turned out to be a good and exciting movie."
639;"the film ""Rope"" is a fast paced engaging movie and Hitchcock did a fine job of taking the play script and turning it into a film."
640;Wonderful take on the Leopold and Loeb story with two very good performances by John Dall and Edith Evanson, two actors I knew nothing about.
641;Still, the movie is worth watching for the shotmaking and the experimental no.
642;"Hitchcock said ""Rope"" was an ""experiment that didn't work out""."
643;Nevertheless, it's an interesting experiment and a reasonably good movie.
644;Certainly worth spending an hour and twenty minutes with.
645;Alfred Hitchcock's Rope, the first of what would eventually become four collaborative efforts with actor and close friend James Stewart, was based not only on a popular British play, Rope's End (the re.
646;five and Leopold was paroled in 1958 and moved to Puerto Rico).
647;Therefore everything rides on the performances of the three main leads and Stewart for one does so with gusto.
648;The final scene in which Stewart wrestles with himself over the gun is sheer brilliance.
649;Chilling and intriguing to the bitter end, Stewart's convincing performance truly makes this film the classic that it is.
650;phillip Morgan, played eloquently by then.
651;He just wants to dispose of the body and be done with it once and for all.
652;This of course would be the smart way to do it.
653;tale signs for a genius like Rupert to pick up on that something is amiss.
654;while seen only for the first few brief seconds of the picture after the opening credits, his presence is felt nonetheless throughout the entire film.
655;The presence of his `coffin' in the middle of the room amidst the social get.
656;to this day Rope remains one of director Alfred Hitchcock's most enduring and innovative motion picture drama.
657;In addition, Hitchcock creates the illusion, with some success, of one continuous shot.
658;It is rather obvious to audiences today that whenever a performer or a piece of furniture is moved in way of the camera so that it covers up the entire screen that it is Hitchcock's way of covering up splits in the film segments.
659;Much of the homoerotic dialogue and choreography of Patrick Hamilton's original play were cut from the final print of the film but Hitchcock however was able to keep the suggestion in the minds of audiences with the memories of Leopold and Loeb still fresh in their minds.
660;Rope, you can call that it is a great Hitchcock's experiment, or you may call that it is a nice play.
661;the most interesting and important character in the movie is a professor Rupert played by James Stewart.
662;He doubts and laughs everything, especially common sense.
663;a theme of this play is a moral.
664;It is very unusual and also effective to show this kind theme through a character like Rupert.
665;People, including myself, are more likely attracted by unhealthy, king and slave relationship between two wealthy, smart and good.
666;the other thing in the movie fascinates me is music by Poulenc, a French composer.
667;Actually that is the most fascinates me.
668;Rope is a great piece of film that really requires more than one viewing, even from people who may not have enjoyed it for its story.
669;the movie finishes and you realise 'hey, I forgot to look for the edits!'
670;Especially David's girlfriend Janet, she is quite a remarkable character, quirky, uncomfortable and strangely attractive even though she says the word 'chum' far too many times.
671;And also Rupert, played by the legendary James Stewart, his interaction with the other characters is priceless, in particular the way he makes fun of women's discussion techniques and how they don't really say anything worthwhile but yet they know exactly what they are talking about.
672;Keep trying, and eventually you'll see what the fuss is about, but by then you don't care because you've fallen in love with the movie as a piece of Hitchcock genius.
673;the suspense is maintained throughout.
674;well!I would recommend this movie for sure.
675;The two characters murder an old classmate for the fun and enjoyment of it then throw a party for the deceased's closest friends and relatives.
676;The one mistake the murderers make is inviting the inspiration of their crime to the post party.
677;i would recommend to any movie fan especially the Hitchcock lovers to go see this movie.
678;That along with a well thought out plot and storyline makes for a definite classic.
679;If it appears slow at times try to appreciate the camerawork and other subtleties that make all Hitchcock films brilliant.
680;To further increase the exhilaration of their dastardly deed, the duo deem it delicious to desecrate the dead by placing his body into a chest and serving their dinner party guests a banquet on its decorated top.
681;While those who are enlightened enough to realize that one is free to act according to their own volition because there are no such primitive or external constraints on behavior are deemed superior.
682;minute reels to give the illusion of one seamless, continuous take.
683;This forces the viewer to pay attention to every word and provides an eerie feeling that he/she is a witness to the murder and is a guest at the dinner party.
684;What also drives the film is its witty if not macabre dialogue that is punctuated with puns, innuendoes and double entendre.
685;It is also interesting to watch the professor engage Phillip and Brandon in the proverbial game of cat and mouse.
686;Likewise, the characters are richly developed and deep.
687;rope is Hitchcock's most underrated and unappreciated film.
688;Jimmie, as always, is perfect and it is he who steals the show.
689;Still the third act turns out to be quite suspenseful and is what made this film enjoyable.
690;Among the guests are the victim's father and a former teacher (James Stewart), whose philosophy, unknowlingly, inspired Brandon and Phillip to commit the murder.
691;The suspense is in the dialogue and there's also a surprising amount of humour.
692;And all the actors do a great job.
693;"to conclude, ""Rope"" is a great Hitchcock film."
694;The Bottom Line:John Dall is great but the movie's continuous.
695;Rope is a very subtle film that slowly, slowly rolls down hill, gathering layers as it goes.
696;the two pampered and immensely wealthy young men, the prototypes of Leopold (Phillip) and Brandon (Loeb) strangle a young man, David in their posh New York apartment, put his body in a large chest and hold a party for the dead boy's friends and family, the buffet being laid out right on top of the chest.
697;Loeb was handsome and Leopold decidedly plain, so Farley Granger with his beautiful face, perhaps is too much of an Adonis to resemble Leopold at least physically.
698;The two men are homosexuals but the subject is handled delicately.
699;But he'll make you hold your breath!
700;uninterrupted scenes, a directorial masterpiece.
701;This is a unique Hitchcock film.
702;The plot is very interesting and it evolves slowly but in a cunning way and Hitchcock proves that he can be a master of directing even if he is confined in a room.
703;They try to show there intelligence and superiority by inviting David's closest friends and family over for a party.
704;He was so cocky with his sly remarks about David, to the others at the party, that I hoped he got caught.
705;He was the enlightening teacher who thinks his views have meaning and importance.
706;throughout Hitchcock's film career, he has put together many masterpieces and classic film that people look back on still to this day.
707;"He is full of surprises in his films, bring never before seen work to his film era
I:41981;708;A very gimmicky film on a couple of levels.
I:41981;709;Hitchcock proves, yet again, that he's the Suspense Film Master.
I:41981;710;I kind of like him as a sinister character!
I:41981;711;Filmed on a single set, we see how this one.
I:41981;712;a. kind mystery unfolds via Hitchcock's hallmark methods replete with unique and creative scene changes, astounding dialogue and a sampling of some of the best cast of the day.
I:41981;713;one of the most thought provoking and suspenseful Hitchcock movies ever.
I:41981;714;not a huge financial success, but exceedingly well made
I:41981;715;the first time I saw this it was the best and even though the subject matter is dark it takes place during a more innocent time and I like that feeling.
I:41981;716;classic film shot in real time.
I:41981;717;For any film buff and/or Hitchcock fan, this is a must see.
I:41981;718;This offers a window into Hitch's genius: he was constantly trying to push the envelope and found many ways to do so.
I:41981;719;That being said, the acting is also above average, with the young Jimmy Stewart in a solid dramatic performance and the others, esp.
I:41981;720;Of these, ROPE is the most interesting.
I:41981;721;One of the five """"Lost Hitchcock"""" films that were unavailable for a couple of decades, it is primarily interesting for the way that Hitchcock wants to see what he can do with a set of self."""
722;It is fascinating figuring out how he deals with such problems as how to make the sky through the soundstage windows appear to be changing.
723;All in all, a very, fascinating film.
724;but Hitchcock at less than his very best is very, very worth watching.
725;So, in this film we see the Master at work, even if on one of his lesser creations.
726;but in fact he did a great deal more.
727;He dispensed with the usual cutting techniques and, for the first time in history, shot in ten.
728;This is the first movie done by Alfred Hitchcock that was done in color, following the infamous murderers Leonard and Leopold, great actors, great movie, completely done on a sound stage, all in Hitchcock style.
729;Coming off the success of two features with Ingrid Bergman (Spellbound .
730;Broken into 8 sections by seamingly unnoticed takes, Rope is an achievement in every sense of the word.
731;The constant positioning, the perfection of lines.
732;with that being said, there's an excellent plot as well.
733;recommended to all those that love fabulous direction, a gallant thriller, and an engaging story.
734;Alfred Hitchcock comes through with a great piece of work in his first ever color.
735;Brandon Shaw (John Dall) is very confident in his plan and seems to be poised to have everything go perfectly.
736;His partner Philip Morgan (Farley Granger) does an astonishing job acting as the nervous suspect who thinks that every coincidental incident means that their plan is falling apart.
737;hitchcock relates this film to human nature knowing that everyone loves to get away with something.
738;This part of the suspense comes from our ability to be an accomplice to murder, without suffering the consequences.
739;You will find yourself at the edge of your seat wondering if they can pull off this seemingly impossible task.
740;james Stewart does an excellent job playing the role of a retired schoolteacher (Rupert Cadell) who acts more like a detective than a teacher.
741;As the film goes on, the suspense builds up.
742;"alfred Hitchcock also uses the ""one shot"" idea so it gives the impression of real."
743;This was done very well and was a strong point in the movie.
744;This film is loaded with excitement and you will find yourself anxiously anticipating what will happen next throughout the entire movie.
745;This aspect of the movie is very intriguing, and I am surprised that this is not done more often.
746;I would recommend this movie to anyone who has not watched it before.
747;Everyone should experience watching a film composed like this one.
748;I was stunned at its brilliance when I finally saw it.
749;Rope is a very entertaining and suspenseful film.
750;The casting is great, as is the acting.
751;Jimmy Stewart does a great job in his role.
752;eroticism of the two main protagonists is another interesting angle.
753;It's really a very good movie and I definitely recommend it.
754;I read about this film in Leonard Maltin's Video Guide and was intrigued by the fact that it's done in long takes.
755;The choreography of the camera is amazing the way it follows everyone and is so fluid.
756;The story itself is very interesting and looks at the importance of human life and the idea behind guilt.
757;still worthwhile watching of course !!!!
758;Those who appreciate the old films and Jimmy Stewart should find this film very interesting and entertaining.
759;It holds the interest even though it takes place in a single setting!
760;I thought the acting was superb.
761;I vividly remembered that scene of the maid cleaning up after the party .
762;"the camera nailed down to one spot
I:41981;763;You watch her up close as she picks up plates from atop the chest and then she walks into the distance to the kitchen and then she comes back to us to take more things off the chest and then goes away again, back and forth, again and again, cleaning, working her way closer and closer .
I:41981;764;all the while you know what's inside that chest and that, once she clears it off, if she were to look inside.
I:41981;765;There's an intelligent design behind the unfolding of the story that is a character in itself.
I:41981;766;It has a tangible personality.
I:41981;767;And that character is rarely as vivid and forceful than when it's Hitchcock.
I:41981;768;i saw Rope for the second time just a few days ago and it is even better than I remembered.
I:41981;769;He can seem dark and brooding while conveying enough inner goodness to keep the audience's affection, if that was the goal in choosing Stewart.
I:41981;770;still, ROPE is Hitchcock using all his powers of suspense and his genius for direction.
I:41981;771;Also be sure to watch the extras, there is a very illuminating little documentary piece you should see.
I:41981;772;Rope is an excellent experimental film from the master of suspense.
I:41981;773;This is quite cleverly done, but once you've seen it you will always spot where the cuts are.
I:41981;774;For a film made in 1949 the colour print is very good.
I:41981;775;As always Hitchcock produces a couple of classic scenes, perhaps the best of which is where it looks as the housemaid might might find the body.
I:41981;776;This is brilliantly filmed and a typical piece of Hitchcock magic.
I:41981;777;So as always there is more going on in a Hitchcock film than first meets the eye.
I:41981;778;ROPE is a very experimental.
I:41981;779;ROPE is a highly entertaining and suspenseful film.
I:41981;780;The casting is great, with Dall perfect as the psychotic murderer, Sir Cedric Hardwicke memorable as the victim's father, and Stewart.
I:41981;781;well, you can't say too many good things about him, though it takes him a while to appear.
I:41981;782;While not as good as some of Hitchcock's earlier (THE 39 STEPS, REBECCA) or later (VERTIGO, NORTH BY NORTHWEST) masterpieces, ROPE is very well made film, perfect for fans of Hitchcock, Stewart, or suspense films in general.
I:41981;783;Little known film from Hitchcock's early days loaded with suspense.
I:41981;784;This contributes nicely to the tension.
I:41981;785;Another nice technical touch exploits the location of Brandon and Philip's apartment high in New York and close to some neon signage.
I:41981;786;this is Hitchcock's first movie collaboration with James Stewart who does an excellent job playing a smart intellectual type who gets a nasty shock when he finds two of his students putting into action the clever sounding but disgusting ideas he thought he was so smart in expounding.
I:41981;787;The movie is a interesting moral fable and also a nice, if slightly stagy thriller.
I:41981;788;The Alfred Hitchcock movie """"Rope"""" is a film about two men Brandon and Phillip (played by John Dall and Farley Granger) who strangled their friend David."""
789;As a bonus to their crime, the murderers invited over David's family and friends for dinner.
790;Hitchcock didn't really keep his audience on the edge of their seats.
791;"That scene of ""Rope"" absolutely made the movie horrendous."
792;just enough because we do not need to move very far to face basic and suspensful plot elements, in fact, they are all the more poignant when we see them magnified in a particular setting.
793;but it is a great film nontheless, featuring great performances and witty dialogue.
794;James stewart is always fun to watch and his understated performance drives the show.
795;I would highly recommend 'rope' as one of hitchcock's more interesting film expeditions.
796;minded application of just such a sophisticated theory is precisely what Hitchcock does, brilliantly, in ROPE.
797;what really knocks this fantastic premise out of the ballpark is the inclusion of the one.
798;We are taken aback by Stewart's character's words, precisely because Stewart is such a likeable actor.
799;This film is one of my favorite Hitchcock films (with Jimmy Stewart)!
800;This story has a pace and filmography that leaves one on the edge of one's seat chomping popcorn, rather than closing one's eye waiting for an expensive climax!PS .
801;I was not even born when this movie was made, but am a true fan and recommend the movie to everyone I know.
802;"Alfred Hitchcock's timeless (Yet forgotten) masterpiece, ""Rope"" is probably one of my all."
803;time favorite films, it's good, dark comedy and drama, the acting is excellent and the story is cold and chilling and one that you won't easily forget.
804;the film features outstanding actors, Cedric Hardwicke as Mr. Kentley, Constance Collier as Mrs. Atwater, Douglas Dick as Kenneth, Joan Chandler as Janet, Dick Hogan as David and Edith Evanson who plays one of the greatest characters, the housemaid Mrs. Wilson.
805;"One thing that makes Rope so unique is the fact that it happens in ""real time"" meaning that there are no scene changes and although it is quite obvious what techniques have been used for this, it is still amusing."
806;The story isn't one of Hitchcock's most thrilling, but some scenes are pure suspense and the movie is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat.
807;i'd recommend this movie to Hitchcock fans and filmlovers who want a good crime/mystery film.
808;Brandon's demeanor showed how proud he was of the perfect murder they had committed.
809;Brandon and Philip appeared to have very complex minds behind their reasoning for this murder which was simply out of their feeling of superiority to David.
810;"This film shows some very ""twisted"" behavior but portrays it very well."
811;Brandon, the confident one, went as far as telling a story of strangling a chicken, a story which hit too close to home.
812;Despite all of these things there was a great deal of suspense throughout the film.
813;This was a nice surprise especially considering the murder had already taken place.
814;all in all the actors portrayed their characters very well.
815;"From the murderers
I:41981;816;although I believe this thriller would have been better as a stage play, the suspense keeps the audience interested.
I:41981;817;To find the answers to these and other intriguing mysteries, enjoy Hitchcock's classic thriller of the """"perfect crime""""."""
818;I guess maybe it's because I'm such a huge fan of Hitchcock's.
819;Rope, Alfred Hitchcock's first color film, is an adaptation of the play by Patrick Hamilton, which was re.
820;Nevertheless, it's the continous takes which make the film so spectacular.
821;be fiance, his best friend, and the murderous duo's eccentric old professor, who they think would approve of their scheme.
822;His best friend and reluctant partner.
823;This is one of my favorite performances from Mr. Stewart.
824;He plays his part with a devilishly easygoing, intelligent suavete and far more reserve than you would usually see from Stewart.
825;considering the movie was released in 1948, the fact that the script retains the implied homosexuality between the murderers from Hamilton's play is a bold move.
826;don't begin your exploration of Hitchcock's works with this movie.
827;"Opt instead for something like ""Vertigo"" or even Hitchcock's previous masterpiece, ""Notorious,"" which is cleverly referenced at one point in the film when Stewart's character names the one film he enjoyed, ""that new thing with Ingrid Bergman."""
828;"One of the 5 ""lost Hitchcocks,"" ""Rope"" is not one of the Master's masterpieces, but it is one of his finer and most interesting works."
829;"The ""real time"" technique is fascinating, the story is unmistakably Hitchcockian, and Stewart's performance is among his best, and that alone is enough to make the film worth a watch."
830;humor, drama, suspense with great acting and great directing.
831;one of his best and the transfer to blu.
832;Artists show their work through symphonies, paintings, and writings.
833;He directed films and did things so daring that no one else could compare to him.
834;rope, Hitchcock's first color film was released in 1948, after a number of earlier successes in Great Britain and the United States.
835;The film begins with two young men strangling one of their good friends, David Kentley.
836;They experiment with the art of life and death.
837;Hitchcock was able to make the film serious yet it has the sense of an awkward .
838;murdering someone just for the sake of the thrill .
839;hitchcock made his claim as a profound director when making Rope.
840;All of the camera shots and the nervousness of the characters really made this film what it is.
841;Rope is a smart murder.
842;mystery that will keep you on the edge of your seat.
843;I was pleasantly surprised with the acting, the plot, and the dialogue.
844;There are so many one.
845;Hitchcock is a master at his craft and so are the actors he chooses for his films.
846;This film is a must.
847;The first film that Hitchcock released through his Transatlantic Pictures company, Rope is an underappreciate minor classic.
848;It's flawed to be sure but this unusual experiment was shot in long takes an unusual approach for Hitchcock.
849;It was Hitchcock's first movie to be shot in color and the entire 80 minute film is shot on one set with the skyline gradually changing.
850;The colors are pretty close to the version I saw screened.
851;while Rope isn't a perfect Hitchcock excursion, it's an enjoyable and admirable one that features a number of interesting visuals, strong performances and an interesting thought provoking story.
852;The extras on this edition are quite nice as well including a feaurette entitled Rope Unleased, production photos and notes.
853;Based loosely on the Leopold and Loeb murder, Hitch does a great job of building understated suspense about a very nasty murder.
854;Camerawork and lighting, a major challenge in view of Hitchcock's unprecedented requirements, create a haunting, tense, almost broody atmosphere.
855;fashioned stage play, producing a sharp screenplay.
856;The cast are generally excellent, even if Jimmy Stewart looks a tad uncomfortable in an atypical role.
857;Hitchcock manages to make this a legitimately suspenseful (as he is best at) on multiple occasions, providing the best parts of the film.
858;"overall, ""Rope"" is a decent Hitchcock flick that provides some suspense and great acting (especially the two leads and, of course, Stewart)."
