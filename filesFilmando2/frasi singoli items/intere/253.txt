I:316;1;This is a great walt disney movie.
I:316;2;This is perhaps the best way to introduce a kid to classical music and the composers performed here.
I:316;3;"I'm not a fan of Disney myself
I:316;4;The two melody shorts on the disc are just the kind of old Disney cartoons that I love.
I:316;5;And i think my favorite piece in the new Fantasia is probably their telling of The Steadfast Tin Soldier.
I:316;6;I've always loved that story, and they do a great job.
I:316;7;Fantasia 2000 divorces the music from the animation and thus turns into a sequence of moderately entertaining animated shorts set to classical music.
I:316;8;I sincerely enjoyed the light.
I:316;9;On the other end of the spectrum I enjoyed the storm of fluttering triangles set to Beethoven's Fifth, which is as close as Fantasia 2000 gets to its progenitor.
I:316;10;It would be excellent if it didn't feature slapstick comedy and a happy ending (everyone who read the story knows that the troll knocked the tin soldier into the fireplace, and his paper balerina sweetheart followed him there).
I:316;11;Somebody thought that superior art would do the trick.
I:316;12;the movie is delightful for the ear and the eyes (see the fantastical segment of whales swimming in the air and up to the space).
I:316;13;I received this movie within a decent time and it was actually a wonderful movie.
I:316;14;i will talk about the peices that have counterparts in the 1940 original and how they compare.
I:316;15;the rest of the peices are what makes this film enjoyable.1.
I:316;16;"beetoven's 5th symphony: the 1940 original gave us ALL of Bach's ""Toccata and Fugue in D minor"" wonderfully set to orchestra and with truly abstract images of violin bows and and strings moving in syndication with the music."
I:316;17;"it was hilarious with a good Disney ending, and it was a suprise to hear differant parts of ""The Graduation Song"", and having Mickey Mouse send it off after congratulationg Leopold Stowkowski was a nice touch."
I:316;18;seeing Mickey congratulate leopold again was a real treat.
I:316;19;iMAX theater and it was still a breathtaking performance.
I:316;20;The second piece, set to Respighi's The Pines of Rome, uses concrete images in a non.
I:316;21;the movie is quite short, eighty minutes or so, but it was enormously entertaining.
I:316;22;The same holds true for the new version.
I:316;23;fantasia 2000 is, like the original, a sequence of musical interpretations of classical music.
I:316;24;The most interesting thing about it is the fact that the animators used so many little touches to remind us of the first Fantasia.
I:316;25;in the end, this is a series of classical music videos.
I:316;26;The last segment may be preachy environmentalism, but the animation is outstanding.
I:316;27;To me, this is quite simply the best Disney film ever made!
I:316;28;I enjoy it more than the original!
I:316;29;It's a great concept that Disney himself thought of over a half century ago!
I:316;30;You have to watch this movie on a very big screen, and some good loudspeakers to enjoy 'Fantasia 2000' at the fullest.
I:316;31;imaginative as is the animation.
I:316;32;remember that this is a concert.
I:316;33;but I'm sure it made the experience more wonderful for me.
I:316;34;Especially since I did not actually enjoy some of the pieces included.
I:316;35;I have a new love for the piece, and cannot forget the imagery displayed, which is not even close to what I had imagined upon previously hearing the piece.
I:316;36;This sequence with the flying whales is delightful and refreshing, the music perfectly suited with the animation.
I:316;37;Let the music and images take you away.
I:316;38;this is truly delightful to watch and hear, and I reccommend it for anyone, at any age.
I:316;39;I was fortunate enough to see this masterpiece in a theatre in my hometown.
I:316;40;I was quite surprised to read of the criticisms pertaining to this film.
I:316;41;The Art of Appreciation is much more appropriate in terms of identifying with art and the ones that create it.
I:316;42;Fantasia, for all of its beauty, has both its own seperate identity and space in time.
I:316;43;As for the animation, seeing is believing.
I:316;44;The fields of color are vast and the imagery is both stunning and captivating.
I:316;45;The Pines of Rome segment is breathtaking, and its conclusion always brings a tear to my eye.
I:316;46;The style and grace of the animators truly captures the majesty of these beautiful creatures.
I:316;47;All in a way that is stunning both in a cinematic sense and creative sense.
I:316;48;Of course, it is all beautifully tied to the selected musical arrangements.
I:316;49;All of which are beautifully performed, thus solidifying the elegant and majestic nature of classical music.
I:316;50;Hans Christian Andersen's Steadfast Tin Soldier is one of my personal favorites.
I:316;51;It illustrates the beauty of Disney's magical use of whimsy, levity and creativity.
I:316;52;The rest of the stories are also beautifully rendered, yet stand out in their own special way.
I:316;53;Giving the film it own unique fingerprint.
I:316;54;The purpose of this film is what makes it both beautiful and unique in the art of filmmaking.
I:316;55;This film is close to its roots, while shedding light on its own originality and identity.
I:316;56;Often times people can view a film and find need to make a political commentary.
I:316;57;All that needs to be done is the ability to view with an open set of eyes.
I:316;58;Eyes willing to see the beauty of yesterday (Fantasia.1940) while bathing in the light of a new frontier.
I:316;59;Fantasia 2000 allows this to be done, and with flying colors.
I:316;60;no two Sunsets are the same, yet one is no less beautiful or more beautiful than the other.
I:316;61;Both Fantasia and Fantasia 2000 serve as wonderful companions to one another.
I:316;62;Seperate in time and technique, yet majestically woven in service to musical and visual creativity.
I:316;63;Each piece, however, is introduced by celebreties as James Earl Jones, Bette Midler, Steve Martin, and the grand dame of the Broadway stage: Ms. Angela Landsbury.
I:316;64;one of my favorite pieces is Donald Duck helping Noah bring the animals into the ark right before the flood.
I:316;65;still a great film for kids to watch if only they didn't ask a million questions and just watched instead.
I:316;66;With one small flaw, this is a wonderful, relaxing and exciting series of animated vignettes set to classical music.
I:316;67;Nice selection of animation and music.
I:316;68;To me, music and colors, dancing, lights, humor, and story telling go together, and it was all finely tuned in Fantasia 2000.
I:316;69;I was delighted to once again laugh along with magician Mickey as he confronted overflowing water and animated brooms.
I:316;70;plus years after its predecessor, it should be a stunning production.
I:316;71;The first Fantasia is heads and shoulders above this cop.
I:316;72;This is the best of Disney animation and classical music, truly a treasure.
I:316;73;It expresses everything about the wonders of life, humor and joy all without words.
I:316;74;need I say more, I've seen it 3 times now, twice at IMAX (I hope they re.
I:316;75;release it to IMAX again) and now once in a regular showing, which was almost as breathtaking.
I:316;76;This is the first review I have ever written.
I:316;77;I love art,in fact i am an artist.
I:316;78;well an artist in training.
I:316;79;i saw the previews for this movie and i was stunnded that how amazing it was.
I:316;80;Althought Fantasia 2000 is a wonderful moive,The orgianl Fantasia is the best,its a classic.
I:316;81;Both of these moives are great, I watch them all the time.
I:316;82;Roy E. Disney has worked tirelessly to bring Fantasia 2000 to the big screen.
I:316;83;Created as a continuation of the dream of a concert movie experience created by Walt Disney 60 years ago with the original Fantasia this new film provides eight more animated segments presented with classical music.
I:316;84;the musical selections are unique.
I:316;85;the animation techniques are quite good and varied in style and technique.
I:316;86;The sound carries over quite well on the Dolby DTS track that I listened to.
I:316;87;"The disc features quite a few outstanding extras including an hour long making of feature called Fantasia the Legacy Continues
I:316;88;this one is well worth seeking out to complete your collection.
I:316;89;Disney the studio has finally taken the dream out of the cupboard, dusted it off and brought it to beautiful if not complete life.
I:316;90;Fantasia 2000 is gorgeous, it is beautiful, and at one point I was fighting back tears.
I:316;91;Love it, you should, I certainly did.
I:316;92;Anyway, the package arrived in good condition and in the time limits.
I:316;93;Still good, but no cigar to the original.
I:316;94;Fantasia 1940 isn't simply the greatest piece of animation anyone ever made, it is one of world's greatest works of art.
I:316;95;It's illustration of various pieces of classical music was as daring and innovative a move as any artist in any medium has ever made.
I:316;96;inspiring and it even had a kind of coherence.
I:316;97;It's a sequel and it looks it.
I:316;98;that said, I had a wonderful time watching this.
I:316;99;But some segments work extremely well.
I:316;100;I've never cared much for Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue, but its segment here gave me a whole new appreciation of that work.
I:316;101;The Carnival of the Animals is hysterically funny, with almost a Chuck Jones feel to it.
I:316;102;And Donald Duck is both very funny and very touching in the Pomp and Circumstance.
I:316;103;But Fantasia 2000 is a worthy sequel to its illustrious predecessor.
I:316;104;Using images to highlight wonderful music.
I:316;105;I liked the fact that they added a piece from the old Fantasia on it.
I:316;106;"release, it became a classic with great music and artistic animation but dumbfounded people, calling it pretentious and ""un Disney."
I:316;107;Walt's dream for the film was for it to be a continuing work in process: re.
I:316;108;But man does it look gorgeous.
I:316;109;It's set to the story of the Steadfast Tin Soldier and it's quite good.
I:316;110;A cute funny little scene in the same vein as Dance of the Hours.
I:316;111;I liked it, not technically brilliant but still cute.
I:316;112;A theme of life/death/rebirth set in the forest.
I:316;113;Watch the original too, as it started it all.
I:316;114;Take a look at the now famous whale sequence and you'll see for the baby all they've done is make a big computer whale and stuck a hand animated eye on its side.
I:316;115;a long ways away from the mighty animation spectacular that Fantasia is supposed to be.
I:316;116;thirdly, and most repugnantly, this film is just full of itself.
I:316;117;Person I got it for needed to return it.
I:316;118;screen to discuss the works.
I:316;119;drawn and painted, instead of making the extensive use of computers as the producers so clearly did.
I:316;120;The Firebird segment is absolute perfection that thrills me with each viewing, and the centerpiece of the film, wherein an Al Hirschfeld.
I:316;121;This, like 1940's Fantasia before it, is a joy to watch time after time.
I:316;122;fantasia 2000 stands on its own as a work of originality, and I hope a third volume in this series will be arriving soon.
I:316;123;my favorite section was Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue, which was.
I:316;124;Always a fan of this exciting concerto, it was a delightful Hirschfeld.
I:316;125;The film is worth seeing for this piece alone.
I:316;126;"That was a wonderful segment that belonged entirely to the original Fantasia
I:316;127;"I have to say the ""Rhapsody in Blue"" piece ranks as my favorite animated feature of all."
I:316;128;Just hearing George Gershwin's masterpiece alone will bring tears to your eyes.
I:316;129;Combine it with the stunning art work done in the style of famed cartoonist Al Hirschfeld, and it's guaranteed that you'll be emotionally spent at the conclusion of the piece.
I:316;130;"we become invested in the lives and dreams of ""Duke"", ""Jobless Joe"", ""Flying John"", and ""Rachel"", as each seeks to follow their heart's desire in this incredibly thoughtful, moving."
I:316;131;but if you are a fan of animation, music, and the ability of the human spirit to overcome adversity, then you simply MUST see this feature.
I:316;132;it will have been money very well spent.
I:316;133;The animation is great and the music is beautiful.
I:316;134;It is modern in that it uses the latest technology in animation but the music and substance of the animation could have been done decades ago, making 2000 as timeless as the original masterpiece.
I:316;135;There is an incredible animation set to Rhapsody in Blue which tells the story of four New Yorkers (including a little girl) going through their mundane existences but, each has dreams and maybe their dreams come true.
I:316;136;Another beautiful piece is Hans Christian Anderson's The Steadfast Soldier set to Shostakovich's 2nd Piano Concerto.
I:316;137;This great movie is a treat for the whole family.
I:316;138;i enjoyed the animation and some of the interpretation of the music, especially the gershwin one.
I:316;139;please, disney, next time, try to make it flow.
I:316;140;it is possible to have live people talking and making such a piece of art flow, but it didn't work in fantasia 2000.
I:316;141;This film is an absolute delight for all of the family.
I:316;142;The music is skillfully adapted so as to feel every beat as it corresponds to the actions of dancing characters, so full of life, that they appear to jump right off the screen.
I:316;143;It is bound to appeal to young and old.
I:316;144;As a student of classical music, I have always used imagination to fill in visual aids with great music.
I:316;145;Each segment has a more cohesive story line compared to the first Fantasia, which made it more enjoyable for myself, personally.
I:316;146;If you are a big fan of classical music or even if your not you will love Fantasia 2000!
I:316;147;Well once again Disney put their magic out their and have come out with a masterpiece that you will be talking about for years and years to come!
I:316;148;Even your young children will be intrigued by the classical music and beautiful animation and funny characters.
I:316;149;This hangs together well as a series of linked cartoons based on the theme of music.
I:316;150;Even after over one hundred years of making films, we still find that the simplest ways of telling stories are the best .
I:316;151;This stylistic masterpiece is very easy to watch and very funny as well as being well drawn.
I:316;152;Having said that, the music is treated with respect, James Levine's arrangements suit their purpose admirably.
I:316;153;Amazing combination of music and animation!
I:316;154;My favorite piece was The Pines of Rome because whales hold a special place in my heart.
I:316;155;They really captured the spirit of whales.
I:316;156;I am a longtime fan of Disney and his art.
I:316;157;The original Fantasia was a triumph way ahead of its time.
I:316;158;I had serious doubts that such a visual masterpiece could ever be duplicated or surpassed .
I:316;159;Fantasia 2000 has captured the spirit of the original movie and has carried on Walt's original concept of allowing the music to create pictures in the mind .
I:316;160;this movie was worth the wait.
I:316;161;Disney's 38th animated film is the continuation of Fantasia, called Fantasia 2000.
I:316;162;This is one of three animated films that Disney rleased in 2000.
I:316;163;Lets do the good stuff first, the film looks spectacular on Blu ray.
I:316;164;who knows?All and all it's a great addition to the Disney film cannon.
I:316;165;beyond this, the sly Disney visual coding holds stronger sway here than it did in 1940.
I:316;166;Jack Warner's animators did a far better job of using classical music in animation, in an hilarious sketch of Bugs Bunny the concert pianist versus a mouse.
I:316;167;As in Adorno's regressed listener, the respect for the cultural authority (read class, as in social class) is compensated.
I:316;168;fantasia 1940 was made by ingenious analog techniques that required astonishing amounts of dog.
I:316;169;having said this, honesty compels me to say that I get the debased enjoyment promised by the work, and it's better the kids watch Fantasia 2000 than Bride of Chuckie.
I:316;170;I love the music of this movie.
I:316;171;I think it's a great way to get kids to listen to classical music.
I:316;172;I found the steadfast soldier and rhapsody in blue simply breathtaking, and I was laughing out loud for the flamingos.
I:316;173;It really improves the sound which is so important here.
I:316;174;I loved the original and I can't say that it's better but I love the fantasy choreography and the music that it's paired with.
I:316;175;The music is still beautiful.
I:316;176;The animation is still top.
I:316;177;This is another version to experience as something brand new.
I:316;178;Rhapsody in Blue by George Gershwin has some good points, so no loss there.
I:316;179;The villain of the sequence is awe.
I:316;180;so the animation is much better.
I:316;181;taking that was found in the original.
I:316;182;The Disney animators have done an outstanding job connecting images to great works of music, bringing them to life for today's audiences.
I:316;183;As a music teacher this is an excellent resource for stimulating interest in works by the great composers.
I:316;184;All of the selections are presented in unique and interesting fashion.
I:316;185;There is something for everyone.
I:316;186;It's an entertaining, inspiring and educational movie.
I:316;187;I saw this film several times in the theater and enjoyed it more every time.
I:316;188;This new version of Fantasia is much more entertaining for the modern movie.
I:316;189;Disney chose some great music and combined it with amazingly appropriate visual scenes.
I:316;190;Disney's talent always amazes me, and Fantasia 2000 is just one more reason why.
I:316;191;While I liked it, I still favor the 1942 film.
I:316;192;Still I especially like the last segment in this release, which is based on the Mt. Saint Helen's eruption.
I:316;193;anyone who appreciates excellent music, beautiful art and animation and enjoys Disney characters and humor will enjoy the Fantasia films.
I:316;194;I love the original Fantasia and always thought there should had been more made so imagine my surprise when I found out Walt's original idea was indeed to continue with the experiment.
I:316;195;tA on a futile try to astonish audiences with a recognizable tone.
I:316;196;Pines of Rome: Better than the opening, although I wasn't aware of this piece it blends to some degree with the animation.
I:316;197;So this mix was a sweet dessert to my eyes and ears.
I:316;198;Piano Concerto No. 2: Another piece with good storytelling.
I:316;199;I read the book of the Tin Soldier several times as a kid and seeing it fully animated was a nice treat, the music here is more of an accompaniment to the story than a real blend between the two but it works so I'm good.5.
I:316;200;There are a dozens funnier Donald cartoons out there, there are dozen cartoons with better storytelling, and pretty much every other segment from the new and old Fantasia has a better fusion between music and animation.8.
I:316;201;An obvious try to achieve the masterful grandeur of Night on Bald Mountain but a piece that stands strong on its own.
I:316;202;Whereas Fantasia leaves you with the dark image of Chernabog here Disney is finally able to leave you with a feeling of joy and hope.
I:316;203;"So in conclusion ""Fantasia 2000"" is a solid yet a little shallow effort."
I:316;204;Fantasia was Walt Disney's passion and obsession.
I:316;205;f2000 is an excellent work that suffers from unfair comparisons to the original.
I:316;206;f2000 represents a giant leap forward in animation technology, blending hand drawn animation with digital animation.
I:316;207;the finale in F2000 was magnificent, even better than the finale of the original.
I:316;208;The theme of death and rebirth was uplifting and inspirational, and the meld of animation and music was powerful.
I:316;209;They trivialized an otherwise superb work.
I:316;210;Fantasia 2000 is another example of Disney's utter dominance of animated films.
I:316;211;Despite my slight preference for the original (probably just sentimental from my childhood), F2000 is a brilliant film in its own right.
I:316;212;"Walt would have been proud of his nephew's work, and elated at the realization of his dream that ""Fantasia"" live on as an evolving animated feature."
I:316;213;I'm not sure who loves this movie more, my son or myself!So happy to have found it!
I:316;214;the centerpiece of this new Fantasia is clearly Rhapsody In Blue, which is a dynamic use of jazz and the art of Al Hirschfeld to bring forth a uniquely New York.
I:316;215;i felt that the Pines Of Rome was beautifully done.
I:316;216;Having always associated that piece with the Italian landscape, it was very interesting to see it with whales.
I:316;217;everything else was fine: good music, good cartoooning.
I:316;218;It enhances the experience ten.
I:316;219;This is so because, first, it is the visuals that give the feel to the whole piece, and, second, because the purely musical part is not always first class (yes, despite the known names and the orchestra involved).
I:316;220;The final piece (Stravinski, Firebird) is real good.
I:316;221;Very inventive and evocative, affecting, beautiful, solid 5 stars.
I:316;222;These days far better visuals are achievable .
I:316;223;bottomline: recommended, for the sakes of the two pieces I mentioned.
I:316;224;Worth having, especially if you can get a copy at a discount.
I:316;225;My family went to see it at the IMAX production and it was a great experience!
I:316;226;My favorite was the Pines of Rome with the triumphant ending of flying whales, but Rhapsody in Blue (nice recreation of New York) and the Firebird (intense moments with the Firebird chasing the Fairy) come in close 2nd and 3rd.
I:316;227;The goal was be as good as the first one was.
I:316;228;Which what made it a wonderful thing to watch.
I:316;229;The people who worked on this movie are really really talented.
I:316;230;It is very recommended, and worth watching.
I:316;231;This movie is a real big production.
I:316;232;I wish i see the classical and cute chracters of walt disney more.
I:316;233;But the dances and visual attractions are great.
I:316;234;In this masterpiece production, Disney has done a FANTASTIC job of melding classical music and animation .
I:316;235;"with a NEW twist this time
I:316;236;"I think everyone will have their favorite piece from this collection
I:316;237;It's such a wonderful story .
I:316;238;the end always leaves me with such a warm and happy feeling inside!
I:316;239;My daughter's favorite piece is the one that answers the question: What happens when you give a flamingo a yo.yo?
I:316;240;It's zany and silly and always leaves a smile on her face!
I:316;241;I think Fantasia 2000 is the perfect way to introduce classical music to a young child.
I:316;242;It also makes for the perfect family viewing experience, as everyone discusses what exactly THEY think is going on in the cartoon!
I:316;243;up vibration noise subsides, I'm able to enjoy the movie!
I:316;244;Fantasia is best described as the classical equivalent of MTV.
I:316;245;For at least the last twenty years or so, the original Fantasia has been an esteemed classic, and finally Disney got around to making the follow.
I:316;246;In addition, a considerable chunk of the 74.
I:316;247;All in all, Fantasia 2000 was a movie well worth watching .
I:316;248;All in all this was a great experience with Amazon.
I:316;249;The Fantasia Anthology is a transcendental, magical mystery trek into an animated world made alive with music.
I:316;250;Excellent music and Excellent animation.
I:316;251;The difference is that I 'thought' I knew what to expect .
I:316;252;So strong was this notion that this animated sequence even found its way into Fantasia 2000, as a kind of commemorative to the original impetus for producing the first Fantasia in the first place.
I:316;253;introduces the Fantasia concept to the audience.
I:316;254;In essence, a story with a lack of story but plenty of appropriate visual stimulation and great music!
I:316;255;'OLD STANDARD' now we can see what one might imagine while listening to this great classic!
I:316;256;esque beings with perfect music for the occasion and setting or vica versa!
I:316;257;And they are all dancing to the music!
I:316;258;emotionally moving vocalizaton with a sacred procession moving on by torchlight as the theme plays on!
I:316;259;on the plus side: The final new.
I:316;260;agey sequence is quite beautiful in a pseudo Maxwell Parrish sort of way.
I:316;261;Nonetheless it adds a warm,intelligent touch to a rather flat affair and provides a link to its much more distinguished and enjoyable predecessor.
I:316;262;Actually, they are like rare, small candies that you snatch and eat secretly.
I:316;263;The final piece, Firebird Suite, is beyond words.
I:316;264;A few years ago, I discovered the film Fantasia and I became a lover of it.
I:316;265;My favourite pieces of music in the film are : Beethoven's Symphony n5 (an intstant familiarity, since I love that piece of music, and a very good start with the movie), Respighi's Pines of Rome (THE breath.
I:316;266;taking sequence of the whole film, an extraordinary piece), Saint.
I:316;267;Everybody loves it, just like I do.
I:316;268;It was really something seeing it on an Imax screen.
I:316;269;taking piece of music of the movie.
I:316;270;Donald Duck has his best role in his whole career, now).
I:316;271;As for the others, they are great too, don't worry !
I:316;272;I went to see it again in Paris and will see it once or twice more when it will be released in normal theaters, with my best friends.
I:316;273;To conclude : you are strongly advised to go and see it with friends and family, you will all love it.
I:316;274;Those familiar with the tragically beautiful story of the Steadfast Tin Soldier will recognize this happy.
I:316;275;It is enjoyable as far as the music goes, but the one detraction is the multitude of famous narrators, a new one introducing each segment.
I:316;276;Most are enjoyable, but some could be done without, which detracts somewhat from the overall enjoyment.
I:316;277;But this is still well worth purchasing.
I:316;278;They are so much better when you can view their brilliance with digital pefection.
I:316;279;Rhapsody in Blue was inspired and brilliant, even though it was humorous, so don't scratch that one.3.
I:316;280;They should have made the story of Noah's Ark very serious and emotional and longer.
I:316;281;I guess the original is one star better than this one.
I:316;282;Oh yes, Walt Disney is a great innovator.
I:316;283;All the pieces are great music and great animations.
I:316;284;The ideas are funny at times, dramatic at other times.
I:316;285;The Tin soldier is beautifully rendered on a perfect music.
I:316;286;legged tin soldier can finally bring his love for the balerina to a real start and fulfilment.
I:316;287;It is a piece of pure sweet pleasure.
I:316;288;We see with pleasure those whales and their kind of eternal survival.
I:316;289;It wants to open young children to classical music or to jazz (What a beautiful piece on New York City with that phenomenal Rhapsody in Blue), but it seems to aim only at entertaining the eyes along with the ears of our children, and little their conscience and reflection.
I:316;290;It really is a worthy successor to Fantasia.
I:316;291;everyone's already said that it's excellent music and excellent animation .
I:316;292;what's been left out is that it's an incredible overview of all the best of what Disney animation has to offer.
I:316;293;It offers a proper tribute to the original while setting the stage (literally) for a whole new series of wonders.
I:316;294;just a glorious celebration of color, shapes and music, with a complexity impossible without modern computer enhancing techniques.
I:316;295;The whales are quite realistic, and their movements are serene and joyful.
I:316;296;the Rhapsody in Blue segment combines a distinctive Anerican music style (Gershwin) to an equally distinctive American art style (Hirschfeld).
I:316;297;telling is delightful (and I would never have believed that a segment of Fantasia would ever be set in New York City).
I:316;298;the Steadfast Tin Soldier is an excellent example of adapting a traditional fairy tale to modern animation.
I:316;299;telling with modern techniques, and the movement and art styles of the three main characters make them visually distinctive as well as helping the characterizations.
I:316;300;the Carnival of the Animals is zany cartooning at its frenetic and silly best.
I:316;301;The music is associated now primarily with graduation processions, so let's attach it to a traditional procession .
I:316;302;the animals entering the Ark.
I:316;303;It's a symbiotic whole of silliness, pomp, traditional story.
I:316;304;telling, animated animals, sadness, joy, and love.
I:316;305;the Phoenix is a natural tale of death and rebirth, using animal, plant, and volcanic movements that are precise, beautiful, incredibly realistic, and compellingly moving.
I:316;306;the movie as a whole is incredible for animation fans, compelling for music fans, fascinating for artists, and satisfying for those (like me) for whom the original Fantasia is one of the best movies ever made.
I:316;307;Excellent music and fabulous animation!
I:316;308;The magic was in her eyes as much as in mine.
I:316;309;The DTS soundtrack is pretty good and the video is superb.
I:316;310;The music and images matched perfectly and kept my interest the entire time.
I:316;311;I put in Fantasia for her one night and she loved it and fell asleep watching it.
I:316;312;I got her the Fantasia 2000 as well and she loves it just as much.
I:316;313;The animation is amazing and the classical music is very soothing to her.
I:316;314;"There are some absolutely stunning moments in this Fantasia ""sequel."""
I:316;315;It looks incredible on a big screen TV with the sound cranked way up.
I:316;316;The original Fantasia is my favorite movie of all time.
I:316;317;That piece was also, incidentally, the least similar to the original in style, showing the kind of creativity I'd hoped would be present throughout.
I:316;318;however, the music is excellent and the idea is still a good one.
I:316;319;up to the 1940 Disney masterpiece Fantasia offers even more stories that beautifully blend state of the art animation, special effects and music to help build the movie.
I:316;320;the stories are beautifully well animated and done all the way.
I:316;321;The music scores of such popular artists like Beethoeven to Gershwen are simply excellent, the animated segments sometimes uses fine CGI and hand.
I:316;322;drawn animation to suck you into the world of Fantasia.
I:316;323;im in love with this movie!!
I:316;324;Come on people, you just say that the first one is better because its a classic!
I:316;325;Most of this film is outstanding.
I:316;326;This part is more for fans of Wagner's Parsifal, which, also, has a hurtful mood.
I:316;327;They all respect Stravinsky more than do Walt Disney and James Levine.
I:316;328;I havent see the original movie.
I:316;329;But I like this movie.
I:316;330;The movie is fantastic and, while definitely putting a modern spin on Fantasia, many parts are astoundingly true to the first movie.
I:316;331;there are enjoyable shorts and some enlightening interviews.
I:316;332;There are three segments in this feature that are simply magnificent.
I:316;333;"The Gershwin is all right, but Pomp and Circumstance is very pedestrian
I:316;334;This sets the standard of what can be done in presenting visuals to serious music.
I:316;335;When classical music is shown on television, there is absolutely nothing original or creative about the camera work, as they use the same shots they've used since the 1940s.
I:316;336;There is the master shot of the orchestra, and each time an individual instrument or section makes an entrance, there is a close.
I:316;337;There is always the mandatory close.
I:316;338;"The combination of images in motion, coordinated to the music, and intelligent story lines really do compliment the great music, and the most popular chapter, Respighi's ""The Pines of Rome,"" is especially inspired."
I:316;339;"If your idea of ""aht"" is Jackson Pollock or Karen Finley, you may not feel exhilarated by it, but for the rest of us, it is American art at its finest."
I:316;340;this is a genuine work of art fit for grownups .
I:316;341;updated film, and yes, the production values are above the industry standard.
I:316;342;video part II and part III of their classic cannon.
I:316;343;Fortunately, Disney has surrendered everything to Pixar, so hopefully the new blood will help.
I:316;344;Destruction is part of nature, just as it is part of life.
I:316;345;"(In fact, every time I see a Pixar movie, I always think ""Disney used to make films like this."
I:316;346;I do congratulate them on the wonderful way they brought to life Al Hirschfeld's distinct style.
I:316;347;It was a wonderful marriage of period music to period art, and in a way, it almost saves the project.
I:316;348;They managed the threads well, and story worked on a Movie.
I:316;349;The subplot of the missing Donald was genuinely tender, considering the danger.
I:316;350;the film was a technical masterpiece, and it had its moments.
I:316;351;a high concept film combining art, music, and culture.
I:316;352;This is the first IMAX movie I saw, and I was not disapointed.
I:316;353;All the music was great, and the animation was so nicly done.
I:316;354;I lot better than the first.
I:316;355;Catch it in the IMAX before it's to late.
I:316;356;This is a combination of wondrous animation and stupendous orchestral music.
I:316;357;It's great fantasy of images and sound encourages interest in the arts and creativity.
I:316;358;There is lots of room to explore one's imagination in interpreting the story.
I:316;359;"They loved the graphics and commented: ""This was really cool."""
I:316;360;The Firebird Suite was really bright and the music fit really well.
I:316;361;I loved the whale segment.
I:316;362;Best for ages 5 to 8.
I:316;363;The original Fantasia dazzled because it touched so many parts of what we as humans are.
I:316;364;The music and themes it used were so incredible and varied.
I:316;365;It did segments that not only touched all sorts of people, but touched bases with all the sorts of feelings that we, as people have.
I:316;366;I use it across disciplines of music, visual art and literature when I teach ages pre school through 5th grade.
I:316;367;In urban areas they love Rhapsody in Blue.
I:316;368;See, THIS is what Disney should be aspiring to these days!
I:316;369;This film was a wonderful example of what Disney artists USED to do, and no longer seem capable of producing.
I:316;370;But I was most pleasantly surprised!
I:316;371;contrary to what some other reviewers have said, much more of this film WAS actually hand.
I:316;372;drawn than other recent Disney films.
I:316;373;The artists made a conscious effort this time around to make it look less digitized and more heartfelt and warm, and they did a very good job of it.
I:316;374;They deliberately take famous works of music and put pictures to them.
I:316;375;This number is sweet and emotional and just plain creative.
I:316;376;This stylized number has humor, heart, and a truly New York tang.
I:316;377;Unlike the original story, this version is Disney.
I:316;378;fied and has a sweet and happy ending.
I:316;379;The animation looks just like a picture book, which is perfect for the subject matter.
I:316;380;my very favorite number happens next.
I:316;381;"As James Earl Jones states in his introduction of this number, ""Disney answers the age."
I:316;382;"Set to the finale of ""Carnival of the Animals,"" this whimsical, colorful number continues to make me laugh every time I see it."
I:316;383;It's short and simple, and reminds me of an old.
I:316;384;It has all the charm of classic Disney, and is an absolute delight to giggle at.
I:316;385;It's both humorous and sad, sweet and silly.
I:316;386;"and finally, in keeping with the mix of dark and beautiful that we see in the finale of the 1940 ""Fantasia,"" we end with a selection from Igor Stravinsky, ""Firebird Suite."""
I:316;387;It's a beautiful but also frightening piece, fiery doom that turns into serene peace.
I:316;388;I took my 18 month old son to see Fantasia 2000 at the Imax theater for his first movie experience.
I:316;389;We were both captivated throughout the entire movie.
I:316;390;We especially enjoyed the flying whales .
I:316;391;Fantasia 2000 will definetly be one of our favorite Disney movies.
I:316;392;It's nice to see movies that make the effort to enrich the minds of children.
I:316;393;It's very refreshing compared to all the cartoons with no plot or substance.
I:316;394;you should compare this movie to other movies produced in this day and time.
I:316;395;There are few movies that compare to the masterpiece of Fantasia 2000.
I:316;396;It took 16 years for the public to appreciate Walt Disneys dream and the work it took to make it happen.
I:316;397;i understand that everyone has their own taste and opinion, but I felt that I had to speak in defense of the genius of Walt Disney.
I:316;398;It is a completely seperate work of art from Fantasia.
I:316;399;It really is my favorite of the 2 Fantasia films.
I:316;400;after all, I could spot some cheating going on with the computer animation.
I:316;401;And with a shorter running time than Fantasia (which I fell asleep to while watching), this is seriously sweet stuff!
I:316;402;I think that this is a pretty good edition of Fantasia but I could have done without the celebrities talking.
I:316;403;I loved the original Fantasia from the first time I saw it at age 6.
I:316;404;Almost 60 years later, after seeing it multiple times, I still love it.
I:316;405;I bought this for my baby grandchildren, who love it already, and can grow up with this timeless musical masterpiece.
I:316;406;Great movie for all ages.
I:316;407;Many years later, the movie received the acclaim it deserved.
I:316;408;Donald Duck as Noah was terrific.
I:316;409;I heartily, heartily, endorse the orginal Fantasia as a timeless classic for all ages.
I:316;410;"the two vignettes that I enjoyed the best are ""Pines of Rome"" and ""Firebird Suit ."
I:316;411;In the former we see a fantastic vision of whales that is wonderfully surrealistic and beautiful.
I:316;412;There is a lot in the vision that the animators could have been explored in much more depth.
I:316;413;This nymph combined a flavor of Japanese Manga with traditional Disney animation to create a character style that is wondrous and beautiful.
I:316;414;"disney animators once again created a new classic short in ""Piano Concerto No. 2, Allegro, Opus 102,"" which provides the music for ""The Steadfast Tin Soldier."""
I:316;415;telling is quite taut and well organized.
I:316;416;"There is a cute new Donald Duck story with Noah's Ark as the backdrop, set to the music of ""Pomp and Circumstance."""
I:316;417;"There is a clever story set in New York City set to Gershwin's ""Rhapsody in Blue."""
I:316;418;"Both are clever and have made appearances on one of the original ""Worlds of Disney"" weekly shows and on The Disney Channel."
I:316;419;I suspect that one day Disney will re.
I:316;420;On the up side, all of the animation is equal to or better than traditional Disney animation, and two particular works I thought were extremely good.
I:316;421;I've seen it so many times and it never gets old!
I:316;422;All I can say is that it brought tears to my eyes.
I:316;423;We could have new reasons to make silent films come back into style if scored with such musical poetry!
I:316;424;If there was no original Fantasia to set the bar for this type of film I would probably love Fantasia 2000, but the original holds me back from enjoying this one as much.
I:316;425;I liked the older Fantasia's look better, now it's too glossed over.
I:316;426;I absolutely detested the age old question of what a flamingo would do with a yo.yo part.
I:316;427;the Pines or Rome piece, with the whales is breathtaking.
I:316;428;Rhapsody in Blue beautifully depicts a tale about dreams and how they come true.
I:316;429;driven opening and the closing animation of Stravinsky's Firebird Suite are also amazing.
I:316;430;really, the only bad thing about the movie is the fact that it's made of segments, most of which are of incredible beauty, which keep leaving you wanting more.
I:316;431;Now, of course the arts are something vague and open to personal opinion, and personal taste.
I:316;432;But something tells me that Leonard Maltin just likes to dislike.
I:316;433;Here was a wonderful film, almost flawless in every way, and yet he puts it down.
I:316;434;Jeez, sign me up for that job.
I:316;435;As far as I'm concerned, Fantasia 2000 is a wonderful film, and I don't think for a minute that the novelty of music and film has worn off.
I:316;436;I have little to say aside from the fact that this film is amazing.
I:316;437;the film is presented in the widescreen format, which is perfect and it makes me happy.
I:316;438;A combination of music and animation makes up one of Disney's latest movies of all time, Fantasia 2000.
I:316;439;With a wide variety of music this makes for a treat for a person of any age or background.
I:316;440;You start with Symphony No.5 one of the best selections of music in the whole movie.
I:316;441;The picture creates a Picasso type setting and as they fly and flutter, the music takes you on a journey though time unknown.
I:316;442;Computer takes this animations to the next level.
I:316;443;Rhapsody in Blue one of my favorite songs ever.
I:316;444;You can feel the storyline pull together, it almost takes your heart away.
I:316;445;Just the good old times.
I:316;446;A great selection of music and animations makes this movie one of the best I've ever seen.
I:316;447;I highly recommend this vendor, and would use them again!
I:316;448;This one has some great sequences which I really enjoyed, and with improved animating tools, some of the artwork truly is fantastic.
I:316;449;i have to say that two of my favorite sequences were the one with the spring goddess/spirit, and the one with four people unhappy with their lives (a man henpecked by his wife, a man looking for a job, a black dude unhappy with his job, and a little girl) and how their lives intersected with better results for all of them, with a great, simple but wonderful animation to boot.
I:316;450;This is an amazing Disney movie.
I:316;451;It's not as good as the original , but it's still worth watching!
I:316;452;Once again it was great to see a classic Disney Movie.
I:316;453;When you think they can't out do themselves along comes another surprise of good music, outstanding animation and just enough humor thrown in to make it interesting for all age groups.
I:316;454;Thankyou to all who had a hand in this fine production.
I:316;455;What I enjoyed about Fantasia 2000:1: With the great advances in recording technology the sound is much better than the original Fantasia.
I:316;456;The animation is gorgeous, especially the nymph and the feel of the scene fits Stravinsky's music wonderfully.
I:316;457;Purchasing a home theater system pays off with Stravinsky's music especially the ending which is one of the most powerful and sublime pieces of music ever written.
I:316;458;fantasia 2000 is very enjoyable but not as good as the original.
I:316;459;Both these movies are a wonderful way to introduce children to the world of classical music.
I:316;460;Also another difference between both films it the production of the films.
I:316;461;barring the negatives that I wrote above Fantasia 2000 art is great as well as the animation.
I:316;462;designed Rhapsody in Blue , a perfect capture of what it would have been like as a '40s Warner Bros short directed by Chuck Jones .
I:316;463;Absolutely the high spot of the film.
I:316;464;the flying whales that so many have loved were, for me, beautiful graphically and technically, but just a little bit silly.
I:316;465;the Pomp and Circumstance sequence, featuring Donald Duck in an unusually good.
I:316;466;The Steadfast Tin Soldier was very well done .
I:316;467;box who looked mostly hand.
I:316;468;however much i liked it when i saw it on the original Disneyland teevee show forty.
I:316;469;three stars because of the Rhapsody sequence, and the rest gets a free ride.
I:316;470;"See this feature for the Resphigi ""Pines of Rome"" whale sequence.Yes, all of the music is good and very well executed by Levine and the CSO."
I:316;471;Yes, the _Rhapsody in Blue_ sequence has a cool, angular look that will appeal to anyone who likes to think of himself as hip.
I:316;472;but the whale bit is far and away the most inventive, the most surreal, the most visually impressive, and musically the most engaging part of the entire feature.
I:316;473;"It is the best sequence precisely because, well more than any other sequence in the film, the visuals do exactly what music does best
I:316;474;"(The _Rhapsody_ part is nifty, but it's far more literal in its depiction of humanity than the ""Pines"" sequence.)"
I:316;475;They should have saved the best for last.
I:316;476;It is our intention to make a new version of Fantasia every year.
I:316;477;Its format is very flexible and fun to analyze .
I:316;478;taking as a starting point the original film, this new Fantasia presents 8 incredible animated segments accompanied by 8 classical compositions:An abstract celebration of movement and color, choreographed by Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, with flying figures that simulate butterflies and bats.
I:316;479;"an astounding vision of blue whales that fly the limits of reality and go to the sky, accompanied with ""Pines of Rome"" of Ottorino Respighi."
I:316;480;an interpretation of the famous Rhapsody in Blue, by George Gershwin, with an excellent animation made by Al Hirschfield, that begins with a point until it creates the vibrant city of New York and its colorful people.
I:316;481;fantasia 2000 is a banquet of delicatessens to our senses.
I:316;482;The return of their music in Fantasia 2000 confirms the immortality of such creations.
I:316;483;It transcends animation, time and generations.
I:316;484;It's life, dream, it's beauty and endless ecstasy.
I:316;485;A short piece is played, on comes the emcee to entertain the crowd.
I:316;486;i ordered this for my nephew, will.
I:316;487;he is a pirate/magician at the moment and LOVES this movie as much i did as a child.
I:316;488;The sequel to Fantasia which was filled with great music and some very entertaining and moving stories, so to say.
I:316;489;Now it came to video and I had to see it.
I:316;490;But finally there becomes one where a flock of flamingos gets a yo.yo and that part is wildly funny and entertaining.
I:316;491;With some cute cameos by Bette Midler, Steve Martin, Penn and Teller, James Earl Jones, and others, that adds to the mild fun.
I:316;492;Disney did the smartest move in the movie, it added to the glee and it made Fantasia 2000 even better then a mild review it would have gotten from me.
I:316;493;They saved the best for last.
I:316;494;It was hard to tell who enjoyed it most, the chaperones or the kids.
I:316;495;From the simpler work in Rhapsody in Blue to the CGI whales, it was all beautiful.
I:316;496;The music is of course wonderful, and the performance by the Levine and the CSO is magnificent.
I:316;497;Fantasia 2000 is even better than the original Fantasia.
I:316;498;And other segments are absolutely visually dazzling.
I:316;499;The Fantasia 2000 tape arrived promptly in excellent condition.
I:316;500;Our 2 granddaughters enjoy the music and characters.
I:316;501;A nice addition to our original Fantasia tape.
I:316;502;It's a format I can identify with.
I:316;503;fide musical credentials, and one (Steve Martin) manages to be genuinely funny.
I:316;504;colored butterflies is involved, but the real points of interest are the variant lighting effects.
I:316;505;A nova appears in the sky above the Arctic Ocean, inexplicitly giving the power of flight to a large pod of humpback whales.
I:316;506;Which is certainly good enough for me!In contrast, the following set is completely concerned with story.
I:316;507;Al Hirschfeld, acknowledged master of the affectionate caricature, provides the line.
I:316;508;"shostakovich's `Piano Concerto #2' provides the soundtrack for Hans Christian Andersen's ""The Steadfast Tin Soldier"" (or rather a version of that tale."
I:316;509;"generated animation, which seems appropriate
I:316;510;next: a brief, highly energetic cartoon.
I:316;511;Donald without his voice is definitely more diminished than a mute Mickey, but the duck manages some funny bits without it.
I:316;512;they saved the best for last.
I:316;513;Certainly `2000' is a very fine effort, well worthy of a sequel.
I:316;514;Here however the images match the power and strength of the music.
I:316;515;"There is one possible gripe here
I:316;516;This segment is quite enjoyable and the giant herd of whales swimming through the skies in the sky in the last third is incredibly powerful.
I:316;517;quincy Jones introduces George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue with the entire segment rendering in the style of Al Hirschfeld, making this segment the most distinctive of the feature.
I:316;518;Although this segment at times feels overly long, it does capture the hustle and bustle of 1930's New York City fairly well.
I:316;519;It is a remarkable segment because the story and score are unrelated but they have been fused together beautifully.
I:316;520;It is a very short, fast paced segment about a flamingo playing with a yo.yo, it could easily the favorite segment of many viewers especially among adults who understand its presentation of the conflict between conformity versus individuality.
I:316;521;Once again, the visual matches the power and strength of Stravinski's work and it is a great segment to end the program.
I:316;522;Walt Disney was always looking for ways to advance his medium and would have certainly embraced the computer as a creative tool had the technology been mature enough during his lifetime.
I:316;523;It contains lots of extra features including two commentary audio tracks and two musical Disney shorts from the early 1950s.
I:316;524;One hopes that Disney Animation will resurrect Walt's dream and continuously update Fantasia in the future, especially since it has a good starting point.
I:316;525;Fantasia 2000 is a modern masterpiece.
I:316;526;It brilliantly matches beautiful classical music with fantastic animated imagery.
I:316;527;Like the original, it is an artistic experience and is meant to be seen, heard and felt on a rich emotional level.
I:316;528;I enjoyed all of the sequences, with Stravinsky's Firebird Suite and Gershwin's Rapsody in Blue being my favorites.
I:316;529;Fantasia 2000 was energetic, entertaining and very emotinal.
I:316;530;Excellent sound and seemingly perfect images are nicely balanced with audio commentaries and a wonderful documentary.
I:316;531;While not coming close to the subconcious level of the original Fantasia, it is still an excellent film that deserves a masterpiece label of its own.
I:316;532;The selection of classical music is outstanding, as was the case 50 years ago the integration of music, storyline and animation is the stuff of genius, and there is a glowing, positive atmosphere that is wonderful for kids.
I:316;533;In particular, the creation of the New York story for Rhapsody in Blue is astonishing in the perfect and intricate way in which the animation, mood, and music are in harmony with each other.
I:316;534;Great entertainment for kids and a joy for adults.
I:316;535;If you ask me, this is certainly the best Disney movie, I have seen in a long, long, time.
I:316;536;I feel that to get more people to see this version then the original Fantasia was to get celebrities, and humorous cartoons inside the film to introduce each segment.
I:316;537;The animation is surely more clear and clean than the original.
I:316;538;The pictures were amazing, but I didn't like the way they performed some of the songs (loud shrill singer at the end of Pomp and Circumstance, understated tone for Beethoven's Fifth) or the way the songs went with the pictures.
I:316;539;The one exception was Rhapsody in Blue, which was a perfect blend of the story to the pictures.
I:316;540;Walt Disney meant to have his Fantasia concept expand, explore, and evolve.
I:316;541;Later I discovered it was from Walt Disney's Fantasia, and bought the special (back then) 3 vinyl album released by Buena Vista.
I:316;542;I still have it in storage, because I loved it.
I:316;543;I have also met Mr. Walt Disney briefly on rare occasion back in the very early 60's.
I:316;544;"the original Fantasia was classic, revolutionary art form, and a milestone for Walt Disney, and incredibly ""gutsy."""
I:316;545;I like it, simply put, and I don't even mind the star pre.
I:316;546;The music is fabulous, and it can grow on you on special days of the year.
I:316;547;My favorite piece is the Magic Bird Of Fire.
I:316;548;Plan to go again, this summer (Disney Resort, Ca.)
I:316;549;This presents us with a visual voyage into music that, in my opinion, excels that if the original Fantasia.
I:316;550;Not only is the animation itself is extremely fluid, colorful, and highly diverse from segment to segment, but the representation of the music is, in itself, sheer genius.
I:316;551;The new Fantasia 2000 follows the original's artistic vision, providing music videos of exquisite animation to classical pieces of fully orchestrated music.
I:316;552;And like the original, this film is one of those mind.
I:316;553;blowing experiences that is mesmerizing, entertaining, moving and outrageously creative.
I:316;554;type scenario, and Rhapsody in Blue, which tells its own urban story in Hirschfeld.
I:316;555;This movie is so rich with imagery and imagination that I think the only problem with it is that unless you have a large.
I:316;556;Alive with music and brilliant animation the new Fantasia2000 film is not an instant Disney classic but it is a definate must see.
I:316;557;It is not as good as the original but it is just as vibrant and colorful.
I:316;558;This film has something that the original did not have, celebrities.
I:316;559;Steve Martin, Better Midler, and Angela Lansbury introduce some of the musical pieces.
I:316;560;The animation is really beautiful to watch.
I:316;561;I highly reccomend this film.
I:316;562;The original Fantasia was a dazzling, mesmorizing work of art filled with stunning images and terrific music.
I:316;563;to start, a swarm of evil black butterflies chase away the beautiful, variously colored ones to the strains of Beethoven's classic Symphony #5 .
I:316;564;The CGi is excellent, and the music is very well done.
I:316;565;But in my opinion, what really makes this piece is the stunning animation, such as the ice cavern and flight sequences.
I:316;566;The breathtaking blue background also gives great feelings of depth and serenity.
I:316;567;Set during the Great Depression in NYC, Rhapsody in Blue is very well.
I:316;568;animated by the great Al Hirschfield in several shades of blue.
I:316;569;George Gershwin's music is possibly the best in the film, and as a result Rhapsody in Blue turns out to be one of the best segments in the film.
I:316;570;the 4th piece beautifully recreates Hans Christian Anderson's beloved fairy tale, The Steadfast Tin Soldier .
I:316;571;It turns out to be my personal favorite of the movie.
I:316;572;It is handsomely animated and has terrific music.
I:316;573;It boasts several excellent sequences and features a great villain, the towering, menacing, Jack.
I:316;574;The next segment, The Carnival of the Animals', is a nicely animated, cheery piece that answers the question what would happen if you gave a yo.yo to a flock of flamingos?
I:316;575;It features delightful music and as a result turns out to be highly entertaining.
I:316;576;It has great music and to put it short, is wonderfully magical.
I:316;577;the 7th piece, Pomp and Circumstance , tells the poignant and thoroughly touching story of Donald Duck as Noah's assistant, in which he and Daisy both are aboard the Ark yet think the other did not make it on.
I:316;578;The fianl piece, Igor Stravinsky's Firebird Suite (1919 version), is a breathtakingly told tale of life, death, and rebirth.
I:316;579;Though it plays a little too close to the Night On Bald Mountain/Ave Maria segment in the original Fantasia, it features stunning animation and the firebird itself is certainly terrifying.
I:316;580;Overall, a beautifully fitting ending to an excellent film.
I:316;581;She loved it as much as I did!
I:316;582;The animation and the COLORS are extraordinary.
I:316;583;The whale sequence is breathtaking and the Donald and Daisy Duck sequence is amazing in its emotional and visual scope.
I:316;584;"The forest sprite is actually beyond description
I:316;585;My personal favorite is the Rhapsody in Blue segment.
I:316;586;I love the music and the addition of Hirschfeld illustration and the action and beautiful fluid animation make this one really stand out.
I:316;587;taking with marvelous co. ordination and music.
I:316;588;my favorite act was the Noah's Arc story.
I:316;589;It was funny seeing the dragons and unicorns laughing at all the other animals while boarding the arc :)
I:316;590;Any Disney fan who has Fantasia will this updated version as a companion to the original.
I:316;591;Fantasia 2000 showcases the evolutionary process of both mediums and still maintains the unique Disney charm that has made the animated creations of this studio classics for all generations.
I:316;592;the musical selections represent an astounding mix of styles, and are superbly performed.
I:316;593;They are outshone only by the animation, which displays incredible imagination, stunning technology and impeccable attention to detail.
I:316;594;Other than the amazing soundtrack for your receiver, special features on this F2K are interesting.
I:316;595;Artists/graphic artists will appreciate hearing the commentary from the art director.
I:316;596;"While critics say this is not as good as Fantasia ""1"", it is something original and beautiful and may not have passed muster with Walt (he was a perfectionist) it is a continuation of the art/music thematic material of original Disney."
I:316;597;"I am shocked that very young kids ""get it"" as well as adults."
I:316;598;The imagery and animation is pleasant but unexciting.
I:316;599;For anyone who thinks they appreciate high.
I:316;600;It would make Uncle Walt proud.
I:316;601;If not, this is a great introduction to classical music.
I:316;602;Like the original Fantasia, Fantasia 2000 brings together the finest traditional animators with the latest technology to create a masterpiece.
I:316;603;Like the original, it will probably be years before the masses wake up and notice that this film is extraordinary.
I:316;604;See the IMAX version on the big screen if you have the opportunity.
I:316;605;They are all worth watching.
I:316;606;For me, the combination of the wonderful animation, the stories, and the great music made for an intense emotional experience.
I:316;607;I experienced a sense of awe at the beauty and creativity of the animation and a number of times I discovered tears rolling down my face.
I:316;608;This film is truly a masterpiece!
I:316;609;Most people will look at Fantasia 2000 as the Disney film that couldn't, and we are left with is a film that is superior in music, animation, and story in almost every conceivable way.
I:316;610;Most people will criticize the film for one reason or another, whether it's the much talked about flying whales, or yo.yo flinging flamingos, when looked into the actual depth compared to the original, it succeeds, and very well.
I:316;611;the animation is excellent, no film has had such well done animation, compared to Fantasia 2000.
I:316;612;most people wowed when they saw Toy Story and Dinosaur, this simply has you awe.
I:316;613;ing the entire way through.
I:316;614;Rhapsody in Blue's story, is the most interesting, and the only one that you will watch just because of the Story.
I:316;615;While you will watch all of them for the story and animation, this truly is a landmark on how to blend story, with animation.
I:316;616;of course you get the unbelievably well animated The Steadfast Tin Soldier, which will keep you enticed with is wonderful animation, arguably the best ever seen.
I:316;617;The Carnival of Animals with some flamingos, and a yo.yo is probably the most enjoyable for it's unbelievable amount of quirkiness.
I:316;618;The final scene Firebird Suite is arguably the best in the entire film.
I:316;619;birth is the theme, and is an excellent ending to an excellent film.
I:316;620;While yes, in between you get to see Steve Martin, and other recognizable faces, they give you a good background information on what Disney has done in it's past.
I:316;621;Times have changed, and so have tastes, this film is a testament of animation.
I:316;622;d virtual space, Impressionism, surrealism, all used to make this film, and it all succeeds well.
I:316;623;If you remember that it's Fantasia, and only Fantasia, you will enjoy just as much if not more.
I:316;624;My son watched part of the movie in music class and wanted to see the whole movie.
I:316;625;I found it on amazon and as soon as it arrived we watched.
I:316;626;The excitement was well worth it.
I:316;627;By far the best sections of the film are Shostakovich's 2nd Piano Concerto and Stravinsky's Firebird Suite, both in terms of the musical performance and animation.
I:316;628;played section of the original film and yet hardly the most remarkable.
I:316;629;laden and often doctored performances of classical works, to the point at which Stokowski must have scribbled extra notes in the musician's scores.
I:316;630;About 6 months ago, I discovered an extreme appreciation for classical music.
I:316;631;The talent it took to compose classical songs are amazing.
I:316;632;Absent are words, but present is the feeling that the composer had in order to compose their pieces.
I:316;633;Now then, combine some of the greatest music ever, with some of the best animators, and that means only one thing: A Classic is Reborn.
I:316;634;Music with feeling is combined with animation that has feeling.
I:316;635;Fantasia 2000 is perfect for its generation.
I:316;636;Fantasia 2000 is second generation Disney, post Little Mermaid.
I:316;637;The flying whales is a perfect example.
I:316;638;Not only is the music selection great, but Disney has also used some creative and imaginative stories and illustrations to produce a fantastic feast for for both eye and ear.
I:316;639;I love the music is animated.
I:316;640;even now when I hear the music, I see the animation that goes with it.
I:316;641;animate Hayao Miyazaki, and I am a huge Miyazaki fan.
I:316;642;This is so much better than the other Disney works because it has imagination that you don't get with even Disney's latest and cutting edge works.
I:316;643;This is a great collection in it's own right.
I:316;644;The guys at the Disney studios did a great job with Fantasia 2000 each section was well coriographed.1.
I:316;645;respighi's Pines of Rome was one of my favorite pieces . . . I can still see those whales flying through the night sky . . . breathtaking piece.3.
I:316;646;There is a definate story to this one .
I:316;647;Shostakovich's Piano Concerto #2 tells the story of The Steadfast Tin Soldier the one.
I:316;648;Great fun although the shortest piece in the batch at 1m 54s.6.
I:316;649;Oh well, at least you still have something to connect the two!
I:316;650;A great and touching story.8.
I:316;651;create things even more beautiful than the first time around.8.
I:316;652;all around Fantasia 2000 was one well rounded piece, and is one of the perfect animated movies.
I:316;653;If anything, it is a continuation of the CONCEPT.
I:316;654;"If you do that, and don't expect a ""Fantasia"" part 2, you will be most impressed with Fantasia 2000."
I:316;655;Disney included the segment to achieve a continuity with the original, but they should have used all new segments and been happy to be judged as a freestanding project.
I:316;656;Despite this misfire, Fantasia 2000 is a great movie.
I:316;657;All the segments are entertaining and beautiful.
I:316;658;all in all, while it cannot match the original for groundbreaking techniques and jawdropping animation/effects, Fantasia 2000 is just as creative and entertaining as the original.
I:316;659;If you enjoyed Fantasia, you should absolutely enjoy Fantasia 2000.
I:316;660;I was a big fan of fantasia, and was expecting something from fantasia 2000.
I:316;661;Fantasia was a beautiful movie with good music.
I:316;662;Yes, the graphics were a little better, but the movie, and the whole feel of a once masterpiece, was disheartening.
I:316;663;As much as I enjoyed the original Fantasia, this new installment tops it.
I:316;664;Fantasia 2000 is much more bright, entertaining, and re.
I:316;665;2000 prefers upbeat and even humorous animation to the slow and often gloomy sequences that saturated the original.
I:316;666;The vibrant colors and dramatic song intros are welcome and significant improvements over the dark animation and dry, dull silhouettes of the first.
I:316;667;The animation matches the music to a much greater level of detail, offers drama and humor, and does not demand nearly as much patience.
I:316;668;With the enhancement of graphical and computer technique, Fantasia 2000 is a good mix of high level animation and classical music.
I:316;669;The whale movements in the artic area does provide a very good alternative for the music and the music and the animation were blended together so nicely that if you don't know the title of the music, you would thought that the music was built for the picture.
I:316;670;Nonetheless, Rhapsody in Blue was itself a good match for live in metropolitans, so it is not as surprising and imaginative as the Pines of Rome.
I:316;671;the carnivals of animals is cute too, short but carefully plotted.
I:316;672;The concept of the Noah's Ark is really cool, though the love between them were overtaken by the superb animals and visual effects around them.
I:316;673;This is a great movie for kids and adults.
I:316;674;, everything is incredibly creative and exciting to watch!
I:316;675;This is a great movie.
I:316;676;Although, the music was changed(butchered) to met the needs of time, the compilement of the music was fantastic.
I:316;677;As a person learning of the classical music genre, this film has helped me have points to jump off and do research and find music!
I:316;678;The animation is perfect and the music is great.
I:316;679;It is great to see Donald in such a dramatic and funny role.
I:316;680;Pretty good video from disney.
I:316;681;Not as good as the first Fantasia but still entertaining and has very vivid colors.
I:316;682;This movie is a worthy successor to the original Fantasia movie.
I:316;683;This movie, as with the original, gave me a greater appreciation of classical music, while entertaining me with impressive visual imagery.
I:316;684;A classical piece of music (who can't identify it upon hearing it?)
I:316;685;A great piece of music which builds to a fantastic finish.
I:316;686;Has some cute moments with a baby whale.
I:316;687;Easily the best (and longest) piece in the movie.
I:316;688;Done in the drawing style of Al Hirschfeld, a magical tale is told of four people in Depression.
I:316;689;A charming piece of music, used to tell the story of the Steadfast Tin Solder.
I:316;690;A (very) short, but very funny piece which answers the age old question: What happens when you give a flamingo a yo.yo?
I:316;691;Still worth watching after all these years.
I:316;692;Fun to watch and enjoyable.
I:316;693;A wonderful story about life, death and rebirth.
I:316;694;The piece builds to a wonderful ending, both in the story and in the music.
I:316;695;overall, this movie is a wonderful addition to any home video library.
I:316;696;family cuteness, visually appealing but forgettable.
I:316;697;"Firebird Suite was a good one, sort of a mix of the original's ""Night on Bald Mountain"" with ""Princess Mononoke"" ."
I:316;698;animated look, and neatly ties four urban stories into one package.
I:316;699;The characters are good, and the informal style works well against the computer.y look of some of the others.
I:316;700;The brief nods to Al Hirschfeld's cartoons help set an arty, sophisticated mood as well.
I:316;701;Take it on its own, though .
I:316;702;It was an amazing experience, to be surrounded by such wondrous music and imagery.
I:316;703;It will be interesting to see how the film plays out on a more intimate screen.
I:316;704;The Pines of Rome is the most popular segment, featuring lush computer animation of blue whales soaring through the arctic ice until they take off into the sky.
I:316;705;Disney really did a job on this one, with just enough of a story to balance out the imagery.
I:316;706;Clearly borrowing from the art of Charles Vess, Firebird Suite is a pretty fairy piece with a bit of fire and danger.
I:316;707;Rhapsody in Blue is as close to perfect as you need to get, blending a great Gershwin tune with Al Hersfield's familiar style.
I:316;708;It really took me by surprise, and this is always a good thing.
I:316;709;I also really enjoyed the participation of Donald Duck, who is usually my least favorite Disney character.
I:316;710;It is a very heart warming segment.
