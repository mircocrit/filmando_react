id;spiegazione
1;If you like suspense and excellent plot this is the movie for you.
2;The acting is also very good especially Haley Joel Osmet.
3;there are scenes in this film that are unforgettable and will haunt you long after you have watched it.
4;I admit I got scared on many parts of the movie.
5;And I even saw The Ring at midnight and it didn't scared as much as The Sixth Sense, and I have even seen this one on the afternoon !!!
6;It has unbelivable performances from Bruce Willis and specially from Haley Joel Osment.
7;If you really like to get a terrific scream and feel butterflies on your stomach, than this is the perfect movie for those who love thriller and suspense and a little bit of terror.
8;M. Night Shymalan's 'The Sixth Sense' is one of his two best movies.
9;The skill by which the development and resolution of this bizarre and chilling classic make it a modern landmark.
10;Malcolm Crow (Bruce Willis) celebrates with his wife a recent award achieved helping counsel disturbed children.
11;For the rest of the movie he has to make it all up with a new client, Cole (Haley Joel Osment) and balance his desire to make his wife his main priority.
12;The causality of another dimension presented is disturbing, yet fascinating.
13;the tension of the story is counterbalanced with a heart that makes more than one plot accessible and enthralling.
14;The performances are superb with arguably Willis' best ever.
15;Osment, for his part, plays a prodigy as a prodigy in what has to be one of the best (if not the best) childhood performances on film.
16;The supporting cast is remarkable as well.
17;(Psychology is rendered at least overrated.)
18;Shymalan is effective like few directors are with a film that is edited for every second to wrap around the other expertly.
19;And all along you think that Bruce Willis is alive!
20;For those of you who went ape over this movie , please watch stir of echoes instead!Even though it was overlooked by this movie!The Sixth Sense has a great cast just very short on plot!
21;I'll gladly recognise that the little kid is way above the normal go here, say this 2.
22;It was nice of the Academy to nominate him, will probably make him feel confident to keep acting, but his performance was really a M. Knight.
23;Any Oscar for this movie would have to go for the screenplay, as it was one of the most clever of the year, but when it is in competition with American Beauty, it gets lost in the shadows.
24;So get over it, enjoy this extremely intelligent piece of writing and direction with solid enough acting to carry it off, even from the somewhat stilted Toni Colette.
25;It is the best movie I ever seen in many years, specially by the end of the film, which is very intriguing and amazing.
26;When I left the theater, my first thought was that I wanted to see this film at least one more time to realize how well.
27;A wonderful film with great actors too.
28;This movie will make you feel fear, shocked, love and most of all think about the other dimension of this world.
29;Although is a thriller movie is Good though.
30;It has good acting and decent effects.
31;Perhaps the best part of the movie is the way it finishes.
32;Much has already been said about this film, so I will keep my comments brief.
33;It was the first film to surprise me in a long time (great twist ending, my god!)
34;Instead, I'll talk about this filmmaker's first movie.
35;I taught movie classes, this is a film I chose, and I saw it about a dozen times, fully aware of the ending.
36;The star is Haley Joel Osment!
37;The acting was flawless and the scenery most certainly created a mood.
38;Shyamalan is a masterful writer, director and producer.
39;One of these days I'm going to watch a Shyamalan movie in the right frame of mind.)
40;I thought about this film for days after seeing it.
41;Shyamalan is a filmmaker of bold originality surviving in a commercialized medium.
42;That's a good thing, no matter what your opinion of each individual film is.
43;It seems that my gift is a lot more icky.
44;It's damn good and Bruce Willis didn't have to kill anybody.
45;Director Shyamalan shows that he knows how to startle an audience and create a creepy atmosphere, and the script and actors are first.
46;awarded Osment turns in a touching, brilliant performance as the terrified young boy, a performance of such depth that is rare for an actor of his age.
47;Willis's acting is wonderful too, and it's great to see him in a subdued role like this.
48;But at the start of the next episode he manages to jump out and escape.
49;the movie is good while you watch it, and if you can disengage your brain at the end you can ignore the inconsistency.
50;This movie was very well written and directed.
51;It is one of thoes movies that really gets you mind all boggled up.
52;This was without a shadow of a doubt the best film of 1999!
53;This movie has everything to make an excellent film.
54;a wonderful story, great actors, suspense, surprises!
55;Enjoyed this thriler alot since it is far above the usual thriller.
56;Effectively errie,top mark's to the kid.
57;office and certainly though not brilliant deserves the wide.
58;wise and less than creative.
59;endeavour's to rip the paying public.
60;Bravo, an intelligent thriller they got right!
61;This movie is so great!
62;Anyone who hasn't seen it, like me as of yesterday, don't hesitate, you'll love it.
63;The ending is very unpredictable and suspensful!
64;I don't care for Bruce Willis, but man, I love him in this movie!
65;It is the kind of movie I could only watch once because once you know how it ends it's not as much fun any longer, but other than that, this movie is so wonderful, see it!
66;The Sixth Sense by M Night Shyamalan is by far his masterpiece, too bad all the films that followed were less than impressive.
67;This is also Bruce Willis's finest performance, he is flawless from start to finish.
68;Toni Collette is such a chameleon, she can transform herself into any character and her physical appearance changes in every film as well.
69;I love the twist ending and the writing is brilliant, I highly recommend this ghostly horror, enjoy!
70;Got this for my husband and he loved it.
71;He is very excited to see movies on blu.
72;The story actually is quite simple and I was expecting something a little more intricate.
73;The acting is well done throughout.
74;What can be said about this film thats hasn't allready been pointed out, well I have something to say that most haven't said, and that is that this film is more touching than suspensful, well in my opinion.
75;it's a good film to watch for those who are doubtful about the afterlife, who knows this might change your mind, and quite a sad movie this is, especially if you have lost someone that you really love, it will definately touch you.
76;There are many great things about this movie, but you know what just get it, don't just watch it, it's that powerful!
77;hi all i need to thanks all in six sense and i love brucewillis and he is a good act.
78;This is one of those movies that you have to see a second time.
79;The ending is a big surprise, and the acting is wonderful.
80;A must see if you enjoy mystery and suspense.
81;The Sixth Sense is a film that will send its viewers to an unknown and fascinating Journey to what humans fear most.
82;Needless to say the cast was astonishing, the Director who is also the writer was brilliant and the movie has perhaps the most unpredictable ending i for one have ever seen.
83;The Sixth Sense will leave you shocked, charmed, provoked and mesmorised.
84;The extra content has some scenes that the director had to cut, and he explains his reasons for cutting them.
85;Bruce Willis and Haley Joel OsmentThe Sixth Sense (Collector's Edition Series)perform one of the most beautiful stories ever written for the big screen.
86;It is so beautiful, the message is inspirational and reminds us that love never dies.
87;It will live for ever deep inside our hearts.
88;Haley Joel Osment is an excellent young actor, and Willis is in top form in this flick.
89;He handled an intelligent, sensitive role better than I ever thought possible, and Haley, well.
90;Because these actors were well.
91;James Newton Howard is also an excellent composer and the score of Sense is haunting and lilting without being jolting.
92;if you haven't seen it yet, please do.
93;This was, without a doubt, an amazing movie.
94;Osment is a real show stealer here, and his scenes with his mother are touching without being unrealistic.
95;This movie is inventive and scary and I defy anyone that says that you'd only want to watch it once.
96;The first time I saw the Sixth Sense, I was impressed.
97;The way the movie was arranged and acted out is so detailed, I have watched it several more times and each time I discover something I had never noticed before.
98;I enjoyed the deleted scenes because after you have seen the movie itself, it is refreshing and even entertaining to see what was left out and why.
99;I loved the movie and the story itself was fascinating.
100;I highly recommend this film and consider it one of Willis' best performances.
101;Instead of raving about how good this film is, I believe people should watch it and be their own judge of its worth.
102;It is simply a supernatural DRAMA that tells a story of a little boy, and what HE sees is scary to him.
103;Simply by 'he got shot .>
104;It's either you are a psychic, or you are amazingly simple.
105;If you are so smart, why aren't you making one of the biggest box.
106;haley is incredible as the horrified little boy who can't look over his shoulder without seeing something terrifying.
107;Bruce is just fine as the psychologist who wants to make up for a big mistake with an old patient he couldn't help (however he does do that manly surly puckered cheek look he's infamous for.
108;Other than that, she's incredibly real.
109;there is one other scene that sticks with me because I laughed and didn't know if it was supposed to be funny.
110;Bruce Willis is actually a man.
111;see this film, then see it again to see how seamlessly the makers avoided any inconsistencies.
112;This is a classic ghost story.
113;paced, and takes its time to develop the characters.
114;Bruce Willis does an excellent and sensitive job portraying the child psychologist.
115;The cinematography, the direction, are wonderful.
116;This is entertainment for the brain and I can only wonder why, with all the talent that's available, such movies are so rare.
117;The Sixth Sence is a great movie for those who like to be frightened.
118;It makes you think and it tricks you with a wierd ending, get this movie, it's great!
119;Great plot, great picture and sound production, great actors, what more can you ask for?
120;This is a movie I recomend you watch.
121;After you watch the movie watch the behind the scenes
122;God where do I begin, this movie just was so unpredictable and well thought out.
123;I always look for mistakes in movies and this one had a minor one, it was when bruce willis and the boy were in the church and they were talking and the priest didnt say anything to the boy like who are you talking to?
124;Besides that it was simply perfect.
125;I got the chills at least 10 times during this movie.
126;This is a superb movie
127;dozen movie previews every time I insert it into my player.
128;Coke ads between scenes?Otherwise, it's a great movie.
129;The Sixth Sense has to be one of my all time favorite movies.
130;With a combination of suspense, discovery, surprise, and emotion, this movie covers all bases.
131;Great haunting music that keeps you frightened!
132;The Sixth Sense is a really good movie that will fill your mind with suspense and fear.
133;This is a movie that you will enjoy being scared about but if you are easily scared, do not see this movie until you are able to conquer your fears.
134;I love getting scared and I think I was one of only a few people on the planet who didn't actually get what was going on from the beginning of the flick.
135;I think this means that this sort of movie is perfect for me.
136;Bruce Willis was great in this!
137;Cole, Haley J. Osment, was great playing the role of the young kid with the talent to see dead people.
138;He provides the viewer a window into his life of terror and confusion that will make anyones heart bleed with compassion.
139;all the main characters make this movie worth seeing.
140;I heard some reviews of this movie before I actually got to watch it so I knew that there was a twist.
141;I think I might have enjoyed this movie more had I not known, but I will say that even the second time I watched it, it was still entertaining.
142;this kind of movie has to be really good to be enjoyable the second viewing, so I will say it's a good movie.
143;The child actor had to be good and they picked a winner here.
144;Willis is better and more entertaining in action flicks (at least that is my opinion) but here and in the movie The Kid, he is good, there is no doubt.
145;This is the kind of scary movie that can be watched with older kids as it is very scary at points, and while it has some gruesome scenes in it, it doesn't have outright gory violence like a slasher flick nor does it have any sex scenes.
146;A strong recommendation for anyone that likes good drama and doesn't mind a couple of frightening images.
147;Willis seems to be taking a professional turn away from the mindless action genre that he is so well entrenched in, embracing instead the dramatic roles that he is so capable of commanding.
148;The Sixth Sense is one of his best films to date.
149;And the role is executed flawlessly.
150;Osment's Oscar nomination is richly deserved.
151;The Sixth Sense is one of those rare cinematic experiences which demand more than one viewing.
152;Overall, a superbly acted and directed picture, well worth the time and money it costs to view it.
153;This Movie Is And Always Will Be The Best Thriller Of All Time!
154;in the movie there is happy parts and scary parts but my point is that this movie is the best Thriller of all time.
155;Every One should at least see this movie at least once.
156;The is the best and the greatest movie of all time.
157;It's the thrilling gift of a child that really catches your attention.
158;The secret is revealed towards the end and gives a shocking turn to the movie.
159;Scary and yet very satisfying, the movie is highly recommended!!!
160;This movie shouldn't win the Best Picture Oscar, or the scariest movie ever but is still great.
161;Nominated for 6 oscars, is chilling, with a jump or two.
162;This movie is good for everyone to see.
163;It is a suspence film.
164;There are several plot twists, and an ending you wouldn't believe.
165;Bruce Willis is good, but Haley Joel Osment is better, see it.
166;The Sixth Sense is an incredible film: well directed, well filmed, with an intense score, wonderful settings, and of course, brilliant acting on the part of Haley Joel Osmet.
167;It passes over the blood and guts thriller style of 'scary movies' and is instead a deeply dramatic psychological thriller that gives the viewer a most unsettled feeling.
168;Willis delivers one of his best performances to date.
169;The supporting cast is fantastic and of course, Osmet simply amazed me.
170;This young actor portrayed Cole Sear with depth and range far beyond his years and experience.
171;The basic story premise may not be the most original or complex but it is handled with superb skil, creating an emotional tour de force film.
172;It's gripping, chilling, and of course, unsettling and best of all, it only gets better with multiple viewings!
173;The sixth sense not only gave you all the requirements for a greatly done movie but it also had you at the edge of your seat the entire time.
174;Bruce Willis plays a incredible role of a theripist but also makes you think that he was actually one.
175;He made it so that you didn't think it was acting but real life.
176;The story was excellent with a terrific ending.
177;like the edited parts, excellent.
178;his acting was well worth his academy nomination.
179;great story, great acting, all the best ingredients to make a great movie!
180;The ending is wicked awesome.
181;Theres a 10 to 1 chance you'll like this movie if you watch it.
182;Haley Joel Osment is such a good actor for only nine years old!
183;I was quite impressed with his performance.
184;The movie was extremely suspensful and it will leave you on the edge of your seat the whole time.
185;I also found it very touching.
186;You will sympathize with every character in the movie and you will feel compelled to help them out.
187;The suprise ending was the best part about this movie.
188;If you like scary movies you will love The Sixth Sense.
189;In a year of so so movies it was nominated for an Oscar but is truly not an Oscar worthy picture.
190;If you see it once you'll never need to see it again.
191;The greatest thing about `The Sixth Sense' is that to this date it has yet to be topped, not even by its director.
192;chilling feeling one gets every time they hear those four famous words uttered.
193;a' supernatural thriller about a young boy troubled by his unique gift.
194;But as that relationship slowly dies he forms a bond with his new patient Cole Sear.
195;both Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment are outstanding in this brilliant film.
196;Willis wears the confusion of his situation on his face with earnest honesty and that adds layers to his character.
197;Osment shines so brightly here and should have walked away with the Oscar that night, but alas, he'll have his day again I'm sure.
198;He gives Cole so much charm and charisma.
199;He's able to create a believable nine.year.
200;He adds so much believable maturity.
201;It's truly astounding to watch.
202;the star of this film though is Shyamalan who instills a deep.
203;The lighting, the music, the atmosphere, set designs, script and acting all add so much originality and suspense to this one of a kind experience.
204;The entire cast (I should make mention of the amazing Toni Collette who is just fascinating as Cole's frustrated mother) delivers down to the bone and makes this a film to watch again and again and again.
205;I could go on and on about this movie, but wow says it all.
206;I could mention the incredible performances.
207;He was amazing, his fear seeming genuine, from the perfect delivery of his dialogue to the subtle facial movements that sold the scene.
208;line warrior role and made us believe that he could be more than a tough guy, like say, a sensitive and intelligent psychiatrist.
209;Toni Collette showed us just how amazing her voice.
210;talent is and how real her emotions can be as the mother of the frightened boy.
211;M. Night Shyamalan proved just how great he can be with his first true success.
212;ups to the incredible camera angles, his on.
213;I could mention the extra features.
214;From friendly interviews to deleted scenes, and a bonus little snippet from his childhood, the features are both interesting and exciting.
215;I could mention any of those, or I could mention them all, but wow says everything about this film.
216;NO SPOILERS HEREThe Sixth Sense is a solid entertaining film.
217;Haley Joel Osmond proves that he is worthy of Adult.
218;Even the supporting cast, like the boy's mother and teacher have strong performances, although I can't remember their names.
219;Any movies that come out in 2000 will undoubtedly be compared to this gem.
220;None will live up to its subtle way of grabbing you and then shocking you.
221;Let me begin by saying that this is a superb movie.
222;I was hooked from the beginning to the end.
223;One minute you are jumping out of your seat, the next you're almost in tears.
224;and I knew there was a twist.
225;The acting is superb throughout and the production is excellent.
226;First Malcolm is shot in the chest (heart area) and possibly before you can think how he could survive the wound you see him walking around again.
227;The eye is quicker than the mind (or is it the other way around).
228;this is really a well written, almost flawless, wholly entertaining, creepy, almost completely horrifying and not too long movie.
229;This movie impressed me, it was so well done and so creepy and grose sometimes,Bruce Willis is excellent and the boy is also excellent in his role.
230;at the end the movie has an unexpected twist.
231;it will make you think.
232;m Night Shyamalan is a great director, he prooves it with every movie he makes.
233;I liked this movie when I first saw it in theaters, but it was so hyped that I thought it was OK, an average 3.
234;His performance seemed more impressive the second time around, and it was fun to watch and search for clues after knowing the ending.
235;haley was such a good actor in this movie and i think he should have gotten the oscer.
236;bruce willis also did a superb job and this movie is one of my favorites.
237;actually it probably is my favorite!
238;it was so good and you'll love it
239;but the movie itself I thought was well done, and Haley Joel Osman is my favorite young actor, he's fantastic!
240;He is the only one who can see ghosts and his behavior has made him a freak in the eyes of his classmates and teacher.
241;the film starts with a frightening glimpse of what Cole may become.
242;The reminder takes the form of a bullet in his doctor's stomach.
243;we catch up with the good doctor, played superbly by Bruce Willis, about a year later.
244;The big clue for the audience is that Vincent and Cole both have a small spot of blond hair within their otherwise dark locks.
245;And so begins the careful building of a relationship, a friendship, and eventually a salvation for both of them.
246;And so Malcolm's diagnosis is understandable.
247;Once the secret is out however, our viewpoint is released and we are able to see as Cole does.
248;His midnight callers create some of the scariest cinema I've seen in years.
249;Not because of cutting edge special effects but because we share Cole's helplessness in the face of his gift .
250;Instead, I will simply beg you to see this gripping, intelligent and deeply emotional movie.
251;Bruce Willis is in top form in this scary movie.
252;This is a fantastic smart horror film.
253;I liked the sets, and the lighting created the appropriate mood.
254;Resonance is good in a movie.
255;cole going on about great.
256;perfection considering the hype this movie got AND the Oscar nominations, to boot.
257;I particularly loved the 'Rules and Clues' segment which explained how the famous twist had to be believable for both the first and second viewings.
258;the 'deleted scenes' were also great to see and quite considerable in content.
259;You kind of agree with the reasons for the deletions but understand the angst at having to remove such great scenes.
260;Haley has a distinguished career ahead of him, if this film is any reflection of his future.
261;This is a 5 star movie, it has it all, the drama, the thriller, the mistery, even the gore and it is all shot in a dark setting and at a very hauntingly slow pace it really catches you till the famous final plot twist.
262;There's also a funny personal memory of mine of when I first saw the film at a theatre in my hometown, cause during one of the most breathtaking scenes a man sitting on the back row crossed his legs and his shoe toe slightly touched my right ear which made me gasp and jump off my seat in the dark!
263;Man, that was real live special fx!
264;As for The Sixth Sense, without a shadow of a doubt, it definitely deserves to be placed high on a mantle or pedestal next to 1999's Academy favorite and winner American Beauty !
265;I also would've enjoyed seeing Haley Joel Osment win for Best Supporting Actor.
266;He acts with more genuine feeling and emotion than most so. called professional adult actors out there in today's film industry ( shocking that some of these actors are still in the business despite their lack of acting skills).
267;They say those with a comedic or witty and sarcastic exterior are the ones who are more apt to show greater and deeper emotions of a serious sensitive nature.
268;she was able to swap her Aussie accent for a New Jersey one
269;The story, plot, effects, were equally mesmerizing.
270;This is a good story with a great cinematographic language, if you are a early cinematographer or film maker studen, you will get a lot of teaches, because the director make a great movie with a good story.
271;You would apreciated a lot of shots with a lot of meaning that make you understand the contex of the film.
272;But don't take me wrong, this is a good movie to pass the time one Sunday afternoon when you have nothing else to do.
273;This was an impressive movie from almost every facit.
274;Generally speaking I don't care for Bruce Willis' films, but recently he seems to be remaking his image into a more caring, gentle persona.
275;This film appears to be one of those efforts and is overwhelmingly successful.
276;Young Osment is a joy to watch.
277;Quite evidently a precocious child when seen interviewed on Opera and other talk shows, he is a consumate actor and puts his character across well.
278;The plot of the film is tightly woven, with the ending so thoroughly unsuspected and delightful, that I actually went to go through it again to see if there was any evidence for cheating or goofs
279;All in all, a very polished film and a pleasure to watch.
280;I enjoy suspense films and this has to be one of the best!
281;What is great is nobody gives away the ending for those that haven't seen it yet!
282;The acting is good and the storyline is great.
283;Just stick with it because you are in for a treat!
284;It is wonderful and makes this film a true masterpiece.
285;I'm an admirer of his in his over the top action roles as well.
286;It is a credit to his talent that he can do both.
287;The young boy does a wonderful job as the child that sees Dead people .
288;The roles are developed well and keep you in a net till the end.
289;Anyone who likes a bit of suspense, and a good story line should see this one.
290;the Sixth Sense, from writer/director M. Night Shyamalan, is fully satisfactory.
291;This is possibly Bruce Willis' best role to date.
292;These twist endings are sort of a trademark for Shyamalan, as are his directing techniques.
293;Throughout the film, doors and windows always symbolize something significant.
294;Another subtlety in the film is the usage of the color red.
295;in addition to the creepy psychological facets of the film, there were also a few shocking moments carefully placed throughout to create a greater sense of tension and dread.
296;Bruce Willis turns in a much better performance than some of his other recent works, Haley Joel Osment is refreshing in his incredible talent for someone his age, and Shyamalan provides a compelling story with memorable characters and some of the finest, most innovative directing approaches I've seen in a while.
297;I'm not going to tell you that you will or will not like it, but if you enjoy the sort of stuff I've described above, it's at least worth giving a shot, right?
298;The answer for this movie is: YES!
299;Every time I watch it I see it with new eyes.
300;I found this horror film entertaing with an intresting twist.
301;It had excellant writing and was very well acted.
302;i bought this product few years ago!
303;it kept me at the edge of my seat, it had me jumping in surprise when something jumped out of nowhere, and Haley Joel Osment was absolutely amazing in it .
304;HE deserved to be nominated for Best Lead Actor, because Bruce Willis, in my opinion, was just feeding off of Haley's superb, natural talent.
305;wonderfully played by French star Gerard Depardieu.
306;But wait there's more, the excitement continues as Whoopi Goldberg joins the adventure and helps Haley overcome his fear of the outside world and make the friendly Bogus history.
307;Bogus is a wonderful movie!
308;'The Sixth Sense' is probably one of the best movies I've ever seen.
309;They claim to be able to see ghosts and spirits and be able to talk to them and the ghosts and spirits can talk back to them and see them .
310;kind of like being a median.
311;A year later, Malcolm's new patient is 9.
312;'The Sixth Sense' is a really good thriller starring Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment with a really surprising ending!
313;The acting is spectacular, and Haley Joel Osment shines in this movie (it's a real shame he didn't win that Oscar for 'Best Supporting Actor' .
314;The plot of this movie is brilliant, and seemed very real, like it could really happen to someone.
315;If you want to see a really good thriller movie then see 'The Sixth Sense' .
316;If you liked the way that the ridiculous plot holes in this movie tricked you, then you'll love The Game too.
317;That's what this genius director wants us all to do.
318;He just wants a friend.
319;He just wants to be able to go to the bathroom in peace.
320;in the end we come to understand that the doctor (portrayed with an uncommon and perfectly understated sensitivity by Bruce Willis) who is so intent on helping Cole (and redeeming himself in the process) is truly the only one with the unique qualifications necessary to rescue him.
321;And in the end Love is the redemption that we are hoping for.
322;But if you are looking for a superbly acted, and directed psychological thriller that will keep you up at night, and thinking about it for days after you've seen it, then you have definitely come to the right place.
323;hitchcock is somewhere smiling happily.
324;I agree with everyone that this movie was great!
325;The use of the color red was intersting and the music.
326;As you watch the movie, listen to the music!
327;The director is M. Night Shyamalan, and I've seen a few other of his pictures, and now I think I'm going to have to check out what else he has done.
328;He's got a way with supernatural themes that makes them seem downright natural.
329;It's an art, that is.
330;this one is worth seeing.
331;The performances are very good, but maybe not exceptional.
332;But here's the thing: This is an extremely entertaining film.
333;And I highly recommend this film to anyone.
334;This one's really fun to watch, but the sentimental at heart may need a tissue on hand.
335;Overhyped, yes, and severely overrated in general.
336;I watched this film with friends, and the only reason we lasted past the first half.
337;Stay away from this garbage.your five senses will thank you.
338;M. Night Shyamalan accomplished something really great with this frightening chiller.
339;He created a scary horror film that was just that.
340;He's helping a 9 year old boy named Cole Sear(brilliantly played by Haley Joel Osment)who seems to have the gift of seeing ghostly visions.
341;Of actually seeing and hearing spirits.
342;Shyamalan knows how to set the mood.
343;Shyamaln has crafted the film together so brilliantly.
344;I guarantee that you will be watching the film a few more times afterwards to piece everything all together.
345;Bruce Willis is really good.
346;He's a real actor, and a good one at that too.
347;He delivers a shockingly magnificent portrayal as Cole.
348;Never have I seen such a mesmerizing performance from a young actor in all my life.
349;He was nominated for the Oscar and he deserved it.
350;Shyamalan is a creative and imaginative director/writer.
351;He really is a talent to watch.
352;The Sixth Sense is a classic film that will live on for ages.
353;Its very scary, and dramatic.
354;We get chilling scares, and a few tears as well.
355;Shyamalan is a great director!
356;I reccomend his newest thriller Unbreakable!
357;High points:the direction, the superb acting, the scares and the drama mixed together, the surprise ending, the hauting score, and what ever else I missed.
358;Then again, maybe they were making fun of it.
359;The movies twisted plot and clever ending was somewhat predictable, but well acted, and the excellent atmosphere pushes off the screen keeping you in its frightening clutches.
360;This is another of Bruce Willis' excellent movies outstanding cast great story M. Night is a true genius arrived as advertised
361;This film is extremely intelligent and has a creepy atmosphere that elevates the suspense.
362;Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette deliver star.
363;making performances and are very believable as mother and son, Bruce Willis also shines as Dr. Malcolm.
364;But the real star of the movie is the craftmanship by writer/director M. Night Shyamalan who wrote an extremely inteligent screenplay and added 'some twists and stuff' to make it extremely entertaining and smart viewing.
365;Every scene is packed with clues and little details that make you come back and see it again.
366;Extras: spot director M. Night Shyamalan in a cameo.
367;From a scale of 1.10 I give this film a 9!
368;This movie had superior acting, tear jerking moments, and above all, it delivers twists and turns that leave you putting it all together long after the movie has ended.
369;The movie was excellent in that it remained true to the old thriller noir films such as the abiance Hitchcock loved.
370;Overall, the film was not what I expected, but Haley Joel Osment amazed and astounded me with a believable Cole.
371;This was an incredibly good movie.
372;Some of it is eerie and unbelieveable, other parts so beautiful with the scenery and people.
373;Bruce Willis was certainly handsome, just like in THE KID.
374;He works well with children.
375;I kept wanting him to be alive and well.
376;He is a good little trouper.
377;The director seems to delve into the inner workings of the minds of non.
378;average misfits, and turns out a suspenseful and powerful story with a message.
379;The Sixth Sense at first glimpse looks like an orignal horror film with an artistic 'edge' to it .
380;it is amazing to me how this was nominated for Best Picture for the upcoming Academy Awards when excellent and ORIGINAL films like Magnolia and Election were left out.
381;It was big surprise .
382;just something that will entertain me.
383;this is a very simple but very powerful story creating tension without the need for special effects.
384;Its believability is down to the fanstastic acting of all players, especially Haley Joel Osment and Shyamalan's delicate touch.
385;These, together with a great score has to make it one of the most atmospheric movies you are likely to see.
386;the ending does lose its surprise after the first viewing, but you notice so much more each time you see it afterwards.
387;i went to see it at the theatre opening weekend, and i am glad i didn't wait.
388;Haley Joel Osment is awesome
389;overall, i think this is a great movie, and it has been added to my family's list of favorites.
390;This movie should have won the Oscar for best movie and best screenplay.
391;The movie has a surprise ending and is worth purchasing for your movie collection.
392;Fine performances by the main actors of the movie.
393;Osement delivered his best performance to date.
394;m. Night Shyamalan proved himself with this masterpiece.
395;M. Night Shyamalan's SENSE is a dark, crawly masterpiece, full of shock and dread.
396;Cole's mum (Toni Collette) is very convincing in her frustrated, desperate role.
397;From start to finish, THE SIXTH SENSE is a nearly flawless thriller / chiller.
398;M. Night Shyamalan is the master!This movie is excellent!
399;great characters, great acting and a unusual, never been done before story!Never pass up the chance to see a M. Night Shyamalan classic!
400;The Sixth Sense is a thrilling movie.
401;Kind of even a philosophical movie.
402;told and very well filmed.
403;And the boy plays absolutely brilliant!
404;A great up and coming talent!
405;The movie maitains its suspense throughout the entire length.
406;Haley Joel Osment is every bit as good as they say he is.
407;The ending is amazing, I didn't guess it and I highly doubt many people do, but at the end you can't believe you missed it.
408;watch the rules and clues at the end and then watch it again and pick out all the clues.
409;Pay close attention to the color red it is everywhere.
410;I recommend to everyone of all ages.
411;The first time you watch this film, you'll be shocked.
412;If you watch it more than twice, you'll spot pretend clues, and wonder if they mean anything.
413;And eventually, you will know the film back to front.
414;Director M. Night Shyamalan's breakthrough film is one of my all.
415;Haley Joel Osment (A. i.) plays a boy with the power to see ghosts .
416;shyamalan's Signs is another great scary flick, and for a simple reason: Shyamalan knows the secret to horror.
417;Shyamalan knows that what you imagine is scarier than what he can show you, and he uses it.
418;The Sixth Sense pulls you in and makes you feel for these characters before the resolution, followed by what has become one of the most famous twists in recent cinema history.
419;Special features include a featurette about religion and the afterlife in movies and a cool look at Shyamalan's storyboarding process.
420;( particularly if they had seen the far supirior jacob's ladder ) Nevertheless, it was well acted and Bruce deserves more accolades than he gets.
421;As a person who has actually, and intentionally, stayed in a haunted location and photographed real ghosts (yes, I've experienced the real thing) I was impressed with this movie's accurate portrayal of the discarnate and of ghostly phenomena.
422;dr. Crowe realizes that Cole's symptoms are remarkably similar to those of a former patient, and reviews tapes of that patients sessions.
423;the realism of this movie is what makes it so frightening.
424;For instance, the accurate depiction of the temperature dropping in the presence of a ghoist.
425;something most parapsychological authorities agree on.
426;thank you, M. Night Shyamalan (director) for not resulting to the usual special effects, or groaning chain.
427;This movie is sure to become a classic for all fans of supernatural horror, and those familiar with the real thing.
428;Psychological thrillers have always been a favorite story line for me.
429;But as Cole draws closer to Matthew and begins to verbalize his terrors, Matthew begins to draw away as he faces.
430;well, you have to watch the ending to know that, but when you do, you'll want to go right back to the beginning.
431;The movie features some of the best child acting (Haley Joel Osment) I have seen, plus his mother (Toni Collette) is a strong enough character to almost save the plot.
432;Nice moody atmosphere combines with the 'give them the plot in little bites' approach that forces the viewer to keep up dating their understanding of the movie.
433;It was very well acted by the main stars, especially young Haley.
434;His performance was certainly worthy of the nomination and probaly the Oscar as well, although I haven't seen Cider House to judge Micheal Caine's performance.
435;Bruce Willis did a fine job too, quite a change from the well.
436;As far as being worthy of the Oscar for best pic.
437;If you liked The Others or Night's newer movie Signs see this movie.
438;there are people whose films I like, those whose films I admire, those whose work I admire more than I like, and those whose work I like more than I admire.
439;At the ends of the spectrum are those whose work I both admire and like and those whose work I neither admire nor like.
440;The Sixth Sene is a perfect example of how people have become obsessed with parts of movies and not movies as a whole.
441;then comes the ending which is undeniably a great twist.
442;the Sixth Sense is nothing more than an average movie with a great ending.
443;They saw the opening beach sequence in that film and thought wow, that part was so good, the rest of the film has to be good.
444;It was a wonderful example of how Steven Spielberg cannot make a movie anymore without having something big to distract the viewer from the fact that the film is mediocre.
445;It holds interest throughout, and visuals are very effective.
446;One friend I went with did not understand, but I'm sure most of you will.
447;This ending makes just an above.
448;Stellar performances by all involved and excellent character development.
449;One of the stupidest movies I've ever seen.
450;There is NO surprise ending.
451;The movie should have been comedy of the year, due to special effects and acting.
452;I CAN say that I loved this movie.
453;I dislike more of his movies than I like, but in this one he is first rate.
454;Haley Joel Osment, who I had only seen twice before(Forrest Gump and the Jeff Foxworthy Show), also gives a terrific performance and should have an Oscar sitting on his shelf.
455;The commentary and deleted scenes added to my enjoyment.
456;I think kids might enjoy it too, as long as they had an adult there with them during some of the intense stuff.
457;This film very deservedly got an Oscar nomination for Best Picture and probably should have won.
458;The movie is good story almost as if it was being read to you.
459;It relies on the writing to gently bring you to the edge of your seat.
460;The musical score gives the movie incredible atmosphere and the acting is excellent.
461;It is the storytelling that makes it enjoyable.
462;This is seriously the greatest movie I have ever seen.
463;I recommend it to anyone.
464;The way in which Shylaman builds up the suspense is terrific, letting the audience wait until about halfway through the film before the first physical encounter with a ghost.
465;One of the main things that made the film so chilling is that the ghosts seem to have retained there injuries after they have died.
466;All the actors put up great performances, with Bruce Willis probably putting up the greatest performance of his life.
467;in the end The Sixth Sense is a good film but not a great film, only being let down by one or two less interesting scenes where nothing nuch goes on.
468;Theres an absolutely fantastic twist at the end.
469;I got this movie for a school project, but even before that I have always loved The Sixth Sense.
470;Rather, it is an in depth study of the human psychology.
471;This movie has intelligence, a phenomenal script, some of the BEST acting in years (especially from young Haley Joel Osment), and a truly touching message that rings true for all of humanity.
472;If it were possible, I'd give it more.
473;By far the best movie of 1999, and one of the best of the decade.
474;And please, communicate with each other.
475;Great movie and the cast was excellent.
476;The '99 film `The Sixth Sense' is a masterfully conceived and executed tale of the supernatural about a young boy named Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) who has the ability to see and converse with the spirits of the dead.
477;this is an amazing film that expertly utilizes a type of cinematic deception, slight of hand and misdirection that leads you to think you know what's going on only to shock you at the end.
478;Haley Joel Osment is amazing and Bruce Willis delivers a superb but subdued performance that allows his character to fly under the radar until the surprise ending.
479;I also loved the brief but emotive Olivia Williams in the role of Anna Crowe.
480;Don't get me wrong, I really enjoy Bruce Willis.
481;This was an extreamly well done and thought provoking movie.
482;With a well thought out story/plotline, excellent acting, and an extreamely excellent ending twist.
483;I mean most directors take about 2 to 3 movies before they at least start to make a good movie.
484;But in all fairness, it hard to compare with an excellent movie like this one.
485;overall one should like this movie again and again
486;This is a terrific movie.
487;Great screen play and acting, and it makes you think.
488;I thoroughly enjoyed it and have seen it several times now.
489;Gripping, chilling and enjoyable from start to finish.
490;The characters are great and the actors even better.
491;Hayley Joel Osment is a superstar waiting to happen.
492;the best child actor I have ever seen.
493;This film is an instant classic.
494;If you like psychological thrillers and suspense this movie lives up to its billing.
495;Shyamalan does a great job of setting up the tension using lighting on otherwise inanimate objects, like statues on buildings, as well as odd shots, like high above entrances, which at once create both a distance and tension.
496;Osment is very intelligent and holds a dark secret which Willis attempts to bring out.
497;line, cinematography, characters, and site locations all work together to the surprising climax and final revelation.
498;Everything I heard was true!
499;I was on the edge of my seat the whole time, biting my lip with anticipation!
500;The movie is ubelievably good, but plenty of reviewers have said that.
501;M. Night Shyamalan hit a towering home.
502;In a year (1999) noted for some good films this one stood head and shoulders above the rest.
503;This movie overshadowed another eerie thriller that year, Stir of Echoes, which is very much worth a viewing as well.
504;I also own this movie in the two.
505;I certainly recommend this movie to anyone wanting a three.
506;dimensional experience (sight, sound, and feeling the hairs on your arms stand on end and prickle!)
507;. . . and Haley Joel Osment is a wonder.
508;Willis' portrayal as the tormented child psychologist Malcolm Crowe is sensitive and compassionate, a beautifully realized, complete performance.
509;And Osment's performance as the disturbed child Cole who has the sixth sense is astonishing.
510;in my opinion, it's the best performance by a child actor in film since Patty Duke in The Miracle Worker .
511;The wonderful relationship that evolves between Malcolm and Cole is worth the price of admission alone.
512;Brilliant, disturbing, evoking laughter, tears, chills, and a great deal of thought, this is great film making.
513;Both feature Bruce Willis in the starring role and are eerily similar in their cinematic tricks.
514;what this film fails to deliver is the type of dramatic tension that is evident in such masterpieces as The Innocents (an immensely well.
515;In fact, Jacob's Ladder has almost the exact same ending as The Sixth Sense, but I've never seen or heard of M. Night Shyamalan giving credit to this earlier, superior, screenplay.
516;M. Night Shyamalan's sleeper hit The Sixth Sense is an outstanding surrealstic supernatural character study that showcases unusually restrained and effective acting by Bruce Willis as a dedicated child psychologist who after receiving an award for his superb work in his field gets an unexpected visit by a previous patient who shots Willis and then turns his gun on himself.
517;Haley Joel Osment, in an Oscar caliber performance, plays an emotionally distressed boy who is blessed or cursed with the ability to see and interact with the spirits of the dead.
518;making performance shines with more passionate human emotion and authenticfear than any child performance since Linda Blair in the Exorcist (1973).
519;The Sixth Sense will be remembered in years to come as an atmospheric suspence classic that cleverly dealt wih its subject honestly enough to make itself feel fresh and engaging everytime you watch it.
520;I have loved this film from the day I first saw it in the theatres some 10 years ago!
521;Altho' I always know the outcome, the excellent acting of (then) young Haley Joel Osment, and the palpable chemistry between him and both his mother (played by Toni Collette) and his therapist (played by Bruce Willis) make this movie a viewing pleasure time and again.
522;My favorite scene is at the end of the movie when he and his mother are in the car, and he's ready to talk about his secrets.
523;I would highly recommend seeing this film, as there is a little bit of something for everyone .
524;humor, suspense, drama, lost love, and reconciliation.
525;Willis and Osment are amazing.
526;This film should have won all the awards it was nominated for!
527;Its very sweet and leaves you with a good feeling!
528;This film is worth all its five stars and more, but what's up with amazon.
529;Collette is certainly worth mentioning .
530;her performance is terrific .
531;The Sixth Sense was THE film of 1999, and went on to become the most successful horror movie in the history of recorded film .
532;There were a number of highly successful horror films of the 1990's such as The Blair Witch Project, The Haunting, House On Haunted Hill and the Scream trilogy.
533;The Sixth Sense is a rare film that deals with ghosts and psychic ability in such a realistic manner, that was a welcome change from all the silly slasher.
534;and a perfect one to round off the decade.
535;winning child psychologist who is happily married to his considerably younger wife, Anna (Olivia Williams).
536;The film continues months later.
537;Malcolm's discovery in the end has to be one of the best and most shocking twists in cinematic history.
538;the factor that makes The Sixth Sense so superb is the extraordinary acting skills of Haley Joel Osment.
539;I have seen quite a lot of movies, and the acting of Osment in The Sixth Sense is absolutely amazing.
540;After each major scene in which something truly gripping occurs, the screen fades to black .
541;giving it a touch to it that makes it unique.
542;I remember watching this film last night on terrestrial TV, and (now a few years down the line after it's initial release) realising that a wide variety of scenes in The Sixth Sense have already reached classic status.
543;The one where the dead girl grabs Cole's leg from underneath her bed is a perfect example of this .
544;the expression on Cole's face making it all the more iconic.
545;Director M. Night Shyamalan is superb, and with classic films such as The Sixth Sense and the superb Signs, is definitely on his way to becoming the new Spielberg.
546;I have seen a lot of films in which Bruce Willis stars, and I have to say this is one of the best.
547;He takes a backseat to his macho stereotype, and the effects are very rewarding.
548;Willis is very believable as a softer, more gentle character in the form of Malcolm.
549;Of course, the film cannot be viewed day after day (as this would just be too repetitive), but once every three or four months still manages to thrill you in a way no other film did before it, or any film that will in the future.
550;Production and cast were flawless.
551;This is a very intelligent and well.
552;Watch this film from start to finish.
553;Yes, you will enjoy this film!
554;This is a must see .
555;I'm a huge Fan of Bruce Willis and suspenseful movies.
556;Would definitely recommend to others who are fans of Bruce Willis or fans of suspenseful movies as well.
557;In my opinion another excellent movie by M. night!
558;the photography, acting and story are spellbinding.
559;I saw it in the theater and I bought it.
560;The suspense is great especially if you like to be suddenly scared.
561;Thank you for the prompt delivery!
562;I don't do well seeing frightening movies in the theater but I did just fine with this one.
563;The intelligent script, novel idea, and terrific acting by the boy, Osment, and Willis made this film a sure.
564;Much much better and much scarier.
565;No real story/plot/characterization, just cinema atmosphere, a nice vogue look, lovely disconnected bits?
566;robotic Haley Joel Osment is cute, professional, denatured/stiff, a pint.
567;sized sensitive New Age adult.
568;M. Night Shyamalan is Spielberg minus Steven's occasional bursts of humor &/or interest in substantial subject matter.
569;This was a well acted movie with a surprising twist.
570;The main characters were well played out, and the ending twist was just unexpected.
571;This movie is one of my personal favorites because of the real.
572;life suspense you feel like you are in.
573;The story and the ending were so creative it makes you want to watch the movie again just to look at the small details, and there is always something that you miss.
574;Take my word for it that if you love thriller movies you better get this title.
575;The movies major suspense will have you glued to your seat.
576;That is until something moves though.
577;Loved the ending even though I knew the ending.
578;Would recommend this movie to all my friends.
579;For those of you who have not seen The Sixth Sense, you are in for a taunting, suspenseful ride!
580;Haley Joel Osment is a sure Best Supporting Actor Oscar contender, for he is one of the most superb actors I have seen in quite a while.
581;Bruce Willis shows that he is more than an action hero with a sensitive performance.
582;The Sixth Sense will frighten and amaze people with its storyline.
583;By the way, he did a great job of it.
584;Suddenly, it all makes sense and you look back over the movie and say, It fit, and I was fooled.
585;This is one of the best films I've seen in a long time, not in terms of depth or theme, but superb craftsmanship.
586;Sixth Sense contains one of the most original and well.
587;People who have not seen the film will be frightened and surprised at many turns.
588;The acting is extremely convincing on almost everyone's part.
589;The documentary is definitely worth it.
590;the acting is pretty good, although I don't think it was the Oscar.
591;i look forward to your response and thank you for your time.
592;This movie has an excellent cast.
593;emotional in movies, but in this one he is magnificent.
594;That's what makes a good scary movie.
595;This film was great when I saw it in the theater, so I figured I would love to own the film.
596;The relationships between the boy and his mother or between Willis' character and his wife made up a great part of the movie and were full of all the clichees we have to watch in any Hollywood tearjerker.
597;at the first 90% of it, in order to thrill us at the very last in the largest extent.
598;I think that's why this is one of the best movie this year since no(or very little is more appropriate) movies made you felt like playing a game.
599;undoubtedly the story is very creative, but I would doubted that the story is of a little bit inspired by a bestseller 'Sophie's World'.
600;A really clever movie which leads to a surprising end.
601;The main characters are quite believable and likeable.
602;This movie mainly for the twist at the end was one of the greatest movies I have ever seen in my young 19 years.
603;What I did like was the superior performance of Bruce WIllis as he as usual stole the movie.
604;That being said, the movie is M. Nights best.
605;I absolutely loved this movie.
606;i love suspense and it justkept building up through out each scene.
607;fi twist than this movie is so for you!
608;This was a good boost for up and coming director, M. Night Shyamalan.
609;A good role for diverse actor (yes, DIVERSE), Bruce Willis.
610;It does give you a chance to look at the clues throughout the movie.
611;Overall, I thought it was a good movie but not a great one like everyone else said it was!
612;Images of The Exorcist , The Shining , Angel Heart , and others raced through my mind.
613;And of course there were some good performances, most notably young Osment and Toni Colette (their moments together are the best in the film).
614;And, in accordance with the modern times, he went on and on about how much money the film made
615;Topping the charts and getting people to talk about something do not a great piece of art make.
616;Spare us the talk about making a cultural impact with this film because of the box office draw and people quoting the line I see dead people .
617;I wonder what other great films are going to be created by ball.
618;The Sixth Sense was an all around entertaining movie.
619;I watched it two nights in a row and the second night was just as enjoyable as the first.
620;By playing close attention, you notice little things throughout the movie that may not make sense at first but will make perfect sense in the end.
621;If you like drama suspense along with great writing great acting, then this is a must see!
622;and a young Bruce Willis, this is a perfect movie!Get ready to be watching TV on the edge of your chair.
623;This movie has a very interesting plot to it.
624;M. Night Shyamalan has done a wonderful job in bringing Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment together in this suspense thriller!
625;This movie has a very interesting ending also.
626;Further the movie was great, and I look forward to watching more movies by M. Night Shyamalan.
627;The movie tells you with its story, its tone, and its color that something will happen, but you can not put your finger on it until the end.
628;The genuine surprise ending added closure to a genuine 21st century scary movie.
629;It keeps you riveted to the screen the entire movie.
630;The actors are superb and the ending, oh what a clincher!
631;But other than that, it was a good movie.
632;And, if you have seen it then watching it with friends who haven't seen it before is exciting.
633;This movie spans lots of conversation after watching it.
634;The ending hit me like a bullet through the heart .
635;This was the best spooky movie I have seen in a long, long time.
636;I thoroughly enjoyed that it was not a scary movie packed with gruesome blood, guts, etc.
637;This movie really made you think!
638;The Sixth Sense will leave you wanting for more.
639;you get the feeling that you want to make sure you locked your front door.
640;Bruce Willis is excellent as Malcolm Crowe, an acclaimed child psychologist.
641;Also, his life was on top.
642;He and his wife were happily in love and he had just received an award from the city.
643;One day, Malcolm meets Cole Sear (brilliantly played by Haley Joel Osment.)
644;After a while, Malcolm starts to change his mind.
645;m. Night Shaymalan is a talented director and writer.
646;He is able to make The Sixth Sense spooky in a way that doesn't require too much special effects.
647;Just the perfect camera angles and music.
648;Also to note, Haley Joel Osment was nominated for an Oscar for best supporting actor.
649;Each actor/actress in this film had a brilliant performance.
650;The dialogue and flow of the movie made this suspenseful film an instant classic.
651;This psychological thriller lives up to the hype it received and it does not disappoint.
652;I've watched this film several times and each time, I see something new.
653;I really enjoyed this movie.
654;Rarely do I pay full theatre price three times to see a movie, but for this one I made an exception.
655;The story line was well written and the cast was chosen quite well.
656;It was full of surprises suspence.
657;The plot, the acting, the twists are just amazing.
658;Bought as a gift for my son, Bruce Willis turned in a good performance in a movie that keeps you interested.
659;I'm normally quite good at guessing film endings.
660;If you like a good thriller with a touch of the unexplained then I recommend this wholeheartedly.
661;a classic in the making.
662;I would recommend this movie to any one, supernatural buff or not you'll love it.
663;The film was especially intriguing, in my opinion, because it focused on the nature of fear rather than just being afraid.
664;This key point is what drives this impressive film.
665;Just as love, hate, envy, jealousy, and other emotions can connect people with one another, fear can be just as powerful a bond as the others.
666;Fear essentially is the gravitas of this film.
667;Everyone has a right to his or her opinion.
668;presently intelligent
669;Still, what I seek to communicate here is that sometimes, visionary directors want viewers to move past the surface and dig deeper, as archaeologists do, for the hidden meaning of things.
670;This is a film that has withstood the test of time.
671;It is that type of picture, which should be studied, as it is a near perfect film.
672;the Sixth Sense launched M. Night Shyamalan as a major writer and director with his own particular style of filmmaking.
673;This talented young man seems to have an innate gift for creating suspense and those subtle and not so subtle aspects of life that can cause us deep fear, things that truly frighten, without having to shove it in our faces.
674;ing their audiences to death, in order to somehow keep us interested.
675;These kinds of films have their place, however, the truly frightening films, like The Sixth Sense, rivets us to our chairs with subtle twists and turns, long suspenseful silences and the unexpected.
676;a good example of this subtlety is right at the beginning of the film.
677;The psychologist and his wife are having a celebration in their home.
678;He walks into the kitchen and the woman turns around revealing a battered face and fresh scars on her wrist from an attempted suicide.
679;See what you've done to me!
680;we all enjoy the occasional scare, and there's nothing like a good ghost story to do it.
681;What I find incredible about this film, though, is despite seeing it several times, knowing the story and its many surprises, it still manages to hold my attention and continues to create that feeling of dread in the pit of my stomach.
682;The word classic has been bandied around a lot and attributed to films that don't deserve the label, but The Sixth Sense, in my opinion, deserves to be called a true classic of the genre, as it will continue to be appreciated for years to come.
683;The Sixth Sense is one of the best.
684;written psychological thrillers I have ever seen.
685;There were many subtle clues throughout the film that lead to the surprising ending, and it was done brilliantly.
686;Bruce Willis is wonderful in this film.
687;He has proven that he is, indeed, a great actor.
688;And Haley Joel Osment has a brilliant acting career ahead of him.
689;Overall, an intense and thought.
690;provoking psychological thriller that you wouldn't want to miss!
691;This film is one of the few movies that I have ever seen that you can only experience once.
692;This was one of the best movies that I have seen in a long time.
693;This is not only an enjoyable film to watch, it's also very well acted and has a great climax.
694;This is by far the best thriller ever.
695;He gets a new patient, Cole (Osment) and it changes him to become a better man.
696;But something isn't right and powerful climax will freak you.
697;The deleted scenes and commentary are great and add more insight into this movie.
698;of special is great and gives you more things to look for as you watch the movie again.
699;Another great feature is the inclusion of a short film done by the director when he first got into film.
700;This movie proves what everybody already knows .
701;Seen in this light, casting Bruce as a walking corpse could be seen as an inspired decision.
702;Thank you Bruce for being Bruce.
703;We love you just the way you are, and at the end we're not too sad when we learn that you've been dead all along, because, like, we knew it, man.
704;I thought that this was a good movie and the performences were supberb but i dont think that one could watch it over and over again
705;I really enjoyed the Sixth Sense.
706;I think Haley Joel Osment played a very good role in this movie.
707;And Bruce Willis also played a good role and supported Haley Joel alot.
708;M. Night Shyamalan did a great job thinking this one up!
709;It will keep you guesing right up untill the end.
710;It's a real spooky thriller not easily disliked.
711;This film started Shyamalan's famous tradition of surprise endings.
712;The heart of soul of the film is Cole Sear, a disturbed nine year.
713;Actor Haley Joel Osment gives a stunningly mature and good performance, especially judging from the fact that he was not yet a teenager at the time.
714;He is uniformly believable, and his character is very real.
715;bruce Willis, playing the child phsychologist Malcolm Crowe, gives a very quiet performance, but still with plenty of feeling.
716;go that M. Night Shyamalan is a master at his craft.
717;The entire feel of the movie is perfect.
718;the screenplay is quite realistic, the music is great, and all the other supporting actors give smooth performances.
719;Watch it and you will be in for an enjoyable ride.
720;I love a good suspense movie.
721;This film proves once and for all what an amazing talent Bruce Norris is.
722;An incredible performance in an incredibly well written movie.
723;If you liked this you will also like A stir of echoes , I prefer it more.
724;In this film one brave boy learns to do that, and I hope we see a sequel.
725;time when it came out and, if memory serves me, was a good conversation piece among those who saw it at the theater.
726;It was very good but I didn't find it as the greatest movie ever as some did.
727;It is an involving story, however, and I've come to appreciate it more with multiple viewings.
728;i enjoyed both Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment as the two leads.
729;recent movie) Osment, meanwhile, is a terrific child actor, as he has proved in other films.
730;He's simply one of the best of his young generation.
731;He and Dakota Fanning are the two best child actors I've seen in many years.
732;It's a nice human interest story.
733;It is an extremely touching scene that brings tears .
734;a great moment in the film.
735;Though I won't go as far as to call it the best movie of 1999 ( American Beauty holds that spot), The Sixth Sense is a wonderfully unique, mysterious movie that keeps the viewer's attention and sympathy until the very end.
736;I am glad to see it nominated for best picture but hope A. b. ends up with the Oscar.
737;Regardless, Sixth Sense is a solid, enchanting movie.
738;One of the best i've seen in a while.
739;Anyway I still really liked it and I recommend it to any one who likes GOOD movies!
740;This is a pretty good movie, it wasn't all THAT scarry, but it was entertaining enough to watch.
741;This is a good movie!
742;it's still an incredible movie .
743;flick/Scream crowd, but amazing for the fans of things like The Shawshank Redemption .
744;And some of the scenes will freak you out more than make you jump.
745;It has all kinds of long deleted scenes that are great for those who have already seen it.
746;The resoulution could be better but is naturally better than any vhs.
747;The movie is just breath taking.
748;It's full of drama, suspense, and great acting.
749;One of Bruce Willis' best acting role's in any movie.
750;Plus you have to admire that kid.
751;I've never seen any kid be so good at acting that young.
752;This is a very thought provoking movie.
753;No doubt about it, this is THE most incredible movie I have ever seen!
754;Haley Joel Osment really lights up the screen with his amazing talents!
755;This movie leads you along a thrilling, chilling, spine.
756;tingling plot that will leave you with a feeling that will make the tiny hairs on the back of your neck stand up.
757;I love this movie to death and I recommend it to any movie freak like me, or anyone who actually knows a good movie when they see one.
758;Watch it and you'll see.
759;The psychological thriller has always been my favorite genre of film making.
760;Such films are more challenging in that it takes a special cohesiveness between a director, screenwriter, and cast to craft a story that will get inside the viewer's head and stay there days .
761;director M. Night Shyamalan before seeing this film, but I knew afterwards that this guy was indeed a gifted film maker/storyteller, cut from the Hitchcock mold, with a long and prosperous career ahead of him.
762;sized powerhouse Haley Joel Osment all made for a fantastic cast, but it was Shyamalan's masterful directing and storytelling that made this one of the best suspense films of all time.
763;That said, storywise, plotwise and actingwise, this is hands down the best supernatural film you will ever see.
764;Placed in the capable hands of writer/directer M. Night Shayamalan who proved he is a force to be reckond with as well as the very capable hands of actors Bruce Willis, Toni Colleti and Haley Joel Osment who well deserved the oscar nod this film rises above it's predesesors in that it reaches much more emotions than that of fear.
765;It reaches your heart as you watch this child deal with his 'gift' of sorts as well as Dr. Crowe (Willis) as he deals with the distance between him and his wife.
766;The ending is as shocking as they come and deffinatly earns itself recognition as Shyamalans best script (Unbreakable was good, and Village had its points but Signs was a complete mess) I have to say that I have always found Bruce to be an impressive actor, but I felt that he was far too undertapped.
767;It is truly touching as Crowe helps Cole find ways to make the ghost go away.
768;This is a great film that gives a new perspective to an old idea.
769;in other words this is the one that started them all, this is the reinvention of the ghost story and because of the MAJOR success of this film we have other gems like 'The Ring' and 'What Lies Beneath'.
770;The Sixth Sense has gone onto become the highest grossing thriller of all time so as you might image it's better than the trailer suggests.
771;Sense is a touching story of Cole, a confused young boy who sees ghosts and subsequently turns to a once.
772;Bruce Willis plays the part of Dr. Crowe to subtle perfection (I'll bet you never thought you'd see the word subtle to describe the man who brough us Die Hard and Armageddon).
773;The pieces start to come together and by the end provide us with a good jolt that will make repeat.
774;It's a clever twist which the director had been building to all along and won't be caught by anyone but the most keen of viewers.
775;It keeps you glued to your seat.
776;The little boy is a terrific actor whose deserves all the praise he is getting.
777;This is Bruce Willis' best part yet.
778;Trust me when I say it's worth it.
779;I thoght the movie was very well done.
780;It was nice to see athriller without it being rated R .
781;fest of these teenage slasher flicks comes the Sixth Sense, an effective thriller with a great screenplay and superb acting which turns out to pack quite an emotional wallop at the end.
782;Just don't let the hype ruin it as it always does with underappreciated movies such as the Blair Witch Project.
783;In August of 1999, The Sixth Sense opened worldwide and, since then, has been established as one of the more successful psychological thrillers in our time.
784;He is only 8 years old and he walks and talks like the common person his age.
785;The eerie atmosphere and music, the excellent acting, and the incredibly written script, and the twist at the end combine to make this a very satisfying experience.
786;I was never a fan of Bruce Willis before, but his performance in this film is perfect and has made me a fan.
787;Writer/diector M. Night Shyamalan found the just the right person to play this part, and drew out of him the best performance of his young career.
788;Shyamalan will be the next Spielberg for sure, as this is the best writing I've encountered in a script in a while.
789;His previous movie, Wide Awake, while not as good as Sixth Sense (or even in the same vein) is worth watching as well.
790;It shows M. Night Shamayalan's brilliance as a producer, director, and writer.
791;He incorporated one of his childhood fantasies into The Sixth Sense and added some of his own ideas giving it a brilliant storyline.
792;the color red) give it that added uniqueness.
793;Shamayalan proves that he'll become the next Steven Spielberg someday.
794;haley Joel Osment deserved his Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his role of Cole Sear.
795;This powerful performance excites many to discover his performances while he's growing up and as an adult.
796;the rest of the cast is amazing: Toni Collette, Bruce Willis, Trevor Morgan, Olivia Williams, etc.
797;Everybody, including Osment, has that special chemistry amongst one another.
798;They provoke their emotions into their audience.
799;This allows the audience to constantly watch it and learn new elements everytime.
800;Some films are just blessed from their conception through their finished product and The Sixth Sense is one of those films.
801;Everything just works to perfection here from the direction, scripting, casting, and the technical attributes.
802;This film is so effective that it would work even without it.
803;In my mind I think Shyamalan was spoiled by the success of this film.
804;He should realize that what made The Sixth Sense such a success was good story and good characterization.
805;He should be writing good stories and the endings will come naturally.
806;director Shyamalan sets it up.
807;Great performance from the kid, too!
808;The acting was very strong, though, and together with the superb cinematography (Philadelphia never looked better) they are perhaps the only two reasons to watch.
809;If any movie is worth watching, it is this one!
810;I give the warning that it starts off awfully slow, but the second half makes it all worth your time.
811;Not exactly a horror flick, this movie will keep you on your toes with suspense and unbelievable twists.
812;Very happy with the product.
813;Suprise, Bruce Willis can act without a shoving a gun or fist in the views face!
814;Old dogs can learn new tricks and Bruce contributes to a fantastic story line and directing effort that leaves your mouth open, your mind racing, and your heart thumping when you leave the theater.
815;At the heart of this exceptional film is a moving performance by Hollywood action star Bruce Willis (of all people) as a child psychologist trying to help a young boy who seems to be haunted by visions of ghosts.
816;What director M. Night Shyamalan has done here is nothing short of amazing.
817;An involving, emotional, and frightening film that recalls the days when vile special effects were not needed to terrify the audience.
818;Instead, Shyamalan juxtaposes between subtle visual suggestion and bold, striking images to constantly calm and then shock the viewer and it's a strategy that works beautifully.
819;But as terrifying as it is, THE SIXTH SENSE is also a film about loss and redemption and love and it will easily move you to tears.
820;Haley Joel Osment is superb in the role of Cole Sear, the small child haunted for reasons he doesn't fully understand.
821;Child stars like this don't come along very often and here he gives a performance that is both heartbreaking and assuring.
822;it is such a strong performance that we believe every word he says even when the characters on the screen beside him don't.
823;But the key performance in the film, the one that sets the story down it's unforgettable path comes from a most unlikely source: ex.
824;It is an amazing bit of acting that not only sets up the story but also defines it.
825;THE SIXTH SENSE is one of the best films of 1999 and deserves a place in your home library.
826;The Sixth Sense was one of the best movies last year, and for good reason.
827;Haley Joel Osment did an amazing job in this movie.
828;he has got to be one fo the best actors, young OR old, I have ever seen.
829;Bruce Willis did an amazing job, too.
830;I find this movie very interesting, are their people like the young man.
831;The ending tears me up every time.
832;The Sixth Sense takes us into the world of the supernatural.
833;the movie offers plenty of twists in the movie that offered me the chance to keep guessing and guessing.
834;toni Collette plays the kid's mother who delivers in my opinion a great performance.
835;Bruce Willis'performance is very sentimental and he is worth taking the time to watch.
836;i think he is that good.
837;the Sixth Sense delivers all the goods.
838;6th Sense is slow, but a very enjoyable movie if you have the patience to bear with it.
839;Incredible twist at the end.
840;Very well compiled and edited.
841;Worth watching over and over.
842;Probably one of my 10 best movies of all time.
843;Keeps you guessing all the way through.
844;well, what can i say that hasn't already been said?
845;we see throughout the movie that their relationship has hit a snag, and it takes the coming together of reclusive doctor and the frightened young boy to bridge the gap of communication between both couples.
846;on this level, the movie is excellent, and this is what m. night shyalaman was attempting to do.
847;enjoy the scary parts too, but this movie is about human relations and communication.
848;A true 5 star movie if'll you'll very see one.
849;Cole Sear, played by Haley Joel Osment is incredible in the film and should win a oscar, and so is Willis(who I'm a big fan of).
850;The story is excellent, and ending the most powerfull for years, it makes you wanna watch it all over again.
851;My co. worker and I sat perfectly still without conversing the entire time .
852;The ending was the best and not at all what we expected.
853;The movie was so good that I wanted to watch it again once I got home.
854;I got the distinct impression that something was down there with her.
855;Then the story jumps forward a year.
856;It was the chilling stories behind their appearances.
857;The conclusion will surprise most of you because the movie's hints are so subtle that you don't even notice them until it hits you in the face.
858;This is one of my favorite movies and I just had to watch it with a family member that had never seen it before.
859;Overall, this movie brings a quite slow and calm story line with little eerie in it but still, it is good.
860;The thing that capture my attention in this movie is the excellent performence by the young Haley Joel Osment.
861;Despite his age, he managed to act(well, I have to say)extremely well.
862;I kind a amazed by the way he acted.
863;He is so cool and he managed to express his inner feelings, thus making the cold and solemn situation appears in the entire movie.
864;I've never came across any kid that can perform that good and I never expect such excellent perfomence from him.
865;He indeed has very good talent in acting(he's just 11 years old).
866;Although I said it is quite boring, but there is one part in the movie that I feel is interesting.
867;It is the ending which is a big twist to the entire story.
868;With the message that this movie brings and such outstanding performence by the actors(especially Haley Joel Osment), you won't be suprised that people watch this movie again and again.
869;Even I myself had watched it for times to understand the message it brings and the true essence of this movie.
870;This movie was made perfect.
871;The acting, the story, the pull of the audience, the way it was made, the beginning, the end, it was all good.
872;I tell you, this movie is awesome!
873;Watch it the first time and be a spectator: just go with the flow.
874;watch it the second time to gain a greater understanding of what you did not 'see' the first time.
875;It's nice to see The Sixth Sense out in a super deluxe edition.
876;Oh, and the third one is an interesting look into how Night uses storyboards to help him in the film making process.
877;The segment from Night's first horror film, which I found amusing, is missing.
878;The packaging is superior and the movie looks and sounds great.
879;There is a load of features on this disc, and the best part is the anamorphic widescreen presentation.
880;One of the features is the first film done by the director when he was a child, along with several trailer and tv spot commericals.
881;The picture is excellent, but as with all quiet dramas, you aren't going to impressed by the sound.
882;I was surprised to find my favorite movie, second only to the Godfather.
883;This is one of the sweetest most emotional films I've ever watched because to me, the concept that a small boy could find the courage to face his fears in the very thing he fears most, is beautiful.
884;I enjoyed the performance of the two main actors as well as the music by one of my favorite composers.
885;Nevertheless, this movie is a great example of a beautiful story portrayed in an inconventional way.
886;laughing as I said it.
887;star rating, I liked it.
888;This movie is a really good suspense.
889;The characters are well played.
890;M. Night Shymalan keeps the audience guessing right up to the end.
891;The sixth sense was a good movie.
892;This is the best thrill ride ever!
893;I had a lot of fun watching this movie and got freaked out of my wits watching it alone in my basement at night.
894;Haley Joel Osment is going to be a really good actor if he keeps making movies, which I hope he does.
895;Bruce Willis is Bruce Willis bringing stardom to this already great movie.
896;It was one of the most unexpected endings that I have ever witnessed.
897;It was overall, a wonderfully, entertaining, thrill ride that after three times seeing it, I still want to see it.
898;M. Night Shyamalan would once again prove his brilliance with scary movies with Unbreakable also starring Bruce Willis, and then again with Signs, starring Mel Gibson.
899;A very freaky, movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat, I promise.
900;The Sixth Sense is a rare Hollywood gem that came along in a year full of flop movies such as The Haunting and The Blair Witch Project (not that there is anything wrong with those films
901;Packing in big crowds and delivering a thrilling a suspenseful joyride of excitement and talent, director Shyamalan's film is one that will not soon be forgotten.
902;I shall stop here, for going on will ruin the rest of this masterpiece.
903;The ending is, by far, Hollywood's most brilliantly conceived ending to date, and the suspense leading up to it is well worth the wait.
904;The performances between Willis and Osment are astounding, and their chemistry as patient.
905;son was perceived brilliantly by the director, who also wrote the screenplay.
906;Each question or mystery solved is yet another brought up, and the intensity of each moment is evident.
907;An original work of art, comparable to The Silence of the Lambs.
908;Once Haley Joel Osment enters the picture
909;The script is hypnotic, the camerawork carefully considered, and the final suckerpunch one of the best in cinematic history.
910;finally, the greatest triumph of The Sixth Sense is to bring the supernatural horrors so close to home that they become normalized.
911;Each click takes you to the next preview.
912;5 or 6 clicks gets you to the main feature.
913;The less you know the more you will enjoy it.
914;I have always been a believer in the after.
915;life, and this movie shows such a realistic portrayal of the writers opinion of the spirit world.
916;Haley Joel Osment, who plays the little boy who can see dead people, gives an incredible emotional performance.
917;And this has to be Bruce Willis' finest performance to date.
918;this movie will hold your attention and make you think.
919;I like these kind of movies!
920;Sixth Sense captivated the 5 of us at my place as we watched the movie along with our big bags of buttered popcorn.
921;He certainly deserved an Oscar or honorary award for his outstanding performance.
922;Toni Collette did a pretty good job with her American accent.
923;We enjoyed the twist and I must admit, I did not work out what was going on until the film allowed us to realize it.
924;Thoroughly enjoyable nonetheless and watching it a 2nd time around should be worthwhile.
925;The Sixth SenseThe Sixth Sense (1997) directed by M. Night Shyamalan, which he wrote and plays the part of Dr. Hill, a psychiatrist, is a timely masterpiece.
926;Shyamalan was born in India where belief in reincarnation is very strong.
927;What some have only imagined or wholly sensed he brings to life on film.
928;Individuals do sense sometimes their loved ones who have passed on are right beside them.
929;One theme within both films is that of coming to terms with oneself and to be at peace.
930;This was accomplished for Sam when he was able to communicate his message through Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg), thus saving Molly from certain death.
931;Cole for his part learns to face his fears, and works with his gift instead of against it.
932;He helps the dead girl communicate a message to her father about her death.
933;Through the process Crowe walks with Cole, afterwards he is able to let go, but first he whispers into his wife's ear how much he loves her.
934;what makes this film and others like it so interesting is that our society has within it a sub.
935;The Sixth Sense is a great film for those of us with imagination and also for those without imagination.
936;This script is packed with action.
937;If so, I'll be very anxious to see what comes next from this talented person.
938;As far as The Sixth Sense, like most people it caught me, held me, riveted me to my seat, then surprised the heck out of me.
939;and hey, I liked the Earthling.
940;With that said, I thought The Sixth Sense did live up to its hype, and was amazed at the performance of not only Osment, but also Bruce Willis' surprising, understated performance.
941;I also enjoyed how the movie sent honest.
942;Between 1 and 10, The Sixth Sense deserves a solid 8, and it's a film that I am anxious to see again.
943;Best movie that Shyamalan made.
944;gory thrillers or suspenseful psychological thrillers.
945;about everybody in my family has seen this movie and it is now our all time favorite movie.
946;and the acting was excellent.
947;and haley joel osment was great too.
948;Sixth Sense is a great movie.
949;The first time i saw it in theatres i was scared to look under my bed that night :) Now the effect has worn off, but i still love watching the movie.
950;There is a lot of suspense, and the acting was superb.
951;I found the deleted scence section to be very entertaining.
952;Its neat to see what has been cut from a movie.
953;Another feature I liked was one were the director showed one of his early attempts as a youngster at making a scary movie.
954;If you enjoy movies about the afterlife or paranormal stories then you will like this movie.
955;The Sixth Sense hit all of the right notes right on the button and worked really well.
956;the story of a boy who communicates with dead people's spirits and who consults with a psychologist, is perfectly directed by M. Night Shyamalan.
957;The excellent screenplay was also written by Mr. Shyamalan, who demonstrates being able to translate a vivid imagination onto the screen.
958;bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette head the talented cast.
959;Each of these three actors acts wonderfully in this movie.
960;It has a great deal of added features.
961;The ending was great, and until the ending I had no clue what would happen.
962;The deleted scenes and rules/clues feature are great.
963;The Sixth Sense is an essential film for those who search for creativity and originality on screen.
964;It's a wild rollercoaster ride from beginning to end.
965;The tension mounts slowly but surely, and it's pretty much a supernatural sleuthing masterpiece, where when you watch it the second time round, you realize you had missed out some things out in the first viewing.
966;This one you must see to believe.
967;then the suprise hit me like a ton of bricks in the face!
968;If you have not seen the film, do not ask anybody about it, just see it.
969;Every minute is worth it.
970;This and Unbreakable are the best movies one can watch if you like to think and wonder what is going on with the story and the people behind the story.
971;Mindless action is just that!
972;The innocence of a child who has the love, respect and guidance from an open minded child psychologist.
973;It is generally considered an asset for a movie to make its audience identify with its characters.
974;But at least the actors are easy to make fun of.
975;Okay, so I am in love with Bruce.
976;If you love endings with a twist (think Ususal Suspects ), you will thourghly enjoy this movie.
977;Great little tricks in this movie that are fun to try and find.
978;I found it to be suspenseful, scary at times, and thought.
979;Haley Joel is so cute in this movie.
980;Pure and simple: the best horror film of the 90s, and the most moving and transcendent horror film in many, many years.
981;earned sob by the film's end, please resign from the human race.
982;Unlike it's predesessors 'The Exorcist' and 'Omen'(which also featured a boy), The sixth sense is a much more intense and powerful movie, both emotionally and psychologically.
983;the affliction and pain that Osment brings to the screen is so overwhelming and powerful, it's scary to think where all that talent comes from, more so than all the creepy scenes in the movie put together.
984;His screen presence and emotions eminates from his acting to the audience, even moving some to tears.
985;His craftsmanship and meticulous attention to subtleties will amaze even the harshest critics.
986;and the best thing about the movie?
987;The fact that you can go back after watching it the first time, and see all the events and moments in the movie that have enabled the greatest audience deception in movie.
988;5 stars for the best of 1999!
989;The Sixth Sense is a great movie!
990;This is definately a movie that after you see it once, you'll want to see it again.
991;This movie is very interesting, wether you are seeing it for the first, second, third, fourth.
992;I never get tired of watching this film, I love it.
993;Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment are great the acting is fantastic and when I first watched it, it made me cry!It's about a therpaist (Willis) and a troubled young boy (Osment) It's clear to see the young boy Cole can see Ghosts which frightens him he confides in his therapist so they try to find out what the Ghosts want from Cole and helping them.
994;The sixth sense is a remarkable and distinct movie.
995;The depreciation of this movie is significant because of the finale
996;Understand , most of its magic is gone once you know what it's all about.
997;Since my previous review never seemed to have made it to the posts, I will take a moment to reitterate what you didn't read.
998;The movie is wonderful, A true work of film art that should be honored.
999;This movie was wonderfully horrifying!
1000;The ending was a great twist and really gave this movie that something extra.
1001;The little boy did an amazing job that should have given him the Oscar for Best supporting Actor.
1002;Watch this movie with the lights out!
1003;it is a great movie that gets better all the time.
1004;Best of it's kind, and excellent script with superb acting.
1005;This movie is one of the most intriguing I've ever had the pleasure to watch.
1006;The first time you watch this movie you'll be drawn into the characters
1007;the Sixth Sense is going to take you on a roller coaster.
1008;One moment you'll feel love, despair, shock, happiness and then fear as the plot offers more twists and turns that a labyrinth.You'll be shocked at the ending of this one as it comes from out of left field.
1009;Watch the movie again for a second time and you'll pick up on things that should have given the ending away, but were so subtle that they didn't.
1010;i enjoyed this movie a lot more the second time I watched it.
1011;Suggested for mature youngsters and all adults.
1012;The Sixth Sense appeals to that oft.
1013;Only one Divine voice offers reliable direction.
1014;Overall, this movie's technical aspects impressed me.
1015;Was the ending a surprise really?
1016;This always makes me suspicious.
1017;Granted, The Sixth Sense was superior with its story, its stylistics and its suspense.
1018;Willis's performance was understated and skillful.
1019;It was well crafted, suspenseful, and completely unexpected in the cinema when it appeared.
1020;In my humble opinion, THE SIXTH SENSE was the last great horror movie of the cinema in the 20th century.
1021;Third, and last (but not least), is the twist ending that occurs.
1022;This twist is perhaps the greatest sting.
1023;shayamalan weaves elements of such great horror movies as CARRIE, THE SHINING, and POLTERGEIST into his film
1024;Willis and Osment, as well as Toni Collette's performance as Osment's equally troubled mother, are at the center of this intriguing thriller.
1025;See it
1026;And I thought good movies were all gone.
1027;I first approached Sixth Sense only as a welcome relief from movies saturated with gratuitous sex and Hollywood match.
1028;The movie had such a fantastic plot and character dynamics, it was gripping from the beginning.
1029;The twist at the end comes unexpectedly and suddenly!
1030;It's worked very well into the fabric of the story and only someone who knows the secret can see the hints throughout the film (at which point they seem almost blatantly obvious!)
1031;I'm glad I gave in, though, because this is one of the best films I've seen in quite some time.
1032;The plot is air tight and the emotional rollercoaster that it takes you on leaves you breathless in the end.
1033;I would HIGHLY recommend this movie to anyone who's a fan of suspense.
1034;There's always something new to discover in the viewing.
1035;for all these reasons, I give the movie a solid five stars.
1036;One of the best of the year.
1037;The best M. Night film made next to Signs.
1038;Haley Joel Osment was so cute.
1039;He was perfect as Cole.
1040;I didn't understand it at first and thought it was going to be terrible, but turned out to be one of the best scary movies I have ever seen.
1041;A true 5 star movie if'll you'll very see one.
1042;Cole Sear, played by Haley Joel Osment is incredible in the film and should win a oscar, and so is Willis(who I'm a big fan of).
1043;The story is excellent, and ending the most powerfull for years, it makes you wanna watch it all over again.
1044;In fact, it was very good.
1045;Bruce Willis was extremely good and so was little Haley.
1046;The story line was great and I just love being scared!
1047;up they had was wonderful!
1048;All the actors worked well together and the whole movie was a big success.
1049;The mother sees the balls of light and the scaredeness so she can help.
1050;I think it's a good message about learning and being friendships, and scary, but not too much, except for Mr. Wills.
1051;She is sleeping and her heat is broken, then Mr. Bruce cries and gives her a blanket.
1052;i have always been a twist.
1053;this film absolutely is masterpiece of scary flick realm.
1054;This widely acclaimed phsycological, supernatural, etc. thriller, as it has been called, is really a movie about faith.
1055;Although it is designed for people of philosophic values, it also uses suspense and chilling sequences to attract a wide range of viewers.
1056;Not any specific faith or religion, but faith in your self as well.
1057;Here is how I interpreted it: The Sixth Sense seperates all people into to classes
1058;Those with faith usually come out strong in times of crisis.
1059;It is rare to find a scary movie that actually does just that.
1060;This is a unique story, uniquely told.
1061;Many films promise a twist, that'll knock you off your feet.
1062;etc, and you usually end up saying THATS the big surprise ??
1063;But, I must say, this film really delivers.
1064;Not only is the acting great, but the subtle unfolding of the story has just the right pacing and rhythym to make the hairs stand up on your neck.
1065;His performance is the main reason this film is so credible.
1066;I've just watched this film again, and it is just as powerful, moving, and chilling as on the first viewing.
1067;Call me shallow, but I like to be swept up in the experience of what I'm actually seeing.
1068;This film totally succeeds, not only in entertaining you, but in making you think, scaring the heck out of you, and moving you emotionally.
1069;(See: (or don't) The Others.)
1070;I feel this film, with its deft direction, and fine cast, will stand the test of time, and become a classic.
1071;This is one fantastic film that will keep you on the edge of your seat and at the same time makes you feel comfortable watching it with your family.
1072;the emotional undertones and the intelligence involved in the filmmaking is nothing short of excellent and the actors and technicians have done a marvellous job.
1073;He deserved it many times over, than the person who won that year.
1074;I agree this film is 5 years old and most cinema enthusiasts have already seen the film.
1075;This is a fascinating and clever story that is well filmed but poorly crafted.
1076;Plot holes abound and Director/Writer M. Night Shyamalan has to fudge all over the place to keep the surprise ending a surprise.
1077;the acting was fair to excellent.
1078;bruce Willis gave a good performance, but he is out of his element playing the sensitive and self doubting type.
1079;His forte is playing the tough, strong courageous type and he would best serve his career by staying with those types of parts.
1080;He gave an excellent performance and was the linchpin that held the whole film together.
1081;He was very versatile in his portrayal of various emotions.
1082;i rated this film a 7/10.
1083;On the contrary, I was floored by a very powerful story.
1084;The plot was written with incredible detail and the performances were commendable.
1085;Osment stole the show, and in my humble opinion he sold us the story.
1086;But the fun of this movie is watching for the clues.
1087;I liked it because it confronts ghosts and the undead in an un.
1088;While I don't think its terribly frightening, there are a few chilling moments.
1089;this is a great election.
1090;time favourite movies for a number of reasons and it's nice to see that even after a decade, this film ages so well and is still fun to watch.
1091;The unexpected twist is a key reason for what makes this film work so well and yet unlike Silence .
1092;even when you know the ending, the excellent treatment of the various other themes mentioned earlier makes it still watchable.
1093;This film like a true classic rewards repeated viewings very well.
1094;The Special Features includes very good making.
1095;Bruce Willis has done some of his best work on this film too.
1096;This is an excellent film that ages well and should be in every film.
1097;Last night I did, and Iwas very upset and what I saw.
1098;Haley Joel Osment turns in a great performance as a young boy who sees dead people.
1099;bit thrillers like Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer, we have a film that doesn't use violence and screaming women with tight shirts to put you on the edge of your seat.
1100;Needless to say Bruce Willis turns in another stellar performance as the psychologist who helps little Cole (Osment) with his odd 'gift'.
1101;Plus you get to see the first film by director M. Night Shyamalan.
1102;even knowing the ending it still is fun to watch more then once.
1103;just gets stupider every time you hear it.
1104;Great movie to add to your collection and a great deal at only a penny.
1105;It's a bit of a creepy and suspenseful movie, if you can get caught up in the story.
1106;Okay, having said this, I still find The Sixth Sense to be an engaging and interesting movie.
1107;Here and there it's startling and, here and there it has great emotional impact.
1108;the movie is very well done in every way.
1109;Actor Osment is convincing as a troubled little boy.
1110;Willis is excellent also, but I have come to expect that of him.
1111;rated movie now and then.
1112;All of the supporting cast are excellent.
1113;It was an engaging, thought provoking and even somewhat thrilling movie.
1114;Relax and enjoy it, if you can.
1115;, but I really enjoyed him in this movie.
1116;The Sixth Sense is a movie that lets us exercise the 'ol bean while getting good and scared in the bargain.
1117;The plot is so well.
1118;It's about horrible things, but it's actually a kind, quiet movie, which I think is a big part of its appeal.
1119;That and the surprise ending, of course.
1120;It is simple and perfect and absolutely necessary for the film to end as it must.
1121;the acting is as spare and quiet and excellent as the film deserves.
1122;And Osment was definitely deserving of his Oscar nomination.
1123;Osment shows the quicksilver intelligence as well as the vulnerability of children with astonishing skill.
1124;The last scene he appears in, when he and Willis say goodbye, is exceptional, the more so after a second viewing.
1125;The Sixth Sense is the biggest grossing suspense movie of all time, so maybe there's hope for we filmgoers after all.
1126;And if Mr. Shyamalan keeps making movies like this, we all have a lot to look forward to.
1127;When this movie came out, it was a surprise hit and was on the top 10 list of highest grossing American films of all time.
1128;this movie has all the elements of a perfect movie: great character development, suspense, great acting, and an excellent story line.
1129;This disk is has high production values.
1130;When you go to the menu, it even has an errie visual and music.
1131;The deleted scenes are wonderful.
1132;The director is taking you into the editing process of the film.
1133;I agree with the director's decisions to delete the scenes he did, but they are also wonderful.
1134;The rules and clues, which I believe are also on the video, are also wonderful.
1135;The director seems to genuinely be a happy man who likes his fans.
1136;Though the storyline is pretty hard to follow, the first time is always the best.
1137;Both actors are extremely believable and well placed.
1138;I would recommend this movie to viewers who like intense, but not too intense suspence and who can catch onto movies well.
1139;The acting is awsome, and so is the story.
1140;And the best part, the ending, thats the WOW!
1141;part, damn it's a good ending.
1142;Well, this is one of the best films I have ever seen, and I was certianly not dissapointed!
1143;What can I say people, this movie is a masterpiece.
1144;Such a great script and direction.
1145;This is definitely one of Bruce Willis best performances.
1146;its just a great movie.
1147;It is a very rare movie that can actually have you on the edge of your seat and straining your ears to hear all the dialogue.
1148;this one managed to do this to me.
1149;What a wonderful little actor this boy is!
1150;An exceedingly well crafted and written film
1151;bruce Willis is fast proving to be an excellent actor, not just a fast action hero.
1152;His interaction with the boy is sensitive and sympathetic.
1153;it fully deserves the 5 stars I have given it.
1154;It's great, but does the Blu.
1155;I know I did, and I was delighted to find that all loopholes appear closed, and all conflicts seem resolved .
1156;I appreciated that sense of craftsmanship, and look forward to seeing this one again.
1157;In such cases, the remainder of Bruce Willis's body of work will likely interest you more
1158;I went to see it at the cinema with my husband when it first came out, and to tell you the truth I wasn't expecting much.
1159;My husband is a big fan of Bruce Willis and always wants to see his movies.
1160;I was glued to my seat the whole time.
1161;This is such a brilliant film, that everybody should see it at least once.
1162;Thanks for the reasonable price.
1163;This is an intriguing movie with a unique premise.
1164;Ok, I have seen this masterpiece 3 times at the theater and decided I might as well just own the video and pop my own buttery kernals at home.
1165;Sixth Sense is a savvy, smart, sensational film satisfyer.
1166;I still remember my everyone elses reaction, at that one moment, when waves of .
1167;one of the best parts of the video, is when the producers and writers review the clues of the movie.
1168;The ghost element is well done, though, but Shyamalan can do better ( Unbreakable ).
1169;The pictures, sound and extras are great.
1170;The Sixth Sense is an AMAZING example of cinamagraphic art!
1171;This movie literally PULLS you in
1172;This movie will keep you riveted, and best of all, has a SURPRISE TWIST at the end that will SHOCK you!
1173;In my opinion, The Sixth Sense is a mystery thriller that you absolutely MUST see for yourself!
1174;The Sixth Sense movie arrived at my house in a timely fashion.
1175;I forgot how much I loved this movie.
1176;This movie is a classic and keeps you on the edge of your seat.
1177;In the end of the movie there is a twist that you couldn't expect.
1178;Over all a great movie that you can watch again and again.
1179;the ending has to be seen to be believed, it leaves you gasping with amazment as you realise what you'd been seeing was not really what was happening in the film .
1180;it was basically a distorted view of the lead character .
1181;The thing that makes this movie such a hit is the way it leaves you open mouthed and shocked at the twist at the end, with no prior warning the film leaves you with multiple unanswered questions, and clears up the scraps from earlier on.
1182;Is this not what a good movie should do?Away from the storyline, the acting is brilliant, Bruce Willis is the major character actor here, but supporting performances from the little Osment and the supporting cast are first rate.
1183;The way Osment manages to portray an emotional scene in the car with his on screen mother makes you wonder just how much talent this little boy has.
1184;A rare movie that is universally popular, and you don't need to sit there thinking before watching this movie 'Will this be my type of movie' it will.
1185;He is able to see, hear and speak to dead people.
1186;The Sixth Sense is a bit more intense.
1187;it makes you wonder how common Cole's sixth sense really is.
1188;This is one of the best films I have seen in a long time.
1189;I found this movie to be very clever and oddly moving.
1190;I can't really say it's a masterpiece, however.
1191;As a night's entertainment, it can't be beat.
1192;And it really is a film that demands at least two viewings (once to experience it, and once to check out the clues and to make sure that it really holds together).
1193;There have been many ghost movies out, but few of them have really been worth seeing.
1194;This movie, however, is great in every aspect!
1195;The plot is excellent, and full of twists you'll never see coming.
1196;The acting is simply incredible.
1197;Haley Joel Osment is incredible in his portayal of a small boy named Cole Sear who is haunted by spirits of the dead.
1198;Bruce Willis is really believable in his part portraying a child psychologist with serious problems of his own.
1199;The cinematography and excellent plot come together to create an eerie, ghastly experience.
1200;This package is more than the delivery at the end.
1201;The whole trip is so expertly planned that it should be hard to be disappointed when the still intreaging destination is finally reached.
1202;most everyone already knows that the little boy in this movie sees ghosts.
1203;Most everyone knows that the kid playing the part (Haley Joel Osment) got great reviews.
1204;It keeps you in the mood, even when it moves at a languid, dream.
1205;The scary scenes are made more so by their unannounced and rather simple entrance onto this background.
1206;From my perspective, it enhanced the effect.
1207;the cast was overall great in this film.
1208;Willis' portrayal of the psychiatrist as restrained, somewhat removed, and at times almost dazed and vaguely confused, works the plot like a good mule works the ground.
1209;There won't be any trumpets for it, but the furrows are straight and deep, and the job well done.
1210;the most impressive part of this film was the intensly moving way it portrayed this child's fear.
1211;A great film I can't forget or stop thinking about for weeks.
1212;But, it is very good.
1213;This movie stands under it's expectations fully.
1214;It is a great movie with a terrific script.
1215;This is Wilis best performance ever and Haley Joel Osmond deserved his oscar nomination.
1216;Destined to become a classic.
1217;Bruce Willis's most famous role and the best suspense movie created, this movie will keep you at the edge of your seat.
1218;As the movie gets tenser every scene, you'll realize that it is worth watching, a collectors item because Hollywood don't produce great movies like this anymore.
1219;I saw this great, surprising film one month ago, and even now I can't stop thinking about it.
1220;Mostly, I'am very critical about Hollywood productions, but I want to give my compliments to the cast producers of this brilliant movie.
1221;When I compare this film to European ones, I can say that The Sixth Sense can be called an American movie with an European character.
1222;But also the raising excitement through both music and perfect acting are giving this film all the aspects to be very original succeful.
1223;I think The Sixth Sense earns the right to be called a masterpiece!
1224;Everyone who haven't seen the movie at this time, I'll just say one thing: See it!
1225;This was such an awesome movie that had me on the edge of my seat.
1226;Haley Joel Osment (the little boy) deserves a BIG OSCAR for his convincing role, amazing emotions and facial expressions!Bruce Willis as always is a great actor and he managed BRILLIANTLY to act with Haley Joel Osment in making this wonderful drama.
1227;The film might seem boring in the middle but manages to pick the events up and surprise everybody.
1228;i recommend this movie to all audiences of all ages, to the young it is a thriller and to adults it is an emotional drama.
1229;This is the kind of movie that you'd watch for the first time to be surprised, then watched for the second time to be understood.
1230;the film was great, it ties you into your seat, you like every moment of it.
1231;It was great my whole family liked it.
1232;this movie has a great script, an even better cast and a very surprising ending.
1233;Osment is very talented for a little kid, and I hope to see him in more things!
1234;I love this movie and watch it regularly just like Shyamalan's other film Signs .
1235;His movies are emotional and of course scary and you really get into the movie.
1236;One of the best movies with Bruce Willis.
1237;The cut scenes are interesting, especially the ending which was cut (person opinion is that I liked the cut ending better than the real one).
1238;Suspense, intrigue, a little gore, striking imagery and continuity.
1239;This is not a scary movie, this is one of the most life.
1240;The acting is superb, the plot is imaginative and suspensful, and the ending gives me chills every single time I watch it.
1241;[Haley Joel Osment's performance was stunning.
1242;Why Michael Caine, wonderul as he is, won the best supporting actor Oscar award for Cider House Rules is simply beyond me.]
1243;When you are told that the twist is meant to be greater than The Usual Suspects you think you are in for a right treat.
1244;Maybe next time I won't be so quick to listen to others and anticipate great expectations.
1245;the film however, was one of the most atmospheric movies I have ever seen and the acting was superb.
1246;I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and the story was cleverly constructed.
1247;This film needs to be watched in the dark with surround sound, the music and effects are captivating.
1248;U feel tricked, manipulated and utterly on the edge because of the greatness of the work.
1249;The twists, the characters, the ACTORS(especially Haley Joel Osment) and the shivering finale makes this a grand finale for the closing of the 20th Century(with The Matrix of course).
1250;The story is good but morbid.
1251;It's sometimes disgustion and frightening.
1252;At all it's good and I recommended it.
1253;It's a very good horror movie with a great plot and screenplay.
1254;The ending is surprising and very unpredictable.
1255;(I was like 10 or 11) Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment give quite wonderful performances and this one will probably have you scared.
1256;I recommend it for anyone who wants to have some good scares.
1257;The circular nightmares, the disaffections, the emotive lacks, the emotional wounds are presented with admirable wholeness and superb edition work.
1258;through the eyes of a child you will be able to experience a very smart twist about Orpheus' myth.
1259;The redemption, the life seen from another perspective, the ancestral fear to death treated with absolute maturity and masterful.
1260;there is a beautiful and very, very hidden homage to a masterpiece film: The Red balloon in that clever sequence when our guest child is in the party and suddenly a red balloon elevates to roof and suddenly exploits: the claustrophobic anguish he will suffer brief moments later will make the whole circuit.
1261;The childhood simply has vanished.
1262;one of the last artistic masterpieces of the American Cinema!
1263;The first surprise that hit me upon viewing this film was Bruce Willis.
1264;On the contrary, I feel the guy has proven he has decent acting chops, despite his pedigree as an action hero.
1265;steady performance was surely a cornerstone of the film's success.
1266;If anything, I found the sentimentality a bit understated, given the story line.
1267;as for Haley Joel Osment, wow, the kid is so talented it's scary.
1268;I was all the more struck by the intensity of his portrayal after watching the movie a second time.
1269;A real key to the movie's success is in how Willis allows Osment to carry the ball throughout the film, and carry it he does.
1270;This movie is even better than Titanic ever was.
1271;Even though this movie didn't have many special effects, it is definitely a movie worth 5 stars.
1272;I thought the movie was okay until the very end.
1273;I love movies tht sum up the whole movie and this one sure did.
1274;I recommend this movie to any viewers.
1275;I found it much more thrilling than scary.
1276;Great move, really gets you thinking and is even touching.
1277;'The Sixth Sense' defies all genre categories
1278;wrenching all in the same film.
1279;Although the movie holds an atmosphere that is initially unsettling, it finishes off in such a satisfactory way that you'll want to watch it over and over again, just to keep experiencing the feeling it gives you.
1280;bruce Willis is refreshingly good as a child psychologist, and Haley Joel Osment, as a troubled boy with a frightening secret, is nothing less than extraordinary.
1281;Much of the emotional resonance of the film comes from his pained looks and whispered words.
1282;The movie had a great theme and premise, and although there were some inconsistent or incohesive elements in the plot, in the end the film works and succeeds in telling a tale of the supernatural.
1283;This scary and suspensful thriller is a great and well.
1284;the plot is that Jone is seeing ghosts and spirits, and they are talking to him.
1285;It sounds funny, not scary.
1286;The Sixth Sense is a terrific horror film, topped off be magnificant acting by little Haley Joel Osment.
1287;the opening scene is terrific, and you have to watch that carefully in order to understand the very clever twist at the end.
1288;the Sixth Sense chills you to the bone and keeps you in suspense all the way through.
1289;The scary scenes are truly chilling, and I must admit I had trouble getting to sleep after watching it.
1290;out of all the horror flims of 1999, I think this and the Blair Witch are the best.
1291;I see a vastly overrated movie called The Sixth Sense as far as its merits as a horror movie are concerned.
1292;The Sixth Sense is about a gifted child who has a sixth sense which allows him to actually see ghosts and dead people.
1293;A psychiatrist played by Bruce Willis is determined to help the boy, but actually finds out something quite dark about his own reality as opposed to that of the child.
1294;this part ends up overshadowing the entire movie and weakening it as a whole.
1295;however, it could certainly be argued that The Sixth Sense was not made for the purpose of being a horror movie and that may very well be true.
1296;I thought that The Sixth Sense was a mildly entertaining movie that illustrates a connection between the psyche of possibly blessed individuals with the supernatural and metaphysical reality we all so long to understand, but as a horror movie, The Sixth Sense basically sucks.
1297;incidentally, the idea of this sixth sense and psychic connection with the supernatural was done before and much better I might add in Stanley Kubrick's The Shining which IS very scary and a timeless classic.
1298;i highly recommend The Shining over The Sixth Sense if you are interested in this psychic subject matter within the framework of a real horror movie.
1299;This is a movie I will remember, watch again, and show to friends.
1300;He managed to make a difficult premise believable by showing you the fear in his belief.
1301;Bruce Willis turns in a respectable and believable performance and plays to the child well.
1302;this is clearly one of the best pieces of filmmaking to come out of the Hollywood Slums in a long time.
1303;It transcends many of the cliches that have gripped Tinseltown.
1304;Shyamalan's technical brilliance and power of vision are so refreshing.
1305;Willis and Osmet are brilliant together, as is Osmet's mother.
1306;The depth with which they portray their roles is evident in their eyes
1307;But, it's a credit to Shymalan's genius that he is able to deal with such deeply human themes in the context of a ghost story, without falling prey to the typical Hollywood cliches (like Ghost ).
1308;His work transcends film and becomes art of a type wholly distinct, much like Hitchcock and Kubrick before him.
1309;It will be fun to follow his career!This is a masterpiece.
1310;Settle in and enjoy the ride.
1311;As others have said here, the movie is very good.
1312;the movie was great and exciting
1313;Good, if somewhat overrated, film has great atmosphere, intriguing story, fine direction and great acting, especially from young Osment (in his debut film role).
1314;Worth seeing for sure, although repeat viewings offer diminishing returns.
1315;The sound fares a bit better, with the rear speakers used quite effectively at times.
1316;Have seen a few of his movies and thought he was good, but this has to be his FINEST performance as an actor.
1317;Haley Joel Osment is probably the most spectacular child actor that has ever ever graced a movie screen.
1318;incredibly gifted at such a young age!
1319;It will be quite interesting to see Haley in his future roles in the film industry as he progresses through his teens, into adulthood and beyond.
1320;i sincerely hope he makes a lifelong career out of acting.
1321;This is an INCREDIBLE film.you must see it!
1322;M. Night Shyamalan's debut as the masterful storyteller/director began with this most mysterious and heartfelt film, The Sixth Sense.
1323;The last time I saw The Sixth Sense was over six years ago and it was as though I enjoyed it even more now than I did the first time I saw it in theatres.
1324;Shyamalan's script is woven so beautifully and with such great care that the viewer will be yearning to find answers to the many questions this film forces one to develop.
1325;The Sixth Sense manages to keep the crowd attentive without a single special effect for almost two hours.
1326;an excellent and unforgettable performance by Toni Collette and one of the greatest ghost stories ever told.
1327;But there are definitely a few good jumps to be enjoyed.
1328;This movie can be seen over and over again and will one day be known as a classic work of film.
1329;This is by far the most superior M. Night Shyamalan film.
1330;But this one is best watched all at one sitting for the full effect.
1331;Involving, spooky, marvelous acting and suspence, and a terrific plot twist.
1332;with this a gory horror, Blair WItch a creative horror, The Green Mile a big hit with a big miracle man, the Academy had plenty hits to choose from.
1333;Enjoyable and frightening, The Sixth Sense will keep you up.
1334;This is an unexceptional film with interesting twist at the end.
1335;But this twist was explored earlier in a brilliant French movie called A Pure Formality with Gerard Depardieu and Roman Polanski.
1336;The French film is a must see.
1337;It's a haunting, beautiful cinematic masterpiece that'll give you the creeps.
1338;This film sprawls into a innovative story with moving and subtle moments.
1339;Its got a nervous atmosphere and a somber moodiness that holds you firm until the movie's astonishing end.
1340;This is one of those rare films that rebirths the classic suspense.
1341;thriller, a Twilight Zone lovechild.
1342;Maybe it was the hype, The greatest thriller of all time!
1343;Bruce Willis (not one of my favorite performers) was good in the film, nice and understated, and Haley Joel Osment is a talented little boy.
1344;but an entertaining one by a young filmmaker who may or may not mature into a great director.
1345;Was in good condition for a old movie my first time seeing it and I love it :) was really a movie I would watch over and over
1346;this Osment is totally amazing!
1347;i know he got a nomination but i dont remember if he won the Oscars for best supporting role.
1348;youll have to see this for yourself!
1349;its a scary movie to some extent, but all in all, its about values and how humans interact and treat each other, trust and faith.
1350;Had me guessing until the end, in true M. Night Shamalan tradition.
1351;Bruce and Haley did a great job bringing me into the story.
1352;I think this is the best movie EVER, i'm seen it 23 times 
1353;The picture was perfect, and it was great to watch this classic scary movie again.
1354;This movie blew my mind.
1355;This is a must see movie.
1356;Twists are great in movies.
1357;They are especially great for the Box Office.
1358;Primal Fear had a great twist ending.
1359;Notice they all did great at the Box Office.
1360;The lesson to the studios is to put more surprises into their scripts.
1361;Perhaps there was only one child in 10 million who could have acted in this movie but fortunately, Haley Joel Osment defied the odds and got the part.
1362;The performance of Bruce Willis was subtle and underwhelming.
1363;Well, Kevin Spacey won an Oscar for the same thing in Suspects.
1364;Kudos to Night on both counts.
1365;The Sixth Sense was the best film of the year.
1366;The storyline is amazing and it is remarkable.
1367;Not very scary but it's amazing how good the story is and it keeps you glued to your chair.
1368;Bruce Willis is phenomenal as Dr. Malcolm Crowe he nearly dominates the movie.
1369;This was one of the best movies and people liked it but Ignored it.
1370;In my opinion this film deserved Best Picture.
1371;It was a touching story and not a murderous tale like American Beauty.
1372;I hope everyone watches this!
1373;I think everybody likes this one!
1374;He delivers a phenomenal performance as one of Malcolm's former (and very troubled) child patients.
1375;Bruce Willis is an excellent psychiatrist.
1376;And yet, this knowledge enables the child and the doctor to realize that the welfare of the living, at least of those they love or who love them, is paramount and they have to communicate with them to save their balance, to save their life, to save the meaning of their life.
1377;This is done with tact and sympathy and the film is so slow and so calm that we even think at times we are in a dream world like Coleridge's Kubla Khan.
1378;dance, a tune that we know will come too soon to an end and then we will have to look for our go.
1379;This is a very interesting movie.
1380;The characters are beautifully played.
1381;The plot is certainly an interesting one.
1382;It's really more like a mystery than a thriller.
1383;The director's commentary is also great.
1384;I give the special features of this movie Five stars.
1385;This movie is probably one of the best movies I've ever seen.
1386;see film, and get it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1387;This movie, not only crosses the line between good and evil, but has also received 6 1999 Academy Award (Oscar)nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Supporting Actor, Haley Joel Osment.
1388;You might of thought this movie's ending was spectacular, but there was more that was hidden from you!
1389;A movie that signals with breakthrough performances and a ricochet of events, matches with The Sixth Sense.
1390;One of the best (and twisted) endings I have seen in a long time.
1391;The twist at the end of the film is heart warming and the acting (partically of the boy, Cole) was brilliant.
1392;It truly is a work of masterful storytelling and a cinematographer's paradise.
1393;Much is made of the twist at the end, which totally surprised me, but the entire film works as a whole, and teaches some important lessons.
1394;The bonus material added much to my own enjoyment.
1395;but once there, it was worth it!
1396;With these chilling words the climax of the Sixth Sense is revealed.
1397;What's left is a moderately interesting story with a twist that provides more plot holes than answers.
1398;There are some good performances and, thankfully, it is devoid of special effects which so often degrade a film's integrity.
1399;I must confess, up front, that I am not a Bruce Willis fan.
1400;Having said that, his performance in this film was sensitive and evocative.
1401;He also chose to work with a great script, a wonderful cast and was given competent direction.
1402;The master review sums up the film's appeal rather nicely, so I will not repeat what has already been said.
1403;It raises a number of interesting thought bytes with regard to the next realm , if one exists.
1404;I found the film to be wonderful viewing, with a relatively gentle touch being applied to all aspects of the story.
1405;won't spoil the surprise with this viewI, Jameson Thottam, waited an extra month to see this movie.
1406;I, Jameson Thottam, was interested all the way through, and loved the ending!The kid in this move was perfect for the part.
1407;He is compassionate, thorough and very psychiatrist.
1408;I like Kevin Bacon's role, as well as the movie, but I think Sixth Sense is a better movie, mainly because of the better writing.
1409;I, Jameson Thottam, recommend watching it, even 2 or 3 times.
1410;i, Jameson Thottam, kind of wish we had a few more examples of this kid's seeing dead people but the movie stays interesting without it.
1411;This is the best supernatural thriller I have seen.
1412;Amazing value for what you get!
1413;Over the years M. Night Shyamalan has directed some very good films.
1414;One of the most suspenseful films of all time to be made The Sixth Sense is well crafted in playing on the viewers emotions as it draws them into the story.
1415;the acting is excellent lead by Bruce Willis as Dr. Malcolm Crowe a child psychologist who is trying to help a 9 year old boy, Cole Sear played by Haley Joel Osment, with emotional issues.
1416;For one so young Haley Joel Osment gives an equally excellent performance that plays well off of Bruce Willis part.
1417;The story itself is well told.
1418;Easy to follow while keeping you in suspense what will happen next with a scene or two thrown in that will make you jump.
1419;The directing is masterful as well and no doubt that Shyamalan was on his game as he was making this movie.
1420;It is no wonder that many who have seen The Sixth Sense rate this both as one of their all time favorite movies and also Shyamalan's best work.
1421;I promise you will get caught up in the story and especially the ending.
1422;If you have seen it before, even with knowing the surprise ending, the film still stands up and is still captivating to watch.
1423;It is certainly for me one film I never tire of watching and is worthy of being in anyone's video library.
1424;This movie has found its way to my lifetime top ten list!
1425;Skipping the intro's is really easy!
1426;I loved everything about this movie.
1427;The panelists must've been out of their minds to not give him the award), and it was chilling and very suspenseful.
1428;many of the scenes were memorable and I liked the interviews at the end.
1429;This movie is the best movie I have seen in a while.
1430;Haley Joel Osment really knows what he is doing.
1431;And Bruce Willis was phenomenal too.
1432;This movie is great and kept my heart pounding the entire time.
1433;A must see for all movie fans!
1434;This is a great movie, one of the best.
1435;i thought movie was excellent.
1436;but, this one was really good spooky.
1437;i think the extra features were neat.
1438;This movie is the most outstanding movie I have seen in a long time!
1439;This is a psychologically stunning look at a frightened little boy and a therapist determined to help due to his troubled past.
1440;Just simply told in a way to draw you in and keep your attention till the last minute.
1441;I enjoyed all of it, especially the clues part.
1442;This is such a good movie.
1443;The ending is extremely shocking.
1444;If you haven't seen it though, it is a must see.
1445;The sixth sense was an awesome movie!
1446;I was really moved by this film.
1447;It takes you to the menu in less than a minute.
1448;his acting is superb, and doesn't lapse into wide eyed trembling.
1449;Bruce Willis takes an interesting role which was difficult to act convincingly and makes it believeable, and the whole film is brought together by a faintly eerie soundtrack which sums up the whole atmosphere.
1450;now go and see it!
1451;It's a Bruce Willis movie and he dies!
1452;He's the Jackal for god's sake!
1453;He prevented Armageddon and was the Last Man Standing!
1454;The writer/director, M. Night Shyamalan, has done a great job to make sure all the details add up.
1455;And far as acting goes, Bruce Willis, Toni Collette, and especially Haley Joel Osment, are amazing.
1456;The outstanding performances contribute to the disturbing atmosphere.
1457;The best child actor ever.
1458;overall Visuals grade: A. screenplay/Story: One of the best horror stories in years.
1459;Overall Screenplay/Story Grade: A+Acting: Some of the best acting you could ever seen on the big screen.
1460;The film editing is flawless.
1461;There is definitely something wrong with all the reviewers who raved about how great this movie is.
1462;For a great watch, get a REAL Bruce Willis movie.
1463;They are worth their weight in gold.
1464;I'm very happy with it :)
1465;My 12 year old son loves spooky.
1466;This movie is perfect for him because there isn't a lot of bad language, no excessive gore, and no strong violence.
1467;I felt the ending was an added touch.
1468;A must see twice movie!
1469;One of the few films I've bought without even seeing it before.
1470;I'd recommend this film to anyone, ANYONE, even if you don't like horror films.
1471;Very entertaining, and an excellent example of how this sort of movie should be made.
1472;M. Night Shyamalan has made a masterpiece!
1473;da burst onto the scene with the biggest suspense thriller of 1999 (well, right behind a relatively short list of films that includes Analyze This, Wild Wild West and Varsity Blues.)
1474;Haley Joel Osment delivers the most miraculous performance ever given by a toddler (he was just 18 months old when he was nominated for the Oscar!)
1475;Once you got to the end and looked back on it, the whole thing was intriguing, but it was still a long first hour.
1476;The only thing that sustained me through the first hour was the absolutely gripping performance from Haley Joel Osment (who was robbed of awards this award season!)
1477;Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment star is this outstanding thriller that will leave you in awe because of it's chills and an ending you never saw coming.
1478;The scene where Willis was telling Osment that he can not be Cole's counselor anymore and Osment's reaction is definitely oscar worthy in and of itself.
1479;The famous line, I see dead people , is probably going to be one of the most memorable lines and no one will be able to say it with the intensity that Haley Joel Osment was able to.
1480;The most intense and exciting movie of the year 1999!
1481;M. Night Shyamalan's direction is artful and delicate, utilizing light and Philadelphian architechture to preceed and punctuate scenes flawlessly.
1482;the performances are first rate all around.
1483;Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette are all spectacular in very challenging roles.
1484;shyamalan's script is simply amazing.
1485;There is character development, brilliant plot twists, frightening scenarios and intellegent dialogue throughout.
1486;The few big jumps in the movie are brilliantly placed and entirely unexpected.
1487;The script just works on so many levels that it demands repeat viewings.
1488;The screenplay is tremendous, and the acting is top notch!This film follows the reality of those with psychic abilities, and what they are reported to actually experience.
1489;the music builds suspence, and Bruce Willis' journey from skepticism to belief is a nice touch.
1490;It seems to meander without a real direction.
1491;I see dead people, most of the viewing audience is saying Well.
1492;Bruce Willis stars along side the outstanding child actor Haley.
1493;joel Osment in this truly scary thriller that will twist your mind around.
1494;My answer: it (Beauty) is a much better film.
1495;I guessed the so. called twist ending about 10 minutes into the movie, as I suspect others did, but it was still chilling nonetheless.
1496;I thought it moved ahead at a perfect pace.
1497;Osment showed that he is a young actor who will probably succeed as an adult actor as well.
1498;Bruce Willis continues to impress me as an actor of depth and breadth.
1499;This is definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen.
1500;Each actor and actress in this film has extraordinary talent.
1501;If you don't know, the story line is very, very simple.
1502;The movie is written as any great movie is
1503;The suspense leaves you on the edge of your seat the entire movie.
1504;Before the first time I saw it I knew the surprise ending .
1505;It kind of lifted your spirits, in this dark, semi.
1506;* I also must say that Haley Joel Osmet, for being so young, did an absolutely amazing job!
1507;One of my favorite movies of all time.
1508;I love having a movie inject pure, raw emotion into my bloodstream.
1509;It is also one of the few movies that can be seen again and again.
1510;In fact, the second time you watch it, it's even better because you get it.
1511;This is an excellent movie and I highly suggest.
1512;Finally a horror film that gives depth to it's characters!
1513;This is just a great old.
1514;Haley Joel Osment (Cole), who may have the most lines in the movie, truley gives the year's best supporting performance (sorry Michael Caine).
1515;The movie grabs you immediately in the first five minutes and gives one of the best endings in recent memory.
1516;This is the role Bruce Willis will be best remembered.
1517;She makes triangle pancakes for him, takes him for a joy ride in a supermarket parking lot, and arranges get.
1518;Extra footage is very engrossing.
1519;This is a must see, deffinatly!
1520;well i thought this movie was going to be great from what i had heard but what a let down.
1521;crazed teenagers would rather flock to see the latest Summer blockbuster than spend their time actually thinking during a movie. . . when truly brilliant films like My Dinner With Andre crash and burn. . . when movies like Independence Day , ill from a staggered plot, terrible acting, and downright unbelievable situations, can make millions and millions of dollars at the box.
1522;fanstastic plots, terrific acting, wonderous production considering the film's low budget relative to other film.
1523;hits of the day, and fine structuring plague this masterpiece.
1524;Director M Night Shyamalan is great in this mystery.
1525;I have enjoyed watching The Sixth Sense many times and therefore up.
1526;This movie is indeed fun to watch and the ending's twist was unexpected.
1527;Haley Joel Osment was a wonderful actor and delivered a convincing role as a confused, isolated 9 year old.
1528;Toni Collete was great in her role as the protective mother.
1529;The scene in which the boy reveals to his mother that his deceased grandmother visits him is especially beautiful and wonderfully acted.
1530;bruce will keep aal of the viewers on there toes
1531;His acting, and Osment's, are incredible.
1532;M. Night Shyamalan has written a masterpiece, with a great plot and a great twist.
1533;The rules and clues segment is great.
1534;This movie has a story line, and it is perfect for those people who like a surprise at the end.
1535;I found this to be an interesting movie.
1536;I was scared and sure jumped a lot.
1537;That's how you describe this movie.
1538;when I began watching it I was under the impression that this was a thriller.
1539;The movie does take a couple of twists and turns, most notably during the end.
1540;What I thought the movie was trying to say is that death is very important and how we treat people after they pass away directly affects what happens in the present.
1541;I saw this picture on the big screen three times because I was determined to take several people to see it.
1542;I'm a huge fan of James Newton Howard.
1543;perfect for the atmosphere of the film.
1544;Haley Joel Osment is the most astounding young actor I've ever seen.
1545;But after watching it I would rate it pretty good.
1546;That kid is a very good child actor.
1547;It's worth seeing if you like thriller dramas and Bruce Willis
1548;Not many films can really stand up to repeated viewings that will always surprise the viewer with new insites into the piece.
1549;each viewing reveals a new facet of the story, deepens the appreciation of the writing and, above all, amazes with the subtle and intricate performances of all the actors.
1550;Haley Joel Osment overwhelms you the first time you see the film and with each subsequent viewing your appreciation for his work grows more intense.
1551;This wasn't the work of the director, it comes from within this remarkable person.
1552;Little things that might have been missed previously will hit you and expand the pleasure.
1553;This is an excellent script, beautifully produced.
1554;if you've only seen this film once, you are depriving yourself of the continual pleasure of revisiting a masterpiece.
1555;They are quite nice compared to the regular snap.
1556;As it turns out, the movie is quite remarkable and the Director: M. Night Shyamalan does a superb job.
1557;There's nothing truly exciting in Sixth Sense but it's such a fine film that you will want to watch it again soon.
1558;In fact, I plan to watch Unbreakable right away and then re.
1559;is it really a thriller or high drama?
1560;I will say that the taste and skill of Director: M. Night Shyamalan probably will leave one groping for words, and that's what sets an artist apart from everyone else.
1561;He deserved a Best Actor nomination.
1562;Malcolm soon begins to believe Cole and realizes that Cole and a former patient, who had the same issues, may really have some special ability that no one else can perceive.
1563;This leads to some interesting confrontations and revelations.
1564;i really liked this movie and at some times it can really be creepy.
1565;M. Night Shyamalan wrote and directed this movie and it was one of three hit movies that he directed in a row.
1566;(The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable and Signs) The storyline was excellent and the acting was superb.
1567;It is a very good ghost story movie and well worth watching.
1568;Just don't watch it alone!I recommend it to you as a very good movie!
1569;I usually enjoy ghost movies but this one is unique with twists and a great surprise ending.
1570;A great movie will be remembered nottomorrow but in 30 years and this is the one.
1571;The film is so many emotions all at once, fear, terror, sadness and relief.
1572;The film is brilliantly shot by Tak Fujimoto(Philidelphia, Silence of the Lambs), and the acting is the best from everyone inloved.
1573;Bruce Willis has never been better, Toni Collette is brilliant as Cole's mother, and Haley Joel Osment is a future star.
1574;The film transfer is superb in low light, and crisp in well lit scenes, with no colour saturation whatsoever.
1575;Sound is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 English and French.
1576;, 2 movies for the price of one!
1577;A theatre trailer, 2 TV spots, extensive Cast and Crew bios and animated menus with sound.
1578;in short this was one of the most anticipated films of last year and has set new standards for film goers for years to come.
1579;Lets hope its another Sixth Sense .
1580;The sixth sense is one of Bruce Willis best movies.
1581;It has a chilling affect and you sympathize with Haley Joel Osment's character.
1582;The Sixth Sense is an excellent thriller, that provides you a much deeper topic than just scaring the pants off you!
1583;If you want a real thriller, that will stimulate your mind, as well as provide a chilling emotion.
1584;This kid is amazing, and the shocking end surprised me.
1585;Haley Joel Osment is an excellent actor, and you can't help feel his pain, fear, and anxiety in this film.
1586;Bruce Willis is a crowd.
1587;He'll always be one of my favorite actors, who tends to pick the best screenplays to work with.
1588;But I don't even see how he can top this one!
1589;The effectiveness of the Sixth Sense can in part be judged by the harsh reviews M. Night Shyamalan has received for his films that followed.
1590;The Sixth Sense is superbly written .
1591;so much so that figuring out the twist ahead of time in no way detracts from the effectiveness of the film.
1592;Shyamalan is obviously in love with the art of filmmaking .
1593;The casting in the film is also excellent.
1594;Bruce Willis nearly always turns in a solid performance, but he's excellent in this role.
1595;Toni Collette is great, and Haley Joel Osment deserves special mention.
1596;It was an amazing movie.
1597;I loved it in every way.
1598;It was probably the best one also.
1599;Out of all the movies this is in my top 5 category.
1600;What I liked most was the suspense.
1601;I think everyone in the world should see it.
1602;It also teaches you that no one is perfect.
1603;It seems that Cole has psychic powers and can channel the ghosts of those who were troubled.
1604;M. Night Shyamalan, who wrote and directed the film, has a small role as Dr. Hill.
1605;This film is a must see!
1606;The Sixth Sense is one of the greatest movies ever.
1607;M. Night Shyamalan is a really cool guy .
1608;time with Night, and you can really tell he is an exceptional person and director.
1609;ray transfer is excellent, both video and audio.
1610;It is a mystery/thriller along the lines of a modern Hitchcock tale with unexpected twists and turns including a major one at the very end.
1611;its box office success and lasting popularity speaks for itself.
1612;A great contrast for Bruce Willis compared to the typical action roles he's played.
1613;He does extremely well in this film, as does the young boy who plays the role of his patient.
1614;Overall an excellent production and a credit to the actors and director.
1615;This, I think, is one of those movies the entire family will enjoy.
1616;I sincerely hope this is not a sign of things to come.
1617;stars reviews everywhere saying this is simply a masterpiece, and that Haley Joel Osment.
1618;kid is being hailed as being the most brilliant actor walking around on the face of this earth.
1619;Well, maybe if you enjoy looking at a snotty face and wet eyes for 2 hours.
1620;Bruce Willis is a ghost himself, how incredibly shocking and original.
1621;OK, kid, here's your acting job: convey the pain of the outsider who bears the uncommunicable injustices of the dead, and still be a regular kid who loves your mom.
1622;The film is so well crafted visually it could work as a silent film.
1623;Allow me to prevail on you to see it.
1624;Director M. Night Shyamalan's breakthrough feature is a clever, unnerving horror picture with a nifty surprise ending.
1625;Willis is an effective anchor as the film's protagonist, but magnetic performances from young Osment and gifted actress Toni Colette (as Cole's mother) set this thriller apart, a movie best not seen alone.
1626;The second that Bruce Willis gets shot, I had guessed the ending.
1627;Anyway, the movie is great.
1628;It is very entertaining and holds your attention everystep of the way.
1629;I suggest that you see this, and maybe, if your dumber than me, you will be surprised at the end.
1630;up that I was really expecting something special.
1631;a lot has been said about Haley Osment, the actor that played the psychic child and what a phenomenal performance he gave.
1632;I'll admit that he did a good job,but the role was not extremely challenging.
1633;I will mention one other one has to do with the ending.
1634;The Willis character looks fine until the end of the movie.
1635;The ending has a unique twist but you can't rate a movie based on the last five minutes.
1636;there is no doubt that this is his best film of all the films he has done after The Sixth Sense.
1637;It is unarguable that he was struck by a certain genius at the time and this film shines from begining to end like no other.
1638;This film is a journey between two characters in search of an answer that the two eventually help each other in the end discover and solve.
1639;Both are great and are highly recommended!
1640;It starts out great
1641;It's an ok film, and Osmet and Willis are both good, I just wish they had more of a story to work with.
1642;I saw this film in the theaters back in 1998/1999 and at the time I thought it was a good film, but I had no intention to watch it again.
1643;I thought it was a great film, but it was just not for me.
1644;excellent film and superb acting by everyone involved.
1645;The film leaves us in suspense.
1646;This was one of the scariest movie that I have ever viewed.
1647;Many characters, as well, with the omission of Willis' character, develop much throughout the story.
1648;It has an exciting plot, and it is truly an original.
1649;It gives you a new insight that can never be achieved from just seeing the movie.
1650;If you do not own the movie, I highly recommend getting it for your future enjoyment.
1651;A classic movie (the best from this director.)
1652;The end is truly unexpected and original.
1653;M. Night Shyamalan is the most overrated director of all time.
1654;And if this is original, I just saw a xerox copy machine create the most innovative work to date (Jacob's Ladder did this 15 years ago people).
1655;One of the most over rated movies of all time.
1656;The plot was without flaw, the cinematography excellent, and the acting (especially by Haley Joel Osment) was outstanding.
1657;This film is a must see, twice!
1658;The first time to have the plot revealed to you in your utter ignorance.
1659;I look forward to more great work from Director/Writer Shyamalan.
1660;The first time I watched it, I had high expectations.
1661;And this time, I thoroughly enjoyed it.
1662;I enjoyed it for its depth, heart, and it's minimal .
1663;M. Night Shyamalan is a very creative and intelligent director, putting heart into his design.
1664;The use of the color red was a very unique touch.
1665;The relationships between Osment with both of the leads were great.
1666;This is a film that can be enjoyed over, and over again.
1667;The subtle nuances of this film are pleasing and enjoyable.
1668;The skill with which the creators obeyed the rules that they set for themselves in creating this film is highly impressive.
1669;This is one of the most intelligent surprise ending type movies I have ever seen.
1670;This film will leave you on the edge of your seat from the odd beginning to the shocking conclusion, which makes The Sixth Sense a must.
1671;there's a new blockbuster in town!
1672;After seeing American yawn Beauty, I thought I would take a look at The Sixth Sense.
1673;Sixth Sense made me wonder how this wonderful movie would end.
1674;Sixth Sense is definately worth the 5 star rating as well as the Academy Award from my heart.
1675;I had waited a long time to see this film and it was by far the best film of the year, (It wiped the floor with The Phantom Menace).
1676;The acting of Haley was brilliant and Bruce was amazing aswell.
1677;The twist at the end of the film makes the whole film seem so much better and ties the whole film together.
1678;The direction of the film was truly and I mean truly superbly amazing, the clues that were placed throughout the film and the established rules that were made was truly incredible and helped spiral the film into the all time Hall Of Fame for true and real masterpieces.
1679;Haley Joel Osment was cute in a Mikey.
1680;I always like Bruce Willis and he was just as great in this movie.
1681;Over all a great movie.
1682;contrary to what one reviewer mentioned earlier, I highly regard this film as an intelligent one.
1683;It gives a new meaning light to horror films.
1684;Great twist at the end.
1685;the movie has a truly surprise ending, making you want to sit through it a second time.
1686;The question is, of course, is the movie worth a second viewing?
1687;handed direction (it's only his second movie!)
1688;The scene composition, art direction, lighting, and measured pace (very pleasing, that) are almost wonders to behold in this day and age of racking noise, kinetic camerawork, and other excesses.
1689;top shenanigans and scares that mainly come from sudden bleats of violins and synthesizers at 50.
1690;decibel volume in your typical Dolby.
1691;Along that vein, Shyamalan wrings excellent performances from his cast.
1692;Joel Haley Osment has to be one of the discoveries of the decade, Toni Collette is, as always, great, and Bruce Willis has been restrained to the point where he actually stays in character.
1693;not quite on the level of great , *The Sixth Sense* is nevertheless very promising work from a director I'm sure we'll be seeing a lot more of.
1694;If you love SCAREY movies then this one is for you!
1695;Thanks Amazon for having the best!
1696;This should have won for best picture, and not Shakespeare in Love.
1697;And the ending is a jolt, completely unexpected.
1698;This is one movie everyone should see!
1699;The Sixth Sense is a great ghost story with an excellent script by writer/director M. Night Shyamalan.
1700;Haley Joel Osment, as the sad, lonely Cole, gives probably the strongest acting of any child actor .
1701;Toni Collette gives a strong performance as Cole's loving single mother.
1702;Bruce Willis fits his role perfectly with a detached, quiet style of acting that not only works well in the watching of the movie but in light of the final plot twist.
1703;The cinematography and the musical score (by James Newton Howard) provide the perfect atmosphere: sad, dark, and ghostly.
1704;In the midst of the deluge of crap from Hollywood, The Sixth Sense shines as a beautiful exception filmed by a promising director.
1705;This is one of the creepiest movies I've ever seen!
1706;I thought the actors were excellent.
1707;The special effects were the best I've ever seen!
1708;One of the best horror/suspense movies in a long time.
1709;It's also proof that a well written movie doesn't need blood and gore to make the viewer's hair stand up on the back of their necks.
1710;Each cast member is superb and just thinking about that little tent in his bedroom gives me chills!
1711;they should have this talent up front and on stage at all times.
1712;Bruce Willis is a great actor, really.
1713;He is SOOOO good in this film.
1714;And, of course, the writing was amazing.
1715;The Sixth Sense is a wonderful,classy ghost story film that lovers and nonlovers of the horror genre can all enjoy.
1716;It will be a great addition to any video collector's library.
1717;The Sixth Sense was my favorite movie of 1999, and is permanately one of my top 10 favorites.
1718;The bonus section is full of very interesting tidbits about the movie, by the people that made it.
1719;Some of the catagories in the bonus section include story boards, musical score, scenes edited out and the original ending.
1720;The actors do an amazing job of pulling the audience in, and holding you there on the edge of your seat until the very end (where there is an amazing twist to the story that will leave you dumbfounded!)
1721;there are actually several twists within this movie (with the biggest being the last), that will keep you on your toes and interested throughout.
1722;if you haven't yet seen this movie, I would highly recommend it!
1723;filled movies, then the Sixth Sense is a must see!
1724;The movie itself is very intriguing, but nothing can top Haley Joel Osmonds performance.
1725;He is one the screen for far longer than any other character and you truly beleive he is a troubled kid.
1726;What a twist it was.
1727;This movie is definetly one of the best of the year.
1728;The movie was in good condition when I bought it and it arrived on time.
1729;I really love this movie.
1730;It's well written, and it's got a really unexpected twist at the end.
1731;The director did a good job.
1732;But when I finished seeing it, I was surprised and moved.
1733;I want you to see this one and understand my feeling.
1734;The Sixth Sense is a good film, with some excellent performances from Osment, Willis and Collette and I must admit that certain parts did give me the creeps.
1735;So, a good film, but overhyped in my opinion.
1736;I especially liked the twist at the end of this movie.
1737;This is definitely an excellent movie to see.
1738;One more star for a great story and the final one for fantastic acting!
1739;Came quickly and in good shape, as promised!
1740;This is the perfect mix of suspenseful and intriguing, with only a moment or two that might make you jump just because you weren't expecting anything.
1741;I absolutely loved this movie.
1742;It's one of those movies that even though you know the ending you MUST go back and watch it again and again and .
1743;A number of people recommended this film to me, in addition to my own desire to see it.
1744;It's terrific
1745;I highly recommend this picture.
1746;The theater does something to a movies scare factor, and this is a perfect example of that.
1747;It is still a good movie with good acting by all, still pretty disturbing, still good story, and still sad in parts.
1748;the ending has to be one of the biggest shockers that i have ever seen in a movie!
1749;Undoubtedly one of the high points in 90's cinema, Night Shyamaln's third offering scores on so many fronts that in the final analysis it could well be vaunted as a future classic.
1750;No, this is creative filmmaking delivered with confidence and flair.
1751;patient shoots Crowe before turning the gun on himself.
1752;Cinematographer Tak Fujimoto makes great use of shadow and darkness throughout and scenes such as where the boy is locked in a dark cupboard by errant friends truly frighten, conjuring up and reminding us all of the fears of childhood.
1753;Whilst the main structure of the story isn't particularly outstanding, its given weight by sterling performances all round with top honours going to Haley Joel Osment who delivers an outstanding performance as the outcast, over.
1754;And the surprise (as opposed to shock) ending is the icing on the cake and certainly wasn't obvious to me.
1755;i read the screenplay and, after enjoying it, made it a point to see the film again.
1756;And I'm glad I did
1757;this story, about a terrified young boy who sees ghosts, and gets help from a child psychologist, works very well.
1758;It moves slowly, but that just happens to bring you into the story.
1759;as melodramatic as it sounds, this movie makes you appreciate things in your life that you would normally take for granted: a good family, love, peace, and simple communication.
1760;And it does an amazingly heartfelt job of emphasizing on these things, and how important they are to us.
1761;this is an excellent movie and a very unique one, at that.
1762;If you appreciate good storytelling, with morals that are not preachy or patronizing, then this is one film that you really must own.
1763;A superb performance by young Haley Joel Osment.
1764;I saw this movie twice in the theatre, and I could still watch it again, and again.
1765;I must admit that I was impressed by this movie.
1766;Everyone talks about how they loved the plot twist, and they are good, but what I loved the most is that the story is taken seriously.
1767;Actually I think that those slasher movies are a lot easier to make than a convincing, mature ghost story, and they make a lot of money.
1768;I can only hope that the success of this film convinces Hollywood that they can trust the audience with mature matieral.
1769;haley Joel Osment is fantastic as the troubled child, Bruce Willis does an outstanding job as the compassionate and guilt.
1770;ridden doctor, and Toni Collete is excellent as Haley's on .
1771;See if you recognize her from Muriel's Wedding or Emma.
1772;I was going to avoid it entirely, but friends persuaded me to give it a try, and I'm glad they did.
1773;this is a terrific picture that kept me thinking about it for days after I saw it.
1774;rated Bruce Willis as a psychiatrist who works with traumatized young children.
1775;averse wife enjoyed the film.
1776;The movie is more than your average thriller, and will keep you guessing.
1777;Yeah, it has a cool ending and it's a good movie to watch, but it didn't deserve NEARLY the recognition that it recieved.
1778;If you want a dramatic movie with a twist, this is it.
1779;This is one of those movies that keeps you attached to your seat throughout.
1780;This thriller will leave you with your mouth wide open.
1781;This movie definitely surpassed my expectations.
1782;I saw a matinee, just wanted it to be mildly entertaining.
1783;that one moment, to me, was 10 times scarier than all of the Blair Witch Project put together.
1784;This was one of the scariest movies I've ever seen, and I've seen thousands.
1785;It would definitely go on my top 5 scariest list, along with Carrie and The Exorcist.
1786;My husband didn't see it coming, and he's pretty clever about guessing them too.
1787;During the second to last scene in the car, I surprised myself by starting to cry.
1788;reading the screenplay, I realized even more how great it was, and how heartbreaking.
1789;There are so many elements that just make your heart wrench.
1790;I read the last scenes of the screenplay at home, alone, and had a really good cry, which hasn't happened since I read the screenplay to The Green Mile.
1791;In this movie, the filmmakers did it just right.
1792;They are powerful and beautiful scenes.
1793;Even though I had allready seen the movie, it was well worth seeing again.
1794;And it was interesting to learn so much about the making.
1795;I especially liked the explanations of deleted scenes.
1796;Haley Joel Osment, Bruce Willis give totally convincing performances of the emotions aroused when 1) you can see what happened to and who no one else can because that 'person' has died and 2) what it may feel like to think you are alive and yet come to realize the reason your loved ones are acting strangely around you is because they are grieving your death.
1797;It's got a lot of psychological twists in there, especially the ending.
1798;as Cole Sear, Haley Joel Osment steals the movie right from Bruce Willis.
1799;The emotional range he displays is wonderful.
1800;M. Night Shyamalan's spooky supernatural thriller is one of most chilling and unpredictable films i've seen for a long time.
1801;Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment both give great performances, especially Osment, who has the gift of seeing dead people.
1802;director Shyamalan's taut direction makes this one an amazing and thrilling film with that now.
1803;Add a creepy musical score, some inventive camerawork and a sharp script and you have one of the best psychological thrillers of all time.
1804;I thought this movie was fantastic!
1805;It was also the best child acting I have seen in a long time.
1806;This is by far one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.
1807;the story was great, the acting was superb, the effect were awsome, and the best part is the end.
1808;To comment again on my title of this review, this film was extremely emotional films I've seen in a while.
1809;It was also a scary film.
1810;Now, you usually those two types of films don't cross with eachother, at least, not since The Exorcist, but M. Night Shyamalan has created a masterpiece with this film.
1811;Bruce Willis has finally struck gold with his portrayal of Dr. Malcolm Crowe.
1812;Haley Joel Osment is one of the best child actors around.
1813;These two films are nothing alike and they are both equally good in their own right.
1814;The Sixth Sense is just a little better beacause of an extremely bright script and the famed twist ending.
1815;this is simply one of the most brilliant stories I've ever had the pleasure of watching, and it still boggles my mind that such a masterpiece came to be!
1816;I became an instant fan of the guy who directed this movie, and one must watch the film to truly see why.
1817;About twenty minutes after I finished watching the movie(including the great bonus material after the end), I rewound it and played it a second time.
1818;two great films wrapped in one!!!!
1819;One of the finest films I've seen in years, truly a must see.
1820;as time passes, the psychologist realizes the boy is telling the truth, and helps him learn to deal with his gift.
1821;of course, something happens . . . this was a good movie.
1822;Since this is one of my most favorite movies, I just wanted to gush about it.
1823;It is so masterfully done with many layers, metaphysical, psychological, emotional, fabulous character and plot developments, that it lends itself quite well to viewing over and over again.
1824;Night Shyamalan, much like Quentin Tarantino did in Pulp Fiction has evoked a stellar performance from Bruce Willis, who is quite the underrated actor.
1825;genius actor as honest and believable as Haley Joel Osment (can you believe he was actually on the Jeff Foxworthy show at one point?!)
1826;and you've got an amazing acting ping.
1827;Toni Collette also delivers a wrenching portrayal of a mother at her wits end with her disturbed child.
1828;full of imagery and symbols, seemingly telling you one thing when in fact you've jumped to an erroneously conclusion, hence the much touted surprise twist at the end.
1829;What a gem of a movie.
1830;The directing was good and the script was really well thought.
1831;The ending had a cool twist.
1832;Haley Joel Osment is excellent and makes the movie worth watching.
1833;seeking mindHonestly, this is a phenomenal creation, and young Osment acted flawlessly.
1834;The theme of fear of uncertainty is highly developed in this film and is of paramount importance to the psychological aspect of this movie.
1835;I liked the fact that although the movie didn't really have any great special effect, it was able to great a great creepy atmosphere.
1836;, but I liked just being able to settle into the creepy mood of the movie.
1837;The music fits the movie very well and does wonders to create the atmosphere.
1838;Bruce Willis is very toned down in this movie, but still does a very good job.
1839;There are some cool special features, I personally like the deleted scenes and I don't see why some of them were cut.
1840;Anyways, if you liked the movie pick it up for sure!
1841;I vividly remember the first time I saw this movie at the theatre.
1842;I also remember the brilliance of the suspense and it just blew me away.
1843;winning and recognized child psychologist.
1844;With his first mission being successful, Cole realizes that this is his purpose in life.
1845;Overall, this is a fantastic movie.
1846;blowing that you'll want to watch the movie again.
1847;M. Night Shyamalan did a superb job directing this movie.
1848;He has mastered the art of getting our full attention into the story.
1849;In addition, Haley Joel Osment is such a talented young actor.
1850;once you've checked this out, you gotta watch The Others.
1851;The Sixth Sense is such a great movie, so I was very upset when the picture kept blanking out during the movie!
1852;I got this movie today and boy do I have a few things to say!
1853;It was an ingenious plot twist that I'll never tire of.
1854;Those with open minds can enjoy this film.
1855;The key here is freeing yourself of preconceived notions about a very real topic.
1856;This film blew me away, which is the highest compliment I can give of an entertainment business that specializes in upchucking garbage to the masses.
1857;One of the all time best psychological thrillers I've ever seen!Its ending will make you think long and hard about death and the afterlife.
1858;The Sixth Sense is a movie that will grab you and pull you in, keeping you on the edge of your seat until the surprise ending that will leave you stunned and speechless.
1859;Not since the movie Seven has a surprise ending completely shocked and moved me.
1860;I had to see this movie twice
1861;Bruce Willis, who does have a tendency to pick typecast roles, gives an excellent performance as a child psychiatrist fighting his own demons, and Haley Joel Osment is one of the best child actors I have ever seen.
1862;He played perfectly a kid who was extremely frightened by what he saw, but who tried to remain strong for the sake of his mother.
1863;This movie is thrilling and frightening, and at the same time very moving, especially with the relationship between Osment and his mother.
1864;This is definitely a movie to own.
1865;but I can see that some people might like it.
1866;The huge box office takings can only really be because of the surprise ending.
1867;I really enjoyed this film.
1868;A crowning achievement in the horror genre.
1869;It is a fantasticly scary film!
1870;play, wonderful special effects, and top.
1871;notch acting make this one a winner!
1872;This is a great movie, to see.
1873;One of the best psychological dramas.
1874;And the ending(when I first saw it) was so surprising, I was shocked.
1875;I was pleased when it went for best pictures in the Academy Awards, but when the result came out, well.
1876;The cuts, and other info were very entertaining.
1877;I'm giving this film three stars because it held my interest from start to finish and because the ending had a very good twist.
1878;Like The Usual Suspects (which is a five star movie, as good as the classics, in line for best of its genre of all time), we get a wonderful twist at the end which completely changes the entire movie's meaning, back to the beginning.
1879;I have to hand it to Bruce Willis .
1880;WoooooooooaaaaahhhAfter watching this movie for a second time in the cinema and viewing a .
1881;i believe Haley Joel Osment should have received the Oscar for his performance.
1882;I was surprised when I first heard the rave reviews and witnessed how much money this film was making.
1883;For this reason, and because it seems to me to be a sensitive, thoughtful look at the possible existense of ghosts , I highly recommend this movie.
1884;Haley has a way of claiming the screen, and is coupled well with a quickly.
1885;maturing Bruce Willis, who was darkly.
1886;real ability to see dead people.
1887;congratulations, Bruce and Haley, on this awesome landmark film!
1888;Haley Joel Osment is an excellent young actor, and Willis is in top form in this flick.
1889;He handled an intelligent, sensitive role better than I ever thought possible, and Haley, well.
1890;Because these actors were well.
1891;James Newton Howard is also an excellent composer and the score of Sense is haunting and lilting without being jolting.
1892;if you haven't seen it yet, please do.
1893;But hey, he knows all they want is help!
1894;Nothing very creative or special there.
1895;There's a blooper when the wife's boss leaves her apartment and is heard saying See you two later .
1896;I now see why this movie was the talk of the year!
1897;With the ending, we both just looked at each other!
1898;Mr. Shaylaman's unraveling of one of a future masterpiece will surely be copied.
1899;And thank you Mr. Willis for giving the movie to Haley Joel Osment, even though he did not win an oscar, this kid will surely be one to watch in the future.
1900;This is a well written awesome cast chilling movie, what more could you ask for?My husb and I hadn't seen it in years and he asked me the other day if we had it and lo and behold we didn't.
1901;so I bought it here on Amazon, used, and it was minty!Still gave me chills and made me a lil weepy (when mother and son are in the car and he's telling her that he has spoken to her mother, his grandmother, it gets me every time!!)
1902;there were definitely some jump scenes in there, but by and large the movie is beautifully crafted with psychological, not gory, intrigue.
1903;Haley Joel Osment proves that a child actor can be superb.
1904;As a fan of Philip K. Dick stories, I adored the twists and turns, the unexpected and the layers.
1905;Bruce Willis shines as a man with issues.
1906;It's also a movie that gets better with each re.
1907;watching, where you can appreciate the use of light, the use of color, and the fine acting.
1908;But she's pretty much the only woman in the entire movie.
1909;highly recommended, even if you don't normally watch thrillers.
1910;This is one that well deserves its AFI spot.
1911;Without a doubt, one of the most technically perfect scripts I've seen in years.
1912;Every aspect is brilliantly conceived and beautifully developed.
1913;One Caveat: Pay attention as you watch this terrific film unfold or you'll regret it!
1914;But is thriller the best way to describe this story?
1915;Granted, The Sixth Sense has many scenes that employ scary graphics.
1916;I found it intriguing, but was surprised that it did not frighten me more.
1917;riding idea within this movie of Malcolm not knowing he is a ghost carried a solid emotional punch.
1918;I found myself afraid that Malcolm's wife, Anna, was cheating on him and no longer loved him.
1919;The director, M. Night Shymalyan, did an excellent job of masking what the truth was and because of this, when it all became clear at the end, it was even more tragic.
1920;Throughout the movie Malcolm was under the impression that his wife was leaving him, but in fact he was the one to have left her!
1921;It is a powerful scene when Malcolm comes to understand that the loneliness that he feels is about a hundred times worse for Anna because she cannot see, hear, or smell his presence any more.
1922;unlike most thrillers, this movie carries sweet over.
1923;The child, Cole, who has the sixth sense, is successful at maintaining his innocence no matter how horrific the ghost scenes are.
1924;She loves him just the same as she always has.
1925;It contains messages of love and the need to understand others within the context of their lives.
1926;If you have not heard of the ending to this movie, be prepared for a surprise!
1927;This movie twists back and forth, making pretty good sense along the way.
1928;This did not seem feasible and did not match the tone of the rest of the movie which was intelligent and fit together quite nicely.
1929;The acting is really good, especially Toni Collete.
1930;I could watch her again and again, she is a great actress.
1931;Forgot the name, saw it at a film fest and really liked it, very bizzare.
1932;The movie is a must see!
1933;Sent to a psychologist and various medical doctors, one young boy's experience is a ominous feeling of a rare ability denied, reviled, and ultimatley accepted.
1934;Besides the scary ghost things and story, it have some touching story behind, story between son, mother and their grandma
1935;I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and I love watching the reactions of people who haven't seen it.
1936;haley Joel Osmond was really good.
1937;Bruce Willis was good also, as well as the actress who played the mom.
1938;M. Night Shyamalan's scary, surprising, The Sixth Sense, is perfection for a thriller ride.
1939;He was planning on spending a romantic evening with his wife, in celebration of his recent civic honor as a upstanding Child Psychologist.
1940;dr. Crowe then begins to talk with Cole, for both to gain peace in their lives.
1941;a riveting scene where Cole finally tells Dr. Crowe about his frightening supernatural secret is exquisitely engrossing.
1942;the stunning ending leaves your mouth gaping with surprise.
1943;the Oscar nominations for the amazing Osment and his deeply loving mother, Collette are well deserved.
1944;Bruce Willis carries the intriguing movie to a fantastic climax.
1945;I was impressed with this director's previous feature Praying with Anger .
1946;He has studied the masters well, and has a humanity sorely needed in cinema.
1947;SENSE is compelling and spooky, but it's Osment that makes the film fly.
1948;The film leaves one with a haunting poignancy, thanks to M. Night's restrained direction, the ensemble's acting, and Newton Howard's score.
1949;The Sixth Sense is probably the best film of 1999.
1950;It's a movie that tells the story of Cole Sear (beautifully played by Haley Joel Osment), a child with an unusual .
1951;The relationship between these two gives one of the strong points of this film.
1952;is the twist at the end of the movie.
1953;All you have to do is sit back and enjoy the film, even though you may be in for some chills.
1954;Personally I like the interview to composer James Newton Howard regarding how he created the music to fit in the scary environment of the movie.
1955;I see a lot of people saying that this was the greatest film of 1999, but let's be honest.
1956;With equally amazing films, like American Beauty, The Cider House Rules, The Green Mile, I'd say The Sixth Sense is one of MANY great films of 1999.
1957;This is a great movie, very well done.you get drawn into these characters' lives.
1958;I have watched it several times and discover something new each time.
1959;Bruce Willis gave a brilliant performance as the psychiatrist.
1960;If you enjoyed Patrick Swayze in Ghost, you will also love this movie.
1961;It deals with the supernatural in a profound and touching manner.
1962;I liked this movie a lot, an excellent phsychological thriller.
1963;The ending is a complete surprise.
1964;Now, if I may have my opinion heard, I thought this movie was great.
1965;It was thrilling, had great acting, good music, and a wonderful ending.
1966;Since I am an aspiring child psychologist, I found it interesting to see how Willis worked with Osment on screen.
1967;I really enjoy a good movie and some people just have no appreciation for a good thing.
1968;Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment made a tremendous team on the screen.
1969;This one keeps you guessing until the very end.
1970;This was a very carefully crafted masterpiece.
1971;I'm proud to have this one in my collection at full price.
1972;It is MNS's best film with plenty of great twists and great acting.
1973;This movie is a perfect rendition of this
1974;who truly knows in the end?This movie is rich in its depth and breadth of character and humanity.
1975;The subtle development of suspense makes this a gripping and emotional ride.
1976;This is one of the best movies out there.
1977;On the surface, it is an effective ghost story in the truest sense, drawing on a long tradition of tales and with an ending that is both rewardingly unique and also of a kind with some of classic tales of haunting.
1978;In comparison, The Sixth Sense is as well.
1979;realized a film as I have ever seen.)
1980;In my view, the power of this film is in its less obvious message: it is a haunting, evocative, and cautionary tale about middle age.
1981;You'll know them by the uncharacteristically powerful emotions they evoke.
1982;the depth of which could only be achieved by this striking psychological tale so nicely concealed in a story of the supernatural.
1983;This is a very, very special film.
1984;Yes, this film was well.
1985;acted, eerily filmed, creepily scored, and very well special.
1986;effected, but I love a movie that pulls the rug out from under you.
1987;You've experience the growing intrigue and horror as the truth of this boy's life unfolds, and feel the satisfaction of having it finally believed and resolved, and then: SLAM, BANG, WOW.
1988;The wind is knocked out of you and you have to go back and watch it all over again to see how beautifully it all hangs together.
1989;A very, very worthwhile film on so many levels.
1990;This is a good, creepy movie.
1991;It will suprise you at the end with great suspense!
1992;it touched me very deeply, basically because I believe that dead people surround us, both good and bad, until the day of the Final Judgement.
1993;This is the reason why this movie is brilliant: it appeals to the average people's fears.
1994;I found this movie very enjoyable.
1995;The actors all did a great job.
1996;And the story was very good.
1997;It is best to not know the ending when going to watch this film (So I will not spoil it).
1998;Watch it and ask no one about it, you will be pleased.
1999;The fact is, the acting is great, the ending was great, but the movie was BORING.
2000;All throughout the movie you are left sat on the edge of your seat.
2001;And although he has made worthy follow.
2002;It's been a year since he had to confront that awful truth, and in that time, his confidence and his marraige have undergone a slow and steady crumble that has finally reached the breaking point.
2003;this is a terrific thriller.
2004;Great acting and subtle direction (note the selective usage of the color red), along with an absolutely killer storyline, make THE SIXTH SENSE probably the best movie of 1996.
2005;Eleven years later, it still holds up.
2006;In The Sixth Sense, the color red represents sanctuary and a sense of feeling safe, as well as a sign of fear because the use of red with Cole signifies his wanting to be safe from the ghosts, and because the red also shows the first signs of ghosts and fear.
2007;Furthermore, the use of red throughout the movie gives certain hints to the fact that something happened.
2008;He often goes into the church, which has bright red doors.
2009;In the church, he plays by himself and stays there as often as he can.
2010;He also steals a small statue of Jesus, who is wearing a red robe.
2011;even though red symbolizes the feeling of being safe, it also shows fear and the first signs of ghosts.
2012;He knows this because he sees ghosts hanging from the ceiling.
2013;Cole has done this, and it shows the writings that he did, which are in red ink.
2014;He finds pills in the bathroom that are for depression.
2015;When the mother is first shown, she is wearing a bright red dress at a funeral.
2016;the Sixth Sense is a great movie that has plenty of twists and turns that keeps the audience hooked from the opening scene.
2017;If you're a person who wants to be able to sit there and think about everything you just saw when the movie is over, then The Sixth Sense is the right movie for you.
2018;It has been a while since a film gathered so many good points.
2019;This film almost forces you to see it again just to pay a closer attention to each scene.
2020;Bruce Willis is very convincing in a role of a doctor who is helping a young boy who says he can see and talk to ghosts.
2021;Bruce Willis does a credible job.
2022;The movie is a pretty good story and was directed quite well.
2023;It has a fair number of features and a nice set of mood fitting interactive menus.
2024;This is by far the best movie I have ever seen.
2025;It kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire film.
2026;Well worth the price of admission at the theatre.
2027;Especially one special feature: Rules and Clues.
2028;The Sixth Sense is a triumph of storytelling, with a good old.
2029;fashioned twist that brings goosebumps on the first viewing.
2030;There are some genuine made you jump!
2031;Willis, never my favorite actor, is solid, and avoids the smarminess that sometimes defeats his natural charm, and of course Osment is at times heartbreakingly earnest in his portrayal of the boy.
2032;This still makes for a good experience, and it is worth watching it a second time.
2033;The movie is a cinematic treat with great scenery and great acting (especially by Osmet), but part of its charm is the fact that you are as nervous as the characters .
2034;This movie makes you think and makes you believe in seeing dead people .
2035;This is a terrific movie and it has a unique story line.
2036;The two main actors do a fantastic job and is already a classic.
2037;Bruce Willis turns in his best performance yet as a child psychologist helping a young boy (Forrest Gump's son .
2038;this intelligent suspense thriller becomes one of the greats by tapping into your psyche and plucking nerves with startling effectiveness .
2039;The ghost sightings are occasional and relatively subtle overall, leaving you on the edge until finally seeing them in full force sets off an adrenaline rush hard enough to knock you out of your seat.
2040;Intelligent writing and sharp cinematography create an eerie atmosphere that carries all the way through to a surprise twist at the end.
2041;Much darker, not quite as good, still worthwhile.
2042;Much fuss is made about M. Night's killer twist at the end of this movie.
2043;but no one should be mislead into believing The Sixth Sense relies on that final revelation.
2044;The movie succeeds just fine the way the story develops before that final scene.
2045;the magic of the movie is that it defies classical description.
2046;There are moments in the film that will inspire genuine unease in even the most hardened horror fanatic.
2047;There are moments that bring you right out of your seat.
2048;The appearance of each new dead man, woman or child is a natural development as the story unfolds.
2049;There is fright on the screen because the little boy's world is filled with a day.
2050;haley Joel Osment shows genius well beyond his years in this performance.
2051;You love the kid from the start because he is small, and vulnerable and seeking only the most basic sense of safety and comfort.
2052;the concept of this movie is so unique, it seems unfair to call it a variation of the classic ghost.
2053;The boy sees dead people, it's true.
2054;But the heart of the story is in the discovery of why that is so.
2055;doubts before he can open himself up completely to the boy.
2056;this is a movie that is firmly placed in the top three of my all.
2057;from start to finish, The Sixth Sense is an amazing movie on almost every level.
2058;Filming, mood and acting are all there in near perfection.
2059;The story itself transcends the rest of it.
2060;was a gift for a friend.
2061;I have to tell you that I loved this movie.
2062;When I first saw it, I was told what the twist ending was, and was still surprised by the ending when I saw it myself.
2063;The story was very well.
2064;special features, including (the writer/director) Night's first attempt at a horror film, which is priceless!
2065;Also a good feature: Rules and Clues.
2066;Much better than Stir of Echoes, which was also fantastic!
2067;A great unexpected ending, too, luckily the director cut his most favourite shot out (see bonus material), it would have ruined it, as it was too much already.
2068;I liked, Sixth Sense I SEE DEAD PEOPLE well, this is kind'a scary then it, gets good then alittle scary I liked this you'll like, it maybe.
2069;The relationship between Dr. Malcolm Crowe and Cole was outstanding and both won something.
2070;Should have definitely won an award for best acting and best movie of 1999!
2071;Definitely 5 stars, this is one of the best scary movies I've watched.
2072;Haley Joel is just incredible, I am more impressed by his performance every time I see it.
2073;But boy, he sure makes this movie great.
2074;Bruce Willis as well does a great job, certainly his best role to date.
2075;All the cast was wonderful, and the story extremely well written, perfectly paced and with a wonderful surprise ending.
2076;I particularly like this movie as it didn't go out of its way to use blood and gore to scare you, it did it with a buildup of suspense and mainly through the terror and fear of the characters themselves.
2077;Always fun getting to watch scenes that ended up on the cutting room floor, and Night's first movies were a riot.
2078;The thing I like about this film, is that it focuses more on the horror, and delivers some great performances.
2079;When he meets a new child, Cole, he feels a special connection with him because he reminds him a lot of the patient that killed himself.
2080;This movie was very entertaining and chilling.
2081;One particular child strikes him as particularly peculiar, as Crowe soon discovers of the eight year old's amazing and chilling sixth sense.
2082;The plot is thick and intense throughout the entire film.
2083;Every single actor plays an amazing role in this movie.
2084;Willis is said to be at his best.
2085;I suppose the deleted scenes are the best part.
2086;The Sixth Sense is not my favorite ghost story on film, but it ranks third behind Roman Polanski's 1968 masterpiece, Rosemary's Baby, and a 1980 Canadian treat with George C. Scott called The Changeling.
2087;depth study of the Academy Awards, and my initial conclusion is that what wins and what's nominated is based primarily on the voters' collective mood in any given year.
2088;take the best acting categories.
2089;He certainly is one of the public's favorites.
2090;The Blockbuster Entertainment Awards manumitted him in 1998, 1999 and 2000.
2091;He also took home the prize at the 2000 People's Choice Award.
2092;This ranks him above even Tom Hanks in the opinion of the people who pay to see movies.
2093;I am writing this because I think he is the most underrated actor of our times.
2094;He is understated and has a dignity that is rare.
2095;In a confrontation with a former patient, Crowe is shot.
2096;If you don't know the story by now, you'll ruin much of the fun and suspense if you ask others to tell you more.
2097;You've been warned!Toni Colette gives her best performance since Muriel's Wedding, a nifty Australian comedy that I highly recommend.
2098;Still, it is eleven.year old Osment who is so amazing.
2099;He's so good, he's a bit spooky himself.
2100;He is, as always, dignified, and as a result of the way he interprets Malcolm Crowe, he gives us his finest performance to date.
2101;there is something quite telling about the public's reaction to The Sixth Sense.
2102;Instead, he concentrates on the story.
2103;He lets his actors act.
2104;He assumes the audience is, on the whole, intelligent.
2105;That audience made it one of the highest grossing movies of all time.
2106;The Sixth Sense is one movie that draws you into its web, and won't let you out until you've devoted a lot of mental time and energy to it.
2107;I'm not, however, sure all the work is richly rewarded.
2108;The movie feels like it truly needed a much stronger actor and a more compelling presence at its core, and it would really have given the movie much more emotional weight.
2109;Regardless, The Sixth Sense is still entertaining, and worth sitting through once or twice, but probably not much more.
2110;The movie will make you jump as the plot unveils.
2111;It has a twist at the end that surprised many although the restaurant scene didn't mesh with the twist and might have given it away.
2112;The discovery of Cole's incredible sixth sense leads both Dr. Crowe and Cole himself to mysterious and unforseeable consequences.
2113;He gives the performance of a lifetime, not just for himself but for anybody who could have taken the role.
2114;Beautifully directed, well crafted, well acted and spine chilling this is a horror film that does more than just scare you it makes you think.
2115;The extras give you greater insight into the film, making you want to watch it again and again.
2116;I like this movie a lot!
2117;I thought The Others was creepy, this is far from that!
2118;I love how he acts in this.
2119;If you like The Others, you will really like The Sixth Sense.
2120;disc that has deleted scences on them, and a whole lot of other good stuff from the directors.
2121;It will give you chill's and suprise you with it's intelligence.
2122;It is well written and acted even better.
2123;Its the directors first and ONLY great film so far.
2124;I'd be more than happy to answer any and all of them.
2125;I am rarely fooled by such film plots but this one got me and a good film became a great film.
2126;Even without the ending this was still a touching story between the two main characters and I enjoyed it completely.
2127;The tone, score, screen play, and acting are all supurb.
2128;This is a fascinating, intriguing and powerful film!I've seen it first when it was released to theaters and I was compelled to see it again a week after!
2129;as soon as it was released to VHS I add it to my collection!With The Sixth Sense (1999), arguably, director M. Night Shyamalan has achieved his best movie up to the present moment.
2130;In the following years he has delivered some good movies as Unbreakable (2000) and The Village (2004), but they are one step below the present one.
2131;little by little he is able to win his confidence and learn that the boy sees dead people almost everywhere.
2132;the whole plot is very ingenious and delivers one twist after other until the end .
2133;then you'll be ready to see the whole story again, and again.
2134;it is addictive, you'll always find new interesting details each time you see it again.
2135;play acting is one of the high points of the film.
2136;Two of them are absolutely outstanding: Haley Joel Osment performing as Cole shows an extraordinary maturity to convey to the audience all the turmoil of the kid's soul.
2137;the other one is given by Bruce Willis, endearing, compassionate and compromised with an unusual character for his career.
2138;toni Collete as Cole's mother and Olivia Williams as Malcolm's wife are also very good.
2139;even if the film failed to convert its six nominations into an award, undoubtedly it is a product of superior category.
2140;He sees them all the time.
2141;This movie is one of the best movies I saw lately, and is sure to amaze all of you with it's surprizing ending!Warmly recommended!
2142;Well obviously not a Bruce film,but shows his burgeoning talent.
2143;What can I say but great acting to the little boy who played the star (please dont become Macaulay culkin part II) and keep it up Bruce .
2144;it certainly doesn't deserve a best picture nom, but Oscar marketing being what it is nowadays .
2145;but it does have it's moments.
2146;Pretty manipulative, but very effective thanks to Toni Colette.
2147;all in all, 'the 6th sense' is a fun movie but still far from coming even close to being one of last year's best.
2148;This movie is very well.
2149;acted, and Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment are awesome in their roles.
2150;paced and believable, and the twist ending is.
2151;I thoroughly enjoyed it the first time I saw it .
2152;The first time you watch this film, you'll be shocked.
2153;If you watch it more than twice, you'll spot pretend clues, and wonder if they mean anything.
2154;And eventually, you will know the film back to front.
2155;for first time watchers, this movie is terrific.
2156;both Bruce Haley (Joel Osment) are so cute in this movie.
2157;Don't know what it is about Brucie in this, he looks kinda rough sometimes, but it just adds to the whole loveliness of him!This is a movie that will stay with you for ages afterwards.
2158;you'll be reminded of this great movie constantly.
2159;and I just have to hear I see dead people , and it sends shivers up my spine with remembering the scene in the movie that it happens!
2160;A great suspense/horror movie and very unique.
2161;GREAT acting by Haley Joel and Bruce Willis.
2162;I love it :) I just absolutely love this movie because it has that really weird and shocking surprise at the ending.
2163;I liked this movie, it was not as scary a I thought but was still good without the spooks.
2164;All of this was done through the tormented young boy and his crutch for life Bruce Willis.
2165;The same thing that I have told everyone, the movie is a solid 9 on it's own.
2166;But when I knew the movie was over I thought that I really liked it and would watch it on video when it was released.
2167;I just saw this movie today in the theatre.
2168;but let me just say that this movie has a surprise twist that you really don't expect and that leaves you on the edge of your seat.
2169;Haley Joel Osment is wonderful in this movie!
2170;like demeanor in an otherwise little kid makes his performance all the more real.
2171;It's plain to see why he got an Oscar nomination for this role.
2172;this movie is for you!
2173;This movie was mind twisting and thought provoking.
2174;The acting was very good and the plot came with a great twist.
2175;I was even given hints about the plot and was continually second guessing myself.
2176;I wouldn't consider this movie to be a horror film, but it is very suspenseful and very intriguing.
2177;When a movie can surprise a jaded moviegoer like me, it's managed a feat beyond reason.
2178;Willis tries to reason with him but he shoots Willis in the stomach before taking his own life.
2179;Cole is distrustful of Willis at first but pretty soon Willis is able to convince Cole that he is there to help him.
2180;there are some heartwarming scenes between Cole and his mother (something strange throughout is that Cole's mother and Willis never talk about Cole .
2181;this is a really well made move with great acting and it should hold your interest throughout regardless of its slow pace.
2182;the beginning is a real grabber and the ending is phenomanal.
2183;Haley Joel Osment is right on the money and Bruce Willis is powerfully superb.
2184;M. Night Shaymalan brings you into something new for a change
2185;This is one heck of a movie.
2186;It has a wonderfully realized plot, believable characters who act like they really care about each other.
2187;Haley is just out of this world great!
2188;He definitely should have won the Oscar for supporting actor.
2189;to carry so much of this complex, involving film.
2190;Those little shoulders did a fantastic job.
2191;He's an actor to reckon with!
2192;Her performance is the heart of the movie.
2193;Watching her go through her many layers of love, guilt, fear, and frustration, and yet maintain that love for her troubled son is worth the price of the video!
2194;Olivia Williams as Willis' wife is also extremely effective in a smaller but significant role.
2195;And the Rules and Clues tagged on the VHS edition help explain the director's ways he made sure everything fit properly.
2196;If you're looking for good, emotional drama about human feelings and what makes .
2197;humans tick, you will enjoy this movie.
2198;the characters aren't always likeable, but they're always believable.
2199;this is *not* a movie for children) makes sense in context and has a strong impact.
2200;This young boy is scared and the film allows you to understand and sympathize with his fear without trying to draw you into it.
2201;It is, in fact, a strong sub.
2202;theme in the life of the doctor.
2203;And these are more than made up for by the twists and turns that do occur.
2204;But if you can see the relativeness of happy and sad in an ending and appreciate the importance of both, you'll most likely find this one of the best movie experiences you've ever had.
2205;I saw this movie in the past, bought so I could watch it again.
2206;This movie is filled with allot of twist and turns.
2207;It's very important to Cole because he wants to trust, and to tell his secret.
2208;The action is with Cole and Malcolm and what is happening in their minds, psyches and relationships.
2209;We know he has a gift .
2210;Sudden, stunning clarity for Malcolm, and for us.
2211;I thought he would, but he does a wonderful job, as do all actors involved.
2212;That's always nice and we come to expect that.
2213;Quite simply this is the best film I have seen in years, M. Night Shyamalan should be commended for such an act of pure genius, and equally Haley Joel Osment for delivering such a brilliant performance for one so young.
2214;The Sixth Sense, written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan, is one of those films that has enjoyed both great critical acclaim and tremendous popular success.
2215;And it deserves them both: this is, simply, a great film.
2216;Shyamalan tells the story of Cole Sear (played by Haley Joel Osment), a little boy with a terrifying supernatural ability.
2217;But the film ultimately transcends the horror genre
2218;It is as much about love and communication as it is about fear.
2219;all the performances in the film are first rate.
2220;He is absolutely extraordinary in a performance that ultimately holds the whole film together.
2221;His chemistry with both Colette and Willis is absolutely electrifying
2222;Osment will frighten you, break your heart, and uplift your spirit in this role
2223;the ingenious script has its own inner logic
2224;He uses a brilliant combination of low.
2225;tech effects and production details to enhance his story.
2226;And James Newton Howard's excellent score complements the film as a whole.
2227;The Sixth Sense is one of those great films that rewards repeated viewings.
2228;Actually, I believe that a second viewing is absolutely essential.
2229;All in all, a deeply moving piece of cinematic art.
2230;This is as good as it gets!
2231;From the opening scene to the final second of the ingenious ending, it's ALL GOOD!
2232;The film which opened last August of 1999 blew everyone away.
2233;Well the film is now the number one thriller and here I'am.
2234;It helps the watcher develop a spooky and freakish mood which helps you enjoy the film in a fun way.
2235;I enjoyed watching M. Night's first horror film which I laughed vigorously.
2236;The film is wonderful and probably the best of '99.
2237;It's fun, entertaining, and you can learn a lot from the features.
2238;Now let's hope Shyamalan can pull of the Indiana Jones IV script!
2239;This was a good film but not nearly as good as what people are making it out to be.
2240;A much better film along the same lines is Stir Of Echos
2241;honestly, and I won't give away the 'ah ha!'
2242;moment, but I knew that he was.
2243;well, you know, what he was.
2244;i am a writer, and I also adapt novels for scripts, and when something like this comes along, that something that just totally grabs me and says, This is something special.
2245;i aspire to write something that can really AH HA!
2246;i recommend the movie, highly.
2247;The genius in this film is the ability of the screenwriter to give a pay day at the end of the film that is so shocking and rewarding that it makes you want to see the film again and again.
2248;This has got to be the best surprise ending that any film has ever had.
2249;It's a triumph in storytelling.
2250;M. Night's next film is called Unbreakable, which will star Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson.
2251;The script for this new film also has a surprise ending.
2252;It will be a treat to see M. Night's follow up film.
2253;I won't give away the ending, but it's quite a surprise.
2254;What is with human beings and their attraction to the super.
2255;the story centers on a boy who believes he can see ghosts and a psychiatrist who must find a way to help this child cope with his special ability that may unravel a mysterious truth not only for the boy but for himself as well.
2256;Dr. Malcolm Crowe is one of the best child psychiatrists in the city of Philadelphia.
2257;In fact, he was awarded a special honor by the mayor of Philadelphia himself ?
2258;Time passes and Malcolm Crowe returns to his job, though he has yet to fully recover mentally from the strange encounter.
2259;The story of The Sixth Sense stands alone as one of the best super.
2260;Shymalan, who before this film was not known for this type of genre, truly makes a name for himself with this thought.
2261;the cast for the film, though large in a sense when considering the numerous amount of characters with screen.
2262;time less then two minutes, is small in scale, especially when one considers that the film mainly centers on the actions of Haley Joel Osment and Bruce Willis.
2263;Haley Joel Osment, who is best known for his small appearance in the Academy Award.
2264;winning Forrest Gump, showcases his uncanny ability for acting by successfully pulling off one of the most challenging performances a director can give a child of his age, let alone any actor with as less experience as he has on screen.
2265;Bruce Willis, more known for his adrenaline powered roles in such action.
2266;time but it?s a wonderful surprise for those who know what they are looking for.
2267;Everything comes together so brilliantly in this film that is hard to find a film in the past few years that matches the exact effect The Sixth Sense is able to pull off ?
2268;the chilling musical score, brilliant performances, complex dialogue, intricate script, and clever direction, all of which work together and never seem to outbalance one another.
2269;This is a great movie with an amizing storyline and a well.
2270;in a world where they put a story about a murderer and use blood to try and scare you, this movie was refreshingly scary.
2271;This is the kind of movie that can haunt you, because of the great ideas.
2272;it was better in the theaters though,you say you want a movie with an unexpected and mind blowing ending?
2273;watch SLEEPAWAY CAMP(1983)the best ending in cinematic history.
2274;At last, a film that relies more on performances and storytelling than blood.
2275;Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette are amazing, and Mischa Barton (Lawn Dogs) turns in a jarring, unforgettable cameo.
2276;granted, Tak Fujimoto has done a superb job with the cinematography, and the look and feel of the film are superb.
2277;top special effects, and everything that creeps you out is done in a very subtle and subversive manner.
2278;This is one of the best thrillers to come along in a while.
2279;The movie it self is fantastic, everyone kept saying the ending was a big suprise but even with that knowledge I was still shocked when I saw the ending.
2280;The extras are top notch.
2281;Thank you Disney for finally getting your act together, keep it up!
2282;The deleted scenes have an intro by M. Night, which is a great because we get to hear why the scenes were cut and the purpose of the clips.
2283;You will be on the edge of your seat.
2284;M. Night Shyamalan is a master of his craft, and this may be his best work.
2285;Another cute little kid with special powers movie .
2286;This is an awesome suspense film.
2287;I was impressed myself about the film.
2288;But I assure you, if you have a good sense of fun horror, you will want to see this one for another 6 times!
2289;Excellent suspense/thriller film for anyone that is into that genre.
2290;Bruce and Haley were exceptional in the film all the way.
2291;suspense, drama, action, romance, and the entire spectrum of human emotions.
2292;It is not afraid to make us think, and is one of the few movies that makes a second viewing a near necessity.
2293;justified) enthusiasm for his movie are reflected in the colorful interviews and explanations of his favorite scenes, those that were in the movie, and those he had to cut out.
2294;Kudos to all involved in the film.
2295;but his Performance was Great more than i can say about the film.
2296;This is truly an amazing movie.
2297;I introduced this to my 15 year old and she thought it was mind blowing!!
2298;Sixth Sense is a good film, but I found it very overrated.
2299;Everyone and their mother praises this film as being not only one of M. Night Shyamalan's best films but one of the best films period.
2300;I found it to be a decent suspense/horror film.
2301;Bruce Willis does a good job in the film.
2302;Crowe meets a Cole Sear, played by Haley Joel Osment.
2303;The twist at the end you could see coming judging from the beginning of the film.
2304;bruce Willis and Haley do a fine job acting wise.
2305;I thought they were both likable and had energy, which is more than I can say for the character in Shyamalan's latest works.
2306;The story was competent as well.
2307;Yet the tension keeps you in its grip throughout the film.
2308;The message of this film is one of healing.
2309;By facing what we fear healing can come.
2310;This is a movie that moves the viewer through a wide range of emotions from fear to love.
2311;Exceptionally intelligent, exciting, touching film marked by wonderful acting by Osment.
2312;I recommend all to watch this film, even if you're deathly afraid of thrillers and ghost.
2313;Both Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment are incredible and believable.
2314;I was scared to the point of peeking through my fingers at times, mezmerized and totally surprised at the end!
2315;Fabulous film making, directing, acting, plot, cinematography, everything.
2316;It got to me on so many levels.
2317;provoking, mysterious, romantic and scary.
2318;Lots of atmosphere, and a great surprize ending.
2319;The movie itself was good as well as the cast.
2320;i was very pleased with her nomination as well as the boy's.
2321;I feel this movie should have won at least one Oscar.
2322;it is a good movie with neat special features.
2323;This is by far, the best movie I have ever seen.
2324;The acting was great, and the suspense kept me on the edge of my seat.
2325;The whole plot was exellent, and the ending was amazing!
2326;This movie is a must.
2327;This is Bruce Willis' best NON.
2328;The screenplay is superb, twist turns everywhere.
2329;Kept me on the edge of my seat.
2330;enough to make you go back watch it again.
2331;Sixth sense is one incredible movie.
2332;A subdued performance from Bruce Willis.
2333;one of the best movies of all time.
2334;Watch the making of, and they explain everything, and how certain things were hints to the parts often overlooked or confused people, and never just watch this film once.
2335;The second time you'll notice more.
2336;This is a very intelligent film, and it gets those more who have had experiences with paranormal, death, loss, and grief, and even fear.
2337;I wouldnt say it's just a horror, but it's creepy enough to be called that, but it's also a drama, because at times haley joel osment's acting is so terrific that it's touching, espeically when he cries.
2338;I've never seen a more genuine actor at his age.
2339;He has alot of talent.
2340;I think Bruce Willis was the perfect man to play malcom, because for some reason certain people, actors and actresses mesh well in movies, and you can sense the chemistry among the actors.
2341;Haley And Bruce were great together in this film.
2342;This movie is perfect in my opinion.
2343;Certain movies, bring a certain kind of energy, and to people who are involved in the making of these kind of movies.
2344;I've actually seen this movie four times with various friends and relatives.
2345;The Sixth Sense contains a beautiful balance of action, horror, and surprise!
2346;All of this is supported by outstanding cast performances.
2347;The ending will knock you off your feet!
2348;I also saw it in theatre.
2349;hailey Joel Osmont was excellent and Bruce Willis in his best role ever.
2350;tHe story is a little Flat at some moments but really entertaining in other overal a great movie.
2351;Cole keeps this fact very secretive and well.
2352;It is directed and written brilliantly by M. Night Shamalyn.
2353;But, it is Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette who manage to shine the most.
2354;Osment is brilliant as the confused kiddo Cole, he deserved an Oscar and a Golden Globe.
2355;Like everyone I wanted to see this movie.
2356;I sure hope they don't make a part 2.
2357;This creepy little horror movie is actually a good deal better than the genre suggests.
2358;Next to all those vacuous teen horror films it is a real gem.
2359;what's crucial is that Shyamalan hasn't just created a horror shocker but has intensely studied human loss.
2360;Plus, it's a rare horror movie that doesn't only scare its audience but also move them, both of which `The Sixth Sense' manages to do.
2361;The scares are also a lot more to do with tricky camerawork that will make you jump out of your seat than gut.
2362;Willis turns in his best ever performance in an understated, quietly touching role and Toni Collette makes you forget all about her brassy role in `Muriel's Wedding'.
2363;perhaps what makes the movie so good though is the fact that it is a distinctly adult horror that genuinely frightens and moves its audience.
2364;The story was tensed and very emotional.
2365;But the real impact was that after the movie, I kept thinking about it.
2366;It was well written and directed.
2367;I also enjoyed the Bonus materials, I wish there was more behind the scenes shots.
2368;Good movie, a really great movie in fact.
2369;It was a great surprise ending and I really enjoyed it.
2370;Bruce Willis' perfomance is wonderful .
2371;I coughed up $8 three times for this one (each time expecting to be less interested than before) and found myself even more into it than the last.
2372;Haley Joel Osment is great as the boy with a terrifying power (I see GOLD in his future).
2373;In my opinion this was M. Night Shyamalan's best film.
2374;It will keep you on the edge of your seat.
2375;There's a major plot twist at the end.
2376;See if you can figure it out before it happens.
2377;down one of the greatest movies ever made.
2378;It's got a great plot, cool characters, memorable lines, and a great ending.
2379;I highly recommend this movie!!
2380;Bruce Wills and Haley Joel Osment both give good performances in this one.
2381;I watched it a second time found it a bit better,but not great.
2382;the director had some good Ideas which I liked just thought it could of been more fine tuned ,but good overalll.
2383;A movie to see twice.
2384;It is reported that it will contain a 3.
2385;Bow Wow and P. Diddy, a new film.
2386;All the reviews about this movie are true.
2387;This is a grate film.
2388;I recommend this to evreybody even if you dont even really like scary movies this is a must see movie.
2389;The movie with the now imfamous I see dead people line is actually a really good movie.
2390;The film is filled with interesting characters and a twist ending that will leave your jaw on the floor!
2391;all of the actors in this film did an excellent job.
2392;Even without the ending this is still an absorbing movie.
2393;Willis gives a superb and selfless performance .
2394;The Sixth Sense was definitely one of the most satisfying movies of this past year.
2395;Nominated for several Academy Awards this year including the coveted Best Picture as well as Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, Best Original Score, Best Supporting Actor and Best Supporting Actress.
2396;All the performances are impressive in the movie, especially that of 11.
2397;I have to admit, this kid has got talent.
2398;More talent than a lot of other actors 4 times his age.
2399;Her final scene in the movie is one of my favourites.
2400;He assures that she continues to watch over her and that she has made her very proud as her grand.
2401;The breakdown scene in the car was so beautifully acted.
2402;See this movie if you haven't already.
2403;The surprising plot twists and amazing performances are all worth it.
2404;This is one very interesting, gripping movie.
2405;A very captivating movie from start to finish.
2406;A great film made even better by the surprise ending.
2407;Guaranteed to excite those who believe in the other side, as well as those non.
2408;So when a child's psycologist (Bruce Willis) comes to try to help him, he end's up winning the child's trust and Cole tells him his secret.
2409;He's so good for an 11 year old!
2410;This movie is great for thriller fans, it has an ending that no one can call!
2411;Bruce Willis portrays his charecter very well.
2412;It was a good movie with a surprising twist ending.
2413;It is a good movie for older viewers.
2414;Bruce Willis is Malcolm Crowe in the movie.
2415;He is a child psychologist that was one of the greatest psychologists in his field.
2416;Malcolm's wife Anna, or Olivia Williams, also plays an important part in the movie.
2417;In the movie Malcolm wins an award for being one of the best child psysiologists.
2418;This all leads into a surprise ending.
2419;I enjoyed the way the movie all came together in the ending scene.
2420;I also liked how the movie was acted and its storyline.
2421;It is a good movie that keeps you thinking.
2422;It is a thriller that makes you leave the theater how great of a movie it was.
2423;This was a great movie, and I don't know why people keep putting it down.
2424;This movie had a great plot, which was full of twists from beginning to end.
2425;Although it was predictable at times, it is still a thriller everyone should see.
2426;Writer/director M. Night Shymalan's The Sixth Sense is that rarest of breeds: an intelligent, well.
2427;made film that conquered the box office.
2428;shymalan, ably assisted by Tak Fujimoto's brilliantly icy cinematography, wrings suspense and terror out of empty doorways, split.
2429;But this is hardly a cheap slasher film: perhaps the most wonderful aspect of this film is its message, that fear can be conquered through understanding and compassion.
2430;cleverly plotted, bolstered by fine performances from Olivia Williams as Willis's melancholy wife and Toni Colette as Osment's worried mom, and graced with a twist ending worthy of Hitchcock, The Sixth Sense is a magnificently creepy film that will have you jumping at shadows long after it's over.
2431;I enjoyed it, sure, but I sure didn't think it deserved a best picture nomination.
2432;There are a bunch of extra features .
2433;this is the story of a Philadelphia child psychologist
2434;We are as intriuged as he is by the boy's unnatural talent.
2435;ultimately, the greatest shock comes after Cole has overcome his fear of the walking dead
2436;The movie has some good points, a few good sub plots involving a dead girl tring to call Cole for help.
2437;Watching it again, it's still as good as the first time I saw it with my wife.
2438;This is one of those movie that I will want to watch over and over again.
2439;What I can say is that you get an incredible performance from Haley Joel Osment (I see dead people) and a very convincing performance from Bruce Willis as well.
2440;But it's definitely worth seeing.
2441;Bruce Willis is superb (I think it was the little smirk that can't totally be erased that may have cost him a well.
2442;deserved Oscar nomination), Toni Collette is, as usual, great.
2443;But it's Haley Joel Osment who will astonish you.
2444;He may have only been ten years old when this was shot, but this kid is a brilliant actor.
2445;This is filmmaking of the highest caliber, and deserves to ascend to the pantheon of classics.
2446;A great script and awesome acting from a young Haley Joel Osmant.
2447;Acting of the protagonist boy was very impressive, too.
2448;You will have one word on your mind when this breakneck thrill ride is over: Wow.
2449;It has the suspense, the terror, everything.
2450;The acting by Haley Joel Osment, Bruce Willis, Toni Collette, and the rest of the cast is excellent.
2451;I would highly recommend this to anyone.
2452;This is a wonderful movie and I was so excited to see it on Blu.
2453;ray at such a great price!
2454;This Movie never lets you go!
2455;A must see for anyone.
2456;It is the coolest movie I have EVER seen.
2457;He is THE best actor I have ever seen and he's only 11 years old.
2458;He has so much talent.
2459;He really brings the movie together.
2460;There's a little suprise for everyone that watches this movie, so enjoy it because it is probably one of the coolest movies you will ever see.
2461;The director is great and so are all the other people that helped put it together.
2462;Thank you for reading my review.
2463;This movie does not have all that gore like most scary movies, it is a very chilling and intelligent movie, it really makes you think, and every time you watch it there is always something I guarantee that you might have missed like a piece of clothing, an object, and so on.
2464;There are also some great supporting performances by Olivia Williams as Malcom's wife, Toni Collette as Cole's mom and there is even a small cameo by director M. Night Shamalayan as a doctor in a clinic.
2465;Sixth Sense is an intense and amazing psychological thriller that will haunt your dreams and your minds for a long time.
2466;This would have to me one of the best movies I have seen in a long while.
2467;(Haley Joel Osment) the little boy who's eerie line I see dead people is one of the best child actors of today.
2468;His portrail of what we assume to be a very confussed and haunted little boy is magnificent.
2469;And Bruce Willis what can I say, another fantasticly played role.
2470;the acting in this film was top notch.
2471;Seven years later, this is still what great film making is all about.
2472;This movie is just so well done.
2473;The actor who plays the little boy is freaking amazing.
2474;He thought it was great, and it was a nice way to introduce him to a type of thriller that is a little more subtle than his typical movie watching fare.
2475;Defintely one of the best thrillers out there.
2476;It's somewhat scary, and holds your interest for sure.
2477;star film by any means.
2478;The ending can be surprising .
2479;I figured out the big secret in the first five minutes, but I still enjoyed this film tremendously.
2480;All involved should be commended for their work.
2481;director M. Night Shyamalan, to hit the theaters!
2482;No matter what your movie interest are you will enjoy this movie.
2483;The one that really got me was when he said that when you get a cold chills that's when they are mad.
2484;Once you get to the end and learn the twist rewind it and watch it again to pay attention to all the things that you over looked.
2485;They ruin what could have been the best movie in my collection.
2486;This film is sure to become a classic a few years from now!
2487;A film with no flaws: a thrilling story, wonderful performances, great editing and use of music.
2488;I've watched this excellent movie more than 6 times.
2489;I have also been anxious to see this lot.
2490;Sorry, kids, but The Sixth Sense totally blew away The Blair Witch Project.
2491;Walking into this movie not knowing what will happen is the best thing you can do.
2492;This movie is stirring, emotive, smart, well.
2493;directed, and Haley Joel Osment is the finest young actor I've ever laid eyes upon.
2494;this is one of those rare movies that you MUST SEE, and you'd be missing out on a truly fantastic time if you skipped out on it.
2495;Shyamalan has hit on a nerve and scored a bulls eye.
2496;The film is littered with touching moments and is designed to tug at the heart strings rather than stimulate any fear impulses.
2497;NOT as a riveting thriller or horror film Strictly for those people who do not watch REAL horror films.
2498;this movie is one of the best ive seen.
2499;the sixth sense is intensive drama,it keeps u at the edge of ur seat for the whole thing.
2500;i recomend it to everyone that got a good movies taste
2501;There is also an obvious subtext about the nature of our fears as well as themes concerning courage and communication
2502;Most viewers will be conscious of this stuff during the first viewing but will mostly be focused on sorting out the story and processing the intriguing conclusion.
2503;With this realization comes the awareness that the real power of the film comes from a viewer's subconscious connection with this underlying theme.
2504;class job of doing just that.
2505;He loved it more than anything else.
2506;And then one day Malcolm meets this wonderful little boy, a really cool little boy.
2507;And Malcolm decides to try and help this new boy.
2508;The climatic scene in the car between Cole and his mother (Toni Collette) ranks up with cinema's all.
2509;What else is there to say but, perfect the first time!
2510;I enjoy watching this movei with people who haven't seen it or don't know what happens in the end.
2511;Great film overall and a couple of scares included.
2512;The two go hand in hand.
2513;The truth is that many people figured out the ending within the first few minutes on the bases that they simply heard it had a great twist.
2514;If you view this film without having heard anything beforehand you are in a much better position to enjoy it, but there is a margin out there who will get it and will only enjoy it because other people did not get it and there is some fun to be had in knowing that other people where played with.
2515;The actual production values are somewhat minimal.
2516;You can see that everyone was happy with the gamble and it paid off.
2517;Osment is a very important casting decision here.
2518;this is a great twist of a movie, but not such a great movie.
2519;Again the premise, plot and structure is based on that ending, a small gamble because of the strength of the twist, but still it leaves the vast majority of this movie somewhere around mediocre with limitations that do show themselves now and again.
2520;The director of the 6th sense obviously knows how to move and motivate the full potential of an actor.
2521;Halley Joel Osmont concieved an excellent performance and does deserve best supporting actor.
2522;The story in genius, is well scripted, and well done.
2523;The direction and the script was intelligent, making movies like Austin Powers 2 and American Pie, one hit wonders like a bad hit by a wanna.
2524;it was still a great movie!
2525;Trite Hollywood fodder unfortunatly described by some as a Masterwork
2526;I loved the movie it was in excellent shape and arrived in great time I had ordered it for Fathers Day and we were able to enjoy it that night
2527;, and I began to laugh hysterically.
2528;A young boy has the uncanny ability to see and communicate with the dead.
2529;This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat and wanted to pee your pants the whole time.
2530;M. Night Shymalan is one of today's best directors.
2531;The performances by the actors are fantastic and believeable.
2532;The movie has a plot that is totally awesome with an awesome ending.
2533;This is certainly one of my top 10 movies of all time.
2534;All in all a good movie.
2535;Mr. M. Night is one of my favorite directors/screenplay writers.
2536;both content and context, that display Manoj Night Shyamalans' amazing talent.
2537;I see it as a query creator.
2538;Mr. Night has a talent for generating internal queries from the viewers of his films.
2539;I am referring to our internal selves our spiritual selves.
2540;what I like about this movie is that when I watch it I am compelled to experience more of that part of life that I feel.
2541;Did you feel like the spirit world was showing you something through this film?
2542;The film spoke to me and I can explain it only one way.
2543;Whenever I watch this film, I have to ask.
2544;and that is the gift from Manoj Night Shyamalan to his audience.
2545;The deleted scenes are interesting to watch, after the first, if not second time you've seen released cut of the movie.
2546;The rules and clues featurette also make a nice insight into the movie's production.
2547;I suspect it will have another viewing soon however.
2548;hype ratio is surprisingly high.
2549;This is an outstanding movie!What must it be like to be a small boy who sees dead people ?
2550;I thought Haley Joel Osment's performance was extraordinary.
2551;i already knew the big twist before I saw The Sixth Sense , but I found that it didn't matter.
2552;I was able to enjoy the story and the performances on their own merits.
2553;get.you moments, Shyamalan is able to keep the suspense level very high.
2554;Unlike most of the horror/suspense movies made today, which rely on a lot of technology, stunts, and effects, The Sixth Sense is a throwback.
2555;I found it refreshing and all the more enjoyable for that.
2556;shyamalan has a ways to go before he earns the title of The Next Spielberg , but he's well on his way to the top of the field.
2557;This kind of subject is fascinating for anyone .
2558;its not a horror film, its a thoughtful, suspenseful story .
2559;the next autumn/fall history begins to repeat itself with Crowes new patient, Cole.
2560;that point aside, this is one of the better films I've seen, simply for its thoughtful speculation of the nature of ghosts, and the story's clever twists.
2561;This is the kind of film Twilight Zone fans will love, but maximum.
2562;be that as it may, the line I can see dead people has got to be a film line destined to be in the future books of world's greatest film lines!One last thing .
2563;to really see this film you'll need to watch it twice!
2564;A great movie that appeals to anyone regardless of your age, sex, likes/dislikes, etc.
2565;If you haven't heard already, the ending is great and a nice change from the normal predictability of cinema.
2566;The child played by Haley Joel Osment is a genius!
2567;THE SIXTH SENSE is a very unusual movie about a young boy who has the ability to see and hear dead people.
2568;The movie is helped by an ending with a terrific wallop and a strong supporting cast which includes Toni Collette and Olivia Williams.
2569;much of the success of the film was due to writer.
2570;this movie is wicked .
2571;the best bruce willis movie ever made !
2572;To me the magic of this film vanished at an unknown point in the second half of it.
2573;Now I have seen it many times and it is still there, the trigger.
2574;Overall: The cast is great, especially young and very talented Haley Joel Osment.
2575;The music is just the right one for this kinda movie.
2576;The Sixth Sense was a good movie.
2577;I feel an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture was probably overly generous (Best Actor, however, was deserved) but nonetheless a fine film.
2578;Bruce Willis is a wonderful, feeling actor in every movie he is in.
2579;The young boy was intensely convincing .
2580;a magnificent portrayal of a persecuted soul.
2581;Also the director stayed away from clich ' relationships between American mothers and their children and presented a breathtaking portrait of a sweet child and his loving, caring mom, who, through her own grief and pain, did all she could to keep him emotionally safe and sound.
2582;Like these great movies .
2583;which are its undeniable genre antecedents .
2584;winking gimmicks to capture your attention and hold you riveted until its explosive revelation at the end.
2585;a compelling combination of intelligence and escapism and .
2586;some genuine shivers that far surpass the best of what the teenie.
2587;sequels can ever dream of offering.
2588;Bruce Willis is admirably low key in a performance of quiet confidence and power, and Toni Collette (Muriel's Wedding) proves she's no one note wonder with a performance of the same power and conviction as that of Ellen Burstyn's classic turn in The Exorcist.
2589;Haley Joel Osment is surely the best child actor to ever grace the screen and delivers a performance of such maturity, depth and intelligence that its scary in and of itself to think how much this boy actually knows at his age to hit all the right notes so accurately with such adult material (although, here too, The Exorcist provides precedent through Linda Blair).
2590;one of the five best horror movies ever made and a proud asset to my own horror shelf.
2591;The setting of The 6th Sense is spot.
2592;Highly recommended to watch right in the middle of the night, when you are all alone.
2593;the greatest thriller of all time like the advertising says.
2594;Michael Caine is great, but Haley deserved it!
2595;He is so understated and fabulous here, that I dare any of the other wunderkids in Hollywood to even approximate his performance.
2596;Bruce is wonderful as well and my girl Toni Collette is so great.
2597;It got 2 stars because the acting was good.
2598;It had that kind of an impact, and has re.
2599;Like the great films of suspense by Alfred Hitchcock, this film doesn't have to show gore to be effective and leaves you with the chills thruout, and on the edge of your seat.
2600;A great film, worth watching many times.
2601;some people like trailers so for some it's an welcome bonusB.
2602;You watch it again knowing the ending and say wow that was really cool how that was set up.
2603;You watch it again and say wow that scene really fits, You watch it again and say wow here's a hidden message .
2604;I see dead people This line has become a staple of modern cinema.
2605;This, the main plotline to the movie is essential to the enigma.
2606;We're certainly led to believe so, with such terror in the heart of our child lead, Cole.
2607;played with excellent skill and soul by Haley Joel Osment.
2608;The Sixth Sense is on the verge of being one of the greatest phsycological thrillers of all time.
2609;Shyamalan created the perfect mood at the beggining, maintaining it until the explosive climax.
2610;I was literally palpitating with suspense throughout this amazing tale of a young boy who can see deceased people and a phsycologist's attemt to help him.
2611;Shyamalan has one of the most innovative ideas ever.
2612;It is perfectly carried out by the new Master of Suspense .
2613;I recommend this film not only to those supernatural enthusiasts out there.
2614;first of all, it hits close to home.
2615;In fact, I was elated!The talented Bruce Willis takes on the role of psychologist Dr. Malcolm Crowe, very distinguished in his profession.
2616;Haley Joel Osment, newcomer to the big screen, plays Cole Sear, a disturbed 8 year.
2617;Cole, with this magical skill, can help others.
2618;Indeed, young Cole speaks the harrowing truth.
2619;tHE SIXH SENSE proves to a fickle audience, namely America, that special effects aren't required to make a superb and memorable horror film.
2620;M. Night Shyamalan's unforgettable effort (not his first, FYI) is bone chilling, dazzling, and beautiful, with performances that either launched careers or furthered them.
2621;This film is a masterpiece, no matter how you try to look at it, and it deserved all 6 of its Oscar nods.
2622;enjoy this thrilling treat, if you haven't already.
2623;A great movie, The directory could have included the deleted scenes in the orginal movie, they are wonderful with good acting.
2624;I loved this movie and the theme and story line.
2625;I love the actors and I think this is one of the best most well done movies of all time.
2626;I received de item just on time, and excellent conditions of the package, very good service, go on like that!!!
2627;In my opinion, this was the best horror film I have ever seen.
2628;I have been watching horror films since the age of 2 years old, so I have seen many.
2629;I mainly like this movie because it was so unpredictable.
2630;This one is the best by far.
2631;This movie has brought him to a new level of entertainment.
2632;I give this movie the highest rating even though I think it deserves more than 5 stars!
2633;Hats off to the overrated M. Night Shyamalan for hoodwinking tons of people into thinking this film is great .
2634;That alone is a talent (I think).
2635;The reason being that this is a great film, even if you don't like horror movies, I suggest you give this a go.
2636;Both Bruce Willis and Joe Osmond is great in this, the script is well written with a major surprise thrown in.
2637;I have to admit that I am not a major horror movie fan but this is one of the best.
2638;This was one the best movies of 1999 along with American Beauty.
2639;This movie kept me glued to the screen the whole time.
2640;It is very well written and acted.
2641;Toni Collette and Haley Joel Osment were outstanding in thier performances.
2642;He answered, At the end.
2643;I just love THE SIXTH SENSE.
2644;But even though this film didn't scare me, I still really loved it.
2645;A few years later, Malcolm moves to Philideliphia and has a new patient: a 9.
2646;Cole lives with his single young mother, and is frightened by the ghosts he sees because they make him do stuff .
2647;tHE SIXTH SENSE is an amazing film with awesome special effects and a strong, solid storyline and well.
2648;The acting by the entire cast is absolutely flawless and serpurb.
2649;Haley Joel Osment is definitely one of the best child actors I've seen since Macualey Culkin, and Bruce Willis gives off one of his greatest performances ever.
2650;i still feel THE SIXTH SENSE should have won some of the Oscars it had been nominated for, and it definitely should have won Best Picture and Haley Joel Osment should have won Best Supporting Actor.
2651;forgotten by now, but THE SIXTH SENSE is still popular and excellent.
2652;I also watched the rules and clues special feature and then watched the movie again.
2653;Other than that, it's truly the best movie I've seen in a long while, and I've seen a lot.
2654;I have, and after seeing this movie it happened a lot more.
2655;The Sixth Sense has great performances from Bruce Willis (who plays Malcolm, an emotionally wounded psychologist)and Haley Joel Osment (who plays Cole, a little boy with a remarkable gift:he sees dead people) The screenplay is wonderful.
2656;Malcolm is determined to help him.
2657;this is a remarkable movie with a Hitchcokian twist at the end.
2658;watch it, and you'll be doing double takes next time you feel that strange presence behind your back.
2659;Certain scenes had me on the edge of my chair.
2660;Still enjoy this movie, even though I have seen before and know the outcome still enjoyed very much.
2661;The acting by both Bruce and Haley was FANTASTIC!
2662;good movie,but i bought this video and noticed that tthere are sum stuff that deserves the PG.13 rating is taken out of this versian.yes i own the movie taped.
2663;the revelation at the end reveals that something IS missing, and I think it was a wonderful technique to create a sense of suspense and curiosity.
2664;The kid (Haley Joel Osment) is really good
2665;made movies by the director when he was a kid that are hilarious while still indicating the talent that would bloom later.
2666;A great movie Hitchcock would have enjoyed.
2667;I saw the movie twice and YES I got those jumpy moments twice.
2668;The acting is oscar winning like and the kid Haley Joel Osment is a definite winner.
2669;Sure, the effects were cool (what little there were) and the acting good.
2670;driven director grabbed credit for so many original ideas .
2671;Haley Joel Osment is exceptional as the boy troubled by visions of the dead and Bruce Willis is suitably poignant in his role as the troubled psychologist.
2672;Also, I must commend director Shyamalan for his restraint in regards to horror effects .
2673;In this age of slash and bleed crap like Scream (1, 2 and 3 ad nauseum)any horror movie which goes a thoughtful, psychological route is to be applauded.
2674;so, The Sixth Sense is well acted and reasonably intelligent.
2675;The Sixth Sense is a passable evenings entertainment, not a great film and certainly not a great ghost story.
2676;This is a great movie, no denying it.
2677;But lets face it, is it worth spending $20.00 on a film whose most memorable moment is its ending.
2678;I very seldom want to see a movie twice.
2679;see the film again, then watch the director (our Alfred Hitchcock) talk you through the thought process that resulted in this amazing story (he wrote the story, directed the picture, and played a cameo role).
2680;See scenes that were cut from the movie.
2681;Hear how the musical score was constructed to complement the unusual story line.
2682;Hear how this story started as a seed in the mind of a boy and grew into one of the best ghost stories of all time.
2683;And it only takes two words to do so.
2684;If you haven't seen The Sixth Sense, you must see it.
2685;It's boundless commercial success should have given me a clue.
2686;the direction and cinematography are flawless.
2687;The acting is first rate.
2688;willis gives the performance of his career, finally revealing a talent for the emotional subtleties demanded of his role.
2689;His portrayal is so compelling and real that once the movie is over, you find yourself missing his face.
2690;The movie is really great, just check the other reviews on the movie itself.
2691;First is the menu which by itself will give the viewer chills .
2692;Excellent performances and a VERY clever story.
2693;In my opinion The Sixth Sense(released Aug/99)is director M. night Shayamalan's best effort to date.
2694;this movie combines wonderfully effective narrative trickery which sets the viewer up for a shocking,unexpected and powerful one.
2695;on the way home the next day Cole is with his mother in their car.
2696;an accident has occurred up ahead and the traffic is backed up.
2697;then he reveals he can talk to ghosts and tells his mother that his grandmother often appears to him.
2698;the doctor's wife and he however appear to have become estranged and he pays a visit to his home.
2699;the director skillfullyweaved the story in such a way using every narrative trick in the book to throw us off the scent and he succeeded in spades.
2700;wonderful film,beautifully written and executed.
2701;technically the film has been transferred well into its' 1:85:1 a/r.
2702;this top notch edge of your seat film includes many elements such as drama,love,thrills and pathos all wrapped around the subject of ghosts.
2703;its' famous ending will leave you gasping and its' stars Colletee,Osment and Willis all turn in Oscar caliber performances throughout.
2704;I watched it 6 times already and everytime I watch it I still get the chills!
2705;This movie has absolutely everything!
2706;A great writer/director, great actors, a great plot, and a brilliance not found in many movies.
2707;This movie, and its actors, have won and been nominated for numerous awards (including Oscar's), and they deserved to win every one of them.
2708;this movie is FILLED with all of them!
2709;Explore the paranormal as you learn that gifts are not always pleasant from actor Haley Joel Osment, who delivered a performance that can only be described as stunning.
2710;watch this movie again and again, every time you watch you'll learn something new (especially between the first and second time).
2711;This is an enjoyable movie, that truly has seeped into culture.
2712;A must see for everyone!
2713;And the extra features are a very nice bonus.
2714;This Movie Is More Then Good.
2715;Haley Joel Osment and Bruce Willis team up to make this a teriffic film.
2716;After seeing this film numerous times, there are two scenes that stand out as unforgettable and making the movie worth seeing.
2717;M. Night Shyamalan directs a masterpiece of darkness and suspense.
2718;This film is a wonderful character study, proving that you can make a great film without resorting to gore or multi.
2719;it's that can only be enjoyed once, the ending of this film had me go back several times to see how it was done!
2720;Stands up well, forget any review that puts it in a trick box.
2721;I think this is one of the best endings I've ever seen, I liked it a lot, almost like THE GAME ending.
2722;As long as no one has said anything about it, everyone should enjoy it.
2723;This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat!
2724;I caught the surprise twist right at the very beginning, but I still thought it was a great movie.
2725;The Sixth Sense is very unusual in that is it a horror movie with a heart.
2726;But the film still has heart.
2727;He has learned to repress what he sees for fear of being called insane.
2728;So at first, we see it as a psychological thriller.
2729;This is an outstanding movie that grabs your attention and does not let go until the final credits roll.
2730;But after you see it once you notice the details that show what the ending is going to be like.
2731;But I recommend this movie.
2732;It is a must see movie.
2733;The Sixth Sense is a great movie!
2734;He was a great character.
2735;And the end of this movie is great and surprising!
2736;THe Sixth Sense is definatly one of the best movies i have ever seen!
2737;Makes one hopeful for the future of scary flicks.
2738;I am reader mostly of good ficion.
2739;This is a movie of exceptional storytelling.
2740;This powerhouse thriller achieves a runway victory on the basis of sheer storytelling excitment.
2741;Mr M. Night Shyamalan, the wrtier and director, wields this suspense like a stiletto.
2742;Bruce Willis and the boy, Haley make this ghostly film work.
2743;The ending to the film will show that Bruce Willis charcter is also a .
2744;I can't give up the clues here, you got to go see the flim.
2745;i will only say that this is a film that the viewer must watch more than once to fully appreciate and enjoy.
2746;This is a powerfully done, well acted and well told supernatural thriller that is several cuts above most films of this genre.
2747;Excellent performances, great direction, and a very creative storyline make this film one of the most impactful thrillers I've ever seen.
2748;Sufficient to say that most viewers will be impressed and moved by this powerful and frankly scary movie.
2749;a movie that will hold the interest of almost all viewers.
2750;this movie shows somethings that some people can actually do.
2751;This is a movie that is only truly enjoyed with the first viewing.
2752;from an entertainment perspective the movie is great.
2753;The acting is good not great and the directing is superb.
2754;The scenes and camera angles really enhance the tone.
2755;never the less this is a fine movie with thrills and mystery.
2756;In the end cole achieves some healing with his mother as he reveals his secret.
2757;This story unfolds very well and keeps you interested through out.
2758;I've been a fan of bruce willis for some time, he does an outstanding performance here, no die hard, just great acting.
2759;We've watched this one several times and it's still great each and every time.
2760;Bruce Willis is great as always as a failed psychiatrist who seeks to redeem himself by helping Osment.
2761;I loved it, received it in excellent condition and very quickly.
2762;It is intelligent, well acted, articulate, thought provoking and immensely intriguing.
2763;What a way to end a flick.
2764;have that simple pure thought that sees through the veil.
2765;I'd count it among my top ten favorite movies of all time.
2766;it is an intelligent flick.
2767;Also I believe they could have done more with the story line, especially between the relationship of Dr. Crowe and Cole and towards the end of their relationship.
2768;But it was a great movie, the ending was interesting and very moving and the acting was great!
2769;m. Knight Shyamalan and his psychological and powerfully thrilling film The Sixth Sense gives us in much respect what The Exorcist did.
2770;when Dr. crowe decides to throw himself into his work by taking a case with a hypertensive boy named Cole Sear he begins to feel proud of his work.
2771;nominated for several awards and best picture , best director it has all around great acting but the performance from Haley joel Osment is briliant,sweeping and inteligent.
2772;great acting by Bruce Willis,Toni Collete also.
2773;Bruce Willis's performance destroys the great performance of the young star Haley Joel Osment.
2774;It is heartening that a Hollywood movie with few special effects, superb performances and an intelligent, moving script can succeed amidst the bang.
2775;Mesmerizing, melancholy and searing, The Sixth Sense is one of the few movies in recent years that provides that elusive element of genuine, thrilled surprise .
2776;Haley Joel Osment brings such an intense power to the role of Cole that you believe every word he says, and feel his torment down to your toes.
2777;Toni Collette embodies her role, a working.
2778;class mother, with empathy and truth.
2779;There is much power in this fanciful story, and the movie is thought.
2780;This is one of those ghost stories that goes beyond a run.
2781;mill thriller, both visually and emotionally.
2782;I will say that the performances of everyone were terrific and this a movie to see and trust me when I say this.
2783;For the first 30 minutes or so, I thought I was going to be pleasantly surprised by this movie.
2784;The acting is generally pretty good and the photography, while not exactly groundbreaking, is intelligent and nicely done.
2785;The direction of the actors is pretty impressive, too, and occasionally even unique.
2786;I can see this director making a really good film at some point if he pays a bit more attention to his script.
2787;The twist ending is fairly easy to figure out before the end and is both intriguing and then silly once you think about it.
2788;Bruce Willis is fine .
2789;Toni Colette is excellent as usual .
2790;quite effective in a relatively underwritten role.
2791;He is really ACTING .
2792;he seems like an adult actor, which is the main reason he impressed so many viewers.
2793;I only hope he doesn't get ruined by the Hollywood system, because he does seem to have the potential to become a really great actor.
2794;All in all, the movie was pretty entertaining .
2795;Everything except for the script does seem pretty darned tight and thoughtful.
2796;See it over and over and relish each experience, and remember the ultimate experience is that you have watched one of the greatest movies of all time.
2797;Unbelievble story telling, great film.
2798;osmond is a terrific young actor .
2799;This is one terrific movie
2800;This child actor will be one of the greatest actors of the next few generations.
2801;I loved this movie and I couldn't beat the price and hire fast they got it to me I was highly satisfied abd would recommend this movie to anyone.
2802;The Sixth Sense is a wonderful movie.
2803;Bought it now to share with my young pre.
2804;I have always enjoyed BRD and very much enjoyed this one.
2805;Love the director and the stars.
2806;An excellent movie with a great suspence horror , It`s about Dr malcom (Bruce Willis) who is having some trouble in his realationship with his wife at the same time he`s trying to help his patient (Haley Joel) the kid who can see dead people .
2807;Shaymalan has adeed scary scene`s beside the amazing ending of the movie .
2808;Very good movie would recommend it to anyone who loves the paranormal experience and the two disc series was great
2809;This film is one of the best films that i have seen.
2810;The actors are good and Bruce Willis and the little boy who plays a kid who sees ghost are very good actors I have seen this film 3 times and if you haven't seen the film yet i Suggest you better see it.
2811;The ghost in it look so real.
2812;This movie was quite a surprise at the end.
2813;Sure it had an eerie atmosphere, and one jump scene, but that was pretty much it.
2814;Bruce Willis is good, but it is Haley Joel Osment who steals the show, his performance as the tortured boy is flawless.
2815;I also found the film to be quite moving, especially the last scene between Osment and his mother.
2816;The famous twist at the end is also something to appreciate.
2817;this is one great film even after repeated viewings.
2818;Watch the director's commentary on this one for a special treat.
2819;Sound and Picture are great!
2820;This movie is the most commercially motivated, ridiculoussellout of a film.
2821;The second 1/3 was pretty good suspense.
2822;The last 1/3 destroyed the whole film.
2823;This movie is the perfect example.
2824;Bruce Willis plays an award winning phsychatrist and Haley Joel Osment beautifully portrays a fatherless child who sees ghosts.
2825;A run in with a former patient that is very disturbed starts off this epic tale.
2826;Osment is treated by Willis to help control his special gift.
2827;In treating him Willis discovers something about him that may chill you to the bone or warm you to your boiling point.
2828;Sixth Sense is a moving thriller that ranks upon my must see movie list.
2829;In an era of cinema filled with stupidity, trashiness, violence, and cruelty, The Sixth Sense manages to stand out, for it's own time and even more so today, as a stunning example of serious cinema at it's finest.
2830;If you over analize this too much afterwards it can take away some fun though.
2831;The acting is excellent especially from the young boy.
2832;There is a reason that this movie is the top box office seller in its genre of all time.
2833;I had to see it twice just to make sure of what I saw the first time.
2834;The entire cast was excellent and it proved to be a real leap for Bruce Willis.
2835;The stroy is complicated and scary, the performances are deep and emotional, the drama is heart wrenching, it suffers from one thing, being kind of short.
2836;i sincerely hope Disney does not create a trend by doing this.
2837;This is hands down absolutely the best thriller I have ever seen.
2838;If you own it already, give it as a gift.
2839;This is a great movie, no doubt.
2840;The Sixth Sense with Bruce Willis is one of the best thrillers that is out to this day.
2841;The acting is great and the storyline is awesome and i liked that M. Night Shyamaln makes you use your imagination and use your thoughts.
2842;If you love thrillers that keep you on your toes then you really should check this one out.
2843;It is a great suspenseful movie, it makes you think about what happens when you die.
2844;This is one of those movies that keeps you at the edge of your seat.
2845;A very intelligently scripted and amazingly acted film in which Bruce Willis proves that the action stereotype is just a misconception of him while he plays a child psychologist with a real sense of character.
2846;Bet it makes you jump.
2847;It has been a long time since I have seen a movie so worthy of a five star rating!
2848;After seeing Bruce Willis so many times in action films, it is wonderful to see him in such a heartfelt and believable role.
2849;His ability as an actor shines through in his role as Malcolm Crowe, and Haley Joel Osment is wonderful in his role as Cole.
2850;A heartfelt hooray to Toni Coltette as Cole's mother.
2851;She brings the torment of her dealings with Cole's problem right into your home.
2852;Anyone who wants a hold your breath until the end jaw dropping thriller should see this film.
2853;Be prepared to jump, laugh, cry and be amazed!
2854;This is one of the best movies I've ever seen!
2855;The scene when he revealed his secret to the doctoer left me with chills, he was so believable!
2856;For those of you, like me, who are a little chickenhearted, watch this one during the day!
2857;excellent film, very engrossing with an honest.
2858;goodness plot twist at the end.
2859;Good performance by Osment, as well as Willis.
2860;I love the little boy Haley Joel Osment in this movie and Bruce Willis did a spectacular job.
2861;This was a good movie.
2862;I give it four stars and leave it up to you whether to watch it.
2863;This kid is absolutely the most incredible child actor on the scene today.
2864;He is so believable as the troubled Cole Sear, the realization that you're watching a film vanishes.
2865;Toni Collette's performance as Cole's mother is also riveting.
2866;Don't get me wrong, I love movie previews.
2867;despite the forced commercials, this was a great film.
2868;A story of troubled spirits, in this world and the next, all looking for love and understanding.
2869;the deleted scenes are powerful, but it's understandable why they were cut.
2870;Watching the first film by the director that he shot when he was 12 is cute and inspiring to young filmmakers or young people with any high aspirations.
2871;Excellent work by all involved.
2872;The rules and clues feature of the disc will help those who want to watch the film over and over again.
2873;I ordered two for myself and a friend.
2874;One of the better movies and pleased with how quick we received.
2875;Without the fine performances rendered by the spooky kid Haley Joel Osment, the witty screenplay with a smart twist ending, the film' s overall dark ambience portrayed by Fujimoto Taku's sublime cinematography and, we have to admit, especially for the first week of its big screen release in US, Bruce Willis' s viewer.
2876;pulling magnetic power, this nearly US $ 03 centimillion blockbuster wouldn' t have come this far.
2877;the Sixth Sense is the incredible film that properly portrayed the overlapped realms of LIFE and DEATH through the eyes of a sorrowful, depressed child Cole Sear and his therapy session under care by an award.
2878;winning child psychologist Malcolm Crowe who was once shot by his FAILED case.
2879;The film also cleverly includes the sub.
2880;Like a well told tale, The Sixth Sense first captures your attention and then leads you little by little to the twist at the end of the film.
2881;A successful child psychologist is shot by an ex.
2882;patient, who is now an adult, claims that he knows what causes our fear when we are alone.
2883;No gore, but this film did make the hairs on my arm stand up.
2884;I like dark films, I like films with kids as protagonists, and hey, I even like Bruce Willis most of the time.
2885;Sixth Sense is an orginal film with strong technical merits and a solid plot line.
2886;going audience is easily enthralled with a cutesy.
2887;Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment did an absolutely fabulous job.
2888;It has a bit of mystery in it and you have to figure out who is dead and who isn't.
2889;I highly recommend this movie to everyone.
2890;I love the story line in this movie.
2891;Very interesting and entertaining and the acting is very good as well.
2892;The Sixth Sense is a very well done thriller movie with a few scary parts, and an excellant twist ending.
2893;The acting in this movie is top notch, especially the little boy, Haley Joel Osmont, who outshines Bruce Willis.
2894;If you would like to see a well done thriller movie with some great (especially for the thriller genre) acting see The Sixth Sense.
2895;The items included here are a pretty good Hollywood 101 assembly.
2896;If you want to learn how the director, the producer, the editor, the cast, and all the other folks who put these films together do it, watch the special.
2897;rules and clues (this one's great!)
2898;The sequence is logical, although not quite chronological
2899;making machinery meshes with art.
2900;In sum, it's a good look at how they made a movie in the twilight of the 20th Century.
2901;one note about the film itself: I'm not a Bruce Willis fan by any means, but I will give the man credit: he understands the role of his character completely.
2902;Instead he made what seems to be a conscious, deliberate effort to recede, and for that he deserves credit.
2903;The good acting and realistic script give this movie a real sense like this is real, not acted out by people for money.
2904;M. Night Shyamalan has finally done his dream of making classic film.
2905;Bruce Willis has done a good movie with out having to kill people, although I doubt he will be able to do another.
2906;The sequence they show the scenes is planned and in a precise order to add to the suspense til the last frame, which leaves you in awe and a feeling that you have to watch the movie again, just one more time.
2907;This movie is truly one to be checked out, how many horror/suspense movies can be opped for an academy (best picture).
2908;Check this one out, great two hours.
2909;An awesome film, Bruce Willis can KIND of act, and Haley Joel Osment is exceptional, same with Toni Collete.
2910;This is how scary movies should be, suspenseful, exciting and with good acting.
2911;you have to see this one TWICE!
2912;haley Joel Osment (Cole) is either the most gifted child actor today or he has been working on the script since birth!
2913;He is a completely polished actor
2914;One of the last scenes of the movie with Cole and her in the car is some of the best acting I've EVER seen.
2915;the acting, script, direction, music, sound effects and cinematography work together in complete harmony to make this movie EXTRAORDINARY.
2916;This movie has so many terrific things going for it .
2917;acting, scripting, beautiful moody cinematography, score and overall sound design.
2918;Though I'll hear it for this one, The Sixth Sense is a better overall movie than American Beauty.
2919;If you've not seen it, and have been lucky enough not to have had the ending revealed to you, you'll have a terrific, spooky time.
2920;There are so many things right with this film it is hard to know where to start.
2921;First the acting is the best I have seen in any kind of suspense/supernatural thriller/horror film since The Exorcist.
2922;Bruce Willis turns in his fine performance on the level with his performances in Pulp Fiction and 12 Monkeys.
2923;He is an intense, loving husband, and caring helper.
2924;worthy performances that suspend disbelief and bring you into to the wide range of emotions used on the director's and screenwriter's palette.
2925;There are layers and layers to this story, yet the director carefully unravels them to a climactic ending that in the hands of a lesser director could have ended up being one big mess.
2926;The delicate relationship between Malcolm and his wife gives the audience insight into the vulnerabilities of Willis' character.
2927;the soundtrack is understated but extremely effective.
2928;a. half special effects documentary like the one included in The Mummy.
2929;A movie you'll watch over and over again.
2930;Watch The Sixth Sense to find out why.
2931;this movie kept me at the edge of my seat the entire time!
2932;The ending will shock you as it did for me.
2933;I was shocked and amazed.
2934;Instead if you really watch this with your eyes open you will find a much deeper movie about letting go and acceptance.
2935;Nothing is new in Hollywood.
2936;One of the movie's big selling points, but apart from that and the young boy's performance, there really isn't that much to shout about.
2937;The sixth sense has potential to make you jump, it has a couple of flashes of excitment and is well directed.
2938;The acting and the twist is its saving grace.
2939;The irony of The Sixth Sense being released during this month is all the more peculiar when one hears of its $8 million triumph on opening day, not to mention curtailing a $30 million mark its first weekend.
2940;discussed horror mockumentary The Blair Witch Project, the success of The Sixth Sense surprised not only its skeptical audiences but its humble filmmakers as well.

2942;Not only is Cole oddly intuitive but he also has the power to see and communicate with restless phantoms, entities that consistently make their presences known in the dusky apartment that he and his mother Lynn (Colette) share.
2943;Like the rest of the world, I was mesmerized by 11.
2944;Willis had ventured into chancy territory before undertaking the complicated role of Malcolm Crowe, choosing character roles like high.
2945;Collette had a shorter but nevertheless impressive resume, Shyamalan having enjoyed her as Muriel Heslop in the 1994 comedy Muriels Wedding.
2946;Only the people who allowed themselves to be consumed by the directors languid but intriguing style and the riveting performance from Osment were shocked, but they were pleasantly surprised as well by how carefully he concealed the truth.
2947;So to the critics who pieced together the theoretically palpable puzzle: good for you.
2948;Just dont ruin it for the rest of us who would prefer to enjoy the film for its imagination and talent rather than embarking on a rabid search for its technical flaws.
2949;The real joy for me was to see the performance of Bruce Willis, one of the best of the year, and a pity it wasn't more praised.
2950;The plot twist at the end was a real shock.
2951;The Sixth Sense is a must.
2952;Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment are amazing.
2953;Even though it wasn't very scary and it was highly overrated, I still think it's a great entertaining film.
2954;Haley Joel Osment and Bruce Willis both equally did a great job in the acting part.
2955;The overall concept of this film was believable .
2956;This is an entertaining film, but don't expect too much horror.
2957;This is M. Night Shamalamadingdong's best film!
2958;Arrived n time in perfect condition.
2959;Among the best ghost stories ever told, The Sixth Sense succeeds mightily as a horror movie, a relationship drama, and a spiritual thriller.
2960;In arguably his best role, Bruce Willis plays Dr. Malcolm Crowe, a dedicated psychologist still haunted by his inability to help a disturbed patient who later took his own life.
2961;worthy vituoso performance) who seems at first to be plagued by the same kind of mental problems that hounded Crowe's former (later suicidal) patient.
2962;Both actors elicit tremendous empathy for their characters, and the supporting cast shines pretty brightly too.
2963;The scene in which Cole finally confides the truth of what he 'sees' with his special sense to the doctor is an absolute classic.
2964;excellent from start to finish, and if you're one of the few people on the planet not to already know the genuinely shocking twist ending, that's all the more reason to get it and see it as soon as possible.
2965;Some magazine my wife had read blew the ending for her, but she still cried up a storm.
2966;The film is THAT moving.
2967;Some one (in this case a little boy) is seeing ghosts and has to perform services for them so that they can move on .
2968;At first the kid is thought to be disturbed, but with the help of his psychiatrist he is able to come to terms with his gift and move on with his life.
2969;The use of camera angles and perspective is amazing.
2970;It could prove a very interesting follow up to a great film.
2971;Good luck at the Golden Globes and see you at The Oscars!
2972;I made the decision to see this movie because I had seen an interview with Mr. W and he made sense for the first time.
2973;He appeared to have some insight into his own life and the role he has at this time.
2974;Sixth Sense has had one of the best casts that i have seen for ages.
2975;Choosing Bruce i thought would be a bit dodgy as we were used to seeing him in the Die Hard films, but he rose to the challenge and was fantastic and worth all the money he was paid.
2976;The film has an excellant story line about a young boy who sees ghosts and seeks help from Bruce Wills.
2977;In this summer's proliferation of scary movies, The Blair Witch Project got all the hype, The Haunting got all the fancy schmany special effects, and The Sixth Sense won the acclaim of moviegoers and critics alike.
2978;This film is the best of the new crop scary movie flicks (the aforementioned, as well as Stigmata and Stir of Echoes.
2979;stop adrenaline ride from then on out.
2980;there are some holes in the plot and a few melodramatic moments, but all in all this movie is fantastic.
2981;There are two particular bright spots that outshine its other traits, however.
2982;spoken and as realistic as any other actor I have seen.
2983;Because of his age, I think this is one of the best performances of the year (nuge, nudge, Academy).
2984;The other bright spot is the twist at the end that will literally make your head spin.
2985;That is all I will say about it.
2986;overall, this one is a must see.
2987;see more of my reviews at [.]
2988;m. Night Shyamalan may not have had any truly notable films before this endeavor, but with The Sixth Sense he establishes a strong foothold in the Hollywood circle.
2989;His clever and absorbing storyline stands as only a small piece of this elaborate puzzle.
2990;The true force driving the film is its focus on character.
2991;Haley Joel Osment steps on the stage shortly into the film and immediately fills the surreal atmosphere of the past with a vigorously subtle mysteriousness.
2992;while Willis strolls through the movie with a believable and serene atmosphere (until the end's final twist, which is questionable when considering some of the previous sequences), he is always several steps behind Osment's truly formidable presence.
2993;Slowly and carefully it spins the story that intertwines these somewhat lost souls and the unique ending situation that binds the duo.
2994;Rather, Osment should be mostly credited with the true praise, his performance simply swept the screen.
2995;time, but the payoff is well worth it.
2996;I'll be watching the Academy Awards this year for the first time since Pulp Fiction to root for this movie.
2997;A psychiatrist(Bruce Willis) tries to help him with his power, at first not believing him but then he comes to terms with his doubts and realizes this boy is special.
2998;This movie sets the stage for a great ending that hits you like a Yankees homerun caught on your nose.
2999;The interviews with the director was very interesting watch out for this guy I think he's up and coming.
3000;office surprises of that year and this genre and rightly so.
3001;the film's strengths lie in the wonderfully subtle performances by the stars who all rightly deserved their Oscar nominations.
3002;I still consider this one of Bruce Willis's best performance if not best, but with a career that easily bounces around from comedy to action hero to thrillers it's hard to really say what is his best.
3003;type thriller (considerVertigoas a great example).
3004;His eyes are truly the windows to his soul.
3005;stricken, single mother is flawless, believable at all times, and heart.
3006;wrenchingly touching as she attempts to communicate with her child that she believes may be beyond reaching.
3007;mounting pace mixed with sudden unexpected jolts brings about incredible tension and suspense.
3008;Shyamalan is brilliant at slowly giving us the pieces to the film's puzzle to the point where we feel, as the audience, like complete idiots for not getting it sooner.
3009;His is a very gifted director and writer who can effectively bring his vivid imagination to the screen.
3010;up for the ghosts that only Osment can see is jolting and convincing each time and often surprisingly revealed to us.
3011;Their presence is eerie, disturbing, and, forgive the pun, haunting.
3012;my only complaint about this otherwise flawless piece of entertainment is that it is, as some critics have rightly pointed out, a rather contrived work, but most good mysteries are by the nature of the genre itself and not so much because of the writer and director of which Shyamalan is both.
3013;handed with his contrivances, but, wow, can he tell a story.
3014;These are series worth owning by the way.

3017;thirds of the film but the last third is great.
3018;The last third of the film is genuinely heartfelt and stunning.
3019;worthy
3020;If anything, The Sixth Sense certainly has a GREAT twist.
3021;The surprise ending is both logical and intelligent, and I didn't come close to guessing this conclusion beforehand.
3022;The surprise conclusion significantly helps in elevating the film.
3023;For a superior thriller with an even greater twist.
3024;ending, see Robin Hardy's The Wicker Man.
3025;Good movie has you going one way for a while then you find you were led in the wrong direction and missed the real story.
3026;all of which are too conveniently explained away by the caveat that ghosts `only see what they want to see', The Sixth Sense remains one of the most gripping and revolutionary films of the last twenty years, and marked the arrival of a major new talent.
3027;With this and his more recent Unbreakable and Signs, M. Night Shyamalan has taught us to be more sophisticated in our viewing, revived our sense of cinematic wonder, demonstrated that thrillers and `family values' movies need not be mutually exclusive, and, more simply, given us three ripping yarns.
3028;Like the best novels, his films are utterly riveting, beautifully crafted and, at their heart, have something important to say.
3029;M. Night Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense is a noteworthy example of how the technique of misdirection can be employed in cinema.
3030;psychologist Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) returns home one evening after receiving an award for his work with children.
3031;A former patient awaits him there and shoots him in front of his wife.
3032;The Sixth Sense created a sensation upon its release as filmgoers relished its twist ending.
3033;fiction fans or to those who are actually paying attention to the events unfolding onscreen rather than sitting back and just going along for the ride.
3034;From the beginning of the film, one knows that something is amiss and the twist becomes more and more obvious as the story continues to unfold.
3035;The acting is first rate with Willis, Osment, Toni Collette, and Olivia Williams turning in great work.
3036;Willis in particular turns in an interesting performance that is a departure from his more action.
3037;It is by far one of the best pieces of art I have seen in a while!
3038;This is a great flick!
3039;What surprised me most about The Sixth Sense is how cerebral it is considering that after all, it is a horror film.
3040;even though The Sixth Sense boasts outstanding performances turned in by Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment, M. Night Shyamalan's exquisite directing and storytelling is what makes The Sixth Sense stand out as one of the best films in 1999 and in the horror film genre.
3041;What is even more effective to the purpose of the film is the thought.
3042;evaluate and reconceptualize the story and its events and it demands you to watch the film over and over to attain a deep understanding of its concept, without losing its awesomeness and splendor simultaneously.
3043;If you crave the intellectually challenging thriller flick and a much more macabre presentation, then I highly recommend Seven.
3044;Either way, The Sixth Sense is a well.
3045;Everytime I see the movie I find new meanings to simple dialogs and scenes.
3046;I saw a new meaning to life.
3047;In The Sixth Sense, the director gently probes and implies.
3048;There is no violence or special effects.
3049;The film is moving, from the loneliness of the wife, the sense of duty of the doctor, to the uncanny behaviour of the boy.
3050;This film may not appeal to the masses, but it is immensely thought provoking, and must deserve special mention.
3051;And the cutesy kid obviously acting as a cutsey kid.
3052;I loved this movie, but, Haley Joel Osment was clearly robbed at the Oscars.
3053;Bruce Willis gave his best performance since the original 'Die Hard.'
3054;And finally wait for the final development of the relationship between mother and son and you will understand why people at the theaters went back again and again to see this one!
3055;You will be surprised and stunned and if you have a great heart then you too will find tears in your eyes!
3056;I want to hug Bruce Willis!
3057;Many Thanks to the Director and Producers!
3058;the movie was excellant and the action was superb.
3059;the direction was gorgeous and i am proud to say that he was from my country.
3060;This is a great movie with an incredible ending.
3061;I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes suspense movies.
3062;I saw this movie for the first time on VHS, and found it every bit as mesmerizing as people who saw it in theaters said it was.
3063;The interview with the filmmakers afterward was a great bonus.
3064;The twist at the end is brilliant, but what makes it even more impressive is that when you watch it through the second time, you see that the movie plays absolutely fair by its own rules, and the established rules of the ghost.
3065;The entire plot makes perfect sense in light of what you now know.
3066;I just watched it again and was amazed by how well rendered the entire movie is and how Shyamalan plays totally fair with his surprise.
3067;I'm not usually a fan of Bruce Willis in his action roles but he is just perfect playing Malcom in this much quieter movie.
3068;Philadelphia, a city I never think much about, comes alive and I now want to visit it and see the historic sites.
3069;And there is really a pretty nice spiritual message for a ghost story.
3070;Highly recommended for ages 14 and up unless unusually sensitive to shivery surprises.
3071;One characteristic of an excellent movie is that you think about it for days.
3072;The movie was also a catalyst to discuss things like death, the soul and the meaning of life for us.
3073;There is a reason this movie is listed in several lists of the top 100 movies of all time.
3074;The Sixth Sense is one of those movies that younger audiences or audiences unfamiliar with a lot of movies will see as new and innovative, even shocking as so many below have indicated.
3075;i first saw The Sixth Sense long after its theatrical release and so was quite removed from all the hype
3076;that having been said, there are positive points to the film.
3077;The troubled boy is played spookily well.
3078;Some of the scenes are genuinely unsettling, though the director steals a lot of the scariest more atmospheric moments from Kubrick's The Shining.
3079;This was easily one of the best movies I have seen thus far.
3080;i loved the twist they hit ya with at the end of the movie and I had to watch it a second time.
3081;The star of this movie was Cole played by little Mr. Osment, I hope to seen him again and again.
3082;Look at my face, this was a great movie!
3083;saw this movie and it was so spine chilling and realistic.
3084;but the reality is this could and may be a true experience on life as we know it so thats the mind boggeling part to this movie .
3085;enjoy people its worth it .
3086;Oh this is really a great movie.
3087;The scene with Cole and his mother in the car is a definate tear jerker.
3088;it really is worth it!
3089;this is perhaps the most gripping film I've ever seen.
3090;Here I was, sitting in the theatre enjoying splendid performances.
3091;I'll start out by saying that THE SIXTH SENSE was one of the most effectively creepy and affecting movies of its year.
3092;Bruce Willis gave a surprisingly capable performance, and Haley Joel Osment did an excellent job of handling a very difficult role.
3093;The success of this movie did seem a slight bit overwhelming though.
3094;To me this is a good but not great movie.
3095;Anyways, I do like this movie a great deal.
3096;And, it's definitely a movie that should be seen more than once.
3097;But One of the best films ever made?
3098;This is an entertaining and worthwhile film, but it is a bit overrated.
3099;It is a psychological thriller that keeps you in suspense until the end and then leaves you shocked.
3100;Multiple viewings help you discover all of the intricacies of the film.
3101;This is a classic that everone should own if they like the movie.
3102;This movie will be as good 10 years down the road.
3103;i still feel somewhat astounded by its intelligence and mesmerised by its beauty.
3104;If you were to mix these you might end up with something close to the Sixth Sense: an original supernatural thriller, with excellent character development and relationships which is not too big to have an element of romance.
3105;Brilliant displays by Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment gives the film its edge.
3106;i can offer you no more than my assurance that this is a film that I believe will appeal to all.
3107;It is an emotional journey, which will leave a lump in the throat and a chill in the spine of even the most hardened of persons.
3108;This movie was one of the best from 1999!
3109;I think he deserved to win the Oscar for his role because he showed ammazing talent for such a young actor!
3110;I thought Hayley should have won an Oscar for his performance.
3111;Bruce was good too and he deserves more than he gets for his acting ability.
3112;but upon a second viewing i realized that the director was pretty true to his words.
3113;most people will like it.
3114;It was one of the best movies I'd seen in five years.
3115;So frightening yet poignant, an emotional mix that is very fresh.
3116;The Sixth Sense should have swept the Oscars, and would have if the Academy wasn't comprised of a bunch of hypocritical snobs.
3117;after two mostly overlooked features, Praying With Anger and Wide Awake, M. Night Shyamalan (who should have won both Best Director and Best Writer) firmly implants himself in the national consciousness with this thriller of a movie that will have you guessing at every turn.
3118;tak Fujimoto does some of the best cinematography work I've ever seen.
3119;The traditional horror movie's time of safety becomes, in Mr. Fujimoto's very capable hands, just as dangerous as midnight.
3120;He is assisted by James Newton Howard's eerily unsettiling score.
3121;and what it evolves into becomes something much greater than ever imagined.
3122;and the end was very surprising.
3123;It really makes you think.
3124;This is probably one of the best psychological thrillers ever made!
3125;The ending is incredible
3126;Last year's The Sixth Sense is a very unique film in that it's both a very scary supernatural tale and a sublime story of friendship.
3127;Cole has a special gift that most adults wouldn't want
3128;this film has a very interesting premise, but more than that perhaps it's strongest asset are the strong performances by Haley Joel Osment and the underrated Bruce Willis.
3129;Osment gives a star making performance showing an almost scary amount of maturity for a young child.
3130;As for Willis, he gives his most earnest and best performance to date showing what a fine talent he really is.
3131;Much recognition should go to Willis for Osment's performance, and for his own as well.
3132;another great ability Willis has is having complete trust from the audience.
3133;Being as huge and important a star as Willis is, he shows restraint from turning this performance into a star vehicle.
3134;one more wonderful thing about The Sixth Sense is the writing by director M. Night Shyamalan.
3135;Many of the films wonderful plot turns come naturally and are done with great care as to show the audience that these aren't artificial scares and suprises.
3136;The Sixth Sense is a film like Ghost , an emotional supernatural tale with a suprisingly sweet heart.
3137;There are emotional responses from the audience ranging from genuine fright to overwhelming suprise and delight.
3138;It is because of these wonderful suprises and performances that The Sixth Sense may reaffirm your belief in movies.
3139;This was a great film.
3140;It is surprising, and 2.
3141;I was looking forward to seeing this movie because I love these types of stories, and it had great word of mouth reviews.
3142;It was really boring, but the ending made it almost worth it.
3143;When The Sixth Sense first came out I enjoyed it as a harmless, derivited popcorn drama.
3144;As time wore on and the public accolades pilled up my initial acceptance erroded as this supernatural TV movie was propelled by it's ending twist to excellent status and an Oscar nod for Best Picture, pushing out superior films ( Cider House did that too, but not so much).
3145;The most blatent loser in all of this is the overlooking of the true best movie of 1999.
3146;Politics of both films aside each's biggest selling point is there remarkably similar reality.
3147;redefining twists and it's at even this point in which Fight Club comes up resoundingly superior.
3148;Fincher not only perfectly intigrates his twist into the story, but it also perfectly coincides with the self denial of the character and the spirit of Chuck Palahiuk's novel.
3149;The difference is Fincher's twist is intrigal to the effect and overall message of the story, while Sixth Sense is meerly a nifty trick.
3150;Great acting, keeps you guessing, has both sad and happy moments, definitely gives you the willies the entire time!
3151;The best part is the twist at the end!
3152;Haley Joel Osmont makes this entire movie, he is the perfect child actor, with no phoney emotions.
3153;The Sixth Sense is the perfect scary movie, it is scary and thrilling, without relying on endless blood and guts.
3154;Perfectly written and perfectly filmed, acted, and directed, The Sixth Sense is a true delight and a marvelous gem.
3155;At least it made the top 10 list, a greater prize than an Oscar.
3156;guard and had quite an impact.
3157;I sometimes joke that Signs is the first alien movie that's ever moved me to tears (call me sappy, but it's true).
3158;not because I'm scared, but because I genuinely feel for the characters and what they're going through.
3159;Both of these movies resonate with me as few films have.
3160;What a payoff I got.
3161;i realize that M. Night's style isn't for everyone, but to me, his approach to filmmaking is a welcome throwback to a time before we had pull.
3162;He shows us ordinary people in extraordinary situations and we get to see how they react .
3163;haley Joel Osment is an amazing actor.
3164;His abilities go way beyond his young years, making The Sixth Sense much more than a cute little kid in peril story.
3165;Bruce Willis' performance is skillfully nuanced and understated .
3166;The supporting cast, including a virtually unrecognizable Donnie Wahlberg, is top.
3167;There are four deleted scenes, a conversation with M. Night, an interesting piece called Rules and Clues about the conventions followed throughout the movie and the subtle hints about what's really going on, as well as other goodies.
3168;I think he's an incredibly talented filmmaker, and I think The Sixth Sense is a first.
3169;The film begins with an up.
3170;coming child psychologist (Bruce Willis, in his most exceptional role to date) celebrating his new.
3171;found success with his wife (played by Olivia Williams).
3172;nominated Osment, who happens to have a special sense that allows him to see and speak to ghosts.
3173;the film is brilliantly directed and scripted, twisting and turning until the much.
3174;While Willis and Osment's performances are hauntingly special, Toni Collette's role as the tormented mother of Osment is the shining star of the film, delivering a powerful performance.
3175;The Sixth Sense is a deep, terrifying look into the world of the supernatural, but unfolds into a film about faith, love, and unbridled second chances.
3176;A soulful masterpiece that will send chills up spines.
3177;I'm glad I have it to look at occasionally Very good story line and great acting.
3178;The Sixth Sense is one of the best movies ever!
3179;Haley Joel Osment is perfect as Cole in this supernatural thriller.
3180;Some scenes gave me goosebumps and the ending absolutely shocked me!
3181;See this film, believe me you won't regret it.
3182;This is a clever, non.
3183;gory, scary film.Young Haley Osment and Bruce Willis give very convincing performances.
3184;After you watch it the first time and the surprising ending is revealed you'll want to watch it a second and third time with new eyes, catching all the things you may have missed the first time.
3185;Once again they let the genre of the picture rule what they veiwed as a movie good enough to win their honors.
3186;This is possibly the best written, acted, and produced movie to come out in 20 years.
3187;My second viewing will be about enjoying the way in which I was so beautifully led astray, perhaps seeing if there were clues I should have spotted.
3188;This is a film I will put away and show again to some unsuspecting guest.
3189;This movie is one of the best in the last few years.
3190;i love this movie and think that Willis was excellant in this even without his normal action pact character.
3191;this little one is going to take movies by storm.
3192;I enjoyed every minute of it.
3193;The producers directors on this were very creative on this one.
3194;by far the best movie i have ever seen.
3195;Bruce Willis goodness, and the twist will make your skin crawl.
3196;This movie had an excellent plot and good shocking surprise.
3197;There were also clues to reveal that ending.
3198;It scares the viewers by surprises of the ghost and the frightening music.
3199;The Sixth Sense turns out to be one of the highest grossing films of 1999.
3200;The film offers a twist ending that is supposed to be a surprise, but if you have any common sense, you will see it coming.
3201;It has it's strong points however, M. Night Shyamalan looks like he knows what he is doing and the ending is phenominal.
3202;the dialogues were simply the best ans the photography was more than excellent.
3203;it is a classic sci.
3204;A reasonable movie with atmosphere.
3205;But a classic this ain't.
3206;With that said it was still a good movie.
3207;The dead people were done convincingly and it was still very entertaining.
3208;A movie that at first glance seems like a horror film with many chills, turns into a unexpectedly moving drama with a surprising ending.
3209;This is a movie that will make your hair on the back of my neck stand up.
3210;to be sure, not all of them are welcome.
3211;Also, I found the storyboard.
3212;The film is dissected thoroughly, taking the viewer through an exploration of how each element contributes to the director's overall vision.
3213;Deleted scenes are also given director's commentary, which nascent filmmaker's will undoubtedly find valuable.
3214;To top it off, there's an excellent running commentary of the film as well.
3215;this movie, if you're going to watch a Shyamalan movie, is the better of his only two good ones.
3216;This is a must see movie that will scare anyone who sees it.
3217;Instead it simply meanders along a great story line and makes you jump every once in a while.
3218;Everyone knows the ending makes the movie what it is.
3219;This is such a great movie!
3220;It's so refreshing to watch a horror movie with an intelligent plot and great actors.
3221;This is the kind of movie you can watch again and again.
3222;It stays with you, and may just be powerful enough to change our views on some ideas.
3223;This film is absolutley amazing!
3224;It came basically out of nowhere to become one of the most honored films of the year.
3225;Haley Joel Osment is astounding as the child (named Cole) who sees dead people.
3226;He is more convincing than most characters in films this year.
3227;Toni Collette also does an above average job as Cole's mother, acting as anyone would in the situation she was in.
3228;shyalaman does an amazing job creating twists and turns in his screenplay, thousands of tiny details that you never notice until after the movie is over.
3229;The ending is so smart and tricky that it gave me chills.
3230;Shyalaman directs his actors and actresses so well that sometimes we forget that this is only a film
3231;See this movie as soon as you can!
3232;I watched this movie with a couple of friends last summer.
3233;It also has a great plot of seeing dead people that aren't even aware they're dead and have unfinished business.
3234;It had even been a long time since I had seen it, and this film is sure to entertain you as much now as it would 15 years ago.
3235;It's a great film you might want to see if friends are over looking for a spooky yet thriller kind of movie.
3236;Not one of my favorite movies, but at least entertaining.
3237;But in a broader sense, it is the ability to see the invisible, non.
3238;Many children and adults are gifted with the ability to see what other people cannot see, the ability to see what is read between the lines of the 5 normal senses.
3239;the 6th sense is a sensory skill that can be improved through effort and education.
3240;It is often learned best by watching socially intelligent women who have suffered greatly and have decided to try to find ways to understand and care for those hurting around them.
3241;The 6th sense is empathy.
3242;Like ghosts, in the best sense of the term, we see them regularly revisit us.
3243;This is a great film for these, and many more universal reasons.
3244;The movie is haunting and worthy of the Academy's attention.
3245;Bruce Willis and Haley Joel are perfect for both the roles.
3246;The movie is engrossing from the first and successfully carries one to the ending.
3247;The Sixth Sense is ingenuis and pure brilliance.
3248;I was amazed at how good the acting was, I was thrilled with how good the story was and I was enthralled at how good the direction was.
3249;Dare I say one of the best movies of the century, and the best thriller ever made.
3250;I bought this movie solely to see Donnie Wahlberg's brief but amazingly powerful scene in the beginning.
3251;It's an amazing movie, with wonderful acting and a terrific story line.
3252;I strongly suggest everyone see it at least once in their life.
3253;Its an excellent movie, unexpected ending which makes it an astonishing movie.
3254;It is worth purchasing,and it will be seen more than once to make sure there is no mistakes in the movie!
3255;I just saw this movie and I can't believe so many people think this movie is a classic!
3256;The movie was great and thrilling.
3257;A superb and thrilling performance.
3258;Scream) this movie was rich in plot and was portrayed brilliantly by Osmond, and leading actor Bruce Willis.
3259;The movie is suspenseful and the ending is completly unexpected.
3260;It is very well portrayed and enacted too.
3261;the subtle horror is indeed good.
3262;iam waiting for the weekend to see the movie again!
3263;Keeps you guessing but you figure it out about half way through the film, if not at least three.
3264;Bruce along with his movie wife Olivia Williams (who shines better in Rushmnore ) give great performances but it is little Haley Joel Osmet that steals the show as the boy with a gift for seeing things others don't.
3265;Together they unravel the secrets and even become friends.
3266;This is an excellent picture.
3267;The movie The Sixth Sense is the best movie I've ever seen!
3268;The special efects are great, and the plot is of undying interest.
3269;Sure to please anyone with a love for the unreal or unbelieved.
3270;It's so scarry, you'll be screaming at the top of your lungs!
3271;This is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen.
3272;I think this is a great movie.
3273;The acting was good especially Osmen.
3274;Parts of the movie was also very moving (when Osmen told his mom that his grand mother had actually went to see his mom's performance and his mom started crying
3275;The ending was also very surprised and smartly handled.
3276;Full of unexpected twists and turns it's very clear that the director was inspired by Serling and the Twilight Zone.
3277;This is a good old fashion thriller with a number of memorable scenes.
3278;willis gives a subdued performance (which he duplicates in Unbreakable a riskier film that doesn't quite pay off as well as 6th Sense does), and Haley Joel Oswald gives a heartfelt performance.
3279;The O'Henry twists are pretty well hidden (although I thought it was pretty obivious by the last third what was going on).6th Sense along is a great popcorn movie (or icebox movie as some of the studio heads used to call these type of films in the 40's).
3280;Will you watch it more than once or twice?
3281;More than likely if you enjoy good acting and Hitchcockian thrillers.
3282;I found that this movie was very well done.
3283;all the performances were astounding esspecially by Bruce Willis,Haley Joel Osment,and Toni Collette.
3284;it's very well done film with a original story.
3285;i feel this movie should've won more awards for it's originality.
3286;it's a great film don't miss it.
3287;The sixth sense was a good movie.
3288;Anyways, it's still a great movie, and very suspenseful if you don't know what happens at the end.
3289;bruce Willis is very good, and i guess he must have made an impression on Mr. M, when he casted him in his other film Unbreakable directly afterwards.
3290;The i see dead people theme has been copied in film after film with pretty good success, but few have had the impact The Sixth Sense had.
3291;This is arguably Shamylans best film and he has made nothing like it since, and i doubt he will.
3292;Matter a fact the behind the scenes were very funny and show cased Shamylans artistic directing work when he was young, which was less than impressive, yet fun to behold.
3293;When the dead people were around i thought it was very original having the temperature drop and seeing the cold breath come from young coles mouth.
3294;Another great performance should go to Tony Collette who was great in this and continues to be great in all of her recent films.
3295;so yes this was a revolutionary movie without really even meaning to be, but it changed a whole generation of Psychological horror, and is definitely a classic.
3296;Even if u know the ending which about 90% of the population do, its still a great watch, even more than once.
3297;So keep this in your collection, it's well worth it.
3298;Here are how i rate some of my other favorite movies in this same genre that i highly recommend.
3299;there are many others i can't think of right at the moment, but keep yourself scared with some of these, and start with The Sixth Sense.
3300;everyone knows he is wierd.
3301;with an extremely riveting ending this movie gets two thumbs up.
3302;Watch the movie, then the extra features, then the reviews.
3303;I thought this movie was excellent.
3304;It was well written, well directed, and the actors were exceptional.
3305;I also thought the movie had a purpose.
3306;The surprise ending was also quite deep!
3307;I have to say that this is the best movie I have ever seen in a theatre.
3308;My eyes were glued to the screen and I could pay attention.
3309;The acting was so great and so real that I didn't even think of them as actors.
3310;I'm not one who believes in ghosts in that sense any way but I still think it was a very well written and produced movie.
3311;The Last Airbender is about to be released, and unless it's an unusually good film, it will be renamed with the obvious vulgarity and quickly go to video.
3312;but The Sixth Sense is a classic.
3313;*Forget that The Sixth Sense is a psychological thriller.
3314;It's worth seeing for Shyamalan's subtle direction and Willis's and Osment's beautiful performances.
3315;The latter is one of the great child performances in movie history.
3316;If nothing else, The Sixth Sense is entertaining in the literal meaning of the word .
3317;it holds our attention from start to finish.
3318;richly colored, with extreme detail and sharpness.
3319;He looks perfectly at ease in a church, is able to change clothes, open doors and throw rocks.
3320;And yet the cinematography, the acting, the well.
3321;crafted overall mood would suffice to compensate for the hole.
3322;ridden plot and the offensively obvious symbols (Yes, the color RED has a special significance, yes, clever girl has been paying good attention to Teacher Shyamalan and figured it all out!)
3323;He has to spell it all out while drowning the entire dish in sentimental syrup.
3324;M. Knight Shyamalan was put on the map with this film, as well as Haley Joel Osment.
3325;paced and full of scares.
3326;style , but the real performance was by Osment.
3327;He seems to portray the subtle innocence with such ease.
3328;But even without the great performances, Shyamalan's directing style would have been a sight to see!
3329;A little kid in the movie was pretty good (deserved to be nominated).
3330;That's what you'll be saying when you finish watching The Sixth Sense.
3331;writer of The Sixth Sense (later Unbreakable, Signs) is a genius.
3332;It's much more of a deep, thoughtful psychological thriller.
3333;And I love deep movies.
3334;As the story progresses the last hour is excellent.
3335;Check the bold print above.
3336;It's one movie your first viewing, and a second the second time you see it.
3337;The sound is also beautiful for non.
3338;the Case: The case is unique to say the least.
3339;It's got an outer cover, that you pull out the case from.
3340;The Theatrical trailer is the best of the bunch, it makes out the movie to be a horror movie, and made famous the I see dead people line.
3341;This like most of the other features gives away the ending.
3342;I loved the Bruce Willis + (Vincent Gray Actor?)
3343;segments telling how they prepared for their roles.
3344;I was surprised how many human voices they had put in the movie backround.
3345;The more I listened to this, the creeper the movie actually got, while at the same time it increased the effort I saw being put in.
3346;If you haven't, watch the movie at least twice before viewing this excellent segment.
3347;The Sixth Sense is a superbly executed film that veers between horror and human drama.
3348;There's a lot of atmosphere, with key moments revealing the director's natural talent for dramatic tension and shock.
3349;nitpicking about whether everything in the film adds up in light of the final twist is misconceived: In retrospect, of course, there are holes and inconsistencies all over the place, but the point is that it works at the time, and it works quite brilliantly.
3350;behind the scenes film making interviews with the actors cast and filmaker bios!
3351;The Sixth Sense is one of the greatest movies!
3352;IT has just the best actors and a great director!
3353;IT was just such a great movie!
3354;its just such a wonderful film that no one should go with out seeing!
3355;I think that this movie is very good.
3356;Veteren actor Bruce Willis and rookie Haley Joel Osmont did a very good job acting in this movie.
3357;All the charachters and dead people are very creative.
3358;after American beauty it the second best movie of the year.
3359;The Sixth Sense, in itself, was a brilliant movie that started off putting you into a very realistic world until the extraordinary happens, and you have no choice but to believe it.
3360;when millions of people were watching, and that is true.
3361;the boy, Haley Joel Osment, who played Cole, is phenomenal.
3362;The mother is a divorced, overwhelmed person who is entirely believable.
3363;I liked how his last name, Sear, resembles Seer.
3364;I liked that the dead people really wanted help, and I wanted to know about the dead person during the audition.
3365;tHis is one of the better films of 1999, and one of the most intelligent thriller/horror movies out there, avoiding the cheesy horror cliche's (the hand touching the shoulder, the camera manipulation, the 15.
3366;Recieved it in ontime as was outlined and at a reasonable price.
3367;Will definately recommend to others.
3368;This film has many, many levels one could discuss.
3369;I will choose this to talk about.
3370;i kept seeing the hints throughout the film that let me know for sure that the film's startling revelation was so.
3371;Is there such a thing as a perfect movie?
3372;With the help of a very unique child psychologist named Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis), however, Cole is finally able to face his fears and begin to move on with his life.
3373;for everyone else, though, Sixth Sense is almost a clinic in how to make a movie that will keep the audience engaging in nearly every way possible.
3374;It is the kind of film that one cannot say too much about or risk major spoilers, but suffice it to say that it is filled with mystery, layer upon layer of plots, terrific acting, suspense, and a jaw.
3375;dropping finale that will have you rebooting the whole experience again very soon!
3376;Though perhaps not by a humongous margin (as Signs is excellent in its own right), Sixth Sense is the hallmark film from director M. Night Shyamalan, as it is the perfect showcase for the type of movies he enjoyed making.
3377;overall, this film is easily in my Top Ten Films of All.
3378;It is an absolute masterpiece in every sense of the word.
3379;The Sixth Sense is a mildly entertaining movie, though not as much as the hype led it up to be.
3380;Haley Joel Osment gives a great peformance as Cole Sear, a young boy who can see ghosts.
3381;He is better than most adult actors, despite his age, and delivers a phenomenal performance in this movie.
3382;Bruce Willis, though not at his strongest, was also good.
3383;One thing that really caught the eye was the screenplay: It was imaginative and eventful, and had many interesting twists to it.
3384;It was a pretty long time ago, but this is still the movie that keeps me up at night, right after the movie ended and I'd walked out of the theater, I'd decided I was a true fan of M. Night Shyamalan.
