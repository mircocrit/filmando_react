1;if you are new to Kurosawa films, you might include viewing the excellent Commentary on this wonderful classic.
2;Then, will you get a great insight into the complete work on this film, the setting with such attention to detail, the framing in shots, the story, the colorful characters, etc. ikuru (To Live), a lengthy 50's film, is dramatic, sad, humorous and rewarding.
3;This is not an intimate love affair, but from her, he derives an inspiration he becomes passionate about and returns to work to devote his last days on a memorable mission.
4;Yet this movie it touched me, touched me right here *put's hand to heart*.
5;While you can't really call one movie the greatest movie of all time, i'm going out on a limb here, this is one of the top 10 best ever.
6;Within that simply outline,however, lies one of the finest examples of film making and acting.
7;The Japanese seem to love a sense of poignancy and nostalgia in their art, and this film is absolutely the best example, also, of that love.
8;See this film if you want to see how a movie should be made!
9;The material is certainly moving, but the movie is stilted and static, the performance of the main actor is of one note, and the dialogue explains often what is obvious to the viewer.
10;Soaked in the tragedy of loss yet uplifting in the promise of self.
11;"empowerment
12;set sadness that permeates each scene, `Ikiru' knows the message it is trying to portray, and director Akira Kurosawa understands how best to relay the message to the audience.
13;Up until this point in his life he has lived like a shell of a man, working to provide for his son and his daughter.
14;Watanabe needs something to believe in, to push him and make him feel accomplished.
15;`Ikiru' is a beautifully poignant life lesson for us all.
16;It's very important that we learn to live our lives to the full while we have the chance.
17;As the saying goes, `you only live once' and whether or not we think it's for the best, restricting ourselves of happiness is detrimental to our life as well as those around us.
18;kurosawa's masterpiece is essential viewing for any cinephile like myself.
19;It's strength lies in the way the story is told, and Kurosawa knew how to tell this story perfectly.
20;The happiness he expresses while out to dinner for the first time with the young woman who has ignited his fire is one of the single most rewarding moments in my movie viewing history!
21;The topic in question here is Akira Kurosawa .
22;Show me those puppy dog eyes!
23;There is simply no way that the viewer can relate to the revelatory happiness of the main character through the third.
24;loved """"lesser"""" Kurosawa is even more evident in the fact that other, greatly superior dramatic directors like Yasujiro Ozu were making fantastic films like Early Summer (1951) and Tokyo Story (1953) ."""
25;great acting, storyline, and character development with believable, realistic performances.
26;between Ozu's films mentioned above.
27;This film is a sensitive yet robust masterpiece which fulfils the true function of Art.
28;to reflect the mystery of Life and Living back to You.
29;we are mortal beings whose life will end at a certain point in time.
30;Given this usually supressed knowledge, we have to ask ourselves: Are we living a life worth living, regardless of what happens after death?Only you can answer that question!
31;This is one of Kurosawa Akira's more important films.
32;For their part, his family is primarily concerned about transfer of economic and family authority.
33;Utlimately, Watanabe decides to be the ultimate virtuous civil servant and work on a project for children which are themselves one of the iconic goods of Japan.
34;Watanabe adopts a neighborhood petition for a small park and launches a personal crusade to see it built.
35;the production values of this films are excellent.
36;The acting by Watanabe and Kurosawa's troup is superb.
37;This is a humble film with the soul of an angel.
38;This film, in its quiet way, asks us to ponder what makes life meaningful.
39;He is played by Takashi Shimura in one of the finest understated performances ever committed to film.
40;"Likely, Kurosawa chose to film in black and white to reflect the starkness of the protagonist's last days
41;it is the mark of Kurosawa's genius how the story and the character sneak up on us.
42;He learns of his illness in a well.
43;known opening scene that combines pathos with cruel irony, and before we know it, we start to care about this little man who life treads so callously underfoot.
44;This film has layers and subtlety and visual poetry presented with understatement, finesse and restraint: a wonderful combination that shows the deepest respect for the intelligence of the audience.
45;the moral turning point in the story is reached when Mr Watanabe determines to accomplish one worthwhile achievement before his life ends.
46;This turn of events is one of the most touching acts of redemption in all of cinema.
47;i have watched hundreds of films since Ikiru, but there are scenes from this film that have burned themselves into my heart and are as clear today as the moment I first saw them.
48;The famous scene at the end is one of the most dignified and gracious artistic statements ever filmed, yet it is a scene of wounding simplicity: a perfect epitaph to a cinematic elegy.
49;kurosawa was one of the greatest of all filmmakers and this was his best and most personal film.
50;You need patience, introspection and empathy to appreciate this gentle masterpiece, but if you are the kind of person who is moved by pity, tenderness, humility and grace, then I envy you your first viewing of this ode to the human spirit.
51;Incredibly gentle, touching affirmation of life.
52;What I mean is, this rings true and loud to real life.
53;well, needless to say, this old boy was truly moved.
54;An old man, 25 years a do.
55;But then he hits upon his scheme for doing something worthwhile.
56;Takashi Shimura does an outstanding job in playing our lead character.
57;This masterpiece is moving and burning with feeling.
58;A video of this caliber of artistic workmanship is a classic to be viewed by everyone.
59;It made me think about how to live my own life and it will do the same for you.
60;Simply put, this film belongs in your library.
61;What makes Ikiru special?The comibnation of craft and content.
62;The movie is exceptionally made.
63;The lighting, the compositions, and the editing all do what they are meant to: come together to advance and develop the story.
64;They do so in a way that is definitely stylish, but unlike so many modern filmmakers, they style serves the story, not the other way around.
65;Kurosawa's camera complements, comments upon, and enhances what it captures.
66;But any story worth telling is worth telling in its own time, and the pacing is dead on for the content.
67;He's unloved by his minions, unappreciated by his family, and unnoticed by life.
68;Though often grueling, it's ultimately a triumphant movie, and not in that false, schmaltzy and sentimental way that most contemporary movies deliver.
69;If you are at all interested in the history of film, or what goes into good filmmaking, or even if you just love a good story well told, you should look into this movie.
70;One of the great directors of his century explores the profound impact an ordinary person can have on his community and within himself, actually making himself extraordinary, through his efforts in life upon learning he has cancer.
71;One of my favorite Kurosawa films.
72;A Japanese language subtitled film and morality tale replete with very interesting cultural features.
73;The characters are alternately funny and moving.
74;Ikiru (to live)This is an extremely passionate film that is small in scope but enormous in heart.
75;It beautifully explores this question without being haughty or pretentious.
76;It's definitely not his most visually impressive or action packed work, but perhaps it's his most personal.
77;That stark realization comes crashing down on this main character, played with subtle precision by Takashi Shimura.
78;He realizes how little he has done with his time here on earth.
79;this story is a strong reminder that everyone should be able to relate to.
80;Such a moving tale, highly recommended.
81;Few films truely touch the heart with both sadness and redemption.
82;The great team of Kurasawa and Shimura accomplish this with a touching storyline, creative cinematography and sound management, and outstanding acting.
83;Yes, the film will no doubt bring the strongest person to tears.
84;I should start by saying that I think Ikiru is the best movie I've ever seen, but I'll try to address some of the negatives.
85;the story is absolutely compelling, and the intricate subtleties of Kurosawa's direction make this film very powerful, especially in the second half of the film, where Watanabe's (the protagonist) coworkers discuss his final few months at his wake.
86;Takashi Shimura gives a performance that is stand out.
87;But this gives a lot of people trouble).
88;It is a gentle story with subtle nuances, and often, the meaning is conveyed more in facial expressions and quiet moments than in anything said or done.
89;Many feel this to be Kurosawa's best work, and to know that this terrible transfer is the best it can ever get, that's sad.
90;Specifically, the vertical lines noted in previous reviews are definitely there, and definitely problematic.
91;I really do think it's the best movie I've ever seen.
92;I agree with all the other reviews which have discussed """"Ikiru"""" in terms of its message for the individual: live your life with meaning and purpose, take pleasure in helping others, cherish and nurture children."""
93;as the commentary by Stephen Prince makes clear, one of the main points behind Kurosawa's work was a head.
94;"This idea is also one of the prime motivators behind the work of other Japanese artists from humanists like Hayao Miyazaki (""Spirited Away"", ""Princess Mononoke"") to the lunatic right as exemplified by Mishima."
95;a number of people have complained about the length of the second half of the movie, but (as Prince's commentary again makes clear), the flashbacks are important to establish a stronger sense of Watanabe's co. workers as characters both to illustrate their gradual understanding of the meaning of Watanabe's life but also to highlight their inability to really follow his example.
96;"one can also see this thread in Kurosawa's later movies including his period pieces such as ""Seven Samurai"" and ""Kagemusha"": in both of these films, the ordinary folks and the high and mighty are also found wanting as groups."
97;But, and Kurosawa makes this point in each of his movies, the efforts of such individuals are the true definition of nobility of spirit, and it is this message which provides the power behind all of his works.
98;this is a wonderful piece of movie making.
99;It is humanism at its most trenchant and finest.
100;You must see this film, it is one of the best movies of all time.
101;Many reviews gave great and glowing reviews of this movie, I will second them.
102;I found the Criterion version had outstanding subtitles and will definitely look into Criterion versions of other foreign movies.
103;The subtitles made a large difference to the enjoyment of this movie (along with the cleaned up film).
104;I am a huge classic, foreign film buff and I love the films of Kurosawa.
105;this is a quiet, reflective film.
106;Shimura gives one of the best leading performances I have EVER seen.
107;He expresses so much with merely a look.
108;Also, Kurosawa's direction is masterful.
109;what is so moving about this film are all of the personal relationships and people who's lives he touches in these last few months.
110;this is a reflective film, one that is poignant and touching, quiet and thoughtful.
111;There are wonderful performances throughout.
112;Criterion has also done a wonderful job of the subtitles and updated translation.
113;IKIRU is a work of unparalleled maturity, where Kurosawa takes the time to tell a story in a completely unapologetic and deliberate way.
114;This will confront you in a way no other film will, reaching the deep.
115;It is overwhelmingly sad, and yet it is inspiring and heartfelt.
116;IKIRU is Akira Kurosawa's most deeply moving, most human, and most timeless film.
117;And so Watanabe begins a personal journey that will become his legacy.
118;Along the way, he will experience things he's never experienced, enjoy things he's never enjoyed, and do things thought to be impossible.
119;Some of us reach a time in life when we question the direction our lives have taken, and this film boldly explores that difficult subject.
120;"IKIRU (meaning ""to live"") deserves its rightful place among Akira Kurosawa's numerous classics."
121;The power of its story shows us that no matter when we reach that point of self.
122;A story about life, and how it can be wasted, this is one of the most vivid films I have ever viewed, and it really hits home to me.
123;If you want a film that will really challenge you, and how you have been spending your life, pick this one up today.
124;technically, the film is a masterpiece.
125;as much as I love his samurai epics, this may well be my very favorite Kurosawa film, and I believe it has really been overlooked.
126;His relationship with his co. workers is practically non.
127;existent, and one of them even gives him the nickname The Mummy.
128;the film's greatest strengths lay in Shimura's tender performance and its powerful message that life is too short and precious to waste away doing nothing and that one person.
129;can make a positive difference in a seemingly uncaring world.
130;Ikiru is a call to action that is more moving and powerful than similar Hollywood fare such as Dead Poets Society because it does not concern a group of spotty.
131;It commands the audience to take action to make a difference in the world, and sums up Plato's ethos the unexamined life is not worth living.
132;The film is also innovative in that its last 45 minutes occur at Watanabe's funeral, as drunken bureaucrats.
133;in a moment of clarity.
134;present day Japan (1952), the characters talk like everyday human beings, as opposed to dramatic ancient warriors.
135;While Kurosawa's editor could have cut some scenes out, the film's simple message is powerful and surprisingly uplifting considering that you spend 105 minutes watching a dying man, and the next 38 minutes at his funeral.
136;Ikiru is a simple, quiet, powerful film that will cause you to examine or re.
137;It is more in line with the genre of retrospective life films in the vein of Orson Welles' Citizen Kane or Ingmar Bergman's Wild Strawberries, in that we drop in the on the life of an ordinary man.
138;This is a great film, and Shimura (a veteran of the Godzilla films I loved in my youth, as well a Kurosawa regular film player) gives a great performance.
139;Like Rashomon, which preceded it in the Kurosawa canon, Ikiru deals with perspective, but not the perspective of many on one event, but the perspective of many on many things: life, a man, a park, accomplishment.
140;It is, in that way, something like Rashomon 2.
141;It is one of the many reasons this is such a great film.
142;Another is that while the first two thirds of the film, while Watanabe lives, is great, there have been Hollywood films that come close to it.
143;This daring and depth is what soars Ikiru past lesser films.
144;Watanabe's victory is small, and temporal.
145;It is also the greatest artistic indictment of bureaucracies ever made, and not just of Post.
146;We see this most eloquently in the scenes of Watanabe skipping work, for the office work comes to a halt and the mountain of paperwork continues to bloat.
147;the unforgettable last frame . . . even more than the noted swing scene, is, as it should be, the real climax of what turns out to be a most profoundly moving tale. . . The last frame of Ikiru says it ALL .
148;in film, and more importantly, in life.
149;She has taken a rather boring and meaningless job, but professes to enjoy it.
150;soon the relationship, like his fling with the mizu shobai world, proves unrewarding.
151;Watanabe returns to his job after two weeks absence.
152;takashi Shimura gives an eloquent performance as Watanabe.
153;This simple black and white statement possesses a quiet intensity that places Ikiru in the top rank of films from a great and prolific director.
154;For a movie that's nearly sixty years old, it's stunning to see how little has changed in the world of bureaucracy.
155;That said, Ikiru is a timeless classic.
156;"The title translates as ""to live"" in English, and this film explores what that truly means, in great depth."
157;brilliant, understated acting really drive home the point of making a difference in the world, and not wasting the gift of life.
158;one of the best films I've ever seen!
159;But ultimately this film will burn brightly in the viewer's mind.
160;two years after becoming world famous for Rashomon, Kurosawa released this thematic sequal .
161;a meditation on truth and meaning in the modern world.
162;It, along with Ozu's Tokyo Story, are the most moving films I've ever seen.
163;what makes Kurosawa so great here?
164;This is masterful filmaking .
165;And the commentary track is done by the always entertaining Stephen Prince.
166;Then it becomes the best film you HAVE ever seen.
167;I do however appreciate a good product, and 'Ikiru' is so much better then just good that it even transcends the term great.
168;'Ikiru' is about living and creating, and it succeeds in a such a beautiful, perfect way that it's nearly impossible not to emulate it in your own life.
169;Others have compared Ikiru to It's A Wonderful Life.
170;This is a reasonable comparison, but Ikiru is more philosophical and abstract.
171;But if you want to see a touching and emotional story about the struggles of an honest man, look no further.
172;known for his samurai films (YOJIMBO, SEVEN SAMURAI, as a couple of examples), IKIRU takes a detour from that theme and, for me, was one of the finest films he made.
173;Watanabe (Takashi Shimura) is a public servant and has worked for the government for thirty years.
174;Ultimately, Watanabe's new approach to the world and what his part is on the earth manages to touch everyone around him (for good or worse).
175;iKIRU shows a beautifully poignant side of Kurosawa, as a storyteller.
176;The beautiful cinematography in this story particularly well.
177;showcases Watanabe's physical deterioration in the face of his illness.
178;His eyes speak volumes about his physical pain, and yet he finds new.
179;found strength to cling on to life in the wake of his last breaths in this world.
180;This feeling of urgency is contrasted by moments of newly realized joy and gratitude.
181;This is a beautifully made film and really is timeless.
182;It is truly a fine depiction of the human condition and the fragility of the life with which we have been given.
183;worth of those who sacrificed their lives in meaningless jobs.
184;A particularly effective sequence early in the film involves the local bureau's reaction to a proposal to build a park with each department representative claiming that its hands are tied and passing the buck to another department in ceaseless red tape.
185;"Takashi Shimura, a Kurosawa regular who would gain greater renown as the leader of ""The Seven Samurai"" two years later, is deeply affecting as Watanabe."
186;The last shot of him on the swing, magically framed by a jungle gym in a light snowfall as he sings his theme, is an utterly transcendent moment.
187;on one hand, she fully embodies the free, uninhibited spirit of her downscale character, and yet, she can go overboard with her ebullience during key moments.
188;"an informative commentary track provided by Stephen Prince, author of ""The Warrior's Camera: The Cinema of Akira Kurosawa"", as well as two documentaries."
189;"minute film, ""A Message from Akira Kurosawa"", about Kurosawa's late."

191;"minute film, which focuses exclusively on ""Ikiru"" and has a rare interview with Shimura."
192;"There are many wonderful reviews on this site about why the film ""Ikiru"" is so great."
193;And many are beautifully written.
194;"I have seen many films in my life, yet ""Ikiru"" stands head and shoulders above any I have ever seen."
195;One of the reviewers [BARRY C. CHOW] gave a very good and poignant review of this film.
196;i know that writing that this is the greatest film of all.
197;time is a bold statement.
198;So let me clarify it a bit more: It is my favorite film of all.
199;This is a quiet and simple film.
200;"maybe at one time in his life he had dreams of better things
201;Yes, one can belong to a bureaucratic machine"
202;Moreover, we can also live a life outside of our jobs.
203;For our humble protagonist realizes that his life must have a meaning.
204;Alienated from his son, he sets about to correct in what little time he has remaining to make some sort of contribution to society.
205;and this contribution comes in the way of a childrens park.
206;Simple and yet all so poignant.
207;This is not only Kurosawa's greatest film, but the greatest film ever.
208;This film is a simple reminder to those of us who are willing to take the time to see what Kurosawa is attempting to show us: That life is short.
209;And that what we do with our lives matters.
210;And Takashi Shimura's character does succeed in giving some meaning to his short life and existence.
211;I first watched this film in 1977, and I never tire of viewing it again and again.
212;This is a heartfelt film, and Takashi Shimura [His greatest role] plays his part in the film with such outstanding humility, that we the viewer come to empathize with him.
213;"I have never forgotten the part where he sings, both in the drinking establishment, and at the end of the film
214;This film puts what's really important in life into perspective.
215;And more importantly, live your life as if each day were the last.
216;This is an uplifting, carefully crafted movie by a master.
217;The last scene will stay with you forever.
218;After Seven Samurai, this is my favorite Kurosawa film.
219;Delicate and beautiful, Takashi Shimura's Watanabe makes me feel as if I'm watching a wilting, fragile flower, who's petals are gradually dropping away in slow.
220;And if you really watch Ikiru, if you open your mind and heart, you will understand what everyone who left a review here is talking about.
221;That is what this film is about, and it is deep enough, if you are open to it, to reach your very soul.
222;matched storytelling convention that serves Ikiru brilliantly.
223;There are good, very good, and even great movies.
224;But among them there are just a few that go beyond great.
225;The film of rare humanity, profoundly moving and often funny """"Ikiru"""" tells the story of a dying man's last crusade that turned out to be his triumph, the best thing he had ever done in his life"
226;no one can understand why this park is so important to him.
227;The answer is very simple .
228;His family and co. workers don't even know how ill he is what makes some scenes even more powerful and poignant.
229;the film has many quiet but compelling moments like these.
230;Ikiru is about a dying man, too but how hopeful and life affirming it is.
231;What he decides to do is finally to do SOMETHING.
232;It is wonderful to finally see what he ends up doing.
233;It is probably Akira Kurosawa's best film ever even though I personally like 7 samurai better.
234;It may take a while to get started but eventually what you have is a guy who has never done a thing in his life facing his last days with a wonderful dignity.
235;I wish I could give this movie more than just 5 stars!One of the greatest features of all time.
236;This film clearly shows that Akira Kurosawa was more than just a director of epic samurai pictures.
237;He could also direct powerful dramas as well.
238;takashi Shimura, as the dying bureaucrat Watanabe, gives one of the greatest performances in motion picture history!
239;A true testament to Shimura's acting ability.
240;It can make you angry (The petty politicians in this feature don't give a damm about anything and yet take credit for all of the good that's been done), and most of all, it is very inspiring.
241;It definitely makes a statement against bureaucracy.
242;I found it tastefully done and very reflective of the era in which it was filmed and covered.
243;takashi Shimura was excellent and very reflective and intuitive with his treatment of the main character.
244;It truly is an excellent film.
245;Thanks to Criterion for making this masterpiece available.
246;Kurosawa's retelling of Tolstoy's The Death of Ivan Ilyich is beautiful on every level.
247;No other filmmaker has or had the talent to frame every shot perfectly, while keeping his subject matter deeply human.
248;But as with any tale of enlightenment, of those who gain an inner clarity about themselves, and who live their lives guided by that clarity, in truth and goodness, the majority do not understand.
249;A deeply saddening, but equally uplifting film.
250;"Akira Kurosawa is, without a doubt, one of cinema's most revered directors, best known for his samurai epics such as ""Seven Samurai"" (which I highly, HIGHLY recommend) and ""Throne of Blood"" (a Japanese version of Shakespeare's immortal play ""Macbeth"", which I have, regrettably, not yet seen)."
251;this is a simple story about a simple man facing utter despair.
252;the plot is simple enough: Kanji Watanabe is a middle.
253;The second half of the film shows Kanji's funeral, and the people attending discuss his last days and give their perspective of his final acts.
254;The film possesses a gentle, heart.
255;"breaking beauty that makes us look into our own hearts and ask: ""Have we made something of our lives?"
256;Its simple, poetic beauty is what gives it such power.
257;"the scene near the end where we see Kanji on the swings in the snow singing the haunting song ""Life is Brief"", just before his death, brings out such pure emotion and raw power."
258;this is a film for the ages.
259;do yourself a favor, and see this film.
260;The last day of a simple man who is dying of cancer , makes for him a real transformation in the values who held him .
261;When he decides to give a surprise to his own daughter to tell her about his illness she captures in a powerful statement where she states she wants he dies as soon as possible .
262;one of the supreme masterpieces of all the cinema story .
263;Many people consider this is the most expressive and poignant work of Kurosawa .
264;i do not agree but undoubtly it is a real gem .
265;All of the truly great film directors have that one film they made during their career that is considered their masterpiece.
266;Akira Kurosawa is certainly among the best directors in the history of film making.
267;What seems to set him apart from many directors is that it seems there are so many of his movies he has made that can be considered his masterpiece.
268;"Seven Samurai, ""Ran"", ""Rashomon"" as well as others he has directed can all easily be considered a masterpiece."
269;They are all classic movies.
270;"If there was a film by him that could be considered Kurosawa's masterpiece you could make a strong case for ""Ikiru""."
271;"It may not be of the grandeur as say ""Ran"" or ""Seven Samurai"" with battle scenes and action but this is still a powerful film with subtle meaning behind it."
272;Watanabe is a bureaucrat who holds the title of section chief of public affairs.
273;He wants one chance to do something that has meaning to it and give him a purpose to live what time he has left.
274;It all comes to a head when one day he comes home with a young girl the family thinks Watanabe is having an affair with.
275;Again the family knows nothing of this and it leads to a confrontation between Watanabe and his son.
276;what takes place from that point is interesting in the art of story telling.
277;As you watch the film you know it is going to happen.
278;all the way around this is an outstanding movie.
279;Beautifully directed and filmed as well as co. written by Kurosawa this truly is one of the greatest movies ever made.
280;Ikiru on the other hand is a contemporary film, well at least it was when it was made back in 1952.
281;But the thing with this story is it is timeless.
282;It is a film about how mankind lives their life as well as how they depart it and bring meaning to it.
283;There are moments here and there that are lighthearted and can bring a smile and maybe even a laugh.
284;The main purpose to this film is to get the viewer to look at life.
285;of course while praising Kurosawa for his excellent work in making this film there is one other person who deserves praise as well for making this movie outstanding.
286;"There is no doubt that ""Ikiru"" is Takashi Shimura's masterpiece as an actor."
287;His performance as Watanabe may well be the greatest performance any actor have ever given in cinema history.
288;It is certainly a memorable one.
289;Shimura takes on the roll of a man with the weight of the world on his shoulders.
290;Shimura gives us a performance that makes you feel sympathy for Watanabe.
291;He still keeps his feelings away from the rest of the world but once the viewer gets to see inside this man and the turmoil he is going through you develop that sympathy for him and find you care deeply for him and what will happen next.
292;This is one powerful performance in a very subtle way.
293;"I love action movies as much as the next person but I love movies like ""Ikiru"" as much if not more."
294;I love a good movie that makes you look inward.
295;That challenges your thoughts and beliefs and shows the complexities of life.
296;"Movies like ""Ikiru"" show that the spoken word can provide more action then a dozen shoot 'em up explosive scenes from the best action movie could ever show."
297;That is how Kurosawa made it so the viewer can take in everything that is going on in the story.
298;The message in this film is important for all to see.
299;"Ikiru is an emotionally potent, ultimately devastating picture that prove that ""cinematic art"" isn't an oxymoron."
300;The acting, cinematography, pacing, thematic elements, script, dialogue, intelligence, emotional pitch, and humor in the film are all near.
301;"perfect
302;While only loosely adapting from Dostoyevsky's source novel, AK perfectly captures the Russian's spirit, that immediately identifiable blend of savage satire and melancholy idealism that ran throughout the author's work (most notably in """"The Idiot"""", not surprisingly another novel AK had previously adapted)."""
303;Along with epilepsy and alcoholism, Dostoyevsky and Kurosawa shared this sensibility, this powerful belief that the world could be a decent place if people would just make the slightest humanitarian effort, combined with a kind of quiet rage when faced with the reality that humanity as a whole simply will not ever make that effort.
304;IKIRU has at its center the profound subject of the human condition approaching death, the invidual's fear of non.
305;existence and the meaning of life.
306;Intense subjects to be sure, but under Akira Kurosawa's masterful direction, the one man's experience of this most human of human conditions is simply told with dignity and a light touch.
307;In many ways the plot of IKIRU parallels with that of one of my favorite Japanese film, CHERRY BLOSSOMS.
308;An elderly man approaches the end of life, with little comfort to find in his past, particularly after his wife has died.
309;On another level, IKIRU presents a scathing satire on the subject of bureaucracy and its stifling effects on creativity and the human spirit.
310;the relationship between the girl and Ikiru is complex and begins to unwind and deteriorate (unlike CHERRY BLOSSOMS.)
311;Nonetheless a spiritual process has been quietly ignited in him.
312;Ikiru takes it even further and becomes an unpretentious 1 man action committee.
313;But one thing this film makes you realise is that a job, is just a job!
314;This film was so heartful and beautiful,it can make any age group realise that life is for living and how correct it was to say that 'only when you know you are going to die do you begin to live'.
315;I recommend this film for everyone, I love Japanese films and this was by far one of the best films.
316;This film is perhaps the most powerful message of Kurosawa's career.
317;and the greatest film of all time.
318;The presentation is structured as ponderous., so that the audience may view Watanabe as though they knew him, and his life is a testament to humanity.
319;with us, and become more aware.
320;Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece (and, yes, there's a bulging lexicon to choose out of there, but nevermind) may be showing its age .
321;when a humble bureaucrat, nearing the end of his career, discovers that he has terminal cancer, he sets out to achieve something meaningful with what remains of his life.
322;His hero is a man of humble means and, accordingly, his final, lasting testament is far from awe.
323;Ikiru is a far more small.
324;affirming films you could hope to find.
325;It was sad, but life affirming at the same time.
326;The two most interesting and somewhat sympathetic characters play brief roles and then are gone without a trace.
327;Though best known for his samurai epics, Kurosawa in 1951 crafted this profoundly moving tale about finding purpose and dignity in the forbidding face of death.
328;Odagiri is marvelous, too, as the bright, attractive young girl who leads him to rediscover the community.
329;Ikiru may be Japanese in provenance, but its appeal is universal.
330;"Some movies tend to mature in my mind and I like them over a period of weeks or even months (took me years to like Amadeus) but I'm afraid that ""IKIRU"" is beautiful from beginning to end."
331;one of the best things of the movie is the fact that it doesn't want to be a tearjerker.
332;"This is better than Kurosawa's ""Seven Samurai"", a movie that I really admire."
333;this is a movie everyone should watch because it would make you want to savour life.
334;movie they actually turned to me with tears streaming down their faces saying it was the greatest movie they had ever seen.
335;it's full of common heros and common villans.
336;You will find yourself somewhere amongst the characters, feeling and thinking as they feel, and perhaps being reformed by what happens in the movie.
337;Note that I recommend you go with subtitles instead of voice over if you don't understand Japanese.
338;Everything in the movie is very vivid to the senses, and your imagination will more than make up for whatever lapse in understanding the dialogue.
339;bOTTOM LINE: The best movie I have ever seen.
340;This is the greatest film ever made.
341;The philosophical struggle for meaning in life, was captured in this film.
342;it is simply one the most human stories of all time.
343;This is a movie that truly can change your life.
344;if you want to change your life, perhaps take a peek into your future, get this movie.
345;provoking movie by the legendary director.
346;The movie will definitely make you think about how you live your life because our time is limited.
347;Kurosawa utilizes powerful techniques as silence to illustrate the main character's thinking and journey.
348;Probably the most moving movie I have ever seen!
349;This being a Kurosawa film it will definitely draw some attention and trust me it is worthy of his direction.
350;this strikes something in his mind, that he needs to start living instead doing the same things everyday.
351;Kanji meets a young girl who he admires because of her youth and joy.
352;Because of her she inspires him to do something big before he dies.
353;He does what he can and lives right down to his very last minute.
354;Even the old black and white picture adds some emotion to the film.
355;The story itself is timeless and is one that may appear to many people in their life.
356;I think what really gives this film that extra something is the acting from Takashi Shimura who made this character very realistic.
357;He had a look on his face for the entire film that showed pain and his age and fear of his future.
358;As I said earlier the films black and white picture added a lot to the films feeling it wanted to give you and when you watch it you'll understand.
359;I saw no flaws in Ikiru and it is definitely a must see especially if you love the work of Takashi Shimura and Akira Kurosawa.
360;but also a human sensitivity that may be more flamboyant and theatrical in style than his Japanese counterpart Yasujiro Ozu, but is no less impressive.
361;He is a true film artist, to be sure.
362;The first half of the film actually made me shed quite a few tears, watching poor Kanji Watanabe first find out he has stomach cancer, and then try to actually have some fun with his life.
363;His attempts to do so are quite touching, even though it does not always work out.
364;Finally, he decides to do something noble for the people he works for, and thus we get to the second half of the film: Mr. Watanabe's wake, in which colleagues reminisce about the noble act he accomplished for a town before he died.
365;It is certainly intriguing structurally, as we see the effects of his death on fellow workers and the townspeople Watanabe helped so greatly.
366;It may be sentimental, but it is always honestly felt, and perhaps you might be much less resistant to Kurosawa's sentimental excesses than I occasionally was.
367;As Watanabe, Takashi Shimura gives an unforgettable performance (esp.
368;that image just goes to show you that Kurosawa was, above all else, a masterly visual artist in his films.
369;Still, IKIRU is a good film that deserves to be seen for its powerful message, if nothing else.
370;This Kurosawa movie is an extraordinary allegory on how man can find meaning in his life by engagement with others, by helping others and joining in positive causes beyond their own immediate concerns.
371;Ikiru is a film that is full of subtlety that builds up the dark atmosphere around Watanabe as he journeys towards his end.
372;These subtle moment are carefully balanced between acting, sound, cinematography, and directing which brings about a brilliant cinematic experience.
373;Ikiru (To Live) is a beautiful film.
374;Before I bought it, I read the sypnosis and I felt that I was able to relate the Watanabe's story.
375;So, I bought this film since I had already seen several of Kurosawa Akira's films and he had quickly become my favorite director (preferred over Johnny Depp, Stanley Kubrick, and Inagaki Hiroshi combined.)
376;Red Beard (Akahige), another Kurosawa film, asks the very same question in a less direct manner, but also focuses on mental evolution, change.
377;I felt that Red Beard is truly Kurosawa's greatest accomplishment.
378;In fact, I believe Red Beard to be the best accomplishment in the history of cinema arts.
379;I think it is best to get them in chronological order, which puts emphasis on Kurosawa as a person.
380;i highly recommend this movie and many other movies Akira Kurosawa has made.
381;The Criterion Collection is a very nice version of the movie to have.
382;(Minus one star because of the poor condition of the print)Ikiru is argueably Kurosawa's masterpiece and the film is one of the true classics of all cinema.
383;A truly moving film that doesn't go for cheap sentiment, but instead touches the soul.
384;Every action, camera move, and edit is brilliantly utilized make the film like a virtual text book in the power of filmmaking.
385;Criterion probably did their best, afterall they achieved beautiful sharpness and good contrast with their transfer.
386;extras: The audio commentary by Prince is one of the best scholarly commentaries around.
387;It is one of the few talks that has truly increased my appreciation for a film by a large degree.
388;The longer documentary provides some rare footage of Kurosawa on the set directing his later day films and some interviews with him.
389;This is an admirable movie with a useful lesson, that we should use our lives constructively to make this world better in whatever way we can.
390;i worked in the management office of a housing project for about 6 years, long ago.
391;That's the kind of civil service job being ridiculed here, I suppose.
392;but still, the lesson is well taken.
393;One day the jig will be up, and you will be back home in Heaven.
394;So do something while you are here.
395;It is an artistic touch that I appreciate.
396;It was a very nice way of getting the message across that the park is a beautiful thing for the neighborhood, without getting mushy about it.
397;my favorite part of this movie is watching the young girl who works in our hero's department.
398;She's full of fun and energy, which this movie badly needs, like a desert needs a soft drink machine.
399;another thing I like about the movie is that our hero's son is a real piece of garbage.
400;It's nice to see that recognized in an intelligent movie like this one.
401;"The film, at its most basic level, is about redemption, living (Ikiru is ""To Live"" in english) and dying, and what matters most to really make a difference in your life, and the lives of others."
402;The film is quiet yet utterly powerful, a basic study of a man trying to find meaning in his last days.
403;But it's so much more than that, and I can only describe the film and its purpose as noble, genuine, warm, moving, and beautiful.
404;And I will remember it forever, as well as all of Ikiru, as a poignant, sad yet triumphant example of the human spirit to really persevere and make a wonderful difference.
405;every once in a while he will say some of those women look like my relatives .
406;Takashi Shimura gives a remarkable performance in Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece Ikiru .
407;A chance encounter with one of the young ladies from his department results in a friendship being struck up .
408;he is attracted to her youthful vigor and enthusiasm, and she is intrigued that the older gentleman she has privately nicknamed The Mummy is actually a kind fellow.
409;Instead the story takes an absolutely sublimely inspired turn.
410;it is an absolutely uplifting experience to see both the path and result of Watanabe's struggles.
411;It's one of the greatest ever made.
412;IKIRU means to_live in japanese and this beautiful movie is one of the best representations ever of what really matters in life.
413;"i recommend to watch this movie and also read Seneca's ""De brevitate vitae""."
414;It is good to watch a good reminder, as this movie is.
415;It's a simple movie that far exceeds the sum of its parts.
416;There are many classic movies, but very few of them have such a timeless and relevant theme.
417;Roger Ebert said that Ikiru might be one of the few movies that makes you rethink how you live your life, and I think he's right.
418;This movie is best viewed as a matinee.
419;i just saw this movie today at a museum in Boston, and it absolutely stunned me.
420;Like I said, make sure you're wide awake and in a patient mood.
421;This one is pretty damn important.
422;This is is probably Kurosawa's greatest film.
423;A man diagnosed with cancer realizes he has never truly lived life.
424;he works at a political office stamping papers.
425;a fine performance for the legendary takshi shimura(seven samurai, rashomon, godzilla), and akira kurosawa's most moving and thought provoking films ever made.
426;it is very meaningful movie.
427;I will say that this could be one of the most traumatizing movies I have ever seen.

431;Takashi Shimura (also in Kurosawa's Rashomon and The Seven Samurai) gives an incredible performance.
432;Keep it and watch it at least once a year.
433;It is no less captivating for me now than it was then.
434;One thing that is rarely mentioned is that the actors apply their craft with genius worthy of the film.
435;Great film, Akira Kurosawa is at his best here.
436;"Just order it and watch it
437;It however has an interesting narrative structure, very keenly observed nuance and boldness that combine to give it an originality that elevates it into a rewarding movie for it's great novelty value in presenting such a story into a film.
438;this is ultimately an uplifting film although very unsentimental in some of the juxtapositions of it's wide cast of characters, and it has a tightly knit well played narrative of social commentaries.
439;It is a film which is interesting in being an expression of view overall as much as anything else, and is a natural companion piece to Kurosawa's later film Red Beard in this regard as to being a philosophical position held i think.
440;This is probably my favorite Kurosawa film.
441;ikiru's quiet emotional impact reminds me of the thematic overtones of Ozu's Tokyo Story borne out of that unifying moral center of ordinary people coming together with extraordinary resolve after the death of an endearing character.
442;When Watanabe learns of his diagnosis he awakens to life.
443;This good bureaucrat's life, once a source for all that is pleasant, sure, measured, controlled, and tranquil in that dead calm way, is suddenly called into question and quietly shunned with an urgency.
444;The film is a record of a life that is awakened, and newly sensitized to other human beings.
445;This generous and benevolent awakening revives connections with people to create a powerful emotional effect of sympathy among the people he encounters along the way.
446;the reconciliatory emotions that come with this awakening is one of empathy and admiration.
447;Watanabe's generosity fills the screen with subtle acts of giving.
448;Kurasawa has a way of lighting up this scene with delight as he records the sheer happiness that this simple move brings to the both of them.
449;that unforgettable final scene on the swing, with Watanabe idly rocking, back and forth, in a city park, with a light snow settling on his hat, his coat, his face, brings out the tranquility of his last days.

453;Whatever the reason, Ikiru touched a chord in my heart.
454;I can see myself as the protagonist.
455;I can also see myself as one of the characters in the honor scene who denigrates all that Watanabe stood for.
456;if you are able to examine yourself, watch this movie.
457;I can see minor lines from the emulsion, but the acting overcomes it.
458;Hardly a melodrama or weepie, this very moving, thoughtful film takes a highly unusal narrative turn about two.
459;thirds of the way, and Kurosawa explores both critical and celebratory views of the hero, Watabanbe's successful efforts to get the park bult.
460;But the final shot, which recalls an earlier beautiful shot of the film, holds out some hope that things will change even while aknowledging that there is little reason to hope that one man's efforts will change anything much.
461;It's a long film, but my wife and I found it extremely engaging.
462;That's the setting Kurosawa ingeniously uses to explore the nature of modern life, the human dilemma, meaning and insignificance.
463;A main character who is clearly Everyman, with whom the audience immediately builds great empathy, is a success factor for this movie.
464;Add continual and realistic plot development, superb acting and strong parallels between Japanese and American society, and you get a winner that you'll remember awhile.
465;All these films have quite a complex structure.
466;It will be appreciated best by those who've realised they're going to die (you'll know what I mean).
467;Watching Ozu's Tokyo Story beforehand will prepare you for the subtle style.
468;The camera shows us several shots in closeup of Shimura's face after he speaks to his doctor, and we see the anguish in his eyes.
469;Watanabe brings the whole thing to a halt when he requests a pianist to play an old song, and sings the words, about young girls who fall in love and how they should enjoy that love for life is short.
470;The melody is haunting, and is Watanabe's theme at several key points in the film.
471;Watanabe is exhilarated by her joyous love of life, her enthusiasm, even her appetite.
472;In his bedroom is a photo of a young, attractive woman, his wife.
473;This is a theme with haunting overtones in Japanese culture.
474;That power, greatness, beauty is transient can teach us how to live more deeply.
475;It's a kind of tomb.
476;Kurosawa shows that all the survivors, even the grief stricken, are motivated by personal considerations.
477;He shows this to be natural and inevitable, while satirising more extreme manifestations of it.
478;There is a social dimension of our actions, as of our inactions.
479;Kurosawa wants viewers of his film to be at that wake too, and reflect on what Watanabe's life and death meant.
480;Watanabe is happy, not because of the playground, not because of the song.
481;He has found something vital.
482;What makes Ikiru an important film is that viewers who watch it can understand just what he has found.
483;I can't but than agree it might well be the most compelling film by Kurosawa.
484;My introduction to this movie occurred at a particularly poignant moment in my own life, so I believe it resonated deeper than I could have foreseen.
485;The main character Watanabe, upon finding out he will be dying of stomach cancer (in a vague, clearly paternalistic way as far as the medical system is concerned), puts his life into perspective and struggles with how to proceed during his final days.
486;ending cycle that besieges all living creatures"
487;The meaning of life is truly that it goes on, and you can in effect conquer death by understanding what lies behind life.
488;And that is something Kurosawa did beautifully in this film.
489;In a poingnant series of flashbacks to his earlier life, we see a number of scenes that tell us of the two relationships in his life.
490;We sense the sudden loss of his wife but it is the marvelously created scenes of his fading relationship with his son that touches us the deepest.
491;The answer comes from a young lady who works at his office and is wonderfully played by an actress who, I'm sorry to say, was not identified (in English) on the cast and credits.
492;Wantanabe realizes that he still has time to do something with his life and goes about trying to do just that.
493;As a matter of fact, the way the director moves about in time allows us to piece the puzzle together retrospectively.
494;the director, Akira Kurosawa, has created another masterpiece of the human spirit.
495;The acting is very well done.
496;this is a film worth seeing.

506;this film is gripping in that it relates to the somewhat disillusionment and hope that many Japanese experienced after World War II.
507;The main theme of the film deals with full disclosure or in simple terms, the truth.
508;director Akiru Kurosawa was one of the most legendary directors in Japanese film history, and the accompanying screenplay by Kurosawa, Shinobu Hashimoto and Hideo Oguni is the most relevant aspect of the film.
509;The cinematography is impeccable and reveals the emotions and actions of the actors.
510;is quiet haunting, but Kurosawa manages to allude to the viewer that a little bit of humor in the midst of death offers a sense of realism to the conscience.
511;no doubt, the film is a great achievement and should be viewed by film buffs or anyone interested in humanistic films without being too sentimental.

543;IKIRU is one of Kurosawa's most unique and moving films.

559;Ikiru, to my mind, may be the greatest film in the canon of one of the cinema's greatest directors.
560;It is one of the most spiritually engaging films I have ever seen, and one that reveals new insights each time I watch it.

566;"this movie also expertly examines some of the ""meanings of life"" common in contemporary culture."
567;"According to some existentialists, the film tells us that `life' is meaningless when everything is said and done
568;It is true that Watanabe needs to look more deeply into his life and disregard the ways others perceive his actions.
569;Dostoevky best expressed his philosophy of life in his last and greatest book, The Brothers Karamazov.
570;He also considered Ikiru to be most Dostoevskyan of all his films.
571;He awakens to the realization that his actions can make a difference, because each human life intersects with every other.
572;In the final analysis, I think Studs is right.
573;The film is a beautiful and insightful reminder that none of us are truly alone if we recognize our responsibility to others who share the world with us.
574;This is Kurosawa's answer to It's a wonderful life .
575;Ikiru employs a very creative narrative style (and this was in the 50s!)
576;the deliberate pacing evokes a sense that the story is occurring in real.
577;His thoughts, his emotions, his fears unfold before us peripherally.
578;It's the universal story of simple lives .
579;this one is a must for your collections.
580;This is most probably the greatest film about life and what it means to live.
581;The film is expertly plotted: During the first half we see Watanabe before his death, coping with his illness, dealing with his relationship to his son and daughter.
582;In my humble opinion this is as perfect a movie as one can get.
583;Of all of Kurosawa's achievements in film, this movie is his greatest because he approaches a big subject (life and it's meanings) and succeeds in every valued aspect of film making (story, music, visual, editing).
584;And through it's simplicity the film achieves a complex portrait of the life of a dying man.
585;What should a man aspire to and what can he truly achieve?
586;This film approaches those questions and, in some instances, answers them.
587;subtle and poignant, this is one of the most beautiful movies ever made.
588;I see myself in the lead character, slowly becoming a mindless mummy .
589;It examines a person's reaction to imminent death, what a person holds on to (perhaps takes with him/her).
590;If you see one Kurosawa film, see this one.
591;Michael Crichton, one of the greatest writers of the last 30 years, said Ikiru """"to live"""" would be his pick on a desert island in a interview before he died of terminal cancer(ironically the same as the """"hero"""" in story)."""
592;the hero's rendition of the Gondola no uta(song) is worth the price.
593;The beauty of the movie is the director, Kurosawa, causes you to pause for a moment and think.
594;"Akira Kurosawa's ""Ikiru"" is a reflective and personal story that offers a fascinating contrast to the director's more epic works."
595;It is a timeless tale of the power of the individual to triumph over the mechanizations of an uncaring bureaucracy.
596;After an insightful talk with a young co. worker named Toyo Odagiri (Miki Odagiri), the dying man sets out to accomplish something meaningful with the time he has left.
597;Ikiru is notable for its exploration of social dynamics within a structured society but is more memorable for its exploration of Watanabe's humanity.
598;Odagiri is also excellent in a crucial role and leaves one of the more lasting impressions amongst the female characters that have populated Kurosawa's works.
599;"Although small in scope, ""Ikiru"" is nonetheless an emotionally satisfying and insightful work from the famed director."
600;"Ikiru which means ""To Live"" is one of Akira Kurosawa's most beloved films."
601;I also found it very touching.
602;i found the film to be very impressive in many aspects.
603;Both as a period Japansese film and as one with nice scenery including a panchinko parlor.
604;the first is part of a series and is about the film and includes interviews with the filmmakers including Kurosawa.
605;"the other is ""A Message from Akira Kurosawa"" the documentary is about Kurosawa himself and includes many interviews with him on the sets of many of his films."
606;so my recommendation is to stick with the Criterion version.
607;It is worth the price.
608;This revelation makes him start reviewing his life, and he concludes he has done nothing worthwhile.
609;And so Watanabe finds his own reason to go on through his final days, a reason centered around doing genuine good, regardless of the chance of reward.
610;This is a very deep film, filled with themes of existentialism that movies rarely tackle.
611;It asks the biggest questions that can be asked of a life.
612;Takashi Shimura's performance as Watanabe is one of the greatest of cinema.
613;other cast members are also outstanding, especially Miki Odagiri as a young female coworker.
614;"On a sort of date with Watanabe she confides that she has humorous names for everyone in the department based on how they behave, and that his is ""The Mummy."""
615;composed samurai films also could direct contemporary dramas that look as effortless as this.
616;(Often with Kane the reverse is true.)
617;Also, Kurosawa manages to tell his story without flashy technique or set pieces.
618;"ikiru also strangely foreshadows the life of a real Japanese hero of the second part of the 20th century, Yutaka Katayama (or ""Mr. K,"" as he was called by many)."
619;(His far less aggressive and successful counterpart on the east coast was more highly regarded by the Japanese bosses.)
620;minute feature about making Ikiru, with cast and crew interviews.
621;Both docs are excellent and you will watch Ikiru with more intelligence after you see them.
622;The print, while scratched and battered a bit with age, is as good as we're likely to see.
623;Because that subject is in fact very modern and universal, and you will quickly be swept away by the relevance of the story.
624;"Ikiru is the very dictionary definition of the term ""timeless classic."""
625;I had seen this movie awhile back, and I loved the story.
626;Japanese films even today take much longer developing the characters and the story line.
627;Japanese films give you your money's worth whereas American films.
628;Will he forsake his job and bury himself in hedonism, spending all his money on parties and fun with his remaining time?
629;"The first part is told showing Kanji go about his days and is told from his perspective
630;You slowly see the complete story of Kanji's life and what he has done as it is revealed by his friends, and that revelation has the power to lift your soul.
631;And can you do it with your dignity and humanity intact?Yes, you can.
632;This film obviously lets you know what """"Live"""" is."""
633;I would love to see this updated, but this is a classic that stands alone.
634;he used what time he had left to make the last moments of his life greater than the last 30 years, and transformed those around him as a result once he found his own purpose.
635;It is a beautiful movie, and while Americans tend to harp on how great Citizen Kane and Gone With the Wind are, they should see this and then get back to us.
636;To me this ia greater film than both of those.
637;I believe this was Kusawara's best work.
638;He goes to a bar and tells his troubles to a random patron.
639;They strike up a brief friendship and he tries to help Watanabe enjoy himself in sampling a little of the city's night life.
640;He grasps at her company.
641;He turns to her one last time, and finally finds a purpose to his life.
642;with Ikiru, director Akira Kurosawa tells us to seize the day, to live now because we might die tomorrow.
643;"The acting is passionate, the structure is impecable and original, and Kurosawa keeps the cinematography simple, as befits a story about an ordinary man
644;I'll spare you other stories like this, but I have many.
645;Ikiru is a prime example of Akira Kurosawa's personal directorial motive, which seems to drive much of his work.
646;In Ikiru, we are placed at the precipice of a life.
647;altering experience, a cataclysmic event that will unalterably change the course of Watanabe(the main protagonist)'s life in the film.
648;In this way, I see Watanabe as the spiritual embodiment of Kurosawa himself, and the film as a sort of personal reflection on the matter of a """"second chance"""" at life, reminiscent of Kurosawa's own earlier experiences in the Canto earthquake, World War II, as well as his literary exposure to Dostoevsky and Shakespeare, who certainly have much to say about life after near."""
649;"I see Kurosawa as the type of person to pay mind to the notion of resurrection and what a ""reborn life"" can entail for a person after he's survived the edge of it for himself."
650;We see this especially when Watanabe, early in the film, cherishes memories of his son, (memory, as we will see, figures greatly into what things we put our value into) and that up until that point, everything he did in his life was for the sake of his young boy.
651;a prosperous and grateful son who will always remember how hard his father worked to provide for him a good and comfortable life.
652;(On an ancillary note, I found it interesting when Watanabe discussed this with a young female worker.
653;It brought to my mind the idea of 'blind love' and how this can be the most difficult type of love of all since it often goes unseen.
654;"itself), and determine a new ""ends"" in life, much in the spiritual vein of King Lear."
655;to have something to be remembered by, which becomes embodied in the form of the new park that he builds.
656;"Watanabe finally managed his, and it serves as a tribute to him that we're watching the film in this way, i. e., ""in memory"" of Watanabe, much as we read about important figures through memoirs."
657;"The ""memories"" of Watanabe are what will last, and the park will always be there to remind us of his toil, sweat, and blood."
658;This is what will truly be his enduring high.
659;That is truly a memorable legacy indeed.
