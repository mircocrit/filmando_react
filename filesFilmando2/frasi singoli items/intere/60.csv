1;"Directed by Andrew Lau, ""Infernal Affairs"" is a slick and subtle portrait of what can happen when ruthless honesty meets ruthless corruption."
2;sang is probably the best actor in the entire film as Superintendent Wong Chi Shing: he has a sort of hard.
3;handed and always comes off right.
4;In any case, this is a must see and proof that Asian cinema hasn't been completely hijacked by John Woo.
5;Infernal Affairs is a superb show.
6;But if you want a tight well paced, well written movie starring HK's hottest stars, you've got the right show.
7;Infernal Affair is a near perfect thriller movie.
8;this is a great movie, in its own right.
9;and it features one of the most thrilling episodes with a cellphone (I won't tell you more about it, but you'll know it, when you see it)This movie won several awards in Hong Kong, including Movie of the Year.
10;It was a winner of every major film award in Hong Kong and Taiwan, including Best Picture and Best Actor.
11;After having seen it, I can clearly see why.
12;The cast was phenomenal and the cinematography took Hong Kong cinema to a new level that sets a new bar.
13;based screenwriter William Monahan brilliantly adapted 'Affairs' for US audiences.
14;The showdown scene between Tsang and Anthony Wong (as 'SP Wong') where Tsang sends the takeout food flying across the table is acting and directing at its finest.
15;This film was one of the best written, directed and acted action flix I have seen in a longtime!
16;Andy Lau is the best.
17;One of my favorite actors.
18;this is a film you could watch again and again.
19;One of these henchmen is Lau.
20;thoughts:Andrew Lau (Director) was the cinematographer of City on Fire which remains one of the quintessential films of the Hong Kong action subgenre that gained prominence in the 1990's.
21;While Hong Kong Action Cinema may no longer truly exist, it's influences are everywhere, and while Infernal Affairs may not truly be an action film, many of the techniques used to make those films synonomous with the gritty crime dramas they were are used here to great effect.
22;the ending is often the most important part of any film.
23;The camera shots and visual storytelling are mostly great with scene direction being the directing weakness.
24;The performances are good but not stellar.
25;The sceenplay is tight with a strong plotline, yet suffers with it's need for more characterization (see Heat for a similar type film that nails the characterization perfectly) .
26;The story is strong, original, and creative.
27;Like most good foreign films, it avoids the cheap Hollywood cliche, which is a welcome relief to this filmgoer.
28;Both are directed by Andrew Lau and have received good reviews.
29;The movie contains some nice acting as well.
30;but INFERNAL AFFAIRS is by no means a perfect movie.
31;but I really liked the general tone and look of INFERNAL AFFAIRS, and that was enough to forgive the majority of its missteps.
32;The story itself is brilliant with one mole in an Hong Kong Triad and another in the HK police force.
33;rate and the shots of HK are grandiose (especially the rooftop scenes with that harbour in the background).
34;"the extras are quite good (all in Cantonese w/ English subtitles as the movie is also) with a ""making of"" that gives us a greater appreciation for the actors."
35;The behind the scenes extra is just raw sound and shots of the celebration banquet (wrap party) with one wild.
36;Which they did but this is still the superior version of the tale, just as the Swedish version of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is far superior to the Hollywood version.
37;A Hong Kong home run: brilliant suspense, black humor, and characters you care about in a game of cat.
38;mouse that shows you everything but still surprises with a killer ending.
39;This movie is definitely a must.
40;this is a great movie, those familiar with the movie 'the departed' will deffinetly see where scorsese got his refferance from.
41;but i really enjoyed it alot.
42;This is one of my most favorite movies.
43;Love, love, love Andy Lau and Tony Leung!
44;Really enjoyed this story line.
45;This is a brilliantly conceived Michael Mann.
46;In the end, it is a very serious, believable portrayal of a corrupted man, and is truly Andy Lau's film.
47;Heat still reigns supreme in this genre, as its subplots are truly as fascinating as the major action sequences.
48;But to its credit the film has such strong performances that this is not a detraction.
49;Infernal Affairs is one of the best non.
50;ish Hong Kong movies I've seen in recent years, and is remarkably clearheaded and economical on both Hollywood and Hong Kong scales (especially compared to some of the other Andrew Lau movies I've seen, which themselves are relatively clearheaded on the Hong Kong scale).
51;key thriller bordering on character.
52;"Other elements of their lives like chance meetings, love interests, routines are also depicted, which will please those who insist on examining every aspect of a film in order to feel justified in enjoying it, as it works fairly well as a play on the whole ""good/evil"" thing, the exploration of the ambiguities between the two, while remaining within clear outlines of both good and evil."
53;What makes this film enjoyable are the performances and presentation.
54;pleasing elements as he could.
55;"The story is compelling, but it is the ensemble acting that holds your attention
56;It takes a phenomenal performance to scene.
57;steal from Tony Leung, but Tsang manages it.
58;Other reviews give you the story outline"
59;dimensional role to give Yan a romance interest.
60;Infernal Affairs is an Asian cinema fan's dream with a powerhouse cast the features the likes of Tony Leung (Chungking Express), Andy Lau (House of Flying Daggers), Anthony Wong (Hard.
61;studded thriller about men with their own personal code conflicting with one another.
62;Both films feature dedicated professionals on opposite sides of the law in direct opposition of one another.
63;Infernal Affairs is also beautifully shot with particular attention paid to urban architecture and how it reflects the mood of a given character.
64;The Making of Infernal Affairs features the cast talking about their characters.

67;set footage showing the filming of certain scenes.
68;"there is also an ""Alternate Ending"" that makes the film's conclusion a bit more explicit and changes Lau's fate."
69;infernal Affairs was a huge hit around the world, spawning two sequels.
70;It is an excellent, often exciting, thriller that will soon be remade here in America with Martin Scorsese behind the camera and Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon playing the leads.
71;This movie is full of suspense and tension from start to finish, you are always pondering who is truly good, and who is bad.
72;The movie has interesting dialogue and action, and the story moves along quickly.
73;The ending is very powerful and one that you will remember.
74;Though Scorsese departs to a degree from his Asian source material his effort is deeper in characterization and he ratchets up the tension better.
75;"That said, ""Infernal Affairs"" is much more economical in it's storytelling and despite your familiarity with the basic premise there are enough differences between the two films to keep you on the edge of your seat."
76;"Final verdict: ""Infernal Affairs"" is a great film but ""The Departed"" is a masterpiece."
77;There are many Chinese films done much better than this.
78;One of the best movies I have ever seen!
79;I never saw a movie like this, the storyline unique, the acting superb, and the directing phenomenal!
80;I have been watching movies from Hong Kong for years and this is the best.
81;If you appreciate a good story, something rhat has never been done then you will love this movie!
82;It's a good film from the Orient.
83;This is what a simple walk through Chinatown got me.

85;infernal affairs is striking in that it is first and foremost a showcase of production values and top talent.
86;make this film because it is a familiar theme, and andy lau's natural swagger parallels that of leonardo dicaprio.
87;we all choose our life and live with it.
88;rate and highly recommended film.
89;All of the actors are wonderful in this Hong Kong crime fest.
90;The intensity of the two sides in search of the mole also creates a great deal of panic in the Triad, as they are unable to effectively move merchandise and go about their business.
91;Meanwhile, the good police mole, Yan (Tony Leung) begins to feel even greater pressure as the Triads police mole has moved up the ranks in the department.
92;This film works on ALL levels, as the viewer can feel the intensity of both sides in trying to uncover the mole first, and this in turn puts the viewer on edge as to how this will be resolved.
93;A terrific film, and highly recommended.
94;Certainly one of the best movies to come out of Hong Kong in the past few years.
95;While some may be put off by the lack of action (which is what usually recommends a Hong Kong film), the acting and overall direction of the movie makes it one of the best thrillers around.
96;Both Andy Lau Tak Wah and Tony Leung Chiu Wai are on top of their game in this one, plus the supporting cast of Anthony Wong and Eric Tsang really add a lot of depth to the movie in terms of acting.
97;Overall a great movie that has you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end.
98;Characters will talk for a minute and you'll get maybe three words of subtitles.
99;done one at that, it works on several other well.
100;balanced planes as well, maintaining its sense of intrigue, suspense and tension throughout.

104;Really pulls you in and keeps you there.
105;The sub and back stories, create well.

107;Quite surprising and unusual but believable ending that itself lifts the film to yet another whole plane in its final moments.
108;If someone doesn't spoil it for you, and you're not put off by having to read subtitles, you'll be very pleasantly surprised!
109;Hong Kong's Triad movies long ago muscled their way to the top of the Asian gangster genre.
110;"One of the best seen here since the glory days of John Woo is ""Infernal Affairs,"" a sleek and supersonic vehicle for Andy Lau (""House of Flying Daggers"") and Tony Leung Chiu Wai (""Hero"")."
111;Affairs resists viewers' attempts to make sense of it all in a single viewing.
112;"ups
113;The film is in Cantonese with strong yellow subtitles"
114;The 5.1 audio stays mostly front and center, with sometimes.
115;There is ZERO martial arts scenes in this movie.
116;The plot of the movie is very good.
117;"After I enjoyed Martin Scorcese's ""The Departed"", I decided to watch the film that inspired the celebrated director to re."
118;make it and to move the action from Hong Kong to Boston, MA, USA.
119;As much as I admire Leonardo DiCaprio as Bill Castigan, Tony Leung (Yan) in his role is simply unforgettable.
120;You should see this one before seeing The Departed.
121;I was absolutely amazed at how brilliant the acting was, especially from the two leads, and loved the mvovie despite the fact that I'm not normally a cops n' robbers genre fan.
122;If you liked that film, you should at least see this one.
123;What a terrific film for the genre.
124;mouse game between two men with a catch: both men are the cats and both men are the mice.
125;Directors Lau and Mak keep a tight rein on the proceedings, and the result is a film of incredible tension.
126;Scorsese remade the film as The Departure, and both films are terrific in their own way.
127;Stylish cat and mouse thriller from Hong Kong, it stars the Special Administrative Region's biggest stars.
128;What we will see is how the two manage to sidestep each other, cooperating unknowingly while both are assigned to track down the moles in their respective organizations.
129;in various vignettes, everything comes down to a satisfying conclusion.
130;This is the original story and it is superior to the departed.
131;Great movie and well worth your money.
132;And it gets crazy cool, as each side tries to determine the mole, while they are faced with moral dillemas.
133;And the ending is great.
134;Fans of suspense, Chinese cinema, cat and mouse movies.
135;Good performances by interesting actors performing somewhat intriguing roles.
136;Nothing particularly surprising or stirring about the ending, however.
137;Tony Leung is great in this and even the often stiff Andy Lau deserves some credit.
138;sang and the always energetic Eric Tsang both take the cake for their superb acting.
139;"She's a famous Taiwanese singer and *snicker ahem* ""actress""."
140;Infernal Affairs is one fascinating movie with a great premise.
141;the plot to this movie is simple and strong but at the same time it's not an untouchable work of genius, it has holes like any narrative but is a fantastic example of what the East can produce with a mode come of self restraint.
142;This solid drama is played out by an all star cast.
143;Anthony Wong is understated and cool, (at times you still want to see him explode as in Beast cops or bun man,) Tony Leung is his usual mean and moody self and but it is Andy Lau's performance that really shines.
144;A powerhouse performance underneath such a cool exterior, you'll be lucky to see him flinch, yet he portrays such intensity, constantly he plays his cards close to his chest, caught up and confused losing himself in the facade he has created.
145;i did notice, though, the way the female characters were used as symbols to represent the good and truthful side of life.
146;The conclusion of this film may come as a sort of twist to viewers.
147;And that is what makes the film a higher rating it deserves.
148;If you are adventurous enough to try even one Hong Kong movie, try moving forward with this one.
149;cue plot twists galore, building towards a denouement that's both unexpected and refreshingly unorthodox.
150;notch: Leung is particularly good, though even he is almost overshadowed by the tag.
151;I came across Infernal Affairs after watching a few other great films from Andy Lau.
152;It is a tense psychological thriller with complex characters.
153;And appreciate Andy Wong, perfect as the police commissioner.
154;Andy Lau, Tony Leung together in one movie that is fast packed, well written and performed so well.
155;It will keep you wondering until the end.
156;You wont be able to look away from the screen.
157;both of them lead parallel lives until one fateful evening, their paths cross during a raid on one of Sam's illegal operations.
158;Anthony Wong also appears as ' Wong' [the only one person who knows Yan's true identity] It is a fast and exciting story as both sides are very eager to undercover their mole first but who will win, and who will be first to be found out.
159;This is a tense and gripping film.
160;It's also an emotional film, and leaves you in a reflective mood.
161;This is a truly great film.
162;For those who don't know, this movie inspired The Departed and tells roughly the same story.

164;twisting epic Hong Kong cinema has been famous for in recent years.
165;The directors examine the meaning of loyalty and honor while blurring the line between good and evil, and the result is a wrenching psychological cop thriller with a pace all its own.
166;Asian star Lau is marvelous playing opposite the equally charismatic Wai, and the film gets an extra boost from its superb visuals.
167;Affairs is thrilling, intelligent, and easy to love.
168;mouse game between an undercover cop positioned deep within a Triad gang and a high.
169;While it nevers attains the intensity or heat that I would have expected, it's still sharp and intriguing, and I definitely look forward to the Scorsese version.
170;A superb film on all levels.
171;A crackling suspense thriller, an identity drama and a superb action film that takes the genre to a new level!
172;They better do a good job on it!
173;Infernal Affairs is an incredible police drama.
174;I would recommend all to view it the same, since English dubbed movies ruin the intensity 99% of the time.
175;This is a detective style story that unravels nicely.
176;paced modern Hong Kong where two cultures, the Chinese and the previous Royal British Colony, are fused into a complex mix that attracts and repels each other simultaneously.
177;This dance between the cultures is noticeable in the daily jargon and architecture, yet the clear distinction between the cultures can be heard in the music and social values often based on proverbial lessons taught from ancient stories.
178;Ming (Andy Lau), a spirited and driven police officer, is Yan's counterpart as he attempts to snoop out from within what the organized crime unit is planning.
179;The struggle for Hong Kong leads Yan and Ming into a cerebral complex maze of traps and dangers controlled by both the police and the Triads as they both attempt to unveil the true identity of the moles.
180;wai Keung Lau and Siu Fai Mak direct a visually stunning film that is brought to life by an excellent cast.
181;This stress is elevated by minute details in the script and meticulous cinematography that maximizes each situation through camera movement and focusing at the best possible time.
182;Lighting and filters used in the camera while shooting many of the scenes enhances realistic feelings for the scenes, but it also leaves an artistic impression that focuses on the emotional moment.
183;When all aspects of film making are put together in Infernal Affairs it leaves the audience with an exceptional cinematic experience.
184;While the remake is very good on it's own, anyone who has seen this original version will tell you this original still stands head and shoulders above Scorsese's excellent remake.
185;Infernal Affairs is more suspenseful, tighter, and packs a much greater emotional wallop thanks to the excellent acting of Tony Leung Chiu Wai as the undercover cop suffering from a long and extremely dangerous assignment as the number 2 in the Triad group (very reminiscent of his equally strong performance in a nearly identical role in John Woo's Hardboiled).
186;The handling of the OCTB Chief who is the only one who knows Leung's true identity as an undercover cop is equally handled with finesse and drama by Hong Kong veteran Anthony Wong.
187;His nemesis, the Triad leader played expertly by Eric Tsang is equally amazing to watch.
188;The heat between Wong and Tsang is beautifully generated in a scene at the police station and is unrivaled by any of the scenes in the Departed by the parallel American actors Martin Sheen and Jack Nicholson.
189;In order to achieve this each camp puts a mole in the other camp.
190;Now it is a race against time to uncover the respective moles and the stakes are high.
191;impressive performances by both Andy Lau and especially Tony Leung.
192;The film is full of suspense and you find yourself rooting for Yan.
193;Ming moving into a plush new apartment with his girlfriend and Yan going to see the psychologist for his sins.
194;The editing is brilliant with mixing of loud fast paced music and beautiful haunting melodies.
195;The original picture of the movie just shows the faces of the 2 main characters.
196;It is ruining this otherwise wonderful movie.
197;Both Tony Leung and Andy Lau are just perfect for their roles.
198;The twists and turn are unexpected.
199;The whole time I was on the edge of my seat.
200;The best part about this movie is that it leaves you breathless.
201;Two minutes into the movie you will feel you are into their world.
202;I also liked how it shows rather realistic side of high.
203;tech and highly professional police operations in Hong Kong.
204;Cool storyline to keep you watching.
205;I bought this movie several years ago when it first came out and now I have the trilogy.
206;Leung Chiu Wai and Lau Tak Wah are great in the movie.
207;Andy Lau and Tony Leung are in top form as the protagonists in this gritty thriller .
208;The twists and turns will keep you glued to your seat until the very end.
209;One of the rare occasions when the remake is better than the predecessor, The Departed is far superior.
210;The main characters are well drawn and convincingly acted.
211;The idea of moles trying to expose one another is very clever and well executed.
212;Overall, a very enjoyable gripping story.
213;Cantonese is beautiful to listen to but when this film was dubbed the emotions and nuances were eliminated.
214;The actors in this film did a great job and if you can only understand English you are missing a lot.
215;the story is great and you have great actors in the top 4 roles giving good, intense acting jobs.
216;This film is about good and evil and that the difference is only by an individual's perspective.
217;Infernal affairs is an exceptional film, relying on intelligence and heart rather than testosterone to produce its vice.
218;Each agent is very smart and over years has worked to a position of trust.
219;The heart of the film, then, is the battle between the two men.
220;Brilliantly and subtly entwined in this police drama is the changing nature of the two men, who must face what they have become.
221;Either?The film really scores in every category.
222;The cinematography doesn't have a stale shot throughout, and the film has a hard, crisp edge to it.
223;The script is clean and perfect without any filler, and director Wu Jian Dau keeps the story moving at swift pace.
224;Tsang is able to bring a frightening hardness to this character.
225;This actor really plays this role with a cool, reserved dignity.
226;I was really involved in all the characters and I really cared about what was going to happen to them.
227;The ending, which was absolutely tremendous, really gave me a jolt.
228;The scene I remember best, and the one that stays with me, is the scene where Yan (Tony Leung) runs into an old girlfriend by chance in the streets.
229;it was a great bit of film.
230;making in a wonderful film.
231;This is one of those movies you want to tell people about, coming from someone who's not really a Hong Kong film aficionado.
232;it has a simple but ingenious plot, first.
233;rate acting, nice dollops of suspense and gunplay and a satisfying ending.
234;simply put, a Triad boss places a young, up.
235;the cinematography, the urban gun fights, the two mercurial leads.
236;"but I'll tell you, this is a great movie period, whether you think you like ""foreign films"" or not."
237;The later is an English language, star.
238;Ming (Andy Lau) excels and rises in the ranks.
239;Stay with it though because each man begins to question what side of the law he is on.
240;Yan wants out and wants to return to regular duty.
241;Ming wants a wife and home and a family.
242;The violence is very restrained but the production values are very good.
243;Each character, including supplementary ones is given purpose and importance.
244;what is unique about this film (other than exposing corruption within our law enforcement) is that both men become so absorbed in their roles that they forget who they are.
245;this film isn't just a thriller and a race to see who will win.
246;The film deals with the importance of honesty and identity.
247;Ideally, if a person is honest with themselves and others around them, they can at least be at peace with who they are regardless of their place in life.
248;Internal meaning it was dealing with law enforcement and gang activity by penetrating their defenses internally while the film subtly examines the internal effects of changing a person's external attributes such as name, career, family, appearance, etc., but I digress.
249;I think this took away from the viewing experience and the wonderful story that unfolded at lightening speed toward the end.
250;"favorite Quote: Wife in response to her story about a man with multiply personalities, ""I can't finish my story."
251;"Husband replies, ""That is a good question."
252;The movie is very good, but it doesn't have an exciting start, just as it didn't do anything for me at the end.
253;Everything in between is good though.
254;The story moves along at a good pace and keeps you involved.
255;I am not a big fan of Anthony Wong, in fact I hate him in many movies but this I thought was his best performance I have ever seen.
256;He gives you that seriousness that you need in a cop drama.
257;this release by Miramx is surprisingly good.
258;It has a making of, behind the scenes, and an alternate ending coming in at about 20 minutes of extras total.
259;I practically grew up on chinese movies, and what I loved most about these movies were the action.
260;Movies like Once Upon A Time In China, Drunken Master and Police Story all bring back fond memories of the best kung fu and martial arts moves in movie history.
261;But I've never really been impressed with the storyline of chinese movies, although they brought fun to a whole new level, there was yet to be an intelligent movie from Hong Kong.
262;After 10 long years, Yan and Lau have fit in their roles perfectly.
263;Meanwhile, Yan has earned the respect of Sam and is now in his trustworthy circle.
264;The movie continues with a cat and mouse game of figuring out who exactly is the informant and concludes with a spectacular finale that puts most Hollywood movies to shame.
265;One thing's for sure, Infernal Affairs is banking on it's intelligence more than it's action and personally, I found it refreshing.
266;Kudos to the writers for doing a fantastic job keeping us at the edge of our seats the entire time.
267;with an already great script, they needed good actors.
268;Andy Lau and Tony Leung mesmerize us with their performances.
269;These characters are a delight to watch, never have there been a pairing like this since Vince and Jules in Pulp Fiction.
270;Although sharing less screen time than the two leads, they gave brilliant performances as well to further push the movie to perfection.
271;I enjoyed this movie thoroughly for it's original script and wonderful acting.
272;Rarely do I enjoy a movie this much and I can say with a degree of confidence, this movie is so much better than most Hollywood movies out there.
273;Watch it and you'll know.
274;Definitely a classic in my books.
275;"Note: This movie won multiple ""Best Movie"" awards in Asia, as did the actors for their acting here."
276;p/s I read that the great Scorsese is making a movie based on Infernal Affairs, starring Leo DiCaprio, Matt Damon and Jack Nicholson.
277;Here's to hoping Scorsese will breathe new life to this already great movie.
278;It was good but you have to be ok with subtitles.
279;This original chinese film that Martin Scorsese remade into 'The Departed' received impressive critical acclaim from many while others were not so impressed.
280;Scorsese's version is a thousand times better.
281;American cinema does a much better job with such subject matter, and American audiences would never find this film appealing to a mass theatrical release in this country.
282;But the Chinese have been making much better films over the past 12 years than this, especially many of their martial arts based films.
283;The American version is so Hollywood ending.
284;I never did see a wide release date for this excellent film.
285;Infernal Affairs (Andrew Lau and Siu Fai Mak, 2002)Hopefully all of you are aware by now that The Departed, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture of 2006, is Martin Scorsese's adaptation of Lau and Mak's Infernal Affairs.
286;I have not yet seen The Departed, and thus can't comment on the similarity between the two movies, but I can say that this one, at least, is a winner through and through.
287;All this is helped by the fact that Lau (the character) and Chan are well.
288;drawn, absorbing characters, and Lau (the actor) and Leung make them into real humans with which the viewer can empathize.
289;I can see how DiCaprio and Scorsese climbed into The Departed .
290;Infernal Affairs has to be the greatest movie I have seen.
291;It was brilliantly directed, wonderful storyline and such great acting by Andy Lau and Tony Leung Chiu.
292;once again, the movie was a masterpiece, definitely an instant classic.5 of 5
293;Infernal Affairs takes all that and stands it on its head.
294;"IA is a thinking person's thriller, and not for nothing did Martin Scorcese adapt this movie and have it win his first ""Best Director"" Oscar."
295;"Witty and stylish, ""IA"" has a little something for everyone . . . except mindless violence."
296;the plot is simple and well.
297;The Triads put a mole deep inside the police department, while the cops place a mole deep inside the Triads.
298;Can the criminal stay a criminal?These questions are analyzed in a thoughtful movie, more content to play cat.
299;star status are two sub.
300;plot involving the criminal and his wife is better handled.
301;His keen eye and steady dimeaner makes him the perfect candidate to infiltrate the Triads, who have taken control of Hong Kong's streets and are peddling massive amounts of drugs to it's citizens.
302;Sam is deftly played by Eric Tsang, who gives a highly effective, authentic performance here.
303;What follows is one of the best table.
304;Ming showcases his moxie and stealth inside an active command center, feeding police channels and locations to Sam in real.
305;Yan, at the same time, finds a way to keep Wong informed.
306;The rest of the film is yours to enjoy.
307;The original score begins thefilm along with sweeping, abstract visuals that flow gracefully across the screen, accompanied by the undulating score.
308;"rear and diagonally back
309;The mood shifted from forceful grandeur to intricate suspicion and back again.
310;The perfect audio preview to what was to follow.
311;Deep inside the film is a heart.
312;It's brilliant in depth and scope.
313;So rarely does a soundtrack fall into line and dance so well with a film.
314;So rarely does one set the tone for a film.
315;infernal Affairs is loaded with subterfuge and intrigue.
316;The beauty of the film is in the interaction.
317;It has all of the elements of many crime dramas, but Infernal Affairs is genuine and sophisticated like none other.
318;the place I got it from, had all 3 Infernal Affairs movies bundled together.
319;I must say, that this movie, ranks up there with the best movies I have ever seen.
320;The characters are amazing, played to perfection by the excellent cast.
321;You grow to love and care about each of them, both the good guys and the bad guys.
322;once in a while you run across a gem like this, where there are many major stars in the movie, and each star delivers a magnificent portrayal of his or her character.
323;This is such a movie.
324;I also very much enjoyed Infernal Affairs part II.
325;i can't recommend this movie highly enough .
326;This has to be easily the best chinese thriller I've seen ever.
327;i saw this movie before the american version, and I must say I enjoyed it more than """"The departed""""."""
328;And the subtitles will be like that for the entire movie.
329;Other than that, it's a great movie.
330;Asian crimer fans who haven't seen this have a reliable go to flick.
331;"The idea of making these three movies is to ""mimic"" the God Father i, ii, iii."
332;My favorites among the Trilogy is part i and ii, the third one is not as good as the first two, but it is still a good movie though.
333;"The movie ""Departed"" is actually based on the first two of the Internal Affir Trilogy, that is quite clearly mentioned in the trailer of Departed."
334;If you like Departed, I highly recommend this set of movies without any hesitation!
335;"Infernal Affairs is the first released movie in a series and is known as ""Wu jian dao"" in Hong Kong (known as ""Infernal Affairs"" and ""I Want to be You"" in Hong Kong English)."
336;a very tense thrilling movie.
337;Good acting, good music, tense strong plot, and there is even some humor involved (and sadness).
338;Quite intriguing and ingenious, cops chasing cops chasing criminals with criminals chasing criminals chasing cops.
339;Gripping right to the end.
340;I saw this movie several years ago and remembered it being very good.
341;The ending was perfect in that when you thought the bad guy 'won,' he really didn't.
342;This was a great movie.
343;Good balance between action and storyline.
344;Interesting twist toward the end.
345;"I have to say that after I saw ""The Departed"", ""Infernal Affairs"" is a masterpiece compared to Martin Scorce's adaptation."
346;With I. a. and its prequel and sequel, you get a whole sequence of events that all tie together.
347;All three films are filled with deep psychology and suspense.
348;On the plus side, there are some great acting performances, particularly from the always excellent Mr. Leung.
349;'Infernal Affairs' is the biggest box.
350;"The film's premises are very simple
351;With this clever version of 'undercover' theme (that was previously seen in the films like 'Donnie Brasco'), 'Infernal Affairs' presents as much tension and humanity as was seen in that Johnny Depp/Al Pacino film.
352;His superior officer Wong (Anthony Wong) is the only one who knows his real identity in the police, and Yan is also getting fed up with the life based on lies.
353;This is a noir, and that means that it is the characters that matter, or their lives.
354;And the results are often nerve.
355;aNd the acting is all top.
356;Lau and Leung are both perfect, but more fantastic are Anthony Wong as police inspector and Eric Tsang as Triad boss.
357;helped greatly by the moody camera (Andrew Lau and Lai Yiu Fai and 'visual consultant' Christopher Doyle, 'Rabbit Proof Fence'), 'Infernal Affairs' tells you that without John Woo Hong Kong movie industry can still produce excellent films with a touch of reality.
358;'Infernal Affairs' is the one you are watching now"
359;I decided to check out Infernal Affairs after it got a lot of positive word of mouth at the Denver International Film Festival a couple years ago.
360;The storyline's twists and turns keep the viewer guessing until the very end.
361;"There are some very good reviews already posted about ""Infernal Affairs"", although they got some minor facts wrong (such as which actor played which role)."
362;for Scorsese fans who enjoyed his version and now wonder if they should see the original.Yes, they should see the original.
363;Scorsese's style, as always, is marvelous.
364;which I enjoyed and was his best film in years.
365;Between the pressures of a higher budget and bigger stars.
366;a crisp story that did what it needed to, and then got out.
367;It adds a love interest (which really goes nowhere) and a lot of character details.
368;"the Scorsese film attempts ""justice"" at the end."
369;In the Scorsese version, an additional character, played by Mark Whalberg, is added to create justice.
370;None of it really works.
371;I personally felt a lot of involvement with the DiCaprio character.
372;a more or less happy ending, even if it completely screws up the story.
373;The ending is far more cynical, and as a result works a lot better.
374;I just hate how Western versions of Asian films ruin the look and feel of a good movie.
375;The posters and covers are much better.
376;This is probably the best Hong Kong film of the last decade, so it's worth a shot if you're interested.
377;There's great character development and interesting plot twists that will keep the audience intrigued until the last moments.
378;It will be fascinating to see what Martin Scorcese does with his planned remake.
379;"The standard set by ""Infernal Affairs"" is very high indeed."
380;there are a lot of police dramas/action movies out there, some are worthwhile others are not.
381;Infernal Affairs is one of those that are worthwhile to watch, it's brimming with intelligence, style and edge something many newer movies of the genre are lacking.
382;"The plot is simple yet complex, something you think ""hey, I could of thought of that!"""
383;and yet you didn't, that's why it's genius in a way.
384;This all raps up into a fever pitched ending that also has an emotional punch to it, add some beautifully done shots into the mix and you have one damn good movie.
385;Overall highly highly recommended for fans of psychological/police dramas and fans of cinema overall My rating: 9/10.
386;The best I could deduce from the film credits is her name is Fiona Fung.
387;"The closest I have been able to verify that is her Wikipeda page list the following: ""She also worked as a backing singer and demo singer for various artists, and as a vocal producer for movies including the Infernal Affairs trilogy."""
388;"Martin Scorsese won best director for the movie ""The Departed"", the same film that won Best Picture in the Academy Awards a few years ago."
389;"Shows you how American studios disrespect Asian cinema and film fans before
390;Despite some minor plot holes and devices, Alan Mak and Andrew Lau's police thriller is highly gripping and very entertaining because of the performances of its cast.
391;willed, smart and totally committed to his assignment.
392;The idea of opposing moles does give the film a `tweak' in the right direction.
393;The way the film is structured is similar to a cat and mouse game that the underlying suspense is built around the chase between our two moles provides an excellent cinematic experience.
394;The fates of certain characters such as Anthony Wong's character provide tension and the plot twists are definitely compelling.
395;Most sequences are handled well, and Scorsese made the right decision in keeping those scenes mirror images of the original.
396;(Funny he won best director for a remake)The film also manages to expose and pushes the limits of the duality of man, the innate struggle within one`s soul and its underlying perception between two colliding worlds.
397;The Yin and the Yang is brought into exposition and marvelously summed up in the film's opening paragraph """"."""
398;Yan obviously has performed immoral acts in the service of the triad to keep his cover.
399;Leung performs admirably in his role, you can just see the emotional anguish run wild in his eyes, that his character is clearly a man who wants out.
400;Every man knows, every self.
401;respecting man knows that women have the innate ability to change a man.
402;Infernal Affairs is a character.
403;"I also commend the touch of Buddhist teachings in the film's beginnings and climax
404;Infernal Affairs has puzzles aplenty and provokes a reaction from its audience.
405;It's a fine example of synergy, where one takes all his resources and utilizes it to its utmost potential.
406;Infernal Affairs is a familiar presentation done exquisitely well.
407;The Departed was a good film and I am sure many are wondering"
408;This is a very entertaining movie about a young man recruited by the mob to join the police, and be their inside man.
409;It is a dangerous game of cat and mouse.
410;Infernal Affairs is highly entertaining and I recommend it to anyone who likes good police dramas.
411;I would like to enjoy the rest of the story.
412;The acting is grade A and it's superior to the remake The Departed.
413;One of the highest box office hits in China, these actors and the director have moved up huge on my list.
414;One who is an undercover agent who gets employed with the Chinese Syndicate and another who works for the mob but has worked his way up in the Police force.
415;A well crafted crime noir as the search begins to find out who the moles are.
416;I love the ending and it's one of the main reasons this film is better than The Departed.
417;I figured that since I enjoy foreign movies I'd give it a try.
418;i was SO happy that I did.
419;This movie is full of twists and turns and you never know what is going to happen next, except that there are some serious levels of action.
420;This is an exceptional movie which spawned both a sequel and a prequel.
421;titles or, you can speak Chinese, then this movie is well worth adding to your movie collection.
