I:10187;1;But despite the incoherencies, it has some redeeming qualities that make this an engaging film.
I:10187;2;Incorporated into the larger story are a number of intentional throwbacks to the earlier films in the series.
I:10187;3;it was the commentary on action films and some of the subtler points of the film.
I:10187;4;But if it was trying to mock action films, then it does a great job.
I:10187;5;So, if you watch this movie with that perspective, you should actually enjoy it.
I:10187;6;another key factor to enjoying this film is Johnny Depp.
I:10187;7;The rest of the cast is okay, but not particularly brilliant.
I:10187;8;If you've seen the movies leading up to this one, you may enjoy it.
I:10187;9;You may also enjoy it if you like Depp and approach this film expecting it to be mocking of action films.
I:10187;10;but I recommend it for Johnny Depp's brilliant comedic role.
I:10187;11;All this movie proves is that Depp rules and Rodriguez is definitely a broken record who lacks the ability of his friend Tarantino to create something fresh, although Tarantino had a hand in this one too.
I:10187;12;"I am writing a review based on the knowledge of Rodreguez's past Mariachi films, and I strongly recommend viewing them first before watching ""Once Upon A Time In Mexico."""
I:10187;13;"Once Upon A Time In Mexico (hereby referred to as ""OUTIM"") is a film made for himself, as upposed to the kiddie trilogy ""Spy Kids."""
I:10187;14;Being an aspiring filmmaker, I loved this movie, and I can't see it being done any other way.
I:10187;15;aCTING:Needless to say, I believe that Johnny Depp was one of the greatest assets to the film.
I:10187;16;His subtle mannerisms and quirky one.
I:10187;17;As El Mariachi, Antonio does a wonderful job, even though the role mostly consists of an intense, often insane looking stare.
I:10187;18;One exception is the delicious Selma Hayek, who will always be in my head.
I:10187;19;cINEMATOGRAPHY and EDITING:Rodriguez's visual style is very unique and constant throughout the El Mariachi series.
I:10187;20;The whole movie was filmed and edited by Rodriguez himself, and the techniques are not of regular Hollywood variety.
I:10187;21;"ins, much like ""El Mariachi,"" which moves the action very well."
I:10187;22;In between the two are a series of small stories that take place with other characters and eventually get wound up between them.
I:10187;23;It is somewhat convoluted, but give it time and everything will come into place.
I:10187;24;I viewed the story as a legend, and in legends, the heros do amazing things.
I:10187;25;The archaic setting of Mexico fits perfectly with the storyline.
I:10187;26;The music is amazing and sets the mystic tone of the movie.
I:10187;27;talented Ms. Hayek, sung beautifully.
I:10187;28;Many of the characters show character develpoment, and you have to really pay attention to enjoy the subtleties of their characters.
I:10187;29;johnny steals the movie in a performance that keeps faith with itself, while including a series of wicked impersonations of, among others, Marlon Brando and Chow Yun.
I:10187;30;He manages to keep the staggering violence at the level of just palatable farce, especially when armed hilariously with an additional prosthetic limb.
I:10187;31;A succession of set pieces, however vivid and colourful .
I:10187;32;Also familiar in this third part of the trilogy is the Angel.
I:10187;33;*Loads of great action scenes.
I:10187;34;"although this doesn't quite outdo ""Desperado"" or even the original ""El Mariachi,"" ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico"" is wildly entertaining."
I:10187;35;The action scenes are its greatest strength, for they are bigger (almost epic in scale) and great fun to watch.
I:10187;36;The characters are great, even if there are dozens of them.
I:10187;37;Still, most action movie fans will like this.
I:10187;38;I hesitate to say OUATIM is a triumph of style over substance, because that implies that it HAS any substance.
I:10187;39;while Rodriguez certainly knows how to shoot and edit movies entertainingly, he has much to learn about writing them.
I:10187;40;This a good example when a couple of good actors make a bad movie.
I:10187;41;The grander than grand explosions, superhuman visual stunts, and non.
I:10187;42;Oh, yeah, the catchy soundtrack.
I:10187;43;but the intriguing thing about them is that the viewer can't make sense of them until towards the end of the film.
I:10187;44;To add to the dark mix there is an added almost Hannibal Lecter moment with regards to a surgical scene and it's aftermath.
I:10187;45;Something about cartels and the President of Mexico, assasinations, revolutions, coup d'tats, political figures on the take, you know, the usual.
I:10187;46;the film certainly delivers in the action genre, although there are too many twists and turns in the plotting that lead nowhere (especially the face reconstruction scenes)to make any real sense of it.
I:10187;47;He also directed and shot it.
I:10187;48;one clever plot twist has Depp being set up as a dupe while he himself is setting up a dupe situation.
I:10187;49;For a moment, things get interesting.
I:10187;50;his character is humerous, sexy, vicious, and just all around Johnny!
I:10187;51;The characters were intriguing and somewhat developed.
I:10187;52;In the very beginning, you see that Carolina became as deadly as El Mariachi with skills and tools and weapons that were wonderfully unbelievable and beautifully executed.
I:10187;53;with that in regard, Johnny Depp was wonderfully phenomenal and a right b*****d as the renegade CIA agent.
I:10187;54;He's cool, cocky, calm and confident and I loved him.
I:10187;55;Johnny Depp is an incredible actor, able to morph himself into any kind of personality he wants to.
I:10187;56;Take a look at any of his last 10 films and you'll see that he can be mistaken for having a multiple personality disorder.
I:10187;57;antonio's presence is actually smaller than that of Depp.
I:10187;58;His screen presence is just as calm and collect but reserved in order to bring Depp to the foreground.
I:10187;59;I wasn't too thrilled about Enrique, given he's just as much a cheesy singer as his dad but his role was fairly funny.
I:10187;60;It's about 2 hours from what I clocked and I found myself a bit restless.
I:10187;61;"Because I loved the characters so much from the first, I give it a solid ""B""."
I:10187;62;check it out if you like.
I:10187;63;This story maybe about El Mariachi but Agent Sands is someone you'll like more he's crazy,funny,and deadly now that is a cool anti.
I:10187;64;if you think that this is a good idea write it in your reviews so I can find out.
I:10187;65;besides Johnny Depp who gives a wonderful preformance full of wit, sarcasm, passion and anger, there are Antonio Banderas, and Salma Hayek, who do their characters proud.
I:10187;66;other reviewers have gone into much detail and far better than I, about the ploy etc.
I:10187;67;For me the movie was simply a fun, albeit extremely loud, treat where I learned that a guitar isn't always just a guitar.
I:10187;68;The action was what makes this movie worth watching.
I:10187;69;This was my favorite movie of all time.
I:10187;70;Amazing direction combined with special effects that will blow your mind, this movie is a must own.
I:10187;71;I saw it before I even knew that it was the third in a series and I still loved it.
I:10187;72;mystery lover, this film is a must.
I:10187;73;Best:1) It's an unusual (may I say Matrix .
I:10187;74;snortin' good time.2) There are appearances by a slew of famous actors.3) Style is the thing and this one really has it.4) There's a host of special features including a director commentary, interviews and several behind.
I:10187;75;driven OR a true sequel), then you'll probably like it more with each viewing.
I:10187;76;Proper expectations are the key to liking this modern.
I:10187;77;depp was great, as were Banderas and Hayek.
I:10187;78;A great ending to the El Mariachi Trilogy!
I:10187;79;Any fan of the previous Anthonio Banderas Mariachi movies should be quite happy.
I:10187;80;A little more acting this time with some great parts played by Johnny Depp, Salma Hayek, Mickey Rourke, and Willem Defoe.
I:10187;81;As always it is filled with plenty of action, and testosterone.
I:10187;82;But, if for some unknown reason you are like me and love the Mariachi series, this one is a must.
I:10187;83;but when I actually saw some of his work I realized he is a great comedic actor.
I:10187;84;I love a good action film but.You fly 30 feet when you get struck with a bullet?
I:10187;85;He's really passionate about the state of filmaking today.
I:10187;86;His slick portrayal of Agent Sands is quick.
I:10187;87;witted and just pure Depp.
I:10187;88;"Because I have no eyes, f***mook among other lines definitely will crack you up, including ""Mexico is my beat and I'm walking it."
I:10187;89;Antonio Banderas is, as always, a star in his own right, and perfectly adequate as El Mariachi with his soulful guitar.
I:10187;90;Iglesias actually turns out a pretty good acting role in this film.
I:10187;91;All I can say is, Robert Rodriguez is brilliant, and so is the movie.
I:10187;92;Like I said, it's his finest performance (in my opinion), even though I haven't seen everything he's done, but that's another story.
I:10187;93;this is an awesome movie.
I:10187;94;A great movie, but I despise false advertising.
I:10187;95;At some point, you may have to just go along with the movie, accept all the little subplots, and enjoy the ride.
I:10187;96;And a fun ride at that.
I:10187;97;The characters, especially Agent Sands (Johnny Depp) are fun to watch, and the bullets do fly.
I:10187;98;One minute moustache, the next, no moustache.
I:10187;99;the movie looks wonderful, and there are scads of extras in this movie, and they are listed on the product page, so I won't get into them.
I:10187;100;All in all, a fun, flamboyant, action filled movie with beautiful scenery that got tripped up a little on its' various subplots, losing the viewer in the process at times.
I:10187;101;The action is just as outrageouse as the other movie, with shootouts on the streets and inside building with a nice bodycount, though it never reached the same level of intensity as Desperado .
I:10187;102;telling or the sequel's creative action sequences and dramatic back story so he just hits us with a two.
I:10187;103;"looking action films but the dynamic that really impressed me wasn't just the fact that they were ""loud"" and had a big body count."
I:10187;104;budget attempt with entertaining characters, great musical scores, and an all.
I:10187;105;around good story and made a crowd.
I:10187;106;pleaser that really looked like a million bucks.
I:10187;107;"i enjoyed ""Once Upon A Time In Mexico""."
I:10187;108;Mexico is honestly probably the best effort of them all.
I:10187;109;Robert's script shows a lot of brilliance, most noteably with the clever dialouge exhibited by Depp's character.
I:10187;110;"All in all, this movie is a fun and exciting conclusion to Rodriguez's ""Mariachi"" series."
I:10187;111;Rodriguez is very insightful in his audio commentary for the film and also goes into detail on several elements of film.
I:10187;112;The deleted scenes are an added treat though there really isn't anything that sticks out as being particulary amazing.
I:10187;113;"The plot of this movie is very well done
I:10187;114;Pay attention to the words he uses .
I:10187;115;A big change in power, or a TRULY anti.
I:10187;116;That he incorporates the insidious role of the CIA is what makes it all the better.
I:10187;117;a side note is that the plot, while unreal because of the superhero mariachi approach, has a number of real elements.
I:10187;118;The above CIA scheme is one.
I:10187;119;He adds, in my opinion, a very neat plot angle, that converges with the main plotline quite smoothly.
I:10187;120;Part of that is the good acting, but the other part is the way his lines connect him to the context of real.
I:10187;121;somehow, Rodriguez also works humor into the plot, in a rather tounge in cheek fashion.
I:10187;122;All in all, it really adds to the movie.
I:10187;123;This movie just keeps on going and going and going.
I:10187;124;A great action film with a mythic hero, lots of action, some good acting and brialliant and colourful photography!
I:10187;125;A visual delight is the best way to describe this film.
I:10187;126;I thought the movie delivered action, awesome dialogue, action, cool movie sets, action, believable villains, action, fantastic surprises, and more action.
I:10187;127;The action starts very quickly, and I think the characters are interesting and the script ties all the participants together quite well.
I:10187;128;i love the scene with Johnny Depp running head first into the ledge of the building.
I:10187;129;Depp had as much fun making this flick (in my opinion) as director Robert Rodriguez did making it.
I:10187;130;I enjoyed this film immensely!Antonio Banderas plays his role as El Mariachi to perfection .
I:10187;131;salma Hayek is awesome, beautiful, and completely believable in her role as Carolina!Mickey Rourke was refreshingly interesting in his strange role as Billy, a man looking to get out of a terrible mess.
I:10187;132;cheech Marin is always charming, and he wasn't so bad as Belini .
I:10187;133;Except fun.Yes, this third entry in Robert Rodriguez's El Mariachi series is a blast, an entertaining, funny.
I:10187;134;It means nothing, but it's still one of 2003's best films.
I:10187;135;Rodriguez made this movie practically all by himself, and you can feel his passion, his love for filmmaking in every frame.
I:10187;136;Even if nothing else in Mexico worked, this would still be an entertaining flick thanks to the director's style, his framing and pacing and wit.
I:10187;137;But it always comes across as fresh and new and exciting, which sometimes is the most reasonable way to judge a movie.
I:10187;138;hearted humor, never with so many laugh.
I:10187;139;banderas, I must say, is great .
I:10187;140;He's twice as good as a movie like this deserves, and probably ten times more bizzare than Rodriguez ever intended.
I:10187;141;Like Capt. Jack Sparrow, he is simply an unforgettable character.
I:10187;142;Plus if you're a Johnny Depp fan, this is a must.
I:10187;143;see (he basically steals the film).
I:10187;144;Robert Rodriguez's Once Upon a Time in Mexico is the culprit.
I:10187;145;That's part of the charm.
I:10187;146;Rodriguez has style in spades, and the scenes are very enjoyable to watch.
I:10187;147;Bodies jumping, in a graceful pirouette as the bullets spatter, it's all great.
I:10187;148;She's the only beauty in this tough film (there is one other woman, Eva Mendez, but while she's quite beautiful, she's tough as nails), so we need the occasional interlude.
I:10187;149;Given the nature of the film, it's actually quite good.
I:10187;150;He might actually make a name for himself.
I:10187;151;He broods quite well (despite the fact that I think he's made to do too much of it, he's very good at it).
I:10187;152;It's only Depp's acting which makes his role even watchable.
I:10187;153;I also have to mention Cheech Marin.
I:10187;154;He plays his part really well, and I started to feel sorry for him when I realized that there's no way he's going to survive.
I:10187;155;if you've followed the El Mariachi series, then it's worth it to pick this one up.
I:10187;156;The action scenes are worth it if you're already a fan.
I:10187;157;very happy with how fast and the great condition of this item was ,I gave it as a gift to a freind
I:10187;158;I loved it, but could see why people would hate it.
I:10187;159;But beside that this is a really good movie with good acting and some epic action scences.
I:10187;160;Highly Recommended but see the first two first.
I:10187;161;If you want to see Johnny Depp's humor at its best, watch Pirates of the Caribbean.
I:10187;162;antonio banderas was just as great as johnny.
I:10187;163;Once upon a Time in Mexico is an exciting adventure movie withAntonio Banderas, Salma Hayek, and Johnny Depp.
I:10187;164;There are multiple parties pulling the strings.
I:10187;165;Whether they are actually good guys is debatable.
I:10187;166;Many of the characters evolve throughout the story, and a few even become likeable.
I:10187;167;Still, she does have a memorable opening scene.
I:10187;168;overall, I tempted to give this movie 3.5 stars.
I:10187;169;I enjoyed Once Upon a Time in Mexico.
I:10187;170;Johnny Depp is wonderful in this movie .
I:10187;171;his acting style fits right in.
I:10187;172;the best actor award should go to the Actor Johnny Depp .
I:10187;173;these are some Comic moments and it is quite an entertaining Movie and i suppose thats how the Director Robert Rodriguez the young man wanted to make it.
I:10187;174;tHEN AGAIN IT IS MY VIEW and i loved it.
I:10187;175;This was a nice epic done by RR.
I:10187;176;It would've been nice to see more of Salma and Eva (yum) but overall great movie!
I:10187;177;Johnny Depp does a good job playing his role.
I:10187;178;For the first 20 minutes of Desperado I thought I was watching the greatest action movie of all time.
I:10187;179;this movie had so much potential to be good but it pales in comparison to desperado which was actually good.
I:10187;180;bang fun without the usual brain.
I:10187;181;His protagonist is one bad dude all right but it's all done in a very light.
I:10187;182;film sequence, is a truly great movie that relies almost purely on acting and a sense of reality to tell its story.
I:10187;183;Johnny Depp plays his role as an eccentric corrupt federal agent as wonderfully and with as many interesting and funny quirks as only he can.
I:10187;184;Of course Antonio Banderas is still great in his Mariachi role with the understated heroism and manliness and inner torment of the character.
I:10187;185;It's amusing and poignant and full of action as always, but it's quirkier and more varied than you might expect.
I:10187;186;It's so much bigger than the other two, and in comparison to El Mariachi (which may not be a fair comparison to make), it lacks a kind of soul amid the action and glossy references to important themes of El Mariachi's (the character's) past.
I:10187;187;I really really wanted to love this movie, but it has its ups and downs, and overall comes out somewhere in an perhaps unfortunate middle.
I:10187;188;other than the teasing quick shots of the gorgeous Salma.
I:10187;189;I really liked 'Desperado' and the wonderful earlier indie 'El Mariachi'.
I:10187;190;ups of characters as they sweat, smile, and growl.
I:10187;191;Sure!Before going to see it, there were a lot of people going around saying that Johnny Depp was fantastic, and stole the show.
I:10187;192;The former 21 Jump Street dude is a terrific actor.
I:10187;193;depp sure has a lot of screen time here, and is quite the character.
I:10187;194;our Mariachi gets caught in a lot of gunplay, and typically manages to outsmart, outshoot, and outrun every badguy out there on the streets.
I:10187;195;With mucho machoism, Banderas broods around and gives everything he's got.
I:10187;196;Eva Mendes gets to play a little bit in town as a crooked law enforcer, and Mickey Rourke is also in on the fun, as Burillo's sideman who's in hiding from the Fed'sIt sounds great, completely filmed as well as recorded digitally, and outlines and colours are very true as well.
I:10187;197;'Mexico' is big, loud, and fun, and.
I:10187;198;He always brings a difference.
I:10187;199;And as always, Banderas steals the show again as the formidable gunslinger who is a survivor.
I:10187;200;There's such a bravado in his portrayal of our hero.
I:10187;201;I think I'll watch a movie that keeps it's eyes and ears more on the hero, and less on quirky actors who are cast to steal attention.
I:10187;202;For the film savvy, there are detail.
I:10187;203;rodriguez spends devotes much of his commentary time on Mexico talking up high.
I:10187;204;definition tape filming, which he says allows directors to work at the speed of thought.
I:10187;205;Great movie, perfect mixture of comedy and violence.
I:10187;206;other than that, I also liked Antonio Banderas.
I:10187;207;the color of this film is awesome to say the least, rich in the orange tones of Mexico, shot with genius, fantastic music, lots of humor just under the surface, the characters .
I:10187;208;but for sheer entertainment and those who appreciate the study of film making, this film has all the markings of becoming a classic.
I:10187;209;Rodriguez is well on his way to joining the ranks of the film making greats.
I:10187;210;this is a great film, I see something new every time I see it .
I:10187;211;The Puerco Pibil is worth killing for.
I:10187;212;If you watch this movie and fail to make Puerco Pibil you are missing out on some of the life of this master work of art.
I:10187;213;this was a really good movie.
I:10187;214;i haven't seen an action movie this entertaining in a looooong time and action movies aren't particularly my cup of tea but this was an outstanding movie.
I:10187;215;It's got it all, drama, explosions and a great storyline as well as great acting.
I:10187;216;ONCE UPON A TIME IN MEXICO is a hoot!
I:10187;217;The sets and special effects are a terrific background for this hero adventure of El Mariachi, played to sheer perfection by Antonio Banderas.
I:10187;218;His sidekicks are the underused Marco Leonardi and Enrique Iglesias, the female pulcritude is handled with panache by Salma Hayek and Eva Mendes, and once again stealing every scene in which he appears the multitalented Johnny Depp proves that he is one of the finest sophisticated comic actors on the screen today.
I:10187;219;All of the cast members (including Ruben Blades, Cheech Marin, Willem Defoe, Mickey Rourke, etc) offer excellent cameos.
I:10187;220;Everything about this Mexican style 'Italian Western' of Sergio Leone's style works.
I:10187;221;Yes, everything is in excess, but that is the joy of the spoof of it all.
I:10187;222;Unlike most sequels, this is the best of the 3 and this is saying a lot.
I:10187;223;This one has the most action and the most humor and yet still maintains that Mariachi tone (and kind of a The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly movie tone also).
I:10187;224;Banderas is so likeable in virtually all he does and he shines here, although he is less of the star than #2.
I:10187;225;In a cast of many fine actors Johnny Depp steals the show.
I:10187;226;The culmination of all of the action takes place on the Mexican Day of the Dead.
I:10187;227;"In the end even Agent Sands shows a heroic side in a type of ""high noon"" that is in and of itself worth the price of the movie."
I:10187;228;The score is beautiful but sometimes overpowers the dialogue.
I:10187;229;a guilty pleasure that I highly recommend.
I:10187;230;Antonio Banderas returns to the role that made him a star in DESPERADO, which also made Robert Rodriguez a household name and a star out of Salma Hayek.
I:10187;231;"And this time, it plays out in epic fashion, like the final chapter in Sergio Leone's ""Man With No Name"" trilogy, ""The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly."""
I:10187;232;Star power, a smartly written story and explosive action combine to make an action.
I:10187;233;One of the best movies ever.
I:10187;234;It has all the right elements of a badass movie, and I wish they made even more of them.
I:10187;235;Some good action scenes, I give it that.
I:10187;236;"But there was a third way, still unexplored
I:10187;237;"Remember the last wish of The Mariachi when responses to his wife ""To be free"" as his supreme aspiration and undeniable bliss."
I:10187;238;visually stunning provided of a devilish, engaging, energetic and frenetic rhythm.
I:10187;239;On the plus side: Mexico and Mexicans are shown from an unusually sympathetic view.
I:10187;240;on the minus side: Here it becomes really interesting.
I:10187;241;Since film making is all about illusion anyway, I can accept this as artistic license.
I:10187;242;Anthony Bandaras and Johnny Depp are excellent in this film as, respectively, a legendary gunman who plays music and a rogue CIA agent who meets people with a fake arm so that he can hold a hidden gun with his true hand.
I:10187;243;The movie is filled with action, most of it appears impossible, which makes it more dramatic, and with strange characters, which adds humor.
I:10187;244;I choose this rating because the movie is good.
I:10187;245;What I like about the movie is that leaping back into action, gun.
I:10187;246;toting hero El Mariachi is back in town in Once Upon A Time In Mexico, as director Robert Rodriguez delivers the epic final chapter of his pulp Western trilogy.
I:10187;247;Starring Antonio Banderas, Salma Hayek, Johnny Depp, Mickey Rourke, Eva Mendes, Enrique Iglesias and Willem Dafoe Once Upon A Time In Mexico is a full.
I:10187;248;What I dislike about the movie is that I wanted to see more of it.
I:10187;249;I would recommend this movie to other people.
I:10187;250;This was a gift and I did not watch the movie.
I:10187;251;It does have some interesting gunfights in it, and some interesting characters.
I:10187;252;It is still a good action movie to see, if you don't expect much.
I:10187;253;Out of all the great movies of my my time and before it .
I:10187;254;Once Upon A Time in Mexico is the greatest.
I:10187;255;paced, spectacular movie in the making.
I:10187;256;And Salma Hayek, the hottest woman in film.
I:10187;257;a. second movies that will get your adrenaline rushing and make you watch it again and again.
I:10187;258;I promise you, if you're a Johnny Depp or Antonio Banderas fan, you'll love this awesome action.
I:10187;259;Pretty decent in a comic booky sort of way.
I:10187;260;Director Rodriguez wants to be Quentin Tarantino, and that influence shows, as does his admiration for Sergio Leone.
I:10187;261;Depp plays such a good edgy psycho.
I:10187;262;I think he's the best character actor around today.
I:10187;263;This film is good, not great.
I:10187;264;Johnny Depp is definatly the best thing about this one!!!
I:10187;265;Antonio Banderas is also good in his reprising role.
I:10187;266;But it's got oodles of action!!!
I:10187;267;El Mariachi was new, refreshing, quick, and stylistic.
I:10187;268;2 out of 5 stars or 4/10 at best.
I:10187;269;If you loved El Mariachi, you'll love this.
I:10187;270;oUaTiM has stylized shoot outs that made these films so fun.
I:10187;271;It also has the revenge.
I:10187;272;light approach that made these films guilty pleasures.
I:10187;273;Good to see Mickey Roarke back on the screen.
I:10187;274;Seeing Johnny Depp joining the film as an American agent promised a good film.
I:10187;275;parts of the movie are flashbacks, which prevent us from getting a solid flow.
I:10187;276;His character is tough as well as funny.
I:10187;277;Some of his lines will stay with you, as the director or writer seemed to make him a second focal point for the movie, which does not seem to have helped.
I:10187;278;makes this the only good thing in the movie.
I:10187;279;Johnny Depp steals the show.
I:10187;280;It's full of clever stunts and action, interesting characters and a great cast.
I:10187;281;Johny Depp especially steals the show once again like he did in Pirates of the Carribean.
I:10187;282;He loves playing strange and un.
I:10187;283;usual characters and he does it well.
I:10187;284;The guy is simply one of the best actors around and could make any movie worth watching.
I:10187;285;His character has more screen time than El Mariachi (Antonio Banderas) but who am I to complain about that because he's great in this movie.
I:10187;286;When you watch it you see that the plot is just about revenge like Desperado's was.
I:10187;287;That's ok with me though because the action and Depp's performance just carry you away and you don't care what the plot is.
I:10187;288;All the characters and actors that play them are so good though that I didn't care though.
I:10187;289;The movie is just a total good time.
I:10187;290;It's supposed to be the last one but it's so damn good that I wouldn't mind a part 4.
I:10187;291;Rodriguez has honed his full.
I:10187;292;sleek perfection, but what really sets this film apart is the awesome gallery of cool characters and intertwined subplots.
I:10187;293;banderas is fiery and wildly over the top, but it's Ruben Blades' ex FBI man that gives the film its deepest dramatic core.
I:10187;294;I found his character and story to be the most fascinating of the bunch.
I:10187;295;a. blazing whenever they damn well please.
I:10187;296;Depp and Banderas did an excellent job though.
I:10187;297;As much as I wanted to love it, something seemed to be missing from OUaTiM.
I:10187;298;Depp is suitably eccentric and chews scenery in an over the top display that easy captivates the audience.
I:10187;299;Given its place wrapping up the trilogy, it doesn't go out like a bang unfortunately, but it's still a decent piece of cinema compared to some other action flicks out there.
I:10187;300;Antonio Banderas gives a spectacular Performance.
I:10187;301;Yo, this is a really cool movie!
I:10187;302;Guns, explosions, and action galore!
I:10187;303;Robert Rodriguez always has a formula for these wicked movies, it's action.
I:10187;304;The movie's principal flaw is that it is so top heavy, you never really care about what is going on.
I:10187;305;the best thing about the movie however, is the performance by Johnny Depp.
I:10187;306;Depp (who has just been nominated for Pirates of the Caribbean) has turned out to be one of our finest stars and it is simply a pleasure to watch him act.
I:10187;307;It seems that he will inherit the mantle of Christopher Walken as America's most fun character.
I:10187;308;actor and I am recommending the movie almost entirely because of him.
I:10187;309;the gunplay, in and of itself, is interesting enough to watch in a comic book way.
I:10187;310;up, western like feel with an amazing cast.
I:10187;311;If you have seen the trailer, you've seen the best parts of the movie.
I:10187;312;Desperado is a great flick.
I:10187;313;My family loved the first two movies, but cannot enjoy the third.
I:10187;314;At least the French can enjoy it.
I:10187;315;Amazon alway ships it fast and it's safe.
I:10187;316;You see Antonio a bit, Salma comes in in dream sequences and oh somehow they had gotten married and had a child and she is basically dead in the first 10 minutes.
I:10187;317;All of the press around it showed Antonio and Salma and I figured that it was going to be about Antonio and Salma.
I:10187;318;I really wanted it to be a good movie.
I:10187;319;Desperado is a good movie.
I:10187;320;Much Much better than this one.
I:10187;321;"I personally enjoyed it
I:10187;322;life characters, stylish and fun action, and Johnny Depp.
I:10187;323;I generally am not really that interested in what goes on behind the camera, in the sense that i don't care about when to roll the cameras, how to zoom, and whatnot, but this is definitely interesting.
I:10187;324;The actors also give brief but satisfying commentary about their characters, and about doing stunts.
I:10187;325;something that this film delivers.
I:10187;326;i loved the movie, my best friend hated it, but admitted that both Mr Depp and Mr Banderas looked pretty darn good.
I:10187;327;But the second time, it was actually quite clear to me.
I:10187;328;Johnny Depp does an excellent job as usual.
I:10187;329;All in all, it was a good action film.
I:10187;330;The movie is well made and it has a dozen well.
I:10187;331;Maybe Desperado will be remembered as the one that Rodriguez got right.
I:10187;332;this is a great movie.
I:10187;333;It has a lot of big names, but the ones that really make the movie are Johnny Depp, Willem Dafoe, and Mickey Rourke.
I:10187;334;These 3 guys deliver excellent performances in this awesome conclusion to the Mariachi, Desperado trilogy.
I:10187;335;This film has action, comedy, drama, and suspense.
I:10187;336;It's got it all, and you have got to see it.
I:10187;337;Great sequel to a great series.
I:10187;338;Out of all three movies this one I like the most.
I:10187;339;Get this if you liked the other movies!
I:10187;340;Johnny Depp has been fascinating and excellent in all his movies.
I:10187;341;Eva Mendes, a normally beautiful wife, girlfriend, or agent, is the femme fatale, who helps to destroy Depp's character.
I:10187;342;Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek are always the same gorgeous actors they are in every movie.
I:10187;343;"Antonio Banderas returns as El Mariachi, our hero from ""Desperado"", who is at his best in this performance."
I:10187;344;"Salma Hayek returns as Carolina, in a much smaller role than ""Desperado"" is great in the scenes that she is in."
I:10187;345;Johnny Depp is CIA Agent Sands, who is in his best performance of his career.
I:10187;346;With the help of two of his friends, he sets off on an adrenaline.
I:10187;347;fBI agent named Ramirez, played by Ruben Blades, these three men are getting a day's worth of work in for them.
I:10187;348;This movie is brilliant with compromise, Shot in High Definition Video, which was filmed in 2001 and didn't come out until September 12, 2003, which is dynamic and brilliant work at its finest.
I:10187;349;Depp is proving to be quite the comedic and action force in movies lately, Pirates of the Carribean, Sleepy Hollow and From Hell, just to name a few.
I:10187;350;He is a wonderful talent and a pleasure to watch any time he's on screen.
I:10187;351;there are a few good things that work in the movie, and that is, the aforementioned performance by Depp, some cool special effects, namely the scene when Depp is, umm, hurt.
I:10187;352;didn't want to add any spoilers), and there is some good dialogue here and there.
I:10187;353;I thought this movie was hilarious.
I:10187;354;I liked it for the most part.
I:10187;355;wanting to come up with his own version of Once Upon a Time in the West is a big order because that is my all time favorite western, and certainly Rodriguez loves to have the camera explore every part of Danny Trejo's face the way Leone liked to pan from a wide angle shot to an extreme close up of Charles Bronson's face.
I:10187;356;the casting is very good, but the plot is just average.
I:10187;357;Salma Hayek, though an asset in any film, portrays a mere memory.
I:10187;358;Both Johnny Depp and Antonio Bandera as well as the rest of the cast do a very good job in trying to cover up for the mediocre plot.
I:10187;359;which brings me to another point.
I:10187;360;a good Mexican in the movie.
I:10187;361;Great movie and great director.
I:10187;362;I recommend this movie to all fans of this director.
I:10187;363;He has a unique style.
I:10187;364;Wow what a great movie!
I:10187;365;Robert Rodriguez is a genius.
I:10187;366;He wrote and filmed and edited and directed and did the music and EVERYTHING for this movie.
I:10187;367;I hope he stars in his next one!
I:10187;368;Antonio Banderas is hot, Salma Hayek is sexy, and Johnny Depp is so funny!
I:10187;369;Desperado was better than this.
I:10187;370;Antonio Banderas does a great job acting in both movies and so does Salma Hayek.
I:10187;371;Throughout the movie we forget this talented actor is the star of the movie.
I:10187;372;The explosive action is incredible, and including Sands (Johnny Depp) is the only thing worth raving about.
I:10187;373;Depp's role is actually the best part of this movie.
I:10187;374;Eva Mendes is in about 4 scenes but does a great job including the rest of the cast (Ruben Blades, Cheech Marin, Mickey Rourke, Willem Dafoe, and Enrique Iglesias).
I:10187;375;It is an incredible Spanish track, worth watching the entire credits!
I:10187;376;Once Upon a Time in Mexico works as both a fable and a dark comedy.
I:10187;377;Director Robert Rodriguez admittedly was having a great time playing with his digital cameras and other gadgets while making the movie.
I:10187;378;The cast of excellent actors was also having fun, and none of them took the project seriously.
I:10187;379;Although the film is rather violent in a cartoonish sort of way, it's often very entertaining.
I:10187;380;"not a great movie, ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico"" is a fun movie."
I:10187;381;soon Banderas is brought into a web of double and triple crosses involving something to do with overthrowning the president.
I:10187;382;Banderas spins, flings, soars, jumps, rolls and just does about every thing in this movie and Depp gives us another enjoyable and unforgettable character as he gets all the highlights in this movie.
I:10187;383;Good action scenes makes this third installment of Robert Rodriquez's trilogy a grand ride even though its not as good as Desperado or El Mariachi.
I:10187;384;its still bloody good fun.
I:10187;385;If you're looking for an action extravaganza with an incredible punch to it, Once Upon a Time in Mexico is the trip for you.
I:10187;386;Is it a Shakespearian masterpiece?
I:10187;387;broke adventure filled with power and entertainment?
I:10187;388;This is a film that proves to be a good time.
I:10187;389;especially for those who want a real action movie that has a unique touch to it.
I:10187;390;top at times, it's a breath of fresh air for those who have been disappointed with some of the latest action blunders.
I:10187;391;the film is Robert Rodriguez's final chapter in the El Mariachi saga, completing the trilogy.
I:10187;392;Antonio Banderas returns as the lone gunman who has a passion for guitars.
I:10187;393;ride that is both exhilarating and humorous.
I:10187;394;i really enjoyed watching Once Upon a Time in Mexico.
I:10187;395;It's a highly entertaining movie that resembles a hi.
I:10187;396;tech western filled with top.
I:10187;397;notch action sequences that are absolutely exhilarating.
I:10187;398;I can say this with confidence, as I have yet to see those two movies (although I did see parts of Desperado ).
I:10187;399;This may not be the best one in the series, but I have a feeling it is the most entertaining.
I:10187;400;the movie has an impressive roster when it comes to casting.
I:10187;401;Everybody is really great in their roles, although I have to confess that Johnny Depp is what really makes the movie.
I:10187;402;He steals every single scene that he is in.
I:10187;403;His character is a great creation and is a joy to watch.
I:10187;404;It's crystal clear and beautiful.
I:10187;405;The sound is pretty decent, although I think they could've stepped it up a notch.
I:10187;406;The featurettes are really interesting to watch.
I:10187;407;A great suggestion is to watch them after you've seen the film, and then watch the movie again right after you do that.
I:10187;408;Once Upon a Time is a great time if you're looking for an exciting action.
I:10187;409;This is one to choose if you simply want to have a good time and want to be entertained.
I:10187;410;This is certainly a film that I will be watching numerous times.
I:10187;411;The end result is a thrilling joyride from Robert Rodriguez that stands out from most of the other action flicks.
I:10187;412;Strap in and enjoy the ride.
I:10187;413;I was a big fan of EL MARIACHI.
I:10187;414;Its great heart, style, and low budget impressed me.
I:10187;415;Rodriguez, a huge fan of Sam Raimi, decided that his sequel would not be a follow.
I:10187;416;The direction was fine with Rodriguez managing to cull the only good performance Tarantino has ever given on screen.
I:10187;417;"tuned cuts made by Kaye Davis in EVIL DEAD II, Rodriguez employed a method he aptly called ""chopping."""
I:10187;418;"Yet, while Leone's Eastwood films are often called ""The Dollars Trilogy,"" each film has as much to do with one another as HALLOWEEN II and HALLOWEEN III."
I:10187;419;when it comes to the fleeting glimpses of Baderas' Mariachi, Rodriguez focuses on the happy days between Mariachi and his romantic interest, Carolina (Salma Hayek), ended in tragedy.
I:10187;420;I liked the witty humor of Johnny Depp (aka the Sexiest Man Alive) and his multiple characters.
I:10187;421;He's such a good looking guy, it just hurt my heart to see him in the state he was in.
I:10187;422;This is a great movie, but my favorite thing about it is Johnny Depp as the CIA operative.
I:10187;423;It really displays his diversity in acting.
I:10187;424;Thanks, Amazon, for another great deal!
I:10187;425;It sure appears that way with Kevin Costner's Open Range rounding up nearly $50 million in tickets sales and now Robert Rodriguez returns to Mexico in the series that made him famous.
I:10187;426;Rodriguez left the adult realm of filmmaking temporarily with much success helming the fruitful Spy Kids series.
I:10187;427;So true are these stories of mass killings by the guitar playing assassin that many of the cartels in Mexico have placed a huge price on his head and forced El to retire in isolation.
I:10187;428;the cast for the third film in the El Mariachi series is a mixed bag delivering both the good and the bad.
I:10187;429;Starting off with the good and possibly the best would be Johnny Depp who gives another fabulous performance following his exuberant role as Captain Jack Sparrow in the summer hit, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.
I:10187;430;Taking on the role of the corrupt CIA agent Sands, Johnny Depp shows he can deliver charming dark humor along with a wonderful action performance which proves he can strike lightening twice in a few months.
I:10187;431;Antonio Banderas is excellent as El Mariachi once again and quite possibly better then he was in Desperado.
I:10187;432;The close friendship between Banderas and Rodriguez shows that the actor really knows what the director wants in a lead performance and doesn't think twice about doing certain things within the feature.
I:10187;433;Salma Hayek, as beautiful and gifted as this actress is, was over hyped in promotion for this film.
I:10187;434;The decent thing to do would have had her have more important lines if not then why not just use clips of her from Desperado instead of having her featured so minimally?
I:10187;435;The cinematography is astounding except for several scenes including a scene where Johnny Depp's character shoots a man in the head in a restaurant.
I:10187;436;going public well entertained till The Matrix Revolutions arrives in November.
I:10187;437;robert Rodriguez pays tribute to Sergio Leone's Westerns with his Mariachi Trilogy, so this third chapter has been christened Once Upon a Time in Mexico .
I:10187;438;Johnny Depp puts on quite a show as the film's most incredible character, Agent Sands.
I:10187;439;But it's an unusual performance that devoted Depp fans might enjoy.
I:10187;440;The action sequences are bloody, acrobatic and even funny.
I:10187;441;ups even less, enjoyed this movie because she found it funny.
I:10187;442;fest sounds good to you, you will like this film.
I:10187;443;In Inside Troublemaker Studios , Rodriguez talks about Troublemaker Studios and shows us around the digital studio at his home in Texas.
I:10187;444;roasted pork that Agent Sands likes so much in the movie.
I:10187;445;up and prosthetics for the film.
I:10187;446;Dubbing is available in French.
I:10187;447;Subtitles are available in French and English.
I:10187;448;This move is REALLY FUNNY.
I:10187;449;A very good movie for its entertainment value.
I:10187;450;is a tale of Antonio Banderas as a superheroic gunman battling outlaws in the modern west.
I:10187;451;As indicated by the title, this is a bit of an homage to Sergio Leone's films, and this story does have a good, a bad and an ugly.
I:10187;452;The good is Banderas's gunman, a vengeance.
I:10187;453;and easily the most entertaining character .
I:10187;454;"Depp, on the other hand, is interesting
I:10187;455;beautiful setting and the audience could have been treated to an exciting western!
I:10187;456;Antonio Banderas returns in the role that made him famous with Desperado, but his character and performance is outshined by the always fantastic Johnny Depp as the mysterious CIA Agent Sands who recruits the Mariachi for his own purposes.
I:10187;457;Once Upon a Time in Mexico is nowhere as great as either El Mariachi or Desperado, and the film would probably be a clunker were it not for Rodriguez' well crafted action scenes and Depp's film stealing performance.
I:10187;458;All in all, this is worth checking out for fans of Depp or fans of the Mariachi, just don't expect much from it.
I:10187;459;so he wanted to finish the movies so he can release and talk about once upon a time in mexico.
I:10187;460;the good thing is i didnt see it with my dad.
I:10187;461;I enjoy this movie just as much as desperado.
I:10187;462;But the actors make up for it.
I:10187;463;A great conclusion to Mexico trilogy.
I:10187;464;rays, well packaged and not broken on any way.
I:10187;465;This was a very violent but fun movie to watch, with a great musical soundtrack.
I:10187;466;Robert Rodriguez's sequel to 'Desperado' and 'El Mariachi' starring Johnny Depp, Antonio Banderas, Willem Dafoe, Mickey Rourke, Danny Trejo, Ruben Blades, Eva Mendes and Salma Hayek.
I:10187;467;top action scenes that would make Rambo II look as sober as Platoon.
I:10187;468;El Mariachi was one of the most exciting viewing experiences I've ever had.
I:10187;469;The fact that it cost almost nothing to make is amazing, considering the amazing camerawork director Robert Rodriguiez used.
I:10187;470;He's funny, cruel, and brilliant, and plays the sketch of a character to a hilt.
I:10187;471;A better film would have explored the Legend of the Mariachi, and while there are hints of that movie, every time you get close to it, Rodriguiez stages bizzare shoot.
I:10187;472;When he's on, he can be fiercely entertaining and intense, such as in Desperado .
I:10187;473;You knew the plot was bad, but everyone involved in the film sold it as good action cinema.
I:10187;474;Once Upon A Time In Mexico is an epic movie, which is a follow up to the El Mariachi/Desperado franchise.
I:10187;475;The intiresting plot in this movie is that it is really part 4.
I:10187;476;robert Rodriguez is a brilliant writer/director, who edits and scores his movies as well.
I:10187;477;The action sequences are amazingly breathtaking unlike anything yet to be seen in cinema today.
I:10187;478;It is done with a certain comic book style rhythm that Rodriguez captures perfectly.
I:10187;479;His stylish and charasmatic performance as the 'Desperado' everyone loved in Desperado was in top game as he seems to really be 'El Mariachi'.
I:10187;480;johnny Depp is once again giving an amazing performance, and once again steals the movie.
I:10187;481;He is a leading man.
I:10187;482;But, when he is not supposed to be the leading man, somehow he always captures a character that is never selfish of the screen.
I:10187;483;By far his performance is the most memorable.
I:10187;484;Clearly he is the gray area.
I:10187;485;An unforgettable performance that every actor could learn something from.
I:10187;486;I watched this movie because I did enjoy the first one.
I:10187;487;He was the only part of the film that was amusing and kept it going.
I:10187;488;That one star is for Johnny!
I:10187;489;"
I:10187;490;He told us the inspiration behind the movie, the connection between this movie Quentin Tarantino, how El Mariachi came about, it's also interesting to hear from the actors actresses of reasons why they would love to work with this new generation Director.
I:10187;491;I got all the mariachi movies at once and watched them in order.
I:10187;492;I liked the first two a lot and figured that the third would also be good.
I:10187;493;However this movie did have great action sequences and besides not continuing Desperado directly was a good movie to watch.
I:10187;494;The director did a great job on this film and I loved the way it was layed out, great gunfights and I like how the director made it his own, these movies are no copies of john woo, no disrespect to him of cource but it wasnt.
I:10187;495;I was pleasantly surprised by Rodriguez's first film in the trilogy, El Mariachi: an independent effort in the good sense of the word, with signs of originality, some authentic atmosphere, and .
I:10187;496;most unusual in the thriller genre .
I:10187;497;"in the interim, Rodriguez had clearly become a ""bankable"" writer/director/you name it."
I:10187;498;once Upon a Time in Mexico has all the hallmarks of a big.
I:10187;499;ironic performance as a bent CIA agent.
I:10187;500;Antonio Banderas plays the lead again this time, along with a cast of usual suspects.
I:10187;501;Blood still flies, and Salma Hayek still looks hot.
I:10187;502;All the twists and turns in here could have easily filled a three.
I:10187;503;But with that aside, Johnny Depp is still a fabulous actor to watch, and delivers his material here with a deadpan that does Bogart proud.
I:10187;504;Danny Trejo is always a pleasure to watch.
I:10187;505;Sit back, turn your brain off, dig into the popcorn, and enjoy the ride.
I:10187;506;it has a sense of humor that you really need to get in order to sit through the movie, so unless you are looking for something very over the top and explosive, and with Johnny Depp giving a particularly awesome and iconic square off at the climax, then watch this.
I:10187;507;"With ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico,"" director Robert Rodriguez returns to his ""El Mariachi"" roots ."
I:10187;508;Rodriguez' signature style is visual inventiveness combined with wise guy humor and cartoon violence.
I:10187;509;"Once Upon a Time in Mexico is one of those films in which the actors spend most of their time winking at the camera to let us know that they're in on the joke, and the director performs somersaults with his camera to keep reminding us of just how ""cool"" and ""with it"" he is."
I:10187;510;Pretty unrealistic but remains entertaining for most of it's running length.
I:10187;511;There is little story but the crazily stylized action scenes and high body count morn than maky up for it.
I:10187;512;Depp steals every scene he is.
I:10187;513;He is the movie and everyone else is along for the ride.
I:10187;514;And the action flies high and fast.
I:10187;515;The movie has its share of great lines and dialoge, just that takes a back sent to the action.
I:10187;516;the disc is very nicely done.
I:10187;517;One of my must sees for the next year.)
I:10187;518;rOM: Test your wits in the shooting galleryRodriguez always has some of the best commentaries.
I:10187;519;Given inside stories and how to's he is always a joy to hear.
I:10187;520;this is a good action movie and a great conclusion to the El Trilogy.
I:10187;521;The first is still the best.
I:10187;522;The second one is pretty good too.
I:10187;523;Something that made the first two such a novelty.
I:10187;524;the strong cast does everything in their power to carry this movie, especially the new addition Johnny Depp.
I:10187;525;It's got an interesting premise, but the execution seems to be the problem.
I:10187;526;It's still quite fun to watch.
I:10187;527;Antonio Bandares, Salma Hayek, Johnny Depp, great actors right.
I:10187;528;I saw lots of guns, stuff blowing up, and a strange side of Johnny Depp.
I:10187;529;Robert Rodriguez's Once Upon a Time in Mexico is the last of the El Mariachi trilogy that introduced the director to the cinematic zeitgeist, and he has stuffed it full of characters, subplots and faux Mexican patriotism in a grab for prestige.
I:10187;530;And the president's advisor, a modern Brutus.
I:10187;531;There are inspired ideas .
I:10187;532;Rodriguez has managed a trilogy, all right: Once Upon a Time in Mexico is an unsatisfactory western, action and noir film.
I:10187;533;It's important to understand Hayek headlined the advertising campaign for this movie, made the talk show/magazine rounds, had star billing above Depp, no less.
I:10187;534;For that matter, so does Carolina, Hayek's persona .
I:10187;535;"for example, I really enjoyed both ""The Transporter"" and ""Triple X"", both of which are basically fluff, but fun, well made fluff."
I:10187;536;Well, I'll do the best I can.
I:10187;537;'Once Upon A Time In Mexico' is a fun movie.
I:10187;538;"top"" action is entertaining and sometimes humorous."
I:10187;539;top with his character also, a US agent (CIA?)
I:10187;540;El Mariachi is a nickname, a legend, and supposedly a dead man.
I:10187;541;Sands has to restore balance to the country, you see.
I:10187;542;But Sands has done well with his choice of El, because it was Marquez who killed El's wife and daughter, and almost killed him.
I:10187;543;It's actually much better than 'Desperato', with a lot more cheap action added.
I:10187;544;Combined with a great cast, it gives this little adventure enough 'Ummph' to make it past mediocre into lively and well.
I:10187;545;It's definitely a popcorn movie, a movie to gawk at and laugh and squeal with anticipation.
I:10187;546;Go ahead, have some fun and watch 'Once Upon A Time In Mexico'.
I:10187;547;"Antonio Banderas was wonderful AGAIN as El Mariachi in this sequel to ""Desperado""."
I:10187;548;Johnny Depp was clever and witty as the CIA agent.
I:10187;549;Loved Depp's belt buckle too.
I:10187;550;Robert Rodriguez certainely had a lot of fun to do this film.
I:10187;551;The character from Johnny Deep is incredible.
I:10187;552;make em fast,cheap,and fun and you will be on your way.
I:10187;553;So constantly, in fact, that we loose the energy to piece it all together.
I:10187;554;great actor, whose character here is so paper thin and one.
I:10187;555;All three of these roles are played very, very well.
I:10187;556;Sure, he gets top billing.
I:10187;557;in the end, I think the proper way to wrap the trilogy should have been another town, another barfight, another cute girl.
I:10187;558;"The film I have to admit is more stylish than ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Kill Bill""."
I:10187;559;There is alot more action and suspense (well not a lot of suspense).
I:10187;560;"In ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" he was great, but in ""."
I:10187;561;He really is a talented actor.
I:10187;562;Once Upon a Time in Mexico is one of those very odd movies that I love for a ton of reasons, most of which really have nothing to do with the movie itself.
I:10187;563;i'm a pretty big fan of Rodriguez, and the Mariachi flicks in particular because these were some of the first flicks that I watched in high school that opened the door to new and interesting movies I'd never considered watching before.
I:10187;564;After listening to the commentaries on both flicks I was forever spoiled by Rodriguez's amazing talent for swift, insightful, entertaining and just plain awesome commentary and have since never quite found anything that lives up to it.
I:10187;565;Hell, I even enjoyed Enrique Iglesias.
I:10187;566;When you consider all that went into this film, it's actually a wonder that it came out as well as it did.
I:10187;567;I've made it based on Rodriguez's instructions a number of times and it's now once of my favorite dishes, both to prepare and eat.
I:10187;568;This is a trilogy that I can really get behind.
I:10187;569;And who could forget the lovable body guard who's having second thoughts about his line of work and who randomly carries around a hairless Chihuahua he dressed in cute pink clothes.
I:10187;570;The movie itself is interesting.
I:10187;571;Needless to say, the principal goal of these directors is to make as much money as possible and the best way to do that is to stick to conventionality.
I:10187;572;Nowadays, solid action movies rarely come from Hollywood.
I:10187;573;a satisfying film, so me, must have a good script, good actors, and a good director.
I:10187;574;Fulfillment of the latter will often guarantee the first two conditions.
I:10187;575;The plethora of characters, worthy of a russian novel, don't seem to be talking to each other.
I:10187;576;I enjoyed this movie because I loved the other one and it is full of action, it is fun to see him pull out that Guitar Case and grab his Guns out of it and start shooting everyone
I:10187;577;over cool factor from the previous two to make it enjoyable enough.
I:10187;578;His character is compelling to watch as he quirks his way through the convoluted plot and brings a bludgeoningly sardonic element to the otherwise largely two dimensional characters.
I:10187;579;once Upon a Time in Mexico is a fair part of the trilogy and while it pales in comparison to it's predecessors, standing on its own, it is adequate enough for a good viewing.
I:10187;580;There are some that like such movies, more power to them.
I:10187;581;Great movie and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys action movies.
I:10187;582;I really enjoyed it and liked the fact that Mickey Rourke was in this one.
I:10187;583;awful!Being a fan of Once upon a time in the West and Once Upon a time in China I can safely say that this film is a franchise killer and never even came close to being in the same league as the other two.
I:10187;584;It's also my favorite movie ever.
I:10187;585;The energy, the colors, the characters, the performances, the settings, the editing, the action sequences, the cinematography, the prodiction design.
I:10187;586;Robert Rodriguez hits all the right notes in this gritty, violent psuedo.
I:10187;587;"western
I:10187;588;Some of the best one liners and action sequences you'll find in any movie, period.
I:10187;589;shoe commercials with great action scenes but i don't consider them vehicles of greatness, if you get my drift.
I:10187;590;Stretched by the hair to be sure, but nevertheless very imaginative especially when they go crash.
I:10187;591;You've got a Mariachi to go with extra cheese please.
I:10187;592;"without blinking, i thought ""wow, this tops it all""."
I:10187;593;Some of the visuals are just beautiful, and make an effective use of video scaling to higher def displays.
I:10187;594;And that's saying a lot.
I:10187;595;The writing, directing and acting are all tightly woven into a very exciting piece.
I:10187;596;Antonio Banderas (I have to admit, he's one of my favorite actors) is wonderful.
I:10187;597;Johnny Depp is wonderful as well and provides occasional much needed comic relief as the American CIA agent in Mexico who does NOT speak Spanish.
I:10187;598;Danny Trejo has an expanded role in this film .
I:10187;599;She's just as important to the story and provides a revenge motivation for El Mariachi .
I:10187;600;i enjoyed this film tremendously.
I:10187;601;This hotel escape scene comes right out of nowhere!
I:10187;602;The music IS nice, and I'm sure the soundtrack would please fans of flamenco guitar, but again it proves yet another example of how the filmakers here fail to put things together properly.
I:10187;603;He's better in some roles than others.
I:10187;604;It would have been impossible for Robert Rodriguez to top his 1995 cult masterpiece, Desperado, but he nearly does it with the magnificent film Once Upon A Time In Mexico.
I:10187;605;handedly makes this film an instant classic.
I:10187;606;His gunfight with two men, after his eyes have been gouged out, is truly one of the most incredible moments captured on recent film .
I:10187;607;funny and leaving you shaking your head.
I:10187;608;In fact, Depp's character is so raw and abrasive that you absolutely hate Sands' guts .
I:10187;609;Then he emotes such a sense of empathy and revenge that you have to root for him.
I:10187;610;Truly a remarkable performance, and a darn shame that it will be passed over come Oscar time.
I:10187;611;This is one of the best supporting roles that I have ever seen in an action film.
I:10187;612;But Robert Rodriguez, as usual, ellicits great performances from mediocre actors .
I:10187;613;a true testament to what a great director he is.
I:10187;614;The action scenes are well staged and beautifully choreographed, like a ballet.
I:10187;615;Rodriguez has truly proven with this film that he is the West's version of John Woo.
I:10187;616;Most of this film was shot by Rodriguez himself with a hand.
I:10187;617;held digital camera, giving this project an underground film feel.
I:10187;618;He keeps the action crisp and taut .
I:10187;619;with his usual heaping helping of deliciously over the top gunfights .
I:10187;620;This film will sit quite nicely along its predecesors ( Marachi and Desperado ) and O. u. a. t. i. m. will make Rodriguez's revenge trilogy this generations Man With No Name trilogy.
I:10187;621;Again, it is Depp's performance that makes this film outstanding.
I:10187;622;Eva Mendes is the other best thing about the movie!
I:10187;623;Who cares about the story, you've got tons of action, explosions, Salma Hayek, and more funny stuff!
I:10187;624;As well as the main storyline, OUATIM features numerous sub.
I:10187;625;plots with plenty of great actors.
I:10187;626;It can be a little confusing at times, but overall the movie is well worth it.
I:10187;627;There are plenty of great, over.
I:10187;628;top action scenes here that will blow you away.
I:10187;629;Director Robert Rodriguez shot this film beautifully in Mexico making it that much more enjoyable.
I:10187;630;Banderas is perfect once again in the role that he reprises from Desperado.
I:10187;631;Salma Hayek has little to do here, but who cares, she looks gorgeous.
I:10187;632;This is a great over the top action movie that never slows down from beginning to end.
I:10187;633;For a great action movie with an excellent cast, check out Once Upon a Time in Mexico!
I:10187;634;It's real star is Johnny Depp, who steals the show in every scene he is in.
I:10187;635;edited it to make it far better than now.
I:10187;636;Antonio Banderas character is recruited by force to help the assasination of the Mexican president.
I:10187;637;"I like his gadgets
I:10187;638;the cast is quite unique, making a list of character actors .
I:10187;639;see this one as another showcase for Johnny Depp's talent.
I:10187;640;this movie is pretty good.
I:10187;641;I like the ending especially,lots of guns and stuff.
I:10187;642;Johnny Depp is the man, man.
I:10187;643;He is involved in a plot to assassinate a president of Mexico.
I:10187;644;I love action movies but this is a joke.
I:10187;645;but the well done, and extremely over the top action sequences make this movie at least fun to watch.
I:10187;646;The action scenes are spaced apart well, and if you can accept the fact that they defy the laws of nature constantly, you may find something to enjoy here.
I:10187;647;Nevertheless, the style and cinematography is pleasing.
I:10187;648;Overall, the mariachi series is a fun trilogy and Rodriguez is an extraordinarily talented filmmaker.
I:10187;649;I got this to go along with El Mariachi and Desperado and because this is just a trip of a movie with a good cast and story.
I:10187;650;several of my favorite actors doing a good job and a neat wrap on Rodriguez' fable.
I:10187;651;The English sound track is Rodriguez' director's comments (also interesting)).
I:10187;652;granted, Banderas and Hayek have an amazing scene descending the front of a five story building while chained together and under fire.
I:10187;653;Johnny Depp has a few flashes and several very cool tee shirts.
I:10187;654;And there may be redeeming moments that occur after the point at which we turned it off.
I:10187;655;well, it's better that way cause this movie can not be in any way compared with the original!
I:10187;656;and It's a modern city!
I:10187;657;a person can be lucky and survive one time, possitively, two times!
I:10187;658;in their mind and create a realistic hero that children and youth can try to be like him with some effort and doing some sports!
I:10187;659;the mariachi I saw here, was a Superhuman!Anyway, this is a good action movie for one night.
I:10187;660;it has a good and reasonable story, great visuals and great actings.
