1;when Clark Gable Said that he did not give a damn, it created a wave of interest and made us laugh at the boldness of such a word as damn.
2;Movies like the poorly marketed Instinct, the much criticized but enjoyed by many .
3;A Beautiful Mind, the tame named Heaven Knows Mr. Allison, or the unusual plot of Sixth Sense, held the interest of this writer.
4;So, maybe I'm too reserved for The Departed, but the producer should be pleased that many enjoyed it enough to give it five stars,There was more, I also found this movie very disconnected and excessively violent.
5;goodfellas was great because you want to see it again immediately after viewing it.
6;so in closing was the Departed a good film?
7;and you would probably enjoy this movie .
8;or at least the status it will give you when you tell all of your school friends that you ACTUALLY saw it.
9;hitters, and that's why the film and Scorsese got an award for it.
10;Great job, and frankly, I would have expected no less.
11;to move your audience while maintaning some sense of justice, and I'm not talking about street justice or revenge.
12;In the mold of other gangster films, like 'Scarface' and 'Goodfellas,' Scorsese delivers more than a feather in his ample directing cap with his brilliant new movie, 'The Departed'.
13;star cast, 'The Departed' hits the ground and never stops running.
14;Jack Nicholson is at his ruthless best as the Irish mafia figurehead, Costello.
15;Menacingly funny, he delivers one of his most unforgettable performances with the steely subtlety that has made him a legend.
16;And they deliver this masterpiece without needing any help from Joe Pesci or Robert DiNero.
17;In his pocket at the time of Sullivan's police academy graduation, Costello finds the perfect rat to work undercover in the Boston Police Department.
18;Sullivan proves to be a savvy informant, brilliantly juggling his responsibilities as a quick, ascending officer, while bailing out the Irish mafia via cell phone.
19;toe through their harrowing treason is one of the masterstrokes of playful suspense throughout this clever flick!
20;There's a lot for both sides to figure out in the film's cat and mouse (rat!)
21;The resolution of this twisty movie should all but satisfy even the hardest core Mafioso movie fans.
22;And DiCaprio gives an inspired performance as the nerve.
23;It is brilliant how DiCaprio's and Damon's characters intersect so long without crossing each other's paths.
24;Not only effective as a plot device, it creates a fascinating tension to the movie.
25;Ironically, the plot is both complicated, yet easy to follow.
26;Unlike many similar interlocking plot stories, this one is intricate enough to be fascinating, while seldom taxing its audience.
27;The dialogue is intelligent: menacing, yet quick and witty.
28;For all its suspense and hijinx, 'The Departed' is probably the most thoroughly entertaining gangster venue since 'Pulp Fiction'.
29;great movie that never looked better!!!
30;"I know Scorsese likes to make his movies realistic so you're never gonna get the ""happy Hollywood ending"" with him."
31;The Departed is a great movie, In my opinion better then Goodfellas.
32;make of a Chinese multi part movie, although they forced everything into 1 move ( whereas the Asian original was several parts ) I thought this movie was still pretty good.
33;well it was excellent and what an ending, this has it all the love interest, backstabbing, murder, lies, everybody playing everybody .
34;I bought this as a gift, hoping it would fall into the category of movies that one can watch over and over again and enjoy (see, e. g., Harry Met Sally, Ronin, even The Italian Job).
35;it holds your interest, a perfectly fine movie, but not likely to be watched repeatedly with pleasure.
36;up Mark Wahlberg and Leonardo DiCaprio earn some respect.
37;I am SO GLAD I saw it!
38;I'm going to keep this short and sweet.
39;This film, directed by Martin Scorsese was a multiple Oscar.
40;winning crime thriller, and I would agree with them on this one.
41;studded cast gives a faultless performance.
42;The plot sounds simple and done that before, but this is a surprising movie with more twists, and suspense than you would expect.
43;It's brutal, it's honest, it's inventive, it's intriguing.
44;The cast is incredible from Leonardo DiCaprio to Jack Nicholson to Matt Damon to Mark Wahlberg.
45;The directing is great .
46;Martin Scorsese at his bloodiest and best.
47;One of Martin Scorsese's best picture.
48;Leonard DiCaprio is brilliant and is the rest of the cast.
49;Hard to predict and definitely worth watching.
50;The Departed is a remake of Infernal Affairs (2002), an excellent Hong Kong crime film.
51;This is one of the rare times where a remake surpasses the original, actually improving on it.
52;"I love the way screenwriter Monahan adapted the script for Boston
53;Damon and DiCaprio give some of the best performances of their career.
54;Nicholson is awesome as usual, but even better in the sense that he pushes the envelope and plays a character that is more than just Jack being Jack.
55;The cinematography is beautiful, as in all other Scorsese films.
56;The editing is tight and the direction, well, it's Scorsese, so it's flawless, what did you expect?As for the special features disc, it kicks butt and takes names.
57;Three very interesting documentaries (including Scorsese on Scorsese, an 85 minute sit.
58;down with the man himself"
59;disc edition, go for it, it's well worth it.
60;not since Goodfellas has a Scorsese film been so powerful and so riveting.
61;With its mix of ghoulish humor and excessive violence, The Departed is destined to become a crime classic, joining the ranks of the afore.
62;mentioned Goodfellas, Godfather saga, Scarface, and Heat.
63;He has made good musicals (New York, New York), surreal comedies (After Hours), satires (The King of Comedy) and biopics (The Aviator), but Martin Scorsese has never done better than the times he's dealt with life on the streets and gangsters.
64;But the most crucial difference is in the depiction of the underworld: whereas IA was stylish without being excessive, Scorsese's vision comprises very colorful language (some insults are so creative one might expect Joe Pesci to show up) and, of course, buckets of blood, the last part of the movie proving to be particularly shocking.
65;vice scene, but in pure Scorsese tradition it remains unflinchingly violent (also notable is the music, perfectly setting the mood, scene after scene, alongside Thelma Schoonmaker's impeccable editing).
66;on cast: Baldwin, Sheen and Wahlberg (the latter finally back on form) make good use of their little screen time, Damon fine.
67;tunes the edgier side he showed in The Talented Mr Ripley and the Bourne movies, and Nicholson, playing the villain again at last, delivers another OTT but classy turn (original choice Robert De Niro would probably have played the part with more calm and subtlety).
68;A special mention is needed for Di Caprio: working with Scorsese for the third consecutive time, he has finally found a way to shake off his Titanic image, thanks to a vulnerable, gripping (and arguably career.
69;with its clever plot, excellent acting and expert direction, The Departed is without doubt the year's best film so far.
70;endorsed picture, Scorsese can be proud, given the masterpiece he has given us.
71;Just look at the cast and you'll know right away this is a must have.
72;This movie has it all, great acting, twists, and tons of suspense.
73;Another masterpiece from the master himself, Scorcese.
74;Great movie from start to finish.
75;All the actors play their roles marvelously and the ending was epic.
76;It's paced well, the acting is great, the violence isn't excessive (in my opinion, a lot of people mention how they don't like the violent ending but come on, its a mob movie).
77;DiCaprio, Damon and Nicholson get top billing but everyone in this movie is wonderful.
78;It's great watching Nicholson get crazy and play his character a little over the top.
79;The story is great, especially since it's set in a more modern time frame rather then back in the mobs heyday (like Goodfellas and Casino).
80;Scorsese and the film deserved the Oscars they won.
81;He has managed though to work his way up and become a cop.
82;"Sullivan is one of those people who probably got straight ""A's"", stayed at home and studied while you were out playing baseball and was a loner."
83;He too has become a police officer who is well thought of and clearly on a successful path.
84;"costigan is told by one of his superior officers Oliver Queenam (Martin Sheen) that because of his background he is not really ""police material""."
85;So Queenam tells Costigan he has a special assignment for him.
86;The Departed soon takes on one of Scorsese's favorite themes, childhood loyalty.
87;"How will the Boston police ever catch Costello?The performances in ""The Departed"" are all pitch perfect."
88;DiCaprio and Damon, who get top billing, are not just the only two worth watching.
89;Even supporting characters like the ones played by Alec Baldwin and just so it's not all all boy's show, Vera Farmiga as Madolyn are both enjoyable to watch.
90;But, perhaps the most memorable performances is the one given by Jack Nicholson.
91;The sheer exuberance of his performance makes the screen come alive.
92;office numbers (this marks Scorsese's highest box.
93;office debut) people are responding well to this film.
94;It is a powerful, well made gangster film that is about more than violence.
95;As I said it is about loyalty and who we choose to give that loyalty to.
96;This is one of the best films of the year!
97;In fact the movie is so good I'm sure Scorsese will lose another Oscar race, just as his best films always do.
98;line: One of the year's best films.
99;The Departed finds Scorsese going back to the gritty mean streets of his past and makes this remake a work of his own.
100;otherwise it had a ton of great actors which definitely made this a must see movie
101;Thoroughly enjoyed the rough and tumble gangster story set in the heart of Boston.
102;i gave it two stars because I think that someone else may give it a single star and we can added it up.
103;I had read the rave reviews when it was released(and tonight i checked Rotten Tomatoes to make sure I was recalling the hype correctly), and being a lifelong Scorsese fan, I anticipated a typically absorbing, emotionally involving, and thought provoking film experience.
104;The film lacked the verisimilitude and honest emotional core typical of Scorsese's work.
105;This movie is great if you have about two hours to pay close attention.
106;The cast is full of familiar faces and interesting swirls of how the individual characters connect.
107;This movie bridges the reality of the Whitey Bulger, with the dramatic fiction that keeps the audience engaged until the end.
108;This is one of the few movies i can watch over and over again .
109;The Departed was a thrilling movie with excellent acting by Leonardo Di Caprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg and the rest of the cast.
110;This is a movie about an inside investigation into the mob in Boston.
111;this is a R rated movie and I would say a HARD R movie.
112;This is action packed from start to finish.
113;i bought it on black friday and i got it on the monday after.
114;i got it in 4 days.
115;I rarely watch thrillers but I enjoyed this one a lot.
116;What can I say about this film other than its a outstanding film?
117;Its very exciting and fun film to watch.
118;I loved Dicapio, Nickelson, Damon, they rock as actors.
119;The music was excellent and Tony Leung's performance was spellbinding, but the movie was hard to follow.
120;I really liked him in Gangs of New York and Catch Me If You Can, but this performance was over the top.
121;Having said that, I can't really think of another character's performance in The Departed that is worth mentioning.
122;Scorcese did so much better work in Gangs of New York and Goodfellas, one of my favorite films.
123;Definitely the the type of movie that makes it worth going to the theater.
124;I was just glued to the chair without blinking my eyes.
125;One of the greatest gangster thriller (if not greatest suspense) of 2000's.
126;Full of twists and turns.
127;what a gripping rollercoster ride.
128;caprio should have won best actor for this movie.
129;Fantastic direction of Martin and excellent screenplay.
130;The acting in this movie was great!
131;He was TERRIFIC in both of those movies.
132;this is just my opinion but it is something I have been thinking a lot about lately.
133;The original Hong Kong film (which is part of the trilogy) is much more suspenseful and clever than this remake.
134;The US version is still pretty good.
135;A must see if you love film.
136;Dicaprio and Damon are wonderful.
137;It has been a long time since i saw such a great movie.
138;There are also surprises which is great.
139;"*** This comment may contain spoilers ***Coming in to ""The Departed"", I was lucky to already know what the plot was about (some trailers are so obscure as to not mention anything about the plot, to hide the fact that it sucks) and it got four stars (highest rating) in my local newspaper's movie reviews, with lots of great mention on acting and drama and directing."
140;the movie was very well.
141;the final scene is that of Sullivan's balcony, with a view of the golden dome church, and a rat on the banister sniffing something.
142;climactic for a movie which was building up so much intensity, complexity, and drama.
143;The story is quite interesting.
144;Martin Scorsese finally won the Oscar the whole world felt he was owed in 2006 when he made this new age crime thriller.
145;Scorsese actually has a slick resume filled with much more than `GoodFellas' and `Casino'.
146;One of the most rewarding things about `The Departed' is that it is so unpredictable.
147;along the way lots of people die.
148;instead of trying to analyze the plot (which I'm sure a lot of you who have yet to see this will thank me for in the long run) I'm going to tell you why this film is worth your time.
149;Martin Scorsese is a master of the lens and crafts a genuinely intriguing and breakneck paced thriller that never runs too long and never loses you.
150;Despite everything that gets thrown your way, the film is actually very easy to follow.
151;It also sports one of the best ensemble casts of that particular year (forget `Little Miss Sunshine').
152;Everyone involved is really at the top of their game.
153;Leonardo DiCaprio is stellar here, truly phenomenal, and delivers what may be his finest performance to date.
154;He is completely aware of what makes Billy so essential to the audience, creating a likable, understandable and identifiable character who is also exciting.
155;He doesn't have the same energetic draw that DiCaprio has, but he manages to make his character just as engaging.
156;"so this brings me to the films drawback
157;It's a great movie, don't get me wrong.
158;It succeeds in doing so much, and like I said, even though the films ending can be rendered a `flaw' it is also a HUGE selling point (you'll never see this one coming) so in the wise words of Benicio Del Toro, """"take the good."""""""
159;But I can say that The Departed is a great movie that is a must.
160;the two men each keep their loyalties to their actual employers at great cost to themselves.
161;"one of the main themes of the film has to do with the duality of Costigan and Sullivan
162;every cylinder is firing in this film"
163;The film deserves all the awards it has received and is nominated for, and hopefully, Scorsese will finally win the Best Director Oscar.
164;It has an allstar cast of all my favorite actors, and they all play everything perfectly.
165;Martin Scorsese directing all the talented actors with a plot this great made it the easy choice for the oscar's best picture choice.
166;One of the few good movies Hollywood has put out.
167;Would recommend this movie Highly to anybody.
168;There are things I liked about Martin Scorcese's The Departed .
169;Having said all that, The Departed is good but far from great.
170;This classic Scorsese film has it all.
171;I was prepared to take a snobbish view that the original was far superior.
172;Adding to my skepticism was a neat little line I read in the press to the effect that Hollywood had just bestowed upon Martin Scorsese its Best Picture prize for what is, by most opinions, approximately Mr. Scorsese's sixth.
173;Anyway, surprise, surprise: 'The Departed' is brilliant on its own merits.
174;William Monahan's brilliant adaptation .
175;The result is a hand.
176;These three guys are outstanding.
177;Damon continues to choose great roles and perform brilliantly in them.
178;He's the key to the film, having to sell the covert version himself both to his police superiors and the movie audience.
179;He goes for the full.
180;It's a relatively small part, but Wahlberg completely steals every single second he's on the screen.
181;He deserved that Oscar nomination.
182;Very good and intense movie.
183;Good acting by J Nicholson (as always), M Sheen, L Dicaprio, M Damon and M Wahlberg.
184;Awesome cast, great film that you will enjoy over and over!
185;Definitely a favorite of mine!!
186;A lot of violence, however, the acting is so good that it makes up for that.
187;I love Jack Nicholson, which is the only reason I picked up this film.
188;a bloody conclusion worthy of crime film fans.
189;The camera work is good, and so is the acting.
190;I got a good laugh out of several of them.
191;This was a very entertaining movie, it had a surprising ending that you will either love or hate.
192;In this flick, we have Scorsese going back to his traditional roots.
193;The movie keeps you to the edge of your seat from the very first scene.
194;up of the characters is very well done, but the real thrill starts when the two lead actors have to find each other out.
195;DiCaprio's magnificent performance, along with equally admirable performances given by Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Jack Nicholson, and Vera Farmiga, this movie is a must see.
196;Coupled with Scorsese's poignant direction, this is definitely an Oscar contender.
197;Martin Scorsese's genius is written all over it.
198;The dialog, contrary to another reviewer who says the script sucks, is as entertaining as any I've ever seen.
199;time favorite Jack Nicholson film.
200;But he is just mesmerizing in every scene he's in.
201;The exteriors are gritty and authentic looking but there is so much action going on who is looking at buildings?
202;I just find the story, the actors, and the great music, perfect from start to finish.
203;Even though I have seen it many times I still find something new and fresh every time I watch it.
204;i am so happy I was born around the same time as Mr. Scorsese and was an adult when his first came out.
205;Certainly the greatest mind the film industry has ever produced.
206;Great movie, top notch actors.
207;Everyone did a great job, Martin Scorsese does it again!
208;I have a new appreciation for Leonardo DiCaprio.
209;This is a movie is awesome!
210;I'm so glad martin scorcese finally won a well deserved Oscar for it!
211;Its a must have addition to your video library, Its definitely a new crime classic!
212;Its well written screenplay is based in part on bostons one and only whitey bulger (leader of the winter hill gang) Its acting at its finest, as well as directing!
213;The action and intrigue keeps you glued to the very end.
214;the movie upon its opening starts pulling you in with layered characters, all of which lie or deceive each other in various ways.
215;By the time the movie begins to approach its climax, you believe you see where it's going when suddenly.
216;The ending takes a twist that few stories would never dare to take.
217;From the acting of DiCaprio (whom I actually despised prior to watching this gem) to Nicholson to Damon and Wahlberg, all the roles are perfectly cast and acted out from beginning to end.
218;"Unless you're one of those who saw the original ""Internal Affairs"" and is afraid to admit that something new is as equally brilliant to the old in its own ways."
219;"The Departed, based on an Asian thriller called ""Infernal Affairs"", is, simply put, a masterpiece."
220;Captain Oliver Queenan (Martin Sheen) and the brash, explosive and often hilarious Officer Dignam (a scene stealing Mark Wahlberg) have Costigan go undercover and infiltrate Costello's gang.
221;at first, both sides' plans are working well.
222;Sullivan gets involved in a sensual affair with a smart and beautiful police shrink named Madolyn (the unknown Vera Farmiga, who holds her own incredibly well against such a talented cast, which causes him to question some of Frank's motives, while Costigan is rapidly closer to the edge.
223;He knows Franks suspects that he's the rat, and he can't handle the pressure for much longer.
224;overall, the film is a masterpiece.
225;The film is well written.
226;"The dialogue, which is often laced with profanity as well as hilarious quotes that Tommy DeVito from ""Goodfellas"" would be proud of, is incredibly natural."
227;"scorsese really makes the tension of the film really come alive with the correct camera angles, songs (""Gimme Shelter"" suits the film perfectly) and score."
228;This has always been a trademark of his movies, and he shows his talents with it here.
229;DiCaprio is spellbinding as Costigan, belying the character with a bristling intensity that he uses to great force throughout the film.
230;Damon is also pitch perfect in his portrayal of Sullivan.
231;He imbues the character with the right mix of filth and charm.
232;Nicholson is cleary having a blast playing an over the top charactor that suits his one a of a kind acting talents perfectly.
233;Only Scorsese can bring the best out of all these actors.
234;He's easily the greatest living director of today's day and age.
235;"overall, ""The Departed"" is a masterpiece through and through."
236;It is a film I recommend to anyone with half decent taste in cinema, as only someone with the lowest standards of film viewing would not enjoy it.
237;Acting from all superstars is phenomenal and story is engaging.
238;Would recommend it for all people who love serious drama.
239;well recorded, world class singer,world class band.
240;the better your a/v system the better it sounds.
241;A very adult story full of contradiction and complexity and a raw.
242;a superb film that may not be wildly popular with a general audience but is welcome work for those who are ready for a savage and un.
243;Tough stuff but well worth it.
244;A great movie for all those that like crime movies.
245;Ironically, the film and its soundtrack make an appearance in Series 6 of The Sopranos.
246;One of the best tracks on the soundtrack to The Departed is Comfortably Numb which features Pink Floyd and Van Morrison.
247;One of the best movies I have seen.
248;Great job Leonardo, Jack Best movie in the last 10 years blu ray is great
249;Sullivan keeps Costello tipped off, and in.
250;Sullivan gets yet another promotion, but this time his job is to find the rat inside the force.
251;I knew these were two things that Martin Scorsese was a master of, so I was very eager to see his take on the story.
252;Exactly as I predicted, The Departed is a much deeper version of the story.
253;As well, the dialogue benefits greatly from this, and it's simply great!It's a very rare thing for such a stellar cast as featured in this film to be used so well.
254;Here everyone's presence is strongly felt, and it's a wonder to behold such a cast working on such a strong film under one of the greatest film directors in history.
255;Jack Nicholson reminds us of why he's the legend he is.
256;Leonardo DiCaprio slams the lid on naysayers, and even Mark Wahlberg's performance is so good he blends right in with the amazing talent around him.
257;"The ending to Infernal Affiars was deep and thoughtful, while by comparison, The Departed feels almost cliche and very much like a ""Hollywood Ending."
258;The Verdict:The Departed is easily the best crime drama since Heat.
259;Martin Scorsese was born to make films like this, and this film is easily his best film since Goodfellas which coincidentally or not so coincidentally share common themes.
260;In this film he masterfully weaves a complicated web of intrigue and deception.
261;Easily one of the best movies I've ever seen.
262;A friend of mine recommended this movie to me and I decided to check it out.
263;With a packed cast (which I need not mention) that includes great supporting roles by Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin, the acting in the departed is stellar.
264;legend Jack Nicholson flawlessly delivers one of his best performances in years as the execrable mob boss Frank Costello.
265;Funnier that most comedies, Scorsese is still able to amplify the bloodshed and meticulously deliver a stunning cinematic achievement.
266;scorsese has taken a great film and turned it into a masterpiece with breathtaking violence and superb character development.
267;I really enjoyed this movie.
268;I think it is Martin Scorcese's best movie ever, and he has made some extremely good movies.
269;This is a great movie about police corruption and the illicit activities of a band of criminals.
270;The directing, story telling, and ending are superb!
271;It is a very SERIOUS/SCARY movie, Actors are superb.
272;This will make a great gift for those who can take the 'action/killing/blood/gore.
273;One of my favorite movies ever.
274;The other goes undercover and goes to work for Nicholson.
275;So they are both working for the police (one honestly, one not), and both working for Nicholson (one honestly, one not).
276;This is an awesome movie!
277;If you enjoyed Running Scared, Seven, or any other twisted police drama/action film, you will enjoy this one!
278;Is this his best movie in years and years?
279;Is it one of his best movies?
280;Well, I can tell you that this is a fine, fine film done with such artistry and talent from Marty, as everyone calls him.
281;I am not always an easy sell on crime/mobster type films, but you can't help but be intrigued by the magnitude of talent going into this, and the big acclaim that came upon it's release.
282;The Departed may not be the best film ever made, but it's a great film, and the best film of the year.
283;The result is a tense and taut cat and mouse thriller as the two moles try to discover the other's identity.
284;DiCaprio really starts to become an adult movie star here.
285;He is grown up, dark, and wonderful in the role.
286;"There is a bit of ""Jack"" here, but that's okay."
287;Wahlberg is great in the role.
288;The film is done with delicate care and talent.
289;It was exciting, and it seems that no one is safe.
290;It keeps you on your toes.
291;The relationship between Jack and his mole and his new buddy(Leo), makes for some interesting storytelling and twists and turns.
292;The characters are deep and fully fleshed out, the story keeps you interested, and the music used in the film and the score are perfect.
293;All in all, it's a great film.
294;While people continue to voice their thoughts on how this ranks in Scorsesse's roster of films, and how this was(or was not)his best film since whatever, all I can say is that this is a Scorsesse picture.
295;And it's a damn good one.
296;This is a great movie two thumbs up awesome cast a e i o u y h j k l
297;This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.
298;Leo DeCaprio is awesome in this, and that's coming from someone who doesn't like him at all!
299;I had never seen this before and am happy I bought it, good classic to own.
300;that it was worth cringing a bit at times.
301;I believe understanding the Irish way of life is extremely important in order to get what the movie is about.
302;There's a lot of detail which can be a bit tricky the 1st time around.
303;Having said that, it really is an excellent and engrossing and entertaining movie.
304;All the actors did a great job .
305;I usually can't stand Nicholson's hambone emoting but he was good in this part.
306;Like I said, all the plot twists and turns and the details were somewhat hard to follow at 1st, but watch it again and it all makes perfect sense.
307;see movie with a great storyline and excellent acting all around.
308;Gripping and a strong solid cast.
309;The movie is very unpredictable.
310;I watched the trailer on this movie and thought it would be good.
311;The picture and sound are very good.
312;got exactly what I ordered .
313;Well, I'm a Martin Scorsese fan today, I was one yesterday, and I will be one tomorrow.
314;How astonishing it is that this auteur, so late in his career, continues to direct and create such top shelf productions like The Departed and Gangs of New York.
315;the Departed is both action picture and psychological drama.
316;"He's spectacular in this role
317;One of The Departed's most intriguing sub.
318;The subtext definitely is provocative, but you will probably not think of that the first time you see The Departed.
319;The action is so intense that it is a challenge to get beyond thinking about what will happen next.
320;This film represents more brilliant work from the most brilliant man in Hollywood.
321;In particular I thought that Jack Nicholson was good.
322;it had many interesting twists.
323;still it was a decent movie.
324;I enjoyed this movie and especially the Two disc set with its behind the scenes information on the true events that inspired the story.
325;It is a good movie, suspensful and intriging with many twists and double crosses that completely absorb the viewer.
326;Bought used for a steal and works flawlessly!My favorite movie of all time.
327;This is an entertaining movie but nothing new.
328;DiCaprio's and Damon's performances are almost over.
329;Everything and everyone is a blast of machismo and bravado which is ultimately funny because Damon's character turns out to be a """"closeted"""" homosexual."""
330;There is always the ever present Scorcese signature quick cuts and slo.
331;Watch this movie twice and you will wonder why you did.
332;Great action, good story line and suspense.
333;this is a good movie.
334;the story is a bit unsettling, but it so well done.
335;if the price is right, add it to your collection.
336;Scorsese, DiCaprio And Nicholson Are Awesome !!!
337;After watching The Departed I pretty much knew that this was the movie that would finally win Martin Scorcese an Oscar for best director.
338;so there was a tremendous sense of the familiar when I watched The Departed.
339;You can tell that Scorcese's job is making movies, but he definitely loves his job.
340;The two men work against each other at every turn, and they both engage in a cat and mouse game to try and outwit the other.
341;the performances are uniformly good throughout the movie.
342;His performance is no where near as dynamic as DiCaprio's, but he is mostly convincing as Sullivan.
343;Nicholson mostly hams up his performance as Costello, but it adds some comic relief to the movie.
344;She is in love with two men who lead false lives, but she tries to stay genuine and authentic throughout.
345;All three put in great performances as well.
346;the music is also a high point in the movie.
347;The well placed Dropkick Murphy's tune I'm Shipping Up to Boston adds an interesting sense of dread to the movie.
348;The rest of the music, even the score is also very effective.
349;this movie is highly recommended and ranks of one of Scorcese's best films.
350;He may not be breaking any kind of new ground with The Departed, but he keeps refining his craft and is on top of his game.
351;All I want is what I ordered.
352;"This was a great movie with great acting, directing,editing, music score
353;This is a great Crime/Mob Drama.
354;Very enjoyable movie with a lot of WTF moments.
355;The acting in this movie was very good.
356;But then again, women are never very smart in Scorsese films.
357;This is Marty at his best.
358;Leo, Damon, Nicholson, and Whalberg all give stunningly great performances.
359;I highly recomend this masterpiece of a film to any Scorsese fan.
360;This movie has all the actors, all the action, and all drama to keep you entertained the whole way through.
361;Beside that strong supporting cast, including Jack Nicholson as the mafia boss and Mark Wahlberg as a hot.
362;in general a great movie fun to watch.
363;I grew up in Boston and this was the most realistic movie of the area and the Irish Mafia .
364;I typical don't enjoy this types of movies ( Crime and Mob stuff ) but I actually enjoy.
365;the stories of the respective """"rats"""" run absolutely parallel (including the same love interest), so the plot sounded interesting to me."""
366;I stayed with it to the end hoping it would have a satisfactory conclusion.
367;The plot is amazing and the screenplay even more amazing.
368;This and the movie it was based on are some of the best gangster movies ever made.
369;This and the Godfather are the two best gangster movies ever made.
370;The music score for the background effect is unparralled in the original.
371;"Although casted w/ remarkable, renowned actors, the Departed characters just didn't mix and match well and ""departed"" themselves from dramatic flavor that defines and balances the whole movie."
372;See the original and its bonus feature and you'll know what I'm talking about.
373;Asians love American flicks, we'll see how this movie does over there, and if they've seen the original, this one just might be deported.
374;This features Jack Nicholson at his mephistophelean best as a Boston gangster.
375;The screenplay is exceptionally well written, and the entire castdid a terrific job.
376;Despite the flaws, It's an enjoyable film.
377;As many reviewers have said before me, Scorsese is indeed one of the great directors of our time.
378;"With his adaption of the Hong Kong film ""Infernal Affairs"", he once again delivers a solid and entertaining story from a world of gangsters and thugs.You probably read a summary of the story, so I won't bother you with that."
379;"The story progresses in pretty much the same way as ""Infernal Affairs"", adding a few elements here and subtracting a few there to make it fit it's new surroundings."
380;The cinematography is, of course, very well.
381;It is very well directed and well edited.
382;Also the cast (superstar or not) delivers good performances throughout the film.
383;Especially I think, Jack Nicholson and Matt Damon act their parts particularly good.
384;He basically acts the way you'd expect Jack Nicholson to act and that suits the character he plays just perfectly.
385;Damon seems like a very slick, charming, witty, and ambitious kind of a chap, which incidently is also traits of the character he portrais in this film (which by coincidence is also the case of Liu Dehua who plays Damons role in the original Chinese movie).
386;The rest of the cast, as said, also delivers very good performances, which you might expect seeing that in every other shot you've got yet another star playing a minor role.
387;even though I'm still slightly biased towards the Chinese version (only because I saw it first, and one shouldn't compare them anyways), I still think this is a very solid film worthy of all the good things being said about it.
388;disc version are also very interesting.
389;I particularly enjoyed the portrait of Scorsese.
390;definitely worth watching, highly recommendable.
391;Not for the easy stomach, but excellent acting all the way around.
392;This movie even has a small amount of who.
393;it twists and turns at the end, even though we know everyone's role throughout the movie.
394;If you know the Whitey Bulger story from South Boston, you'll enjoy Jack Nicholson's twists.
395;Great soundtrack, as usual, for Scorcese, a music lover.
396;The cat and mouse game at the movie's center is riveting, if silly.
397;Even so, this one is a keeper.
398;One of the best Scorsese films.
399;It's a fantastic movie, and definitely deserves a spot on your shelf.
400;My favorite movie of all.
401;This is a great irish mafia, gangster movie.
402;Te director and cast are all A. listers and the movie has a lot of action and twists.
403;Best movie of 2006, by far!
404;This is a great film with great actors.
405;Movie version of real life Boston gangster Whitey Bulger.
406;Jack Nicholson is incredible as always.
407;Arrived on time and in perfect condition.
408;Happy to have this movie on Blu.
409;Hugely influential and critically acclaimed director Martin Scorsese is notorious for his numerous gangster movies, including such time.
410;tested classics as Mean Streets and Goodfellas.
411;The Departed is his latest foray into the crime genre and is well on its way to becoming his best yet, despite the short amount of time it has seen in wide release.
412;Before long, both Costigan and Sullivan start expressing suspicions to their superiors of an inside man that's leaking information.
413;worthy performance by DiCaprio becomes the core of the film's anxious pacing and serves as a brilliant constrast to the charismatic charm and shameless ambition of Matt Damon's Sullivan.
414;Jack Nicholson's turn as the completely amoral Costello provides an abundance of genuine laughs and ominous chills and would likely steal the scene every time were it not for the enormous talent working along with him.
415;The Departed is a film that succeeds on every level, ranking among Scorsese's best work and, like those other works, will undoubtedly be revered by many as a classic of the crime genre for both embracing the genre's traditions and boldly defying its storytelling conventions.
416;Also like the Asian production, this American remake boasts an all.
417;hitting and bloody drama that starts out like a sure Oscar contender with cutting edge, politically incorrect dialogue delivered in narrative form by Jack Nicholson.
418;definitely worth seeing, but not a classic.
419;The story line is pretty damn epic.
420;That's all I have to say.
421;"Film buffs will likely continue to debate the merits of ""The Departed"" for years."
422;Does the film that finally earned a long overdue Oscar for director Martin Scorsese (as well as the Best Picture prize) rank with his best work?
423;The Departed is a terrific, complex thriller, the first epic cops and robbers flick since Al Pacino faced.
424;"there are quite a few twists and turns including two shocking deaths, but though it may be more entertainment than art, ""The Departed"" is a worthy addition to Scorsese's filmography, and a perfectly respectable choice with which to honor him with Hollywood's highest honor."
425;The cast is terrific, of course, with Wahlberg stealing every scene he's in and Martin Sheen, Vera Farmiga, and Alec Baldwin offering fine support.
426;The cast in this movie is amazing!
427;I love the plot, Wahlberg is excellent as is Damon and DiCaprio.
428;Brings me home to Boston :)
429;This movie is a masterpiece.
430;Scorceses use of tracking shots and slow mo sequences take you back to the movies that made this man great.
431;Scorcese has put together what is arguably one the best casts in movie history.
432;Every actor in this movie finds time to chew the scenery without going over the top Pacino style which is a testament to Scorcese and his directing skills.
433;This is a man who got Paul Newman his 1st elusive Oscar and let Joe Pesci run amok in Goodfellas in what is one of the all time great mafia hood portrayals.
434;This movie is a very good piece of cinematic art.
435;Yes, it won Best Picture and a lot of other awards.
436;It's unbelievably good, right up there with Scorsese's best work, and although I often disagree with the Academy, I really do believe it was the Best Picture of 2006.
437;The film is so rich with wonderful, powerful performances across the board, and the script is so entertaining and tense, filled with dynamic, hilarious characters and scenes that just jump out at you.
438;"Stylistically, it's much more of a police procedural along the lines of some of the great television shows out these days like ""The Wire"" and ""The Shield""."
439;And the fact that it's an entertainment and not a grandiose, Oscar.
440;"shilling ""important film"" is what makes it all the more successful and truly a great pleasure to watch."
441;what can I say a star studded cast , great plot, twists, and turns.
442;All around a great movie.
443;Over the years, he has produced some brilliant stuff.
444;the Departed is a true classic in the genre of film noir dramas.
445;It truly depicts three loners bucking against the system in quite unique ways in order to make names for themselves.
446;i loved the performances all around.
447;That's why I love his character so much.
448;I also love the fact that Scorcese gave Nicholson a great amount of artistic leeway in his scenes in order to truly develop his character.
449;This movie has an all star cast with an all star performance that kept me on edge my seat until the very end.
450;By now, you must know how amazing The Departed is and how many awards its piled up since it was release.
451;This is a great movie made even better with a 2.
452;The extras are surprisingly interesting for this intense cop drama/thriller.
453;I can't believe this is the film that finally won Martin Scorsese his Oscar.
454;it has to be a make.
455;This was a vastly overrated movie, with a mildly interesting subject matter that has been overplayed the last several years.
456;Close your eyes and imagine people speaking like that to one another.
457;A look at the picture means that this review contains spoilers, so you may want to stop reading now.
458;the acting is excellent (with a nod towards DiCaprio) and the script fraught with tension at times.
459;is the overuse of music.
460;Typically Scorsese overwhelms the audience with operatic arias and seventies rock.
461;For the first hour of the film the music never stops!
462;Music starts, and stops, and re.
463;starts beyond the bounds of good editing.
464;ringtones and sounds as well as as plot devices.
465;adds greatly to the tension.
466;furthermore the film jumps about in both the beginning and middle.
467;movie, disconnected completely from the rest of the plot (as we have plenty of evidence of Frank Costello`s evil nature prior to this scene, it serves only to disorient.)
468;loud moments and solid dialogue show Willam Monahan`s Oscar to be justified (he won for Best Adapted Screenplay.)
469;related film Scorsese has touched.)
470;It adds some flavor but also some bulk.
471;all in all, a decent film.
472;I loved this film!THE DEPARTED is an intense cops and gangsters opera with an all.
473;star cast, including Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg.
474;Jack Nicholson, as sociopathic crime boss Frank Costello, is excellent as always.
475;Leonardo DiCaprio's role as Billy Costigan, going straight from Cadet to undecover, in my opinion is his best performance yet.
476;set in modern day South Boston, involving the Irish Mob and the Massachusetts State Police, THE DEPARTED is a tale of two young guys entangled in that old Irish.
477;american dilemma of love and respect for both outlaw and cop, the two often freely intermingling within neighborhoods and families, blurring identities and allegiances.
478;star cast preformed their roles beautifully.
479;this is a Scorsese film.
480;The Departed is a mind.
481;The acting is amazing and the story will never be forgotten.
482;It makes us want to watch how two men that came from the streets of the city are drawn to the state police.
483;Superb cast, great sets and camera work, and decent music make it a must see for adults.
484;this is one of the best dramas I have seen in years.
485;Scorsese once again shows us what a master he is as a director.
486;They make you feel their roles and pull you into this riveting story of how two kids from the streets grow up fighting to make it.
487;Their lives are messy and they try to keep them together the best they can.
488;The complexities of characters here makes for excellent acting.
489;If you like action packed movies, then this is the one.
490;Loved this movie and wanted to be sure that the residents at the Nursing Home my mother is in will be able to enjoy it.
491;Many of them have expressed an interest in watching a good movie on a Sunday afternoon.
492;One of those movies you can watch over and over, like Pulp Fiction.
493;Even though Jack N has become a parody of himself, he is decent.
494;If he's in the movie, see the movie.
495;This isn't even Scorsese's masterpiece which lets you know how strong his resume is, but it was worthy of his academy award.
496;There are so many twists and turns, this movie will keep you in your seat, even viewing it at home.
497;I liked to have bought it directly from Brazil.
498;I've seen a number of scornful and disrespectful things over the years, but Martin Scorsese's prophecies really take the cake.
499;newspapers, magazines, billboards, movies, op.
500;He has never gotten ahead because of his hard work or innovative ideas.
501;Your guess is as good as mine as to why Martin wants to influence the attitudes of dominant culture towards any environment or activity that is predominantly headlong.
502;As if that were something to be proud of.
503;If the answer is yes, then we can conclude that this is a lesson for those with eyes to see.
504;I have one final message for you before ending this letter: I indubitably gainsay Martin Scorsese's notion that he is a bearer and agent of the Creator's purpose.
505;another excellent movie that i sent to my nephew serving in the military.
506;Lots of stars in it.
507;great acting great music sexy actors.
508;Sad Leo got shot in end kind of shocking actually
509;This is a great film with a twist.
510;Love the actors in it, they did a great job.
511;the movie came quick and in perfect condition.
512;the seller even emailed me to ensure I had received it and in the right condition.
513;Powerful dialogue and unexpected plot twists.
514;Matt Damon delivers an explosive performance: so believable!
515;DiCaprio is at his best!
516;I recommend this movie to those who are interested in gangster flicks!
517;We enjoyed wathcing it together.
518;You know, Scorcese won the Golden Globe for best director for this movie.
519;"Literally, every other character is a total scumbag person and I am including the ""good"" guys of the film."
520;"I do think the movie was very entertaining and enjoyable
521;This is a movie that'll keep you on the edge of your seat.
522;Hey I love any movie that has Martin Scorsese's name stapled on it.
523;Tons of F. bombs, violence, solid acting, and a solid story line.
524;The rest is all Scorsese.
525;Who cares, the movie was amazing and that what counts, despit countless remakes there has been recently, here's one filmmaker who actually gives a s888.
526;This is a must see movie, so if you like Dicaprio you'll love this movie.
527;I give it four stars.
528;It's clear he got the sympathy vote .
529;well deserved for Good Fellas among others .
530;An average episode of The Sopranos is far more entertaining, and better written, than this.
531;And the coup de grace in the film's last scene: .
532;My wife and I howled with laughter!
533;I would give this 2 1/2 stars actually.
534;see 'Gangs of New York', making him, along with Woody Allen, one of America's most over.
535;rated directors (and both are identified with NYC!)
536;What is most memorable about the depiction is the comedy.
537;act in the Sean Penn way here, but neither of them are very believable as white tough guys from the mean streets either.
538;Ok, I saw this in the theatres and have to say this is some of his finest work.
539;I thought """"The Aviator"""" was more of an epic."""
540;biopic, and beautiful and engaging to watch.
541;Now Million Dollar Baby was good, bur not Best Director worthy.
542;"So anyway, ""The Departed"", an excellent film, and really breaks away from Scorses's typical mob film."
543;ray because, well I can do Blu.
544;This was a great movie, especially when compared with most movies of the 21st Century, but it was not an original concept.
545;I loved both movies, but I felt the acting was superior in this modern adaptation.
546;But, Mark Wahlberg shines around some heavyweights.
547;And while I'm not a big Leonardo fan, he is great in this movie.
548;Scorsese adapts to modern technology and modern crime briliantly.
549;It is not as revolutionary a film as Taxi Driver but it is one of the best films of the past 5 years.
550;it will play on the regular side.
551;Overrated and clearly merited only as a lifetime achievement award for Martin Scorsese.
552;Jack is unbelievable and all the other actors, Great Movie.
553;The performances from Leonardo DiCaprio and Jack Nicholson alone are worth giving this film five stars.
554;When you incorporate all of the history of race relations in Boston, and Scorsese's unparalleled ability to tell a story you end up with the Oscar winner for film of the year.
555;there are a lot of great quotes and lines throughout the movie.
556;"The man answers, ""She's on her way out."""
557;The acting in this movie is extremely well done, with one exception, and the action and suspense is non stop.
558;I wasn't blown away like I expected to be, but I really enjoyed it.
559;With all the great actors and so much action, I was not sure at times who was the bad guys and who were the good.
560;i love Martin Scorcese's work.
561;"Casino is one of my all time favorites, so I went into ""The Departed"" with very high expectations."
562;the second half of the movie was the part that won Scorcese the best picture Oscar.
563;It was brilliantly conceived, brilliantly acted and kept you glued to the screen.
564;The second hour of the movie is worth the wait.
565;The Departed is a great movie.
566;I bought my fiance the two disc series for Valentine's Day and he loved it.
567;A must see for any lover of crime dramas!
568;This is an excellent film that deserves to be in your library!
569;Clearly these lines have darkly humorous undertones that force giggles out of the audience.
570;But at its core, it's a thought provoking character study, one that purposely and effectively raises questions about identity, loyalty, and trust.
571;as a filmmaker, Scorsese clearly knows how he wants a story to be told.
572;This film makes use of some especially clever storytelling methods, made even better by subtle character development.
573;"And no wonder
574;In terms of the characters and their knowledge, this is true"
575;"Initially, things go well for the case
576;Sullivan, who has yet to be discovered, is rising to a position of power in the Special Investigation Unit.
577;She wants to know more about the man she thinks she loves, yet he continually evades her inquiries with his quick wit and devilish charm.
578;As carefully as he can, he gathers information about the organization he's become a part of, both the plans and the counter.
579;the most fascinating moments in the film occur within the final forty.
580;He's pure evil, right down to his graying goatee.
581;A star studded cast and director.
582;Was most impressed by mark wahlberg and jack.
583;I love Jack Nicholson's expressions, they go so well with the roles he plays.
584;He knows just how to get inside any character he portrays.
585;Many scenes are messy, but extremely well done as far as plot and suspense.
586;It wasn't the ending I'd hoped for, but I like the unexpected if it makes sense, and it did.
587;The Departed is a great film.
588;It has no less than 6 terrific performance, a gripping story, fantastic editing, and an engaging score.
589;For just pure entertainment value it never dissapoints.
590;raging Bull, Goodfellas, and Taxi Driver.
591;I got through all the special features in a very short time and nothing was very memorable.
592;Along the way, they both fall in love with the same woman.
593;I enjoyed it, but I never need to see it again.
594;I hear that """"The Age of Innocence"""" is considered his best, but I don't like movies with subtitles so I may just wait for the book for that one."""
595;anyhoo, this movie is very not entertaining mostly because it's about a group of friends, one of whom is the usually excellent Jack Nicholson, who go around trying to make more friends and then they shoot them in the face.
596;Now, anbody that knows me knows I am firmly against face.
597;"to sum up, here is what I didn't like about this movie: Jack Nicholson, Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio, Donnie Wahlberg's brother, Alec Baldwin, any of the ""dramatic"" scenes, the cinematography, the face."
598;It reminded me of Superman III (the one with Richard Pryor), and Richard Pryor makes me laugh.
599;Action packed drama, very well done.
600;every twist and turn of this film has you on the edge of your seat and every character is played perfectlyit's one of those films that keeps you locked in to the story
601;This film had the makings of a great flick: a fabulous cast, great acting, and a terrific initial setup: You have DiCaprio as a mole for the police infiltrating the Mafia, and Damon as a mole for the Mafia infiltrating the police.
602;crafted, interesting plot and conclusion.
603;Really well cast and tautly directed.
604;The Boston backgrounds are fascinating.
605;I first heard of this remake of Infernal Affairs a year after seeing the original film.
606;this is a very good crime drama despite what some might say.
607;Unlike the critics who gushed over it last year calling it the best film of the year, I think that was going a bit far but it is far better than even I expected it to.
608;Part of it is that unlike remakes which seem to aim to keep the spirit of the original Scorsese gives the film an air that is comparable to his own films.
609;Infernal Affairs had slick surface that made the whole film sleek and fast.
610;The Departed is more realistic down in the dirt and grit of the streets that its presenting.
611;I liked that it was a long film as well taking the time to tell its story and flesh out its characters nicely.
612;And except Nicholson who seemed to be reveling in going near the edge of being over the top without commiting so fully the cast was great with Damon again showing that he could be labeled the best actor of his generation with excellent support from Mark Whalberg, Alec Baldwin, and Vera Farmiga.
613;everything in the film is good, but one thing holds it from being great.
614;As good as everything is a lot of what made Infernal Affairs a great experience is the suprises it held in its plot.
615;For a film that is the forerunner for this years best picture oscar this is somewhat a let down in my opinion.
616;I'll be honest: I wasn't that big a fan of Gangs of New York.
617;The Departed, revisiting territory seen in Goodfellas, was immediately jumped on as one of Scorsese's best.
618;Is it, or is it just simply the best he's done in years, since possibly Casino but definately since Goodfellas?
619;It's an exciting movie filled with twists and turns but at the same time it seems like a movie where it feels like Scorsese's niche.
620;In other words, he knows how to make mob movies and is good at it.
621;However, the casting is great with the accompanying performances through the roof.
622;"Jack Nicholson, seen in such comedies as Something's Gotta Give and Anger Management, it's finally nice to see ""actor Jack"" back and not the superstar."
623;reviled Leonard DiCaprio proves there's more to him than just a handsome face.
624;of about the filming is kind of inexcusable.
625;goers, Martin Scorsese's The Aviator, about the rise and fall of Howard Hughes, was an exceptionally well.
626;crafted film, beautifully acted by Leonardo DiCaprio, depicting a dramatic and interesting time in American history.
627;"Martin does a wonderful job with the ""Historical Film""
628;In The Departed, he returns to what he does best, with a superb cast: Jack Nicholson, Matt Damon, Mark Walberg etc.
629;If you like gangster films, this story is a good one that rivets one's attention throughout its 150 minutes.
630;He is a character that knows what he wants and will go to any lengths to attain his desires.
631;He is an expert manipulator that thinks ahead, nurturing the young boys in his neighbourhood to work for him as they grow into men.
632;one of The Departure's major themes is a social paradox: the Matt Damon character is smart and ambitious, rising to the top of the Boston police force.
633;In fact, it is the """"loser"""" who has integrity while the winner is a two."""
634;similar to all Scorsese films, the soundtrack is cool and the editing is extremely tight, working in tandem towards a striking effect.
635;"the Departure's plot moves very fast and one needs to pay attention as to who is the ""rat"" and what will the Nicholson character do next."
636;clearly a four to five star film.
637;The Departed is, in short, a stunning achievement from director Martin Scorsese, who gleefully returns to the hard.
638;Joining him in his return is one of the better casts you'll likely find in one movie, and all of these elements combined make this one a must see.
639;the performances in this film make this film, period.
640;Jack Nicholson is spectacular as only Jack can be.
641;He's basically here to remind the audience what a commanding and terrific actor he is, especially as a villain.
642;He's equally terrifying and hilarious and, as always, it seems so effortless.
643;Matt Damon also continues to prove his chops in a tricky role of dual personalities and dual motives.
644;He brings across both his Good Will Hunting charm and his Jason Bourne brooding to great effect.
645;His role is complex, to say the least, and you don't really know his true nature until the climax.
646;His outstanding performance is a revelation of his true talent, and it's safe to say that I was absolutely blown away by it.
647;He perfectly blends a tough guy (and he is tough) with a regular guy that wants no part of all of that ugliness.
648;The Departed also benefits from an unusually stellar supporting cast.
649;Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin could easily headline their own film, but they all shine as role players in this one.
650;male cast she has to contend with.
651;It's violent, gritty, brutal, sexually charged, and almost every other word is four.
652;This is easily distinguishable as a Scorsese picture and is for mature adults that can enjoy this sort of thing and not take it too seriously.
653;That said, any takers will be pleasantly surprised and thoroughly entertained.
654;fashioned Hollywood in the best tradition.
655;Granted, but every once in a while a movie like this is made and reminds us that when the stars align in the right way, it is worth the price of admission and then some.
656;'The Departed' is a great movie.
657;'Infernal Affairs' is a masterpiece.
658;It is such a great story that it holds up in both films.
659;Great story, excellent acting, but.
660;If its Murder you want well this one has plenty of blood and guts to fill the bill.
661;I bought this as a valentines gift to surprise my boyfriend with hockey tickets in the movie.
662;"Martin Scorsese once again delivers an outstanding Oscar worthy effort in his interpretation of the Hong Kong produced thriller ""Infernal Affairs""."
663;costello played by the most talented actor gracing the silver screen today, Jack Nicholson, has groomed Colin Sullivan, a young fatherless Boston kid.
664;Sullivan played by Matt Damon evolves into an aspiring and rapidly rising officer with the Mass.
665;He provides Costello with essential inside info to run his criminal empire.
666;meanwhile young trooper Billy Costigan, played by the extemely accomplished Leonardo DiCaprio is recruited to worm into Costello's crime empire.
667;Coming from a well known, by both cops and hoods, Irish family he is disgraced and incarcerated to help build up a suitable criminal background.
668;In a thrilling cat and mouse game the players manuever like pieces on a chessboard to elude unearthing.
669;this violent passion play set against the backdrop of the streets of Boston, is just another demonstration of the stupendous skills of the masterful Scorsese, especially in this milieu.
670;The acting performances were terrific most notably by Nicholson and DiCaprio.
671;The underrated Alec Baldwin also proves his mettle as Damon's boss Capt. Ellerby.
672;On a technical level, the film does employ music well, and the film succeeds with its many quick cuts, even if more longer paced scenes should have been interspersed to let the actors truly act and cogitate on their lives, beyond the overacting DiCaprio does on Fermiga's couch.
673;Cinematographer Michael Ballhaus does his usual competent job, especially in the retro look of some scenes, which open and close with irises.
674;consider the 1997 crime masterpiece, L. a. Confidential.
675;If you watch the film, don't expect much of an aesthetic not intellectual rush, only some mildly entertaining moments, crafted really well.
676;If you want the former, go watch some earlier films from the Scorsese canon.
677;One of my favourite movies of all time.
678;Amazing cast, acting, story (for more fun, watch the original Hong Kong version called infernal affairs.
679;Also quite good, but I must say Scorsese and the cast do a better job with this one.
680;A big collection of well.
681;known male actors headed by veteran Jack Nicholson give standout performances.
682;Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon play guys who are both working both sides of the fence and the big suspense revolves around their characters and if they will be found out.
683;The acting is so good it keeps you riveted to the screen.
684;Nonethelss, to be fair, his movies .
685;If you can put up with the latter, you'll like this film a lot.
686;Every one of the main characters is dancing on a knife's edge wearing roller skates.
687;I suppose that it helps being given such well written characters.
688;Since the movie won Best Picture, Best Director, Best Editing, and Best Adapted Screenplay as well as nominated for Best Supporting Actor, well, it doesn't need my little bit of praise.
689;"if you liked ""Goodfellas"" and ""Casino"", you will know what to expect here."
690;still, being a Scorsese film, the dialogue is filled to about half full with F. words.
691;Still, Costello is a great monster.
692;so, if you like this sort of thing, this is a great work.
693;One of my favorite movies.
694;great plot twists!I order very few movies but this is a must have.
695;The Departed is definitely worth your time.
696;The acting is well done and the plot is interesting and suspenseful.
697;"The ending of this movie is shocking and and leaves the you with the same shocked feeling as movie endings such as ""The Sixth Sense"" or ""Mystic River""."
698;I watched it again this weekend, and this movie is fantastic.
699;i thought the acting was all in all pretty good, and the plot twists, were keep you on the edge of your seat type caliber.
700;The trilogy has become a quartet by default as the director tackles the Asian cult classic, Infernal Affairs, and has fashioned The Departed, a film so good up until its stunning conclusion, it almost can't possibly live up to its steadily built, character driven narrative.
701;A task force is formed to build a case against Costello.
702;here we have a dichotomy or duality of two men, Sullivan and Costigan, both intelligent, well read, and streetwise, who happen to be on opposing sides and for a majority of the story, unaware of each other's identity.
703;Costigan is the noble undercover cop whose life is in ever increasing peril and Sullivan is the hotshot policeman who will do anything to protect Costello.
704;It is amusing to see how Costello sort of adopts Costigan and Queenan is the elder to Sullivan at the police station.
705;Jack Nicholson convincingly portrays a powerful mob boss with utter arrogance and ruthlessness.
706;His dialogue is chilling and at times outrageously funny.
707;Damon, in his old stomping grounds, sports a New England accent and does a very credible job as the heavy.
708;"growing maturity in his roles
709;You have to hand it to Scorsese as one of the few directors who can attract the best actors who are dying to work with him.
710;The film is a little long but never uninteresting, and when it reaches its astonishing ending, it is sudden and jarring in unexpected ways that reach Shakespearean proportions.
711;scorsese is still very much in command of his medium, as he will throw in a cinematic device like an iris.
712;documentary approach that held a fascination of real life events amid a dramatic storyline.
713;In terms of structure, The Departed, while similar in spirit and energy to his previous crime dramas, shows Scorsese fabricating essentially a purely fictitious story, and as always, he has a knack for depicting the inner workings of organized crime with realistic bravado.
714;The profanity is excessive but realistic, and at times there are amusing cussing matches between the various factions.
715;great story and fantastic acting.
716;list your top five Best Mob Movies and most will contain Godfather 1 and 2, Goodfellas, Casino and Scarface.
717;But, where the heck is this Best Picture winner?
718;The Departed finally won Martin Scorsese his Best Director Oscar, despite the fact that he should have won for Goodfellas, Raging Bull and probably Taxi Driver.
719;Let's face it, the man is a genius .
720;the story is tight, the interaction between the cast is absolutely stellar: Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Vera Farmiga, Anthony Anderson and Alec Baldwin make this one of Scorsese's best.
721;the fact that this is a combo disk, is also brilliant.
722;This is probably one of the best movies I have ever seen.
723;If your looking for a great mob movie or any movie I highly recommend and the high definition is quite excellent.
724;Great cast, great script, and one of the greatest movies of all times!
725;I would highly recommend this movie!!
726;Leonardo DiCaprio, Jack Nicholson and Matt Damon really stand out in this smart, action packed suspenseful thriller.
727;I really loved this movie.
728;Man, it's good to finally see a really good Martin Scorsese movie again, seeing that his last really good one was probably """"Casino."""""""
729;The cinematography was sweet, the soundtrack was your usual old rock set, the story extremely well.
730;written and riveting, and every performance was perfect.
731;"This is officially one of the best movies he's made (the others being ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Goodfellas,"" all in my opinion of course)."
732;If you're a film buff who loves a good mob movie, then get this, because Scorsese has finally returned and done what he does best.
733;The Departed is a great gangster film, and a return to form for Scorsese.
734;Sit back and enjoy the the show.
735;unlike the Good Shepard, which was also a good movie but highly confusing at times).
736;Acting was outstanding all around (especially Wahlberg) and it was just an enjoyable, engrossing movie and deserving of Best Picture.
737;This movie was good till the very end.
738;some of the meanest, most detestable characters you'll ever encounter in a story.
739;It has twists and turns along with a healthy helping of action coupled and character development.
740;I loved this movie, so glad Amazon sells it.
741;Excellent Fast Paced deeply Engrossing Saga Of Infiltration of The Irish Mbb, and Its Hold On people In All walks Of Life.
742;"the Departed's cast is at least as strong as any film I have seen in recent years with all members taking their game to the next level and Jack not falling into too many ""Jack"" moments and remaining in character MOST of the time."
743;great use of music as usual in any Marty film.
744;best American film of '06??
745;"certainly better than any ""mainstream"" American film I have seen in the past year."
746;After leaving the theater, I saw those actors in a new light.
747;Great movie with an all star cast to back it up, plus a mind blowing ending you will not see comming.
748;that makes it deep and profound.
749;manly cast were, suddenly, to don black net hose and stilletoes, and sing the rest of their lines in Gilbert and Sullivan musical style.
750;"in ""The Third Man,"" Orson Welles delivers ""the cuckoo clock speech."""
751;now *that's* a classic film.
752;this was a great movie and I recommend it to any one who is a fan of Martin's.
753;In spite of that I did find that I enjoyed it and would recommend it.
754;Leonardo DiCaprio is the REAL star in this movie.
755;Matt Damon (snitch) was also good.
756;"The blurb for ""The Departed"" states that this is director Martin Scorsese's best effort since ""Goodfellas""."
757;"Since Goodfellas Scorsese's output includes ""Cape Fear"" (1991), ""The Age of Innocence"" (1993), ""Casino""(1995), ""Kundun"" (1997), ""Bringing Out the Dead"" (1999), ""Gangs of New York"" (2002), and ""The Aviator""(1994)."
758;"In my personal opinion Scorsese probably deserved the Best Picture Oscar on at least six occasions: ""Mean Streets"" (1973)
759;Put this in perspective, Steven Spielberg who some consider America's finest director never delivered an Oscar for any of his actors.
760;The highest compliment that can be paid to Scorsese is that Daniel Day.
761;So now Scorsese has joined the Avildsens and Costners with a best director Oscar.
762;When Marty won it was kind of a bittersweet moment.
763;The Departed was most certainly the best film of the nominated five, though I have a soft spot for """"Little Miss Sunshine""""."""
764;"In my mind, though, the best picture of 2006 was ""Pan's Labyrinth""."
765;One quibble I had was Scorsese's use of rock music that in previous films acted as a Greek Chorus to the action on screen.
766;"Those reservations aside the film's main strengths were William Monahan's adaptation of ""Infernal Affairs"" and the superb ensemble cast."
767;Monahan took the basic plot from the Hong Kong thriller and fleshed out the characters and added new and intriguing twists to the story.
768;The script is intelligent and twisty, and the Boston ambience (as far as this New Yorker is concerned) is an interesting change.
769;Damon and DiCaprio are terrific, as always, and there's good supporting work by Alec Baldwin and Martin Sheen.
770;"Vera Farmagi, as talented as she is, is miscast as the romantic interest
771;And in spite of the Oscar nomination, I think Wahlberg's way over the top (but not in a good way).
772;(Nicholson playing with a dismembered hand is just one example of the.
773;And the film's final shot is simply unworthy of a filmmaker of Scorses's caliber.
774;All star cast aside, this a well written movie.
775;i highly recommend this for anyone wanting a more cerebral action film.
776;I thought this was a great movie.
777;Lots of twists and turns.
778;It keeps you guessing through the whole movie.
779;this movie has more plot twists and turns than a country mountain road.
780;I will have to watch it again just to get the full story!
781;I like the parallel paths shown throughout the film and the work of the other actors is top.
782;The sound was great, gun shots sounded very real.
783;As for the movie, I thought it was very good, but not quiet in the class of Goodfellas.
784;This is the best mob movie.
785;Thanks for sending it to me so fast
786;All 3 headlining actors"
787;Very intense and lots of twists and turns along the way.
788;Definitely one of my favorite movies!!!
789;Received in a timely manner.
790;I have never really cared for Dicaprio's work but he made a believer of me with this film.
791;One of the best movies out there, love it from beginning to end, should have won more Oscars but they are predjudiced in Hollywood, very intense
792;The first half of the movie is great, mostly because you have no idea what is going on.
793;but then the second half hits, with a glorious jolt of humor, violence, and great acting.
794;So, in that respect, the movie is a relief.
795;It's far more enjoyable upon a second viewing when you know that things won't be ruined.
796;it's been done many times but the genre always entertains.
797;It took me there so I liked it.
798;leo (Leonardo DiCaprio) did a great job playing the under dog.
799;A good story, a stellar cast performing brilliantly, the director of one of the greatest films of all time (The Godfather). . . What could go wrong.
800;"If you love hearing the ""F"" word, this is your film."
801;(Scorcese created The Godfather without using it and became a directorial legend.)
802;If you love a film with fast, confusing cuts that bounce between time, then this is the one for you.
803;That was Coppola, and I knew that.
804;"I had already seen ""Infernal Affairs"" the picture on which this Oscar winner was based and I still liked the film despite Jack's over."
805;Transferring the Chinese triads to the Irish mob was clever on the part of the screenwriter, another Irishman and Scorsese has done a masterful job of combining his themes of loyalty and betrayal into this gangster film.
806;"I personally preferred ""The Aviator"" (also starring DeCaprio) but I'm so glad this film won Best Picture and Director."
807;If you're a Scorsese fan or love gangster films, do check this out!!
808;Easily the best movie I have seen in years and years.
809;Maybe the best movie made since Boogie Nights (1997).
810;"Another Scorsese masterpiece so far above regular film making that it reduces the standard Hollywood release to be equivalent with TV commercials
811;This is a movie you will want to re.
812;I could probably write 1500 words about this film but ultimately, it is a movie that creates a reality for the viewer and that is the goal of any film.
813;Believe me, I think it's hilarious that Marky Mark is up for an Oscar for best supporting, and I KNOW he will NOT win.
814;damon and DiCaprio were wonderful as the two cops who were good or bad, or both.
815;Nicholson is Nicholson, and he's always good, even when he's playing bad, which he does so good in this movie.
816;Can he pair his best director with a best picture?
817;It's a front runner, that's for sure.
818;Like many of us, I'm in awe of Martin Scorsese's talent.
819;There is no doubt that he is one of the world's premier story tellers and I'm a huge fan.
820;He'd already won the Academy award for Best Director before I saw the film and even though I hadn't seen it, I thought it was well.
821;deserved and long overdue praise.
822;studded film was not one of Scorsese's best efforts, which is odd because the performances seemed on target, especially the Mark Walhberg character.
823;this is a gangster movie with an amazing plot twist.
824;the basic story of the two sworn enemies infiltrating each other's ranks is interesting enough, but the role of DiCaprio's character really strikes the watcher.
825;the ensemble cast makes the characters and the presentation of the story in this movie that much more attractive.
826;without going into any detail about the actual story, this movie's story will keep you in your seat for the duration of the film.
827;i am not a big fan of awards shows and the entertainment industry, but every once in a while, the powers that be actually honor an artist that deserves to be honored.
828;Scorsese gets it done and finally got recognized.
829;This is one of the best mobster films of all time on par with On the Waterfront, Goodfellas and the Godfather.
830;I also dislike the fact that these Irish mafia guys are never really established as mafia guys.
831;face it you just gotta love Nicholson as an Irish mobster.
832;Add Scorcese, Wahlberg, DiCaprio and Matt Damon and you're in for one great ride!
833;play between Nicholson, DiCaprio and Damon is some of the best I've seen in years with a plot as twisted as Miller's crossing.
834;It's mean and gritty New York done Scorcese style.You're going to read other reviews about the plot so I want to talk about the best bits between the characters.
835;If you're a fan of counter espionage plots you will enjoy the dance between DiCaprio and Damon as well as Sheen and Nicholson.
836;The drama is riveting and suspenseful.
837;Wahlberg does an admirable job adding that essential spice to the recipe of intensity and pressure upon the characters.
838;All in all this is a great film.
839;I have the greatest respect for Martin Scorsese's films.
840;Well, he's back recreating the same, riveting, closeups which had us believing pure evil does exist.
841;hours so lets end it, NOW."""""""
842;not a great movie for me, but a good movie.
843;This film has intelligence, good acting, a more than competent director (legendary, in fact).
844;I remember leaving the theater thinking that it was all pulled together nicely but it was also nothing remarkable.
845;"Martin Scorsese's best films remain ""Raging Bull"", ""Taxi Driver"", and ""Goodfellas""."
846;An excellent film, very well acted and directed and well worth watching more than once.
847;And now I've got Scorsese.
848;"The result: A gritty, good cop/bad cop thriller that had me at the edge of my coveralls
849;one corrupt, the other bipolar but honest.
850;creepily steals the show, playing an underworld kingpin.
851;the target of an intense police investigation.
852;aided and abetted by a very capable, and nasty, lieutenant (Ray Winstone).
853;These guys drop their F. bombs and answer their cell phones and contribute to the story in grand fashion.
854;With his stellar cast Scorsese takes you through a breathtaking, incredibly violent ride, culminating in an ending that took me completely by surprise.
855;and absolutely made me go, """"Wow."""
856;disc special edition you'll also enjoy (or maybe not) several deleted scenes, some of the cast talking about gangster movies, and Martin Scorsese talking about. . . martin Scorsese.
857;"This director can talk it up all he wants
858;Has a nice selection of extras, too.
859;So it is with director Martin Scorsese.
860;His early work had the purity and tightness of art.
861;This was produced as a Hollywood insider tribute set up to honor Scorsese"
862;An appropriate part for ex.
863;The plot is excellent and we got top of the line performances by all actors in major roles.
864;I would call it a good.
865;This iss the most spellbinding film I have ever seen.
866;Well written and outstanding acting by DeCaprio and Wahberg.
867;i bought this movie from Wal.
868;ray disc I bought, so which means I actually be getting new blu.
869;Hey, I want to say this movie, The Departed is very entertaining and fun to watch.
870;Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon keep me guessing a lot.
871;I'm pretty glad that Alec Baldwin is in this movie, and he is doing his best and I remembered him from Beetlejuice when he was skinny and look younger.
872;It's time to recognize DiCaprio as one of our most solid actors.
873;With a cast like this, you *ought* to be able to come up with a good film.
874;All great actors, all great performances.
875;"The premise is solid
876;The action really picks up when they each catch a whiff of the other's existence, and it becomes a game of who will smoke out the other first.
877;The plot is intricate and complicated, but in a good way, as the characters strive to one.
878;up each other, and we're always left guessing as to who's playing whom.
879;This is a wonderful plot and idea.
880;I was hopeful at one point, because there was an earlier mention of impotence on Damon's part.
881;She's simply another chessboard upon which DiCaprio and Damon play out their little match, and she, herself, adds next.
882;As mentioned above, the plot of the Departed is incredibly complicated.
883;How can a person possibly unravel such a Gordian Knot of intrigue and interesting characterization?
884;Gripping story line and good acting make this an enjoyable movie.
885;I can, without reservation, recommend this film to anyone.
886;Well I've never been a huge fan of Martin Scorcese's films but this one redeemed him in my eyes.
887;I thought the film was terrific and the acting fantastic.
888;I couldn't believe the wonderful casting and how each actor was so well suited and superb in their roles.
889;Scorcese should win this one easily but what blows me over is that Leonardo DiCaprio did the best acting performance of his career and he wasn't even nominated for an Oscar.
890;I gave it two stars for superb acting.
891;This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.
892;This movie deserved all the awards it received.
893;Watched it for the second time and it was even better than the first.
894;nicholson is garnering a lot of attention for this role.
895;And it is an exciting thing to see.
896;With a film like this you need a strong charismatic center and there's no one on the planet with more charisma than Jack.
897;familiar goodfella look new and interesting again.
898;assess why the mobster is such a fascinating film type.
899;This new take on a familiar character challenges the stereotype of what a mob guy can be.
900;[Exactly who deserves credit for the original elements of this film is a matter generating some debate.
901;It should be noted that many Asian film makers see Scorcese as a huge influence.
902;This kind of comparitive viewing can actually be very interesting, not to mention commensurate to a greater understanding of our own culture as well as a greater understanding of other cultures, including non.
903;DiCaprio's moments with Nicholson are the stuff of movie legend"
904;A good number of Stones songs on the soundtrack seem to hint toward a correlation between Jack Nicholson and Jumpin'Jack Flash himself.
905;So while DiCaprio is set on catching Nicholson, Damon is set on protecting him.
906;And though these two interact mainly via cellphone as they hunt the true identity of the man that is hunting them their personal motives for doing what they do does provide audience members with an interesting compare and contrast scenario.
907;But then we realize that she is actually there to allow us a glimpse of the vulnerable side of these two moles.
908;In other words she's there to give us a glimpse of these two guys with their gaurds down.
909;And its in her presence that we learn what each guy is really made of.
910;But she does a solid job with the role and gives her character a credibility and complexity that is as unusual as it is unexpected.
911;this is a great cast no doubt and Scorcese succeeds in getting inventive and entertaining performances from his actors.
912;Its obvious that Scorcese is encouraging his actors to do something original with their parts so that this mob movie will be distinct from others (and Scorcese has plenty of imitators so it is paramount that he do something original with the genre).
913;Though its chock full of stars and performances (any one of which would have stolen the show in any other film) this still feels like a piece of collaborative team acting.
914;And that is yet another of this films great achievements.
915;this is a surefire hit.
916;The movie has everything you can ask for.
917;The action was great, fantastic acting, and a story that is unparalled to anything recent.
918;{4.25 stars},THE DEPARTED makes fine use of its high.
919;Jack Nicholson also gives a commendable performance as aging Boston Irish Mafia boss Costello, as does Martin Sheen as SIU Chief Detective Queenan.
920;One of the most memorable characters of all is Mark Wahlberg as abrasive meanie SIU detective Dignam.
921;Everything develops at a natural but very compelling pace.
922;This film tackles some big themes and is very revealing of what a maddening head.
923;I loved this movie, but I felt that Infernal Affairs was a much better film.
924;This is an intriguing and sophisticated look at the war between the South Boston Police force and its most dangerous crime ring.
925;But for a grownup, it is a scary look at a world that we don't always get to see in our neck of the woods, as it were.
926;This film represents a best of genre film.
927;Outstanding performances from DiCaprio, Damon, Wahlbberg and Jack Nicholson are matched by the gripping story line and great climax.
928;If you appreciated Casino, Heat, Goodfellas, Donny Brasco, etc., you will really enjoy this film.
929;Best of all, it is a film that you will want to watch again and again, and what better format to watch it in than high definition?
930;While these expectations are high and maybe unfair, they are fairly earned as Scorsese has provided great movie after great movie.
931;This is a remarkably good film.
932;First, it keeps your interest from start to finish.
933;The characters are quite good and the pace is consistent.
934;I saw The Gangs of New York but The Departed is so much better.
935;Undoubtedly the former cop received a copy of the tape between the crime boss and his rat and took justice into his own hands.
936;This 2 disc collectors edition is filled with extra features and insider information about the movie.
937;"Martin Scorsese's ""The Departed,"" a remake of a 2002 Hong Kong film, ""Infernal Affairs,"" is profane, violent, darkly humorous, sexy, and incredibly entertaining."
938;The theme is an intriguing one.
939;Costello, who has never had a child, is, in a sense, Sullivan's and Costigan's twisted father figure.
940;Complicating matters further, they both fall in love with the same woman, a beautiful police psychiatrist named Madolyn (Vera Farmiga).
941;Seeing Nicholson's superlative performance is alone worth the price of admission.
942;DiCaprio shines as Costigan, an edgy young man whose desperation to escape his past leads him to explore dark corners of his personality that he would prefer not to acknowledge.
943;Scorsese does a wonderful job of integrating his large cast seamlessly.
944;The lively screenplay is peppered with hilarious lines that provide needed comic relief and the film's editor, Thelma Schoonmaker, helps maintain the film's rapid and exciting pace.
945;I don't know why I never saw this in the theatre but when I finally saw it, I loved it.
946;There are plenty of twists and turns and I thougt all of the big named actors fit their roles really well.
947;I was able to get immersed in the movie while watching it on an airplane.
948;I would recommend it as one of my favorites.
949;This was definitely one of the most gripping and well.
950;crafted cop/crime thrillers I've seen in years.
951;"classic ""The Usual Suspects"" though quite a bit darker in tone."
952;"Certainly one of Scorsese's best films in a long time, though a lot of the soundtrack seems very, very familiar if you've ever watched ""Goodfellas."
953;out perfect, as are all of the ensemble cast's performances, and when combined with Scorsese's trademark brisk pacing and snappy transitions, makes for a film which had me totally absorbed from the opening credits.
954;a big part of its genius, and the reason it's a movie that you can watch over and over again, is that the characters are quite rich and mostly opaque, rather than being easily identifiable, focus.
955;The plot is quite intricate and best of all, totally unpredictable.
956;refreshingly, I had no idea what was going to happen down to the very last frame.
957;another brilliant feature of this movie is that it has a very morally ambiguous subtext or perspective: there really are no clear good or bad guys, no knights in shining armor or innocent angels.
958;Every major character retains an extremely engaging element of darkness, shadow, and surprise and unknowability.
959;Even the Vera Farmiga character (this actress is a strangely dazzling and exquisite woman as well as a top.
960;notch actress), has her own darkness.
961;What a delight, to enter a world of deeply imperfect and more or less impenetrable human beings, rather than good guys on white horses and bad guys in black hats.
962;In short, this film is definitely a keeper, most definitely worth owning.
963;"Filmmaker extraordinaire Martin Scorsese finally brings back the dazzling intensity of his earlier films such as ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Goodfellas"" with his latest offering, a driving Americanized update of the 2002 Hong Kong thriller, ""Infernal Affairs""."
964;Adapted with intelligence by screenwriter William Monahan, the now Boston.
965;on with local mob boss Frank Costello, while the other is undercover inside Costello's organization and secretly informing the police of their plans.
966;The informant is Colin Sullivan, who impresses his supervisors with his savvy and unfettered ambition.
967;She becomes Sullivan's girlfriend and also Costigan's doctor.
968;One of the key reasons that this approach works so effectively is the kinetic, time.
969;jumping editing by longtime Scorsese collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker, infusing Scorsese's masterful direction and the adept unraveling.
970;a stellar cast is in peak form here starting with Leonardo DiCaprio's riveting turn as Costigan.
971;Under Scorsese's tutelage for the third time, he has finally matured into a role that capitalizes on his visceral intensity and delivers easily the best work I have seen him do.
972;In supporting roles, Martin Sheen is solid as Queenan, but it's the rapid.
973;Ray Winstone brings his trademark menace to Costello's amusingly named henchman, Mr. French, and Alec Baldwin shines in the smallish role of department head Ellerby.
974;"Scorsese has thankfully let go of the wearying pretensions of his last two movies, ""The Aviator"" and ""Gangs of New York"", to produce an incredibly taut, character."
975;It's aces for this kind of work.
976;DiCapro, Walhberg, and Damon are some of the finest actors of this gen and they prove it in this film.
977;It should win best picture this year.
978;The Departed is a must see film.
979;It will keep you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end.
980;Keep in mind it IS a Scorsese film, but in my opinion one of his all time best.
981;This is not a family friendly movie, but it IS a phenomenal film.
982;disc set are nice, but more targeted at Scorsese fans, than general fans of the movie.
983;There are some deleted scenes which are interesting, and a documentary length item on Scorsese as a filmmaker, among other things.
984;In general it is worth the extra money, and especially so if you are into films seriously.
985;An excellent movie, I am glad that Martin Scorsese finally got a well.
986;This was a great movie with lots of twists and turns.
987;The forces of good and evil are at again.
988;great product as described, even though a knock off of kreepy crawly it worked as it should!
989;This film has more twists and turns and revelations in it than you can imagine.
990;Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon were excellent.
991;Oh and Mark Wahlberg really surprised me in his role too, I was very impressed.
992;Being a massive fan of Martin Scorsese I was hooked.
993;"The names Scorsese/Nicholson meant ""Great Movie"" to me."
994;the movie further cemented itself in greatness with the amazing supporting cast.
995;Excitement and laughter came across me when I saw one of my favorites Alec Baldwin take the screen in a perfect role for him.
996;Matt Damon played the bit of hidden scumbag quite well.
997;Then the biggest magic of all to me was that Scorsese was finally able to make a DiCaprio fan out of me with a very powerful performance.
998;the story was so intense and alive you are along for the journey the entire time.
999;disc special edition is the ultimate.
1000;It's not cluttered yet they give you a deeper appreciation of the film.
1001;*an incredible documentary about Whitey Bulger and the Irish mob of South Boston who the writer based the persona of Jack Nicholson's character on.
1002;Great movie besides the constant filling up of my email by the seller.
1003;Has an all star cast and keeps you on the edge of your seat.
1004;The ending is a real mind blow as well.
1005;Great story and well done movie.
1006;Half the fun of this movie is watching what Jack Nicholson's character will say and/or do next.
1007;You can easily believe what you're watching is how this group of people talk to each other every day.
1008;A relative with an interest in organized crime wanted me to watch this.1).
1009;For example, they are able to put together three words without one of them being an obscenity.2).
1010;this movie gives you drama, suspense, horror and comedy all at the same time due to the amazing film director Martin Scorsese.
1011;I am on a Mark Walberg kick at the moment, and his role in this movie although is small, the other actors easily make up for the rest.
1012;it's perfect, just what I wanted.
1013;presentation is great and even better than expected.
1014;Amazing price for a Steelbook edition of a classic.
1015;A great movie with a fabulous cast, director and script.
1016;this film has a very good plot very good acting and a hella good ending.
1017;but besides the point its a must see thrill ride full of twists and turns and an all star cast.
1018;a must see for scorsese fans!
1019;This movie made it to me in good time and it was in very good shape so i was a happy camper.
1020;I would recommend the movie and the merchant to friends and family.
1021;I watch a lot of movies.
1022;With this one I saw in the trailer before it came out that this was going to be good.
1023;I love detective action movies.
1024;16 blocks, Training Day, both good movies.
1025;But I've got to say that The Departed was the best movie I saw in the theater in the year 2006.
1026;I find this find surprisingly funny.
1027;There is a lot going on and each time I watch it I pick up something new.
1028;I have seen this movie numerous times and every time it is just as suspensful as the first.
1029;Family and friends all agree that Leonardo deserved an award for his performance which was outstanding!
1030;Put this many award winning actors together in a police get the bad guys movie, drama is guaranteed to be nonstop.
1031;This is a good Cop movie and based in Boston, not an everyday police movie it digs deep into the police dept. that some are corrupt .
1032;Leonardo DiCaprio gives another amazing performance in this complex thriller with Jack Nicholson, Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg.
1033;"I highly recommend this movie
1034;leo is destined for greatness, no doubt.
1035;An outstanding cast of actors .
1036;brings this thriller to life.
1037;still it is worth seeing.
1038;there are many layers to the story and its definitely something that'll keep you guessing.
1039;This is a great movie and looked good on the Blu.
1040;Dicaprio is stellar, as is Nicholson.
1041;Go out of your way to see it!
1042;Good luck finding a hero .
1043;Better acting nods go to matt and leo with matt getting an a + in mastering the bostonian accent.
1044;This is a great movie.
1045;One of the best mob movies I've seen.
1046;Has great cast of actors, that play their parts very well!
1047;I've seen this before and now it's nice to own my own copy.
1048;would highly recommend it to all who appreciate good cinema.
1049;It's one of those that will have you jumping form your seat at the end asking what just happened?!
1050;I absolutely loved this movie.
1051;All of the stars shined equally bright.
1052;Damon and Dicaprio played each of their respective characters great.
1053;(I felt they could have done a role reversal, and still nail the characters).
1054;Wahlberg also played his character to perfection.
1055;But good old Jack stole the show.
1056;Nicholson was amazing as Frank Costello.
1057;Other than that this is one of my favorite movies ever.
1058;Jack delivers an amazing performance, as does Leo Dicaprio.
1059;The quips that Mark Wahlberg let out are priceless!
1060;This is one of the few times that an all star cast actually delivers on its promise.
1061;Things that are happening today close up.
1062;I love this movie and tell everyone I know and don't know to watch it.
1063;The ending has you on edge too.
1064;Everything about it is great, cast, story line, just a phenomenal movie.
1065;Definitely one in my """"favorite all time"""" list."""
1066;I would highly recommend this movie.
1067;this movie kept you on the edge of your seat Wait until you see the punch line!
1068;As for directing, Martin Scorsese is in the top his form .
1069;the movie is well paced, suspenseful, and has a great soundtrack (as usual in Scorsese movies).
1070;The cast is the closest to perfect it could be.
1071;As much as I like Jack Nicholson, it was nothing he has not done before (his Frank Costello is a combination of Daryl Van Horne and Col. Nathan R. Jessep) but Leonardo DiCaprio as Billy Costigan played the best role of his career.
1072;"About a year ago, I wrote about his acting in Scorcese's previous movie, ""The Aviator"", ""Leonardo DiCaprio earns my respect and admiration for his acting ."
1073;he is one of the most talented young actors now and I will be waiting for his following films impatiently.
1074;"I trusted him in every scene and he made me feel strongly for and sympathize with Howard Hughes's affliction."""
1075;"not as perfect as ""Goodfellas"" which comes to mind while watching ""The Departed"", the newest Scorcese's work is a lot of fun to watch ."
1076;it is an inspiring film.
1077;He is one of the best actors.
1078;That is one reason I wanted to see this movie.
1079;There was a lot of action here and there but in between I felt like pressing forward.
1080;This is one of the most overrated movies I have ever seen.
1081;"drama genre that he helped to make famous with ""Mean Streets"" (1973) and ""Goodfellas"" (1990)."
1082;scorsese, a consummate auteur, shares many thematic interests with his screenwriter, William Monahan.
1083;"A Boston police officer, William Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), goes undercover in the local mob with the hope that he may purge himself of his family's criminal history (redemption and honor being major themes in Scorsese's films, such as ""Gangs of New York"")."
1084;Matt Damon infuses the antagonistic Sullivan with poise, sophistication, and charisma.
1085;He uses his trademark mixture of charisma and menace in a familiar and admittedly somewhat goofy portrayal of villainy.
1086;the real star of the film is Scorsese.
1087;Taking a cue from an early exchange between Wahlberg's character and Costigan .
1088;Tragic and comedic tones are expertly juxtaposed.
1089;Violence is explosive and brutal.
1090;Relentless camera movement and Thelma Schoonmaker's jump cuts further give rise to a sense of nerve.
1091;He is working with a very bankable cast and a three.
1092;Despite the creative limitations that may be associated with a more commercial project, Scorsese is more than able to elicit his own passions.
1093;LeonardoTis was and will be one of the best movies around for years if he keeps it up.
1094;the man is a a classic performer and I truly enjoyed the entire series.
1095;what a weird storythe Zodiac is by far the best movie I think of the year!
1096;A number of people have told me I look like Jack Nicholson so that made it a bit more interesting.
1097;realistic movies where you can see the puff.
1098;The acting and directing was quite good and the story moved along at a comfortable speed.
1099;I'd judge it as an excellent film from a director well known for excellent films, but I don't think this is his best.
1100;This movie was great, and it got to me in only 3 days.
1101;It is tense and gritty but looks real good on the screen (heads up, ladies).
1102;What a powerhouse of young talented actors with Nicholson and Sheen adding color, skill and texure.
1103;I'm gonna see it again!
1104;One of Scorcesee's best and one of the best in it's genre.
1105;Ranks up there with Michael Mann's Heat as one of the best crime dramas of all time.
1106;The storyline, acting, suspense, direction, writing, and plot are all superb.
1107;There is lots of talk saying that though Scorsese won his first Oscar for this film, it is the wrong film to be rewarded for.
1108;haven't seen it and nor do I care to)Still, this is a thriller that is expertly crafted and intricately unraveled.
1109;He ultimately gets tagged with the job of bringing the mob boss down.
1110;Ironically, both men share a love interest (the stunning Vera Farmiga) yet they never find out about each other although it is alluded to near films end.
1111;but it all adds up to more meaningful story and fateful climax.
1112;Yet, the intensity of the plot and the unpredictability of the mortality of certain characters kept my attention glued to the screen.
1113;When this film needed to, it upped the ante and delivered on the thrills.
1114;All the actors did wonderful jobs and any of them could have been nominated for the supporting actor role.
1115;Whaldberg was quite good so it was nice that he got the nod.
1116;so, it may not be a masterpiece but it certainly delivered.
1117;Very good story but they their gun fight was childish and improbable.
1118;And does a pretty good job of it too.
1119;Equal parts bravado and sniveling.
1120;solid performances by Alec Baldwin, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, others.
1121;the bonus disc on this edition, Scorsese on Scorsese is interesting and the rare kind of bonus material you can actually enjoy.
1122;It basically takes the original's novel plot and puts an American spin on it.
1123;i found it more enjoyable than the original.
1124;The original is fine, but this one doesn't take itself too seriously and is more fun as a result.
1125;Jack Nicholson is delightfully devilish, while Alec Baldwin brings in some 30 Rock to the show.
1126;"It actually takes some inspiration from the real life Whitey Bulger as well as the FBI agent who was his ""man on the inside."

1130;The best movie of 2006.
1131;If you are not offended by this, it will keep you on the edge of your seat until the last scene.
1132;My girlfriend and I both enjoyed the movie, both the characters and the plot were well presented.
1133;For anybody that didn't know, The Departed is an adaptation of a 2004 Asian movie.
1134;Other than that, an excellent movie.

1136;Then addtwo of Boston's favorite sons,Damon, and Wahlberg, add a Jack Nicholson.
1137;Even before Scorsese finally received his first Best Director Oscar for The Departed on 25 February 2007, this two.
1138;It includes a """"Scorsese on Scorsese"""" doc (compiled in 2005 by Time critic and Scorsese friend Richard Schickel) in which Scorsese comments on his major films since Who's That Knocking On My Door (1967) up to The Aviator (2004)."""
1139;another doc provides a good cultural.
1140;thirty years ago, Scorsese received the Cannes Film Festival Palm d'Or and his first Best Picture Oscar nomination for Taxi Driver (1976).
1141;At the March 1977 Academy Awards, Taxi Driver received four nominations, including Best Picture.
1142;But Scorsese's film did not receive a single Oscar award and the Best Picture, Best Director and Best Film Editing awards were all rewarded to Rocky (1976), with Sylvester Stallone also receiving Oscar nominations for both Best Actor (along with Taxi Driver star Robert De Niro) and Best Original Screenplay (no nomination in this category for film critic and Taxi Driver writer Paul Schrader).
1143;thirty years later, Stallone received generally positive critical comment and decent commercial returns for the sixth instalment of his Rocky franchise, Rocky Balboa (2006), a tribute to the original Oscar.
1144;film veteran Clint Eastwood, another friend of Richard Schickel, was nominated for the third time in his career for both Best Picture and Best Director for Letters from Iwo Jima (2007).
1145;Two years ago, Eastwood won Best Picture and Best Director Oscars for Million Dollar Baby (2004, Eastwood's second win of these two Oscars, following his final Western Unforgiven (1992)), when Scorsese had his fifth unsuccessful nomination for The Aviator.

1155;The acting was spectacular and the story was very well done.
1156;Kept me on the edge of my seat.
1157;A great movie if you like justice movies
1158;But this film beats the Bard on both counts.

1160;THis man makes great films!
1161;The Award for best movie 2007 went to Scorsese for The Departed .
1162;Although I enjoyed some of the performances, lead by Leo.
1163;This time instead of Italian 'wise guys' it's the Irish.
1164;Yeh so what you come from Boston so your great great grandfathers sisters aunties best friends cat once had some connection with Ireland so what?
1165;give it up Scorsese, Goodfellas was a great film but thats about it.
1166;The cast here is fantastic, and Leo DiCaprio has got to be one of the most interesting actors of his generation.
1167;He is versatile and fearless in a way that I have not seen in a long time.
1168;The fact that Martin Scorsese and other A. list directors continue to seek him out for their films is a testimony to his talent.
1169;He is supported by some heavy hitters in this film, but he really carries this movie.
1170;this was also a plum role for Jack Nicholson, who is a lot of fun to watch here.
1171;i really enjoyed this movie, but I have to say that it is not Martin Scorsese's BEST work.
1172;Sean Penn is much better at being a back.
1173;"water irish (take it from someone who is one) and both ""Mystic River"" and ""State of Grace"" are a better portrayal of the contradictions that are Irish Catholic Americans."
1174;There is much young talent in Hollywood in screen writing, production design, cinematography and all the other skills and talents that make a movie worth watching.
1175;I apologize to Martin Sheen, who was the one shining star.
1176;The movie is great though.
1177;Before everybody around here condems this review, please note that I consider Martin Scorsese to be high up in the pantheon of great filmmakers.
1178;At least under three instances do I believe that he deserved to win not just for Best Picture and Director, but win big all around: Goodfellas, Raging Bull, and Hugo.
1179;i do believe one may need to cover the acting first and foremost here because everybody does a wonderful job with the roles they were given.
1180;which is surprising given that Anthony Anderson (the guy from Kangaroo Jack) is in this film as well.
1181;With a film directed by the great Martin Scorsese and starring such a powerhouse cast across the board, it pretty much goes without saying that the acting would be first rate.
1182;Infernal Affairs is a surprisingly effective and believable crime thriller (I can definitely see their police force going to such great lengths in inserting a mole in a crime boss's organization just to bring them down).
1183;The Departed was so great and exciting.
1184;All the actors were great and the story was perfect.
1185;This is Leonardo de Caprio's best film to date.
1186;There are so many twists and turns in this film and the ending is very suprising.
1187;If you haven't seen this movie already I suggest you get it as soon as possible because it's great and enjoyable.
1188;Martin Scorsese has another major hit on his hands with the release of the intelligent, chilling, violent, puzzling, and completely fascinating THE DEPARTED.
1189;But taking this film solely on its own merits this is one gripping piece of cinematic art.
1190;the story involves two young recently graduated from police academy, men from opposite sides of the law and backgrounds, who are made moles within the Boston State Police department and the Irish mafia: Leonardo DiCaprio is one and Matt Damon is the other and both young actors turn in committed and convincing performances.
1191;On the polar aspects of the battleground are Jack Nicholson as the crime king Costello (his finest work since 'A Few Good Men') together with Ray Winstone as Mr French and on the other end are DiCaprio's mentors Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg and Damon's mentors Alec Baldwin et al.
1192;The very beautifully written female lead is played to perfection by Vera Farmiga who finally has a role (a conflicted psychiatrist for the moles) hat takes full advantage of her prodigious gifts as an actress.
1193;This is one of Scorsese's best films and one that begs to be seen again.
1194;ish nephew loves gangster movies.
1195;"This is a favorite and the ""Widescreen Edition"" made it even more appreciated."
1196;All right, first things first.
1197;why 5 stars as opposed to the rest of the reviewers who've got it pegged as a 4.
1198;if there's any justice in this world, Scorcese will win best picture at the Oscars.
1199;Over the past few years, the boyish good.
1200;kudos to the casting director.
1201;"create ""Infernal Affairs"", it actually improves on the source material."
1202;"when Roy Buchanan's ""Sweet Dreams"" fades you out to the credits, you'll feel a sense of euphoria, that you haven't felt in a long time."
1203;the Best film of 2006, hands down.
1204;and bring a breath of fresh air and credibility to his next picture.
1205;It's really just a matter of seeing it yourself.
1206;It's so rare to see a movie this well.
1207;made, that you really owe it to yourself to see it.
1208;truly a masterpiece from every angle .
1209;make sure you give it a look before someone slips and lets out the ending at oscar time.
1210;Wow, what a movie, what a cast.
1211;Should win a lot of Oscars.
1212;Best movie I've seen in years.
1213;A bit overplayed by jack Nicholson and his really poor opinion of women, but if you can get past the language, great movie.
1214;so is jack nicholson's performance.
1215;leo has developed into a very good actor and damon ain't bad either.
1216;so, if you can put up with jack and the ending it's worth the 15 bucks.
1217;the story is enjoyably unpredictable, so I won`t spoil it by telling too much.
1218;just get this movie, you will love it!
1219;Good movie making, but you better have a strong stomach!
1220;Crazy plot along with very scandalous characters everyone played their roles accordingly.
1221;Worthy of the recent Best Picture Academy Award and a wonderful return to form for Martin Scorcese.
1222;Well written, rich characters and a strong, interesting plot all supported by terrific performances, particularly from Jack Nicholson, Leo DiCaprio and Vera Farminga (proving herself to be an up and coming actress to watch).
1223;Great night in for fans of classy yet gritty cinema.
1224;"It's hard to believe, but then then look to see the other best picture nominees the year ""Chariots of Fire"" won the Oscar."
1225;"The starting point that I am trying to make is that good/amazing work is sometimes not awarded the acclaim that it should, but whether the Academy gets it right or not, we the public know is ""best"" as per our own appreciaton."
1226;I've learned to appreciate the work and put aside the awards hoopla that only serves as a point of departure for conversation about great movies.
1227;"is ""The Departed"" a great movie?"
1228;The story is engrossing, the performances are captivating, and the execution is that of a director at the peak of his capabilities.
1229;It is worth noting that, like many Scorsese films, this one has graphic violence to boot and I would caution anyone to take kids to see this film, as some scenes are among his most shocking.
1230;I can tell you that both Matt Damon and Leonard DiCaprio give the best performances of their careers.
1231;I've never been a huge fan of DiCaprio, but they both surprised me and both are Oscar.
1232;Damon is growing into one of this generation's best.
1233;"For some, Jack Nicholson can sometimes be too ""Jack,"" but with the exception of a couple of scenes (one of which is hilarious) he stays within his character."
1234;The supporting cast is flawless.
1235;the story itself challenges you to concentrate and keeps your adrenalin flowing PAST the last frame.
1236;Unlike some past Scorsese movies, this one injects a strong dose of humor between all the deception, double.
1237;I give this movie an unqualified 5.
1238;I like this movie so much I bought it, and I am cheap.
1239;Jack Nicholson is one bad mfer, and Marky Mark is the best actor in the movie.
1240;", satisfies all suspicion in Martin Scorsese's 2006 Oscar winning Best Picture, ""The Departed""."
1241;Good storytelling and intense suspense, and finally, a rather supreme film, are just slightly riddled by bullet holes of nagging doubt, like the FBI informant spending nearly the entirety of the film comfortably in the trust of street level Mafia type, while accomplishing nothing, an informant who never informs, or double.
1242;"crosses
1243;It seems that if we have famous actors that political correctness requires us to rate the movie high.
1244;It is a solid 2 star.
1245;entertaining, gripping, heart pounding, well directed movie.
1246;There are some very thoughtful and well.
1247;I believe I will go for a quick hit here and just express what a joy it was to watch such a well.
1248;directed movie filled with some of the best actors working today.
1249;By no way shape or form is this a happy film, it is"
1250;5 stars and highly recommended!
1251;there's better action movies with great stories like TAKEN or LEON THE PROFESSIONAL or DJANGO UNCHAINED.
1252;Everyone was great and the story moves, moves, moves.
1253;I know this film is 2hours 20minutes long but it is also very fast, fast enough to keep you interested.
1254;The Departed,somehow, recreates that delightfully fast feel and in ways undefined surpasses all expectations that a fan could possibly have from this film.
1255;This is a very intelligent film and resets standards for film making.
1256;leonardo DiCaprio , quite effortlessly, owns the show.
1257;you will love the climax.
1258;Jack Nicholson makes a great Whitey.
1259;Anyone who has read my movie reviews, knows my passion for GREAT mob/gangster theme offerings.
1260;Martin Scorsese is the most prolific genius director of these type movies.
1261;One reason that there are so many great actors involved with him is simple.
1262;He will always be regarded as the best director of gangster movies of all time.
1263;It was an amazing movie.
1264;My younger brother, age 13, loved the movie and we had re.
1265;the producer did a great job of connecting the characters to the theories of Freud.
1266;My brother and I very much so recommend watching this movie.
1267;You will love this movie for it's amazing story, cast, and acting.
1268;Highly recommended movie that never got the run time that it deserved.
1269;Scorsese weaves an intricate tapestry of double.
1270;Cat and mouse action, generous helpings of violence, a semi.
1271;Great action and performances abound with the all.
1272;absorbing drama with profound psychological inflections, spiced with black humor, a formidable cast, a sleepless camera that simply does not blink for a second, with admirable mobility and mesmerizing angle shots, and a very clever script make of that movie not only the best entry of this veteran director, protagonist of so many battles and an erudite connoisseur of the cinema which may be compared at the level of let's say Peter Bodganovich.
1273;Great acting, great story line.
1274;I have been a Leonardo DiCaprio fan and he has been one of my favorite actors for years but I didn't really want to admit that to people because he is Leo DiCaprio.
1275;But since his work in this movie and Blood Diamond I feel like he has proven he is more than a pretty boy and can more than hold his own.
1276;Taut action packed cop/organized crime thriller that will hold your attention for the full ride.
1277;Of course Jack is wonderful, but I was really surprised that Leo was awesome!
1278;"He can really act and is easy on the eyes 
1279;Great cast, great story, some surprising twists along the way.
1280;Dicaprio is excellent in this.
1281;One of the best mobb/cop flicks with 3 heavy hitters leading the way.
1282;And I received it timely.
1283;At long last a great movie by Scorese again.
1284;a highly suspenseful cops and gangsters story with the main driver provided by the mutual spy set.
1285;leo D. and Matt Damon are perfect in their parts as """"rats""""."""
1286;Leo is the good rat, who hides among the baddies and has to pretend to be one of them.
1287;Damon is the smooth and admirable bad rat who seems to his environment like a good solid bloke, but the viewer knows better.
1288;A good cast in the cop team includes Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg, the latter being mainly remarkable for his foul mouth and his crucial role in the story's conclusion.
1289;the movie is a remake of an excellent Hongkong movie of a few years ago.
1290;Departed is a classic good.
1291;Lots of blood, but the story remains very true to the Hong Kong original.
1292;The rooftop scenes in the original are much better than in Departed, but DiCaprio, Wahlberg and Damon are all fantastic.
1293;"winning Martin Scorsese, delivering what is undoubtedly his most enthralling film since the masterpiece ""Goodfellas"" (1990)."
1294;With such a high calibre team behind the scenes, the impressive array of A list actors all deliver magnificent performances, complimenting the stark blend of unflinching violence, harrowing, psychological drama and exhilirating, rip.
1295;heading the cast is another stunning performance from the versatile Leonardo Di Caprio as the mentally tortured undercover cop Billy Costigan.
1296;He conveys many dimensions to his character, giving it infinite depth.
1297;His mere presence in the fim enhances the seedy, cut.
1298;This is played with stark realism by Jack Nicholson who is in his best role in some years.
1299;matt Damon plays the snake Colin Sullivan, Costellos mole, and shines in all of his scenes.
1300;Ray's understated performance is oscar worthy!
1301;He possesses a strong screen presence and the way he can shift from being composed to just suddenly gunning down somebody without even blinking, is ever.
1302;Very edge of your seat stuff!
1303;mark Wahlberg is also thoroughly fantastic in his memroable supporting turn as the snide Dignam.
1304;Dignam is, thankfully, on the right side of the law (until the end that is .
1305;Mark Wahlberg richly compiments the rapid flow of the razor sharp dialogue and seemingly breezes into his character almost effortlessly.
1306;Martin Sheen is also of good value too, in his small but effective role of the more sympathetic detective Queenan while Alec Baldwin also delivers a scene.
1307;stealing performance as a passionate though often aggressive cop.
1308;with a gallery of top notch actors, an intriguing screenplay, first.
1309;"class direction, rollercoaster dialogue, ""The Departed"" is an exceptional film, and nothing short of a masterpiece."
1310;the extras on this double disc set are all fascinating.
1311;they include additional scenes with introductions by Martin Scorsese and documentaries such as Stranger than fiction:The story of the Boston Mob, The real Life Gangster behind Jack Nicholsons character and theatrical trailer.
1312;Excellent value for money!Ian PhillipsSeptember 2009
1313;a better bit rate, more detail, etc.
1314;"I love the ""F"" word and of course it must be used in a movie like this."
1315;Great acting by an absolutely A+ cast.
1316;The director finally received his long awaited oscar for this film and he really earned it especially with this masterpiece.
1317;This is a decent, entertaining picture, but it is not going to go down in history as one of his best, I think, or one of the best pictures of recent years.
1318;the acting is all quite excellent as you would expect from this perhaps too overloaded cast: it almost feels like overkill with all the great actors crammed into this movie in sometimes rather small parts.
1319;The basic storyline, which is almost exactly the same, scene for scene, as in Infernal Affairs, is a pretty neat one, with a lot of nice reversals and twists, though anyone would have to admit that it is a rather unrealistic and implausible series of developments in either movie.
1320;so, certainly recommended for viewing, but the Departed is unlikely to be remembered as one of the true highlights of a fantastic career when all is said and finally done.
1321;I just got a The Departed at Wal.
1322;"A great ""cat and mouse"" thriller between DiCaprio (Billy) and Damon (Colin)."
1323;Leo DiCaprio does not get the girl but does capture her heart.
1324;This is the first Scorsese film I have really enjoyed since 1995's Casino.
1325;All the performances are great, but the real standout here is Jack Nicholson's psychotic mob boss.
1326;Movie: This is Scorsese's Pop.
1327;americana crime thriller and it's unparalleled entertainment.
1328;The film has it all: line after line after quotable line.
1329;well we're just missing out on some interesting stories.
1330;A lot of really good talent, a great story line, and superb acting in this film.
1331;The Departed I found out was a remake of a forgein film from China, but what an amazing job Martin Scorsese did with the cast and script.
1332;I have watched a ton of movies because movies, music, and books are my life.
1333;So if you enjoy Martin Scorsese films and also love a good crime drama movie with lots of great diologue and action mixed with who's working for whom then pick this up and watch this great crime drama movie.
1334;Really good punk rock song to get you going.
1335;The cast in this film is better than any other movie made recently.
1336;This is a trilling, brutal, tragic, and very entertaining movie.
1337;The first third was poor, then things began to pick up a little, and the acting of DeCaprio, Damon and Nicholson was very good .
1338;"yes Nicholson actually was able to step out of his own ""Jackness"" and enmesh himself in the roll ."
1339;"Without the burden of comparison to classic Scorsese works, ""The Departed"" is an enjoyable thriller with an all."
1340;star cast, some of whom deliver better than others.
1341;Nicholson is a master of playing characters which are simultaneously disgusting and compelling, and this role is no exception.
1342;There's lots of great dialog in this film for Nicholson.
1343;"There are a number of moments in the film where he pulls out the Good Will Hunting, and you think to yourself ""Oh Geez."""
1344;He is excellent as the extremely vulgar and abusive Sgt. Dignam, of whom I wanted to see more.
1345;the best part of the film, though, is Leonardo DiCaprio, who's central performance as Billy Costigan is excellent to the point that Matt Damon seems diminished in the complementary role of Colin Sullivan.
1346;The suspense lies in who will discover whom first.
1347;wrecking enterprise?One last thing, I just remembered that Alec Baldwin is in the film, and he is quite good as well!
1348;Scorcese is a visual genius, I mean he is able to center the whole film and the whole action on the feelings, suffering and pleasure he can concentrate in the eyes of his actors that are piercing and even branding our own eyes that are trying to imagine the inside of their minds like voyeurs launched onto a world of violence and paranoid thirst for power.
1349;The art of this director is to get his actors into situations that will create fear in us and to direct these actors so well that our fear will be the simple reflection of the fright they express in their eyes, essentially their eyes, and also their words.
1350;The most important pleasure we find here is that the three main actors are not disappointing our expectations.
1351;Damon is a perfect young prince that can conquer any heart and yet that is so rotten that he appears austere and cold when he turns vicious and fearful.
1352;Dicaprio is the greatest satisfaction for us because he is so well directed that he finds some harshness and he uses his eyes so well that we really believe his lovely face is nothing but the mask of a hyena and his straggling beard is the furious mane of some buzzard.
1353;And yet we tremble for him and we suffer with every anguished tremor on his face.
1354;It is all raw granite and solid quartz.
1355;acting of jack nicoulson was over exaggerated and for sure was notone his best.
1356;This movie is amzing, being in my opinion one of Martin Scorsese's greatest works.
1357;Tons of star power and a gripping story fuel this movie.
1358;The movie pulls no punches and has a gritty feel to it that makes for great viewing.
1359;The movie I got played only once and then stopped working.
1360;If you are looking for a great movie to watch make it this one.
1361;This movie is the best story and picture i have seen from scorsecesedcee.
1362;A must own, especially if you like great acting.
1363;The ending is a trip.
1364;Very intense, so supensful,,,, just an awesome movie jack nicolson is lights out in this movie,, everyone had an intense role in this powerful movie.
1365;This is a good movie and it keeps you guessing the entire time.
1366;This movie and everyones acting was so superb.
1367;really great movie by the way .
1368;Another great film made in and around the great city of Boston.
1369;Best film made in that year for sure
1370;Damon, Wahlberg, and DiCaprio complement Jack Nicholson nicely in this mob drama.
1371;Well OK, it's fiction and well done.
1372;i think Brokeback should have won!
1373;Oh yeah, that was last year.
1374;It is still better movie than this one.
1375;American movies have moved so far in the direction of unconscious self.
1376;"And that is the extent of the ""verisimilitude"" of the film."
1377;(His face is still recognizable.)
1378;the Departed is about as creative as Jack Nicholson's backside but has obviously pleased the video game crowd.
1379;This is an excellent movie.
1380;lots of action, a complex plot with many twists, and stellar performances by top.
1381;Great movie, well worth the time and money.
1382;I usually don't get worked up about things like that, but it was a blight on an otherwise perfect movie.
1383;star cast and great storyline made me a believer.
1384;So many twist and turns, they really leave you guessing!
1385;The caliber of the actors and actresses are stunning as well.
1386;This movie is good for a one time watch.
1387;Great remake of a Asian instant classic.
1388;Yes the acting is really good but this movie is nearly a complete copy of the 2002 Chinese film Infernal Affairs,I didnt even know this until i started wathing it,that was really disapointing to me,they are both really,really great movies but this one is still a copy of a great film in Infernal Affairs.
1389;"Martin Scorcese and ""The Departed"" win Best Director and Best Picture at the 79th Annual Academy Awards!"
1390;I viewed it twice to catch everything.
1391;In a nut shell, this film was sensational.
1392;Very few movies are worth the price of admission, but this one is a definite hit.
1393;I have to admit that the film 'the Departed' was an excellent movie with great actors and this story based on true accounts of Whity Bolger (although they do not say so) and really alive with true gangster fever!A VERY GOOD MOVIE!!
1394;is to see films like this.
1395;DiCaprio, fantastic actor, hope he gets deserved recognition
1396;Flawless character execution, priceless actor combination, one of the most intriguing city on earth, then add scorsese and you have a slam.
1397;run, thrill to the bone fantastic movie.
1398;The characters draw the movie goers to their world and holds them in such state of awe, captivated and forever scandalized.
1399;This was a pretty good movie with many twists in the plot.
1400;It kept me guessing until the end and the end comes in a very, very surprising fashion.
1401;It has a great story, and the acting is top.
1402;This movie is just plain amazing and if you don't like it there is something wrong with you.
1403;This is now my new favorite movie.
1404;I just saw this movie for the first time yesterday and I loved it.
1405;Matt Damon is one of my favorite actors, and he does a great job with his acent and so much more.
1406;I recommend this movie to anyone who LOVES A GOOD MOVIE!
1407;Their is so many things I love about this movie.
1408;daddy and played his part perfect.
1409;ray at my friends house and both formats look the same 2 me!)
1410;This is absolutely the best movie in the the past 5 years, let alone 2006.
1411;"From the cast (Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, ""Marky Mark"" Walhberg, Vera Farmiga, Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen, and of course Jack Nicholson), their performances (Jack Nicholson was born to play this part, and Vira Farmiga deserves alot more attention as an ""A"" list star), the story and of course the direction."
1412;Scorsese took it, made it his own, and knocked it right out of the ball park.
1413;The action, comedy, drama, intense violence, and the suspense keep you totally strapped into your seat from beginnnig to end.
1414;The violence isn't cartoony, it's real, intense, and horrifying, the way it should be in a movie.
1415;His tortured performance as an informant inside Costello's gang required (and got) a virtuoso performance.
1416;Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin also were terrific.
1417;The tale seems uses Boston as a backdrop, though it's hard to recognize the city I know so well.
1418;"crosses, ""The Departed"" will definitely provide nearly three hours of lively entertainment."
1419;watch this one on a Saturday night when you have time to enjoy it and hold on for the ride.
1420;This is a great movie that is definitely worth owning becuase you could watch it several times.
1421;I was told this was about Irish Catholics in Boston and so I thought it would an ideal program to show the family on Sunday morning.
1422;I enjoyed all three movies that Scorsese has made with Caprio.
1423;I highly recommend this title.
1424;I should mention that the cast is incredible.
1425;It's a sort of ensemble piece.
1426;Mark W. was incredibly good.
1427;with The Departed, Scorcese shows he is still a great director in the most traditional definition.
1428;His style is still intact even though it incorporates modern film making and technology.
1429;I have to admit, I have only seen a few Scorcese films and I believe him to be a good Director just from those examples.
1430;He has a straight forward style that is character focused and traditional.
1431;There are many tense scenes and the performances by all actors are top notch.
1432;No one can be singled out, everyone is at the top of their game.
1433;From what I know about Scorcese, he draws from his own background of growing up around mobs and Catholicism.
1434;This certainly holds true for Leo's character, who seems to be trying to atone for the sins of his family.
1435;"son roles as well
1436;Throughout the movie, Sullivan and Costigan are dealing with the truth of their own identities and the contradictions that are coming with the roles they've chosen.
1437;Jack Nicholson steals the show.
1438;I wanted to watch a movie about Boston and got something even better.
1439;It's no secret that """"The Departed"""" is a remake of the successful Hong Kong movie."""
1440;I've watched it several months ago and was very impressed.
1441;It is a completely new movie, spiritually.
1442;"Although movies like ""Raging Bull"" and ""Goodfellas"" are classics, and very very well made films, ""The Departed"" is incredible from the amazing cast, interesting soundtrack, to the remarkable editing."
1443;the real standouts of the film are DiCaprio, Mark Wahlberg, and Jack Nicholson.
1444;Leonardo really does give one of the best performances of the year.
1445;He demands respect and he gets it.
1446;His chemistry with Leo and Matt is top.
1447;this is easily one of Scorsese's finest efforts and one of the best films of 2006.
1448;"I can honestly say that Scorsese brilliantly makes ""The Departed"" look like an original and genuine chef."
1449;"I highly recommended this movie as well as ""Infernal Affairs."""
1450;And how refreshing it is to hear some authentic accents!
1451;It was a nice treat to see him play the baddie.
1452;i think that this is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time, and having never seen Internal Affairs, I was rendered speechless by the events at the end of the movie.
1453;I love when something is so riveting that I just don't even see it coming, and that was the case here.
1454;Most movies with a a lot of big actors struggles to find itself but it works in this movie.
1455;The movie doesnt explain what motivates an intelligent, highly motivated character (Damon) to be drawn into being a mob insider.
1456;This is a well done film on the Mafia with Great acting by all the actors and a very good story .
1457;The case on this two disc set is really nice.
1458;It is bluish great metal.
1459;I really enjoyed the special features and love the widescreen format.
1460;they are all just awesome and give superior performances.
1461;It's a thriller, a game of cat and mouse in which a Boston mob moss is trying to use his infiltrator on the police force to find out the identity of the officer who has gone undercover and infiltrated the mafia.
1462;It is a thriller that keeps you going till the very end and I did NOT expect the ending.You must see this movie.
1463;I've seen Martin Scorsese's other films but this one triumphs as the best one so far.
1464;Thank goodness he won an Oscar for it, it deserved it!!
1465;very good movie liked it very much.
1466;appreciate the work of Nicholson and the other actors I hope we will see much more of that great Actor.
1467;one of the best movies ever!
1468;I did and it's thrilling every step of the way.
1469;Flawless acting, great storyline, crazy ending!
1470;The Departed is a gripping, brutal, and unflinching meditation on the sometimes tenuous difference between good and evil.
1471;Comparing it to his other films is to do it a disservice: it is a welcome revisiting of what made this director great in a new way.
1472;the performances vary, but if an Oscar should go to anyone it should be to Jack Nicholson.
1473;"He makes Dicaprio and Damon nearly disappear, and I don't care if he was stealing scenes
1474;He plays Irish mobster Frank Costello, loosely based on Whitey Bulger, and his performance within this genre transcends much of even of the best work done before.
1475;He is hilarious and frightening, repugnant and magnetic all at the same time.
1476;With these two Scorsese made a bet and I'm not sure he came out on the winning end.
1477;Any Nicholson fan has to see this: its like his ultimate Ode to all the Bada** characters he's played so brilliantly over the years.
1478;It is a testament to Scorsese's genius that despite some fatal flaws he's made yet another film that isn't likely to leave my mind or the mind of most people who see this for years to come.
1479;He's earned more than one.
1480;com does a great job with customer service as well.
1481;If you enjoy mob movies this is one for you.
1482;This is a funny movie.
1483;Great Movie , good story plot , and its Martin Scorsese once again at his best !
1484;damon fine as informant, DiCaprio even better as police infiltrator of mob gang, and Wahlberg won best supporting actor as obscenitities laden police inspector who understands it all,and is suspended for his efforts.
1485;But Nicholson really steals the show as mafia leader who seems born for the role.
1486;This film easily swept the Academy Awards in 2007, winning Best Picture, Best Director, Best Editor and Best Adapted Screenplay.
1487;The film is packed with A. list talent"
1488;"the screenplay for ""The Departed"" is among the best ever written for a crime drama, it keeps the action moving at a fast clip and delivers clever dialogue alongside fantastic character development."
1489;"Martin Scorsese won his first Academy award for Best Director for this picture
1490;delayed honor for one of America's greatest directors.
1491;It's easy to see why Scorsese won for this film, it is yet another brilliant expose of his masterful skill as a director.
1492;jack Nicholson dominates this film.
1493;His performance as crime boss Frank Costello is brilliant and seems to come effortlessly to this living legend of the silver screen.
1494;From Nicholson's opening line, he outshines the other actors with screen presence alone, and then eclipses them altogether with his classic line deliveries.
1495;undercover cop Billy Costigan is perfectly performed, illustrating Scorsese's continued ability to draw out DiCaprio's best interpretations.
1496;Damon also works well under Scorsese, portraying the duplicitous, crooked cop Colin"
1497;mark Wahlberg's character Staff Seargent Dingnam is all wit and constant profanity, giving him the majority of the hilarious one.
1498;liners and zingers in this film.
1499;Martin Sheen provides a perfect counterbalance to Wahlberg's character as Chief Queenan.
1500;Ray Winstone also delivers a superb performance as the menacing, authoritative Mr. French, Costello's most trusted enforcer.
1501;the music of The Rolling Stones constantly drones in and out during the film, providing excellent atmosphere for a crime flick set on the mean streets.
1502;"The Departed is a instant classic, a great movie for fans of gritty, violent crime dramas ala ""The Sopranos""."
1503;Scorsese continues to exhibit his mastery for this genre of film, his best work to date.
1504;Very cheap price for a great movie .
1505;filled cast, Leonardo DiCaprio shines as an undercover cop.
1506;"Nicholson is Nicholson
1507;Nice twists involving modern technology.
1508;A little long, but highly enjoyable.
1509;One of the best movies in the last few years.
1510;Loosly based on resently captured """"Whitey"""" Bulger with Jack Nickleson playing his role."""
1511;Good drama, suprises and plot twists.
1512;Based in Boston the accents are good and the backgrounds are spot on.
1513;This was an outstanding cast for a remarkably tightly made film.
1514;Jack Nicholson steals every scene he is in, as usual, but in this case, his character is so terrible, he is truly fascinating.
1515;but the real revelation of this film is Di Caprio.
1516;he has been putting in solid performances in The Aviator, Blood Diamond, and is completely spellbinding in The Departed.
1517;This is fast moving and utterly fascinating.
1518;fantastic,lifechanging,as I changed my feelings about the war,the President,and the country in general.
1519;super movie great plot and good twists and turns to movie i highly recomend for adult viewing watch multiple times
1520;The Departed is one of the best films I've seen recently.
1521;The story is a complicated one and I had to watch it a second time to really understand the plot.
1522;The second disk gives a good summary of Scorcese's career.
1523;why these great actors would lend their names and reputations to such stuff is beyond me.
1524;This movie is in my opinion brilliantly done.
1525;I absolutely loved this film.
1526;it was one of those rare cinematic occasions when I sat through the entire two and a half hours without getting up once.
1527;It is a spellbinding tale of Corruption, Deceit and Murder, set in the heart of Boston's underbelly.
1528;"If you like Jack Nicholson.your in for a feast, this could possibly be his best performance since ""The Shining""."
1529;You'll be able to watch this one again and again.
1530;It even adds a twist the Hong Kong version didn't.
1531;Jack and Dicaprio were magical.
1532;The chick who played Damon's girlfriend also was fantastic.
1533;The screenplay, as well as Marty's direction were sensational, especially in building on the who will catch you first theme?
1534;after seeing about 1/2 hour (the middle of the movie) I knew that I must see all of it.
1535;It is one of Leo's finest.
1536;fully receommended to keep you on yhe edge of your seat.
1537;"The movie has great actors who do their job splendidly
1538;There are several things I really liked about this movie.
1539;This movie places you in Boston.
1540;Scorsese's attention to detail pays off here.
1541;I liked the various dialects.
1542;I liked the fact that some of the guys were right off the boat from Ireland.
1543;The mixing of scene and music was great.
1544;The themes of the movie: identity, class in America, personal secrecy vs. openness, etc. were well delineated.
1545;There was the classic Scorsese humor.
1546;It seems to me that this is one of Scorsese's main themes: life is violent and brutal, but still, we can laugh at it.
1547;But still, he is great in it.
1548;DiCaprio is really good, expressing the multitude of emotions of someone who doesn't know who to trust, or even what his own identity should be.
1549;This movie is both sad and funny, all at once.
1550;But it is a very good movie.
1551;THE DEPARTED is Scorsese at his most professional and entertaining but it feels like he could have directed it in his sleep, by which I mean all the elements of the script and charactes are clever, and the involvement of the government on a high level a new twist, but he's done it all before, and better in GOODFELLAS and the underrated CASINO.
1552;This movie set in Boston really pulls you in with the high level of suspense associated with the story as it unfolds, and the realistically (for once) fast paced and often desperate action/reaction between the main characters.
1553;Lots of unexpected twists and turns right to the very end and a great cast to deliver the goods.
1554;The Movie speaks for itself .
1555;Well, I finally got around to watching this movie"
1556;phones as an important plot device.
1557;"but several times I muttered to myself ""what a good movie."""
1558;Some really over the top acting by an all.
1559;Lots of tricky movie fun.
1560;Great movie, Good pace to the action and a fine story line.
1561;"Now that this film has received the Best Picture oscar, and Martin Scorcese has been named (finally) Best Director, many will think that both recognitions are ""sympathy"" or ""payback"" moves on the part of the academy."
1562;the performances and delivered drama in this movie are outstanding.
1563;A great group of actors were assembled to make this film what it is.
1564;The writing, which Scorcese had a huge influence on, was outstanding.
1565;Departed, though, was a memorable film experience, and, especially given its length, its ability to sustain interest was intrinsic and not layered on.
1566;watch the movie and see if you agree.
1567;Oh, and did I mention that Jack Nicholson was able to deliver a performance without self.
1568;If there is a lesson here, it is this: stick with the truth.
1569;An undercover cop working a mob boss, while a cop is working undercover for the mob.
1570;The cast didn't hurt either: DiCaprio, Damon, Nicholson, Baldwin, Wahlberg, and Sheen belong to an elite crowd, and can all turn in strikingly realistic performances.
1571;laced kid who grew up under the wing of mob boss Frank Costello, played demonically well by Jack Nicholson, and who later joins the police force and works his way quickly up the ranks.
1572;billy Corrigan, played with impressive range by DiCaprio, is to Sullivan what a negative is to a photograph.
1573;He grew up surrounded by all of the wrong influences, but rose above it to become a cop.
1574;There are both surprising and predictable plot twists, but what impressed me most was how every action taken by a character had an affect on another character or characters.
1575;Scorcese kept the violence close, not to shock or abhor us, but to make those scenes that much more believable .
1576;He was at once brutal and vulnerable.
1577;Luckily, they were guided well.4 stars, rounded up to 5.
1578;while there have been several scorsese movies ive liked more, im glad he finally got that oscar .
1579;that said, this is a fine (if a trifle too lengthy) gangster flick, highlighted by strong performanes all.
1580;Her works in the Boston police department as an informant for Costello.
1581;i really enjoyed this film.
1582;I was on the edge of my seat for at least 90% of the movie.
1583;It's got an impressive ensemble casts.
1584;Dicaprio gives one of the best performances that I can remember, and it's great to see Jack Nicholson as a real bad guy again.
1585;the movie has great acting across the board.
1586;And at that, he's succeeded on all levels in my opinion.
1587;But overall, I think this is destined to be a classic in the crime thriller genre.
1588;"what sounds like a basic everyday cop drama, is elevated to Academy Award status thanks to great performances by DiCaprio, Damon, Jack Nicholson (""As Good As It Gets"") the mob boss, Mark Wahlberg (""Shooter""), Vera Farmiga (""Orphan"") as a woman both Damon and DiCaprio fall for and many other supporting players."
1589;"also having Martin Scorsese (""Shutter Island"") as your director really adds some nice punch and spice to this movie, as there aren't many directors who could handle this big of a cast and handle it as well as he does."
1590;The story is also very layered, plenty of stuff going on with some good side stories.
1591;The best performances to me were DiCaprio as I feel this was his major breakout role, Damon was great as well and Wahlberg was fantastic especially in the closing scenes.
1592;its quite possibly as close to a perfect cop drama as you'll get, just great from start to finish.
1593;Excellent cast, story and directing!
1594;this is one of those movies that hooks you up till the end.
1595;the blu ray version looks awsome and sound good a good choice for anyone.
1596;Nicholson's portrayal of Costello is endemic of this.
1597;having said that, I felt that both DiCaprio and Damon were solid in their performances.
1598;Scorcese did a great job of juxtapositioning their characters, and that really is the heart of the movie.
1599;Although I have a mixed review, overall I enjoy it and I was happy to see Scorcese earn an overdue Best Director Oscar.
1600;drama im so glad that he won for best picture and director.
1601;After seeing it I was dissapointed with it.
1602;The movie keeps your interest with a great cast and a story about an investigation into an Irish mobster in Boston.
1603;performances by Nicholson, Sheen and DiCaprio are great.
1604;Even The Simpsons made fun of that.
1605;This is a fantastic film, perhaps the best I've seen this year!
1606;Scorsese has created a masterpiece and its name is The Departed.
1607;Was all I could say as I left the theater (same reaction from my two buds who tagged along) and called damn near everyone I knew who enjoyed a good movie.
1608;After this film I see all of the before mentioned actors in a whole new light.
1609;This film is definitely at the top of my favorites list!
1610;This is simply a good movie.
1611;In my own opinion, it was outstanding.
1612;As with any Leonardo DiCaprio film it's funny, serious, clever, and just plain good.
1613;Scorcese's best since Raging Bull.
1614;you loved to hate him in this role, same for Alec Baldwin who is always great!
1615;A relative suggested that I watch this.
1616;Glad I went back and watched, very good movie.
1617;The best part was the end when everybody got shot.
1618;If you're looking for something uplifting, or a Bruce.
1619;style action movie, pass this one up.
1620;Great performances by Jack Nicholson, Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio put a lot of oomph into this movie.
1621;Leonardo DiCaprio should have received actor of the year.
1622;the movie was a good price, received on time and in new condition.
1623;Like most people, I watched this movie mainly just because of the impressive star power of the cast.
1624;And it is quite an impressive cast: Leonardo Dicaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, and directed by Martin Scorese.
1625;utilized, but I thought all the main actors in this movie were given at least a couple great scenes to chew the screen up.
1626;It always looked kind of interesting.)
1627;The Departed is set in Boston and revolves around the Irish.
1628;For my two cents I would liked to have seen a more interesting ending.
1629;but the movie definately held my attention for the time I was watching it.
1630;Damn this movie was great.
1631;I'm going to go see it again!
1632;"I enjoyed the movie very much and it sure was a ""departure"" from movies I've seen in the recent past."
1633;Great acting, excelent plot, I think it had the appropriate ammount of gore and violence especially dealing with the subject matter.
1634;Oscar winner what does that say?
1635;These movie arrived quickly and is in good condition.
1636;It so detracts from the actual story.
1637;Leonardo should have won an oscar already.
1638;This is a great movie keeps you at the edge of your seat all the way to the end.
1639;Great acting, super story and wonderful drama and suspense!
1640;All actors are truly Oscar worthy here.
1641;quite an awesome story line.
1642;Thrilling till to the end of the movie.
1643;Director Martin Scorsese, who has often been hailed as one of the best directors of all time, has had his share of success in Hollywood.
1644;"With hits such as ""Raging Bull"", ""Goodfellas"", ""The Aviator"", and ""Casino"", it's easy too understand just how he got to be so successful."
1645;"After taking a break from directing mafia themed movies for a while, his last mafia movie was ""Casino"", Scorsese returns to the subject matter that has treated him so well in the past, and delivers audiences what could easily be his best work to date, ""The Departed""."
1646;The Departed is an intricate cat.
1647;Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a hot.
1648;with such an excellent cast of actors ranging from veterans Jack Nicholson (easily giving one of his best performances), Martin Sheen, and Alec Baldwin to younger, yet experienced, actors Leonardo DiCaprio (giving his best performance as well), Mark Wahlberg, and Matt Damon, it's no surprise that Scorsese came through with such an incredible movie experience.
1649;"The writing from veteran writer William Monahan (writer of ""Kingdom of Heaven"") is tight, never letting up with the twists and turns, while still managing to keep the movie from being confusing to the audience."
1650;"Martin Scorsese, after a long and successful career, has finally achieved that which has always eluded him, a Best Director's Oscar for his work here, and I have two things to say about that
1651;This represents the first and only time so far that Scorsese has won Best Director at the Academy Awards (even though he still deserved others).
1652;But at the very least he was able to win it for what I see as his best film.
1653;The master of all things movies and mafia, Martin Scorsese, returns to top form with 'The Departed.'
1654;he once again reinvents the crime genre, taking an ingeniously plotted story and through his vintage techniques, as well as a fantastic cast, he elevates a cops.
1655;He's got his hands in everything from protection to drugs to selling defense microchips to the Chinese.
1656;Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a hot.
1657;headed young cop fresh out of the academy with family ties to Costello.
1658;He's a promising young officer, and quickly works his way through the ranks until he gets promoted into the SIU.
1659;This plot setup leads to some suspenseful sequences, including a superior one when a confrontation between the cops and Costello is coming down to the wire and the cops and Frank continually get tipped off by their respective moles.
1660;There is also another terrific scene when Colin finds Billy's number and calls him.
1661;scorsese shines here more than he has in years, mostly due to the subject matter.
1662;DiCaprio and Damon both show what they're made in their best performances yet.
1663;Damon shows off his dark side, but allows just enough of charm to ease through as so not to make Colin completely hateful.
1664;hand man Mr. French) all shine and each get a moment of their own.
1665;It actually provides a nice twist or two in the story.
1666;the film may not be the most original or artistic film of the year, but it certainly qualifies as the most entertaining endeavor the cinema has had to offer all year long.
1667;pleasing and emotionally satisfying ending in any film this year.
1668;so maybe this will finally get Scorsese that way.
1669;And even if he doesn't, 'The Departed' is some of his best work ever and an American crime masterpiece.
1670;one of the best movie by Martin Scorcesse again based by remake of Infernal Affairs Movies.
1671;brilliant cast by Leonardo DiCaprio,Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg and the others.
1672;I had seen the movie in the theater and found it very intense and riveting adult movie.
1673;This movie was SO good.
1674;Nicholson and Damon were good, but Leonardo stole the show.
1675;A hardcore true to life cop story and a verysurprising ending.
1676;Of course it is rated R for content but wow what a movie.
1677;He did an excellent job and movie was terrific,.
1678;The Departed is the kind of movie you have to pay attention to at all times.
1679;There's a mob guy working inside the police and there's a undercover officer working inside the mob.
1680;the movie has an all star cast .
1681;They all play their parts exceptionally well.
1682;MOVIE: So, Scorsese is making a movie, you say?
1683;The brilliant part of it is that during the entire introduction we never see Jack Nicholson's face in the light, he is always in the darkness and only until he is finished with his speech does he step into the light.
1684;All you need to know is that Leo DiCaprio plays a rejected cop who is chosen to do this dirty undercover job to help arrest mob boss Frank Costello, played brilliantly by Jack Nicholson.
1685;The movie has so many brilliantly constructed characters that not one person overshadows another.
1686;There is so much going on yet is incredibly focused thanks to a brilliant adapted screenplay by William Monahan.
1687;He has a bright future ahead of him.
1688;talk about brilliant direction, this movie has Marty Scorsese written all over it, it is oozing with Scorsese.
1689;He used a red color tone in one scene with Jack Nicholson and these two girls as he throws cocaine all over the place, and I thought it was brilliant.
1690;At the climactic shootout at the end he uses a stylized way of freeze stopping the frame, which I thought was really cool.
1691;The way the scenes are structured are sharp, quick, and intense.
1692;The storylines play out smoothly and they work.
1693;The lines are sharp, funny, meaningful, and they really shape out each individual character.
1694;Howard Shore's score rarely comes in, but when it does it is a unique and effective way to move the scenes along.
1695;all in all this is a brilliant film.
1696;If Amazon would allow half star intervals I would rate this film 4.5 stars.
1697;aCTING: This is the best cast I have ever seen assembled on screen.
1698;Every actor here is at the top of their game.
1699;Jack Nicholson is brilliantly menacing in this movie and will be nominated for his supporting role, maybe even walk away with the win.
1700;Ray Winstone shines as Frank's right hand man and it's nice to see him becoming more prominent in American cinema.
1701;Mark Wahlberg is amazingly sharp and witty in his role and gets some of the biggest chuckles from his lines.
1702;We get more great support from Alec Baldwin and Martin Sheen, both turning in great performances.
1703;The Departed is a modern American classic that shows Scorsese doing what he does best.
1704;The Aviator was good, Gangs Of New York was great, The Departed is amazing.
1705;Marty, baby, we love ya!
1706;I thought this movie would be rough around the edges with a great story, as most of Scorcese's films are.
1707;DiCaprio's performance was great, but it didn't redeem this film.
1708;I long for movies that are actually entertaining, and this film is not among those.
1709;I recommend this film to masochists only.
1710;A captivating movie by director Martin Scorsese, with multiple first.
1711;The story line is strong, compeling and will keep your undivided attention throughout the movie.
1712;This movie is a great one to watch for anybody that likes a bit of action.
1713;The plot's great, the actors do a very nice job (DiCaprio actually does some great acting, even after he threw a funny African accent in Blood Diamond), and the music blended with the movie very well.
1714;Of course, you gotta like Nicholson.
1715;He's ruthless and cruel, yet his role as an Irish mob boss is pretty much perfect.
1716;I was so glad that this film won so many awards.
1717;One of the best movies I've seen in a long time.
1718;Highly recommend for anyone interested in the Boston Mafia.
1719;good action movie with that keeps u intrigued right to the end grt for ppl who likes to keep guessing how it will end
1720;Leonardo is a deep, under.
1721;This last scene is worth the price of the movie all by itself.
1722;This movie is simply a masterpiece.
1723;It is a good translating as I can see.
1724;The acting, directing, writing, cinematography, everything.
1725;The packaging is very solid as is expected of a steelbook and house the blu.
1726;Hard to imagine anything better and it is of course extremely collectible in this package!
1727;Now Scoresese has brought us """"The Departed,"""" to prove to us once again why he's one of the few directors to get his name above the title of the movies he directs."""
1728;it's used in so many unique and interesting ways, that if you took it out I don't think you would have a movie anymore.
1729;What also makes the movie work are the excellent performances from all the principle actors.
1730;Jack Nicholson proves once again why he's a living legend on the screen, Matt Damon shows that he is a very underrated actor, and Leonardo DiCaprio steps up to the plate to reenforce the notion that he is the next Robert DeNiro.
1731;It's Jack Nicholson who takes up most of the screen time though, and is fascinating to watch from beginning to end.
1732;"still, at the end of the day ""The Departed"" is still a great movie with great writing, acting, and tension."
1733;It's smart, it keeps you at the edge of your feet, and there are several moments where you don't know where the movie is going, and you will be shocked at where it does go sometimes.
1734;"But if you can stomach this, then by all means enjoy ""The Departed,"" one of the best films of the year."
1735;Loved this gangster mob flim.
1736;It was unpredictable and smart.
1737;Completely believable characters with depth.
1738;Great acting and well written.
1739;Definitely deserved the oscar it received.
1740;Best movie I have seen in ages.
1741;Every time Martin Scorsese releases a new picture, the Oscar talk begins.
1742;The Aviator, his last Best Picture nominee, is a handsome biopic bolstered by good performances.
1743;"in no way did ""Gangs of New York"" deserve to be among the top five films of it's year."
1744;The Departed is this year's candidate, and I have no doubt it will receive many accolades from the Academy.
1745;"It's a vastly entertaining tale based on Hong Kong's ""Infernal Affairs."""
1746;but it certainly brings back a life and passion absent from some of his recent efforts.
1747;The Departed does remind you of the pictures made on the mean streets of Scorsese's earlier classics.
1748;And while the film is abundantly entertaining, thrilling and twisty.
1749;It's a terrific plot well executed.
1750;You can't help but be impressed with the layer upon layer of complexity as our characters live in worlds that are based on lies.
1751;matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio give fully realized, dynamic performances.
1752;It may be a career high for both actors.
1753;i appreciated their immersion into these men.
1754;their lives parallel beautifully even though they are at odds.
1755;Nice characterizations from Mark Wahlberg and Martin Sheen are highlights as well.
1756;one element in the film that has been debated is Jack Nicholson's performance, however.
1757;top portrait actually serves the film well.
1758;I enjoyed his antics and it worked as a suitable counterpoint to the younger performers.
1759;she is more of a plot convenience than a real asset to the film.
1760;It's a huge suspension of belief to put her into the middle of things.
1761;"i definitely recommend ""The Departed."""
1762;Close to a great film, it's deliriously entertaining.
1763;His protege Colin, played by Matt Damon, has joined the police force and works as a detective.
1764;Who will catch who first?The Departed is visually stunning, as any Scorsese fan will tell you is to be expected, but besides that it's enthralling.
1765;The characters are richly drawn and the emotions run high in this crime drama/thriller.
1766;It's also a story with so many twists and turns it was hard to keep up.
1767;It was great and multi.
1768;planned crime capers, and films about organized crime will love The Departed.
1769;Another fine Scorsese entry in crime noir.
1770;This movie, once it gets going, kept my husband and I on the edge of our seats!
1771;At times we both found ourselves holding our breath so long we thought we'd pass out.
1772;All the actors were wonderful, the story was tense and well done.
1773;I was on the edge of my seat.
1774;"Powerful movie, real life, so takes a little getting used to ""being with the boys""."
1775;The film and the director are.
1776;"hope the ""baby"" has a good life."
1777;iA, is all about heart.
1778;Costigan is wholesomely good, and Sullivan is utterly bad.
1779;Their characters are so one.
1780;Are we also to believe that Sullivan can rise through the ranks of the police force so fast, considering that (also 'cleverly' explained by Ellerby) they don't trust people with perfect records?
1781;In IA, it is a convincing many years.
1782;TD just throws it in our face.
1783;Does Dignam have a great enough agenda to do what he did?g.
1784;Even the dialog of some of the scenes is directly translated from the original.
1785;Which brings me toProduction value .
1786;I love GoodFellas, and his style and techniques at that time seem fresh and ingenious.
1787;MAD at the people who say this movie is brilliant.
1788;It is brilliant only because the original is brilliant and they had taken almost every element of it.
1789;All of the mobsters mumble, making them hard to understand, but this is a visual story and a striking one at that.
1790;the movie is intense and thrilling, but definitely only for those who like tough crime dramas.
1791;"Lots of very good actors, but they used the ""F"" word about six times a minute."
1792;This is the best film of the year and Martin Scorsese's best to date.
1793;time Oscar Nominee) (as Billy Costigan and also in his third movie with Scorsese), Matt Damon (Golden Globe and Oscar Winner) (as Colin Sullivan), Jack Nicholson (3.
1794;time Oscar Winner and 7.
1795;time Golden Globe Winner) (as Frank Costello) and Mark Wahlberg (as Dignam) give the best performances of the career and they are also backed up by an impressive supporting cast.
1796;The directing by Scorsese (Golden Globe Winner and 6.
1797;time Oscar Nominee) is brilliant!
1798;"The screenplay by William Monahan (won Oscar) (who wrote the screenplay to ""Kingdom Of Heaven"" (2005), which was based on the Asian movie ""Infernal Affairs"" or ""Wi jian dao"", written by Siu Fai Mak and Felix Chong, is brilliant!"
1799;time Oscar and Golden Globe Winner) is brilliant!
1800;"The cinematography by Michael Ballhaus (Oscar nominated for his work in Scorsese's and DiCaprio's ""Gangs Of New York"" (2002) is brilliant!"
1801;"The film editing (won Oscar) by Thelma Schoonmaker (Won 2 Oscars for her work on Scorsese's ""Raging Bull"" (1980) and ""The Aviator"" (2004), which also starred DiCaprio) is brilliant!"
1802;"The casting by Ellen Lewis (who was worked with Scorsese since ""New York Stories"" (1989) is brilliant!"
1803;"The production design by Kristi Zea (who was worked with Scorsese on ""New York Stories"" (1989) and ""Goodfellas"" (1990), was nominated for an Oscar for her work) is brilliant!"
1804;thayer and Nicholas Lundy is brilliant!
1805;The set decoration by Leslie E. Rollins is brilliant!
1806;"The costume design by Sandy Powell (won an Oscar for her work on ""The Aviator"" and was nominated for an Oscar for her work on ""Gangs Of New York"" and has been nominated a total of 5 times) is brilliant!"
1807;This is smart and intelligent and should be remembered on Oscar night (it was, winning for Best Picture and Best Director for Scorsese), because the performances of the cast are Oscar.
1808;This is a movie that will keep you surprised and going back for more, this is how brilliant this film really is.
1809;The film is destined to become a classic due to many aspects.
1810;It will also become known as the one which finally won Martin Scorsese a long overdue Academy Award for Directing.
1811;among the other reasons the classic label shall be thrust upon this great piece of filmmaking is an intense, but twist.
1812;filled tale of cat and mouse, good and evil, gangster and cop, and pure americana.
1813;The last bit is a tad ironic since it's a remake of a Japanese thriller from a few years ago.
1814;with a cast including Leonardo DiCaprio, Jack Nicholson, Matt Damon, Martin Sheen, Mark Wahlberg, Alec Baldwin, Anthony Anderson and others, the actors alone make this a film to behold.
1815;While on the other hand, Matt Damon grew up admiring Costello and moving up the ranks within the Massachusets State Police through hard work and cunning.
1816;He's always thinking one step ahead of his superiors.
1817;the movie is overall fun if nothing else.
1818;For the movie buff who enjoyed Casino, Mean Streets, Goodfellas or any other underground urban gangster film, this is their type of adventure.
1819;Even for some waiting and hoping again for the classic Nicholson craziness audiences love.
1820;Every frame is filled with either excitement, great drama, fantastic acting, or shocking gasp.
1821;even the music, Scorseses masterful use of classic rock songs from the Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd (redone by someone else, unsure of who.)
1822;from the streets of deep, dark Boston, the story of brotherhood on both sides of the law is intriguing and disturbing and and joy to behold.
1823;I saw it prior to the whole Oscar thing and most of the time, I don't like the movies that recieve high honors in that arena.
1824;The music is sooooooo awesome and got me into it right from the start.
1825;This is by far one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time (I have since watched it 3 times now).
1826;The whole good cop, bad cop storyline is so intriguing.
1827;There are many questions I had at the end.
1828;The music, the acting and the plot gets you going from the start.
1829;watch it, listen to the soundtrack and enjoy!!!
1830;Finally, a best picture that I think really deserved best picture.
1831;The Departed features great performances, a very well built story, and enough twists to keep you constantly engaged.
1832;"On the other hand 1999's ""Bringing Out the Dead"" is easily the most underrated film of Scorsese's career, so his talents have not been as sorely missed as some may suggest."
1833;"But all that aside, when watching ""The Departed"" one can not help but get a little worked up and excited by the fact that for this film Scorsese is doing what Scorsese does best: producing a violent, incredibly foul mouthed, fast paced, uber."
1834;masculine, religion shadowed, highly entertaining movie.
1835;i say that this kind of film is what Scorsese does best, but really the kind of film this is is a Scorsese film.
1836;He invented this particular style of storytelling and is still the only one who can truly pull it off.
1837;The violence is realistic and blatant.
1838;The colourful language is appropriate.
1839;The characters, situations, locations all feel right, and all because Scorsese knows this material like he knows his own NY neighborhood.
1840;Of course it is ultimately a movie, and Scorsese uses his incredible skill as a director and his uncanny use of music and editing to achieve this effect, but with Scorsese, unlike those who imitate him, the whole fabrication of the film feels honest.
1841;He's using the full cinematic language to create the tone of the material he is presenting, and it is his skill at achieving this `feel' of the film that is his true brilliance.
1842;"and ""The Departed"" is one of his best."
1843;The story may take place in Boston rather than New York and the characters may be Irish rather than Italian, but Scorsese still manages to create a pitch perfect tone for the film.
1844;The playfulness of his direction is refreshing and it adds great energy to the film.
1845;"The entire film is reminiscent of the last act of ""GoodFellas"", where the editing and cinematography become such an essential part of evoking the events on screen that they carry and drive the material."
1846;The content is exciting to be sure, but Scorsese's willingness to experiment and play with the form of the film is its greatest success.
1847;the material is certainly striking though.
1848;The story of police corruption and organized crime is excellent and the talent brought to the film by its incredible cast is remarkable.
1849;DiCaprio is skittish and compelling, Damon tough and commanding, and Nicholson, as always, outrageous and grand.
1850;The film does well to balance action with character and it achieves a pace and tone succinct enough to carry its near three hour run time.
1851;Pace is essential to a film and with regards to it Scorsese is truly one of the masters.
1852;The Departed like most of his films is fast enough to generate interest but confident enough to sustain it.
1853;The Departed is the best film of the year so far and not because it questions the nature of humanity or inspires us to seize the day or whatever.
1854;It is great because it is honest, enjoyable, never pretentious, and always invigorating.
1855;It reminds us why Scorsese is one of the all time greats and if an Oscar has been deserved in recent years for him than it is for this film above the others.
1856;It may not be as large in scale or budget, or as much of a stretch as recent material, but it is what Scorsese, and only Scorsese, does best.
1857;A thrill story about morality and faith: how to be serene when one's true identity has been disguised yet life is your chip on this big game.
1858;The ending is also an intriguing surprise, to which reflects more truth on our real lives: life is not always a fair deal.
1859;if you explore this movie with American culture and background, you will find this movie.
1860;First of all, I wanna say this cast is amazing.
1861;Of course, we all know Jack Nicholson always delivers the goods, but Matt Damon, Leonardo Dicaprio and Mark Walhberg were absolutely amazing as well.
1862;This movie is full of star power.
1863;"Again, that's always classic ""gangster"" movie fashion."
1864;That's all I'll say to keep from spoiling the ending.
1865;Full of great acting and a great story.
1866;Every action they take is carefully thought out to see if their cover will be blown.
1867;But it has a satisfying ending that is sure to please all.
1868;You notice something new each time you see it.
1869;this is a good movie for adults, liked the all star cast.
1870;lots of twists and turns.
1871;This is by far one of my favorite Jack Nicholson roles.
1872;He does a brilliant job playing a mobster, he was very convincing in this role and I can't think of anyone that would have done a better job.
1873;Leonardo DiCaprio was also very believable is his role.
1874;The very last scene is by far the best scene of the movie.
1875;I will admit, I'm not a big Mark Wahlberg fan but he made me proud in this movie.
1876;Be prepared, much violence, great romantic plot, outstanding cast.
1877;that short belly tie was hilarious!!
1878;This is a must see .
1879;To see him and Jack Nicholson in one short scene together was a treat.
1880;it was a good story and Vera Farmiga was a plus.
1881;As an example of the art of storytelling, of mystery writing (and it really was a mystery genre pretending to be a police/crook genre, whatever that is called), it did a good job but the emotion of the drama was subsumed under the action and gunshots.
1882;THE SOPRANOS does it better, with less detail perhaps, and a lot more emotional impact.
1883;But I was happy the latter got killed and I hope Tony finds a way out, sad to say.
1884;Scorsese broke Mamet's rule, and it hurt the scene.
1885;By the way, his name is pronounced SKOR.
1886;One format or the other, though, you must own this movie!
1887;This is a good movie.
1888;Matt Damon and Leo D are really good in this.
1889;This movie has so many great actors!
1890;It won best picture and it was well deserved!
1891;Sorry to all in the cast.
1892;This is one of my favorite movies!
1893;Amazon got it to me in no time flat, thanks for the amazing service!!!
1894;This flick has it all.
1895;Overall this is a great movie.
1896;It has all one would expect from Scorsese and the top name stars.
1897;Scorsese know what he would get, it is most likely what he wanted and that is why he picked Nicholson for the part.
1898;Maybe it is because he could never really act, or maybe, as I think, he has become so full of himself and he inserts his poiltics into his acting, which adversly affects his acting.
1899;"The Departed brings to the screen the parallel stories of two Massachusetts troopers
1900;At some point one will have to give in.
1901;, and the rest of this AMAZING cast, do a very good job in their respective roles!
1902;Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide an evening's entertainment.
1903;A high suspense crime drama where the acting is phenomenal and it is another great movie from director Martin Scorsese.
1904;The original """"Infernal Affairs"""" is the masterpiece."""
1905;"hollywooded"" remake of a great Asian flick."
1906;Intelligent, rather than mindless action.
1907;I went to the theater preparing to love this film.
1908;The critics all praise it and it's a box office hit.
1909;So here we see the two young men at cross purposes.
1910;It's hard to see emotion on their faces.
1911;This romance is all about wisecracks by DiCaprio.
1912;The best acting, of course, is by Jack Nicholson.
1913;He seems to shine in everything he does.
1914;Totally unexpected and just the way a movie should be.
1915;leonardo DiCaprio is superb here.
1916;His growth as an actor is amazing.
1917;"Jack Nicholson is, well, Jack Nicholson, often reminding me of his role in ""The Shining""."
1918;Everyone in this flick does a masterful job.
1919;this is one of the very best movies of all time.
1920;"I'm glad that Scorsese finally won an Oscar, but it's hard to say if this was his best, with ""Goodfellas"", ""Kings of New York"", ""The Aviator"", and the magnificent ""Raging Bull""."
1921;Jack Nicholson is classic, as always.
1922;The Acting was Great by everyone.
1923;Very well directed as usual from Martin Scorsese.
1924;It is brilliantly made, with wonderful characters that are played to the hilt by each actor.
1925;His character is believable, and you can definitely feel for this man who wants to do the best he can, but has to deal with a lot of emotional baggage that comes with being an undercover cop.
1926;Martin and Leo fought to convince Jack to do this film, and boy, are we glad he agreed!
1927;"I wish he's win SOME award for this!Matt Damon's character is all the more chilling because of the traditional ""good boy"" roles he's had in the past."
1928;Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg give the film some good comedic moments while remaining totally immersed in their character.
1929;amazing performances all around!Scorsese's Golden Globe win for the direction in this film was right on!
1930;The acting is so incredible!
1931;Leonardo DiCaprio is impressive in this movie, and it is a good role for Jack Nicholson also.
1932;So how good is this movie.
1933;it's a great movie in the following ways: 1) The script is tightly plotted.
1934;2) It's nice to watch some of the best living American actors all do their thing in a single film.
1935;3) Depending on how you feel about one liners generally, the one liners are good, and very apt.
1936;Most of these actors really brought their A. games though.
1937;This seems contrary to the recent films of most of the lead actors, as well as for director Martin Scorcese.
1938;There's a lot of editorial juxtaposition, cutting back and forth, and it can get a bit obvious .
1939;I thought great, Donnie Brasco type of a movie where FBI goes undercover and blah blah blah.
1940;Jack seems to always be great!
1941;Mark W. was good as well as Matt Damon.
1942;I thought for sure with all these good actors that the story script would get lost.
1943;"I kept thinking to myself, ""This is a good good good movie!!"""
1944;I recommend this movie just for the mere thought of entertainment with all these good actors.
1945;I wasn't disappointed and I thought for sure i was going to be!
1946;Undoubtedly a tough, gritty good guy/bad guy movie with a very good storyline.
1947;The cast of big name actors bring home an entertaining thriller that kept this viewer engrossed in the story without let.
1948;our favorite way to really grasp all of the words and content.
1949;Great movie with a all star cast of great actors.
1950;One of the best movies i ever saw.
1951;the movie has a little of everything action, comedy and suspense to say the least.
1952;Good cast and well acted.
1953;Violent and profane film, but totally realistic for the story line and characters.
1954;Long film, but holds interest.
1955;I liked the movie, but its ORDINARY.
1956;I will note that I thought Leo Dicaprio's performance was really good.
1957;He took a mediocre script and did his best to still pull off an amazing performance on his part.
1958;He acts the same in every movie he's done the past 20 years.
1959;otherwise dont go into this thinking you're going to see the best movie ever made.
1960;Great story based on an infamous gangster, favorite actors and good director.
1961;A true classic for many years to come.
1962;I really like watching this movie so I what it a few times a year.
1963;The cost was low and all worthwhile.
1964;I must say this movie was to me one of the best of the year.
1965;He proves himself and gets inside a mob run by boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson).
1966;this movie is thrilling in how the plot unravels with true skill.
1967;The cast, soundtrack, dialogue, location.
1968;Just know that you can enjoy the movie even if you're not a big Dicaprio buff.
1969;Even if you despise him, you'll still love this flick.
1970;I had high hopes for this film.
1971;This film is fantastic up until the last 10.15 minutes.
1972;if you really MUST see this movie.
1973;This is a powerful movie but a few parts of it are hard to believe, especially toward the end of the film.
1974;It's long but still works.
1975;This is one of my favorite movies.
1976;Great storyline and a great bunch of talented actors!
1977;I highly recommend this movie.
1978;Loved all the actors and the movie itself was well directed.
1979;Top notch acting across the board with big props to DiCaprio and Damon!
1980;Luckily for a girl I enjoy this type of movie or maybe it's just a Matt Damon thing!
1981;Winner of Four Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Film Editing.
1982;From the time it came out it felt like a classic, not only because of Scorcese's signature style of homage and innovation but also for the well.
1983;You really need to see this film at it's original aspect ratio to appreciate how wonderfully it is made.
1984;disc widescreen version, you'll be a lot happier.
1985;This is a classic film by one of the greatest directors of our time.
1986;This movie and its fantastic cast should all be up for Oscars.
1987;This is an Excellent Film!
1988;As usually acting of De Caprio and Matt Damm is marvelous!
1989;Specially the story based on the film is nice.
1990;i strongly recommended this to others!
1991;In a day and age when stunts and special effects seem to carry movies, this movie stands out with superb acting and a very believable plot.
1992;"Although some of the acting is ""over the top"" (no law enforcement agency could survive with such harassment or hazing of its employees) the majority is superb and very believable!"
1993;This is a fine movie if you are home alone or with a date who likes to watch a real movie and talk about it later.
1994;I really enjoyed this movie.
1995;Leonardo DiCaprio is terrific, too.
1996;It's a testament to his immense talent.
1997;The rest of the cast is so.
1998;He's fun for a while, but a weak link in a pretty strong cast.
1999;It gives a hint of the cat and mouse possibilities of having a mole stalking a rat .
2000;I liked his character and his performance immensely.
2001;He makes you engaged when, by all rights, you shouldn't be.
2002;He dominates the screen and the film.
2003;It's worth seeing for that alone.
2004;This gangster movie shows off Leo DiCaprio's amazing acting ability.
2005;hearted character just made you want to root for him throughout.
2006;one of the most amazing movies!
2007;This was a good movie, with a great twist at the END!!!
2008;This is definitely one to watch over and over again.
2009;I never was a DiCaprio fan, but this role is one of the reasons I now enjoy his work.
2010;Jack Nicholson is classic in here, a no nonsense type of wise guy!
2011;it was a great movie had a plot that was easy to catch on to great from beginning to end
2012;I know some people thought that his Oscar was undeserved for this film, but I am positive this is his best work .
2013;even ahead of his DeNiro arc and the brilliance of his later work with DiCaprio.
2014;what Martin achieves here is pure cinematic poetry.2.
2015;"Leonardo DiCaprio in his second best performance of all time : Leo has always been a directors' actor, and I still think his greatest performance of all time has been in ""Blood Diamond"" (another instant classic)."
2016;But his performance here where he overcomes his own acting limitations to literally 'become' the character he plays is admirable.
2017;raw sex appeal, acting chops, and an uncanny knack of knowing how to give the camera his best shot .
2018;"plus his troubled performance as an undercover cop here is head and shoulders above some of the more early dramatic performances he excelled in (eg ""The Beach"")3."
2019;Matt's pretty boy looks translate very well when he wants to play a negative role, and his performance here won me as a new fan.
2020;itself was worth the price of admission.
2021;He has such hilarious one.
2022;liners and the best screentime.
2023;As usual, he walks through the role, and his presence here overshadows everyone, including the luminous DiCaprio in most scenes.6.
2024;The Story : Everyone pretty much knows that this tale is about everyone betraying everyone, but to see it played out and watching everyone reach their unique and very sudden deaths was a treat in itself!I must say, I am not usually a fan of violent movies, but the fact that this film made me embrace the genre readily was quite a revelation.
2025;Well I have to hand it to Scorcese .
2026;he has taken what was pretty much a basic cops and baddies tale and revolutionized it with his clever direction and some excellent dialogue.
2027;the film holds up very well on repeated viewing.
2028;This is an excellent film to watch again and again .
2029;"to sum this up, ""The Departed"" is easily Scorcese's best film because its one made for this generation, while respecting the film making techniques of the past."
2030;Its bold, brash and unnerving, and extracts the best performances from its' leads.
2031;special mention must be made of the male lead .
2032;age works its' wonders .
2033;and last year saw him in two of his greatest films of all time.
2034;it's a very nice movie, Di Caprio is a very good actor and it's one of it's best movies.
2035;Expectations were high for this movie, and it doesn't disappoint.
2036;it keeps you riveted thruout, although it was a twinge anti.
2037;His appeal in this movie adds alot, as does the other stars fine performances.
2038;Martin Scorcese's cinematography and the rapid pace of the storytelling don't leave any moments for attention lapses.
2039;The information comes at you pretty non.
2040;Involved as it is, it still was very well conceived I felt.
2041;Every twist and turn to the story made the entire thing all the more compelling to watch.
2042;The package of the 2 disc special edition is nice and elegant but i wonder if some costumer found in this product a booklet or something beside the two discs because there is anything else in the case.
2043;love the cast, all played great roles, for this twisted story of bad guy vs good guy.
2044;Without going into much detail, the extras .
2045;especially those about crime and culture etc are very interesting and add another dimension to the detail Scorsese insists upon.
2046;I love this movie, the cast is amazing!
2047;Damon and Wahlberg work so good off each other, and Dicaprio's performance is amazing.
2048;I can usually tell how a movie will end, but this one had me on the edge of my seat the entire time.
2049;But at last we have a real look at the evil world that surrounds us.
2050;Fast pace keeps the viewer interested, twists and turns keep the viewer riveted, and the ending will blow the viewer away!
2051;Highly recommended for those who can stand the sight of blood!
2052;Awsome movie bunch of great actors if you love action this movie has got it has crazy twist but great movie!
2053;moving, complex story where you really have to pay attention to follow what's going on.
2054;the back cover gives away enough of the plot to give you the basic idea up to about 3/4 of the way through.
2055;But there are nooks and crannies, twists and turns, along the way to keep it interesting.
2056;as a metro Boston resident, I enjoyed some very familiar locations, notably Boston's Chinatown, even if the scenes seem to suggest that a certain alley exists near the dogs at the entrance.
2057;It's closer to four, so that's what it gets from me.
2058;The Departed was my favorite film in 2006, and probably the best movie I've seen in the theater in several years.
2059;The plot and the setting were very compelling, but the best part was the incredible cast.
2060;I was wrong: Jack Nicholson is one of the best parts of this movie.
2061;Nicholson is superb as a Boston mafia boss, and he completely dominates most of the movie with his persona.
2062;While not quite as dominated a presence, DiCaprio is also excellent as an undercover cop trying to infiltrate the mob.
2063;Finally, I really enjoyed Walberg as an intense detective whose angry exterior betrays his disgust at being unable to lock up Nicholson and a deeper class resentment.
2064;the Departed explores several fascinating themes.
2065;Similarly, Damon works as a decorated cop, but he works diligently for criminal Nicholson.
2066;another great theme is that of change.
2067;I thought this was very interesting, and well fits Boston, a city that is rapidly changing from what it was for generations.
2068;For example, many parts of South Boston, where a lot of the movie takes place, have become gentrified and less Irish working class.
2069;Needless to say, it's a splendid movie.
2070;The best movie of 2006, no doubt about it.
2071;This movie had a Fantastic cast that worked well together.
2072;The plot centers around modern day mobsters with a window into the life of undercover agents.
2073;Pay attention because this one has some surprises.
2074;Avid movie buffs will like this movie.
2075;You cant always tell who the good guys are.
2076;"Martin Scorsese finally took home his first Academy Award for Best Director for ""The Departed""."
2077;With consummate skill he assembled bewilderingly complex and varied ingredients: performers, story, settings, photography .
2078;The story is a compelling narrative.
2079;The dialog is full of sharp, witty one.
2080;liners, but also with a realistic, gritty ring of truth.
2081;"Leonardo DiCaprio gives a sizzling performance as a Boston ""Southie"" who joins the police force at a tender age, but because of his family (his father was a local tough guy and his uncle a low level mobster)and intelligence(we're told he scored 1400 on his SAT ."
2082;(Among the many fine scenes are one where Damon gets to inform Nicholson that he is now leading the investigation to find .
2083;Jack's performance is a Nicholson special.
2084;"(The reason Costello is ""ungettable"" by the Massachusetts police force is one of dozens of intricate twists and sub."
2085;It's enjoyable to discuss such things, but it's quibbling.
2086;The Departed has so many well.
2087;drawn characters breathed to life by stellar actors in brilliant performances that it could easily populate two *good* films!Vera Farmiga was previously unknown to me, but she delivers in the only major female role as a police psychiatrist who graduated from Harvard, but takes the presumably lower.
2088;There are a half dozen scenes with more edge.
2089;DiCaprio's performance brings home the fear that the character must have constantly been feeling.
2090;"All the praise and hoopla will make ""The Departed"" and it's various investors a lot of money."
2091;This makes me wonder .
2092;There are Oscar worthy performances from an A. list cast.
2093;The Departed was a classic Scorsese film.
2094;It conatains undercover, violence, language, excellent lighting, and fantastic cinematography.
2095;Scorsese proves once again that he is director who deserves an oscar.
2096;He has never won and this could be the one.
2097;Best movie of all time!!!!!
2098;Strangely, the fast paced story, combined with an interesting combination of A. list actors, provides for a very suspenseful and entertaining film.
2099;I would recommend this to anybody who likes this type of movie.
2100;This is a complex film .
2101;It explores the Irish Mafia in Boston and the Irish in the Police.
2102;He goes from success to success in the Police supplying his mentor/godfather and with inside information.
2103;another great highlight is the very creative and inspiring sound track especially with Van Morisson singing the great Pink Floyd classic Comfortably Numb .
2104;"How is it that an American film director, who's wins a ""Best Director"" Oscar for a film that he Plagarized from a Hong Kong film get so much credit as being ""Great"" and a ""Master"" ????"
2105;I'm sure that when he won the Oscar, he wanted to make it sound like this film was an original piece of work.
2106;Simply awfulWas this the movie that Scorsese desearved the best director Oscar for?
2107;After 27 years of being nominated, he finally got the award he desearved.
2108;Scorsese is by far the one of the best directors of any generation.
2109;But this movie is still worth a watch.
2110;Everyone gives it their all.
2111;One of my favorite movies of all time!
2112;An all star cast does a great job with this intense drama.
2113;There are twists and turns all over the place.
2114;All actors were terrific and strong in their roles.
2115;worth watching numerous times to pick up on all the cleverness.
2116;Happy it wonfor best director.
2117;I enjoyed this movie immensely, watching it over and over.
2118;He is based on a true character of that time with a few small changes.
2119;excellent movie, lots of decisions to be made which leads us to a very complex conclusion.
2120;Superb acting from many of our leading men including Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jack Nicholson, Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg.
2121;Definitly worth your time, and worth owning.
2122;I just knew I like the stars in it.
2123;This is a must see movie.
2124;Scorcese does a fantastic job directing up until the end.
2125;Hang on for a wild ride!
2126;This is one of my favorite movie.
2127;It is a great story!
2128;I highly recommend this movie
2129;I saw this movie a couple of weeks ago and thought it was good, tense crime drama.
2130;"But I think I see another influence, namely, the true story of Whitey Bulger and the ""Winter Hill"" mob of Boston."
2131;"i think that ""the Departed"" does a pretty good job distilling the often uncinematic aspects of criminal life in south Boston into a drama that crackles with tension."
2132;There are a lot of twists and turns in the movie, and it keeps the viewer guessing to almost the very end.
2133;While Nicholson dominates the film with his mob boss portrayal, Matt Damon and Leonardo Dicaprio do a great job as well.
2134;I have four gripes with it:1.
2135;The original Godfather movies still hold up to today's crap, and even this is enjoyable, but PLEASE make some more unique films!!!
2136;the first 20 minutes are fantastic.
2137;Scorsese lays out the histories of Damon as Sullivan, being a good boy and rising up the police ranks while all the time beholden to Nicholson's Boston crime boss Costello.
2138;DiCaprio has a more troubled history [during which I was never convinced WHY he wanted to be a cop], but both of their stories are laid out in a very quick and energetic way.
2139;that are amusing, but that's when you still believe that this story is going to come to something.
2140;And it's kind of a worldview that you don't need two.
2141;Wow, they sure are hard, tough guys, Marty.
2142;secondly, when De Palma enters into a set.
2143;The sense I get with Scorsese is that he wants you to passively sit back and admire his skill.
2144;Yeah, yeah, Marty, you're the man, okay?
2145;subtle message that there will always be corruption in the highest offices of power.
2146;Well, obviously it's a statement, but is it an interesting statement?
2147;The performances here are all very good and it's certainly well made but.
2148;take a half hour off and I'd be fine.
2149;as far as the content of the movie, I really enjoyed it.
2150;The premise was interesting, the excecution easy to follow, and the acting pretty damn good.
2151;addict, and Nicholson did a pretty impressive Whitey Bulger impression.
2152;if you like Scorsese movies, or films about the mob, you should really see this movie.
2153;The second disk was very entertaining.
2154;"ray""The Departed"" (2006) is Scorsese's most recent released film and IMHO one of his best works."
2155;The film explores differences and similarities in each career.
2156;There is one basic trait that deeply affects both of them: a mounting life.
2157;stress due to that they are basically and emotionally the opposite of what their daily life is.
2158;i think the movie has many strong points.
2159;first: a very intelligent screenplay from Hong Kong born Siu Fai Mak and Felix Chong adapted by Oscar winner William Monahan.
2160;"second: Scorsese's direction at par with his most successful precedents ""Raging Bull"" (1980), ""Taxi Driver"" (1976) and ""NY, NY"" (1977)."
2161;"third play acting: Jack Nicholson once again fleshing a complex character
2162;This is quite a huge number of excellent performances for just one film!Fourth: film editing in charge of multiple Oscar winner Thelma Schoonmaker, with a long story of association with Scorsese.
2163;this movie is one of the best action films I've seen lastly!Reviewed by Max Yofre.
2164;the suspense was breath taking.
2165;The 5.1 track is also fantastic.
2166;This movie is also fantastic.
2167;Good performances all the way around and Jack N still hasn't diminished over time.
2168;I give it two thumbs up!
2169;The twists and turns keep you watching along with looking for the next star that made an appearance in this movie.
2170;This film is so freaking amazing, I have been watching it probably twice year since it came out.
2171;So I saw a deal and got a copy.
2172;It's been several years now, but at the time it blew my mind.
2173;That's a great twist for a mob movie.
2174;But that's just one detail.
2175;I think Jack does an amazing job.
2176;All the performances are a ten.
2177;Great symbolism, scenery (I love Boston), story, soundtrack.
2178;So the nature of the human to have both sides, the duality that is explored, makes it all the more interesting.
2179;The second disc has some great stuff.
2180;one of the best modern gangster films I can think of, the acting is great, the writing is phenomenal, the twists and turns can be hard to follow but in the end its one of Scorsese's finest.
2181;This tradition has found worthy heirs in Hong Kong directors, while Hollywood has happily descended into the moral clarity of Spielberg land where you can take a still shot and immediately tell who the good and who are the bad guys are.
2182;The antagonists Damon and DiCaprio fall in love with the same woman.
2183;It's the cheapest trick ever to establish a connection between the two.
2184;The original version works beautifully without such conventional soap opera techniques.
2185;needless to say, a much stronger message.
2186;It is a manifestation of a great plot however that it survives those mutilations and still functions.
2187;the acting in Departed is good throughout, with the exception perhaps of Nicholson who at this point in his career can only play himself.
2188;lets see, Martin Scorsese has really been on a role these past seven years.
2189;first, he scored with Gangs of New York.
2190;then he scored again with The Aviator, a bit softer then his other movies yet again, another great film.
2191;but this movie really takes the cake.
2192;definitnly his best film since Casino, Scorsese once again teams up with new right hand actor Leonardo DiCaprio to make this crackling good film based on the popular Hong Konh flick Internal Affairs but instead of Hong Kong, the action has been shifted to the strees of Boston.
2193;all these cover ups, double crosses, and broad assemble may seem a bit confussing but you'll easily get the picture once the film gets going.
2194;the performences are also a key drive to this film, DiCaprio, Damon, Nicbolson, and Wahlberg all give outstanding performences.
2195;i was a bit shocked that Nicholson didn't get nominated but Wahlberg is also a good choice.
2196;The Departed is an excellent cop thriller revolving around Boston crime lord Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) and his inside man, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), who is embedded within the police force.
2197;Sullivan gives the impression of heading up the Costello investigation, when in reality he's secretly feeding Frank enough information to keep his buddy one step ahead of the police.
2198;paced and very exciting throughout.
2199;The film also contains excellent supporting roles played by Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg, who deliver powerful (and at times hilarious) performances.
2200;The Departed never loses momentum, and it's full of surprising twists and turns right up until the final scene.
2201;The cast is excellent and everyone delivers outstanding performances.
2202;Still, it was great to see Damon play a slimy character for once, and watching Damon, DiCaprio and Nicholson interact onscreen was wonderful: They're all excellent actors, and every scene was fabulous.
2203;It is also quite possibly the best cop movie ever.
2204;I'm so glad that Martin Scorsese won an Oscar for it.
2205;This movie certainly lived up to all of it's fanfare.
2206;nicholson has a grip on all of the rackets in Boston.
2207;Costello always knows when any police action is coming at him.
2208;With these factors he is given employment by the Costello family.
2209;theCostello mob also believe that they have an infformant in their ranks.
2210;this tuns out to be a very good movie.
2211;This movie will keep you in your chair.
2212;Be sure to see this movie.
2213;Marty Scorsese's best film yet.
2214;Loaded with Hollywood's best actors, the movie bristles with suspense and violence.
2215;I picked up this film primarily because of the fact that one of my favorite actors (Jack Nicholson .
2216;The Departed is a film with Mind.
2217;blowing plot variations and shocking revelations which culminates in a violent and stunning end.
2218;what follows is a stellar performance by the entire cast, with a story that is as intense, as it is violent, profane and shocking.
2219;A very compelling, imaginative and true to life plot with an ending that will leave you in a stunned silence of contemplation.
2220;Eventually both the police and Frank realize they have a rat working for the other side, and it comes down to a game of cat and mouse to find and catch the culprit.
2221;martin Scorsese will love this film.
2222;It has all the elements that endear fans to him: raw, gritty action and violence.
2223;Fans will think the film is perfect and quite possibly the best they've seen all year.
2224;The acting is great .
2225;Matt Damon does an OK job as well.
2226;Mark Wahlberg turns in a performance that is both brutal and memorable.
2227;Hey, when one sees a gangster film one can expect violence, and this one delivers.
2228;I hold the The Godfather up as an example: powerful movie, what I consider the premier gangster movie, and very little (any???)
2229;overall a very good film and I would recommend it.
2230;I actually liked this better than """"Gangs of New York"""" and """"Aviator."""""""
2231;i will grant Excellent acting .
2232;May appreciate it with another viewing.
2233;And on the makeing of the film with out all the technical jargon.
2234;It is a great list of actors.
2235;The acting that is done in this movie is terrific!
2236;I enjoyed all the main actors, Baldwin and Wahlberg did an excellent job as cops that were just horrible to everyone in the movie and Di Caprio did excellent as playing a man who kept getting beat down.
2237;this is a movie that is going to keep you entertained.
2238;I really enjoyed this film with directing that reminded me of Scorcece's Goodfellas.
2239;DiCaprio is excellent in probably the best performance I have seen from him as a cop who agrees to become a mole into the mob.
2240;great performances up and down especially by Martin Sheen, Mark Wohlberg and Alec Baldwin.
2241;Nicholson's henchmen are also highly entertaining (shades of Joe Pesce in Goodfellas).
2242;I heard that this movie is a remake of a Chinese film and would like to see the original to see if it is as good.
2243;best performance i've seen all year.
2244;this is one of the better movies i have seen in a good while.
2245;if you like Leo, Matt, or Jack, you will definitely enjoy this movie from start to finish.
2246;I like a good action movie from time to time.
2247;This movie was enjoyable to watch and would recommend it.
2248;In this movie everyone but Mark Wahlberg is shot in the face, before this an intricate game of cat and mouse takes place where two people are half.
2249;mouse creatures on the hunt and hunted by each other.
2250;An excellent flick to bring a date to.
2251;I give it an A.
2252;We like both DiCaprio and Damon and they really keep you going in this movie.
2253;one a mole with the crooks and the other a mole with the cops!
2254;i like the actors and they pretty much had roles that we are accustomed to seeing them play.
2255;Both enroll in the police academy, but while Costigan wants to be a state trooper, Sullivan is Costello's right.
2256;hand man, and just wants to be help out the man who helped him while growing up.
2257;He succeeds, and soon is passing information to the police, but Sullivan knows that there is a leak, and soon both sides are looking for the rat.
2258;The Departed is a great movie, and will definitely be in the running for best picture come Oscar time.
2259;The cast is great all around, with everyone bringing their best performances to the table.
2260;DiCaprio and Damon are the core of the movie, and they prove up to the challenge.
2261;Nicholson is excellent as always, especially when he is allowed to just be Jack.
2262;The story is great, and is an example of how a remake does not need to be bad.
2263;Scorsese makes is all flow smoothly, and the movie does not feel as long as it is.
2264;This is easily one of the best movies of the year, I highly recommend seeing it.
2265;Incredible characters, amazing plot, intense drama, Scorsese at his absolute best.
2266;If you are looking for a good movie keep looking!
2267;"Great film
2268;Good movie to watch with your buddies.
2269;its good because the original Chinese film its copied from, Infernal Affairs (2004) was a superior plot.
2270;the film is a tightly wound tale of intrigue about moles inside the Boston department.
2271;there's a certain amount of advanced technology to sleuth the mystery the audience already knows the answer to.
2272;But this is a great script.
2273;jack Nicholson's Costello is over the top, damaging a pretty good film substantially.
2274;but this is the best Scorcese film in years, better than Gangs of New York or the Aviator, both of which were directed by Scorcese and both of which featured Leonardo De Caprio.
2275;Dalton is a newcomer and is quite good.
2276;the film, due to its extraordinary plot and a series of film surprises, is quite good, despite everything.
2277;But the acting was good and it was a fun movie to watch.
2278;Very gory and the ending is something shocking, but I liked it overall
2279;winning drama of a few years ago, which like """"The Departed"""" is set among Irish cops and mobsters in South Boston."""
2280;In William Monahan's brilliant screenplay (based on the Hong Kong.
2281;From there the story becomes a wildly compelling rollercoaster ride, filled with multiple double.
2282;"What keeps it from being unbearably depressing is the brilliant if highly profane dialogue
2283;There are welcome, if shocking, flashes of humor, thanks largely to Nicholson, the greatest living expert in gleeful screen sadism.
2284;(To see Nicholson's Costello delicately remove the gold wedding ring from a severed hand is to learn a whole new definition of the word """"aplomb."""")"""
2285;But do expect to leave the theater exhilarated at having seen the most satisfying movie in years by one of the world's greatest filmmakers.
2286;I have loved Scoraese's films.
2287;And perhaps most of all grounded in one unlikely coincidence after another.
2288;"The grand american director, Martin Scorsese, woke up again with a fantasic ""Mob Opera"" called The Departed."
2289;It's a position he uses to help Costello.
2290;the script is full with sharp dialogue, with many of it reserved for the abusive mouth of Dignam (Mark Wahlberg in yet another brilliant performance).
2291;Everyone gets good lines in William Monahan's screenplay, but the best, understandably, goes to Nicholson himself.
2292;"damon and DiCaprio are nicely contrasted
2293;As for Nicholson, his villainy presence is a welcome treat, a mix of pure evil and wicked sense of humor.
2294;as for Scorsese, it is a return to his fluent, muscle.
2295;This is a monumental work, a crime thriller that leaves behind its remake status by coming off as fresh and original.
2296;This is a brilliant story retold with the touch of a master.
2297;Leo DeCaprio was great in this movie playing an undercover plant in organized crime group.
2298;When the criminals and police both realize that they have a mole in their organizations, a complicated game of cat and mouse ensues.
2299;Great dialogue and characters who sit constantly on the emotional edge set this film apart.
2300;Nicholson abandons his shtick and does some real acting here as an admittedly entertaining sociopathic sleazebucket.
2301;But most of the time is spent on unexpected twists and turns .
2302;It keeps the audience guessing, while powerful performances keep us involved.
2303;Best movie of 06 and deserves oscar for best picture and actors.
2304;the Acting&overall pacing was Good in this film.
2305;very watchable film&has some interesting moments.
2306;Most people (especially critics) regard it as a masterpiece, but I personally do not think so.
2307;It has a great cast, great acting, and a solid story, but I have some issues with it.
2308;He gets the job of going undercover as one of Costello's men and infiltrate his operation.
2309;as I said the film has an excellent cast.
2310;Each of them does a great job acting wise.
2311;This movie has a huge cast and there are only two characters I cared about are DiCaprio and Martin Sheen's characters.
2312;I liked Cardigan because it is easy to sympathize with him.
2313;The only person in the film who really trusted him was Captain Queenan (Martin Sheen), which is why I liked him as well.
2314;I am not offended by swearing, but there is so much of it here that I found it hard to take the film seriously in places.
2315;Scorsese likes to put a great deal of cussing in his films and I do not know why.
2316;overall, the Departed is a decent film with a great cast, great acting, and a good story.
2317;I just have my own issues with it.
2318;It's an awesome movie on all fronts.
2319;I think Martin Scorsese has waited a long time to be honored for his work, and winning the Oscar for the Departed was a fittting tribute.
2320;This crime drama pits the good guys and the bad guys in each others' camps and keeps you wondering right up to the end.
2321;face looks usually lend him to be the good guy, which he does quite well.
2322;A resounding """"Well done"""" to all of the cast and to Mr. Scorsese."""
2323;Great acting all around and the plot is pretty good and keeps your interest.
2324;I live in Boston, and this movie does a great job capturing what it's like living here and facing decisions of loyalty between the police and the mob.
2325;I can watch this movie over and over again, and still love it!
2326;It has some real strong language and killing scenes.
2327;but everything is so well done, it fit like a glove!
2328;One of the best movies made, but then again.
2329;"Then you expect Jack Nicholson to have to save the film
2330;One officer, Matt Damon's character has a perfect record and becomes leadership, while the other, Leo's character, has a family history that, due to the family's deviousness, makes him perfect for undercover work.
2331;Well, I hope so because it certainly was.
2332;just to reinforce my liking the film, I will state to the contrary that all of the actors did a marvelous job, especially Wahlberg and DiCaprio.
2333;well, hopefully now you have a brief understanding of this film, one of Scorsese's tops, and additionally may you yourself see the film, and find equal pleasure.
2334;(Because now I have to see Infernal Affairs, the film this film is based on!)
2335;I have read enough movie reviews to know what kind of movie will be well.
2336;My mother and her male friend, on the other hand, saw it months earlier and they didn't seem to think it was all that, and after all the great things that I had heard and read about it, I wondered why, but now I think I have a pretty good idea.
2337;Even Jack Nicholson comes through with a praiseworthy presentation with his character, even though I always thought that 'The Shining' was his landmark role.
2338;There's been a lot of that going on in the past few years or so.
2339;It has a talented all.
2340;Scorsese is back in top form folks!
2341;I would rank The Departed as his second best film, right behind the obvious (Goodfellas of course).
2342;All the actors put on an acting masterpiece, especially Marty's go to boy, Leonardo DiCaprio (very mature and his personal best piece of acting) and the mad man known as Jack Nicholson.
2343;Give the man another Oscar nomination.
2344;Matt Damon, Martin Sheen, Mark Wahlberg, Ray Winstone, and Alec Baldwin are all outstanding as well.
2345;Realism is what I expect from a well made movie.
2346;And this my friends, is an expertly made film.
2347;I saw this movie in theathers and it was definately the best movie I have seen lately.
2348;It is definately a great movie, because for one the men will love the action of the movie, and us girls love the hot guys in it!
2349;If the script writers were gonna remake a Japanese movie they might as well do a good job.
2350;The actors are great"
2351;And this movie proves why.
2352;Dicaprio is great in the film and loved the accent that he put on.
2353;This movie had the potential to be really, really good.
2354;"It felt like they kind of just went, ""well."
2355;I am a woman and I'm pretty sure that it's in my genetic code to love DiCaprio.
2356;Now that that's out of my system, I'm ready to give this remarkable piece of cinema a proper analysis.
2357;driven of Scorsese's films to date, which is probably why it received as much Oscar love as it did back in 2006 when it picked up a well.
2358;It also saw Scorsese his first.
2359;Don't get me wrong, it's an incredibly fun and often.
2360;hysterical film that questions human morality and our almost.
2361;It dangles the life of a mobster in front of you like yarn before a cat and dares you not to pounce on it.
2362;intense and super entertaining battle between good and evil, complete with all the man.
2363;diCaprio gives such an intense and energized performance in this film that, right from the get.
2364;go, pretty much puts Gang's Amsterdam on the bench.
2365;This is one of those performances that truly proves that DiCaprio has much more to him than an unbelievable pretty face, but incredible talent.
2366;Throughout the film you're so with him that when the third act finally rolls around, you're so relieved.
2367;that is until Scorsese takes that relief and slugs you square in the gut with it.
2368;It fully drives home just how crooked and complex the criminal world truly is and how it's always one step ahead.
2369;I love Leo, and this film is packed tight with fabulous well known actors we've all enjoyed over the years.
2370;Great movie with an unexpected twist at the end.
2371;All the main leads are great and the twists and turns , music , chases , one liners made me give this 5stars without hesitation .
2372;This is a fantastic film.
2373;Scorcese's films are often too long, but they are always well made and he gets some fine performances out of Leo Di Caprio, Matt Damon and Jack Nicholson.
2374;Mark Wahlberg also gets a fantastic small supporting roll.
2375;Whether the end is ideal, I am not sure, but the ride up to it is absolutely fantastic.
2376;I am not a big fan of Leonardo Di Caprio, he was miscast in Gangs Of New York, but he has shown a mature performance in Blood Diamond, and The Departed is probably his best role to date.
2377;Matt Damon is also excellent as the bad good guy.
2378;with the likes of Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin, also in this movie, there is a top cast to add to the fine story, with twists and turns based on events involving a Boston Police Department and Jack Nicholson's crime lord and his gang.
2379;Definitely, the film of the year, and the best thing I have seen since Crash and Brokeback Mountain, which won and finished runner.
2380;up for Oscar glory last year.
2381;It was truly funny and if Scorsese meant for this to be serious then he needs to check into a mental hospital or double his prescriptions.
2382;I laughed outloud at the end.
2383;2 and a bit hours of cinematic pleasure.
2384;raging Bull, Casino, Good Fellas, Kings of Comedy .
2385;I loved the movie, so the 2nd disc with all the featurettes was a must for me.
2386;This is an excellent example of how just because you have big names involved in the movie, it doesn't automatically make the movie good.
2387;It's such a great action thriller!
2388;this movie keeps you on the edge of your seat
2389;"Bought it because of the ""big name"" actors in it and the awards it received."
2390;First, Scorsese is a genius.
2391;there is so much to it.
2392;the story line is intriguing and gets better each time you view it.
2393;The acting is excellent, leonardo dicaprio and jack nicholson both portray their characters with personality and reputibility.
2394;if you enjoy mob movies, and you enjoy mystery, drama, even dark comedy, then this movie is for you!
2395;Great movie and even better on Blu.
2396;Awesome movie, great cast of characters.
2397;Martin Scorsese once again delivers which will always be one of the all time greats!
2398;Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson and Mark Wahlberg were great.
2399;Worth the price of pay.
2400;Took me a minute to understand what was going on but this is a great movie!
2401;Jack Nicholson is outstanding as usual!
2402;Leonardo DiCaprio and the other guy (good will hunting) are awesome too!
2403;I saw the movie twice in the theater, so I'm familiar with the scenes.
2404;"With great performances from DiCaprio, Damon, Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, and Mark Wahlberg in what ended up being an Oscar nominated performance
2405;Absolutely spectacular from beginning to end, The Departed is a modern day masterpiece.
2406;It is awesome in all respects.
2407;Director Martin Scorsese has made a good living reminding us that the human body is a fragile thing.
2408;One moment you're here, the next you're a heap of flesh lying in a widening crimson pool.
2409;scorsese's Academy Award winning film, The Departed, is his latest reminder of these facts.
2410;Simple goodness is an unattainable ideal, unrealistic even.
2411;guessing, suspense, blackmail, intrigue and brutality.
2412;As with many of this actor's roles, there is a deliciously seductive facet to his shady characters .
2413;the toothy smile, the soft.
2414;spoken casual manner, the serpent holding forth the irresistible apple.
2415;character portrayals led by the ensemble of Damon, Whalberg, Baldwin and Sheen, reel with tremendous power and conviction along with some nuance, but are more or less standard fare, especially in a Scorsese film.
2416;DiCaprio's role as Billy Costigan, in part due to William Monahan's excellent Oscar.
2417;winning script that allows this character a broader unveiling, delves deep into the subtleties, tensions and grinding internal conflicts of a real three.
2418;He needs a mentor, a loyal friend, someone to help him come to terms with his shady Boston """"southy"""" family background, his personal longings, and the soul."""
2419;This relationship works for Billy to a point, but mostly it works for us as we witness more of Costigan's unfolding, multifaceted character.
2420;diCaprio's brilliant portrayal captures it all, and with an absolute honesty that is so rare these days.
2421;Where Nicholson's fine performance unveils two lines converging on a point, DiCaprio's drips with fullness of perspective .
2422;worthy to be sure, but overlooked in 2006 by the Academy.
2423;scorsese's mastery of this type of material is legendary.
2424;A bright, humorous and ironic shot placed in juxtaposition to the overpowering force of the film would have made for a nice touch of relief.
2425;the Departed will go down in cinematic history as a powerful and important film.
2426;DiCaprio's presence as an actor will continue to rise to new heights.
2427;Great movie that I've been wanting to watch for a long time.
2428;Martin Scorsese pulls off yet another winner of a film and finally wins his long overdue and very much deserved oscar.
2429;Even though it may not be his best film, it sure was the best film of 2006.
2430;The Daparted contains great performances all around, plus a story line taht keeps you on the edge of your seat.
2431;Plus unexpected twists and turns that will sure to surprise you.
2432;If you like crime movies, Goodfellas, Godfather, etc. you will enjoy this one.
2433;Really unexpected ending that put the movie on my top 5 list.
2434;these three give good performances, but it's Mark Walhberg who is the wekest one in the cast.
2435;But they all give a seemingly good portrayal of South Boston underworld.
2436;This is a tense thriller which plays well off of the crossed loyalties, who is good and who is bad.
2437;In the end a not so suprising ending kind of ruined it, but it is still a good ride.
2438;I am not a fan of Scorcese, but maybe we owe it all to Jack Nicholson and Vera Farmiga, also Matt Damon and diCaprio, but this movie is engrossing and keeps you on edge, it is worth seeing over several time
2439;Great movie, entertaining all the way through.
2440;Several great actors makes this a favorite.
2441;A classic for new generations and highly recommened.
2442;I personally love not only movies, but the design of their packaging and this case is sweet!
2443;A true roller coaster ride from beginning to end.
2444;Though at times hilarious, this is not one of those films.
2445;Costigan's family is peopled with criminals, and he himself has a fierce temper.
2446;Thus, Costigan must gain the trust of Jack Nicholson's insane, unforgiving, and amusing Frank Costello, an Irish mafia kingpin.
2447;"this tale has countless ""gasp"" moments as key information is revealed to us or to unwitting characters for the first time."
2448;Scorsese lets us thoroughly invest in the characters, feeling their pain and fear.
2449;acting is outstanding all around.
2450;DiCaprio is extremely sympathetic as Costigan.
2451;Damon is also excellent as Sullivan, a subtly drawn but disturbing character whose duplicity knows no ends.
2452;Nicholson is batty, merciless, but almost likable as Costello.
2453;Martin Sheen is likable as Queenan, and Ray Winstone is suitably dead eyed as the violent Mr. French.
2454;A special note must be given to Alec Baldwin.
2455;His police officer Ellerby is witty and perhaps on crack.
2456;Vera Farmiga also plays an complex character.
2457;Her relationship with both Sullivan and Costigan further compares and contrasts the two men.
2458;Sullivan has money, and is clean cut and insensitive.
2459;Costigan is a drug addicted mess, but he displays genuine affection for and interest in Madolyn.
2460;She is a smart woman making foolish choices.
2461;this movie is a series of wonderful quotes and moments.
2462;Various themes are threaded throughout this tense story.
2463;The parallels drawn between Costigan and Sullivan are fascinating.
2464;Sweeping camera shots and a variety of memorable music set the mood.
2465;The Departed This film is about survival, which makes for an intense, entertaining, and powerful experience.
2466;Will somebody please tell me what all the fuss is about?Yes, Marty was due for a ton of things he should have won for in the past.
2467;Yes, DiCaprio gives a damn fine performance here.
2468;this is a film that is nicely done.
2469;The Departed is a B, maybe a B+ movie at best.
2470;"stars very often but ""The Departed"" is deserving of the acclaim."
2471;This has to be Nicholson's best performance in a good while.
2472;i don't want to give anything away but I thought the ending was the best part.
2473;It's nice to see a movie that doesn't go for the idiot.
2474;This is an intense film, from beginning to end.
2475;this movie is one of scorcese's greatest motion pictures but it is not a picture i would like to frame.
2476;i highly recommend this movie if u like peanut butter.
2477;Shame cos I love this movie :(
2478;handed message, watch for the rodent in the final scene.
2479;The film is pure genius, well.
2480;A new release is imminent, but in the meantime this one is still a fine investment!
2481;now like I said it can get very confusing, because there is a lot of names and double crossing, but once you figure it out, you will love this film, it has everything you'd want in a mob/scorsese film, excellent and well thought out plot, terrific performances (Leonardo Dicaprio has really become a great actor), and Matt Damon, Mark Whalberg, Jack Nicholson, and Martin Sheen all deliver performances you would expect from them.
2482;so in one word, this is a fantastic modern mob movie, I usually go for the classics myself, but you can set aside a few more modern movies for me, and this is at the top!
2483;rated and typically Italian: everything is the mob mix of gratuitous violence, sex and religious chicanery.
2484;so we have here in this Oscar winner the latest imaginative turn in Hollywood gangster films: acknowledging that everyone has seen all the Italian mob stories they can stomach, make a movie with an Irish mob!
2485;see, more Italian mob brio .
2486;but at least Nicholson was worth a look, although i'm still trying to figure out just what Jack (an Irish gangster here) was doing in this film.
2487;"don't read much into Access Hollywood's Scott Mantz stating this is ""Martin Scorsese's best film since Goodfellas""."
2488;It's a Martin Scorcese film and has some great actors in it, including Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Walberg, Matt Damon and Martin Sheen.
2489;I have a lot of respect for all of them and greatly admire their collective body of work.
2490;I'm a man of the world and I've been around.
2491;I know racism and homophobia are out there, alive and well and I was thinking, well, maybe that's how people used to talk in Boston 'some years ago'.
2492;Maybe that's how they still talk now (very interesting accents, by the way).
2493;It could possibly go on to win a truckload of awards simply by virtue of its director and the lead actors, who did seem to be giving very good performances, but this one was not for me.
2494;made crime thriller that conveys the perils of going undercover with a great soundtrack and more than a few suprises.
2495;Great casting and actors, but personally I expected too much out of it because of Oscar award, I would not watch it over and over like Godfather masterpiece.
2496;It's an action packed movie with a solid plot.
2497;Leonardo did his thing very well and nailed it shut.
2498;Best movie of all time!
2499;Obviously, everyone knows this is a great movie.
2500;The Scorcese on Scorcese segment was outstanding.
2501;It was very interesting to hear what his thought processes were while making some of his (many) legendary movies.
2502;Nevertheless, on balance, the bonus disc is great, and a worthy companion to what I feel is the best movie of 2006.
2503;This is really a great movie.
2504;I have never been a Leonardo C. fan but he does a really good job.
2505;Anyway the movie is really fantastic.
2506;This film chews you up and leaves you reeling.
2507;Action packed movie and we enjoyed watching it.
2508;Dicaprio is a very talented actor and does a good job in this movie.
2509;All items intact and properly packaged.
2510;This is one of the best movies ever .
2511;Walberg and Decaprio and Sheen and Nicolson give outstanding perfermances throughout the entire film.
2512;scary but true I'll bet you this goes on every day!
2513;Today we are going to study the great Martin Scorsese and in particular his great masterpiece, The Departed, as a way by which to exemplify the basic tenets of filmmaking in American Cinema.
2514;This is very important for at least a couple of reasons.
2515;Secondly, of course, we know that gore sells, so it's really kind of a win.
2516;In Mr. Scorsese's film we see it is the Boston Police Department that is corrupted by a mole.
2517;and if THAT isn't enough, we see that the police treat each other in verbally abusive ways and regularly brutalize one another.
2518;(It's okay to have one or at the most two good cops, though.
2519;Note how Mr. Scorsese handles this theme in his film, showing a very beautiful frame of a beautiful city hall after all the main characters graphically get their heads blown to smithereens.
2520;The critics love this stuff.
2521;to show baby boomers that you're hip.
2522;You might even win an award!
2523;This is a movie you need to attention to, or maybe watch twice, but kits worth it and I enjoy watching it.
2524;I have enjoyed this movie every time I've seen it.
2525;The Departed is an adaptation of this Hong Kong film.
2526;DiCaprio, though, is very, very good.
2527;In one particularly good scene, in which he is questioned by the only female character (a rather undefined police psychologist) as to his vulnerability, DiCaprio works wonders without many words.
2528;levels (the watching of the watched, the 'criticism' of characters by each other) is more intriguing because of DiCaprio's performance.
2529;That being said, Damon's last line is brilliantly acted.
2530;And yet it delivers his performance from mediocrity and justifies his being on the same screen as Nicholson and DiCaprio.
2531;at least for that one moment.
2532;He observed for the brightest and most vulnerable children and enticed them into the organization.
2533;The fact that the two FBI protagonists are both also Irish, adds brilliance to the tension.
2534;Jack Nichelson was in top form.
2535;I enjoyed their performances in 'The Departed' .
2536;They performed well in this talented ensemble grouping with Martin Sheen, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, Alec Baldwin and others.
2537;I found their character portrayals believable, and the story.
2538;line's similarity to the real life Whitey Bulger case , in Boston, is truly interesting.
2539;i know I'll watch this movie again, and again.
2540;A top flight movie with great performances, direction, and script.
2541;A superior cast with fine direction from Martin Scorcese.
2542;Never one to disappoint, Scorsese expands the canvas that this movie was based on, breathing life to the characters, delving deeper into human emotions of not only the two leads, but those around them.
2543;and he has painted his masterpiece.
2544;I can safely say, this movie elevates movie making to the next level, surpassing some of Scorsese's earlier classics, The Goodfellas and Casino.
2545;the story is brilliant in it's simplicity.
2546;A cat and mouse game begins, to uncover who the mole is.
2547;The difference between this movie and the many out there, is that both groups consist of intelligent people constantly out.
2548;Sullivan thrives in the new environment.
2549;He resents the kind of person he has become, to see the things that he has seen, to do the things that he does.
2550;This, to me is the epitome of great film making, movies that not only entertains, but challenges you to think.
2551;I have stated time and time again, he is one of the brilliant actors of our time.
2552;He keeps it at bay and makes calculated risks.
2553;Costello has the attitude that provokes fear and Jack Nicholson easily manages to do just that.
2554;Supporting these fine actors are excellent performances from Martin Sheen, Mark Walhberg, Alex Baldwin and Vera Farmiga.
2555;Mark Walhberg especially is in fine form.
2556;"Not since ""Boogie Nights"", have I seen such a splendid performance from him."
2557;another thing that impresses me about the movie is the way the story unfolds and the cinematography.
2558;In true Scorsesean style, the script is peppered with trademark scenes that stick in your mind.
2559;The camera shots were marvelous and sets the tone for the movie.
2560;And there are humorous moments in the movie which actually works in favour to some of the scenes.
2561;I have watched this movie 4 times and like an onion, there are layers that upon peeling, you find new appreciation for.
2562;Another noteworthy aspect of The Departed is the music selection, handpicked by Scorsese himself.
2563;It blends perfectly with the movie and definitely adds to the cool factor, if anything else.
2564;this movie has already been nominated for a slew of awards and who knows, Marty might finally win the Oscar that has so far eluded him all these years.
2565;This movie might not be for everyone, but I can assure you, if you're looking for an intelligent movie that not only entertains but leaves you thinking, a movie with unrivalled performances from it's star.
2566;Leave it to Scorsese to take an already excellent movie and lift it up to dizzying heights in what I feel is a true representation of a modern day crime classic, The Departed.
2567;Definitely a step forward in America cinema, highly recommended!
2568;"also, although I loved the music (lots of Stones and that great ""Well Well Well"" from Lennon's Primal Scream album, the Pink Floyd cover shmaltz (i. e. DiCaprio's love making scene) was pretty over the top."
2569;and I want to see it again.
2570;intriguing charactersexploring their own vulnerability and trying to see clearythe differences between right and wrong.
2571;Jack Nicholson,Matt Damon, and Leonardo DiCaprio turn in the greatest trioof male drama acting I've ever seen in a film.
2572;I saw this Movie and I give it 5 stars.
2573;Colin is using his power and influence to protect his gangster father.
2574;sure it's a bloodthirsty gangster film with more than a few credibility issues .
2575;but this is Scorsese in top gear.
2576;scorsese draws superb performances out of the big.
2577;did I mention Alec Baldwin as the wonderfully oily Chief of Police?Truly exciting film.
2578;making from this master film.
2579;I loved this movie when it came out and found myself watching it whenever I came across it flipping channels.
2580;I watch it every few months while I'm ironing.
2581;i could sing praises for every actor in this extraordinary film, but I just don't have that kind of time.
2582;"I think The Departed"" is Scorsese's best film since ""Goodfellas"" and maybe his best movie ever."
2583;"star cast is superb
2584;In one scene, he holds the disembodied hand of a man he has just killed and removes the wedding ring from it.
2585;Despite its length, The Departed moves along at a brisk pace.
2586;the cinematography reveals a gritty, working.
2587;class side to Boston that is reminiscent of Damon's """"Good Will Hunting."""
2588;The closing scene filmed out of Damon's Beacon Hill apartment, with the Massachusetts Statehouse in the background and a rat on the window sill, is priceless.
2589;The Departed won Best Picture at the 2006 Academy Awards.
2590;This is a great movie with a great cast.
2591;If you enjoyed this movie chock full of stars the first time, you'll love watching it again and again and again!
2592;This is one of his best films.
2593;The fact that it is his highest grossing film is equally deserving for him.
2594;just the way it was shot, edited, scored (with some good pop tunes, especially from the Dropkick Murphy's) and the brilliant performances from Nicholson (Has he ever given a bad one?
2595;leonardo Dicaprio has easily turned into one of my favorite actors.
2596;It really helps add to the movie, and I have come to appreciate it a lot more.
2597;i love the intensity in which both of the two main undercovers played their respective character.
2598;Although a remake this is a great movie.
2599;The plot is full of twists and keeps you captivated during the whole movie and the casting and directing are superb.
2600;all in all a great movie that you will enjoy
2601;Awesome is all I can say.
2602;This movie keeps you plastered to your seat.
2603;The ending is absolutely unexpected.
2604;The movie is full of stars and each one performs to their maximum ability.
2605;Good twist to the story line.
2606;This was the best movie I saw in the theaters last year, hands down.
2607;The acting was spot on.
2608;This movie is full of enough twists, turns, ups, and downs to keep you guessing and on the edge of your seat, but the great thing is that the twists and turns are not forced .
2609;they flow smooth as silk this time around with Martin Scorsese confidently at the helm.
2610;The Departed is a great movie, great performances by Damon, DiCarpio and Nicholson.
2611;Scorcese probably won't win the Oscar for this movie but he's long overdue and this is the best movie he has made since casino and Goodfellas back in the 90's.
2612;I know its a remake of Internal Affairs but Scorese adds his his special twist to it to make it his own movie and all the performances are great and I highly suggest you watch it with an open mind, no matter what some of the reviews say about it, Great movie!!!
2613;It's up to Billy to win Costello's trust and help his colleagues (Mark Wahlberg and Martin Sheen) bring Costello down.
2614;There is an unexpected twist when officer Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) gains everyone's trust in the department.
2615;The Departed while keep you glued to your TV as you deal with all the of twists, and turns.
2616;Martin Scorsese makes a great and very entertaining movie that reminds us why we like to go to the movies in the first place.
2617;The cast is amazing and I believe this is going to win BEST PICTURE, BEST DIRECTOR and/or Best Supporting Actor (Mark Wahlberg) at the Academy Awards this year.
2618;This fantastic movie has inspired me to write my first Amazon review, after many years of lurking.
2619;The acting was top notch.
2620;8/10, very funnyLeading Lady .
2621;9/10, great story, some parts might be hard to follow on first viewingSetting .
2622;9/10, awesome music, especially Shipping up to BostonOverall .
2623;9/10, incredible movie, only a handful of movies ever are better than this.
2624;Godfather, Good Will Hunting and only a few others are better than this.
2625;This is one of those movies that you have to watch two or three times to make sense of all the intense action.
2626;"It is riveting and you can't take your eyes off the screen!I have been waiting for Leo Di Caprio to do a truly ""manly"" and tough role in a believable way, and this is the role."
2627;He is convincingly tough and does an incredible job in this movie.
2628;"matt Damon is excellent, although as one of my favorite actors I hated to ""love to hate"" him in this morally degenerate role."
2629;This is a fantastic movie.
2630;Jack Nicholson was perfect for this role and brought out the worst/best of this character.
2631;All the actors were great.
2632;As a previous reviewer stated, it is wonderful for those who enjoy drama, suspense, gangster flicks and just a really good movie to keep you totally involved in what's happening on the screen.
2633;I admit, I had to see The Departed twice to truly get it, even though I lived in Boston for thirty years and know quite well the story on whom the movie is based.
2634;Both give very authentic Boston performances, and you'd have to be from Boston or have really spent serious time there to really appreciate that.
2635;Once I knew the storyline I was free to watch the movie again and really get into the nuances of each actor's performance.
2636;martin Sheen makes it look so easy it's really quite embarrassing for him.
2637;He's become what we've seen so little of in Hollywood these days: a real actor.
2638;I would recommend this movie.
2639;Jacks performance is great but of course one always wants more, after all he sets a high bar.
2640;"Well, I'll tell you: It's for his latest film, ""The Departed""!"
2641;"He did once make some really great films, like ""Mean Streets"", ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"", ""Taxi Driver"", ""The Color of Money"", and ""Goodfellas""."
2642;"His remake of ""Cape Fear"" was good, but nowhere near as great as he used to be."
2643;He definetly deserved the Best Director award at the Academy Awards for this.
2644;For all of you people who praise Scorcese like he's God, well, I have to say you're right on this one.
2645;This is an extremely deep and profound and intense fast paced masterpiece of modern cinema that will leave you utterly breathless in practically every scene.
2646;And, it is rich with irony!
2647;Brilliant storytelling at its best!
2648;scorcese is on fire here, making quick cuts left and right, entering scenes through a circle point of view, cutting back and forth between scenes and characters, past and present, and using an extremely terrific soundtrack to boost the film along like a freight train to H*ll.
2649;This kicks people like Tarantino back into Kindergarden!!
2650;This is possibly the best crime thriller genre film that I've seen in years.
2651;everybody in the film is perfect for their roles, and their performances all shine through.
2652;This movie is amazing and even better the second time around.
2653;Great action and possibility of a sequel.
2654;it is an oldie but a good one.
2655;Great story, amazing acting and top class cast.
2656;Jack Nicholson, DiCaprio and Matt Damon are at their best.
2657;Well filmed and generally acted well, this film is nonetheless over.
2658;The plot is excessively complex with realism sacrificed in the interest of making the stories of the 2 informants parallel.
2659;This allows a lot of well done cross.
2660;Great plot, cast, dialogue and acting.
2661;It had me on the edge of my seat for most of the flick.
2662;"Well, I'll tell you: It's for his latest film, ""The Departed""!"
2663;"He did once make some really great films, like ""Mean Streets"", ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"", ""Taxi Driver"", ""The Color of Money"", ""Raging Bull"", ""The Last Waltz"", and ""Goodfellas""."

2674;"I decided to see what made ""The Departed"" such a big hit at the last Oscars and I must admit that it is an impressive movie."
2675;I was engrossed in it right from the start.
2676;"There are some classics out there
2677;like """"Goodfellas"""", """"The Departed"""" is a brilliantly filmed glimpse of the seediest side of life in America."""
2678;It is clear and always has been that he is a talented director.
2679;"The scenes in this movie are strong and memorable
2680;the acting in """"The Departed"""" is very good to terrific."""
2681;For my money, Leonardo DiCaprio gets the nod for best leading preformance but the strength of the movie is in the supporting cast.
2682;I acknowledge Scorsese's belated Oscar for Best Director because, as I mentioned, his scenes are so strong and compelling.
2683;Wow, let me tell you how disappointed I was in this Academy Award honored film.
2684;And does that one love interest, Vera Farmiga, give you any skinny shivers at all?
2685;This movie is instantly one of my top 10 and the best movie of the year.

2733;I'm often a bit behind the curve.
2734;suffice it to say, I can't exactly explain my fascination with Scorsese's movies other than to say that they capture human depravity in a unique and striking way.
2735;But, regardless, this is cinema genius at work rivaling Shakespeare's greatest tragedies in starkness, and complexity.
2736;with all that said, Departed is yet another great movie.

2750;It has a little of everything and keeps you on edge.
2751;With the exception of 1 scene I think this movie is appropriate for ages 14 and up.
2752;Without question, Scosese is one of the greatest filmmakers of all time.
2753;His pention for telling top notch criminal parables is practically unrivaled.
2754;rounded perspective on the subject, I can still proudly say that this is my favorite mob movie, and possibly my favorite Scorsese film.
2755;This is definitely one of the best films I have ever seen, period.
2756;I always knew it was excellent, but I never really took the time to reflect on just how great it really is.
2757;He is a master at his craft.
2758;He has to have ties to the mafia.
2759;He crafts such perfect gangster movies that it is hard not to think he has personal experience.
2760;I guess some guys are just that good telling stories.
2761;it's pretty obvious why Scorsese has Leonardo DiCaprio in a lot of his pictures these days.
2762;Jack Nicholson is pure genious, as always.
2763;His mannerisms are unbelievable, and he delivers lines with a beauty that we don't see very often on screen.
2764;His character made me crack a smile almost everytime he spoke, or started a fight.
2765;There were great performances all around.
2766;I always pay attention to the music, and Howard Shore's (LOTR trilogy, and so many others) score is excellent.
2767;For my money, I love this movie, and don't care to debate it.

2770;I thought that seeing that rat running across the balcony railing against the backdrop of the mosque was an interesting choice.

2772;I doubt I would watch this film more than once, but it's one of the best acted films I've seen.
2773;The documentary portion of the set is very interesting, but I do not believe that any of the deleted scenes would have made a better film.
2774;I've always enjoyed Scorsese's work.
2775;When I saw the amount of stars in this film, I knew I had to see it (especially because of Nicholson .
2776;It's a good thing that this film is jam.
2777;The performances by everyone in this movie is way above average but the story, although very sophisticated and well.

2780;Character flow is well developed.
2781;I don't know when I got off the movie appreciation bus, but after viewing this flick, I see now why I prefer production prior to the new millennium.
2782;While supported by a fantastic ensemble cast, the film also benefits from an intriguing plot and excellent screenplay.
2783;This set up leads to a thrilling ride supported by fantastic performances from Mark Wahlberg and Martin Sheen.
2784;martin Scorsese returns to the form that led to Goodfellas, one of the best movies of the late 20th century, and this film rightfully earned Oscars for Best Picture and Best Director.
2785;Overall, excellent performances and fantastic screenplay elevate The Departed above any other cinematic effort in 2006, and is a great way to spend two and a half hours.
2786;life for the subject matter.
2787;That aside, I enjoyed the movie.
2788;if you like the organized crime genre and dark, tragedies this is a good accompaniment for your next batch of home.
2789;And yet The Departed does, somehow, manage to be almost as good as the film that spawned it.
2790;This surprised me, given both the level of accomplishment found in the vast majority of American remakes of Asian films, no matter who's at the helm, and the level of accomplishment found in Martin Scorsese's films of late.
2791;The Departed shows Scorsese back with a vengeance.
2792;Yeah, that's the entire setup.
2793;But if you think about it for even a few seconds, you can start seeing all the many, many places a really good scriptwriter can go with a setup like this.
2794;And rest assured, Siu Fao Mak and Felix Chong, who wrote the original script, are very good.
2795;Pushcart Prize winner William Monahan (Kingdom of Heaven), who adapted the original screenplay into English, did the right thing by, for the most part, simply getting out of the way and staying faithful to the original.
2796;girlfriend is expanded upon somewhat, but the rest is faithful to the spirit, if not always the letter, of the original).
2797;He's never been this good.
2798;But Martin Scorsese, he knows from gangster flicks, and he goes for the best.
2799;hand man, a guy who can go from affable drunk to sadistic psycho in the space of a breath (yeah, you've met him in the form of Joe Pesci before, but Winstone's even better at it).
2800;There's this air of coldness about him that's just perfect.
2801;this is good stuff, this is.
2802;If it's half this good it'll be worth seeing in the theaters.
2803;On a positive note, this is how re.
2804;Don't get me wrong, this is a very entertaining film, with great acting from a solid lead and supporting cast.
2805;Alec Baldwin steals the scene whenever he's in the frame.
2806;DiCaprio shows glimpses of brilliance with his tortured character, and Jack Nicholson does what he does best, and plays it cool.
2807;Each time it gets betterFirst thought: Dicaprio is a world class actor, and the star in the Jason Borne series needs not explaining, except to note that he was a Southie and created the movie script for his first film as a Southie.
2808;I deeply value my past as a spy beacuse it allows me to serve the public by saying IDIOCY AND DECEPTION.
2809;That is the only unrealistic aspect of this otherwise superb movie.
2810;I know this is considered an outstanding film and it won a bunch ofawards, but I had to fast forward through the movie because it was so long.
2811;Maybe it's testimony to something about DiCaprio's ability to truly share the screen, but Farmiga is just as exceptional in this film as Cate Blanchet was in the Aviator.
2812;"long the best part of shows like ""Touching Evil"" and ""UC: Undercover,"" Vera Farmiga brings a vulnerable honesty to her role, even as she plays against some of Hollywood's heaviest hitters."
2813;that said, the plot gives the audience an interesting twist on the roles of the police and criminals as each side shows its factionalism and parallels.
2814;A great cop, gangster movie with a well developed plot.
2815;Is a good movie to own.
2816;Scorsese's remake dispenses almost entirely with this rich theme and turns the mole in the police force (played by Matt Damon) into an inexpressive walking blank spot and DiCaprio (playing the cop turned criminal) into a panic stricken caricature.
2817;in the original movie each of the leading men found comfort, along with an exploration of their identity crisis, in their relationship with a woman.
2818;Unable to control Nicholson (or perhaps encouraging him to overact.
2819;the acting and script are the best I have seen of this sortand there have been a whole lot of these dirty cop movies.
2820;the gangsters are winning as this movie starts.
2821;the inside man is a young fellow who is ambitious for higher things.
2822;Damon is Colin Sullivan, a seemingly straight.
2823;In addition to Di Caprio and Damon, who provide some of the most solid and subtle work of their careers thus far, the movie boasts Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg in stellar supporting roles.
2824;the greatest strength of the film lies in the complexity of the storyline, as the parallel cat.
2825;mouse scenarios continually twist and turn and ultimately dovetail into each other as the movie builds to its frenzied conclusion.
2826;balletic beauty to much of the plotting as Costigan and Sullivan both struggle with the paranoia and fear that come from having to conceal their true identities from their colleagues at work and the love interest they unknowingly share on the side.
2827;"a kind of unity and focus that turned ""Goodfellas"" into an instant classic of the gangster film genre."
2828;a good film but not a great one.
2829;I don't usually get into gangster movies with a lot of violence but the story to be told and the resulting acting of the cast is mesmerizing.
2830;Edge of your seat suspense!
2831;Everything under the moon is already written about this fantastic movie.
2832;Great gangster, Mafia, story with great cast, directed by great director Scorsese.
2833;Liked it from start to finish and Nicholson is superb.
2834;Well paced, suspense, action, what more could you ask for??
2835;Loved it great acting lotsa blood but riveting You know Scorsese its gonna be awesome.
2836;Love it at the movies.
2837;The acting was superb for all the major characters, and it won an Oscar for best picture and best director.
2838;If one can forgo the language, this is a film to watch.
2839;great acting, well photographed, an edge of a seat story.
2840;"Damon is Colin Sullivan, a rising star of the ""Staties"" (Boston State police) and soon assigned to a high."
2841;style gangster tale than John LeCarre transplanted to Boston.
2842;The Departed is a great movie, but not necessarily a great Scorsese movie.
2843;The big draw here are the leads .
2844;Even the 2nd stringers here are great .
2845;Damon's character is so determined to look squeaky.
2846;form for Scorsese but it's more a hint of what Scorsese was, and the much better movies he used to make.
2847;This is the best movie I have seen in a very long time.
2848;He does a magnificent job of this .
2849;Nevertheless he and Martin Sheen do excellent jobs.
2850;The screen play is one of the best written in a very long time.
2851;The cinematography and set design are also well done.
2852;The movie is spellbinding from start to finish and you are on the edge of your seat the full time.
2853;The tension felt by DiCaprio and Damon is palpable.
2854;There is no doubt in my mind that this is an Oscar Winner and would be a logical winner for Best Picture, Best Screen Play, Best Actor, and Best Supporting Actor.
2855;This was an excellent story well told by Scorsese.
2856;I disagree this is right up there as one of the top 10 movies of the past 20 years!!
2857;This movie is more about style.
2858;admittedly, Scorsese probably aimed at keeping audiences guessing who's.
2859;the scene in which Nicholson and DiCaprio engage in a tense cat.
2860;These moments will draw you in.
2861;You may admire, for example, Jack Nicholson's sheer panache as he appears out of a back room spattered with blood, banters a bit, issues a few commands, then returns to .
2862;All I can say is.
2863;martin Scorsese's The Departed is an action movie that builds in intensity right through to the end.
2864;"jack Nicholson makes for a mean gangster, and transitions between a friendly ""uncle."
2865;he escaped and is believed to be alive .
2866;"but I am sure the ""modifications"" were to achieve a greater dramatic impact."
2867;I am a big fan of this movie.
2868;I saw it in a theatre, felt I got my money's worth, but pretty much forgot it by the time I reached home.
2869;What stunned me was a recent critics' poll in Film Comment that listed it as the best film of the year.
2870;so I was surprised they acclaimed it so highly.
2871;the strengths of The Departed are the performances of Leonardo DiCaprio and Ray Winstone, the swift pacing (a result of Scorsese's editor, Thelma Schoonmaker's, usual brilliant work) and the premise, lifted from the Hong Kong actioner, Infernal Affairs, which Scorsese's film might be a slight improvement from.
2872;Also, Mark Wahlberg's profanity spewing performance somehow manages to be very entertaining.
2873;this is far below Scorsese's best work, some of which represents the best of American cinema.
2874;The Departed is merely well crafted entertainment.
2875;Good movie involving moles and rats.
2876;This movie has such intriguing twists and turns and suspense.
2877;The way the two main characters morals and experiences directly oppose each other makes the movie compelling to watch.
2878;This may be Martin Scorsese's crowning achievement.
2879;It did, after all, finally bring that elusive first, and very much deserved, Best Director Oscar.
2880;The Departed goes straight to the top of my favorite Scorsese movies, ahead ofTaxi Driver (Two.
2881;Leonardo DiCaprio as the undercover, and Matt Damon as the crooked cop, are outstanding in these roles.
2882;both sides of the law soon discover that they have a mole in their organization, and efforts are made to learn his identity.
2883;That's the main plot line, and Scorsese does a masterful job of building the tension to an almost unbearable level.
2884;It's typical Jack, which is to say it's brilliant.
2885;Also present are Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin as police captains, and they do good work here.
2886;But the rest of the cast is outstanding, too, as they play the balance of the cops and Irish Mafia members convincingly well.
2887;i enjoyed everything about this movie.
2888;even the music is a joy.
2889;and repeat viewings further my appreciation of an expertly crafted piece of film making.
2890;ray disc is of course beautiful, and has good extras included, but any version of this movie is going to make you happy you bought it.
2891;It is an instant classic by one of the greatest American directors ever.
2892;lower your expectations, have a few beers, and enjoy.
2893;great movie, really enjoyed the plot.
2894;so suprised at the end of the movie!
2895;This movie is obviously great .
2896;If you enjoy plot twists and the kind of movie you have to pay close attention to, this is it.
2897;It definitely has a lot of action.
2898;The cast does an outstanding job, and the plot if effortlessly gripping, outrageous, and dark.
2899;All around a great movie.
2900;Great movie, NOT one of Scorsche's best but it is still really good.
2901;Dont belive all the awards hype, this movie is good, possibly really good, but not great.
2902;Espcially not best picture great.
2903;But if you like Scorsche and you are into his style of movie making check this movie out, its really entertaining and worth the money
2904;Either way, you'll experience film making by a true genius, who are in short supply these days.
2905;For me this is the perfect storm of all things action.
2906;Once again I have to say that I love the Gangster Movies.
2907;Great flick and would recommend it to anyone :) The actors are amazing.
2908;Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Leo DiCaprio are perfect for their roles in this movie.
2909;But it is still amazing.
2910;cop/new guy in their gang!This movie ONLY won an Oscar for best movie cause of ScoreSleazy's prior movies.
2911;Nicholson delivers a fantastic performance, creating one of the most memorable bad guys of the last 10 years.
2912;But IMHO this overly strong performance actually comes very close to overshadowing the entire theme of the story.
2913;stealing is eminently watchable but undermimes the central Damon.
2914;The basic story of IA was sufficiently brilliant enough to allow transposition to New England without any hint of awkwardness.
2915;Here, Scorsese works brilliantly with the script and actors to give a convincing Bostonian feel to the movie.
2916;The accents are natural enough, the settings feel right, and the details put the audience right in the heart of Boston (such as the rugby games etc).
2917;TD adds the dimension of a love triangle evolving between Damon, DiCaprio and the psychiatrist.
2918;Yeah right, so in a large city like Boston it just so happens that these two moles are stalking each other .
2919;But after watching TD, it actually works OK.
2920;That is a terrible shame: it was easily one of the most poignant and emotional moments in both movies .
2921;Yes, he delivers a probably career.
2922;Anthony Wong's strong display on IA confirms this: properly acted out, his character is the mirror image and equal of Eric Tsang's.
2923;IA does a far better job of explaining why he didn't give up this secret.
2924;He is cool and calculating, and he is the one who consciously makes the decision that he no longer wants to be a gangster .
2925;He is therefore fated to live on in this purgatory existence .
2926;In TD, Damon's role is made much more simple.
2927;Much is being said about the excellent acting throughout TD.
2928;Besides ol' Jack, DiCaprio really gives one of the best acting performances of the year.
2929;He is truly wonderful to watch and convinces us with his torment and suffering.
2930;What DiCaprio delivered with his face, Leung delivered with his eyes alone.
2931;Tony Leung is widely considered to be one of the best actors of all time from Asia.
2932;All four Hong Kong leads were Best Actor award winners at least once in Asian film circles.
2933;Alec Baldwin gives a wonderfully steely, hard.
2934;far superior to the purely comic Hong Kong equivalent.
2935;The story is much better told with a beautifully crafted balance of characters and wits on both sides.
2936;The emotions and conflicts of the two key protagonists are better portrayed and much more convincing.
2937;In its own right, it is a wonderfully acted and directed movie, with great chracter developments .
2938;especially in the early part of the film.
2939;For those who have not watched IA (or can't be bothered to read subtitles), TD easily represents one of the best movies of 2006 and one of the best ever crime movies from Hollywood.
2940;Even for fans of IA, the differences between IA and TD are sufficently interesing enough for one to momentarily overlook the obvious plagiaristic elements and enjoy the experience.
2941;Watching TD for the 1st two times is probably more entertaining than re.
2942;Maybe Scorsese will finally win his Best Director Oscar.
2943;with even most of the clever directorial flourishes also reproduced exactly verbatim from Internal Affairs.
2944;This is a completely mesmerizing film, definitely not for the squeamish.
2945;The body count is uber high.
2946;Martin Scorsese's film is boasts an impressive cast.
2947;leonardo DiCaprio is brilliant in his portrayal of Billy Costigan, an undercover cop working as a mole in the Irish Mafia.
2948;Matt Damon, Mark Wahlberg and Martin Sheen give solid performances in the film.
2949;Vera Farmiga, the psychiatrist treating both Damon and DiCaprio's characters,gives a wonderful performance.
2950;the Departed delivers a powerful story that will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the film.
2951;I highly recommend the film, but with a very strong warning about the graphic portrayal of violence.
2952;as a mature, believable, adult actor.
2953;"day ""Hamlet"" tale about a young man's desperate search for identity, he gains it."
2954;In the film's last incredibly tense, headspinning moments, we learn that 1.
2955;Yet in the midst of all the violence and bloodshed, and despite all the lunacy and confusion, justice and clarity win out after all.
2956;"This is, in many respects, the film befitting a mature, or ""senior,"" director, who is moreover a man of faith."
2957;The movie is superb and the Blu.
2958;ray makes it even better.
2959;Matt was good in the Bourne series .
2960;I never moved from my seat for the entire length of this flick.
2961;This is by far the best action movie I've seen in a really long time, with an actual plot, and everyone in it delivered a top shelf performance.
2962;The soundtrack was perfect also.
2963;Once upon a time Martin Scorcese was able to do great movies like the age of inocence.
2964;The story is great and the acting superb!
2965;There are twists and turns in the plot that keep you wondering what will happen next.
2966;An all star cast and a great sound track.
2967;If you love a good gagster movie then this is a MUST SEE!
2968;this is the best movie ever, i have seen it over 30 times.
2969;The Departed is insanely long, but it's absolutely worth watching.
2970;This movie will keep you engaged until your bladder interrupts, but I assure you that you'll rush back to finish it just as soon as you're done taking care of business.
2971;okay, maybe it's not the best movie ever made, as it definitely has some heavy contenders, but it's one of the best films.
2972;Acting was great, characters were great, they captured Boston really well, and hey.
2973;it's one of the best movies ever.
2974;I finally got around to watching this, on the night it won Best Picture no less.
2975;But this movie was well made and has an interesting story.
2976;star cast including Jack Nicholson, one of my favorites.
2977;"i was riveted to the TV while watching Goodfellas and Casino
2978;I thought the shipping and handling charges were high.
2979;everybody overuses it in this picture.
2980;The action without the F word is excellent as usual as DiCaprio and Damon as well as Nicholson of course are doing an excellent job, and so does Wahlberg, Baldwin and the rest of the cast .
2981;it's a like a modern.
2982;The photography is also great and very graphic, and the soundtrack fits the mood.
2983;Do I recommend this movie?
2984;You'll live with just seeing the trailer.
2985;Definitely NOT a film that the """"whole family"""" can enjoy."""
2986;Be that as it may, the movie itself was good, and very intense.
2987;Scorsese had a great movie going until the end, but instead of coming up with a realistic or thought provoking ending he sold out for the easy box office cash cow and killed everybody off.
2988;Obviously his academy award win was more of a life time achievement award than it was for this movie.
2989;"The film is a revisting the ""gangster epics"" that, for some strange reason, Martin Scorcese is most associated with (they actually represent a small percentage of his film portfolio), true, but the man is brilliant as always, particularly at his usual ."
2990;bringing the best out of his actors, and creating stirring visuals to punctuate the story.
2991;Yet another sign of a true master.
2992;The story is gripping and will keep your interest at a high level.
2993;Once again, Scorsese is at the top of HIS game.
2994;All the things that made his past movies work, added with an excellent plot show why this movie could be his first Oscar win or best director.
2995;"Nicholson gives the performance that we are used to Jack giving
2996;DiCaprio is brilliant, Scorsese seems to bring this out of him more than any other director.
2997;Damon, who I am honestly not a huge fan of, was excellent.
2998;Wahlberg, Baldwin, and Sheen portray their characters very well.
2999;The plot was very well directed onto screen, a very character driven storyline.
3000;The story weaves and cross weaves on screen excellently and is pretty easy to follow.
3001;Once again Scorsese's camera work is phenomenal, reminiscent to all of his classics.
3002;If you loved his classics, you will love this movie.
3003;You be thinking about the truly great parts.
3004;while it's hard to say this is Scorses's best with all that he's done, it certainly has to be up there.
3005;finish, this movie will have you focused, engaged, and waiting on the edge of your seat to see what happens next and what twist the movie takes.
3006;notch acting, to the dialogue, to the plot/plot twists, and the often overlooked soundtrack, this movie is brilliant to perfect in each of these respects.
3007;Nicholson deserves a best actor or supporting actor nomination and should win for his villainous kingpin role and DiCaprio as usual has a strong performance.
3008;For the supporting roles, Mark Wahlberg steals the screen when he's in them, you can't take your eyes off Vera Farmiga(Running Scared, Manchurian Candidate), whose innocence among characters mired in crime shine's like her eyes, and Ray Winstone(Sexy Beast, King Arthur) is great as Nicholson's right hand man.
3009;Dialogue, as always for Scorsese, is great with some of Nicholson's lines being Tarantino.
3010;It's pretty clear whose side everyone is """"really"""" on, but the storyline takes a few U. turns that are just part of the reason why this movie is so good."""
3011;And like I said, the soundtrack is excellent from the numerous Rolling Stones tunes in it, to some Allman Bros., to Dropkick Murphy's highlighting the Irish.
3012;Simply put, some scenes in this movie are even better and more memorable becuase of the songs playing at that time and the soundtrack.
3013;I can't think of a Tom Hanks or Russell Crowe movie that has come out yet this year, so maybe the Academy will finally give a Best Picture Oscar to Scorsese.
3014;"Martin Scorsese made a surprising choice when he agreed to film ""The Departed,"" because it is a very loyal remake of the Hong Kong 2002 demi."
3015;"route before with 1991's ""Cape Fear,"" but he has largely made his mark as one of cinema's most original directors."
3016;The Departed succeeds on that score, not by reinventing the plot, but by reimagining the characters.
3017;The fact that Scorsese was able to line up a stellar cast of Jack Nicholoson, Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio, Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen, Mark Walberg, Ray Winstone, and Vera Farmiga (along with a solid supporting cast) ensures that William Monahan's screenplay is never dull.
3018;intelligent, but running away from a family who has long connections with Boston crime.
3019;Eventually, DiCaprio and Damon are charged with finding the mole in Costello's and the cop's operations .
3020;what could have been played for nothing more than slick, cool operations becomes a soul.
3021;Both Damon and DiCaprio give solid performances as the pressure of living dual lives wears away at their identity.
3022;"a violent, macho movie, ""The Departed"" is widely recognized as one of Scorsese's better films, but definitely not one of his best."
3023;So it will always have a bit of notoriety as the movie that won Scorsese's first Oscar .
3024;but Hollywood has a long tradition of rewarding second.
3025;"After all, Russell Crowe won Best Actor for Maximus in ""Gladiator"" but was not honored for his other stellar work in ""The Insider,"" ""Master and Commander,"" etc. if you can separate ""The Departed"" from its ""Best Picture"" status, it is an enjoyable film."
3026;"If you have recently seen ""Infernal Affairs,"" you will recognize the basic plot instantly, but you can still savor the performances by one of the best testosterone."
3027;A must see and for most guys, a must.
3028;Jack Nicholson is brilliant .
3029;"seems to have lots of fun being an arch villain
3030;Plot twists and drama holds up to the very last frame.
3031;I absolutely loved this film, loved the games played with classic country and modern day rap .
3032;If you can get past the gore, go and enjoy.
3033;I hope Scorsese is awarded an Oscar for this one.
3034;So had to see it again to refresh myself.
3035;But the real punch is in dialogues and expressions.
3036;Each character has played its part to perfection.
3037;for me best was di caprio.
3038;He is on edge throughout.
3039;Most of them aren't worth your while, but once in a blue moon, a great one is produced.
3040;And The Departed presents the director in top shape.
3041;Based on the incredible asian movie Infernal Affairs, The Departed is a wonderful film.
3042;The film presents this violent world in a very realistic way.
3043;As times goes by, it seems that Nicholson is becoming less of an actor and becoming more of a walking joke.
3044;Supported with strong performances by Sheen and Whalberg, The Departed is a violent and often funny dark film that gives you exactly what you wanted.
3045;The Departed has some great performances and interesting twists in the story.
3046;for most of the film the story and characters pull you along and keep you interested.
3047;complex for its fast pace.
3048;wise, it turns out to be a 135.
3049;The psychologist is a young woman who provides the requisite female love.
3050;interest for the women watching this story.
3051;There is even a hint that the king.
3052;First of all, let me make it clear that I was jazzed about seeing this movie, and was surprised that I didnt love it.
3053;who grew up in South Boston, not Cambridge, like Damon, but, I did totally understand her feelings for DiCaprio, he is just naturally so much more sexy and interesting than Damon, I have a feeling if you met them in real life you would feel the same way.
3054;I do recommend seeing this film, Scorcese is a great director and the film is art, but it's not Goodfella's or Raging Bull.
3055;i have seen this movie and this is a fair synopsis, well articulated, thoughtout and whether you agree or not: valid.
3056;Entertaining and suspenseful from beginning to end.
3057;But if you want entertainment it's great.
3058;The pacing is incredibly tight .
3059;star cast works together in a way that NBA coach Phil Jackson would be proud of.
3060;Every scene is a give.
3061;take where ego is set aside in favor of making the best film possible.
3062;Great writing, directing, acting, etc.
3063;If I could give it more stars I would.
3064;The movie is still amazing, and in Blu.
3065;Amazon, as usual, was quick and efficient!
3066;Suspenseful and kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time.
3067;Super violent but really good.
3068;Damon being from Boston NAILS the accent and demeanor perfectly.
3069;star cast and amazing story line, the Departed is gripping and intense!
3070;A little long, but action packed throughout.
3071;One of my favorite movies.
3072;The Departed is another future classic movie directed by Martin Scorsese.
3073;Matt Damon does a good job of playing Collin Sullivan, who is an SUI officer.
3074;There is action from the opening until the closing of the movie.
3075;the ending is surprising which is good.
3076;i rate this movie with 4 stars.
3077;I am amazed that Hollywood can complain about bootlegging and movie pirating at one moment, and the next get away with a collosal ripoff of an acclaimed international success, stamp it unique and original, win several Academy Nominations, and give absolutely no credit to the source or inspiration of the film.
3078;If one were to recall in 2006, a film entitled The Departed took the stage as one of the most successful box office hits in the world, grossing hundreds of millions of dollars, and jam.
3079;People who professed to know everything about films, hailed the movie as """"another Scorsese achievement!"""
3080;Putting integrity aside, the fact that he and his team got away with hundred of millions of dollars in revenue, and received some of the highest honors and most prestigious awards in the industry, all from a film largely adapted from another film, should certainly be considered an achievement of sorts, shouldn't it?While I visualize the scene of this movie's inception in my mind, I can't help but be amused at how easily The Departed met with success.
3081;I imagine it happened something like this.
3082;on one of Brad Pitt's whimsical excursions to the east, he sees Infernal Affairs for the first time.
3083;"Next thing he knows, he's pitching the idea to Scorsese in the following paraphrase, ""Hey Martin, I have this great screenplay I want to run by you."""
3084;and kept laughing all the way to the bank.
3085;Secondly, it reflects on the level of astuteness of the American audience .
3086;and finally the combination of these two things leads to the conclusion that we will continue to see many more of these foreign remakes to come.
3087;a cracking cast, all give fine performances.
3088;This is certainly the best thing I've seen Leonardo Decaprio do, by quite a margin.
3089;Jack Nicolson is in top form and there are some good smaller roles for both Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin.
3090;Scorcese directs with the pace and panache that you've come to expect from the director of the five classics above.
3091;"it is a remake of the Hong Kong movie ""Infernal Affairs"", and Scorcese gives full credit to that movie in the credits."
3092;this is a hugely entertaining film and strongley recommended.
3093;Excellent performances from Leo DiCaprio and Matt Damon.
3094;How after being in so many movies can you keep your performances fresh?
3095;nicholson's portrayal of Frank Costello was realistic and refreshing.
3096;the movie as a whole was just excellent.
3097;The movie keeps you captivated from start to finish.
3098;The Departed is by far the best new movie that I've seen in years.
3099;The Departed is excellent, a must have blu.
3100;The Departed is presented in 2.35:1 widescreen, VC.1 format, with excellent 5.1 PCM sound.
3101;The suspense grabs you early on and keeps you glued to the screen all the way to the end.
3102;Aside for some unnecessary vulgarities, the departed is one of the best movies I have seen in years.
3103;If you haven't seen the Hong Kong version, I highly recommend it.
3104;The Departed is a thoroughly engrossing and extremely intense thrill ride that has you laughing as much as it has you on the edge of your seat.
3105;"Leonardo DiCaprio and Jack Nicholson give class ""A"" performances while Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg completely blow it out of the water."
3106;This movie sets a new tone and raises the bar for all future plot.
3107;i'm not a big dicaprio fan, but he is perfect in this role.
3108;"Martin Scorsese's lifelong journey to winning his first Oscar ended with this thrilling police drama, ""The Departed""."
3109;The cast here is top notch, lead by multiple Oscar winner Jack Nicholson who is brilliant as mob boss, Jack Costello.
3110;He's charming, funny and disturbing.
3111;Watching this film reminds me of the work of Alfred Hitchcock.
3112;The film's writer, William Monahan (with the help of Hong Kong original writers) keeps us guessing on what will happen and it works ever so effectively.
3113;This is a film that is volent as Scorsese can make it and though not his best film, is worthy of Oscar's top prize.
3114;The writing, character development and plot were excellent.
3115;Leo and cast were absolutely believable in their roles.
3116;Him and Scorsese have always made a great combination.
3117;The Departed promises a satisfyingly intricate story, and I regret that I could not give the movie its due.
3118;Brilliant and memorable performances from a very well rounded veteran and all.
3119;downright epic performances from Matt Damon's portrayal of half cop half criminal Colin Sullivan and Mark Wahlberg's performance as Costigan's next in chain of command and hard as nails Staff Sgt. and Martin Sheen's performance as the one calling the shots as Capt. Queenam.
3120;Of course, my hat will go off to one of Hollywood's most precious gems and my ultimate motivation for seeing this movie.
3121;this film will of course go down as one of the best of 2006 and by the end of the decade will go down as one of the tops of the decade.
3122;just go and see it already.
3123;"Hollywood has welcomed a lot of great mob films (""The Godfather"" trilogy,""Goodfellas"",etc.),and a great addition to that genre of films has proven itself to be,by far,""The Departed""."
3124;It begins with a good depiction of Matt Damon's character in this film,Colin Sullivan.
3125;that is something for you to discover when you watch this film for the first time),the one man he had to get him through his childhood was Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson),a Boston mob moss who has politely welcomed Colin into his organization,with Colin and Frank remaining friends ever since they first met.
3126;For Colin and Frank,this is a trusted friendship that helps the both of them in the long run.
3127;"When it comes down to ""The Departed"",while this film is VERY long (close to the same amount of time that ""JFK"" and ""The Good Shepherd"" were)and is complicated and hard to follow,on top of those two flaws,it is an excellent film."
3128;The plot for this film is very smart while it has a great scipt accompanying it.
3129;As for the performances,Matt Damon turns in a good performance while Leonardo DiCaprio allows the film to be interesting,and gives in an entertaining performance.
3130;But,the performances here that are REALLY worth watching are the performances of Jack Nicholson and Mark Wahlberg.
3131;Nicholson brings a lot of suspense and drama into his performance,and allows viewers get to know his character and helps bring the film to life.
3132;As for Mark Wahlberg's performance,Wahlberg turns in one of the finest performances of his career here,as a no nonscence cop who plays it out tough until the very end.
3133;With his performance,not only does Mark Wahlberg contribute to this film's essence and success,at the same time,he allows his talent to continue to improve as an actor.
3134;Also,Martin Scorsese leads this film in a smart manner that will make one guessing until the very end,which is the main factor in this film being so well.
3135;planned and being the good film that it is.
3136;"if you are a fan of mob films,""The Departed"" is a must."
3137;It is one of the best films to ever have been made and released.
3138;"It has everything a good film needs (a great plot,a great script,a great cast,great acting,and a great director),and will probably continue to make an influence on film fans over the years,the same kind of influence that other mob films like ""Goodfellas"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" have."
3139;What you have here is a fine work of art.5/5
3140;funny, action, romance and thriller all at once.
3141;wasnt a huge fan of aviator, but this is on par with goodfellas.
3142;One of my all time favorites!
3143;Lots of suspense and action.
3144;Jack Nicholson is fabulous (as always) and its a star studded cast.
3145;Really an all time great film!
3146;Eventhough this movie is watchable it has many flaws.
3147;Better get while the gettin's good.
3148;that's such an important message to hammer home to people nowadays, especially young people.
3149;If prefer your killin' close up and personal, there's probably nothing more satisfying than the close range head shots in The Departed, complete with realistic exploding skulls and Hollywood.
3150;Scorsese got the Oscar for this simply because Hollywood wanted to give him an Oscar.
3151;Excellent, excellent movie with top notch acting and a fantastic script!
3152;"I know most people ""loved"" the film and thought it was so fresh and wonderful."
3153;This is another Scorsese masterpiece.
3154;"It has the elements of a classic movie
3155;It was intriguing, a portrait of human behavior, and the acting in this movie was fantastic in every way, particularly Leo DiCaprio's portrayal of his character.
3156;there are twists and turns and surprises even to a seasoned and jaded movie.
3157;The characters were unusual, interesting, believable, and you felt like you got to know them.
3158;You felt their motivations for things, and what they are feeling inside.
3159;There is a particularly amusing supporting role by Mark Wahlberg.
3160;Jack Nicholson added a lot of his own flavor to this movie and his own character, which really flushed out the """"evils of man."""
3161;Everything about this movie is so good.
3162;Highly recommend viewing it if you haven't already.
3163;What you get is a one helluva twister of a movie.
3164;In the midst of all that, there's a love traingle that evolves between a police therapist and both Damon and DiCaprio.
3165;The movie is fun, but not colossal like Scorsese's classics Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, Casino, and his previous film, The Aviator.
3166;great Scorcese movie and a stellar cast
3167;The Departed is a very good movie, full of big name actors that throw down some of their finest performances.
3168;The Departed is deserving of every bit of praice and accolades it has seen.
3169;The plot line was entertaining, thrilling and entirely unpredictable.
3170;When Scorsese is in his element you have cinema at its finest.
3171;The choice of music, locations, and photographic technique are top notch.
3172;Leonardo Decaprio continues to amaze me .
3173;this guy has become one of the best leading men of our time.
3174;The plot twists are just classic Scorsese .
3175;he combines elements of the modern action/thrillers with the classic noir films that obviously have had an influence on his career.
3176;What a treat it is when you can go to a theatre and actually be totally enchanted by something .
3177;a good story line and the way the storyline unfolds.
3178;The usual time for a Scorsese picture.
3179;The only thing amazing about this film is all the hype.
3180;words without sounding like they came right out of a script.
3181;so far it has held up good over the few years i've had it with watching it year by year.
3182;This film is great, a great guy flick.
3183;the reason why this is such a great movie is that it is also full of amazing acting, a rich plotline, and amazing direction.
3184;One of the best cop films ever made.
3185;Superb cast, great directing, exciting script, and at times, funny to boot.
3186;I just saw Martin Scorsese's new film, The Departed, last night and I have to say .
3187;Scorsese is back in top form here, revisiting the mobster genre that he has been known for over the years.
3188;I would rank this one up with his classic film .
3189;and one of my personal favorites .
3190;It's nice to see Marty swing back to his gritty, ultra.
3191;Jack Nicholson was perfect as Frank Costello, a mob boss who is in charge of the organized crime ring in Boston.
3192;Both men cross paths, and fall in love with the same woman .
3193;The performances from the leads are all Oscar.
3194;He was quite good in Good Will Hunting and he was great in The Talented Mr. Ripley, and his performance here is no exception.
3195;Leonardo DiCaprio gives his best performance here since What's Eating Gilbert Grape.
3196;This is Jack Nicholson's first film with Scorsese, which is hard to believe, but it is true.
3197;Jack is back to what he does best in this role, and, pardon the cliche, but it fits him like a glove.
3198;His performance is one of ferocious intensity, and everytime he's on the screen, you feel really uneasy.
3199;I've already said enough about Scorsese, but the man knows how to make a great film!
3200;I must also give credit to the editor, Thelma Schoonmaker, who worked on Goodfellas.
3201;Another criticism is that Scorsese won the Oscar for Best Director for this instead of several superior films.
3202;I must admit I haven't seen Infernal Affairs, and there are still a few Scorsese films that I haven't got around to, but I am certain that The Departed is my favorite from the many I have seen.
3203;the Departed works for me because of Scorsese and the incredible cast.
3204;DiCaprio and Damon are both superb in their roles and both are among my favorite modern actors.
3205;Jack Nicholson dominates the screen as Frank Costello and Ray Winstone is perfect as his main sidekick.
3206;What's not to like?The movie has a complicated plot and it's a pleasure to see it unfold.
3207;The characters have considerable depth and I always come away from the movie feeling that I know them.
3208;the Departed won Oscars for Best Director, Film Editing, Adapted Screenplay and Best Picture.
3209;Writing this now, I realize that I need to see the movie again soon.
3210;It's definitely one of my favorites and easily in my Top 20.
3211;This movie was fantastic up until the end.
3212;"While this is not my favorite work from Scorsese as I appreciated more his ""Gangs of New York"" and ""The Aviator"", this is a very solidly made film."
3213;It is very engrossing with both multi.
3214;The film, like many Scorsese efforts, is visually stunning and graphic.
3215;DiCaprio delivers another awesome performance, his third with Scorsese, and Matt Damon and Jack Nicoholson are top.
3216;The script is very original and I enjoyed the many surprising plot twists.
3217;The title should give away to you a lot about how the story ends, but I'll just say that it is a sad story in the end.
3218;Martin Scorsese is my favorite director.
3219;I hold the mob/gangster flick closer than any genre.
3220;I can accept any premise and watch it for that level.
3221;The premise is delicious: Jack Nicholson as a gonzo Whitey Bulger and an assorted cast of misfit sadist mobsters and dirty cops turn Boston's Southie section into a meat grinder.
3222;Great Movie with lots of action and an engrossing plot.
3223;The acting is above par for all of the three main stars.
3224;Very few actors these days know how to act and Nicholson is one.
3225;acted every big star in this movie including Jack and Matt.
3226;i have watched his performances over the years and he's shown mostly a gentle side.
3227;when I checked the movie out, I thought the casting was remarkable.
3228;Leo in contrast to Leo looked remarkable.
3229;what distinctions do I see that had Leo as the superior of the cast?
3230;Jack put in a remarkable performance, even though his character lacked sympathy.
3231;"He still had to bring his ""A"" game to his scenes with Leo."
3232;Watch the movie and notice who gets your attention the most.
3233;I would have them do a role reversal and Leo had the most energy.
3234;That energy put him over the top.
3235;He balanced and juggled as well, if not better, that he ever has.
3236;This film has little redeeming value without the star power including the director.
3237;This is one of the WORST movies I've ever seen.
3238;both actors phoning in their performances.
3239;The strongest feeling I had toward them all was WHO CARES?I need to stop thinking about this movie.
3240;The only standouts were Alec Baldwin and a surprisingly solid Mark Walberg.
3241;I was taken out of the movie everytime Leo or Matt interacted with the female love interest.
3242;"this ranks right up there with ""American Beauty"", ""Crash"", and ""Forrest Gump"" for the Academy's tendency to pick contrived scenery."
3243;Such is the finesse of the director.
3244;The acting is brilliant and almost everyone delivers.
3245;It is amazing to see that he can still go on delivering memorable performances for his age.
3246;one of the finest scenes of the movie is the conversation scene between DiCaprio and Jack Nicholson after the latter suspects a rat in his band of men.
3247;Full stars to DeCaprio and Jack.
3248;There are several other notable and dramatic scenes exuding brilliant performances from the stars bringing the climax to a heart pounding finish.
3249;I enjoy this action/drama movie.
3250;I enjoy watching it time and time again.
3251;I think Leonardo DiCaprio is very handsome in this movie.
3252;I think he is handsome in all movies.
3253;I happen to also find Matt Damon very sexy.
3254;Another DiCaprio movie directed by Scorsese.
3255;Great action and guts, but somehow Dicaprio is sleepwalking through this one, with Damon more convincing as a seedy, sleazy recruit gone bad.
3256;The violence builds up and gets labyrinthine, as the two characters close in on each other.
3257;Great action, great guesswork, but somehow Dicaprio and Nicholson feel miscast.
3258;The actors are great, the plot takes many turns that don't reveal themselves until the last miniute.
3259;I 'm glad I bought it so I can see it more than once.
3260;DiCaprio and Nicholson brilliant as always as undercover cop and mafia boss.
3261;Score another fine film from Martin Scorsese.
3262;It does a remarkable job showing us the dark side of human nature as people often struggle to better themselves .
3263;a lofty goal but done without guidance or morals.
3264;Matt Damon is at his best in this role filled with dualities.
3265;Jack Nicholson proves once again that he is an actor's actor.
3266;He is believable and powerful as the ruthless antagonist.
3267;Leonardo DiCaprio is truly a sympathetic character, and he plays that role with heart.
3268;His portrayal of the angst.
3269;filled, loyal tough guy is accurate and strong!
3270;The movie moves along on a fairly fast track, keeping the audience on its toes.
3271;The lighting is a wonderful enhancer to the intricacies of the plot .
3272;Martin Scorsese knows how to do it!
3273;I really loved this flick!
3274;Top notch actors, great story, looking forward to watching it a second time in the future.
3275;Great MOVIE that everyone that likes action and drama should watch, without fail.
3276;Great actors in the movie, happy to have it.
3277;This is one of those movies that you know the minute that you see it, that it is an instant classic.
3278;That everyone you know will watch it.
3279;That it will receive a million awards.
3280;Every actor in this film did a great job.
3281;The original fits what Martin loves to make movies about but I would have hoped he presented the movie like how Guillermo Del Toro and now Quentin Tarantino do for the films they love to watch and support.
3282;Very pleased and impressed since I loved Martin's crime stories and all.
3283;The originals are great films otherwise you wouldn't ever get this remake.
3284;fai Lai) work is more complimentary to Michael Chapman's style for those of you who loved Taxi Driver and Goodfellas.
3285;I like the style of the actor's work with the nice subtle vibe going on with the cinematography in the original that I always enjoyed in Martin's style in his films and with Michael Chapman work which was what i was expecting to feel but didn't (the film Bringing Out The Dead is a great film by the way).
3286;Every other death scene had nice work put into it but this was a combination of over the top and under worked.
3287;i felt the relationships with the female characters and the male leads were not forced as they were in the departed.
3288;I do give props to the film makers as they did credit the ones who made the story.
3289;This movie is cute and if you have never seen the original like any other remake, you may enjoy it.
3290;Gotta give props and credit for where credit is do.
3291;This is a L. o. n. g movie, but it keeps moving through most of it.
3292;There is a lot of action that will keep you entertained.
3293;It leads to a surprising ending with loose ends.
3294;There is this huge, wonderfully decorated box.
3295;And what a return it is!The Departed scores big on almost every possible level.
3296;Let's begin with the cast.
3297;Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, and Mark Wahlberg all perform magnificent in their roles.
3298;It's almost surreal having all these actors together for one film.
3299;Both actors obtain small roles but deliver on screen monumental results.
3300;jack Nicholson continues to prove why he is still one of the best actors in the business.
3301;His character, Costello, is psychotic and fascinating.
3302;One can easily tell from Nicholson's eyes that he is relishing into his character and loving every minute of it.
3303;it's important to note that The Departed is the American version of Hong Kong's beloved masterpiece Infernal Affairs.
3304;The Departed reminds us that remakes can be done well and can be done right.
3305;It is treated with maturity and therefore, elevated to an art form.
3306;"A ""trick"" conveyed simply for an, ""Awesome!"""
3307;It is because it is handled with maturity.
3308;the Departed is a brilliant film which boasts a triumph return to Martin Scorsese's roots.
3309;A gorgeous display of cinematography by Michael Ballhaus, a slick cool acoustic guitar score by Howard Shore, and magnificent acting all.
3310;around by some of the best in Hollywood make The Departed one of the best films of the year.
3311;Scorsese finally won an award!!!!
3312;Excellent cast with DiCaprio, Damon, Nicholson, Sheen, and Wahlberg.
3313;Nonetheless, very good movie that has an excellent twist at the end.
3314;scorsese takes the audience from the beginning to the end of how crime and criminals don't go hand in hand and earning trust is a very big gamble.
3315;Real movie buffs will really want to have this movie as part of there collection upon viewing this.
3316;Great cast for one, good plot, good acting among the stars, and lastly a good ending.
3317;loved it the first time I saw it.
3318;Loved it again the next time.
3319;A movie for the whole family to watch and enjoy together o
3320;mouse going on in this picture.
3321;hyped and watchable once and only once.
3322;Great show that is very creative and dramatic.
3323;The ending blows you away!
3324;This movie is not light and airy and fun.
3325;It is intense, violent and masterfully told.
3326;The Departed is not generally my type of movie, but it was well done.
3327;Great acting by everyone and great suspense .
3328;The 2nd disc is as good as the movie itself .
3329;glad I bought the 2 disc set.
3330;There was a moment near the beginning of the film during a funeral where I honestly felt that I could put my hand through the screen past the bagpipers in the foreground to touch the people all the way in the far background.
3331;Both mixes are great, if not overly active in the rear speakers.
3332;docs on the Boston Mob, Scorsese's filmmaking influences, deleted/extended scenes and a theatrical trailer.
3333;this is an excellent film, well acted, fairly well paced, good action and excellent atmosphere.
3334;however, the original film, infernal affairs, is much MUCH better.
3335;it has better camera work, better character development, better action.
3336;it is simply a better film.
3337;Let me start off by saying iam neither a fan of Leo nor Damon but suprinsingly they give good performances in this movie .
3338;Jack the man Nicholson carried most of the movie on his shoulders with Jack your always going to get your comedy and you do here in this movie as well.
3339;Pretty good until the last half hour.
3340;The Martin Scorsese directed film will be available to own in single and double.
3341;This is a fantastic action packed but bloody story of the corruption with the Boston Irish and law enforcement.
3342;definitely deserved all the kudos.
3343;the acting is extremely convincing (even matt damon did ok).
3344;Martin Scorsese has never won an Academy Award.
3345;He was nominated six times for the Best Director Oscar, yet never managed to snare one.
3346;"frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) is a Boston gangster who learned early that you have to take what you want
3347;He's applied this principle in his day.
3348;having established the criminals, Scorsese switches to a graduating class of police recruits.
3349;Both will figure significantly in the Boston police's plan to infiltrate Costello's inner circle.
3350;The Departed has a superb script by William Monahan.
3351;It is riveting, never predictable, and provides solid roles for its four stars.
3352;nicholson is an actor it's always fun to watch, but he can be excessive and allow his trademark quirks to run away with his performance.
3353;Nicholson is immersed in his performance.
3354;di Caprio turns in his finest performance since """"What's Eating Gilbert Grape."""""""
3355;He wants to succeed, but his personal safety is compromised with each day, causing him to balance his fear with focus on the job at hand.
3356;Di Caprio brings an intensity to the role that audiences haven't seen in his previous work.
3357;Damon's Sullivan is a smart cookie who rises quickly in the ranks of the police department.
3358;Damon gives Sullivan a preppy edge.
3359;His Sullivan is a man who's gone far and is capable of going even further.
3360;He calls things as he sees them, without tact, political correctness, or artifice.
3361;What you see is what he is.
3362;The screenplay is crafted so deftly that every scene, every bit of dialogue, every close.
3363;"i've seen many movies in 2006 and ""The Departed"" is easily the best."
3364;All the elements come together perfectly.
3365;The film's editing is quick and exciting, never sacrificing characterization in the process.
3366;"Not since Clint Eastwood's ""Mystic River"" has a director managed to corral such talent in a single film and come up with a winner."
3367;The Departed, plain and simple, is masterful movie making.
3368;perfect cast in a movie that showcases both that cast and his own ability to fashion intriguing cinema.
3369;Is it De Caprio's best performance?
3370;the movie commands a great script and the direction is right on.
3371;This movie is the best mafia movie since The Godfather, you will be riveted until the very end.
3372;The Departed is a powerful film with extraordinary performances by everyone involved.
3373;Hands down the best movie of 2006!
3374;I think this is a great movie.
3375;Well acted, enganging story, and great direction from Scorsese.
3376;Up there with his best work.
3377;This theme is one of the unique spots of the movie.
3378;the move also has the breakout role of Mark Wahlberg.
3379;In a sense it was a subtle show stealer .
3380;more than just a gangster/cop flick, this joins the gallery of the great gangster/cop flicks.
3381;Colin is well trained and Frank convinces him to join the Boston State Police as his source of crime and information.
3382;He tips Frank off for police operations while quickly moving his way up the ladder of success in the department.
3383;Billy Costigan is the most complex character thanks to the powerful performance by Leonardo DiCaprio.
3384;"diCaprio is truly a gifted and talented actor and continues to show us that he isn't the same boy/heartthrob from ""Titanic""
3385;DiCaprio's performance is the best of the star.
3386;His Boston accent is great and the fury that he finds in his character is remarkable.
3387;From his manipulation of the law to his constant deceit and betrayal of his peers, Damon truly finds his character's axis.
3388;The powerful and well put together screenplay elevates what could have been a very typical story and turns it into an action genre with slices of drama sequences that some films could only dream to be.
3389;The pace of the film is just right with all the right decisions being made.
3390;Jack is the man and while he deserves the acclaim that he hopefully will receive for the role, he is in no way walking to the podium to accept a fourth Oscar.
3391;Even though he does many wicked things in the film, you start to admire the spirit and reputation of Frank Costello.
3392;He is the best put together player, head to toe, from his monologues about his past to his devilish humor"
3393;There is no real reason to reiterate how great Jack is but it is great to see those sunglasses at the Kodak Theater from time to time.
3394;Martin Scorsese once again creates a beautifully constructed motion picture, leading the audience down a path of suspense and true grit.
3395;"Similar to the mold of ""Donnie Brasco"" (also portrays an undercover officer getting in good with a mob leader) but with a Scorsese twist
3396;tingling, brilliant, and utterly disappointing all at once.
3397;A must see for Leo and Marty fans.
3398;nominated crime thriller, for which he won a Best Director Golden Globe.
3399;But both sides soon discover there's a mole among them.
3400;It's the first Scorsese film that could be considered a """"cop movie,"""" as we're all more used to Scorsese's pure."""
3401;In the beginning Scorsese has a good time observing how DiCaprio's and Damon's characters fit into the roles they have to step into for the benefit of the organizations they have sworn allegiance to and for the downfall of the ones they are now a part of.
3402;Damon is conniving and working his way up the ladder, given respect and admiration by the people he is fighting against.
3403;It's this type of dramatic irony that Scorsese has the most fun with in this film and the movie succeeds as a fascinating examination of these lifestyles of grandeur and of disgrace and of the lies these men are living.
3404;At the end of it all, Scorsese's film is intense entertainment as well as a perceptive and intelligent film that scrutinizes the desire to serve the law.
3405;This is an outstanding movie.
3406;This is one of the best movies I have ever seen!
3407;The cast are some of the most talented actors in Hollywood today.
3408;He is absolutely amazing as the tortured William Costigan Jr.
3409;I'm actually watching it right now.
3410;"I'm not a huge fan of ""gangster"" flicks, but this one is perfect."
3411;There is so much cursing, too, which is wonderful!!
3412;the soundtrack is also terrific.
3413;I love everything about this movie.
3414;Great cast and scorcese film can't ask for more what more should one have to say violent cool and unpredictable
3415;It is one of my favorite movies.
3416;The screenwriters did a brilliant job taking the viewer on a roller.
3417;A guy movie with lots of action with an outstanding cast.
3418;Leo, Matt, and Jack are a great mix in this movie.
3419;The ending was the most powerful part of the movie
3420;The Departed is one of those films you need to savor.
3421;Full of rich performances, attention to detail and lots of plot, you will probably need to see this new Scorcese film at least twice to be able to fully appreciate everything.
3422;One of the best films of the year.Young Colin Sullivan lives in a poor, rough neighborhood in Boston.
3423;As he struggles with life in this neighborhood, he notices a gangster by the name of Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) who seems to have the world in his pocket.
3424;They are running a secret operation and no one but Queenan and Dignam will know Billy's true identity.
3425;Soon, each is working their way up through the individual organizations, providing information to help the other side.
3426;"Will each learn about the other?Directed by Martin Scorcese and featuring a wealth of actors working at the top of their craft, ""The Departed"" is a great film."
3427;The original film featured a number of long cat and mouse chase sequences which are hinted at here, but are largely forgone in favor of more character development, creating a richer, more interesting film.
3428;any time you have a film and Mark Wahlberg is the fourth lead, taking a co. starring role, you know you are in for at least an interesting experience.
3429;This film has an incredible cast.
3430;But there have been many flops with incredible casts.
3431;The difference here is that each and every one of the leads could be in a film about their character alone and that film would be very good.
3432;But combining all four has created one of the best films of 2006.
3433;nicholson is outstanding and back in fine form, playing the over confident, powerful, sociopath gangster Frank Costello.
3434;There is a beautiful scene in which Costello enters a bar from a backroom to address his crew who is hanging out.
3435;DiCaprio does a great job as well.
3436;Most of the time, this type of role would be played with a poker face, nothing getting through the rough exterior of the character, but DiCaprio plays the role with more emotion, making him more human.
3437;In other words, every emotion crosses his face.
3438;In a way, this makes sense.
3439;"As Costello's plant, he walks a fine line throughout
3440;Throughout the film, Damon brings a believable sense of nervousness to the character, making him always appear on edge.
3441;damon also does a great job of turning on the charm as Colin.
3442;these are easily two of the best performances from Damon and DiCaprio.
3443;mark Wahlberg is memorable as Dingman, the foot soldier for Sheen's Queenan.
3444;The first meeting between he and Costigan is especially memorable, as Dingman does little but swear.
3445;martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin and Ray Winstone round out this great cast.
3446;Easily, one of the greatest filmmakers ever, he has had some missteps in his career, but overall, you can count on a Scorcese film to grab you by the throat and take you for a ride.
3447;just about every great director can be easily associated with one or two frequent collaborators who have helped them achieve their status.
3448;This is frequently one of the best things about Scorcese's films, the editing.
3449;It always successfully helps to evoke the mood of the feeling.
3450;In """"Raging Bull"""", they created a unique style for each fight."""
3451;"In ""The Departed"", they create a frenzied, visceral experience, cutting back and forth between the two characters and their lives."
3452;Yet, Scorcese and Schoonmaker always keep us in the thick of things.
3453;Throughout, there are brief glimpses of crime scene photos, murders, etc., providing us with a brief, but memorable visual match to what the characters are talking about.
3454;"Showing these things for such a brief period is akin to the experience of reading a book
3455;But this is a small complaint in a film this good.
3456;Goodfellas is an acknowledged classic and I don't think """"The Departed"""" has had enough time to rise to that level."""
3457;Perhaps, with time and upon reflection, this new Scorcese film will earn a place alongside the other.
3458;Goodfellas told a story about one group.
3459;"I'm pretty sure ""The Departed"" will be remembered as one of Scorcese's best, but that comes with time."
3460;No film is a true classic when it is first released.
3461;And see how they hold up.
3462;This is honestly one of my very favorite movies of all time.
3463;The script is phenomenal, the performances outstanding, the direction impeccable, and hey.
3464;but it's fun, brilliant, and one of those movies that leaves you so unsatisfied at the end that you're perfectly okay with it.
3465;I'd totally recommend it to everyone.
3466;It's rare to view a modern movie which deserves five stars.
3467;This is that kind of movie.
3468;Everything about this movie was excellent.
3469;"Yes, Martin Scorsese has made gangster/mob movies before, and yes ""The Departed"" does ride the coattails of ""GoodFellas (Two."
3470;getting to see a Director in his element as he guides an excellent cast through some of their best work.
3471;the three principles here, DiCaprio, Damon and Nicholson, all give committed performances, and this may be DiCaprio's finest film.
3472;The smaller roles punch through (Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin, who has the best lines) to make everyone in the cast come across convincingly.
3473;While the film has serious continuity errors for those of you that like to pick for that stuff, the pace is so rapid.
3474;"There is plenty of suspense to be had in ""The Departed,"" and it was worth Scorsese's finally nabbing that Oscar."
3475;Excellent cast and a great mob movie!!
3476;The Departed is one of my top 20 movies of all time.
3477;With such an all star cast and a splendid director, what's not to love?
3478;Very good movie with lots of surprises you wll not go to sleep watching this one !
3479;each man finds himself deeply consumed by his double life, gathering information about the plans and counter.
3480;Of course, William Monahan's script gives the director plenty to work with.
3481;The answer to that question is that the movie ultimately lands just behind all of those classics I mentioned in the great one's filmography.
3482;taking away from an otherwise flawless film.
3483;she should have sparks with someone.
3484;his performance in the mob pic is better then that of BD.
3485;the film succeeds though thanks to everything else.
3486;Yes, Jack Nicholson is playing a character he's done a thousand times before, but gosh darn it it works here.
3487;And the ending is just spectacular.
3488;This is a must see movie for sure.
3489;The best that can be said of this eyesore is that it features an all.
3490;"star cast committed to violence and is one step up from the 2005 academy winner ""Crash."""
3491;One viewing is more than enough.
3492;You'll appreciate it more that way.
3493;Damon's character has high aspirations, and a very successful relationship with a police psychiatrist (Vera Farmiga).
3494;DiCaprio's character is gradually drawn deeper and deeper into the blackness of the criminal underworld, and begins to fear that he can never return.
3495;Leonardo DiCaprio plays a far more attractive role in a far more attractive fashion, that of a tormented man with nothing to lose who has no choice but to continue fighting the good fight until his end.
3496;DiCaprio, who could easily have been dismissed as just another pretty face when he first appeared in the late 90s, has come a long way since, exercising his dramatic chops over the years until finally peaking with his marvelously sympathetic performance in THE DEPARTED.
3497;Aging Martin Sheen, surprisingly tough Alan Baldwin, and impressively rude Mark Wahlberg head up a fine supporting cast.
3498;Jack Nicholson's performance is a career highlight, ranking alongside his knockout performances in classics like ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST and THE SHINING.
3499;martin Scorsese is as much of a star as any of those on.
3500;He's at his finest in this film, using some new techniques while producing some moments that are pure Scorsese (namely a few sudden outbursts of violence a la GOODFELLAS or CASINO, and a breathtaking scene in which a character is thrown to his death from a rooftop).
3501;toss in a great soundtrack (including a delightful theme by the Boston.
3502;THE DEPARTED is a masterpiece of filmmaking, and a whopping achievement for Scorsese, as well as his best picture since GOODFELLAS way back in '90.
3503;For the moviegoer, however, that's cause for joy, because as Martin Scorsese has proved again and again, those films without happy endings are often the finest.
3504;Best gangster movie since Casino.
3505;I love that it's the Irish mob this time.
3506;It's tough in Boston and this movie shows a slice of true life.
3507;I love the Hong Kong original movie better, especially the ending.
3508;But in growing up, I came to acquire a taste for these things and eventually learned to like them a lot.
3509;With that said, upon this subsequent viewing of the The Departed I definitely like it a lot more than I did initially.
3510;paced story with its kinetic score and attention to subtlety in both narrative and characters for the viewer to fill in on their own (along with 50 minutes less in running time).
3511;On the other hand, Scorsese does a wonderful job in making his version more of a character drama with the elements of the aforementioned on the side and set on the mean streets of South Boston that works very well, though tends to feel a bit cumbersome and underwhelming at times (like the love triangle, the lack of empathy for Nicholson's character compared to his Chinese counterpart, or the overuse of record label songs as opposed to an actual score).
3512;Both are excellent movies in their own right that should cater to either side of the spectrum depending your preference for flash and execution vs. grit and progression, though I'd personally lean a little more towards the original just because it doesn't feel as tedious in certain aspects.
3513;As you see his silhouette walking through with a white background behind him, it instantly set the tone for me and made for some lovely foreshadowing to the film's narrative about the deceit, secrets, and hiding to occur throughout.
3514;world depth into the picture making the audience know full well that the grit and dirtiness are there.
3515;Overall image detail has a great deal of clarity and sharpness with near.
3516;amused at how well I could understand those Bostonian accents (still had to turn the subtitles on, just to be safe).
3517;For the most part, it's a fairly music.
3518;Separation is handled perfectly between all of these elements with a lot of the music staying in the front and guns and punches panning between the fronts and rears, most notably during a raid scene towards the end.
3519;The only downside to this audio presentation is the lack of any potent LFEs, which obviously don't have very many moments to shine aside from some bass in the music, but it's still a fine movie without them.
3520;The Whitey Bulger segment adds an intriguing sense of realism.
3521;I'm still a bit new to the gangster genre myself and found this to be a pretty cool piece of information.
3522;It wasn't overly factual, but still managed to tell me enough that I could relate it to the movie and give it a more objective view.
3523;"The Scorsese ""portfolio"" segment was a very great watch."
3524;Like I said, I'm just now getting into him as a director and it fascinates me to learn about his history growing up, the kinds of films he made, and a lot of the similarities and influences those works share with one another.
3525;4.5The Departed is a fine adaptation of Infernal Affairs that really works for western audiences.
3526;And who better to portray this than a man who's certainly becoming one of my favorite directors in Martin Scorsese.
3527;I was shocked that he never won an Oscar prior to this film, but I'm glad to see he got his just due at some point.
3528;With excellent video and audio specs and a good amount of informative extras, The Departed comes highly recommended.
3529;Visually, on my system, the blacks are black and the colors are brilliant.
3530;I highly recommend this movie for blu.
3531;Great movie with great actors!
3532;One of the best movies I've seen in a long long time!!
3533;This twisting, turning tale blazes its exciting, funny, with a brutal path.
3534;I love action movies with a twist.
3535;The original was a tight 100.
3536;minute thriller with a great pulp premise elevated by good writing and fine performances by two directors with barely a fraction of Scorsese's talent.
3537;aside from the Scorsese on Scorsese documentary, extras are surprisingly light for a two disc set .
3538;This one is so interesting, I actually wanted to see more.
3539;The characters, the dialogue, the music, the action, the drama, this movie has EVERYTHING!!
3540;As incredible as the scenario may be, it's definitely plausible.
3541;i recommend this movie to those who like the mob stories and gritty crime dramas that really draw you in and tell a story you won't forget!!!
3542;We're so ashamed of you!
3543;"winning ""The Departed"" really better than they are, but it is safe to say that ""The Departed,"" good as it is, is not Scorsese' best."
3544;"having said that, I must say I found myself drawn to the violent world of ""The Departed."""
3545;"He is right and Scorsese knows it, infusing another theme instead, with frequent reference to the themes of faith and betrayal in the characters with hazy morality in ""The Departed,"" the themes to which I couldn't help being attracted."
3546;The film is filled with anti.
3547;If you value your time and money, spend it on a film that portrays the value of honest police work and the futility of gangsterism.
3548;This was a pretty good movie but I wasn't wowed by it or anything.
3549;This is just an amazing movie.
3550;For absolute Scorsese fans, it's an unforgettable experience beyond all superlatives: superbly written, brilliantly directed, wonderfully acted, cleverly edited.
3551;Beautiful music, powerful dialogs, sex, drug and blood, we're so close to perfection.
3552;As far as the high def formats go this is an excellent looking movie.
3553;the Legendary Martin Scorsese unveils yet another masterpiece, a Boston PD and irish mafia drama starring Leonardo DeCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson and Mark Walhberg, they all deliver oscar worthy terrific performances, Nicholson is always the greatest, just terrific, One of Scorsese's and Nicholson's best movies.
3554;Mark Wahlberg is pretty good, and I can't stand him as an actor.
3555;This is probably his best role to date.
3556;Ray Winstone in the highlight and the best thing about the movie other than the story which was a remake of a Japanese movie Infernal Affairs.
3557;When people ask me wha my favorite movie is I always say it's more about directors rather that actual titles.
3558;This year he graces the movie going public with yet another exciting and all out fun shoot'em up twisted up masterpiece in 'The Departed'How can you say anything bad about this movie?
3559;The cast couldn't get any better, this is the best cast Scorcesse put together since Goodfellas.
3560;Matt Damon Boston native extrodiare and Leo DiCaprio put on probably their best performances of their careers and each were in two very well put together movies on their own this same year.
3561;The great Jack never lets you down with his intimidating on screen presence and his signature wit and classic quotables.
3562;Probably the best performace in this movie was Mark Walberg.
3563;He was a power house and really knew how to do that Bostonian accent to a tee.
3564;all and all if you are a fan of great mob movies its your movie.
3565;If you are into artsy films that can possibly win best picture of the year.
3566;This is one of those movies you will probably watch a million times and finally credit was given where credit was sorely due.
3567;If you like gory action films, this is for you.
3568;This movie literally kept me on the edge of my seat when I first saw it in the theater.
3569;It has everything you could possibly ever want in a film: Superb acting, drama, action, violence, suspense, and a great unsuspecting ending.
3570;There is no question this deserved its Oscar win.
3571;This was perhaps not the best Scorsese, but even average Scorsese is great.
3572;Suspense and acting and directing superb.
3573;The plot was somewhat lame, and deriative, but what the heck, it keep me interested the whole way through, and meted out justice, a kind of happy ending, in a surprising and satisfying way.
3574;This was a good mob movie.
3575;Good acting by most of the cast (though Jack Nicholson was a bit too over).
3576;Conclusion : Oscar for best director OK, but best movie, best adapted screenplay and best editing is too much flattery.
3577;Lots of action, twist and surprises.
3578;Jack plays his role well and is very effective as a mob boss.
3579;"Featuring stunningly original performances from Jack Nicholson, Leo DiCaprio, Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg, the film is based on the Asian film, ""Infernal Affairs""."
3580;The Departed blasts along with curious twists and turns that will keep you guessing and exclaiming your excitement for 2 and a half hours.
3581;And it feels like 90 minutes, this film is so good.
3582;The music, both soundtrack (Stones and other great songs) and score, rocks.
3583;One of the best cop films I have seen in years.
3584;Great work from director Scorsese with standout performances by DeCaprio (Billy) and Damon (Colin Sullivan).
3585;In summary: a fine script with performances to match.
3586;I really enjoyed this movie, the acting was great and for a moment you forget they are actors and felt you are watching real lives.
3587;Love the all star cast: Nicholson, Damon, DiCaprio, de Niro, Sheen, Baldwin, etc.
3588;I had such high hopes for this movie.
3589;If you like being depressed at the end of your movie experience, and really not getting anything remotely out of them, this is for you!
3590;I bought the departed because it's an amazing classic and the special edition 2 disc was well with it, and it shipped fast too.
3591;matt Damon and Leo DiCaprio put on stellar performances in this movie and it has you wondering when it will all go down, an you are left with questions at the end still.
3592;jack Nicholson, Martin Sheen, and Mark Wahlberg co star and do excellent as well.
3593;Great action, great dialouge, great characters, great music.
3594;top notccchhh job on the boston accents.
3595;When I first saw this movie, The Departed, I thought that it was one of the great movies I've ever seen.
3596;It was directed very well with great actors and great story.
3597;"The movie ""The Departed"" is a thriller/suspense/drama/action feature film with a superior cast and directed by Martin Scorcese, no less ."
3598;talk about a seriously intense and engaging movie!
3599;stop thrills, tension, constant action and interactions with the various characters, intriguing plots and sub.
3600;around wonderful movie worth watching many times over.
3601;Everyone in the movie did a superb job and the movie was very enjoyable.
3602;The Departed is definitely one of the best movies of 2006 and deserves all the accolades that it has received since last fall.
3603;It's certainly Martin Scorsese's best film since Casino.
3604;wrenching fear, and unexpected betrayal that comes to anyone involved in this type of business for any length of time.
3605;He's smart, charming, and utterly ruthless in how he conducts business.
3606;making arrests and to advance up the ladder inside the department.
3607;While this is happening, Billy Costigan (played by the underrated Leonardo DiCaprio) strives to rise above his Boston heritage and to make it into the Massachusetts State Police.

3609;mouth game as they each seek to discover the identity of the other.
3610;The hunt for the mole's identity is intense.
3611;This is the heart of the story and what keeps you glued to the edge of your seat.
3612;the Departed is a tight, fast.
3613;driven film about the life of crime, betrayal, and the emotional drain it has on everyone involved.
3614;The performances by all the main actors are superb and deserving of an Academy Award, especially Leonardo DiCaprio.
3615;He captures the emotional turmoil and fear that can literally overwhelm an undercover agent, who teeters on the edge life and death each and everyday.
3616;Martin Scorsese once again proves that when it comes to crime drama, he's one of the top directors working in the business today.
3617;This man finally deserves to win his Oscar for Best Director.
3618;minute documentary with Martin Scorsese discussing his life and his most famous films, another 25.
3619;The Departed is so good that I'm going to watch it again in just a few minutes.
3620;Congratulations to Marty Scorsese for winning Best Director for The Departed!!!!
3621;"Martin Scorsese's ""The Departed"" captures all the best elements of the original film ""Infernal Affairs"" and works traditional Scorsese themes and material into the film making it very much his own and every bit the equal to the Chinese film."
3622;"Featuring outstanding performances all around perhaps this film will finally earn Scorsese the Oscar for Best Director that he deserved for ""Raging Bull"" over twenty years ago."
3623;it's a brilliantly constructed game of cat and mouse with each playing the respective role at one point in time.
3624;"Filled with brilliant visuals that echo the themes of the script adapted by William Monahan (""Kingdom of Heaven"")from the script by Siu Fai Mak and Felix Chong the film manages to stay true to the elements that worked best in the Chinese film while incorporating elements unique to ""The Departed""."
3625;DiCaprio and Damon give complex, compelling performances as opposite sides of the same coin.
3626;The entire cast gives stellar performances but I'd like to note tree actors in particularly who do the most with their limited roles.
3627;robert DeNiro and Gerard McSorley)and Mark Whalberg all three give intense performances and inhabit their characters fully.
3628;"Special note should also be made of actor Ray Winstone (""The Proposition"", ""King Arthur"" and ""Cold Mountain"") who gives a nice edgy performance as Mr. French."
3629;Scorsese uses every minute to allow the actors to build their characters or for brilliant set pieces.
3630;How Scorsese won for this and not Goodfellas is beyond me.
3631;I Like Martin Scorcese as well as anyone, but The Departed is far from his best.
3632;great premise, but except for the very interesting and perhaps even ground breaking use of cell phones in making a thriller, the execution was sadly lacking.
3633;Yes, the first part of the movie covers a lot of ground, and it has to.
3634;The rest of the cast was pretty good though.
3635;Who knows?As bad as this movie was, it was still watchable, until the ending.
3636;I was enjoying the movie for the most part until the end.
3637;Leonardo is solid, and Nicholson is hard to resist.
3638;Just watch the competent filmmaking, the action, the bullets flying and don't ask for too much more.
3639;maybe because he was so unique and so Italian.
3640;That's what we'll remember in the future as we watch his classic films.
3641;Jack Nickolson, Matt Damon and Leonardo Dicaprio are excellent.
3642;I can watch it many more times.
3643;The best spy (CIA) movie I have ever seen.
3644;I heard so many good things about this movie so I figured it had to be good, so I bought it.
3645;"My daughter said to me the other day ""You really must see The Departed."""
3646;Wouldnt you think she was saying it is a great movie????
3647;The craziest ending ever on a par with Alington Road that makes excellent acting pale into nothing.
3648;This is definitely the best medium on which to watch this movie, I've compared to the blu.
3649;excellent performances with perhaps one or two too many carries.
3650;but the departed is so good, i just didn't care about the complicated wrap.
3651;"scorsese was never an ""in your face"" director, but in ""The Departed"" he reaches a new level of disappearing altogether."
3652;As with many great artists (think Fred Astaire or Miles Davis), Scorsese's work gets simpler as he matures.
3653;"And ""The Departed"" is perhaps the most brilliantly edited film I've seen, its layered complexity complementing the acting and direction's simplicity."
3654;"controversial element of ""The Departed"" is Jack Nicholson's performance, which, good though it is, seems rather more ""emphatic"" (shall we say) than the other performances."
3655;My feeling is that he's a very good actor, but not in the top rank, because he seems incapable of disappearing into a role.
3656;"We're always aware we're watching ""Jack"" ."
3657;it's simply the sort of performance Scorsese wanted, and he cast Nicholson to get it.
3658;"The Departed is one of Scorsese's best films, but I wouldn't rank it above ""GoodFellas"" or ""King of Comedy""."
3659;"If you're in the mood for a double feature, the last scene makes a great seque into ""Ratatouille""."
3660;The Departed is a consistently engaging crime thriller from director Martin Scorsese.
3661;Wahlberg gives the best performance of his career and nobody can play the sinister bad guy like Jack Nicholson.
3662;martin Scorsese is the master of the crime drama, as he as proved time and time again.
3663;Aviator was an interesting bio pic.
3664;while Gangs was defined by an Oscar worthy performance from Daniel Day Lewis.
3665;The Departed however is a return to form.
3666;Its main strength lies in the story telling, Throughout the film and especially in relation to the Damon and Dicaprio characters.
3667;It constantly keeps you guessing as any great Drama should.
3668;What can I say, Martin Scorsese did a great job with this film.
3669;Its been quite a few years since a great mob movie has come out, and this one is up their, likely to fall with the classics some day.
3670;Although the film is 2 1/2 hours long, I found that it flowed well and the plot kept me interested.
3671;I'll have to watch it a couple of more times to see how the film arived at the circle ending it did, and some of the hints are subtle.
3672;A great role for Jack Nicholson, Leonardo Decaprio was actually good in this film, and I agree with the Oscar nomination for this one, although blood diamond was decent as well.
3673;I love Jack Nicholson as a dirty old criminal.
3674;This is a great date night movie with the man in your life.
3675;It won the Academy Award for Best Picture, and Scorcese finally got Best Director for what he himself said was.
3676;He covers familiar ground with this film, and its been done with greater effect in movies like Mean Streets and Goodfellas.
3677;"The performances are quite good, especially DiCaprio, who tackles a ""tough guy"" role for once."
3678;top in several scenes and is channeling Jack Torrance from The Shining.
3679;Damon is quite good, as is Mark Wahlberg and Alec Baldwin.
3680;The film certainly keeps your attention for 2 hours or so, and there are some shocking scenes of violence that ramp up the excitement, but Marty has made better films.
3681;The movie is a very good crime drama.
3682;Sometimes it is even funny.
3683;He is a tremendous actor.
3684;The movie script is excellent.
3685;How this won an Oscar is beyond me, but the Oscars have been going down for years as many of the actual best pictures are never even nominated, let alone win.
3686;visceral and unforgiving without getting in the way of the central plot or themes.
3687;The acting is simply superb, and every member of the cast deserves recognition.
3688;The pacing is near perfect, and there are several twists at the end.
3689;watchable even when you know what's coming.
3690;a gritty crime drama that uncovers new territory for its genre while still delivering a solid film.
3691;Not as good as the original Infernal Affairs but it still delivers.
3692;The story is pretty much the same with a few differences!
3693;The acting is grade A and the blu ray delivers spectacular sound and detail!!!
3694;Fans of the film will be pleased.
3695;Matt Damon gives and excellent performance.
3696;I've learned a simple lesson in life that this movie confirms.
3697;"Martin Scorcese has done better films like ""After Hours"", ""Casino"" and ""The Aviator""."
3698;At least those films were original and quirky.
3699;"Leo DiCaprio does an okay job
3700;He kind of drifts in and out of his accent.
3701;despite Nicholson's performance, though, I really enjoyed the movie.
3702;It is worth watching for the interplay between Wahlberg and Damon alone .
3703;I got the feeling that Mark has always wanted to pop Matt and he gets to do it big.
3704;Unlike some people, I loved the ending.
3705;And, we really do say """"Sorry for your troubles"""" at wakes!"""
3706;Lots of nice touches like that made this an authentic enough portrayal of Boston.
3707;"I subtracted one star for Nicholson, but overall I think Scorcese did a ""wicked good"" job."
