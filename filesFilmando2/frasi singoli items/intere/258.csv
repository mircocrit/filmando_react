1;In spite of that, I still liked the film and would be prepared to watch it again.
2;When a mysterious artifact is salvaged from the bottom of the ocean and opened the creatures once again roam the Earth.
3;It actually has a nice score to it.
4;No part of the acting is believable and it seemed as if the actors had to improvise at times.
5;"The movie was fool of great moments and memorable lines like ""don't be insane!"""
6;Now I own it and so at least I watched it.
7;A beat is that twsit that happens in a movie.
8;There is a scene where the camera gets inside opf a gun so we can see a bullet fly out and hit its target.
9;"The difference is with Woo the device is used to place importance on the fight scene and create suspense, in ""Alone in the Dark"" it tries to make the movie look ""important""."
10;Reid plays Aline Cedrae an intelligent scientist.
11;The dialogue and acting reminds us of those 1940, 1950 sci.
12;It's not only her it's everyone!
13;how a movie like this got made is beyond me.
14;"fi movies, hey, that's fine watch ""Alien"", which is kind of what the ""creatures"" look like."
15;"Christian Slater is a good actor and the movie seemed to have a halfway decent budget for the creatures, which were animated fairly well, but other than those two points this movie didn't even qualify for a ""direct to Sci."
16;There was no fun in this movie at all.
17;Time to watch Madagascar and cheer myself up.
18;I can forgive a lot, but I do demand that the plot hold together in the most basic ways.
19;Slater and Dorf are both very talented performers, so I had expected better.
20;Good actors in not so good movie.
21;I recently saw this movie and I enjoyed it.
22;Its a great action movie.
23;Plus, im a huge metal fan.
24;And God do I love watching his movies.
25;Well honestly that's what it deserves.
26;But boy is it fun to watch it fail!Since the fun is in the details the plot description shall be brief.
27;Better explain it within about 2 minutes of meeting him.
28;He just sort of stands there and lets things happen to him.
29;Now onto the fun part.
30;How exciting would that be?
31;last thing about the action scene I promise.
32;eerie music should go over eerie scenes.
33;She makes Denise Richards look believable as the brilliant scientific type.
34;There is no originality in this film.
35;best scene in the film: it starts as a 'dramatic' scene in Bureau 713's headquarters when suddenly a bad romance song comes on and we switch to Christian Slater where out of the blue a girl comes in and decides to have a sex scene.
36;Worse, he shoots them from a distance.
37;there is a real inconsistency in the monster's portrayal.
38;Anyone who's ever seen a movie trailer before knows exactly what's gonna happen.
39;What is surprising is that they never explain why.
40;She's established as a good person so why help him?
41;The chemistry between Reid and Slater was also fantastic.
42;A lot of reviews credit the awkwardness to the actors.
43;The first scene with Tara Reid should be viewed in every writing class taught from now until the end of time.
44;handed revealing of background information in that conversation set the tone for the rest of the movie.
45;I hope to God they written by someone associated with the studio or the actors.
46;Uwe Boll has tried to make a putrid pile of a film and he has truly done the job.
47;A little piece of you will die if you watch it.
48;Viewed: 12/07Rate: 112/07: After reading much about Uwe Boll, I finally managed to see one of his films.
49;It's best to leave it.
50;see the end of the sandworm scene!)
51;Any ways the minute someone starts one we should all get together and sign it.
52;of course, to be successful the movie must be entertaining and ALONE IN THE DARK is!
53;Edward's love interest, a museum caretaker played by Tara Reid, is his constant companion, providing a steady supply of eye candy for the male audience.
54;Tara treats us to a competent performance without overacting.
55;The two stars complement each other with a believable chemistry that comes to a head during a sexual encounter that is at once intimate and sensual.
56;The special effects are top tier while the gore factor is over the top.
57;I do know that some of the best actors and actresses in the business (including an Oscar winner) are clamoring to be involved in an Uwe Boll project.
58;He's going to make a lot of money and entertain a lot of people along the way.
59;I expect big things from this filmmaker and I anticipate he will deliver and, am looking forward to BLOODRAYNE, HUNTER THE RECKONING, FAR CRY, the list goes on .
60;I will tell you what happened.
61;i say bring back the Christian Slater we all knew and loved in Heathers, when he went around killing people while having sex with Winona Ryder, and looked cool while doing it.
62;This director also did BloodRayne.
63;honestly though the action scenes and the special features were what made this movie enjoyable to me.
64;I liked Christian Slater's character and his delimma but I would have liked more info on the who, the what and the why.
65;This is not necessarily anything new, but has gotten more popular with the success of the Tomb Raider and Resident Evil films.
66;The story opens with a decent action sequence, but the movie makes little sense.
67;You can make a bad movie with those elements, but making that movie _boring_ on top of that is quite an achievement.
68;it keeps things moving and takes advantage, on a B. movie level, of its key story elements.
69;christian Slater does his best with the material he was given, and even Tara Reid manages to gamely get through her part.
70;The editor has to take some blame as well.
71;Uwe Boll, the man who subjected the greater movie.
72;"going public to the cinematic abortion that was ""House of the Dead,"" has done it again!"
73;"Sitting through the first twenty minutes of ""Alone In The Dark"" is tantamount to having the hairs on your arm pulled out one at a time."
74;So when I saw the whole movie I was amazed since this movie has alot of action and decent special effects.
75;I wasnt all that good.
76;nothing was good about the movie.
77;I like Christian Slater, and the rest the cast is decent in their parts.
78;The creatures are downright good.
79;Weapons that fire light bullets kind of cool.
80;"One of the guys tells Stephan Dorff ""come on she's gone"" and you can actually see her get up, thinking the scene is over."
81;Uwe Boll is simply amazing.
82;one best appreciated from afar, granted, but still . . . ).
83;The reviewers here on Amazon are right to compare it with Ed Wood and Roger Corman.
84;How this played in theatres or got three box office stars like, Christian Slater, Tara Reid, and Stephen Dorf I'll never know or care.
85;I'm telling you this for your own benefit.
86;Whatever you choose, i'm sure it will go towards something a little more worthwhile than this.
87;But I has alot of elements of movies like itself that I do like about it.
88;Okay, so I received this movie for free, and with little knowledge of its storyline or any other pre.
89;For its genre, I think its a decently entertaining production.
90;Will I watch it again, probably as I know others who will likely enjoy it.
91;You may be pleasantly surprised.
92;bUT Alone in the Dark actually looked semi cool, disregarding how it abuses the game.
93;The only real entertainment you can get out of Alone in the Dark comes from reading its scathing reviews, many of which are hilarious in their no.
94;It's amazing to me that Tara Reid and Uwe Boll still manage to find work in the business.
95;In the movie, he's a veritable action adventure hero with a mysterious childhood and a former career as an agent for a top secret paranormal investigation unit called Bureau 713.
96;I love Christian Slater and thought I was in for a real treat.
97;There was a small story hole here and there, but for the most part I was able to figure out the entire story.
98;The Action scenes are absolutely awesome, some of the best ever seen in movies.
99;This is a good action movie, which is why it failed in the box office, because it was advertised as a horror.
100;So yeah, if you look at the reviews, look at the ones with at least a paragraph of review, not just a sentence b/c those are probably the ones that have been made up.
101;The actors are phoning it in, there's a lot of dragging, the special effects barely rise above those from Sci.
102;"We had a great time making fun of it, guessing what was going to happen next (which wasn't hard
I:400;103;of course, the real treat is when Tara Reid tries to be a bright scientist.
I:400;104;Can't somebody please stop this guy before he turns his eyes to World of Warcraft and ruins the greatest game of all time?
I:400;105;I laughed, I cried, it moved me.
I:400;106;At least Boll wasn't directly responsible for the script, which includes a sex scene for the sake of having one, and such delightfully illogical scenes as Aline reading ancient scripts by memory.
I:400;107;And Tara Reid manages a bit of hilarity as a scientist .
I:400;108;Boll lets us know she's brilliant, because she wears glasses.
I:400;109;Alone in the Dark deserves to stay alone.
I:400;110;I bought this for one cent new, (yes) and 2.98 shipping, and for that price I'm happy with what I got.
I:400;111;What I like is the generous amount of special features like behind the scenes shorts, and several music videos some from bands that I like, such as Kataklysm, In Flames, Nightwish, etc.
I:400;112;Yes, it wasn't that great, but it did follow the game pretty good, I have the game.
I:400;113;I thought Slater and Reid did fine and also Dorff, although a little underused.
I:400;114;This movie rehashed every other monsters.
I:400;115;This is one of my all time favorite action films.
I:400;116;The story is great, the characters are likable, and the action scenes are really cool and entertaining.
I:400;117;This is a super fun action film and I totally recommend it.
I:400;118;Christian Slater stars as Edward Carnby in """"Alone in the Dark"""", an extension to the story of the """"Alone in the Dark"""" series of video games."""
119;special features include a behind.
120;i recommend this to fans of the video game series, though I suppose it would be an all right film to invite a few friends around and make fun of, if you're into that sort of thing.
121;He's like some kind of cinematic cockroach.
122;I know, he finances them all himself through some kind of bizarre German fund, but even so, his ability to keep making movies despite absolute, complete failure is one of the great mysteries of the universe.
123;I really enjoyed the Alone in the Dark series of games.
124;The writing, the acting, the music, the CG effects, the editing.
125;he is a fairly good actor who can do alot of the physical stuff required for this movie in a convincing manner.
126;It's not even a good bad movie, nor is it fun to watch.
127;The underlying premiss is interesting, in a six.
128;Two worlds exist, one good, one evil.
129;Now, take everything that's ever been neat, exciting, fun, and interesting from an Indiana Jones.
130;laughed so hard at this dog.
131;The dialogue was ok good in parts and some times a little long.
132;the gun fire alone and seeing people get killed makes you happy watch this movie.
133;Making it a pretty good action movie over all.
134;There was great shots at the mines with the creatures attacking the government troops and taking down the helicopters that rocked.
135;Over all I enjoy the movie its best action movie that came out in 2005.
136;"The video game, ""Alone In The Dark 5"" will be released in early 2006."
137;"to make this film more fun to watch, in ""Special Features"", go to the ""Trivia Track""."
138;"You can turn this feature ""On"" for interesting facts while you watch the film."
139;***Alone in the Dark II will be released on video in 2009.
140;In addition the a washed up slater and the always brilliant Tara Reid (joking) there was a special laughable appearence by Stephen Dorff.
141;Hudgens had something to do with forming a top.
142;Alone in the Dark is to film what Chernobyl is to nuclear power.
143;"With ""Feardotcom"" and ""Alone in the Dark"" on his resume, he'll be lucky to qualify for welfare."
144;I feel that I should go see this film in the theater.
145;"Watch ""Alone in the Dark"" at your own peril."
146;I honestly can't think of a single good thing to say about it.
147;The fact that an actress was supposed to be dead and sat up before they cut to the next scene was just hilarious.
148;or Black Roses, but considering this movie has 3 name actors, and a fair bit of decent CGI work in it, I though I would at least be able to take it seriously.
149;The good news is you will get your wish.
150;What I do remember about old Atari games was their rudimentary graphics and storylines.
151;so in order to fill in the blanks, writers Elan Mastai, Michael Roesch, and Peter Scheerer borrow and steal from other films.
152;video rail and an actress best known for flashing paparazzi.
153;but when he got it and watched it he liked it, and so did i. dont believe the hype its a great b. movie adventure.
154;Stephen Dorff has one one emotion in this movie, the same one he relies on in every movie: intense.
155;He scowls and looks intense.
156;powered weaponry, which she uses masterfully without any training whatsoever.
157;dimensional, and we never really care what happens to them.
158;Boll is a blight to the cinema and video game industries respectively.
159;the film is unintentionally a laugh riot, and prime for riffing.
160;This film makes Ed Wood's look like Scorsase's!
161;The music and the sound effects overrode the actors speaking most of the time.
162;carnby's past, the Abkane, and the natural human fear of the dark all combine to make this movie.
163;there is much talk on the disk about making the film true to the games.
164;If you like action, monsters, suspense and a good thriller, then you will probably like this film.
165;That's all I can really say.
166;for years, I'd dream that a movie based off the games would some day come about.
167;That dream has now been shattered by Uwe Boll.
168;All I can say is, even the poor 4th Alone in the Dark is far superior to the movie.
169;If you truly want to see an incredible work of art, play the original games.
170;Never mind the small things like, covering the walls so we can at least keep the illusion that we are in some secret base.
171;my brother's movie also had a story that was interesting.
172;The point is that there was a story there that you could follow and even enjoy.
173;He can use his 2 kids this time around.
174;If you're the kinda person who likes to watch bad movies to laugh at them then I actually recommend you check this out.
175;I'll give it two stars because while I do love it for how unintentionally funny it is, I think I should be rating it more on how good of an actual movie it is and from a pure film.
176;I like Christian slater and he hasnt done anythng good since TRUE ROMANCE, and I dont think this will change his losing streak.
177;And like me if you are a huge Daniel Cudmore fan (Colossus form X. men 2) this movie is worth seeing he has more lines and he is always with Stephan Dorff's chracter.
178;I bought this film on Amazon for about $3 and it was worth it.
179;The film does receive a 2.3 on IMDB and is ranked in their Bottom 100 movies.
180;I don't think Alone in the Dark is one of the worst horror films ever made but that is just my opinion, I respect everybody else's opinion on this film.
181;The music may be the strongest factor in preventing a four.
182;i hope for those who haven't seen this film, better keep it that way.
183;Went to see this movie, ALL excited to actually meet Edward and Aline on the big screen.
184;The BEST and most loyal to the game part of the movie were the WORDS spoken in the beginning!!!
185;Do NOT see this if you love the game.
186;if you've never played it, then you'll be entertained.
187;That's really all I can say.
188;mart and it will make for a great Saturday night of laughs.
189;Alone in the Dark is the best Ed Wood movie never made.
190;It's a film so mind.
191;"(""Being afraid of the dark is what keeps most of us alive!"")"
192;The rest of his lines are delivered in sporadic voice.
193;a team of soldiers blows up a hallway full of priceless artwork.
194;Seriously, Boll appears to have one goal here, and that's convincing Tim Burton to film a biopic about him.
195;Alone in the Dark is the director's second movie based on a video game, and he has at least two more on the way.
196;If nothing else, it's worth the bargain.
197;I will enumerate the best parts for you:1.
198;"The ending music by Nightwish, ""I Wish I Had An Angel."""
199;The female characters, while attractive, must have studied at the Ed Wood School of Acting.
200;I laughed all throughout the movie, because it was that bad.
201;that makes worth a couple of dollars anyway.
202;as another poster said, I watched it to be entertained and I was, very much so.
203;altho I am sure many here will find that funny.
204;I received it in short order.
205;and I have alway's had a great experience with the seller's at Amazon.
206;All I have 2 say is I knew this movie was a joke when they made Tara Reid an anthropologist, Haaaaaaaaaa!
207;since they both made good chemistry and the action is fun too watch.
208;Excellent effects, sets, and backgrounds.
209;At least the action in A. i. t. d is exciting and its easy to follow why it happens.
210;There's several parts in the movie with dialogue, meaning that the main character tells you what he knows and what he's thinking several times, including at the end.
211;"Nightwish's ""Wish I Had an Angel"" and Deathstar's ""Synthetic Generation."""
212;Alone in the Dark contains 6 music videos .
213;i enjoyed watching the movie.
214;And I liked this movie.
215;realistic features was amazing, and the story progressed at a perfect rate.
216;Anyone who stops and thinks for just a second can pick up the symbolism for terror and such in our world today.
217;i don't STRONGLY recommend this movie, but it sure deserves more of a chance than what my fellow reviewers are saying it does.
218;The plot as well as the film footage must have been swept up from the film editing floor by the janitor and spliced together.
219;to put it to you clearly they look like the mutated children of Godzilla.
220;I bought this as a gift for someone and it was just what they wanted.
221;christian Slater delivers a great performance as Edward Carnby in ALONE IN THE DARK an Adaptation of a popular video game series I recommend this movie to Slater fans and fans of Films that have Creepy and Violent Monsters in it plus a story that involves shadowy government agencies with evil agendas.
222;For some strange reason I thought Uwe Boll had directed some decent stuff.
223;Chrisitian Slater is an excellent actor.
224;He does a fine job here as well.
225;It will work much better for you.
226;I got it as a free bonus, but still feel ripped off!
227;The cover and story looked good on the box.
228;The only saving grace is that I can take it and trade it at the game store.
229;Dorff, who is a great actor though you'd never know it by the movies he's in, hasn't been in anything remotely good since the original Blade in 1998.
230;Now, the greatest mystery of his past is about to become the most dangerous case he has ever faced.
231;According to the character of Carnby, fear of the dark is what keeps us alive.
232;"Anything interesting, frightening, or even simply ""cool"" about them?"
233;fi action flick just made me laugh.
234;Just trust the ratings on this one.
235;It works well for what it was supposed to do: provide 96 minutes of escapism.
236;the flashbacks illustrate adequately all connections with the past, and they are very intriguing in themselves.
237;The close combat scenes are fascinating and perfectly choreographed.
238;"The creatures are quite impressive and disquieting if not absolutely original
I:400;239;The sets are completely satisfactory and perfectly complement the action.
I:400;240;The special effects are flawless and well worth being replayed several times.
I:400;241;All of which is highly laudable when one remembers that it was a very modest budget movie.
I:400;242;The ending might leave some a little bewildered or unsatisfied, but it has its own logic and I respect that.
I:400;243;This is a movie that some time from now I will watch again with pleasure.
I:400;244;the extras or special features are numerous and very interesting.
I:400;245;I certainly do not regret having bought Alone in the Dark and not having let myself be deterred by the negative criticism"
246;The synopsis of this movie is good but that is where it ends.
247;By the end I just wanted to monsters to eat them all and be done with it.
248;Alone in the Dark may be the absolute best movie I have ever seen in my life.
249;The plot was riveting and kept me on the edge of my chair through every moment.
250;Tara Reid may be the best actress to ever grace the screen.
251;What made her acting so spectacular was that the part fit her PERFECTLY.
252;Anyone in their right mind could see that her breathtaking performance should have swept the awards.
253;I actually heard how bad this movie was, and was warned from watching it, but curiosity got the better of me, so I picked it up anyway and decided to see why people ditched this movie so much.
254;Ok so he can see creatures in the dark, but so can Tara Reid when it attacks her in the museum!
255;I thought `House of the Dead' was bad, but this really tops it!
256;Saw this movie on the sci fi channel and thought I would like to have it.
257;It came fast in good shape
258;Wanted to see it because some music on it was by a group I really like.
259;It was not played until the closing, but the movie got my attention fast.
260;After seeing it, I can understand.
261;There's a nice shot at the beginning that shows a bullet being fired from inside the gun, which I thought was neat.
262;"And the way the monsters in this movie die is sort of cool to look at
I:400;263;headed sex toy then maybe I might be able to forgive her for how she treats her character.
I:400;264;At one point, a team breaks through glass, but the glass breaks before they touch it.
I:400;265;One minute it is like the Matrix, then it is Alien, then it is something else.
I:400;266;Alone in the Dark (Uwe Boll, 2005)Will someone in Hollywood eventually realize that Uwe Boll is utterly incapable of making a good movie?
I:400;267;powered cast this time round would help Boll at least make a decent action film.
I:400;268;I was pretty hyped about an ALONE IN THE DARK film since it was a pretty cool PC game.
I:400;269;I have only seen one positive review for this film and I bet that guy fell asleep also.
I:400;270;this is the first movie Ive seen where the reviews are more entertaining than the movie.
I:400;271;If you don't nitpick about tiny little things that you normally wouldn't notice in a movie (like the FBI's timely arrivals) then it's a good movie.
I:400;272;It's a little more action than it is horror, and worth a watch.
I:400;273;The title is exactly how I found myself.
I:400;274;Plenty of Gore, plenty of thoughtful plot, plenty of detailed work in the film.
I:400;275;This all basically means that some will hate it, some will enjoy it.
I:400;276;The BEHIND THE SCENES and the FX featurettes are very good, and the commentary by Uwe Boll is very good: Tells a lot about the movie as well as the making of the movie.
I:400;277;It's a very good and open commentary about the film.
I:400;278;Like I originally said, it is not for everyone, but some will enjoy it.
I:400;279;ok this dude isnt to good at directing/casting.
I:400;280;Regardless of what people might say when they hear of """"another Uwe Boll movie"""", this movie is in fact fun and entertaining to watch."""
281;Stephen Dorff in particular plays a really cool character!The director is an enigmatic and compassionate man who loves the games on which most of his films are based.
282;"Personally, I believe ""Postal"" is hilarious, and is the equal to ""Team America: World Police""."
283;"simply because ""Blood Rayne"" wasn't one of the best movies by Boll, everyone feels the right to critisize him."
284;This is a film that you must see.
285;I'm giving this movie five stars just because of the miraculous nature that this film was ever allowed to be created, and proof that movie investors are the dumbest people alive.
286;Who in their right mind thought this would be a good movie?
287;"Now, I've seen some bad movies in my lifetime, but this one just takes the cake (right up there with Bram Stoker's ""The Mummy"")."
288;Uwe Boll's perception of an ideal horror/action flick is putrid!For starters, the film makes absolutely no sense at all (the best you'll get out of a storyline is the three minute read intro) and constantly jumps from scene to scene (one moment, Slater's on a plane, the next he's involved in a Taxi Cab chase/collision).
289;scenes footage) the film's producers actually thought they were crafting something phenomenal when developing the movie.
290;faded career back on the map) for he was very passionate about taking part in AITD.
291;"AITD was one of the very first videogame series (if not the first) to construct ""Survivor Horror,"" and this is the way it's rewarded."
292;I like the idea of the movie and I like Christian Slater.
293;since this movie had alot of action that looked hot.
294;Uwe Boll is turning into a modern day Ed Wood.
295;While Resident Evil is often credited with it, the truth is that Alone in the Dark came first.
296;Resident Evil just made it popular.
297;interesting plot involving H. p. Lovecraft themes (which the game is based from) and turns into a bullets flying miasma.
298;I think this is very telling of Uwe Boll as a director and what he believes of his intended audience.
299;Giving it a one star is being generous.
300;On the positive side, when the text finishes, you could save yourself about 90 minutes of anguish and walk out.
301;The love scene, if you could call it one (I don't remember any love scenes in the game)has successfully set lovemaking back 1000 years.
302;Congratulations Uwe Boll with continuing the fine tradition of B. movie making.
303;Everything is perfect: the dialogue, the cast, cinematography, music, sound effects, wow.
304;fueled film party of epic proportions.
305;"I like Christian Slater
I:400;306;ridden, things we've seen in so many other films.
I:400;307;Folks, by watching this movie, you are living an important moment of history.
I:400;308;If you think Uwe Boll's """"House of the Dead"""" was bad, you are in for a huge surprise."""
309;the directors cut of alone in the dark is even better than its original cut.
310;the movie has a great story and even better creatures.
311;That part I can really love.
312;christian Slater is a treasure hunting hero who wants to be an Indiana Jones.
313;so stunt works including the brief car chase and kung.
314;and the action sequences are utterly thrill.
315;Three principle characters are played by Christian Slater, Tara Reid, and Stephen Dorff.
316;What can I say except that this is the best video game adaptation ever made into film.
317;Slater gives on of the best performances that I've seen him give in a rather mediocre career lately probably because Stephen Dorff gives him a excellent foil alot of the time as his rival in the vaunted Agency 713, where Carnby used to work at during the games.
318;And the direction of this film is done by another great European director Uwe Boll, so you won't be disappointed by the effects, cinematography, or the tightly scripted impressively suspenseful and fast paced storyline.
319;If you liked the Resident Evil Movies even a stitch you will love these well beyond.
320;The cast is good but I'm sure he'll find a way to butcher it still.
321;Christian Slater may well be working as a people greeter for Wal.
322;He does the best he can with the script he was given, but still it is a movie based on a video game that should have stayed a video game.
323;Ed must find a way to stay alive and keep the creatures from behind the door from coming into our world.
324;When I saw most of the parts from this movie it was pretty good.
325;And is an improvement from Uwe Boll's other movies.
326;(not bootleg) By the price, I was happy.
327;Ofcourse hannibal and platoon are great and when I decided to watch this movie, I read the reviews.
328;acting: The actress (forgot her name)that performed as the main character's girlfriend sucks.
329;As if I didn't think Uwe Boll could do any worse than his craptastic version of House of the Dead, he goes and brings us this movie.
330;If you'd like a comparison, The Blair Witch Project is Oscar winning material compared to this.
