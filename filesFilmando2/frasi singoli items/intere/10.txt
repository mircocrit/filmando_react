I:17943;1;This was a solid movie, but way too long.
I:17943;2;The IMAX shots are breath taking.
I:17943;3;One of the biggest perks here .
I:17943;4;a great movie, great BD transfer, well worth every penny.
I:17943;5;When a comic book action movie gets tipsy between the fortunes of good and evil, and one forgets the good guys are supposed to prevail, then you have a real comic adventure.
I:17943;6;For these reasons, `The Dark Knight' is destined to become (along with `Spiderman 2') one of the greatest comic adventures ever made.
I:17943;7;excellent performances, an intelligent script, and tension to match the riveting action, render `Batman Begins,' the acclaimed start.
I:17943;8;be client of millionaire Bruce Wayne has them tracing it to an accountant from Hong Kong.
I:17943;9;Madness is like gravity, he chortles.
I:17943;10;A hero with a face (at least for now) Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is Gotham's District Attorney, a stalwart force to bring criminals to justice, jeopardizing his own life for the city's welfare.
I:17943;11;At Dent's side is fellow attorney and love interest, Rachel (Maggie Gyllenhaal), one with a keen sense of every situation and a steely resolve.
I:17943;12;heath Ledger is simply masterful.
I:17943;13;Nicholson gave us great entertainment, giving us both the Joker's malice and laughter.
I:17943;14;His romp was admirable, but I have to give Ledger the edge.
I:17943;15;His laughter and jokes only send chills up one's spine.
I:17943;16;Indicative of his talent, it's at those knifepoint moments when the Joker shares three separate stories about his indelible smile that Ledger's magic works the best.
I:17943;17;christian Bale is slightly eclipsed, but he still brings a quiet, brooding appearance as he did previously.
I:17943;18;faceted actor, he does good and evil with tremendous skill.
I:17943;19;Gyllenhaal, who's had her fine moments, really delivers a truly round and believable Rachel as if someone forgot to tell her the movie had comic strip origins.
I:17943;20;Michael Caine is a perfect Alfred, and Morgan Freeman plays Lucius Fox, the second Alfred of Wayne enterprises without seeming extraneous.
I:17943;21;If they tightened up and hadn't gotten so ponderously philosophical near the end, they could have made a perfect film.
I:17943;22;(Although I'm from nearby Chicago, they transform the Windy City nicely enough to make us forget where the mayhem is actually transpiring.)
I:17943;23;I dont have to tell you how great this movie is, but it arrived on time and i was satisfied
I:17943;24;Without a doubt, this was the best of the Batman Trilogy movies.
I:17943;25;The only similarity to the Batman movies of a couple of decades ago is that the Joker, played by the late Heath Ledger, still steals the show (there is a reason he was awarded a posthumous Oscar!)
I:17943;26;ray disc is amazing, although there are numerous dark scenes (the actual footage, not just the theme of the movie).
I:17943;27;The better your television, the more you will enjoy the film.
I:17943;28;This is one for the ages.
I:17943;29;It may have been Ledgers last role but boy it was a great one.
I:17943;30;I went to see this movie expecting something that was dark and entertaining.
I:17943;31;I love a good psychopathic character.
I:17943;32;But that is what makes the character very amusing.
I:17943;33;i recommend this movie to anyone who loves the Joker or is a fan of Batman.
I:17943;34;The acting, special effects, and entertainment are great.
I:17943;35;So if you are looking for a great action movie, then this is the one to pick.
I:17943;36;great movie, great shipping speed.
I:17943;37;Movie was excellent, i actually saw this 4 times in theaters lol.
I:17943;38;But other than that, i consider this one of the best batman movies ever made.
I:17943;39;I think that this movie had some great points.
I:17943;40;That this world is corrupted you cant trust anyone most of the time.
I:17943;41;Heath played an amazing Joker.
I:17943;42;I bought this just to add to my personal movie collection.
I:17943;43;Great price but digital copy didn't work.
I:17943;44;"I had no desire to watch a Batman film, because I have never been a ""comic geek,"" and my favorite movies are realistic ones, such as the Bourne series."
I:17943;45;"What I did not realize was that Batman is no ""superhero"" like Spiderman (which I don't care for), but just a man trying to make a change in his world, and that The Dark Knight was one of the most realistic movies I would ever lay eyes on.You might think, ""Well of course you loved it."
I:17943;46;But, unlike many of my peers, I was also able to catch, and appreciate (if not the very first time I watched it) the extremely powerful moral themes woven into the engaging storyline.
I:17943;47;the Dark Knight has managed to do something simply incredible.
I:17943;48;It first took on the (not necessary, but profitable) task of reinventing the Batman story, which had been turned into nothing short of a joke in previous films (filled with excessively cheesy content and flamboyant, fruity characters) and putting a majorly serious, mature spin on it.
I:17943;49;While doing this, it took the opportunity to use this particular basis (Batman, as opposed to any other fictional character) to present the insightful viewer with an intricate look at the ideas of good vs. evil.
I:17943;50;"The theme of good vs. evil is literally the oldest in the book (especially if ""the book"" is ""The Bible"") but so many films, books, games, etc. have taken it to be ""kill all the bad guys and good wins, and of course good will always triumph."""
I:17943;51;Well that is just about the opposite of how real life works.
I:17943;52;"Things done in the name of ""good"" can easily be seen as horrifying even by those on the side of ""good."""
I:17943;53;what's more, on top of reinventing Batman and portraying the timeless clash of ideals, The Dark Knight presents character development like none other, which is credit to the excellent acting of its stars.
I:17943;54;I realize that each person has their own preferred style, but the Dark Knight really resonated with me.
I:17943;55;"The shots employed, the dark gritty style, the subtle but powerful musical score, the sleek and modern settings (such as Bruce Wayne's desirable penthouse and underground ""batcave""), and the lighting all contribute to an extremely intense, glorious picture."
I:17943;56;one last notable detail is that The Dark Knight has managed to be phenomenal AND wildly successful AND critically acclaimed, all without employing sex or profanity.
I:17943;57;strings sex, which explains the success of this formula.
I:17943;58;Watch it if you prefer deep, contemplative films to action flicks.
I:17943;59;Watch it if you prefer action flicks to deep, contemplative films.
I:17943;60;Watch it if you appreciate good film.
I:17943;61;Watch it if you appreciate good acting.
I:17943;62;"It is well on the way to being a cultural phenomenon, and while films like Avatar have surpassed it in ticket sales, no film in my recent recollection does a better job of personifying the true, scarred face of ""striving for justice."""
I:17943;63;I never knew I could love a superhero movie so much.
I:17943;64;What made this film great was its action, story, and great characters with came together to form a near.
I:17943;65;mUSIC: The music is fantastic and goes great with the already near.
I:17943;66;Heath Ledger really does a great job at portraying Joker as a complete psychopath who you'd be terrified to come across.
I:17943;67;This is one of the best action films I've seen in quite some time.
I:17943;68;eNTERTAINMENT: This film has a lot of unexpected scenes, even things occurred that I would have never been able to predict.
I:17943;69;This film is a roller coaster ride of plot twists, adrenaline.
I:17943;70;rushing action scenes, and it's even suspenseful, all the way to the bizarre ending.
I:17943;71;This is without a doubt one of the best films I've seen in quite some time, and is a definite must.
I:17943;72;see for any movie buffs.
I:17943;73;tHE GOOD: Great story, great actors, great action, surprisingly disturbing, little focus on relationship problems, and it's an overall kickass movie.
I:17943;74;If you play it on Surround Sound, it will be really, really, really good.
I:17943;75;The Chase Scene on the BD Format is very nice.
I:17943;76;the BD also includes a Digital Copy, so not only will you have 2 BDs, but you'll have one on your computer.
I:17943;77;i highly recommend this to anybody looking for a great high.
I:17943;78;The older Batman films were full of action but still were entertaining and were loved by many.
I:17943;79;The comic books I read when I was a kid were exciting, but not evil and dark.
I:17943;80;Amazon did have a great price on this so at least we did not thankfully spend much.
I:17943;81;I love Christian Bale, and he is great as the Dark Knight.
I:17943;82;"(um, hot hot hot) This movie is awesome, special effects and cinematography are amazing, acting is top notch, it is one of the greatest in the ""Batman"" franchise and that's all that really needs to be said."
I:17943;83;This movie starts right up and is very entertaining for a hour and a half.
I:17943;84;While there are weird flaws in this film, it is still the best comic book adaptation to date.
I:17943;85;There is all the action and great dialogue you could want.
I:17943;86;It's new and it works perfectly.
I:17943;87;The 1st disc, the feature, is great.
I:17943;88;It is some of Christopher Nolan's finest work and features excellent acting.
I:17943;89;I have never seen a more believable joker, and as a Batman fangirl, I can tell you that this is the best Batman movie I have ever seen.
I:17943;90;Heath Ledger does an eerily wonderful job playing The Joker, and the story is portrayed meticulously.
I:17943;91;packed superhero thriller with an intricate plot and fast.
I:17943;92;paced scenes, Batman is right on the money.
I:17943;93;Heath Ledger is absolutely brilliant as The Joker, he is muchly missed but he's not the one who steals this movie, Aaron Eckhart is a pleasant surprise!
I:17943;94;Long have we waited for a Batman movie this good.
I:17943;95;It seems that the perfect Batman movie .
I:17943;96;that which gets the legend right, does it intelligently and is still a complete thrill ride .
I:17943;97;Yeah, that movie was good.
I:17943;98;"And then there was ""Batman Returns"" and if you like your Batman dark, well, this was a cup of black coffee."
I:17943;99;"When Christoper Nolan brought Batman back to the big screen in 2005 with the critically acclaimed (hey, Ebert liked it) ""Batman Begins,"" it was a breath of fresh air."
I:17943;100;notch supporting cast, we were finally given a Batman film with class.
I:17943;101;Enter 2008 and here we are with what is easily the most hyped movie of the year, and surely, the best action/adventure/comic.
I:17943;102;and with so many great actors at hand, it's amazing how he just steals each and every scene he is a part of.
I:17943;103;Eckhart handles the neccessary duality of the character with ease and keeps you sympathetic to his cause even through the final scenes.
I:17943;104;Ledger gives the performance it's all, and it shows.
I:17943;105;He is mesmerizing in each scene and steals the show, whether he was trying to or not.
I:17943;106;as a director returning to the franchise, Christopher Nolan seems just as confident and consistent as he did with the first film.
I:17943;107;"The Dark Knight keeps in tone and consistency with ""Begins"" and the anticipation we felt at the end of that film is delivered upon ten."
I:17943;108;The action scenes themselves are a blast, and quite the step.
I:17943;109;As mature as this film may be, there are definitely some jollies to be derived from seeing The Joker handle a bazooka inside a moving vehicle.
I:17943;110;Nolan handles the action sequences with ease, and they are just as memorable as the characters themselves.
I:17943;111;There are plenty of reviews that go into it, and as someone who purposely avoided any details of this film's plot as possible prior to it's release, I found that not having too much previous knowledge made it a much more enjoyable movie.
I:17943;112;To say the least, this is the definitive Batman film.
I:17943;113;but the film is so good, I kept hoping against hope that it wouldn't end.
I:17943;114;There is simply so much going on in this film, so not only is the length a good thing, but it also warrants repeat viewings.
I:17943;115;It was a fantastic movie for Batman, the Joker and the D. a., and Batman's ill.
I:17943;116;It's for mature audiences but certainly exciting.
I:17943;117;with the digital copy and special editions.
I:17943;118;its awesome, and a great value!
I:17943;119;Better than all the batman movies before it.
I:17943;120;The story line keeps you interested even though it's a two.
I:17943;121;The actors were great, but Heath Ledger really shined the best.
I:17943;122;He was incredible as The Joker and had he lived, he would have been one of the best actors of our time.
I:17943;123;In a rare case when the sequel is better than its predecessor, The Dark Knight is also the best movie out of the entire Batman franchise, which is no easy feat.
I:17943;124;The acting in this film is superb, the cast incredibly well picked out, the script is intelligent, and the art direction is breathtaking.
I:17943;125;cinematically, the special effects, stunts, cinematography, and all visual and audio effects are exceptional and far more stunning than one would ever hope for from a summer blockbuster.
I:17943;126;The Dark Knight is an incredibly intense film, with multiple complex storylines, several villains, several heroes, and no mistakes of any kind.
I:17943;127;It's truly an artistic achievement.
I:17943;128;this movies deserves to be seen on a huge screen and experienced over and over again.
I:17943;129;"This movie is very inspiring, the character of the Joker is interesting in the fact that he makes a valid point about the society of Gotham City and how they will hate Batman unless he ""dies a hero"", referencing Harvey Dent."
I:17943;130;Very interesting to see the clash of morals between Batman and the Joker.
I:17943;131;It is true, Batman Begins was a good movie.
I:17943;132;Like in Batman 1989 some scenes really did shine.
I:17943;133;"Jack Nicolsons Joker was pretty good with his, ""Wait'll they get a load of me"" stuff."
I:17943;134;And I harken back to that 1989 Joker who hung from a high perch and laughed while battling Batman.
I:17943;135;The action scenes dissapointed on most levels.
I:17943;136;ledger did put a worthwhile, unique spin on the Joker.
I:17943;137;I yearned for more of his charm.
I:17943;138;Its hard on a film when a superior actor alone carries it.
I:17943;139;"When we hear, ""Enter the Riddler"" the lines will form again."
I:17943;140;Top movie of all time.
I:17943;141;The Batman movie that's been 70 years in the making!
I:17943;142;Takes nearly every aspect of the Batman mythology and, in continuation with the perfect set.
I:17943;143;The supporting cast is superb.
I:17943;144;Morgan Freeman is as classy and witty as ever.
I:17943;145;Great featurettes, very interesting, but for the magnitude of this film, its release, and Heath alone, it's skimpy at best.
I:17943;146;I even ordered a second one just to keep sealed.
I:17943;147;By far this is the best movie of 2008 hands down, the acting alone from Christian Bale and the Late Heath Ledger is amazing and they could not have displayed a better performance.
I:17943;148;This is my favorite Batman movie thus far next to the original with Adam West.
I:17943;149;Better than some in the Batman series, not as good as others.
I:17943;150;If you did not see this movie YOU ARE MISSING a good action movie.
I:17943;151;One of the best features of this movie is the music.
I:17943;152;It creates the mood, suspense, excitement.
I:17943;153;the scenes are pretty clean.
I:17943;154;Overall a very clean, blood free movie.
I:17943;155;This movie was great nuff said, Heath Ledgers joker is by far the best, go see it and stop reading u wont regret it!
I:17943;156;for give us in his last movie the incredible and spectacular performance of heath ledger!!!
I:17943;157;god bless you heath for give us this last movie!!
I:17943;158;and enjoy this new adventure between the gates of heaven
I:17943;159;This movie is so excellent.
I:17943;160;If you are a comic book fan you can really appreciate Ledger's performance of the Joker.
I:17943;161;The movie overall is shot great.
I:17943;162;Its a pitty comic movies are never up for best movie awards.
I:17943;163;This one is certainly better than those other nominees.
I:17943;164;Some parts have good action, and they feel like a video game.
I:17943;165;Bolt had a better story as was much more fun, now that should have won best picture.
I:17943;166;The Dark Knight is considered by many movie critics, fans, etc. as the ultimate movie of the Batman Series, partly due to: a) a fantastic crew of actors (including the late Heath Ledger in his outstandig performance as the Joker, perfomance that perhaps will grant him an Academy Award), and b) a well directed movie (Chris Nolan) with action, suspense, drama secuences that kept movie fans hook up at the screen.
I:17943;167;Simply the best Batman Movie you have ever senn!Yes!
I:17943;168;Heath Ledger makes a great role here!
I:17943;169;, but also Christian Bale is the best Batman Actor Ever.
I:17943;170;"michael Cane and Morgan Freeman are also very good ones!It is a 2.5 hours movie, but you don't ""feel"" the time, it has so much action, so good that the movie seems to be short!Watch it with a good sound system!"
I:17943;171;The Sound of this movie is the best of its kind!
I:17943;172;It carries deeper thematic messages that are sure to make this movie a favorite among intellectuals as well as action fans or comic book fans.
I:17943;173;Christopher Nolan's directing is solid as ever, and his staccato directing style perfectly fits the chaos of the film's events.
I:17943;174;Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker (the antagonist) will continue to stand out in the minds of movie reviewers as the best acting of the decade (and as a winner of the Best Supporting Actor academy award).
I:17943;175;"I would recommend this movie to anyone except those who insist on a happy ending
I:17943;176;the film is not bad, and Ledger is absolutely mesmerizing in his Joker incarnation.
I:17943;177;See, to them, you're just a freak.
I:17943;178;In fact, Harvey Dent's story is about as enjoyable as rubbing sandpaper on your forehead.
I:17943;179;I got exactly what I wanted
I:17943;180;I rate this in my top 5 movies of all time and I usually don't enjoy superhero movies as much.
I:17943;181;Once I heard everyone talking about how good this movie was I knew I had to see it.
I:17943;182;Even though the economy is terrible I still payed to see this movie twice that's how good this movie is.
I:17943;183;To me it was a tragedy that he died but for some reason he died making the best movie he ever made.
I:17943;184;There is just nonstop action here in this movie right from the beginning which I always didn't get that feel in the other batman movies.
I:17943;185;It was so surprising and you didn't know what was going to happen next.
I:17943;186;A great story line and I know the director is going to have a hard time topping this movie.
I:17943;187;Amazon has done an amazing job of competing with Netflix and other video sharing bodies because they offer top.
I:17943;188;The best super hero movie ever and a great action/drama in its own right.
I:17943;189;I did love the first 3 batman movies.
I:17943;190;highly recommended to have it at home in any format.
I:17943;191;The package was received on time and great shape 100% recommended
I:17943;192;the dark knight is a classic legendary movie.
I:17943;193;the ending was very surprising,.
I:17943;194;iv watched this movie 8 times now and im planning to watch it again this weekend.
I:17943;195;he really plays with the spirit of gothom city, and as he says at the end he wants the peoples souls.
I:17943;196;def go and watch it.
I:17943;197;This is by far the Best BATMAN Movie made, BATMAN Begins was also great but I love the Joker character in The Dark Night.
I:17943;198;Christopher Nolan has done a wonderful job with the Batman franchise and I believe this is the best of the trilogy.
I:17943;199;Me, I bought this because I loved the movie and this set cost as much as the regular two.
I:17943;200;"love this movie my best of all the batman i grew up watching adam west the joker was wonderful sad because of his death but i rate the movie 5 starsplease bring more movies like these could not move out of my chair while i was watching Batman"" almaN.Y."
I:17943;201;They were very artsy and DARK and just great.
I:17943;202;Theres a difference between a COP film and a Super Hero film.
I:17943;203;But I will say this, Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker was incredible!!!
I:17943;204;A much more believable (and terrifying) rendition of the madman than the more cartoon.y versions from previous Batman flicks.
I:17943;205;He has a secret identity known to less than a handful of people.
I:17943;206;He sought to expose the truth of Batman's identity, of love and dilemmas (was Rachel Dawes more worth saving than Harvey Dent?)
I:17943;207;and, most critically, the truth of what it takes for society to police itself.
I:17943;208;That is the price and the ground of peace .
I:17943;209;an exceptional act which takes the form of violence.
I:17943;210;perfect candidate for Prime Minister?
I:17943;211;perfect example of a political whiner?
I:17943;212;The Joker uses anarchy to expose the lies the people tell themselves (of goodness, of heroes, etc.).
I:17943;213;so people can continue believing in the illusory motifs of hope and justice.
I:17943;214;I love this movie and found it for a great price.
I:17943;215;I saw it twice with my fiancee and we placed a pre.
I:17943;216;ray the day it was available for pre.
I:17943;217;One of the best movie you will see.
I:17943;218;It was a great relief to have this in my hands so soon before the holidays!
I:17943;219;Showed up in wonderful condition!
I:17943;220;Thank you for your great service!
I:17943;221;My brother and I both received this from our mom on Christmas.
I:17943;222;I really hope he gets the Oscar.
I:17943;223;I'm incredibly impressed that they decided upon the alternating aspect ratio of 1:78 for the IMAX stuff (shot in 1:33, but you don't lose much) and 2:35 for the 35mm stuff.
I:17943;224;I'm beyond impressed with this disc.
I:17943;225;what we have in the end is a superhero movie that's uneasy about superheros, a protagonist who may or may not be leading us into the abyss, an agent of chaos whose kind will always be with us whether we like it or not, and a parable about the various forms of blowback that beget such agents in the first place and lead to the destruction of those we love.
I:17943;226;as always bat man is amazing, and this movie was full of action.
I:17943;227;a must have for any comic loving movie lover
I:17943;228;Batman is really put to the test with his nemesis the Joker, it is played exceptionally well and is really well done
I:17943;229;Bale is phenomenal only complaint is that i liked katie holmes better as rachel!
I:17943;230;But worth the money at the price of 2 dollars.
I:17943;231;It's a wonderful stocking stuffer or small gift for an acquaintance.
I:17943;232;I really liked the Dark Night.
I:17943;233;The story is incredible, the acting is amazing, the special effects and action are great.
I:17943;234;Heath Ledger is AMAZING as are the other actors!
I:17943;235;The movie itself is great.
I:17943;236;This is a great way to get a modern classic for very cheap.
I:17943;237;This is a great movie and the best out of the three in Nolan's Trilogy in my opinion.
I:17943;238;The joker is done in a way that has never been seen before and he sets the bar very high throughout the movie.
I:17943;239;Well worth the cost especially if your a batman fan.
I:17943;240;Overall this product is well enjoyed!
I:17943;241;Was very active and kept the suspense on going with great outcome and fun interactive emotional involvement.
I:17943;242;The Dark Knight is the best superhero movie yet made.
I:17943;243;Heath Ledger gave the best performance ever in a superhero movie, his performance deserved the Oscar.
I:17943;244;Was the movie Oscar worthy as a whole?
I:17943;245;good acting, lots of action in this move but I preferred the first few movies over this one.
I:17943;246;It may be true to the comic book but diverges from the Adam West TV series.
I:17943;247;I'm not a fan of Hollywood producing too many of these, but nonetheless it's a masterpiece.
I:17943;248;The extra features are good to give insight.
I:17943;249;The Dark Knight is the best selling Blu.
I:17943;250;ray title in history and will become the best selling 2008 title overall this week.
I:17943;251;the Dark Knight marks the first time that a major feature film has been shot in part using IMAX cameras, marking a revolutionary integration of film formats.
I:17943;252;ray disc takes advantage of the marriage of IMAX and 35mm formats by using the hybrid master to replicate the unique theatrical experience.
I:17943;253;The IMAX scenes are also included on the 2.
I:17943;254;As Bruce Wayne, he's faceless.
I:17943;255;Nor is he the best performance.
I:17943;256;Gary Oldman's role is most convincing.'
I:17943;257;time list is more a tribute to its obsessed fanbase than its merits.
I:17943;258;pick, but I won't), it is one of the best comic.
I:17943;259;It's about time they got a DC comic right.
I:17943;260;I would have loved more movies with Joker and Batman.
I:17943;261;full performance by heath ledger.
I:17943;262;I have been a fan of Batman since I first saw it on Cartoons and was the first Book I bought.
I:17943;263;Christian Bale is one of the best Batman actors to play the role.
I:17943;264;5 of 5 stars for the comic book based Batman movie, The Dark Knight.
I:17943;265;the movie is richly made and grandly photographed with really great action scenes and special effects.
I:17943;266;I highly recommend this movie, just be prepared for a long experience.
I:17943;267;ray is packed with interesting behind the scenes materials.
I:17943;268;one of the greatest batman films of all time.
I:17943;269;every one of the actors protrayed their character greatly and what a great performance by the late Heath Ledger.
I:17943;270;This is the best Batman ever.
I:17943;271;Much better than Batman Begins.
I:17943;272;It is more in line with the comic book.
I:17943;273;He really got into the role that he became the Joker.
I:17943;274;With the exception of a few, the same actors also reprise their roles from the last picture, with the main exception of Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel Dawes, who is easily as beguiling as Katie Holmes last time in the same role.
I:17943;275;the support cast are excellent, particularly Gary Oldman, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman, and Bale is suitably beefed but suave and almost arrogant as our hero.
I:17943;276;on the positive side the movie has plenty of action, good CGI and bone crunching fight scenes and gadgets, which should please the most ardent fan of the movie genre.
I:17943;277;It also has enough depth to keep the more discerning viewers interest.
I:17943;278;those minor complaints aside, this IS a good movie, and worth seeing for Ledgers performance alone, a powerhouse performance of character acting that will I'm sure be a strong, but strange epitaph to a tragic loss of talent.
I:17943;279;Anyone who knows me, knows how big of a Batman fan I am.
I:17943;280;"And even though this may sound biased, I can honestly say that ""The Dark Knight"" is the best comic book adaptation movie ever made!"
I:17943;281;If anything, it keeps the audience involved with each and every character all the while keeping them on the edge of their seats, as there are plenty of nailbiting sequences in this film.
I:17943;282;And, much to Bruce's chagrin, Rachel's love interest is no other than the compassionate, idealistic District Attorney Harvey Dent (with a performance by Aaron Eckhart that may be the best of his career to date).
I:17943;283;And the complicated relationship between Gordon, Dent and Batman (another comic book staple) is explored with great writing (again, taking a cue from their relationship inBatman: The Long Halloween.
I:17943;284;Of course, being The Joker, he does have a few funny one.
I:17943;285;And the complex relationship between The Joker and Batman .
I:17943;286;that is a constant in the comics even to this day is added into the movie, which I was delighted about.
I:17943;287;Also, Ledger's Joker is always one step ahead of Gotham's police and Batman that he makes the perfect formidable foe that us fans know from the comics.
I:17943;288;"gary Oldman is also back as Lieutenant Gordon, Michael Caine as Alfred, and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox
I:17943;289;The performances are all excellent but the true accolades should go to the writers, brothers Jonathan and Christopher Nolan, and David S. Goyer.
I:17943;290;They wrote what a Batman movie should be and perfectly showcase why all of us fans love Batman in the first place: the dark, gritty realism peppered with hope and lots of cool gadgets.
I:17943;291;The fact that director Christopher Nolan has finally brought the cool respect that was lost by his predecessors back to the Batman franchise is superb!
I:17943;292;Whether you're a comic book fan or not, I would recommend this movie!
I:17943;293;It's probably the best summer blockbuster I've seen in years!
I:17943;294;Just go see it and soak in the experience for yourself.
I:17943;295;This movie is by far the best all time comic movie ever.
I:17943;296;Both Christian Bale and Heath Ledger put on a performance that was exceptional.
I:17943;297;Some still are but for this movie I got a great price and its a great movie.
I:17943;298;Watched this with my family on New Year's Eve and have to say this is my favorite one so far.
I:17943;299;The Good Things*Excellent action scenes.
I:17943;300;"Much bigger and more impressive than the previous film ""Batman Begins."""
I:17943;301;*Still an excellent filming style.
I:17943;302;*Production design is excellent still (the BatPod was cool).
I:17943;303;A vast number of twists and turns puts the audience on a truly turbulent emotional roller.
I:17943;304;*Characters continue to shine with complexity.
I:17943;305;The film explores more intruiging issues with Batman's character.
I:17943;306;face) was a good serious character too.
I:17943;307;*Good music (but not as memorable as the last film).
I:17943;308;(but this could all be a good set.
I:17943;309;It's more intense this way, but also much bleaker.
I:17943;310;*Choppy filming/editing still makes the fight scenes a little hard to see (but it's stylish and intense, too).
I:17943;311;"it's darker, bigger, more intense, more exciting, and more ambitious than ""Batman Begins."""
I:17943;312;But it still retains the same style and characterizations of the previous film, and therefore, is still a deep, complex, moving film.
I:17943;313;But it is still high.
I:17943;314;Everybody who enjoyed the last film (and Batman fans in general) should enjoy this one too.
I:17943;315;The price was a very good deal.
I:17943;316;The Dark Knight is a fantastic movie.
I:17943;317;as with Batman Begins, The Dark Knight removes much of the over the top Comic Book type theatrics and melodrama of the previous incarnation of Batman theatrical endeavors for a more thoughtful look at the psychology behind the characters.
I:17943;318;Motive is key to much of the story and while there is your requisite action and jaw droping special effects, the true grace and elegance of this movie is the eloquence and subtlty of the story, dialogue and intereactions of the characters.
I:17943;319;Nothing is as it appears, there are fine shades of grey and there are definitely points of exploration into the depths of the human psyche and what drives it.
I:17943;320;the Dark Knight has all of the elements of the greatest of movies and stories and it will not disappoint.
I:17943;321;This is the ultimate in think persons action movies and with the great story.
I:17943;322;telling and visual canvas, is, in my opinion, one of the greatest movies of all time.
I:17943;323;I've she the movie before and I love the Acton in it.
I:17943;324;Plus it's my sons favorite movie!
I:17943;325;"The most intriguing one for me was one devoted solely to Hans Zimmer's composition of ""Why So Serious?"""
I:17943;326;The other is an entertaining look more at the physical aspects of the costumes and the Batpod and such.
I:17943;327;face's injury, and the complexities that would have been involved in getting the CG eye to move with Eckhart's real eye flawlessly.
I:17943;328;I love this movie with my heart, the joker is the best.
I:17943;329;i can see this movie so many times!
I:17943;330;It stood as a touchstone moment in the history of comics and cinema, and few believed that it would ever be usurped from its pedestal as the greatest comic book movie ever made.
I:17943;331;What Christopher Nolan has done here is taken one of the biggest cultural icons of the modern age and improved upon it.
I:17943;332;The film was successful and well.
I:17943;333;received, so WB gave the go.
I:17943;334;for starters, TDK is the perfect Batman movie.
I:17943;335;fans of the world (myself included).
I:17943;336;second, superhero movie fans will love it.
I:17943;337;tHE DARK KNIGHT is the masterpiece that it is is because, to be perfectly frank, it's not a superhero movie.
I:17943;338;This is simply a wonderful film that draws it characters and inspiration from the world of comics.
I:17943;339;"Not only is ""TDK"" one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, but a double whammy of recent outspoken independence regarding the film really clinched it for me."
I:17943;340;Just as the Bat inevitably becomes the one holding the bag, so does the rest of the movie become the heroic piece of work that it should be in the collective eyes of the public.
I:17943;341;This movie is great and its so nice being able to watch it for free with Amazon Prime.
I:17943;342;The initial public response seemed to be very positive and the trailers that I saw of Heath Ledger as the Joker looked tremendous.
I:17943;343;The Joker is a psychopath rather than a pure comic strip side show.
I:17943;344;I'm sure it appeals to a teenage audience.
I:17943;345;so, if you're a Batman aficionado, you'll probably find this film in the top of its class.
I:17943;346;The two are truly companion pieces and you will not be able to appreciate the full progression of character (especially within Bruce Wayne) that Nolan and Bale have created unless you first witness how it all began.
I:17943;347;Sure, it is not necessary to see the first film in order to enjoy this film for the action/genre film that it is, but it helps you to see just how this film transcends the boundaries of its genre if you see it from the very beginning.
I:17943;348;what sets `The Dark Knight' apart from every other superhero film, and really any other genre film, is that if you strip away the costumes you still have a film.
I:17943;349;While the film follows a carefully crafted storyline of doublecrossment with The Joker offering Gotham's mob bosses a chance to keep their money and rid themselves of the Batman, the real story is all wrapped up in the conflicting sides of good and evil that manifest themselves in the characters that appear on the screen.
I:17943;350;The Joker introduces a new kind of madness to Gotham, a madness that knows no boundaries, and this proposes a question of ethics and morals within those who have to deal with this monster.
I:17943;351;the masterful performances by the cast only help elevate this film, added more layers of realism to the madness.
I:17943;352;Bale reprises his role as Wayne and he does so with powerful conviction, especially as the film draws to a close and his own moral stance is jeopardized by his emotions.
I:17943;353;"I still haven't gotten used to the Batman voice, but his Wayne is by far the best Wayne ever displayed on screen
I:17943;354;Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman also reprise their roles for this sequel and continue to astound, delivering significant aid to Wayne's personal transformation.
I:17943;355;Gyllenhaal is a force here, never slinking into the background as did Holmes but making the character of Rachel front and center, providing the film the moral counterbalance to The Joker's influence.
I:17943;356;Eckhart is magnificent as Dent, downplaying his own charms to give his character a sense of insecurity that only comes with the job.
I:17943;357;Matched against Bale he is the perfect compliment to Wayne's insecurities masked over by an abundance of faux charm.
I:17943;358;the fact remains that `The Dark Knight' is a masterpiece.
I:17943;359;It is a film that transcends the boundaries of genre and proves that you don't have to be a typical Oscar bait film to deliver a message.
I:17943;360;Think back over the years of Oscar to the last time a superhero movie has garnered this much buzz and attention.
I:17943;361;The message within `The Dark Knight' is a bleak one, but it is given a glimmer of hope that we all do well to contemplate.
I:17943;362;I doubt they can make one as good as The Dark Knight!
I:17943;363;Christian Bale was as good as in the first one!
I:17943;364;Christian Nolan is by far the greatest producer of our time.
I:17943;365;The movie has a very intense feeling to it that makes you feel emotionally invested in the outcome, and it does not disappoint!
I:17943;366;'About that, I have laughed at myself regularly since it opened.
I:17943;367;without a shadow of a doubt, 'Knight' is one of the best movies in the history of film.
I:17943;368;Christopher Nolan has proved himself one of the best film directors and writers out there.
I:17943;369;The movie was tragic, funny and tense, almost all at the same time, but one could never question whether it flowed together as one, cohesive piece of story.
I:17943;370;however, despite excellent performances from Christian Bale, Michael Caine, and Gary Oldman, despite superb special effects and fights, in spite of an excellent screenplay.
I:17943;371;it is the performance of Heath Ledger that is the best aspect of the film.
I:17943;372;His performance is worthy of any award they can give him.
I:17943;373;"i'm not sure that this review has done any justice, so I'll close with a short bit of advice
I:17943;374;This was the best movie I saw this year.
I:17943;375;The only decent special features are an interview with Hans Zimmer and others from the production crew about casting the score, and a featurette on the technology Batman utilizes.
I:17943;376;The other features (the full.
I:17943;377;This movie was an epic chapter in the Batman saga.
I:17943;378;Certainly an excellent movie to watch.
I:17943;379;The best movie ever of all time,like when batman was like haaaaa,and the joker was like naaaa!!!!!!!
I:17943;380;then he trashed his car so it transformed into a bike.
I:17943;381;Christian Bale returns as Batman in the sequal the Dark Knight.
I:17943;382;He was a talent actor.
I:17943;383;Christian Bale is always an actor that is able to bring everything to a character he protrays.
I:17943;384;The other actors are good too but BAle is truly outstanding.
I:17943;385;Christian Bale is my favorite Batman.
I:17943;386;Came on time and packed well.
I:17943;387;loved the movie filmed partially here in chicago and on top of all of that free super saver shipping was quick!
I:17943;388;it kept me on the edge of my seat.
I:17943;389;but it is an awesome movie.
I:17943;390;He is that good .
I:17943;391;Words can't really describe how great his performance was or how good the movie was.
I:17943;392;Very compelling storyline that keeps you on the edge of your seat.
I:17943;393;I made a point of watching this movie before seeing the final one.
I:17943;394;Well worth the second viewing.
I:17943;395;The film is amazing on every level.
I:17943;396;Heath Ledger took a well known and often played character and made it his own.
I:17943;397;this is the Joker that terrorized us in The Dark Knight Returns and the Killing Joke (2 of the finest Batman graphic novels) and he elevated it.
I:17943;398;disc special edition, this Blockbuster.
I:17943;399;The sleeve in the back has a nice surprise for hardcore fans of the movie.
I:17943;400;Great theme, yes, but do we really need ten minutes of watching him have a cello player play two notes repeatedly?
I:17943;401;By far this is the best comic book adapted film EVER plain and simple.
I:17943;402;This film is first rate Christopher Nolan has outdone himself again.
I:17943;403;If you really look closely at the film you will notice the paralell with our government.
I:17943;404;I mean come on lets get real, most of us have no problem discussing in detail our personal lives so loud in front of other people in public locations with our cell phones, yet we are so worried about the government tapping terorist lines.
I:17943;405;The comparasions between Batman and President Bush are amazing.
I:17943;406;I hope the next installment of this franchise is even better yet.
I:17943;407;I hope they bring back the Penguin, Bob Hoskins will make a great Penguin.
I:17943;408;I wish I can give it 10 stars because it is so deserving.
I:17943;409;Everyone knows that dark night is an amazing movie.
I:17943;410;Even if you aren't into it, get it so you can look cool for having it on your shelf.
I:17943;411;There are so many other ways this story could have been told, ways that this film could have been made, interesting, innovative ways.
I:17943;412;But the question remains: Will the Batman idea ever produce a good movie?
I:17943;413;Where do we begin?Three years ago, movie.
I:17943;414;Did you get your act together and deliver us one of the best bat.
I:17943;415;and now you've done it again . . . times ten!Batman has made a difference in Gotham.
I:17943;416;is brilliant, and if he gets his way, Gotham will fall into his hands.
I:17943;417;They so did and me and everyone in that theatre were gushing with joy that not only was The Dark Knight as good as Batman Begins, it was even better.
I:17943;418;christian Bale delivered another solid performance as Bruce Wayne/Batman.
I:17943;419;In Batman Begins, it was gruff, cool and tough.
I:17943;420;Heath Ledger's Joker was utterly amazing.
I:17943;421;What I loved the most was two things 1) the clown make up was just that: make up.
I:17943;422;Bringing us to 2) Joker was a genius.
I:17943;423;hey, he did a good job on both sides of the, um, coin.
I:17943;424;face in the next one.
I:17943;425;i enjoyed Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel Dawes better than Katie Holmes.
I:17943;426;Maggie's kind and cute, but can be rough and touch when she needs to.
I:17943;427;Worked well for Bruce's childhood friend/love interest, especially when that twist came that changed Rachel's future forever.
I:17943;428;this movie is just tremendously good.
I:17943;429;Great movie, which I consider to be a physocological thriller, in the sense that the fight between Batman and the Joker is really for the soul of a Gotham.
I:17943;430;It has a lot of action, and twists and turns, and its great if you a a Batman fan.
I:17943;431;When The Joker shows up, he steals the scene and I was on the edge of my seat everytime he appeared.
I:17943;432;All in all, its still an excellent film.
I:17943;433;I loved the action, the story, and the acting.
I:17943;434;Ledger steals the film and Eckhart does an excellent villian.
I:17943;435;Christopher Nolan and all concerned can take well.
I:17943;436;earned bows, for they have trumped their auspicious debut to the new series with an intense dark and crazily relevant followup film.
I:17943;437;Everyone involved has done superb work in all the technical areas and it was a joy to see real stunt work done with panache.
I:17943;438;The cast is excellent throughout.
I:17943;439;He is indelible and mesmerizing in all his scenes.
I:17943;440;Aaron Eckhart is right on his heels as Harvey Dent, and Maggie Gyllenhal is a welcome addition to the Christian Bale/Michael Caine (and Gary Oldman) foundation.
I:17943;441;to say anything more about the film at this premiere stage would be a disservice to the audience, so suffice it to say, this is a thoroughly intelligent and engrossing film with it all up there on the screen, and it is well worth your while.
I:17943;442;First off this is a review of this particular special edition not of the movie, which I thought was great.
I:17943;443;It was fun, with wonderful characterization, cool Bat gadgets, and fun bad guys.
I:17943;444;A thrilling run from start to finish, and most certainly a movie I hope to someday own.
I:17943;445;Heavy themes, heavy thoughts, enough depth to drown in, carried by excellent actors and sharp dialogue and deep ethical questions.
I:17943;446;movies coupling art with entertainment, one of the highest callings entertainment can aspire to and one of the hardest to achieve.
I:17943;447;there's great acting here by everyone, even secondary and tertiary characters.
I:17943;448;"Batman does have some unintentionally humorous moments with his rasping, slurring ""bat."
I:17943;449;but overall, he does a fine job.
I:17943;450;The Joker is downright perfect (perhaps a little too perfect) .
I:17943;451;a character you'll love to hate.
I:17943;452;the characters are great, the plot is excellently crafted, and the dialogue is great.
I:17943;453;It's not just solid, it's a masterpiece.
I:17943;454;Every moment the Joker is alive is a moment you can't relax.
I:17943;455;This is an experience and an exploration of the natures of good and evil.
I:17943;456;"What I wanted, and thought I was going to see, was a fun ride with an uplifting end
I:17943;457;Even with the Joker captured, one has the sensation that he has won anyway .
I:17943;458;every second he is alive, he wins.
I:17943;459;I want to see something work for once.
I:17943;460;"I want to see good triumph
I:17943;461;I wanted Batman to win completely, without question.
I:17943;462;"this is certainly no feel good movie
I:17943;463;Ledger was good, really good.
I:17943;464;I think the most impressive thing he did was come up with a fresh take on the Joker after several famous portrayals.
I:17943;465;That is the best they could do?
I:17943;466;"And the ""Raspy Batman voice"" was REALLY IRRITATING!"
I:17943;467;Heath Ledger's performance in this film is memorable.
I:17943;468;Everyone is great, except for poor Maggie Gylenhall.
I:17943;469;Aaron Eckhart is amazing as well.
I:17943;470;Not too many extra features but that is why I bought the single.
I:17943;471;Very disappointed I bought this movie because it's one of my all time favorites, and it came with the iTunes digital copy.
I:17943;472;I absolutely love this movie.
I:17943;473;Batman is so cool, this movie just never gets old.
I:17943;474;I absolutely loved this movie.
I:17943;475;i think this is on of christopher nolan`s best work.
I:17943;476;the joker was a hit in this movie aqnd it was fascinating watching the joker push batman to the edge
I:17943;477;"He described the Joker perfectly, as a ""mass."
I:17943;478;Christian Bale as the title role was an excellent choice, as well.
I:17943;479;Freakin Christian Bale as Batman vs. an amazing performance by Heath Ledger as the Joker.
I:17943;480;and the excellent writing and directing by Christopher Nolan.
I:17943;481;A great story, with great music, great acting.
I:17943;482;and hope to look forward to another great epic movie in Nolan's Batman series.
I:17943;483;but the main reason i love this movie,is because of heath ledger's performance as the joker,it's funny every time the joker come's out,i am alway's silent.
I:17943;484;i am happy i bought this movie.
I:17943;485;the movie is a solid 5 star.
I:17943;486;It has little of the fantasy one often associates with such movies and instead creates an action thriller that has both your heart and mind racing to the finish.
I:17943;487;It's a smart film meant for smart people.
I:17943;488;aspect of previous Batman films (this even includes Batman Begins), this is undeniably a thrilling watch.
I:17943;489;Just as it looks like their plan is about to succeed, it's turned on itself by the mysterious Joker, an unhinged yet charismatic crook who single.
I:17943;490;handedly manages to push Gotham towards complete chaos, and Batman more and more towards the edge of the bad guy.
I:17943;491;Wide shots and open spaces are employed to great effect, allowing the viewer both to feel secure and helplessly alone, all depending on what's happening.
I:17943;492;"The late Heath Ledger fully deserved his Oscar for Best Supporting Actor
I:17943;493;The Joker has never been a more fascinating character than here, in my personal opinion.
I:17943;494;and this is the real clinch .
I:17943;495;manages to keep his hands clean of the many miseries he causes.
I:17943;496;the rest of the cast is excellent as well.
I:17943;497;dimensional Bruce Wayne than any of his predecessors could manage.
I:17943;498;Batman is the only way the true potential of his personality can be unleashed.
I:17943;499;Aaron Eckhart is perfect as white knight Harvey Dent, whose pure heart is perhaps in most danger from the Joker.
I:17943;500;His performance is electrifying and charismatic, yet always with a tangible sense of insecurity.
I:17943;501;Maggie Gyllenhaal takes the role of Rachel Dawes from Katie Holmes, and I must say that I like the exchange.
I:17943;502;Not only do she and Bale have much more believable chemistry as the two childhood friends, she inhibits the character really well in her bold determination to stand up to injustice.
I:17943;503;"Michael Caine is wonderful as Alfred, is the root to reality that Bruce Wayne needs
I:17943;504;To be frank, each and every performance is spot on.
I:17943;505;Even Russian ballerina Natasha, who appears for about five minutes of the film, is an intriguing character.
I:17943;506;powerful themes are dealt with in this film.
I:17943;507;Batman often finds himself on the receiving end of the fear.
I:17943;508;This is a very interesting and sadly authentic human flaw that Jonathan Nolan has caught.
I:17943;509;Nolan's script is truly superb, leading to a story that begs for repeated viewings.
I:17943;510;Believe me, after the film draws to a close, you are probably rooted to your seat.
I:17943;511;The Joker, also, is too smart to be believable.
I:17943;512;He foresees absolutely everything that happens and this really starts to become silly after a while.
I:17943;513;class and the action and deep.
I:17943;514;This is the way a Batman movie should be and should look like.
I:17943;515;This is how the JOKER should act, show his personality, and show the wackiness within.
I:17943;516;All the elements of the batman comics came to life and went beyond the comics themselves with such strong emotion.
I:17943;517;invented it with such strong acting that he set the bar for any future actors as to how to play the Joker.
I:17943;518;first Off lets start with the Heath Ledgers contribution to this character.
I:17943;519;Im pretty sure Nolan wanted the Joker in a more serious, insane, yet funny manner for this movie.
I:17943;520;A Joker with eyes that show NO empathy, show Schizophrenia, Show Psychopath, and with a smile to show aggravation and laughter at the same time.
I:17943;521;to see if he can crack a smile.
I:17943;522;He proves to theatre goers that he can put a city into chaos by breaking down the rules we create.
I:17943;523;He Proves that Batman is just human and that no fear can be gained out of Batman.
I:17943;524;The Script is incredible but its Ledgers facial expressions, shrill voice, maniacal laughter and bottomless stare that enhances this movie so much.
I:17943;525;composed, thinking, morality as his number 1, a symbol of fear for all of gothams underworld.
I:17943;526;in general this was the best Batman Movie to be ever released.
I:17943;527;this sets the tone for Batman's Future Theatrical Releases, sets the tone for the Villains to be portrayed in a dark and twisted manner.
I:17943;528;and sets the bar very high for the next person to step into the Joker's Suit, if ever, and act with a maniacal mindsetRIP.
I:17943;529;to Heath Ledger and his brilliant acting
I:17943;530;the Dark Night is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.
I:17943;531;It is action pact with amazing visual affects.
I:17943;532;Everyone in this movie gives a top performance.
I:17943;533;The actors are fantastic and this is definitely one of Heath Ledger's finest performances.
I:17943;534;It's no doubt going to be tough to top this installment of Batman.
I:17943;535;I can watch this movie 100 time over.
I:17943;536;It was just that well written, acted, and directed.
I:17943;537;if you love the BatMan character, see it if you feel you must.
I:17943;538;take a pass on this one and re.
I:17943;539;a) Cat burgler steals Bruce Wayne's full set of fingerprints from a safe (and breaks into it for good measure).
I:17943;540;Not one that fits in a truck).
I:17943;541;but All this can be forgiven if the charactors are well written and engaging.
I:17943;542;keep your eyes open to watch while you're figuring out which artery to cut to make it all go away.
I:17943;543;morgan Freeman is excellent as always but he can't hold this wrist.
I:17943;544;michael Caine is excellent and I actually apprecied his advice when he prophetically walked away from this story because it was too pointlessly depressing.
I:17943;545;Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins was an interesting take on an established character and franchise.
I:17943;546;For all of that, it was still an impressive film.
I:17943;547;The result is an escalating series of complex, doublecrossing traps and counter.
I:17943;548;And two men's souls and morals are caught in the balance.
I:17943;549;the Dark Knight is a fiendishly clever film which works on a thematic level that superhero movies have rarely operated at before.
I:17943;550;much has been made of the late Heath Ledger's remarkable performance as the Joker.
I:17943;551;He is a psychopath and a monster, one that Ledger portrays with brilliant intensity and some excellent comedic timing.
I:17943;552;The heart of The Dark Knight is the war for the soul of Harvey Dent, and in that story the Joker is a catalyst.
I:17943;553;The Joker's significant amounts of screentime eat into the more compelling story of Dent (an almost.
I:17943;554;equally impressive performance from Aaron Eckhart), who is absent from the plot for long periods of time and his inevitable late.
I:17943;555;pieces take place some considerable time before the end of the movie.
I:17943;556;quite final moments in the movie begins to challenge Return of the King at times for its frustration.
I:17943;557;Eckhart and Ledger get special nods, but supporting hands from the first movie Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and especially Michael Caine all give excellent performances.
I:17943;558;Maggie Gyllenhaall, taking over the Katie Holmes role from the first film (thankfully, as Gyllenhaal is a much better actress), also impresses.
I:17943;559;Christian Bale does good work as Wayne/Batman, but in a movie of stand.
I:17943;560;the Dark Knight (****) is an effective, impressive and dark film with stand.
I:17943;561;It is definitely one of the better superhero movies of recent years, but I'd hesitate about calling it the best.
I:17943;562;Otherwise a fine movie for a little entertainment.
I:17943;563;He's the first actor to start impressing me in the role since Michael Keaton, and if they make a third one he will have the role down perfectly.
I:17943;564;Maggie Gyllenhall has more depth to her, and the chemistry between she and Aaron Eckhart was convincing.
I:17943;565;the two standout actors that won me over in this movie were Aaron Eckhart as Two.
I:17943;566;Eckhart brings out a really twisted Two.
I:17943;567;face without being obvious, and his transformation into the character was smooth and well.
I:17943;568;something that allows me to disconnect his performance from Jack Nicholson's in the original Tim Burton BATMAN.
I:17943;569;Ledger is a very quirky, cynical, but strangely loveable Joker, and I have to admit it's haunting knowing that Heath's career came to an abrupt end.
I:17943;570;I especially liked his fight scenes with Batman, which was a slight reminder to Keaton and Nicholson battling it out in the original movie.
I:17943;571;overall, I was genuinely surprised by the movie.
I:17943;572;Great performances all around, great action scenes, and one of the darkest Batman movies to come in a long time (that end scene with Two.
I:17943;573;I have great hopes for a third one.
I:17943;574;It's good to know that the next generation can have a Batman series worth enjoying, and it will not surprise me if Heath Ledger gets.
I:17943;575;an Oscar nomination for his performance.
I:17943;576;Every scene he was in i got shivers.
I:17943;577;i enjoyed it more and more each time i saw it.
I:17943;578;amazing, well worthy of the praise it recieves.
I:17943;579;I should have reviewed this a long time ago since everyone now knows what a fantastic movie this is.
I:17943;580;Christian Bale is amazing as always.
I:17943;581;Heath Ledger delivers a great performance as Joker.
I:17943;582;that's the best thing about this movie.
I:17943;583;Cool special effects and a lot of action, as you would expect, though.
I:17943;584;It was visually stunning, darker than Burton's, and at times, edge of your seat intense.
I:17943;585;The Joker is truly terrifying.
I:17943;586;Christian Bale is a cool, collected Batman, and Maggie Gyllenhaal is a suitable love interest.
I:17943;587;I really enjoyed Aaron Eckhardt as Harvey Dent and wish the movie hadn't turned out the way it did for his character.
I:17943;588;i would recommend this movie if you've ever enjoyed a Batman movie, and are open to seeing a new interpretation of this classic character.
I:17943;589;I enjoyed the movie even though it differed from the Batman of my youth.
I:17943;590;I would also recommend this to anyone who enjoys action films.
I:17943;591;since it's likely to be the best one out this summer!
I:17943;592;Having the veneer of seriousness, self.
I:17943;593;Seen it 3 times to TRY to find redeeming qualities.
I:17943;594;The first time, only Heath Ledger saved it for me and I found myself WAITING for him to appear just so I could enjoy part of the film.
I:17943;595;Even he became annoying and I actually don't think his performance is truly Oscar.
I:17943;596;He certainly ought to be able to more easily handle a bunch of low.
I:17943;597;level criminals, including the Joker.
I:17943;598;And what is with the uber.
I:17943;599;essential characters that were given spoon.
I:17943;600;Where's the depth, the emotion, the humanity?
I:17943;601;this is an okay Batman story, at best.
I:17943;602;if you think this is five star material, you're not that into Batman, and you've got a lot of great reading ahead of you.
I:17943;603;the three stars are my impression of the appeal of the whole movie, if edited down (while preserving all of Ledgers screen time) I'd give it a 5 star rating.
I:17943;604;I read in the local paper the next day that in the next town the film actually caught fire on the projector.
I:17943;605;Its simply mind blowing and i'm the money i paid for it.
I:17943;606;the best part of this film was the few seconds long scene when The Joker sticks his head out of the police car window.
I:17943;607;For that scene, and for that scene only, this film gets one star.
I:17943;608;Nice to stream the movie live from home.
I:17943;609;I can't imagine how that could be shown in another genre, but the comic book source is perfect for that.
I:17943;610;The Joker brings chaos to Gotham, but his antics are incredibly carefully planned, the way only a real madman could plan them.
I:17943;611;Batman is most successful when he introduces chaos into the Joker's plans (the fights in the Pruitt Building, for instance), and Commissioner Gordon wins a coup by using the element of surprise.
I:17943;612;That grabs your attention after the movie when you try to figure out if the Joker really did take all that money for himself.
I:17943;613;You see it happen right before your eyes, and you're still not sure.
I:17943;614;and the movie has you hooked, once you get inside its deeper levels this way.
I:17943;615;He can bend the barrels of guns with one hand.
I:17943;616;Heath Leger in the nurses dress was visionary and hilarious .
I:17943;617;8) Some have compared the opening sequence to Heat and Nolan to Michael Mann.
I:17943;618;It's more like a tribute than a splash of originality.
I:17943;619;the movie is definitely an experience, a refreshingly dark blockbuster, which is impressive.
I:17943;620;It is worth seeing and I will probibly see it again.
I:17943;621;"I found it was definitely cool but not ""GENIUS"" ."
I:17943;622;it's a rich trip into darkness if nothing else.
I:17943;623;"Maybe it does for me more than others, but ""The Dark Knight"" delivers on everything it promises and then some."
I:17943;624;This is pretty heavy stuff and not suitable for the real young kiddies.
I:17943;625;This is the Joker, and Heath Ledger is ready to stun, amaze, frighten, and captivate you with his unbelieveable performance.
I:17943;626;the movie and it's taut, tight direction from Nolan is one for the books.
I:17943;627;A movie is only as good as it's cast, and this one is no exception from the amazing cast 'Batman Begins' had.
I:17943;628;First and foremost is Ledger.
I:17943;629;There is no denying the talent he had, and it's on full display here.
I:17943;630;What you are seeing is the Joker, alive and well in all his glory.
I:17943;631;His tics and delivery are spot on, and it is something that will stay with you long after the movie is over.
I:17943;632;There is definitley an Oscar nomination in the future for this portrayal.
I:17943;633;Elsewhere, Bale continues to be the solid footing for the whole epic event, and he is the best Batman, and a great Bruce Wayne.
I:17943;634;His growling Batman voice is still unsettling and a bit unnerving, but he is Batman.
I:17943;635;Michael Caine and Gary Oldman are as solid and dependable as ever, if only they had more to do.
I:17943;636;I love the gothic look of Tim Burton's Gotham, and the very colorful, comic book dowsed Gotham from Joel Schumacher, but this Gotham takes place in the real world.
I:17943;637;Nolan obviously had a ball filming Chicago(as Gotham)and everything else, because the movie is a wonderful sight to behold.
I:17943;638;The script is tight and holds itself together, something that doesn't always happen in comic bo.
I:17943;639;The Dark Knight is the, okay I'll say it, comic book and superhero movie that all others that come afterward should be measured.
I:17943;640;It raises the bar increasingly high.
I:17943;641;Batman Dark Knight does it again.
I:17943;642;The latest installment in this series is a great portrayal of the all the characters involved.
I:17943;643;The film THE DARK KNIGHT is amazing, a revelation to some including me but for those interested in the blu.
I:17943;644;ray allows much opportunity for crispness and clarity of picture .
I:17943;645;when done to its best a film takes on a life of its own.
I:17943;646;And THE DARK KNIGHT can honestly be reviewed in two parts .
I:17943;647;ray version as one of the best examples of how blu.
I:17943;648;There is much quick action, tons of important closeups and many dynamic shots created by director Christopher Nolan.
I:17943;649;The clarity and crispness of the video on blu.
I:17943;650;Colors are vibrant, skin tones realistic and the ratio with blacks and whites superb.
I:17943;651;All the explosions and effects shine and seem to pop from the screen.
I:17943;652;The audio is also a masterpiece and provides the necessary accompaniment to such a perfect presentation.
I:17943;653;Dialogue is perfect and action sequences very realistic.
I:17943;654;How wonderful that his final role is such a true testament to the depth of talent he possessed.
I:17943;655;Just by his movements and way of speaking you got hints of the character's back story.
I:17943;656;This was an Oscar well deserved.
I:17943;657;But we must also give huge kudos to director Christopher Nolan and actor Christian Bale.
I:17943;658;Batman has been a comic, a television series and even done in film before.
I:17943;659;Christopher Nolan's interpretation of the superhero take the story totally beyond comic book genre and presents Batman as a very real character with his own deep troubles and personal history.
I:17943;660;This film is a story for the ages done well on all levels.
I:17943;661;Acting, directing, writing all fall together for a deep, intense, scary story that will haunt you.
I:17943;662;ans again, in regards to the blu.
I:17943;663;If you are a fan of the film you will be enthralled and even if you are not it is a necessity for it shows blu.
I:17943;664;as a summer movie, I rate it right up there with Iron Man as oneof the two best movies of 08.
I:17943;665;Overall a very good movie.
I:17943;666;***WARNING, THERE ARE SPOILERS***Pros:+ Visually this movie looks stunning, from the sets to the cgi this movie blew me away!
I:17943;667;the boat scene at the end of the film was very well done and emotional.
I:17943;668;"Hopefully ""The Dark Knight Rises"" will be better."
I:17943;669;I know that I liked it, I liked the acting, and I liked the plot.
I:17943;670;Ending was open ended, so here comes Batman III.
I:17943;671;This movie certainly is drawing a lot of comparisons.
I:17943;672;nolan, like Jackson, based his films on previous material and translated it to film in an engaging way that spoke to modern audiences while staying true to the source material.
I:17943;673;invigorate a genre, but redefine it as well.
I:17943;674;a film that not only excites and astounds, but questions and examines.
I:17943;675;The Dark Knight doesn't simply take you on an emotional ride, but on an ethical and ultimately introspective ride as well.
I:17943;676;I enjoyed this and the next one in this series.
I:17943;677;Very well done and enjoyable.
I:17943;678;A very good concept taken too far.
I:17943;679;well, i'm about to commit blasphemy and type out an unfavourable review of the new chris nolan BATMAN film.
I:17943;680;"nurturer spirit?well say goodbye to those days my friends, cause there's a new ""super"" hero in town."
I:17943;681;nor is it cool to NOT have a film that could also double for a well.
I:17943;682;perhaps most people just like being told what they will enjoy.
I:17943;683;"(and this is a message from a society that kept ""friends"" on the air for almost a decade."
I:17943;684;when you drive the new honda 5000 crotch rocket extreme, let 'em TRY and catch you.
I:17943;685;there is nothing inspiring or intriguing about him in the least.
I:17943;686;"christian bale is sexy and ""brooding"" (or predominantly silent."
I:17943;687;"i do admire nolan's skillful direction, the way the complicated plot is allowed to unravel, and a few nice film ""moments"" that are tenderly depicted (a VERY few, mostly involving a hand gesture or a notecard, just something simple that was nicely framed which i did appreciate) and who can argue with Ledger's bravura Joker?but other than that?nothing really noteworthy or worthwhile here."
I:17943;688;trust me, you'll feel better for it.
I:17943;689;ray disc, was really amazing.
I:17943;690;The picture, affects and sound were so awesome.
I:17943;691;The Dark Knight quickly became one of my favorite movies of all.
I:17943;692;tDK has all the right amounts of action in it.
I:17943;693;It's such a great and fun movie to watch.
I:17943;694;I thought Christian Bale could have done a far better job, but with that said.
I:17943;695;First day, middle of the theatre, waiting patiently and anxiously.
I:17943;696;So I put it in and started it and watched the entire thing again.
I:17943;697;of the main cast only Ledger really brings anything interesting to his role, an astonishing thing seeing as the role he has is one note throughout.
I:17943;698;"i wanted to like ""The Dark Knight"", I did."
I:17943;699;This continuation of the reboot of the Batman franchise delivers strongly.
I:17943;700;I watched the earlier Batman movies, which were fine for their time, but Christian Bale is the real Batman to me now.
I:17943;701;This set is well worth the money and is amazing.
I:17943;702;the movie is obviously amazing and everyone should know that so I won't get into the movie, but the journal and every thing else that comes with this set is an incredible deal for the money.
I:17943;703;I loved The Dark Knight when I saw it in the theater back in the summer of 08 .
I:17943;704;it was one of my favorite movies of the year.
I:17943;705;The real reason I bought this Blu.
I:17943;706;ray was for some excellent special features chronicling the making of this triumphant summer blockbuster, and what I got was a bit underwhelming.
I:17943;707;What I got was just.
I:17943;708;Heath Ledger's performance is one of the most hilarious I have ever seen.
I:17943;709;If you can understand what I'm talking about, it makes this film about 100 times better.
I:17943;710;One of the best made movies in quite some time.
I:17943;711;I have to laugh at all the positive reviews on this movie, Yes Batman Begins was a huge success.
I:17943;712;But I have to agree with a previous reviewer.
I:17943;713;Batman acted like Batman, and the joker acted like the joker.
I:17943;714;One question to all those who loved this movie, can you honestly tell me.
I:17943;715;right of the top of your head, a memorable line.
I:17943;716;The '89 movie is full of them, also.
I:17943;717;"Christopher Nolan is a great director, but this movie felt like he meshed ""Inception"" with Batman."
I:17943;718;A realistic Batman doesn't work, sorry.
I:17943;719;It was an awesome movie and some really great acting the effects as well and the humor.
I:17943;720;An awesome meaning behind the movie as well!
I:17943;721;I highly recommend this movie!
I:17943;722;I liked Batman Begins and the Dark Knight Rises more than this movie.
I:17943;723;The viewing via Amazon Instant Video worked wonderfully and without a problem or hitch.
I:17943;724;It was a very good story, and they could not have picked a better cast.
I:17943;725;the special effects were the greatest!
I:17943;726;I think it was the best Batman ever!!!
I:17943;727;i saw the movie in the theater and thought it was great.
I:17943;728;keith ledger did a fantastic job as the joker.
I:17943;729;This is a good movie, but not great.
I:17943;730;I like to feel good at the end of a movie and if not there should be some good metephysical reason why not.
I:17943;731;The Blue ray was very good on the graphic, sound and detail.
I:17943;732;I'm a huge Batman fan since the age of 7 and I'm 50 now!
I:17943;733;Heath captures and claims the role and NEVER will there be a greater performance by an actor as the Joker!
I:17943;734;The video and sound are amazing.
I:17943;735;this movie really draws you in.
I:17943;736;Saw this for two bucks and thought I would see what the hype was about.
I:17943;737;christian Bale absolutely sucks as Batman, period.
I:17943;738;I really enjoyed the acting as well as the special effects.
I:17943;739;Much better to see in the comfort of my living room.
I:17943;740;o. vision VR format they will be watching their modern narrative films on, but, like classic novels, SOME movies from the last 100 years will be consumed by the general pubic?
I:17943;741;Yes, it is a comic book movie and with that comes an automatic simplification of human psychology and interaction compared to more esoteric films with gut.
I:17943;742;A flawless story encapsulating dramatic characters, themes, cinematography, and soundtrack?
I:17943;743;When most viewers of the film are engaged in similar conversations coming out of the theater you know the film has more then just a 'popcorn movie' impact on the greater culture at large.
I:17943;744;how about fun and entertaining?
I:17943;745;Some of greats struggle to qualify on that level but yet they still remain great films people eagerly consume.
I:17943;746;But being 'fun' can only help its long term consideration.
I:17943;747;There will be more Batman sequels to follow and those films will probably play a role in how The Dark Knight is viewed from a distance.
I:17943;748;The Dark Knight is undoubtably in the running and, for now, is a masterpiece for it's time, holding a place in the leading pack.
I:17943;749;The Joker is memorable, but I don't want this in my memory.
I:17943;750;In the grand tradition of last year's critical darlings There Will Be Blood and No Country for Old Men, we have The Dark Knight.
I:17943;751;The Dark Knight is a well made and polished movie that has some weighty themes and some very good acting.
I:17943;752;On paper, this is the Batman I've always hoped for.
I:17943;753;I prefer Frank Miller's or Allan Moore's take, and this movie is a bit of both.
I:17943;754;So what's not to love?There is a ton to love about The Dark Knight.
I:17943;755;His look is also fantastic.
I:17943;756;He's the perfect embodiment of the assertion that Batman and The Joker are two sides of the same coin.
I:17943;757;I've always wanted this to be explored in film, and at least from the Joker's side of things, I'm more than pleased.
I:17943;758;the supporting actors were mostly good.
I:17943;759;Aaron Eckhart was a lot better than expected as Harvey Dent, Gary Oldmann, who's always good really, played James Gordon very well again, and Michael Caine did well with the little he had to work with.
I:17943;760;The action was generally well shot, but kind of chaotic.
I:17943;761;The opening sequence, with its direct references to Heat was amazing though.
I:17943;762;They're more forces of nature than actual people.
I:17943;763;anyway, The Dark Knight is definitely a fine film that deserves to be seen, especially for Ledger's iconic portrayal of The Joker.
I:17943;764;well it was a great movie.
I:17943;765;it was in perfect condition and shrienkwrapped!!
I:17943;766;i was very impressed and would recommend this seller to anyone!
I:17943;767;The movie has a dark tone to it of course, its Gotham City!The acting was great by everyone involved.
I:17943;768;"as everyone knows, Heath Ledger was ""phenomenal"" as the Joker!"
I:17943;769;His unique twist on the Joker role will be remembered for a long, long while!The amazing cast includes: Christian Bale (Batman), Heath Ledger (The Joker), Maggie Gyllenhaal (Rachel Dawes), Aaron Eckhart (Harvey Dent), Gary Oldman (Lt. James Gordon), Morgan Freeman (Lucius Fox), Michael Caine (Alfred Pennyworth) and Cillian Murphy returns as (the Scarecrow)!
I:17943;770;This movie, the soundtrack, and action kept me on the edge of my seat.
I:17943;771;The Dark Knight is among my favorite all time films.
I:17943;772;disc Special Edition)and very much enjoyed the Special Features.
I:17943;773;disc widescreen version of The Dark Knight.
I:17943;774;ray, I am glad to own this excellent film.
I:17943;775;The Dark Knight is a wonderful movie that, definitely, lives up to all the hype that surrounds it.
I:17943;776;Perfect casting, superior storytelling and a unique take on The Dark Knight makes this movie seem spookily real.
I:17943;777;Heath Ledger's portrayal of The Joker manages to hit you emotionally as a truly sadistic force that's evil and believable.
I:17943;778;He gave a performance that is definitely Oscar Worthy.
I:17943;779;i really love Chris Nolan's take on Batman.
I:17943;780;With Nolan's take, you see how Batman is conflicted with the fact he's fighting an endless battle against crime.
I:17943;781;Again, in saying, making it all the more believable.
I:17943;782;It's won all manner of awards thus far from The American Film Institue, The Golden Globes, Broadcast Film Critics Association, The People's Choice Awards, and more.
I:17943;783;Given, there's practically no blood in the movie but there are plenty of scenes of extreme intensity that will get to them, believe me.
I:17943;784;so, do I recommend this movie?
I:17943;785;You'll love it as much as I did.
I:17943;786;I loved every minute of it.
I:17943;787;Yes, Heath Leger was amazing, but Aaron Eckhardt was amazing too.
I:17943;788;Lets face it: while The Dark Knight really was a good movie at heart, Heath's performance as the Joker skyrocketed the movie's box office and critical success.
I:17943;789;I never liked any of the comics or the old movies.
I:17943;790;But Batman Begins was great, and this movie was greater.
I:17943;791;While I won't join the mainstream crowd and say that this movie was the best of all time, but I'll admit its one of the best.
I:17943;792;Nothing much to say about this film other than the fact that I'd recommend it to people.
I:17943;793;Still good, but extremely overrated.
I:17943;794;I bought this film for a present .
I:17943;795;"Dark Knight BD viewed on a Panasonic 50"" plasma via a Panasonic DMP."
I:17943;796;very impressive AQ on par with Bug's Life or Drag Me To Hell.
I:17943;797;the IMAX scenes are among the best available on BD for viewing, and the Bat.
I:17943;798;tumbler sequence in the middle is arguably the most memorable action sequence since the lobby scene in The Matrix, imho.
I:17943;799;It was a good movie.
I:17943;800;good enough to make me want to see this one.
I:17943;801;It's good enough that I didn't want to pause it for anything.
I:17943;802;Just an overall great followup to Batman Begins.
I:17943;803;Obviously I had to see it again to absorb it all.
I:17943;804;The film is as layered and complex as it is tense and entertaining.
I:17943;805;This is Ledger's greatest performance in a career that was cut tragically short.
I:17943;806;His portrayal of the Joker is one for the ages.
I:17943;807;As Michael Caine's Alfred puts it at one point, he just likes to watch the world burn.
I:17943;808;He needs Batman to challenge him and push him to new levels of depravity.
I:17943;809;i could go on and on about the brillance of Ledger's performance, but the movie has a lot more going for it as well.
I:17943;810;He balances explosive action sequences and deeply emotional moments with the greatest of ease.
I:17943;811;The screenplay grounds the film in realism and lends it an incredible amount of moral ambiguity and complexity.
I:17943;812;The performances are stellar from the entire cast.
I:17943;813;Christian Bale actually has the thankless task of keeping the hero from being completely marginalized by the film's fascinating villian, and he does a fine job.
I:17943;814;There is also strong work from Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Aaron Eckhart, Gary Oldman and Maggie Gylenhall.
I:17943;815;And they can do this while being amazingly entertaining.
I:17943;816;This was a Christmas present for my father and he was very satisfied with it.
I:17943;817;As someone who thoroughly enjoyed Nolan's previous Batman film, I felt confident he'd never be able to surpass it.
I:17943;818;The amazing acting (with one exception).
I:17943;819;It was a sheer joy to watch.
I:17943;820;The action was practically nonstop with enough plot twists, explosions, and funny lines to make one cringe and laugh at the same time.
I:17943;821;goers and comic book fans alike.
I:17943;822;He plays the cocky, rich, and uncompromising Bruce Wayne with the perfect amount of grace and toughness the role deserves.
I:17943;823;michael Caine (Children of Men) and Gary Oldman (Harry Potter) reprise their roles and do so with the talent we've all come to expect from these two fine actors.
I:17943;824;an addition to the cast was introduced with the arrival of Harvey Dent/Two.
I:17943;825;face's origins is masterfully pulled into the story and given ample screen time.
I:17943;826;stellar performance came from Maggie Gyllenhaal (Stranger Than Fiction) who replaced Katie Holmes (First Daughter) in the role of Rachel Dawes, Bruce Wayne's love interest.
I:17943;827;That's probably not a knock against Gyllenhaal considering the entire production held some of the strongest roles I've seen this year.
I:17943;828;It arrived in great condition and on time in new condition.
I:17943;829;hours and enjoy the fast action, one.
I:17943;830;Rachel: love interest or just a nice plant?
I:17943;831;Batman the dark knight is one of the greatest, if not the best, batman film of all time.
I:17943;832;But this is more than just a kids super hero movie.
I:17943;833;This movie has a lot of syspense that will leave you on the edge of your seat.
I:17943;834;The Joker is simply brilliant in this movie.
I:17943;835;The first movie with Michael Keaton was the best and it has steadily gotten worse over the years.
I:17943;836;The positive aspects of the movie was the special effects, the stunts, the cinematography and the equipment that Batman uses.
I:17943;837;This is one of the best deals I've gotten on amazon yet!
I:17943;838;I Would highly recommend it, its a great movie
I:17943;839;I enjoyed this movie but the hype and over.
I:17943;840;TDK wasn't even the best comic based film of the year.
I:17943;841;Yet, some people are calling it the greatest movie ever.
I:17943;842;He's simply great as the Joker.
I:17943;843;Don't get me wrong, I consider it an enjoyable, dark movie that deserves a spot among anyone's top five comic adaptation lists.
I:17943;844;It's captivating and keeps your attention all the way through even though it lags at the Two.
I:17943;845;to Romania* English, French and Spanish subtitles and audio* Great movie .
I:17943;846;This series is so much better than the Tim Burton adaptation.
I:17943;847;They all loved it of course.
I:17943;848;The Dark Knight is an epic in super hero movies.
I:17943;849;the story line is amazing, drawing some elements from Batman the Long Halloween and even some themes from the Killing Joke.
I:17943;850;The action and effects in the movie were terrific.
I:17943;851;The movie was more intense than its predecessor.
I:17943;852;The acting was superb especially by Heath Ledger as the Joker.
I:17943;853;pod was very awesome to see.
I:17943;854;I also found it quite interesting how Two.
I:17943;855;face played his part in the story line.
I:17943;856;Hans Zimmer's music score was great and made moments in the movie even better.
I:17943;857;Like all the Christian Bale Batmans, this is a memorable Batman story with great characters.
I:17943;858;It's worth it just to see Heath Ledger's Joker.
I:17943;859;Great price and he loved it.
I:17943;860;Arguably the best and most terrifying Joker of them all.
I:17943;861;A great snapshot of Batman's true sacrifice and heroism.
I:17943;862;"The Dark Knight is a superb, juggernaut of thrill ride of film
I:17943;863;Your eyes will be glued as every plot, every twist of storyline is revealed.
I:17943;864;But this is one film that's a wonderful treat and for those of you who saw Batman Begins this one is even better.
I:17943;865;The cast does a wonderful job and the most reason to go is the action/stunts in this film, hardly any CGI in this film which is a good thing, because a lot of time usually computer generated effects can bog down a good action picture and make it look cheesy or plain stupid, in which stunts (the real thing) can deliver the goods and let us not forget a the story this screenplay is top notch.
I:17943;866;So it's a winner all around along with Iron man this one is one of the hot tickets at your local theater this summer, you'll sure get an excellent bang for your buck on this picture.
I:17943;867;Let the geek inside you show through and have fun on this rollercoaster of a ride.
I:17943;868;I thought Jack Nicholson was the best villan actor, now I would say that heath ledger has taken that spot.
I:17943;869;Awesome movie, best of the trilogy.
I:17943;870;"the movie is enjoyable
I:17943;871;it's very big budget, and the production values are all right up there on the screen for all to see.
I:17943;872;"rate
I:17943;873;There was a broad and sweeping story arc in the first movie that simply isn't there in this one.
I:17943;874;A great first movie, in that case directed by Tim Burton at his peak.
I:17943;875;res picture is great, sound is good, lots of special features I haven't watched yet, etc.
I:17943;876;The second movie of the new set of Batman flicks (Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, and The Dark Knight Rises), The Dark Knight is not quite as good as the first, but is very cool nonetheless.
I:17943;877;They did a great job on turning Harvey Dent into Harvey Two.
I:17943;878;but overall, The Dark Knight was really good and I would recommend it to almost anybody.
I:17943;879;He should have to do every Batman movie from now on for as long as he lives because in this film he captures the very essence of Batman.
I:17943;880;It is a sight to behold!
I:17943;881;Love it love it love it!!!
I:17943;882;This is every bit as gripping and character.
I:17943;883;driven as its immediate predecessor.
I:17943;884;You have Christopher Nolan's masterful storytelling coupled, once again, with the outstanding talents of a first.
I:17943;885;The standout performance here, it should go without saying, is that of the late Heath Ledger.
I:17943;886;the overall tone of this movie is what ultimately makes it so very satisfying.
I:17943;887;The Dark Knight hits the bullseye, squarely and decisively.
I:17943;888;The Dark Knight has the best possible actors for all of its characters.
I:17943;889;Action packed, creepy, funny and all around entertaining.
I:17943;890;most people consider this the best Batman movie.
I:17943;891;what else can i say this movie is still one of the greatest movies yet.
I:17943;892;The best movie based on a comic book hero ever!!!
I:17943;893;There is no way they can top this.
I:17943;894;with great acting and a great story, Also great Action you have to see this.
I:17943;895;I'm not sure that I care as much for these darker versions as much as other people do but it's an entertaining movie nonetheless.
I:17943;896;Simply put, I highly recommend this movie to all Batman fans and all action movie fans.
I:17943;897;"His text said, ""That was the greatest movie I've ever seen."""
I:17943;898;It is simply that good.
I:17943;899;In the comics Batman and Bruce Wayne were big hulking guys.
I:17943;900;That helped with my suspension of disbelief.
I:17943;901;Making these guys heart throbby is obviously the idea of Hollywood suits.
I:17943;902;The movie is amazing, watch it.
I:17943;903;Reloaded the screen, and everything was fine.
I:17943;904;One of the best films ever made.
I:17943;905;the extra disc that discusses the making of the film really was amazing.
I:17943;906;i was in medical school on my psychiatry rotation when I received this movie and found the psychiatry presented by professionals who helped create Batman and the villains amazingly useful.
I:17943;907;I even went to work and discussed it with the psychiatrists.
I:17943;908;If you've ever studied antisocial behavior and personality disorders, you'll appreciate how much work went into this film and the acting that made it happen.
I:17943;909;it gave me a whole new perspective and appreciation for this film and I watch it all the time on my big screen TV even though it's so long.
I:17943;910;I get totally into it every time!
I:17943;911;When Christopher Nolan is behind a genre flick, you can rest assured it will kick some bootie!
I:17943;912;We had a genuine individual fighting the good fight.
I:17943;913;This movie was very exciting and well done.
I:17943;914;The special effects were terrific.
I:17943;915;the perfect ending image for the nihilistic Joker.
I:17943;916;heath Ledger is nothing short of brilliant with his chilling portrayal of the maleficent, unhinged Joker.
I:17943;917;this is the best comic.
I:17943;918;book movie I've ever seen.
I:17943;919;What with its shades of grey and complexity of characters, it transcends its black.
I:17943;920;One of the longer movies that you'll actually enjoy.
I:17943;921;Nolan's version of gotham and this world of Batman, is much darker than previous versions of Batman, but the pacing will keep you into the movie.
I:17943;922;The acting is great, the storyline and the character build up is very exciting.
I:17943;923;Its emotional, its fun, and it gets your heart rate going.
I:17943;924;This is one of my if not my favorite movie of all time!
I:17943;925;See it for yourself first if you haven't already.
I:17943;926;This masterpiece is absolutely brilliant from start to finish just like Batman Begins.
I:17943;927;I give major thanks to Chris Nolan and the entire cast:)
I:17943;928;"It looks amazing, and the IMAX scenes even look good on a 42"" tv."
I:17943;929;Sound is great, movie is great.
I:17943;930;Great deal on this movie!
I:17943;931;Awesome acting, special effects, plot.
I:17943;932;Probably the best movie I've seen this year, and definitely the best Batman!
I:17943;933;So I start talking to my friend, and he has all the special features that I would like to see, but they are on Blue Ray.
I:17943;934;Good TestDo you believe you are a good person?
I:17943;935;If you have you have, instead of using a four letter filth word to express disgust you have taken God's name, He that has given you your life, your family everything you hold precious to you and you've used it as a four letter filth word to express disgust.
I:17943;936;This is called blasphemy, and every idle word a man speaks he will give an account of it on the Day of Judgment.
I:17943;937;You know the basis of what's right and wrong, listen to your conscience and be honest with yourself.
I:17943;938;Think of how much you value your eyes.
I:17943;939;Do you believe that God is all loving and good, and therefore will overlook your sins?
I:17943;940;"And you stand up and say, ""Yes, judge I just have to say that I believe that you are a good man and therefore will let me go."""
I:17943;941;"The judge will probably say something like, ""You're right about one thing I am a good man."
I:17943;942;And because of my goodness I am going to see to it that justice is served.
I:17943;943;"Because of my goodness I am going to see to it that you are punished for what you have done."""
I:17943;944;You see God is love, but he is also righteous, holy, just and pure.
I:17943;945;"It is because He is good that by nature he must punish the wicked: liars, thieves, fornicators, etc. ""Do you not know that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God?"
I:17943;946;Your fine has been set at $500,000 or life imprisonment.
I:17943;947;And pays your fine in full.
I:17943;948;that's what happened, that's what God did for us 2,000 years ago!
I:17943;949;You won't be perfect but Jesus is perfect and he died for you and he will give you the power to overcome your sin.
I:17943;950;When you are born again you put your faith in Jesus Christ.
I:17943;951;The demons believe and they tremble, they know that's true.
I:17943;952;And you will become a new creation in Christ.
I:17943;953;please place your faith in Jesus as you would a parachute.
I:17943;954;thank you for listening to me and I will be praying for you.
I:17943;955;It came in great condition and worked perfectly.
I:17943;956;"Movie is fine, but digital copy product key had ""expired""."
I:17943;957;I just got this movie.
I:17943;958;Pros: The packaging is phenomenal!
I:17943;959;Its black and has Batman Ears.
I:17943;960;But I look forward to seeing how the movie was made and the other extra features.
I:17943;961;Loved all of the visual effects and the story / plot line.
I:17943;962;Heath Ledger was amazing as the Joker.
I:17943;963;I've wanted to see this movie since it came out in 2008 but never got the chance, I'm so glad that i finally got to see it.
I:17943;964;Batman Begins introduced us to the troubled man that is Bruce Wayne and told the story of how he becomes The Batman.
I:17943;965;"Batman Begins, although very well put together and the story being told brilliantly
I:17943;966;The Dark Knight repairs those problems and gives us a movie of equal length, that manages to hold my attention throughout.
I:17943;967;This is to give you, the reader a fair and open opinion of the movie for which you can place your own opinion.
I:17943;968;He's just interested in creating chaos and he breeds a new class of criminal.
I:17943;969;The voice, the look and the body language are all done superbly by Ledger.
I:17943;970;They blend together brilliantly in order to create a very believable psychopath.
I:17943;971;"He wins my vote in his role as Harvey Dent
I:17943;972;"face"" is inspiring and really seals him as a legitimate actor and a legitimate role."
I:17943;973;It's a much more likable role this time around and has bigger impact when confronted with the Harvey Dent alter.
I:17943;974;"face""The Verdict: I honestly love this film."
I:17943;975;From the opening we're treated to a great bank robbery that gives us the genius and craziness of Joker.
I:17943;976;stop genius picture and something that lives up to the hype.
I:17943;977;The role of Ledger lives up to the bill and is something that could win Heath his first and only Oscar.
I:17943;978;e are the best of 2008 so far, in my opinion.
I:17943;979;They're certainly the only two I thought were worth going to the theater to see and the only two worth owning.
I:17943;980;e, I still feel that way about that film.
I:17943;981;The Dark Knight is a very inventive film, though somewhat misnamed.
I:17943;982;Best Sound, Best Art Direction, etc.
I:17943;983;How Christopher Nolan and His team developed the new Bat.
I:17943;984;suit and the amazing Bat.
I:17943;985;shot on the largest format possible .
I:17943;986;depth characters and makes you wanting more.
I:17943;987;Gary tells Harvey something, and I was surprised Harvey responded back.
I:17943;988;The Dark Knight is the most realistic thus far of any movie based on a comic book.
I:17943;989;Not surprisingly, this realistic portrayal (along with good writing and acting, of course) has produced an amazing film.
I:17943;990;goers and fans of the Batman character alike.
I:17943;991;After all, when comparing Schumacher's Batman and Robin to the 90s animated series of Batman, it is the animated series that is more realistic, even though it exists in a 2.
I:17943;992;What Nolan has done to instill this film with realism is to give just about every action a consequence.
I:17943;993;A new district attorney, Harvey Dent, has arrived and has won the love of Bruce Wayne's love interest, Rachel Dawes.
I:17943;994;And the Joker is all about breaking rules, and he challenges Batman to win his war on crime without breaking his own rules.
I:17943;995;Heath Ledger has created one of the scariest villains put on film.
I:17943;996;Still, he is physically no match for Batman and his suits and gadgets.
I:17943;997;It's one terror to the next.
I:17943;998;The sense of fear in this movie works so well because it surprises people who expect comic book movies and action movies to not care about consequences.
I:17943;999;handed of the movies to pose such self.
I:17943;1000;But it is by far the scariest.
I:17943;1001;Great movie, great visuals, and of course great sound.
I:17943;1002;An interesting dark plot with even Batman thinking about things.
I:17943;1003;Some think it is the best acting job ever.
I:17943;1004;Who knows about that, but it is exceptional for sure.
I:17943;1005;issue building, then just see it at IMAX or at least a modern theater with a good sound system.
I:17943;1006;It goes on and on, well after you think it is near the logical ending.
I:17943;1007;That is why it is so suitable for home viewing.
I:17943;1008;Love the new Batman movies.
I:17943;1009;Heath Ledger's performance is fantastic.
I:17943;1010;Greatest movie villain of all time.
I:17943;1011;A perfect score for this movie.
I:17943;1012;If you are a collector you must have it!
I:17943;1013;Another good edition of one of the best DC character.
I:17943;1014;This is a 2008 movie.
I:17943;1015;It is better than expected, but most of the hype is because of the perfect acting of the Joker.
I:17943;1016;Lots of action and a surprise ending.
I:17943;1017;old and his friends love it.
I:17943;1018;I love this batman movie, it's so far my favorite of them all.
I:17943;1019;Special effects are great and Heath Ledger does an incredible job playing the joker.
I:17943;1020;Excellent movie I can watch over and over.
I:17943;1021;The Amazon Prime download is great as I can watch it on my ipad when ever I am traveling without internet access.
I:17943;1022;Great movie lots of action and spins in the plot.
I:17943;1023;A great adventure comic movie we really enjoyed a ton.
I:17943;1024;Of all the Batman films, this one takes the cake.
I:17943;1025;There is a version with Batman's scowl, but I prefer this one.
I:17943;1026;He would have done amazing in the next sequel.
I:17943;1027;I saw this movie in school 2 days ago and the teacher has the 2 disc special edition that appears to be vandilized by The Joker.
I:17943;1028;I perfer this one much more and the mask will look nice on my counter.
I:17943;1029;I enjoyed the movie it was entertaining and did keep me guessing as to what was going to happen next.
I:17943;1030;Quickly shipped and very very good price.
I:17943;1031;This movie is just really one of the greatest that I've seen in 2008.
I:17943;1032;This is definately one of the best remakes (or re.
I:17943;1033;There has been a lot of batman movies, some good and some not so good.
I:17943;1034;This one is one of the good ones.
I:17943;1035;With that being said, Christian Bale and Heath Ledger deliver there best perfomance in this action packed feature.
I:17943;1036;It was a thrill ride, and yes, more freedom for the producer this time around.
I:17943;1037;I loved the movie, only one minor thing, Batmans voice.
I:17943;1038;Anyway, well worth to own, the movie has plenty to enjoy, over and over again.
I:17943;1039;Love the action in this film and Everyone does a great job and really brings their A game.
I:17943;1040;While the first movie established the Caped Crusader's origins and spiritual training (loved that part), Dark Knight gets right down to the business of fighting villains.
I:17943;1041;Saving Harvey Dent could be an accurate alternative title for the Dark Knight.
I:17943;1042;If you're thinking that there must be something corrupt lurking under Aaron Eckhardt's square jaw and blonde good looks, well, you're right.
I:17943;1043;the heroes and villains (at least the big ones) are clearly drawn enough, but there's a lot going on and the Joker orchestrates all of it.
I:17943;1044;The special FX are fantastic.
I:17943;1045;I loved the way they flipped the 18.
I:17943;1046;I liked the Joker's character best.
I:17943;1047;Once you've had a brush with a sociopath you recognize them immediately and the Joker's lines are true to form.
I:17943;1048;And you know how he got the smiley scars, right?
I:17943;1049;wheeler all by himself just by breathing in its direction.
I:17943;1050;One is the movie with BD live.
I:17943;1051;The other disc contains special features.
I:17943;1052;So, I finally saw The Dark Knight.
I:17943;1053;On some fronts it utterly succeeds.
I:17943;1054;For those who don't know this film the Joker is deftly painted as Satan incarnate, and his resulting efforts at destruction are fully befitting the Evil One himself.
I:17943;1055;It was very good action entertainment, and it packed a message anyone over the age of 14 should be able to grasp, but it was in no way worth the $500 million it earned at the box office.
I:17943;1056;I think the American audience has lost it's respect for real art.
I:17943;1057;But, really, watch the original Star Wars again and recognize why these films were so good to begin with.
I:17943;1058;That film did plenty with a not so obvious cast, unusual artistry in the production of action, and a budget that went for somewhat less than $20 million, even well done for 1977.
I:17943;1059;In many ways it did, but the majesty of it is still unparalleled in film to this very day.
I:17943;1060;It's a really great movie.
I:17943;1061;The greatest performance Heath Ledger do.
I:17943;1062;the movie was amazing ive seen it twice on the big screen cant wait to see it on blu.
I:17943;1063;Besides the movie, that we all know is a very good movie, the special staff that comes here is awesome.
I:17943;1064;I was excited and scared at the same time.
I:17943;1065;heath Ledger deserves an Oscar!
I:17943;1066;This film is deep, dark and full of interesting twists.
I:17943;1067;It's entertaining and thrilling to see the Joker repeatedly outwitted Batman and other people.
I:17943;1068;the love story is tormenting.
I:17943;1069;The action is quick and breathtaking.
I:17943;1070;The special effects are eye.
I:17943;1071;I love the psychological scenes.
I:17943;1072;This movie is perfect in all terms in my opinion.
I:17943;1073;Hands down the greatest trilogy of all.
I:17943;1074;Bought this for a gift.
I:17943;1075;With regards the movie itself, it is undeniable the best in the trilogy.
I:17943;1076;ray experience of The Dark Knight will blow your mind!
I:17943;1077;Nothing to say, just Great!!!
I:17943;1078;Beautiful Batpod and very good movie.
I:17943;1079;The three are successful for a while.
I:17943;1080;And the late Heath Ledger truly is a revelation in the role.
I:17943;1081;He reminds me a of the great gangster villains from the past played by the likes of Edward G. Robinson and James Cagney, but much more twisted.
I:17943;1082;In other words, the Joker I've always wanted to see.
I:17943;1083;aaron Eckhart is perfect as the handsome, charming and earnest prosecuter Harvey Dent.
I:17943;1084;His face born for campaign ads and his political future limitless.
I:17943;1085;Yet there's more than one side to Dent, and Eckhart also brings that certain edge to Dent which lends just the right intensity.
I:17943;1086;His may be the underrated performance in the film.
I:17943;1087;His Dent not only has a story arc well known to fans of the comic, but he basically becomes the heart of the film.
I:17943;1088;the rest of the main cast consists of mostly returning members: Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman are just as impressive as they were in BATMAN BEGINS.
I:17943;1089;Maggie Gyllenhaal steps in as Rachel Dawes and she comes across as a more mature version of the character than did Katie Holmes in BEGINS.
I:17943;1090;She does a great job and, in at least one scene, breaks my heart.
I:17943;1091;tHE DARK KNIGHT has plenty of action, with mercifully few CGI effects.
I:17943;1092;And fight scenes you can actually see (especially on my Blu.
I:17943;1093;The music is rousing, tragic and scary.
I:17943;1094;The cinematography is both intense and breathtaking.
I:17943;1095;The screenplay is clever, complex and almost novelistic, with dialogue that doesn't insult your intelligence.
I:17943;1096;and this is definitely a multi.
I:17943;1097;layered film thanks to Christopher Nolan's bold direction and his insistence on telling a good story.
I:17943;1098;I thought his BATMAN BEGINS was excellent.
I:17943;1099;He pieced together a superhero story and turned it into a dark, disturbing, tragic, exciting masterpiece.
I:17943;1100;It's one of those great Batman graphic novels come to cinematic life.
I:17943;1101;It was just as good as the first.
I:17943;1102;Christian Bale is great, as is the supporting cast.
I:17943;1103;It is a must watch.
I:17943;1104;Heath Ledger works feverishly as the Joker (the intensity of his commitment is the best thing about his performance), and there are times when his black.
I:17943;1105;ringed eyes take on a hurt expression, like a wounded raccoon's, that is unexpectedly touching.
I:17943;1106;Well worth the money (in terms of the MOVIE itself)!
I:17943;1107;It incorporates tons of action and is complemented by compelling dialogue.
I:17943;1108;Like I imagine many others, it's holiday season and we decided to take in a few movies.
I:17943;1109;the story line was good, but what made this movie great or parts of it great was Heath Ledger.
I:17943;1110;Much in the same manner that in Tombstone Val Kilmer who got robbed did as well!
I:17943;1111;This is definitely a movie that is worth seeing and a fitting movie to be in the Batman legacy and made even more so by the performace Heath Ledger delivered.
I:17943;1112;And not his performance which I found outstanding and true to any one that actually reads these things called comics.
I:17943;1113;all the actors in this did a wonderful job and Heath if someone had to go on, left a performance I am sure seals his standing as an incredible actor.
I:17943;1114;This is my favorite Batman movie yet.
I:17943;1115;Jokers performance is great, Ledger's role is definitely one to remember.
I:17943;1116;I would recommend this movie to others.
I:17943;1117;Some scenes a bit gruesome!
I:17943;1118;bought this one to add to my action collection of blu rays and it goes well with my collection.
I:17943;1119;This was a great movie .
I:17943;1120;keeps you on the edge of your seat!
I:17943;1121;Powerful performance by Heath Ledger.
I:17943;1122;While the mask is not as nice as the Side Show busts that came with the Universal Monsters box set it is still a cool collectible piece to add to your Dark Knight or Joker collection.
I:17943;1123;The set also comes with the Two.
I:17943;1124;i really enjoyed this movie.
I:17943;1125;casting, acting, special effects, cinematography.
I:17943;1126;I also thought Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, and Maggie Gyllenhaal were superb in their roles along with Aaron Eckhart.
I:17943;1127;i loved the special effects .
I:17943;1128;Sequels aren't always the best, but since Batman Begins was one of the best movies I've ever seen, I held out great hope that they'd do a good job with The Dark Knight.
I:17943;1129;Heath Ledger was epic and again Christian Bale's performance was stunning.
I:17943;1130;I predict it will be remembered at Oscar time and I hope for more than just Heath Ledger's performance, he should win that Oscar.
I:17943;1131;"Mr. Ledger's performance can't compete in the slightest with that of Jack Nicholson's superb turn in the role of ""The Joker""!"
I:17943;1132;"After such exquisitely beautiful talented actresses such as Kim Basinger and Michele Pfeiffer in the previous ""Batman"" films, and the lovely and talented Katie Holmes, it was disturbing to be subjected to such all round ugliness."
I:17943;1133;Watching her attempt to maneuver around in an evening gown was one of the few hilarious moments of relief.
I:17943;1134;Were there no beautiful and talented actresses available for this role?
I:17943;1135;"A film for diehard ""Batman"" fans only."
I:17943;1136;simply put, the best comic movie ever made.
I:17943;1137;i always thought jack's joker from thim burtons version was great for that era in the 80's.
I:17943;1138;but heaths version fits just right withn todays world dealing with terrorists and madness in a grand scale.
I:17943;1139;disc edition because the bonus features on that are nothing spectacular.
I:17943;1140;acted, and insanely overhyped film.
I:17943;1141;I'm not a huge movie buff, but my favorites are almost always intelligent, stylized, off.
I:17943;1142;I found the Joker and Harvey Dent much more memorable, interesting, multi.
I:17943;1143;While Batman is aloof and guarded, and the Joker is extroverted, daring, and well.
I:17943;1144;making, and views on humanity.
I:17943;1145;I highly recommend this film to anyone who digs thought.
I:17943;1146;I love the story very close to the comic book.
I:17943;1147;ray is the way to see this movie.
I:17943;1148;This movie is by far the best movie I have ever seen.
I:17943;1149;Not just the best Batman movie ever, but the best movie ever.
I:17943;1150;I have been a Batman fan since I was old enough to read and I read my first Batman comic.
I:17943;1151;As a huge fan I was happy to see that this movie stayed as close to the comics as a movie can.
I:17943;1152;The story was great and the action even better.
I:17943;1153;There are a few discrepancies between how Two Face was born between comic mythos and the movie but it still was a great story.
I:17943;1154;The casting is perfect and Christopher Nolan is the best director the Batman franchise has had.
I:17943;1155;He was the perfect Joker and It is heart breaking to see him pass.
I:17943;1156;The sound is incredible and makes you feel like you are in the middle of the action.
I:17943;1157;One of which is the hour long special from the history channel called Batman Tech.
I:17943;1158;It is well worth it to get this movie because of the great Blu.
I:17943;1159;ray features, and because the movie is worth it a million times over.
I:17943;1160;I recommend this to anyone who loves a great action film.
I:17943;1161;Great movie, Great seller, even better price.
I:17943;1162;ordered on 12.23.2011 and received it on 12.24.2011 !!
I:17943;1163;great movie shipping was fast.
I:17943;1164;Really an amazing piece of work.
I:17943;1165;The movie is great, but I wont' review the movie that's subjective.
I:17943;1166;The rest of the movie is filmed on a normal camera and is wide screen.
I:17943;1167;i would recommend this Blu.
I:17943;1168;I personally love the third one as the perfect conclusion to the trilogy.
I:17943;1169;That being said I thought it a good movie with an interesting plot and outcome and I would recommend it for a family with older kids.
I:17943;1170;If you haven't seen this movie, well then it's about time you do.
I:17943;1171;When we think batman lots of images come to us,maybe it is robin,cat woman,and the joker.
I:17943;1172;well in this movie you will always think the true joker has died.
I:17943;1173;to heath ledgers memory will last forever for taking a role that so many have played,and making them say so that is how you do it.
I:17943;1174;This is one of my all time favorite movies.
I:17943;1175;acting, special effects, storyline, everything.
I:17943;1176;ray makes it that much better.
I:17943;1177;I almost enjoyed it at home better than the theater.
I:17943;1178;Great story and fantastic effects.
I:17943;1179;Same hold true for Bale as Batman
I:17943;1180;then of course, Nolan had the brilliant idea to cast Ledger as JOKER.
I:17943;1181;This, alone, makes Ledger's portrayal of the JOKER heartbreakingly brilliant.
I:17943;1182;He moves beyond what a normal actor would have done with the part and becomes part of the viewers psyche.
I:17943;1183;What a great cast and story line.
I:17943;1184;The best of the Batman series by far.
I:17943;1185;"Everyone seems to think the greatest strength of ""The Dark Knight"" is that it surpasses the ""Batman"" comic book origins."
I:17943;1186;I think it's the greatest weakness.
I:17943;1187;"I thought ""Batman"" was supposed to be a comic book, an ongoing story that could only exist in outlandish DC Comic magazines."
I:17943;1188;I want that because that's where Batman truly belongs.
I:17943;1189;"Nolan has started an entirely new film franchise, beginning in 2005 with ""Batman Begins,"" another entertaining but vastly overrated film."
I:17943;1190;The film revolves around the idea that a fine line exists between good and evil, one that Wayne threatens to cross every time his alter ego searches for crime to fight.
I:17943;1191;Christian Bale's strong performance as the Caped Crusader makes this inner struggle perfectly clear.
I:17943;1192;"i'm sure a lot will be said about Ledger's next to last performance
I:17943;1193;Indeed, he captured the Joker's insanity perfectly, with his messy makeup and bizarre voice and demonic cackles.
I:17943;1194;Dent has fallen in love with Assistant D. a. Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal), once Bruce Wayne's love interest.
I:17943;1195;Both she and Dent begin the film as strong characters that hold true to what they believe in.
I:17943;1196;If only these ideas were explored in a film that was true to its origins.
I:17943;1197;Still, the cinematography is wonderful, the action is satisfying, and many of the actors are perfectly suited for a superhero film, such as Michael Caine as Alfred and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox.
I:17943;1198;I'll go ahead and give it four stars.
I:17943;1199;in my mind, that distinction stays with Tim Burton's original film.
I:17943;1200;Christopher Nolan has somehow found a way to trump his previous success with Batman Begins and remakes the super.
I:17943;1201;hero genre in the process, changing it from a simple battle between men in tights to something deeper, darker, and oh so much more interesting, which is saying quite a bit, because Batman Begins was an excellent film.
I:17943;1202;the plot of The Dark Knight, one of the best.
I:17943;1203;Throughout he puts Batman and the rest of Gotham through a series of moral quandries and situations to test their ethics (and not incidentally provide some amusement for himself).
I:17943;1204;this film is unlike any previous super.
I:17943;1205;man 2, X. men 2 and this summer's other great super.
I:17943;1206;It tears apart the conventions of the super.
I:17943;1207;hero world and peers, darkly, into our own world, showing a post.9/11 super.
I:17943;1208;"there are serious layers to this movie, and a depth absent in most films, let alone ""genre"" pieces like this one."
I:17943;1209;You'll laugh at some of what he does, but a lot of that will be nervous laughter.
I:17943;1210;It won't win, but it should, and probably will be, nominated.
I:17943;1211;one final note, do NOT take your children to this movie.
I:17943;1212;This is an adult film with adult themes to it.
I:17943;1213;This is a Great condition Blue Ray for such a Great Price!
I:17943;1214;It was a perfect Christmas gift!
I:17943;1215;this movie was the best in the series.
I:17943;1216;I was very happy to get it.
I:17943;1217;Whenever he's in the costume, he puts on this gravely voice that is so over the top, it totally destroys any scene he has to speak in.
I:17943;1218;Phenomenal every time I see it love this movie I would recommend the whole trilogy to any batman fan out there!
I:17943;1219;The Dark Knight keeps you on the edge of your seat with twists and excitement.
I:17943;1220;When you can get a movie that is really cheap that you will watch repeatedly, it's worth it.
I:17943;1221;I've seen this movie twice now, and honestly I believe this movie is already one of the top movies of all time.
I:17943;1222;This movie is faithful to the original creation and it's much better.
I:17943;1223;batman, played wonderfully by Christian Bale, of course is the protector of Gothmam City, a fictional version of New York City.
I:17943;1224;the action and fighting scenes are very well done.
I:17943;1225;It's extremely enjoyable, but it's also a very thoughtful movie, which is why I think it'll stand up as one of the best of all time.
I:17943;1226;This undertone of thoughtfulness is what makes this movie absolutely engaging and amazing in my opinion.
I:17943;1227;"Dark story line, continuing the ""serious"" Batman venue."
I:17943;1228;This is a great movie that provides a worthy end to the Dark Knight trilogy.
I:17943;1229;All movie fans, not just comic heads would enjoy the film.
I:17943;1230;this is truly the only way to enjoy this movie.
I:17943;1231;"This is one of my favorite movies
I:17943;1232;What a wonderful age we live in.
I:17943;1233;In addition, some Focus Points were very very interesting.
I:17943;1234;I'm sure most people bought this movie hoping to see some tribute to Heath Ledger's amazing turn as the Joker, infused with perhaps some of Bale's own thoughts on returning to this role and how he felt facing this new enemy, and the rest of the cast coming back for a 2nd run.
I:17943;1235;SOOOOO not worth the price if not for the fact that this movie was so brilliant.
I:17943;1236;Looks great, works, and is for sale at great price.
I:17943;1237;My kids, 14, 11, 11, liked it a lot!
I:17943;1238;One of the best of the Batman series.
I:17943;1239;en Conlusion:Excelente film, Mucho contenido extra, BD Live.
I:17943;1240;Most of all, I love the themes in this movie.
I:17943;1241;It's a study of good versus evil.
I:17943;1242;You get the incredible talent of all involved, from writers to cast to crew, lots of suspense.you get it all in one package, and walk away with well.
I:17943;1243;crafted messages that actually do society some good instead of ripping it apart.
I:17943;1244;I saw in the theatre and I had to have my own copy!
I:17943;1245;packed from the opening until the closing!!!
I:17943;1246;Shows great and is brand new.
I:17943;1247;I bought this for my girlfriend (big fan of Joker) and she loved it.
I:17943;1248;A true rebel without a cause!
I:17943;1249;Perfect cast, fantastic acting, intresting in almost all aspects.
I:17943;1250;This is a much better movie than Batman Begins and I much prefer the recast of Rachel but ultimately, it's just an okay movie.
I:17943;1251;The look of the film is very dark and serious and adult but the storytelling is actually simple and somewhat light.
I:17943;1252;I certainly don't feel that Rachel's character is that important to Bruce Wayne.
I:17943;1253;I definitely endorse getting the widescreen version of this film.
I:17943;1254;received it timely and of course loved the movie.
I:17943;1255;it has spectacular acting, directing and special effect that appear real.
I:17943;1256;"heath Ledger should be remembered and honored for his fantastic portrayal of ""The Joker""!"
I:17943;1257;I believe that this is the best acting i have seen in a very very long time!
I:17943;1258;probably the best I have ever seen!
I:17943;1259;Who ever seen the movie knows that Heath is the movie!
I:17943;1260;Excellent movie, got to watch the digital version before the movie even shipped.
I:17943;1261;"After all, ""Titanic"" was the same way and it's directly in the way of this film being the most successful film ever and people haven't exactly been kind to James Cameron's mammoth over time."
I:17943;1262;With a stellar case, exciting action and one of the most iconic villain performances in all of cinema, you can't exactly go wrong against this film.
I:17943;1263;one of the central themes explored in the film is the idea of good people trying to live in an imperfect world and the people that are on the extreme sides and those that can move over to the other side.
I:17943;1264;"But while it did have its issues, ""Batman Begins"" felt like finally somebody GOT a comic book movie and knew how to not only tell the story well but also deliver the kicks that fans want to see."
I:17943;1265;"along with Arnold Schwarzenegger's ""Terminator"" role and Sigourney Weaver and ""Ripley"", you can pretty much add Heath Ledger's role onto the list as a performance that will become not only iconic and legendary but even imitated and could even bring up imitators and naturally, Halloween costumes."
I:17943;1266;The machinations of the planning of capturing criminals and the roundabouts and sleight.
I:17943;1267;And let's face it, as great as he is as Bruce Wayne, his voice as Batman is near awful and you half expect him to start coughing and clearing his throat everytime he speaks.
I:17943;1268;I hoped to walk into my local movie theater and partake of a movie that would be awesome, inspiring, and breathtaking at the same time.
I:17943;1269;It was hard to do, and in the end, the result was and is something more than satisfying.
I:17943;1270;It was an experience I will hold onto for years to come.
I:17943;1271;"i am not going to spoil the ride for those who still have yet to see this film by divulging details that they could see for themselves, but ""The Dark Knight,"" as far as I am concern, is a visionary masterpiece that appeals to just more than the imagination."
I:17943;1272;This film has quite a bit of everything: drama, dark comedy, love, pain, suffering, and most importantly, truth.
I:17943;1273;Higher above all the emotional tones, truth really resonates with this film because of the insightful question that it asks: how close to the line is our society from dangling over an edge into chaos or to walking through a stable field of social serenity?
I:17943;1274;The Batman character, from the comics to the big screen, is such an attractive character because he chooses to answer this question by helping society walk through a serene field instead.
I:17943;1275;Christopher Nolan captures these riddles and places them with great avail in this film.
I:17943;1276;For these reasons, I agree with the countless other fans who enjoyed this film and offer my own high praise.
I:17943;1277;christian Bale is exceptional as Bruce Wayne / Batman.
I:17943;1278;Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman continue to shine in their supporting, heartfelt roles as Wayne's trusted confidantes, Alfred and Lucius Fox, respectively.
I:17943;1279;Even Maggie Gyllenhaal is inspiring as Rachel Dawes.
I:17943;1280;Eckhart's performance is very exceptional.
I:17943;1281;He depicts a man whose only ambition is to bring a true sense of justice into his dark world.
I:17943;1282;Eckhart really makes you believe it, which is interesting in itself considering his character's catch phrase.
I:17943;1283;"His ""Joker"" is funny, frightening, psychotic, and ironically, genius."
I:17943;1284;Ledger's performance keeps you guessing to what the Joker will do next, and his performance raises the bar for how we can look at this character.
I:17943;1285;Ledger's death is tragic, and it is a tribute to his acting ability and career to have starred in this film.
I:17943;1286;"I wanted to see something that I had not seen before, and frankly, ""The Dark Knight"" is just that."
I:17943;1287;Go and enjoy it for yourself.
I:17943;1288;"There's ""Gotham Uncovered: the creation of a scene"" which was mildly interesting, but nothing news worthy."
I:17943;1289;"As far as ""superhero"" movies go its probably the best I have seen so far."
I:17943;1290;The joker made this movie great.
I:17943;1291;"He redefined the concept of ""arch."
I:17943;1292;It brought back some good memories.
I:17943;1293;What a great movie and what great acting from all involved.
I:17943;1294;The Kindle Fire is perfect for watching videos.
I:17943;1295;If so, I should have picked it up as well.
I:17943;1296;I hooked my work PC's speakers to the Fire and rocked out to Batman, Two.
I:17943;1297;Ready for my next viewing!
I:17943;1298;far transending the genre into a truly imaginative frightening film.
I:17943;1299;especially for such a film, that I can almost believe that they may be on to something.
I:17943;1300;Of course its the best superhero movie ever made!
I:17943;1301;By far the best batman movies ever!!
I:17943;1302;It makes for one of those movies that you want to see over and over again to pick up everything.
I:17943;1303;This will remain one of my favorite movies of all times.
I:17943;1304;The Dark Knight is so well directed and acted that it easily grabs attentions and maintains it throughout the entire film.
I:17943;1305;Ledger does an amazing job and really embodies the psychotic nature of the Joker.
I:17943;1306;ray, the visual effects are outstanding!
I:17943;1307;Highly worth adding to the collection and easily rewatched!
I:17943;1308;(Part of the way through, I kept hoping that Spider.
I:17943;1309;My son likes this movie.
I:17943;1310;It was a good price for the product.
I:17943;1311;, this is a worthy sequel and I was pleased to see Gordon get more screen time.
I:17943;1312;The detailed clarity of this film is what the blu.
I:17943;1313;Bravo to the powers to be at Warner Bros. for duplicating this feature on blu.
I:17943;1314;Ledger's performance as the Joker, escalates Batman's nemesis to a level never explored, short of the masterful display done by Jack Nicholson in Tim Burton's rendition of the series.
I:17943;1315;ever since Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale were hired to continue the franchise, their work as director and principal actor has reinvigorated the series with a realism and grittiness that truly defines the Black Knight.
I:17943;1316;the Dark Knight is definitely one of the best, if not the best, in featuring the Batman film series.
I:17943;1317;He takes the insanity to a whole new level for the joker.
I:17943;1318;It is an electrifying film
I:17943;1319;"Forget about all the ""layered"" stuff we keep reading about."
I:17943;1320;It just has to go.
I:17943;1321;The Batman I always knew was a guy who was vulnerable and not afraid to show it.
I:17943;1322;heath Ledger was fine as the Joker.
I:17943;1323;He does manage to do some very Joker like things in the film.
I:17943;1324;maybe the best Character and best acting job in the film though was Harvey Dent/Two Face.
I:17943;1325;The most accurate (along with some refinements etc for the screen) by far.
I:17943;1326;Great job on Two Face.
I:17943;1327;funny thing abut this film.
I:17943;1328;"I enjoyed much of it but underneath it all I just couldn't shake the thoughts of ""that just isn't Batman."""
I:17943;1329;He has endured now for close to 70 years so I guess they have done something right.
I:17943;1330;the nature of good and evil thing.
I:17943;1331;(See the movie Heat, where arch.
I:17943;1332;villain DeNiro has coffee with good.
I:17943;1333;guy cop Pacino, and the idea is, they're both professionals who shoot people.
I:17943;1334;I watched the opening bank job over and over, it looks great in Blu Ray shot in IMAX format.
I:17943;1335;As with the Spielberg crapfests, I was told how wonderful excrement like Brokeback Mountain and Crash were.
I:17943;1336;So, was this the greatest film of all time?
I:17943;1337;It goes from a possibly good film, in its first hour, to a barely passable one in the span of the last hour or so.
I:17943;1338;In ten years, few people will care about this film, and Ledger's Oscar win will go down as one of those great WTF?
I:17943;1339;The Dark Knight is even more intense, violent and psychologically complex than its predecessor.
I:17943;1340;But The Joker is a master of manipulation and he's counting on Batman to up the ante.
I:17943;1341;He makes himself the central figure in Gotham's criminal underworld and soon even members of the mob become fearful of him.
I:17943;1342;He sees that Gotham needs a new hero, a leader who will in any situation do the right thing for the people.
I:17943;1343;He believes Harvey Dent to be that hero.
I:17943;1344;Harvey is an idealistic D. a. and a social crusader.
I:17943;1345;If so The Joker will only be happy to exploit it.
I:17943;1346;And he does so in grand fashion.
I:17943;1347;Is it just a matter of time before even Batman's corrupted?As with the first film, The Dark Knight features an extraordinary cast including Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne / Batman, Heath Ledger as The Joker, Michael Caine as Alfred, Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel Dawes, Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent, Gary Oldman as Commissioner Gordon, Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, and Cillian Murphy as The Scarecrow.
I:17943;1348;Every member of the cast is great, but especially Maggie Gyllenhaal who replaces Katie Holmes as Bruce Wayne's love and Heath Ledger who is phenomenal as the psychopathic Joker.
I:17943;1349;The Dark Knight is an amazing follow.
I:17943;1350;"up to Batman Begins and takes the ""comic book film"" to a whole new level of depth."
I:17943;1351;It's easily one of the darkest superhero movies* I've seen, but that's what makes it brilliant.
I:17943;1352;A great comic book has twisted.
I:17943;1353;Heath and Christian make this movie what it is superb!
I:17943;1354;I would recommend this and the other two movies in the series if you're a batman fan!
I:17943;1355;grossing films of all time, and was suddenly declared the best film of all time by Internet Movie Database voters, and I just had to see what all the fuss was about and have my say.
I:17943;1356;"Just call this movie ""The Joker"" and be done with it because, really, even Two."
I:17943;1357;To me, the huge success and unabashed acclaim of The Dark Knight is merely a symptom of the generally poor entertainment being produced by Hollywood these days.
I:17943;1358;When someone comes out with a movie that is better than average, it is instantly hailed as a modern classic.
I:17943;1359;This was extremely entertaining all the way through, which is quite a statement for a film that is two.
I:17943;1360;ray transfer also is terrific.
I:17943;1361;It only enhances the fun of viewing this film.
I:17943;1362;this also is a great film to enjoy audibly with some fantastic surround sound.
I:17943;1363;In fact, the sound on this B. d is as good as the visuals.
I:17943;1364;there are absolutely no dry spots in this fascinating story.
I:17943;1365;It's just supposed to entertain, and that it does.
I:17943;1366;Every scene in which Ledger appeared was riveting.
I:17943;1367;His speech, mannerisms and his dialog were fantastic.
I:17943;1368;For the latter, I have to commend the screen writers who gave Ledger some great lines!
I:17943;1369;The work that they put in ot this movie was outstanding.
I:17943;1370;The Dark Knight is destined to be the greatest Batman film ever.
I:17943;1371;Perhaps even the best superhero film ever.
I:17943;1372;Perhaps even the greatest action film ever: in an era when anything is possible with CGI effects, director Nolan goes back to the old.
I:17943;1373;He flips an actual 18.
I:17943;1374;That's actually Christian Bale standing on top of a 100.
I:17943;1375;"This use of ""real"" effects/stunts is vital in a Batman movie, because the entire premise of the Batman is that he's a ""normal"" guy without superpowers."
I:17943;1376;This is the first key to why the Dark Knight is so great.
I:17943;1377;"He is the ""main"" villain in the Batman pantheon, but he's always been problemmatic."
I:17943;1378;Ledger's performance is certainly very good .
I:17943;1379;worthy of the Oscar he won for the role.
I:17943;1380;consistent version of the Joker, finally making him a worthy main foil for Batman.
I:17943;1381;i think this film is most effective on first viewing .
I:17943;1382;I really enjoyed the gradual unfolding of the Joker's master plan from seemingly random events.
I:17943;1383;I also enjoyed the relationship (often stormy) between the levels of Gotham's law enforcement .
I:17943;1384;Hence, this is a good Blu.
I:17943;1385;In addition, there are some nifty extras, the most interesting are the breakdowns on the action sequences, where you get to see the stuntmen in action.
I:17943;1386;"There are also a number of ""Gotham Tonight"" interviews ."
I:17943;1387;a local public affairs program for the people of Gotham.
I:17943;1388;It features the characters of the movie (Dent, Bruce Wayne, etc.) basically giving their back stories.
I:17943;1389;The acting is a little forced in these, but they are entertaining nonetheless.
I:17943;1390;The Dark Knight arrived with tremendous hype and incredibly, it lived up to all of it.
I:17943;1391;perfect cast (Heath Ledger is phenomenal as the joker), outstanding writing, and a compelling vision is that it bypasses the normal fantasy element of the superhero genre and makes it all terrifyingly real.
I:17943;1392;"The 2 disc layout is great with great special features including interviews and ""making of"" the movie."
I:17943;1393;the cast returns from Batman Begins creating an astonishing feel for the story.
I:17943;1394;But the true star is Ledger who is fantastic as the Joker, a volcanic, truly frightening force of evil.
I:17943;1395;cowriter Christopher Nolan follows his critically acclaimed Batman Begins with an even better sequel that sets itself apart from notable superhero movies because of its sheer emotional impact and striking sense of realism.
I:17943;1396;A fantastic film for the ages and is sure to be noted at the Oscars this year.
I:17943;1397;I love how easy amazon is to get movies from.
I:17943;1398;I will continue to use amazon in the future
I:17943;1399;Jack Nicholson is still a cool joker, and Tim Burton is still one of the greatest directors in Hollywood.
I:17943;1400;but Christopher Nolan's directorial interpretation of Batman is much, much, darker, and Heath Ledger's joker is far more clever and devious in a tragic way that is almost bizaar considering that the actor's death shortly followed the making of this film.
I:17943;1401;This version of Batman nearly embraced an R. rating, wich I would think would have made it the greatest movie ever made in the history of history.
I:17943;1402;Amazon originally suggested that we return the item subject to an extra restocking fee because we had opened the package.
I:17943;1403;Heath Ledger did his thing in this film and completely deserved winning the oscar for best supporting actorPlease check out my podcast free on itunes where i review this movie[.]
I:17943;1404;Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight is a rousing masterpiece of film.
I:17943;1405;making not simply for its acting, which is superb, its cinematography, which is excellent, but also for its drive into the heart of philosophy and the human nature.
I:17943;1406;Heath Ledger's Joker is a case study in terrorism and Christian Bale's Batman is a shining example of how to combat such terror.
I:17943;1407;All of these both add to the entertainment of the film and allow the viewer to probe deep questions of the mind, which is the hallmark of a classic film which The Dark Knight has in spades.
I:17943;1408;lewis also practice, which is an art form of literally becoming the character that one is set to portray.
I:17943;1409;That is method acting to the core.
I:17943;1410;To make the audience believe that instead of being an actor portraying a role, the character has literally come alive and is walking around on screen is at the essence of this art form and Ledger's fantastic believability is one of many aspects of The Dark Knight that make it so incredible.
I:17943;1411;Both are unpredictable and both seek the destruction of another group in society.
I:17943;1412;Both accomplish this through unanticipated attacks which reflect the unpredictability of terrorism.
I:17943;1413;christian Bale's, who also practices method acting, Batman is a stirring example of how to combat the terror introduced by the Joker.
I:17943;1414;Through unconventional means and by stretching the limits of the law, and in some cases exceeding its boundaries, Batman illustrates how to combat modern day terrorism.
I:17943;1415;Now is a time for creativity in warfare, for using technology to root out the enemy and then bring him to justice.
I:17943;1416;But The Dark Knight also gives us an unique insight into the human mind with the character of Harvey Dent.
I:17943;1417;In Harvey's actions we see a part of humanity.
I:17943;1418;He is a great man who brought many criminals to justice, just as the human race has its good side.
I:17943;1419;the Dark Knight is one of the best films of this year and arguably one of the best of the decade.
I:17943;1420;I would highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys stirring action and thoughtful probing of the human n
I:17943;1421;I am a fan of the Bat !
I:17943;1422;Christian Bale is an excellent Batman, I also have the sequele really good flic alot of action.
I:17943;1423;A must for all comic book hero collectors.
I:17943;1424;i like all the new toys and gadgets Batman put in this movie with alot of action!
I:17943;1425;i also love good movies !
I:17943;1426;The Dark Knight is a very good movie.
I:17943;1427;If you love super hero movies you will love this.
I:17943;1428;Batman Vs The Joker is epic.
I:17943;1429;"Somehow, ""The Dark Knight"" lives up to those expectations and even exceeds them."
I:17943;1430;The two hour and thirty two minute running time goes by in a blur as the film doesn't make time to drag and your eyes are glued to the screen the entire time.
I:17943;1431;The Dark Knight is one of those films that once you start watching you have to watch the whole thing.
I:17943;1432;"Epic isn't a word that should be thrown around very often, but ""The Dark Knight"" is definitely epic."
I:17943;1433;The returning cast from the last film continues to be impressive.
I:17943;1434;Michael Caine always manages to be charming and steal a few laughs as Alfred and the film wouldn't be the same without Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox.
I:17943;1435;Christian Bale is still the best Batman to ever put on the cape.
I:17943;1436;It was a welcome change from the first film seeing more Batman this time around than Bruce Wayne.
I:17943;1437;The way he struggles with if continuing to be Batman is the right thing for Gotham still plagues him and is still equally as intriguing.
I:17943;1438;He has the best intentions for Gotham, but once he becomes Two.
I:17943;1439;Those moments of him in the hospital bed are painfully beautiful and his temper lit by a short fuse only makes Two.
I:17943;1440;He steals every scene he's in.
I:17943;1441;Whatever he tapped into and whatever kind of preparation he went through for this role is truly phenomenal.
I:17943;1442;He was somehow able to embody The Joker in a way that is frightening, maniacal, and even hysterical all at the same time.
I:17943;1443;It truly shows that he put a lot of time into developing the character.
I:17943;1444;"The film is for Batman fans, for Christopher Nolan fans, for fans of good storytelling, for fans of good writing, for fans of amazing cinematography, for fans of some of the strongest acting performances ever to be filmed, and for fans of action, crime, or dramatic films
I:17943;1445;If it wasn't the greatest superhero film up until that point, it was at least the most captivating.
I:17943;1446;It truly feels timeless and the type of film that'll stand up to greatness for eternity.
I:17943;1447;Action action action!Make up and set design superb!
I:17943;1448;But for the record, Batman Begins is alot better.
I:17943;1449;Featuring a diabolical performance by the late Heath Ledger, this is a terrific film that takes the franchise to darker places, and it is a milestone in comic adaptations and certain to alter the course of such films in the future.
I:17943;1450;Dent is a supremely confident, dynamic `white knight' who means business, and he is dating Wayne's former love, Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal).
I:17943;1451;directed by Christopher Nolan (Batman Begins, Momento) in arguably his most accomplished work, this mature, psychological movie takes its themes seriously and weaves subplots upon subplots.
I:17943;1452;You may be surprised and thrilled by the answers.
I:17943;1453;Bravo to the filmmakers for not playing it safe.
I:17943;1454;whenever Ledger is onscreen, he is simply terrific.
I:17943;1455;He is complemented, as are the other leads, with a well written script full of memorable lines.
I:17943;1456;There is no logic to his acts, and yet he is a brilliant, clever strategist.
I:17943;1457;Christian Bale continues to impress by portraying dual characters (Bruce Wayne/Batman) effectively and playing off the likes of Freeman and Caine, who make the most of their supporting roles.
I:17943;1458;Eckhart is convincing as Dent, a role much more developed and utilized than in Batman Forever.
I:17943;1459;Gyllenhaal (replacing Katie Holmes) does quite well as Wayne's former flame.
I:17943;1460;Oldman is very good as Gordon which is quite the change of pace from having previously played evil villains (JFK).
I:17943;1461;with a talented cast bringing well rounded characters to the screen, Nolan keeps things grounded and never loses track of his story.
I:17943;1462;A Gotham car chase and Hong Kong escape are breathtaking sequences yet wholly believable.
I:17943;1463;There are several well composed shots that are iconic and haunting.
I:17943;1464;The camerawork is at times quite fluid and dazzling by enhancing the mood or (in The Joker's case) madness.
I:17943;1465;But these are tiny quibbles in a film vastly richer than any comic book adaptation (Spiderman 2 and Iron Man are in this elite company) to date.
I:17943;1466;layered story that challenges and surprises.
I:17943;1467;Go see the wonderful acting and writing led by maestro Nolan.
I:17943;1468;But most of all go see a burst of genius that was Ledger's brilliant, last hurrah.
I:17943;1469;And this is a great film.
I:17943;1470;Christian Bale is amazing as well.
I:17943;1471;I received my product in great condition and in a fast timeline.
I:17943;1472;Great special effects and stunts.
I:17943;1473;The bits with the transformed District Attorney and the dueling ferry boats could easily stand alone as movies.
I:17943;1474;the audience had a lot of enthusiasm for this film.
I:17943;1475;Much of it was breathtaking, and I can understand how Batman fans could love it.
I:17943;1476;This is a fantastic movie, although one that I won't let my small kids watch.
I:17943;1477;Batman has now entered the hallowed halls of cinematic legends.
I:17943;1478;chris Nolan has finally arrived at the A. list with this writhing and heart.
I:17943;1479;Both brothers have churned out equally smart and enigmatic scripts together: Memento and The Prestige.
I:17943;1480;With this film, both brothers have sealed themselves as part of Hollywood legend.
I:17943;1481;The shot is somewhat reminiscent of 2019 Los Angeles of Blade Runner (Chris Nolan's favourite film).
I:17943;1482;note soundtrack that sounds like chalk board screeching, the opening shot has already set the tone for the bleakest and most intelligent superhero movie ever made.
I:17943;1483;"a nod to Michael Mann's ""Heat"", the opening bank heist is shot in a brisk and efficient manner, even William Ficthner made a brief cameo as a bank manager once again."
I:17943;1484;The Joker is a fully developed character on its own.
I:17943;1485;The late Heath Ledger disappears under his skin and emerges one of cinema's most memorable villians, alongside Hannibal Lecter and Darth Vadar.
I:17943;1486;thick makeup and a permanent scar from ear to ear, the Joker's face is something to behold.
I:17943;1487;Even the voice and mannerism captured by Heath Ledger is something of a genius.
I:17943;1488;To a certain extent, Bruce Wayne as well.
I:17943;1489;Filled with moral ambiguities and ethos that is akin to the Joker's anarchic and chaos theory.
I:17943;1490;Both hero and villian are essentially mirror images of each other.
I:17943;1491;bruce Wayne may very well be a schizophrenic.
I:17943;1492;Bruce Wayne allows himself to be the sacrificial lamb for the sake of the moral fiber of Gotham City.
I:17943;1493;By doing so and allowing the whole city to defile his heroic guise, Bruce Wayne has indeed metamorphosized into Gotham City's Dark Knight.
I:17943;1494;Worth every penny spent on this.
I:17943;1495;The Film is great and the Batpod is such a cool edition boxset, a must for all collectors out there.
I:17943;1496;I love this movie, I have been passing it around the family to let them watch it.
I:17943;1497;I cant even explain how amazing the movie is, just watch it.
I:17943;1498;It really is a must see.
I:17943;1499;Very good movie, if I remember right this was the one with Heath Ledger in it.
I:17943;1500;I would recommend it to others
I:17943;1501;After atrocities called Batman Forever and Batman and Robin, I convinced myself the only good Batman stories will either be animated or in comic books.
I:17943;1502;In my opinion, the best Batman in visual format is the Animated Series from the 1990s.
I:17943;1503;Kevin Conroy will always be the true voice of the Batman, and Mark Hamil will and always be the Joker.
I:17943;1504;i would write a long review of why I think my title sums it up, but I'll just go by the stars:1 star for being the amazing Christopher Nolan directed sequel of my favorite comic book superhero.1 star for the amazing performances of all of the actors and actresses.
I:17943;1505;Yes even the Christian Bale growl I liked.
I:17943;1506;you have to mask your voice!
I:17943;1507;If the Joker was to exist, this has got to be it.
I:17943;1508;This movie was just created so freaking well.1 star that this is what a Blu.
I:17943;1509;I'm not sure, it's a very #$%@ing great suspenseful action movie.
I:17943;1510;We Loved watching this on Amazon and it's one of the BEST superhero movies!
I:17943;1511;This movie is the best movie I have in my entire comic adaptation, I have a lot of these super hero movies and started collecting since the mid 80's.
I:17943;1512;It is actually VERY small, the case and the bat pod.
I:17943;1513;This movie is a hit in our house.
I:17943;1514;The acting is just superb.
I:17943;1515;Gary Oldman is fantastic as Commissioner Gordon, Christian Bale is the best Batman ever, and Maggie Gyllenhall is such an improvement over Katie Holmes there are no words.
I:17943;1516;"If you have the volume at a normal level to hear the conversations between the characters, when the action starts you're pretty much blasted by the explosions
I:17943;1517;And so begins the game.
I:17943;1518;"On one side: new Gotham D. a. Harvey Dent, determined to bring down the mob alongside honest cop Jim Gordon
I:17943;1519;christian Bale delivers another solid, near.
I:17943;1520;flawless performance as the Caped Crusader.
I:17943;1521;"Gary Oldman's Jim Gordon is thankfully given a larger role
I:17943;1522;His portrayal as Gotham's one honest cop is one for the ages.
I:17943;1523;Michael Cain gets to drop a few more hilarious one.
I:17943;1524;"Aaron Eckhart, as Dent, is a welcome addition
I:17943;1525;it is, of course, Heath Ledger's performance that will draw the most attention.
I:17943;1526;Let me make this statement as clear as I possibly can: Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is one of the greatest cinematic villains of all time.
I:17943;1527;and yet, despite it all, he is undeniably human.
I:17943;1528;The movie explores the depths of human deprevity (the Joker's favorite past.
I:17943;1529;After all, even Batman, behind the leather and armor, is human.
I:17943;1530;And that makes it a thoroughly gripping, and truly disturbing, cinematic experience.
I:17943;1531;that just so happens to feature a comic book character.
I:17943;1532;Not a light viewing experience.
I:17943;1533;This was probably the best movie I saw in 2008.
I:17943;1534;I found it to be pure cinematic excellence, plus I think in terms of movies Chris Nolan stumbled upon what can finally be determined is the real Batman.
I:17943;1535;The story is great, the acting is incredible.
I:17943;1536;The technical effects reminded me of a James Bond movie, as did the love triangle involving Batman and Dent.
I:17943;1537;Heath Ledgers' portrayal of the joker is outstanding and he takes this movie to another level.
I:17943;1538;Great action overall great movie.
I:17943;1539;Would've liked more special features but the packaging is sweet, especially The Joker's scriblles on the back.
I:17943;1540;Also, the disk designs were sweet!
I:17943;1541;I don't know why it took me so long to watch this movie and this is coming from a huge batman fan.
I:17943;1542;the product was perfectly in tact and arrived early which was a nice surprise to be wrapped for christmas.
I:17943;1543;It was a good movie with heath Ledger.
I:17943;1544;But in all and all it was still a great movie.
I:17943;1545;"The fundamental problem is that ""The Dark Knight"" is really two films clumsily fused together: the grand social commentary of the Joker plot and the intimate descent into psychosis of the Two."
I:17943;1546;"Individually, each plot could have resulted in a worthy successor to ""Begins."""
I:17943;1547;"He manages to convert Bruce Wayne from endearing playboy to neurotic ""frat boy"" while providing an almost incomprehensible Batman voice."
I:17943;1548;Finally, Maggie Gyllenhaal makes Katie Holmes' Rachael Dawes seem elegant and nuanced.
I:17943;1549;"As one reviewer put it: ""I defy you to diagram the opening fight sequence in the parking garage."
I:17943;1550;He even welcomed his fall from grace, recognizing early on that he could never fight evil effectively and remain popular to the public.
I:17943;1551;In devising the story, Nolan hit upon a truth that the entire press corps seems to have forgotten: principle is more important than popularity.
I:17943;1552;Having a squeaky clean image and saying all the right things are no substitute for the willingness or character to fight evil.
I:17943;1553;but regardless of whether you like the politics of The Dark Knight or prefer to just zone out and watch the mayhem, Warner's BD is a must.
I:17943;1554;some of us think this is the best superhero movie of all time to date, great story, excellent direction of the film, good actors and one of the best performances of an evil character: The Joker interpreted by Heath Ledger, from my point of view this Joker is way better than the one play by Jack Nicholson.
I:17943;1555;"the Joker of Jack is kind of childish, a great performance by Nicholson, but also kind of incredible
I:17943;1556;mash of standard definition and high.
I:17943;1557;part documentary replaces the need for an audio track and focuses on the unique elements that went into the creation of the sets, props and the use of IMAX cameras.
I:17943;1558;"They all explore Batman and Bruce Wayne, as presented by ""Gotham Cable's Premier News Program""."
I:17943;1559;Here, they are all on display, along with TV spots and trailers, concept art, poster art and production stills.
I:17943;1560;while not perfect, this content features enough interesting documentaries and extracurricular activities to keep one occupied for hours on end.
I:17943;1561;This was a good finishing touch to a classic BD package: a combination of creepy and cute.
I:17943;1562;the acting is great, the cinematography great.
I:17943;1563;and the best joker EVER!
I:17943;1564;Gritty realism make this movie.
I:17943;1565;When writer/director Christopher Nolan resurrected the hoary Batman franchise with his amazing Batman Begins, one wondered if he could maintain the high level of excellence.
I:17943;1566;out better than the great movie it's based upon (see The Empire Strikes Back or The Two Towers for examples).
I:17943;1567;Christian Bale is his solid self in the title role.
I:17943;1568;Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine are back and wonderful.
I:17943;1569;Maggie Gyllenhaal replaces Katie Holmes in the role of Batman's love interest, adding a more believable feistiness.
I:17943;1570;Aaron Eckhart is excellent as the town's optimistic new district attorney, Harvey Dent.
I:17943;1571;Gary Oldman is back as James Gordon, and the filmmakers have wisely expanded his role and relationship with Batman.
I:17943;1572;he's the sympathetic and human anchor holding these films together.
I:17943;1573;There's nothing funny about this Joker, but there is something hypnotic about him.
I:17943;1574;He truly believes he can keep the baddies at bay through good people making right choices.
I:17943;1575;the film's exploration of heroes, and their flaws, is compelling.
I:17943;1576;Batman chooses to bend and break rules to achieve his ends, and we're left wondering if he's making the right decision, despite the outcome.
I:17943;1577;And despite Joker's belief, people's humanity wins the day.
I:17943;1578;Nolan walks a knife's edge with these big questions, and the ride is exhilarating.
I:17943;1579;nolan has made the best superhero movie ever, and I can't wait to see what he does with the third film in the franchise.
I:17943;1580;Loved this set from the moment I opened the package, anyone who's anyone who likes Batman will absolutely looooove this!
I:17943;1581;The Dark Knight is one of the best movies I've ever seen.
I:17943;1582;The story line is superb, the cast is amazing (Heath Ledger deserves an Oscar for his performance as Joker), and the action is breathtaking.
I:17943;1583;Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker is amazing and terrifying.
I:17943;1584;Ledger shows that Joker is sadistic, homicidal, insane, and of course, funny in a horrifying way.
I:17943;1585;I highly recommend The Dark Knight to anyone who wants to experience a thrilling action movie!!!
I:17943;1586;"Applause at the end of the movie and the ""wow the BEST part of a film was."""
I:17943;1587;I expected a nearly perfect movie and my expectations were EXCEEDED.
I:17943;1588;So much more than just a character, Ledger gives one of the great performances in film history.
I:17943;1589;The 2nd best performance in the TDK and another amazing performance as Lt. James Gordon.
I:17943;1590;For anyone that is a fan of Batman Year One and the comics, you will appreciate Oldmans work nearly as much as Ledger.
I:17943;1591;Quiet, subdued, and wonderful, you CARE for Lt. Gordon and you are happy when things go his way.
I:17943;1592;This is an amazing work and can't be ignored.
I:17943;1593;Chicago really was a perfect place to film these movies.
I:17943;1594;The city looks amazing and you really feel like you are in Gotham.
I:17943;1595;Fantastic Bruce Wayne, perfect as Batman, obv the movies don't work if he doesn't.
I:17943;1596;On par with the greatness of his work in Batman Begins.
I:17943;1597;I don't think it's better work here, I think in both movies he is amazing equally.
I:17943;1598;Wonderful as Alfred as per usual.
I:17943;1599;The IMAX shots really add to the film and the opening shots in IMAX make you go WOW.
I:17943;1600;The new Batpod and other cool stuff are still realistic and not over the top.
I:17943;1601;Any technology that is introduced in the movie serves a good purpose and makes sense.
I:17943;1602;Great performance that makes you CARE about Harvey Dent and what he is trying to do for the city of Gotham.
I:17943;1603;At the end of the movie when he's not the same person that he was at the beginning he still gives a great performanceMorgan Freeman .
I:17943;1604;Such a great actor and he builds on his character from Batman Begins, very solidGOODMaggie Gyllenhaal .
I:17943;1605;I never criticized Katie Holmes in Batman Begins because I thought she did a fine job acting and her baby faced innocence I thought was a good match for Bruce Wayne.
I:17943;1606;I think Gyllenhaal was in a tough spot with this role.
I:17943;1607;She comes into TDK with a character already created and she doesn't seem sure how to act accordingly.
I:17943;1608;"the Dark Knight is THE definitive ""super hero"" movie but it is so much more."
I:17943;1609;Any time Ledger is on the screen it's pure candy and he's on the screen just enough, making you yearn for more.
I:17943;1610;great story, incredible directing, amazing/great performances and the genius of Heath Ledger make this not only the best film of 2008 but one of the great movies of all time.
I:17943;1611;In terms of sequels it might BE the greatest sequel ever (I would put Godfather Part II and Aliens right up there as well) and it DOES live up to the hype.
I:17943;1612;see The Dark Knight in IMAX if you can to enjoy the scenes filmed in this format, but make sure you see this movie over and over again.
I:17943;1613;A great cast of actors who obviously needed a quick buck.
I:17943;1614;Ultra dark and super intense.
I:17943;1615;There will be no better Batman movie.
I:17943;1616;good settings, costumes, props, and of course the batman toys.
I:17943;1617;Characters, scenes, and everything about this movie is believable and sometimes hauntingly possible.
I:17943;1618;Bale is, once again, great as the Bat, Nolan is so inconceivably on his game, and Heath Ledger gives one of the most memorable performances in recent memory.
I:17943;1619;It's one of those movies that will be remembered for a long time to come, and it's made it's way onto my all.
I:17943;1620;The story was one of the most powerful, gripping and emotional of any superhero film out of any I had ever seen.
I:17943;1621;And the saying, a hero is only as good as the villain, holds true.
I:17943;1622;This was such an amazing movie that I really can't say anymore because its already been said.
I:17943;1623;But I will say: after this movie, all other superhero movies will have to live up to this.
I:17943;1624;This is a great collectors item even if your not a Batman fan.
I:17943;1625;ray as well as a digital download.
I:17943;1626;Very well made with great details on the BatPod.
I:17943;1627;In a nutshell this product was great!
I:17943;1628;Amazing all the way around.
I:17943;1629;Heath Ledger's performance is legendary.
I:17943;1630;Chris Nolan's vision of Batman is definitive, and this is by far the best installment of the series.
I:17943;1631;I already knew I loved this movie.
I:17943;1632;Huge fan of the whole trilogy.
I:17943;1633;Heath Ledger gave the single greatest performance in the history of a Batman movie.
I:17943;1634;The Dark Knight was probably one of the most fantastic movies ever, and (in my opinion) the best movie in the batman trilogy.
I:17943;1635;I would highly recommend this to any batman fans.
I:17943;1636;This movie is pretty incredible.
I:17943;1637;"Incredible special effects and acting, this movie can easily entertain those who don't know much of the Batman mythos
I:17943;1638;Definitely should add it to you movie collection if you don't own it!
I:17943;1639;Christian Bale does a great job as playboy billionaire Bruce Wayne, a charming lady killer by day and a brooding vigilante by night.
I:17943;1640;Caine is charming as Wayne's loyal friend and right hand man, who often guides the young man through many of the difficult choices he must make.
I:17943;1641;And Fox, also a moral center for Wayne, runs Wayne Enterprises and helps aquire all those fancy gadgets and amazing vehicles and suits that aid the Batman in his fight against crime.
I:17943;1642;all three doing a great job in their prospective roles.
I:17943;1643;Ledger's Joker ups the anty, besting Jack Nicholson's version of the villain and guaranteeing himself a posthumous Oscar nomination for a truly inspiring performance.
I:17943;1644;"at almost 2.5 hours running time, ""The Dark Knight"" is well worth every minute spent."
I:17943;1645;The special effects are incredible, as expected, and the story, characters and performances are beyond reproach.
I:17943;1646;"Nolan is an amazing director (as he has proven before with films such as ""Memento"" and ""The Prestige"") and deserves his share of the credit."
I:17943;1647;This film is lucky to have that perfect combination of ingredients needed to make a really great film.
I:17943;1648;director, actors and story, all well done and appealing to a mass audience.
I:17943;1649;This is the kind of movie meant to be seen on the big screen!
I:17943;1650;These Batman movies all seem good.
I:17943;1651;Dark Knight is one awesome film, and the transfer to Blu ray is quite amazing.
I:17943;1652;The audio is superb, and the Joker's theme sounds very eerie hearing it in surround sound.
I:17943;1653;the film looks fantastic, with some graininess.
I:17943;1654;You can see all the detail on the suits, and everything just looks lifelike on screen.
I:17943;1655;Definitely check out Hans Zimmer special on the disc to hear how he created the Joker's theme.
I:17943;1656;love this blueray a lot and is in steel book.
I:17943;1657;thanks for this great collector items.
I:17943;1658;This is a great movie as it is but the blu.
I:17943;1659;Even if I didn't have the surround sound I would have loved the movie, but it does take it to a new level.
I:17943;1660;"I have never seen a performance as great as Heath Ledger's ""Joker"" portrayal."
I:17943;1661;I loved all the extras and I immediately downloaded the digital copy so I could watch it on anything I have!
I:17943;1662;This is among of the best superhero movies ever.
I:17943;1663;In fact, if it wasn't for Batman's suit and Batmobile, you could easily argue this is among the best detective movies.
I:17943;1664;It has an engaging storyline, spectacular action sequences, great characters portrayed wonderfully by a talented cast, and great direction (as usual) from Christopher Nolan.
I:17943;1665;Here you have a rarity .
I:17943;1666;christian Bale again does a great job as Batman, supported by Michael Caine as Alfred and Gary Oldman as Gordon.
I:17943;1667;The standout performance though goes to Heath Ledger as the Joker.
I:17943;1668;In many of the scenes the Joker is both amusing and terrifying at the same time.
I:17943;1669;the chase scenes in the movie are some of the best action sequences I've seen.
I:17943;1670;The Dark Knight provides a great mix of action and psychological drama.
I:17943;1671;It adds a touch of romance with the ill.
I:17943;1672;fated love of Batman for Rachel.
I:17943;1673;And the Joker provides many funny moments, even while he's being menacing.
I:17943;1674;It transcends the superhero movie genre.
I:17943;1675;I love this movie and the blu ray looks great!
I:17943;1676;I recommend this to any blu ray collector and Batman fan.
I:17943;1677;I love the direction that the brothers Nolan have taken the Batman series.
I:17943;1678;Emphasizing character and story over visuals and pyrotechnics they have made works for the ages.
I:17943;1679;but after seeing all the batman movies Michael Keaton Takes the cake.
I:17943;1680;he's still one of the best batmans, outside of adam west.
I:17943;1681;"His hope of a normal life hinges on the ""white knight of Gotham City,"" DA Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), who can act in the light and within the system
I:17943;1682;interest incarnate, pure and simple.
I:17943;1683;director / co. writer Christopher Nolan has surpassed his excellent first film of this series.
I:17943;1684;Everyone brings their A. game.
I:17943;1685;I confess that I found the script to be unfocused and chaotic at times, but I was completely won over by the time the credits rolled for two primary reasons.
I:17943;1686;First, the film's last act, and particularly its final moments, brings all the thematic threads together in an unexpected fashion.
I:17943;1687;if another Batman film is never made, I will feel completely satisfied.
I:17943;1688;"Nolan creates a new superheroe movie genre with ""Begins"" and ""The Dark Night"", it would be great to see how other Batman comic villians are developed in sequels with this same ""more real characters"" concept, just hope Nolan keeps on charge of directing these."
I:17943;1689;"Sad, Superman is my favorite superhero, but ""The Dark Night"" is definetly my favorite superhero movie."
I:17943;1690;This is i believed the best choice i have made by far Dark Knight is an Amazing film and truly shows what the batman world is.
I:17943;1691;OK, let me first say that Heith Ledger is brilliant here and deserving of the Oscar.
I:17943;1692;If you love special effects, I guess you will like the film, however I found the Iron Man to be a far superior film (and Robert Downey Jr. was very funny.)
I:17943;1693;See it, but only for Ledger's masterful performance.
I:17943;1694;They should have made it slightly more realistic.
I:17943;1695;Probably oone of the most entertaining movies of '08.
I:17943;1696;overall an excellent film in actor portrayal of characters and intricacy of plot.
I:17943;1697;To go along with this it is one of the greatest movies of all time!
I:17943;1698;ledgers performance was spellbinding as was the rest of the cast.
I:17943;1699;I heartily recommend this movie.
I:17943;1700;Thanks Amazon for the quick delivery.
I:17943;1701;the movie was absolutely stunning in Blu.
I:17943;1702;I know some analyze these things frame by frame and that's OK.
I:17943;1703;I simply watched and throughly enjoyed the movie.
I:17943;1704;Saw it 3 times on the big screen, 2 on IMAX.
I:17943;1705;Kudos to all involved in its production.
I:17943;1706;heath Ledger gives a Oscar worthy performance.
I:17943;1707;Having watched it again, it's very complex film with many elements and layers.
I:17943;1708;It is a film that can reveal more as you watch it again.
I:17943;1709;I came away thinking this is the best of the three films.
I:17943;1710;I plan to see The Dark Knight Rises again with the first 2 films fresh in my mind.
I:17943;1711;so bottom line, I think it's a great film.
I:17943;1712;The price is perfect for anyone who wants it in their collection.
I:17943;1713;How this film ever found its way in the likes of the Times Literary Supplement as a well.
I:17943;1714;top performance worthy of note but not at all a nuanced performance worthy of comparison to the great dramatic roles awarded Academy prizes through the years.
I:17943;1715;book, neither witty nor fun.
I:17943;1716;Is he brilliant, superhuman, gifted or what?
I:17943;1717;The hype makes out that this is a movie worthy of our attention.
I:17943;1718;"I decided to upgrade one of the greatest movies of all time the dark knight to steelbook and man im in love with the case
I:17943;1719;Definitely recommend it, only 10 bucks!
I:17943;1720;I really enjoyed batman begins, even my kids liked it but then this one did not meet my expectations it was all about killing.
I:17943;1721;I think it is a great movie for adults but I find it a little to dark for kids under 17.
I:17943;1722;The movie is great for anyone over 17.
I:17943;1723;I enjoyed the movie immensely
I:17943;1724;I thought everyone did a magnificient acting job in this.
I:17943;1725;christian Bale's portrayal of Batman / Bruce Wayne was actually quite subtle.
I:17943;1726;"As Wayne, he was suave and confident
I:17943;1727;"As Batman, he came across as determined and unstoppable
I:17943;1728;aaron Eckhart did marvelously as Harvey Dent.
I:17943;1729;The transformation from the DA committed to law and order into a ruined man incapable of dealing with his own pain and loss, and determined to impose his own new ideas about chaos upon the world was brilliant.
I:17943;1730;This proved true at the end when the whole city turned against him.
I:17943;1731;He was also a formidable adversary.
I:17943;1732;A skilled fighter, brilliant improviser, and was incapable of caring what happened to him.
I:17943;1733;Every time he was face to face with pain or death, he laughed.
I:17943;1734;Daniel Day Lewis is a perfect example.
I:17943;1735;sacrifice for the greater good.
I:17943;1736;"Wouldn't that place the ""new"" administration, whose foundation of ""hope"" is well known, in the role of the ill fated Harvey?"
I:17943;1737;The depth and detail of the characters, the intensity of the action scenes, and even the emotional journey behind the musical score, solidify this Film's place in Comic Book Movie History.
I:17943;1738;Through his deliverance and through Nolan's vision, it was the best portrayal of The Joker I've ever seen!
I:17943;1739;The perfect blend of genius, ruthlessness and insanity!To me, Bale's portrayal of Bruce Wayne is fantastic.
I:17943;1740;"Now, when it comes to the other half of the roll, he does the physical part of the job perfectly, but I can never get over that ""Batman Voice""."
I:17943;1741;And it takes a lot for me to say perfect.
I:17943;1742;Smart and complex, yet straightforward when it needed to be.
I:17943;1743;It was a perfect balance between dialogue and fight scenes, and had many edge of your seat moments.
I:17943;1744;This movie was fantastic when I saw it on opening day, and it still is, years later!
I:17943;1745;This is how batman movies should be, gritty, on the edge and with a possibility that Batman might lose.
I:17943;1746;heath Ledger's performance as 'Joker' has immortalized one of the best screen play Villain in modern times.
I:17943;1747;Unlike 1989's Batman, this will be the best comic book adaptation successfully put to screen and I doubt whether there will be any movie like this unless Christopher breaks his own record with an even more successful sequel.
I:17943;1748;This time he displayed a much more mature role.
I:17943;1749;Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent/Two Face was an excellent pick and he balanced his role delightfully.
I:17943;1750;apart from the brilliant performance by supporting actors like Morgan Freeman, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Gary Oldman as Lt. Gordan, the movie provided us with some of the unforgettable musical score by typical talents James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer.
I:17943;1751;closing Note: Worth watching multiple times, and if you are an avid Movie Collector then you can add this to your collection.
I:17943;1752;Bale works fine as the newest knight.
I:17943;1753;Definitely an action packed movie.
I:17943;1754;This is one of the best movies ever.
I:17943;1755;ray, hope it will stick around for more years to come.
I:17943;1756;There are two things in the world that everybody loves.
I:17943;1757;The first one is of course Raymond and the second one is this movie.
I:17943;1758;It gives a hold new meaning to the term action packed.
I:17943;1759;I thought that it would be pretty good but i was still very impressed.
I:17943;1760;It's very long but still it's one of the greatest all out action flicks of all time.
I:17943;1761;Good people to deal with.
I:17943;1762;i bought this for a friend for christmas and she was happy.
I:17943;1763;This is one of the best batman movies i have ever seen the acting is great and the plot is amazing.
I:17943;1764;I thought it would be hard for them to trump Batman Begins, but this far exceeds it with great performances from everyone.
I:17943;1765;Watched it 3 times and still amazed by the acting.
I:17943;1766;"As much as I loved the first film that Christopher Nolan directed, ""Batman Begins"",""The Dark Knight"" surpasses it in casting (Heath Ledger and Maggie Glylenhaal replacing the wan Katie Holmes) and script!!"
I:17943;1767;hero fans and non alike!!
I:17943;1768;ray edition of this film and it's outstanding, in fact even better the Hi.
I:17943;1769;"def version of ""Batman Begins"" which was excellent also."
I:17943;1770;Just like everyone else, I love the Dark Knight Trilogy.
I:17943;1771;This movie is magnitudes greater than Batman Begins and sets the tone for The Dark Knight Rises.
I:17943;1772;Heath Ledger is an acting genius.
I:17943;1773;I love this film, big fan of Christopher Nolan, can't go wrong with this flick, especially for the black friday price i got it for!
I:17943;1774;This movie is so amazing and Amazon always has the cheapest prices for Blu.
I:17943;1775;I saw this in the theater and it was good enough that I thought I needed to own to demo on my home theater.
I:17943;1776;Really good LFE and great action scenes.
I:17943;1777;This movie sounded great through it.
I:17943;1778;"viewed from an Epson 8350 projector onto an elite screen sable frame 106""."
I:17943;1779;Good movie with great performance by Heath Ledger.
I:17943;1780;Ledger was superb!the best batman movie ever made !
I:17943;1781;The great character development, the twists, and the action.
I:17943;1782;It has bettered its predecessor in the action part.
I:17943;1783;the transfer itself is phenomenal.
I:17943;1784;especially ones filmed with IMAX cameras.
I:17943;1785;shabby 2.1 system and it sounded great.
I:17943;1786;The Dark Knight is a visually stunning, multi.
I:17943;1787;He is by far the best Joker I've ever seen (sorry Jack).
I:17943;1788;I also thought including the cameo of Scarecrow was a nice touch.
I:17943;1789;I've always viewed Bruce Wayne as a tormented soul who views the mantle of the bat as a bane in his life.
I:17943;1790;I still feel that it is an amazing film that was sorely overlooked at the Oscars.
I:17943;1791;The entire family enjoyed this movie.
I:17943;1792;I thought this movie was great.
I:17943;1793;The acting was good, the action was intense and I think this movie deserves a few awards.
I:17943;1794;Bought it for a firend that is a huge batman fan.
I:17943;1795;My friend thought it was great.
I:17943;1796;It was a gift for our grandson and he loved it!
I:17943;1797;Everything's fine on this end.
I:17943;1798;The majority of the film is 2.40:1, while the IMAX.
I:17943;1799;It was a great movie.
I:17943;1800;For some reason, I was able to watch it for only $1.99, and that was the best $1.99 I have ever spent.
I:17943;1801;You could pay $3.99 for this movie, and it would be well worth it.
I:17943;1802;Now, I will try to be as mature as I can be about this.
I:17943;1803;I think that it's a very good comic series with interesting themes and complex characters (for the most part).
I:17943;1804;I also like Tim Burton's Batman films.
I:17943;1805;I feel that they are well done representations of the series itself (though there are changes to the story, but that is expected).
I:17943;1806;It seems that the majority are saying that Nolan's movies are the best movies by far.
I:17943;1807;I feel that that is an untrue statement.
I:17943;1808;Most of the cast is okay, but my main issue is with Batman and The Joker.
I:17943;1809;Michael Keaton is the best actor for Batman, as he could be both Bruce Wayne and Batman without trying too hard.
I:17943;1810;He uses several kinds of devices, substances, and plans to make everybody smile, then die from laughter (as well as other criminal reasons).
I:17943;1811;He felt like a cross between a watered.
I:17943;1812;Nicholson was able to portray both elements of the Joker beautifully.
I:17943;1813;Overall, the Nolan movies are okay, but definitely not as good as people say they are.
I:17943;1814;Thank you for your time.
I:17943;1815;This movie tops all the Batman movies that I ever saw.
I:17943;1816;You will sit on the edge of your seat and won't even want to blink your eyes while watching it.
I:17943;1817;It's excellent to the very end and I was sad to see it end.
I:17943;1818;You can see every detail i love this movie.
I:17943;1819;Excellent movie, my kids loved it.
I:17943;1820;This is an excellent continuation of the new Batman series.
I:17943;1821;The acting is excellent and very enjoyable.
I:17943;1822;It is a good lead in to the Dark Knight Rises.
I:17943;1823;The Movie is wonderful, but that's not what I am rating/reviewing.
I:17943;1824;And so is the plastic one that this set comes with.
I:17943;1825;Finally, at long last, we get a superhero movie that lives up to the dynamism and creative vigor of the original comicbook medium!
I:17943;1826;"This second installment in the rebooted ""Batman"" franchise is easily the best Batman movie yet, with an intelligent, surprising, suspenseful script, a fluid sense of action, and vastly superior acting."
I:17943;1827;Holmes in the role of district attorney Rachel Dawes.
I:17943;1828;"Similarly, Aaron Eckhart brings just the right tone to his performance as the public crusader Harvey Dent, and Gary Oldman has completely nailed Police Commissioner Jim Gordon (as the character has evolved in recent years, particularly in the late series, ""Gotham Central."")"
I:17943;1829;And, of course, Heath Ledger is absolutely stunning as the Joker.
I:17943;1830;He, and this film's version of Two.
I:17943;1831;that actually feel feel terrifying and real.
I:17943;1832;Warner, please keep him happy.
I:17943;1833;film has to be so big and grandiose, and have such a decisive finality at the end.
I:17943;1834;we want to see him again, in the next film, and we want to see Eckhart reprise his role!
I:17943;1835;epic, when really comicbook stories are plenty exciting on their own, and don't need the added layers of mythologizing and grandiosity.
I:17943;1836;It's my hope that the studios will learn from this success, and loosen up a little bit.
I:17943;1837;then perhaps they can just settle down and deliver some spectacular pyrotechnics and dynamic, mind.
I:17943;1838;And we want it to be fun.
I:17943;1839;This film delivers on all fronts.
I:17943;1840;I enjoyed the movie as was expected.
I:17943;1841;Heath Ledger played one of the best villains I've ever seen.
I:17943;1842;Detail was very good especially in the Imax parts of the movie which were the best of any blu.
I:17943;1843;This movie was the best Batman movie yet.
I:17943;1844;"Nowe I love Batman, I feel he's the greatest comic book superhero of all time, but even I was wondering ""Whats the big deal?"
I:17943;1845;I actually had chills and goosebumps watching it.
I:17943;1846;And Christian Bale did a wonderful job playing Batman, as usual.
I:17943;1847;The entire movie was expertly done.
I:17943;1848;It really leaves you on the edge of your seat.
I:17943;1849;All I have to say is that this is one of the best superhero movies made to date.
I:17943;1850;One of the best movies in history.
I:17943;1851;Besides I like the special features.
I:17943;1852;DC beat out all of those with Dark Knight, and easily I must add.
I:17943;1853;While Batman Begins was one of the best comic book films I had seen (though on par with some of the forementioned Marvel movies), this is easily the best.
I:17943;1854;i had never gone into a movie with such high expectations, and that scared me.
I:17943;1855;I honestly went in thinking I was going to see one of the best films of my life (outside of the comic book movie realm), and I did not come out seeing the best film of my life, but yes, one of the best.
I:17943;1856;This film takes itself so seriously and does it so well.
I:17943;1857;The actors were impressive, some more than others, and the characters they represent are astonishing.
I:17943;1858;Of course we knew Heath Ledgers performance of the Joker was going to be Oscar worthy .
I:17943;1859;and it is with ease.
I:17943;1860;I must say Christian Bale's performance was fine, but not show.
I:17943;1861;It is very complex, and I'm just not sure I got it all in, definetly one of those movie I'd want to watch more than once to fit things together better each time.
I:17943;1862;Seriously though, the story and theme alone can compete with some of the best dramas out there.
I:17943;1863;But speaking of action, it was done so well.
I:17943;1864;This includes scenes with the Tumbler and Bat.
I:17943;1865;if you are a fan of Batman villains, of course you are in for a treat with the Joker played by Heath Ledger.
I:17943;1866;face is (well duh) so much better than the Tommy Lee Jones Two.
I:17943;1867;face.SPOILER END>>>I never thought I'd say this cause I feel like part of the crowd, but seriously this is going to be one of my favorite films for a loooong time to come.
I:17943;1868;I would certainly watch this one over and over again, and yes mainly to see and study Heath Ledger's excellent performance.
I:17943;1869;The world has truly lost a very blessed and gifted actor, and no doubt he needs to be recognized for a nomy.
I:17943;1870;if you truly love a movie though its always great purchasing the collectors edition.
I:17943;1871;get all the special features and documentaries.
I:17943;1872;This movie is a great relaunch of the Batman movies .
I:17943;1873;Christian Bale is a great Batman and all the idiosyncracies of the various characters make for an intriguing viewing.
I:17943;1874;Heath Ledger is absolutely stunning as the Joker in what would turn out to be the last performance of a brilliant but troubled actor.
I:17943;1875;This is a great movie.
I:17943;1876;The extended version really adds to the version I saw at the theatre.
I:17943;1877;Christian Bale is the best Batman ever.
I:17943;1878;One of the best action movies ever, available for the PSP.
I:17943;1879;enjoy the epic struggle of Batman vs. Joker in Christopher Nolan's vision of The Dark Knight.
I:17943;1880;I love Batman and these movies were all absolutely perfect to me.
I:17943;1881;I liked the part when Joker and Batman were fighting at the end of the movie.
I:17943;1882;It was very exciting to see who won.
I:17943;1883;I thought the film was very good, although the story line featuring the the demise of Aaron Eckhart's character should have been deleted.
I:17943;1884;a mystery, and carried on with the rest of the film.
I:17943;1885;"Heath Ledger's ""Joker"" was more than enough to carry the entire film, and his performance was riveting."
I:17943;1886;mouse between Batman and the Joker was excellent, although at times it stagnated, and should have been streamlined to make the chase more urgent and suspenseful.
I:17943;1887;So many great moments and quotes in the film.
I:17943;1888;the best out of the trilogy if you ask me
I:17943;1889;Although others here have put it more eloquently than I plan to, this is the best of all combinations of the aforementioned genres.
I:17943;1890;there is only one Commish Gordon now, and his name is the much underrated and excellent Gary Oldman.
I:17943;1891;the list continues with Freeman and Eckert (Sp.) , the always delightful M. Caine, and of course now the late H. Ledger.
I:17943;1892;if Nolan feels he can continue to master this genius, then by all means, please continue, but if not, then please leave the masterpiece alone and refuse to sell out.
I:17943;1893;"e"" and that Panda thing to take care of that, among so so many more yet to come?This is an adult film, with certain fantasy elements, but well set into a most realistic, and sometimes brutally so, world."
I:17943;1894;It is what it is, and its, like another blogger wrote, purely a masterpiece.
I:17943;1895;After the phenomenal and intimist Batman Begins, Christopher Nolan's follow.
I:17943;1896;up is an epic, spectacular, well acted, action packed film that not only stands head and shoulders above any other superhero film but also is one of the best films ever made.
I:17943;1897;I think we all remember Jack Nicholson as The Joker in Burton's Batman and while he is a terrific actor and did a great job with the character, Heath Ledger took the character and turned him into a force of nature that has to be reckoned with.
I:17943;1898;Ledger's Joker is one of the many highlights of the film and he does a terrific job with the character.
I:17943;1899;He is a smart psychothic killer who only wants to see the world burn.
I:17943;1900;Is too bad that this was Ledger's final role becuase he was a fantastic actor and it clearly shows here.
I:17943;1901;As terrific as Bale is in the role of Batman, ha can't help but get overshadowed by Ledger.
I:17943;1902;He created a fantastic, timeless character.
I:17943;1903;still, every other single aspect of the film deserves praise, the cast, the imax sequences, the action, the plot, etc., TDK is a fantastic film that will keep you at the edge of your seat every time you see it.
I:17943;1904;It's bigger than BB but also darker and one of the best sequels ever made.
I:17943;1905;An excellent film through and through.
I:17943;1906;It's not the same but it's a fantastic alternative.
I:17943;1907;The presentation is strong, with a high resolution, excellent contrast and with no compression artifacts whatsoever.
I:17943;1908;disc BD set that has a lot of insightful materia.
I:17943;1909;You have a documentary about the Imax proces and the production of the film in general and a PIP presentation on key scenes.
I:17943;1910;closing Thoughts:TDK is Nolan's finest film to date.
I:17943;1911;With an amazing plot, a spectacular cast, great action sequences and awesome special effects, this movie is a must.
I:17943;1912;Warner's BD has a terrific P/A presentation and great and insightful bonus material.
I:17943;1913;"The Burton ones cinematography and set were much more ""other worldly"" and interesting."
I:17943;1914;I also prefer Michael Keaton/Jack Nicholson to Bale/Ledger, and the Danny Elfman score for the Burton movies was preferable of course.
I:17943;1915;This movie is absolutely '*****' spectacular, however if your looking for a depth of extras on this bonus disk, you'll come up pretty empty.
I:17943;1916;The Dark Knight Movie ReviewIn all movies there is something that hits right at home for everyone who watches.
I:17943;1917;there is now and always will be an ongoing battle between Jesus and Satan to win your heart.
I:17943;1918;"He was on top of everything in Gotham city, until he was tempted by ""Satan"" in the movie."
I:17943;1919;When he finally broke down and went to the dark side he was there for good.
I:17943;1920;He is the one we praise when there is time of praise.
I:17943;1921;Just like every other city in the world the people who live there knows who batman is.
I:17943;1922;Throughout the whole movie he is tempting Harvey Dent.
I:17943;1923;The side filled of villains, killers, robbers and, rapist, just every type of person imaginable that would be your typical bad guy.
I:17943;1924;"All of this is just a simple example of the power that Satan has on a ""strong"" person."
I:17943;1925;This brings me to my last point of the joker portraying the modern day Satan, by corrupting the city and pretty much turning it upside down with his evil ways.
I:17943;1926;Throughout this review you have seen a little bit deeper into The Dark Knight from a Christian world view.
I:17943;1927;The actors in this movie were excellent and the performances, top notch.
I:17943;1928;saver, giving up romance and the full.
I:17943;1929;i hope there will be another installment.
I:17943;1930;I am not a huge movie person but have enjoyed this series.
I:17943;1931;ray AND Digital is a recipe for success.
I:17943;1932;The Dark Knight is the very definition of epic!
I:17943;1933;This movie has great action scenes and keeps you at the edge of your seat the whole time.
I:17943;1934;This is definitely a must have for any batman or action movie fan.
I:17943;1935;Christian Bale not only plays the Bruce Wayne that Gotham sees him as, but he is also its greatest detective and justice breeder.
I:17943;1936;"Then there is also the ""real"" Bruce Wayne."
I:17943;1937;aaron Eckhart also does a great job of playing multiple roles because he is so believable as the well mannered District Attorney and also as the psychotic killer that is Two.
I:17943;1938;Heath Ledger was a perfect Joker and I feel like it got the praise it warranted, but I feel all three leads deserved just as much recognition.
I:17943;1939;This movie excels in every genre it approaches.
I:17943;1940;The Joker portrayed by Heath Ledger is done so well its chilling.
I:17943;1941;The movie is great and all but Heath's joker is the highlight of the movie, hands down!
I:17943;1942;I've watched thousands of movies and I've never experienced anything like this, his joker was just surreal, I'm just in awe of how amazing he done.
I:17943;1943;Heath will be missed and this role was memorable performance like no other.
I:17943;1944;"The movie is awesome all together, the way they tied the story together is cool, and Bale's performance is solid, I only wish that ""the other villain"" got to stick around longer, maybe get carried on to the next Batman movie."
I:17943;1945;The dark knight limited edition with the batpod makes the perfect gift for any body who just loved seeing the movie but also having all the extras that comes with it in the blu.
I:17943;1946;Enjoyed this movie in IMAX and love it on my 55 in tv as well.
I:17943;1947;Everyone should watch The Dark Knight at lest once in their Life time!
I:17943;1948;Christopher Nolan gives us the best Batman movie to date.
I:17943;1949;"With an amazing performance by Heath "" The Joker"""
I:17943;1950;"perfect Batman movie
I:17943;1951;Magical moments, memories and faces routinely come and go on the silver screen, but a role this iconic only comes around once or twice a generation, and the power of his appearance has been amplified over the years.
I:17943;1952;The things his character gets to do, say, and imply are downright remarkable, and really elevate this from a very good superhero movie into a brilliant social commentary that just so happens to revolve around a man with a cape, cowl and vast personal armory.
I:17943;1953;As in Batman Begins, the supporting cast is heavily peppered with brilliant performances from Hollywood's heavy.
I:17943;1954;hitters, with particularly excellent showings from Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and Aaron Eckhart, and once again Christian Bale masterfully inhabits the dual roles of Bruce Wayne and Batman.
I:17943;1955;Great acting and well produced.
I:17943;1956;An excellent addition to the Batman collection for the fan.
I:17943;1957;Heath Ledger plays an amazing performance as the joker!
I:17943;1958;This is definitely my favorite Batman movie!
I:17943;1959;I almost always enjoy anything Batman, being a fan from childhood, many years ago.
I:17943;1960;this film of course has some bitter sweet points to it, with the death of the star of the film.
I:17943;1961;many lines are truely believable as being the Joker's reason for his scars.
I:17943;1962;alfred's line, 'some people just like to see the world burn', is very striking and true.
I:17943;1963;Probably the strongest line of wisdom he has ever given.
I:17943;1964;still, a very good film.
I:17943;1965;Afterwards I will find you and beat you unretarded!!!
I:17943;1966;the late Heath Ledger was brilliant as the Joker.
I:17943;1967;this was just an incredible movie.
I:17943;1968;Worth watching over and over to catch up on scenes are see what you missed last time.
I:17943;1969;Jack was a great Joker for 1989 and Health was great for 2008.
I:17943;1970;The Dark Knight introduces two new characters.
I:17943;1971;He will offer Harvey Dent the choice of justice or revenge.
I:17943;1972;And he will force the Dark Knight to choose between stopping evil and protecting the people he loves.
I:17943;1973;The Dark Knight is highly recommended to fans of the franchise as the ultimate in high tech film noir.
I:17943;1974;I don't have this version anymore but I did and its a great blu ray 2 disc set.
I:17943;1975;If you enjoy batman, you'll enjoy this
I:17943;1976;It has a nice weight and sounds like an actual coin when you flip it.
I:17943;1977;That good *ping* that you want from a coin.
I:17943;1978;I dont need to rate thie movie as its already a big block buster and all time best batman movie.
I:17943;1979;The movie came in a very fast timeframe and was exactly what I thought it would be.
I:17943;1980;The thing which makes it five stars is that the price was amazing, the delivery was fast, and who doesn't like the Dark Knight?
I:17943;1981;The movie is even better after you watch it again and again.
I:17943;1982;The best part of the extras/features is the IMAX scenes!!
I:17943;1983;Would have loved to have more 'behind.
I:17943;1984;Once again Christian Bale has delivered a superb prefprmance.
I:17943;1985;He is the best Batman ever and it's just a shame there will be no more.
I:17943;1986;The Dark Knight was truly a wonderful movie!
I:17943;1987;this movie was an obvious winner!
I:17943;1988;To begin, the movie itself is good.
I:17943;1989;Worth adding to your collection.
I:17943;1990;I just got the movie for Christmas, so I guess that's what I get for waiting.
I:17943;1991;It's like selling a car, and then selling the tires separately.
I:17943;1992;i'd give it one star, but as I said, it's a good movie.
I:17943;1993;Good let the freeks and geeks have it.
I:17943;1994;You can make an amount like that on Wall Street and it can still be made by people who do not know any better.
I:17943;1995;With writing more complex than any comic book movie before it, perfect casting and equally perfect acting, masterful directing, and breathtaking cinematography and special effects make this movie a watershed achievement, not only in its genre but in the history of filmmaking.
I:17943;1996;top cartoon like Jack Nicholson's portrayal of the character in the Tim Burton film.
I:17943;1997;Some more cynical minds believe that the Oscar buzz the performance has received (and the films' $530 million box ofice take) is due to Ledger's very sudden and very public demise, but those people downplay Ledger's horrfyingly brilliant performance.
I:17943;1998;Christian Bale once again proves why he is the best Batman of them all, a man who is conflicted between his quest for justice and his desire to live a normal life, and finds his own moral codes and dedication to the mission tested by a nemesis whom follows no rules and knows no fear.
I:17943;1999;aaron Eckhart would give the film's other breakthrough performance as Harvey Dent, Gotham's championing District Attorney, determined to clean up Gotham's streets.
I:17943;2000;caliber actors as Holmes did.
I:17943;2001;ray gets four stars instead of five is because of its paltry special features.
I:17943;2002;"Sure, there are the cool ""Psychology of Batman"" and ""Batman Tech"" features and the ""Gotham Tonight"" faux news clips featuring Anthony Michael Hall's Mike Engel character that made their rounds on the internet during the film's brilliant viral marketing campaign."
I:17943;2003;so in all great movie, but the Blu.
I:17943;2004;One of the great movies of the last several years, the performances are epic, and the storyline goes beyond the basic superhero saves the world theme.
I:17943;2005;ray is a good deal in comparison to other high definition discs, and it highlights the scenes of the movie in a way that you cannot enjoy without the fine details.
I:17943;2006;great movie, tons of action, awesome ending.
I:17943;2007;really inspiring had a great plot and they did a really good job on this movie
I:17943;2008;Got it for a super price .
I:17943;2009;"In ""Batman Begins,"" Christopher Nolan managed to do what few directors could do ."
I:17943;2010;create a dark, gritty atmosphere around an all.
I:17943;2011;human Batman, who fights for the oppressed with quiet intensity.
I:17943;2012;endangered Gotham City, but brilliant acting of the hero and villains is what truly elevates the second of Nolan's Batman movies to a work of cinematic art.
I:17943;2013;Dent and Rachel Dawes' (Maggie Gyllenhaal) lives.
I:17943;2014;Instead Christopher Nolan creates a movie as dark, tightly.
I:17943;2015;wound and intense as Batman himself.
I:17943;2016;and Nolan's skills are even more polished this time around .
I:17943;2017;lots of kinetic action, vicious dogs and car chases, including the rather silly.
I:17943;2018;"but the most striking aspect of ""The Dark Knight"" is Nolan's delvings into morality ."
I:17943;2019;christian Bale is simply perfection as Bruce Wayne/Batman, using his handsomely chiseled face and piercing eyes to best advantage .
I:17943;2020;even in the most tragic scenes, where you can practically see Wayne's soul bleeding.
I:17943;2021;There's also a solid (and underrated) supporting cast .
I:17943;2022;Eckhart is outstanding as an upstanding DA whose morality becomes horribly perverted (along with his handsome face), Gyllenhaal has a solid role that she plays well, and Michael Caine is a quiet, steady flame as the ever.
I:17943;2023;The Dark Knight is suffused with darkness and some truly ghastly villains, but the magnificent acting and dryly witty script are what really make this a masterpiece.
I:17943;2024;and promises better yet to come.
I:17943;2025;In the hands of the director, Christopher Nolan, THE DARK KNIGHT works extremely wellOur super.
I:17943;2026;much talk about Heath Ledger, and he was great, but really, all of the actors were wonderful.
I:17943;2027;christian Bale, Aaron Eckhart, Michael Caine, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Eric Roberts and the rest of the cast add to the final tally, which is a very entertaining movieThe story, the production design, the score, the stunts and special effects are also great too.
I:17943;2028;The Dark Knight is possibly the best movie ever.
I:17943;2029;Heath Ledger is amazing and terrifying, and you get an extra hour of movie footage after it seems like the movie is ending.
I:17943;2030;It is entertaining but also has something to say about human nature.
I:17943;2031;Batman and Joker are great antithetical characters representing the best and worst in humanity.
I:17943;2032;Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker is a landmark in cinema history and a must see for even the casual fan of film.
I:17943;2033;I highly recommend this film.
I:17943;2034;It's amazing how the Batman series has managed to reinvent itself time and time again.
I:17943;2035;From it's inception in comic books decades ago, to this, it's latest reincarnation, it has never ceased to amaze the viewing public.
I:17943;2036;Visually the film is stunning and every action packed scene is superbly rendered, while never stretching reality too far beyond traditional Batman limits.
I:17943;2037;Christian Bale is as good a Batman as we have seen in a long time, and who could forget Heath Ledger as Joker.
I:17943;2038;There are those out there, certainly some amazon reviewers, who claim that the merits of Ledger's performance have been exaggerated due to his death.
I:17943;2039;He brought a passion to the part that was breathtaking, as well as certain idosyncrasies that I'm sure will be carried on by future actors.
I:17943;2040;older Batman fans will be happy to see that this installment is a fantastic addition to the Batman canon.
I:17943;2041;Younger movie goers are also sure to be won over by it.
I:17943;2042;If you liked Batman begins you should like this one.
I:17943;2043;I enjoyed the movie very very much.
I:17943;2044;This was so enjoyable to watch.
I:17943;2045;This will certainly be considered the best yet and a collectors item.
I:17943;2046;Amazon is just as great!
I:17943;2047;Among the many satisfying surprises within this elaborately produced 2008 film, the primary one is that it is at heart, a first.
I:17943;2048;driven psychological thriller that uses the familiar franchise to ask hard questions about our individual accountability at a time when anarchy and terrorism are running rampant.
I:17943;2049;ego Bruce Wayne, Batman is quite impressed with Dent's seemingly intractable sense of decency.
I:17943;2050;With his brother Jonathan as co. scenarist, Nolan provides a boldly intellectual perspective to this movie that never gives into easy answers, and the complexities are compounded by the intense feelings that fluctuate between what we expect our heroes to do and what we should expect from ourselves.
I:17943;2051;it's a precarious line that Nolan balances with edgy conviction, and the classic good.
I:17943;2052;Four of the key actors from the first film return starting with Christian Bale's covertly charged performance in the elusive title role.
I:17943;2053;Ironically, it's his moments as Wayne that seem comparatively prosaic in conveying his outward cynicism.
I:17943;2054;Neither is particularly challenged here, but both perform with their usual authority.
I:17943;2055;As Dent, Aaron Eckhardt effectively manages the film's biggest character arc, and he is really the one whose inevitable transformation most clearly illustrates the story's central themes.
I:17943;2056;faced grin, it's a grandly idiosyncratic performance full of shrewd wit and opera.
I:17943;2057;I see a sharply talented actor having the time of his life.
I:17943;2058;Not surprisingly, all the production values are great with the architectural splendor of Chicago more obviously subbing for Gotham City this time out.
I:17943;2059;Flaws are relatively minimal and actually carry over from the first film.
I:17943;2060;ups and quick edits that impinge on the clarity of the action presented.
I:17943;2061;Regardless, the film is an impressive achievement, and along with Jon Favreau'sIron Manearlier this year, may represent the pinnacle of DC and Marvel Comics on celluloid.
I:17943;2062;One of the best movies ever made in my opinion.
I:17943;2063;Great cast, script, and special effects.
I:17943;2064;Really enjoyed Heath Ledger's performance as the JOKER.
I:17943;2065;Very happy he won Best Supporting Actor, the movie should have been nominated for Best Picture, at least.
I:17943;2066;ray library, highly recommend it.
I:17943;2067;This is the best performance of Batman.
I:17943;2068;Heath Ledge as the Joker was stunning.
I:17943;2069;If you liked Batman Begins you'll love this.
I:17943;2070;Awesome movie :) Batman is amazing as always, Heath Ledgers final performance couldn't be any more amazing, and it keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole movie.
I:17943;2071;Awesome movie, even if you are not a fan of comics or superhero movies but like action movies you cant go wrong whit this one
I:17943;2072;One of the best in the series.
I:17943;2073;It goes beyond special effects and action and delivers excellent character development and depth.
I:17943;2074;In this way, they may enjoy the film without wasting thought on the details that bugged me.
I:17943;2075;"I'll still indulge myself by reinforcing some of the things that are undeniably cool about ""Dark Knight"" but my goal is to prepare you to enjoy it despite its problems."
I:17943;2076;It's the stuff that goes on right under their noses that boggles the mind.
I:17943;2077;Explosives in huge quantities and in improbable places get moved around this city without suspicion.
I:17943;2078;Some plans are so grand that they raised serious questions of plausibility.
I:17943;2079;As complete and compelling as the story is, could it have been 2 films?
I:17943;2080;I'm pushing it here, but it might have been 2 great films instead of one really good film.
I:17943;2081;"I don't believe winning an Oscar is always indicative of great work
I:17943;2082;In cases of death, sometimes the Oscar is a sympathy award given posthumously.
I:17943;2083;In this case he earned it.
I:17943;2084;rEINFORCING THE GOODBesides Heath Ledger, the one thing that makes this film so compelling is the story.
I:17943;2085;Most importantly, it explores our willingness to comply with the corrupt status quo.
I:17943;2086;"despite the cinematic proliferation of computer graphics, the visual effects are so convincing that you are left questioning ""how did they do that?"""
I:17943;2087;The car stunts are unique and entertaining while all of the actors pull more than their weight.
I:17943;2088;In fact, if I didn't complain about it, it was well done.
I:17943;2089;vIGILANTE VERDICTThis is by far my favorite Batman film.
I:17943;2090;"If I succeed in this, you will probably have even more fun than I did watching the best ""Bat"" movie ever."
I:17943;2091;the IMAX scenes which are the scenes that take up the whole screen, are very good.
I:17943;2092;You already know this movie is amazing and I do not need to tell you why.
I:17943;2093;"I have Batman Begins which included the first six minutes of The Dark Knight and was the most beautiful thing to ever transmit from my PS3 to my 50"" plasma."
I:17943;2094;If Warner Bros. does this right (and I can only assume they will), this movie will look stunning beyond compare.
I:17943;2095;It is clear the direction and cinematography are superior, but on Blu.
I:17943;2096;ray this movie will stand alone.
I:17943;2097;the movie itself, well, in my top.5 all.
I:17943;2098;"Christopher Nolan's superb script and direction, along with some of the best actors on the planet, merge to create one of the best crime dramas of all time (and if you want to consider it a ""superhero"" movie, the superlative of the genre without question)."
I:17943;2099;All I can say is thank you to Christopher Nolan and crew for rebooting a damn.
I:17943;2100;My favorite comic book hero is back and better than ever.
I:17943;2101;He just shows us futhermore in this movie just how noble he is.
I:17943;2102;He is a formidable enemy played brillaintly by Heath Ledger.
I:17943;2103;It is an epic tale of good vs. evil and it actually compells you to be a better person.
I:17943;2104;That is very rare in movies today.
I:17943;2105;It was a great movie despite the violence and I hope Batman 3 comes out soon!
I:17943;2106;The Dark Knight is a great movie, and if all you're looking for is the feature film, this is a great product.
I:17943;2107;This item was exactly as described, and was received right on time.
I:17943;2108;But these last two, wow.
I:17943;2109;The Dark Knight was phenomenal.
I:17943;2110;Heath, RIP, did an amazing job.
I:17943;2111;He captured the joker better than I could have ever imagined.
I:17943;2112;Now Katie Holmes was a good Rachel, a believable Rachel.
I:17943;2113;Simple kind of pretty, yet elegant and strong.
I:17943;2114;other than Ms. Gyllenhaal, the film was excellent.
I:17943;2115;And I hear it leads well into the next one?
I:17943;2116;Speaking of which: you need to see this movie in IMAX if it all possible (they're doing a re.
I:17943;2117;It's worth the extra few bucks, trust me.
I:17943;2118;Christopher Nolan shot at least 6 scenes in the movie using IMAX cameras, and it shows.
I:17943;2119;down the best comic book movie ever made.
I:17943;2120;This is Batman the way it was meant to be experienced and really combines the elements that make Batman my favorite comic book/animated series.
I:17943;2121;I think I'll go with the acting: Heath Ledger steals the show as Joker among an already incredible cast.
I:17943;2122;"He's so good that I'm sure Jack Nicholson will see it and say, ""Wow, he was good!"""
I:17943;2123;If you ever doubted his abilities as an actor, this movie will embarrass you.
I:17943;2124;"He was in the first movie and he is here also
I:17943;2125;Maggie Gyllenhaal really steals Rachel Dawes from Katie Holmes because it will amaze you that Katie Holmes ever could have been Rachel Dawes.
I:17943;2126;I always felt that Gyllenhaal was underrated and it shows in this film.
I:17943;2127;Aaron Eckhart was the perfect man to play Harvey Dent.
I:17943;2128;I love the dark humor because I love dark humor in general, and the delivery is always impeccable.
I:17943;2129;watch value to the film.
I:17943;2130;There's so many little details to appreciate and the cinematography is so spot.
I:17943;2131;on that you can't help but want to watch certain scenes again and again.
I:17943;2132;The haunting imagery in this movie will likely stick with you, but you have to appreciate the fact that these characters are likely to stick with you.
I:17943;2133;You really care about them and feel involved in their lives.
I:17943;2134;i give this movie an A+ with my highest recommendation for you to run out and see it right now.
I:17943;2135;rAY SETDoes it look every bit as good on Blu.
I:17943;2136;For the most part, yes.
I:17943;2137;The IMAX scenes are pretty much breathtaking.
I:17943;2138;The edges are razor sharp all around and I can't recall seeing any artifacts.
I:17943;2139;The score shines pretty well also.
I:17943;2140;It's best to start playing one, pause it immediately, and then go make yourself hot cocoa while it buffers the video so that you can actually watch it continuously.
I:17943;2141;My cable Internet isn't the bad, but I can stream videos just fine on my laptop.
I:17943;2142;the other features are pretty good though.
I:17943;2143;There's about 90 minutes worth of that stuff, and they're pretty fascinating overall.
I:17943;2144;I had never seen an IMAX camera before watching the featurette on it, and it's incredible to imagine how they filmed any action on that thing.
I:17943;2145;I thought that they were pretty well.
I:17943;2146;done and great ways to lend another level of realism to this character and world on top of what the movie has to blot out the abominations of Batman Forever and Batman and Robin.
I:17943;2147;I especially liked the Unmasked one, a psychological analysis of Batman, because part of what I always liked about him was how dark and gritty and real he would always feel and that he was even thrown into Arkham himself once.
I:17943;2148;sometimes, he picked ones that I thought were kind of dumb or already answered in other features on the disc, but there were a lot of insightful questions answered about the casting, nuances of the story, origins and inspirations, etc.
I:17943;2149;I'd love to see them do more live events with actors from the film or even Batman comic experts.
I:17943;2150;I had to tell people at work about it and actually brought a couple over to see the difference.
I:17943;2151;I absolutely love this movie.
I:17943;2152;yeah i like it that much and wanted the blu ray basically cause the price was right.
I:17943;2153;The batpod looks cool and people just love it.
I:17943;2154;Movie is great also w tons of bonus features.
I:17943;2155;great action movie that is entertaining and keeps you guess at every corner.
I:17943;2156;its a movie worth owning and watching often.
I:17943;2157;"instead, In my opinion:~Revive the ""Red Mask"" story, perhaps with ""The Joker""."
I:17943;2158;and forces them to make a decision by midnight!
I:17943;2159;the rest of the movie was good, but sometimes seemed a bit to into itself.
I:17943;2160;Overall it was a fun movie, with great drama, tension, and fighting scenes, but it could have been better.
I:17943;2161;He sounded muffled and coarse.
I:17943;2162;I have a pretty good sound system that I've used with many other movies, so it seems like the problem stemmed from the film recording itself.
I:17943;2163;Despite Christian Bale getting top billing, Ledger played a more important, challenging role in the film.
I:17943;2164;"Wayne is well defined from Batman Begins and the Joker is firmly established in the prologue, a bank heist in which all the accomplices are shot and the Joker issues his tenet, which is a twist on Nietzsche: ""What doesn't kill you makes you stranger."
I:17943;2165;The bulk of the character development focuses on Dent's complicated descent from a dedicated, fearless political figure, passionate about defeating criminals using the rule of law.
I:17943;2166;Dent is able to achieve popularity and make good on his promise to put violent mafia figures behind bars mainly because Batman is willing to do the dirty work and get no credit for it.
I:17943;2167;As Batman's success in the streets and Dent's success in the courtroom push the mob organizations into an increasingly small corner, the Joker appeals to the mob bosses and rallies them against Batman.
I:17943;2168;With some words of inspiration from the Joker, Dent transforms himself into Two.
I:17943;2169;face uses the coin to determine the fate of his victims.
I:17943;2170;This core message of The Dark Knight is demonstrated in a subplot about telecommunications surveillance taken right from the front pages of newspapers during the US debate about the Homeland Security Act of 2007.
I:17943;2171;face in order to defeat the Joker and restore faith to the people of Gotham.
I:17943;2172;Some things are more important than public perception.
I:17943;2173;approximating the viewing experience in IMAX theaters, the Blu.
I:17943;2174;ray version of The Dark Knight shifts between 1.78:1 and 2.4:1 sequences, which is a tremendous asset in preserving the vision of the filmmaker and in attempting to get an IMAX.
I:17943;2175;The prologue, as well as other 1.78:1 sequences, appear with lifelike detail and good depth.
I:17943;2176;slight glow effect that makes the bright areas of some scenes appear heightened.
I:17943;2177;Meanwhile, the black level is remarkable as it conveys all gradations of grey and retains very good definition.
I:17943;2178;there's just more presence in the scenes shot using the IMAX cameras.
I:17943;2179;Perhaps the most extraordinary scene to view the differences is when Batman raids the high rise building in Hong Kong to extract Lau (Chin Han).
I:17943;2180;While the IMAX picture is preferable because of a greater sense of depth and resolution, the 2.4:1 content shares its small, gentle grain and otherwise clean, highly detailed presentation.
I:17943;2181;The anchoring across the center channel delivers all the dialog, while the front left and right speakers provide the bulk of the score.
I:17943;2182;Aside from the sound effects and subwoofer content, the soundtrack mostly disappears in the action and visuals.
I:17943;2183;Looking back on it, that is a unique accomplishment for an action film, to be such a visual work of art that one hardly notices the score as sound.
I:17943;2184;Gordon's and Dent's voices are perfectly reproduced, crisp and detailed, yet they sound slightly anemic compared to Batman's deeper, more open voice.
I:17943;2185;While the audio engineering is actually very good, the bass emphasis can overshadow the more relaxed dialog, especially Gordon's voice.
I:17943;2186;an impressive bit of stuntwork.
I:17943;2187;warner's BD is a must.
I:17943;2188;One of the best movies of the last year (if not the best) in 1920x1080 resolution.
I:17943;2189;and an important bonus is the Digital Copy.
I:17943;2190;"I really enjoyed this movie
I:17943;2191;I liked the pacing of the movie, especially in the second half.
I:17943;2192;heath Ledger did a great job here, and I don't feel he stole the show like Jack Nicholson did.
I:17943;2193;face was so funny, and also afterward when he blows up the hospital.
I:17943;2194;i did kind of miss the gothic Tim Burton sets that we have grown used to seeing, but it was interesting seeing Batman operate in a modern skyscraper jungle.
I:17943;2195;I think it sets up many very interesting possibilities if they ever do another sequel.
I:17943;2196;And he still has to finish rebuilding Stately Wayne Manor!
I:17943;2197;Bought this for my son.
I:17943;2198;He is a big fan of batman.
I:17943;2199;But is it the greatest motion picture ever made?You're kidding, right?As a life.
I:17943;2200;"But to me, is it the ""be all, end all"" of Batman films."
I:17943;2201;"truth be told, I found this as much ""fun"" as Batman Begins."
I:17943;2202;I guess it's just a sign of the times, with the whole world outside the theatre on a forever terrorist alert, that the film take on that vibe on as well.
I:17943;2203;face, I thought he was great in the part, up until he actually became Two.
I:17943;2204;The explosions were loud and well shot, the action when on the screen was very visual, and each actor took to their part like it really was them.
I:17943;2205;overall, as faithful as the Batworld created by Frank Miller's 1989 The Dark Knight Returns, and very riveting to see and hear.
I:17943;2206;This movie moves faster and is far more entertaining than its predecessor, Batman Begins.
I:17943;2207;rich, affecting a bored and callous exterior that allegedly conceals profound depths of emotion.
I:17943;2208;But of course Batman is ultimately successful, and this completes this sadistic bedtime story.
I:17943;2209;I will concede that this was one of the best pictures of the last year.
I:17943;2210;"It is a great Batman movie, though perhaps it has received more praise than it deserves as a ""philosophical statement."""
I:17943;2211;Primarily it is a great action movie that does not cheat characterization and motivation of the characters.
I:17943;2212;ray, but from all accounts it is very good.
I:17943;2213;So let's make it a four.
I:17943;2214;This film is great on so many levels.
I:17943;2215;From the acting to action, the look and the sound, a flawless execution in cinematography.
I:17943;2216;This film was able to make comic book movies a viable threat in the mainstream.
I:17943;2217;My favorite movie over the last decade by far and a must.
I:17943;2218;see for anyone who enjoys action.
I:17943;2219;He really stole the show giving the best and most memorable performance of his career.
I:17943;2220;"Don't get me wrong, I am a huge fan of the original, but if you compare this film with ""The Dark Knight"", its like night and day."
I:17943;2221;Michael Keaton to me will always be remembered for being the original Batman and Jack Nicholson was so perfect for the Joker.
I:17943;2222;The film is a classic.
I:17943;2223;"in a generation that demands action, ""The Dark Knight"" delivers to the tenth degree, giving the most explosive, heart pounding, thrill ride Batman has ever endured."
I:17943;2224;Easily the best film of the year.
I:17943;2225;I'm a huge fan of Nolan's Batman run and this was a great movie.
I:17943;2226;I knew what I was going to witness and was able to suspend my disbelief, and just enjoy the movie.
I:17943;2227;Much better the second time around.
I:17943;2228;I love the movie, especially on Blu.
I:17943;2229;I've watched it now about a dozen times, and I'll probably watch it a bunch more.
I:17943;2230;ray came with those history channel specials, and there is one on the first disc, but.
I:17943;2231;ray, esp the IMAX scenes, are amazing!
I:17943;2232;I think this movie is by far the best of the 3 Christopher Nolan Batman series.
I:17943;2233;Heath Ledger's portrayal of the joker is so good, it's scary.
I:17943;2234;i loved the plot and the way it was just relentless with only a few breaks in the action.
I:17943;2235;ray version and this is what I found:Disc 1 .
I:17943;2236;The movie itself is on this one.
I:17943;2237;This also has The Dark Knight IMAX scenes that you can watch along with the film or seperately.
I:17943;2238;They are Prologue, Hong Kong, Armored Car Chase, Lamborghini Crash, Prewitt Building and Final Montage.
I:17943;2239;Originally seen during the Summer of 2008 on The History Channel, this special discusses the weapons and technology that makes Batman the comic legend he is and shows which gagets are actually possible in real life!Batman Unmasked: The Psychology Of The Dark Knight .
I:17943;2240;This was also on The History Channel during the summer and it discusses the psyche of Batman as if he were a real person with both comic writers and psychologists!
I:17943;2241;face, The Riddler, The Penguin, Catwoman and The Scarecrow are also discussed.
I:17943;2242;Bats' greatest enemy, The Joker, gets his own segment and is discussed as well!Gotham News .
I:17943;2243;ray experience was crisp and clean!
I:17943;2244;An awesome experience with an awesome movie!
I:17943;2245;When a film can have me that mesmorized and have me nearly out of breath watching, then its a damn good film!
I:17943;2246;i have a 360 so i played it there and i dont know if that helped but the movie looks fullscreen entirely and with very good definition.
I:17943;2247;The sound is excellent and i know these because i have 360 with an optical output so ergo, it sounds awesome.
I:17943;2248;So im happy even though something went wrong with my item
I:17943;2249;The dark knight is sweet with the Joker and 2Face aka Harvy Dent.
I:17943;2250;It is the best superhero movie ever!!!!!!
I:17943;2251;year after year i see less and less films available for VHS!
I:17943;2252;First up, the movie, The Dark Knight is great.
I:17943;2253;Another great Batman movie in the series lots of great action and good characters and 2disc special is a good deal for the price
I:17943;2254;The product was delivered rapidly and arrived in excellent condition.
I:17943;2255;The disc was unscratched and played perfectly.
I:17943;2256;Don't get me wrong on the 3 star rating, I love this movie.
I:17943;2257;If you love the original Batman movies.
I:17943;2258;Im not going to try to outdo the sea of reviews that precede me I will just simply say that this is an awesome movie that is worth every penny you spend on it.
I:17943;2259;even if you dont like or care about the Batman franchise you are still bound to like this action packed movie.
I:17943;2260;I should have known that he had the chops for it by his stunning performance as a gay cowboy in Brokeback Mountain.
I:17943;2261;There were twists on top of twists on top of even more twists that kept you guessing, too.
I:17943;2262;I walked away a little overwhelmed, but thought the movie was solid and well worth the price of admission.
I:17943;2263;thats the best film ever produced in 2008it has both a spectacular thrilling story and a topactors ( christian bale ) is one of the best actors in the worldat this moment, thought i cant forget the most interesting charachterwhich is the joker.
I:17943;2264;i loved the previous Batman film,Batman Begins.
I:17943;2265;i thought it was brilliant,possibly the best superhero movie ever made.
I:17943;2266;I love the Batpod and this is nice, simple model of it.
I:17943;2267;The movie is excellent .
I:17943;2268;The model is nice .
I:17943;2269;it's one of the best movies of 2008 in a package that includes some very solid extras.
I:17943;2270;making extras that pop up at various points during the film if you enable them.
I:17943;2271;They give you great looks into the makings of the film.
I:17943;2272;The digital copy is a sweet bonus as well.
I:17943;2273;The seller was very honest, quick to ship and the product was just what I wanted!
I:17943;2274;My teenager was very happy this Christmas!
I:17943;2275;The Joker version of its cover with its uniqueness has made this one more than just worth collecting .
I:17943;2276;Also a good price from Amazon!!!
I:17943;2277;I highly recommend this version of this movie!!!
I:17943;2278;The Dark Knight, the second of the three part series is a great tour de force movie that really hits home for the fans and the curious partakers alike.
I:17943;2279;This version, a rather fun variant from the others, features a Joker cover with a fun Joker oriented display on the back detailing the movie.
I:17943;2280;For this to be his last performance is sadly ironic since it was done so very well.
I:17943;2281;the movie itself is well done, and sets up the final movie well enough.
I:17943;2282;Saw this in the theater the first time, and it is more than worth seeing again on Blu.
I:17943;2283;So clear, so vivid, just wonderful.
I:17943;2284;I actually enjoyed it more at home, on this video, with all the wonderful extras.
I:17943;2285;I saw this with some other people, and we all thought that it was too long, but that the special effects were spectacular.
I:17943;2286;It's an unbelievably good movie.
I:17943;2287;It's more than just a superhero movie: it's a crime drama that gives us a good, hard look at the human psyche.
I:17943;2288;and a good opponent for Batman.
I:17943;2289;There's more to praise about this film.
I:17943;2290;In another exploration of the darker corners of our minds, the film reveals just what lengths some people will go to bring wrongdoers to justice.
I:17943;2291;face, and his subsequent conversation with Joker, is one of the many highlights of a spectacular movie.
I:17943;2292;alfred (Michael Caine) and Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) are excellent supporters for Batman.
I:17943;2293;Alfred, one of my favorite characters of the whole franchise, drops several nuggets of wisdom throughout the film, and Lucius oozes cool by adding a dry sense of humor.
I:17943;2294;out likable characters in the series.
I:17943;2295;And Maggie Gyllenhaal is a much better Rachel Dawes than Katie Holmes and quite good in her own right .
I:17943;2296;sufficient, more interesting, less of a stock character.
I:17943;2297;the cast is excellent, and the primary reason why I love this film so much.
I:17943;2298;The Joker especially provided many memorable lines.
I:17943;2299;The direction and set pieces are stunning.
I:17943;2300;The plot is simple .
I:17943;2301;I saw it twice in one weekend, and I never see films multiple times.
I:17943;2302;I have friends who don't even like superhero movies that loved The Dark Knight.
I:17943;2303;It's definitely my pick for the best film of 2008 thus far, and it's one of my all.
I:17943;2304;shoulders above all other superhero films.
I:17943;2305;I wanted to watch this movie again, before going to the cinema to watch the new batman movie.
I:17943;2306;Thought I'd give it a chance.
I:17943;2307;Watched once, could care less to see it again.
I:17943;2308;'It's the greatest super hero EVER!'
I:17943;2309;, 'It's one of the greatest movies EVER!'
I:17943;2310;firstly, the movie strikes a dark and twisted realism that is very well done, giving a certain tone to the film that separates it from others.
I:17943;2311;It's gritty and chilling to say the least.
I:17943;2312;because that's right kids, The Joker, terrorist and mass.
I:17943;2313;Also, A Dark Knight would imply some murder to his methods, as is, he's more of a white knight, because he captures and brings to justice.
I:17943;2314;speaking of the late great Heath Ledger, his performance is not only his best, but worthy of all the hype.
I:17943;2315;The rest of the cast is eqally excellent, from Bale to Gyllenhaal, from Caine to Freeman.
I:17943;2316;Aaron Eckhart on the other hand gives a severely underrated performance, as he gives equally spine.
I:17943;2317;But that doesn't mean this movie is the great, as I would even argue Batman Begins is a little better, and Iron Man still ranks as the greatest super hero movie so far.
I:17943;2318;While putting up excellent performances and quite a few jaw.
I:17943;2319;Odds are you'll love this movie, but I'd personally would probably only watch it once.
I:17943;2320;No scratches, brand new and perfect.
I:17943;2321;So, lemmings of todays society, keep telling yourself how great this movie is.
I:17943;2322;I am sure another lemming will believe you.
I:17943;2323;The old blue and gray Batman costume is so much more cool than the black!
I:17943;2324;And practically anything from pre.1990 is infinitely better(music, movies, comics, clothing, PEOPLE) than anything going today!
I:17943;2325;The movie itself looks and sounds amazing.
I:17943;2326;The old school one is just that and that makes it fun, the first two Burton ones were really good in my opinion, and the final three were very cartoon/comic style fun.
I:17943;2327;"Then came ""Batman Begins"" which is arguably the best in the series and of all comic book films, I can see the case made for it."
I:17943;2328;The hype surrounding this film was extraordinary but I think it was well deserved as I loved this film.
I:17943;2329;I mean sure that added some I am sure but there is all the batman fans, DC comics fans, comic fans in general, fans of the film before this one, action fans and well fans of just good movies.
I:17943;2330;with excellent writing and picture perfect direction from Christopher Nolan this film could not help but be great.
I:17943;2331;The best thing about it still is the performances and of course you know who I mean.
I:17943;2332;Heath Ledger did an outstanding job on this film with his portrayal of the Joker.
I:17943;2333;Now the Joker is very arguably the greatest villain in all of comics, in fact I really thing he is.
I:17943;2334;But he could also be the greatest villain in all creative history, especially this version of him.
I:17943;2335;aside from Ledger [I could go on about his performance but every one else has] there is our lead Christian Bale who like in the first does a great job here.
I:17943;2336;Aaron Eckhart is absolutely wonderful as Harvey Dent better known as Two Face, great performance there.
I:17943;2337;Michael Caine once again is the perfect Alfred for these new films as is Gary Oldman as Commissioner Gordon.
I:17943;2338;Maggie Gyllenhaal is the new Rachel and a better one I think, and of course the always brilliant Morgan Freeman is just that, brilliant.
I:17943;2339;On a side note I loved that Cillian Murphy reprised his role of the Scarecrow in this film, brief but great.
I:17943;2340;His name is the Joker and he knows what he is doing, he is very good at doing that in which is what he does.
I:17943;2341;Basically he knows how to cause chaos better than any one ever, and he is very very good at it.
I:17943;2342;Enter Batman who is there to take up the challenge but Joker has a side game going, one that involves a man named Harvey Dent.
I:17943;2343;The digital copy means I can take this on the go.
I:17943;2344;To begin with, I loved the Dark Knight.
I:17943;2345;I think it was one of the best movies to come out in 2008.
I:17943;2346;i got the single disc full.
I:17943;2347;Starring a great cast of characters including Christian Bale and Heath Ledger, this is a great incarnation of Batman.
I:17943;2348;In this film Bruce Wayne, alias Batman (Bale), faces his biggest challenge to protect Gotham City yet in the form of the villainous Joker (Ledger) With the help of Commissioner Gordon, Harvey Dent, Lucius Fox, and of course Alfred, he works to bring peace.
I:17943;2349;Ledger's performance alone makes this movie a good one.
I:17943;2350;His unpredictable and chilling portrayal has the audience constantly intrigued.
I:17943;2351;The Dark Knight is the next installment in the Batman series right after Batman Begins.
I:17943;2352;The film's hype lasted quite awhile, and the movie was a huge success by both critics and in sales.
I:17943;2353;It is second only to Titanic as the highest grossing film of all time.
I:17943;2354;With that said, perhaps the bigger question is whether years down the road this film will have a place with the great films of all.
I:17943;2355;"Morgan Freeman's character probably sums up the Joker the best when he says that ""some men just want to see the world burn."""
I:17943;2356;In this way, this film, much like its predecessor, Batman Begins, involves the hero having to look inward into his soul to find strength, as oppose to using sheer physical prowess to try to vanquish the dark side.
I:17943;2357;And, thus, the ending leaves us to have to interpret whether Batman truly did make the right decision.
I:17943;2358;the Dark Knight is a fantastic film which definitely lives up to its hype: something hard to do in today's era of movie making.
I:17943;2359;The Dark Knight is a crime drama better than Batman Begins.
I:17943;2360;It is gripping and holds you to the very end.
I:17943;2361;Cristian Bale is a very good actor who plays Batman in this movie and the Joker portrayed by Heath Ledger is mesmarizing.
I:17943;2362;I liked the battle going on for the city and Batman's quest to rid the city of corruption.
I:17943;2363;I highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to be entertained and left wanting more.
I:17943;2364;The best batman movie ever in my opinion.
I:17943;2365;Great suspense, amazing action, you are not going to get bored.
I:17943;2366;Also, you will get to see the best joker performance of all time.
I:17943;2367;I am a Dark Knight freak, and this also is one of the best.
I:17943;2368;Thanks to the director and actors for a well done product.
I:17943;2369;Just another forgetable comic book movie.
I:17943;2370;Awesome Thanks Heath Ledger one of the best movies of all time, Heath Ledger should win the Academy Award.
I:17943;2371;His performance surpassed that of Jack Nicholson.
I:17943;2372;Gotta love the way Heath Ledger portrays the Joker, he totally nailed it!
I:17943;2373;This maniac killer totally creeps you out, well deserved Oscar for Heath.
I:17943;2374;This is one of the best super hero movies ever.
I:17943;2375;good story, good acting, and great movie.
I:17943;2376;ray also makes it that much better.
I:17943;2377;Adam West's version is super.
I:17943;2378;A Batman based in reality?
I:17943;2379;rated performance as the Joker.
I:17943;2380;The best part of the film is Two Face and they kill him off.
I:17943;2381;rated film that made millions, proving movie.
I:17943;2382;I don't understand what is so great about this movie.
I:17943;2383;It's a good action flick, but not the best or most exciting.
I:17943;2384;Iron Man is a much better super hero movie.
I:17943;2385;This is a great movie with lots of action and a great cast.
I:17943;2386;If you haven't seen it and are wondering if the Joker steals the show.
I:17943;2387;the answer is YES, and go see it.
I:17943;2388;I like it its for movies when you done watching to put them in only holds 2 movies the ones that it brings actually brings extra movies called that man behind the mask cool collectable
I:17943;2389;Christopher Nolan returns for this sequel to Batman Begins.
I:17943;2390;from an acting standpoint, this is probably one of the best Batman movies in that department.
I:17943;2391;Aaron Eckhart is also very good as Harvey Dent/Two.
I:17943;2392;face, he does have his moments when he can be over the top but for some reason that works very well.
I:17943;2393;this movie displays simply the best action scenes in the history of the Batman films.
I:17943;2394;While action was very good for the rest of the series, The Dark Knight takes it to another level.
I:17943;2395;cGI is also best in the series mainly because you'll have trouble telling which part is real and which part is CGI and that is always cool.
I:17943;2396;overall, The Dark Knight is one of the best Batman films ever made and while the movie does have its flaws it will still keep you on the edge of your seat.
I:17943;2397;Christian Bale is by far the best Bat Man.
I:17943;2398;Crime fighting is always a hit for me, and with Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman, two of the finest actors in film today, this movie gets high marks all round.
I:17943;2399;wait a second, practically every movie ever made.
I:17943;2400;That alone makes the newest The Dark Knight a cinematic event that must be seen by any cinema lover.
I:17943;2401;i liked the latest in the series of Batman movies a lot.
I:17943;2402;It is dynamic, appropriately dark and bleak, it is shot amazingly, staged artistically, the music by James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer truly adds to the atmosphere.
I:17943;2403;On the top of it, it is cleverly written and gives each character time and chance to become interesting and compelling.
I:17943;2404;With all that said I don't believe that The Dark Knight is the best movie ever and deserves its present #1 spot on the list of Top 250 film on IMDb.
I:17943;2405;He is a reason enough to see the movie.
I:17943;2406;"His Joker that reminds a lot another fun loving villain, ""horoshiy mal'chik Alex DeLarge, is absolutely brilliant and sadly the last work of the young actor who never got a chance to see his triumph on the screen and who without doubt will become a cult figure, an icon as it had happened with James Dean over 50 years ago4.5/9 or 9/10"
I:17943;2407;The Dark Knight is a great movie and would have been even better if they cut the entire Two Face storyline out.
I:17943;2408;heath Ledger, without question, is the best part of the movie.
I:17943;2409;When you see Batman fighting the Joker in the interrogation room, it's epic!
I:17943;2410;It is like watching something as big as David versus Goliath!
I:17943;2411;Every scene with the Joker is great, especially when he is with Batman.
I:17943;2412;She is a great actress, but looks way older than Bale out of place.
I:17943;2413;Overall, a really good movie
I:17943;2414;Its easy to imagine why The Dark Knight is one of the greatest films of 2008, if not the best.
I:17943;2415;A great ensemble cast mixed with fantastic a fantastic writer and composer turns this movie into more than just a great superhero flick but a cinematic achievement!The film may be a little overhyped but it definitely deserves the ratings it receives.
I:17943;2416;Christian Bale is a great Bruce Wayne/Batman (despite his somewhat amusing voice as Batman), Gary Oldman really shines as Jim Gordon (in fact I view him as the best part of the film), Aaron Eckhart surprises us all as Harvey Dent along with his alter.
I:17943;2417;Heath Ledger does a very memorable performance as The Joker.
I:17943;2418;Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine also does great in their roles and adds icing to the already very delicious cake!
I:17943;2419;The film is a great mix of action, drama, and a bit of comedy(just a bit).
I:17943;2420;The dark tone to the film is perfect for the world of Batman and is the main reason the film is so great!The Two.
I:17943;2421;Everyone will have to have this one for their collection.
I:17943;2422;I loved this movie since I saw it in the theater.
I:17943;2423;Best Joker ever (apologies to Jack N, whom I also think was a fantastic joker).
I:17943;2424;The blue ray transfer is especially good.
I:17943;2425;Switching to between wide and full screen formats really enhances the viewing experience for certain scenes, particularly the over the city flying scenes which are heavily CG, but beautiful on this disk.
I:17943;2426;Heath gives us an incredible performance .
I:17943;2427;Heath you're missed!This is the best Batman movie by far.
I:17943;2428;It's deserves more than 5 stars!
I:17943;2429;It comes without a whole heck of a lot of bells and whistles, but still has just enough to keep you satisfied.
I:17943;2430;now for our main feature, the film itself.
I:17943;2431;The acting performance turned in by Ledger was quite possibly the best I have ever seen.
I:17943;2432;Christian Bale is also sensational in lead.
I:17943;2433;Mix those two together with the always stellar Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman and the result is bound to be smashing.
I:17943;2434;the sound and special effects were also top notch.
I:17943;2435;The explosions felt fantastic and all the destruction seemed to be in sync.
I:17943;2436;The editing and directing hit me as spot on.
I:17943;2437;The plot mixed in the traditional love triangle/superhero's dilemma very well.
I:17943;2438;Beyond that, it is one of the very best movies I've ever seen.
I:17943;2439;while this film certainly packs a punch in the action and suspense department, the undertones of drama and philosophy come on particularly strong towards the end.
I:17943;2440;I have always loved the batman character.
I:17943;2441;and this movie is perfect.
I:17943;2442;I dont know how they are gonna top this one.
I:17943;2443;Heath Leger really captured what Joker really is.
I:17943;2444;Easily Batman's equal and easily his archenemy.
I:17943;2445;Noone ever portrayed the joker so realistic and so scary.
I:17943;2446;This movie easily tops the other batman movies.
I:17943;2447;I really look forward to this same team putting together another Batman movie.
I:17943;2448;Terrific comic book story done as a gritty, realistic, and often terrifying tale of morality, corruption, and the choices we make.
I:17943;2449;Bale is superb once again.
I:17943;2450;Gyllenhall is a fine replacement for Katey Homes (did anyone actually miss her?)
I:17943;2451;Gary Oldman (cast against type) is a remarkable everyman hero in the story as Gordon.
I:17943;2452;Terrifying, sadistic, and utterly beyond all redemption.
I:17943;2453;The Dark Knight lets good and evil have a lot of shades of gray.
I:17943;2454;In Avatar, the baddies are bad and the goodies are good.
I:17943;2455;The Dark Knight has us more involved in the story than the effects or technical elements.
I:17943;2456;This high def version is stunning to behold.
I:17943;2457;Crisp, detailed, razor sharp imagery.
I:17943;2458;The colors and blacks are inky and fully saturated.
I:17943;2459;The change between IMAX and 2:35 is awesome and makes the film more of an experience.
I:17943;2460;Blacks are beautifully rendered and never crushed, which is quite something given how dark the movie is.
I:17943;2461;The bass is foundation shking, with exhilarating ambient and directional sound effects.
I:17943;2462;Dialogue is crisp and never muddled.
I:17943;2463;this is a perfect transfer and demonstrates how amazing the technology is and what it can do to make a movie a new experience.
I:17943;2464;He is very human who can do super hero feats.
I:17943;2465;secondly, there is a love triangle.
I:17943;2466;Rachel is torn between her love for Bruce, her childhood sweetheart, who she knows is Batman, and Harvey who is every woman's White Knight who is fighting for truth and justice in the judicial halls of Gotham with danger and enemies on every side.
I:17943;2467;Harvey is as pure as they come in true comic book lore.
I:17943;2468;The usual assortment of 30's type gangsters are for comic relief.
I:17943;2469;The Joker's insanity is his genius, a pure sociopath who was abused by his father.
I:17943;2470;fifthly, you have the citizens of Gotham who both Batman and Harvey are pledged to protect, even though, there are moments when you wonder why since truth and justice to the citizenry is great as long as they don't have to sacrifice themselves for it.
I:17943;2471;This film shows human nature at its worst and its best.
I:17943;2472;sixthly, the noble elements of morality, friendship, love, and sacrifice have their part in a saga which plays out in the lives projected on the screen before us.
I:17943;2473;Like a Greek tragedy we are shocked and silently weep for the heroes as they march to their fate, predestined by the gods for their own amusements.
I:17943;2474;It is an intense film which brings a number of motifs together in a cohesive script.
I:17943;2475;all great stories share elements of triumph and tragedy.
I:17943;2476;One classic example of this is THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE.
I:17943;2477;Batman's ultimate sacrifice for Gotham City is a testament that sometimes a hero must become the villain for the greater good.
I:17943;2478;So this movie was a lot of fun to watch and it certainly did not disappoint even after all of the media hype.
I:17943;2479;Ledger's performance is so good that it leaves you kinda bummed at the end because you know there is obviously no way another Joker/Batman meeting will ever happen again, at least not at this level.
I:17943;2480;I got this for a nice deal and movie was a good watch.
I:17943;2481;indulgently leaves them in, proving what I have always thought, that he one of the most over.
I:17943;2482;rated directors of recent years.
I:17943;2483;In a movie about a well known super hero, the star is actually the villain.
I:17943;2484;A movie that has several twists and turns especially toward the end, it keeps me on the edge of my seat.
I:17943;2485;dark in the perception of the citizens is powerful.
I:17943;2486;ray picture is sharp and audio is clear.
I:17943;2487;Personally I thought Batman Begins was as better film with much more variety.
I:17943;2488;This is such a gripping movie, that before you know it, it's over.
I:17943;2489;After a terrific chase scene involving several truck's and the Bat.
I:17943;2490;Virtually everyone who's opinion I usually can trust just loved this movie last summer, but I couldn't get interested enough to go see it.
I:17943;2491;I watched it and it was good, but I found it so dark and brooding that for me, it less than pleasant even while being amazed at the visual experience, and awed by some of the performances.
I:17943;2492;so, if you are a Batman fan you will love it, if not.
I:17943;2493;I saw this film in the theater and it's a product of the time and culture in 2008 when it emerged.
I:17943;2494;Although many praised this film when it came out and a truck load of accolades have been dumped on it by a fan base that is almost fundamentalist in it's devotion to comic books films, both time and circumstances are putting things into a broader and more mature perspective.
I:17943;2495;Nolan got under the R rating simply by removing images of blood.
I:17943;2496;Added to the fact that it's a comic book film this ratings misnomer lead people to believe that they could take their children to the theater to watch it.
I:17943;2497;'Dark Knight' is an adult film for mature audiences that understand metaphors and deeper life themes.
I:17943;2498;There is more to be learned from real people who have lived real lives and confronted real evils through out history.
I:17943;2499;On the right you have the drug, financial and business lobbys and everything from people who believe that Obama is a crypto muslim, that Christ will return soon just before a soon to be apocalypse, and bigger guns are a right and the solution.
I:17943;2500;We need wise men to step forward to create a new culture that fosters unity.
I:17943;2501;Spiderman, the Avengers, and Batman aren't going to save the world.
I:17943;2502;lastly, It's been 4 years since the films release and the war in Iraq is won and over and off the news cycle.
I:17943;2503;And whats becoming evident now in a post Colorado shooting world is that America is a boiling pot and people are on the brink.
I:17943;2504;America was never perfect but it used to be a peaceful nation, hard working, relaxed, united in it's purpose, confident, enjoying it's enormous freedoms, raising it's children, going to church, going for walks in the park.
I:17943;2505;The young perish and the old linger.
I:17943;2506;That I should live to see the last days of my house.
I:17943;2507;Yes, THE DARK KNIGHT has proved to be entertaining and fun to watch, but is there something more to this action.
I:17943;2508;packed movie than just cheap thrills and explosions?
I:17943;2509;Some light spots in the summer included Robert Downey, Jr.'s comic book adaptation of IRON MAN, which received fabulous reviews from audiences and critics alike.
I:17943;2510;The film version of SEX AND THE CITY was had positive audience reactions with fair reviews and a good box office quota.
I:17943;2511;the film continued on past the bank heist and traveled down to the meat and bones of each of the characters, shedding light on the psychosis of each individual.
I:17943;2512;Nolan's screenplay (co. wrote with brother Jonathan Nolan) is among the best in the business.
I:17943;2513;This screenplay is up there with PULP FICTION and FARGO in greatest scripts ever and it is just a matter of time before Team Nolan will be as famous and well.
I:17943;2514;The screenplay played beautifully, like a gothic orchestral piece that flowed together masterfully with the direction and acting.
I:17943;2515;Nolan's direction complements the screenplay fantastically, using very dramatic themes mixed with action sequences that are unmatched in other superhero films.
I:17943;2516;nolan (who directed the 2000 thriller MEMENTO) can bring an antiquely story like Batman to life in an inventive and fresh style, choosing unlikely plot twists and gritty storylines that can shock even the most unwavering moviegoer.
I:17943;2517;Howard and Zimmer's composition is both frightening and tense at times, but then appropriately switches into heroic and empowering.
I:17943;2518;The music during the ferry scenes is especially noteworthy, heightening the tension to the breaking point.
I:17943;2519;the cast made the movie enticing and interesting, leaving the audience questioning the characters every minute of the film.
I:17943;2520;Christian Bale's performance as the title character was both dramatic and complex, showing an interesting side of Batman that hasn't been seen before.
I:17943;2521;Maggie Gyllenhaal (who replaced Katie Holmes, thank God) was perfect for the role of Rachel Dawes, Bruce Wayne's love interest.
I:17943;2522;Gyllenhaal's subtle yet effective acting techniques made her performance memorable and efficient.
I:17943;2523;Aaron Eckhart's performance was fantastic.
I:17943;2524;Just take my word for it, he's brilliant.
I:17943;2525;heath Ledger performed as the Joker, leaving the audiences with little breath in there lungs from the moment he appears on the screen.
I:17943;2526;People stared in awe as one of America's most beloved stars completely immersed himself into one of the darkest portrayals of all time.
I:17943;2527;Ledger makes himself utterly unrecognizable, a rarity with most actors these days.
I:17943;2528;Ledger's joker pulls the audience into the mind of a vicious sociopath, insanely painting a picture of the madman in everyone.
I:17943;2529;Ledger's untimely passing in January of this year was both unexpected and incredibly saddening.
I:17943;2530;After viewing the young actor's startling portrayal, audiences and critics all agree that Ledger could have been the next Brando or even better.
I:17943;2531;All in all, Ledger's performance stole the show and perhaps will even steal the Oscar.
I:17943;2532;tHE DARK KNIGHT is more than a comic book movie, but rather an intriguing crime drama that explores the deepest pathos of the criminal mind and surveys the age.
I:17943;2533;It's a rare film that displays great performances, pitch.
I:17943;2534;perfect direction, a spotless screenplay, and fantastic timing (even for its 2 1/2 hour running time).
I:17943;2535;It's everything that a moviegoer, a critic, and a filmmaker are looking for in a movie.
I:17943;2536;Internet Movie Database users agree that it is among the best.
I:17943;2537;"It's also been a fad for the past couple of years to nominate the films that are ""popular"" for best picture."
I:17943;2538;Is it possible that this revival of a DC Comic book can win Best Picture of the year at the Oscars?
I:17943;2539;The performances are fantastic, whether the Academy recognizes them or not.
I:17943;2540;Call it what you like, but THE DARK KNIGHT is definitely one of the greatest films ever made.
I:17943;2541;It's scary to me how easily people accept it in the theater.
I:17943;2542;i was both surprised and pleased with his performence(had very big doubts).
I:17943;2543;his back story is well very unclear:It works with the movie, as too the fact he always changes it.
I:17943;2544;bale is excellent once again,if there is too be a 3rd lets hope he keeps the contract.
I:17943;2545;a majority of the core cast is back.
I:17943;2546;and also in top form.
I:17943;2547;as this movie explores the humanity of both The Batman and the city he protects.
I:17943;2548;brings about inpersonators with guns.
I:17943;2549;right smack in the middle of a gang boss meeting.
I:17943;2550;telling them how and why there hold on Gothem is crumbling into the wind.
I:17943;2551;face is born,and his scared coin is the bringer of life and death.
I:17943;2552;just as his face now repasents both as well.
I:17943;2553;This movie was bought for someone else, but I heard it was a great movie,so I gave it 5 stars.
I:17943;2554;heath ledger played his roll best joker ever i think.
I:17943;2555;movie moves fast and great movie.
I:17943;2556;in my opinion, this is the best Batman movie EVER!!!
I:17943;2557;The Dark Knight is a great movie.
I:17943;2558;As a comic book collecting geek I really look forward to these Superhero flicks.
I:17943;2559;Batman Begins was a good movie .
I:17943;2560;The Dark Knight is even better.
I:17943;2561;Everybody knows the movie is fantastic, and I'm sure the transfer to blu.
I:17943;2562;ray is equally as impressive, but I received this product with a giant puncture mark through the case.
I:17943;2563;Acting, story and visual effects are fabulous.
I:17943;2564;ray player this is a great movie to have in Blu.
I:17943;2565;Just the best Batman movie ever!
I:17943;2566;The Joker steals this movie, he was awesome, the best villain ever portraid in a movie.
I:17943;2567;i thought story wise waaaaaay better then RIses.
I:17943;2568;i just really love the movie.
I:17943;2569;The insanity of the Joker makes the movie great, well played traps and great acting all around (even christian bale, i know right?)
I:17943;2570;Movie was so good that I went back again.
I:17943;2571;It holds the movie and over an hour of special features that could stand on their own .
I:17943;2572;The special features pull back the curtain on the movie.
I:17943;2573;making process and reveal some remarkable facts about this movie.
I:17943;2574;it took my breath away.
I:17943;2575;There's an hour long piece on how Batman developed and claims to delve into Batman's psychology.
I:17943;2576;This set will look great on your shelf.
I:17943;2577;Seeing all the iMax stuff behind the scenes was just fascinating.
I:17943;2578;I've developed a new appreciation for the work involved in making this masterpiece of a movie.
I:17943;2579;The IMAX scenes look amazing and it is not at all distracting.
I:17943;2580;It adds to the movie for sure!
I:17943;2581;Let me tell you this is the best movie I have ever seen and I have seen over a dozen times at least.
I:17943;2582;Heath Ledger did the most amazing job of playing America's most loved villain who just wants to watch the world burn.
I:17943;2583;This is easily the most overrated movie of all time.
I:17943;2584;Gee, that's a tough one!
I:17943;2585;face was the makeup/CGI job, which was outstanding and flawless, and is the REAL Oscar material of the movie.
I:17943;2586;squirting flower and a joy buzzer that electrocuted people, and liked to use a special gas/venom that caused its victims to laugh themselves to death.
I:17943;2587;The progression certainly makes sense.
I:17943;2588;The movie does a great job at keeping you feeling tense throughout.
I:17943;2589;The acting was incredible, by everybody.
I:17943;2590;I would make sweet sweet love to it if it were a female.
I:17943;2591;Heathwas the heart of the film and was brilliant.
I:17943;2592;get this great Batman sequel.
I:17943;2593;There are great performances, notably the sadly late Heath Ledger's performance as the joker.
I:17943;2594;It is extremely memorable, and lives up to its hype.
I:17943;2595;He really steals the film, and it's sad to watch because he died of a stupid drug overdose, and this is his last major work.
I:17943;2596;Oldman is quite subdued (and excellent) as the commissioner, Bale is good as Batman, Eckhart is good as Two.
I:17943;2597;face/the DA, Michael Caine brings dignity to the role of Alfred, and Maggie Glynenthal is good as well.
I:17943;2598;It's probably best not to think about it all.
I:17943;2599;So, overall, it's worth seeing, but it's a very mixed bag.
I:17943;2600;It doesn't live up to its hype, but it's still worth checking out, especially for Ledger's excellent performance.
I:17943;2601;I know, it sounds crazy, but that's the feeling I got many times while watching this movie.
I:17943;2602;"the movie is astounding
I:17943;2603;ledger's performance is also astounding, as are most of the cast.
I:17943;2604;these are my impressions, and I'm sure more thoughts are percolating about this complex movie right now.
I:17943;2605;But it's another amazing achievement that these messages slipped right past the usual suspects .
I:17943;2606;See his interview at Uncommon Knowledge.
I:17943;2607;There seems to me no question, wrote novelist and screenwriter Andrew Klavan this past summer,that the Batman film 'The Dark Knight'.
I:17943;2608;Heath ledger is phenomenal in his performance as the joker!
I:17943;2609;Christopher Nolan has re created the Batman franchise into something batman fans can be proud of.
I:17943;2610;I was thrilled with the first movie and this one was even better.
I:17943;2611;I would have given this 1 star but I appreciate the production values, so it gets a big 2.
I:17943;2612;Now that I've seen the film three more times, and in the context of Christopher Nolan's entire trilogy, I can appreciate it much more.
I:17943;2613;I understand that's the way of the media right now.
I:17943;2614;a great movie in fact, but it does leaves something to be desired.
I:17943;2615;This is much less a Batman film and more of a crime drama with my favorite comic book characters in the background.
I:17943;2616;(I do love Jack's acting).
I:17943;2617;"Has anyone noticed that the ""Batman"" movies are a perfect mirror of the social mood at their release dates?"
I:17943;2618;If you watch them, in sequence, you will get a clear picture of the changing social climate of mainstream America over the last few years.
I:17943;2619;This last offering is brilliantly directed, of course, no question.
I:17943;2620;consuming and overpowering (in true tradition of the comic book genre).
I:17943;2621;"The outstanding acting was a very pleasant surprise, the best to date so far in the ""Batman"" series."
I:17943;2622;This movie HAS to be viewed two or three times to truly appreciate how good it really is.
I:17943;2623;"developed and impressively acted by Ledger, he just wasn't the ""Joker."""
I:17943;2624;Nitpicking aside, he was a perfect fit for the script, and it all works.
I:17943;2625;hero don't seams such a great thing, the movie itself totally surprises you in a great way.
I:17943;2626;IMHO this is the best one of the last 3 Batmans, those who disagree typically don't want as much plot, and prefer a bit more action.
I:17943;2627;Also bought this as a gift.
I:17943;2628;Another instant classic for Christian Bale and company.
I:17943;2629;Really great direction for DC to go in.
I:17943;2630;If there was ever a movie that could singlehandedly demonstrate the incredible qualities of Blu.
I:17943;2631;this is an eerie sensation in a film noir.
I:17943;2632;ish fantasy like The Dark Night because it is grounded in a gritty reality while at the same time exploits state of the art special effects.
I:17943;2633;as to the film itself, it goes without saying that it is the best of the superhero genre flicks.
I:17943;2634;Much has been made about Heath Ledger, and much should be made.
I:17943;2635;There is a tendency to lionize dead actors in their postmortem releases, but Ledger's twisted humanity is a real tour de' force.
I:17943;2636;The Dark Knight is by far the best movie I have seen this year.
I:17943;2637;It stole the #2 spot away from Star Wars on the highest grossing film list recently.
I:17943;2638;By the way I think he does deserve an Oscar for his Joker because he was that good.
I:17943;2639;There were a lot of amazing moments in this movie and a lot of surprising moments too.
I:17943;2640;Not the best but some Batman fans will be appeased by them.
I:17943;2641;in closing I hope that if Christopher Nolan does make another Batman, I hope that it's as good as his two previous films.
I:17943;2642;This movie is by far the best superhero movie ever made!
I:17943;2643;This is the greatest movie of all time.
I:17943;2644;Everything about it is perfect.
I:17943;2645;Heath Ledger's Joker was the most rememberable performance of All Time.
I:17943;2646;Christian Bale is the greatest Batman of All Time.
I:17943;2647;Christopher Nolan is the greatest director of the Modern Era.
I:17943;2648;The Dark Knight Trilogy is the greatest story for a series of All Time for any series, film, tv, game, book, etc.
I:17943;2649;I love this movie, this series, and Batman.
I:17943;2650;"The highly anticipated and enormously successful sequel to the 2004 blockbuster ""Batman Begins"" is very well."
I:17943;2651;made and deserved the Academy Awards it got.
I:17943;2652;The movie has so many twists and turns that it will make your head spin.
I:17943;2653;The cast was terrific, especially Heath Ledger as The Joker.
I:17943;2654;The opening sequence is the perfect way to show off your rig to somebody unacquainted with blu.
I:17943;2655;as for the movie itself, it's about as good as action films are going to get.
I:17943;2656;Great price compared to going to the store unless you found some great sale.
I:17943;2657;This may be my personal feelings, but I always think one really good villian is plenty.
I:17943;2658;I'm stealing this idea from the great Animated series that developed Harvey and then turned him into 2.
I:17943;2659;The Joker is such a strong Character (along w/ Heath Ledger's fantastic Oscar winning performance) we don't need another villian to upstage the Hero.
I:17943;2660;face and not quite enough Batman, but just the right amount of Joker.
I:17943;2661;Starting off, this is an amazing movie in it's own rights.
I:17943;2662;thriller that comes along once in a while.
I:17943;2663;Deppressing grittiness and bleakness plague this film, and it works but sometimes the grittiness is overdone and comes out looking rather too depressing, but this is a really well done film with spot.
I:17943;2664;christian Bale was very good as Batman, but nowhere as badass or suave as Michael Keaton but he does the best with what he's given.
I:17943;2665;ray, amazing movie in its own rights, so.
I:17943;2666;This movie is destined to bring shame to everyone who praises it, even to themselves.
I:17943;2667;Awesome performance by Heath Ledger!
I:17943;2668;Great movie with twists and turns.
I:17943;2669;It's unworthy of the Batman legacy.
I:17943;2670;And it is unworthy to be counted among the best superhero movies.
I:17943;2671;It is an absolute artistic marvel for me anyway!
I:17943;2672;This is the ideal films for people who love blockbusters, super hero films and strong villains.
I:17943;2673;To me, Nolan's masterpiece was The Prestige.
I:17943;2674;set in Gotham (and for a short time in Hong Kong), Christian Bale shines with all the coolness and dark issues of Bruce Wane and Batman.
I:17943;2675;All the actors are great, including Heath Ledger who's performance is definitely worth the Academy Award.
I:17943;2676;perfect superhero film but it also happens to be one of the best crime dramas I've ever seen.
I:17943;2677;Irregardless, it's already a modern classic.
I:17943;2678;the Batman has at last established himself as Gotham City's dark protector.
I:17943;2679;"bruce's lifelong friend and former flame Rachel Dawes remains the Batman's incremental personal ray of hope
I:17943;2680;But Rachel has moved on and is seeing Gotham's golden boy, Harvey Dent.
I:17943;2681;Very crucial to the plot is the charismatic Dent, and his operatic fall from grace.
I:17943;2682;Maggie Gyllenhaal, replacing Katie Holmes, and Aaron Echkart are good, in a cast of luminaries.
I:17943;2683;out moments, delivering its share of charged action sequences and Easter eggs for those comic book fans who know what to look for (one thug's attempt to take off Batman's mask, for example, is right out of the Hush story arc).
I:17943;2684;But its flawless craftsmanship renders it the most grown up superhero movie yet.
I:17943;2685;The complex screenplay, deftly written by Director Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan, touches on very dark themes and calls into question what it means to be Gotham's guardian.
I:17943;2686;If you take out all the hubbub surrounding Heath Ledger's passing, what's left is still one of the most glittering performances ever accomplished by a film actor.
I:17943;2687;"Alfred, in a conversation with Bruce Wayne, perhaps best sums up the Joker's defining characteristic: ""Some men aren't looking for anything logical."
I:17943;2688;this is the best interpretation of the Joker yet.
I:17943;2689;Gary Oldman is superb, and I'm so glad that, this time, Jim Gordon isn't relegated to afterthought status, and Michael Caine and my dude Morgan Freeman are, as ever, class acts.
I:17943;2690;It's fascinating how he constructs twisted scenarios and pits his victims against impossible choices.
I:17943;2691;The Joker is unpredictable and unreadable.
I:17943;2692;Did that make sense?THE DARK KNIGHT is endowed with great one.
I:17943;2693;liners (mostly from the Joker) and several perfect scenes, from the bank heist sequence at the start of the film to the Joker's crazy whimsical exit from the hospital to the Joker's verbal manifesto delivered whilst hanging upside down.
I:17943;2694;The pencil vanishing trick is terrific, not only for its shock value but for the charge it sends up the audience's spine.
I:17943;2695;perfect because there are some things which bugged me.
I:17943;2696;The Joker is truly diabolical this time out, so diabolical that the Batman is reduced mostly to re.
I:17943;2697;Disc 1 has the featured presentation.
I:17943;2698;6 cleverly done (and fake) television broadcasts from Gotham Cable's Premier News Program, nicely hosted by Anthony Michael Hall and real.
I:17943;2699;"depth looks at and interviews with several of the main characters, as well as fleshing out the storyline even more (I got a bit of a chuckle at Jim Gordon's explanation for the Bat beacon, when asked by the press)
I:17943;2700;mAN 2, SUPERMAN II and IRON MAN, which are sunny celebrations of the superhero mythos.
I:17943;2701;THE DARK KNIGHT provokes, in its bleakness and ambiguity and stark exploration of madness and motivation and the meaning of heroism.
I:17943;2702;even as I'm compelled to see it for a fourth time.
I:17943;2703;I was appalled to see all the children in the theater.
I:17943;2704;The first Batman remains the best.
I:17943;2705;Of course I have great respect for Chris Nolan, but this movie sucks.
I:17943;2706;I never was a Heath Ledger fan, but his is a good performance and thus a silver lining in this cloud of a film.
I:17943;2707;Honestly people, this is the greatest superhero movie ever made.
I:17943;2708;This is definitely one of the more dark and twisted Batman films ever made.
I:17943;2709;"He is convincing in his role which makes up for the silly voice that is used when Christian Bale is ""Batman""."
I:17943;2710;Otherwise this is an amazing movie and it's worth sitting and watching for the 2 hours.
I:17943;2711;I wish the special edition had more special features (maybe a behind.
I:17943;2712;scenes interview) but the stuff on the sound effects and other special effects was entertaining.
I:17943;2713;Otherwise, the single disc is fine.
I:17943;2714;Best movie in the trilogy in my opinion maybe its because Heith Ledger was starred in as his last movie but boy was is it amazing.
I:17943;2715;The Dark Knight is an excellence movie.
I:17943;2716;Especially enjoyed Heath Ledger, he was an amazing actor.
I:17943;2717;Would highly recommend this movie to anyone.
I:17943;2718;if you like good movies.you must to see it, have it and love it.
I:17943;2719;Good mix of action with a plot.
I:17943;2720;The movie is a masterpiece!
I:17943;2721;Black Friday made it the best deal ever!
I:17943;2722;I ordered this as a gift for my husband.
I:17943;2723;It was exactly what I ordered and was the perfect gift.
I:17943;2724;I bought this movie for my 17 year old son for Christmas.
I:17943;2725;My husband and I had already seen it, and had enjoyed it.
I:17943;2726;This is the kind of movie that will please both comic book nerds like myself as well as anyone who appreciates good storytelling.
I:17943;2727;We love the Bat Man, and will probably watch it again.
I:17943;2728;Still a must have for every Batman fan.
I:17943;2729;This film, directed by Christopher Nolan (Batman Begins, Memento) is a full.
I:17943;2730;drama epic in the tradition of Heat.
I:17943;2731;Several solid actors provide terrific support, including Anthony Michael Hall (Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club, TV's The Dead Zone) as a sleazy tabloid reporter and Eric Roberts as crime boss Sal Maroni.
I:17943;2732;There is even a humorous moment in the film involving a cryptozoological piece of footage.
I:17943;2733;This is one of the top films of the decade, certainly the film of the year.
I:17943;2734;"But I think ""The Dark Knight"" struck a chord in me."
I:17943;2735;The Dark Knight keeps you at the edge of your seat when you watch it for the first time.
I:17943;2736;There are so many surprises as the story rapidly changes scene to scene that you want to stay focused on the screen.
I:17943;2737;something that'll happen when you watch many of Christopher Nolan's other movies as well.2.
I:17943;2738;It intensified the already suspenseful scenes, and it really helped you get into the movie if you already weren't.
I:17943;2739;Listening to the soundtrack afterwards makes me nostalgic for the scenes.
I:17943;2740;It is even better on blu.
I:17943;2741;This is a great little set with a bunch of bonus features!
I:17943;2742;The mask extra was really a plus and a great collector's item!
I:17943;2743;ray w/mask and extras and a great price!
I:17943;2744;This will make a great gift for any batman fan!
I:17943;2745;give this movie a well.
I:17943;2746;rounded cast and possibly the best Batman movie cast ever.
I:17943;2747;"If you haven't seen it, please watch ""Batman Begins"" first."
I:17943;2748;You'll understand where Batman got his beginnings and get to see the Scarecrow in action.
I:17943;2749;the video is clear and crisp and one of the best on Blu.
I:17943;2750;it's a True Fullscreen 16:9 (which is always a good thing).
I:17943;2751;"the Extras are Great detailing the ""hows"" of the special effects (especially when most of them are not CG) ."
I:17943;2752;This is a fantastic movie from almost every perspective.
I:17943;2753;Christian Bale is an excellent Batman, but the real fun comes from Ledger's brilliant interpretation of the psychotic Joker.
I:17943;2754;ray edition is worth ever penny.
I:17943;2755;Because it may be the beginning of something wonderful.
I:17943;2756;As the movie progress there's more and more action.
I:17943;2757;Batman and Joker puts each other to the ultimate test.
I:17943;2758;This was a great movie that I enjoyed a lot.
I:17943;2759;I usually don't enjoy dark movies, but I really enjoyed this movie.
I:17943;2760;The action and character development in this movie is touch notch and one that shouldn't be missed.
I:17943;2761;i love a lot of violent spectacles and movies that dish up their share of sexism etc., but this one was no fun .
I:17943;2762;It was well done, and there are some great scenes, but it is LONG and does drag, especially after seeing it more than once.
I:17943;2763;It's a very good movie, but NOT a perfect movie.
I:17943;2764;It is brimming with pseudo.
I:17943;2765;Where is the chemistry between Kim Basinger and Michael Keaton, the authenticity of Alfred?Where, I ask you, is Jack Nicholson's perfect gravitas and Joker's playful script conceived and executed with such agile perfection?
I:17943;2766;nice price ant wonderful product.
I:17943;2767;outstanding performance as The Joker.
I:17943;2768;for years I thought that Jack Nicholson's fifteen minute role in Batman was one of the best pieces of acting I'd ever seen.
I:17943;2769;This is an awesome movie and I am so glad that I own it.
I:17943;2770;I will be sure to tell all my friends about this great deal!
I:17943;2771;As a man of intellect who greatly values logic and reason , I enjoy complex films like Mulholland drive that foster long conversations after viewing.
I:17943;2772;you guessed it, a simple cell phone.
I:17943;2773;batman's capture of the Asian money launderer is entirely over the top.
I:17943;2774;the acting in this film is great, and the Imax shots are amazing, and the prologue is perfect, but these are the only good things about the film.
I:17943;2775;"Should ""The Dark Knight"" have been nominated for best picture?"
I:17943;2776;But it was worthy of a nomination.
I:17943;2777;this movie was full of effective plot twists.
I:17943;2778;There have been other comic book movies that succeeded at being thoughtful (such as the X. men series, especially X.3), but this sets the bar.
I:17943;2779;Is it the icon of intelligent summer movie perfect that the fanboys proclaim it to be?
I:17943;2780;eyed and Bruce Wayne competing for her affections.
I:17943;2781;Not much of the dialogue is memorable.
I:17943;2782;Little of it feels like a realistic conversation.
I:17943;2783;When you watch the movie closely you'll notice you never actually see anything.
I:17943;2784;I understand the need to keep it a PG.13 but come on!
I:17943;2785;there are entertaining and breathtaking spectacles within The Dark Knight, but take away Bruce Wayne and the Joker and you're left with nothing at all that could identify this story or setting as something that truly belongs in the Batman universe.
I:17943;2786;I first saw this movie in an IMax theatre and it was incredible.
I:17943;2787;I actually enjoyed The Joker better than Batman in this movie.
I:17943;2788;Underpinning this film is the ever.
I:17943;2789;present truth that Batman is not seen as a hero by the denizens of Gotham City but rather as an out of control vigilante who thinks he is above the law.
I:17943;2790;There are also good supporting performances from Maggie Gyllenhaal as Gotham City's assistant District Attorney Rachel Dawes (played by Katie Holmes in the first film) who is in love with both Bruce Wayne and D. a. Harvey Dent, Morgan Freeman as CEO of Wayne Enterprises Lucius Fox and Michael Caine as Bruce Wayne's butler Alfred Pennyworth.
I:17943;2791;The film expertly contrasts the madness of The Joker with the grim righteousness of our misunderstood anti.
I:17943;2792;All in all this film is an exceptional vision that has a few, minor flaws, but these do not detract from the fact that this is film.
I:17943;2793;making of the highest order.
I:17943;2794;This is a great sequel from Batman Begins where Batman continues his crusade against crime on his own hometown Gotham.
I:17943;2795;Also a great movie to reminisce about Heath Ledger (may his soul rest in peace).
I:17943;2796;He did an awesome job playing the Joker, better than Jack Nicholson.
I:17943;2797;This is easily one of the best if not the best movie ever made.
I:17943;2798;Heath Ledger, gone too soon, what a performance, once in a lifetime, set the bar, Bale brings it yet again, more insight to Batman psyche, still unclear as to his development and ulitmately revelling in the persona.
I:17943;2799;This is not just a great batman movie but a great movie in general.
I:17943;2800;The story had drama and the characters were well realized.
I:17943;2801;I really like the series of movies.
I:17943;2802;I really like many of the actors.
I:17943;2803;One of the best villain roles ever portrayed.
I:17943;2804;The Dark Knight is a very good action movie with an great acting job by all the actors lead and support, but mind blowing scenes were all the stunts and things being blown up.
I:17943;2805;One scene actually got me to jump on it and takes lot for me to jump when comes to loudness of a movie or suspense triller so forth.
I:17943;2806;But almost everyone I do believe has seen this movie and if you have yet to watch it you really owe it to yourself to watch this movie least once during your lifetime if you enjoy your action movies.
I:17943;2807;I am not much for super hero movies but this one is one of my favorite's because it has a great plotline and doesn't just focus on Batman the director gives film time to mutiple other characters to add to the storyline.
I:17943;2808;I have yet to watch The Dark Knight Rises but I will soon enough, then review that one also.
I:17943;2809;This shines through the entire two and half hour film.
I:17943;2810;The Dark Knight is just another mob movie, but with Batman characters in it.
I:17943;2811;Gadgets, actual Batman vehicle, and the cave is omitted.
I:17943;2812;His performance in this movie is truly disturbing.
I:17943;2813;it is also a great action film.
I:17943;2814;Much of the fighting is bone.
I:17943;2815;hand combat, perfectly in keeping with the tone of the film.
I:17943;2816;"one of the greatest things about ""Dark Knight"", though, is that, despite its ""darkness"", it resists the easy path of being merely a nihilistic freak show."
I:17943;2817;It pays tribute to heroism and asserts a core goodness within humanity that makes this film, ultimately, uplifting.
I:17943;2818;"I believe that, in the ""Dark Knight"", Batman is finally portrayed as a TRUE hero, dropping, finally, the ""anti."""
I:17943;2819;This is really what the film is all about, I think.
I:17943;2820;This movie belongs to Heath Ledger!
I:17943;2821;The dark intricate story unfolds around a villain that is creepy beyond creepy!
I:17943;2822;Everyone else is simply there to support his incredible performance.
I:17943;2823;Finally the new generation of Batman films has arrived and he is on the run.
I:17943;2824;The film becomes a lot more psychological, mental even.
I:17943;2825;And there the answer is super.
I:17943;2826;That's politics and that's well seen.
I:17943;2827;You will have to explain why at a certain moment that man captured a vast majority of the people in elections or just public opinion.
I:17943;2828;His mind got corrupted and he provoked the big northern neighbor and he got what he deserved: his two military bases destroyed, the main airport destroyed, the main harbor destroyed, the basic infrastructures disrupted, the pipelines stopped.
I:17943;2829;But the film is superb, especially because the Joker is really vicious and dangerous, really blood curdling and sickening, whereas with Jack Nicholson he was a funny clown.
I:17943;2830;And it has means to get under the skin of most people.
I:17943;2831;many reviewers have said this movie is the greatest movie of all time.
I:17943;2832;many reviewers have said Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker is the greatest performance of all time.
I:17943;2833;this movie, however, is a very good and intelligent comic book film.
I:17943;2834;And that is more than what you can say about most films.
I:17943;2835;As a martial arts practitioner, I felt many of the previous Batman movies, such as the Batman Begins, had far better fighting sequences and more elaborate choreography.
I:17943;2836;this movie deserves its all time best ranking as a superhero film along with the Superman (1977) and Spiderman 2 (2004).
I:17943;2837;He was a great actor, and he took the role of the Joker to a whole other level.
I:17943;2838;His performance is really what made this movie fantastic.
I:17943;2839;ray player, and for anyone that loves Batman
I:17943;2840;I recommend it to anyone that hasn't seen it.
I:17943;2841;In this latest installment of the Batman series, The Dark Knight delivers a great movie that can be watched over and over again.
I:17943;2842;The extras aren't perfect, as a feature on the transformation of the joker would be nice, it still delivers.
I:17943;2843;The story takes the characters in directions that show an extraordinary level of directorial skill that frankly makes Tim Burton's previous films almost amateur by comparison.
I:17943;2844;The opening sequence is one of the most engaging first 10 minutes of a movie I think I've ever seen, quickly establishing The Joker as a formidable villain.
I:17943;2845;The rest of film is both equally complex and completely gripping as the stakes are continuously raised.
I:17943;2846;the most amazing part of the movie is Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker.
I:17943;2847;There are genuinely points in the film where his goals are so far ahead of the good guys that he seems completely invincible.
I:17943;2848;truly the hallmark of an extraordinary actor.
I:17943;2849;the Dark Knight is as complicated, entertaining, thought.
I:17943;2850;Once a decade, a director produces a film that transcends the limits of the screen and creates something truly iconic.
I:17943;2851;It's a testament to Nolan's skill that he can add such depth to the material and deliver something so finely balanced that it's impossible to think of how it could be better.
I:17943;2852;This installment of the series digs ever deeper into the demons haunting Bruce Wayne.
I:17943;2853;Christian Bale and the full cast was good.
I:17943;2854;This is the best movie of 2008 and the best adaptation of a comic or graphic novel ever.
I:17943;2855;The action and drama start right away and they never end.
I:17943;2856;The imagery and cinematography was exceptional, especially considering that this superhero, is mortal and there was little help from CGI.
I:17943;2857;for the fans of Batman this movie will not only hold it's own but it will engage you and hold you right to the end.
I:17943;2858;I really does honor and improve upon anything Frank Miller intended for the Dark Knight.
I:17943;2859;believers the entire movie captivated them.
I:17943;2860;this is a great movie for anyone who even remotely likes action, drama, psychological thrillers or even horror.
I:17943;2861;This movie is the best in series.
I:17943;2862;I have seen each one and this one by far impressed me the most.
I:17943;2863;My ultimate hero movie is still the Spiderman trilogy, where you can savour clearly the action sequence that is really a mastery of action hero movies at its finest.
I:17943;2864;wrenching cruelty without offering a single ray of hope.
I:17943;2865;Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker is superb .
I:17943;2866;but it is easy to see how it could leave a person deeply disturbed.
I:17943;2867;If for no other reason, see it for the performance by Heath Ledger.
I:17943;2868;But the entire movie is really fantastic.
I:17943;2869;A great comic book movie!
I:17943;2870;I thought that it almost crossed the PG.13 line into R territory.
I:17943;2871;Some excellent performances from Bale, Freeman and, of course, Ledger, along with an action.
I:17943;2872;Something for most everyone .
I:17943;2873;humor, drama, comic book heroes and villains.
I:17943;2874;Possibly the best of the Batman stories to date.
I:17943;2875;And, have I mentioned, the awesome turn of The Joker from a gifted actor.
I:17943;2876;One of the best Batman movies ever made!
I:17943;2877;Greatest depiction of the Joker ever, and and Christian Bale plays Batman superbly.
I:17943;2878;I was truly impressed, most follow ups just don't make it but I guess there is always an exciting story line with Star Trek.
I:17943;2879;I received this product on Friday 2/7/14 and I've already viewed it twice already.
I:17943;2880;take a chance as the price is always right at Amazon.
I:17943;2881;The best cinematic adaptation of a comic book story.
I:17943;2882;It is also one of the best sequels ever made, right up there with THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK.
I:17943;2883;Filmed partly in 70mm Imax and 35mm, this is a tour de force in crime genre filmmaking, and the best filmed superhero movie ever.
I:17943;2884;The 35 scenes don't look as good as the 70 scenes, but it's a surprisingly subtle shift.
I:17943;2885;Altogether the filming is comparable to Kubrick's photographic innovations.
I:17943;2886;Fully utilizes the capabilities of Blu.
I:17943;2887;ray in transferring what is likely the greatest technical achievement in filmmaking in recent years.
I:17943;2888;The fact that the score is by TWO of the best film soundtrack composers working today seems under.
I:17943;2889;There is plenty of LFE and while the soundstage could have used some more kick and surround in some parts, it was overall very good.
I:17943;2890;"The ""focus point"" shorts on disc one are the best extras, demonstrating how some of the incredible pieces of this film came together."
I:17943;2891;It's a fun movie to watch.
I:17943;2892;this is a definate See It!
I:17943;2893;Borrowed another from a neighbor to be able to finish watching it.
I:17943;2894;although annoying, AMAZON made good and shipped me a new one right away.
I:17943;2895;Come on people really look at the movie!!!
I:17943;2896;The movie came in plastic wrap and was in perfect condition.
I:17943;2897;The product shipped very quickly and I was very pleased with the price.
I:17943;2898;a good movie for the family its very good
I:17943;2899;We truly lost a wonderful actor.
I:17943;2900;I truly hope that this Batman series can continue to show creativity as it did in this showing.
I:17943;2901;Who can watch something that keeps reloading.
I:17943;2902;this is great entertainment, with a good story line, and enough of the unbelievable to not take itself to seriously.
I:17943;2903;"Everyone from the excellant first movie ""Batman Begins"" (sans one) returns and continue to be wonderful in their parts."
I:17943;2904;The new faces are equally impressive.
I:17943;2905;Maggie Gyllenhaal (replacement for that ghastly Katie Holmes) does a far better job in the part and Aaron Eckhart is fantastic as Harvey Dent/Two Face.
I:17943;2906;It became her favorite Christmas gift.
I:17943;2907;The Dark Knight joins a group of guy films .
I:17943;2908;They are the modern day equivalent of epic poems and campfire tales, illustrating the moral dilemmas of fighting evil with evil and contemplating whether the world still needs heroes at all.
I:17943;2909;The newest installment of the Batman franchise makes good its promises of 'darkness'.
I:17943;2910;Though I didn't find the imagery of this movie as drab overall as say in the first movie, the story line certainly does set the mood.
I:17943;2911;once again, outstanding performance by the leads in this movie.
I:17943;2912;and, yes, Heath Ledger was eerily fantastic.
I:17943;2913;star elements of the movie):Pros:1) Christian Bale.
I:17943;2914;Great actor and easy on the eyes.2) Cool gadgets.3) Crazy stunts.4) Gross but cool magic scene involving pencil.
I:17943;2915;face (thought it was a set up for the next movie.
I:17943;2916;His character demonstrates it just fine.
I:17943;2917;overall an entertaining flick, but doesn't hold up to its predecessor which, IMHO, is hands down the best of all the Batman films thus far.
I:17943;2918;I realise any film that's hyped this much is going to disappoint, but even movie critics were calling 'The Dark Knight' one of the best films ever made.
I:17943;2919;On second viewing I will say his performance is even more impressive.
I:17943;2920;It's still amazing catching all his little gestures quirks that shows really how talented Heath Ledger was.
I:17943;2921;In fact the acting (and casting) in this film is quite good.
I:17943;2922;Gary Oldman and Aaron Eckhart really bring weight to their characters and along with Ledger their performances stick with you long after the film is done.
I:17943;2923;for me the biggest draw.
I:17943;2924;back of this film was it's screenplay.
I:17943;2925;In fact it's STILL my favorite superhero movie which I can watch over and over again.
I:17943;2926;It's more thoughtful, has more class and I had a LOT more fun watching it than 'The Dark Knight'.
I:17943;2927;despite my complaints about it's story, I will say 'The Dark Knight' has some well.
I:17943;2928;The scenes look amazing on digital transfer.
I:17943;2929;goer and comic book fan I found 'The Dark Knight' unworthy of it's praise.
I:17943;2930;Thankfully Nolan did much better with 'The Dark Knight Rises'.
I:17943;2931;again, bought for a friend on her b day , i managed to score this limited edition packaging for her, she loves anything batman, i figured the joker cover was a nice touch :)highly recommended
I:17943;2932;Batman has always been my favorite of the comic book heroes.
I:17943;2933;Unlike the most Batman is human, he has no super powers unless you count his amazing self control and brilliance.
I:17943;2934;the Dark Knight takes everything up a notch, creating a brutal world, in a very realistic city.
I:17943;2935;From the opening scene this movie picks you up and won't let you down until the credits start to roll, you'll find yourself on the edge of your seat from start to finish.
I:17943;2936;(The hype is underplayed, Heath Ledger is beyond amazing as he literally disappears into the role of a lifetime.
I:17943;2937;"Here we watch an amazingly choreographed bank robbery as The Joker's ""allies"" drop like flies."
I:17943;2938;"We also hear him utter one of the greatest lines of the whole Batman series: ""I believe in one thing: what doesn't kill you, makes you stranger."""
I:17943;2939;This opening scene not only sets the tone for the rest of the movie, but is also one of the most amazing opening scenes of any action/drama movie ever.
I:17943;2940;Harvey Dent is a pure man in a dirty world (once again played excellently by the always welcome Aaron Eckhart) and could also be Bruce Wayne's chance to put down the cape and cowl once and for all.
I:17943;2941;I thought Christian Bale was good in Batman Begins, here he exceeds all expectation.
I:17943;2942;It's one of the most entertaining movies in the multiplex right now, and I would recommend you see it in the theater, some things will lose their visual luster on the small screen (a night time fly around the skyscrapers of Hong Kong comes to mind).
I:17943;2943;Still in the top 3 superhero movies with Batman Begins and Spider.
I:17943;2944;Arrived on time and in perfect condition, even though it was used.
I:17943;2945;The dark knight is the best superhero movie I've seen, and one of the best movies overall (in my opinion).
I:17943;2946;Acting is great, the musical score is amazing, and overtone of darkness and desperation doesn't overshadow the hope even in the final scenes.
I:17943;2947;I would recommend this to movie fanatics ,fans of batman, and anyone looking to see a good movie.
I:17943;2948;order this movie plus it was a good price for blu.
I:17943;2949;& Special Bonus features are up to the mark in keepin with the special edition tag.
I:17943;2950;definitely A good collector's Item.
I:17943;2951;The story and acting are solid, and the sound track is amazing even with only the my plasma screen speakers.
I:17943;2952;This BD film should bring in record sales.
I:17943;2953;The Dark Knight is extremely entertaining . . . for adults.
I:17943;2954;There are intense scenes involving the taking of hostages, and their subsequent tortures and deaths.
I:17943;2955;Major characters betray, deceive, and seek bloody vengeance.
I:17943;2956;They had a gothic feel and appearance that distinguished the mythical Gotham City from New York, Las Angeles, and other big cities of the real world.
I:17943;2957;"The Dark Knight reminded me of action movies such as the ones found in the ""Die Hard"" series."
I:17943;2958;"If you enjoy violent action thrillers, then you must see The Dark Knight."""
I:17943;2959;The Joker is a diabolical street thug with a witty, dark sense of humor.
I:17943;2960;We never learn his true identity, which adds a delightful sense of mystery to the film.
I:17943;2961;Its dark, visual, menacing, action packed, colorful,and keeps the roller.
I:17943;2962;there wasn't a bad performance in this movie, Christian Bale does anexcellent job as Batman but I give the director 5 stars also for puttingthis all together and giving us such great action and bringing thiscomic book to life.
I:17943;2963;I personally loved the fact that Batman was in a believable modern world that made it somewhat grounded in reality.
I:17943;2964;A great depature from the Pre.
I:17943;2965;"The Dark Knight proves that a comic book movie can be more then ""JUST a comic book movie""."
I:17943;2966;dimnsional characters, compelling storyline, and amazing action sequences.
I:17943;2967;"Where this film really seprates itself from the past Batman movies is its believability and ""real worldness""."
I:17943;2968;ego Batman, the Joker truly steals the show here.
I:17943;2969;It works by giving equal focus to each one of the films main cast.
I:17943;2970;In addition the action sequences will leave you on the edge of your seat and your pulse pounding.
I:17943;2971;It should be said, first and foremost, that this movie is brilliant.
I:17943;2972;He's proven its possible to take them and make them accessible to people without being campy, to include real emotions, even drama, believable and entertaining action sequences, all in a story that is handled seriously.
I:17943;2973;That said, all the performances in this movie are anywhere between great and brilliant, no complaints.
I:17943;2974;This is actually a simplified explanation of what actually happens, because there are actually 3 or 4 more switches back and forth in that one action sequence.
I:17943;2975;This is a fantastic movie.
I:17943;2976;It just may be my favorite movie of all time.
I:17943;2977;I'll start with the plot: it's complex, it's concise and it's amazing.
I:17943;2978;The fact that the main protagonist wears a bat costume is what reminds you that you're watching a Batman movie.
I:17943;2979;the acting here is terrific.
I:17943;2980;And Christian Bale himself, one of my favorite actors, didn't really get a whole lot of screen time as Bruce Wayne, but that's due to the fact that the movie is packed with characters.
I:17943;2981;now enter the Joker: the film's dark and wonderfully twisted centerpiece.
I:17943;2982;I applaud Nolan, Ledger and whoever else was a creative force behind this character.
I:17943;2983;The Joker is the best movie character I have ever seen and I am not exaggerating that point.
I:17943;2984;the way The Joker character is written into the movie is also genius.
I:17943;2985;I love the fact that at the very beginning of the movie, The Joker is considered small time and unimportant and the main story focuses on the mob.
I:17943;2986;One scene at a time, he changes everything, working each side to his own whim.
I:17943;2987;as if I haven't raved about The Joker enough, the best part about his character are his bizarre ticks and his incredible dialogue.
I:17943;2988;To me, this is kind of dissapointing, but at least we still got to see him.
I:17943;2989;So watch The Dark Knight for the story, watch it for The Joker, or just watch it because you like Batman, but watch and enjoy this movie.
I:17943;2990;now this is a movie, great acting, effects, actors, villans, the works.
I:17943;2991;it was like seeing movies like sixth sense for the first time, with regards to such a outstanding movie that came out of nowehere.
I:17943;2992;i know it will be sold out everywhere.
I:17943;2993;But let me start off by saying that The Dark Knight was a cinematic adventure.
I:17943;2994;"and he did a phenomenal job
I:17943;2995;The Dark Knight had a great script, a great cast, AWE.
I:17943;2996;"iNSPIRING CINEMATOGRAPHY, a great score
I:17943;2997;(This is the director of Memento, must I remind you.)
I:17943;2998;It's as simple as that.
I:17943;2999;Check the IMDB top 250.
I:17943;3000;Thousands and thousands of voters must share a common feelings, that TDK is a pretty fricken awesome film.
I:17943;3001;ray has more features than The Dark Knight Blu.
I:17943;3002;All that matters is that you can watch one of the greatest, most thought.
I:17943;3003;provoking, most entertaining films ever.
I:17943;3004;Easily will be best Batman movie in years to come!
I:17943;3005;Heath Ledger didn't deserve an Oscar for this role, he obviously won it via the sympathy vote.
I:17943;3006;"Iron Man and ""Watchmen"" are both far superior movies AND are much more entertaining."
I:17943;3007;This is easily the best Batman film out and Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker is so good it's scary.
I:17943;3008;"the reason why ""The Dark Knight"" DESERVES its hype (as very, VERY few films do) is that it manages to be both an original interpretation AND faithful to its source."
I:17943;3009;It's suitably dark, but still fun to watch in most places.
I:17943;3010;I've done my homework on this .
I:17943;3011;Heath Ledger's Joker is incredible, yet controversial.
I:17943;3012;Frankly, I doubt it, especially since he claimed to have had the most fun of his life in the role and his seperation from girlfriend and daughter seems a more realistic catalyst for depression.
I:17943;3013;"Bruce Wayne / Batman has evolved from someone on a finite mission to clean up his city to someone recognizing that the city could be getting too much of a good thing, and that ""good thing"" is Batman."
I:17943;3014;This is as close to perfect as movies can get.
I:17943;3015;To add more salt on the wound they include they new thing that several studios think is somehow a brilliant idea, a Digital Copy of the movie.
I:17943;3016;Batman Begins Special Edition box had some AMAZING special features and this.
I:17943;3017;well this is just a spit in the face.
I:17943;3018;which was fine for Batman Begins due to all the great special features, not so much here.
I:17943;3019;top performance as The Joker.
I:17943;3020;there were plenty of fireworks and thrills in the movie, and plenty of chases and explosions.
I:17943;3021;"But ""The Dark Knight"" needed to plumb the depths a little more to make it as memorable overall as Ledger."
I:17943;3022;But never has to face the existential questions faced by the rest of us .
I:17943;3023;realized movie had it tackled these question, but it was satisfying nonetheless.
I:17943;3024;Great makeup/CGI work to provide us with a believable Two.
I:17943;3025;And the film did not allow its not inconsiderable pyrotechnics and special effects get in the way of the story.
I:17943;3026;The action will keep you on the edge of your seat, no doubt preparing you for the last of this trilogy.
I:17943;3027;The Dark Knight might be the best Batman film ever made and 2008 movie of the year.
I:17943;3028;A marvelous movie, and in addition, my class viewed the movie in conjunction with our world literature course called Human Beings: Heroes or Beasts.
I:17943;3029;Great story and solid action throughout, only movie I ever have and will pay full retail price for.
I:17943;3030;Okay, other than being one of the last remaining members of the human race to finally see this unbelievably fantastic movie, against ALL odd's it actually lived up to the incredible hype that preceeded it.
I:17943;3031;Part of that certainly may be the result of having such incredibly LOW expectations that even a half.
I:17943;3032;decent movie would have been pretty good.
I:17943;3033;I kept thinking, 'I'll go see it NEXT weekend.'
I:17943;3034;The major praise for the film coming almost exclusively on behalf of the late Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker, and hearing everyone speak of his performance in almost hushed, reverance and awe, saying stuff like Golden Globe and Oscar, made me even MORE skeptical.
I:17943;3035;droppingly good, but easily the best performance from ANY Batman film to date.
I:17943;3036;And that's saying just ONE small part of this very well.
I:17943;3037;on second thought, it DID.
I:17943;3038;And the Joker is just one tiny part of what you have to love within this fantastic film.
I:17943;3039;The story was clever and loaded with twists.
I:17943;3040;and I have never been so happy to admit it.
I:17943;3041;the Dark Knight was simply put the best film of 2008 and is hands down my favorite movie featuring a superhero, and has earned every single bit of the praise it received.
I:17943;3042;Heath Ledger did a great job portraying the Joker.
I:17943;3043;Overall it is a good movie and I would recommend it to everyone.
I:17943;3044;Yeah, OK, Ledger and Bale were both good, and I always like Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman.
I:17943;3045;mainly because he really did JOKE and laugh, whereas all Ledger does is kill people!)
I:17943;3046;chases, interspersed with numerous killings.
I:17943;3047;Director Christopher Nolan has made another Batman film for adults, and it did not disappoint.
I:17943;3048;it is a fair statement to make that Heath Ledger's performance as Batman's arch.
I:17943;3049;"He will, in time, be on every ""Greatest Movie Villain"" list, and has rendered Jack Nicholson's portrayal of the same character to be both buffoonish and irrelevant."
I:17943;3050;the story is airtight, and the acting is top.
I:17943;3051;That was a surprising faux pas, as Nolan seemed to take small details such as that into account for 'Begins'.
I:17943;3052;this is a very intense film, and certainly not meant for children.
I:17943;3053;It clocks in at about 2 1/2 hours, but they roll by quickly and in a satisfying manner.
I:17943;3054;You put a fool in the makeup of the Joker, and you have a talking Mime worth a couple of laughs.
I:17943;3055;Somehow, the Joker had become the cliche for maniacal counter heroes and with one landmark performance we have those illusions of believe shattered and now I see the light.
I:17943;3056;Nothing but the one of a kind acting by a brilliant actor.
I:17943;3057;Bale is without a doubt the best Batman.
I:17943;3058;We made a day of it and watched Batman Begins, this and then headed to the theatre for Dark Knight Rises.
I:17943;3059;The Dark Knight was a great installment in the new Batman series starring Christian Bale.
I:17943;3060;I wanted to watch the entire series on New Year's Eve 2012, so I came over to Amazon.
I:17943;3061;The Instant Video on Amazon played just fine with no glitches and is an easy way to view something quickly.
I:17943;3062;This is an excellent movie to watch.
I:17943;3063;I've loved CB since Newsies!
I:17943;3064;It's dark yet has some levity with Heath Ledger / the Joker.
I:17943;3065;This movie is loved by all in my family.
I:17943;3066;I think that this is one of the best movies I have seen in my life, period.
I:17943;3067;This movie has some of the greatest acting I've ever seen!
I:17943;3068;I bought this movie strickly for Heath!
I:17943;3069;Besides Heath Ledger, the rest of the cast were great along with this film.
I:17943;3070;"My husband didn't think so and thought it should of been called ""The Coming of the Joker"" Christian Bale has done a tremendous job as our Caped Crusader as he struggles between his 2 personalities of being a rich heir and an upholder of justice which also puts his relationship with Rachel Dawes on the rocks."
I:17943;3071;"aaron Eckhart also did an amazing job as ""white knight."""
I:17943;3072;His sense of justice was also what brought him and Rachel Dawes(Maggie Gyllenhaal) together.
I:17943;3073;Aaron Eckhart's portrayal of Harvey Dent's as he struggles with emotions, justice and insanity brought Half.
I:17943;3074;Maggie Gyllenhaal did great replacement for Katie Holmes as Wayne's love interest Rachel Dawes, as she shows more sensitive and caring side towards Bruce but chose Harvey in the end.
I:17943;3075;i feel that this film will appeal to audiences of a larger age group or those who read the comics.
I:17943;3076;this is a movie I am compelled to watch over and over, but not because it's a great movie.
I:17943;3077;Parts of it are good.
I:17943;3078;one of reasons I watch this movie over and over is Heath Ledger.
I:17943;3079;That in itself makes the movie larger than fiction.
I:17943;3080;It makes it legendary, scary, evil and thus, sadly, more attractive.
I:17943;3081;this movie is a joke in many ways, but still irresistible in ways.
I:17943;3082;but, still I'll watch this movie again and again.
I:17943;3083;in part to recognize all the issues I have with it.
I:17943;3084;The Dark Knight is a really good movie that keeps your blood pumping.
I:17943;3085;The film is muscling its way into my #1 favorite comic movie adaptation of all time.
I:17943;3086;but nonetheless, a great film .
I:17943;3087;Batman Begins was a much more compelling, well written, and far better film in my opinion.
I:17943;3088;The best movie adaptation I have ever seen.
I:17943;3089;One of my favorite movies of all time.
I:17943;3090;I would recommend this movie to anyone.
I:17943;3091;the greatest movie of all time, it the best of the best.
I:17943;3092;"will the next ""batman"" beat the box office, what do u think"
I:17943;3093;Although Bale is good again in this episode, Heath Ledger was phenomenal.
I:17943;3094;This was an amazing film when I went to see it in the theater, and I wondered what could be done to bring that feeling home.
I:17943;3095;frame IMAX scenes intact for the blu.
I:17943;3096;Keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time!
I:17943;3097;Overall the acting was still superb and I will be watching it again.
I:17943;3098;Still this filming is done in such a way you can see clearly what is occurring.
I:17943;3099;He could have and would have played the Joker much better with just his normal gorgeous face.
I:17943;3100;This is for sure how you get Batman right this movie is an all time favorite of mine.
I:17943;3101;The joker was great the best one I have ever seen.
I:17943;3102;I can re watch this movie a number of times and still enjoy it like it was my first time watching.
I:17943;3103;It's amazing what happens when you bring a practically no.
I:17943;3104;name director and allow him the ability to spend millions and millions of dollars on a franchise like Batman.
I:17943;3105;The Dark Knight, in my opinion, is completely worth the fanfare it received.
I:17943;3106;heath Ledger, Christian Bale, etc. all did a fantastic job.
I:17943;3107;The storyline is extremely well thought out, and truly expands upon Batman's growth.
I:17943;3108;What really sets it apart (and Batman Begins is the same way) is that the story is more real to life versus the previous Batman movies.
I:17943;3109;ray portion of this movie, and if it's worth it.
I:17943;3110;Similar to others, I did feel the 2.
I:17943;3111;ray really shows how amazing a movie can be.
I:17943;3112;I was very pleased with what was advertised and what I receivied.
I:17943;3113;But his performance is good.
I:17943;3114;"The action sequences and glass shattering sound will keep you entertained for many ""Knights"" to come."
I:17943;3115;The new villain of the series, The Joker, marvelously played by non.
I:17943;3116;"in ""The Dark Knight"" Batman struggles to keep his indentity among his late night ventures as Gotham City's hero."
I:17943;3117;He faces his toughest battle yet against a nearly psychotic menace who plots to tear down the city and reveal the true identity of Batman in the process.
I:17943;3118;The movie would rate 5 stars no sweat and Heath Ledger's Joker easily finds a spot in my top 5 movie villians.
I:17943;3119;On one hand it's the easiest thing to make a comic book movie .
I:17943;3120;On the other hand it's the hardest thing to make a comic book movie .
I:17943;3121;Batman's a psychopath with a conscience .
I:17943;3122;strangely enough Mr. Nolan chooses to ask these questions by showing what a hero is not .
I:17943;3123;the real star of the movie is Batman's arch.
I:17943;3124;"well, that's the Joker in ""The Dark Knight."
I:17943;3125;He can plan the perfect bank heist, and kill anyone he wants .
I:17943;3126;and we all know that what brilliant villains can do best is rationalize .
I:17943;3127;"Heath Ledger gives a marvelously subtle performance in ""Brokeback Mountain,"" and you have to believe he's trying his best to articulate something in ""The Dark Knight"" ."
I:17943;3128;"His debut ""Memento,"" though rough and jagged and excessive, is still nevertheless powerful and shocking ."
I:17943;3129;one of the best films ever made.
I:17943;3130;his best film to date .
I:17943;3131;he shows what a very skilled craftsman he is.
I:17943;3132;"And ""The Dark Knight"" is competently made ."
I:17943;3133;the music is superb, the various subplots weave together nicely, and the cinematography is stunning and innovative.
I:17943;3134;Does he want to make eye candy, and delight the 16.
I:17943;3135;provoking character study that will affirm his status as one of Hollywood's best young filmmakers?
I:17943;3136;"He asks hard questions but gives easy answers
I:17943;3137;and thus the consistent and competent Mr. Nolan may be stuck making consistently competent films all his life, and already Mr. Nolan must be asking: why?
I:17943;3138;At least the Joker must enjoy killing and Christopher Nolan enjoy directing but Mr. Bale does not look happy playing Batman .
I:17943;3139;Again, in our popular culture, Batman is one of the great contradictions.
I:17943;3140;But more importantly he's one of the greatest inventions.
I:17943;3141;Boys all think it'd be cool to be powerful and unique .
I:17943;3142;So adults imbue every comic book superhero with a conscience, and adults always tell kids it's this conscience that makes the superhero really a superhero.
I:17943;3143;Is a superhero with a conscience really cool?
I:17943;3144;Batman is a misunderstood superhero .
I:17943;3145;and for kids that's really cool, and if their misunderstood superhero has a conscience that's okay because he's being chased by the police.
I:17943;3146;By becoming a fugitive and being outlawed Batman shows he's cooler than the Joker.
I:17943;3147;You have a clean conscience, and you have the respect of all your peers.
I:17943;3148;we were right to cheer for Batman all along.
I:17943;3149;Probably the best of the 3 series, but this movie took the comic book franchise in a hole new direction!
I:17943;3150;Heath was unbelievable as the joker, and this is a very intense film.
I:17943;3151;Of course the Joker performance is fantastic.
I:17943;3152;Hands down this has to be the best Batman movie ever made and I've seen them all even the incredibly bad and campy Batman and Robin.
I:17943;3153;Chris Nolan really nailed it on the head by getting the Batman right with this film and its the best one of the trilogy.
I:17943;3154;The ensemble cast is amazing, Christian Bale delivers as Bruce Wayne/Batman (despite the whole thing with his Bat voice.)
I:17943;3155;Gary Oldman, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman shine in their repeat performances as Jim Gordon, Alfred and Lucius Fox.
I:17943;3156;Aaron Eckhart did a great job as Harvey Dent and his insane coin flipping persona, Two.
I:17943;3157;His scenes from the pencil trick to the very end with his climatic battle with Batman will be what I remember the most from the movie.
I:17943;3158;The Dark Knight is simply incredible.
I:17943;3159;The Dark Knight however is even better than I hoped for.
I:17943;3160;the movie is an ingenious masterpiece with many twists and turns.
I:17943;3161;Despite being a super hero film it also works as a mob/thriller.
I:17943;3162;comic fans should still be pleased though.
I:17943;3163;Heath Ledger is amazing as the Joker and it's sad that he won't have a long career of playing the part.
I:17943;3164;It's also smart that we don't even know what made him the way he is.
I:17943;3165;what also helps the movie is that everyone other than Ledger are in top form as well.
I:17943;3166;This movie is pretty much the best thing to come out of the new millenium.
I:17943;3167;I love this movie and to have it in Blu.
I:17943;3168;My wife and I just enjoy this movie and it is really a classic and a great film.
I:17943;3169;It is almost a perfect transition movie that is made from a comic book story into a full length feature film.
I:17943;3170;The storyline is very good and well written and the acting is spot on with a great cast of actors.
I:17943;3171;I like Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) in this movie and Alfred (Michael Caine) just plays the perfect role.
I:17943;3172;I also liked seeing Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) again in the movie as he is always a great actor.
I:17943;3173;The movie is filled with action and suspense and as the Joker's plans play out and you wonder how it will end.
I:17943;3174;I recommend it to you as a great film and if you are a Batman fan then it is a must see film.
I:17943;3175;Now that four years have passed since the hype and elation of my first viewing, I feel I can now write objectively about this film, and Nolan's overall Batman approach.
I:17943;3176;"I'm also old enough to have been age appropriate in the 80s when Frank Miller's masterpiece ""The Dark Knight Returns"" was released and turned the comics industry on it's ears."
I:17943;3177;That was a Batman that was dark, gritty, and someone to fear.
I:17943;3178;In an attempt to bring Batman into the real world, thus making his exploits all the more relatable to the viewer, Nolan has removed the fantasy elements that make Batman so great!
I:17943;3179;but Joker should be somewhat likeable.
I:17943;3180;but in the comic books his exploits are fascinating and inventive.
I:17943;3181;I have read Batman stories for decades and I assure you.
I:17943;3182;There is almost always an angle with him/something to be gained.
I:17943;3183;it's a good film as far as action dramas go.
I:17943;3184;"decent comic book movie and that's Batman with Big Jack, plus Basinger when she was still hot (""stop the press, who is that!"")"
I:17943;3185;the best thing about this movie is the bank heist of the first ten minutes.
I:17943;3186;An hour in I was thinking .
I:17943;3187;The glory of Jack in the first Batman is that he is fun, and almost believable.
I:17943;3188;I highly recommend this movie for anyone who loves action and Christian Bale as Batman.
I:17943;3189;It is highly entertaining and gets better with repeated viewings.
I:17943;3190;Heath Ledger is phenomenal as The Joker .
I:17943;3191;an unforgettable performance from an unforgettable actor.
I:17943;3192;And will Morgan Freeman stop taking roles in which he's the ultimate paragon of honesty?
I:17943;3193;The Joker may be the best on.
I:17943;3194;I saw the Dark Knight without seeing Batman Begins simply because I was curious and I needed something.
I:17943;3195;stop suspense and intensity with so many twists and unpredictable spins you're still thinking about it.
I:17943;3196;Christopher Nolan is a genius.
I:17943;3197;He very well may be the most talented person in Hollywood.
I:17943;3198;His realistic vision of the Batman franchise is remarkable.
I:17943;3199;The Dark Knight is a gritty crime drama that doesn't disappoint.
I:17943;3200;This is easily the best movie of 2008 and possibly the best movie of all.
I:17943;3201;The story, direction, and acting are all perfect.
I:17943;3202;Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is truly phenomenal, which leaves you in awe.
I:17943;3203;ray should look and sound fantastic.
I:17943;3204;Christain Bale is the best Batman ever.
I:17943;3205;And I have seen them all!!
I:17943;3206;Everyone knows about the movies that are very well written, casted, and directed.
I:17943;3207;I've been sifting through the reviews here on Amazon, and I'm truly amused by all the people who thought this movie was actually good.
I:17943;3208;I rarely voice that people should go invest their time in something else, but in this case I recommend for anyone who thought this was a Batman story to go read The Dark Knight, the definitive graphic novel by Frank Miller.
I:17943;3209;"After ""Batman Begins"", True Believers everywhere held out hope that the Batman ""franchise"" could be vitalized."
I:17943;3210;Though the 'origin story' of Bruce Wayne.
I:17943;3211;let's begin with Christian Bale.
I:17943;3212;In addition to being a talented actor and great looking, he's able to strike the balance that the Bruce Wayne of Frank Miller had to strike: playboy, millionaire, ill at ease in high.
I:17943;3213;Wayne should move easily in rarefied air, and carries on his shoulders the mantle of his father's legacy.
I:17943;3214;He is the Prince of Orphans, and plays it effectively.
I:17943;3215;He's a true heart as well, which gets lost in the focus on the psychopathia that a vigilante would have to actually wear just under the skin.
I:17943;3216;much has been made of Heath Ledger's performance of the Joker, and well it should be.
I:17943;3217;"Matching him with pretty boy Eric Roberts was a masterful stroke
I:17943;3218;air mix of pure combustion.
I:17943;3219;"To be sure, the writing is outstanding and plays upon the ""You Made ME!"""
I:17943;3220;It's beautifully executed by Messrs. Nolan and Nolan.
I:17943;3221;aaron Eckhart also redeems the Harvey Dent character.
I:17943;3222;face is rooted in an idealism run afoul.
I:17943;3223;face's murderous spree, and the course is set between bespoiled honor and heroism in Batman's ultimate flight.
I:17943;3224;It's about time, and I'm jealous of you if you are about to see the results for the first time.
I:17943;3225;This is an outstanding movie!
I:17943;3226;What sound and crisp picture!
I:17943;3227;I enjoyed watching this movie.
I:17943;3228;It was great from beginning to end.
I:17943;3229;This is a great follow up to the Prequel.
I:17943;3230;I am a big fan of batman and this is definitely a great movie.
I:17943;3231;packed and full of entertainment.
I:17943;3232;To my surprise the movie turned out to be very entertaining.
I:17943;3233;It's funny, dramatic, clever, and full of action sequences.
I:17943;3234;this movie has generated nearly $1 Billion worldwide, and you'll have to see it to believe it.
I:17943;3235;A movie that belongs in every collection.
I:17943;3236;We enjoyed The Black Knight a lot.
I:17943;3237;I hadn't seen the film since the opening weekend 4 years ago and thought it was solid, so I decided to finally pop in the Blu.
I:17943;3238;It goes over the top in almost all areas, especially in its crazy, suspenseful story, incredible buildup of suspense, and unrelenting depiction of evil.
I:17943;3239;the Dark Knight tells an intense, suspenseful, and crazy story.
I:17943;3240;one of the things that makes this film so memorable is the pure evil that is the Joker.
I:17943;3241;Heath Ledger did a simply amazing job of portraying this character, and it's a shame that he'll never know he did the best acting job of the year.
I:17943;3242;He portrays a villain that reveals the darkest corners of the human heart, a place I now have caught a glimpse of thanks to his incredible performance.
I:17943;3243;Yet despite his sheer brutality, he is absolutely hilarious as well.
I:17943;3244;"With lines such as ""You complete me, you're just so much fun"" and ""I think we're destined to do this forever,"" (both of which are said to Batman) Joker's performance shows comedic genius and also depravation of all that is good."
I:17943;3245;another interesting character is Harvey Dent.
I:17943;3246;His character and inspiration is portrayed in many scenes, and the court scene where he takes the guy's gun shows what he's like in his position and is also laugh out loud funny.
I:17943;3247;I found that very interesting.
I:17943;3248;Again excellently portrayed by Christian Bale, Batman has many struggles in this film.
I:17943;3249;"Christian Bale makes a perfect Batman
I:17943;3250;The buildup of tension is incredible, and I don't think I've ever seen a movie that kept me on the edge of my seat more than this.
I:17943;3251;"There's always the question of ""Who is the Joker going to target next?"""
I:17943;3252;And the sequences of the film are all done so well that it really keeps you into it every moment and never loses you attention for a single breath.
I:17943;3253;the tension also builds up by way of sound.
I:17943;3254;Hans Zimmer composed the score for The Dark Knight, and in that lies some incredibly epic pieces of music and some aggravating, yet tension.
I:17943;3255;These noises hard to describe, actually, but they build up the suspense in an extraordinary way the likes of which I have never heard before.
I:17943;3256;the Dark Knight also has some fantastic visual effects.
I:17943;3257;The explosions are spectacular, Batman's stunts are very entertaining, and everything seems totally realistic.
I:17943;3258;The suspense is really one of the film's strongest points, and the ways in which that is done can be looked to as an example for future films.
I:17943;3259;This is one of my favorite movies.
I:17943;3260;ray presentation makes it that much better.
I:17943;3261;"Many would agree that ""The Dark Knight"" is an excellent film, deserving 5 stars here on Amazon review."
I:17943;3262;also, you will note from other reviewers that 2.
I:17943;3263;"Batman of the comics was the hero with the ""wow!"""
I:17943;3264;A hero has to grow up and move along with time, adapt to a culture in which drive.
I:17943;3265;hero shows miraculous muscle growth over time, in which every certainty starts having a question.
I:17943;3266;"we deserve this Batman
I:17943;3267;Go see the movie and let your mind do the wandering over the various levels at which this movie speaks to you, from the gut to the brain to the emotions.
I:17943;3268;"Finally, someone knows how to make a damn good superhero movie."""
I:17943;3269;For me, the sequel/Dark Knight is better than its predecessor.
I:17943;3270;"I told my wife again, ""Now THIS is how they should make sequels, it's that damn good!"""
I:17943;3271;He brings the Joker's character to a whole new level.
I:17943;3272;The storyline is great, everything is great.
I:17943;3273;It's a truly original, as well as faithful performance.
I:17943;3274;This is the real Joker through and through, but re.
I:17943;3275;And by saying this, I dare you to find Heath Ledger anywhere in that mad man on the silver screen.
I:17943;3276;the entire cast is the strongest of any recent movie I've seen, but I will say there's one moment where Bale's raspy voice as the Dark Knight is kind of awkward.
I:17943;3277;No movie's perfect, but this one may well inspire a three.
I:17943;3278;His performance is our gain, the story's loss.
I:17943;3279;A great movie in and of itself.
I:17943;3280;Yes it met my expectations.
I:17943;3281;In this latest Batman outing, it is the brilliant acting by the late Heath Ledger as the Joker that becomes the core of the movie in probably his greatest role.
I:17943;3282;He embellished the part with quirky mannerisms like poking the corner of his mouth with his tongue.
I:17943;3283;The funniest scene is when he's in a nurse's dress walking away from his horrific bombing of a hospital.
I:17943;3284;If he is made to look like a machine, how does that jibe with his deep angst over his human conscience?Subsidiary characters are very well.
I:17943;3285;This movie has two supervillains because it also features Two.
I:17943;3286;face with his coin tosses from the comic books.
I:17943;3287;The scarred half of his face features an eye like a big marble.
I:17943;3288;watch for spectacular vehicular mayhem with trucks, creative camera work featuring the eerie and forbidding cityscape with a scale that dwarfs human beings.
I:17943;3289;this movie entices the senses, and gives us lots of WOW moments.
I:17943;3290;This is a fine movie, but its length and repetitiveness are off.
I:17943;3291;This movie is great due in large part to Heath Ledger's interpretation of the Joker.
I:17943;3292;I would recommend this to any Batman fan.
I:17943;3293;This is probably the best movie of the trilogy.
I:17943;3294;It is really a stylish, brutal, and emotionally gripping, thriller which asks how far a crime.
I:17943;3295;Gary Oldman's Gotham police lieutenant Gordan deserves ample praise to for its emotional complexity, as does Aaron Eckhart's brilliant performance as the crusading young Gotham district attorney Harvey Dent, who is transformed eventually into another homicidal lunatic, Two.
I:17943;3296;Maggie Gyllenhaal is quite convincing too as Wayne's long.
I:17943;3297;time friend, Rachel Dawes, while Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman return again to offer excellent performances as the butler Alfred, and Wayne Corporation technological guru Lucius Fox.
I:17943;3298;"fisted reins on the picture itself, offering us not a single wasted shot of unnecessary dialogue or gratuitous violence
I:17943;3299;The Dark Knight must be regarded not only as the best film from the summer of 2008, but also, among the very best of the year so far.
I:17943;3300;co. starring Maggie Gyllenhall, Michael Caine, Eric Roberts, Michael Jai White, Cillian Murphy and Anthony Michael Hall, this is truly one of the best movies in recent memory.
I:17943;3301;"This is one of those rare sequels that can actually be better then the original and can be a masterpiece, while ""Batman Begins"" which rebooted the Batman series thanks to Christopher Nolan was the appetizer then get ready for the main course which is this movie."
I:17943;3302;This one is more action packed, more smarter and more emotional then the last one as it with a great performance by the late Heath Ledger who passed away when the film was done filming, which is kind of tragic for a very good actor like him to die so early for he gives a performance of a lifetime as everyone's favorite Bat.
I:17943;3303;"Co. writer, producer and director Christopher Nolan has proved to himself to be one of the greatest directors in recent memory for he reinvented the superhero movie genre much like Richrd Donner did with ""Superman 1 and 2"", Bryan Singer with ""X. men 1 and 2"" and Sam Raimi with ""Spider."
I:17943;3304;"man 1 and 2"" but making it more of a gritty adult crime action drama then just a comic."
I:17943;3305;"up Batman movie then before with the exception of ""Batman Begins"" as it proves that even a comic book movie can be a great masterpiece."
I:17943;3306;This is a must have for everyone who loves movies and the comic film genre together!
I:17943;3307;Note that the one star reflects the Blu.
I:17943;3308;Alot of the film was shot in IMAX.
I:17943;3309;ray and the downloaded version shows alot that when they Pan and Scaned the IMAX footage they cut some of the picture out.
I:17943;3310;Yeah, I bet you all have smiles on your faces!
I:17943;3311;You love this type of excitement and beauty, don't you?Batman is the Dark Knight *****The Dark Knight (Two.
I:17943;3312;Christopher Nolan, David Goyer, and the army of creatives and techs involved in this work work very firmly in the comic book/pulp fiction vein, but they treat the tropes of genre with the appropriate seriousness, and have created a work of art to stand next to the best in film.
I:17943;3313;His dark intensity makes the man, his mission, and his torment very real.
I:17943;3314;sublime in his madness, joyful in his violence, brilliant in his dire designs.
I:17943;3315;this is classic filmic storytelling at its finest.
I:17943;3316;This was instantly one of my favorite movies once it hit theaters, and watching it on Blu.
I:17943;3317;ray really has a similar effect to the silver screen.
I:17943;3318;The picture is very true, and the sound is superb.
I:17943;3319;The acting for this action movie is excellent, and Heath Ledger's last major performance was certainly among his best.
I:17943;3320;The twisted nature of the Joker is disturbing, but also somewhat intriguing at the same time.
I:17943;3321;Best batman movie in a very long time!
I:17943;3322;"Hard to be sure if this film's ""must."
I:17943;3323;Certainly the previews looked good, and the viral marketing campaign was interesting though not compelling.
I:17943;3324;this film was, is, and will forever be anchored by Ledger's performance as The Joker.
I:17943;3325;"Truthfully, I liked ""The Dark Knight"" a lot."
I:17943;3326;"many fans of this movie are touting director Christopher Nolan as a ""genius"" for the way he crafted this movie."
I:17943;3327;Let's ease up on the fanboy hyperbole, shall we?
I:17943;3328;He did a competent job but he is no genius.
I:17943;3329;Any one of several talented writer/directors could have done equally well if not better.
I:17943;3330;up excitement for the film's release, color your objectivity.
I:17943;3331;The movie feels more like a series of moments strung together rather than a story with a smooth flow.
I:17943;3332;The Dark KnightThis is a fantastic movie.
I:17943;3333;Chris Bale is the propper Brue Wayne and Batman as well as his police link Jim Gordon played by Gary Oldman.
I:17943;3334;"This last is probably the best Jim Gordon ever
I:17943;3335;The Batman is an undestructible and credible hero.
I:17943;3336;The extra features are what we all fans expect.
I:17943;3337;Primary actors played their roles very convincingly.
I:17943;3338;I bought this movie because I was thinking of seeing the follow.
I:17943;3339;ray top 3 Ive seen.
I:17943;3340;, easily the best movie made in last two decades.
I:17943;3341;The story is excellent, before this movie came out I had very high expectations just like when Spiderman 2 came out.
I:17943;3342;I thought Spiderman 2 was the best superhero movie made until The Dark Knight came out.
I:17943;3343;All the acting was top notch.
I:17943;3344;Christian Bale was good as Bruce Wayne and Batman, Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine and Maggie Gyllanhall gave excellent performances.
I:17943;3345;Every scene he is in is perfectly shot and delivered.
I:17943;3346;A lot of it has to do with Heath Ledger's death sparking an intense interest in the film, but also the fact that the iconic villain The Joker is in the movie, no matter who plays the character.
I:17943;3347;The new Christopher Nolan Batman series has that feel and atmosphere.
I:17943;3348;Very modern, realistic, and dark.
I:17943;3349;I thought Ledger's performance was good.
I:17943;3350;His portrayal of The Joker was adequate for this realistic modern Batman movie.
I:17943;3351;Ledger did a good job ACTING, but the Joker should be funnier and live up to his name, The Joker.
I:17943;3352;In other words, crack some jokes.
I:17943;3353;There should be a balance of evilness and dark humor.
I:17943;3354;it was nice to see that this movie gave a tip of the hat to Cesar Romero during the bank robbery scene at the beginning of the movie.
I:17943;3355;years voice of his has got to go.
I:17943;3356;while I like Katie Holmes a little better than Maggie Gyllenhaal in the role of Rachel Dawes, Gyllenhaal's performance was good.
I:17943;3357;Rachel in Batman Begins seems feisty, sassy, confident, and has sort of an attitude.
I:17943;3358;This movie has everything .
I:17943;3359;"People in a ""realistic"" world would laugh at him."
I:17943;3360;If you're going to make a movie based on comic book characters, make it look like a comic book movie, not something that looks like a realistic and serious cop drama on primetime TV.
I:17943;3361;Look at what he's done to the characters as well, including the iconic Joker.
I:17943;3362;In my opinion, Batman movies should always have a comic book feel to them, not a crime drama feel to them.
I:17943;3363;Lots of action, ledger was impressive, he owned the role of the joker.
I:17943;3364;christian was great as usual love, love, love
I:17943;3365;ray] which, to me, is one of the top three super hero films of all time along side the likes ofSpider.
I:17943;3366;Where Iron Man brought the super hero genera back to life with its wit and satire after the incredible flop that wasSpider.
I:17943;3367;Gotham has always seemed, to me at least, considering the various comics, animated shows and films, to be somewhat, I don't know, demonic and unreal.
I:17943;3368;The great lengths the craters put into making even the nuttiest villains, such as The Joker and Two Face, believable is outstanding.
I:17943;3369;He's given a complete overhaul in this film, given character and personality as well as some wicked awesome makeup.
I:17943;3370;"He simply likes watching the world burn
I:17943;3371;"He's not crazy, he tells us, he's simply ""ahead of the curve."
I:17943;3372;He's an animal who wants to show the rest of us that we are too, that when push comes to shove, the animalistic nature in all of us will win out and consume us.
I:17943;3373;That's his goal all along, that and simply having a little fun.
I:17943;3374;He is us, the common man stripped of everything he values.
I:17943;3375;i could go one and on about how this is one of the best movie I've ever seen.
I:17943;3376;This is quite likely the best film of the year, and if its not nominated for best picture at the end of the year I'm going to throw a fit.
I:17943;3377;One of the best movies in the history of the world!
I:17943;3378;This is by far the darkest Batman movie and that's a good thing because it delivers plenty of action, violence, and an extremely intriguing plot.
I:17943;3379;plots that are very interesting and add something special because it adds a dark feeling to the viewing experience.
I:17943;3380;Also, the action sequences are extremely well done and make the movie spectacular.
I:17943;3381;ar The acting is simply great.
I:17943;3382;Christian Bale delivers a more humanistic but aggressive Batman.
I:17943;3383;He gives emotions to the character and that's why he's likable.
I:17943;3384;But Heath Ledger steals the show with his wicked and deep performance as the devilish and disturbed Joker.
I:17943;3385;the action is just excellent, a delight for everyone.
I:17943;3386;All the action sequences involving the Joker are stuff for legend.
I:17943;3387;the pace is extremely well done and you don't feel the movie is almost three hours long.
I:17943;3388;please watch this masterpiece of modern action supported by an interesting plot that deals with fictional politics and deep character development.
I:17943;3389;A new classic and the best Batman movie to date.
I:17943;3390;"Although it looks like a simple movie in the beginning, ""The Dark Knight"" is a complex film that plays on the fear of anarchy."
I:17943;3391;Each hoodlum with a clown face shoots the other until the Joker arrives to take his money for himself.
I:17943;3392;batman, also known as Bruce Wayne, works with Police Lieutenant Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent.
I:17943;3393;girlfriend, Bruce is certain that Harvey would be the person to bring peace and justice to Gotham City.
I:17943;3394;batman may be a hero, but he never does everything perfect.
I:17943;3395;This is one of the few films that shows that a superhero is vulnerable, and he puts so many things at risk to do his job.
I:17943;3396;This is a postmodern masterpiece of a superhero movie that puts all other superheroes to shame.
I:17943;3397;Great movie, as probably you all know.
I:17943;3398;This Amazon instant streaming thing is pretty cool.
I:17943;3399;It was a strong his performance.
I:17943;3400;Batman Begins was a breath of fresh air into the rather beleagured Batman Series with some dissappointing versions since the first one with Michael Keaton.
I:17943;3401;"In ""Begins"" the series was effectively reset bringing new life and depth to the character and the series and the ""Dark Knight"" surpasses them all."
I:17943;3402;but overall it is extremely well written, directed and filmed.
I:17943;3403;"the cast is solid, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine are such great actors in their own right and they are able to bring so much depth and emotion to ""comic book"" charactors (which of course is a fnction of also having a good script.)"
I:17943;3404;Watch some of the scenes .
I:17943;3405;Caine with a note in his care, Freeman, including a scene I will not mention due to possible spolier or any time Oldman performed.
I:17943;3406;Each body movement, facial twitch and movement, breath through the teeth was amazing.
I:17943;3407;He was simply that good.
I:17943;3408;Both of these nitpicks are very minor and due in part to the fact that so much of the movie was done on such a high level that the bar was raised so high .
I:17943;3409;A large part of the thrill of this movie is in the suspense, which can be lost if you know the movie well.
I:17943;3410;Impeccable adrenaline rush movie, well crafted, scripted, acted movie.
I:17943;3411;You will be wanting to see this movie time and time again.
I:17943;3412;The very talented and amazing Heath Ledger really out does himself as the Joker.
I:17943;3413;It's a real pity that this will be the last film we will ever see him in, the Joker was scary and psychotically entertaining, he pretty much stole the entire show.
I:17943;3414;Spectacular action, a superb cast and a mesmerizing story will maintain your attention the entire time.
I:17943;3415;You don't have to be a Batman or comic book fan to like this film, it's really that good.
I:17943;3416;Best of all, see Heath Ledger put on a great performance as one of the best comic book character icons of all time.
I:17943;3417;I'm a fan of the Tim Burton Batman films, but this is a much darker rendition of the Dark Horse Batman series and done very well might I add.
I:17943;3418;Seeing is believing, and Dark Knight is worth every last penny.
I:17943;3419;Heath Ledger gives an epic performance.
I:17943;3420;Moves quickly, drama and suspense are well done .
I:17943;3421;Nice camera work, good acting .
I:17943;3422;as usual Zimmer provides a great score.
I:17943;3423;All around a great movie.
I:17943;3424;I got the blue ray version that came with the joker mask.
I:17943;3425;Not to mention the movie itself is one of the best movies in years.
I:17943;3426;The Imax used to film this movie make this a perfect addition to any blu.
I:17943;3427;The late Heath Ledger is quite impressive as The Joker.
I:17943;3428;The Dark Knight is very serious and it keeps the humor to a minimum.
I:17943;3429;The Dark Knight is a solid Batman movie.
I:17943;3430;picture perfect and when the imax kicks its flawlesssound is perfect i really like itu want to show off ur tv this is the moviethe joker best villan i ever seen
I:17943;3431;The first reason why I love this movie is becuase Heath Ledger's performance.
I:17943;3432;Probably the best villian of all.
I:17943;3433;The material used is 100% plastic, it will look really good along with your movie collection.
I:17943;3434;great lines, amazing acting,, great finish.
I:17943;3435;Christian Bale shines despite his voice.
I:17943;3436;heath Ledger tears it up and this movie just looks incredible and clear on blu.
I:17943;3437;thank god for ebay i found the correct one.
I:17943;3438;Great pacing, characters, action and story.
I:17943;3439;Grab a big bowl of popcorn and enjoy one of the greatest superhero movies ever.
I:17943;3440;This movie is one of the best I have seen Its simply amazing and no other movie can top the Batman I really loved the seller I bought it from and I will by from them again But overall its a great movie I would tell anyone to but it and watch it THE DARK KNIGHT!!!!!!!
I:17943;3441;Excellent movie, Lots Action Packed Sequences, I am a Batman Fan, Not a Huge one, but nonetheless.
I:17943;3442;The movie is great, great soundtrack, very gritty and dark.
I:17943;3443;Great movie for anyone whether your into comic books like me or not.
I:17943;3444;The acting by Heath Ledger was great.
I:17943;3445;I was skeptical about him winning an Oscar based on sentimentality but he deserves it.
I:17943;3446;I can watch this movie 4 times in a row.
I:17943;3447;It was one of the top two highest grossing films ever along with Spider Man 3.
I:17943;3448;I completely disliked this movie.
I:17943;3449;Scrap everything they have built in Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, Get them some new actors, and a decent writer (Will Bryan Singer please stand up) and start anew.
I:17943;3450;Great film, definitely recommend owning it.
I:17943;3451;ray offering or the special edition offerings.
I:17943;3452;Overall if you want the film without a bunch of extra's this is the best bet.
I:17943;3453;The movie really holds up.
I:17943;3454;Though I prefer Batman Begins, this has a lot to offer.
I:17943;3455;Both are absolutely superb filmsThe extras are interesting.
I:17943;3456;along with the bonus features, those are all on disc 2.
I:17943;3457;The film fits on the first disc.
I:17943;3458;You can watch it with subtitles in English, French, Spanish.
I:17943;3459;Probably the best film that came out this year, and fully deserving of the hype.
I:17943;3460;Michael Caine is superb, so's Aaron Eckhart (as the illfated White Knight of Gotham).
I:17943;3461;Great supporting cast, great scenes all around.
I:17943;3462;Well worth seeing as 20 minutes of the film were shot in IMAX formatBe seeing you
I:17943;3463;"Honestly, ""The Dark Knight"" is a very good movie."
I:17943;3464;It's dark, dramatic, full of rich themes, unexpected developments, and great performances.
I:17943;3465;"For the record, I think the previous movie, ""Batman Begins"" was the most successful Bat."
I:17943;3466;film in striking the right balance between moody constructed sets and location shooting done on real streets.
I:17943;3467;I like the movie a lot, but I think you'll enjoy it more if you lower your expectations a little (that last comment goes out to the four people who haven't yet seen the movie in theaters and will be catching it for the first time on disc).
I:17943;3468;"when all is said and done, see ""The Dark Knight"" for Heath Ledger, a few good set pieces, the brooding music, and a couple unexpected shocks."
I:17943;3469;What the heck was with Batman's voice.
I:17943;3470;i mean jack is great but i love nolans joker
I:17943;3471;I'm sure everyone has seen this movie, and seen the amazing performances by the cast.
I:17943;3472;I love most of the marvel movies but sometimes they take more of a cartoonie and humor route that sort of cheats their films.
I:17943;3473;I still have yet to see my perfect on screen version of the Joker but Heath is far and away the best yet.
I:17943;3474;An entertaining but far from perfect film.
I:17943;3475;Classic the joker is the best character in the movie.
I:17943;3476;A lot of TLC was done during the production of this movie to make it something special that I believe in a few short years will make this a classic and I think it already will be the measuring stick that all future comic book movies will be measured by.
I:17943;3477;There is NO commentary track.
I:17943;3478;"This probably means that in a few months they will come out with a special edition that will ""correct"" this oversight."
I:17943;3479;Man this movie is the Best Batman movie so far.
I:17943;3480;And as for Christian Bale he showed a great deep strugle with being Batman.
I:17943;3481;And I say that's good I guess that goes to show you in real life what it would like if we had a Real life Vigilante.
I:17943;3482;The plot is intense, the Joker ridiculously wicked, Batman severely conflicted, and oscar worthy performances of the 2 main actors as well as an all.
I:17943;3483;If you have debated seeing this for a while, I would highly recommend giving it a watch!
I:17943;3484;it is the greatest comic adaptation of all time everyone and anyone should watch this amazing picture if your a fan of the batman or not its just outstandind every aspect of this film well leave you amazed a must watch film for any age anyone: a movie like this only comes every few decades.
I:17943;3485;with Batman Begins, Christopher Nolan brought new life to the Batman franchise.
I:17943;3486;That film was a very strong film, but The Dark Knight is a complete change in tone from it.
I:17943;3487;what struck me about the film watching it again was how well written it is.
I:17943;3488;"The script (by Christopher and Jonathan Nolan) is very tight
I:17943;3489;As a director, Nolan can do it all and here he balances drama, suspense, and elaborate action sequences (with a remarkable lack of CGI) effortlessly.
I:17943;3490;The film's terrific opening scene shows off Nolan's skill in both of these areas of filmmaking, as it's one of the most memorable opening scenes of the last several years setting the tone for the film and serving as an incredible introduction to the Joker.
I:17943;3491;the film is extremely well.
I:17943;3492;made with an epic score (by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard), striking cinematography (by Wally Pfister), and an elaborately detailed production design (by Nathan Crowley) particularly standing out.
I:17943;3493;much of the cast from Batman Begins returns here and have all settled nicely into their roles.
I:17943;3494;Michael Caine (Alfred) and Morgan Freeman (Lucius Fox) are as charming and fatherly as ever.
I:17943;3495;Gary Oldman as Lieutenant Gordon is very impressive, bringing a great deal of humanity and likeability to a role that many actors couldn't convey.
I:17943;3496;Christian Bale solidifies his status as the best Batman to grace the screen balancing the charming, arrogant Bruce Wayne and the angry, violent Batman.
I:17943;3497;It's an impressive performance of an iconic comic.
I:17943;3498;face, of course) really shines here.
I:17943;3499;Eckhart does an extraordinary job taking a complicated character with an unbelievable character arc and making it believable.
I:17943;3500;His Oscar win was not a sympathy vote nor does this sympathy play into the unanimous acclaim, nor the endearing popularity of this performance.
I:17943;3501;It's one of the best, most fascinating screen performances of the last decade.
I:17943;3502;This was an actor who had not even begun to show the world what he was capable of and, in one of his final roles he created one of the most iconic, memorable screen villains in cinematic history.
I:17943;3503;the Dark Knight is one of the few summer blockbusters that actually stands as a great film, because of brilliant writing and brilliant performances.
I:17943;3504;The Dark Knight is a high.
I:17943;3505;minded popcorn movie, but most high.
I:17943;3506;"Yes, you will read at least one person anywhere talking about how ""overrated"" this movie is, but don't let that affect your own opinion of it."
I:17943;3507;It's not one of my favorite films of all time, but it's a very good, very rich film that is a truly masterful piece of filmmaking.
I:17943;3508;Overall, the movie has a good story, although slow at times, and an okay cast.
I:17943;3509;you like good picture and marvelous acting?
I:17943;3510;The action scenes are most impressive.
I:17943;3511;i enjoyed seeing Eric Roberts in this batman flick even though his part was small.
I:17943;3512;I just really thought this movie was great.
I:17943;3513;He was stronger than Christian Bale and much better than Maggie Gyllenhaal ( I can never spell that name right!)
I:17943;3514;Overall, the characters were better than the story but I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes a good, scary, big movie that makes you think.
I:17943;3515;The Dark Knight is just one heck of an awesome Batman film.
I:17943;3516;Definitely recommended to any fan of Batman, especially on Blu.
I:17943;3517;I have to say that this is one of the best movies I have every seen.
I:17943;3518;I have watched it multiple times since then and have enjoyed every second.
I:17943;3519;what makes this film, in my opinion, a masterpiece and not just another summer blockbuster is how deeply it involves the viewer in the action itself.
I:17943;3520;The masterful artistic element is how Christopher Nolan immerses the viewer.
I:17943;3521;done action flick, replete with special effects and hyperbolic action galore.
I:17943;3522;it demands a very personal reaction from the viewer.
I:17943;3523;He carefully balances which emotions he elicits from the viewer, oscillating from uncertainty to laughter to outright terror.
I:17943;3524;timed comic relief, only heightening the overall sense of instability that dominates this film.
I:17943;3525;The most triumphant moments are consistently thwarted, interrupted, or otherwise overturned .
I:17943;3526;"unlike other movies of the genre, Nolan's masterpiece presents a very complex understanding of morality and forces the viewer to analyze his own morality in the tense ""What would I do?"""
I:17943;3527;And while everything else about the movie is entirely epic and grandiose, morality is very realistically complicated and personal.
I:17943;3528;Nolan is able to successfully individualize the epic and takes the viewer through a wide range of emotional experiences.
I:17943;3529;The culmination of all the uncertainty, moral ambiguity, and terror built upon during the film make the ending of this movie, without spoiling it, one of the most rewarding experiences in modern cinema.
I:17943;3530;Was sent in a timely fashion as promised by the seller.
I:17943;3531;Was in excellent condition and brand new as promised.
I:17943;3532;Thanks for doing great business!
I:17943;3533;I got this film for Christmas and I was so excited, not just because I love the movie, but because of the awesome special features I was looking forward to watching.
I:17943;3534;the film itself is, hands down, one of the most brilliant films I have ever seen.
I:17943;3535;Nolan is truly a master director and Heath Ledger should get the oscar for best supporting, and that's not even mentioning all the other great actors that put on stellar performances in this film.
I:17943;3536;That being said, the special features disc is a whole other story.
I:17943;3537;It was wonderful to watch.
I:17943;3538;"So, if you are someone who is looking for a really great special features disc, which this ""Two."
I:17943;3539;"disc Special Edition"" leads you to believe it is."
I:17943;3540;But the popcorn was good.
I:17943;3541;"The acting performances are great, the IMAX SHOTS are excellent, Heath Ledger's Joker was quite simply hypnotic, Aaron Eckhart's Harvey Dent/Two Face was inspired, it fell in line with Jim Loeb and Tim Sale's ""The Long Halloween"" Comic Book."
I:17943;3542;"the best part about Nolan's ""Dark Knight"" is the fact that we get to see Harvey's own gradual but personal descent into madness."
I:17943;3543;"Even though his ""Bat Growl"" makes him sound like he's got Throat cancer, Bale brings a seriousness to Batman, one that is welcomed among Bat."
I:17943;3544;michael Caine once again provides the suitable heart of the film as Alfred Pennyworth.
I:17943;3545;I felt that she brought a warmth and cadence to her performance.
I:17943;3546;Rachel clearly wants what's best for Bruce, despite the fact she can no longer wait for Bruce to resign as Batman.
I:17943;3547;Freeman brings an excellent sense of comic relief (Caine does the same with Alfred as well).
I:17943;3548;Fox supplies Bruce with a cool new Bat.
I:17943;3549;suit that is both more flexible and grounded in reality.
I:17943;3550;"other Notable Actors include Michael Jai White(who does a fine job as Gambol despite his small amount of screen time
I:17943;3551;"david S. Goyer and Jonathan Nolan's story is well done, which pits Batman against an enemy that he can't ""fully understand""."
I:17943;3552;The plot twists and turns make this film truly enjoyable to watch over and over again, and each time I see it, the movie itself still feels fresh and new, even five years since its theatrical release.
I:17943;3553;"my favorite scene in the film is still when Joker interrupts the ""broad daylight"" mob summit!"
I:17943;3554;"I love how he lies about his origin story to Gambol, Rachel, and even Batman himself during certain scenes in the movie, which is also in line with Joker's own ""multiple choice origin story"" aesthetic from the comics."
I:17943;3555;"the IMAX SHOTS (despite being few and far between in some moments in the movie) bring a tremendous amount of drama and weight to the now iconic action and landscape scenes that have become synonymous with Nolan's ""Batman"" Trilogy."
I:17943;3556;The shots make me wish that the entire movie was shot in IMAX, instead of a 35 mm format with some special shots for good measure.
I:17943;3557;That was an amazing scene!
I:17943;3558;"Nolan's ""Dark Knight"" was not just a good movie, but the centerpiece of a great Batman Trilogy."
I:17943;3559;I normally don't give out such very high grades for movies but Dark Knight really is that good.
I:17943;3560;Though it probably won't happen Bale, Ledger, and director Nolan should all get nominated for best actor and director respectively.
I:17943;3561;This movie is definitely multiple OSCAR worthy.
I:17943;3562;i have been a big fan of comic book hero/movie adaptations my whole life and I thought Spider Man II set the bar and still is an incredible movie but Dark Knight may have surpassed Spidey II.
I:17943;3563;the chemistry between the actors and the way the script flows was simply amazing and the special effects were extremely well done without being a bit too absurd like they were in Revenge of the Sith and yes I loved that movie too.
I:17943;3564;Heath Ledger's performance was just simply amazing.
I:17943;3565;He brought a personality and bone chilling cold ruthlessness yet compelling take of a villain that made me hate him yet understand why Joker acts the way he does in order to get his way.
I:17943;3566;This role alone will always make him remembered for generations to come.
I:17943;3567;i want to also give props to the supporting casts and say that I loved the actor's performance who played Harvey Dent.
I:17943;3568;Aaron Eckhart was superb in this role as he will be a great villain for the next movie.
I:17943;3569;I did however miss Katie Holmes take on Rachael Dawes but her portrayal by the beautiful Maggie Gyllenhaal was marvelous still.
I:17943;3570;finally Christopher Nolan has raised the bar for directing as at first I thought nobody would come close to Tim Burton's classic take of the first Batman.
I:17943;3571;go see it, its worth the hype it received and even people who hate these types of movies will like them.
I:17943;3572;Dark Knight drained me and touched me in a way few movies do and in my mind is easily one of the best movies ever made.
I:17943;3573;This is an Awesome movie the whole series with Christian Bale I really good he makes a good Batman Cant wait to have the Whole series
I:17943;3574;he is the ultimate real world supervillian: an unrepentent serial killer who just wants to watch the world burn.
I:17943;3575;it features one of the smartest and most exciting action sequences ever recorded on film: Batman tries to save hostages dressed as villians while fighting off both the real villians and the Gotham SWAT team, who think the hostages are the villians.
I:17943;3576;at the heart of this film is the surprisingly uplifting message that people are not as cynical as one might expect.
I:17943;3577;This is basically my favorite superhero movie to date and on blu ray it shines nicely.
I:17943;3578;The moral choices along with Batmans personal struggles all draw you in.
I:17943;3579;"I really had no idea of how talented he really was until I got to the end of the movie and said ""Wow""."
I:17943;3580;Though he is not even recognizable I found the Joker to be one of the best played out characters of all time.
I:17943;3581;The choices and decisions that are before Batman presented by the Joker are just so well played and so well thought out the eventual solutions Batman takes and the results all play nicely together.
I:17943;3582;Though some parts I found predictable this is far by my favorite superhero movie of all time and to great to be missed.
I:17943;3583;But one movie stood above all, and that of course was The Dark Knight.
I:17943;3584;Featuring a great, and somewhat believable story, great charaters, awesome acting, and great action sequences, this movie hit a home.
I:17943;3585;run with critics and fans alike.
I:17943;3586;Even Christian Bale, Morgan Freeman, and Michael Caine paled in comparison, but still helped create the best superhero movie ever made.
I:17943;3587;ray, this is an excellent transfer, and with the movie grossing as high as it did, I expected no less.
I:17943;3588;ray player, that is the way to go.
I:17943;3589;But The Dark Knight is probably the best looking Blu.
I:17943;3590;ray movie that I have ever watched!
I:17943;3591;Warner Brothers did a great job making the sharpness pop out of the screen, while maintaining the right contrast and tint.
I:17943;3592;In fact, it looks even better than it did on the big screen!
I:17943;3593;Even the extras they give you are all worth checking out, and maybe watching as much as the main movie itself.
I:17943;3594;if you are a Batman fan, or superhero movie fan in general, watch this movie if you haven't already.
I:17943;3595;Everybody involved in this movie did a great job, and truly is one of, if not the best of 2008.
I:17943;3596;As for the movie I'll say I bought it for Heath Ledger's part in it nothing more.
I:17943;3597;"It has ""play, scenes, and languages"", that's it."
I:17943;3598;This measure seems to be infecting all the big releases of late and I wonder if it's to push blueray sales.
I:17943;3599;As for the movie itself, it's a must.
I:17943;3600;Aaron Eckhart is surprisingly competent.
I:17943;3601;this is an impressive movie.
I:17943;3602;It will have a lasting effect on you, trust me.
I:17943;3603;It's extremely ambitious in both its visual and thematic conception.
I:17943;3604;It hits the target on the former.
I:17943;3605;It has qualified successes in the latter.
I:17943;3606;I just love this movie.
I:17943;3607;dimensional: the characters, the plot, the look.
I:17943;3608;My Batman comics from the '60s display greater dynamics in emotion and execution.
I:17943;3609;There is no doubt that Dark Knight is well written and features an incredible performance from Ledger.
I:17943;3610;Clearly, there is still a sense of whimsy without taking from the comic completely.
I:17943;3611;(a reason I wish I'd waited and seen it at home)Dark Knight raises deep morally rooted questions for which it gives some insight but lets you decide.
I:17943;3612;It leads us through disconcerting circumstances that are no doubt amplified to shine a light to the very essence of our being.
I:17943;3613;The way it was written toys with us so cleverly.
I:17943;3614;is it worth seeing in the theater?
I:17943;3615;I would say no, because most of the excitement comes in the dialogue which is truly masterful.
I:17943;3616;All I can say is this movie gets alot better after every viewing!
I:17943;3617;I can't even explain how great this movie is.
I:17943;3618;If you thought it was just alright the first time you saw it, think about it, go see it again, and most likely you'll realize how awesome it is.
I:17943;3619;I love this movie lol.
I:17943;3620;"Movie Maniac Review:Director Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" is by far the greatest movie of 2008, even with 5 months remaining at the box office."
I:17943;3621;christian Bale returns as the Dark Knight building onto his fine performance in the origin story Batman Begins.
I:17943;3622;Heath Ledger's oscar worthy performance of the sadistic psychopathic killer is simply astounding.
I:17943;3623;It was truly bittersweet to watch.
I:17943;3624;Jack Nicholson was a great Joker, and played the character well, but this is the crazed yet funny arch.
I:17943;3625;rival I believe the writers envisioned when they created the character.
I:17943;3626;Ledger's Joker ranks up there with Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal as one of the greatest villain portrayals to ever grace the silver screen.
I:17943;3627;all the supporting cast were excellent too.
I:17943;3628;Maggie has much better screen presence.
I:17943;3629;Freeman is again really funny as Fox and I love Caine's tender yet smart Alfred.
I:17943;3630;Oldman is also back as Lt. Jim Gordon and Batman's one true friend and liaison to Gotham's police force.
I:17943;3631;His role is expanded here and becomes a more central story figure.
I:17943;3632;Eckhart's performance is good, and gets better as the story moves on.
I:17943;3633;Scarecrow returns for a brief cameo and Two Face is introduced as well.
I:17943;3634;Props to the special effects people and makeup artists for their work on Two Face.
I:17943;3635;the soundtrack is excellent too.
I:17943;3636;Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard have created a suspenseful, moving score and experience that will put you on the edge of your seat.
I:17943;3637;there is plenty of car chases, shootouts, and hand to hand combat, along with some really cool new Batman gadgets to keep even the hardcore action fan entertained.
I:17943;3638;all in all, I thoroughly enjoyed the film, and it is worthy of several viewings at the local cineplex.
I:17943;3639;The movie is blowing away all sorts of box office records including midnight showing sales of 18.5 million and opening day records of 65 million on it's way to a major weekend take.
I:17943;3640;Even though you were taken before your time, you have left a lasting impression on me through your brilliant work as the Joker.
I:17943;3641;I thought the movie was very good, and well worth the money and time.
I:17943;3642;I just hooked up a newPanasonic DMP.
I:17943;3643;This is one of the best Batman movies to come out of DC yet.
I:17943;3644;Yes I think it had one of the best Jokers yet.
I:17943;3645;Bale is quite possibly the best Bruce/Batman ever on the big screen.
I:17943;3646;The writing was good enough that the movie did not have to depend on special effects.
I:17943;3647;in the opening scene it is full screen, and after the robbery scene, we get the black bars at the top and bottom.
I:17943;3648;IMO, if you are going to show something in one format, stick with it throughout the movie!!
I:17943;3649;Yes the picture looks very sharp and crisp, but it drove me nuts when they kept switching the format in the movie.
I:17943;3650;ray version is crisp and clear.
I:17943;3651;The movie itself is superbly acted and a thrill for any Batman lover.
I:17943;3652;This film is amazing with non.
I:17943;3653;"One person wrote, "" The hero is only as good as his villain"", and they were both great!"
I:17943;3654;Heath Ledger as the Joker was remarkable!
I:17943;3655;"Review for the Blu Ray second disk featurette:This film is truly awesome and since there are just about 300 reviews on here describing how amazing this film is I wanted to stray away from reviewing the movie and write a little bit about the special feature: ""Batman Unmasked"" and how great and interesting this short documentary was."
I:17943;3656;if you are as interested in the villains Batman has as much as I am, you will know they are a central part of how successful The Dark Knight has become since his creation over 70 years ago.
I:17943;3657;The Joker and The Riddler are some of the most interesting villains they discuss.
I:17943;3658;Heath Ledger's absolutely amazing performance as The Joker reminds us how amazingly cynical the character is.
I:17943;3659;batman is very interestingly compared to Theodore Roosevelt who had a similar life style to that of Bruce Wayne.
I:17943;3660;It's got the same feel to it as a well done History or Discovery Channel documentary!
I:17943;3661;Seen this movie on IMAX, the Blu.
I:17943;3662;ray version just as good.
I:17943;3663;He encounters obstacles along the way but has the guidance, in this story, of two Wise Old Men.
I:17943;3664;The Dark Knight is the ongoing story of one Hero.
I:17943;3665;Although the two don't work together, they do respect what the other does.
I:17943;3666;on the other hand, the Wise Old Men educate and influence Batman/Bruce.
I:17943;3667;He tells a story of his youth in which a villain is caught.
I:17943;3668;winning performance as the Joker, the wild card, the chaos factor.
I:17943;3669;Only an excellent actor can move through heavy make.
I:17943;3670;It is definitely fodder for debate.
I:17943;3671;The movie was always worth watching again and again.
I:17943;3672;Always a good movie to watch.
I:17943;3673;The Dark Knight is proof positive that a great movie can be made based off of comic book source material.
I:17943;3674;The Dark Knight continues in that tradition and ups the ante ten.
I:17943;3675;notch acting and story, and great musical score (by the always great Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard).
I:17943;3676;Will Batman be able to do everything possible (and then some) to counter the Joker?
I:17943;3677;For a minute, I forgot who the director was, as I had to swear it was Sam Raimi.
I:17943;3678;The other being, Rachel Dawes character is so one.
I:17943;3679;The subsequent events also caused me to feel a bit conflicted as to the resolution an ultimate ending of the movie.
I:17943;3680;The story, acting, music, and special effects are all top.
I:17943;3681;notch (Chicago makes a great setting for Gotham).
I:17943;3682;This is the Dark Knight as he was intended to be and I can only hope that there is a third one, as good as this one and Batman Begins.
I:17943;3683;Chris Nolan delivers a perfect follow.
I:17943;3684;ledger's performance as the Joker was brilliant!
I:17943;3685;His psychosis deepens, yet he has goals and monumental methods.
I:17943;3686;While he shows some underlying humor, he is spot.
I:17943;3687;in the middle of the struggle, is both Rachel Dawes, Bruces' lifelong friend and love, and Harvey Dent.
I:17943;3688;Batman considers folding the cape for good as he believes in Dent's honor.
I:17943;3689;But this is a very dark and gritty film from the Frank Miller storyline.
I:17943;3690;Telling lies about his facial scars, the Joker is believable about every lie.
I:17943;3691;now Commissioner Gordon, Gary Oldman continues to maintain his belief that Batman is attempting to bring justice to Gotham.
I:17943;3692;Oldman is a fantastic actor with a career of award winning performances!
I:17943;3693;He keeps Commissioner Gordon humble, just, honorable and quirky.
I:17943;3694;Most of all, faithful to the character in true form.
I:17943;3695;An old fashioned cop with values and principals, he is a family man first and foremost.
I:17943;3696;With Gordon's son watching, Batman makes his final moral choice.
I:17943;3697;Because he and Gordon know Batman stand for something greater.
I:17943;3698;Morality, ethical values and a stance for justice.
I:17943;3699;"For the time being, Gotham will see Batman as the ""Ultimate Outsider."
I:17943;3700;A man with serious, unresolved issues, who seeks shelter and comfort under a cowl.
I:17943;3701;The Joker symbolized, with stylized elegance, how little attention is paid to mentally disturbed.
I:17943;3702;An adaptation based on some hard.
I:17943;3703;core Dark Knight graphic novels that were best sellers!
I:17943;3704;By far, these first two films (and The Dark Knight Rises) are the best trilogy of any Superhero or anti.
I:17943;3705;Nolan's vision for Gotham City's dark hero was grounded in a more realistic world than the previous four movies had been, gone was the camp and unnecessary nipples on the batsuit from Schumacher's version, and in was an authentic, true to the comic book interpretation of the brooding hero, complete with darker villains, much more realistic weapons and gadgets, and some of the best acting and storytelling of any of the Bat's incarnations this side of its comic book origins.
I:17943;3706;"Now, here we are in 2008, and the anxiously anticipated sequel has been released and let me tell you ""The Dark Knight"" definitely delivers, successfully building upon the outstanding groundwork that had been laid by ""Batman Begins"" and going beyond my own, and many others, expectations to create an awesome experience at the movies."
I:17943;3707;"The Dark Knight is one of the best comic book inspired movies ever put in front of a camera
I:17943;3708;"Sure, the movie features characters that are somewhat larger than life, and the main character dresses himself up in a batsuit
I:17943;3709;"Gaining respect and acclaim from critics all throughout Hollywood, a new concept for most comic book inspired creations, ""The Dark Knight"" may possibly be the first of its kind to be viewed more as a respected mainstream action/drama than just another comic book movie."
I:17943;3710;"the screenplay for ""The Dark Knight"" as crafted by director Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan, based on a story by Christopher and David S. Goyer (writer of the `Blade' franchise), is an excellent follow."
I:17943;3711;"up to the terrific work this team of talented individuals had done with ""Batman Begins""."
I:17943;3712;The story is so full of intensity, twists and turns, and a hefty dose of the unexpected, that you really need to see the movie more than once in order to fully appreciate all of the various elements that comprise this entertaining slice of pop culture.
I:17943;3713;the talented cast assembled for this movie is such an incredible ensemble of Hollywood's A. list that it's amazing the story was capable of giving the appropriate amount of attention to them all without some getting lost in the shuffle.
I:17943;3714;Christian Bale delivers what is easily the best portrayal of the duality of Bruce Wayne/Batman, expertly playing the opposing nature the character has with his playboy lifestyle as Bruce Wayne, compared to the intensity and violence that consumes his life as the Batman.
I:17943;3715;"From every facial tick, to the trademark laugh, to his odd pattern of speech, everything about this character is spot on
I:17943;3716;The Dark Knight is, as I said earlier, one of the best comic book adaptations, if not the best (in my opinion), and may also be viewed as more of a crime thriller than a comic book movie.
I:17943;3717;Comprised of intense storytelling (much more so than any of its predecessors), excellent acting, white knuckle action sequences, and numerous twists, turns, and surprises that will leave you begging for more as the credits begin to roll.
I:17943;3718;Ledger did an amazing job.
I:17943;3719;He completely stole the show.
I:17943;3720;Christopher Nolan has a vision.
I:17943;3721;He makes it plausible, possible.
I:17943;3722;And yet there's more to it: just as 'Begins' was a dissection of myth, the nature of symbols and heroes, 'Knight' is the escalation of that notion.
I:17943;3723;defined but that is relative to a viewpoint.
I:17943;3724;guys, and as such something so unnervingly.
I:17943;3725;"It doesn't waste a scene or moment
I:17943;3726;'The Dark Knight' tells a story worth telling and it takes the proper amount of time to tell it.
I:17943;3727;grabbing stunts (vastly superior to 'Begins') and in their chaotic intensity we see that they serve purpose to the story, yet more interesting are not played for pure entertainment.
I:17943;3728;unpredictable story (it packs many a shock), that makes us think and more importantly gains our emotional.
I:17943;3729;We come to care for the characters, because they are believable, developed, and personified fully.
I:17943;3730;Maggie Gyllenhal is a more mature Rachel Dawes than Katie Holmes.
I:17943;3731;wearied lawman with such honest.
I:17943;3732;The irreplaceable Michael Caine makes a gentle, reassuring, father.
I:17943;3733;He makes his presence known, whether he's playing on the easy.
I:17943;3734;going charisma of Gotham's 'White.
I:17943;3735;He captures both facets of each personality flawlessly.
I:17943;3736;Admittedly, his development is not as grand as in 'Begins' (yet that film gave us such a good psychoanalysis of Wayne, we hardly need more), yet what Bale pulls off is admirable.
I:17943;3737;"Even when Wayne is acting as a frivolous playboy for the public, every now and then Bale offers us a powerful glance that reminds us its all a faade
I:17943;3738;Mr. Ledger had proved with 'Brokeback Mountain' he could deliver a potent performance.
I:17943;3739;: I see the significance of his loss.
I:17943;3740;like tone that sends shivers down the spine.
I:17943;3741;His face is completely splattered with makeup that renders him both freakishly.
I:17943;3742;Heath never hams the role up or goes for something cheap: he delivers a fully.
I:17943;3743;immersed display of psychotic madness.
I:17943;3744;"The movie writes the character brilliantly
I:17943;3745;'The Dark Knight' has had an incredible.
I:17943;3746;It becomes something much richer than a super.
I:17943;3747;Christopher Nolan has opened a new door in cinema: allowing action.
I:17943;3748;He has transformed this into a piece of artwork, full of beauty, terror, moral.
I:17943;3749;One of the best movies of all time!
I:17943;3750;But definitely a good way for WB to market the product to the fans!
I:17943;3751;I love it love it!!
I:17943;3752;just be careful with handling, you always packed it in a rush.
I:17943;3753;Not too sure but this installment of Batman was great and the Joker was phenomenal!
I:17943;3754;This film is Christopher Nolan's masterpiece.
I:17943;3755;The layers and subtext to each of the characters, settings, and plot lines were amazing.
I:17943;3756;When I think of great movies, this one is near the top.
I:17943;3757;Wonderful performances by a great cast.
I:17943;3758;A memorial of some kind to Heath Ledger.
I:17943;3759;the first thing is that I always felt this film would be even better if it was rated R.
I:17943;3760;Second, this was the best movie of 2008 and one of the best films I've ever seen in my life, period.
I:17943;3761;I saw it three times in theaters, twice on opening weekend and once on IMAX.
I:17943;3762;feature on the creation of The Joker's signature two.
I:17943;3763;The trailers for this movie were terrific, and it's nice to finally see a studio include a great trailer with a great movie.
I:17943;3764;"and the bestest most hilariously insightfully imaginative wonderful extra of all is the collection of ""Gotham Tonight"" clips."
I:17943;3765;The fictional show we caught snippets of during the film takes us in real time from the events of Batman Begins to the events of this movie, creating an entire world in the space of forty minutes thanks to savvy writing and some fantastic acting.
I:17943;3766;Seeing so much of him makes it personal and wrenching when he winds up becoming one of The Joker's unwilling victims.
I:17943;3767;"(Great lines include: ""A man with six fingers is strange, Mike."
I:17943;3768;to get a kick out of these pieces, but it sure helps.
I:17943;3769;"Some of what we learn is silly (One of Dent's supporters is working on a musical about his life called ""The White Knight""!)"
I:17943;3770;but it also inspires sobering thoughts.
I:17943;3771;even the packaging on this set won me over.
I:17943;3772;well, the movie speaks for itself.
I:17943;3773;Do yourself a favor, and let it speak to you.
I:17943;3774;To give you a context for my remarks, know that I love movies, almost without regard to genre.
I:17943;3775;A good movie stands on its own merits.
I:17943;3776;I liked Batman Begins quite a lot, and I loved Iron Man.
I:17943;3777;I loved the Operation Skyhook scene and only one other that I can't now recall.
I:17943;3778;as always, Morgan Freeman and Michael Cain are wonderful, and I like Gary Oldman, although he's only around briefly.
I:17943;3779;"fi/fantasy to enjoy the ""Dark Knight""."
I:17943;3780;Myself and my sons have completely enjoyed this flick.
I:17943;3781;The price point was fantastic as well.
I:17943;3782;All of the action in it was amazing.
I:17943;3783;he pulled the right cord each time.
I:17943;3784;His idea, concept and vision of Batman and Gotham is outstanding .
I:17943;3785;In the Dark Knight Nolan really dived deep and explored the dark side.
I:17943;3786;the visuals of the film are breath taking.
I:17943;3787;One of my favorite movies!
I:17943;3788;The whole series is great and the director and actors did a really excellent job!
I:17943;3789;I got the product in amazing time and in great condition.
I:17943;3790;I would recommend it to anyone.
I:17943;3791;It was a present and they really enjoyed watching it again.
I:17943;3792;I really liked this version of Batman and just intend to keep up with the storyline if they should decide to put out any further films with other villians!??
I:17943;3793;Said it was the best so far.
I:17943;3794;The condition of the movie came out great.
I:17943;3795;I will be able to tell you how the actual condition of the viewing of the movie was when I actually watch it.
I:17943;3796;stop action, it was intense!
I:17943;3797;Mighty fine support actors include Michael Kane and Morgan Freeman.
I:17943;3798;on movie and at the same time, stands on its own.
I:17943;3799;There is enough action, twists and turns that your head just spins.
I:17943;3800;If you haven't seen Batman Begins, no worries, because the director, Chris Nolan, has done a wonderful job of catching the audience up to speed.
I:17943;3801;They come later, and when they do, your heart will be beating a mile a minute.
I:17943;3802;there is a new District Attorney in town and he is Harvey Dent who is a good guy, deep down to his core.
I:17943;3803;Batman is going to have quite the wake up call because The Joker will shake up the order of things in ways you will not see coming.
I:17943;3804;Others will turn and look the other way if he has to kill or cause his own chaos to save Gotham.
I:17943;3805;That is the main question asked and with the end of The Dark Knight, and future installments of this Batman series, this moral dilemma will be the main focus and a foreshadowing of things to come.
I:17943;3806;visually, The Dark Knight is perfect, but the most important reason to go see a movie such as this, even if you are not a fan of superheroes or comic book action, is the acting.
I:17943;3807;"Forget about Michael Keaton
I:17943;3808;I had hoped the direction of what Batman has to become would be a darker and more unstable individual, and Christian has tapped into Batman's psyche wonderfully.
I:17943;3809;He even outshined Christian in a few scenes.
I:17943;3810;last but not least, and I purposely saved the best for last is Heath Ledger.
I:17943;3811;What an incredible way to leave this Earth and on such a high note.
I:17943;3812;But those thirty minutes show a true master at work.
I:17943;3813;Heath has done so with The Joker.
I:17943;3814;I have only touched upon a small part of why The Dark Knight is such a wonderful viewing experience.
I:17943;3815;Some may this movie success lies because of the skills of director and his players.
I:17943;3816;i say this is a fine movie by people who know what they are doing.
I:17943;3817;My favorite movie of the trilogy for sure.
I:17943;3818;I just love amazon instant watch.
I:17943;3819;So much better than netflix.
I:17943;3820;It was a gift for my grandson, the movie was great worthy it's five stars.
I:17943;3821;It was Heath Leadger's last and best movie,{ a must see for his fans and all Batman fans},.
I:17943;3822;I myself enjoyed the movie as well as my 14 yr old grandson.
I:17943;3823;This movie brings you up to the point of what Batman has endured and still endures to save Gotham City, enjoy it for yourselfs.
I:17943;3824;Personally I love this movie and I'm not like a super fan of batman.
I:17943;3825;My boyfriend loves watching movie extras and the extras on this movie are amazing.
I:17943;3826;It's one of those movies that sticks in your head.
I:17943;3827;He would have had a right to be proud.
I:17943;3828;"invented and brilliantly
I:17943;3829;Also, another thing that sets The Dark Knight apart from most other superhero movies, and even most fiction, is the smooth way everything flows and seems so easy to believe.
I:17943;3830;And still they managed to pose some interesting questions concerning Batman's morality, sense of justice, and the possible overall impact of his very existence(batmen with machine guns, anyone?)
I:17943;3831;"I personally did not like this movie at all, but my boyfriend loved it and I know a ton of people love it so much, that it just won many awards at the People Choice Awards 2009, and one of them including ""best movie""."
I:17943;3832;A lot of parts in it you can tell are super fake.
I:17943;3833;And I love most movies like this, yet I never have liked ANY batman movies ever.
I:17943;3834;i'm a HUGE fan of The Batman, with boxes upon boxes of old comics in the closet, and a hard.
I:17943;3835;It's still a great movie.
I:17943;3836;And those associated with it and the previous Batman Begins have breathed new life into a franchise that Tim Burton, et.
I:17943;3837;This is one of the best movies I've ever seen and that can keep my attention throughout its entirety.
I:17943;3838;It's lengthy, but it's worth it and its entertainment value is very high.
I:17943;3839;up to his first Batman film,Batman Begins.
I:17943;3840;Nolan has made a dark and real character out of Batman, kind of like writerFrank Millerdid with Batman in the comic books.
I:17943;3841;time friend Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal).
I:17943;3842;it is very important to note that the cast here is very strong.
I:17943;3843;Bale is great again as Batman and Bruce Wayne.
I:17943;3844;Eckhart is a pleasant surprise as Dent and shows remarkable depth.
I:17943;3845;Gyllenhaal is taking over for Katie Holmes in the role of Dawes and she is definitely a more compelling performer.
I:17943;3846;All three actors are without question among the best at their craft and deliver effectively here.
I:17943;3847;He is the best film villain since Hannibal Lecter and if Ledger weren't dead I would be waiting to see what he does next.
I:17943;3848;"i don't want to play my excitement while seeing this film down one iota
I:17943;3849;Typical Batman movie, Absolutely terrific and non.
I:17943;3850;Acting and screenplay are awesome, as is the sound effects.
I:17943;3851;The Dark Knight is a masterpiece movie.
I:17943;3852;Christian Bale owns it as Batman/Bruce Wayne and again does a phenominal job.
I:17943;3853;In Batman Begins he was good, in The Dark Knight he is better.
I:17943;3854;Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent is incredible.
I:17943;3855;Harvey shows us how one set of events can completely change us and our outlook on life.
I:17943;3856;Gary Oldman returns as Commisioner Gordon, a cop who is not corrupted and who is good at heart.
I:17943;3857;He is a great asset to Batman/Bruce Wayne.
I:17943;3858;In my opinion, it made Rachael a more compassionate and relatable character.
I:17943;3859;Heath Ledger as The Joker has to be one of the most memorable villains of this century.
I:17943;3860;Heath is normally the hero or love interest.
I:17943;3861;Oh, he is in it alright!
I:17943;3862;The Dark Knight has action for the guys, love story for the girls, and a story for everybody else.
I:17943;3863;This movie is a must have for comic book fans to put in their collection and for anybody who wants to watch an example of an Oscar worthy movie!
I:17943;3864;It is so easy and reliable.
I:17943;3865;This has to be the most overrated movie of all.
I:17943;3866;If you want true entertainment check out some films by the great director Uwe Boll.
I:17943;3867;Excellent Movie a little on the long side but full of action keeps viewers on their toes.
I:17943;3868;this is another great movie for the family to enjoy on movie night.
I:17943;3869;Our family loves them all so I highly recommend this one.
I:17943;3870;"If Hollywood remained merely the entertainment capital of the world, as it once was, vice trying so hard to be a political messenger, then ""The Dark Knight"" would have received an Oscar nomination for movie of the year and Christopher Nolan would have won director of the year."
I:17943;3871;"In fact, let's try hard and remember than in an era where entertainment mattered enough for ""Ben Hur"" to win, perhaps we're short changing this movie against it earning the top Oscar!As others have witnessed, this movie transcends the comic hero movie in the same way that ""The Lord of the Rings"" transcended fantasy."
I:17943;3872;It reaches a depth of emotion and reveals deep human psychology of the sociopathic mindset.
I:17943;3873;but this movie offered so much more.
I:17943;3874;Nolan proves again he's a director who cares about getting facts right.
I:17943;3875;Just one example proves the point.
I:17943;3876;The movie uses what many considered a fanciful method of extracting Batman and a corrupt Chinese executive from an office high rise to a C.130 aircraft.
I:17943;3877;Nolan appreciates the facts enough to get them right in the movie, including such details as getting the lights on the cable and balloon accurate.
I:17943;3878;the Joker finds everyone's button and presses them with eager amusement.
I:17943;3879;the movie is filled with such delicate yet powerful sub.
I:17943;3880;In fact the movie is effective because it masterfully blends transcending human traits into tight storytelling, filled with raw entertainment.
I:17943;3881;These features are so well produced that it must have torn the hearts out of the movie's creators to leave them largely on the cutting room floor.
I:17943;3882;there are stories worthy of pure message telling.
I:17943;3883;Schindler's List is a powerful example.
I:17943;3884;It is the skill of the storytelling.
I:17943;3885;The Dark Knight is storytelling at its finest, with a perfect balance of social commentary and human introspection.
I:17943;3886;i liked the batman movie.
I:17943;3887;its an excellent action movie with a lot of action in it.
I:17943;3888;i like the acting a lot, in my opinion, i think heath ledger is so good he is stealing the show.
I:17943;3889;very good acting in the movie.
I:17943;3890;i know what happen to mr ledger and i am sorry, he was a very good actor.
I:17943;3891;For the first time in a blockbuster superhero move, Ledger's Joker gets it right.
I:17943;3892;An intense, dark drama which does justice to the DC comic tradition!
I:17943;3893;I Love this film, Heath Ledger was at his best walking a fine line of insanity.
I:17943;3894;Great cast and the momentum of the film never lags.
I:17943;3895;In this movie the most legendary Batman enemy has come to terrorize the city.
I:17943;3896;Making him choose between the one he loves and the multitude of people in Gotham City.
I:17943;3897;"He has to rely on the help of D. a. ""Two Face"" Harvey Dent to make things right."
I:17943;3898;This is just as good as the first movie in the trilogy if not better.
I:17943;3899;After three years, the darkness returns with a splash.
I:17943;3900;It is a truly memorable movie in all.
I:17943;3901;For the story, it is very good with loads of excitement like how the Joker will make Gotham City in a total mess and destroy the romance relationship between Harvey and Rachel.
I:17943;3902;For the acting, Christian Bale once again proves himself that he can be suitable to play the role of Batman/Bruce Wayne.
I:17943;3903;For the direction, it is good.
I:17943;3904;For the visuals, it is absolutely perfect with no doubts.
I:17943;3905;Compare with the other movies, this is the best among all Batman series.
I:17943;3906;The opening scene pulls you in, and you'll be on the edge of your seat for the next 2 1/2 hours.
I:17943;3907;Good, then maybe you can help me.
I:17943;3908;When Bale is playing Bruce Wayne he talks nearly normal, but when he is the Batman he adopts a deep fuzzy basso voice that makes him sounds more profound.
I:17943;3909;Is this his real voice and the Bruce Wayne one the performance?
I:17943;3910;Gyllenhall otherwise rendered a beautiful performance, and it almost seemed from reel to reel that she had not only watched, but understood, the first picture.
I:17943;3911;Let me say right off the bat that I believe 'Batman Begins' is definitely a superior movie.
I:17943;3912;"I thought to myself, ""I've got to update my audio."
I:17943;3913;All in all this is a blu.
I:17943;3914;"Comes with the movie and the ""Psychology of the Bat"" documentary about the psychological aspects of Batman and various villains."
I:17943;3915;The documentary is wonderful and is the highlight of the product.
I:17943;3916;It is very interesting and provides an in.
I:17943;3917;depth look at the characters of Gotham City.
I:17943;3918;The movie is also an incredible work of cinematic art and both of them combined make for an outstanding experience.
I:17943;3919;If you are a fan of comic book movies, or action movies, this is for you!
I:17943;3920;first, gotham has a 'real city' feel to it this time.
I:17943;3921;The insanity of this character came shining through.
I:17943;3922;What a great adaptation of this villian!
I:17943;3923;This line is much more believable.
I:17943;3924;Instead of having the comic book feel on film, they took the story seriously and presented it to you.
I:17943;3925;sets, costumes, gadgets, plot, acting, music.
I:17943;3926;late teenagers to adults will enjoy this if they like comic book or action movies.
I:17943;3927;"Being one of the few sequals that actually surpass is predecessor, The Dark Knight offers a reflection of the modern world and the problems that plague society
I:17943;3928;Christian Bale is as powerful as ever in his depiction as the Cape Crusader and brings the intensity of DC best creation to life.
I:17943;3929;Morgan Freeman and Michael Cane undoubtedly bring life to the supporting characters that aid the hero in this film.
I:17943;3930;Maggie Gyllenhaal brings more believability to Rachel Dawes than did Katie Holmes.
I:17943;3931;Also this film does a excellent job of reflecting the modern world with all of its problems.
I:17943;3932;A heartless, maniacal, lethal and much.
I:17943;3933;Gyllenhaal brings a much more believable performance to the screen.
I:17943;3934;She's torn between two men that she legitimately loves.
I:17943;3935;One is Bruce Wayne and the other is Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart).
I:17943;3936;eckhart hasn't received much publicity for his role in this film when compared to another newcomer, but he is just as brilliant in the role of Dent.
I:17943;3937;He's one of the more sympathetic characters in the film, and he rides an emotional rollercoaster throughout this story.
I:17943;3938;All of the hype is true.
I:17943;3939;He makes you forget that this film is based on a comic book series that features a man in a batsuit and his boyish sidekick in red and yellow.
I:17943;3940;He's also quite hilarious in a sadistic way.
I:17943;3941;the film also features a number of other film and television stars in lesser roles.
I:17943;3942;There are also a number of surprises in this film.
I:17943;3943;Part of me wished that the film had gone ahead with an R. rated release, but don't let that keep you from watching this film.
I:17943;3944;It's excellent, and I highly recommend it.
I:17943;3945;Good lord is this every an amazingly good movie.
I:17943;3946;Its as good as the Godfather and that is saying something.
I:17943;3947;The movie was full of action.
I:17943;3948;The joker was great, performed by Heath Ledger (may his soul rest in peace), however here are my remarks about the movie:.
I:17943;3949;His tactics and plans were amazing, I got to salute him.
I:17943;3950;book movies should be fun and exciting.
I:17943;3951;Give me the Spiderman and X. men type stuff any day.
I:17943;3952;Memento was incredibly fantastic though.
I:17943;3953;A very good movie if you like this kind of unbelievable action.
I:17943;3954;The joker did a fantastic job in his role.
I:17943;3955;The contents were completely without moreConfiguration was good.
I:17943;3956;hey, intervideo is the best teacherHope you have had this happen.
I:17943;3957;This is a movie everyone should see.
I:17943;3958;Action packed and great performances.
I:17943;3959;It is bested seen on the big screen because it is one of thosebig movies that make movie screens come alive.
I:17943;3960;It is also an intense movie on the TV screen screen as well.
I:17943;3961;I did enjoy Batman Begins but it certainly doesnt rank as an all.
I:17943;3962;time masterpiece of cinema in my book.
I:17943;3963;The film, in general, is just amazing.
I:17943;3964;This movie is really good.
I:17943;3965;I recommend this movie being in everyone's blu ray collection.
I:17943;3966;There is a ton of action and lots of great acting such as The Joker's role.
I:17943;3967;The world presented in The Dark Knight is fantasy in more ways than one.
I:17943;3968;the strength of this movie is in Heath Leger's portrayal of the Joker as an agent of chaos and somehow also as a super master.
I:17943;3969;The completely unbelievable, or at least the unlikely, is made believable and realistic.
I:17943;3970;i see why people liked Batman Begins.
I:17943;3971;This has been the best Batman movie I guess.
I:17943;3972;I must say I liked the original series and original campy movie more than all of the Batman movies since I think.
I:17943;3973;A lot of great, legendary movies do have one scene in them that's a bit far.
I:17943;3974;In Steven Spielberg's, ET, it's when the young boy's bicycle begins to fly.
I:17943;3975;"Highly recommended to order from Amazon as a ""supplier/seller""."
I:17943;3976;Hello this trilogy is the best trilogy since the original Star Wars!
I:17943;3977;So many talented actors made this movie so awesome.
I:17943;3978;The directing is even better from Christopher Nolan, he understands the necessary way to go about a superhero movie like no one else.
I:17943;3979;You have two major character arcs in this story (Batman's limits to bring justice and Harvey Dent's descent to evil) as well as over four major villains and it is still able to be handled with ease.
I:17943;3980;Christian Bale not only plays the Bruce Wayne that Gotham sees him as, but he is also its greatest detective and justice breeder.
I:17943;3981;"Then there is also the ""real"" Bruce Wayne."
I:17943;3982;aaron Eckhart also does a great job of playing multiple roles because he is so believable as the well mannered District Attorney and also as the psychotic killer that is Two.
I:17943;3983;Heath Ledger was a perfect Joker and I feel like it got the praise it warranted, but I feel all three leads deserved just as much recognition.
I:17943;3984;This movie excels in every genre it approaches.
I:17943;3985;As a comic book movie it stays really true to the Long Halloween and Dark Victory storyline.
I:17943;3986;As a drama it shows a number of clear character arcs and sees them through.
I:17943;3987;man or Superman ever end up having to make, a life or an ideal.
I:17943;3988;This builds on everything set up in Batman Begins, making it arguably the greatest sequel of all time.
I:17943;3989;As of 2013, The Dark Knight is so Christopher Nolan's last best film.
I:17943;3990;I had to keep reminding my self that this was a comic book movie.
I:17943;3991;It had a great story that made you think and stayed with you.
I:17943;3992;Heath Ledger was 100% perfict as the joker, one of the best preforminces I have ever seen.
I:17943;3993;With the exaption of Maggie Gyllenhaal I thought the rest of cast was great.
I:17943;3994;ray the picture and sound are top grade.
I:17943;3995;This was the best batman movie I have ever seen and for me easly the best movie of the year.
I:17943;3996;R. i. p Heath Ledger thank you for your work.
I:17943;3997;Really well done and the acting is great!
I:17943;3998;They say this is the most anticipated movie of 2008.
I:17943;3999;Critics say The Dark Knight is a masterpiece.
I:17943;4000;And they are absolutely 100% right.
I:17943;4001;me and my family went to the movies early today at 11:10 am to go see the anticipated movie : The Dark Knight.
I:17943;4002;First, they knew one of the best movies was starting.
I:17943;4003;The action was a lot better than Batman Begins.
I:17943;4004;face did look cool and I'm glad he brought his coin along.
I:17943;4005;Everyone from the last Batman film came back with even more sparks and passion.
I:17943;4006;They all seem so real with there character.
I:17943;4007;i definitely recommend this movie.
I:17943;4008;It is one of the greatest movies of all time.
I:17943;4009;Go for it if you like this movie.
I:17943;4010;"this is a superhero movie that isn't cartoonish or childish
I:17943;4011;Heath Ledger plays the deranged Joker with frightening delight and I couldn't take my eyes off him.
I:17943;4012;Ledger really found his niche as a super.
I:17943;4013;Christian Bale is fine, if somewhat bland, as Batman, while Aaron Eckhart shines as the heroic district attorney.
I:17943;4014;"It's fun to see Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman as Batman's confidants
I:17943;4015;The script is literate and even noble and it really is the best Batman movie I've seen.
I:17943;4016;Being a long time comic book and movie fan, this is the only movie in recent memory that I can honestly say was worth the price of admission.
I:17943;4017;It surprised me, it shocked me, and made me laugh.
I:17943;4018;But I hope they do.
I:17943;4019;This movie was very well written, the acting was well done.
I:17943;4020;But it was Heath Ledger's performance that made it exciting to watch.
I:17943;4021;He really deserved credit for this movie big time.
I:17943;4022;The Dark Knight is brilliant!
I:17943;4023;the cast led by Christian Bale (excellent as usual in his returning role as Bruce Wayne / Batman), Two.
I:17943;4024;time Oscar winner Michael Caine (also returning as Alfred Pennyworth), Oscar.
I:17943;4025;nominated Heath Ledger (brilliant in his final and career.
I:17943;4026;worthy performance as the Joker), Gary Oldman (returning also as Lt. James Gordon), Aaron Eckhart (in an interesting performance as Harvey Dent / Two.
I:17943;4027;"The cinematography by Wally Pfister (who also did the cinematography to ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Prestige"", both were nominated for an Oscar for Best Cinematography, he also did the cinematography to ""The Italian Job"" (2003), ""Insomnia"", and ""Memento"") is brilliant!"
I:17943;4028;"The film editing by Lee Smith (who also did the film editing to ""The Prestige"" and ""Batman Begins"", also did the film editing to ""Master And Commander: The Far Side Of The World"" (2003, which was nominated for an Oscar for Best Film Editing) is excellent!"
I:17943;4029;"The casting by John Papsidera (who also did the casting to ""Memento"", ""Batman Begins"", ""The Prestige"", and the upcoming ""Ghost Town"" (2008) and ""The Informers"" (2008) is brilliant!"
I:17943;4030;"The production design by Nathan Crowley (who also did the production design to ""The Prestige"", for which he was nominated for an Oscar for Best Art Direction, he also did the production design to ""Insomnia"", ""Veronica Guerin"" (2003), ""Batman Begins"", ""The Lake House"" (2006), and the upcoming ""Public Enemies"" (2009) is brilliant!"
I:17943;4031;"The set decoration by Peter Lando (who also did the set decoration to ""The Invisible"" and ""Insomnia"") is brilliant!"

I:17943;4033;This is also the best superhero / comic book movie ever.
I:17943;4034;This is a brilliant, action.
I:17943;4035;packed masterpiece that will keep you entertained.
I:17943;4036;Heath Ledger is brilliant as The Joker and this is another brilliant character he fashioned, brilliantly, of course.
I:17943;4037;This character is one of the best villains, if not, the best, in a movie, since Hannibal Lecter.
I:17943;4038;This movie is great and very much worth the money.
I:17943;4039;And honestly, we thought Iron Man was more all.
I:17943;4040;The Joker is fantastic .
I:17943;4041;He's the most fun to watch.
I:17943;4042;Its one of my favorite movies of all time.
I:17943;4043;Once I started watching these batman movies I got hooked on them.
I:17943;4044;second scene cuts to wow an audience.
I:17943;4045;The Dark Knight shows us how it should be done!
I:17943;4046;What a joy to really see and feel the movie and take in the wonder of each beautifully conceived and shot scene!This movie should be a requirement for any film student!
I:17943;4047;This movie is Freakin Awesome.
I:17943;4048;what a wonderful new age Batman
I:17943;4049;Is this what the creator of Batman intended?Moreover, while the plot of choosing good over evil is admirable, Ifeel that the sub.
I:17943;4050;Sure it's a good ploy for settingup future Batman films, but it's merely setting the stage for more ofthe same old stuff.
I:17943;4051;The Dark Knight is an amazing movie.
I:17943;4052;Nolan seamlessly blends magic, dinosaurs, and occult horror into a film that satisfies on all levels.
I:17943;4053;What he finds is beyond all imagination .
I:17943;4054;tech gadgetry and impressive marksmanship, the t. rex has to vanquish the foe for the good of the universe.
I:17943;4055;impressive on all marks, The Dark Knight is hands.
I:17943;4056;How is this movie rated so high?
I:17943;4057;It was the best batman movie ever.
I:17943;4058;This movie was really good.
I:17943;4059;The biggest improvement was with the addition of the joker and the great job that Heath Ledger did playing the role.
I:17943;4060;Even though I still think Jack Nicholson has a slight edge on him, Heath ledger put up a classic performance.
I:17943;4061;The movie is well written, is packed with action and is enjoyable from beginning to end.
I:17943;4062;I am a big comic fan so I love how the movie stayed true to the relationship between Batman /Joker, and how one can't do without the other in Gotham.
I:17943;4063;Also being a chicago native, I thought it was great to see the many shots of Chi.
I:17943;4064;town as batman fought with his villains.
I:17943;4065;Bottom line treat yourself, don't cheat yourself.
I:17943;4066;This movie is so amazing!
I:17943;4067;Heath Ledger did an amazing job as the Joker.
I:17943;4068;Saw this movie in the theaters and owning it is what I wanted.
I:17943;4069;"worthy"" movie that people like to say it is."
I:17943;4070;the high definition is very.
I:17943;4071;Comes with Digital Copy which is very cool.
I:17943;4072;overall great movie, lots of extra's.
I:17943;4073;No longer do the characters seem extraordinary that we can't believe that they're real.
I:17943;4074;And the best part is that Dark Knight cements this.
I:17943;4075;above all I have to say that the film is most notable in its fine acting.
I:17943;4076;Bale continues to prove that he is a virtuoso actor as the dashing Bruce Wayne and the ever brooding Batman.
I:17943;4077;Gyllenhaal also gives a stellar performance that is far superior to her predecessor (Katie Holmes).
I:17943;4078;Ledger proves he gave his all and possibly is life to bring this legendary villian to the big screen in a superior performance over Nicholson's previous Joker 9 years ago.
I:17943;4079;It is a guarantee that he should receive an Oscar nod.
I:17943;4080;Add a new and successful District Attorney like Dent and the dawn seems to be closer than expected.
I:17943;4081;The Nolans have made a tight, though lengthy story that gives the audience a sense of true morality throughout Gotham that the previous movies have never shown before.
I:17943;4082;Once again Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard have devised a terrific and haunting score that even makes the Joker seem more unnerving.
I:17943;4083;I was impressed by the numerous CGI effects that don't even appear like computer animated images at all and the heavy cinematography and editing.
I:17943;4084;All together this is a great film that has even made history already as the second highest grossing film of all time.
I:17943;4085;Either way I expect great things.
I:17943;4086;This is the best so far in the Batman franchise.
I:17943;4087;It is good, but is very long and as the title indicates, is pretty dark.
I:17943;4088;Heath Ledger is amazing as the Joker.
I:17943;4089;disc Edition)This is one of the best Batman movies I've ever seen.
I:17943;4090;It keeps you on the edge of your seat.
I:17943;4091;The Dark Knight is one of the best movies of the year with $528 million and counting and $992 million worldwide.
I:17943;4092;I know Heath Ledger will win the best Supporting Actor.
I:17943;4093;It has a good chance to go for Best Picture against maybe Wall.
I:17943;4094;e for the big dance.
I:17943;4095;It has to be one of my favorite movies.
I:17943;4096;The acting was the best.
I:17943;4097;Everyone told me it was really dark, but I really liked it.
I:17943;4098;i give it a thumbs up!
I:17943;4099;I must say that The Dark Knight is one of the best comic movies to come out on Blu Ray right now.
I:17943;4100;If you ever get a chance though, try the IMAX experience of the film.
I:17943;4101;"At one point in the movie, nearing the end, I was saying to myself, ""My God!"
I:17943;4102;As a showcase for special effects and especially Heath Ledger's amazing performance, this movie is a success.
I:17943;4103;It's gonna be a cult classic .
I:17943;4104;definitely going to be a cult classic, so of course I've got to have it.
I:17943;4105;Plus, it's just a darn good movie!
I:17943;4106;Gotta love a good BatMan movie with all the action and all.
I:17943;4107;This movie shows that all heroes at every level of life pay a price for all of us which perhaps is what really and truly makes them a hero in the first place.
I:17943;4108;As I watched it again I couldn't help but think what a huge loss Heath Ledger is to actors and those that appreciate a truly good performance.
I:17943;4109;Christian Bale, Gary Oldman, and Michael Caine are of course superb but we knew they would be from their performances in Batman Begins.
I:17943;4110;Ledger was a delight and a surprise.
I:17943;4111;For those of you that also remember the old ones, you will find the ending as shocking as I did!
I:17943;4112;Action packed and exciting good movie that will keep you awake by all means this one turns to be one hell of an adventure!!!
I:17943;4113;moral issues between good and evil create a finer line for Batman to operate within.
I:17943;4114;After seeing it for the second time, I can confidently say that The Dark Knight is the smartest, most realistic, and best superhero movie out there.
I:17943;4115;Undeniably, the movie of summer '08 and possibly of this year.
I:17943;4116;If there's one movie you see this summer, it'd damn better The Dark Knight.
I:17943;4117;the Dark Knight's storytelling is definitely one of its highlights that distinguish it from the dozens of others in its genre .
I:17943;4118;it's downright gritty and serious.
I:17943;4119;hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard present the perfect music score for Dark Knight.
I:17943;4120;The music that accompanies the film is mostly orchestral but there's just enough synthesized elements, such as the vigorous suspenseful buzzing.
I:17943;4121;last but not least is the amazing casting.
I:17943;4122;Christian Bale makes a solid Bruce Wayne and Batman.
I:17943;4123;The lovely Maggie Gyllenhaal breathes more life into her character Rachel Dawes than Katie Holmes could into Tom Cruise's career.
I:17943;4124;Thank You For Smocking's confident Aaron Eckhart as District Attorney Harvey Dent will make you believe in him because it's just fine acting.
I:17943;4125;Christopher Nolan has taken superhero and comic book movies to new heights and maturity.
I:17943;4126;He's going to get nominated for director and with his brother Jonathan, the screenplay.
I:17943;4127;Fantasy fans had Return of the King.
I:17943;4128;ONLY if it is as capable and intriguing as The Dark Knight has been.
I:17943;4129;I'm a fan of the Dark Knight or the darker Batman characters so this movie was an excellent wrap up to the Dark Knight series.
I:17943;4130;I enjoy the ethical dilemmas that confront Batman in his work .
I:17943;4131;OK i see loots of people crying and bit.
I:17943;4132;first of All Video:I have seen better video but i must tell you the blacks in this movie are superb that makes the whole movie watchable because no matter how black it is is still watchable and it just makes you wait whats the next scene going to be.
I:17943;4133;let me start by saying from the begging to the end i enjoyed every second of it, the sound is so good that for every scene i was thinking that was the best scene until the scene where the hospital blows, the scene with trucks etc. i must say in long long time i haven't enjoyed the movie more than this.
I:17943;4134;of course, that is a possibility I may just entertain considering I did that a few times before The Dark Knight's theatrical release.
I:17943;4135;the certain satisfaction of having that movie in your hands at the store the day it's released.
I:17943;4136;The films that you take great pleasure in introducing to your friends and family.
I:17943;4137;The films that create a world for you to explore and appreciate, a perfect escape from your reality for a couple of hours.
I:17943;4138;I love it when a film is shot with an IMAX camera and put on Blu.
I:17943;4139;I always enjoyed the comic book super heroes.
I:17943;4140;This movie lives up to the comic hero.
I:17943;4141;I liked the characters, the story, and the special effects.
I:17943;4142;We all like to see someone overcome a weakness and find something that elevates them to success while helping innocent bystanders.
I:17943;4143;ray instead and make sure you see the trilogy in order.
I:17943;4144;After hearing so many people enjoyed this movie i got it and watched it at home.
I:17943;4145;The two disc special edition is more than worth the extra cost, loved the movie plus all the extra stuff.
I:17943;4146;Shipping and handling was smooth.
I:17943;4147;After letting this movie digest for a while after all the hype, I thought I could make an honest review to the best of my ability.
I:17943;4148;the MovieI've watched The Dark Knight 4 times now and it still doesn't disappoint.
I:17943;4149;The standout performance obviously is Ledger, in an unforgettable performance that will definitely stay with you days or even weeks after.
I:17943;4150;He has left us with gift and I'm sure his career was only going to get better.
I:17943;4151;"Be of the rich plot and excellent action sequences, TDK is a better movie, but Begins is a better ""Batman"" movie."
I:17943;4152;overall, this is the best movie of the year.
I:17943;4153;good cinematography and an excellent soundtrack with some serious emphasis on LFE made this an easy add for the home theater.
I:17943;4154;probably the best superhero film ever made, with a mesmerizing performance by Heath Ledger as the embodiment of chaotic evil .
I:17943;4155;"pod, one on the evolution of the Joker's ""theme sound"" for the movie soundtrack."
I:17943;4156;"Both are interesting as far as they go, but in the immortal words of another Warner Brothers hero, ""That's all, folks!"""
I:17943;4157;The effect in the theater was interesting .
I:17943;4158;sized widescreen image suddenly exploded into full IMAX.
I:17943;4159;It's NOT IMAX, obviously, so all we're really seeing is how these scenes looked in their original IMAX.
I:17943;4160;The above is *everything* on Disc 2.
I:17943;4161;i share the opinion of many other customer reviewers I've read here .
I:17943;4162;this is clearly a holiday season rip.
I:17943;4163;But Heath's performance is still stellar and does bear repeat viewings.
I:17943;4164;I agree on BB, but feel the main TDK theme is morality.
I:17943;4165;If we want heroism, there's some here and there with Bruce Wayne/Batman, Lucius Fox, Jim Gordon, Rachel Dawes, even Harvey Dent, and even some less important individuals.
I:17943;4166;well, there are other movies or conceivable editions of this one that could help it a lot.
I:17943;4167;the most touching part of the movie for me is the high tragedy of Harvey Dent .
I:17943;4168;The Joker won with Harvey, but lost with Batman and also with enough good citizens of Gotham, including with even some of its criminals.
I:17943;4169;Will Batman weaken and betray his principles?
I:17943;4170;And this brings me to issues I take with TDK, and because of which I'd prefer a greatly cut version.
I:17943;4171;Good recovery of Rachel's character, interest and appeal compared to BEGINS.
I:17943;4172;Heath Ledger is scary, insane, Oscar.
I:17943;4173;This one has very much a James Bond feel to it, in that the plot twists and turns, the hero travels around the world seeking villains and has lots of cool gadgets to play with.
I:17943;4174;the biggest give away is the capture of the international money launderer .
I:17943;4175;, this breaks those boundaries and turns into a true fantasy, where our hero has almost no limits to what he can do .
I:17943;4176;moving thinking JB movies, and taking the stunts and fantasy to an extreme does not bother you, this movie is great.
I:17943;4177;I highly recommend watching this with Batman fans as the Joker is by far the Best of the Villans of any Batman movies.
I:17943;4178;I had never bought a movie for the PSP before but this was a good movie.
I:17943;4179;The small screen will put a lot of people off but it was a new experience.
I:17943;4180;as for the movie itself the Dark Knight was brilliant.
I:17943;4181;Batman's gadgets are cool and Christian Bale does a fine job as Batman not being a typical hero.
I:17943;4182;He is a big time hero and then becomes a villain within minutes.
I:17943;4183;be sure to get this one very good movielots of action.
I:17943;4184;this is one of the best movies of all time!!
I:17943;4185;I'm always like Batman, but the latest movies really do the character some serious credit.
I:17943;4186;Worth it if you have the Blu.
I:17943;4187;Again, Nolan wows audiences and fans with his rewarding re imagining of the caped crusader.
I:17943;4188;The movie features outstanding directing, as with the entire trilogy, and again the a. list cast delivers incredible acting.
I:17943;4189;The true gem of this title, however, is Heath Ledgers revolutionary portrayal of the Joker.
I:17943;4190;His immersion and dedication to the character makes him truly one of the best movie villains and displays how he may be one of the greatest actors of our time.
I:17943;4191;This sequel truly is the best batman movie, Heath Ledger is truly shown to be a fantastic actor, and in truth this movie may be one of the greatest of our time
I:17943;4192;I would say that the Ledger Joker got the personality right and made up it's own history, while the Nicholson Joker went of one of the accepted stories of the Joker's creation.
I:17943;4193;Reguardless of my cons outweighing my pros, it's the best Batman movie I've seen and I do recommend it.
I:17943;4194;Love it, the movie was here on time and my son enjoy it as soon as we got it.
I:17943;4195;I loved this movie, and the blu ray can't get any better!
I:17943;4196;a lot of exclusive footage, cool design and a killer price!
I:17943;4197;take a look at the Blu.
I:17943;4198;But in 2008, how the ache ee double hockey sticks did Batman swoop back into style and become the biggest box office draw of the year and stomp a foothold into world cinema statistics.
I:17943;4199;"everyone has discussed the greatness of Heath Ledger in the role, and it's really sort of incapable of being overstated
I:17943;4200;The Batman trilogy is one of my favorite series.
I:17943;4201;i would recommend it to all mature enough to watch this type of movie: drama with some violence.
I:17943;4202;This is a good movie to own on Blu.
I:17943;4203;The visuals are crystal clear, and even more stunning during the IMAX portions.
I:17943;4204;ray, otherwise it should be rated as the top show for the year 2009.
I:17943;4205;picure/transfer: The Transfer is amazing on Blu Ray.
I:17943;4206;It has great image in colors, framerate, and black images.
I:17943;4207;The suround sound really has a great balance and will summon the cops to your door for a small gang war happening in your living room.
I:17943;4208;These are very nice for a look at how your favorite scenes came to life.
I:17943;4209;In addition, there is some nice BD Live content with downloads and documentrys you can make which are great.
I:17943;4210;"Because we seriously love this blu ray""."
I:17943;4211;The sound is very clear and crispy.
I:17943;4212;We saw the best of it all in the trailers.
I:17943;4213;campy character in a movie full of one.
I:17943;4214;also, Ledger's death boosted both the reception of his performance and the movie sky high.
I:17943;4215;"There are miles and miles of hype, and everyone seems to agree that the ""The Dark Knight"" is the best thing since sliced bread."
I:17943;4216;Loved the movie, arrived on time.
I:17943;4217;This was a very good movie, full of action.
I:17943;4218;My husband and 3 sons thought this was the best movie ever!
I:17943;4219;They especially loved the ending because Batman does the selfless thing and allows people to believe and hope.
I:17943;4220;I highly recommend this movie.
I:17943;4221;It has a lot of food for thought.
I:17943;4222;This movie does not make my job easy, it is well made, well written, well shot, well directed, well acted, everything.
I:17943;4223;It took maybe a half dozen viewings for me to find the few less than perfect spots but even then they are easily forgivable amidst the rest of the beautiful work of art that is this movie.
I:17943;4224;An amazing movie with amazing extras at great price, what more could you want?
I:17943;4225;It's my favorite in the trilogy.
I:17943;4226;Great film as we all know.
I:17943;4227;Ledger does a fantastic performance as the Joker and provides some wry jokes as he devils his victims.
I:17943;4228;one step in front of the Police.
I:17943;4229;Maggie Gyllenhaal plays the role of Rachel Dawes and Dent and Batman both love her.
I:17943;4230;There are plenty of action sequences and the special effects .
I:17943;4231;The film is dark but the artistic sets and cinema is excellent.
I:17943;4232;The Joker was the best character in the movie!
I:17943;4233;The product was in its original packaging and in great condition when arrived.
I:17943;4234;If you like this genre, you will like this movie.
I:17943;4235;Personally, I don't care for it, but it was a gift and the person receiving it thought it was great!
I:17943;4236;I found the best price on Amazon, plus they discounted it before it was sent, and passed the savings on to me!
I:17943;4237;Great twist to and old hero.
I:17943;4238;My boys loved it and the service and availability through AMazon was AWESOME!
I:17943;4239;Recieved in excellent condition with speedy delivery.
I:17943;4240;This visually and conceptually dark film tortures the viewer with eye.
I:17943;4241;I definitely loved the movie.
I:17943;4242;christoper Nolan is a spectacular writer, producer, and director.
I:17943;4243;pretty much anything he puts out is worth watching.
I:17943;4244;great visuals, beautiful environments, great dialogue, pretty solid.
I:17943;4245;definitely a movie to be watched by all.
I:17943;4246;This is with no doubt one of the best movies i have ever seen i my whole life.
I:17943;4247;Here is a funny quiz about it [.]
I:17943;4248;The Dark Knight has something so special about it, and for me, that lies within Heath Ledger's final role as The Joker.
I:17943;4249;indeed, that is where the charm is with this film.
I:17943;4250;Heath Ledger pretty much carries this whole film on his back, delivering what I can honestly say is one of the most chilling, accurate, and breathtaking performances I have ever seen in my life.
I:17943;4251;There is something so real about The Joker, and it's hard to believe that this man is not real, because that is the spirit that Ledger brought to the role.
I:17943;4252;Bale brings such a depth of realism to Batman and to his alter ego Bruce Wayne.
I:17943;4253;aaron Eckhart is more than worthy of mention here as well.
I:17943;4254;His performance as Harvey Dent was certainly a much.
I:17943;4255;Gotham needed a White Knight, and they got him in what could easily be described as his best performance yet.
I:17943;4256;the rest of the cast is excellent, as always, most notable Maggie Gyllenhaal filling in for the absent Katie Holmes.
I:17943;4257;She didn't have very big shoes to fill for this one, considering that Katie Holmes can't act her way out of a paper bag, but Maggie did excellent with what little she had to work with.
I:17943;4258;Nolan proved himself more than capable with his first stab at DCs' iconic hero, and has again made the case that he should be the only director allowed near the Batman universe.
I:17943;4259;His minimal use of CG, the excellent script and stuntwork alone make his Dark Knight definitive, but it is his work with the actors and their dialogue that make this a special film.
I:17943;4260;The photography coupled with a complex and involving screenplay that wrings every bit of character development possible out of everyone involved leaves the viewer slightly out of breath and awed by the end of this truly spectacular summer movie event.
I:17943;4261;No digital blur here, and no flies either just spectacular performances (Oldman, Ledger, Eckhart) and a truly fufilling cinematic Batman experience.
I:17943;4262;Stellar performances by a stellar cast,and a great script.
I:17943;4263;"ledger's""Joker"" is nuanced, mesmerizing and frightening."
I:17943;4264;This movie was much better than I thought it would be.
I:17943;4265;The story and characters were interesting and multi.
I:17943;4266;I was really impressed with both Christian Bale and Heath Ledger.
I:17943;4267;The other actors in small roles are wonderful and this is a successful big budget movie.
I:17943;4268;Still the story moves on at an exciting pace.
I:17943;4269;Thought it was a great action movie.
I:17943;4270;This time I actually caught the story line.
I:17943;4271;Everything about this film is genius.
I:17943;4272;From the moment we first see the eternally smiling villain, we are captivated by him, partly because of the way he looks and that he seemingly has no past, and partly because of the downright amazing performance by the ill.
I:17943;4273;Like Mann's 1995 classic, this film has intense scenes of mayhem, violence, and peril, but what really makes them both so great is that they have so much time to breathe, to be calm before the storm.
I:17943;4274;It is in these moments of quiet that hide the real intensity, and what made Nolan's trilogy so suspenseful.
I:17943;4275;bones presentation of the film, with no director's commentary or special features, which is fine.
I:17943;4276;While I do love most of Nolan's special features the single.
I:17943;4277;disc Edition is itself a masterpiece apart from the film).
I:17943;4278;The same fidgeting occurred, breaking into my bonding with the film and intruding into my experience.
I:17943;4279;There is a balance between action and storyline.
I:17943;4280;In his statements, the Joker speaks of his love of chaos.
I:17943;4281;the film was worth seeing.
I:17943;4282;"one final note: As a viewer I applaud Ledger's performance
I:17943;4283;If my suspicions are correct and his performance wins an Oscar, the cost will have been far greater than the limelight or salary he earned.
I:17943;4284;christian Bales, despite what some others believe, has shown himself to be an actor capable of extraordinary depth.
I:17943;4285;But I finally recieved it and it seemed like it was in good condition.
I:17943;4286;It was exciting, clever and fun to watch with the family.
I:17943;4287;"I cannot help but agree with the many critics and viewers who have declared that ""The Dark Knight"" is the best."
I:17943;4288;this is, quite simply, excellent moviemaking, with great characters, unforgettable visuals, and (thank GOD!)
I:17943;4289;a story that actually works.
I:17943;4290;That last element is the one most superhero .
I:17943;4291;christian Bale's Batman is more nuanced and yet more powerful in this sequel.
I:17943;4292;Aaron Eckhart brings true pathos to his depiction of Harvey Dent/Two.
I:17943;4293;"face
I:17943;4294;best of all, though, was Heath Ledger as the Joker.
I:17943;4295;It truly was a performance for the ages .
I:17943;4296;"director Christopher Nolan, whose work I've always liked (see ""Memento"" if you haven't!)"
I:17943;4297;i also agree with those who say the movie is too long .
I:17943;4298;The Dark Knight is an extraordinary experience.
I:17943;4299;Dark Knight is a great movie!
I:17943;4300;I felt this movie had a lot in common with the pathbreaking graphic novel of twenty years ago by Frank Miller.
I:17943;4301;in this movie, we see that brilliant vision brought to the silver screen by Christopher Nolan.
I:17943;4302;With an outstanding cast, a hard.
I:17943;4303;hitting script, great performances all around, and spectacular special effects, it's hard to find a serious flaw anywhere in this cinematic recreation of the classic comic.
I:17943;4304;Oldman is outstanding as the Commissioner (interesting to see him playing a good guy for once), Heath Ledger as the Joker is simply over.
I:17943;4305;top and brilliant, and Christian Bale, although perhaps not my first choice for this type of role, is excellent as Bruce Wayne/Batman.
I:17943;4306;But it's Ledger's role that is clearly the standout.
I:17943;4307;But for me the movie's fast, intense, non.
I:17943;4308;scene development was a joy to watch.
I:17943;4309;It takes superb direction, writing, and editing to get this tight a movie, and all too often action thrillers suffer from too many special effects and not enough intelligent direction, script.
I:17943;4310;the Joker's motivation and character is also interesting.
I:17943;4311;both for law and order and the other high profile criminals in the town.
I:17943;4312;For good to win, a heroic and indefatigable super.
I:17943;4313;i thought this movie was one of the surprises of the whole year.
I:17943;4314;This movie delivers the goods.
I:17943;4315;Batman got even better!The new trilogy and gives back the respect to the Batman series.
I:17943;4316;this movie is even better than the Batman begins , the Joker is a really must see and really deserved the Oscar he got!
I:17943;4317;Batman strikes again as a savior, deep, strong.
I:17943;4318;amazing acting!great flik grab a copy ppl.
I:17943;4319;Chalk up one more to experience.
I:17943;4320;Typical Nolan special features (no deleted scenes), but I still enjoyed what is there, especially the IMAX scenes.
I:17943;4321;the digital copy is quite convenient.
I:17943;4322;clad warlock who's into energyvampirism and satisfies his bloodlust by tacklingenemies that he helped to economically create?
I:17943;4323;Every once in a while a movie comes along that rewrites the dynamics of its genre.
I:17943;4324;Director Christopher Nolan, who wrote the script with his brother, has delivered a powerful examination of the power of fear on a society as well as one of the most riviting crime dramas of all.
I:17943;4325;time and without question the greatest superhero movie ever.
I:17943;4326;"Nolan has given us a staggering masterpiece which has, to quote Ledger's joker ""changed things . . . forever . . . """
I:17943;4327;I never thought that I would enjoy Batman with the Joker again.
I:17943;4328;Jack Nicholson is my favorite actor of all times.
I:17943;4329;The Joker was a Beast, and the movie was truly entertaining, fast paced and I like the motorcylce as well!
I:17943;4330;First, I loved Heath Ledger in this movie.
I:17943;4331;aaron Eckhart's performance was mind.
I:17943;4332;This is my favorite of Nolan's trilogy, and will always be.
I:17943;4333;The Dark Knight has to be one of if not the best Batman movie ever made.
I:17943;4334;A great fast action movie.
I:17943;4335;Bruce Wayne shows that many rich people do very good work that those without the means and money cannot do.
I:17943;4336;A good reminder to America, if we all got justice, we would all be dead.
I:17943;4337;Christopher Nolan is a genius.
I:17943;4338;This is a film that really explores the real batman and who he is as a character.
I:17943;4339;This is more of a psychological film for Batman thanks in part to the Joker played by the wonderful late Heath Ledger.
I:17943;4340;when Ledger was first cast, many wondered how he could top Nicholson's performance.
I:17943;4341;This was the role of his career and one of the best.
I:17943;4342;It is a very, very strong and powerful scene and well done by Bale and Ledger.
I:17943;4343;there's so much going on story wise that it's sometimes hard to keep track of what's what but it does top Begins in every single way possible.
I:17943;4344;He chooses the villains based on the story and based on where Batman is right now.
I:17943;4345;the Dark Knight excels on every level possible that I can go on and on in this review but I won't.
I:17943;4346;I'll just say that The Dark Knight is one of the best movies ever made and should be considered a classic.
I:17943;4347;Great movie, easy to download and watch on my laptop in bed.
I:17943;4348;Heath Ledger steals the movie in his last role.
I:17943;4349;Great story, action and acting.
I:17943;4350;Just saw Dark Knight Rises and I just had to watch The Dark Knight again.
I:17943;4351;It is a much more entertaining film and one of the all time classic comic book movies.
I:17943;4352;Epic performance by Heath Ledger.
I:17943;4353;The Dark Knight is the culmination of all of Bob Kane's work and tireless devotion, to his masterpiece, of comic book genius.
I:17943;4354;On 1/23/09, theaters will start showing this film in IMAX form.
I:17943;4355;What a star for my own private collection!
I:17943;4356;The best movie of the decade deserved a wonderfull setup, and this is the best I could imagine.
I:17943;4357;The batpod looks amazing and the movie is marvelous.
I:17943;4358;"From start to finish I was mesmerized and surprised it did so
I:17943;4359;I've been in love with Batman since the animated series came out in the 1990's on the old Cartoon Network.
I:17943;4360;This movie to me is amazing beyond words or entertaining at its best.
I:17943;4361;Now this movie is NOT suitable for you to watch it along with your five year old nephew.
I:17943;4362;why I love this movie so much?
I:17943;4363;Because it has everything that reminds me of the animated series except it's more realistic, mature and darker.
I:17943;4364;"he's a villian duh
I:17943;4365;He even won an Academy Award for Pete's sake.
I:17943;4366;This is a really great movie, keeping on with the actual theme of the comics not some ridiculous farce that had been made of it before.
I:17943;4367;Keep up with this form.
I:17943;4368;I was excited about Heath Ledger as The Joker, and Christian Bale is one of my favorite actors as well.
I:17943;4369;In the comic books and graphic novels, two.
I:17943;4370;"face ""revenge"" thing was too jammed together to fit it all into this movie."
I:17943;4371;thirdly, and I know the fan.
I:17943;4372;i know its a comic.
I:17943;4373;a bit more screen time for the Scarecrow, perhaps a face to face meeting with the Joker or something would've been nice.
I:17943;4374;now, the good:Heath Ledger's Joker was amazing.
I:17943;4375;When I saw it in the trailers for the movie, I wasnt sure if Nolan could pull it off, but he did, it was a good addition to the franchise.
I:17943;4376;michael Caine, Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman were good as always, although a bit more from Freeman would've been nice.
I:17943;4377;Excellent product and quick delivery.
I:17943;4378;Very satisfied with the care and delivery as well as the item itself.
I:17943;4379;Not the comic book hero, but exciting nonetheless.
I:17943;4380;we will now watch the sequel and see if it continues.
I:17943;4381;True, occasionally I'll find something dark I do enjoy, but that is the rare exception.
I:17943;4382;There's a reason I stick to family entertainment, I truly enjoy it.
I:17943;4383;which is why I was so surprised I enjoyed Batman Begins when it hit the theaters three years ago.
I:17943;4384;Can Batman save the day?The movie started out fine with a few laughs to lighten the mood and an interesting story.
I:17943;4385;Oh, I'll grant you that there was little if any blood.
I:17943;4386;one of the things I enjoyed the most about the last movie was the character development.
I:17943;4387;Potential love interest Rachel Dawes was one of my favorite characters in the first movie.
I:17943;4388;He was brilliant as the Joker.
I:17943;4389;All the praise he has gotten for the part is well deserved.
I:17943;4390;In fact, his acting job earns the movie its second star.
I:17943;4391;The acting, the plot the everything, make this the BEST installment in the series.
I:17943;4392;This is a great movie and a must see along with all the other Batman movies that have come out over the past three to four years.
I:17943;4393;Very exciting and well thought out storyline and cast in this next story of the caped crusader.
I:17943;4394;Although I loved her and Will Farrell in Stranger than Fiction.
I:17943;4395;she was edgy and sarcastic.
I:17943;4396;and paired with Farrell worked well.
I:17943;4397;Probably the biggest upset to date on Superhero pairing.
I:17943;4398;And as the wave of other comic book adaptations came along this summer, I kept telling people to just wait.
I:17943;4399;The best hasn't arrived yet.
I:17943;4400;Well, now it has, and the waiting was worth it.
I:17943;4401;so, I've now seen this film twice.
I:17943;4402;this is that rare film that transcends its own genre, that defies strict classification as any one thing.
I:17943;4403;Yes, it has comic book/superhero origins, but it is so much more than an adaptation of that medium.
I:17943;4404;The cast is a wonder to behold, a true masterstroke.
I:17943;4405;Christian Bale conveys the inherant duality of the title character with equal parts pinache for Bruce Wayne, and determined angst.
I:17943;4406;Gary Oldman, I swear he looks like he's been lifted right from the panels of Frank Miller's iconic story Batman: Year One for the part of Gordon.
I:17943;4407;Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman, well, what else can be said of these two distinguished men who carry their supporting roles with dignity and authority.
I:17943;4408;Aaron Eckhart begins the movie with confidence, and perfectly conveys that steady fall into crazed lunacy as his world is slowly ripped up around him, culminating in his own horrible injury.
I:17943;4409;This is the Joker of recent comic stories.
I:17943;4410;Unpredictable, wholly dedicated to wreaking havoc, and all the while making the reader/viewer feel creeped out one moment, making them laugh the next, and making you hate yourself for laughing in the next instant.
I:17943;4411;This is a performance that truly must be seen and absorbed to be believed.
I:17943;4412;in all the technical areas, this film doesn't disappoint.
I:17943;4413;Repeat viewings are kind of a must, because there are a lot of things that the attentive viewer will notice from one viewing to the next.
I:17943;4414;"This is a movie that will inspire some thought
I:17943;4415;Superhero films represent an area of compromise at our house: I like good ones while my better half generally doesn't bother with them at all.
I:17943;4416;it colored both of our perceptions while watching it during the original release.
I:17943;4417;his performance is electric .
I:17943;4418;nearly two years later I was ready to view The Dark Knight again, and I came away with a new appreciation not only of Ledger's performance, but of the entire film.
I:17943;4419;It is interesting that Ledger completely re.
I:17943;4420;invented a characterization of a role previously blistered by Jack Nicholson.
I:17943;4421;stopping activities, but he also knows that his activities are squarely outside of legal law enforcement.
I:17943;4422;Aaron Eckhart is brilliant as Harvey Dent, an equally rare uncorrupt District Attorney.
I:17943;4423;Dent's willingness to take personal risks combating Gotham City's organized crime figures makes him something of a white knight in the city's consciousness, and Bruce Wayne is plenty willing to let Dent be the hero.
I:17943;4424;but all villains collectively take a back seat to the force of nature of Ledger's Joker.
I:17943;4425;"It is the best crime drama since ""The Departed"" and the fact that Bruce Wayne is a well."
I:17943;4426;By the end of The Dark Knight I was still gasping for breath.
I:17943;4427;The movie had excellent suspense and the Joker left you wondering what he was going to do next.
I:17943;4428;This Was A Very Good Movie No Doubt About That!
I:17943;4429;But The Classic Batman Is Still Better!
I:17943;4430;Give me a Hitchcock movie any day.
I:17943;4431;Much like Batman, its a instant classic, the movie is very entertaining and done well.
I:17943;4432;The Dark Knightis a very impressive follow up toBatman Begins.
I:17943;4433;This is one of those rare movies that can be enjoyed by fans of the original comic book series and those completely oblivious to the various sub.
I:17943;4434;The acting is largely very well done and most of the story elements are very well put together.
I:17943;4435;But the story is more complex than the Joker alone, and plays on the various psychological games that he plays on Gotham's various groups, including the public, the police, organized crime and Batman himself.
I:17943;4436;In that sense, there is a great deal of depth to the story that makes it easy to suspend disbelief considering not everybody is quick to believe comic.
I:17943;4437;tHE CASTThe casting is top notch.
I:17943;4438;And Aaron Eckhart is wonderful in his role as Harvey Dent, so much so that he could have certainly been nominated for several awards as well.
I:17943;4439;While she is certainly a capable actress, I found most of her scenes showed little range or emotion.
I:17943;4440;The camera work and lighting are excellent.
I:17943;4441;Standard galleries are included with production stills and poster art.
I:17943;4442;Those features are actually great to watch with those less familiar with the Batman story before watching the movie.
I:17943;4443;"the ""Gotham Uncovered"" extra includes two parts: ""The Evolution of the Knight"" covers some of the details on the new suit and Bat."
I:17943;4444;"pod, and ""The Sound of Anarchy"" includes a nice discussion on the score as created by Hans Zimmer, which is very good."
I:17943;4445;"The thing that I noticed most about ""The Sound of Anarchy"" is Hans Zimmer's impressive editing and mixing workstation."
I:17943;4446;cONCLUSIONThis film is an achievement.
I:17943;4447;This may be a movie worth upgrading to high.
I:17943;4448;Amazon got it there fast and for a great price (the price actually dropped from the time I ordered it to the time it shipped, and Amazon automatically refunded me the amount).
I:17943;4449;And BTW, the latest Batman movie is 100% cinematic magic .
I:17943;4450;The special effects and photography is excellent, but that's about it.
I:17943;4451;"in the end I actually think ""Iron Man"" is a far better movie!"
I:17943;4452;I ordered this for a Christmas Gift.
I:17943;4453;The stunts and special effects were amazing.
I:17943;4454;Christian Bale captured the very essence of Batman.
I:17943;4455;elusive, reclusive decisive but bold with only a hint of subtlety.
I:17943;4456;great movie action and adventure i loved this movie lots of nice nice nice action u will love this movie
I:17943;4457;I love Christian Bale as an actor, he is a wonderful Batman, and I just loved the whole movie.
I:17943;4458;This was an amazing movie.
I:17943;4459;"I've seen his other movies and classified him as a ""teen"" star, but after seeing this movie, I have more respect for him as an artist."
I:17943;4460;the Dark Knight, one of the greatest comic book movies ever made, record breaking records, critical acclaim, brilliant performance.
I:17943;4461;Yup that's right, the theme.
I:17943;4462;conclusion for this item: Great Movie, sorely lacking in special feature.
I:17943;4463;But I felt that way because of the early hour.
I:17943;4464;i was excited to see the early reviews for this monster .
I:17943;4465;christian Bale does a fine job as Bruce Wayne and The Batman.
I:17943;4466;the other actors, Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman and Aaron Eckhart do fantastic jobs in their roles.
I:17943;4467;The issue continues to be the Rachel Dawes character played by Maggie Gyllenhaal.
I:17943;4468;"The citizens have a ""hero with a face"" and cheer him on in his quest."
I:17943;4469;Heath Ledger is the master of this movie.
I:17943;4470;"even with the small flaws (I'm thinking of the policeman constantly saying ""This is not good"") The Dark Knight is the best Summer movie I have seen."
I:17943;4471;It gives the character more depth and meaning without the label.
I:17943;4472;I think abandoning the label was brilliant.
I:17943;4473;the exploration of community and crowd mentality was brilliantly shown in the scene with the ferries.
I:17943;4474;There was a lot of thought put into the instinctual nature of the crowds on both ferries.
I:17943;4475;Heath's performance in this movie was far beyond my original expectation and from the very start of the movie I found that I had underestimated him.
I:17943;4476;this sequel to Batman Begins continued to shine and further raise the bar of what a comic based movie should be.
I:17943;4477;a wonderful ride through Gotham in the time that Joker was loose on the streets and this movie delivers that experience.
I:17943;4478;"I must admit my lack of interest for ""super"" hero movies but with the high reviews of this movie it was worth a try."
I:17943;4479;I bought it hoping for excellence and that is what I received.
I:17943;4480;If you like the strange experience of seeing a wonderful performance of the Joker, an over.
I:17943;4481;Excellent movie and it looks good on Blu.
I:17943;4482;This movie is dark and brooding, with an intelligent script and a great cast.
I:17943;4483;I know that's what everyone is saying, and you probably know it by now too.
I:17943;4484;The tension and suspense that builds up to the final minutes is in tremendous amounts and the action is a plenty.
I:17943;4485;This role will always be remembered.
I:17943;4486;I like the fact that the Batman series took this more serious dramatic turn because it is very fitting for the world of Gotham, which, by the way, is played wonderfully by Chicago, IL.
I:17943;4487;The scenes of Tokyo are also very slick and nice.
I:17943;4488;"i recommend you see this movie if you havent already, which I'm pretty sure you have 
I:17943;4489;I enjoyed this movie becuse me and someFreinds love watching it when we get together and have a good time.
I:17943;4490;face was always my favorite.
I:17943;4491;Bruce Wayne owns, and if you don't like it, screw you.
I:17943;4492;Hello trully great movie whole series is real good, Heath Ledger as Dark Knight freakish great acting and missed actor lots good action allthroughout must check this movie out havent seen, but wait for Dark Knight rises lol hot hot hot!
I:17943;4493;in watching, I was reminded of the terror wrought in Mumbai a couple of weeks ago.
I:17943;4494;is a sad testament to what's important to our youth today, and who they look up to.
I:17943;4495;He's one of the few people who really began to take comic book movies seriously and the Hollywood community is suddenly beginning to follow suit.
I:17943;4496;THE DARK KNIGHT is the perfect example of what happens when you take the new mythology and treat it with respect .
I:17943;4497;wow is all I CANT SAY.
I:17943;4498;The Dark Knight was a fantastic film that has re.
I:17943;4499;defined the comic book movie genre and deservedly become one of the most popular films of all time.
I:17943;4500;I'll let other people continue that line of discourse.
I:17943;4501;ray version of The Dark Knight is absolutely terrific.
I:17943;4502;"He does a MOST EXCELLENT job reproducing the ""dark"" figure all red."
I:17943;4503;blooded American boys know so well from comic books.
I:17943;4504;the best Batman and the best comic book movie ever.
I:17943;4505;The music is incredible and Ledger's Joker is outstanding.
I:17943;4506;There will never be another performance in any comic book movie that'll ever top what he did with that character.
I:17943;4507;This movie was simply amazing.
I:17943;4508;His performance has got to be one of the greatest ever.
I:17943;4509;Nolan uses even more beautiful Chicago locations than in the first film, making for both a Chicago lover's dream movie (second only to Blues Brothers) but also rooting this film with a sense of reality that makes the tension and fear ramp up all the more.
I:17943;4510;Every player invests their character with a seriousness and an internal life that makes the movie sing as a thriller.
I:17943;4511;Particularly good are Eckhart, Ledger, and Gyllenhall.
I:17943;4512;besting Jack Nicholson's Joker with a truly chilling, psychotic vision.
I:17943;4513;the action sequences retain a believability but also deliver in terms of size, thrills, amazingness.
I:17943;4514;The chases are all thrilling, and some of the large set pieces (flipping the truck, hang gliding in Hong Kong) are truly great.
I:17943;4515;so it is the greatest comic book film?
I:17943;4516;The Dark Knight really delivers in spades on all of these levels.
I:17943;4517;Like the first Nolan film, it works as a movie, without requiring a love for the character.
I:17943;4518;It works as a thriller .
I:17943;4519;These sequences are really awe.
I:17943;4520;inspiring in terms of the detail and scope they provide.
I:17943;4521;Nonetheless, both ratios display lots of detail.
I:17943;4522;Black levels, important in a film like this, are rock solid and very deep, but still allow lots of shadow detail.
I:17943;4523;To put it simply, this is in the top 5 Blu.
I:17943;4524;extras are also very strong.
I:17943;4525;But anyone age 13 to 130 should find something to appreciate in it.
I:17943;4526;The Dark Knight is incredible!
I:17943;4527;All the elements came together perfectly.
I:17943;4528;This is the best film of the decade!
I:17943;4529;We've all seen the movie (many of us multiple times) and the general consensus is that the film will be winning many awards.
I:17943;4530;let's get right to the point.
I:17943;4531;The Blueray version is so much better thanThe Dark Knight.
I:17943;4532;Great actors, great story, special effects and the toys or props.
I:17943;4533;Good movie, even though I liked better Jack Nicholson as the Joker.
I:17943;4534;Movie was good and entertaining.
I:17943;4535;one of the best entertaining movie ever.
I:17943;4536;taker of the year, possibly even the whole decade, and kudos to it for that accomplishment.
I:17943;4537;But just simply being the highest.
I:17943;4538;the Dark Knight is above.
I:17943;4539;It was good, but it was no better than any other professionally.
I:17943;4540;face) and that's certainly the case here.
I:17943;4541;worthy and it's less fun than Jack Nicholson's portrayal of The Joker in the original 1989 Batman.
I:17943;4542;like grin from his fall into the acid in the 1989 film, which was much more true to the comic.
I:17943;4543;throughout the movie got on my nerves.
I:17943;4544;While Ledger's Joker is unique and watchable, overall I have to say that Jack Nicholson's Joker was more spot.
I:17943;4545;on and stayed truer to the comic book.
I:17943;4546;tDK does have enough redeeming qualities to make it worth seeing, however.
I:17943;4547;Like its predecessor, Batman Begins, TDK has the same impressive sets and marvelously done visuals that made the first film good.
I:17943;4548;It has great visual style and definite real.
I:17943;4549;To the movie's credit, one particular scene near the climax is very exciting, where Batman must fight his way through a high.
I:17943;4550;While TDK has many of the same good elements from BB, the biggest one that is missing from the first film is the excellent characterization of Bruce Wayne/Batman in Batman Begins.
I:17943;4551;overall, TDK is an above.
I:17943;4552;TDK is above average as a comic.
I:17943;4553;this BD is the best format for TDK.
I:17943;4554;This is the best Batman movie I have seen so far!
I:17943;4555;The movie arrived in a timely manner and in excellent condition.
I:17943;4556;Oh course everyone by now knows this is an excellent movie.
I:17943;4557;Blu ray picture and audio sound is very, very good, and the under $10 could not be beat.
I:17943;4558;I love this movie and saw it was SUCH a great deal that I had to get it!
I:17943;4559;I have watched it several times and it is perfect.
I:17943;4560;I received it very quickly and it worked out very nicely!
I:17943;4561;Heath Ledger's performance, movie special effects, theatrics, plot twists/turns, and unbelievable story line, make this is one of the greatest superhero movies ever created.
I:17943;4562;double face character is kind of wierdly put to me.
I:17943;4563;It works ever more when you have Heath Ledger playing as The Joker!!
I:17943;4564;The video stream was also very crisp and clear as well.
I:17943;4565;I mean, this movie has been lauded as one of the greatest of the decade.
I:17943;4566;I did watch, and quite enjoyed, Batman Begins.
I:17943;4567;"But what Batman Begins did right is the backstory
I:17943;4568;Also, his basic understanding of the criminal mind is briefly explained here, and his development of the various tools of the trade that he now uses to dole out the justice.
I:17943;4569;Because of that, it's a good idea to watch Batman Begins first, even if not required, because it sets the stage nicely.
I:17943;4570;When you translate that across to a more mature audience, you need to make the character that much more mature.
I:17943;4571;This is important, because the same methodology applies to Dark Knight, if not more so.
I:17943;4572;"All of this is done very well
I:17943;4573;happy ending of Batman Begins was not appealing to someone in the writer's office, because this one never gets happy.
I:17943;4574;what the movie does right: Christian Bale does a good job of playing Bruce Wayne and Batman respectively.
I:17943;4575;Heath Ledger, who I doubt you've not heard about, plays the Joker extremely well.
I:17943;4576;What some people claim is an inaccurate portrayal, again, is simply a rendition of the comic book character changed to a more mature setting, and it comes across well.
I:17943;4577;First, Batman Begins did a great job at telling a story that was easy to follow along with.
I:17943;4578;This was done well for the most part.
I:17943;4579;face substory should have been a separate movie altogether, because that's how intricate the real story between Wayne and Dent really is.
I:17943;4580;which I can tell they could have done and ended up with two pretty good movies instead of one good one.
I:17943;4581;While The Dark Knight is being regarded by some as the best movie ever done (mostly by teenagers) I have to say, while not the best film, it sure does fare well against others.
I:17943;4582;ray version of The Dark Knight is much better than it's regular counterpart.
I:17943;4583;The picture is very better with the colors more vibrant and the sound and music much clearer.
I:17943;4584;With a special feature more (I believe it's The Psychology Of Batman) the special features are about the same as the Two.
I:17943;4585;the movie is good and the Blu.
I:17943;4586;ray version of the movie is excellent.
I:17943;4587;A must by for Batman fans and people who love crime dramas.
I:17943;4588;Mind you, Heath Ledger did a good job in his role, but the role itself did not really fit.
I:17943;4589;Jack Nicholson did an awesome job as the Joker in the first.
I:17943;4590;Other than expired digital copy, movie is fine.
I:17943;4591;The special effects and overall look of the film was fantastic!!
I:17943;4592;It seems like a lot of recent movies are just filled with violence, a jumbled up story, but great special effects, and that gives these films 4 and 5 stars?!
I:17943;4593;This is a great departure from the normal comic themed movies.
I:17943;4594;Heath Ledger puts on a great performance as the joker.
I:17943;4595;Excellent movie with great action from beginning to end.
I:17943;4596;This is truly a must see if you plan on seeing other Batman movies.
I:17943;4597;That was a great movie!
I:17943;4598;The way the Joker is portrayed is just amazing.
I:17943;4599;Heath Ledger does an amazing job as the Joker.
I:17943;4600;He takes you on a twisted journey.
I:17943;4601;He definitely steals the leading role on this movie.
I:17943;4602;The movie is dark, gritty, and well paced.
I:17943;4603;There is a great depth to this movie.
I:17943;4604;Heath Ledger's Joker makes some amazing comments about human nature and society.
I:17943;4605;for the record, I loved the first 2 with Bale.
I:17943;4606;Absolutely love the franchise and recommend to everyone that they see it.
I:17943;4607;It was a great price as well.
I:17943;4608;if you love batman you will love this movie.
I:17943;4609;we did and we will continue to watch over and over
I:17943;4610;Going far and beyond a simple comic book film, The Dark Knight is a twisty, layered crime drama that delivers on all fronts.
I:17943;4611;The once powerful mob has been all but erradicated and slowly the city is now reclaiming its former glory, thanks not only to Batman but also the new district attorny Harvey Dent, who is just as determined to clean up the scum of Gotham, with Bruce's love intrest Rachel Dawes assisting him in his quest, both professional and romantic.
I:17943;4612;Armed with just a pocket full of knives and a devilish sense of humor, he seeks to destroy everything Batman and Dent have tried to build and bring it all crashing to the ground.
I:17943;4613;other then those few comments, the film, as a whole, is absolutly superb and definently one of the best of the year so far.
I:17943;4614;Bale is able to hold his own through out the whole film and Maggie Gyllenhaal acts as a pleasant surprise in filling in for Katie Holmes, which by the way I will say that I am one of the rare few who didn't think she did a bad job in the role.
I:17943;4615;I also don't want to rehash what everyone else has already said about this movie, so I'll just say that yes, it's very good, and it's definitely the best Batman movie ever made, at least so far.
I:17943;4616;The late actor's performance as the Joker is disturbing, amusing, and completely riveting.
I:17943;4617;face stuff is great, and Eckhart delivers a fantastic performance as well.
I:17943;4618;"face at the end of ""The Dark Knight"" and then be the focus of the next Batman movie."
I:17943;4619;Also, both Ledger and Christian Bale got carried away with their scary, muffled character voices.
I:17943;4620;all my griping aside, though, this was a very entertaining film.
I:17943;4621;really loud in the theatre.
I:17943;4622;(That alone is a testament to the effect this film had on me!)
I:17943;4623;I also really enjoyed Maggie Gyllenhaal's performance as Rachel.
I:17943;4624;"Anyway, the bottom line is that, yes, ""The Dark Knight"" is a really, REALLY good movie."
I:17943;4625;maybe not QUITE as good as all these hyperactive moviegoers are making it out to be, but this is definitely a film you should see on the big screen.
I:17943;4626;But for some reason it kept pausing and pausing and it got stuck and it was long pauses like 5 minutes and then it would start and pause after a few minutes.
I:17943;4627;this by far is my favorite movie of all.
I:17943;4628;keith played a very great roll.
I:17943;4629;all the symptoms of a pyscho and he protrayed it very well.
I:17943;4630;IS the best movie of the year,just awesome Mr nolan created the best batman movie
I:17943;4631;The Joker's profound and disturbing schizophrenia, the struggle between Batman as hero or vigilante .
I:17943;4632;"it might be a wonderful movie, but it's not ""Batman"" I may be dating myself, but I'll stick with Jack Nicholson's ""Joker"" portrayal ."
I:17943;4633;Possibly valuable, but certainly not the reason I wanted to see it.
I:17943;4634;The Dark Knight trilogy was the best of all the Batman series I've seen!
I:17943;4635;The acting is much more superb and the movie keeps you on your toes.
I:17943;4636;Great movie I would recommend getting the rest!
I:17943;4637;This is a great movie highly recomended for everyone.
I:17943;4638;BATMAN in blueray is absolutely astounishing.
I:17943;4639;You must have this action packed Batman movie to your collection.
I:17943;4640;My son loves it and got glued to the TV when watching this movie.
I:17943;4641;Great acting from a well diserved actor.
I:17943;4642;I saw this movie in theatres and absolutely loved it!
I:17943;4643;The plot is solid, and I like the eery sense of evil as well as the psychological struggle of the characters throughout the movie that most other films are too afraid to present.
I:17943;4644;Great movie great acting by Bale and Ledger the best batman movie yet by far.
I:17943;4645;Oldmans acting was perfect commisioner gordan.
I:17943;4646;All around very good acting by the entire cast.
I:17943;4647;The critics got this one right Ledgers jocker is the best acting I have seen in a long time and better than any character in any batman movie.
I:17943;4648;The movie is full of action and has a good story line.
I:17943;4649;ray and was a great deal.
I:17943;4650;The imax scenes take up the entire screen.
I:17943;4651;Very entertaining rendition of the Batman franchise, more likely to be considered true were it not fiction.
I:17943;4652;as a lifelong fan of comic book superheroes, there are quite a few that i've taken to my heart: Superman, Spiderman, The Fantastic Four, X. men,the Hulk, etc, etc.
I:17943;4653;"what Nolan has created with ""The Dark Knight"" cant truly be put into a few, simple sentences."
I:17943;4654;This film is one of the few true definitions of a masterpiece.
I:17943;4655;"in ""The Dark Knight"", we go a few levels further."
I:17943;4656;As much as i loved Jack Nicholson's Joker from Burton's '89 film, hes a punk compared to what Ledger created.
I:17943;4657;Ledger won a very deserved posthumous Oscar for his work.
I:17943;4658;the great Christian Bale is the ultimate Batman for our time.
I:17943;4659;Bale and Ledger are magnificent together.
I:17943;4660;as great as they are, its the supporting performances that help them shine.
I:17943;4661;"Gary Oldman's Detective James Gordon is a picture of powerful moral conviction and simple passion as he stands by Batman in the fight against crime
I:17943;4662;Thats what i loved about this film.
I:17943;4663;Intelligent, huge, well written and acted.
I:17943;4664;goer, has a 70s style aesthetic that will remind you of the great crime epics of that period like Serpico, Godfather 1 and 2, and even modern ones like Goodfellas and The Departed.
I:17943;4665;Director Christopher Nolan takes his place among the newest generation of filmmakers who dont treat their audiences like simple.
I:17943;4666;A powerful film from a powerful visionary.
I:17943;4667;great special effects for Harvey Dent (Two.
I:17943;4668;I was sorry that Michael Caine's role is diminished from the first movie as he really shines when he is on screen.
I:17943;4669;I love this movie it is considered, and justified, as one of the greatest films of this century.
I:17943;4670;The steelbook is such a delight to look at and is a piece of my movie collection that I cherish.
I:17943;4671;"Christopher Nolan has done it again, and this time it is with ""The Dark Knight."""
I:17943;4672;"Chaos is his talent, and with that he will do whatever it takes to corrupt squeaky clean District Attorney, Harvey Dent
I:17943;4673;And if he can make Gotham City tear itself to shreds, well then that's just fine with him.
I:17943;4674;All of this leads to an explosive film where answers don't come easily and actions don't come without a price.
I:17943;4675;I love how Nolan creates a great balance between action and story.
I:17943;4676;Still, it must be stressed that the entire cast did a great job.
I:17943;4677;There's a chance that this may put some people off but to the people who have seen it on IMAX, this is the way we saw it and I welcome it with open arms.
I:17943;4678;There's some nice extra features, although sadly I didn't see any deleted scenes when I was skimming the extras.
I:17943;4679;That was always something that bothered me.
I:17943;4680;The Dark Knight is a dark and complex tale that shows that superhero movies do not have to be without substance.
I:17943;4681;I really enjoyed it and it is something that I love more and more with each viewing.
I:17943;4682;I loved Batman Begins, so I was eagerly anticipating seeing The Dark Knight!
I:17943;4683;Heath Ledger was great, he definitely deserves all the praise he got for this role.
I:17943;4684;The main characters are fine as well.
I:17943;4685;Very Good But not as good as batman begins,everyone is saying how terrific this movie is but its only because of heath ledgers death.
I:17943;4686;Great acting, love Heath Ledger was a GREAT Joker, the plot was good, acting was good, overall the best batman in the series, Batman with Danny Devito was just underneath this one, but Dark Knight was the best.
I:17943;4687;I said before I saw this movie that no one could replace Jack Nicholson depiction of the joker, but Heath Ledger did a phenomenal job as the joker, I already knew the joker was crazy and Heath Ledger made it true on the screen.
I:17943;4688;Heath Ledger is my favorite joker of all time.
I:17943;4689;run theater near me, I was finally able to see it.
I:17943;4690;It was worth the wait.
I:17943;4691;They are powerful pieces in chess, capable of skipping over other pieces, striking from behind Pawns to attack opponents and then jumping away.
I:17943;4692;Although it may seem to be one of the weaker pieces of chess, when combined with any other piece it is one of the most powerful.
I:17943;4693;in a similar fashion, Harvey Dent and Batman are more powerful because of their pawns.
I:17943;4694;Dent is Batman as a civil servant, minus the angst.
I:17943;4695;batman's true nemesis, the real White Knight, is of course the Joker (Heath Ledger).
I:17943;4696;And now we truly see the opposite of what Batman stands for.
I:17943;4697;Joker is a criminal form of vigilante justice.
I:17943;4698;face is finally done right in this movie (better than even the cartoon, and that's saying something), and his horrific appearance is so disturbing that my wife felt it pushed the film to an R. rating.
I:17943;4699;the Joker is so unnerving, so malevolent in action, and so utterly amoral in his goal of protecting the Batman.
I:17943;4700;ideal, that Ledger and Nolan have made their indelible mark on the character.
I:17943;4701;"This is the Joker comic book fans always knew from ""The Long Halloween"" and ""The Killing Joke."""
I:17943;4702;But ultimately, Nolan's masterpiece is both a meditation on the comic book genre and modern day society.
I:17943;4703;It's a bold, uncompromising vision that will haunt you long after the movie ends.
I:17943;4704;but the writing, directing, and other performancesall help to make this the best comic book adaptation yet!!
I:17943;4705;Man, this was a great movie.
I:17943;4706;Got it for Christmas and so it on a big screen with good sound.
I:17943;4707;I found myself being inside the movie.
I:17943;4708;Ledger's interpretation of the joker was spot on.
I:17943;4709;I loved Jack Nicholson's role, when he did it, but Ledger's will make your skin crawl.
I:17943;4710;The absolute best Batman out there.
I:17943;4711;Batpod and disc packaging are on a stand which makes it a great display piece.
I:17943;4712;This movie was great from start to finish, Heath Ledger was amazing, he will be missed.
I:17943;4713;man I wondered how could TDK top this movie.
I:17943;4714;1st off The film leaves you @ each and every moment on the edge of your seat (I swear I thought I was going 2 fall off my chair).
I:17943;4715;Christian Bale still proved that he was indeed the greatest Batman of all time.
I:17943;4716;the movie is centered around 3 men: Batman/Bruce Wayne, Jim Gordon, and Harvey Dent.
I:17943;4717;face and leads in2 an emotional confrontation Btween all 3 men.
I:17943;4718;So please, consider that my comments are not perfect, and accept what I have to offer with an open mind.
I:17943;4719;I enjoyed it and would recommend it.
I:17943;4720;"however, I believe that ""The Dark Knight"" was made interesting and entertaining by Batman's enemy, The Joker, and not Batman himself."
I:17943;4721;The Dark Knight was absolutely a 5 star Batman movie.
I:17943;4722;While not quite as good as Batman Begins,The Dark Knight is clearly a movie that gets everything right.
I:17943;4723;Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker is beyond spectacular.
I:17943;4724;It's worth watching this movie for the Joker alone because Ledger is that good in the role.
I:17943;4725;The Joker has always been the strongest Batman villain and the Dark Movie is no exception.
I:17943;4726;The plot itself is one of the best and most complex we've had in the Batman franchise.
I:17943;4727;And the character development of Batman is awesome.
I:17943;4728;But Nolan's films take it to another level because they feel more realistic than Burton's.
I:17943;4729;thanks for getting it here so fast.
I:17943;4730;heath ledger is fantastic, and it's sad that he's dead, but i like watching this to remember him
I:17943;4731;this is an awesome movie.
I:17943;4732;Christian Bale is an amazing actor.
I:17943;4733;"While I don't think Batman ""evolved"" much, I do enjoy how Christian Bale plays the role."
I:17943;4734;"He effortlessly waivers between being a ""playboy"" (Bruce Wayne) and brooding/conflicted superhero (Batman)."
I:17943;4735;What I really liked about Bale's portrayal is that you can feel the internal conflict between being a superhero and being yourself.
I:17943;4736;I would seem being Batman costs Wayne everything including his love.
I:17943;4737;"And while he struggles to balance his desire to save ""Gotham"", with his desire to be normal, you sympathize."
I:17943;4738;I thought Katie bought a certain innocence that Maggie attempted to recreate but didn't do it successfully.
I:17943;4739;I still enjoyed Gary Oldman as the dedicated Police Lieutenant, and although I was saddened by his character's fate, I definitely think that he was one of the shining stars in the first Batman and in this one.4.
I:17943;4740;Gadget man Lucius Fox (played by the earring wearing Morgan Freeman) was brilliant and captivating as usual.
I:17943;4741;There definitely seems to be a mutual respect and admiration between them.6.
I:17943;4742;Michael Caine, as Bruce Wayne's handy assistant (Alfred), and guardian of Batman's truth, was equally brilliant.7.
I:17943;4743;"Aaron Eckhart, as the dedicated and incorruptible District Attorney Harvey Dent was great, as was genesis to ""Two Face""."
I:17943;4744;So if you want all that, you will have to pony up the extra bucks to get it.
I:17943;4745;but after all is said and done, I would give this a solid 3.5 or 4.
I:17943;4746;I bought the first one in the saga (Batman Begins) for my husband who loved the movie and I got into it as much as he did.
I:17943;4747;As soon as the second movie came out, he went to see it with his friends.
I:17943;4748;If you liked the first Nolan Batman movie, you're going to love this one, too.
I:17943;4749;and the third one (hopefully, he'll keep it going beyond a third one.)
I:17943;4750;I must say I really enjoyed this movie.
I:17943;4751;BUT, having said this, Batman is, and will always be, Adam West.
I:17943;4752;"The ""real"" Batman was pure, funloving camp ."
I:17943;4753;This is a classic example of why Blu.
I:17943;4754;the incredible detail (audio and visual) of the film, coupled with the extra content, make this a really enjoyable experience.
I:17943;4755;love this movie on Blu.
I:17943;4756;Watch it all the time.
I:17943;4757;Music is amazing and I love this series of Batman!
I:17943;4758;yes I know I heard it was highly rated but being my first time watching it I was blown away with the acting, really top notch stuff!
I:17943;4759;Lots of special features to go along with the disc.
I:17943;4760;He's the reason to watch, he drives the plot, he has the best lines, he is the protagonist.
I:17943;4761;it really is a decent Batman offering.
I:17943;4762;"If you are in need of a Batman fix and you like your ""Caped Crusader"" dark, intense, and p*ssed off, this is the Batman film for you."
I:17943;4763;This is one of the best movies EVER!!!!!!
I:17943;4764;Anyone who is reading this by now has likely seen the movie multiple times.
I:17943;4765;He played the psychopath perfectly, and gave you the impression that he was insane yet totally in control of what he was doing.
I:17943;4766;It was not only the best portrayals of the Joker ever (at least in a tv/film version of Batman) but one of the best acting performances ever.
I:17943;4767;i think what is great about this movie is that it appeals to a wider audience than just fans of superhero movies.
I:17943;4768;Everyone knows how Batman Forever and Batman and Robin nearly killed off the franchise.
I:17943;4769;Because of Nolan's great storytelling, the superb acting and bringing an element of realism to the story (as much as possible anyway) that had been lost, this movie is well worth adding to your collection.
I:17943;4770;because it simply is the very best of the three!!!
I:17943;4771;and I plan to see it again, and again, and so on.
I:17943;4772;My man, Heath Ledger truly gave the most incredible performance ever depicted of The Joker persona!!
I:17943;4773;"Having rebooted the Batman franchise with a new backstory and aesthetic in ""Batman Begins"", director and co. writer Christopher Nolan gives us an allegory of a world desperate to overcome chaos and restore order and justice in ""The Dark Knight""."
I:17943;4774;The Dark Knight is thematically ambitious but not quite successful.
I:17943;4775;it smartly recognizes that modern people fear unpredictability more than anything.
I:17943;4776;But as for what values people should be willing to throw out the window to restore order, or to give the appearance of stability, well, the characters change their minds a lot, and so does the film.
I:17943;4777;At least he looks like he's having fun.
I:17943;4778;An entertaining film, but Christopher Nolan needs to tighten it up and get more disciplined with his camera and his script.
I:17943;4779;My god what an insanely overrated movie!
I:17943;4780;These positive reviews are more amusing than the actual movie itself.
I:17943;4781;I wont hesitate to say that I loved the first two Batman movies.
I:17943;4782;A huge change from the phenomenal Batman/Bruce Wayne that he played previously in Batman Begins.
I:17943;4783;face is a level higher than Tommy Lee Jones' Two.
I:17943;4784;He was more than some wacko killer and you knew from the beginning that he is going to do his crimes with style.
I:17943;4785;He is a tad goofy but unpredictable.
I:17943;4786;He is fun to watch.
I:17943;4787;The fact that they are competent and obedient puts a bigger strain on the credibility of the story being told.
I:17943;4788;Such obvious mistakes kill the claims that this is the greatest superhero movie of all time.
I:17943;4789;Batman Begins had its flaws but still managed to be a great movie.
I:17943;4790;This movie has none of what made Batman Begins entertaining and interesting.
I:17943;4791;But I'm glad I finally borrowed the movie because I loved it!
I:17943;4792;It had great acting from Heath Ledger who was an amazing Joker and lots of action, but there was some humor in it too.
I:17943;4793;So overall, it was a fantastic movie and I would suggest you watch it!
I:17943;4794;I like to watch the extra features on movies.
I:17943;4795;The picture is so crisp and clear.
I:17943;4796;up is so real looking.
I:17943;4797;One of the reasons I bought this film was for the visual affects and stunts.
I:17943;4798;the Dark Knight is full of action, romance and suspense.
I:17943;4799;Having the courage and character to take the fall for someone else to serve a bigger purpose.
I:17943;4800;The Joker is certainly an evil character, and Heath Ledger did an outstanding job playing him.
I:17943;4801;I wish he was able to see how many people loved the movie.
I:17943;4802;the Dark Knight exceeded my expectations beyond what I thought was possible.
I:17943;4803;Christian Bale and entire cast do a spactacular job of bringing Batman saga into today's world.
I:17943;4804;Fantasic and I highly recommend all 3 in this series.
I:17943;4805;Whenever I order straight from Amazon and not a seller I get really good customer service.
I:17943;4806;ray is my favorite movie of all time.
I:17943;4807;No complaints, awesome acting and amazing graphics.
I:17943;4808;Very excited for the new Batman movie.
I:17943;4809;The highlight performance of the joker is okay, better than others, it is creepy in a clown sort of way, but slightly overrated.
I:17943;4810;The TV show was more intelligent.
I:17943;4811;I thought that was pretty amazing, hope he wasn't lying.
I:17943;4812;So anyways I was able to get into screen two since the first screen was already sold out.
I:17943;4813;That set aside the special effects are superb.
I:17943;4814;The end of this movie gets you pumped, asking for more and telling you that Batmans back and better then ever.
I:17943;4815;"And it's that respect and admiration for the legacy of the Batman character that powers ""The Dark Knight."""
I:17943;4816;but Batman's good intentions backfire.
I:17943;4817;He smears his face with moldy looking make.
I:17943;4818;As for Ledger, in his last complete role, he turns a performance as the Joker that ranks with the finest performances, by anyone, anywhere, in history.
I:17943;4819;"from there, ""The Dark Knight"" begins a crescendo of operatic intensity, masterfully orchestrated by Nolan, who here stakes a claim as the best director of his generation."
I:17943;4820;He chronicles a struggle not just for the turf of Gotham City but for its very soul, and you'll be riveted at the sheer amount of directorial skill Nolan amasses to accomplish this.
I:17943;4821;It's a rousing, complex and emotionally draining ride.
I:17943;4822;It's a good movie if you like this sort of dark film.
I:17943;4823;The recipient was pleased with it.
I:17943;4824;Heath Ledger's performance was awesome!
I:17943;4825;one of the better movies I have seen in a long time.
I:17943;4826;It is a real pain to have to mail something back to return it.
I:17943;4827;Wasnt able to watch the movie.
I:17943;4828;this is how it is suppose to be done, truely, remarkable movie in its own essence.
I:17943;4829;WB finally got it right!!!
I:17943;4830;god bless everyone that put there every effort and hard work into making this great movie!!!
I:17943;4831;This has easily become my favorite movie.
I:17943;4832;The more I watch it, the more I love it.
I:17943;4833;Heath Ledgers performance however, is awesome and you realize it from the get go.
I:17943;4834;This movie is dark and violent, but it has a great story to go with it.
I:17943;4835;So much better than the Michael Keaton or Val Kilmer versions.
I:17943;4836;With a flawless transfer to Blu.
I:17943;4837;ray, a must have for any movie collector!
I:17943;4838;If you haven't seen this film go out and see it you will love it.
I:17943;4839;I give it 5 stars.
I:17943;4840;His great work shows in this film .
I:17943;4841;The Dark Knight is awesome.
I:17943;4842;The item is just great.
I:17943;4843;In one of the great sequels, Christopher Nolan returns at the helm of middle segment of his trilogy.
I:17943;4844;This Joker is played by Heath Ledger in his Oscar winning performance.
I:17943;4845;"After watching this version earlier I went back to watch the first (and best) of the earlier live action ""Batman"" (1990) films to catch Jack Nicholson's Joker."
I:17943;4846;At the time, I thought both the film and Nicholson were very good.
I:17943;4847;Now Jack's Joker seems quaint.
I:17943;4848;This guy is scary good and sets the tone for the later more amplified scenes.
I:17943;4849;Make no mistake this is a well made film on every level, but Heath Ledger's performance is what makes it exceptional.
I:17943;4850;This was my favorite film of 2008.
I:17943;4851;You may notice this transition but to me it all blends perfectly.
I:17943;4852;Dark and deep, filled with pathos and action, and possessing some of the best writing, best cinematography, best directing, and best acting seen in any movie, this may be my favorite film.
I:17943;4853;Christian Bale plays the tormented vigilante wonderfully, as he struggles between his desire for a normal life and the knowledge that the Joker will keep killing, keep destroying, keep wreaking havoc, all because it keeps Batman in the game with him.
I:17943;4854;the rest of the cast is remarkable, too, and they all shine in their roles .
I:17943;4855;Truly beautiful, powerful, and haunting music, with a strong feeling of danger and things hovering on the brink.
I:17943;4856;It's a masterpiece, a true perfection, and worth every bit of hype it's gotten, and then some.
I:17943;4857;This is a true classic, one to be remembered.
I:17943;4858;Item in great condition and arrived in a very timely manner.
I:17943;4859;Scariest Joker I've seen !
I:17943;4860;Worth watching but not a family movie
I:17943;4861;It was one of the most unique and jaw dropping performances in anyones lifetime.
I:17943;4862;still respect is due to all the other actors.
I:17943;4863;I really enjoyed this movie it was full of action and the dark knight was amazing I really don't like the bat.
I:17943;4864;man but what are you going to do I would have preferred Clooney but what are you going to do overall it is a must see movie!
I:17943;4865;The Dark Knight is the best film of the year (so far), with some impressive acting from everyone, a top notch screenplay, a great musical score and a little someone called Heath Ledger.
I:17943;4866;His presence dominates the whole film.
I:17943;4867;Maggie Gyllenhaal is a better actress than Katie Holmes, so that was a good trade.
I:17943;4868;I thought Aaron Eckhart made a very good Harvey Dent and Two.
I:17943;4869;Gary Oldman, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are all amazing actors and elevate the supporting roles they are given.
I:17943;4870;Maybe I'm a little twisted, but it brought a huge smile to my face.
I:17943;4871;I realize I'm an outlier in this one, but The Dark Knight was easily the most overrated movie I've seen in years.
I:17943;4872;There are so many great ideas stuffed into the picture but the film never comes together.
I:17943;4873;"the grim, realistic portrayal of the Batman mythos is an interesting idea
I:17943;4874;"Batman also uses cell phones to spy on all of Gotham City
I:17943;4875;But, he treats the entire movie like a realistic crime drama .
I:17943;4876;the acting is uniformly good and there are so many great ideas floating around.
I:17943;4877;Nolan obviously has a vision .
I:17943;4878;(Spoilers)Dark Knight is to be applauded for its effort to transcend the genre.
I:17943;4879;An evolution of each, with a cerebral reason for their existence, not just a physical presence but a intellectual metamorphosis.
I:17943;4880;this premise works for me.
I:17943;4881;Heath Ledger is simply amazing.
I:17943;4882;Not because he has passed away, but because his presence on camera is captivating.
I:17943;4883;It wont win him an Oscar, but nevertheless he alone propelled this movie high into the stratosphere!But this movie wasn't about Joker alone.
I:17943;4884;We saw more of him as Batman, and to be quite honest.
I:17943;4885;An oddball of motives, of creation and of reaction.
I:17943;4886;Yeh his face got burnt.
I:17943;4887;I understood the importance of two face in this movie, but I wasnt as entertained in his presence.
I:17943;4888;Christopher Nolan doesnt do action sequences well.
I:17943;4889;I'm happy to build you weapons of mass destruction but damn it.
I:17943;4890;I have NEVER really liked comic book movies.
I:17943;4891;and I must admit it's amazing!
I:17943;4892;The acting is super and it is actually a movie I will want to see again and again.
I:17943;4893;Christopher Nolan has created before our eyes the dark world of Gotham City.
I:17943;4894;With the Dark Knight we are drawn further into characters we have come to love or hate.
I:17943;4895;Christian Bale once again lights up the screen.
I:17943;4896;Michael Caine is flawless as the loyal staunch servant standing beside the one in which he believes.
I:17943;4897;Gary Oldman portrays a man standing in the dark seeking good and is willing to fight for it.
I:17943;4898;Brilliant and undaunting he works with Batman to free Gotham of chains long rusted.
I:17943;4899;And he is most happy to do so.
I:17943;4900;I thought it was a good movie, but far from great.
I:17943;4901;Ledger gives an amazing twisted performance.
I:17943;4902;I have a lot, so I will just go over a few of the major ones.
I:17943;4903;When he's around people who don't know he's Batman he uses the nice voice, which is fake.
I:17943;4904;When he's around people who know he's Batman, he uses the dark voice, which is his normal voice.
I:17943;4905;I liked the first movie A LOT more.
I:17943;4906;The non fight scenes are pretty spectacular.
I:17943;4907;I liked the first fight.
I:17943;4908;The Dark Knight is a movie so good you cannot stop admiring the intensity, action and simply formidable greatness of it.
I:17943;4909;It is, without a doubt, the best Batman movie to date.
I:17943;4910;And how impressed and excited you felt at that scene?
I:17943;4911;Well, this Batman maintained that level of intensity and excitement throughout the entire film.
I:17943;4912;Every scene, every twist, every single thing that happened was perfectly timed and performed to deliver us a truly exciting and well made film.
I:17943;4913;Heath Ledger steals this movie from Batman because his performance is so good, so truly evil and let's face it, fun as well, that the movie simply belonged to him.
I:17943;4914;Aaron Eckhart was really good as Harvey Dent and Michael Cane is a great Alfred.
I:17943;4915;Basically, the entire cast was really good, perfectly chosen.
I:17943;4916;the action scenes and the direction in this movie was flawless.
I:17943;4917;Every scene delivered more and more action, more excitement and more darkness.
I:17943;4918;great movie, great price, sound ok.
I:17943;4919;what can i say this is a great movie even if you are not a batman fan this is a must see great job by joker.
I:17943;4920;Just got the joker dx11 2.0 action figure as well.
I:17943;4921;The Dark knight was one amazing film.
I:17943;4922;imo it is the best of 2008!
I:17943;4923;the blu ray version of the movie is outstanding.
I:17943;4924;All of the imax scenes are by far the best pq i have ever seen on a blu ray.
I:17943;4925;Not to mention the rest of the film looks great as well!
I:17943;4926;The sound is crisp and clear.
I:17943;4927;All in all this is one enjoyable blu ray.
I:17943;4928;The film is a masterpiece with great performances by Bale and Ledger.
I:17943;4929;ray version has excellent PQ and AQ,it is a must own.
I:17943;4930;Batman Tim Burton version, 1989, good classic comic series.
I:17943;4931;Excellent Batman performance by Michael Keaton, and a good performance by Jack Nicholson as the Joker, and years and years and years later, making more and more Batman movies, and along the way, evolving more and more.
I:17943;4932;And now, it has evolved into the deep, dark underpinnings of THE DARK KNIGHT.
I:17943;4933;The most intense blockbuster in the history of movies.
I:17943;4934;Heath Ledger's performance in the Dark Knight is breathtaking.
I:17943;4935;What an outstanding way to finish your career.
I:17943;4936;Its a good thing that Heath Ledger managed to give us one, Last performance before he left us.
I:17943;4937;This is a great movie with wonderful acting by the late Keith Ledger.
I:17943;4938;This film rises above the pack in so many aspects.
I:17943;4939;And Heath Ledger's joker is the first villain I've ever seen on screen that I actually wanted to see more of in the sequel since Darth Vader.
I:17943;4940;The Dark Knight is an ambitious film, but it promises more than it delivers.
I:17943;4941;"The fault is not in the two main characters: the Joker is very well acted by Heath Ledger
I:17943;4942;The plot gives us a good connection between Joker and Dent/TwoFace, though almost to the end I thought they were just setting us up for Batman movie #3 by introducing Two.
I:17943;4943;Finally, when Rachel Dawes gets blown up you just feel that Maggie Gyllenhaal deserved it.
I:17943;4944;"There are a number of ""Oh wow"" scenes using technology that could have ."
I:17943;4945;appeared in the old James Bond movies.
I:17943;4946;"A much better example of a story about a crimefighter (a cop) who tries to stop a serial killer by getting into his head, and the effects of that on the cop, is ""Man Hunter."""
I:17943;4947;"ranks with Katie Holmes' statement at the end of ""."
I:17943;4948;I love my blue ray player and watching this batman movie in blue ray was great.
I:17943;4949;the colors, the sound are great.
I:17943;4950;"the story was really interesting and the acting couldn
I:17943;4951;He targets the people that everybody holds most dear: hospital patients, civilians, politicians, cops, and the woman Bruce Wayne and Harvey Dent love, Rachel Dawes.
I:17943;4952;Batman and Harvey Dent have to struggle to prove they are better men than the Joker.
I:17943;4953;Bruce Wayne has hope the Dent will be able to clean up the city, and plans on settling down with Rachel Dawes.
I:17943;4954;heath Ledger gives an outstanding performance.
I:17943;4955;All of the Joker's schemes would fit right into a movie like Silence of the Lambs or Seven.
I:17943;4956;They are so intense I was at the edge of my seat whenever he was on screen.
I:17943;4957;It was the perfect type of scheme for the Joker.
I:17943;4958;the entire cast gives an all around good job.
I:17943;4959;Aaron Eckhart gives a good performance as Harvey Dent.
I:17943;4960;up and CGI for his face was perfect.
I:17943;4961;The scene where he interrogates the Joker is the most suspenseful scene in the movie.
I:17943;4962;Nevertheless Harvey Dent's story arc is tragic and effective.
I:17943;4963;Harvey Dent represented the hope and strength Gotham needed to overcome evil.
I:17943;4964;His fall from grace gives Joker the last laugh, and Batman has to cover up everything Two.
I:17943;4965;i look forward to seeing where they will take the Batman character in the next movie.
I:17943;4966;The Dark Knight stands towards the top of the list of best Superhero movies for its perfect portrayal of the characters and all around intensity.
I:17943;4967;comitem is really good and when converted to cost 17 well chuffed as they go for 30+ on ebay
I:17943;4968;This film has reached a masterpiece status among it's many fans and I think they're watching this film through rose colored Bat.
I:17943;4969;capable Christian Bale)is so one dimensional in this film.
I:17943;4970;Heath Ledger gives an excellent twisted performance as the Joker, but it's not Oscar worthy!
I:17943;4971;man/Peter Parker has so much more depth and character development.
I:17943;4972;man 3 The villains are so much more developed.
I:17943;4973;over allThe Dark Knight is a very impressive film with some great FX and cast!
I:17943;4974;Regardless of it's flaws, it's still a very good movie.
I:17943;4975;what impressed me about the writing is how Nolan was able to convey, in a very real.
I:17943;4976;world sense, the anxiety and life.
I:17943;4977;The psychological warfare between Batman and the Joker (even Dent) is mostly well.
I:17943;4978;handled and illustrated, adding a nice layer of richness to the film's finished product.
I:17943;4979;Nolan makes up for this deviation with purely satisfying Batman fanfare action sequences and capturing our hero at his best.
I:17943;4980;This is wholly satisfying for many Batman fans, especially the Joker, who is played at his darkest core.
I:17943;4981;I found myself holding my breath with anticipation at a few moments, and Nolan seems to change up the outcomes JUST enough to keep you guessing.
I:17943;4982;Not so much gory, as it is intense subject matter and mature themes.
I:17943;4983;i found the performances of all the cast to be top.
I:17943;4984;Oldman steps up his game from Begins, and his role serves as the best view for the audience.
I:17943;4985;maggie Gyllenhaal is a more watchable Rachel Dawes, but her character is little more than a device here.
I:17943;4986;harvey Dent is perhaps, the biggest surprise of the story and I was impressed with Aaron Eckhart's performance.
I:17943;4987;"His story is perhaps the greatest arc of the film, although I thought his ""point of no return"" was a little rushed and hard to believe."
I:17943;4988;"morgan Freeman is back as our new favorite ""Q"", Lucias Fox, offering up new technology for Batman's disposal."
I:17943;4989;in the end, I would qualify the Dark Knight as the the best Batman film to date, going back as far as you want to.
I:17943;4990;I can also say this is quite possibly the best COMIC film to date.
I:17943;4991;But what surprised me, was that this was one of the best CRIME films I've seen in a long time.
I:17943;4992;I have never liked the Batman series (like the ones from the 80's), but I love this movie and Batman Begins!
I:17943;4993;They are truly entertaining, but watch out if you have little kids.
I:17943;4994;In all seriousness though, it's a solid movie that's really well put together.
I:17943;4995;Great condition and arrival of product.
I:17943;4996;it was just good, not great.
I:17943;4997;still love the old batman with michael keaton and tim burton.
I:17943;4998;I will keep this short.
I:17943;4999;This is one of the best movies available for the Blu Ray format.
I:17943;5000;The sound is excellent, and the picture is oh, so sweet.
I:17943;5001;imagining of Batman by Christopher Nolan is one of the best things, if not THE best, ever to happen to the bat.
I:17943;5002;special effects and action was great.
I:17943;5003;heath ledger was fantastic in the role as the Joker.
I:17943;5004;if you're not a fan of his, or of the Batman series, you might not become a fan from watching this movie, but i do recommend giving it a chance at least.
I:17943;5005;Its a pretty good storyline and even a bit scary towards the end.
I:17943;5006;he was awesome in his role and you will love him in this one.
I:17943;5007;A friend who saw it in the theatre railed against it but I bought it and loved it.
I:17943;5008;Even my wife loves it, surprisingly to me because it's a man's action thriller.
I:17943;5009;One of the best Batman movies yet.
I:17943;5010;up literally dry up and crack right in front of you.
I:17943;5011;The brand new disk arrives, plays (excellent movie!)
I:17943;5012;as Clara Peller so eloquently said many years ago .
I:17943;5013;Great show, Heath Ledger was awesome.
I:17943;5014;This movie was a great movie.
I:17943;5015;Christian Bale proves once again that he may be the best Batman there is and well I think everyone can agree that the performance by Heath Ledge as the Joker was over the top!
I:17943;5016;What a great loss of talent.
I:17943;5017;Awesome special effects, overall one of the best Batman movies ever.
I:17943;5018;We both enjoyed the movie.
I:17943;5019;price is right too, due to the convenience.
I:17943;5020;He was very happy to receive it.
I:17943;5021;This was a great value.
I:17943;5022;The price was great compared to stores that I shopped around in.
I:17943;5023;Even as an online value I got a great deal.
I:17943;5024;There is no good Superhero movie without a good Supervillain.
I:17943;5025;Incredibly awesome performance by the whole cast made it so.
I:17943;5026;I really enjoyed it time after time after time after time.
I:17943;5027;Hands down one of the best movies ever made.
I:17943;5028;Stick with corny Spider Man sequels and leave amazing films like this to the adults.
I:17943;5029;In a very good way though.
I:17943;5030;a bright day for cinema in the 21st century.
I:17943;5031;first class writing, directing, cinematography, special effects, sound, editing, music and overall production.
I:17943;5032;The characters are carefully drawn and their interraction with each other is gripping.
I:17943;5033;At a deeper level, the film makes several daunting but ultimately uplifting comments on social reality.
I:17943;5034;A scene involving the fate of two ferries, one full of citizens and one full of prisoners, is especially memorable.
I:17943;5035;"Ever since ""Memento"" (2000), he's kept our eyes glued to the screen."
I:17943;5036;It's certainly worth the $1.96 I paid on black friday.
I:17943;5037;epic in scope with brilliant direction from Christopher Nolan (whose orchestration of an opening bank heist is nearly flawless), The Dark Knight takes us places that superhero or comic book.
I:17943;5038;It's an intelligent, dark, and surprisingly violent ride that features wonderful performances from nearly everyone involved, and the handling of Dent's tragic descent is as memorable as almost any thing else featured in the film.
I:17943;5039;Ledger's Joker is by and far the best treatment of a villain you will ever find in a comic to film adaptation: he's sickly funny and incredibly frightening in a performance that truly is for the ages.
I:17943;5040;Bale himself seems more comfortable in the role of Batman, and is by far the best Caped Crusader to grace the screen.
I:17943;5041;Eckhart is fitting as Harvey Dent, and his tragic transformation into Two.
I:17943;5042;face is, as said before, respectful and believable.
I:17943;5043;all in all, The Dark Knight is certainly the best Batman film to ever see the light of day.
I:17943;5044;So good in fact, that one will wonder just how Christopher Nolan and co. could be able to top it.
I:17943;5045;The best may still be yet to come.
I:17943;5046;despite being the best film of the year the look of it on Blu.
I:17943;5047;Do your family a favor and let this be a Santa gift this xmas.
I:17943;5048;ray has arrived!The DARK KNIGHT rules!
I:17943;5049;They did such a great job making this!
I:17943;5050;I think I have a new favorite movie!
I:17943;5051;What makes a great comic book story?
I:17943;5052;what makes a great movie?
I:17943;5053;An ensemble cast of multiple protagonists and antagonists.
I:17943;5054;"given these two descriptions, one can safely say that ""The Dark Knight"" is probably the greatest comic book movie of all time, and one of the greatest movies of all time."
I:17943;5055;honed teams of dedicated individuals.
I:17943;5056;Probably the most insightful feature of this film is the subtle but unceasing display of ownership.
I:17943;5057;"Almost every single major location of this film is owned by some individual or institution
I:17943;5058;And it is this feature that is the icing on the cake that is this great movie.
I:17943;5059;I love this movie and the blu.
I:17943;5060;ray definitely is the way to watch it.
I:17943;5061;Worth the extra to get blu.
I:17943;5062;Yet there is hope on the streets and fear starting emerge in the hearts of criminals, all because of Batman.
I:17943;5063;The script was well written.
I:17943;5064;The movie was well acted by everyone included.
I:17943;5065;And the moral choices that the characters had to make pushed comic book heroes into the real life that everyone can identify with.
I:17943;5066;The Caped Crusader is portrayed brilliantly in this movie.
I:17943;5067;Joker's portrayal by Heath Ledger was absolutely amazing to say the least.
I:17943;5068;Honor has once again been brought to the legend of the Dark Knight by Christopher Nolan and his crew.
I:17943;5069;The Dark Knight has been my favorite movie since I had seen it in the theater(as part of a Dark Knight/ X. files: I Want to Believe double feature.)
I:17943;5070;The tone was one of insanity and chaos perfectly match by the on.
I:17943;5071;Thus we segue into the major article of discussion for this movie, the brilliant Heath Ledger.
I:17943;5072;He knew The Joker inside and out, playing the role perfectly in every way.
I:17943;5073;not only the greatest Batman movie ever made, but an amazing movie in its own right.
I:17943;5074;I really love this movie.
I:17943;5075;This movie is by far one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.
I:17943;5076;And I'm saying this as one of the hardcore Batman fans out there.
I:17943;5077;some of the animated series was good.
I:17943;5078;actually, all of the animated series is good.
I:17943;5079;"even the new stuff, ""The Batman""."
I:17943;5080;they succeeded thanks to one man's death, one awesome character's name and a couple of his comic book elements being imitated (lamely), inappropriate happy meal.
I:17943;5081;the Batman of the comic book world, for the many ignorant people who are promoting this movie, is many things.
I:17943;5082;he's the world's greatest detective and a mystery himself, he's a loner and a super social smooth.
I:17943;5083;powered, he's the richest man in the world and gets the most hardship.
I:17943;5084;this contradiction of a character is awesome in comic book form.
I:17943;5085;"i'm talking about the ""dark"" realistic Batman stories."
I:17943;5086;a good comic book film is one that is either fun, has beautiful special effects, or brings something to the screen that would be hard to bring to the screen.
I:17943;5087;and it definitely was not fun.
I:17943;5088;The movie is great: however, I'm not sure it's worth the extra cost for the batpod.
I:17943;5089;probably better just to get the film.
I:17943;5090;This movie is at THE top of my list and I really think it's that special.
I:17943;5091;A commanding performance that gets better on repeat viewings.
I:17943;5092;Gestures, inflection, all of it.
I:17943;5093;beyond that, this continues Nolan's vision of Gotham, and it's a fantastically thrilling movie with great camera and stunt work, with a clever script in the hands of a more than capable group of actors.
I:17943;5094;Amazing film, very dissapointed that this film didn't include a director's commentary in the Special Features.
I:17943;5095;Amazon Instant Movies are the best and I can't wait to stream my next one.
I:17943;5096;I made it a night and watched The Dark Knight Rises afterwards.
I:17943;5097;It made for a great movie night.
I:17943;5098;Very good movie in my opinion.
I:17943;5099;The video was very crisp and clean.
I:17943;5100;Everything is here, viewers: good script, great direction and top notch CGI.
I:17943;5101;Just pop you some popcorn, kick up your feet and enjoy.
I:17943;5102;the movie itself as everyone already knows is great.
I:17943;5103;Easily best movie of 2008, and the most riveting comic book adaptation ever.
I:17943;5104;This was written as more of a detective or mob movie then a high flying special effects parade, and i loved that about it.
I:17943;5105;This is the Batman we love, faced with tough choices and personal turmoil he still must don the cape and do whats right.
I:17943;5106;welcome additions are Aaron Eckhart, and Maggie Gylenhaal.
I:17943;5107;maggie Gylenhaal takes over for Katie Holmes as The love interest for both Bruce Wayne and Harvey Dent.
I:17943;5108;It's a messy triangle, that is key to understanding the minds of Bruce Wayne and Two.
I:17943;5109;Heath, once again, dissapears and lets this creature run wild all over the film.
I:17943;5110;And what Makes the joker laugh.
I:17943;5111;He licks his facial wounds as a reminder of the monster he's become.
I:17943;5112;What a character to introduce and pit against the man of justice.
I:17943;5113;the action sequences are pretty killer, especially a car chase scene that introduces the bat.
I:17943;5114;The acting is top notch, and the story is really consuming.
I:17943;5115;the good news is that the movie exceded the hype.
I:17943;5116;The whole production should be regarded for it's work from the haunting score,screenplay, amazing direction, special effects and sound.
I:17943;5117;Instead, I received The Dark Knight, French.
I:17943;5118;amazon, when you use a second party to fulfill your orders, be honest and tell the customer exactly what they might receive.
I:17943;5119;the Dark Knight is unusually well crafted for a superhero/ action movie: I admire its restraint in not reveling in the violent aspects.
I:17943;5120;and I appreciate its ability to convey intensity and emotion without an excessive amount of swearing.
I:17943;5121;The Dark Knight is comprehensible to anyone with a basic understanding of the Batman mythos, or in other words to almost anybody anywhere.
I:17943;5122;This is by far one of the best movies DC comics has ever released or possibly any movie ever released.
I:17943;5123;But He did a fanstastic job in one of his final roles.
I:17943;5124;It's just kinda strange sounding and funny.
I:17943;5125;This is another world of improvement from Batman and Robin.
I:17943;5126;Once you've see it, that's enough.
I:17943;5127;This film has a great story, great actors, and great action.
I:17943;5128;face, and does a really good job, this was the first movie I'd seen him in, and he really brings life to these characters, and another special shoutout to Eric Roberts, who I always thought was an underrated actor anyways, he plays the mob family boss, and it really works well, just his appearence, and the way he talks, so whoever did the casting for this movie (as well as Batman Begins) does a great job.
I:17943;5129;ray, they look even more stunning, this is a great movie to show off on blu.
I:17943;5130;I have seen this movie five times, its just that good.
I:17943;5131;Rest in peace my friend.
I:17943;5132;"Love this movie and will get it when the real ""special edition""comes out!Completely pissed off just knowing blue ray gotted more special features."
I:17943;5133;This one was well done.
I:17943;5134;"batman has always been and will always be the most believable superhero of the plethora that exist because he isn't ""super."""
I:17943;5135;Batman Begins set up a hero grounded in real.
I:17943;5136;Forget that the continuity has been ruined for the Batman comics time and time again, the background of Bruce Wayne has never felt more realistic and full than it does now, thanks to Batman Begins.
I:17943;5137;The Joker is made real by a performance that is simply put, awe.
I:17943;5138;Ledger's characterization is both wretched and beautiful.
I:17943;5139;He takes a character already so well loved by the Batman fans worldwide and takes it as his own.
I:17943;5140;They are so perfect in their roles.
I:17943;5141;my favirote aspect of the two new Batman films is the perfect conjuction of writing and directing.
I:17943;5142;This team has to be commended for its work.
I:17943;5143;You have never seen a movie of this type with more suspense and intelligence in the way the events unfold.
I:17943;5144;Just got this and while it's one of the most amazing movies in recent memory, I have to say that the extra features are a big let down.
I:17943;5145;it's an OK movie, but that's all.
I:17943;5146;I am new the whole Blu Ray thing, but I've found out early that some movies can transform your living area into a movie theatre.
I:17943;5147;This is one of those movies.
I:17943;5148;The scenes shot in the IMAX format are amazing and ledger's portrayal of the Joker will forever make this a must own.
I:17943;5149;this film has some amazing special effects, excellent performances by two great actors, playing the roles of a major character (the late Heath Ledger), and a minor one (the wonderful Michael Caine), and competent work by everybody else.
I:17943;5150;there is humor, unremittingly black, delivered non.
I:17943;5151;But that is all the humor there is.
I:17943;5152;And it does so without the saving grace of a young Michelle Pfeiffer cavorting in a tight Catwoman costume.
I:17943;5153;fist boxing to fully enjoy this movie, but it might help.
I:17943;5154;The real issue is whether violence is there as just one ingredient in an ingenious mix of dark and light, sweet and sour, spiced with brilliant dialog and some hot ass.
I:17943;5155;kicking beauties, as in most QT's movies, or .
I:17943;5156;One of my favorite movies.
I:17943;5157;Never gest old and has some of the best lines
I:17943;5158;I absolutely love this movie and could watch it over and over again.
I:17943;5159;Great plot, actors were involve in their own personal paradigma.
I:17943;5160;The joker made Batman to look interesting, and enigmatic.
I:17943;5161;This movie is by far one of the best Batman movies ever made.
I:17943;5162;A must have movie if you are a Batman fan.
I:17943;5163;Great movie, brilliant director, awesome actors.
I:17943;5164;The movie is all metaphor, and some action sequences.
I:17943;5165;"As with all the other ""comic."
I:17943;5166;"e"", clear winner of the relevancy contest."
I:17943;5167;I heard a lot about The Dark Knight since it was released in 2008 and it exceeded expectations.
I:17943;5168;I was pleasantly surprised by the complex character development of Harvey Dent and the Joker and the film overall was outstanding.
I:17943;5169;my favorite movie of all time, but the set itself is great too.
I:17943;5170;It'll be the best $7.49 you ever spend.
I:17943;5171;The movie looks fantastic and there are really a lot of special features.
I:17943;5172;christian Bail is a great actor.
I:17943;5173;It was a good movie to watch again.
I:17943;5174;It's clear why this is a great movie and why it won lots of awards.
I:17943;5175;I absolutely love this movie, so I not only ordered one for my daughter for Christmas but ordered one for myself just because.
I:17943;5176;My opinion, best Batman movie ever!!!
I:17943;5177;this was a very exciting movie and I loved it but I'm not sure how old kids should be to watch it because it has some strong violent scenes but nothing more than they see on TV.
I:17943;5178;Mob activity is at an all time high even with the work Batman has completed.
I:17943;5179;"i have to throw in with the masses on this one and say that ""The Dark Knight"" is a great movie."
I:17943;5180;This is a suitable environment however in which to introduce Batman's most notable nemesis the Joker.
I:17943;5181;the Good: Great acting all around.
I:17943;5182;Heath Ledger left us with a masterful performance and I feel for any actor who attempts the role of the Joker in the future as he will have some big shoes to fill.
I:17943;5183;the cinematography for this film worked for me.
I:17943;5184;overall: Batman fans and non Batman fans alike should give this a watch.
I:17943;5185;The Dark Knight is definitely with checking out.
I:17943;5186;mart for the price to come down but it is still $20+ there and I got it brand new from Amazon.
I:17943;5187;Also it is a Great action movie
I:17943;5188;"This movie was very good
I:17943;5189;The acting was also very good, especially Heath Ledger.
I:17943;5190;As far as I'm concerned, this was a perfect Batman movie.
I:17943;5191;I am just blown away by the brilliance of Christopher Nolan's masterpiece.
I:17943;5192;the Nolan brothers and David Goyer created a story that is wonderfully complex and truly gripping.
I:17943;5193;It's much closer to art.
I:17943;5194;The screenplay says so many intriguing things about humanity.
I:17943;5195;If anything, this just proves how relevant Batman continues to be, generation after generation.
I:17943;5196;Film by film, Nolan's been cementing himself as one of the great directors of our time.
I:17943;5197;these are all amazing, top.
I:17943;5198;And now, with The Dark Knight, I think everyone is going to finally realize just how good this guy is.
I:17943;5199;The score is very well done, too.
I:17943;5200;based theme for The Joker works exceptionally well.
I:17943;5201;The Dark Knight is a jolt of caffeine that keeps your heart racing from start to finish.
I:17943;5202;while the action sequences and stunts are amazing, the more intimate scenes are the heart of the film.
I:17943;5203;As a prime example, an interrogation scene between The Batman and The Joker honestly just shocked me.
I:17943;5204;I figured their interaction would be good.
I:17943;5205;but it's much, much better than that.
I:17943;5206;It's amazing to see such great character work in a blockbuster.
I:17943;5207;And not only is it great character work, but the fabled complex relationship between Batman and The Joker is portrayed perfectly.
I:17943;5208;Talk about a Batman fan's dream come true.
I:17943;5209;After this performance, The Joker is definitely Ledger's.
I:17943;5210;He's somehow managed to pull off being funny, sadistic, charismatic, and downright frightening all at once.
I:17943;5211;That, my friends, is The Joker.
I:17943;5212;And most importantly, this Joker is the perfect opposition for The Batman.
I:17943;5213;Everyone's talking posthumous Oscar for Heath and I sure hope he not only gets nominated, but that he wins.
I:17943;5214;This performance is just that good.
I:17943;5215;i also really, really appreciate the other new central character: Aaron Eckhart's performance as Harvey Dent and Two.
I:17943;5216;I have to give some serious credit to the writers here, as well, for adapting the character so well.
I:17943;5217;The tragic side of the character comes across perfectly.
I:17943;5218;The rest of the performances are solid, too.
I:17943;5219;I love the way Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, and Morgan Freeman have elevated these films.
I:17943;5220;These guys are some of the best we have and never seem to disappoint.
I:17943;5221;Also, Maggie Gyllenhaal is a welcome addition to the cast replacing Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes.
I:17943;5222;Going in, I think I would've preferred Katie Holmes to stick around just for continuity sake, but Gyllenhaal does such a fine job that it's really not an issue.
I:17943;5223;Christian Bale is just an excellent Bruce Wayne.
I:17943;5224;"He's perfected the ""fake Bruce Wayne"" by acting like a silly rich drunkard, womanizer, and egomaniac."
I:17943;5225;He's hilarious a lot of the time, but we never forget just how selfless of an act it really is.
I:17943;5226;He also embodies the real Bruce Wayne which only Alfred and Rachel (and Fox to some degree) truly know.
I:17943;5227;And last, but definitely not least, he's a heck of a Batman.
I:17943;5228;In The Dark Knight, you can tell Batman is maturing.
I:17943;5229;He's becoming the signature Batman who pushes the line of what's decent and acceptable.
I:17943;5230;He walks the razor's edge every night.
I:17943;5231;He's also becoming more self.
I:17943;5232;As for the title of the film: Batman truly becomes The Dark Knight in this story.
I:17943;5233;And the decision he makes at the end of the film is one of the most refreshing takes on heroism and selflessness that I've ever seen put on film.
I:17943;5234;Those are fantastic films that I could watch over and over again.
I:17943;5235;But I'm going to go ahead and say it: this is the best film I've ever seen.
I:17943;5236;combined with my love of the Batman character and his world leave me completely unable to say otherwise.
I:17943;5237;The film also, of course, dethrones the great Batman Begins as my favorite film of all.
I:17943;5238;"Begins did a magnificent job exploring the origins of the character, but along with its main theme, ""escalation,"" The Dark Knight just takes things to a whole new level."
I:17943;5239;It is kind of funny when you read what people have to say about this movie.
I:17943;5240;Nolan starts with a number of threads at the beginning and brings them all together by the mid.
I:17943;5241;"He delivered the most chillingly real picture of evil on the screen since Hopkins in ""The Silence of the Lambs."""
I:17943;5242;The performance was picture perfect, from the designer suits, to the unkept hair, to the tick of sticking out his tongue like a serpent.
I:17943;5243;The special effects are fantastic, but they never become a crutch for Nolan because at its heart this is a character study.
I:17943;5244;If a company is going to market a special edition and charge you more for it, it should be bursting with extra stuff.
I:17943;5245;This was actually the first of the 'modern' Batman movies that I'd seen.
I:17943;5246;The performances where amazing all around.
I:17943;5247;The Dark Knight is one of the best superhero movies I've ever seen!
I:17943;5248;It's also an excellent movie.
I:17943;5249;he himself doesn't make plans, you see.
I:17943;5250;Oh, and to scare people.
I:17943;5251;i enjoyed Ledger's performance, though it seemed a bit lacking in depth.
I:17943;5252;One of the smartest adaptations I have seen.
I:17943;5253;Lots of high definition growling and a guy with green hair and face paint.
I:17943;5254;An opening sequence that pulls you in and fun villains in clown masks to start us off.
I:17943;5255;Great sweeping shots throughout the film of the city.
I:17943;5256;You could put the music over an old lady walking and make it intriguing.
I:17943;5257;This one is hard to top.
I:17943;5258;Probably my favorite comic movie to come out in the past ten years.
I:17943;5259;The price was great and I was very happy.
I:17943;5260;Best movie ever in my book own it love it.
I:17943;5261;he plays the joker to the extreme and delivers a Oscar performance.
I:17943;5262;Amazing action and just pure adrenaline throughout.
I:17943;5263;The film takes us on a hellish nihilistic ride that is never soothing yet somehow manages to be darkly beautiful and strangely entertaining.
I:17943;5264;or watching good guy Harvey Dent's fall from grace.
I:17943;5265;Either way, both are more important to the core of this film than the hero, Batman.
I:17943;5266;But before the world burns, you must watch this movie.
I:17943;5267;It is great it has everything you would want in a Batman movie.
I:17943;5268;It was one of those movies that I thought Heath Ledger won the academy award as a sympathy vote.
I:17943;5269;He was scary good and deserved to win.
I:17943;5270;Take a hero with superhuman powers (yea!)
I:17943;5271;Premise, plot line, ending . . . dark through and through.
I:17943;5272;I think this is one of the greatest movies ever made.
I:17943;5273;The Joker is a real trip.
I:17943;5274;I have seen all the batman movies made to date, and this is one of the better ones.
I:17943;5275;It is a well directed and acted movie with a gripping storyline and excellent special effects.
I:17943;5276;Heath Ledger's performance complimented Christian Bale's Batman!
I:17943;5277;Great Movie, not for Kids.
I:17943;5278;my husband loved it as a Christmas present.
I:17943;5279;I wish he could keep the series going and going past the upcoming the dark Knight rises but, excellent work clap clap whistle.
I:17943;5280;Few films have ever approached the epic scope of this one.
I:17943;5281;I have referenced this work like a great epic of literature many times since.
I:17943;5282;I took my kids to see this when it came out in theatre.
I:17943;5283;It followed so masterfully from the first movie into the second one and Dark Knight ended with what you know will be another 1st class sequel.
I:17943;5284;christian Bale is probably now my favorite Batman character of all of the previous ones.
I:17943;5285;I've seen him in several other movies and have become a big fan anyways, but he really does a great job in these two movies.
I:17943;5286;enough has been said about Heath and what this movie did to him, but I loved him long before Dark Knight.
I:17943;5287;It was directed well, superbly acted, and truly showed a friendship between two men.
I:17943;5288;Heath Ledger was a wonderful person, great actor, and I will dearly miss seeing him on the big screen.
I:17943;5289;the remaining actors they chose for the first one and this sequel were excellent choices: Michael Caine, Eric Roberts, Gary Oldman, and of course Maggie Gylenhall, only to name a few of my faves.
I:17943;5290;Maggie replaced her predecessor very well in this flick and honestly, I liked her portrayal of Rachael better.
I:17943;5291;My son bought this, so it was what he wanted.
I:17943;5292;Got it down to Australia within two weeks (surface mail) they said it would take upto four weeks, so I was very happy with the service.
I:17943;5293;94% positive reviews at Rotten Tomatoes.
I:17943;5294;remembering Batman Begins I was thinking that Nolan must have done an excellent job once again.
I:17943;5295;I knew it was long so I waited.
I:17943;5296;Hard to believe it's from the same director.
I:17943;5297;Boy, do we love melodrama!
I:17943;5298;Great story, great performances, great action pieces!
I:17943;5299;bearing melodrama with many great ideas that are pounded into our brain for almost 2 and half hours.
I:17943;5300;Nolan has taken the humour, the colour, the fun out of the previous Batman movie series, maybe that's why it's called The Dark Knight.
I:17943;5301;"I personally have a love and hate relationship with this movie
I:17943;5302;do things in this generation and this is the way I feel about this film.
I:17943;5303;In the end I do recommend it because my taste is only a small reflection of the hard work and imagination put into the film and this blu.
I:17943;5304;ray version offers great image and audio.
I:17943;5305;The original modern BATMAN with Michael Keaton remains one of my favorite comic book action movies.
I:17943;5306;cheek, tries to be much more witty, and succeeds much of the time.
I:17943;5307;Val Kilmer is OK as Bruce Wayne and Batman, but Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey are just out of their minds good as the evil nemeses of society and Batman.
I:17943;5308;Nicole Kidman, as we have become accustomed, is just perfect as Wayne's love interest.
I:17943;5309;"I don't rate this film very highly, probably ""7"" on a 10."
I:17943;5310;It's even better than Batman Begins.
I:17943;5311;this is a real batman movie.
I:17943;5312;and does an outstanding job.
I:17943;5313;the technology that batman uses has a wow factor, but is also technologically realistic.
I:17943;5314;Michael Cane also returns as an outstanding foil for the emotionally troubled crime fighter, as his butler Alfred.
I:17943;5315;The real star of this film.
I:17943;5316;Heath Ledger is a shoe in for an Oscar for best supporting actor.
I:17943;5317;It's hard to find in an age where profits are the bottom line for creating a movie, but this is a return to true cinema.
I:17943;5318;the real strength of this film, and to a lesser extent its predecessor, is how it explores the dynamics of personal responsibly, and that of society as a whole.
I:17943;5319;watch this movie and you'll understand.
I:17943;5320;after thirty years, we finally get to see the real Batman.
I:17943;5321;Wich is pretty much what I thought of Batman Begins, altough this one is better.
I:17943;5322;The main issue I have with the movie is Mr. Bale.
I:17943;5323;Heath Ledger's performance is very good, very frightening, altough not very humorous.
I:17943;5324;nolan is a good director and he made two good Batman movies, but I disagree when people say these are great.
I:17943;5325;I think he can still deliver a great movie if he manages to go deeper into the modern Batman persona, especially the way he was interpreted in the comics of the 90's, that would be a great reference.
I:17943;5326;This was a great movie to watch on my iPad while flying.
I:17943;5327;5 Stars, The Darkest Batman Ever and the Best by Far.
I:17943;5328;She and her brother Jake Gyllenhaal, have yet to find any acting skills.
I:17943;5329;Back to some of Best Actors in Hollywood in this movie.
I:17943;5330;Director Christopher Nolan has somewhat re.
I:17943;5331;But how's the home version?Technically it's fine.
I:17943;5332;It looks good but I can't comment on the sound.
I:17943;5333;the extra features however are amazing.
I:17943;5334;I love how the features look into arguably the two most interesting parts of Batman: his equipment and the character himself.
I:17943;5335;And the great part about the second one is that Batman's villains are also discussed.
I:17943;5336;i haven't tried out the feature that allows you to make your own commentary but the idea of it sounds cool.
I:17943;5337;Maybe one of the best action sequels ever.
I:17943;5338;I loved the Dark Knight and now with Rises out it is even better for the 1st movie.
I:17943;5339;the hero for the viewer is the joker .
I:17943;5340;he delivers such an amazing performance .
I:17943;5341;Some of the best acting around and the Joker is IT!
I:17943;5342;A modern movie should look much better than this.
I:17943;5343;The film is excellent, no mistake about that.
I:17943;5344;sighted misproduction of what could have been a wonderful customer experience.
I:17943;5345;It was packed well and arrived safely.
I:17943;5346;I was very pleased with every aspect of this transaction.
I:17943;5347;"oddly enough, this isn't the only saddening part about the film
I:17943;5348;for a film that's over 2 hours long it sure promised a lot, built up a great deal of expectations and then just completely fizzled by the end of it.
I:17943;5349;The Dark Knight is a visually stunning and well.
I:17943;5350;acted film that really does transcend the comic book genre.
I:17943;5351;It's the acting that will pull you in.
I:17943;5352;The cast is so good in this movie and not just Heath Ledger's Academy Award winning role as the Joker which is stellar itself.
I:17943;5353;Aaron Eckhart is equally magnificent as DA Harvey Dent, Gary Oldham is superb as police commissioner Gordon while Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman provide the backbone and base for the film.
I:17943;5354;Christian Bale does a good job as the Batman, but his role pales in comparison to work done by Mr. Ledger and Mr. Eckhart.
I:17943;5355;After all, the cast is impressive and other episodes have done fairly well.
I:17943;5356;Both Cristian Bale and Heath Ledger gave outstanding starring performances, with Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman also appearing at the top of their craft.
I:17943;5357;ray is packed with some great stuff.
I:17943;5358;This is one of the best Batman films to ever come out.
I:17943;5359;The disturbingly yet amazing dark performance from Heath Ledger makes The Dark Knight a must own blu.
I:17943;5360;live which allows users with web.
I:17943;5361;ray players to access exciting additional content and connect and share with other BD.
I:17943;5362;One final note is that The Dark Knight marks the first time that a major feature film has been shot in part using IMAX cameras, marking a revolutionary integration of film formats.
I:17943;5363;ray disc takes advantage of the marriage of IMAX and 35mm formats by using the hybrid master to replicate the unique theatrical experience.
I:17943;5364;The IMAX scenes are also included on the 2.
I:17943;5365;ray and see how this movie will do for blu.
I:17943;5366;Director Christopher Nolan and creative collaborators unmask the incredible detail and planning behind the film, including stunt staging, filming in IMAX, and the new Bat.
I:17943;5367;Delve into the psyche of Bruce Wayne and the world of Batman through real.
I:17943;5368;This movie is one of my favorites of all time.
I:17943;5369;The twist at the end was incredible, and the music is intense.
I:17943;5370;The best part of this is that it comes at a price of under ten dollars!
I:17943;5371;At this price maybe more people will fall in love with the franchise and make this new Batman even more popular.
I:17943;5372;The only movie of the Dark Knight trilogy that I did not see in the theatre, The Dark Knight is one of my favorite movies ever.
I:17943;5373;When I orginally watched the movie I thought it was OK.
I:17943;5374;When you watch the movie you see an actor acting the Two Face.
I:17943;5375;"I was really surprised to find this on Amazon for $8 from a partner seller, but it has been a great deal
I:17943;5376;Sorry I am keeping this short but this was a great movie.
I:17943;5377;This was an incredible movie.
I:17943;5378;I've seen it 5 times and will watch it many more.
I:17943;5379;If you have a 40 inch or better tv with surround sound you will love it even more.
I:17943;5380;Joker is memorable and batman does his thing.
I:17943;5381;it doesnt even feel like a comic thats how good it is.
I:17943;5382;It's one of the best superhero movies to date (depending on whether or not you like the recent Marvel movies more).
I:17943;5383;ray a must have if that not only is it great looking, but it also presents the IMAX scenes throughout the movie seemlessly.
I:17943;5384;This was the best role Keith Ledger played.
I:17943;5385;We watched all three of these new Batman movies over a couple of evenings and enjoy them all.
I:17943;5386;Christian Bale is a bit of a whiner but he does a decent job as Batman.
I:17943;5387;Some cool gadgets and machines too.
I:17943;5388;Christian Bale is the best Batman and Heath Ledger played an awesome Joker.
I:17943;5389;Great movie, cool effects, awesome soundtrack.
I:17943;5390;The Dark Knight is an incredible movie.
I:17943;5391;heath Ledger's performance was diabolical and magical.
I:17943;5392;Ledger gave the Joker a chilling vulnerability and brilliant evil that made watching him a sheer delight.
I:17943;5393;face was equally spectacular while Christian Bale, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman and Michael Caine more than held their own in their reprised characters.
I:17943;5394;maggie Gyllenhall's Rachel was a seamless portrayal and maintained the fiestiness and independent stubborness of Katie Holmes' Rachel.
I:17943;5395;In a male dominated film, Gyllenhall nicely stood out.
I:17943;5396;the Dark Knight is a movie I'll watch again and again.
I:17943;5397;I loved this movie the joker was the star.
I:17943;5398;Batman is back with a vengeance!
I:17943;5399;Everyone did an awesome job, especially Heath Ledger as the psychopathic Joker!
I:17943;5400;The Joker is both funny and scary.
I:17943;5401;core Batman fans, you'll love THE DARK KNIGHT!!!
I:17943;5402;Well, you get a brilliant film (probably the best in 2008).
I:17943;5403;This rates a F in my view
I:17943;5404;This was an outstanding Batman movie.
I:17943;5405;lots of action and great special effects.
I:17943;5406;My family really enjoyed it.
I:17943;5407;Nolan proved himself more than capable with his first stab at DCs' iconic hero, and has again made the case that he should be the only director allowed near the Batman universe.
I:17943;5408;His minimal use of CG, the excellent script and stuntwork alone make his Dark Knight definitive, but it is his work with the actors and their dialogue that make this a special film.
I:17943;5409;The photography coupled with a complex and involving screenplay that wrings every bit of character development possible out of everyone involved leaves the viewer slightly out of breath and awed by the end of this truly spectacular summer movie event.
I:17943;5410;No digital blur here, and no flies either just spectacular performances (Oldman, Ledger, Eckhart) and a truly fufilling cinematic Batman experience.
I:17943;5411;What is happening with the world and it's understanding of what makes a great film or a classic?
I:17943;5412;The past few years have given the world a whole slew of highly praised films that are pretty much just good but not great.
I:17943;5413;Gary Oldman, a wonderful actor, is lovable but miscast as Gordon in my opinion.
I:17943;5414;Heath Ledger(R. i. p)is brilliant but not anywhere as interesting as Nicholson's rendering of the character.
I:17943;5415;But Nicholson's Joker was wonderful.
I:17943;5416;Both of Burton's Batman films were full of movie magic, memorable action, well cast actors, twists and turns at every corner, and lots and lots of some of the finest film making ever done for a comic book to screen movie.
I:17943;5417;"i absolutely cannot believe how many people have called this film ""The greatest film of the year"", ""The best movie I have ever seen"", ""A masterpiece""."
I:17943;5418;It's awesome for Batman fans and people have never read a comic book.
I:17943;5419;The build up of the Harvey Dent character is equally entertaining as the storyline with The Joker.
I:17943;5420;Katie Holmes' replacement Maggie Gyllenhaal does an amazing job playing Rachel Dawes.
I:17943;5421;It's not as stylized as Burton's Gotham City, but it's an awesome film that is more realistic.
I:17943;5422;best yet of any batmans created.
I:17943;5423;excellent performances and great cast(except for rachel, once again that performance falls flat).
I:17943;5424;storyline keeps your attention through to the end.
I:17943;5425;The movie was great and it didnt take long to get here.
I:17943;5426;you've probably already seen the movie, so you know it's good :)I bought it as a gold box deal.
I:17943;5427;Riddled with action, sinister humor and the internal battle to kill or to show mercy.
I:17943;5428;Heath Ledger is the true star of the movie with his portrayal of The Joker
I:17943;5429;Great movie, definitely worth the money.
I:17943;5430;Finally the real batman movie, this one has met all of the standards of the comic.
I:17943;5431;Excellent acting and a wonderful movie.
I:17943;5432;"ray ""The Dark Knight"" has a perfect audio and video."
I:17943;5433;It has language options which is always good.
I:17943;5434;I enjoyed the Dark Knight, including the late Heath Ledger who played the Joker and Christian Bale who played Batman.
I:17943;5435;The perfect mix of action, drama, twists, and even some occasional humor.
I:17943;5436;Unarguable perfect performance from Heath Ledger and the rest of the actors involved didn't disappoint either.
I:17943;5437;I bought this for my nephew and he loved it.
I:17943;5438;I bought him all the batman movies, he is a big fan.
I:17943;5439;Very cool movie especially in the widescreen version.
I:17943;5440;The price was definitely reasonable
I:17943;5441;After hearing and reading all that is said about the Dark Knight, I can add that there are strong performances from all actors.
I:17943;5442;Nevertheless, Batman is as mysterious as ever, showing his human weaknesses, which makes him more charming.
I:17943;5443;"Lucius Fox, gadget genius, is dedicated to always doing the ""right thing,"" and solidifies the trio of himself, Batman, and Alfred, the manservant, who all work together to keep Batman alive."
I:17943;5444;all in all, this is a great movie.
I:17943;5445;sized theater screen is probably just as good.
I:17943;5446;This film would be great viewing on even an iPod.
I:17943;5447;in conclusion, The Dark Knight is like a finely blended alcoholic cocktail, made with 200 Proof liquor (100% liquor) and fresh fruit juices.
I:17943;5448;I left the theater feeling a little more deranged by the dynamic sounds, visions, and morality of it all.
I:17943;5449;There are plenty of fun extra things on the second disc, and of course the movie itself is superb.
I:17943;5450;i chalk it up to the whole country being shook up and ill.
I:17943;5451;In addition to getting a great movie this package included a second special features disc AND a digital copy.
I:17943;5452;I loved every part of this movie, from beginning to end, The Joker was an excellent villain, and extremely well played.
I:17943;5453;Harvey Dent came across as terrific, and a very likeable character!
I:17943;5454;There were so many twist's and turn's in this movie that I was on the edge of my seat during the whole thing!
I:17943;5455;I got to see a more personal side of Batman, his emotions, and how much he actually cares about people, and of course some interesting gadgets.
I:17943;5456;I would also like to add, I thought the character behind Lt. Gordon was very inspiring and clever.
I:17943;5457;All in all this is a terrific movie, I would highly recommend it to everyone, However there are some horrific scenes that might not be suitable for children, But I leave that up to your discretion.
I:17943;5458;Let's get one thing out of the way: this movie is terrific.
I:17943;5459;Easily the best superhero movie ever made.
I:17943;5460;Although it's pretty small, the batpod does look cool while the logo behind contains the discs itself.
I:17943;5461;"ray casing, which features a ""Jokerized"" description of the movie such as the words ""HAHA"" written all over the case as well as a smile drawn over Batmans picture."
I:17943;5462;Overall, this is a unique item, but it's one I could've lived without.
I:17943;5463;I think I actually enjoyed the film the first time, because it had good action.
I:17943;5464;This one is better because it's more entertaining.
I:17943;5465;this role solidifies his stance as one of todays best young actors, if not the best.
I:17943;5466;this movie managed to balance so many elements and still be completely tangable.
I:17943;5467;this is a whole new bat man, a much darker, down to earth series than we've seen before.
I:17943;5468;well, as down to earth as a movie about a bat.
I:17943;5469;The Joker can take batmans greatest power, Fear, which is crippling for most men, and laugh in his face.
I:17943;5470;the acting, camera work, effects, and story are all beyond superb, and worthy of many viewings.
I:17943;5471;ive already seen it twice since opening, and plan to at least once more.
I:17943;5472;i guarantee most of you will be back to see it again.
I:17943;5473;At the time of writing this, I have not seen the third installment of the trilogy (Dark Knight Rises), but this is such a great movie.
I:17943;5474;The late Heath Ledger performed at his very best in this film and it's one of my favorite batman films ever (along with the Michael Keaton films).
I:17943;5475;Easily the greatest comicbook movie and one of the best movies, period.
I:17943;5476;Very well written and acted.
I:17943;5477;I love watching this movie.
I:17943;5478;This should be a good wake up call to people.
I:17943;5479;overall wonderful performance by Heath Ledger.
I:17943;5480;This sequel surpasses the original with great acting.
I:17943;5481;This Joker is really scary, overshadows the Jack portrayal, and steals the acting kudos.
I:17943;5482;i dont care if you are a dc fan boy or a marvel fan boy.
I:17943;5483;I dont care if you have never read a comie or if you are a hardcore marvel fan this is a movie you should see just so you could see how superhero movies could and should be done right a great cast, great effects and one of the most iconic depictions of the joker you will ever see this is one of the best superhero movies done
I:17943;5484;I remember hat I liked the movie very much, but I think your asking me to review the movie before I have received it in the mail, is a bit pre.
I:17943;5485;If you liked 'Batman Begins' you'll like 'The Dark Knight.'
I:17943;5486;First I will say this movie is great!
I:17943;5487;this was a Christmas gift.
I:17943;5488;I will see if I can exchange it.
I:17943;5489;i loved the THE DARK KNIGHT film very much when it came out.
I:17943;5490;but jeez Warner Brothers, ya gotta bring Miller's comic graphic novel to the big screen!
I:17943;5491;Heath Ledger's performance in this movie is the whole reason I bought it.
I:17943;5492;I love his interpretation of The Joker.
I:17943;5493;I'm so glad I bought this movie.
I:17943;5494;Really great Batman movie especially for the price/ value.
I:17943;5495;Superhero fans will be extremely pleased and not have many objections
I:17943;5496;One of the best movies of the year and unquestionably the best Batman ever.
I:17943;5497;This was Heath Ledger's ninth symphony and a final tribute to this great actor.
I:17943;5498;Nice special effects, but those don't make a movie.
I:17943;5499;other reviews say this is the best Batman movie to date.
I:17943;5500;The Dark Knight is an amazing work of art.
I:17943;5501;the best thing about this disc, as with any Blu.
I:17943;5502;ray disc I imagine, is the crisp vibrant clarity it offers.
I:17943;5503;ray player the movie starts up right away and the menu can be called up by just pressing the menu button on your remote.
I:17943;5504;I love this feature, and it make sense to me, since I'm the type that doesn't want to be bothered with previews and menus anyway.
I:17943;5505;The special features can be integrated into the film, which I also love as I have a desire to know every single behind the scenes moment of all my favorite films.
I:17943;5506;The special features are good enough that I'm sure they will please most fans.
I:17943;5507;"Great movie
I:17943;5508;ray edition of this movie looks and sounds great.
I:17943;5509;It's very cool how the opening scenes that were shot in IMAX come accoss in their native aspec ratio and then the film switches to the Buly.
I:17943;5510;The best super hero comic movie.
I:17943;5511;I love the Batman story and I think they have done an unbelievable job creating a realistic, dark hero.
I:17943;5512;but still a great movie
I:17943;5513;It's a new modern twist that all super hero fans can enjoy.
I:17943;5514;ray] is a wonderful progression in the ongoing tales.
I:17943;5515;If there's one movie that will make you cry, laugh, have you on the edge of the seat, and disturb you, it is The Dark Knight.
I:17943;5516;The movie definitely had LOTS of action as well as great drama.
I:17943;5517;I won't go into any plot details, because the plot is a big part of the movie, but I'll say this: Ledger's performance is fantastic, the best performance I've ever seen in a movie.
I:17943;5518;This is one I can see multiple times.
I:17943;5519;Although it is rated PG here, this is definitely NOT for kids here.
I:17943;5520;Some scenes are very dark, and some are very disturbing, but that's a good thing.
I:17943;5521;All in all, The Dark Knight is a dark and melancholy masterpiece filled with action and great acting too.
I:17943;5522;I was saddened by this because a lot of good comic book movies were coming out and yet I still had not seen a Batman movie the way I thought it should be.
I:17943;5523;I saw it at midnight showing and was glued to my seat.
I:17943;5524;This movie was so good I went and saw it again the following morning.
I:17943;5525;To me he was perfect.
I:17943;5526;Aaron Echart also did a terrific job as Harvey Dent/Two.
I:17943;5527;face should have been in it a bit more his presense was great and he is the best looking/scariest Two.
I:17943;5528;face I have ever seen.
I:17943;5529;Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel was also great.
I:17943;5530;She did a great job and much better than Katie Holmes.
I:17943;5531;Casting Maggie in this movie was a good move.
I:17943;5532;I also respect that she had to fill the shoes of someone who had played her before and give off existing feelings for Bruce wayne, I felt she did that very well and I had no problem accepting her as Rachel.
I:17943;5533;Miahcal Caine and Morgan Freeman always do an outstanding job and they continue to do so in this movie.
I:17943;5534;This movie has a lot of emotion in it, it shows the best and the worst parts of all of us but in the end shows we can be great.
I:17943;5535;One thing that is interesting is some shots are filmed on an Imax camera.
I:17943;5536;I think this superhero epic was well made and excellent in high definition.
I:17943;5537;I payed approximately $6.00 and it was well worth it.
I:17943;5538;The Dark Knight is brilliant.
I:17943;5539;this is the Superhero flick evolved: once thirty minutes or so of screen time elapses the realisation suddenly dawns on you that this is A. not just another flashy movie full of staid dialogue and cheesy FX, and B. it's extremely enjoyable.
I:17943;5540;faced, unpretentious way of showcasing the blazing action set.
I:17943;5541;in scenes of human conflict, is excellent: there are no cheap camera tricks (or at least, no noticeable ones) here and Nolan manages to create a very real sense of Gotham.
I:17943;5542;The breathless excitement in the film's opening bank sequence sets the tone: without any help from fake.
I:17943;5543;looking CGI we're thrown headlong and without explanation into the midst of a very tense and visually pleasing robbery set.
I:17943;5544;Happily, most of the rest of the movie follows suit.
I:17943;5545;But that's a small quibble: Bale is a very great actor and does a very great job as Gotham's protector.
I:17943;5546;"gary Oldman, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman make for a skilled and hugely successful supporting team: their roles are small and somewhat perfunctory but the actors don't let them slide as such
I:17943;5547;Maggie Gyllenhaal is similarly memorable as assistant D. a. Rachel Dawes: her interrogation scene, as one example, shows Rachel as a powerful, intelligent, bright woman, and this provides a great counterpoint to Bale's Bruce Wayne.
I:17943;5548;"Aaron Eckhart is a truly great Harvey Dent, there's no sentimental or cloying ""Good Guy"" aspects to his thoroughly good."
I:17943;5549;"as a secondary villain in a movie whose cast roster is already overflowing Eckhart's talent means Harvey Dent is one of ""The Dark Knight's"" more memorable characters."
I:17943;5550;joker is whole and satisfying and enthralling, and Ledger's performance should get him awards.
I:17943;5551;I didn't once think of Heath Ledger when watching the Joker, and, considering the tragedy surrounding the actor, that's high praise indeed: Ledger's strength of performance lifts you out of reality and throws you into the madness that is Gotham City at his mercy.
I:17943;5552;coloured glasses for the actor himself: he's incredible, and brilliant.
I:17943;5553;Music is occasional and beautiful, James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer are to be congratulated on a fine and affecting score to match a fine and affecting movie.
I:17943;5554;"Nathan Crowley's production design continues a trend from ""Batman Begins"" ."
I:17943;5555;The Dark Knight looks mostly plausible and very real.
I:17943;5556;particularly since Aaron Eckhart's just so very good in the role .
I:17943;5557;"and particularly so, since ""Batman Begins"" was in large part about dealing with interpersonal relationships and how they affect us."
I:17943;5558;"As is, ""The Dark Knight"" is a truly brilliant experience ."
I:17943;5559;I can't recommend this one highly enough: definitely my best summer movie and one of the best I've seen all year.
I:17943;5560;If you grew up reading the comics, then you will understand what this picture means to the world of comic book movies.
I:17943;5561;The video arrived before the intended date and was in great condition.
I:17943;5562;I would recommend working with this company.
I:17943;5563;this is one of the best movies i've seen in yrs!!!
I:17943;5564;The action is awesome and the acting was wonderful!!
I:17943;5565;He is so menacing yet so likeable.
I:17943;5566;Great addition to my collection.
I:17943;5567;love the score, love the costumes, love the script, loved the villains.
I:17943;5568;An epic action movie, a superbly acted ensemble piece, a dark crime drama, a rumination on the consequences of our choices and actions, and a story about a guy dressing up like a bat, THE DARK KNIGHT is all of these and more.
I:17943;5569;Chris Nolan has created a work that will stand with THE GODFATHER PART 2 and THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK as sequels that best their predecessors emotionally and artistically.
I:17943;5570;An astounding achievement that puts all other films based on the characters created in the comics and graphic novels to shame.
I:17943;5571;Great movie at a great price.
I:17943;5572;Bought if for my husband he loved it.
I:17943;5573;the opening action sequence reflects this workman.
I:17943;5574;"The Joker should have committed, real random acts of crime for the sake of his own pleasure, a perverted ""clown"" who decided that has his fun with the public and the Batman."
I:17943;5575;"remarkably
I:17943;5576;"entity in this film who, like everyone else in this film, LOVES spouting the obvious like ""You thought we could be decent men in an indecent time."
I:17943;5577;"Hollywood needs to see that just because a handsome man is with a beautiful woman, that is enough to call it a ""relationship""."
I:17943;5578;A fine action film with some spectacular stunts, some of the most creative years, but a very shallow film that tries to be a lot more than it is.
I:17943;5579;This is an excellent movie.
I:17943;5580;In blue ray you Can see a perfect image and great sound.
I:17943;5581;It all seems like it was yesterday, and I feel like Heath Ledger is still alive.
I:17943;5582;the whole cast shines here.
I:17943;5583;christian Bale was perfect in Batman Begins, and here he continues to impress.
I:17943;5584;His Batman is what we all waited to see on the big screen: haunting!
I:17943;5585;Bale gives Batman the right feel, the right personality, he simply shines on this role.
I:17943;5586;"It's very beautiful how, in the end, he decided to turn into the ""bad guy"" to save everyone and to save the image and reputation of that man who in that moment was the hero the city needs, and not what it deserves."
I:17943;5587;He becomes a truly Dark Knight.
I:17943;5588;Bravo!As for Ledger, his incarnation of the Joker is masterful!
I:17943;5589;It won a well deserved Golden Globe and an Oscar.
I:17943;5590;His Joker is haunting, scaring, funny in a dark sense.
I:17943;5591;as for the other cast, Aaron Eckhart is a very competent Harvey Dent and the perfect incarnation of Two.
I:17943;5592;Oldman is the perfect Gordon, and he shows that since Batman Begins.
I:17943;5593;Maggie stands as the best version of Rachel Dawes.
I:17943;5594;Cillian Murphy returns as the Scarecrow and continues to do his wonderful job he started in Begins.
I:17943;5595;all in all, this is a truly masterpiece of crime, drama and tragedy.
I:17943;5596;A dark masterpiece, inspired by the bonds of the very best noir and police productions of all time.
I:17943;5597;I Loved Batman The Dark Knight it because it was in blu ray and everyone should watch and own it.
I:17943;5598;This movie is awesome, it was a great price and the seller shipped it super fast!
I:17943;5599;A very exciting storyline with great acting and keeps the underlying sub.
I:17943;5600;plots mysterious attention glued throughout the movie.
I:17943;5601;I think all the actors played a great job.
I:17943;5602;This is one of my favorite Dark Knight movies, I receommed it, the Joker is the real deal
I:17943;5603;This is a Batman / Joker pair that made me sit on the edge on my seat all through the movie, as I went there under an invite from my baby girl.
I:17943;5604;Surprise twists and turns in the plot were great.
I:17943;5605;Danny DiVito can always crack you up, so his part was just mediocre anyway.
I:17943;5606;"i was saddened by the news of this guy's death, but he brought this onto himself, another gift from HOLLYWOOD!But I applaud his representation of the ""Joker"" the best ever, no ""pows."
I:17943;5607;Got the movie in new condition in a timely manner.
I:17943;5608;great movie a darker version of Batman, a Joker that let you see how he was original conceived in the comics
I:17943;5609;Everything about it is fantastic.
I:17943;5610;My whole goal is to make it so that my family and I (kids are still very young.
I:17943;5611;No one can deny the incredible performance of Ledger in this movie, but that shouldn't overshadow the fact that this was the best movie of 2008 period.
I:17943;5612;"It transcends the genre typecasting of ""comic book"" movie, and becomes something bigger, better, more mythological."
I:17943;5613;I absolutely loved this movie.
I:17943;5614;dark Knight has excellent acting and production values.
I:17943;5615;Heath Ledger's performance is extraordinary and he deserved his posthumous Oscar.
I:17943;5616;superman (1978) and SpiderMan 2(2004) are still the best superhero movies of all time.
I:17943;5617;This is just good, not great.
I:17943;5618;oh yeah, the Batman suit is much better this time.
I:17943;5619;Though not the best movie of all times this is definitely one of the best ones of the last few years.
I:17943;5620;the steelbook special edition of Batman Begins was definitely a must if you are only mildly interested in how movies are made and how much in spite of all the great things you can do digitally is still done 'practical' (may be the other way round for some directors).
I:17943;5621;The information you get on the Bat Pod is good, and so is the description of the redesign of the Bat Suit.
I:17943;5622;my conclusion: Watch and enjoy the movie but don't expect too much from this edition.
I:17943;5623;"Director Christopher Nolan and star Christian Bale continue to keep the Batman franchise strong in the highly anticipated summer blockbuster ""The Dark Knight""."
I:17943;5624;The Dark Knight is a thrilling and fully engrossing comic book spectacle that ranks as one of the best films of 2008.
I:17943;5625;With its well crafted storyline, serious tone and strong moral dilemmas, director Christopher Nolan delivers an exciting thrill ride that truly redefines the standards of the comic book movie.
I:17943;5626;The action sequences and visual effects are excellent.
I:17943;5627;Christian Bale and Heath Ledger give memorable performances.
I:17943;5628;The cast also includes Maggie Gyllenhaal, Eric Roberts, Nestor Carbonell, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine.
I:17943;5629;This is one great looking Blu.
I:17943;5630;scenes featurette that offers abundant information in the development of the movie.
I:17943;5631;"Though an audio commentary track would have been a good addition, ""The Dark Knight"" really shines on Blu."
I:17943;5632;"ray and scores an ""A""."
I:17943;5633;The Dark Knight is not only the best sequel, it's arguably the best comic book adaptation ever made.
I:17943;5634;The Dark Knight has so much more to like than the average comic book film.
I:17943;5635;From the start we are introduced to him in the midst of a well planned, and well choreographed bank heist, shot with state of the art IMAZ cameras.
I:17943;5636;That is definitely cinematography at its absolute best, thanks to not only Chris Nolan, but also his DP, Wally Pfister.
I:17943;5637;"He is truly a ""villain"", in every sense of the word."
I:17943;5638;Never have I seen an actor capture the essence of a character from literature, and then expand upon it, as perfectly as Heath Ledger did with his.
I:17943;5639;All jokes aside, the performances in both movies are beyond amazing.
I:17943;5640;I don't even find it necessary to label one as better, because they are both great.
I:17943;5641;I honestly believe Heath Ledger would not have won Best Supporting Actor if he was still living due to Academy politics, but he more than deserved it, and I'm glad he won it post.
I:17943;5642;growl was fine to me.
I:17943;5643;The premise is believable, and the story draws you in without ever letting go.
I:17943;5644;As I mentioned before, the IMAX scenes are amazing.
I:17943;5645;As far as the extras go, there should have been a commentary, because this is such a landmark film.
I:17943;5646;A really fine film' with fine acting and great effects to animate and propel a fine plot that presents characters with real depth.
I:17943;5647;The Dark Knight was a brilliant movie despite being about 15.
I:17943;5648;prayers type of heroes in the Sunday papers' comic strips.
I:17943;5649;The Joker, with his scarred mouth and whacked.
I:17943;5650;Batman as the vigilante hero has created a villain who elicits as much fear as Batman does hope.
I:17943;5651;excellent Joker keeps pushing the envelope of evil deeds, the audience stays riveted to their chairs and their eyes to the screen.
I:17943;5652;the actors all do a very fine job in their roles.
I:17943;5653;Bale is an excellent Bruce Wayne, hamming it up as the millionaire playboy in order to keep is true identity a secret.
I:17943;5654;Maggie Gyllenhaal is a sexy and fiery A. d. a and love interest of both Dent and Wayne.
I:17943;5655;Aaron Eckhart, with his strong jaw and a cartoon superhero's chin, brings depth to his character's arc.
I:17943;5656;Christopher Nolan has made some very fine character movies, Memento and The Prestige, and he does great with the characters in this new Batman franchise.
I:17943;5657;and, the film is well worth the excitement.
I:17943;5658;The Dark Knight deepens the story of Gotham City.
I:17943;5659;The Joker (Heath Ledger) comes on strong and nobody really knows what he wants.
I:17943;5660;"director Christopher Nolan's second ""Batman"" is, if possible, even better than the first."
I:17943;5661;And, yes, it's well worth waiting in line for.
I:17943;5662;ray, everything arrived in top condition.
I:17943;5663;Thank you very much for this incredible product.
I:17943;5664;I enjoyed this movie a lot.
I:17943;5665;It had islands and elevated subways.
I:17943;5666;"i'll acknowledge right here and now that I'm not a huge ""comic book"" fan."
I:17943;5667;I pretty much see all the movies.
I:17943;5668;With the recent exceptions of the surprisingly entertaining IRON MAN and the fabulously inventive HELLBOY II.
I:17943;5669;"One friend said, ""I think it may be the best movie I've EVER seen!!!"
I:17943;5670;Bruce Wayne, aka Batman, has turned Gotham into a much safer city.
I:17943;5671;some quite exciting to watch.
I:17943;5672;"Those few scenes, when he's interrogated by various ""forces of good"" while clearly all the while hatching a scheme to cause even more death and destruction, are thrilling, tight and have several terrific payoffs all at once."
I:17943;5673;It is worth the entire 2.5 hours to enjoy those 20 minutes or so.
I:17943;5674;It is certainly an inventive and even compelling performance.
I:17943;5675;the performance IS very good.
I:17943;5676;He's a treat to watch, and when he dons a nurse's uniform, he truly takes this role into another level.
I:17943;5677;Michael Caine is enjoyable in a much reduced role as Arthur, Wayne's butler and moral compass.
I:17943;5678;Yet it has the great Joker sequences in the middle, incredible special effects for the character of Two.
I:17943;5679;Because once upon a time, Carbonell was featured in the live.
I:17943;5680;The circle of life, kids!
I:17943;5681;Probably my favorite movie of all time.
I:17943;5682;Love the whole Chritopher Nolan Batman trilogy.
I:17943;5683;The picture is of a blu ray package and that was what i wanted.
I:17943;5684;While The Dark Knight may not be the best comic book adaptation ever brought to screen.
I:17943;5685;that honor still goes, and will likely always go, to Akira.
I:17943;5686;it's certainly the closest I've ever seen to pushing the king off the hill.
I:17943;5687;So right off the bat you have Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Gary Oldman reprising their roles.
I:17943;5688;Put those four in a movie and I'm going to see it, no matter what it is.
I:17943;5689;deserved Oscar for Batman Begins, also returns, and this time, the Nolan Brothers wrote the screenplay themselves.
I:17943;5690;Yeah, that got an Oscar nomination, too (and was robbed.
I:17943;5691;"Well, the answer is ""yeah, he really is that good""."
I:17943;5692;As a piece of acting, it's truly a revelation, and makes it all the more depressing that his life ended so early.
I:17943;5693;Okay, fine, brood, brood, brood.
I:17943;5694;needed note of comedy into the film at times.
I:17943;5695;Pfister's cinematography is just as good as it was last time, if not better.
I:17943;5696;Nolan's direction is a bit heavy.
I:17943;5697;He's created a thoughtful, if angry, film about a guy who was never a golden boy in the first place, except maybe on television.
I:17943;5698;The Dark Knight is a phenomenal film, easily one of the best I've seen this year (including a large number of classic movies).
I:17943;5699;Is it the best movie ever, as IMDB's voters would lead us to believe?
I:17943;5700;the Joker is the most striking presence in the film.
I:17943;5701;He is, in the best comic book tradition, an abstraction.
I:17943;5702;rather he is a single human trait or inclination amplified and made animate, namely a chaotic drive towards cruelty and destruction, a trait that transcends the human and speaks of the forces of fate.
I:17943;5703;"he is forced to play one note, louder or softer, bending the tone this way and that, but still bound to the one note
I:17943;5704;his wealth, his isolation, and his omnipotence rendering him a fantasy.
I:17943;5705;powerful in his little childhood world, Bruce Wayne has a position in the alleged real world that insulates him from any interaction that could affect him.
I:17943;5706;For practical purposes, he can be a solipsist.
I:17943;5707;The visual effects are suitably spectacular.
I:17943;5708;it is a gripping ride.
I:17943;5709;watching a contest for two and a half hours can be enthralling.
I:17943;5710;The Dark Knight delivers on these terms.
I:17943;5711;"As a dark entertainment, as a magic comic book that explodes into vivid life in your hands, this film succeeds
I:17943;5712;By far this is the greatest Batman movie of all time.
I:17943;5713;It is by far the greatest movie in history.
I:17943;5714;Highly recommend this movie for all ages.
I:17943;5715;The movie was pretty good!
I:17943;5716;I am not a batman fan but this movie was Worth watching for sure.
I:17943;5717;First and foremost, PLEASE do not let this review or the rating of this product reflect on the film itself.
I:17943;5718;The Dark Knight is phenomenal and it deserves more than a five star rating.
I:17943;5719;Christopher Nolan is due a world of credit for the creative and ingenious filmmaking that goes into this movie and it goes without saying that the flawless acting, especially from the late Heath Ledger, elevates the film to a greater level.
I:17943;5720;The film is wonderful and engaging and it utilizes a perfect balance between explosive action sequences and intelligent dialogue.
I:17943;5721;ray version and I was just as impressed as I was when I first saw the film.
I:17943;5722;ray picture and sound were and the scenes filmed in IMAX were smoothly integrated throughout the film.
I:17943;5723;i was thrilled to see that the Blu.
I:17943;5724;There are also two documentaries that explore the psyche of Bruce Wayne and Batman as well as a technological look at the gadgets Batman uses.
I:17943;5725;"The ""Creation of a Scene"" which offers an inside look at the setup and preparation of some of the films major stunt sequences is interesting and I was pleasantly surprised to see how many of these segments there were."
I:17943;5726;The action, special, effects and acting turn this movie into an all time classic.
I:17943;5727;Heath Ledger's role is excellent.
I:17943;5728;I hope it is done as well as The Dark Knight!
I:17943;5729;a force for chaos, extremely clever, and realistically dangerous as he creates dilemmas for normal people to prove they are capable of evil.
I:17943;5730;As I watched it, I actually suspended my disbelief and completely enjoyed the world that the film creates.
I:17943;5731;This is very very rare for me these days, mostly I watch things for the sake of my kids.
I:17943;5732;book film transition as its best.
I:17943;5733;note: I got the blu.
I:17943;5734;ray is very nice, but I have decided with this film that I am not prepared to pay a big premium except in very rare instances.
I:17943;5735;The late Heath Ledger's performance, justly an Oscar winner, will rank among the greatest ones of all time, right up there with George C. Scott's Patton and James Dean's three roles.
I:17943;5736;far from being merely the greatest superhero movie ever, THE DARK KNIGHT is simply one of the greatest police procedurals ever committed to celluloid.
I:17943;5737;Quit while you're a head.
I:17943;5738;Stop with the remakes already and make good movies like this one.
I:17943;5739;I will say this Micheal Caine should get an Oscar for his role.
I:17943;5740;It was his best performance ever.
I:17943;5741;The other building is 300 South Riverside Plaza.
I:17943;5742;A substantial portion of this movie was filmed within a couple of blocks of where I work with the old Post Office doubling for a variety of locations, depending on the angle of the cameras.
I:17943;5743;on a less personal note, this film is notable for its absolutely astonishing action sequences and for the astonishing performance of Heath Ledger as the Joker.
I:17943;5744;nonetheless, the action sequences in this film and the special effects are so spectacular, as is Heath Ledger's final performance that most filmgoers didn't seem to notice that this wasn't an especially good film.
I:17943;5745;Still, the good definitely outweighs the bad.
I:17943;5746;still, despite its flaws, this is an extremely easy movie to enjoy and an easy one to forgive for its sins.
I:17943;5747;As a Chicagoan I especially enjoyed it.
I:17943;5748;It was a lot of fun seeing places like Lower Wacker employed in the film.
I:17943;5749;the film is renowned for Heath Ledger's final performance and even had he lived a great deal longer it would have been the performance of a lifetime.
I:17943;5750;The literary/mythic predecessor for his Joker is easy to locate, Loki of Norse mythology.
I:17943;5751;He even displays Loki's sense of mischief and humor.
I:17943;5752;It is on every level an amazing performance and it is almost impossible to imagine that Ledger will not be rewarded with a posthumous Oscar.
I:17943;5753;In fact, apart from Ledger, no one really gives an especially memorable performance.
I:17943;5754;Gary Oldman is impressive for not being anything like his typical roles.
I:17943;5755;It definitely increases my respect for him as an actor to see him playing a nonpsychopath.
I:17943;5756;all in all this is a fun film to see.
I:17943;5757;It is a superior summer blockbuster type film, depending heavily on striking special effects and startling stunts, and buoyed by an amazing supporting performance.
I:17943;5758;And ultimately that is what makes a great movie.
I:17943;5759;Review features, transfer, extras, etc.
I:17943;5760;If we want a review of the film, we'll go to the appropriate place.
I:17943;5761;in this case, THE DISC!
I:17943;5762;"OK, I admit it, I'm still a kid when it comes to ""Comic Book"" movies, I see almost all that come out."
I:17943;5763;this is a good movie made great by some of the BEST acting I've seen in many years.
I:17943;5764;as for the movie, it is a fast paced, enjoyable ride brought to life, BELIEVABLY, by great characters, superb acting and, a really good script.
I:17943;5765;ray for the action, for the acting, for the script and for the ultimate experience to be delivered from this really good movie.
I:17943;5766;Some good points were raised.
I:17943;5767;People saying that the Joker was just another phsycho Pay closer attention to the movie and understand what youre talking about before giving it a one star.
I:17943;5768;Hands down the best Batman movie out of the trilogy.
I:17943;5769;My opinion, the best Batman of all the Batman movies.
I:17943;5770;Heath Ledger, he totally steals the movie, the best Joker (apologies to Jack) ever.
I:17943;5771;The movie is well done, a little to sappy with the Gyllenhaal girl, but like I said the movie is worth everything because of Heath Ledger.
I:17943;5772;The aspect ratio changes from 2.40:1 to 1.78:1 for sequences shot in IMAX which includes the best scenes of the movie and all aerial shots.
I:17943;5773;visual masterpiece and a must have in your library.
I:17943;5774;Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale team up again in this riveting action.
I:17943;5775;batman/Bruce Wayne is most ideally suited to help track down Gotham's now.
I:17943;5776;And watching those powerful line deliveries, you can easily forget that a real and reportedly caring human being had died when Ledger's own life was accidentally self.
I:17943;5777;He definently will deserve all of the award nominations for the seat gripping performance provided throughout the screenplay!Maggie Gyllenhaal has assumed the role of Bruce's love/Assistant DA friend Rachael Dawes.
I:17943;5778;She does a generally convincing job in the part.
I:17943;5779;Gordon and Fox's moving up in their respective bureaucracies now give them the critical leverage to help conquer crime and corruption in Gotham.
I:17943;5780;And Batman himself gets some new toys to come up against his new enemies.
I:17943;5781;Like several other instances in this screenplay, the character is also a powerful illustration of the duality between good abd evil within the same person.
I:17943;5782;"Because every time Maggie/Rachel came on the screen, my eyes said, ""Ouch!"""
I:17943;5783;And I was jarred!Heath Ledger was fine, not great, in my view.
I:17943;5784;The real talent in the film is Christian Bale.
I:17943;5785;Bale, is without question, one of the world's finest.
I:17943;5786;The Dark Knight is superlative filmmaking.
I:17943;5787;masterful screenplay, directing, acting, music, production design, special effects, editing and .
I:17943;5788;Hard to imagine a better looking movie.
I:17943;5789;capturing system available and on a high.
I:17943;5790;the theme of this movie resonates deeply.
I:17943;5791;"The ideas of ""chaos for the sake of chaos"" and ""how do you fight an evil that has no rules"" is intelligently as well as viscerally exploited."
I:17943;5792;this brilliant film is packaged cleverly with an outer sleeve mockingly vandalized by the Joker.
I:17943;5793;the extras are succinctly edited and are generous.
I:17943;5794;I was especially taken by an inside look at Hans Zimmer's music as well as the blending of miniature with full size practical effects.
I:17943;5795;On Disc 2, there's a terrific examination of Batman from a psychoanalytic perspective.
I:17943;5796;This is the best movie I've seen in a LONG time.
I:17943;5797;Heath Ledger's performance is breathtaking, the cinematography beautiful.
I:17943;5798;ray format really brings the movie to life.
I:17943;5799;Heath is the best Joker ever.
I:17943;5800;What's even better, is I can relate to his role as the Joker!
I:17943;5801;this movie is simply amazing.
I:17943;5802;the script is great, the action is amazing ad the performances too(not just heath ledger's).
I:17943;5803;ray, it gets much, much better, specially the imax sequences.
I:17943;5804;This movie is amazing, I was hoping to find deleted escenes or extended ones, but is fine, the JOKER IS AMAZING
I:17943;5805;Worth the extra couple bucks for the blu.
I:17943;5806;The best blu ray movie out there right now!
I:17943;5807;Much better than the first movie.
I:17943;5808;This one of the best Batman movie ever, it never get boring and it has great acting and action
I:17943;5809;"****1/2Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" reminds us that even a product of mass."
I:17943;5810;market pop culture can, if done correctly, be a work of art.
I:17943;5811;"This thrilling, densely plotted and beautifully crafted sequel to 2005's ""Batman Begins"" is, quite possibly, the finest comic book superhero movie ever made."
I:17943;5812;In addition, it boasts, in the performance of Heath Ledger, one of the definitive screen villains of all time.
I:17943;5813;With his face painted into a ghoulish grin, Ledger's Joker strikes terror not merely into the characters in the movie but the audience as well.
I:17943;5814;It is, indeed, a tribute to Ledger's greatness as an actor that, even after all the myriad screen villains we have encountered over the years, he has the power to makes us cringe every time he appears on screen.
I:17943;5815;His delight in mind games, his devotion to torture, and his love of violence for its own sweet sake make him a figure fit to haunt one's dreams.
I:17943;5816;It's inevitable, perhaps, that Bale, as the good guy of the piece, would fall under the shadow of Ledger's towering achievement, but he provides the strength and solidity the picture needs to keep it from going out of whack.
I:17943;5817;using what would appear to be a minimum of CGI effects, Nolan has mounted his film with a fine eye for detail and a great deal of jaw.
I:17943;5818;The cityscapes alone are enough to take the audience's breath away.
I:17943;5819;stops action sequences and intense, highly intimate exchanges between characters.
I:17943;5820;still, these are minor quibbles about a movie and a performance that will go down as classics in their respective categories.
I:17943;5821;Loved all of the Christian Bale Batman movies.
I:17943;5822;Would recommend to anyone who is a fan of either Batman or Christian Bale.
I:17943;5823;He was the perfect Batman.
I:17943;5824;Great movie, Keith as the Joker made the movie.
I:17943;5825;Despite poor reviews of this movie I loved it.
I:17943;5826;Batman just keeps getting better and better.
I:17943;5827;With the new technology and the special effects that are out there now.
I:17943;5828;i rate this movie a must have for my collection and a totally must see for anyone who likes action movies, but if you dont like the comic book made movies you may not like this movie.
I:17943;5829;I recommend it for your older kids probably 5th grade on up.
I:17943;5830;When I saw it for sale I bought it promptly.
I:17943;5831;It is a great Batman movie.
I:17943;5832;It had me guessing many times during the film.
I:17943;5833;If you put aside the spectacular special effects, terrific car.
I:17943;5834;chase scenes and Heath Ledger's extraordinary performance, all you're left with is a very predictable story.
I:17943;5835;I saw more strategy displayed in a checkers game at Washington Square Park in New York than I did in this movie.
I:17943;5836;That film will give you very good insight on what grade school students are like in any country.
I:17943;5837;This is the best movie in my opionion,of the Batman movies.
I:17943;5838;Heath Ledger's role as Joker was superb.
I:17943;5839;It was a good movie, but I prefer it in Cartoon since I grew up watching batman and I like it that way.
I:17943;5840;This was Heath Ledger's last movie and he was the best thing in it.
I:17943;5841;I saw it some years ago and thought it was terrific.
I:17943;5842;This is a comic book come to life so you must suspend all logic and just sit back and enjoy the movie.
I:17943;5843;Everyone does a spectacular job except the film editors.
I:17943;5844;After seeing this movie I can easily believe that portraying this socio.
I:17943;5845;This is an excellent movie but Ledger's performance raises it to a spectacular level.
I:17943;5846;By all means see the movie if only to see Ledger's Joker.
I:17943;5847;Easily a five star film.
I:17943;5848;This is the first of many Bale will star in and we hope it will be for along time of Batman Movies.
I:17943;5849;The Dark Knight is the sequel to director Christopher Nolan's outstanding and uplifting Batman Begins.
I:17943;5850;The depiction of the story in a gritty urban millieu gives it much greater gravitas than the standard superhero film.
I:17943;5851;Ledger's performance is solid, but the other characters are ill.
I:17943;5852;fiction, but I still prefer some logical process behind the action.
I:17943;5853;And the film is indeed visually striking, with Chicago making a gleaming obsidian Gotham.
I:17943;5854;If that's your bag, this is the movie for you.
I:17943;5855;disc special edition with all its bonus features.
I:17943;5856;"now we have ""The Dark Knight"" a movie that has broken allrecords including highest opening day, highest opening weekend, and the quickest movie to reach $300 million at the domestic box office."
I:17943;5857;Batman (played by Christian Bale) has become so good at beating the bad guys that they villains turn to desperate measures.
I:17943;5858;Enter The Joker (played by Heath Ledger).
I:17943;5859;This not only includes Batman but district attorney (Harvey Dent), the girl caught in the middle of a love triangle (played by Rachel Dawes), and Police Commissioner Gordon, played by the always brilliant Gary Oldman.
I:17943;5860;The Joker even messes with Gotham Cities other criminals including mob boss in an underrated performance by Eric Roberts.
I:17943;5861;Not only does he deserve an Oscar nomination, but so do the writers.
I:17943;5862;He plays the role with great patience and concern as he worries that each time Bruce Wayne leaves may be his last.
I:17943;5863;The Dark Knight is a compelling entertainment that last two and a half hours and is not boring for a moment.
I:17943;5864;There are plenty of moments of drama and suspense in which characters have to make life altering choices.
I:17943;5865;And of course, there is plenty of action and a car chase through the middle of Gotham City in which we see get to see the Batcycle.
I:17943;5866;This seen is a hoot.
I:17943;5867;"a lot of people have compared Heath Ledger's Joker to Jack Nicholson's Joker, and a lot of critics have compared this new movie to Tim Burton's ""Batman""."
I:17943;5868;"All I will say is that ""The Dark Knight"" has rendered ""Batman"" obsolete."
I:17943;5869;He tells Harvey Dent he is no mastermind in a scene at Gotham General Hospital but we all know that he is in that great scene.
I:17943;5870;There confidence in not unwavering.
I:17943;5871;But trust me you will want more like one yearns for in lust or hunger after a great meal.
I:17943;5872;The movie was amazing and at a great price.
I:17943;5873;This was a Christmas present for my husband and it really made his day.
I:17943;5874;nOT just Batman lovers or super hero addicts!
I:17943;5875;Any person who appreciates a good movie will like this film.
I:17943;5876;but mind you, it is WELL worth it!
I:17943;5877;He manages to rig a hospital full of explosives all while locked.
I:17943;5878;The movie packs superheroes, action and constant barrage of philosophical and moral lines.
I:17943;5879;How can anyone keep track of it all?I'm usually spot.
I:17943;5880;This is a very serious treatment of a super hero, and rightly so, because Batman is arguably the most complicated comic book character, even more so on philosophical and psychological basis.
I:17943;5881;Heath Ledger's brilliant performance is utterly phenomenal but very troubling, which is even more of an indication of Nolan's commitment to regard this film as a character study, and an exploration of ethical and moral issues, and not merely a superhero movie.
I:17943;5882;He succeeds on many fronts, bringing complexities and intricacy not just to the hero and the man behind that hero, but to the villains themselves.
I:17943;5883;This is great achievement, as the film transcends comic book sensibilities and becomes something else: a film noir, a character study, a high brow and intellectual entertainment.
I:17943;5884;I really enjoyed this movie.
I:17943;5885;This is a real suspense with feeling.
I:17943;5886;The action is great, the acting is excellent, and the movie is scary, not for younger children.
I:17943;5887;i give this movie 5 stars because it is a new favorite and i can watch it over and over.
I:17943;5888;scen, and cinematography all amalgamate to provide the viewer with spectacular artistic images, excellent portrayals of characteristic ideologies, and as well as a thrilling psychological plot.
I:17943;5889;Christopher Nolan and Heath worked tremendously together capturing the essence of the half serial killer, half chaotic sociopath adding tremendous depth and complexity to the Joker not seen in the original comics.
I:17943;5890;scen of The Dark Knight refers to everything on stage (the props, sets, costumes, and acting), and was mainly the brainchild of Nolan's brilliant thinking.
I:17943;5891;Combined with the cinematography or how the movie was filmed (lighting, camera angles, camera movement, etc.) Nolan creates stunning visuals for the two and a half hour saga of good against evil.
I:17943;5892;The film itself contains many long shots and astonishing background and inversion camera clippings creating stunning visuals on the big screen.
I:17943;5893;The set seems to be jammed packed with props and intricate details that the viewer can really appreciate.
I:17943;5894;An absolute thriller from start to finish.
I:17943;5895;The best of the 3 movies.
I:17943;5896;The best movie of the Dark Knight Trilogy, and probably the best movie ever made!
I:17943;5897;the special features disc was so i overpayed big time
I:17943;5898;The movie is entertaining and mind blowing for those who would enjoy watching it.
I:17943;5899;A city who fights and tries to become as peaceful as it once was is awaiting you to go watch and enjoy it on your own.
I:17943;5900;The Dark Knight was a huge success when it was released.
I:17943;5901;It received two Academy Awards and a Best Supporting Actor for Heath Ledger's performance.
I:17943;5902;The Dark Knight is the fourth highest grossing film of all time.
I:17943;5903;everyone knows that this movie is friggin amazing in all capacities of a movie.
I:17943;5904;This is just fantastic, superb, and sensational all in one.
I:17943;5905;ray player work, and we're forced to entertain ourselves for a few hours by candlelight.
I:17943;5906;One of my personal favorite movies of the year.
I:17943;5907;Some people who enjoyed Iron Man may also enjoy this film.
I:17943;5908;This takes a more serious look at Bruce Wayne and the reality of being a superhero or not.
I:17943;5909;It is worth watching for Heath Ledger's performance.
I:17943;5910;"I think he is the best of all the previous ""Batmen""."
I:17943;5911;lots of Hollywood special effects.
I:17943;5912;This is the best batman yet guys omg so good can't wait for the next one i wish there were gonna be more
I:17943;5913;This is such a great movie and it arrived quickly, however the case was slightly damaged.
I:17943;5914;The Dark Knight is, quite simply, the greatest example of a comic.
I:17943;5915;book inspired film, and one of the finest pieces of cinema ever.
I:17943;5916;Having said that, I can safely say that the blu.
I:17943;5917;ray version best represents this movie, though the IMAX sequences are the only real selling points for the blu.
I:17943;5918;See, the letterbox sequences are good, don't get me wrong, but there's noticeable grain all over the place.
I:17943;5919;You'll also be getting some special features, such as the Focus Points on the main disc.
I:17943;5920;The Focus Points are actually very interesting, and thoroughly explain how several scenes were created.
I:17943;5921;The second disc has some interesting documentaries, in 16:9 high.
I:17943;5922;Batman and Gordon's last speech in the movie is a Great example of self sacrifice by Batman.
I:17943;5923;If you love Batman this is a Must Own.
I:17943;5924;The Theory of Chaos represented by The Joker made this movie a perfect movie.You must have it even if you don't like comics.
I:17943;5925;I got it for a deal whih made it even better
I:17943;5926;Heath Ledger's role as the Joker is memorable for sure and if you like action and good vs. evil type movies then this is the movie for you.
I:17943;5927;ray, just makes it that much more of an enjoyable, edge of your seat movie watching.
I:17943;5928;I ordered this movie to add to my library of great movies.
I:17943;5929;THIS series of Batman movies is the better of all of those produced.
I:17943;5930;This was an enjoyable family movie and my son wants to watch it all the time now.
I:17943;5931;yeah, it's the movie and he loves that movie.
I:17943;5932;But save the receipt until you're sure it works, and keep track of that digital copy code because the disk production is funky.
I:17943;5933;In modern world Bat Man and Joker would have had arm around each other and lived happy ever after.
I:17943;5934;Hi,This is one of the best steelbooks around.
I:17943;5935;I am happy to receive this item.
I:17943;5936;This was delivered by the seller in perfect condition and with very fast shipment.
I:17943;5937;priced cinema was to admire the gorgeous, chiseled facial features and toned chest muscles of the lead actor, Christian Bale.
I:17943;5938;That admiration aside, what a tour de force!
I:17943;5939;this movie is a wonderful second installment of the new Batman movies.
I:17943;5940;The ensemble cast was top.
I:17943;5941;notch, and the untimely death of Heath Ledger makes his rendition of the Joker especially memorable.
I:17943;5942;Though Bruce believes in Harvey Dent's integrity, the two vie for the love of Rachel.
I:17943;5943;"Rachel's condition for a relationship becomes a huge motivation for Bruce to appoint a new ""knight"" to carry the torch of Batman."
I:17943;5944;For a man who boasts that he doesn't make plans, the Joker seems to have his chaos agenda well in hand, being at the right place at the right time to bring about the greatest amount of destruction.
I:17943;5945;The Joker gloats to Batman that even the best of men can be brought down under the right circumstances.
I:17943;5946;"James Gordon knows the truth about the killing spree, and this ""good cop"" doesn't think that those deaths can be covered up."
I:17943;5947;Furthermore, Batman was the larger.
I:17943;5948;life protector of Gotham, a fusion of technology and the supernatural.
I:17943;5949;that would really shake up their confidence in the good in man and lend credence to the Joker's cynicism.
I:17943;5950;"They love this ethical ""outlawer"" more than the district attorney."
I:17943;5951;But I did appreciate the intelligence, Oscar.
I:17943;5952;caliber acting, and action of this blockbuster.
I:17943;5953;"And of course, the physique of Bruce Wayne (my friend and I said in almost perfect synchronicity, ""Oh my God"" the first time Bale took off his shirt!)"
I:17943;5954;The Joker's character is complex and almost persuading.
I:17943;5955;Christian Bale is always a eye candy!
I:17943;5956;Great for a gift for that person who collects movies.
I:17943;5957;The music is good, but the movie is a bit heavy for kids.
I:17943;5958;that goes for a lot of the stuff in the film .
I:17943;5959;But he played a psycho in some other movie and this director is making some new horror flick so that explains something to me .
I:17943;5960;Always injured and almost got killed .
I:17943;5961;The film is beautifully shot and it just shows the progression of what batman will become.
I:17943;5962;*In Batman Begins, Bruce said that he traveled the world to understand the criminal mind.
I:17943;5963;* Batman has been on the job at most a year, yet he is able to order the Gotham City Police Department to do his bidding.
I:17943;5964;Batman is a vigilante who helps to apprehend criminals.
I:17943;5965;sacrificing and nice as Nolan wants to suggest in that scene.
I:17943;5966;He always had the perfect set.
I:17943;5967;He was surrounded by greatness.
I:17943;5968;One of the most important componants of ANY BAtman story is the psychology of Bruce Wayne and how it affects Batman's decisions and actions and hence, his environment and supporting cast.
I:17943;5969;Bruce Wayne was as important to the plot as one of the common thugs.
I:17943;5970;what is up with Batman's voice.
I:17943;5971;Christian Bale was James Bond and Morgan Freeman was basically Q. Combine that with the schene in Hong Kong so as to add international intrigue and suspense, and it is a 007 flick.
I:17943;5972;there are a few good points however.
I:17943;5973;Although not his best role ever, I still think that Gary Oldman is the greatest and most talented actor in the world today.
I:17943;5974;Also, in line with what everyone has ever said, Heath Leger's performance was probably the greatest acting performance I have EVER seen in my life.
I:17943;5975;he deserves the Oscar (and not just because of his tragedy.)
I:17943;5976;Watch it if you want to see an incredible portrayal of the Joker.
I:17943;5977;star movie, or that it is the best comic book movie ever, because you would be way way way way off.
I:17943;5978;Thank you for your time.
I:17943;5979;ray is just amazing, but you may want to pass up this limited edition set.
I:17943;5980;I actually keep the mask case inside the box it came in because the actual case is just so unorthodox.
I:17943;5981;I depart from the world in my feeling that while Heath Ledger does a great job, there are any number of good actors who could pull this role off.
I:17943;5982;The one thought that went through my head is how much fun it would be to play the Joker.
I:17943;5983;not as witty as Batman Begins, the film is crammed full of excitement.
I:17943;5984;hope you enjoyed it as much as I did.
I:17943;5985;"He corrected one of the key mistakes he made in ""Batman Begins""."
I:17943;5986;and have made not just a superhero movie, but a masterful character study of Christian Bale's Bruce Wayne.
I:17943;5987;the basis of the Batman/Joker dynamic is, and always has been, that Batman never gets a pure victory over the Joker, that somehow the Joker always.
I:17943;5988;voiced vigilante we all know and love, and the Bruce who controls the two.
I:17943;5989;this is what makes this movie fascinating to watch from a psychological standpoint.
I:17943;5990;"Michael Caine's Alfred is a far more active and thoughtful character than Micheal Gough's Alfred in the Burton/Schumacher series
I:17943;5991;weary, knowing, and understanding his working relationship with the Bat.
I:17943;5992;Morgan Freeman's Lucius Fox is fun.
I:17943;5993;that he knows and openly works with Bruce on tech for Batman's usage (Something not acknowledged for years in the print lineage) is a hoot.
I:17943;5994;part story), this is the part that allows us to see that for all of his will, fighting skills, abilities of deduction.
I:17943;5995;that Bruce Wayne is human, and all humans can fail.
I:17943;5996;Batman may capture the Joker, but the costs to himself and the city are catastrophic.
I:17943;5997;one of the best batman movies of all time.
I:17943;5998;Without a doubt, this is the best action.
I:17943;5999;theater scene, and don't have to worry about waking the kiddies, life is good.
I:17943;6000;If you turn it up so you can hear the dialogue, when the action scenes come on, it shakes the walls.
I:17943;6001;It's hard to enjoy the movie when you have the volume set so the gun.
I:17943;6002;"The Joker has been hammed up for decades in the ""Batman"" TV series, comics, and movies, but Ledger turns the character into something completely sinister and original . . . we've seen this character a thousand times, but we've never seen this before."
I:17943;6003;And if he gives up the mask, he can marry sweetheart Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal, a welcome replacement for Katie Holmes).
I:17943;6004;while Wayne's affairs of the heart are playing out, the Joker is consolidating his power on Gotham's crime scene.
I:17943;6005;this excellent plot gives plenty of opportunities for Nolan to set up fantastic action scenes in the streets of Gotham (actually Chicago, a nice replacement for New York).
I:17943;6006;Nolan also gives plenty of opportunities for the stellar cast .
I:17943;6007;"the superhero movie is definitely in a Golden Age, and ""The Dark Knight"" belongs on the list of Great Comic Book Movies ever."
I:17943;6008;I mean they were enjoyable.
I:17943;6009;It feels like our real world.
I:17943;6010;Batman Begins is the best of the bunch.
I:17943;6011;Director Christopher Nolan wipes the slate clean in regard to comic.
I:17943;6012;"One of this decade's essential films, ""The Dark Knight"" expands upon the Batman mythology by emerging as a character."
I:17943;6013;The late Heath Ledger delivers an astonishingly detailed performance as the Joker (his talents will be sadly missed), yet the entire cast is excellent.
I:17943;6014;The Dark Knight surpasses all expectations with its seamless fusion of visual bravura and incisive storytelling.
I:17943;6015;I am not a huge fan of comic book movies, but I thought this one was absolutely fantastic.
I:17943;6016;In my opinion, it is better than its predecessor and is probably the best comic book movie I have ever seen.
I:17943;6017;christopher Nolan borrows heavily from other directors here, but synthesis is often as rewarding as creativity.
I:17943;6018;Granted, The Joker is the best part of the movie.
I:17943;6019;This is a great example of a movie people like because mass media told them to like it.
I:17943;6020;The first Batman is far superior.
I:17943;6021;Heath Ledger's best role ever.
I:17943;6022;Christian Bale plays a great Batman.
I:17943;6023;I loved the movie .
I:17943;6024;Take a lesson from Disney you momney.
I:17943;6025;The most popular piece of technology in years and it's not compatible???
I:17943;6026;Great movie, son was pleased with Batpod for his collection, he is 24 and a movie buff.
I:17943;6027;This is one of the best movies of the year.
I:17943;6028;and obviously the highest grossing movie of 2008.
I:17943;6029;The acting was great, with the Joker role being the highlight.
I:17943;6030;"The added IMAX scenes was a nice touch, but I didn't notice much of a difference from the standard
I:17943;6031;regardless of the argument about special features on disc 2, I would highly recommend The Dark Knight and watch it every time with anyone who hasn't seen it.
I:17943;6032;Ledger's performance is chilling and inspiring and unforgettable.
I:17943;6033;Any time a legend like Jack Nicholson plays a character, it's tough to follow in those footsteps, to match the performance of a master and legend.
I:17943;6034;top amazing that it made me forget that Nicholson ever played the part.
I:17943;6035;, it is worth watching simply for scenes in which The Joker holds court.
I:17943;6036;And he pretty much drives and dominates every scene he's in.
I:17943;6037;he made a good movie into a great, classic one.
I:17943;6038;Best superhero movie ever, hands.
I:17943;6039;"In 2005, Christopher Nolan relaunched Warner Brothers' dormant Batman franchise with ""Batman Begins"", an exceptionally well."
I:17943;6040;made film that took a realistic, detailed approach to the origins of DC's biggest hero (arguably the most popular hero in the world).
I:17943;6041;Now, three years later, Nolan and his star Christian Bale return to the property, and they deliver what is perhaps the greatest superhero film ever made (and a great film, besides), on ethat will become the model all others will look up to.
I:17943;6042;"the first movie ended on an optimistic note: Batman had saved the city, and had ""really started something"", in Gordon's words: however, one tease at the end (the Joker's playing card) hinted at the violent chaos to come in the next movie."
I:17943;6043;Gordon closed the last film with a prediction that Batman's presence would lead to escalation in the criminal community.
I:17943;6044;Dent, as well, is romancing Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal, a superior replacement for Katie Holmes).
I:17943;6045;Eckhart is very compelling as this version, which also sports some effectively grisly makeup/effects.
I:17943;6046;Caine, Freeman, Oldman, and Gyllenhaal are all effective supporting cast.
I:17943;6047;"one of the most notable things about this film is its ability to make the audience doubt the outcome, bringing the storytelling styles that have flourished in the comics industry for at least twenty years to the big screen at last
I:17943;6048;a bravura effort from all involved.
I:17943;6049;when I knew the nemesis of Batman, I have a huge expectations and The Joker exceed all .
I:17943;6050;this movie is powerful and change the ways to make madness on Gotham City.
I:17943;6051;One of the best movies i have ever seen just outstanding.
I:17943;6052;Christian Bale and Heath Ledger were amazing.
I:17943;6053;This movie promotes the wrong response and leaves us vulnerable to allowing monsters to take power.
I:17943;6054;If the makers of this movie wanted to deal with dark and morally negative stories they do not need to degrade and destroy well known and well loved children's heroes to do so.
I:17943;6055;Really good movie though, sorry
I:17943;6056;This is the Batman movie I like the most.
I:17943;6057;No matter what, this movie is both philosophical and entertaining.
I:17943;6058;Other wise it's about a 3.5.
I:17943;6059;so, and the special effects are about as good as you'd see in any new action film.
I:17943;6060;There are much better movie critics out there that have already given his performance praise so all I can say is that I agree with them and he totally deserved the Academy Award that he got for it.
I:17943;6061;It arrived on time and in great condition.
I:17943;6062;There's nothing more to say, I received excellent service.
I:17943;6063;Let me state catagorically, this is a great movie!!
I:17943;6064;Though it clocks in at two and half hours, it never lags, the pacing is perfect.
I:17943;6065;, but he really infuses the character a sinister darkness.
I:17943;6066;The one on ones between the Joker and Bale's pent up Batman, really made the movie for me, the way the Joker taunts him and makes him look at his own demons is just great acting on Ledgers part.
I:17943;6067;Maggie Gyllenhaul is a real upgrade from the limited Holmes and Aaron Ekhart is perfect as Harvey Dent, with his chisled features and Redford hair, he cuts the perfect white knight image, though I was surprised at his look as he becomes Two.
I:17943;6068;Overall, great movie, the best Batman movie by far.
I:17943;6069;and Batman Begin was very good so that's saying a lot.
I:17943;6070;The best movie of 2008.
I:17943;6071;He was just insane,truly twisted,incredibly smart lunatic.
I:17943;6072;It was just a powerful,intense rollercoaster of a movie.
I:17943;6073;Now The Dark Knight Rises makes so much more sense!
I:17943;6074;Love this new franchise .
I:17943;6075;"I always ask that of all my prey
I:17943;6076;it keeps you interested all the way to the end.
I:17943;6077;i always liked the spiderman movies, but this is my new favorite.
I:17943;6078;One of the best superhero movies of all time.
I:17943;6079;2nd film in Christopher Nolan's Batman Trilogy.
I:17943;6080;Got the movie in new condition in a timely manner.
I:17943;6081;I Loved each and every character in this movie!
I:17943;6082;It's for sure in my top 10!
I:17943;6083;I love this movie, saw it a couple times in theaters!
I:17943;6084;Exciting all the way through.
I:17943;6085;Great movie, excellent price from Lightening Deals .
I:17943;6086;My daughter really liked this Batman movie and wanted it for Christmas.
I:17943;6087;I'm glad that I'm able to put it under the tree for her.
I:17943;6088;He loves the movie and so does everyone else in the family.
I:17943;6089;It arrived in plenty of time and in perfect condition.
I:17943;6090;I got this video for my 18 year grandson and he was very thrilled.
I:17943;6091;He said it was the perfect gift and he has been enjoying watching it.
I:17943;6092;One of the best things I have seen in my life.
I:17943;6093;Sad he has to go.
I:17943;6094;This action packed film is amazing to watch in Blu.
I:17943;6095;If you are a Batman fan then this is the film to watch.
I:17943;6096;It displays great performances by each actor and is filled with tons action which will keep you entertained throughout the entire film.
I:17943;6097;There was no interruption in the streaming and the pixel is great!
I:17943;6098;Moneyball was way more engaging, thoughtful and entertaining than this one.
I:17943;6099;climatic plot and script was really the best.
I:17943;6100;for Heath Ledger: Rest in peace, you gave us a great great gift with your performance, beyond cool, just beyond.
I:17943;6101;"this ""special edition"" really blows!"
I:17943;6102;but the movie itself is really good.
I:17943;6103;ledger as The Joker is a great performance.
I:17943;6104;christian Bale once again does a great job playing Bruce Wayne/Batman.
I:17943;6105;but I thought he did a great job with it.
I:17943;6106;this is a really good film,and I am very much looking forward to the sequel,The Dark Knight Rises,with Tom Hardy as Bane and Anne Hathaway as Selena Kyle/Catwoman.
I:17943;6107;Now for the review, this steelbook comes with 2 discs the feature, the bonus features (some of the best ever), and NOT a digital copy disc, BUT a slip of paper with an activation code.
I:17943;6108;Of the three Nolan Batman movies, this is my sentimental favorite.
I:17943;6109;I consider The Dark Knight to be one of the best movies ever.
I:17943;6110;Everything from the action sequences, to the love triangle, to the great performances given by the cast pushes The Dark Knight to the top.
I:17943;6111;Without giving anything away about the actual movie, in my opinion, this installment of this franchise is absolutely the best and enters into an entirely new dimension all its own.
I:17943;6112;It certainly brought back fond memories of wanting to be Batman as a kid and now as an adult, and based on this character's portrayal I felt very much like all of it could be possible.
I:17943;6113;It was all very natural and captivating.
I:17943;6114;The technology is still something that I believe can be improved upon, as with everything, but I felt it was tasteful and not distractive at all.
I:17943;6115;If you liked the movie, you will enjoy this Blu.
I:17943;6116;The focus points are probably the best of the extras, but the other clips (like the Gotham Tonight episodes) also add to the enjoyment of the movie experience.
I:17943;6117;live features that Warner Bros. have created for their first effort bodes well for future Blu.
I:17943;6118;ray releases from the studio.
I:17943;6119;live capability is a must.
I:17943;6120;it's too over the top and makes Bale's performance the least enjoyable of the big 3 in this film.
I:17943;6121;i was absolutely rivoted the entire time, and it's not a short movie!I sat on the edge of my seat without blinking or looking away from the screen for two and a half hours, unable to look away.
I:17943;6122;And the special features about how they made it without CGI are almost as captivating as the movie itself.
I:17943;6123;Batman Beginswas a delightful breath of fresh air filling the sails of what one could have only hoped would be the beginning of a new era of Batman movies.
I:17943;6124;Tim Burton's two films Batman and Batman Returns were very entertaining.
I:17943;6125;Joel Schumacher's Batman Forever was fair at best, and Schumacher's Batman and Robin was absolutely atrocious (think the TV series).
I:17943;6126;The Dark Knight even outdoes Batman Begins, and that's saying a lot!Just as the title of Batman Begins was the best description of that movie, so is the title The Dark Knight for this one.
I:17943;6127;And not because he died and to honor him.
I:17943;6128;He'll get awards because every aspect of the role was delivered perfectly.
I:17943;6129;both Christian Bale and Heath Ledger make you believe that Batman and The Joker are real.
I:17943;6130;The rest of the cast is perfect too.
I:17943;6131;and I meant that as kind of a back.
I:17943;6132;the special effects, cool devices and toys are back too.
I:17943;6133;the Dark Knight is suspenseful, scary at times, very emotional at times and most importantly well.
I:17943;6134;The entire cast took their roles very serious and it made the movie that much more believable, real and.
I:17943;6135;This movie is a classic and I will watch it again and again on Blu Ray.
I:17943;6136;Arrived in perfect condition and fast shipment.
I:17943;6137;First of all, this is a GREAT film, not just a great Batman film.
I:17943;6138;Let me simply say that everything about this movie, from the script to the casting to the CGI to the acting and ultimately the directing is superb.
I:17943;6139;message of The Dark Knight is a meditation on the nature of good and evil, the veneer of civilization, the virtues of principle and the necessity and the danger of bending principle in emergencies, the differences between evil for gain or power and evil for mere destruction and chaos, and the tension between public duty and private loyalty.
I:17943;6140;Police Lieutenant James Gordon represents incorruptible good.
I:17943;6141;This gives evil a huge temporary advantage.Yet sometimes the good must bend and even break the rules.
I:17943;6142;harvey Dent is extremely complex.
I:17943;6143;Gordon answers by claiming that sometimes those who know corruption can be the most effective in fighting it.
I:17943;6144;"Dent is identified as the ""White Knight"" whose public persona will rally the public against evil."
I:17943;6145;"He has physically transformed from a White Knight into his derisive nickname, ""Two Face."""
I:17943;6146;the death of Rachel has destroyed Dent's belief in good and has dissolved his commitment to the public's welfare.
I:17943;6147;The lucky coin with two heads has been transformed.
I:17943;6148;furious at Gordon for the actions of the corrupt police officers in Gordon's unit who betrayed Rachel, Dent finds Gordon's wife and children.
I:17943;6149;Batman survives and tells Gordon that the myth of Dent's goodness must become the rallying point for the city.
I:17943;6150;Dent remains the White Knight, while Batman allows himself to become The Dark Knight, spurned by the public, identified wrongly but necessarily as the source of evil, who can then secretly work for the good.
I:17943;6151;The Joker has destroyed Rachel, transformed Dent, and caused everlasting turmoil and doubt within Batman.
I:17943;6152;There is a small pantheon of presentations of psychiatrically deranged individuals in film.
I:17943;6153;This touch, which I believe was meticulously and masterfully added to the portrayal by Ledger, makes The Joker both more convincing and more dangerous.
I:17943;6154;Batman says Rachel's but I believe he is aware of The Joker's double crosses and switches, and knowingly goes to Dent's location.
I:17943;6155;Bruce Wayne would have rescued Rachel but Batman, a true hero, puts his public duty above his private preferences.
I:17943;6156;Full Screen option presents video in full life on my screen.
I:17943;6157;Mr. Heath Ledger made a great movie, and this will go down in history as his finest hour.
I:17943;6158;NO one has ever played the Joker quite like he does.
I:17943;6159;He has it down to making you think he might be a villian in real life.
I:17943;6160;But he scored 5 stars from my whole family.
I:17943;6161;This is the best Batman because of Heath Ledger and Christian Bale.
I:17943;6162;What an epic Batman movie this was.
I:17943;6163;all the cast deliver the goods.
I:17943;6164;I was laughing out loud at all his wild stuff.
I:17943;6165;He walks right out the pages Batman: Year One.
I:17943;6166;kudos to the Cast and Crew for a job well done.
I:17943;6167;Good refresher for the final in the trilogy and probably the best antagonist since Arnold Schwartznegger and the Terminator !
I:17943;6168;When I was 9 back in 1989, I was introduced to a new world of film.
I:17943;6169;Up to that point I'd been subjected to Disney films, and the odd musical (born to two ministers).
I:17943;6170;"It was with this film based on a comic that
I:17943;6171;it was with this film that I began to collect comics.
I:17943;6172;I loved Batman Returns, had fun with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and even grooved on Dolph Lundgren's Punisher.
I:17943;6173;I followed many others with the very occasional jem.
I:17943;6174;Batman Begins delivered what I wanted, a flesh and blood retelling of Batman.
I:17943;6175;Soon, i was blessed with the opportunity to see The Dark Knight.
I:17943;6176;And finally I had that PERFECT Batman film I'd so longed for.
I:17943;6177;From the choice of actors, to the deep and dark storyline, Chris Nolan made a perfect film.
I:17943;6178;Aaron Eckhart, gives a suave, stubborn and sweet performance as D. a Harvey Dent, and does just as well showing the despair and mania that is Two.
I:17943;6179;"He is
I:17943;6180;other cast did wonderful as well.
I:17943;6181;He did a marvelous job showing Gordons guts in his job, his intelligence and his fear for the people of Gotham's safety.
I:17943;6182;He made him scary, manical, intelligent and worty of being Batman's Clown Prince of Crime.
I:17943;6183;Heath deserves an Oscar nod, if not the award itself.
I:17943;6184;(let the comments begin)The films action sequences were also very impressive, from the opening bank heist to the freeway chase, to the ever impressive big rig flip and bat.
I:17943;6185;It's also a close look at the essence of good and evil and how evil can twist one's good intent.
I:17943;6186;"so, in short, after many years of waiting
I:17943;6187;What it means to keep fighting even if you don't know why, and a film that properly shows what the fight would be like in the real world.
I:17943;6188;This is the Batman for the ages.
I:17943;6189;Great movie at a great price.
I:17943;6190;Heath Ledger does a decent job with what script he had to work with, but to be honest this is closer to an episode of NYPD blue than a grand good vs. evil superhero adventure.
I:17943;6191;She attempts a 'sexy' delivery for a few lines, and it doesn't work.
I:17943;6192;I enjoyed The Dark Knight movie.
I:17943;6193;I want to go on record right now as saying, Heath Ledger will win an Oscar for his work in The Dark Knight.
I:17943;6194;I enjoyed the second installment of the second new Batman series of films.
I:17943;6195;Enjoyed seeing many of the secondary characters come into their own.
I:17943;6196;The beginning of a sequel with more action to come!
I:17943;6197;Great movie probably one of the best of the batman series I have seen.
I:17943;6198;Good movie I really enjoyed the action and suspense of the movie not to mention ledger's great preformance during the movie
I:17943;6199;I was expecting to be incredibly impressed going into this movie, and all I can say is that it completely exceeded my all expectations.
I:17943;6200;I staggered out of the theater, completely blown away by this intelligent, exciting, technically impressive, well.
I:17943;6201;acted, emotional, psychologically gripping piece of cinema.
I:17943;6202;"The Dark Knight transcends the ""superhero movie"" genre and breaks through to a higher plane."
I:17943;6203;This film is simply superb.
I:17943;6204;The fact that Heath Ledger is as good as everyone says (and more) is simply the icing on the cake.
I:17943;6205;i was worried that everyone was only saying how good Ledger was due to his untimely death, but he really is excellent in this film and you will never see a bad guy played with such style, menace, humour and twisted charm.
I:17943;6206;He is spellbinding every time he is screen.
I:17943;6207;He may be able to carry off the kicks and punches, but he is hilarious as an action hero.
I:17943;6208;Caine is great as Alfred and Gary Oldman and Maggie Gyllenhaal round out the impressive cast very well indeed.
I:17943;6209;this film has thrills and spills and kept me highly entertained for the duration and it is a film I could easily watch again for Ledgers performance alone.
I:17943;6210;Well writen, directed and acted.
I:17943;6211;The digital copy is a great extra bonus.
I:17943;6212;The former film went on to be labeled one of the best comic book movies ever made.
I:17943;6213;Much like Batman Begins, The Dark Knight is helped out by having a stellar cast, with new cast members being even more memorable than many of the returning ones.
I:17943;6214;But it's also the perfect introduction to someone who is quite possibly the most terrifying villain I've ever seen in a movie.
I:17943;6215;At first it seems like the Joker has a simple goal.
I:17943;6216;on the other end of the spectrum however, a new hero is rising in Gotham.
I:17943;6217;If Batman is the Dark Knight, Harvey Dent is the White Knight.
I:17943;6218;This catches the attention of the Joker.
I:17943;6219;With one plot twist after another and a plot that keeps you guessing until the very end, The Dark Knight not only manages to thrill you and keep you on the edge of your seat, but you barely notice that you've actually spent 152 minutes in a theater being glued to the screen.
I:17943;6220;The Dark Knight focuses very heavily on its characters, and it's a good thing they're all played by fine actors.
I:17943;6221;Equally impressive is Aaron Eckhart who plays Harvey Dent.
I:17943;6222;He's got the charisma for the role and the delivery.
I:17943;6223;Heath Ledger and Aaron Eckhart do such a great job in their roles that they out perform and the likes of Christian Bale, Michael Caine, and Maggie Gyllenhaal.
I:17943;6224;there are also several impressive visual effects though out the film and some of the most intense action sequences I've ever seen.
I:17943;6225;Throughout the entire movie I was on the edge of my seat, even wondering at times how Batman was going to get out of certain situations.
I:17943;6226;Despite being over two and half hours long, the movie moves along at an excellent pace and keeps your eyes glued to the screen.
I:17943;6227;The movies overall dark mood is perfect as well and is played throughout.
I:17943;6228;There's some humor thrown in there, but much of it is fairly dark, fairly ironic humor.
I:17943;6229;It easily outdoes Batman Begins and is easily one of the best films of 2008.
I:17943;6230;I believe the Dark Knight trilogy will become the classics of Batman movies.
I:17943;6231;It's one of those movies that we will watch over and over.
I:17943;6232;It's nice to know that a film with such high expectations has finally met them.
I:17943;6233;large tub of popcorn because it's worth the experience.
I:17943;6234;The Dark Knight has set a new precedent for comic book movies and fan boys everywhere will be gushing praise for Christopher Nolan's artsy and dignified portrayal of one of the oldest and most classic hero.
I:17943;6235;the movie kicks off with, appropriately enough, a bank heist, Nolan gearing his audience up for the ride of their lives.
I:17943;6236;In his fight to stop him, Batman will come face to face with good and evil and in the end has to choose between maintaining the delicate equilibrium of Gotham or romancing the unattainable.
I:17943;6237;An original score by James Newton Howard (The Sixth Sense) and Hans Zimmer (Gladiator) breathes even more life into the enthralling action, and with Wally Pfister's superb cinematography and effective editing from Lee Smith, Nolan and crew have created a perfectly.
I:17943;6238;christian Bale is the best of the caped crusaders yet, his personification of Bruce Wayne the enigmatic and somber soul that has always been portrayed within the pages of DC Comics.
I:17943;6239;Where Burton never dared to venture, Nolan has Bruce Wayne savoring his elite businessman lifestyle by cavorting around with beautiful women (at one point, Wayne is aboard a yacht with the entire female entourage of the Russian ballet).
I:17943;6240;Despite it all, he gives Batman/Bruce Wayne grace and dignity, along with an emotional wound that serves to once again spur his waning battle against terror.
I:17943;6241;"maggie Gyllenhaal, as said by many critics, is an improvement over the bland Katie Holmes (though I'm sure some would've loved to see Holmes sitting in the proverbial ""hot seat"" near the end of the film)
I:17943;6242;"Caine is dignified and sentimental as Alfred (the best Alfred yet) and Morgan Freeman gives another stately performance as Lucius Fox, Batman's highly skilled supplier of all his ""wonderful toys""."
I:17943;6243;Credit must also be given for a superb and subtle Gary Oldman as Jim Gordon, the man who would be Gotham's future Commissioner.
I:17943;6244;though Jack Nicholson was a real hoot as the Joker in Tim Burton's 1989 adaptation, 28.
I:17943;6245;heather Ledger is, quite simply, marvelous.
I:17943;6246;Though you be an action fan, a comic book nerd, a movie.
I:17943;6247;Overall, the product's handling is definitely sketchy, but what matters is perfect!
I:17943;6248;This is the best Batman movie EVER.
I:17943;6249;Christian Bale plays an awesome Batman and Heath Ledger is simply breathtaking.
I:17943;6250;He leaves you wanting to see more of the Joker.
I:17943;6251;This Batman movie was a hit.
I:17943;6252;Heath Ledger was absolutely amazing.
I:17943;6253;I saw it first in theaters when it first came out but after seeing it again and having more time to reflect on this story I believe it is the best batman movie ever made.
I:17943;6254;It shows what I believe is the true raw essence of batman is.
I:17943;6255;He is on the fine line of what is right and wrong and is almost willing to cross over to see justice prevail.
I:17943;6256;Even after the love of his life dies he hold to the true values of a hero and does what he believes is the right thing to do.
I:17943;6257;This movies' epic proportion and outstanding cast of actors with first rate acting show this is what it takes to make a superb action superhero film based on one of the oldest and beloved heroes ever to grace a comic book.
I:17943;6258;Very similar to all the other Batman movies, but I love most of them as well.
I:17943;6259;Wonderful effects, well done, very entertaining.
I:17943;6260;i have to agree that Heath Ledger did an excellent job.
I:17943;6261;which is a good thing, because by the time the ending wrapped up I got that incredibly overwhelmed sensation of tingling run down my spine like a chill realizing that I .
I:17943;6262;This was actual real, flesh and bones story.
I:17943;6263;telling of some of the best caliber.
I:17943;6264;christopher Nolan goes against the grain by offering up something as grand as this in a serialized, comic.
I:17943;6265;book action movie and making something vastly superior to a lot of other `dramatic' films in the market.
I:17943;6266;I firmly believe `The Prestige' is a modern day masterpiece much in the same line as Blade Runner, and we were left dangling without a commentary on that, I didn't expect to see one here, but I guess a lot of other people did.
I:17943;6267;ray version of this movie is everything that modern technology have it hyped up to be.
I:17943;6268;The image is superior and superb.
I:17943;6269;The sound is magnificent, devilish and crisp.
I:17943;6270;It's the pinnacle of viewing at this point.
I:17943;6271;My son is 8 and a huge Batman fan in every way.
I:17943;6272;He loves the movies, the Lego's, the toys.you name it, he's all about the Batman.
I:17943;6273;There was so much hype about this movie that I expected a really exciting ride.
I:17943;6274;If that appeals to you, then this is for you.
I:17943;6275;the character development, personal relationships and the inner conflict of Bruce Wayne that have made the prior batman movies so interesting took a back seat to the psychotic mind of the joker.
I:17943;6276;i've enjoyed many of Heath Ledger's films, and I agree that he did a wonderful job.
I:17943;6277;This is absolutely not for kids.
I:17943;6278;Ironman wins hands down on so many levels.
I:17943;6279;in conclusion, this is my least favorite Batman movie and would not really recommend it.
I:17943;6280;"The Dark Knight carries on this tradition, picking up about a year after ""Batman Begins"" with the Bat's war on crime in full swing and Carmine Falcone's once all."
I:17943;6281;Joker's tactics wind up pushing Batman, Dent, and the GCPD closer to the edge.
I:17943;6282;the three key figures in the battle to bring the city back from the brink it's been on for years .
I:17943;6283;The Dark Knight features an outstanding ensemble cast, with Christian Bale making a great Batman, and Gary Oldman (Jim Gordon), Morgan Freeman (Lucius Fox), Michael Caine (Alfred Pennyworth), Maggie Gyllenhaal (replacing Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes) and Eckhart (Dent) all bringing their characters to life.
I:17943;6284;This movie gives all the so. called 'supporting' characters, as well as the overall situation in Gotham, and the role of the city itself, important parts in building up the whole.
I:17943;6285;visually, the film is incredible, and captures the comics's look incredibly .
I:17943;6286;The action is fantastic and tense.
I:17943;6287;The look of the city, the design of the Batmobile, everything on this level has been expertly crafted.
I:17943;6288;conscience enemy Batman's ever faced, and this comes across on screen.
I:17943;6289;The way Batman's handled is also excellent, and he's certainly built up more convincingly than in most of the pre.2005 movies, although I did find one glitch .
I:17943;6290;I'm a collector, and this is a fun and rare thing to have.
I:17943;6291;Great package for an excellent movie!
I:17943;6292;the movie is great and beyond any Batman movie, to date, but if you're into special features and behind.
I:17943;6293;norm, then this edition comes highly recommended.
I:17943;6294;I was surprised to see it came from Argentina
I:17943;6295;My BF just loves Heath Ledger's work and he thinks that Dark Knight was his best work ever!
I:17943;6296;He keeps watching this movie over and over again.
I:17943;6297;Chris Nolan has come a long way since his first film and has consistently delivered complex plots narrated in a very easy and simplistic way.
I:17943;6298;The Dark Knight series is just a shining example of his brilliance as a filmmaker.
I:17943;6299;I would argue that this film is his masterpiece, his best piece of work yet.
I:17943;6300;The final episode in the series was more on a grand scale, but this film is all about characters.
I:17943;6301;Hats off to the late Heath Ledger for delivering one of the finest performances in Hollywood.
I:17943;6302;there are two discs, the first with the feature film has several extra features showing how many scenes were created, details behind the suit and pod designs and the planning of the film.
I:17943;6303;The 2nd disc carries on with a very good psychological examination of the mythology and analysis of Batman as a human being displaying his commonalities with all of us.
I:17943;6304;The extras were really quite interesting and will take a special sitting just to watch them all.
I:17943;6305;This set also came with an Ultra Violet download you can assess via your computer.
I:17943;6306;This lasted but a couple of seconds and is really nit picking on my part and barely worth mentioning.
I:17943;6307;In my opinion, this film's transfer to Blu Ray is most DEMO worthy.
I:17943;6308;The audio is great in all areas using both the front and rear sound stages for panning and quite a bit of discreet channeling and directionality for all 5 channels.
I:17943;6309;If your sub is set up correctly and is not set too high so that you hear it as a separate speaker, you will be immersed in some powerful bottom end.
I:17943;6310;The audio for this film is totally demo worthy.
I:17943;6311;Those movies, like this one, were huge rushes of emotions and action and swept you up in their intensity.
I:17943;6312;Watching it at home was fun but it certainly wasn't the same, and in that lowering of excitement, I was able to view it more objectively.
I:17943;6313;That said this movie is still the best of the entire Batman legacy.
I:17943;6314;For criminals to work in the comic book world there has to be a connection between the superhero and the villain.
I:17943;6315;Indeed, The Dark Knight succeeds purely on the performance and writing for The Joker character.
I:17943;6316;He simply wants to inspire chaos for the sheer joy of seeing people devolve to the basest part of our collective human nature.
I:17943;6317;I actually like Bruce Wayne's skanky playboy vibe, the whole two.
I:17943;6318;in the end, however, this is a movie about The Joker and how this delectable character, arguably the best villain in comic book history, brings his toxic insanity to full bear on the world of Batman.
I:17943;6319;top that the whole movie sagged under the weight of his wink.
I:17943;6320;It was so clearly an actor hamming it up in a juicy role rather than something believable.
I:17943;6321;"The Dark Knight excels because Ledger left us with one bravura swan song, a character portrayal that accomplishes what so few comic book movies have been able to do
I:17943;6322;the Dark Knight is not a fantastic movie, but rather a good movie blessed with a superb, Oscar.
I:17943;6323;To my surprise, I ended up loving the experience.
I:17943;6324;the Dark Knight overcomes all of those problems and delivers something special.
I:17943;6325;The acting is superb and many of the cast are Oscar.
I:17943;6326;nolan's world is totally logical and could easily exist in reality.
I:17943;6327;the Dark Knight has enough thrills and action to satisfy fans of the genre, but it's much more than that.
I:17943;6328;It works as a character study and as a police procedural.
I:17943;6329;It's also a thriller, with elements of romance.
I:17943;6330;if there's one movie that transcends the genre, The Dark Knight is it.
I:17943;6331;Maggie Gyllenhaal creates a credible Rachel Dawes.
I:17943;6332;There is a hard edge to this movie, with many characters threatened.
I:17943;6333;note the river, Marina Towers, and so on and so on).
I:17943;6334;There was a natural close.
I:17943;6335;I thought Heath Ledger's performance was absolutely remarkable.
I:17943;6336;The story was so wonderfully woven together, the twists and turns played out beautifully.
I:17943;6337;It felt real and gritty.
I:17943;6338;ray and it is easily one of my favorite movies.
I:17943;6339;"up to ""Batman Begins,"" ""The Dark Knight"" is a rousing, action."
I:17943;6340;packed and emotionally exhilarating sequel, filled with twists and surprises that few will see coming.
I:17943;6341;Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, and Gary Oldman return from the first film, and give terrific performances as well.
I:17943;6342;maggie Gyllenhaal, who replaces Katie Holmes as Rachel, does a good job, though she tries too hard to be like Katie, and doesn't bring too much new to the table.
I:17943;6343;Aaron Eckhart is fantastic as Harvey Dent, and his transformation to Two.
I:17943;6344;But the best performance in the movie is, you guessed it, Heath Ledger as the Joker.
I:17943;6345;He brings a truly menacing, psychopathic presence to the character, bringing just the right amount of humor to make him fascinating.
I:17943;6346;Ledger's performance is truly terrifying, showing the talent he truly had, and makes Jack Nicholson's Joker look like a stupid clown.
I:17943;6347;"face was a great character
I:17943;6348;But these two drawbacks are minor, and the terrific writing and fantastic performances make up for it immensely.
I:17943;6349;This is a fantastic sequel that Batman and comic.
I:17943;6350;book aficionados will definitely enjoy!Movie Grade: A
I:17943;6351;The Dark Knight is arguably the very best comic book hero film of all time.
I:17943;6352;His Joker is far more evil and interesting than Nicholson's brilliant, but at times over.
I:17943;6353;Gary Oldman returns as Gordon in a much meatier role than his last outing, while both Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine return to their roles as Lucius Fox, Wayne's humorous gadget man, and Alfred, the wise butler, but in smaller roles this time around, but no less forgettable or supportive.
I:17943;6354;christopher Nolan's latest entry into the Batman franchise is flawless.
I:17943;6355;In addition, his script is nothing less than brilliant and is the best written of any super hero film I have ever seen.
I:17943;6356;Bale gives an Oscar nomination worthy performance, as does Oldman in his supporting role.
I:17943;6357;This is the best written villain I've seen in a comic book film and Ledger is destined for an Oscar nod if not an all out win for his last performance and it will NOT be out of pity over his untimely death, but because he is truly brilliant in this role that has no back story at all.
I:17943;6358;I was floored by how good this film is and although some may laugh at the next comment I make, I do stand by it: This film is positively worth a nomination for Best Picture and nods should also go to Nolan as director and screenwriter as well as the various actors I mentioned earlier.
I:17943;6359;This film is a cinematic masterpiece.
I:17943;6360;Besides that, the movie was great and very entertaining.
I:17943;6361;Christopher Nolan once again brings us superb writing with breathtaking cinematography and special effects, everything you want but rarely get in a superhero movie.
I:17943;6362;The story is a continuation of Batman Begins, with Bruce Wayne still fighting crime in everyday Gotham city with regulars like Jonathan Crane and irregulars like the Joker.
I:17943;6363;He gives Gotham the gritty tone it deserves, and what many fans have been waiting for since Batman Forever.
I:17943;6364;I am a huge batman fan and this was the best one yet.
I:17943;6365;I enjoy BatMan, and this was no exception.
I:17943;6366;The movie was enjoyable, and captured my attention throughout the entire time.
I:17943;6367;This movie has brought me back.
I:17943;6368;Not only is the movie one of the best super hero movies ever, it is also one of the best movies I have ever seen.
I:17943;6369;He's always shown himself to be a great actor but now, after watching him as the joker, I must say he has proven brilliant and oscar bound.
I:17943;6370;Funny enough, his death had nothing to do with the fact that his portrayal of the joker surpasses all of my favorite movie characters of all time including Jack Sparrow, John McClane, Sgt. Dignum, ect.
I:17943;6371;Sorry Mr. Nicholson, you're one of my favorite actors but you are no longer the joker.
I:17943;6372;Everyone does fantastically and the joker is out of this world brilliant and captivating.
I:17943;6373;I will see this movie several times and every time I do I will hang on every word Heath Ledger delivers.
I:17943;6374;I will look forward to seeing the oscars next year, and expect this movie to be rereleased for Academy Award viewing.
I:17943;6375;I hope Heath is somewhere where he can see the greatness of this picture.
I:17943;6376;The idea that justice trumps vengeance.
I:17943;6377;The Dark Knight takes this idea to extremes to suggest that justice is an ideal that must be protected at all costs.
I:17943;6378;Thus, the idea that justice is an ideal that must be protected at all costs is demonstrated.
I:17943;6379;it's a great story and a triumph of movie making in the age of fluff and crap.
I:17943;6380;And while Ledger's Joker is indeed brilliant it's no help to Christopher Nolan who does his best to turn him into a run.
I:17943;6381;Great movie, and nice miniature , will go nicely with the cowal on plinth that comes with the dark knight rises.
I:17943;6382;"Yep, that's right, they took a comic book character driven movie, and turned it into an episode of, ""Law and Order""."
I:17943;6383;because you see, the movie is trying so hard to be a mainstream crime drama, and distance itself from its beginning as a comic book, that Heath's Joker, and Bale's Batman seem out of place, and they pretty much would have been able to accomplish their roles without the costuming.
I:17943;6384;Excellent in every way .
I:17943;6385;Action and story line are extraordinary.
I:17943;6386;This is an awsome movie!
I:17943;6387;It has a great cast.
I:17943;6388;Heath Ledger did a great job as the Joker!
I:17943;6389;At less he did a great job acting in his last movie.
I:17943;6390;Love all the batman movies and heath ledger made the best joker of all time .
I:17943;6391;Great to own for the collection .
I:17943;6392;Heath Ledger gives the best performance I've ever seen in this movie.
I:17943;6393;The movie is ok, but no question, well worth watching for Ledger's performance.
I:17943;6394;This is a great movie at a great price and it was shipped fast, you can't beat that kind of a deal!
I:17943;6395;I love this movie the special effects the action scenes and not to mention the great acting of Heath ledger.
I:17943;6396;This is the best comic book movie ever.
I:17943;6397;heath Ledger's portral of The Joker was so mesmerizing that It gives you the creeps when you watch him.
I:17943;6398;the action sequences are mind blowing.
I:17943;6399;If you have not seen it yet then this is best chance to own the TOP 2 movie of all time.
I:17943;6400;Aaron Eckhart was quite good as Two Face (the make.
I:17943;6401;Watch it for Heath, who is mystery itself.
I:17943;6402;hyped big budgets films with fancy trailers, this one delivers the goods promised.
I:17943;6403;a special thanks to Gary Oldman for giving me The Commissioner I've always wanted to see done right.
I:17943;6404;Watching him play Gordan page for page is nothing short of raw pleasure.
I:17943;6405;A little on the dark side but great performance by Heath.
I:17943;6406;Christian Bale is a great Batman.
I:17943;6407;I bought the 2 disc 'special' edition, and i'm still trying to figure out what's special about it.
I:17943;6408;I recommend people get the single disc edition.
I:17943;6409;By far the best role was that of the Joker.
I:17943;6410;I did see it and it is good!
I:17943;6411;This movie for me was hands down the best movie of the 2008 calender year.
I:17943;6412;I loved the cars and the new costumes.
I:17943;6413;Introduction for newcomers:Since Tim Burton took one of the most famed superhero sagas and masterfully portrayed the nocturnal atmosphere in a well.
I:17943;6414;balanced comic book transcription to cinema back in 1989, his stunning and stylised vision and concept including the bleak and soaring urban waystelands, and the somber super.
I:17943;6415;human vigilante dressed in the best accomplished design for the legendary bat.
I:17943;6416;suit till date, degenerated in Joel Schumacher's colorful, fanciful toy.
I:17943;6417;christopher Nolan's cerebral style, full of intensity and focus towards the psychology of his tormented and demented characters, didn't seemed like an expected choice for the directing of the awaited return of the dark cape crusader to theaters in 2005.
I:17943;6418;However the results were astonishing: As a true visionary, Nolan didn't continue neither improved the previous crippled franchise, but resurrected and reintroduced with stunning originality and talent, the legacy of Batman unto audiences again.
I:17943;6419;"The detailed, dramatic but interesting evolution of the classic character portrayed on ""Batman begins"" along with the incredible imaginative script and full action sequences, ranks among the most compelling scenes ever filmed for this sub."
I:17943;6420;genre, giving to DC comics the worthy outing to compete with the more effective Marvel adaptations on screen.
I:17943;6421;The Dark Knight review (no spoilers):This sequel of the solid previous outing, is by all means the consolidation of Nolan's new, better, more in.
I:17943;6422;depth portrayal of the legend and graphic myth of Batman.
I:17943;6423;Glorious in its perfect detailed approach of the new dark paralel universe named Gotham City, outstanding in the search for strong emotions trought the focus on the double life and inner struggle of the haunted.
I:17943;6424;humor and pure evil homicidal schizophrenia.
I:17943;6425;A true sociopathic sense of humor about loving mayhem.
I:17943;6426;But the truth is that Batman's nemesis is in top form, inspired, stronger and more disturbingly sinister than any other known representation, including Mr Nicholson's over the top performance.
I:17943;6427;up as a battle flag, declaring his inner insane purposes as values of life: Total Chaos.
I:17943;6428;This movie fills the expectations in every possible way, giving the viewer a complete, gritty and astonishing ride into the phenomenal world of the Dark Knight and his quest for order and vengeance.
I:17943;6429;tech vehicles like armored cars, jets, boats equiped with machine guns and missiles, seemed admirable and visually spectacular.
I:17943;6430;In Nolan's more realistic self.
I:17943;6431;The original simplicity and effectiveness of the original concept,the dark bat silhouette terrifing criminals with a haunting music score, prevails with great balance in that matter.
I:17943;6432;There were powerful concepts behind the expected action movie.
I:17943;6433;This movie is more about Batman and the Joker and pushing the limits of each character, the portrayal of an epic battle in wich parallel stories don't loose importance, cause there's no ramifications in the straight forward solid plot.
I:17943;6434;Humanity is essential to accomplish deepness of characters and realism in the situations, in order to drag the audiences into magnified but serious events.
I:17943;6435;That's why Nolan didn't choose mutants between Batman's enemies but people on the edge like the main character, astonishing visuals are just a consequence of behaviour, of logic or emotional choices, and that's the goal here: Aproach, empathy, the stuff that makes a movie an experience beyond senses.
I:17943;6436;Your money's worth is guaranteed, no doubt.
I:17943;6437;SPECTACULAR viewing, in every single possible aspect.
I:17943;6438;Nolan's ingenious, artful but prudent use of the camera in big and small takes is amazing, such effectiveness turns every situation and place into an event to behold.
I:17943;6439;Nolan's best is still to come, and believe it or not, he didn't played his entire game.
I:17943;6440;This is one of my favorite movies.
I:17943;6441;The acting in The Dark Knight is magnificent.
I:17943;6442;"Christian Bale plays the best Batman next to Adam West and Michael Keaton (and he was definitely the best choice for the ""dark knight"" batman)."
I:17943;6443;In my mind, no one could top the wonderful job that Jack Nicholson did in the original Batman.
I:17943;6444;the movie itself is great.
I:17943;6445;It's entertaining and will have you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end.
I:17943;6446;The charecters are not engaging!
I:17943;6447;I bet you are happy if you're still reading this thing!
I:17943;6448;I did give it 3 stars.
I:17943;6449;that means I will watch it again.
I:17943;6450;A new and creepy interpretation of the Joker!
I:17943;6451;One of the few really interesting charecters in the mediocer Dark Knight.2.
I:17943;6452;Gary Oldman was great as Commisioner Gordon.
I:17943;6453;One of my favorite charecters.3.
I:17943;6454;More fun:Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal SkullHellboy II and the Golden ArmyIron ManThe Incredible HulkThe Mummy: The Tomb of the Dragon EmporerThe Journey to the Center of the EarthStar Wars Episode 1.6!
I:17943;6455;It's a great movie and I would suggest it to anyone who is a Batman fan.
I:17943;6456;I liked Batman begins much better then this movie.
I:17943;6457;This is still the best movie in my list!
I:17943;6458;The story line, the cast, and the music are so fantastic!!!
I:17943;6459;Amazing transformation as the Joker!
I:17943;6460;She brings more emotions to the part than Holmes ever could.
I:17943;6461;For us fans of the comic we understand just how important Alfred is to Bruce Wayne.
I:17943;6462;Not just a servant but also a medic, social worker, best friend and conscience.
I:17943;6463;Caine delivers in the films most under rated roll in my opinion.
I:17943;6464;His sociopathic behavior is perfect.
I:17943;6465;He (The Joker) obviously only truly values chaos, and Ledger's gritty performance captures that perfectly.
I:17943;6466;I found it funny but, at the two hour mark a character on the screen makes reference to using the bathroom and I heard four people around me groan.
I:17943;6467;This film is that riveting, you will not want to get out of your seat.
I:17943;6468;Action packed yes, but with a substantial plot and excellent acting make The Dark Night the best super hero film of this, and any summer to date.
I:17943;6469;One of the best movies i have seen.
I:17943;6470;I went to see it with my 2 bros and it was packed in the theater.
I:17943;6471;I knew Heath Ledger would get nominated and win the Oscar for his fantastic portrayal of the Joker after seeing it.
I:17943;6472;It has a great cast but, Heath does steal the show.
I:17943;6473;I was never really a big fan of Heath before it and I had seen a couple of his movies.
I:17943;6474;It is also much more than just a superhero movie I really don't even see it as one.
I:17943;6475;The movie has it all drama, action, comedy, romance.
I:17943;6476;It has something for everyone and the movie is just one of the greats.
I:17943;6477;Heath Ledger is simply amazing as the diabolical Joker who wants nothing more than to see the city burn and destroy itself.
I:17943;6478;Bale is great as Batman and as far as I'm concerned is to the Batman franchise what Daniel Craig is to the Bond franchise.
I:17943;6479;If he does win a posthumous Oscar, it is well deserved.
I:17943;6480;I had heard so many raves about the Dark Knight and it took me years to finally watch it.
I:17943;6481;A deeper look in to the Hero persona.
I:17943;6482;I also like that the film has a sense of mystery about how things will turn out.
I:17943;6483;This is a great and fun movie, though perhaps a little long.
I:17943;6484;where is the good stuff?
I:17943;6485;up, special effects, info on the hand.
I:17943;6486;"There should have also been a featurette about Heath Ledger
I:17943;6487;One of the best movies I have seen, it is rate up there with Born Ultimatum if not better!
I:17943;6488;You have to love batman and the joker is classic.
I:17943;6489;I absolutely loved, loved, loved his interpretation of The Joker.
I:17943;6490;Aaron Eckhart did an exceptional job as Two Face also.
I:17943;6491;This is my favorite batman.
I:17943;6492;Ledger's joker is simply amazing, so dark and twisted.
I:17943;6493;Typically, they have deleted or extended scenes, director commentary, and interviews with the actors.
I:17943;6494;this has NONE of those!
I:17943;6495;seriously, Heath Ledger gives one of the best villain performances of all times, and there isnt one interview?!?!?
I:17943;6496;It was the best and most haunting one I ever saw because of one man, Heath Ledger.
I:17943;6497;Rest in peace Mr. Ledger.
I:17943;6498;You were a great talent.
I:17943;6499;Don't get me wrong it's still entertaining.
I:17943;6500;Good acting, good story, special effects but i think it could have been done better.
I:17943;6501;Just watch it and enjoy every riveting moment.
I:17943;6502;Which is interesting considering how thoroughly in love with the dark it is.
I:17943;6503;insanity is another word that easily comes to mind.
I:17943;6504;Christian Bale's leading role in American Psycho is recalled here somewhat.
I:17943;6505;The Dark Knight thusly becomes as much a horror or psychological thriller as it is a heroic fantasy swathed in dusk, both figurative and literal.
I:17943;6506;Is it the purist in me complaining?All of the performances range from good to absolutely superb and Ledger's and Bale's tiny missteps (Is it just me?)
I:17943;6507;are made up for through their respective skills and conviction.
I:17943;6508;evil vs. Good, Chaos vs. Order, Sanity vs. Madness, it's all here in spades and is what makes The Dark Knight such a magnificent cinematic feast.
I:17943;6509;Thank you for this last gift, one that will continue to haunt us all for generations.
I:17943;6510;The Dark Knight is a 2008 film directed, produced, and co. written by Christopher Nolan.
I:17943;6511;It continues the ultra gritty Batman reboot and is the 2nd entry in a trilogy.
I:17943;6512;It is a powerhouse and arguably the best installment in the series.
I:17943;6513;The Dark Knight quickens the pace and takes the story even further in depth.
I:17943;6514;Christopher Nolen did an excellent job creating a Batman presentation that seems very realistic.
I:17943;6515;THe story appears to follow the Batman comic legend very well.
I:17943;6516;There are many excellent actors that returned for this film and there was also a few characters introduced.
I:17943;6517;The true twist introduced in The Dark Knight is the Joker played by Heath Ledger.
I:17943;6518;This very simple and straight to the point plot is driven to classic film heights with the likes of Christian Bale and Health Ledger battling it out for true comic book character actor supremacy.
I:17943;6519;The Joker brought a unique brand of pure danger and energy to the big screen that is rarely seen.
I:17943;6520;The Dark Knight is really a true blockbuster film.
I:17943;6521;It is entertaining, unsettling, and intriguing all at once.
I:17943;6522;Health Ledger will always be remembered for stepping into this world and playing the classic Joker role with the conviction and dedication.
I:17943;6523;This film was a high order success and a worthwhile venture into the heart of Gotham City.You.
I:17943;6524;I get the feeling that you and I are destined to do this forever.
I:17943;6525;Packed with explosive action, heavy.
I:17943;6526;And despite a flawless performance by Heath Ledger as Batman's archrival The Joker, the film weakens as Two.
I:17943;6527;face steals screen time from what was plenty enough mayhem for a single superhero.
I:17943;6528;and indeed, the most impressive aspect of The Dark Knight is Heath Ledger's performance.
I:17943;6529;Opening with a bank robbery scene that rivals the intensity in Heat's unforgettable holdup, Dark Knight leaps right into the action and rarely lets up.
I:17943;6530;"the unrelentingly baleful tone of the film makes The Dark Knight a perfect match to Batman Begins, and a real treat for fans itching for stark realism
I:17943;6531;top fun of the character has altogether vanished.
I:17943;6532;with amazing action sequences, a new Batcycle toy to play with, thrilling car chases, awe.
I:17943;6533;inspiring stunts, bazookas, the demolition of buildings, and generally entertaining anarchy, The Dark Knight may be too mortifying for some, and just right for others .
I:17943;6534;but Batman films always prove to be box office gold.
I:17943;6535;As a kid I totally bought it.
I:17943;6536;He told me that the music rights are tangling everything up.)
I:17943;6537;The bat suit got nipples.
I:17943;6538;so Warner Brothers let the (sparkling) dust settle and revived the franchise with Christopher Nolan.
I:17943;6539;that winning streak continues with THE DARK KNIGHT.
I:17943;6540;You don't get the feeling you're watching just a comic book movie, you're seeing genuine characters who inhabit a semi.
I:17943;6541;believable world of shifting lines and shadows.
I:17943;6542;Everything is top of the line.
I:17943;6543;But it's great and it blows away all the other films put together.
I:17943;6544;thank you, Christopher Nolan and the rest of the team!
I:17943;6545;I wondered if I would live to see a decent Batman movie and you've, so far, given us two.
I:17943;6546;Mr. Nolan and Mr. Goyer master piece is nothing less than riveting.
I:17943;6547;The affect draws the viewer closer to this classic icon and all the emotional highs and lows that come with being The Dark Knight.
I:17943;6548;The writing is original, witty and stays in the realms of what is possible even it's not very probable.
I:17943;6549;Basic story is good vs. evil and all the trials confronting true evil entails.
I:17943;6550;I've never been a fan of his but wow he simple stopped being human on screen and turned into the essence of evil.
I:17943;6551;I found his character scary because he was so believable in his role (Who was the last guy to play the Joker?
I:17943;6552;His performance alone ranks for me personally as one of the top ten screen performances I've ever seen.
I:17943;6553;originality: Most sequels are a lesser version of their predecessors or they simply suck.
I:17943;6554;special effects: Good special effects are the ones you don't know existed because they look so real.
I:17943;6555;This movie has a great blend of actual action and special effects.
I:17943;6556;Everything is finely crafted and looks awesome on the big screen.
I:17943;6557;The bat pod was a great extra touch as well.
I:17943;6558;music/Sound: The score is captivating and keeps the intense story going strong.
I:17943;6559;Great sound effects also especially on the bat pod.
I:17943;6560;fun: This movie was a great ride that surpassed all my expectations.
I:17943;6561;last take: TDK took me on a roller coaster ride and I loved every minute of it.
I:17943;6562;That being said I'm already a huge batman fan and especially liked Christopher Nolan's take on this recent installment.
I:17943;6563;This is sure to make it onto all top critics top one hundred best movie lists nuff said.
I:17943;6564;I had really enjoyed the first Dark Knight in the series.
I:17943;6565;This one, the second in the series was OK.
I:17943;6566;I'm sure the younger folks liked it more.
I:17943;6567;The movie was worth the wait.
I:17943;6568;I have been a fan since childhood and it's great to see Batman mature over the years on big screen with the exception of Batman and Robin.
I:17943;6569;This is one of my most favorite movies ever.
I:17943;6570;Heath Ledger is brilliant and Christian Bale is a boss
I:17943;6571;"That said, with ""The Dark Knight,"" they moved away from the (marginally interesting) character exploration we found in the prior film, made Christian Bale a supporting actor, and focused on a character that aside from being ""insane,"" simply wasn't all that interesting to watch, and again, I just didn't care all that much about his actions or his fate."
I:17943;6572;"and they seem to have forgetten what a truly ""great"" movie consists of (and I, for one, believe that critics have become more susceptible to hype, and less able to resist it (by being honest) within the last decade [Roger Ebert is a perfect example
I:17943;6573;"star (""masterpiece"") ratings to both ""Spiderman 2"" and ""X. men 2,"" both outwardly mediocre pictures])."
I:17943;6574;"star"" reviews here [and everywhere else where Blu."
I:17943;6575;For those viewing the film on Blu.
I:17943;6576;era comic book pictures) that you'll find it to be as enjoyable as you'd expected.
I:17943;6577;This is a great movie with a cool case.
I:17943;6578;This movie has easily become one of my favorite movies, Christopher Nolan has become my favorite director, over the Coen brothers, THE COEN BROTHERS!!!
I:17943;6579;well he has but never won anything.
I:17943;6580;the Dark Knight is simply the most well written, well acted, and entertaining superhero movies ever created.
I:17943;6581;The story is awesome, the acting is shockingly good, and the sound, cinematography, everything in this movie is perfection.
I:17943;6582;this movie will be remembered for ages, a billion stars =]
I:17943;6583;"I was all excited that ""TDK"" is finally coming out on Blu."
I:17943;6584;The IMAX parts look astounding on my Samsung 42'' plasma.
I:17943;6585;The movie was fine .
I:17943;6586;And when I saw that Amazon was offering the 2 Disk for 5 bucks, well I had to spring on that.
I:17943;6587;so two days later, the movie arrives and it is in French.
I:17943;6588;The box art has everything in both French and English on it.
I:17943;6589;great price I wish it would load the digital copy to my pc though the movie is very good and I enjoy movies
I:17943;6590;Jack Nicholson, Jim Carey, Danny DeVito, Tommy Lee Jones all played GREAT villains and stole the movies.
I:17943;6591;ledger was NOT funny and NOT believable.
I:17943;6592;An excellent sequel to the refreshing reboot Batman rises.
I:17943;6593;The superb portrayal of The Joker By Leger will leave you wondering, what could have been.
I:17943;6594;this is a Dark film and a great action film.
I:17943;6595;ray is the best i've ever scene.
I:17943;6596;it's worth the price just for the opening scene.
I:17943;6597;All I have to say is.
I:17943;6598;The new Batman movie is almost as good.
I:17943;6599;"When I was a little boy, my father took me to the theater to see a great film, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", and I was so impressed by the experience that I figured all 'summer films' would be as good."
I:17943;6600;"After watching The Dark Knight"", my permanent frown is now a smile as wide as possible."
I:17943;6601;The Dark Knight is a great film.
I:17943;6602;A film better than any fans had any right to expect or hope for.
I:17943;6603;It is the rare summer sequel that will cause people to eagerly anticipate more summer fare.
I:17943;6604;all of the best superhero movies feature both strong heroes and strong villains.
I:17943;6605;He also ups the ante considerably.
I:17943;6606;"But in doing so, he has created a massive film that breaks a lot of rules and is pretty challenging, for summer fare
I:17943;6607;But the film is also better because Nolan tries these things and accomplishes.
I:17943;6608;"In fact he has set the bar so high, it is now clear that all future superhero films will be measured against the first two ""Spiderman"" films or maybe ""Iron Man""."
I:17943;6609;Nolan's vision of Batman has transcended the genre of superhero film.
I:17943;6610;"The Dark Knight is darker, much darker in tone than ""Batman Begins"" and this is something most summer films stay away from."
I:17943;6611;Summer is a time for lighter fare, so making a film with a dark subject matter is a rule breaker.
I:17943;6612;The fact that it works is all the more rewarding to the viewer.
I:17943;6613;All Gordon has to do is turn on the Bat Signal and criminals go into hiding.
I:17943;6614;"nolan, who has created an impressive roster of films, adds ""The Dark Knight"" to this list and it is every bit as impressive as you can hope for."
I:17943;6615;And this success stems from the director's skill.
I:17943;6616;And also the screenplay he wrote with the aid of his brother, Jonathan.
I:17943;6617;Both areas are crafted in such a way to make sure everything fits together and works.
I:17943;6618;But it is also a film with a crystal clear message.
I:17943;6619;And this message is both subtle and extremely in our face.
I:17943;6620;This in turn makes the story deeper, more interesting and the idea really hits home.
I:17943;6621;And he wants this 'hero' exposed.
I:17943;6622;This is the more subtle presentation of this theme.
I:17943;6623;So Dent, with the help of Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) and his friend, Batman, begin to arrest all of the crime lords of Gotham.
I:17943;6624;headed coin to determine the fate of his victims.
I:17943;6625;"this brings me to my one small complaint about ""The Dark Knight""."
I:17943;6626;In every great superhero film, we see the birth of both the hero and the villain.
I:17943;6627;The Joker is a force to be reckoned with and Ledger gives a bravura performance and makes the character his own.
I:17943;6628;But Ledger explodes on the screen behind the Joker's greasy, gray green hair and his wickedly painted face.
I:17943;6629;In the end, Ledger's performance is so powerful you don't even mind that we don't have a back.
I:17943;6630;And he sets the bar for all others to follow.
I:17943;6631;He brings a heightened level of intensity to the character, giving us a deeper feeling for what Wayne is experiencing.
I:17943;6632;Caine is a great actor and it is nice to see him in a supporting role like this because even though Alfred doesn't have the biggest role in the story, he actually sort of does.
I:17943;6633;He is the man who helps Wayne stay centered, stay calm and make the right decisions.
I:17943;6634;He also helps Wayne run the huge corporation he owns and gives him the support he needs.
I:17943;6635;maggie Gyllenhaal steps into the role of Rachel Dawes and does a very good job.
I:17943;6636;Don't forget, she is one of only a handful of people who know the true identity of Batman and she remains true to this knowledge, protecting it even from Harvey.
I:17943;6637;But he has also assembled a top.
I:17943;6638;notch creative crew as well, and the film is as technically beautiful and accomplished as the performances.
I:17943;6639;In a handful of moments, a great panoramic view of Gotham pops up accompanied by slight white noise.
I:17943;6640;This is a great way of showing us what the characters are experiencing, what is driving the Joker mad, what is making Batman all the more anxious to have a normal life.
I:17943;6641;It provides a wider canvas for the action, giving us bigger, crystal clear images, more information and more to look at.
I:17943;6642;Quite honestly, the action scenes are fantastic and watching Bale's Batman speed through Gotham in the Batmobile or on the Batbike are just the beginnings of much more complicated action scenes.
I:17943;6643;Much of the film takes place at night and even these scenes are beautiful to watch because they are slightly moody, yet we never lose sight of the actors or the action.
I:17943;6644;"watching ""The Dark Knight"" is an exciting thing."
I:17943;6645;It is the rare film that breaks so many rules, yet you don't feel like you have been cheated.
I:17943;6646;Probably less than you can count on one hand.
I:17943;6647;"There is a lot of story in ""Knight"" but it all points to one theme, as discussed before, and all of this story helps to reinforce the main ideas."
I:17943;6648;The cast is filled with superlative actors, giving each of the characters depth we wouldn't normally expect from 'popcorn fare'.
I:17943;6649;The Dark Knight is the summer film we all want and hope for every time we plunk down our hard earned dollars for a film.
I:17943;6650;Now that we have had the pleasure of experiencing this work, we will be expecting more summer films to be this good.
I:17943;6651;I'm not sure if that is a good thing, because we are inevitably in for more letdowns.
I:17943;6652;The plot is great, really keeping your eyes glued to the screen!
I:17943;6653;And Keith Legend's portrayal of the Joker is the best I've ever seen, certainly better thanJack Nicholas!!
I:17943;6654;I really love Christian Bale as Batman.
I:17943;6655;He was great inBatman Begins.
I:17943;6656;It's a great movie and you won't regret it!
I:17943;6657;This is a great movie with a lot of action thanks Christian Bale!
I:17943;6658;good movie, lots of action and great to watch.
I:17943;6659;"What Christopher Nolan accomplished inBatman Beginspales next to ""The Dark Knight."""
I:17943;6660;and I LOVED what he did with Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson.
I:17943;6661;"And with ""The Dark Knight"" basically picking up close to where ""Batman Begins"" lets off, Christian Bales' Bruce Wayne is still coming to grips with the Batman part of his psyche."
I:17943;6662;The Joker is happy to jam his rusty humor into Batman's dementia and twist it as hard as he can.
I:17943;6663;As the movie jumps from plateau to plateau, the thrill ride is a pure adrenal rush.
I:17943;6664;"Add in The Joker's scary/funny interaction that finally drives Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart, looking regal) over the cliff into becoming Two Face, and this movie jiggers the characters' personalities with enough force to transcend the ""comic."
I:17943;6665;"Along with this summer's Iron Man triumph, ""The Dark Knight"" raises the bar on Superhero movies."
I:17943;6666;Great story and great acting.
I:17943;6667;In a few months I will probably watch it again.
I:17943;6668;Good action and lots of high points, still a good movie.
I:17943;6669;My friend/neighbor really liked this flick.
I:17943;6670;He's impressed with Heath Ledger's acting.
I:17943;6671;And, yeah, Batman is, after all, a comic book figure.
I:17943;6672;naw, it's more of a theme for a 12 year old.
I:17943;6673;so, if you're into a good story, this one has the depth of a Danielle Steele novel.
I:17943;6674;The visual effects and design were quite well done and enjoyable to watch, however.
I:17943;6675;The Joker steals this movie!
I:17943;6676;I didn't think there would be a better joker than Jack Nickelson, but this version of the Joker is hands down the best.
I:17943;6677;Heath Ledger is legendary in this role.
I:17943;6678;This movie is really good if you haven't seen it.
I:17943;6679;ray are the scenes shot with IMAX.
I:17943;6680;I was given this movie as a gift.
I:17943;6681;teen market who will think it is something new and spectacular because of the high sound volume and lots of useless killing.
I:17943;6682;everything that's been said about the sequel is true.
I:17943;6683;this is one superhero movie that lives up to its hype.
I:17943;6684;The real Batman (Christian Bale) shows up and puts a quick end to the mallee .
I:17943;6685;At the same time, Bruce Wayne and Harvey are both competing for the love of Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal).
I:17943;6686;director Christopher Nolan breaks new ground for the comic book film here.
I:17943;6687;creating one of the most sophisticated and intricate films of its kind ever produced.
I:17943;6688;The script from Nolan and his brother Jonathan is just top notch reminding me once again why I love their work.
I:17943;6689;The world of TDK is grounded in reality.
I:17943;6690;bale's Batman/Bruce Wayne continues to impress.
I:17943;6691;meanwhile, Ledger is superb as the Joker.
I:17943;6692;gyllenhaal's Rachel is miles ahead of the way that Katie Holmes played her in Batman Begins.
I:17943;6693;While Eckhart is a perfect fit as Dent.
I:17943;6694;oldman, Morgan Freeman as Fox and Michael Caine as Alfred offer able support as always.
I:17943;6695;the film boasts a spectacular cycle/car/truck chase and a nifty aerial stunt.
I:17943;6696;"and while Ledger's death earlier this year was tragic, the movie will forever stand as a reminder of what an actor could do in a ""comic book movie"" to help make it great."
I:17943;6697;"Yes, Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" is an excellent film without question."
I:17943;6698;They're obviously saving the real good stuff for next year's release after Ledger's won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his amazing portrayal of the Joker.
I:17943;6699;it's made on the batmobile or some commentary by the obviously talented director.
I:17943;6700;I was very satisfied that it work wonderfully with the Sony blue ray player.
I:17943;6701;It was definitely as good as I'd heard.
I:17943;6702;But something I have not yet seen on any review (either in the media or on amazon) is how this movie really is more of a theme.
I:17943;6703;man 2's suggestion that we have a responsibility to use our talents wisely, for the greater good) are secondary to the plot itself.
I:17943;6704;The movies, at their root, are about superheroes fighting super villains.
I:17943;6705;"This one seems to be more about the universal existence of evil, chaos, and violence in the real world
I:17943;6706;It only uses comic book characters to tell the tale.
I:17943;6707;"As such, Dark Knight is a step above pretty much every other superhero/comc book flick that I've ever seen (and I've seen a lot), and aspires to the level of a ""fine film,"" not just a summer popcorn diversion."
I:17943;6708;Batman, Harvey Dent, and Jim Gordon are the characters who show how sometimes it is necessary to descend into the craziness and corruption that is the Joker, even in order to fight it.
I:17943;6709;He is simply amazing as a primal, insane, terrifying villain who at any moment could do anything at all.
I:17943;6710;"I really liked Jack Nicholson's 1989 performance, and I'm not sure it was ""better"" or ""worse"" ."
I:17943;6711;definitive look at the Joker.
I:17943;6712;to top it all off, Christopher Nolan pulls off such an amazing look at the real world, and the human psyche, and the evil which is such a temptation to us all, in a way that absolutely nails the characterization of all the principal figures.
I:17943;6713;Batman, Bruce Wayne, the Joker, Harvey Dent/Two Face, and James Gordon all seem like they are lifted right off the comic page and transplanted onto the screen.
I:17943;6714;I am astounded that a movie about superheroes had this much depth and real.
I:17943;6715;life significance, and was still such a joy to watch.
I:17943;6716;i'm not sure if this was the most entertaining comic book movie I've ever seen, but it certainly was the most complex and finely crafted.
I:17943;6717;Both the way the themes play out on the big screen, and the performance of Heath Ledger, continued to resonate in my memory well after I'd seen it.
I:17943;6718;This movie is simply amazing .
I:17943;6719;What I love about his take on Batman is that it's very realistic.
I:17943;6720;As for the movie, it's an amazing story, with one of the best performances ever, by the late Heath Ledger who I really couldn't stand until this movie!
I:17943;6721;As with all Nolan movies, it's a very visually appealing film, with a great story, and cast perfectly.
I:17943;6722;I can honestly say that this is as good as it gets!
I:17943;6723;Just as it took comic books over 40 years to become mature, complex, and relevant, it's taken the film industry about 30 years to make a superhero film that transcends clever self.
I:17943;6724;awareness and intense action sequences.
I:17943;6725;The Dark Knight is a film without pretension or self.
I:17943;6726;consciousness, the Batman film comic book readers have hardly dared dream of.
I:17943;6727;"It is the best film since Richard Donner's classic ""Superman"" in 1978."
I:17943;6728;This is the greatest comic book film of all time, because this is a comic book film that makes you forget it's a comic book film.
I:17943;6729;warner Bros. and the film's producers made a brilliant decision hiring Christopher Nolan to re.
I:17943;6730;"Nolan had previously made three immensely artistic and acclaimed independent films, chiefly 2000's ""Memento."""
I:17943;6731;He was and is a director who will never compromise his vision.
I:17943;6732;He may be the most skilled director in the business.
I:17943;6733;He's also one of the most cerebral directors, which is perfect for dealing with a character as psychologically complex as Bruce Wayne .
I:17943;6734;Nolan's Wayne, played by the peerless Christian Bale, is a character who cannot escape his past, and who has built himself a vehicle to clear a path for a bright future.
I:17943;6735;Gyllenhaal is a much more satisfying actor, and she brings much more plausibility to the character.
I:17943;6736;Rachel Dawes represents the perfect life that Bruce Wayne dreams of, the life that he feels Batman will give him.
I:17943;6737;The Harvey Dent storyline is a fan favorite, set.
I:17943;6738;Aaron Eckhart is perfectly cast: he has a genuine, all.
I:17943;6739;american strength that's just what the role requires.
I:17943;6740;"garnering performance was in 2005's ""Thank You for Smoking""
I:17943;6741;It's especially bizarre, and, its own way, awesome, that Ledger's final performance is as a character so chilling and unforgettable as the Joker.
I:17943;6742;Last played by Jack Nicholson in 1989, the Joker is Batman's nemesis, and may be the most famous of all comic book villains.
I:17943;6743;top comic relief Burton's film needed.
I:17943;6744;He has an Irish grin (if you don't know what that is, look it up).
I:17943;6745;those who say Ledger carries the film are missing the point, because there's so much more to the film, but it is certainly the highlight of the picture.
I:17943;6746;Morgan Freeman is as delightful as ever.
I:17943;6747;Even more delightful is Michael Caine, whose warm yet cheeky portrayal of Alfred, Wayne's butler/father figure, adds some much.
I:17943;6748;"Isn't there a similar feeling running through our country right now?Chris Nolan's last film, ""The Prestige,"" was a spectacular piece of filmmaking."
I:17943;6749;"But without a question, ""The Dark Knight"" trumps it."
I:17943;6750;Nolan is at the top of his game.
I:17943;6751;His style shines through the film, but never rises above the character, a problem which plagued the previous Batfilms.
I:17943;6752;Instead, Nolan's style, dark, gritty, and heavy, blends with the character.
I:17943;6753;Nolan and Batman are a perfect pair.
I:17943;6754;shot, the film is perfect.
I:17943;6755;This film deserves a Best Film Editing Oscar.
I:17943;6756;maybe, though, the Academy will rise up and realize what they have in their hands: a masterpiece.
I:17943;6757;It's a masterpiece of superhero films, staying true to the classic storylines, but also fully realizing the depth and psychological complexities of each and every character.
I:17943;6758;And it's a masterpiece of cinema, period.
I:17943;6759;The Dark Knight is a film in the classical sense.
I:17943;6760;Its storylines are captivating, intriguing, grand, and clever.
I:17943;6761;"Michael Caine said it best: ""Superman is the way America sees itself."
I:17943;6762;If that's so, we have a long and dark path ahead of us.
I:17943;6763;In one of the film's best sequences, Batman decides to forcibly extradite Lau, the head of a Chinese corporation that is in league with Gotham's underworld.
I:17943;6764;Not only does Batman glide from one Hong Kong skyscraper to another, but he also devises a way for to hitch a ride with an in.
I:17943;6765;The police procedural aspect to the film accomplishes something that we rarely see in the comic books which are often concerned with flitting from one action panel to another: presenting the Gotham as a living, breathing city.
I:17943;6766;He threatens to continue killing Gotham's citizens until Batman reveals his identity to the public, and when Harvey Dent turns himself in as Batman in order to calm an agitated public, the Joker attacks Dent's SWAT team convoy in a dazzling set piece.
I:17943;6767;Later the Joker will make Batman choose between the life of Gotham's one true hero, the law abiding Harvey Dent, and Wayne's childhood friend Rachel Dawes, graciously recast from Katie Holmes to Maggie Gyllenhaal.
I:17943;6768;Despite the fact that Ledger's Joker only appears for a grand total of ten and a half minutes in the entire two and a half hour movie, he successfully hijacks the film.
I:17943;6769;It is in this moment that the Joker seduces the audience to his point of view.
I:17943;6770;For just a second we get to see the joy and absolute freedom of anarchic will.
I:17943;6771;I have always felt that a great portrayal of the Joker lies not in his body count (although there's plenty of that here), but in his ability to convince an audience that his form of freewheeling violence might be just a little enjoyable.
I:17943;6772;Like in the best horror movies, a genre from which Nolan also borrows, the Joker is scary because he defies traditional Enlightenment notions of reason.
I:17943;6773;the central idea of The Dark Knight, that we are willing to cross ethical lines when the personal safety of ourselves and loves ones is broached, is embodied in the character of Harvey Dent.
I:17943;6774;he is surprisingly tolerant of Batman for a DA.
I:17943;6775;the film explicitly positions him as the opposite of the caped crusader, as a man who works within the system and still manages to put criminals behind bars.
I:17943;6776;face, one of Batman's most complex villains.
I:17943;6777;While I'm sure most moviegoers were happy with Two.
I:17943;6778;Besides, when will this great character get the full spotlight he deserves?In some ways The Dark Knight is a messier film than its predecessor, but it more than makes up for it by being a much more ambitious film as well.
I:17943;6779;Arguably the greatest improvement between the first film and the second is Nolan's increased comfort shooting action scenes.
I:17943;6780;In Nolan's world there's a deep distrust of the people.
I:17943;6781;democratic point of view that not only makes the film an intriguing in its own right, but also makes it a unique blockbuster.
I:17943;6782;million dollar success stories are as critical of the type of widespread populism that makes the summer blockbuster possible in the first place?
I:17943;6783;I may not agree with The Dark Knight's view of the world, and at times its theorizing can be incredibly thin, but it is a rare big budgeted film that makes us question our own moral fortitude.
I:17943;6784;I mean, this is Batman's all time hardest enemy.
I:17943;6785;He makes Stephen King's IT look like a simple mad dog.
I:17943;6786;Tommy Lee Jones was believable with his loud mouth and his action sequences, but Aaron Eckhart pulled off the insanity and angry bits very well.
I:17943;6787;rest in peace, Heath Ledger.
I:17943;6788;Very enjoyable, can't wait for the next one!
I:17943;6789;Heath Ledger's performance was amazing.
I:17943;6790;I recommend V for Vendetta if your looking for a more political superhero movie.
I:17943;6791;The movie arrived well within the estimated time of delivery and was exactly as described on the page!
I:17943;6792;Batman was always about truth and justice.
I:17943;6793;Forget this as it makes Batman no better than the criminals that he is hunting.
I:17943;6794;Thanks to the producers of this film for ruining the last of my childhood heroes.
I:17943;6795;I will never watch another Batman film after this piece of dren.
I:17943;6796;In my opinion he is the greatest comic book hero next to spiderman.
I:17943;6797;This version of Batman is the best I've seen since the first batman movie with Michael Keaton.
I:17943;6798;but he's very good as James Gordon.
I:17943;6799;Christopher Nolan directs superbly, and the pacing never slows down, Batman Begins was very well done as well, but this film even blows that clear out of the water.
I:17943;6800;tim Burton did a good job with what he had to work with.
I:17943;6801;A little dash of acting and story plot?I enjoyed this film and it makes a great addition to my collection.
I:17943;6802;If you are a Batman fan then this is probably a film for you.
I:17943;6803;please entertain my human mind I'm inquisitive, not just my animal mind with shiny lights and sounds, give me something to think, to ponder, to desire, to look up to.
I:17943;6804;"There's lots of action in ""The Dark Knight""."
I:17943;6805;He played the character perfectly!
I:17943;6806;This is a great movie made better by Blu.
I:17943;6807;Pure awesome for the Batman fan.
I:17943;6808;They don't understand how brilliant this movie really is.
I:17943;6809;Truly one of the best comic book adaptations I've ever seen on film.
I:17943;6810;Iron Man was great, but it wasn't brilliant.
I:17943;6811;This film is one of the best movies I've seen in years.
I:17943;6812;Get onboard with one of the best movies in years.
I:17943;6813;Alright, so here it is, the most anticipated film of the year.
I:17943;6814;Hailed even before it's release as the superhero movie that transcends the genre, the unforgettable final performance of one of Hollywood's finest, the Batman story to eclipse all other adaptations, The Resurrection on film.
I:17943;6815;Oh there are thrills, all right, but they're the kind that make you laugh out of sheer shock and discomfort or smile a black smile at the twisted self.
I:17943;6816;The Dark Knight is a turbo.
I:17943;6817;The Joker didn't invent madness, he has simply perfected it as a weapon.
I:17943;6818;You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain is another of the many lines in this film that are destined to become classics in the annals of comic filmdom.
I:17943;6819;"That saying holds true throughout the events of ""The Dark Knight""."
I:17943;6820;Gotham City's new hotshot District Attorney Harvey Dent is hailed as the city's White Knight.
I:17943;6821;"throws his support behind Dent and hails him as the hero Gotham needs
I:17943;6822;borrowing from his favorite crimefighter.
I:17943;6823;"Every scene a classic
I:17943;6824;That is the very definition of a masterful performance.
I:17943;6825;The Joker wants every supposed hero in Gotham to become, in a sense, a villain and will use any means to accomplish that end.
I:17943;6826;Meanwhile, turning the finest citizens of Gotham against each other is just an amusing bonus.
I:17943;6827;the rest of the cast is an ensemble that drive the story whenever Ledger isn't onscreen.
I:17943;6828;Like Wolverine, he's the best as what he does.
I:17943;6829;Christian Bale: brilliant as Bruce Wayne but not always convincing in cape and cowl.
I:17943;6830;Maggie Gyllenhaal: not as cute as Katie Holmes, but a convincing performance as a woman torn between two heroes.
I:17943;6831;Aaron Eckhart: a great underdog performance as Harvey Dent.
I:17943;6832;the plotters and schemers, the politicians, lawyers, and criminals do that.
I:17943;6833;if you made it all the way through my ramblings, I congratulate and heartily embrace you.
I:17943;6834;It is however, the most ambitious and broadest in scope, and for that I will applaud it until my hands hurt.
I:17943;6835;there's something about Michael Keaton, as Batman, and Jack Nicholson, as the Joker, that just can't be beat with remakes.
I:17943;6836;I've watched all the Batman films, and by far, Batman 1989, is the ideal Batman film.
I:17943;6837;michael Keaton is the best Batman.
I:17943;6838;Keaton is Batman when we see him in the film.
I:17943;6839;Also Mike's personality is darker, more intellectually savvy, and unique, than Christian Bale's attempts to fit into the character with the later Dark Knight film.
I:17943;6840;Jack Nicholson, actually throws life into the character with his unique touch into the twisted personality, he adds a ton of glitz and makes the Joker appear more human, and more psycho in a realistic way.
I:17943;6841;"The Dark Knight is more than a pop culture phenomenon
I:17943;6842;Christopher Nolan, along with writers David S. Goyer and Jonathan Nolan, has crafted a very thoughtful, engaging story chock full of symbolism and nuances.
I:17943;6843;Batman Begins had a far more satisfying 2.
I:17943;6844;I enjoyed this movie, mainly because even through all the twisted violence and insane action it truly was a story of the human condition, and we won.
I:17943;6845;how frickin' hard can it be to make a entertaining movie about comic book heroes?
I:17943;6846;i was VERY surprised as to how much I enjoyed this movie.
I:17943;6847;This movie does, and even exceeds it, in my opinion.
I:17943;6848;the story is very good.
I:17943;6849;The cinematography is great (very important for a comic.
I:17943;6850;highly recommended and it gives me a little hope for the future.
I:17943;6851;excellent movie, deserving awards, enjoyed it, again, my thanks to the movie makers and actors on entertaining us, the public.
I:17943;6852;Otherwise, this was a great movie and, I'm sure you've heard this before, but Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker was off the charts great.
I:17943;6853;There was a moment, right before settling in to watch The Dark Knight, where I felt dread that it could not possibly live up to it's hype.
I:17943;6854;It builds on what made Batman Begins so great and totally meets all expectations.
I:17943;6855;The Dark Knight has a strong theme that runs through the whole movie about what it takes to make someone do the evil that we do.
I:17943;6856;Heath Ledger made this movie special and proves why The Joker is Batman's best villian.
I:17943;6857;which is actually fine .
I:17943;6858;Heath Ledger and his amazing performance IS the movie, and that's kindof the problem.
I:17943;6859;He's got all the best lines, the best makeup, the best clothes, all the comic relief .
I:17943;6860;Now, the premise of the flick is sound, and the telling of the story is competent but this movie could have been SO much better and so much more entertaining if they'd cast Viggo Mortensen as the Batman.
I:17943;6861;"He's got the jaw for it
I:17943;6862;"But put Mortensen in the Batman role
I:17943;6863;And finally, much as I love Michael Caine, if you cast Mortensen as Batman, Caine would be out and you know who would play Alfred?
I:17943;6864;He pouted alot and growled alot but far as I could tell he was as good and pure a superhero as Gotham City could have asked for.
I:17943;6865;I ordered this movie to stream on my blu.
I:17943;6866;i never got to watch it.
I:17943;6867;This is a pure masterpiece.
I:17943;6868;The music is great, the photography is great, the screenplay is great, the actors are great, especially Heath Ledger (HE IS THE PERFECT JOKER, just forget Jack Nicholson).
I:17943;6869;It's an amazing movie, probably the best superhero movie ever.
I:17943;6870;Christopher Nolan is definitely an astounding director.
I:17943;6871;As a bank robbery unfolds, the criminals end up double.
I:17943;6872;Somehow a little humor could have humanized all the comic book characters and made the film a lot more enjoyable.
I:17943;6873;i bought this just to display as i have the dark knight allready but not this special edition, huge batman fan and the dark knight is one of the greatest movies in the last 30 years period, you have it all, awesome action scenes, very realistic characters that just pull all the emotion out of you, its got everything!
I:17943;6874;After watching The Dark Knight in glorious blu.
I:17943;6875;ray last night, I can say for sure it is the best title to come out on the format to date.
I:17943;6876;just packed with more interviews and behind the scenes looks.
I:17943;6877;Very handy if you enjoy putting the movie on your computer at no extra cost.
I:17943;6878;Great for ipods!The Dark Knight will convince any skeptic of Blu.
I:17943;6879;ray that they should take a closer look.
I:17943;6880;A perfect representation of what Batman is.
I:17943;6881;Director Chris Nolan really took five steps forward with this film.
I:17943;6882;It has an epic and profound scale compared to his other movies.
I:17943;6883;The movie struck awe in America and we felt our benchmarks for films raising as we watched it.
I:17943;6884;the film itself has an amazing twisted story.
I:17943;6885;After my second viewing more information was revealed to me, so it is a lot to take in.
I:17943;6886;I usually dislike actor changes but Maggie Gyllenhaal fit into the film very nicely.
I:17943;6887;Eckhart really impressed me this time through.
I:17943;6888;When he went through his transformation he really felt the angst of Dent.
I:17943;6889;Our returning actors surpassed their entry into the first film, but I won't delve into that so much.
I:17943;6890;our one actor that brought something new and shocking was Heath Ledger.
I:17943;6891;We should see him as his normal self backstage to make ourselves feel better.
I:17943;6892;And acknowledge that he existed.
I:17943;6893;The Imax filming is perfect.
I:17943;6894;Special features might not impress a lot of people but I enjoyed them for what they were.
I:17943;6895;It is a landmark in movie history.
I:17943;6896;And we should all give respect to Ledger's performance and to all the other people who worked day and night to make this film extrodinary.
I:17943;6897;i was very pleased with the movie , heath ledger did a outstanding job as the joker that will be hard to replace.
I:17943;6898;i'd recommend it to all movie watchers.
I:17943;6899;Any big blockbuster sequel will receive an enormous amount of attention, but combined that with the mysterious death of Heath Ledger, and it's no wonder why this went to become one of the top 4 biggest movies of all time.
I:17943;6900;The reason for that goes much deeper.
I:17943;6901;"it touches on deep psychological issues and forces the viewer to take a look at human philosophy surrounding morality and the issues of ""good"" and ""evil""."
I:17943;6902;The fact that good and evil are so intertwined in this movie is one of the reasons why it is the modern masterpiece that it is.
I:17943;6903;He completely throws himself into the role, and with the absolutely perfect makeup job, completely obliterates the line between actor and character.
I:17943;6904;this is the way that character should be played, better than any actor before him, and better than the fool in the cartoons and comic books.
I:17943;6905;He wants to show the world what happens to the rules of morality in times of crisis or chaos.
I:17943;6906;After a horrifying disruption of life, what qualifies as good?
I:17943;6907;In the end, it is the morally.
I:17943;6908;"But which one is ultimately remembered as the hero Gothem deserves?Psychology and philosophy aside, ""The Dark Knight"" is simply an awesome action movie with an awesome cast (you know when Morgan Freeman is in a movie, it's gotta be good)."
I:17943;6909;"Gary Oldman perfectly plays the ultimate ""good guy"" in James Gordon."
I:17943;6910;And Michael Caine plays the definitive Alfred.
I:17943;6911;it is refreshing to see a movie that isn't just explosions, se x, or fart jokes, but still manages to get the world's collective attention.
I:17943;6912;The true star, Heath Ledger, stands out as a powerful acting force, and creates the ultimate Joker that leaves its predecessors paling in comparison.
I:17943;6913;definitely worthy of an Academy Award.
I:17943;6914;the writing, filming and direction are also perfect, as is the score of the movie, which completes the film in a truly satisfying way.
I:17943;6915;This is a movie where your heart is always in your gut.
I:17943;6916;As an action movie, it is all you can ask for plus so much more.
I:17943;6917;truly an action packed, kick as s movie.
I:17943;6918;But this is merely a cover for a truly emotional, psychological, and philosophical message of life, its values, its ethics, and its morals.
I:17943;6919;It is an adventure, filled with action and suspense crossed with psychology and philosophy, comprised of serious, capable intelligence, full of beauty, terror and moral.
I:17943;6920;"conundrums, redefining action, comic book, and ""good vs. evil"" movies."
I:17943;6921;"Gone are the easily digestible taglines such as ""with great power comes great responsibility."""
I:17943;6922;"Gone are the freak accident, the crazy magic powers, the regular villain/hero dynamic, and the fist fights for the future of the world, and gone is the ""all is good"" fairy tale endings."
I:17943;6923;in its place we have an intelligent, dark thriller that forces you to truly look at the deep inner issues of the psychology and philosophy of morality.
I:17943;6924;Truly refreshing, truly moving, and truly rewarding.
I:17943;6925;The Dark Knight takes you on a white knuckle thrill ride both in the city of Gothem and in the privacy of your mind and soul, and never lets up.
I:17943;6926;"It is a dark masterpiece that ""leaps beyond its origin and becomes a truly satisfying, engrossing tragedy."
I:17943;6927;A work of genius, it is a film that transcends the boundaries of a genre and asks some of deepest questions in all of film.
I:17943;6928;Psychology, philosophy, action, and drama have never been combined so powerfully, so slightly, and so masterly to create a treasure that should be cherished by the viewer.
I:17943;6929;Arguably the greatest film of the decade.
I:17943;6930;Not only one of the true landmarks of American Cinema, but simply one of the greatest pieces of film ever to grace the silver screen.
I:17943;6931;Straight in my face, from the beginning I was on the edge of my seat.
I:17943;6932;He did an excellent job of playing the psychotic joker.
I:17943;6933;There is absolutely nothing wrong with this movie.
I:17943;6934;This is a Great Movie.
I:17943;6935;Watch a trailer online and I think you will be hooked.
I:17943;6936;One of the great movies of all time.
I:17943;6937;A great cast and performance by Heath Ledger that should earn him an Oscar.
I:17943;6938;this is a great movie that any none or batman fan will enjoy .
I:17943;6939;Not only is The Dark Knight the best movie of 2008, it is also THE best comic book movie ever.
I:17943;6940;The emotions were real, the characters felt real and most importantly, Batman is not your typical superhero.
I:17943;6941;He has no powers that are extraordinary or special.
I:17943;6942;He made himself into what he is and that is the difference between this saga and all the wannabees.
I:17943;6943;Bale, Oldman, and of course Ledger are the reason this movie is so wonderful.
I:17943;6944;Everyone just does a fantastic job and by the end you just want it to continue, to see and to know more about each character.
I:17943;6945;the plot is a bit tricky to put into words and requires more than viewing to really appreciate all that is going on, but it really is a rich and engaging story that will probably feel as fresh ten years from now.
I:17943;6946;This is more than a comic book movie, this is a drama/action/crime film all in one.
I:17943;6947;And it deserves all the praise and recognition it gets.
I:17943;6948;I rewatched this movie in anticipation of Dark Knight Rises.
I:17943;6949;Heath Ledger is amazing as the Joker and the whole cast was excellent (except for Maggie Gyllenhaal, who was not that compelling).
I:17943;6950;zealous fans' personal step by step synopsis of the storyline.
I:17943;6951;The Dark Knight achieves greatness in ways that will leave the audience dazzled, and overwhelmed.
I:17943;6952;Christopher Nolan has made a film that I can't even place within the superhero genre.
I:17943;6953;It seems that the good that was started by Bruce Wayne's alter.
I:17943;6954;the Joker, played by the late Heath Ledger is without a doubt the shining performance of this magnificent film, providing moviegoers and fans of the Batman comics of recent years a dark, twisted, truly psychotic Joker.
I:17943;6955;This is the first time the Joker's twisted character has been brought to the big screen.
I:17943;6956;"Pressured by bold actions by the people of Gotham, Batman and rising ""White Knight, District Attorney Harvey Dent the mob leaders give into the crazed individual's demands."
I:17943;6957;up and a costume suit The Joker begins to terrorize the streets of Gotham, with a promise of killing until Batman reveals his true identity.
I:17943;6958;The Joker, who lives without rules soon, obtains a strong hold over the people of Gotham with his unpredictable antics.
I:17943;6959;The art direction, sets and overall feel of the film captures a perfect balance that makes these characters who have frequented comic pages for over sixty years seem very real.
I:17943;6960;that's what makes this film great, and that is not a super hero film, it is a crime film that examines and studies human emotion and morals to an extent that very few movies have done in previous years.
I:17943;6961;the fact that it mixes a deep plot in with things a mainstream audience appreciates, such as the action sequences, shows that it is perhaps the best film of the last ten years, and certainly succeeds where all other super hero films have failed.
I:17943;6962;without a doubt The Dark Knight is a great achievement in cinema and will be a classic.
I:17943;6963;There you can get Batman's dark undertones, without much need to worry for the child's well being, and they're enjoyable for all age groups.
I:17943;6964;Instant video paused to load several times but movie is great!
I:17943;6965;This movie is by far my favorite in the series.
I:17943;6966;My mom and I absolutely adore the Joker for some strange reason.
I:17943;6967;I would recommend this to anyone who loves a lot of action.
I:17943;6968;One of the best and last work of Heath Legar.
I:17943;6969;Just as good as the first movie.
I:17943;6970;I love it and get it blu ray, watch it on a 120Hz Sony Bravia using a playstation 3 with Bose 321 GS Speakers and wake the neighbourhood up.
I:17943;6971;This movie is soo incredible.
I:17943;6972;I think the movie was one of the best action movies ever made.
I:17943;6973;I also thought Christian Bale was very good in the movie as well.
I:17943;6974;This is one of my favorite movies and I'm looking forward to the next movie in this series.
I:17943;6975;Next to The Patriot, it is Heath Ledgers best performance.
I:17943;6976;ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!This great film left me breathless.
I:17943;6977;He had me cheering for him, and it's rare that I side with the villain characters.
I:17943;6978;It is Finally here, A Batman Movie That is as good as The 1989's Batman Film!!!
I:17943;6979;*shivers*) and finally a great batman film has come.
I:17943;6980;Fan Of Batman and non fans will Enjoy this Masterpeice.
I:17943;6981;It is a must own, must See.
I:17943;6982;This was a good movie.
I:17943;6983;I do recommend watching the movie.
I:17943;6984;heath Ledger was amazing as The Joker.
I:17943;6985;Action packed with great acting by the entire cast.
I:17943;6986;michael Caine, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Aaron Eckhart are great in their smaller supporting rules, esp.
I:17943;6987;The action sequences are done expertly, especially the circus big rig and the armored vehicle chase.
I:17943;6988;there is definitely a very dark tone to this film, with Batman not being quite the hero that people want him to be, and many people turning against him as a vigilante who can't always be what they want him to be and can't always stop the evil in time.
I:17943;6989;He's a regular person, after all.
I:17943;6990;This is another great hit from Chris Nolan and its the best batman movie I have seen.
I:17943;6991;One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, but a double whammy of recent outspoken independence regarding the film really clinched it for me.
I:17943;6992;worthy, which would be unheard of for a comic book movie.
I:17943;6993;The well paced acting and dry satirical script make this flick somewhat a masterpiece.
I:17943;6994;"The movies are ""The Ultimate Matrix Collection"", ""The Dark Knight"", ""Batman Begins"" and ""Blade Runner""."
I:17943;6995;Watching Dark knight for a movie buff like me is like a treat.
I:17943;6996;this has a great starcast too.
I:17943;6997;Both Nolan and Heath ledeger have done extraordinary job at that.
I:17943;6998;awoke the series after the campy films Joel Schumacher put out in the late 90s, this masterpiece was released.
I:17943;6999;this film brings back the serious side of the dark knight that the first two films captured perfectly.
I:17943;7000;christian Bale does an oscar worthy job as Bruce Wayne, on par with Michael Keaton's perfect performance.
I:17943;7001;The movie in blu ray adds another dimension with the IMAX scenes.
I:17943;7002;The sound and image for the scenes is unforgettable and overall the movie is fantastic.
I:17943;7003;But, I enjoyed this movie more than any movie I have ever seen.
I:17943;7004;It succeeds on a number of levels: as a crime drama, as a cop film and as the best superhero movie.
I:17943;7005;Hopefully, next year's Watchmen is just as good.
I:17943;7006;It is definitely a keeper and well worth watching over and over again.
I:17943;7007;The digital copy expired on 12/9/09 and I received it today 12/15/09.
I:17943;7008;This movie is one of the best I have seen.
I:17943;7009;It has some great acting and great action.
I:17943;7010;Being able to watch the movie instantly after I bought it was a wonderful perk too.
I:17943;7011;This is very impressive on blue ray.
I:17943;7012;my family really enjoys this move.
I:17943;7013;Everything is present in the movie, viewers: good script, great direction and top notch CGI.
I:17943;7014;Just pop you some popcorn, kick up your feet and enjoy.
I:17943;7015;The graphics make it even more interesting to watch and are absolutely stunning.
I:17943;7016;This damn movie is just phenomenal.
I:17943;7017;I have seen it about thirty times and I still watch it like its the first time.
I:17943;7018;I liked bruce in this one than batman even though I love what they did with his suit.
I:17943;7019;Let me tell you folks that that movie is going to be a monumental event of our time.
I:17943;7020;I think chris nolan has become one of my favorite directors and I will be anxous to see what he does next.
I:17943;7021;Christopher Nolan's epic tour de force of action, drama, and the inner workings of the human psyche.
I:17943;7022;"Oh, and it's a sequel to Nolan's other Batman flick, ""Batman Begins"" too."
I:17943;7023;There's a new guy in town and he goes by the name the Joker.
I:17943;7024;The Joker's mission is simple (yet complex): to challenge the limits of Batman.
I:17943;7025;It is here that we have the best film of 2008 and one of the best films in recent years.
I:17943;7026;We finally have a Batman film that gives what we want and more: a great story, action, drama, romance, and the performances of a a life time (cough.
I:17943;7027;tHE FILM:Pros:*Great story*Emotionally filled and action packed*Memorable performances from Christian Bale and Heath Ledger*An amazing score from Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard (should have won the Oscar!!!)
I:17943;7028;Here, you'll find the amazing movie on Disc 1 and the Special Features with Digital Copy on Disc 2.
I:17943;7029;One video is about the creation of the Joker's theme and the other is about the creation and design of the Batpod and the new Batsuit.
I:17943;7030;The Blu Ray edition features all of those and more.
I:17943;7031;"The ""Creation of a Scene"" feature is actually about 11 videos on Blu Ray and offer inside looks into the creation of many of the stunts, explosions and such."
I:17943;7032;Oh, and the IMAX scenes are integrated into the film itself so you'll notice those scenes fill your screen and look amazing!!
I:17943;7033;But definitely but it on Blu Ray if you have a player.
I:17943;7034;It belongs in your library!!
I:17943;7035;This installment of batman was one of the best and I have seen them all!
I:17943;7036;Christian Bale's The Dark Knight is a long way from the actor's Performance in Empire of the Sun and still fantastic performances come shining through.
I:17943;7037;heath Ledger's star is still shining brightly in this last performance of his .
I:17943;7038;a true high point legacy.
I:17943;7039;This film has it all!
I:17943;7040;The cast is phenomenal, the plot is killer and the action is out of control!
I:17943;7041;Batman Begins was a great start in revamping the series, and The Dark Knight just took it to a whole new level.
I:17943;7042;In my opinion, should be up for best picture of 2008.
I:17943;7043;I was exciting about getting this package .
I:17943;7044;I liked the first one and thought the Joker was way too Psychotic and Batman was always 3 steps behind him and got his ASS Kicked!LOSER!
I:17943;7045;Bale is perfect as Batman.
I:17943;7046;Heath Ledger is pure genius, and I use genius only because I can't think of an even better superlative, as the Joker.
I:17943;7047;Gary Oldman does his usual perfect job.
I:17943;7048;Maggie Gyllenhaal is a treasure.
I:17943;7049;With just the right mixture of suspense and humor, this one is a winner.
I:17943;7050;Christian Bale is a tremendous actor and he will go down in history as one of the greatest actors to have played the role.
I:17943;7051;I never thought I'd see Batman like this.
I:17943;7052;Heath Ledger created one of the most enduring movie villains with his take on the classic Batman villain 'The Joker' in 'The Dark Knight.'
I:17943;7053;"Ledger also makes Christian Bale give one of the best performances in his career, because Bale had to match Ledger's scary charismatic Joker whenever Ledger was on the screen or not
I:17943;7054;wise and psychologically'needed shortening, more humor of the die hard series type.
I:17943;7055;Loved the DTS audio track.
I:17943;7056;Movie was pretty good too, especially the first 5 minutes.
I:17943;7057;keeps you on the edge of your seat and the fight scenes are so epic
I:17943;7058;Loved the action and techno goodies.
I:17943;7059;This is the best movie I've ever seen.
I:17943;7060;I saw this in IMAX theater!
I:17943;7061;Awesome cast and production value.
I:17943;7062;It's the best of the 3 movie series
I:17943;7063;Heath Ledger was terrific as the joker!
I:17943;7064;"Anyone who has studied acting knows that you don't play the ""crazy role"" at full blast the entire time."
I:17943;7065;Great piece to my movie collection !
I:17943;7066;In terms of features, it's pretty evident that WB rewarded the Blu.
I:17943;7067;I bought the limited edition because of the nice reproduction of this cool motorcycle that Batman is using in the movie.
I:17943;7068;The little extra is worth it if you are into Batman and comics related collectibles.
I:17943;7069;Anyway, the movie is amazing and a must have in blu.
I:17943;7070;This is one of the best Batman movies ever.
I:17943;7071;The rest of the time he stands around befuddled, delivering dialog that makes you want to run your cat's claws across a black board.
I:17943;7072;Say what you will about the Mission Impossible series, but their actions scenes always carried an element of excitement and surprise.
I:17943;7073;Were you on the edge of you seat as the explosive clock ticked down?
I:17943;7074;Just so you can say you saw it.
I:17943;7075;The ruination of the Batman mythos continues.
I:17943;7076;And there were so many good Batman stories left to tell.
I:17943;7077;Batman has been a favorite of mine for years.
I:17943;7078;The best is yet to come I'm sure, see both Dark Knight and Dark Knight Rises.
I:17943;7079;even if you have seen it i believe its worth the second look on Blu.
I:17943;7080;Gives good pretense to the dark night rises.
I:17943;7081;This movie blew the top off of comic adaptations.
I:17943;7082;The action is up there with the best, as are the effects.
I:17943;7083;All of the lead actors make their roles utterly convincing, and that take a lot when so many people push the edge all at once.
I:17943;7084;I've known smart people, and lost people, and some who were both.
I:17943;7085;Back in the day, good guys won, bad guys lost, and we all went home knowing who was who.
I:17943;7086;That day is gone, and good riddance.
I:17943;7087;This movie has it all, story, acting, cinematography, special effects, etc.
I:17943;7088;book flick to be a member of the Best Movie nominee club let alone the winners.
I:17943;7089;the story is both scary and inspiring.
I:17943;7090;I thoroughly enjoyed this on my 7.1 system.
I:17943;7091;The visuals were stunning and sound was superb!
I:17943;7092;I discovered for the first time some neighbors I shared walls with.
I:17943;7093;I forsee years of viewing ahead!
I:17943;7094;This movie is the best batman movie made period.
I:17943;7095;Christopher Nolan's rendition of the DC comic character has.
I:17943;7096;THE DARK KNIGHT may well be the best comic book film I have ever seen.
I:17943;7097;Christopher Nolan, along with Jonathan Nolan has crafted a screenplay of nearly unbelievable proportions.
I:17943;7098;"The duo has taken the ""Batman"" mythos and has turned it into their own
I:17943;7099;i'll get right to the point, you don't need to read any reviews, (including this one) just watch this film.
I:17943;7100;"It stomps Burton's rendition of the caped crusader to the ground and MAY well eat ""Batman Begins"" for breakfast, lunch and dinner
I:17943;7101;"The mysterious ""Batman"" has the crime element by its ear."
I:17943;7102;"christopher Nolan has impressed me before, with his films
I:17943;7103;"The director has abandoned the idea that ""Batman"" has to have a comic book feel."
I:17943;7104;The film goes for the comic book's soul.
I:17943;7105;Nolan is armed with a near flawless script that exudes the spirit of Gotham City as well as its Dark Angel.
I:17943;7106;The movie is unstoppable, the direction it went is awe.
I:17943;7107;inspiring that it nearly gave me goose bumps.
I:17943;7108;The Dark Knight has a lot of characters and the film develops each one.
I:17943;7109;Heath Ledger gives the performance of his career (Rest in Peace, Heath) and trumps Nicholson's portrayal.
I:17943;7110;The Joker will remain an enigma in this film, and I think it's a very smart move to do so.
I:17943;7111;Christian Bale is still a great Bruce Wayne and as his cowled alter.
I:17943;7112;Aaron Eckhart is an intriguing Harvey Dent, the district attorney is charismatic, heroic and the embodiment of Gotham's hope, until he.
I:17943;7113;the film's success is that the plot has attained a life of its own.
I:17943;7114;The characters can breathe and everything has a purpose.
I:17943;7115;Yes, the film has its bit of morality in it and explores the decency of everyday folk.
I:17943;7116;"Before, in ""Batman Begins"" James Gordon and Bruce's lost love Rachel (played this time by Maggie Gyllenhaal) embodied this idea, but the concept is more widely expressed this time around."
I:17943;7117;The Joker's target is the soul of Gotham and never more has the stakes been this high.
I:17943;7118;The action sequences itself are exciting, the movie does have some very cool car chases which are intense and adrenaline.
I:17943;7119;"pumping
I:17943;7120;The visuals are great, the CGI doesn't look they're CGI at all.
I:17943;7121;there are cleverly placed bits of humor that help the film's pace.
I:17943;7122;The sarcastic exchanges between him and Wayne give a lot of depth to their relationship.
I:17943;7123;Fox also serves a significant role as a man who serves as Bruce's conscience almost as much as Alfred.
I:17943;7124;"Even ""The Joker"" adds some twisted bits of black humor."
I:17943;7125;The bits of humor help the film balance its darkness towards its gripping build.
I:17943;7126;bATMAN is a dark character and he is arguably the most interesting character in DC's line of comic books.
I:17943;7127;The man is an enigma and very mysterious.
I:17943;7128;This man is an urban legend and Nolan and company has successfully represented all these factors.
I:17943;7129;The promise of things to come and its climax has such an impact the way everything was structured through its storytelling.
I:17943;7130;The Dark Knight is epic, deliciously exciting, unforgettable, groundbreaking, scary and manages to put the audience in the middle of the struggle between Gotham's Dark Knight and his arch.
I:17943;7131;The film is very sincere and precise in its execution.
I:17943;7132;The Dark Knight is EASILY the best movie of the year and is the best superhero movie ever done (without a serious 2nd choice even worthy of consideration).
I:17943;7133;Heath Ledger's maniacal performance as the Joker is chilling.
I:17943;7134;the closest film I can compare The Dark Knight to is A Clockwork Orange, except with a more structured plot.
I:17943;7135;There is a feel of anarchy for the sake of anarchy in the tactics of the Joker, so it reminds one of that earlier classic, but the difference is that while the Joker is clearly insane and full of love for chaos, he's also the smartest character in the film, and nothing happens from beginning to end that deviates from his carefully planned script.
I:17943;7136;That's the profound irony of the Joker.
I:17943;7137;DON'T let kids under 13 see this movie unless they are VERY emotionally mature.
I:17943;7138;This is the kind of mature, psychological horror that makes it to film once in a generation, and it will leave scars on the psyche of the impressionable (as allegedly, it may have done to the late Heath Ledger himself).
I:17943;7139;Having worked in psychiatry for 37 yrs., I found Heath Ledger's character, The Joker, to be incredibly perfect and sublime in his portrayal of an uber.
I:17943;7140;All the actors, of course, are wonderful, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman, also pulling off parts of tremendous impact to the audience.
I:17943;7141;I have loved this movie since I saw it at a midnight premiere and Blu.
I:17943;7142;ray makes it so much better.
I:17943;7143;ray and for 9 dollars it is a steal!
I:17943;7144;there is absolutely nothing cool about them.
I:17943;7145;This will be a legendary film.
I:17943;7146;Such a complex story keeps me entertained without fail every time I watch it.
I:17943;7147;The reason this is such a good movie, is that Christopher Nolan did not try to make a super hero movie.
I:17943;7148;He created a complex stunning crime action movie with deep, yet classic characters that make it one of, if my most, favorite movie of all time.
I:17943;7149;Couple that with an incredible Blu.
I:17943;7150;ray transfer that delivers stunning sound and picture, and this movie is definitely worth $10.
I:17943;7151;the image is full of life, image is crisp and clean, dark when its meant to, and the IMAX scenes are as impresive as they were on the theater.
I:17943;7152;In this second film in the Dark Knight Trilogy, by director David Goyer.
I:17943;7153;This movie has great action and visuals ,and not to mention Batman gets a new tool to fight crime.
I:17943;7154;I love this movie, and I have seen it many times.
I:17943;7155;He loves batman especially the joker by Heath Ledger!
I:17943;7156;the best in the business.
I:17943;7157;ray version look far superior.
I:17943;7158;The Dark Knight may not be the best film of 08 but it's one of the top 7 and surely deserving of an Oscar bid.
I:17943;7159;The performance by the late Heath Ledger is timeless and the casting of Aaron Eckhart as two face is also one of the finest performances this year.
I:17943;7160;If you have blu ray and a home theatre this is a must own.
I:17943;7161;Great movie at a low Amazon price!
I:17943;7162;This is the best of the Batman series.
I:17943;7163;This is just amazing: The acting, the cinematography, the music and the story.
I:17943;7164;The most thrilling experience in the movies!The contention Bail and Heath Ledger is breath taking.
I:17943;7165;Aaron Eckhart is a big surprise!
I:17943;7166;"the central theme of this film, then, has the marvelously insane Joker (played brilliantly by the late Heath Ledger) pitted against our ""heroic"" Batman."
I:17943;7167;Any scene featuring Ledger's Joker is brilliant, while Christian Bale takes his Wayne/Batman character up a notch in intensity from the first film.
I:17943;7168;The penultimate confrontation between the two will have you on the edge of your seat.
I:17943;7169;The action scenes are also a notch better than Nolan's first effort, as they are filmed with IMAX cameras that lend themselves to incredible, sprawling action.
I:17943;7170;finally, the ensemble cast featuring Aaron Eckhart, Michael Caine, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Gary Oldman, and Morgan Freeman are spot.
I:17943;7171;if you are at all a fan of superhero movies, I can nearly guarantee that this film will top your list after viewing.
I:17943;7172;Even if you typically don't care for this genre, the acting is so tremendous, the action is so riveting, and the drama is so thought.
I:17943;7173;provoking that you will feel like you just watched an Oscar.
I:17943;7174;Although the performance of Heath Ledger may be in the top 10 performances of all time, the part of this amazing movie that moved me the most was the score.
I:17943;7175;It was quietly beyond perfect if that is even possible.
I:17943;7176;Watch this movie and watch it again!
I:17943;7177;I hope this is all right to place here in the review section.
I:17943;7178;Many others have already discussed the film, and like most of them, I really enjoy this picture.
I:17943;7179;Ledger's performance as the Joker is completely absorbing.
I:17943;7180;And I think my player's downmixing of 5.1 also affects the musical score.
I:17943;7181;Hands down, one of the best movies of our generation.
I:17943;7182;This is my favorite movie of all time.
I:17943;7183;He is funny and I love all of his lines.
I:17943;7184;I definately recommend it to anyone.
I:17943;7185;"Audience and critics everywhere praise Dark Knight for its multilayer plotline as if it were Richard Wagner's ""Ring"" cycle."
I:17943;7186;I bet that Christopher Nolan has this secret agenda to destroy the grand summer popcorn action film tradition.
I:17943;7187;What a great movie with a perfect ballance of action and story that does not seem overbearing in any asspect.
I:17943;7188;ray, so it became a Christmas gift that has been great enjoyed by someone with Blu.
I:17943;7189;this movie kind of sucks.
I:17943;7190;A far better picture than this one.
I:17943;7191;If he had not died The Dark Knight may very well have slid into sequel oblivion.
I:17943;7192;Michael Caine is always great.
I:17943;7193;I await the next installment and pray that the spirit a Rachel does not return to nauseate me.
