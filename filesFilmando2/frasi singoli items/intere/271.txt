I:1639;5;The supporting cast of Emma Thompson, Dustin Hoffman, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Queen Latifah add a clever dose of richness to an already engaging performance by Ferrell.
I:1639;6;this is a fun film that beautifully explores the human psyche and the beauty of literature.
I:1639;7;Not only is this film entertaining, but it is also extremely thought provoking.
I:1639;8;Harold Crick struggles with a universal question: what will we do with the life we each have been given?
I:1639;9;In the end, the answers Harold Crick discovers and the choices he makes will warm your heart and open your eyes.

I:1639;11;with a thoughtful, clever script, (and excellent cameo roles by Linda Hunt and Tom Hulce), who could ask for anything more?
I:1639;12;Harold lives his life with precision.
I:1639;13;He is as charming as Zerox machine, and she is as friendly as a banchee, but they manage to fall in love.
I:1639;14;Changes do come about in Harold and his life, but the journey, like life itself, is worth the focus and execution presented in the film.
I:1639;15;Much more believable than the likable `Lake House,' and borrowing nothing more than an innovative consciousness presented in movies like `Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,' `Stranger Than Fiction' lives up to the story title and gives us pause to reflect on the alternatives in life and how they can envelop us.
I:1639;16;Marc Forster ably directs this film with startling realism accompanied by excellent editing, and Queen Latifah and Will Ferrell are comics who skillfully play it straight with a fine supporting cast.
I:1639;17;the laughs are few and far between.
I:1639;18;He counts toothbrush strokes, steps, and in a way which is mathematically elegant, ensures that he uses exactly the right amount of steps to get to the bus, and saves time by tying only one Windsor knot.
I:1639;19;His watch, who also has a role to play in this story, keeps track of everything.
I:1639;20;After all, the whole story is a fiction and both Karen and Harold are characters within it, playing their parts as they spiral around each other.
I:1639;21;So does art itself have a greater claim to reality than these individual plotlines?What makes this quirky film so successful is that, unlike many post.
I:1639;22;modern films, Stranger Than Fiction is a humanistic film full of warmth.
I:1639;23;up less Thomson plays the role of Effiel with beautiful expression and intensity.
I:1639;24;Similarly Dustin Hoffman, Queen Latifah, and Maggie Gyllenhaal are all exceptional, funny, loveable, and strange enough to be completely realistic.
I:1639;25;Every character has depth, passion, silliness, and beauty.
I:1639;26;while the premise of the story is odd and eccentric, and perhaps might raise untenable questions about the nature of truth and narration, the story is so charming, and so well acted, it creates more truths than complications.
I:1639;27;There are many funny moments.

I:1639;29;"quote) to Harold's box of ""flours"" that he brings to Ana, his love interest (Gyllenhaal)."
I:1639;30;aside from the grand scheme of this film, which is definitely feel good, humanistic and positive, there are many tiny features which add to the cleverness and satisfaction.
I:1639;31;The parallel between Crick's ordered life, and its representation by the Golden Ratio image, and the ordered architecture of the city is handled with subtlety and power (both seem quite beautiful even as they are being treated with some irony).
I:1639;32;This is a wonderful, funny, pithy, and enjoyable film which, despite the lightness of the plot, the romance, and the `life conquers art' theme, is surprisingly deep, leaving the viewer pondering the questions it raises about life and death long after the film finishes.
I:1639;33;It's a particularly enjoyable film for anyone who reads a lot.
I:1639;34;Stranger than Fiction is a wonderful film, as easy on the eye and brain as any Hollywood blockbuster, but like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind manages to leave the viewer with more than they arrived with.
I:1639;35;It's funny, charming, sweet, but never dips into clich .
I:1639;36;The acting is sensational, the script is full of linguistic power, and the film is fast paced and deep.
I:1639;37;This is my favorite movie of all time, so I'm biased.
I:1639;38;Will Ferrell does a wonderful job here by not being Will Ferrell .
I:1639;39;he plays the role straight, which is immensely more funny and touching.
I:1639;40;I am excited to receive this movie because it is my favorite Will Ferrell movie and it is great to watch.
I:1639;41;This is a quirky, fun movie.
I:1639;42;Great for us book nerd/writer types.
I:1639;43;And fun for others too.
I:1639;44;"I am not now nor have I ever been a Will Ferrell fan
I:1639;45;It was a cute story that in the end made you think about the precariousness of your own existence.
I:1639;46;It evokes the kind of cleverness you'd get from a Charlie Kaufman flick (Adaptation, Being John Malkovich, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind).
I:1639;47;This is the source of most of comedy in the movie, with Ferrell's unabashed style fitting in perfectly in situations where he's making a fool of himself in public confronting his narrator.
I:1639;48;thematic confusion aside, the movie does bring out a decent performance out of Ferrell, who shows he can do more than just being loud and unabashed, as his resume might suggest.
I:1639;49;But the real gem is the stellar performance out of Emma Thompson, who wonderfully portrays the role of neurotic literist.
I:1639;50;With her, she brings the refreshingly subtle, dialogue.
I:1639;51;style humor that works fantastically opposite Ferrell's situational comedic style.
I:1639;52;Stranger than Fiction is a poignant piece on shared responsibility and accountability, and the tragicomic circumstances of our lives.
I:1639;53;But like a novel that falls short in a few places, but is amazing overall, this movie manages to pick up pace and remind you of its good parts, before you get dragged down by its negatives.
I:1639;54;the ending is satisfyingly American, but in a unique way .
I:1639;55;it doesn't just make the movie more pleasant, it makes sense.
I:1639;56;Story line 1: A man hears his own actions narrated, generally after the fact.
I:1639;57;on the surface, this works as a nicely spun little fantasy.
I:1639;58;There are deeper elements though, if one chooses to look for them.
I:1639;59;Can the author of a piece of literature be influenced by his/her creation?On the one level, this movie is charming and very enjoyable.
I:1639;60;The other levels can give us pause to think.
I:1639;61;Executed in a witty and subtly comedic manner.
I:1639;62;Very entertaining and well worth watching.
I:1639;63;Harold, played with great restraint by Will Ferrell, is one of those obsessive.

I:1639;65;narrating his life as it happens.
I:1639;66;The acting in this movie is uniformly good with Dustin Hoffman, Queen Latifah and Maggie Gyllenhaal all contributing.
I:1639;67;"Ferrell is better here than I've ever seen him
I:1639;68;The premise is interesting and the movie asks some important questions: what is more important, life or literature?
I:1639;69;well worth an evening in front of the boob tube.
I:1639;70;Surprisingly good, funny movie from Will Farrell.
I:1639;71;key and it works well.
I:1639;72;Also stars Maggie Gyllenhaal, who is just so sexy in everything she does.
I:1639;73;Does an amazing job at stunning us with a performance that is unlike any other.
I:1639;74;Stranger Than Fiction is smart without being sarcastic, thoughtful without being dull, uplifting without being saccharine.
I:1639;75;but it's better than both, especially the latter.
I:1639;76;Indeed, there is a calm, sweet reserve to this movie, all the performances are understated and nobody is winking at the camera.
I:1639;77;"this film makes me want to see Will Ferrell in more dramatic parts
I:1639;78;a. movie love story between Ferrell and Gyllenhaal is a real standout .
I:1639;79;such genuine romanticism, sensitively handled, is rare in film today.
I:1639;80;A pleasure seeing Linda Hunt again, however briefly.
I:1639;81;marc Foster directs this film with extraordinary confidence, allowing it to develop at a leisurely pace.
I:1639;82;the other, a flight into fantasy.
I:1639;83;the book is a masterpiece.
I:1639;84;And in the end, even when the film violates its own rules, (the rules we have begrudgingly been persuaded to accept), you will forgive it.
I:1639;85;I have to admit, even old guys stuck in the past can enjoy this modern tale.
I:1639;86;And the callous storyteller grew a heart.
I:1639;87;found an ending I could live with.
I:1639;88;the special effects provided an interesting sheen.
I:1639;89;A fresh storyline complimented the modern feel.
I:1639;90;radiated sincerity and a funky integrity.
I:1639;91;perfect voice for this film as she poured herself entirely into her character.
I:1639;92;who knew he of all people could underplay a character and breathe so much life and quiet humor into him?This movie will become a classic.
I:1639;93;Declare the pennies on your eyes, (Taxman!)
I:1639;94;Crick begins hearing a female voice in his head narrating his life, and starts to take it really seriously when she starts talking about impending doom.3.
I:1639;95;You may be half rightWill Ferrell is really good in this role as an ill.
I:1639;96;fated character, and gets good support from Maggie Gyllenhaal as a sassy baker, Dustin Hoffman as a literature professor and Emma Thompson as a famous writer.
I:1639;97;"My family enjoyed watching ""Strange Than Fiction""."
I:1639;98;It presents a unique approach to life which makes it interesting.
I:1639;99;It has comedy, drama, insanity and love!
I:1639;100;You won't end up in tears but parts do touch your heart, even while you chuckle.
I:1639;101;Loved it all and I am not a Will Ferrell fan usually.
I:1639;102;The twist at the end with the final thought of one can live with ordinary was classic
I:1639;103;So begins what may well be a career altering move for the notorious Will Ferrell.
I:1639;104;At least we all can hope.
I:1639;105;progress that will forever change his life.
I:1639;106;"Of course these comedic turns can be fun but in all honesty the true word, as a friend so aptly put it, is ""gratuitous"" and for the most part just unnecessary."
I:1639;107;face style of previous roles.
I:1639;108;the supporting cast is also well worth the price of admission.
I:1639;109;Thompson once again devotes herself whole.
I:1639;110;heartedly to the role, very believably outfitted as the plagued creative genius.
I:1639;111;It is fun but smart, laugh.
I:1639;112;Essentially, the tight script and flawless casting are what make the film.
I:1639;113;The characters deliver their one.
I:1639;114;liners and soliloquies with finesse.
I:1639;115;Timing, both on the side of the writers and the actors, really draws the viewer in and keeps them there for the duration.
I:1639;116;It is interesting that at one point the discussion of literature that Harold hopes will reveal the truth behind his situation turns to whether he is the hero of a comedy or a tragedy, because that categorization can be applied to more than just the written word, and this film catches that, both hilariously and movingly.
I:1639;117;ferrell plays Harold with great balance.
I:1639;118;He enjoys structure in life, but is taken by Ana's carefree attitude.
I:1639;119;ferrell, Gylenhaal, and Thompson emerge as the real gems in this movie.
I:1639;120;"Despite that, ""Stranger Than Fiction"" proves that the comically."
I:1639;121;inclined Ferrell can handle a more meaty role.
I:1639;122;It's not the Great American Movie, but it is a nice change.
I:1639;123;"Although I love Will Ferrell in movies like ""Anchorman"" and ""Old School"", I was impressed by his acting ability in ""Stranger Than Fiction""."
I:1639;124;This is truly his best work!
I:1639;125;It's clever, funny, and makes you feel.
I:1639;126;I watch it when I'm down, when I'm up and I also love that it's on the on.
I:1639;127;That is until one day when he hears the voice of a woman that seems to narrate his life and thoughts with perfect accuracy.
I:1639;128;The film manages to find a good cross between comedy and drama for a very satisfying experience.
I:1639;129;While at first the premise of real person being a character in a novel might seem silly, it really works in the film.
I:1639;130;in conclusion, this is very enjoyable film with a premise that ultimately works well and good performances by its cast.
I:1639;131;out Will Ferrell comedy, but it is a relatively creative story with a little bit of heart underneath it.
I:1639;132;Emma Thompson is great in this, and Ferrell pulls off a better normal guy than Jim Carrey has been able to do.
I:1639;133;this item itself is a decent blu.
I:1639;134;ray with some nice extra features, if you're into that kind of thing.
I:1639;135;Shipped quickly and a fantastic movie.
I:1639;136;He makes an actual attempt to act in this one.
I:1639;137;It is rare that a film comes along which not only appeals to my fascination for the surreal but can also be watched by my mother.
I:1639;138;In this he plays a boring guy reacting to strange situations like pretty much everyone else would, and he does it brilliantly.
I:1639;139;my only criticism is that the humour is mostly reserved for a few laugh our loud moments and is absent for much of the rest.
I:1639;140;all in all, a great film
I:1639;141;Stranger Than Fiction is in a category all its own, though no less quirky than the aforementioned, and if you liked either or both of those, then you'll probably have a great time with this.
I:1639;142;"Maggie Gyllenhaal was terrific and well cast
I:1639;143;Truly hilarious, and 'quirky' doesn't even begin to do it justice.
I:1639;144;I was pleasantly surspised by this movie!
I:1639;145;Will Ferell did a wonderful job.
I:1639;146;I had heard about this movie from varous people and my friend happened to have it and I watched and now I'm in love with this movie.
I:1639;147;Maggie Gyllenhal does a great job in this as well.
I:1639;148;will farrell is impressive and it's nice to see a side of his abilities that does not scream slapstick.
I:1639;149;emma t could polish shoes and make it entertaining, so that goes w/o saying.
I:1639;150;It is funny, romantic, and sincere.
I:1639;151;The obvious lack of life and vivacity in Harold Crick's life is contrasted beautifully with the boldness and passion of Maggie Gyllenhall's character and creates an amazing example of opposites attracting and in symbiosis, growing together as they find what they never expected in each other.
I:1639;152;downer' but in truth is an inspiring piece that leaves you fulfilled.
I:1639;153;This is the question explored by this charming film with a powerful cast.
I:1639;154;"I found myself staring at the screen in ""Stranger Than Fiction"" and waiting for something imaginative to happen."
I:1639;155;I do watch quite a bit of movies, and chose to watch this one because I like Will Ferrell most of the time, and was willing to give him a chance in a more dramatic role, but he just can't pull it off.
I:1639;156;As you suspected, Will Ferrell can act better than he does in his comedic roles.
I:1639;157;Of course, Emma Thompson is perfect as the neurotic writer.
I:1639;158;All are exceptional in this comic tragic movie as an ensemble (with great support by Maggie Gylenhaal and Queen Latifah).
I:1639;159;The film starts slowly and picks up pace through with a great witty performances by Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson.
I:1639;160;If you own it, you'll play it at least once a year.
I:1639;161;It is the only role Will Ferrell has played that I liked his acting.
I:1639;162;Maggie Gyllenhaal was a trip!
I:1639;163;Narrating it, actually, in a female voice with an elegant British accent (Emma Thompson).
I:1639;164;the second thing that's going on is that Harold is falling in love.
I:1639;165;She admits she normally keeps very tidy records, but she did this to annoy him.
I:1639;166;But the author knows, and eventually Harold knows (the voice in his head) that they are falling in love.
I:1639;167;Absolutely one of the best movies I've ever seen, and I really don't like Will Ferrell much.
I:1639;168;I enjoy watching this movie, several times in the past year.
I:1639;169;I feel that Dustin Hoffman turns in a very admirable performance as well.
I:1639;170;be writers, you really should see this film.
I:1639;171;emma Thompson is one of the best in the business and she really shines as a morbid writer's block victim.
I:1639;172;the story is fun, not to be taken too seriously, and best of all the director knows it.
I:1639;173;Stranger Than Fiction is the most original and endearing movie that I have ever watched.
I:1639;174;there's one scene on a bus that displays what is likely the most genuine and sincere and charming apology ever.
I:1639;175;there's another scene that fans of this movie will agree is the best cookie scene ever in a motion picture.
I:1639;176;I'm all for originality, which was one of the only things this movie had going for it.
I:1639;177;It gets 3 stars instead of 2 because of its originality, but this was never laugh out loud funny, nor something that you could watch over and over.
I:1639;178;This fictitious character starts hearing voices and goes to a literary professor for help.
I:1639;179;He enlists the help of a literally literary professor (Dustin Hoffman) to help in the quest.
I:1639;180;It is a gem well worth seeing.
I:1639;181;top comedic, here he plays it straight.
I:1639;182;"That's not to say that ""Stranger Than Fiction"" doesn't include humor, but it's more warm smiles and tender moments than guffaws."
I:1639;183;Farrell's efforts are outstanding as are those of his supporting cast, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Emma Thompson, and Dustin Hoffman with Queen Latifah adding a small but perfectly pitched supporting note.
I:1639;184;Harold is moved to reexamine his life and the results are magic.
I:1639;185;"director Marc Forster (""Finding Neverland"", ""Monster's Ball"") excels once again
I:1639;186;With the focus firmly on character development, director Marc Forster pushes actor Will Ferrell to a solid performance that is clearly outside his comfort zone of slapstick comedy.
I:1639;187;a morality play on life, art and romance, it is an interesting look into living each day to its fullest and ultimately striving to do the right thing in every situation, even if some would believe it is just life imitating art.
I:1639;188;Engrossing, rich, complicated and full of life.
I:1639;189;This is the kind of movie that gets better as you watch it.
I:1639;190;An excellent film whose of a dying breed.
I:1639;191;This is an odd little gem whose acting only enhances the delicious script.
I:1639;192;Stylish, loving and beautiful this is a joy to watch.
I:1639;193;A beautiful and extraordinary film.
I:1639;194;Delightful and thoughtful piece of fiction.
I:1639;195;Will Ferrell at his best and Maggie Gyllenhall at her most quirky.
I:1639;196;The preview shows all the funny parts, and when seeing Will Ferrell, you expect more of the same in this movie.
I:1639;197;Many will watch this movie thinking it is a comedy, and who is to blame them.
I:1639;198;Will Ferrell, Dustin Hoffman, Emma Thompson and Dustin Hoffman all have been stars in comedies, and Will Ferrell is one of the funniest actors around.
I:1639;199;Harold can hear a voice in his head.
I:1639;200;There are one or two striking visual moments (watch out for the bulldozer) and Ferrell's character is given a couple of funny lines, but on the whole this film is a major disappointment.
I:1639;201;"After a very enjoyable first thirty minutes or so, I had a voice in MY head saying ""They'll never maintain this for an entire film""."
I:1639;202;She did well, but her appearance just disappeared into the background as part of the environment in which Emma Thompson's character, novelist Karen Eiffel moved.
I:1639;203;seem to be modest at best.
I:1639;204;one strong argument that the value of the film rests primarily with the writing is in the character actor performance of Dustin Hoffman.
I:1639;205;While Hoffman executed his business flawlessly, it was very good business and dialogue indeed.
I:1639;206;Much better, for example than what he had to work with in some other recent comedies such as `Meet the Fokkers'.
I:1639;207;The whole setup for this ending problem shows the very best in dramatic creativity.
I:1639;208;The real irony is that it fits in perfectly with the question posed by Hoffman to Ferrell to determine whether the novel in which he is a part is a comedy or a tragedy.
I:1639;209;as great as this movie is, it has one sour piece of business that sticks out like a sore thumb, where a demolition crew begins tearing down Ferrell's apartment building.
I:1639;210;I won't say why it is a weak piece of business, but I think you will find it so as well.
I:1639;211;i am not sure I would rate this movie as high as `Ghostbusters' or `Animal House' or `Blazing Saddles', three comedies I enjoy rewatching on a regular basis, but it certainly is worthwhile to own, even if, unlike these others and those from my favorite Woody Allen flicks, it is light on subtitles discovered only on a second or third watching.
I:1639;212;Will Ferrell fans now have a very good reason to stand up and cheer.
I:1639;213;Amazingly, Ferrell gives a thoughtful and insightful portrayal of a conflicted man who believes he's being followed by a narrating woman's voice.
I:1639;214;the ending is bittersweet for both Harold and Emma.
I:1639;215;Can she change her masterpiece of fiction?
I:1639;216;man performance was something of a marvel.
I:1639;217;His witty line deliveries and his tender relationship with Ana Pascal (Gyllenhaal) goes way beyond anything we've seen from him before.
I:1639;218;Again, much of this can be attributed to the brilliant script by Zach Helm.
I:1639;219;He's in almost every shot, proving that he can be a great leading man if given the right set of circumstances.
I:1639;220;In an era where Will Ferrell can only be a punchline character in any decent film, he really surprised me in this underrated gem.
I:1639;221;Though his comedic background plays no role in this movie, I found myself entertained at a comedic level through his mannerisms.
I:1639;222;Well written script, good plot, and excellent acting all around make this a can't.
I:1639;223;This is my favorite movie with Will Ferrell in it (not his usual comedy).
I:1639;224;Am so glad Amazon offered it, and at such a good price.
I:1639;225;As usual, prompt shipping and the movie is in excellent condition
I:1639;226;The corporate bigwigs are sticking it to the working class once more!
I:1639;227;Hopefully, some lawyer can fix this.
I:1639;228;What the world needs now, is love sweet love.
I:1639;229;Its a beautiful thing when people take care of each other.
I:1639;230;Here are some of the other delightful messages:You can learn alot about how to enjoy life from rock lyrics.You can change the world with good cookies.
I:1639;231;great writing is always a treat.
I:1639;232;the real power of this movie is Maggie Gyllenhaal (spelling?)
I:1639;233;"She is intense
I:1639;234;but there was plenty of good acting and writing .
I:1639;235;I enjoyed the graphics on the screen, and the oddball music.
I:1639;236;was a perfect reinforcement of the story.
I:1639;237;I'll look into other work by this director and this writer.
I:1639;238;I find the premise delightfully original: a mathematically.
I:1639;239;Just waiting then finding out the source of the voice in his head is enough to make this more interesting than most movies.
I:1639;240;There are light touches of humor that blend in a charming way with the bittersweet drama of the story.
I:1639;241;"please and I my experience with ""Stranger Than Fiction"" was absolutely enchanting."
I:1639;242;A man wakes up one day and discovers that he is just a text.
I:1639;243;"to prove how serious this film is, the director and screenwriter (two young kids fresh out of college it would seem from the featurettes) cast some ""serious"" actors: Dustin Hoffman!"
I:1639;244;She was quite appealing, but had only a minor role.
I:1639;245;One of Emma Thompson's best roles,and Maggie Gyllanhal is divine as Will's love interest.
I:1639;246;star cast, it started garnering the most praise for the bright and refreshing screenwriting brought on board by newcomer Zach Helm.
I:1639;247;Drawing comparisons to the brilliant mind behind Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Charlie Kaufman, Zach Helm's script contains a similar philosophical bent and uncertain outlook on life that made Kaufman's works so incredibly popular.
I:1639;248;Director Marc Forster does an excellent job bringing the many quirks of Zach Helm's story to life and makes the best of his stellar cast.
I:1639;249;Maggie Gyllenhaal's excellent turn as Ana Pascal, the radical baker who becomes the object of Crick's affections, should definitely land her more leading roles and make her a star.
I:1639;250;While the movie doesn't break any new ground per se, it provides a cinematic experience that is simultaneously contemplative and fun, able to tug at the audience's emotions to great effect without being heavy.
I:1639;251;perfect casting and touching story, provides a great launching platform for an imaginative, new screenwriting talent and effectively establishes Will Ferrell and Maggie Gyllenhaal as serious talents to watch.
I:1639;252;I thought the concept of the plot was original and something refreshing but the movie itself was a drag.
I:1639;253;Will Ferrell had a good performance here, enjoyed the twists that the story provided.
I:1639;254;Despite my looking for flashes of Ricky Bobby, I really thought Will delivered a performance that will earn him additional 'serious' roles.
I:1639;255;Stranger than Fiction was really good.
I:1639;256;The plot is way out there, but the intelligent script, seamless directing and strong acting make it work.
I:1639;257;This film promises to be a pleasant surprise to you.
I:1639;258;iRS Agent Harold Crick begins hearing a female voice in his head.
I:1639;259;Along his journey, Crick meets a quirky bakery owner named Ana Pascal.
I:1639;260;Ana becomes the love interest in the film.
I:1639;261;exceptional supporting performances help make this movie special.
I:1639;262;First is the gifted actress Emma Thompson as novelist Karen Eiffel.
I:1639;263;She found just the right level for this character: off balance enough to make the character interesting, yet not over the top.
I:1639;264;Ms. Thompson is nicely balanced by Queen Latifah as Penny Escher.
I:1639;265;Latifah just gets better and better.
I:1639;266;"His performance is understated
I:1639;267;maggie Gyllenhaal is Ana Pascal, a role she appears born to play.
I:1639;268;She was incredibly cute and fiery.
I:1639;269;Nonetheless, Gyllenhaal found the soul of the character, and gave an honest and engaging performance.
I:1639;270;It is through Ana that Harold finally finds happiness and release, starting with his first homemade cookies.
I:1639;271;will Ferrell is just brilliant in this film.
I:1639;272;This role may have funny moments, but it is a dramatic role.
I:1639;273;"This character has an arc with a capital ""A"", and Ferrell hits all the right notes."
I:1639;274;There are many wonderful scenes with Ferrell, but I have two favorites.
I:1639;275;I loved the long scene he had with Gyllenhaal where they fell in love.
I:1639;276;His nerves and sweetness were charming.
I:1639;277;this is a creative, intelligent film with comedy, drama, and a lot of heart.
I:1639;278;It features a stellar cast on top of their games.
I:1639;279;The movie itself was pretty good .
I:1639;280;so, there is a good chance that this movie will not be playable, and I don't recommend purchasing it.
I:1639;281;I have to say a very good plot, I am always a big fan of any movie that Emma Thompson stars in and I'm definetly a fan of Queen Latifah, she raises the bar when it comes to transition from rapper to actor.
I:1639;282;The writers story is a reflection of his life, and every word she writes, every scene she creates, happens in his life.
I:1639;283;Talk about the pen is mighter than the sword!
I:1639;284;I absolutely loved every aspect of this movie.
I:1639;285;The script was so clever I was savoring every dialogue.
I:1639;286;The casting was perfect down to the t. Nobody could have played Emma Thompson's character like she did.
I:1639;287;That is ingenious writing at its best, wouldn't you say?
I:1639;288;I think he possesses a unique vulnerability that makes him so likable and perfect for this particular role.
I:1639;289;It's the subtle kind where you just smile and go 'dang, that was a clever line!'
I:1639;290;I highly recommend it for those who enjoy a good play with words.
I:1639;291;I was worried about ordering a used movie but this was in very good condition, almost like new.
I:1639;292;The script was great and the overall filming was wonderful.
I:1639;293;"Most of us know Will Ferrell as a kooky, often hilarious comedic performer who excells at creating funny and memorable characters (such as Ron Burgandy in ""Anchorman"", or Ricky Bobby in ""Talladega Nights"")."
I:1639;294;However, the brilliant and heart.
I:1639;295;What Harold didn't expect in his mundane existance was to one day start hearing a woman's voice in his head begin to narrate his life.
I:1639;296;this film is engaging and imaginative.
I:1639;297;It is a far cry from Will Ferrell's usual role, but he manages to bring a vulnerability and a very real personality to his character.
I:1639;298;earth and completely believable vibe.
I:1639;299;emma Thompson, Dustin Hoffman, and Maggie Gyllenhaal each turn in equally unique and 'right.
I:1639;300;money' performances, and I would expect nothing less from any of them, but this film is still awe inspiring due to Ferell's turn as Harold Crick.
I:1639;301;it also completely works for this film.
I:1639;302;"I know that none of us watch a movie expecting to see anything that would happen in real life (that would be boring), but ""Stranger than Fiction"" takes an average man in need of a life change, and gives it to him in a uniquely thinking."
I:1639;303;the cinematography and set design in this film work beautifully together.
I:1639;304;It all flows and works together, and it's interesting to relate it all to the mood and growth of Ferrell's character.
I:1639;305;It's orignal and uniquely interesting.
I:1639;306;The acting was acting and the scripted stereotypes excellent.
I:1639;307;One of my favorite Ferrel movies.
I:1639;308;Well acted and a good plotline.
I:1639;309;Dustin Hoffman does a great job also.
I:1639;310;Harold finds challenge between learning to live and to love, while also seeking out an answer for who is responsible for the voice in his head, and ultimately, his imminent death.Your heart will truly be warmed in this unique take on theinterconnectedness between us all, so if you don't like Will Ferrell, then set your prejudices aside temporarily.
I:1639;311;this is not just a waylay from Will's usual typecast, it's undoubtedly his best acting role to date and he's supported by an unusual, but equally effective and enjoyable ensemble of costars.
I:1639;312;Any movie that can evoke both laughs and tears wins, in my estimation.
I:1639;313;the plot is delightfully original and refreshing.
I:1639;314;Will Ferrell, Dustin Hoffman, Emma Thompson, Queen Latifah, and Maggie Gyllenhaal all delivered wonderful performances.
I:1639;315;All in all, definitely worth seeing.
I:1639;316;All in the name of good writing and conflict!So you'll understand that the idea of ever meeting some of my characters, especially, say, in a dark alleyway, is something that fills me with some sense of trepidation.
I:1639;317;this is a movie about life and death, and the value of both to our world.
I:1639;318;It has a very nice style and feel to it, in addition to some great writing and acting on the part of everyone, including the star.
I:1639;319;It's a nice step back from some of the idiot characters he's played in most of his movies.
I:1639;320;despite the odd premise of a man who finds out he's a character in someone else's novel, the movie really works well, and comes across as a labor of love on the part of everyone involved.
I:1639;321;There's also a little of thought.
I:1639;322;provoking phillosophical stuff that happens in the film, giving you something to think about a little after you're done watching it.
I:1639;323;Harold Crick is a real.
I:1639;324;He's in love, after all.
I:1639;325;An interesting take on the novelist/character relationship.
I:1639;326;Very creative and satisfying staging, filming, and casting.
I:1639;327;this took guts, and surprisingly, it works most of the time.
I:1639;328;The director uses some interesting props and very well.
I:1639;329;designed sets to make this far.
I:1639;330;fetched concept seem marginally believable, very witty, and generally satisfying.
I:1639;331;It is an emotional film that I believe did not get the recognition it deserves as one of the best films of recent years because of preconceived notions about Will Ferrell.
I:1639;332;The story is engaging and interesting to begin and completely engrossing and truly climactic at the end.
I:1639;333;Emma Thompson and Will Ferrel are brilliant.
I:1639;334;I bought this movie on Blu.
I:1639;335;ray after watching the movie in theaters and watched it for the second time last night and I can safely say that this is a movie I will watch again and again.
I:1639;336;Emma Thompson's voice in his head is an excellent narrative, an indispensable thread that links the plot together.
I:1639;337;the fact that the director focused only around the boring life of Harold Click proved to be a refreshing perspective.
I:1639;338;Every main character leads a simple life.
I:1639;339;Maggie Gyllenhaal, the baker, simply makes cookies, cakes and gives away generously to the needy.
I:1639;340;Dustin Hoffman works from an office with a breathtaking view.
I:1639;341;And Queen Latifah looks a confident and caring professional who has promised to help Emma Thompson end her novel quietly and efficiently.
I:1639;342;(This means killing the character Harold Click the best way possible.)
I:1639;343;Looking back, I like the movie for its subtle tone, excellent cinematography of the city, portrayal of relationships just as it is without stereotyping.
I:1639;344;What I learn from this movie .
I:1639;345;one can empathize and be a good person without saying too much, one can be in the spotlight of the movie without being a hero credited with big deeds, good look and in an important situation.
I:1639;346;And a movie needs to be loud to make a lasting impression.
I:1639;347;stuff jokes, this film has more of an accessible tone but a heart as well.
I:1639;348;while Ferrell does a commendable job, strangely it's Emma Thompson who stole the show for me.
I:1639;349;"These are basically ""this was so great to work on, he's so talented"" interviews and you don't really get any insight into making it, it's just a bunch of people talking about how cool the movie is."
I:1639;350;Will Ferrell shines in this quirky and touching movie about a man who hears the voice of a writer who is narrating the story of his life.
I:1639;351;Things suddenly change for him after he starts hearing a voice that narrates his life.
I:1639;352;What makes the movie shine is the interplay between fiction and real life and watching the way Emma Thompson, who plays the hermit.
I:1639;353;All of the actors do a remarkable job at bringing this fresh script to life and I will be sure to watch this many times in the future.
I:1639;354;Great story, wonderful acting, Fun light hearted movie.
I:1639;355;Of all the actors to make this caracter come to life, Will Farrell was a perfect fit.
I:1639;356;This movie is funny and original.
I:1639;357;My only small flaw with this film is that it could have cut the last part of the ending and been just fine, but this is a fitting ending as well.
I:1639;358;It is a fantastic story with an outstanding cast.
I:1639;359;Will Ferrell is great as a IRS Agent who lives a very boring life until he starts hearing a voice.
I:1639;360;Not just a voice but a voice that is narrating his life.
I:1639;361;The wonderful voice of Emma Thompson.
I:1639;362;Emma Thomposon plays an accomplished writer who has writers block.
I:1639;363;He plays a wonderful character who is an ecentric Professor of Literature.
I:1639;364;The beautiful and talented Maggie Gyllenhaal is Harold's love interest who thinks he is just the most innocent wonderful person.
I:1639;365;The chemistry between the two is magnetic.
I:1639;366;A wonderful scene where he is playing the guitar singing the only song he knows as she is cleaning the kitchen.
I:1639;367;She is drawn to the song and ends up mouthing the words.
I:1639;368;Obviously a song that she knows and also moves her.
I:1639;369;a great story, great cast and a wonderful performances by the talented Will Ferrell and the entire cast.
I:1639;370;it's not an easy thing to do, telling a story within a story, but in the hands of talented director Marc Forster (Monster's Ball&Finding Neverland) the end result is both profound and entertaining.
I:1639;371;He discovers that his death is approaching and this knowledge brings new meaning into his neat and tidy life.
I:1639;372;But Stranger Than Fiction has a wonderful cast including Emma Thompson as Karen Eiffel, the narrator and writer who decides Harold's fate, Maggie Gyllenhaal as an anarchistic yet friendly baker, Dustin Hoffman as a literary expert who must help Harold decipher the purpose of his life and his story, and Queen Latifah who plays a no.
I:1639;373;top and heavy handed but just avoids to do so.
I:1639;374;It maintains a tricky balance of comedy and tragedy, of intellect and emotion.
I:1639;375;And this can be attributed to its amazing cast and its confident director.
I:1639;376;It's not a perfect film (I've never seen one and I don't think they exist) but it is extremely enjoyable.
I:1639;377;Most times, I find it interesting to watch a comedian pay a dramatic role.
I:1639;378;Suffice to say Ferrell, Emma Thompson, Maggie Gyllenhall and Dustin Hoffman are all good in this human.
I:1639;379;I liked this movie very much and especially enjoyed seeing Will Ferrell as something other than just another variety of buffoon.
I:1639;380;Sure, he is good in those roles and quite funny, but here he takes the clown off and brings us a new range of character with his portrayal Harold Crick.
I:1639;381;crick is an IRS auditor who lives a very precise and standardized life.
I:1639;382;He gets what should be a simple auditing assignment to a very small bakery and meets a very antagonistic Ana Pascal (played by the wonderful Maggie Gyllenhaal).
I:1639;383;after rejecting the recommendation of a psychiatrist to get medicated, he ends up seeking the help of a professor of literature, Jules Hilbert (in a fine performance by Dustin Hoffman).
I:1639;384;Many literary critics, Harold Bloom for one, keep talking about how our lives are rooted in literature, that we are creations of great writers in the past whose world views we have adopted and merely suppose them to be our own sense of the world.
I:1639;385;The storyline is really good, the acting superb, and the cast (some of my favorites) is fantastic.
I:1639;386;Definitely (in my opinion) worth watching and owning.
I:1639;387;My 9 year old could make his comedy funny, but Will just looks like an idiot.
I:1639;388;That said, I liked him here!
I:1639;389;When he's playing the role of a regular Joe, he's likeable!
I:1639;390;When he's being real, he's good.
I:1639;391;It is an inventive plot made convincing by sensitive direction and fine performances by its stars, Will Ferrell and Maggie Gyllenhaal.
I:1639;392;His solitary life becomes upset by the presence of a female voice that seems to be narrating his every move.
I:1639;393;It is with Dr. Hilbert that Harold finds hope and a methodology to solve the puzzle of the narrative voice.
I:1639;394;His life out of kilter, Harold begins to break out of his quiet shell and experience life's interesting aspects.
I:1639;395;She too has realized some incredible connection between her story and his real life.
I:1639;396;the dialogue is funny at times and always interesting.
I:1639;397;His character works because his persona changes throughout the film and when he faces his fears and desires head on, his life begins to move forward in ways he never imagined.
I:1639;398;He is starting to live life.
I:1639;399;And when he finds out his fate, he makes a big decision that brings his character full circle.
I:1639;400;the movie is at its best when Harold warms up to Ana, and the two begin a courtship that is affecting and genuine.
I:1639;401;Hoffman has his most significant role in years since his brief but memorable turn in Foster's previous Finding Neverland.
I:1639;402;And Gyllenhaal proves adept as a romantic lead.
I:1639;403;forster is becoming a modern day teller of fables.
I:1639;404;In Stranger Than Fiction he spins a simple tale (written by Zach Helm) of love, life, and fate with a moral that is redemptive and refreshing.
I:1639;405;"Not everyone will connect with this film
I:1639;406;This is an intriguing story, done very well.
I:1639;407;though with a slightly in satisfying ending (in my opinion).
I:1639;408;"The concept is fairly unique
I:1639;409;Ferrell's performance is uniquely somber, down.
I:1639;410;Despite being promoted or labeled as a comedy, I see this movie as more of a drama with comedic overtones.
I:1639;411;Queen Latifah does a very nice portrayal of the assistant hired by Eiffel's publisher, trying to help her finish the novel.
I:1639;412;Linda Hunt also adds a nice portrayal in a bit part as one of the psychologist Harold talks to.
I:1639;413;"There are many humorous scenes and moments
I:1639;414;The story is played out well and culminates well.
I:1639;415;Despite my opinion of the flawed ending, consider this is a unique and interesting story, and a fine addition to any movie collection.
I:1639;416;And what a comedy it is, smart, fresh and a true delight I was completely content upon walking out of the theater last Saturday night, knowing full well that my decision to skip `Happy Feet' and take a chance on this Will Ferrell comedy was justified.
I:1639;417;He lives for his work and his work alone.
I:1639;418;He lives alone, eats alone, sleeps alone.
I:1639;419;that is until a woman's voice takes up residence inside his head.
I:1639;420;Harold is now on edge, worried that his life is soon to end, and so he begins to seek help from anyone who will give it.
I:1639;421;He also begins to pursue a relationship with a beautiful young baker named Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal), a woman who initially despised him but has grown to love him for the man he is underneath.
I:1639;422;thanks in large part to the impressive cast, `Stranger than Fiction' delivers an original one of a kind comedy that is sure to please any fan of the genre.
I:1639;423;"Will Ferrell performs against type proving that he's more than just a big kid
I:1639;424;Emma Thompson and Queen Latifah were a perfect team, working off of each other brilliantly, and Emma does stand out here as the most memorable character.
I:1639;425;Maggie has just had a killer year this year, and while her Ana isn't as brilliant as her Sherry (from `Sherrybaby') or her Alison (from `World Trade Center') she still delivers a sweet, funny and believable love interest for Harold, and believe it or not Will Ferrell and Maggie Gyllenhaal have great chemistry.
I:1639;426;if you're looking for a smart and original comedy, one that will make you laugh and make you smile and, in the long run, really make you think then this is the movie for you.
I:1639;427;"It may present the same ""seize the day"", ""live for now"", ""take the risks your afraid to take"" type message that a lot of movies today are presenting, but `Stranger than Fiction' does so with a unique twist that is all it's own, and in that way it seems original even if the moral is not."
I:1639;428;His real life is her novel's plot.
I:1639;429;she sports tattoos and dropped out of Harvard Law School because she wanted to open a bakery.
I:1639;430;"This is a very clever comedy that also stars Dustin Hoffman as a literature professor who functions as Crick's ""therapist"" to figure out the narrative plot of his life and the likely choices that Eiffel might make, and Queen Latifah as the novelist's assistant."
I:1639;431;"This is a great comedy, love story, and poignant consideration of the ""story"" that every person must live."
I:1639;432;Stranger Than Fiction is a pretty good movei.
I:1639;433;I thought it was will ferell's most non rediculous and insane films.
I:1639;434;It actually had a good plot to it.
I:1639;435;and a good story a unique one.
I:1639;436;what she don't know is that her main Character Harold Crick(Ferell) is real.
I:1639;437;Worth a look if you like slightly offbeat movies, but not especially memorable or moving.
I:1639;438;In the wonderful romantic comedy Stranger Than Fiction, Chicago IRS auditor Harold Crick (Will Ferrell) has suddenly found himself the main character in a novel, which is perhaps an odd subject for a movie.
I:1639;439;But here the juxtaposition of picture and sound works perfectly, whereas in a novel, the double.
I:1639;440;But while Allen leaves his question hanging, Stranger Than Fiction ultimately works its way into a corner, and forces itself to come up with an answer.
I:1639;441;They have a wonderful chemistry of the type that graced hit films like When Harry Met Sally and Four Weddings and a Funeral.
I:1639;442;Food plays an important role as well, from Ana's warm, soft cookies to the cold, creepy dinners eaten by the IRS men.
I:1639;443;I really enjoyed this movie.
I:1639;444;The plot was very interesting and I think it was well casted.
I:1639;445;This proves that Will Ferrell is also a great serious actor.
I:1639;446;As a writer this one touched me.
I:1639;447;I love the concept that someone else can write the events of a man's life and the man lrarns to take back that control.
I:1639;448;Best thing Will Ferrell ever did.
I:1639;449;The surprisingly sweet, witty Stranger Than Fiction poses questions about fate and sacrifice while playfully touching on literary topics, but if this were all this film was, it might not warrant five stars.
I:1639;450;Will Ferrell as Harold Crick turns in a marvelous performance that combines his usual bewildered, semi.
I:1639;451;not a single actor is miscast in this metafictive exploration of writing, character, motivation, self.
I:1639;452;despite the serious issues this film addresses, it is ultimately a comedy.
I:1639;453;loud moments come one after another, and they serve to deepen our emotional involvement with the plot and characters.
I:1639;454;I expected so little of this film, and was rewarded with much more than I thought possible.
I:1639;455;I was hesitant to watch Will Farrell in this film, but was pleasantly surprised.
I:1639;456;"It speaks to those people who believe in fate, vs a predefined outcome to their lives, and the film overall is a great metaphor for not letting ""life pass you by"", in lieu of routine and monotony."
I:1639;457;all of the characters are well developed and the chemistry is fantastic.
I:1639;458;I love Maggie and Dustin in these roles, and Emma Thompson as usual, is standout, as she is faced with her writer's block, and struggles with writing a tragedy vs a comedy.
I:1639;459;The film also reminds us what things are important in life, and how our behavior would/would not change if faced with sudden death.
I:1639;460;"Although most people would anticipate a comedy, when Will Farrel is involved, this film, laces realism with a provocative challenge of examining our lives in a more ""aware"" state of mind."
I:1639;461;recommend for a night of reflection, laughter and consideration.
I:1639;462;There's a romance between Will Ferrell's character, and a baker his auditing.
I:1639;463;This is one of my favorite films ever.
I:1639;464;Every character is quirky and endearing.
I:1639;465;The movie's premise and how it plays out is gripping and kept me absorbed, so much so that I was literally holding my breath at the end to see how it would turn out.
I:1639;466;I've recommended this movie to everyone.
I:1639;467;It's just a solid, lovely, wonderfully engaging film and Will Ferrell as a pure drama actor is magnificent.
I:1639;468;He's hearing a voice narrating his life, and naturally, it causes a lot of havoc.
I:1639;469;it's such a clever, fascinating story.
I:1639;470;What makes it wonderful, though, is that that isn't all there is to the story.
I:1639;471;there's also the love story between Harold and the baker, which was sweet and believable.
I:1639;472;Her free spirit is a perfect foil for his regimented existence.
I:1639;473;Will Ferrell and Maggie Gyllenhaal bring the characters to life so convincingly you forget they're just acting.
I:1639;474;The assistant's calm but determined demeanor works so well with the author who's alternately stuck inside her head and going off on flights of fancy.
I:1639;475;Again, Emma Thompson and Queen Latifah are just perfect in the roles.
I:1639;476;My men enjoyed it as much as I did.
I:1639;477;My daughter recommended this movie to me and it is well worth watching.
I:1639;478;Not your typical fare, but well done and insightful.
I:1639;479;A more serious Will Ferrell than usual, but much human warmth and quiet humor.
I:1639;480;However I watched it the next day on a full night's sleep and I just loved it.
I:1639;481;It is the very first movie that Will Ferrell has ever been funny in, normally you just have to settle for stupid when it comes to the roles he takes.
I:1639;482;Better yet he plays a serious role as an IRS auditor and just nails the role perfectly.
I:1639;483;Maggie Gyllenhaal co. stars as his love interest and their chemistry works well enough to carry this one way over the top.
I:1639;484;This movie has all the things that make movie watching great for me, excellent origional story, funny, and a nice amount of romance.
I:1639;485;good comedy, but I didn't find that much to laugh at in this film, or to feel good about.
I:1639;486;Honestly, I'm not even a huge fan of Will Ferrell's comedies, and frankly, I thought he did a fine job here.
I:1639;487;anyways, the acting is all fine.
I:1639;488;they're all great, as is usual for all of them.
I:1639;489;It's all very odd, but never feels as powerful, poignant or sweeping as, say, a Charlie Kaufman film.
I:1639;490;two and a half stars, rounded up to three in deference to Will Ferrell's emergence as a capable serious actor.
I:1639;491;This film is a real delight.
I:1639;492;day fairy tale that brings the best out in its cast.
I:1639;493;Thompson, Hoffman and the Queen are all very, very good and I dare you to not fall in love with Maggie Gyllenhaal here.
I:1639;494;This one will keep you glued to your seat while cheering on the protaganists.
I:1639;495;The fact that the answer the film provides to this anxiety.
I:1639;496;authorship in an interesting and unfamiliar way and it serves as a sort of a comic wake.
I:1639;497;hit potential) and romantic comedy (with Hollywood blockbuster break.
I:1639;498;"The writer is of two minds about everything
I:1639;499;the most fascinating way to read this film, I think, is to see both writer and character as two sides of the same person, and to view both to be involved in the identical struggle to liberate themselves from their own formulations.
I:1639;500;But since its an American film and not a French film it has to be a romantic comedy and so the characters do not need to speak because the fact that it will eventually be a romantic comedy .
I:1639;501;And he steals the show, at least in my book.
I:1639;502;He's perfectly at ease with life being reduced to formula.
I:1639;503;i highly recommend you do.
I:1639;504;Stranger Than Fiction is two stories that are artfully melded into a seamless movie.
I:1639;505;"In itself, this is a difficult concept to pull off, and ""Stranger Than Fiction"" does an excellent job in this regard."
I:1639;506;what makes the movie worth five stars is that there is also the story in which Harold Crick is involved in real life.
I:1639;507;this is indeed a unique and enjoyable movie.
I:1639;508;I watched it and really liked it.
I:1639;509;I think it was one of Will Ferrell's best performances.
I:1639;510;This movie is funny and sad.
I:1639;511;Great actors, great story and Will Ferrell is wonderful as the main character.
I:1639;512;Somewhat of a fantasy comedy, like Groundhog Day, and I loved it.
I:1639;513;One of the best movies I've seen in quite a while.
I:1639;514;It reminded me of how much work can suck, how great flirting and love feels and how powerful the written word can be when converted into action.
I:1639;515;I had already seen this movie before, but I liked it so much that I wanted to have my own copy.
I:1639;516;I am not a Will Ferrell fan in the least little bit but I have to say I enjoyed this movie.
I:1639;517;I thought the story was fairly original and it was well done.
I:1639;518;Will Ferrell did a great job in this outstanding story of a story in progress, wherein the main character realizes he IS the main character, and with the help of Dustin Hoffman attempts to find out who the author is.
I:1639;519;stranger than Fiction was very memorable, and very entertaining.
I:1639;520;ferrell's character is endearing once we find out what he's really like.
I:1639;521;stranger Than Fiction lived up to it's name and I found it incredibly entertaining, comical, romantic and really quite well done.
I:1639;522;It's tough to pull of the story of a story in a story, but this is exactly what Marc Forster and the actors did, with great success.
I:1639;523;other than that, the movie helps questioning the ordinariness of life.
I:1639;524;It can even be said that he just works and breaths and sleeps.
I:1639;525;This change in Harold's life reminds us what we are also missing from our lives: it can be love, sports, travelling, success, anything.
I:1639;526;Is it why we have morals and right and wrongs?Harold's life is, in fact, everyone's life.
I:1639;527;"Overall, this is a movie with wonderful acting, messages, ironies, metaphors, symbols and ""a better vocabulary!"
I:1639;528;Directed with a nice contemporary panache by the increasingly versatile Marc Forster, the fantasy.
I:1639;529;one morning, he hears a particularly erudite voice describe his life with real.
I:1639;530;time precision and zealous literacy.
I:1639;531;In the meantime, Harold finds himself drawn to a high.
I:1639;532;how Helm and Forster resolve this fanciful dilemma is the best part of the movie because they build the far.
I:1639;533;fetched convolutions toward a satisfying emotional resonance.
I:1639;534;wire act of Kaufman's best work, the film still has genuinely clever plot turns and moments of creative momentum.
I:1639;535;In a reflective seriocomic performance, Will Ferrell proves he has the acting chops to handle the gravity of Harold's dilemma, even if he has to act constrained most of the time.
I:1639;536;Emma Thompson manages to capture Eiffel's angst.
I:1639;537;as Ana, Maggie Gyllenhaal finally has a role worthy of her ripened, effortlessly coquettish persona.
I:1639;538;With this accomplished film, Forster really shows a flair for balancing the whimsical with the tangible that drive Helm's charmingly inventive story.
I:1639;539;I'm a huge fan of Will Ferrell.
I:1639;540;To pair these two together had the potential to create one of the best comedies ever.
I:1639;541;be love interest was perhaps the single most believable aspect of this movie, due to spectacular onscreen chemistry.
I:1639;542;As a writer, I had such high hopes for this flick.
I:1639;543;I really enjoyed this movie.
I:1639;544;funny, cute, but with a good message.
I:1639;545;if you enjoy lighthearted movies, this is perfect.
I:1639;546;Separately, all the actors in this movie are gifted, and I enjoy them, but put them together and all you get is a slow, left of center movie that at the end of the day, just doesn't work.
I:1639;547;When I want to see more of a particular actor after seeing one of their films, I look them up on Amazon and read the reviews of the films with the best average ratings.
I:1639;548;Everybody was photographed so well.
I:1639;549;some other points worth mentioning:1.
I:1639;550;As full an experience as this film was/is, the extras made it that much more so.
I:1639;551;Generous, illuminating, and a completion of an already superb experience.2.
I:1639;552;style graphics in this film broke new ground in my experience by adding a whole new layer of information about what the main character is thinking as he is acting, AND being narrated by the voice.
I:1639;553;USed her with a human, it added an extra dimension of description of the (human) character.
I:1639;554;"Also, as a result of her perrformance in this movie and ""Secretary,"" I will trust the next movie that comes out with her in it."
I:1639;555;"For me, this movie was wonderful in the same strange and magical way as M. Night Shyamalan's ""Lady in the Water"" and I hope to discover others situated in this odd nether world between realism and surrealism."
I:1639;556;"perhaps I will give Robin William's ""What Dreams May Come"" another viewing.6."
I:1639;557;"After a few days and a reading of Henry David Thoreau's essay, ""Civil Disobedience,"" I have an elevated appreciation for the subtext of civil disobediance undertaken by Miss Gyllenhaal's character, and by the choice to write the hero as a functionary for the IRS."
I:1639;558;Any reading of Thoreau's essay will convince the reader that it was a powerful influence that shaped this story line.
I:1639;559;provoking, and certainly not accurate depictions of my own creative process.
I:1639;560;She is narrating his life, with surprising accuracy.
I:1639;561;life characters are one and the same, sharing the fate decided by the writer.
I:1639;562;Thompson plays one of her best roles in years.
I:1639;563;"grossing ""Talledega Nights,"" Farrell proves he can be a riveting screen presence even when subdued."
I:1639;564;"affirming, ""Stranger than Fiction"" explores the world in an unconventional way."
I:1639;565;On the part of the writer, director, and cast, that's the mark of a job well done.
I:1639;566;Oustanding piece of fresh film making.
I:1639;567;The use of digital numbers and charts on screen was a nice twist,and the writing was creative yet economical.
I:1639;568;sequitur), you'll find it a charming and engaging film.
I:1639;569;im very happy to see will do such a great movie filled with heart and a great cast.
I:1639;570;if u like punch drunk love you will like this.
I:1639;571;dustin hoffman is also great in this film.
I:1639;572;very good film and a great screenplay about a man who is written in a book and he doesnt know if the autor is gonna kill him and save him!!
I:1639;573;great movie thats all i can tell u about the plot.
I:1639;574;This movie has some minor faults and it is not Citizen Kane in any revolutionary way, but it was actually my 2nd favorite film of the year (Pan's Labyrinth being #1).
I:1639;575;"There were some films that were more ""Award Worthy"" like Departed or even Babel, but I really enjoyed this movie."
I:1639;576;If your looking to see Will Ferrell in another hilarious comedy you wont find it here.
I:1639;577;Thankfully Stranger Than Fiction also stars Maggie Gyllenhaal and Dustin Hoffman who give impressive performances as a baker and a college literature professor.
I:1639;578;Once he discovers that he is hearing a voice narrating his life, he begins to take action to see what he can do about living a happy existence.
I:1639;579;"After wavering back and forth between the two, the best advice comes from the professor: ""Go out and live your life."
I:1639;580;"make it the one you've always wanted."""
I:1639;581;Harold tries to do this, but eventually is able to identify the narrator's voice, and then there is the race to find her, and what to do ultimately about Harold Crick's fate.
I:1639;582;several quirky characters and the stars that play them, as well as a unique story, make this film not your average comedy.
I:1639;583;Will Farrell epitomizes Crick, with his deadpan appearance and humor, and he gives the film a creative edge.
I:1639;584;Dustin Hoffman turns in a solid performance as the coffee.
I:1639;585;Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal) does a fine job as the strong.
I:1639;586;another commendable element of this film is the point of view and perspective.
I:1639;587;still, Stranger than Fiction is a smart and clever comedy/ drama.
I:1639;588;The statement above can be argued, but Stranger Than Fiction is for sure one of Will Ferrel's best films.
I:1639;589;Like what the Truman Show did for Jim Carrey, Stranger Than Fiction has taken an actor who is mainly known for comedy and has proven that he can also be believable in serious drama roles as well.
I:1639;590;needless to say because of the star power in the film, the acting was equally as impressive.
I:1639;591;There were moments in the movie that had me laughing a while after the jokes was done, and there are scenes that are so emotional, it made me want to tear up and cry.
I:1639;592;I definitely see this as a stand out movie of the year and you definitely can't go wrong watching this movie.
I:1639;593;This is one of my favourite movies of all time.
I:1639;594;the story is amazing and the acting is excellent.
I:1639;595;will Ferrell, best known for appearing in comedies aimed at teenagers, delivers an unusually restrained performance and as a result, gives one of the best performances of his career.
I:1639;596;Crick is essentially just an ordinary guy who is in love with a girl (Maggie Gyllenhaal) and wants to live a long, happy life with her.
I:1639;597;"By contrast, with ""Stranger than Fiction"", I genuinely found myself hoping that Crick would live."
I:1639;598;It is for this reason, I strongly recommend this film.
I:1639;599;"I saw somewhere where it said ""Best Comedy of the Year""."
I:1639;600;Touching and sweet movie that starts out a little odd but makes up for it later.
I:1639;601;The much subdued role fits him very well
I:1639;602;I thought it was a funny,enjoyable little film.
I:1639;603;The actors gave great performences and I think this is Will Ferrell's best movie.
I:1639;604;STRANGER THAN FICTION is one of the more wise, conceptually stunning, finely executed original films to come to the screen in a long time.
I:1639;605;How this little gem of a film went unnoticed by the Academy is anyone's guess, but viewers' alert: spend an evening viewing this film and new standards for excellence will be set for you.
I:1639;606;Taking the chance of working with first time writer Zach Helm (a gifted artist whose niche in the business is already secure with this first venture) and assembling a cast of some of our finest actors proves successful in every graphically odd twist and turn of this unusual, compelling and unclassifiable story.
I:1639;607;finally given a role in which he can prove that he is an actor and not just a foolish pratfall comedian) is a boring, number obsessed IRS agent whose every moment of every day is timed to be exactly the same (with the important co. existence with his wrist watch!)
I:1639;608;government baker Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal, once again proving that she is one of the most formidable talents in film today), and a bizarre but tender attraction slowly ensues.
I:1639;609;And a cleverly written conclusion it is.
I:1639;610;Zach Helm is obviously a brilliant, well.
I:1639;611;Forster wisely uses graphic superimpositions of numbers and graphs and lines to show us the inside of Harold's intriguing mind, all the while allowing us to draw close to the needy and tender aspect of this nerd of nerds, thus making the involvement with his narrator, his girlfriend Ana, and his doctors and professor wholly credible.
I:1639;612;But Will Ferrell here opens an important new door for his career: he can act!
I:1639;613;The ensemble cast could not be improved upon and it is refreshing to see the widely disparate types of actors gathered here work as a cohesive and impeccable unit.
I:1639;614;Bravo to the entire cast and crew of this little masterwork!
I:1639;615;It also had a serious side to it which gave it a great ending.
I:1639;616;He does very well and I can't imagine this move with another male lead actor.
I:1639;617;After STF, Will Ferrell can definitely act.
I:1639;618;I'd go as far as saying this was one of the five best films of 2006.
I:1639;619;Maggie Gyllenhaal has something about her, something enough for me to have a crush on her.
I:1639;620;:) I thought the best thing about the film was the screenplay, direction and the music.
I:1639;621;The music was unwinding, freeing and stolid all at once.
I:1639;622;I loved the passion with which it was made (My other best films of the year include .
I:1639;623;Stranger than fiction is a comfortable #5.)
I:1639;624;One of my favorite movies.
I:1639;625;Will Ferrell is a steller dramatic actor and everyone else is top notch.
I:1639;626;The whole thing is fantastic.
I:1639;627;The very pleasant news is that, yes, indeed, he can.
I:1639;628;the cast really is very well assembled.
I:1639;629;Dustin Hoffman adds a certain authority and a welcome layer of quirkiness to his role of Lit.
I:1639;630;cute Maggie Gyllenhaal sparkles as the very sassy and independent cookie maker Ana Pascal, whose immediate on.
I:1639;631;screen chemistry with Ferrell serves to underscore the pre.
I:1639;632;"She is convincing enough in her role that, pretty soon, I stopped looking at her and thinking, ""Hey, that's Queen Latifah!"
I:1639;633;But, despite the rest of the stellar cast and their excellent contributions, it's leading star Will Ferrell who gives STRANGER THAN FICTION its heart and soul.
I:1639;634;He has never been more engaging.
I:1639;635;"My favorite moment has to be Harold strumming his guitar and quietly singing the Monkee's ""I'd Go the Whole Wide World"" with unaffected earnestness."
I:1639;636;"this is an informative featurette which adds even more heft to Harold's character as it reveals how the graphic designers used Graphic User Interface to illustrate the world as seen from Harold's perspective
I:1639;637;The outcome of Harold Crick is ultimately up to Karen Eiffell, who holds the power of God over him.
I:1639;638;sTRANGER THAN FICTION is an engaging fable which convincingly argues for upending the tired conventions which sticks one in a rut.
I:1639;639;It calls for you and me to imbue each precious moment with a passion for living.
I:1639;640;Countless movies before have espoused this mantra, but few have delivered it with such delicate panache.
I:1639;641;For example, IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, warm and memorable though it is and as much as I love it, chooses to hammer home its message (Capra always was unabashedly sentimental, and there's nothing wrong with that).
I:1639;642;Just go with the flow and you will reap cinematic dividends.
I:1639;643;So far, this is the best Will Ferrell I've seen in feature films.
I:1639;644;Well, I read the script and watched the film as well.
I:1639;645;the movie delivers the script very precisly.
I:1639;646;will did his job very well, even better than the script itself.
I:1639;647;Stranger than Fiction is a unique comedy.
I:1639;648;The special features includes several behind.
I:1639;649;scenes featurettes including hilarious on.
I:1639;650;The movie marks Will Ferrell's first foray into more dramatic roles, a welcome change from the wacky and silly roles that he is famous for.
I:1639;651;Harold Crick is a nice man, a little dull at times, but honest and hardworking nonetheless.
I:1639;652;"happy ending for the character, Harold must figure out how to prevent his ""untimely"" death."
I:1639;653;i really liked Maggie Gyllenhaal and Queen Latifah's roles in this movie.
I:1639;654;I also liked some points that the movie implied about literature.
I:1639;655;He can do more than slapstick.
I:1639;656;Instead, he was near perfect in his role here as was the rest of the cast.
I:1639;657;An interesting and entertaining movie.
I:1639;658;This is actually now my favorite movie of all time, I enjoy the theme of changing one's life and the actions that occur as a result.
I:1639;659;an impressive movie and a total sleeper hit.
I:1639;660;the gorgeous but rebellious Anna Pascale (Maggie Gyllenhaal).
I:1639;661;He's an important character who helps Crick track down the elusive novelist.
I:1639;662;It's all very well cast.
I:1639;663;I for one am very happy to award it the full five stars.
I:1639;664;In his past movies, Will Ferrell has taken up roles which portray him as a wild and sarcastic funny character, such as in Elf and Anchorman.
I:1639;665;But the humor that is included here is more of a subtle type, where other people act weird and the audience can relate to Will's reactions.
I:1639;666;Overall the movie was enjoyable to watch, with both Maggie Gyllenhaal and Dustin Hoffman giving great performances.
I:1639;667;The cookie scene was hilarious.
I:1639;668;He can be a good actor when he want's to be.
I:1639;669;If he dies, the book will be a masterpiece.
I:1639;670;"top performances that are his trademark
I:1639;671;Emma Thompson is always great.
I:1639;672;her reaction when she discovers that her character is real is exactly right.
I:1639;673;Dustin Hoffman is excellent as the nice.
I:1639;674;guy professor with an edge.
I:1639;675;He really believes that the book is worth the life of the man standing right in front of him.
I:1639;676;sTRANGER THAN FICTION is rapidly becoming one of my favorite movies.
I:1639;677;I bought it two weeks ago and have watched it three times.
I:1639;678;Each time I notice more and more of the subtle touches the director brought to the film.
I:1639;679;I highly recommend it to anybody who prefers a little thought with their comedy.
I:1639;680;emma Thompson is brilliant as Karen Eiffel, the towering writer of tragic fiction, unheard from and quite untraceable for the past 10 years.
I:1639;681;She gets rather attractive the way you want her to be near the end, when she can't make up her mind and approaches the professor.
I:1639;682;"Best Line: ""I don't *need* nicotine patches ."
I:1639;683;Maggie Gyllenhaal is quite precocious as Ms. Pascal, the boisterous baker and the subject of HC's attentions, professional and otherwise.
I:1639;684;I'll definitely have to look for more.
I:1639;685;I'd like to see her take on more roles like this one.
I:1639;686;"Best Line: ""So do you always come up with your best ideas outside in the pouring rain?"
I:1639;687;Best Line: I have no idea.
I:1639;688;so somebody please tell me if I've over.
I:1639;689;lines is pretty much de rigueur.
I:1639;690;Hope you enjoy STF as much as I did.
I:1639;691;definitely a funny movie though :)
I:1639;692;the movie is really, really great and beautiful.
I:1639;693;probably one of the best movies i've seen in the last year.
I:1639;694;Stranger Than Fiction is a perfect film with one tiny flaw: it doesn't actually make sense.
I:1639;695;It's also closer to perfection as a post.
I:1639;696;Such eccentric characters are perfectly at home in what amounts to a self.
I:1639;697;comedy, in which fictional beings grasp to be real.
I:1639;698;the movie we are seeing.
I:1639;699;good movies is that it actually earns our good feelings.
I:1639;700;It's eccentric and unique enough to create a sense of uncertainty as to where it's going, and the resulting tension.
I:1639;701;"As with Kaufman, almost every line in the film comes as a surprise
I:1639;702;The energy and lightness of Marc Forster's direction, and the playful ingenuity of Zach Helm's script, give the impression that the filmmakers are surprising even themselves.
I:1639;703;The film crackles with laughter and pathos, the laughs are easy and grateful, the tears sweet and unsullied by sentimentality.
I:1639;704;The beautiful irony of Stranger Than Fiction is that, by making Crick semi.
I:1639;705;fictional within his own life, he comes to seem far more real than most movie protagonists ever do.
I:1639;706;I think it's the best film of 2006.
I:1639;707;One of the touching quirks of the movie (and of Will Ferrell's pitch.
I:1639;708;"perfect performance) is that the ""soulless"" civil servant is the most innocent and endearing character in the film, while it is the tormented artist."
I:1639;709;When Eiffel discovers her character is a living, breathing person.
I:1639;710;"The question arises: as a ""creator,"" is being true to her tale necessarily ""right"" for the character in it?"
I:1639;711;She has learned that there is more to real fiction than taking lives, that there is a time for mercy as well as sacrifice.
I:1639;712;It's existential in nature if you look past the comedy.
I:1639;713;It's a great movie I'd recommend.
I:1639;714;What a lovely surprise this movie was!
I:1639;715;I should have expected as much from the always wonderful Emma Thompson, but Will Ferrell was equally appealing.
I:1639;716;This unusual story about a man who discovers he is a character in a novel being written by the Emma Thompson character was sweet, tender and dare I say, heartwarming.
I:1639;717;establishment gal with cool tattoos (she needs a man.
I:1639;718;travel stories are hard to keep consistent, and this little problem often made it perplexing.
I:1639;719;The film is so straightforward, the characters, despite their uni.
I:1639;720;dimensional existence, so earnest, and the look so good that I left it pleased, not annoyed.
I:1639;721;Neither the book nor the film is a masterpiece, but worth the time to watch.
I:1639;722;The acting of both Will Ferrell and Emma Thompson are excellent.
I:1639;723;Will's Harold Crick, the IRS agent lives in solitude, is so understated, and yet even more funny than his usual over.
I:1639;724;"Emma's Kay Eiffel, the crazy and gifted author, is superb that (in Gui's words) ""you forget it is Emma Thompson the moment you lay eyes on her."""
I:1639;725;She is able to act out all the little quirky ways unique of an author, the things you would never have imagined an author would do for a book, but when you see it acted out by Emma, you'd think, yeah, that rings true.
I:1639;726;Dustin Hoffman did a good job, too.
I:1639;727;It is a fun little movie.
I:1639;728;A perfect date movie, with some intelligence, for once.
I:1639;729;The casting, the performances and most of the dialogs were very good.
I:1639;730;The dialogs were quirky and thoughtful.
I:1639;731;Lines within their context are very good indeed.
I:1639;732;Within its context, it is a fairly profound line.
I:1639;733;Ferrell is very good in this.
I:1639;734;The quaint characters and the spiffy dialog don't quite make for great movie.
I:1639;735;i would give it 3 1/2 stars because of the performances.
I:1639;736;Just another side to this actor, it was so much fun to watch, dark comedy full of life lessons.
I:1639;737;he's very good at it and he had the best of the best in supporting actors.
I:1639;738;"even with ""the queen"" in it it stunk."
I:1639;739;Give reality a break and visit your imagination for this delightfully mellow uplifting movie.
I:1639;740;Will F. is convincing and charming.
I:1639;741;If there is one thing I've learned about authors who write fiction, it's that believable characters can really make a story work.
I:1639;742;The fictional character can be so realistic that the author can have feelings about the character.
I:1639;743;It's an interesting fact if you never knew this.
I:1639;744;Stranger Than Fiction takes this idea to another level and so goes the story.
I:1639;745;i do like the fact that this film keeps jokes about a voice in one's mind to a minimum.
I:1639;746;The film explores the theme of living life to the fullest if you knew that your life would be over at some point.
I:1639;747;The production and direction were stylish and engaging as well as the acting.
I:1639;748;Will Ferrell gave a great performance as the protagonist, much restrained in comparison to previous roles but Maggie Gyllenhaal steals the show for coming across as both funny and sad.
I:1639;749;Emma Thompson is enjoyable to watch doing practically anything, and this role gave her a lot to play with.
I:1639;750;Last but not least, the supporting cast (most notably Queen Latifah) was solid and held the film together.
I:1639;751;The story was clever, sometimes funny, sometimes tragic, and moved along well.
I:1639;752;I liked the writing and diagrams on screen to represent Crick's thought process, and the look of the film is adequately eccentric, even though the story almost leads to nothing.
I:1639;753;Forster has an incredible imagination and a way of creating such a unique world, story and complicated plot but somehow makes it truly watchable.
I:1639;754;Stranger that Fiction certainly succeeds in creating a much more humane story than the sometimes simple.
I:1639;755;I love love love this movie!
I:1639;756;Seeing Will Farrell step outside of his usual comedic role (even though he is still humorous in this movie) is refreshing.
I:1639;757;I share it with everyone I know because I enjoy it so much.
I:1639;758;It is witty and charming and sweet!
I:1639;759;Will best movies by far in this carrier, great interpretation, great argument of movies well developed make you think about what is valuable in life could not stop crying at the end.
I:1639;760;As an accountant it might appeal to me more, but my husband loves the clean cinematography.
I:1639;761;"For anyone who has even a vague understanding of the concept of ""synchronicity"" and all its permutations, this is a great movie."
I:1639;762;while the plot here, without revealing it, may be a little far fetched, the movie beautifully illustrates what some people feel a lot more than others, about the hidden forces in our lives.
I:1639;763;will Ferrell is mostly known as a comedian.
I:1639;764;Sometimes, that's true for Dustin Hoffman as well, but in this movie, they both play quite serious characters.
I:1639;765;Emma Thompson and Maggie Gyllenhall are just icing on the cake, and turn in great performances in their own right.
I:1639;766;some have described this movie as a romantic comedy.
I:1639;767;It's the type of film that will resonate for years, and is destined to become an all time classic.
I:1639;768;Will Farrell(nominated for a Golden Globe for his role as Harold Crick in this movie), Maggie Gyllenhaal, Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson, really shining crew and good performance.
I:1639;769;"I recommend this movie, but I think if you want something ""very comedy"", it's not for you"
I:1639;770;Great story but they missed defining the invisible characters.
I:1639;771;thoughts and projections are Real.
I:1639;772;Stranger than Fiction is an original and delightful film.
I:1639;773;The fun begins when he starts to hear the voice narrating his life and learns of his impending death.
I:1639;774;Out of desperation and with the help of a literary professor and a warm.
I:1639;775;will Ferrell as Harold leads the impressive cast in a subtle performance.
I:1639;776;Ferrell allows the humor to come from the situation of his character discovering he may be a fictional character and the absurdity of trying to be believed when telling others.
I:1639;777;He is given warmth and depth as he changes his life on a path to alter the destiny Karen has planned for him.
I:1639;778;Dustin Hoffman is delightful as the quirky literary professor who helps Harold on his journey to discover who he is and find Karen.
I:1639;779;spirited baker he is sent to audit, played by Maggie Gyllenhaal, Harold learns to love and care about more than the numbers that fill all parts of his life.
I:1639;780;the film's direction takes its queue from the unique twist of the script's plot, highlighting the difference in Harold's narrated life of numbers with the one he builds for himself as he takes control of his own destiny.
I:1639;781;The choices he makes on his journey to discover who he is give the film a rich and fulfilling life that had me laughing out loud.
I:1639;782;First, I thought that it would be a funny movie, I mean come on, Will Ferrell's in it and it's about a guy who hears a voice!
I:1639;783;There are some funny parts but it's really not funny but pretty serious and really good.
I:1639;784;But he was excellent and I would very much recommend anyone see it.
I:1639;785;I highly reccomend this movie to anyone looking for a good Will Ferrell movie.
I:1639;786;This movie is a great way to spend a family night.
I:1639;787;Id recommend it to anyone.
I:1639;788;First watch it to gain the general outline and progress of the story, relax and let it flow.
I:1639;789;Watch it first for the pleasure of it.
I:1639;790;"rated work, Paul Newman's ""Mr. and Mrs. Bridge"", it asks serious questions about the difference between ""living"" and ""existing."""
I:1639;791;Listen carefully as Dustin Hoffman's character explains the essence of tragic and comedic literature and how they depict life.
I:1639;792;good movies do much more than entertain.
I:1639;793;This is short review and I've missed a lot of detail but the scenes with Hoffman are worth seeing this movie.
I:1639;794;So check your reality at the door and enjoy.
I:1639;795;One of the smartest romantic comedies I've ever seen.
I:1639;796;This is one of those movies that makes you feel smart if you get it, in part because all of the characters are smart (all of them are named after engineers or mathematicians).
I:1639;797;"It has one of my favorite quotes of all time:Dustin Hoffman: ""Let's start at ridiculous and move backwards."
I:1639;798;And the perfect cast is just top.
I:1639;799;Emma Thompson and Queen Latifah play off each other brilliantly, as do Will Ferrell and Maggie Gyllenhaal.
I:1639;800;And Dustin Hoffman, of course, is always a pleasure to watch.
I:1639;801;Classic movie with GOOD .
I:1639;802;classic movie with GOOD .
I:1639;803;I have not cared for a lot of Will Ferrel's more recent movies but this one was very enjoyable.
I:1639;804;Great movie to watch with the family, and looks great on Blu.
I:1639;805;Emma Thompson is utterly brilliant as a tortured writer.
I:1639;806;Her acting is absolutely dead.
I:1639;807;This was the best I've ever seen him.
I:1639;808;Dustin Hoffman is perfect as the slightly trippy literature professor taking Crick's story seriously.
I:1639;809;Maggie Gyllenhaal is terrific and beautiful as the purposely tax.
I:1639;810;dodging hippie baker and love interest.
I:1639;811;Thoroughly enjoyable every time she appeared on the screen.
I:1639;812;But the story is entertaining, and for once a popular movie with top stars engages your mind and your emotions.
I:1639;813;It's a guaranteed enjoyable evening.
I:1639;814;I fell in love with this movie from almost the first moment and continued to enjoy every minute to the end.
I:1639;815;I found it to be wonderful, heartfelt and genuine, with superb acting from every member of the cast.
I:1639;816;This movie is for viewers who appreciate quirky, understated, charming and very funny.
I:1639;817;because it's very much worth viewing, even if you end up not liking the ending.
I:1639;818;Because I thought I'd figured out how it was going to end.
I:1639;819;Go, live your life and be free.
I:1639;820;This all star comedic cast delivers in this clean cut immensely charming flick.
I:1639;821;But what Karen doesn't know is that Harold Crick is real.
I:1639;822;an intelligent and charming story about delusions, irony, discovery, love, and most importantly a wrist watch, that will warm your heart and stay with you forever.
I:1639;823;It will always remain as one of my favorite movies of all time.
I:1639;824;the voice (Emma Thompson)comes into his life.
I:1639;825;in a twist of fate and circumstance Harrold beats the odds,all thanks to a wristwatch that wasn't set correctly.
I:1639;826;I thoroughly enjoyed this film and it turned out to be far better and entertaining than I had precieved.
I:1639;827;i liked this film because of its quirky humor and most of all because of its originality.
I:1639;828;"its nice to get a fesh breath of air once in a while from a place that usually relys on sequels and ""quote"" summer block busters to make their bread and butter."
I:1639;829;stranger than Fiction also has a great cast and storyline,you almost have to have no soul, sense of humor or be a completely borring person to not like this film.
I:1639;830;Damn Hollywood and their need for happy endings.
I:1639;831;Stranger Than Fiction is very original, well.
I:1639;832;The ending is satisfying, nice to see.
I:1639;833;Will Ferrell (once again blending nicely into a comedy.
I:1639;834;Harold finds that a female is narrating his life and only he can hear it.
I:1639;835;We know (in an example of dramatic irony, hilariously noted by Dustin Hoffman) that the narrator is Karen Eiffel (Emma Thompson, who's terrific), a famous writer who hasn't published a novel in 10 years due to writer's block.
I:1639;836;But then Ana begins to fall for Harold (surprisingly both Ferrell and Gyllenhaal have pretty good chemistry together) and things look up.
I:1639;837;Until a construction company almost demolishes his apartment, while he's inside watching TV Thompson's narration of the events is absolutely hilarious and Thompson's voice is so suited for the role.
I:1639;838;The movie has a great look to it and for a while I had a lot of hope for it.
I:1639;839;"I still enjoyed ""Stranger Than Fiction"" quite a bit and, as I said, I did enjoy the ending and maybe the ending I was hoping for wouldn't have worked as good."
I:1639;840;All the actors are perfectly cast in their roles.
I:1639;841;ferrell is doing a very good job at slowly easing his way into the drama category, Hoffman and Thompson are perfect, and Latifah and Gyllenhaal add a lot of nice moments to the film.
I:1639;842;"I recommend ""Stranger Than Fiction"" it's certainly one of the best films of its kind from 2006 and has a lot more originality than those other films."
I:1639;843;Stranger Than Fiction is a meditation on life, art and romance, and on waking up to life and the kinds of responsibility we have.
I:1639;844;Will Ferrel is perfect for the role of Harold and gets great support from the cast, including Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson.
I:1639;845;This is a movie just about anyone can enjoy, and even makes for a good date movie.
I:1639;846;Will Ferrel puts forth a spectacular performance as events unfold along an excellent plot line.
I:1639;847;The theme is also intriguing, though I'm deliberately avoiding details so you can get the full enjoyment of the flick.
I:1639;848;this movie is one of the best performed, directed, edited movies that i've viewed recently.
I:1639;849;what great was the movie itself.
I:1639;850;will ferrell has transcended himself from an exaggerating comedian actor to a mature, deep, and greater actor in this movie.
I:1639;851;his performance was right on the money, just right, not more, not less, just fine.
I:1639;852;and i'll move him up and into my A list absolutely.
I:1639;853;An amazing 50gb MPEG.2 transfer and great DD 5.1 and uncompressed PCM 5.1 track as well.
I:1639;854;Great for your first Blu.
I:1639;855;It is not a typical Ferrell comedy vehicle, but it is a great story, with a fine supporting cast.
I:1639;856;Pay close attention to the animated graphics.
I:1639;857;"It's Will Ferrell as a normal human being
I:1639;858;I teach Creative Writing and I show this film when they begin writing their short stories and they all enjoy it.
I:1639;859;Each character is terrific, although Emma Thompson is the most fun to watch.
I:1639;860;It's definitely worth watching more than once.
I:1639;861;the Spoon songs on the soundtrack are a bonus and perfect match.
I:1639;862;Great aspects and wonderful story line.
I:1639;863;Stranger Than Fiction is one of my favorite movies.
I:1639;864;It is sweet and poignant and hilarious.
I:1639;865;Must see if you haven't yet!
I:1639;866;This movie is the best.
I:1639;867;It is weird but great with a plot unbelievable and a bit chilling.
I:1639;868;top as it is in some films, but it did rely heavily on ever.
I:1639;869;"greater interaction with the love interest, a more casual wardrobe, a hip song performance, and a handful of other overused vehicles that scream ""Look at me!"
I:1639;870;I'm a character with an ARC!
I:1639;871;When the success of a story hinges on the audience caring about whether the hero lives or dies, the audience had better want him to live.
I:1639;872;the dryness of the humor, the attempts at stylish special effects, the offbeat nature of the story, the pacing of it all .
I:1639;873;"these are all hallmarks of films I love and should have been an easy ""in"" for the filmmakers with a viewer like me."
I:1639;874;Emma Thompson was, as usual, more than competent in her role, but to what end?
I:1639;875;If you're a diehard Ferrell fan, maybe it's worth the price of admission to laugh at Ferrell as he ties his necktie and brushes his teeth.
I:1639;876;"To think that he was being ""watched"" and written about, but even the author didn't know he was real was amazing."
I:1639;877;Casting is amazing the right amount of funny, drama,from casting to soundtrack a good movie.
I:1639;878;Fortunately, the story also works well enough to keep us more than interested.
I:1639;879;Very quirky and full of surprises, I found Stanger than Fiction a real gem.
I:1639;880;Will Ferrell is brilliant as well.
I:1639;881;this is arguably his best movie, as he shows some decent range and emotion in a well written and portrayed script.
I:1639;882;This movie is a perfect example of the fact that comedies can carry some wit and depth and still make for not only a good comedy, but a good movie in general!
I:1639;883;Will Ferrell gives his best performance.
I:1639;884;clever slightly mocking to often sarcastic dialogue and narration invited me to laugh out loud several times.
I:1639;885;Subtle special effects and camera angles created a sense of impending doom and made the movie alternate between racing to the conclusion and standing still, peeking into Harold's abyss.
I:1639;886;part love story, part second.
I:1639;887;life story, part suspense, part character.
I:1639;888;"The coffee swilling professor who ""helps"" Harold, and the chain."
I:1639;889;good movies in general, you may find much to like in Stranger than Fiction.
I:1639;890;If you like clever, unique or words, give it a shot.
I:1639;891;I have only seen 1 Will Ferrel role I didnt like.
I:1639;892;This is a classy sweet and funny movie.
I:1639;893;A nice ORIGINAL romantic comedy is always a breath of fresh air.
I:1639;894;I'll come right out and say it .
I:1639;895;Not every comedic actor makes a successful transition to drama, after all.
I:1639;896;it turns out I was pleasantly surprised by this movie.
I:1639;897;and finds a fresh new twist to it.
I:1639;898;"But the ""narrative of life"" angle gives it a fresh twist, and the quirky and believable characters help further the story along."
I:1639;899;In a day and age when most films are populated by caricatures instead of real people, it's nice to find a film made up of actual people, characters who you might easily recognize from your own circle of friends and acquaintances.
I:1639;900;And while the film is quite funny, making it more of a comedy.
I:1639;901;out/shocker humor to get a laugh, but instead finds humor in the situation and character interactions .
I:1639;902;the best kind of comedy, in my opinion.
I:1639;903;the actors do a marvelous job of carrying the film and portraying the characters as well.
I:1639;904;Will Ferrell delivers a surprisingly nuanced and restrained role as Harold, the lead character, and while the film provides him a few chances to cut loose and be over the top (such as loudly telling his inner voice to shut up or beating his bed with a lamp .
I:1639;905;it makes sense on context), the film works best when he's quieter and more reserved.
I:1639;906;Emma Thompson is darkly delightful as a snarky author trying to decide how best to off her main character, while Queen Latifah .
I:1639;907;primarily known for comedy much like Ferrell .
I:1639;908;is remarkably quiet and reserved as her assistant.
I:1639;909;drama that's well worth a look.
I:1639;910;Even if you're not a Will Ferrell fan, you'll most likely enjoy this film, as it's an atypical role for Ferrell and a comedy that doesn't rely on shock value or mindless slapstick to work.
I:1639;911;Karen (Emma Thompson) is a best selling cult novelist like Anne Tyler or someone who's famous for the consistency with which her main characters meet fate, for all of them die.
I:1639;912;when Harold Crick figures out that he's one of her characters, with the help of humanist Dustin Hoffman, he gets upset, naturally enough, and attempts to break down the fortress of solitude Karen Eiffel's erected around herself.
I:1639;913;Queen Latifah must haveread the script, discovered she wasn't playing anything real, and just decided to look elegant and demure, playing a life.
I:1639;914;"that is her total function in the movie, the conventional ""love interest."""
I:1639;915;This film was a this was a great mix of comedy and tragedy, and I love the literary angle.
I:1639;916;Harold Crick, played by Will Ferrell, wakes up one day and hears a voice.
I:1639;917;An omniscient narrator is relating his life with precision and no one can hear that voice but himself.
I:1639;918;it succeeds grandly as a surprisingly thoughtful, amusing, and moving contemplation of life.
I:1639;919;For Harold must immediately confront his mortality when the narrator informs him/us that he will soon die!The complicated narrative of the film is pulled off brilliantly.
I:1639;920;The overlapping structure necessary to maintain the momentum and cohesion of the film must be attributed to a clever, intricate screenplay.
I:1639;921;Lots of interesting effects help to pull the two worlds together making even the most mundane moments of Harold's life visually compelling.
I:1639;922;The movie's construction is fascinating and enjoyable.
I:1639;923;It's refreshing and while I've never considered him a leading man type.
I:1639;924;his tentative romance with Maggie Gyllenhaal (while a bit of a stretch) is played very credibly and sweetly.
I:1639;925;Dustin Hoffman, as a literature professor helping Harold discover what book he's in, is having a great time.
I:1639;926;But it's Emma Thompson that stole my heart.
I:1639;927;but as she begins to realize what is happening, something in her transforms.
I:1639;928;Her character provides much of the film's insight and it's most powerfully dramatic acting.
I:1639;929;It's a deft balancing act, and as usual.
I:1639;930;she hit all the right marks.
I:1639;931;after a near perfect movie, we have to bring both stories of Harold to an end.
I:1639;932;The movie turns into a poignant examination of sacrifice.
I:1639;933;If Thompson kills Harold in her novel, it will be recognized as a great piece of literature.
I:1639;934;This art versus commercialism angle is absolutely enthralling, and also surprising since it is raised so late in the film.
I:1639;935;There are moments of real power as everyone faces important life decisions.
I:1639;936;"but these aren't false ""lessons,"" they are genuine emotion that the film has subtly earned."
I:1639;937;ultimately, the ending is exactly what the film wants it to be.
I:1639;938;it is perfect for the movie because by this point the film itself is mirroring the novel within the film.
I:1639;939;It's a clever bit of trickery and very unusual.
I:1639;940;"I admired ""Stranger Than Fiction"" very much and would give it 4 1/2 stars as an original and intelligent treat."
I:1639;941;As a whole, it was just entertaining and fun to watch.
I:1639;942;The way he and Maggie Gyllenhaal's characters play off one another was one of the funniest parts of the film, and their relationship was a joy to watch.
I:1639;943;In this way, and many others, this movie was cute and romantic while at the same time being insightful and amusing.
I:1639;944;I'd recommend Stranger than Fiction for a relaxing night in when you're in the mood to be thoroughly entertained but can't decide between a drama or a comedy.
I:1639;945;"I knew by the previews that this was going to be an enjoyable flick
I:1639;946;"He lives a very structured and monotonous life
I:1639;947;which obviously leads to the movie funnier side!)
I:1639;948;this movie is really deep.
I:1639;949;THere are many levels of consciousness here and one can easily analyze life and the 'meaning of it all' with this amazingly well.
I:1639;950;For every one who likes a movie that makes them think, dream, fantasize and visualize life as a whole narrated world.
I:1639;951;This movie is not only funny, but it is refreshing.
I:1639;952;Will Ferrell delivers an excellent portrayal of how many people feel every day.
I:1639;953;His transformation throughout the movie is beautiful: he moves from his practical and predicatable lifestyle into a beautiful and life changing relationship with Maggie Gyllenhaal.
I:1639;954;Both actors deliver outstanding performances.
I:1639;955;Emma Thompson and Dustin Hoffman also provide a wonderful support to these leading characters.
I:1639;956;This hands down is my favorite movie of all time.
I:1639;957;i love all the characters and the more you watch this movie, each time you will find more endearing things about the characters.
I:1639;958;this movie speaks to the heart like no other.
I:1639;959;It's sometimes hard to know what you will get when ordering on the internet, but this has been a great experience.
I:1639;960;I was tickled upon first seeing it, and now having seen it several times I've only found it to get better with each viewing.
I:1639;961;There are so many things about it to absorb.
I:1639;962;visually, in terms of the premise and the moral, and also a wonderful and wonderfully executed script.
I:1639;963;I feel giddy when I think about this movie.
I:1639;964;and would most certainly recommend it to anyone!
I:1639;965;Stranger Than Fiction is excellent!
I:1639;966;Will Ferrell gives one of his best performances of his career, thus far.
I:1639;967;"He leads an extraordinary cast that includes Maggie Gyllenhaal, Dustin Hoffman (who worked with Forster on ""Finding Neverland"" (2004), Queen Latifah, and Emma Thompson."
I:1639;968;The story and screenplay by Zach Helm in his writing debut is excellent.
I:1639;969;"The music by Britt Daniel and Brian Reitzell (also the music supervisor, he also did the music to ""Friday Night Lights"" (2004) is excellent!"
I:1639;970;"The cinematography by Roberto Schaefer (who has done the cinematography to Forster's ""Stay"", ""Finding Neverland"", and ""Monster's Ball"") is excellent."
I:1639;971;"The film editing by Matt Chesse (who has done the film editing to Forster's ""Stay"", ""Finding Neverland"", and ""Monster's Ball"") is excellent."
I:1639;972;"The casting by Francine Maisler (who was the casting director on Forster's ""Stay"") is excellent."
I:1639;973;"The production design by Kevin Thompson (who did the production design to Forster's ""Stay"") is excellent!"
I:1639;974;The art direction by Craig Jackson is excellent.
I:1639;975;The set decoration by Ford Wheeler is excellent.
I:1639;976;"The costume design by Frank L. Fleming (who was the costume designer on Forster's ""Stay"" and ""Monster's Ball"") is excellent."
I:1639;977;One day he finds himself hearing a voice that is narrating his everymove.
I:1639;978;good acting by the characters.
I:1639;979;Characters are very simple, very common.
I:1639;980;i like the imaginative plot and subtle humor in this.
I:1639;981;This is a bit of a departure from hollywood normality and that is a good thing.
I:1639;982;The acting is excellent, especially ferrel's performance.
I:1639;983;Best role I've ever seen Will Ferrell in, and he barely cracks a smile.
I:1639;984;It was a Christmas gift and one that was brought happy Thank Yous .
I:1639;985;Will see it on one of my visits I'm sure.
I:1639;986;a great film, a lot of fun, highly recommended!
I:1639;987;"Stranger Than Fiction brings to the screen the unusual story of a very ""usual"" kind of guy."
I:1639;988;"the plot has elements of both comedy and drama making it rather difficult to label it as one or the other
I:1639;989;, Emma Thompson, Dustin Hoffman, and the rest of this AMAZING cast, carry out their respective roles very well.
I:1639;990;What an intriguing concept .
I:1639;991;an ordinary if somewhat introverted man who, unbeknownst to himself, is actually a character in a novel.
I:1639;992;progress, and a novelist whose character, unbeknownst to her, is real.
I:1639;993;Nevertheless, both have been done, and done well.
I:1639;994;The screenplay makes the whole thing comprehensible, and the stellar acting makes it believable.
I:1639;995;The talents of Dustin Hoffman, Latifah, and Emma Thompson are indisputable, and it's a treat to see them in such strong supporting roles.
I:1639;996;Part drama, part comedy, part romance, this little movie has so much going for it.
I:1639;997;This is a fantastic film.
I:1639;998;The casting is superb and the plot is genuinely gripping.
I:1639;999;The overall message of the film is just beautiful.
I:1639;1000;Definitely my favourite film so far.
I:1639;1001;I love this movie, Will Ferrel is a talented actor.
I:1639;1002;the movie was in excellent condition.
I:1639;1003;We ended up so charmed by the fascinating story that we stayed up until midnight to see how it turned out.
I:1639;1004;The story is a wonderful human interest story with a touch of magic.
I:1639;1005;With remarkable determination, he manages to find someone who can shed light on his situation.
I:1639;1006;Dustin Hoffman makes you want to jump out of your seat with his magical performance as a college professor who is the only one who believes the man's story.
I:1639;1007;And Ferrell deserves an Oscar nomination for his not just great performance.
I:1639;1008;one of the best movies we have seen.
I:1639;1009;As a side note, I am a writer, and this film is positively inspirational for me.
I:1639;1010;Loved the concept of this movie .
I:1639;1011;This is one of those quirky, artistic films that carries off neatly an unbelievable premise.
I:1639;1012;I liked this movie, and can understand why some absolutely love it.
I:1639;1013;One of my favorite will Farrow movies.
I:1639;1014;Looks great on blu ray and still makes me laugh especially the whole guitar shop scene.
I:1639;1015;I think this movie is brilliant.
I:1639;1016;"There are endearing characters and the ""in the Head"" commentary is perfect for a fiction lover."
I:1639;1017;The baker Ana (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is cute, bubbly and strong.
I:1639;1018;"This is to be a surprise to the ""voice"" narrating his life ."
I:1639;1019;the movie is entertaining and funny .
I:1639;1020;a good story about life, death and the tax man.
I:1639;1021;A disclaimer: I've got a high tolerance for quirky and this film certainly qualifies as such.
I:1639;1022;I loved it, but I love quirky films a lot more than the mainstream moviegoer.
I:1639;1023;And, indeed, it is one of the best films I've seen in the theater in a while.
I:1639;1024;I smiled throughout the whole of it.
I:1639;1025;the fact of the matter is, it's a fairy tale of sorts for a new and modern society.
I:1639;1026;It's filmed in such an aesthetically astute manner.
I:1639;1027;The actors are at their very best and most endearing.
I:1639;1028;And the writing is wholly engaging.
I:1639;1029;I was planning this to be a funny movie, because the main actor is only in comedy movies.
I:1639;1030;There was a good plot, but I expected better.
I:1639;1031;The speed of how a movie progresses is important to viewers because the producers want to keep the audience drawn into their film.
I:1639;1032;what's daring and admirable is the premise and thesplendid graphics.
I:1639;1033;there are also two splendid performances.
I:1639;1034;will Farrell, Queen Latifah andthe delicious Maggie Gyllenhaal.
I:1639;1035;Fortunately, playing Crick, Will Ferrell can convey real emotional depth along with his humor and his nuanced acting gives the film its emotional resonance.
I:1639;1036;She's bought out of the academic and literary rat race that Eiffel and Hilbert are so invested in.
I:1639;1037;Crick and Ana's love for each leads them to make a healthy compromise in their relationship and love each other despite their tempramental differences.
I:1639;1038;eiffel and Hilbert, both dowdy and unattached, serve as a cautionary tale to the younger Harold and Ana.
I:1639;1039;Will ferrell, Queen Latifah, Dustin Hoffman, Emma Thompson, and Maggie Gyllenhaal at their best.
I:1639;1040;from the opening, the picture runs with smooth transitions, cunning camera angles, and clever mathematical overlays.
I:1639;1041;Emma Thompson narrates in a beautiful and intelligent british accent.
I:1639;1042;The movie drags quite a bit, but overall I believe it is worth the wait.
I:1639;1043;"stranger than Fiction is a clever, comical, yet deep heartwarmer that is a ""must see""."
I:1639;1044;Stranger Than Fiction reminds me of the kind of profound thinking that doesn't seem quite as trenchant after you've had a chance to sober up.
I:1639;1045;Stranger Than Fiction is a blast from the past for middle.
I:1639;1046;It is glimmer from a time when you any thought seemed brilliant, and just the fact that you were asking the big questions was exhilarating.
I:1639;1047;Pure nostalgia, in other words.
I:1639;1048;the central conceit of the film is rather trite, and inconsistently utilized, but provides a vehicle for a pretty nice bit of romance between Will Ferrell and a remarkably sexy Maggie Gyllenhaal.
I:1639;1049;With Ferrell looking defiantly youthful, and Gyllenhaal looking sweet, but haggard, they come out feeling about the same age, and there's some nice dialogue and chemistry between the two.
I:1639;1050;A flesh and blood person finds he's the main character in a book of an eccentric author, and everything the author is writing is coming true in his life.
I:1639;1051;It sounds absurd, but it's a smartly written, brilliantly acted dark comedy that is even better the second time you watch it.
I:1639;1052;key role was perfectly pitched, and Emma Thompson's writer.
I:1639;1053;But the plot sounded interesting enough for me to see it.
I:1639;1054;So much for type casting, for Will Ferrell actually brought his character to life, Harold Crick.
I:1639;1055;An IRS Auditor whose life is numbers.
I:1639;1056;maggie Gyllenhaal does a wonderful job as Ana Pascal, a baker that Harold Crick has to audit.
I:1639;1057;Queen Latifah plays the narrator's very professional assistant Penny Escher, which brings a great dynamic between her and Emma's character.
I:1639;1058;The story is engaging and worth watching.
I:1639;1059;To share more of the plot and the deeper meaning I found in it pertaining to life and literature I feel would ruin the first viewing pleasure of this film.
I:1639;1060;The computer graphics interface that represents how Harold process information actually enhances the viewing pleasure without getting in way of the performance.
I:1639;1061;"It also brought to mind a quote of John Lennon's
I:1639;1062;I will watch this movie filled with rich characters again.
I:1639;1063;great idea but the execution was only so so.
I:1639;1064;: Loved this near perfect and wonderfully executed script, a very lovely crafted conclusion that perfectly illustrates all of the tale's concepts.
I:1639;1065;the original, underlying book being written would have been a masterpiece of literatureif he died, totally flipping the overlying story, making it both a tragedy (the tragedy is the author's masterpiece of literature suffered) and (moreover) a beautiful tale of redemption and a brilliant look atmortality, illustrating BOTH the main character's self.
I:1639;1066;this is what makes the entireblanketed story so beautiful .
I:1639;1067;awareness of the passage of time which ironically is what often obstructs our happiness, further relating to coesistent free.
I:1639;1068;mortality being thebiggest theme in literature, of which the film is simultaneously a wonderful study of in itself.
I:1639;1069;he was very funny and a good choice for the role.
I:1639;1070;just that it was good.
I:1639;1071;This film is very well done!
I:1639;1072;This is the perfect type of role for Ferrell!
I:1639;1073;I was impressed a lot by this movie.
I:1639;1074;You will see a new side of him.
I:1639;1075;a very high 5 stars.
I:1639;1076;I absolutely love this movie.
I:1639;1077;I recommend it to everyone.
I:1639;1078;Emma Thompson gives yet another amazing performance as a shut.
I:1639;1079;I know this sounds bizarre but it is a very witty, hilarious, and charming movie.
I:1639;1080;I watch it over again and again and still laugh.
I:1639;1081;He works as an auditor for the IRS.
I:1639;1082;This one intrigued me, however, so I set aside my prejudices and went to see it.
I:1639;1083;to be honest, I expected a funnier movie.
I:1639;1084;It is funny, and I laughed through most of it.
I:1639;1085;This gives him the boldness to go for some things he's always wanted to do and make some friends.
I:1639;1086;It's a great mix of comedy and drama that kept me entertained for the full two hours.
I:1639;1087;'Stranger than Fiction' is a cracking movie and I thoroughly recommend it.
I:1639;1088;like a good book, it draws you in and is a movie you won't want to put down.
I:1639;1089;Everything is important and worthy of your attention.
I:1639;1090;emma Thompson and Dustin Hoffman are, as always, excellent, while Maggie Gyllenhaal is efforvescent and totally believable as the baker who falls for Will Ferrell's character the IRS agent.
I:1639;1091;But it is Ferrell who is the most outstanding, giving a superb performance.
I:1639;1092;His deadpan delivery is outstanding and his transformation absolutely believable in this great movie.
I:1639;1093;the message of the film 'live for today' may be familiar, but the method of delivery in 'Stranger Than Fiction' is clever, original and very entertaining.
I:1639;1094;although it's a comedy, it's not laugh out loud, but it will make you smile alot and you'll leave the cinema thinking 'that was a good movie'.
I:1639;1095;Just enjoy this as a good story, well told and superbly acted.
I:1639;1096;It was clearly his most serious role, and shows how versatile of an actor Will Ferrell can be.
I:1639;1097;The movie is very moving in terms of its plot.
I:1639;1098;I actually found watching it a second time more enjoyable than the first.
I:1639;1099;i strongly recommend this movie, and hope you appreciate this for the movie it is and not the movie you may have originally perceived it to be.
I:1639;1100;dustin Hoffman makes a great performance as well.
I:1639;1101;I believe this is Maggie Gyllenhaal's first major role (if it isn't, I don't know her other movies), but she did great as well.
I:1639;1102;Her character definitely grows on you.
I:1639;1103;Stranger than Fiction opened the 42nd Annual Chicago International Film Festival.
I:1639;1104;This highly clever literary/cinematic dramady is about a writer of tragedy novels who struggles with how to end her latest.
I:1639;1105;"Well it is
I:1639;1106;As the novel and Harold's life unfolds, Harold finds himself in a literally literary struggle to have a life by saving his life.
I:1639;1107;this film works on so many levels.
I:1639;1108;First, it is a skillful display of the writing process and the importance of knowing your character .
I:1639;1109;The film also displays the often talked about attachment that writers can have to their characters even though that attachment could cloud the creative process necessary to finish the novel.
I:1639;1110;Skillful writers are able to create characters that are so real and believable that killing them is nearly impossible.
I:1639;1111;"Is it the characters that drive a good story or are they subordinate to the story that they serve?Stranger than Fiction is smart, funny, and thought provoking
I:1639;1112;There's as much in it for literary types and there is for film lovers and if you're both, well you're in for an extra special treat.
I:1639;1113;I can usually predict the likelihood of Oscar nominations and awards for films in the festival with a high degree of accuracy.
I:1639;1114;I'm highly recommending this one.
I:1639;1115;It has twists and turns and really makes you think!
I:1639;1116;Will Ferrell, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Dustin Hoffman, Queen Latifah, and Emma Thompson head up this star studded cast.
I:1639;1117;harold Crick (played by Will Ferrell) is a lonely IRS agent whose mundane existence is transformed when he hears a mysterious voice narrating his life.
I:1639;1118;He discovers that he is a main character of a novel in progress.
I:1639;1119;The surface story is interesting, entertaining and has one wondering if Harold will be able to track down the author before the novel concludes.
I:1639;1120;But there is a deeper story here and it is the story of man and his relationship to God.
I:1639;1121;My favorite Will Ferrell movie!
I:1639;1122;I enjoyed this movie unexpectedly.
I:1639;1123;In addition to its compelling story line I was struck by the collision of virtual and real reality that produces the tension that is only resolved at the very end.
I:1639;1124;And the resolution is choosing the real over the virtual and death over life, both for the writer and the character.
I:1639;1125;As our culture recklessly abandons our humanity for the seduction of a virutal world, it is a morality tale of choosing life over fame and money that could never be popular and will always be rewarding.
I:1639;1126;in spite of this weakness, I found the subdued comic portrayals by Mr. Ferrell and Mr. Hoffman to be outstanding and the first 3/4 of the movie showing Mr. Ferrel's character expanding the bounds of his claustrophobic life to be very touching.
I:1639;1127;I was pleasantly surprised at this very well.
I:1639;1128;"Crick was auditing her for the IRS and thoughts about her change his whole ""ordered"" life."
I:1639;1129;emma is also and interesting character.
I:1639;1130;"A chain smoker whose big thing about her books are ""dreaming"" up creative ways for her main characters to die at the end of her books."
I:1639;1131;i found Harold to be the most likeable character of any role that I have seen by Ferrell to date.
I:1639;1132;The performances are overall good, with Gylenhaal and Thompson very effective.
I:1639;1133;teller in a real life thanks to his acquaintance.
I:1639;1134;a fun of her writing, and his life changed dramatically.
I:1639;1135;True enough, STRANGER THAN FICTION is aptly titled.
I:1639;1136;Will Farrell walks through his first dramatic role in zombie.
I:1639;1137;This movie has a lot of interesting things going on about it.
I:1639;1138;"It is literally a movie that admits to it's own defeat, but it does so ""for the greater good"" and I personally think it's terrific for doing so."
I:1639;1139;anyway, philisophical stuff aside, it was a terrific watch.
I:1639;1140;"As a hobbyist film editor I really go for that stuff, however, so I enjoyed seeing a little ""scroll."
I:1639;1141;"It was also a great way to turn a dialogueless boring scene into something interesting (for example, Harold attempts to not move off of the couch, but the ""heads."
I:1639;1142;The subtle elements like this really make the movie, even if it tries to be about something big .
I:1639;1143;Now, he has something to live for, and solving the problem of the voice and its prediction becomes extra important.
I:1639;1144;will Ferrell is great as Harold.
I:1639;1145;He is a likeable everyman.
I:1639;1146;His humor is never over the top, and he handles the drama quite well.
I:1639;1147;He is the glue that holds this movie together, and deserves recognition for the role.
I:1639;1148;The supporting cast is good, never taking away from the focus of the film.
I:1639;1149;The story itself is an interesting idea, but perhaps the ending was a bit of a cop.
I:1639;1150;It did not feel right to me, but that is a small quibble for an otherwise enjoyable film.
I:1639;1151;its great to see Will Ferrell in non.
I:1639;1152;comedy roles, great acting on this one.
I:1639;1153;"awesome flow of the movie overall
I:1639;1154;This film is sharp, creative, and beautifully crafted.
I:1639;1155;It's likable and ultimately a tad sentimental as well.
I:1639;1156;Stranger Than Fiction is funny and sweet, clever and thoughtful.
I:1639;1157;It comments on the writing process in a new way, seeing the creation of character and story from both the writer and character's point of view.
I:1639;1158;Great films need great supporting casts, and Dustin Hoffman, Queen Latifah, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Tony Hale deliver the goods.
I:1639;1159;He is obsessive about visual information and found fantastic locations in Chicago to express Harold's ordered universe.
I:1639;1160;i'm probably one of few people who has never liked Will Ferrell's comic performances.
I:1639;1161;This relatively quiet dramatic role with lots of good humor suits Ferrell perfectly.
I:1639;1162;It's his best role on the big screen yet.
I:1639;1163;For a movie that is as good.
I:1639;1164;"natured as this is, ""Stranger Than Fiction"" is awfully smart."
I:1639;1165;"In ""Building the Team"" (8 min), the cast and creative team talk about director Marc Forster, and he discusses preparing to shoot and visual style."
I:1639;1166;Subtitles are available for the film in English and French.
I:1639;1167;This was such an interesting movie.
I:1639;1168;It's also challenging to watch Will Farrell be so restrained, and yet I now realize what a brilliant acting job he does, because his character IS so restrained.
I:1639;1169;embracing character we've seen him portray time and time again.
I:1639;1170;And when he does decide to try to break from his mold, it's in a quiet way.
I:1639;1171;I'm still taking in this nuanced performance, because it really was lovely.
I:1639;1172;the film itself has many wonderful performances: Emma Thompson is simply brilliant.
I:1639;1173;Queen Latifah is a rock of support, and Maggie Gyllenhaal is gorgeously incandescent.
I:1639;1174;She is the shining light of this piece.
I:1639;1175;the message of how we create our lives and the choices we make was gloriously strong, and my first response upon the film's end was that I wanted to see it again.
I:1639;1176;It's a good movie for a rainy day when you want to think about life and enjoy some milk and cookies.
I:1639;1177;will Ferrell fans will enjoy it, GOOD BLU.
I:1639;1178;This film brilliantly navigated questions about life, death, and the reason we're here.
I:1639;1179;The excellent acting, fresh plotline and witty dialogue (and monologue) made for a wonderful time.
I:1639;1180;There are only a handful of movies that I can watch over and over.
I:1639;1181;And this is one of them, very close to the top of the list.
I:1639;1182;everything works in this film: Will Ferrell's understated acting is in delicious counterpoint to the warmth, and girlish spikishness of Gyllenhaal.
I:1639;1183;The dialogue is quirky and quick so that it still surprises even at the 10th sitting.
I:1639;1184;Unlike many others, it keeps on giving.
I:1639;1185;Thompson creates yet another memorable character.
I:1639;1186;Huffman was excellent as well.
I:1639;1187;And Ferrell, well, it was good.
I:1639;1188;I had no idea what to expect, and it was a nice movie.
I:1639;1189;I am not entirely sure why, but I rather enjoyed the creative and quirky plotline.
I:1639;1190;"with a cast of pretty famous faces, ""Stranger than Fiction"" poses some interesting questions and hyoptheticals to think about."
I:1639;1191;It is a creative and interesting premise that had a lot of potential for exploitation, which I think the movie did rather well.
I:1639;1192;that issue aside, I thought it was a fine movie, and one of Will Ferrell's better ones.
I:1639;1193;Stranger than Fiction is a humorous and endearing movie, and one that I would definitely see again.
I:1639;1194;Top notch cast, no doubt there (Will Ferrell, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Dustin Hoffman, Queen Latifah, and Emma Thompson).
I:1639;1195;If you are thinking about suicide and need to be talked out of it this is the film for you.
I:1639;1196;Ms Gyllenhaal is warm funny, clever and winning in a part which will never be remembered.
I:1639;1197;perhaps fans of Will Ferrell will enjoy this.
I:1639;1198;This is my favorite Will Ferrell movie.
I:1639;1199;Granted, I don't really like his movies, but this one is wonderful.
I:1639;1200;Emma Thompson, Queen Latifah, and Maggie Gyllenhall are a joy to watch.
I:1639;1201;anyway, we thought that the film was clever and enjoyed watching Will Ferrell's turning.
I:1639;1202;point as he took on a more serious, and certainly more endearing, character role.
I:1639;1203;"I remember back when Jim Carrey took on more serious roles while his ""pure."
I:1639;1204;road for Will Ferrell and we thought he did a very good job.
I:1639;1205;"if, some years down the road, Will Ferrell is commonly viewed as a seasoned actor with significant depth and range, then you'll be able to look back at ""Stranger than Fiction"" and recognize that this was indeed his turning point role."
I:1639;1206;It is funny and odd, but it has a lot of heart to it.
I:1639;1207;The writing is so good that my friends and I thought at first that it must be adapted from a larger work, such as a book.
I:1639;1208;The characters are that well crafted and the story that unique.
I:1639;1209;Now, I'm calling this a comedy, but it will pull on your emotions a bit.
I:1639;1210;The acting is great, which is not unexpected given the cast.
I:1639;1211;A really fun film to watch.
I:1639;1212;Now they make great subjects for movies.
I:1639;1213;"Harold seeks help, and gets it from a doctor who actually seems to enjoy his ""condition"" and likens it to a fun experiment."
I:1639;1214;During this entire process, Harold also attains a girlfriend, and moves in with his best friend from work.
I:1639;1215;comedic outings for a known comedy actor.
I:1639;1216;The movie flows quite well, and the lack of violence, sex, nudity and language makes it appropriate for adults and children alike.
I:1639;1217;The ending is somewhat predictable, but nevertheless this is an entertaining movie.
I:1639;1218;Stranger Than Fiction stars Will Ferrell, Dustin Hoffman, Emma Thompson, and Maggie Gyllenhaal, and I thought it was a delightful, refreshing movie.
I:1639;1219;The voice quite accurately narrates everything he is doing and thinking.
I:1639;1220;It is quirkier, and I think ultimately better.
I:1639;1221;It's about the creative process .
I:1639;1222;the author creates a character that is VERY real, and then she is faced with killing this person.
I:1639;1223;I saw a brief interview with the director, and he said he thought the movie was about saving lives .
I:1639;1224;how people save each other's lives every day by doing little things that open up their worlds and encourage people to really live.
I:1639;1225;it was an interesting, entertaining, superbly.
I:1639;1226;cast film, and I encourage you to see it as soon as possible.
I:1639;1227;Performances are wonderful, the script is fresh, and the ideology of it all gives your brain something to chew on for a few days.
I:1639;1228;rated PG 13, this would be a great family movie.
I:1639;1229;It's either clever or a cop out.
I:1639;1230;I had limited expectations for a Will Ferrell movie but STF was well done.
I:1639;1231;As he performs his daily menial tasks he begins hearing narration of his own life.
I:1639;1232;will Ferrell's interactions with his fellow castmates is right on and all of the performances are believable and revealing.
I:1639;1233;It's amazing to see the correlation between film and writing and the depth of study into literature and writers is excellent.
I:1639;1234;This film shows an appealing humanity and smart humor that everyone will enjoy.
I:1639;1235;"concept scenario
I:1639;1236;The tone of each acting performance is sublime.
I:1639;1237;He proves his acting chops and shows his amazing intelligence to imbue a character with pathos.
I:1639;1238;"And if ""greatness"" required you to write a good person out of your story, would you?Emma Thompson's character, Kay Eiffel, is extraordinarily talented and has always been able to write beautiful tragic novels."
I:1639;1239;But even when they know their ending will likely be tragic, they do what they can do, and they bring assorted flours to people who can create, can bake, are talented, and have the ability to change the world.
I:1639;1240;"roger Ebert wrote an excellent review, as always, of this movie (3.5 stars), titled ""Who's telling your life story?"""
I:1639;1241;I respect that as Roger Ebert has battled serious, life.
I:1639;1242;He cares about movies, ideas, and thoughtful criticism.
I:1639;1243;He puts his time and heart where his long term, universal focuses are.
I:1639;1244;"He says that ""Such an uncommonly intelligent film does not often get made."
I:1639;1245;Stranger Than Fiction (2006) fits into the tiny sub.
I:1639;1246;"Although I can see why some people compare it to ""The Hours"" (2002) it is really a variation on ""Adaptation"" (2002) and its various allegorical elements."
I:1639;1247;"as in ""Adaptation"" you have a stalled character going to a literary professional for advice."
I:1639;1248;time best film romances and it owes a lot Director Marc Forster's casting of these two actors.
I:1639;1249;Both Kay and Jules nicely display the dichotomy between the passion of their creativity and the reserve of their analysis and critique.
I:1639;1250;once he knows his fate Harold begins making positive changes in his life style, which culminates in his romance with Ana.
I:1639;1251;But it is all in the service of character development.
I:1639;1252;This movie made me a Will Ferrell fan for life.
I:1639;1253;The rest of the cast is great, too.
I:1639;1254;Just so unique, and so well done.
I:1639;1255;I bought it, and watch it quite often.
I:1639;1256;I loved the quirky characters who found love.
I:1639;1257;Painful and funny as he went on his journey.
I:1639;1258;This has to be my favorite movie this decade!
I:1639;1259;In my opinion, this has to be Will Ferrell's best.
I:1639;1260;I began to identify with the writer, because I'm also a writer.
I:1639;1261;I'm not sure how I would handle such an occurrence, but I recommend you watch and make up your own mind.
I:1639;1262;for myself AND the for people I love who love a great flick.
I:1639;1263;OH, The Folly of Making Assumptions!
I:1639;1264;"And: romance tip for the guys from ""STF"": Bring your lady some flours."
I:1639;1265;And this concludes my very sage and always excellent advice to you 'less blessed' souls.
I:1639;1266;I received as ordered in the condition as ordered and all is well.
I:1639;1267;I really love this movie.
I:1639;1268;I am not a huge Will Ferrel fan, but this movie is so great.
I:1639;1269;I feel like a lot of movies are being released without inserts lately.
I:1639;1270;This movie carries an exceptional script and a very strong cast.
I:1639;1271;Will Farrel is a pleasant surprise as he actually can act.
I:1639;1272;It has a quirky theme and with a slight suspension of disbelief you can really get into the story.
I:1639;1273;With the help of a professor of literature, who is deemed to be more helpful than his psychiatrist, Harold is able to solve the mystery of the voice's origin.
I:1639;1274;clown nature to be more adaptable to a wide range of film.
I:1639;1275;He was very likeable in this role, but I would not say that he was great.
I:1639;1276;I just don't think the part was that strong, but he did well enough in it.
I:1639;1277;emma Thompson was excellent in her neurosis as she was deconstructed by her writer's block.
I:1639;1278;maggie Gyllenhaal has been a tough nut to crack for me.
I:1639;1279;In the few performances of hers that I have seen, she has seemingly played the same character over and over.
I:1639;1280;Because of that, or whatever else, Maggie was at her most charming in Stranger Than Fiction.
I:1639;1281;with all of these performances from a cast of notable names, the highlight was Dustin Hoffman.
I:1639;1282;He was funny, intelligent, mysterious, compassionate, quirky.
I:1639;1283;The movie probably didn't need these effects, but I loved them.
I:1639;1284;They were an added emphasis on the attention to detail which I appreciate so much.
I:1639;1285;i am not sure if it was in any way related to my expecting so little from this movie, but I really loved Stranger Than Fiction.
I:1639;1286;The story was incredibly creative and everyone who contributed, both cast and crew, made it an enjoyable movie to watch.
I:1639;1287;I have already been recommending this movie to others and now I recommend it to you.
I:1639;1288;I really really enjoyed this movie.
I:1639;1289;But Ferrell's Harold Krick shows a level of intelligence and maturity you'd never expect him to have.
I:1639;1290;A real, sympathetic, and still serious role.
I:1639;1291;He discovers he's a character in a novel, one which will eventually kill him.
I:1639;1292;Added into the mix are a delightful Dustin Hoffman, and a less delightful Maggie Gyllenhaal.
I:1639;1293;All still put on a tremendous effort.
I:1639;1294;I also enjoyed the continual phantom numbers and calculations, interesting touch.
I:1639;1295;This is the ONLY movie of his I have been able to watch all the way through.
I:1639;1296;He is perfect for the part.
I:1639;1297;A fun movie to watch.
I:1639;1298;This is one of my favorite movies.
I:1639;1299;And the characters are beyond great.
I:1639;1300;Will Ferrell's understated performance (SO unlike most of his stuff!)
I:1639;1301;An emotional thriller, a comedy, a drama, a rollercoaster .
I:1639;1302;Good shipping time and great packing.
I:1639;1303;My wife recommend me this movie and I decide to give it the chance so I bought it and simply give an amazing surprise.
I:1639;1304;This clever and well made film is about a man, IRS agent Harold Crick, living a life of Thoreauian desperation who turns out to be a character in a novel.
I:1639;1305;Some of themes pursued are the nature of art and free will versus determinism.
I:1639;1306;This is generally done well, though the film is a bit too much of a conventional romantic comedy.
I:1639;1307;Most of the other performances are good and Emma Thompson, as usual, brings surprising depth to her role.
I:1639;1308;A true gem of a movie throughout.
I:1639;1309;This is story of ordinary man who becomes involved in an extraordinary tale.
I:1639;1310;But one day starts hearing the voice of a women with an British accent narrating his life.
I:1639;1311;After seeking some help from a psychologist and eventually a literature professor, Jules Hilbert, played by the ever brilliant Dustin Hoffman, he begins to explore a life he only dreamed of living.
I:1639;1312;And as with all the best stories there is a love story at the epicentre of this tale.
I:1639;1313;Because he actually begins to care about his life.
I:1639;1314;He enjoys is now because he is living his dreams.
I:1639;1315;And he is having an adventure.
I:1639;1316;some of the best moments in this film is when Professor Hilbert instructs him to determine certain outcomes.
I:1639;1317;there is moments of madness, moments of laughter, and moments of angst coupled with beautiful cinematography in this film.
I:1639;1318;anyway this is a film that stretches the imagination just a little bit.
I:1639;1319;After all you are going to live the rest of your life in the future.
I:1639;1320;If you could choose to die a magnificent death, saving someone's life, and being remembered forever, would you do it?If you liked Punch Drunk Love, you'll love Stranger Than Fiction.
I:1639;1321;It's the best movie since Shawshank Redemption, hands down.
I:1639;1322;"Visually compelling and brilliantly acted by Will Farrell, Emma Thompson, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Dustin Hoffman, STF takes a quirky, ""insider"" look at the connection between fate and free will."
I:1639;1323;It's a great movie that addresses a very serious subject matter in a creative, light.
I:1639;1324;Stranger Than Fiction was a wonderful movie, plain and simple.
I:1639;1325;The writing is smart, direction crisp, and the acting is fantastic.
I:1639;1326;Inspired acting all around from Farrell to Maggie Gyllenhaal (who is just utterly wonderful) to Thompson (especially Emma Thompson, who everyone knows is a fantastic actor but it is truly evident why that is a fact here in this movie) to Queen Latifah to Dustin Hoffman!
I:1639;1327;Just wonderful all around and a great, impressive movie.
I:1639;1328;now, I found the story even more interesting because I am a writer.
I:1639;1329;It's funny, romantic (in a very real and strange way .
I:1639;1330;no canned romantic lines but a very real feeling interaction between two very real characters), touching, visually interesting, a little fantastical, and all around perfect.
I:1639;1331;i really liked this movie a lot.
I:1639;1332;The 2nd best film of 2006.
I:1639;1333;Will Ferrell is great in this fun but not funny role.
I:1639;1334;Will Ferrell has been to my taste one of the most talented comedians ever to appear on SNL, and I had looked forward to him acting in movies.
I:1639;1335;"I'm still SURE he can act and can be funny as heck, but almost all the roles he's been taking so far don't do justice to his talents, perhaps with arguable exception of ""Elf"" and ""Anchorman."
I:1639;1336;Will, you can do MUCH better than that.
I:1639;1337;"Finally, there is a movie that came a little closer to showing Will Ferrell's comic potential: ""Blades of Glory."""
I:1639;1338;It's a nice crazy comedy.
I:1639;1339;I really loved this movie.
I:1639;1340;Each of the actors gave a phenomenal performance and the plot was wonderful.
I:1639;1341;I don't have a Sony, I actually have a fairly new Sanyo (gasp!)
I:1639;1342;The movie itself was excellent.
I:1639;1343;It was nice to see Will Ferrell get a little more serious (I still love silly Will Ferrell) and he did a fine job in this movie.
I:1639;1344;Of course in my opinion, anything that Maggie Gyllenhal is in is great.
I:1639;1345;On one hand, the movie is the best I have seen in several years.
I:1639;1346;It is original, clever, and engaging.
I:1639;1347;I loved it in the theater only.
I:1639;1348;The premise of this movie is so unique and all of the acting is terrific.
I:1639;1349;Will Ferrell does a tremendous job playing more the straight man this time rather than his typical over.
I:1639;1350;Well written, well acted, unique story.
I:1639;1351;It's now one of my top 25 favorite movies of all time.
I:1639;1352;I adore this movie, the characters are believeable( and lovable) , the writing is great and it left me with a fuzzy feeling.
I:1639;1353;Probably one of the ultimate dreams is having their worlds come to life.
I:1639;1354;Stranger than Fiction, carries on that theme.
I:1639;1355;person omniscient, Crick may well be the character in a novel and the narrator he's hearing is a novelist.
I:1639;1356;the result is a funny, very revealing look at writers and the way they write and think.
I:1639;1357;This movie took a bit for me to warm up to.
I:1639;1358;marc Forster, who directed Johnny Depp to an Oscar nomination in 'Finding Neverland', clearly works well with actors.
I:1639;1359;Thompson, Ferrell, Maggie Gyllenhaal (excellent as Ferrell's girlfriend), Dustin Hoffman (Ferrell' mentor), and Queen Lativah all give great performances (even Tom Hulce and Linda Hunt have effective cameos).
I:1639;1360;'Stranger than Fiction is truly one of the best films of 2006.
I:1639;1361;Maybe those viewers need to watch this marvelous film a second time.
I:1639;1362;those of you who are familiar with Ferrell's work knows he tends to chew the scenery most of the time.
I:1639;1363;for those who didn't like STF, you may want to give it a second chance and allow it to grow on you.
I:1639;1364;hey, didn't 'Eternal' win for best screenplay).
I:1639;1365;It will give you something to think about at the office the next day.
I:1639;1366;as it is, the plot and audience is saved from a pointless chase piece that would result as people chase a magic object and presented with a brilliant film that is both reaffirming and enjoyable.
I:1639;1367;"I love this movie
I:1639;1368;"***1/2Like many a successful comic before him, Will Ferrell goes for his own ""Truman Show""."
I:1639;1369;Blissfully unaware that the character she has created has actually taken form as a flesh.
I:1639;1370;"bending movies as ""Groundhog Day,"" ""Being John Malkovich,"" ""Adaptation"" and ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" among others, ""Stranger Than Fiction"" earns points for pushing the envelope in terms of storytelling, but its themes ."
I:1639;1371;of a man finding meaning in his humdrum existence and of an author realizing that preserving real life is more important than preserving art .
I:1639;1372;edge and innovative than its post.
I:1639;1373;There are some very sharp and amusing moments in the film, but often we feel as if the movie's creators found themselves at a loss as to what to do with the clever idea once they came up with it.
I:1639;1374;"nevertheless, ""Stranger Than Fiction"" is worth seeing for the low."
I:1639;1375;keyed performance by Farrell who never steps out of character as the socially backward but essentially warmhearted schnook Eiffel has invented for her printed page.
I:1639;1376;Their scenes together are genuinely well.
I:1639;1377;lip British accent and crisp enunciation, Thompson is perfect as the frazzled narrator and author desperate to break through her writer's block and bring closure to her literary creation.
I:1639;1378;Queen Latifah effectively underplays the role of the rational assistant sent to help Eiffel find a way to kill off her character, while Hoffman, in a wonderfully playful mood, gets to deliver most of the screenplay's funniest lines.
I:1639;1379;It is at this moment that Eiffel learns the true burden of being God .
I:1639;1380;god that artists automatically become through the nature of their work.
I:1639;1381;This film just gets better and better.
I:1639;1382;It has amazing script and superlative acting and the GUI graphics that accompany the on screen action add an intriguing level of humor and meaning.
I:1639;1383;Add to to these two amazing performances those of Maggie Gyllenhaal's role as the free.
I:1639;1384;spirit baker, Dustin Hoffman as the eccentric professor, and Queen Latifah as the editorial assistant, for acting that will knock your socks off.
I:1639;1385;The film, which operates on many levels, is funny, poignant, clever, witty, provocative and over.
I:1639;1386;Both my husband (whose taste in movies does not always coincide with mine) and I thoroughly enjoyed this film.
I:1639;1387;"Stranger Than Fiction has an interesting premise
I:1639;1388;Its an everyman role, but Farrell adds subtle nuances that make the character real.
I:1639;1389;Maggie Gyllenhaal is excellent as the spunky Ana Pascal.
I:1639;1390;Her chemistry with Farrell makes their romantic entanglements believable.
I:1639;1391;Emma Thompson as the writer Karen Eiffel, does an impeccable job of playing the eccentric and tortured artist.
I:1639;1392;Of course the film has plenty of great supporting actors like Dustin Hoffman, Queen Latifah, Tom Hulce, Linda Hunt, and Tony Hale in a great part as Harold's nerdy friend Dave.
I:1639;1393;the script is well written and thought out.
I:1639;1394;The direction works very well.
I:1639;1395;Pacing was a little slow, but I think I was deceived by the commercials that give the impression that this is a hilarious comedy.
I:1639;1396;Parts of it are funny, but the movie is more of a drama, and Farrell's acting skills suit both parts well.
I:1639;1397;The score and soundtrack are also memorable and fit the movie like a glove.
I:1639;1398;all in all, I was completely entertained by the movie.
I:1639;1399;It proves that Farrell can jump into more dramatic roles (if he cares to).
I:1639;1400;For those looking for a solid nights entertainment with a great cast and a unique script, here is the movie to watch.
I:1639;1401;Well that and all the other reviews that said how wonderful it was.
I:1639;1402;I really enjoyed this movie.
I:1639;1403;It was intelligent, witty, and a moving story about the meaning of life.
I:1639;1404;"And then, without any warning, he comes to hear the words of a narrator, one who describes his life as he knows it (""but with a better vocabulary"", he tells a sympathetic psychiatrist)."
I:1639;1405;"WHAT WE THOUGHT: ""Stranger than Fiction"" is a beguiling work, which is the polite way of saying that we had no idea whether to like it or not."
I:1639;1406;Hilbert is a fun character, though the script makes him uninteresting for a big chunk of it, though giving him some of the weightiest and profound observations by the end.
I:1639;1407;The script wisely goes further than you'd expect for a Hollywood movie .
I:1639;1408;"These things do happen, but ""Stranger than Fiction"" is smarter than that, becoming a meditation on why writers narrow stories down to either tragic or comic, and the ends that they will go to stay within those bounds."
I:1639;1409;The major flaw of the story is that the concept (man learns he's a doomed fictitious character, and responds) is funnier and more engaging in the flick's first half.
I:1639;1410;Even when the story loses its steam, we still have great characters and great actors living them.
I:1639;1411;Gyllenhaal is great as Ana, compulsively combative as much as lovable.
I:1639;1412;Will Ferrell is also a revelation as Crick .
I:1639;1413;it's a world away from his other manic characters, and Ferrell inhabits him perfectly.
I:1639;1414;This was one of the most original and creative screenplays I have seen in a very long time, yet it is really just an updated Greek Tragedy.
I:1639;1415;This is a morality play where Ferrell shows character and integrity and eventually heroism.
I:1639;1416;this is an excellent film.
I:1639;1417;funny scenes but it isn't a comedy but then is the death of a true hero a tragedy?
I:1639;1418;I think this was a very good film and I recommend it highly.
I:1639;1419;I also LOVED Queen Latifah and the rest of this cast.
I:1639;1420;But, honestly, who amazes me the most with her incredibly inspired performance is Maggie Gyllenhaal!
I:1639;1421;She is priceless in this role I can't take my eyes off her when she is on screen.
I:1639;1422;She is the glue that made this film work as well as it did!
I:1639;1423;in his first dramatic role (of sorts) Will Ferrell turns in an incredibly believable performance as the main character.
I:1639;1424;I was so thoroughly entertained by this film that as soon as it was over, I started it again and watched it one more time.
I:1639;1425;Brilliant script, superior ensemble cast, great direction and eye candy to watch because it is filmed with such great attention to detail.
I:1639;1426;Probably one of the best films of 2006 and an instant addition to my own library at home!
I:1639;1427;This is one film you must see.
I:1639;1428;Love this movie and every time I watch it and he brings her flours I end up in tears.
I:1639;1429;Great cast, interesting story line, funny, heartwarming and at times heartbreaking.
I:1639;1430;I had heard nothing about this film, but the cast looked good so I watched it and was pleasantly surprised by my good fortune.
I:1639;1431;This film has many clever twists and turns as Will Ferrell tries to discover the identity of a voice that he hears while brushing his teeth or going through all the normal routines of his life.
I:1639;1432;in an inspired bit of casting, Will goes to the office of Dustin Hoffman, a college professor who is an expert on literature.
I:1639;1433;Hoffman is obviously having a great time playing this role.
I:1639;1434;"I was delighted with his ""over the top"" performance."
I:1639;1435;Hoffman's insights help Ferrell discover the famous author who is writing his story, Emma Thompson, also well cast in a role that allows her to showcase her many acting talents.
I:1639;1436;hoffman thinks her book is a masterpiece.
I:1639;1437;this movie is fanciful, creative, intelligent, well.
I:1639;1438;acted, and just plain good fun often enough for me to be able to recommend it to anyone looking for something a bit off the beaten track.
I:1639;1439;That it is at times thought provoking is an added and unexpected bonus.
I:1639;1440;I was right to want to see it, I found it to be amazing.
I:1639;1441;the story being narrated sounded like a really good story and the way the character tries to find out what kind of a story he is in is funny and interesting.
I:1639;1442;I recognize myself in her as well as other writers I have known.
I:1639;1443;the most amazing part is the idea that her character is a real person, existing in the same world that she does.
I:1639;1444;If you have not written fiction then I can probably never explain to you the feeling that the characters you are writing about are real people.
I:1639;1445;They come to me almost fully formed, asking me to tell their story, to share their story with others.
I:1639;1446;I often feel on the very edge of sanity as these imaginary people speak to me and share their lives with me.
I:1639;1447;Even if they do not exist in the same sense that you and I do, they are still real.
I:1639;1448;it also explores the interesting idea of what price artistic integrity might come at.
I:1639;1449;This film is funny, clever and at times quite dramatic.
I:1639;1450;it's a major shift for Will's goofy on.
I:1639;1451;screen image!His true acting abilities shine through in this film and you can't help but to get entrapped in his character's story.
I:1639;1452;most comedic actors eventually feel like taking on a more serious role.
I:1639;1453;adam Sandler was outstanding in 'Punch Drunk Love'.
I:1639;1454;and now Will Ferrel can also be added to the list of actors who are capable of more than just making you laugh.
I:1639;1455;"Most peple will see Will Ferrell on the front and think ""oh great, another comedy."""
I:1639;1456;But it's more than that .
I:1639;1457;it's an incredible story about one man's hardship through knowing the inevitable.
I:1639;1458;I don't want to give away the story, so I will just say that I do recommend this movie, both for Will Ferrell fans, and those who love a good story.
I:1639;1459;This film was one i have anticipated for a long time.
I:1639;1460;I could go on, but i will spare you.
I:1639;1461;"The director's past films include ""Stay"", one of my recent favorites."
I:1639;1462;As a romantic comedy, the film succeeds to the degree the viewer finds Harold Crick's life story as interesting as Will Farrell's persona.
I:1639;1463;"off to make his mundane existence (now spiced up by his slightly wild and tattooed but sweet, newfound love) seem exceedingly preferable to the extermination of the artist and her pretentious fictional ""masterpieces."""
I:1639;1464;until she shows up at the end of the film cleaned.
I:1639;1465;"Simply this: ""you're lucky to be alive."""
I:1639;1466;"As far as movies go, this one is to literature what ""Patch Adams"" was to medicine."
I:1639;1467;i laughed (a little) and rooted for Will Ferrell to get the girl.
I:1639;1468;On this day, in this cinematic wasteland, it'll do.
I:1639;1469;"Think of it as a witty chaser to the craziness of ""Borat."
I:1639;1470;Director Marc Forster cleverly illustrates Harold's fixation with helpful white graphics that flash before the screen.
I:1639;1471;He is eventually directed to literature professor Jules Hilbert, played by Dustin Hoffman, who agrees to help.
I:1639;1472;all of her main characters die .
I:1639;1473;but she has writer's block.
I:1639;1474;She can't think of a way to kill Harold.
I:1639;1475;is it possible to enjoy a movie while mentally eviscerating its logic?
I:1639;1476;Stranger Than Fiction makes about as much sense as a 4.
I:1639;1477;"Put simply, Kaufman's better at it
I:1639;1478;key and funny, and he surprisingly generates chemistry with Gyllenhaal, who is asked to make a speech about cookies sound sexy.
I:1639;1479;Forster gives Hoffman some freedom to make an eccentric character.
I:1639;1480;It goes there, there's a false climax then a real one, and then it arrives the kind of charity and goodness that is totally inexplicable, yet warm and gooey.
I:1639;1481;Stranger Than Fiction has a sharp visual polish and keeps slipping asides in its narrative to keep the jokes fresh.
I:1639;1482;it's a professional effort .
I:1639;1483;It has romance, comedy, shades of Shakespearean tragedy and still a feel good ending.
I:1639;1484;I like Will Ferrell and I love Maggie Gyllenhaal.
I:1639;1485;Story is good too and interesting.
I:1639;1486;Absolutely great movie, now on my list of favorites.
I:1639;1487;If you haven't seen this movie, take a chance.
I:1639;1488;Such amazing actors and amazing plot.
I:1639;1489;Fun for people who love reading or literature, or people who love math.
I:1639;1490;Interesting combining of the two themes.
I:1639;1491;Funny funny movie, but also has deep moments at the same time.
I:1639;1492;"Anyone will like it
I:1639;1493;In all ways, this is a good thing.
I:1639;1494;For those who aren't Will Ferrell fans, you'll be pleased to know that this tale is intelligently crafted and well thought out.
I:1639;1495;It isn't an action fest, so if you're looking for such a flick, your time is better spent elsewhere, but it is a touching movie of humanity and courage.
I:1639;1496;as the title says, I can't really elaborate more than what's already been posted, but I'm hoping that this review will help those searching for a movie with an emotional impact, that leads to meaningful introspection, in a way that few contemporary movies do.
I:1639;1497;then I watched it a second time (with popcorn, beer, and a hot dog) and had fun, I laughed a lot/teared up a little, and thought how great the experience, craftmanship of these movie makers is.
I:1639;1498;Harold Crick has actually come to life in modern times, actually meets his author and attempts to change his fate and then comes to accept it as the only way.
I:1639;1499;it's a lot of fun seeing the character changing before the viewer's eyes.
I:1639;1500;philosophically, we can look at the tale as a disregard for fate, that we are not predestined to lead a certain path but can choose our own paths.
I:1639;1501;ferrell, with Maggie Gyllenhaal (she's great as the romantic lead, Ana, and you've seen her in:The Dark Knight (Two.
I:1639;1502;the humor is there, dark at times, and a bit of toilet humor (it is 2006 after all) make for an entertaining picture that you really must see.
I:1639;1503;i really liked the music as well .
I:1639;1504;This is by far his best movie and along with a great cast Will is able to shine in a role that is unlike anything else he has done.
I:1639;1505;Maggie is also great in her role.
I:1639;1506;Yea, we still laughed but we were also moved.
I:1639;1507;and then one day, Harold starts hearing a voice in his head, narrating his life.
I:1639;1508;Their most charming scene involves Ana introducing Harold to his first home.
I:1639;1509;baked cookies, and Ferrell is quite surprising.
I:1639;1510;What comedy there is in this movie is quiet, calm, and heart.
I:1639;1511;Stranger than Fiction is far from a laugh.
I:1639;1512;loud comedy, but it has its comic moments.
I:1639;1513;It's funny at times, serious at others and really makes you think about how you impact another's life.
I:1639;1514;If you enjoy Will Ferrell, then watch this movie.
I:1639;1515;Movies such as this will out do any modern work, the story is solid and everything finds itself full circle.
I:1639;1516;It's a smart comedy that has a main story and a side note.
I:1639;1517;Watch it with others, or alone.
I:1639;1518;It's great no matter the setting.
I:1639;1519;Whar a marvelous little movie!
I:1639;1520;It's literate and thoughtful: a dangerous cobination for Hollywood box office returns.
I:1639;1521;emma Thompson looks absolutely awful.
I:1639;1522;I loved the scenes between Dustin Hoffman and Farrell.
I:1639;1523;Instead of playing a ridiculous buffoon through a series of cheap jokes, Ferrell is part of an intelligent, emotionally engaging film this time.
I:1639;1524;Crick is very good at his job, which is a good thing, because that's nearly all he does.
I:1639;1525;Hilbert is very reminiscent of his role as the existential detective in I Heart Huckabees.)
I:1639;1526;I won't ruin the ending, but I'll just say it's satisfying, if not perfect.
I:1639;1527;the script for this movie is fantastic, repeatedly flowing in directions that evade the audience's expectations.
I:1639;1528;The entire cast puts in excellent performances.
I:1639;1529;I, who am not a fan of Ferrell's usual style, was very pleasantly surprised by his genuine talent.
I:1639;1530;Some people found the occasional CGI animations overlaid on the action distracting, but I thought they illustrated Crick's precise thought processes well.
I:1639;1531;this is a great example of something we see far too rarely today: an intelligent, well.
I:1639;1532;If you're tired of watching Carrey, Stiller and Ferrell make fools of themselves in films like Zoolander or Dumb and Dumber, this is the perfect comedy for you.
I:1639;1533;A full life he's never ever been able to create himself?
I:1639;1534;It is in this revelation, that he finally learns to become a man, face his fears, and remove the boundaries that have always surrounded him.
I:1639;1535;In doing so, Maggie Gyllenhal's rebellious, tax evading character, with a fair share of tattoos, enters the picture.
I:1639;1536;The unlikely relationship that evolves between them is, simply adorable.
I:1639;1537;You'll have a very enjoyable time finding out.
I:1639;1538;By the end of the film, you are so drawn in, you are willing to accept Harold's fate.
I:1639;1539;The good, or the bad of it, this is the first taste of real life Harold Crick has ever experienced.
I:1639;1540;emma Thompson's character, as the author with writer's block, is brilliant.
I:1639;1541;this is simply a lovely film, one that we talked about at dinner the next evening, because it left a significant imprint.
I:1639;1542;In the beginning, it seems rather silly, but it is like a fine wine.
I:1639;1543;let it breath a little, to come to life.
I:1639;1544;is that the writer herself lives in the same world as her creation.
I:1639;1545;The storyline is genius they way it is set up.
I:1639;1546;"Will Ferrell delivers one of his best performances with this movie
I:1639;1547;This movie will keep you interested until the end.
I:1639;1548;Although the conclusion becomes somewhat predictable the journey to that resolution is nothing short of humorous and thought.
I:1639;1549;the plot of this film is unique.
I:1639;1550;To observe the twists and witticisms along the way is worth the watch.
I:1639;1551;She was very well developed but not really used to her potential.
I:1639;1552;That said, the stellar cast surrounding Ferrell mellowed his usual take on comedy, elevating it to rather smart repart e on all counts.
I:1639;1553;The film moves quickly, pacing consistently throughout, it ending no less a sudden powerful impact.
I:1639;1554;I liked it so much that I bought the soundtrack.
I:1639;1555;I absolutely love this movie.
I:1639;1556;Let me start with the good, nay, GREAT: Maggie Gyllanhaal is a true delight for we independent women to behold.
I:1639;1557;How great is it to see a college drop.
I:1639;1558;She has some sort of beef with the government of the United States and as much as I'd love to devour everything she bakes, I'd personally kick her hiney to any other cruddier country and let her commit crimes there!
I:1639;1559;This is a movie about Harold Crick who is played by the hilarious Will Ferrell.
I:1639;1560;Harold is good at many things.
I:1639;1561;He excels at his job.
I:1639;1562;He's a whiz with numbers.
I:1639;1563;"The voice is right about a great many things, and so when it says ""little did he know that events had been sent in motion that would lead to his imminent death"", Harold has reason to take it rather seriously."
I:1639;1564;this movie is more intelligent than what we usually get from the studios.
I:1639;1565;Stranger than Fiction is a wonderful cinematic experience.
I:1639;1566;will Ferrel is amazingly appealing in this.
I:1639;1567;It charms and surprises, is inventive and logical, never feels impossible or implausible, and is engaging from start to finish.
I:1639;1568;I love the idea behind this story.
I:1639;1569;It's one of my favorites.
I:1639;1570;Ferrell's comedic presence is brilliant for a few minutes, and that's why he was so good on SNL.
I:1639;1571;in 'Stranger Than Fiction', Ferrell breaks out of his normal role and turns out a wonderful performance.
I:1639;1572;He is convincing in his role of an average Joe Nobody and genuinely becomes a character you want to root for.
I:1639;1573;The storyline is creative and original.
I:1639;1574;Overall a very good film.
I:1639;1575;harold Crick (Will Ferrell) is an IRS agent who is a genius at math.
I:1639;1576;He has a wristwatch that he depends on everything for.
I:1639;1577;it turns out the voice is real.
I:1639;1578;She is writing a new novel about an IRS agent named Harold Crick who is very good with numbers.
I:1639;1579;Oh yeah, and she wanted to kill off Harold in the book at the end.
I:1639;1580;stranger Than Fiction is by far one of the best films of 2006, and I think Will Ferrell's best film yet.
I:1639;1581;The acting is phenomenal: Will Ferrell is in his best role EVER.
I:1639;1582;Emma Thompson is spectacular and soars above many of her other roles in her incredibly realistic portrayal of an author with writer's block.
I:1639;1583;Maggie Gyllenhaal and legend Dustin Hoffman do a fantastic job as well.
I:1639;1584;stranger Than Fiction has one of the most unique stories I've ever seen, if not THE most unique.
I:1639;1585;Hell, this is one of the most original screenplays I've ever had the pleasure of watching.
I:1639;1586;it might be a little abstract for some, but there's a great message behind this film so you should def.
I:1639;1587;I loved every actor's performance.
I:1639;1588;I loved the movie and totally expected the hero to die, as expected.
I:1639;1589;The boffo ending had me smiling and looking for some kleenex.You can see what the film is about in the other reviews, and IMO, it really has more heart than The Truman Show.
I:1639;1590;Go ahead and enjoy it, though you'll need milk and cookies.
I:1639;1591;I have always enjoyed his films, but this role seemed to be a little too serious for him.
I:1639;1592;He played the character of Harold Crick well.
I:1639;1593;The film was very intelligent and had me laughing out loud many times.
I:1639;1594;It also left me with a very happy feeling afterward, and I felt like I had learned something from watching the film, which to me is very important.
I:1639;1595;this is a strange film in that like most comedy.
I:1639;1596;One of my favorite scenes in the film is Ferrell's coversation on the bus with the woman he is auditing, Gyllenhaal.
I:1639;1597;The camera angles enhanced the awkwardness both characters were feeling at that moment.
I:1639;1598;Of course, the solid acting by Ferrell and Gyllenhaal make that scene as good as it is.
I:1639;1599;ferrell is terrific in this very subdued role and it clearly shows that he does have some acting chops when given the right material.
I:1639;1600;"While this isn't necessarily a ""dramatic"" role, it is a great departure for him from his farsical side."
I:1639;1601;I am no fan of Maggie Gyllenhaal and have found most of her prior performances to be mediocore at best, but she gives a very winning performance here.
I:1639;1602;I found myself liking both her character and her as an actress in this film.
I:1639;1603;She brings an air of eloquence that you would have expected Thompson to bring, but one can't help but wonder what sparked her interest to be in this film and in such a minor role.
I:1639;1604;He still adds his trademark quirkiness wherever he can and that benefits this film as many of the characters are quiet and or dark in some manner.
I:1639;1605;in the nutshell, this was a very interesting and satisfying film that I think most, when they give it a chance, will enjoy.
I:1639;1606;"It is not a ""mainstream"" film and the actors are not acting in a way that most of us are used to seeing them, but that is the joy of this film."
I:1639;1607;i'm truly saddened by the reviews that think this is film is funny in the face of humans across the world trying to understand each other and to get along without annihilating one another.
I:1639;1608;thankfully becomes, in the hands of a great cast and skilful crew, something more.
I:1639;1609;"style weirdness or complexity the premise deserves, nor the intellectual savvy of an ""I Heart Huckabees"", but as a tilt at the themes of mortality and meaning it's a worthy, if slightly too cutesy, piece."
I:1639;1610;a voice that is narrating his every move in life.
I:1639;1611;Meanwhile, Eiffel comes to grips with the fact that her latest novel is actually deciding the fate of a living, breathing human being .
I:1639;1612;jerker or a ray of sunshine, but rest assured that either way, it results in a delightful story.
I:1639;1613;the real star here was Zach Helm (the writer) who put together a truly charming screenplay that, although quirky, was very touching without being sappy.
I:1639;1614;And, Maggie Gyllenhaal, who delivers a very nice performance as a counter.
I:1639;1615;Because I grew up in a counter.
I:1639;1616;culture folks and Gyllenhaal plays the role of earthy, politically outspoken, counter.
I:1639;1617;surprisingly, Hoffman and Thompson play lesser roles in this film, and I found myself somewhat surprised that Hoffman in particular actually agreed to such a small part.
I:1639;1618;But I think that is testimony to the extraordinary strength of Helm's screenplay.
I:1639;1619;it was a delightful, satisfying way to spend a couple hours.
I:1639;1620;I found it wholesome and redeeming as Crick is truly a good.
I:1639;1621;He's hearing a voice that narrates his every move.
I:1639;1622;He really is one of the most likeable characters I've seen in a while.
I:1639;1623;Will Ferrell surprised me with his ability to evoke sadness and was better than I expected.
I:1639;1624;She looked terrible but her voice is very pleasant as the narrator.
I:1639;1625;overall, a well crafted story.
I:1639;1626;Either way, it's a movie that makes you feel good.
I:1639;1627;It starts out slow but I came to appreciate the director's attention to wonderfully placed details and a pacing that leads the viewer to a rising tempo and a super finale.
I:1639;1628;"The selfless courage of the doomed man and the strength and determination of the distraught woman
I:1639;1629;Hoffman's recent efforts usually are lame and cliche, but he's quite good in this role.
I:1639;1630;This is Ferrell's best work (period and no debate) and Emma Thompson, a favorite of mine, is fantastic.
I:1639;1631;This is one you need to own.
I:1639;1632;It has its funny points.
I:1639;1633;I like the scenes with Maggie Gyllenhaal in it.
I:1639;1634;I think her acting was great.
I:1639;1635;She looked really nice in Junior.
I:1639;1636;The most original movie of 2006, possibly the best movie, too!
I:1639;1637;"A clever, interesting, vibrant, fast moving story combined with terrific character development and the perfect sense of humor made watching ""Stranger Than Fiction"" an absolute joy!"
I:1639;1638;Each and every acting performance appeared flawless, reflecting highly on both the performers and their director.
I:1639;1639;Overall, I found this every bit as fresh on the second viewing as was the first.
I:1639;1640;"for example, well into the story, when Harold is trying to find how to reach the narrator/author, he returns to his workplace after his forced ""vacation"" and hurries through the building."
I:1639;1641;there were many complex visual angles to this movie, as well.
I:1639;1642;There are many more stimuli that exist to both startle, amaze, and challenge the audience throughout the film.
I:1639;1643;Unhesitatingly, a five star show worthy of repeated viewing.
I:1639;1644;This film has a good plot and an even better ending.
I:1639;1645;This is indeed a comical film yet it also has in depth meaning.
I:1639;1646;The ending is unexpected, unlike most films.
I:1639;1647;this film is witty yet full of drama.
I:1639;1648;If Kay lets Harold live, her novel will just be another bit of entertainment, but if she kills him, her novel will be a piece of great literature.
I:1639;1649;Great movie, emphasizes the real meaning of life and the pursuit of happiness.
I:1639;1650;will Farrell, showing that he has dramatic range, gives maybe the most impressive performance of his career.
I:1639;1651;Emma Thompson is believable as a neurotic but brilliant novelist suffering from writer's block.
I:1639;1652;There's enough doubt about which way the story's going to keep your attention.
I:1639;1653;"stranger Than Fiction is very funny but not in the way that most Hollywood ""comedies"" are."
I:1639;1654;beat humor a la Rushmore.
I:1639;1655;The humor's more subtle than that.
I:1639;1656;the story is a breath of fresh air given that Hollywood only seems to excel these days at remaking old movies and TV shows .
I:1639;1657;One of the most enjoyable aspects, for me, of this movie is that it was shot right in downtown Chicago.
I:1639;1658;There's a lot of life and art .
I:1639;1659;beautiful architecture and urban landscapes .
I:1639;1660;all in all, Stranger Than Fictions' a nice movie.
I:1639;1661;Nevertheless, it's one of the more interesting movies to come out of Hollywood in the last few years.
I:1639;1662;But what a clever plot.
I:1639;1663;And Emma Thompson is a genius.
I:1639;1664;I always enjoy watching her, and this movie was no exception.
I:1639;1665;I love that the message here is how important it is to make our own choices, and let good thrive.
I:1639;1666;He counts his steps and is very good at math.
I:1639;1667;This narrating continues while he walks, works, etc.
I:1639;1668;harold accidentally hears Karen talking on a tape on the professor's television, and identifies her voice.
I:1639;1669;She says she's writing a novel and describes Harold's life.
I:1639;1670;in the meantime, he's come to the realization that it's time to live.
I:1639;1671;She gives him the yellow legal pad papers and he takes it to the professor to read.
I:1639;1672;He finishes is and tells Harold that he has to die, that it is a great death, and the book would not work without it.
I:1639;1673;karen meets with the professor and discusses changing the ending.
I:1639;1674;He dissuades her from this, extolling the book as one of the greatest ever written.
I:1639;1675;I thought the ending would be something mystical and uplifting, perhaps explained by a parallel universe, a spiritual meeting of the minds, or something else out of the ordinary.
I:1639;1676;do what you want to do, live how you want to live, say what you want to say, be what you want to be, act how you want to act.
I:1639;1677;That being said, I found him almost charming and appealing in this movie.
I:1639;1678;Emma Thompson was brilliant, of course.
I:1639;1679;Maggie Gyllenhaal played a great character as the sexy tax evader/ baker.
I:1639;1680;Overall I truly enjoyed the movie in spite of my feelings about Will Ferrell.
I:1639;1681;Completely enjoy this offbeat, romantic comedy.
I:1639;1682;Lovely film, one of my all time favorites.
I:1639;1683;This was an entertaining movie.
I:1639;1684;So, of course, she got audited, and opened up his eyes to the life going on around him.
I:1639;1685;his interactions with Dustin Hoffman, a college lit professor, who sort of becomes his shrink, is interesting.
I:1639;1686;I enjoyed it, and recommend it to my friends.
I:1639;1687;I have a friend who is a writer.
I:1639;1688;eventually I found a therapist who helped get me on less disabling medication.
I:1639;1689;It's part of the illness, I thought.
I:1639;1690;So I let it go.
I:1639;1691;It's a give and take thing.
I:1639;1692;While I love kooky Will Ferrell movies, this is a pleasant change.
I:1639;1693;The script is smart, original, funny and touching.
I:1639;1694;This movie is great and highly underrated.
I:1639;1695;One of Will Ferrell's better efforts.
I:1639;1696;orientedscene in every one of his movies.
I:1639;1697;ray Special Edition containing numerous impressive bonus extras.
I:1639;1698;"director Mark Forster creates a fascinating world within a world in ""Stranger Than Fiction"" and has elicited top performances from Ferrell and especially Hoffman, who looks as if he's having a ball with the role."
I:1639;1699;My teen daughter thought it was great, so I didn't want to walk out and hurt her feelings.
I:1639;1700;I think it is that good.
I:1639;1701;She was captivated by this movie.
I:1639;1702;It is a movie that is fun to watch and think about when watching and afterward.
I:1639;1703;thornhill woke up early that Saturday, eager to watch a new film he hoped would prove memorable.
I:1639;1704;Despite the shadow of an exterior light on one side of the screen (he would surely have to forsake this particular screen in the future), he began to enjoy the film, its wacky story and off.
I:1639;1705;"Both Ferrell and director Marc Forster (""Finding Neverland"", ""Monster's Ball"") accomplish the brilliant feat of breathing life into this character."
I:1639;1706;"Ferrell's performance is so low key
I:1639;1707;As thornhill watched the performance, he realized Ferrell hit every note perfectly.
I:1639;1708;thornhill watched the movie with glee, very happy with the tone and feel of the film.
I:1639;1709;In the opening moments, and throughout, director Forster shows us what Harold's life is like by giving us a view of what his character sees.
I:1639;1710;As she speaks, we see a superimposed map appear before Harold's eyes.
I:1639;1711;Caused by two factors, his new found love and the narration of his life informing him that he must die.
I:1639;1712;Yes, they are both very good and the film would probably be fine with just them, but there is more going on in this film.
I:1639;1713;thornhill was pleased to see Emma Thompson in a fine role in this film.
I:1639;1714;Her voice proved to be the perfect accompaniment to Harold's life.
I:1639;1715;First, we watch her standing on a roof top, weaving her hand through the air, contemplating what it would be like to jump off.
I:1639;1716;thornhill was very pleased to see Hoffman back in form.
I:1639;1717;The performance is interesting, quirky and completely at place in this universe.
I:1639;1718;as the film continued, thornhill realized the characters were perfectly matched to their environments, another example of the top notch production team working to create an interesting, wacky landscape for the film.
I:1639;1719;At one point, Harold stays with his work buddy, Dave, who dreams of going to Space Camp and is clearly a Star Trek nerd.
I:1639;1720;In fact, most of the architecture seems to be from the mid 80s, giving the film a stylized look perfectly complimenting the wacky nature of the story.
I:1639;1721;throughout the film, thornhill delighted at director Marc Forster's off.
I:1639;1722;As they make small talk, the bus continues on it's course.
I:1639;1723;This is a brilliant and slightly wacky way of showing how Harold feels about Ana and his relationship with her.
I:1639;1724;Hopefully, they will be able to look past this and appreciate the film for what it is, a wry, well.
I:1639;1725;made dark comedy with some very funny moments.
I:1639;1726;I'm not a big Will Ferrel fan but this is not his usual slapstick comedy and he's great in it.
I:1639;1727;The story holds your interest right up to the end.
I:1639;1728;Emma Thompson and Dustin Hoffman both do exceptional acting jobs as you would expect.
I:1639;1729;This truly original and creative story is told with dry wit, great acting, and characters that inspire my interest.
I:1639;1730;The author and IRS agent are great characters, as is Dustin Hoffman's english professor character, but what really steals this show is the affectingly pretty and perky Maggie Gyllennhaal.
I:1639;1731;Equally lovely is her character, the self confident, leftist, rebellious baker, Ana Pasquel.
I:1639;1732;The scene where she is moved by agent Harold Crik's very amateur, yet heartfelt guitar and singing improvisation is one of the most moving scenes I've seen in a long time.
I:1639;1733;Although I saw it in the theatre, this one is destined for a place in my permanent collection.
I:1639;1734;Harold is very quiet, patient, and subdued.
I:1639;1735;He lives alone and only has one friend, a guy at work named Dave (the delightful Tony Hale).
I:1639;1736;In short, Harold is the perfect IRS agent.
I:1639;1737;He seeks the advice of a psychiatrist and eventually that of a famed literature critic and teacher, Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman).
I:1639;1738;Hoffman reaches the conclusion that Harold is caught up in a tragedy and the best way he can avoid his fate is to start living his life more fully.
I:1639;1739;She hasn't written anything for a decade but will soon finish her latest work, an epic of American fiction, the great American novel about an IRS agent named Harold Crick.
I:1639;1740;will Ferrell gives one of the better acting performances of his career.
I:1639;1741;It's a change of pace for Ferrell, yet at the same time the character was perfect for him to play.
I:1639;1742;It is one of the best performances of his career, but it is not Oscar worthy.
I:1639;1743;It does show, however, that Ferrell is capable of more than just being a funny man.
I:1639;1744;maggie Gyllenhaal portrays Harold's love interest, Ana.
I:1639;1745;Gyllenhaal gives a fine performance, giving Ana the wit, sensuality, rebellious nature, and a tiny bit of perkiness that makes her the type of woman that any reasonable and sensible single man would find attractive.
I:1639;1746;emma Thompson gives a strong performance as the author who is writing what she believes to be a work of fiction, Kay Eiffel.
I:1639;1747;Thompson is almost always enchanting on screen and her presence is as strong as ever (even without wearing any makeup).
I:1639;1748;Dustin Hoffman is also a good fit as the English professor, Jules Hilbert, who tries to help Harold.
I:1639;1749;i found STRANGER THAN FICTION to be a somewhat strange, but enjoyable movie.
I:1639;1750;It's helped me to understand that real.
I:1639;1751;life heroes are better than the ones we read about in literature and often see in movies.
I:1639;1752;The truth isn't just stranger than fiction, it's often more interesting and exciting as well.
I:1639;1753;His Golden Globe nomination for this movie is well.
I:1639;1754;There were superb acting from all supporting actors .
I:1639;1755;the luminous Maggie Gyllenhaal, the always excellent Emma Thompson, and to a degree, Hoffman.
I:1639;1756;The last 10 minutes of this movie is something you'll want to watch and rewatch again.
I:1639;1757;I am usually not a fan of Will Ferrel's movies (the exception being Anchorman), but I found this to be an incredibly brave departure for him.
I:1639;1758;The storyline is intriguing, and the love story feels natural and unforced unlike a lot of movies these days.
I:1639;1759;Stranger Than Fiction is amazing, anything less than five stars would be a crime.
I:1639;1760;Will Ferrell, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Emma Thompson, Queen Latifah and Dustin Hoffman are perfectly cast in this story of a man who discovers he's a fictional character whose creator is about to kill him off.
I:1639;1761;Will Ferrell is a naturally sympathetic fellow who will tug at your heartstrings but not in a manipulative or contrived fashion.
I:1639;1762;This movie is one of the better movies ever made.
I:1639;1763;It has it's own mixture of dry wit and humour, a subtle yet powerful message about life, and leaves most every viewer with content.
I:1639;1764;"Perhaps you will find hints of philosophical motion, or great literary ""to and fro"", but no matter!"
I:1639;1765;It is just an all around good movie.
I:1639;1766;Sit down and enjoy it.
I:1639;1767;It's funny how people on here would rather be lied to than told the truth if it's not what they want to hear.
I:1639;1768;A more attractive, more romantic lead with comedic overtones and a funny sidekick would have worked better than trying to make Ferrell play it straight and romantic, with only the oddity of his situations to get him laughs.
I:1639;1769;"prof. The fact that the story is totally fantastic and could never happen gives the audience a feeling of ""so what?"""
I:1639;1770;Even fantasies have to be believable on some level.
I:1639;1771;but, if you'd rather be lied to, this is a fantastic film that rates with Gone With The Wind, Ben.
I:1639;1772;Yet her presence was well observed by me from the first frame of her lovely face.
I:1639;1773;What a sweet, sweet baker, Ana Pasquel.
I:1639;1774;i dug this movie, as I knew I would.
I:1639;1775;will Ferrel is great as HArold Crick.
I:1639;1776;That is, until he starts to hear a voice in his head, narrating his life.
I:1639;1777;like the one of the actual woman who is in the process of writing the book about Harold Crick, who is a very strange woman, but an equally enjoyable character.
I:1639;1778;this one is just for fun.
I:1639;1779;And I guarantee that Ana Pasquel character, is a lot of fun too!
I:1639;1780;I liked this movie very much.
I:1639;1781;It's a great combination of the cerebral and the emotive.
I:1639;1782;Will Ferrell shows that he can be something other than a dork (who would have thought), and Emma Thompson and Dustin Hoffman are predictably professional and terrific.
I:1639;1783;Maggie Gyllenhaal is believable and appealing as the love interest.
I:1639;1784;The suspense is managed well, and from a meta.
I:1639;1785;It's beautifully written and is an incredible breath of fresh air for Hollywood that seems to be spending most of it's time pairing stars to do remakes of 80s TV shows or other movies.
I:1639;1786;This movie is funny in a subtle way but also inspirational.
I:1639;1787;This is truly a great movie.
I:1639;1788;Ferrell, Hoffman and Gyllenhaal do an amazing acting job, and they really make you feel as if you know them.
I:1639;1789;I loved this movie right up to the end.
I:1639;1790;It worked hard to deliver a profound message, but then it wimped out and decided the audience would prefer a warm.
I:1639;1791;The 4 stars are because I enjoyed the movie so much up to that point, and it's easy to stop the movie early and pretend I had been given something to think about.
I:1639;1792;The strange thing is (no pun intended), while they are both as good as ever, the actor who is stunning is Will Ferrell.
I:1639;1793;The ending is exactly right because everyone's priorities finally get straightened out and because the ending fits with the point of the story.
I:1639;1794;I thought this was a very original film and script, and well acted with perfect casting.
I:1639;1795;This I can say is one of my favorite movies of last year.
I:1639;1796;I know I'm in the minority here, but when a six year old boy acts like a six year old boy, it's cute.
I:1639;1797;because here at last is proof that not only can he be funny, but he has the acting chops to boot.
I:1639;1798;"Casting aside the ludicrous and by now formulaic persona he inhabits in other films, here he plays a lead character with heart, sincerity and all the subtleties and nuance to make it ""pop"" The entire cast if wonderful, but you should expect that of them, so it really is Ferrell that makes this such a surprise."
I:1639;1799;Add to that the fact that he actually steals the show, and even manages to steal the show from Dustin Hoffman (where did that come from?)
I:1639;1800;, and this is a treat.
I:1639;1801;the story itself is fantastic also.
I:1639;1802;Very well written, so that the twists manage to still surprise you a little, while giving the viewer easy signposts to follow.
I:1639;1803;Other reviews have covered the synopsis, but I will add that to see a movie, much less a comedy with a story again was refreshing to say the least.
I:1639;1804;Very well concieved and reaized, this is a grand exploration of literature, choices and the ways we can affect one another.
I:1639;1805;overall, the first comedy in a long time to get five stars from me, and far and away the best movie Ferrell has ever done!
I:1639;1806;the cast of this film delivers an excellent story about illusions, love, and a journey to discovery.
I:1639;1807;Personally, I really enjoyed this film.
I:1639;1808;For example, his life is entirely based on his wristwatch.
I:1639;1809;"overall, ""Stranger than Fiction"" is a great film, that is writing wonderfully well by Zach Helm and directed by Marc Forster."
I:1639;1810;will Ferrell continues to expand his film repertoire.
I:1639;1811;Even during slapstick comedy, there's a hint of a genuine human behind the character's Farrell creates.
I:1639;1812;the rest of the cast is equally strong.
I:1639;1813;Maggie Gyllenhaal (although only given a passing notice in the trailer) is actually the other half of the romantic duo in this romantic dramedy.
I:1639;1814;She creates a very real person out of what could have been an over.
I:1639;1815;The chemistry between Farrell and Gyllenhaal is great.
I:1639;1816;Other than that, I have no answer, but her character is pretty nondescript and she manages to play it in a pretty nondescript way.
I:1639;1817;Overall, though, the film is so genuinely enjoyable that it's not worth questioning the finer points.
I:1639;1818;It's a package worth the price.
I:1639;1819;He usually plays a child man with over the top acting.
I:1639;1820;It can work for a slapstick comedy but this is a much more complex layered movie.
I:1639;1821;The movie is touching, funny and romatic, none of which I expected with Ferrell in the lead role.
I:1639;1822;The acting all around is great and the movie is unpredictible.
I:1639;1823;It is a truly a relief to see originality rather than a paints by the number comedy.
I:1639;1824;So okay, that passes with me.
I:1639;1825;and I am a baffled creative writer mind, too.
I:1639;1826;From grand opening line to grand twisted if not overly surprising finish, loved every screen shot, every line of literary dialogue.
I:1639;1827;winning writer Karen Effiel) makes a terrific eccentric novelist, Ferrell (as Harold Crick, her main character) won points with me as a more serious, wacky, neurotic auditor, perhaps only the romantic side story got a sapped out wince out of me at moments.
I:1639;1828;And Dustin Hoffman is always a treat.
I:1639;1829;Even Queen Latifah and Helen Hunt add some sparkling moments.
I:1639;1830;And Maggie G looks super.
I:1639;1831;I bought it on a whim and recently rewatched it, and fell in love with it.
I:1639;1832;Considering I just got out of the hospital near death, it was the right time to watch it, so the timing was perfect.
I:1639;1833;I absolutley loved the performances by Maggie Gygenhaal and Emma Thompson.
I:1639;1834;I think both of them did FANTASTIC jobs, they crafted their characters to the core and with heart.
I:1639;1835;And I loved the edgy passionate alternative angst thing Maggie did, down to all of her body movements and expressions.
I:1639;1836;"I also loved the way ""Stranger Than Fiction"" way filmed, all the colours they used brought about a serenity in me."
I:1639;1837;It is a brilliant, original smart script.
I:1639;1838;Thank you to the filmakers and everyone involved in making this movie.
