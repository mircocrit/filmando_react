1;die Hard is one of those rare Holiday movies that captures true holiday spirit.
2;mouthed cop John McClane, but the action scenes are somehow believable.
3;bang action entertainment at its finest, with some witty (and very realistic) dialogue, and its stunning action sequences.
4;This is highly recommended on all counts.
5;I'm so pleased to see so many raves for this movie here.
6;Well, Die Hard is the better film, because (1) it sets out to do something more admirable and (2) it achieves it.
7;It sets out to be not just an action thriller, but a generous and original one.
8;( American Beauty was anything but original, and now enough said about that.)
9;This is the one Hollywood action movie that has been truly well thought out.
10;The theater audiences almost giggled with delight and tension.
11;And right there is an example of the generous filmmakers giving us more than we might ordinarily expect .
12;moments after the leap, we get (1) the possibility of his being stuck dangling there, and (2) the absolutely sweat.
13;The whole terrorists vs. common thieves element also adds to our pure enjoyment .
14;So it's appropriate that McClane's signature expression should be .
15;see this one, but see it in widescreen: there's at least one moment .
16;One passenger carries a concealed weapon.
17;She has a new Rolex watch.
18;Two criminals surprise the desk clerk.
19;He wants the head of the corporation.
20;There is an event that warns the policeman, and he calls for assistance.
21;There is subtle humor from the plans to invade.
22;There are lights to show the building.
23;Hans is a clever actor!
24;[The action builds towards the climax.]
25;There is a terrific fight scene.
26;There is a final meeting between John and Hans.
27;can you see how this story was carefully crafted to appeal to a wide range of customers?
28;elaborate plan to rob a safe.
29;"This story is ""too clever by half"", but worth watching once."
30;"The story about one man winning against great odds echoes ""Red Harvest""."
31;With it Willis became an international star, McTiernan the foremost action director of the age, and it has been infinitely copied.
32;But the movie itself if very original and perhaps the best action film ever made.
33;It creates people we care about.
34;It does all this while being the most heart.
35;pounding film of the century, and the directing is incredible, by the way.
36;If you watch it enough times, you will realize the true genius of this production.
37;There are some moments of grain,blur and to what I felt was audio drop.
38;It's a classic for a reason.
39;Really enjoyed this and so did Hubby.
40;I always enjoy the die hard series, this is the first one and I think the best one
41;Die Hard is simpily, by far, the king of all action cinemas.
42;poundng adventure, while at the same time, giving birth to the career of Bruce Willis and John McTiernan.
43;It stinks to high heaven).
44;Great villain, Great soundtrack, Great ActionOverall the film holds up very well, most dated things are the womens hairGreat Film
45;John McTiernan's star has been fading lately, but it shone like a supernova with 1988's Die Hard, a taut and exciting action thriller that made Bruce Willis an international star and began a trend of explosion.
46;"With the police angle, he uses the ""cops and robbers"" theme."
47;The screenplay and movie also highlight wit and droll humor .
48;As the prime mover of the action, it's Gruber who's the protagonist, with Willis as the heroic antagonist.
49;The widescreen format and sound are great, the new interactive menus are eyepopping, and the extra features on both discs are excellent.
50;The first Die Hard in my opinion takes the cake for the best in the series.
51;The second one had a great storyline and lots of action but this one kept you on the edge of your seat all the way through.
52;Bruce Willis delivers another masterpiece here and I would put this in his top 3 movies of all time acting in.
53;The movie does a great job developing in the first half hour and then the rest of the movie was nonstop action.
54;This movie takes extreme to its finest.
55;Another great part about this movie is some of the catch lines in the movie.
56;Lots of funny lines by Bruce Willis as the movie goes on so you have a bit of comedy and action to along with it.
57;Overall a great movie and one you must pick up if you have the chance.
58;This is definitely in my top movies, in fact, it is among the best movies I have ever seen.
59;I give it a perfect 10 out of 10.
60;He talks to his wife, and they get into a bit of an argument.
61;They get into a fight, and when it seems like John's opponent will win, John is resourceful.
62;John hugs his wife, and he and his family as well as all the people go home for the holidays.
63;This movie is damn near perfect.
64;It has great acting, many cool and/or funny quotes, and this is as good as Bruce Willis gets, as far as I'm concerned.
65;If you like action movies, this is for you.
66;Decided to watch a few flicks from my younger days and it's still just as good as the first time I saw it.
67;Diehard is without a doubt the quintessential action movie of the 80s.
68;It was Bruce Willis first big movie after his stint on moonlighting which was a brilliant show as well.
69;He's the flying the ointment of their perfect plan.
70;While diehard does take place in one place the building the director and writer did a brilliant job of making it seem that it took place in many places.
71;The acting even by the supporting cast is very good especially Alan Rickman.
72;Joel Silver did a brilliant job producing this movie and the director did a great job as well.
73;Even though the movie sounds simple on its surface it's really quite complex in some areas.
74;adventure movie like Pirates of the Caribbean.
75;But it is a smart movie even though it has a simple premise.
76;If you enjoy diehard you'll enjoy all the other ones after it and I highly recommend this movie.
77;What a fine action film this is!
78;Probably the best of it's kind ever make.
79;Others may disagree, but in our book it's tops.
80;I can see why it is so popular.
81;I am in my 20s and really enjoyed it.
82;It is a great christmas movie.
83;It comes with two commentaries, one from the director John Mctiernan, and one with some cast members.
84;It also includes other features, that make up this two disc set.
85;die Hard was a breakthrough action movie for actor Bruce Willis and director John Mctiernan, making them household names in their professions.
86;the storyline fits well with the hook in the first 10 minutes and the rise and fall of the story is very well done.
87;Bruce Willis did a wonderful acting job particularly in his ability to portray the element of overcoming all odds.
88;Reginald VelJohnson was also brilliant in his role as the Sgt. Al Powell.
89;The connection between the two is right in line with the way friends are forged in times of battle.
90;This is a classic action movie with some great humor.
91;The original movie is always the best movie, right?
92;Great price and (as always) fast shipping.
93;This really is a terrific action movie.
94;The rest of the movie is top notch, the action is gripping, the movie is fast paced and exciting, the actors are perfectly cast, and the hero, being human and vulnerable, was a refreshing change from the invincible quasi.
95;"superheroes that dominated action films in the years before ""Die Hard"" hit the theaters."
96;The hero's name in both novels, and in the Sinatra film, was Joe Leland.
97;There were a lot of other changes from the book as well.
98;He's now a pretty highly regarded security and anti.
99;Given the superhero characters like Rambo so prevalent up to that time, this may have been a very wise decision for broadening the movie's appeal.
100;but a surprising amount of the book made it into the film.
101;The overall tone of the movie is much lighter.
102;And while some might decry this as Hollywood wimping out yet again and compromising the artistic intergrity of a film by caving in to public desire for happy endings, I personally regard this as an actual improvement over the book.
103;I think it was brilliant to portray thieves masquerading as terrorists in order to carry out their plan.
104;I think that was a great story idea, and it's part of what makes this movie so entertaining.
105;This one was innovative and clever, balanced effects with great acting by a great cast, and remains as exciting and entertaining to watch now as it was nearly twenty years ago.
106;"Loved this movie, funny lines from the movie by Bruce Willis: ""Come to the Coast!"""
107;They rank amoung my favorite action movies of all time.
108;OK, now for my opinion of the Blu Ray which is reflected with 2 stars.
109;I bought this to be part of a gift basket of Christmas movies and snacks.
110;"he sees the bad guys when they're sleeping, he knows when they're awake
111;`Die Hard' is intense, absorbing, entertaining and completely `edge of your seat' worthy from start to finish.
112;Director John McTiernan did a masterful job of getting the action just right, of editing the film in such a way that each scene brilliantly leads right into the next, never losing its intensity or losing its audience.
113;Add to that one of the greatest action performances ever and you have one thrilling movie that is prime for repeat viewing after repeat viewing.
114;the plot is fine but it's the action that really makes `Die Hard' an instant classic.
115;It holds up even today, twenty years after its release, proving to be just as good if not better than most of the so called `action' films that get released today.
116;the acting is also a highlight, especially that of Bruce.
117;In my personal opinion Bruce gave one of the best performances of the year.
118;He was natural and witty, charming and brooding all at the same time.
119;He created an iconic character, and that is hard to do.
120;John McClane is a household name.
121;Alan Rickman is also a pleasure to watch here.
122;As Hans Gruber he creates a prime bad guy, someone cunning, masterful and of course evil.
123;Bonnie Bedelia nails her performance as McClane's wife.
124;She filters through her characters emotions well.
125;in the end `Die Hard' is a classic film that I'm sure many of you have already seen.
126;date as the films being released today.
127;credit has to go to the director John McTiernan for a lot of the appeal of the film.
128;The tight shots on dramatic acting sequences, good use of claustrophobic spaces and the many visual surprises all went a long way to ripping our hearts from our chests.
129;Holly is a senior executive with a Japanese corporation, Nakatomi.
130;the terrorists are led by the coldly competent Hans Gruber, played very well by Alan Rickman.
131;He makes a good adversary for Mr McClane because he is well prepared, ruthless and has a team of very well trained assistants.
132;along for the ride we are able to enjoy a few interesting minor characters, a sassy but thoughtful limo driver by the name of Argyle, a manic psychopath in Hans' group, called Karl, a nearly as manic heartless reporter, Thornburg, a twinkie munching sensitive cop, Sgt. Al Powell, a pair of blinkered FBI agents and a ridiculously incompetent police captain, called Dwayne T. Robinson.
133;As you can see, Die Hard is chock full of deep and meaningful characterizations, which all go towards enhancing our viewing pleasure.
134;which leads me to this assessment: even if Die Hard weren't the first of this genre, it would still be the best.
135;hostage movie has ever come close to the energy and thrills that this one has to offer.
136;cracking partner of Cybil Shepherd in the TV series Moonlighting, makes a remarkably sucessful transition to the big screen, taking on the role of NY cop John MacLane.
137;the action is definitely first.
138;rate, the highlight easily being the scene where MacLane jumps off the high.
139;Soon, their conversations take on a more personal nature, and before they even see each other, their relationship evolves from professional to friendly.
140;A nice touch, culminating in an affectionate bear hug when they finally meet.
141;perhaps most interesting is the character of Rickman.
142;Yes, we've seen classy bad guys before, but Grueber, with his sartorial elegance and erudite eloquence, certainly stands out.
143;I just watched it 3 times in the past few weeks, and it's fun to watch during the winter due to its holiday backdrop.
144;Bruce Willis was at his action character best in this first edition of the Die Hard trilogy.
145;I didn't just ordered part one but up to part 3 of Die Hard, and i loved it because now my family is complete of this series.
146;Viewed: 4/03, 12/03, 1/06, 6/11Rate: 101/06: What I love about Die Hard is how real the hero character is.
147;The latter, for the role of Hans Gruber, is an Oscar caliber performance, which marked the """"finally"""" we have an intelligent villain to watch."""
148;Just like Predator, John McTiernan is able to blend in the special effects smoothly with the surreal adventure of the violent nuked skyscraper.
149;Die Hard is as real as it gets for me.
150;To this day, the special effects are spectacular as ever.
151;The realism maintained by the characters is what makes the film to work.
152;I still love that performance by Alan Rickman, usually a very funny guy.
153;Great movie, and definitely an awesome price for the blu.
154;at a great price .
155;and I opened it and watched it :}, Thank You Amazon.
156;i like Bruce Willis and even though he liked this one better than the second one, i still think the second one's better.
157;It is extremely well written and acted.
158;James Bond movies are good but this was totally better.
159;It is a nice plot about how an ingenious terrorist plan can be spoiled by a single cop who is like the mastermind when dealing with terrorists.
160;This is a good movie, GET IT.
161;Die Hard, which launched the career of Bruce Willis is also one of the most influential action movies ever made.
162;He is visting his wife Holly on Christmas eve.
163;She lives and works out in L. a. and the two are having some problems.
164;Everyone else has pretty much covered how great this film is.
165;I'm not a huge fan of action movies, but I enjoyed every minute of this one.
166;Bruce Willis as John McClane is almost perfect, filling the screen and keeping our attention effortlessly.
167;Macho with just enough vulnerability and humor to make this character one you keep rooting for.
168;And there are so many other wonderful supporting parts: Alan Rickman as Hans, the epitome of calm control, is the perfect villain to match McClane's chaotic crazy cowboy.
169;i'm a huge fan of the Die Hard movies so any fan of the film knows the plot.
170;so yes good info to know that the blu.
171;This was a Christmas gift,but it was one of the best movies I have ever watched.
172;If you never heard of it you see it.
173;For a VHS tape this is great.
174;A much better picture on playback.
175;Bruce Willis is one of my favorite actors.
176;The action is fast and exciting.
177;Best movie to watch EVERY YEAR on 12/25.
178;There is no better movie to watch on this date.
179;Most of what to like comes in the form of acting.
180;Bruce Willis gives the best performance of his career and Alan Rickman makes a great if a bit over the top villain.
181;In my mind Bruce is what makes the movie watchable.
182;He is able to make the hero an everyman and is able to balance being a tough guy with showing his sensative side.
183;Another positive is that for the most part the action is realistic which makes some of the scenes very thrilling.
184;In the end Bruce is the reason that Die Hard is as popular as it is.
185;"All in all ""Die Hard"" is an enjoyable film but I wouldn't call it must see entertainment."
186;That's right, 'Die Hard' is the most outstanding, most memorable, and most entertaining action movie ever!
187;The various scrapes Willis undergoes and the suttle plot twists makes the movie a winner already.
188;The acting suits the situations well and makes the film easy to get into right from the start.
189;The action scenes themslves are simply stunning .
190;although the third 'Die Hard' has a good stab.
191;Movies like this are now considered dramas because you can actually care about what is happening instead of waiting for the next stunt, effect or explosion.
192;She was at the edge of her seat and got all of her friends to watch it.
193;we've got a new generation of Bruce Willis fans and I rediscovered that Die Hard is a Christmas movie.
194;new family tradition for sure!
195;FAR superior to the last two films in the series.
196;Die Hard is, quite simply, as good as an action film can be.
197;Die Hard has just the right blend of witty, intelligent writing (yet still not forgetting the profanity), exquisite acting, intense plot twists, and just the right amount of bloody killing.
198;And to top it off, all of this expertly directed at break.
199;If you're looking for something fun, intense, intelligent, action.
200;packed, and maybe even a little graphic, look no further than the legendary Die Hard .
201;This film is the perfect action film.
202;It combines pure action and plot to make it great.
203;Bruce Willis is perfect for the part of John McClaine.
204;He takes us on an action filled ride that we will never forget.
205;in Moonlighting, Willis was perfect romantic comedy material, but his ability to perform deeds of heroism was very much in doubt.
206;often actors take a while to find the vehicle that best defines their movie career.
207;the movie itself is an action delight.
208;Have been a member for years with always great service.
209;You will watch this again and again, as all characters are fairly solid, and Rickman's villian is absolutely the most suave bad guy you'll ever see.
210;this movie is i so action packed .
211;its old but the action is still raw.
212;The 3rd of this series is the best, which is unusual.
213;A good movie, 2 thumbs up.
214;I always make my family watch traditional Christmas movies.
215;This is a classic Bruce Willis movie.
216;Great action, shoot outs, explosions.
217;And it does take place during Christmas!
218;"Would definitely recommend this to others
219;Willis' glints of humor shine through often enough to make you think that you would like to know this guy.
220;If you haven't seen Die Hard, or if you haven't seen it for a long time, treat yourself.
221;This is a really good, fun movie.
222;This was an excellent movie, really fun to watch.
223;The plot was better than most action movies these days and it was the beginning of a great trilogy, and also launched Bruce Willis's great career.
224;Alan Rickman is perfect as the German leader of the terrorists that take over the building.
225;This has to be the best and most original of all the Die Hard movies.
226;It's a classic and deserves 5 stars!
227;Die Hard is what made Bruce Willis a big star.
228;It is filled with over the top action and some really good performances, especially by Alan Rickman as the terrorist leader Hans Gruber.
229;An action classic, no doubt about it.
230;Bruce wills is always a great actor.
231;Lots of action and a very touching ending.
232;Will definitely wa5ch it again on Christmas Eve next year!
233;After years of watching the movie on tbs , it was nice to see the movie in the uncut version.
234;I love Bruce Willis and anything that he is featured in.
235;I am enjoying the video and thank Amazon and the vendor for their good service.
236;I just love Bruce Willis and I love the Die Hard series.
237;Every time I watch Bruce WIllis all I can wonder is, how could Demi trade a man for a boy???
238;Very upset that the trilogy turned out to be 2 movies and 1 making of the movies.
239;I ordered the trilogy because I specifically wanted the last show.
240;die Hard with a Vengenance.
241;This is a stunning film.
242;It's got tension, great lines, some fantastic action and a brilliant performance from Bruce Willis.
243;Some really gripping, edge of seat action.
244;I'm a huge fan of the movie and needed it in my collection.
245;Must have and must see.
246;john McClane is a New York City cop visiting his wife on Christmas Eve in Los Angeles.
247;and of course the big draw was Bruce Willis and it's funny that the actor was once best known as the guy on that Moonlighting show from the 80's yet we see him as an action star and it's not hard to see why.
248;while the film feels """"80's"""" a lot, it's still nonetheless an engaging movie for those who are finding the recent action films a little lacking."""
249;This is one of the most action packed, unpredictable movies I have seen in decades.
250;If your a Bruce Willis fan these are some of the best movies of his career in my opinion.
251;This is, by far, the best of the Die Hard movies.
252;He loved both of the items.
253;Would recommend this movie as a must have for collectors of classic movies!
254;One of the best action movies of all time.
255;A true classic, better than the sequels.
256;"Every so often, a movie comes along that creates its own ""sub."
257;what sets this movie apart is the sheer intelligence of the script, the rock.
258;solid performances of the cast, and the staggering action sequences.
259;His John McClane is vulnerable, tough, and funny as heck.
260;radio comraderie with Sgt. Al Powell (Reginald VelJohnson) provides a nice amount of male.
261;The movie as a whole overcomes this misstep.
262;While some may argue that the other Die Hards were better and more action packed, I still have to give the original Die Hard the nod for best movie in this trilogy (though 2 and 3 and both good).
263;There is just something more real and believable about this one that the others don't have.
264;What they missed is that Die Hard is a good film on its own.
265;Alan Rickman gives an excellent performance as lead terrorist Hans Gruber but it's Willis that carries the film with his wisecracks, catchphrases, and charisma.
266;again, it's Christmas, and again Mrs. McClane is in danger.
267;die Hard 2, although a lesser film than its predecessor, more than makes up for it in the fun factor.
268;a double feature is probably not in order, but either of these films make for fine escapist viewing.
269;"day ""classic"" movies that was so popular that is spawned several sequels."
270;It was just great entertainment value.
271;"The action scenes are memorable
272;This movie has become part of the popular culture in a way that few movies have.
273;one aspect is simply that Bruce Willis plays John McClane with a very nice mix of vulnerability and confusion to go along with his near super hero fighting ability.
274;His trademark wise cracks also add some humor to a movie that could have been relentlessly violent.
275;Reginald VelJohnson as Sgt Powell is also a great human touch to the movie.
276;He grounds McClane and gives him a friend and supporter when the bad guys AND, the local cops, and the feds are against him.
277;bonnie Bedelia plays Holly Gennero McClane in a very interesting way.
278;And this is important, because our movement to admiring and then liking her is more powerful if we start not liking her much.
279;alan Rickman as Hans Gruber gives one of the classic performances in film.
280;Everybody who has seen this movie remembers this role vividly.
281;It really is a great performance and a great villain.
282;Alexander Gudunov was much better known than Rickman, and his scene chewing performance got him a lot of notice (and in a way type cast him), but it is Rickman's cool headed monster that we remember most vividly.
283;clarence Gilyard, Jr. as the computer genius is also a role we remember vividly.
284;He does it so well that it has to be hard on him when he goes in public because people probably treat him roughly, assuming he is one of the jerks from his movies.
285;the movie has so many other wonderful characters who add their own touch to the movie that I cannot list them all.
286;There are so many more nice small performances that make the film as good as it is.
287;a classic film telling a story that anyone who has seen the movie will remember.
288;While certain scenes have dated ever so slightly this one still holds up as a classic in the genre.
289;The premise is original, the acting is mostly top notch, and everything is fairly believable.
290;Great action scenes and love how it includes the Christmas theme which makes it one of my favourite Christmas holiday movies.
291;The price and shipping were very good.
292;The 'Die Hard' series almost seems like it is getting out of hand with ridiculous action scenes, but the original here to me is the best.
293;Alan Rickman does a great job playing the sinister foe and even does a pretty funny impersonation in the movie.

299;This is a popcorn movie with smarts.

302;This is an awesome movie.
303;Bruce willis is excellent in this movie die hard is a action pack thrill ride.
304;this movie is so awesome i love this movie.
305;Die Hard, however, does all of this so well that it emerges as great entertainment, even as we realize how derivative it is.
306;After a moderate success with his big.

314;Whether it's the nifty set of one.
315;or a bit of humor that's agreeably understated (like a SWAT officer pricking his finger on a rose bush), it helps sustain a jovially entertaining mood to help offset the sometimes.
316;The one after that, which was helmed by McTiernan, was more spirited and fun, but it still lacked the organic clarity of the brilliant original.
317;A classic Bruce Willis action movie.
318;Worth the time to watch even though I've seen this movie several times in the past.
319;die hard is one of the most classic movies ever made.
320;packed thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat through the whole movie.
321;the sequels were good too, but the first one is clearly the best!
322;Die Hard (1988) is excellent because it is not complicated.
323;and the music is very good, too.
324;the entire story, with only a few cutaways lasting a total of 5 minutes for the entire movie, takes place in one, easy to understand location.
325;The second Die Hard movie is filled with script speeches and add.
326;"the use of the Beethoven ""Ode To Joy"" theme from the Ninth Symphony is used very interestingly and very well, and is included in an orchestral version during the closing credits."
327;Die Hard One is better for that reason.
328;This is true with Die Hard One, the best of the Die Hard series.
329;"movie making is always a committee event, and the old adage which states ""a camel is a horse put together by a committee"" applies to movies and explains in part why so very few movies are truly excellent."
330;"die Hard (1988) is a good movie because it is simple, easy to follow, and not complicated by attempts to ""improve it."""

334;I bought the movie because I liked Live Free or Die Hard.
335;I liked the Bruce Willis character much better in the sequel.
336;I actually bought this film to see Alan Rickman.
337;Mr. Rickman was so good as Hans Gruber.
338;This is easy to use and a good instructional tool for any teacher who wants to teach the editing, shot selection, and visual story telling process.
339;This is probably the best action packed movie of all time.
340;Hands down my favorite movie of all time!
341;Alan Rickman is wonderful as Hans Gruber, the leader of the terrorist group.
342;willis, armed just with his service revolver, single handedly takes them all out in some of the best filmed action sequences ever.
343;the film holds up well for the time period, and the premise of the couple on the fritz caught up in an unlikely and dangerous terrorist plot, adds an edge that is still relatable in terms of realism.
344;Bruce Willis plays one of his, if not his best known, role well and entertains with his diligence and """"Boyscout"""" ingenuity."""
345;The sound however, was powerful and thrust the action forward with a crystal clear and thunderous soundtrack.
346;The director John Mctiernan also directed Predator .
347;to me another class action movie.
348;Both Predator and Die hard are very tight and pacy.
349;Action here is slick, intelligent and at the same time hard.
350;i can give you one assurance you can watch it over and over again.
351;"The first in the awesome ""Die Hard"" movie trilogy is a dynamite, terrifying, and explosive action."
352;packed adventure that has lasted through the ages and still is an unstoppable movie paralleled by so few, even now.
353;Holly McClane works in a high.
354;rise office building called Nakatomi Plaza in sunny Los Angeles and is having a party celebrating a business success.
355;"it was ""Die Hard"" that made me a fan of Bruce Willis's movies and while a good number of others he did such as ""Armageddon"" are excellent works, the ""Die Hard"" movie trilogy is to me, his crowning achievements in his career."
356;He is truly awesome in this movie, playing the often disgruntled and stressed.
357;Rickman's role as the quiet but dangerously cunning terrorist ringleader Hans Gruber is absolutely unforgettable and it deservedly brought Rickman's incredible talent to light.
358;Although Bruce Willis' character is the main one in this movie, I have to hand it to ya, Alan Rickman is the shining star in this movie and his character Hans Gruber is by far the best of all of the Die Hard villains.
359;Reginald was perfect for the role of playing the warmhearted Al Powell and made for some excellent extra entertainment.
360;hitting edge classic for the ages.
361;all in all, there are lots of great action movies out there that have been spawned in the wake of the Die Hard movie trilogy but I recommend this movie out of all of them.
362;"While most of the other action movies are based on just action and fun, ""Die Hard"" takes those elements and blends them with intelligent dialog, awesome directing and unbelievable cinematography that propels the Die Hard movies so many miles above their peers."
363;"I also recommend ""Speed"" (Avoid ""Cruise Control"") as that one in it's own ways, rivals the punch of ""Die Hard"" and has even more action."
364;"This movie series started strong with this 1988 original and ended ""With A Vengeance"" with the ""Die Hard 3: With A Vengeance""."
365;i could give this movie countless stars but have to give it a five because that's the highest I'm able to rate it here.
366;Enjoy the movie and have a good time!
367;I was very happy to see this come out in blu.
368;It still is a movie I'll continue to watch over and over especially now on blu.
369;ray making it even more enjoyable.
370;and it's really a classic, so unless you don't watch action movies at all, you really should see it.
371;Tons of action, a good dose of humor, and even some realistic emotional stuff.
372;Everything's well balanced and logical and just sucks you right in.
373;i was impressed with the portrayal of Holly, John's wife (played by Bonnie Bedelia).
374;This is highly unusual in action movies.
375;I loved that they were thieves, not ideologues.
376;It was such a great twist, and so very believable.
377;I'd probably enjoy this even if it wasn't such a good movie.
378;film series, this is arguably the number one action film ever created.
379;It is hard to believe this is over 20 years old, but honestly as the saying goes.
380;"This is definelty about tremendous action, but its also about Bruce Willis as ""John McClane"" ."
381;the hero who can most likely can be found on any list of top movie heroes of all time.
382;as exceptional as some of the characters are, and the incredible details director John McTiernan makes out of a rather simple plot, its really the action this film offers that keeps us on our toes.
383;"More than anything else, there is a ""ton"" of gunfire throughout the film, and if you have a decent audio system, it actually sounds better than most shootouts in films."
384;Oh yes, Die Hard is well known for them.
385;Die Hard is the kind of movie that Hollywood does best.
386;Fast paced action, crisp dialogue, hateable villains, lovable heros, explosions and, of course, quotable lines: Welcome to the party pal!Bruce Willis gives an intense, everyman caught in a tragedy performance.
387;alan Rickman as the villan is a perfect counter punch to Willis's Action Hero.
388;"this is a real ""guy"" movie and young children probably should not watch it because of the intense violencs."
389;this is the best of the series and may be one of the best action film ever made.
390;Alan Rickman plays one of the best villians I have ever seen, cunning and deadly.
391;Bruce Willis is a cop from New York, his wife is in California working in a high paying job.
392;He gets involved and the action is none stop, also Willis has some really funny comments through out the movie.
393;Good guy wins and gets the girl.
394;It's a perfect guy movie.
395;This is one of the landmark movies in action movie history.
396;In fact, action wise, it has probably the most punch of any action picture ever made.
397;the balance of the movie is an often vicious cat.
398;happy terrorists and a cunning McClane, who slowly figures out the terrorist game plan and improvises ways to interfere.
399;die confrontation with the leader of the terrorists, played with snarling charm by Alan Rickman.
400;this movie is highly recommended as an entertaining and very effective action movie.
401;Aside from being the ultimate Christmas movie, this is one of the absolute best action movies ever, certainly a fine reason why the 80's was THE decade for action movies.
402;tENSION/CHARACTERSWhat separates most action movies from Die Hard is that the hero, McClane, is very vulnerable.
403;This creates a lot of tension while watching the movie, and I'd even say that compared to even the best action movies, Die Hard probably has the largest amount of tension because even after the initial viewings, I was still riddled with tension in the scenes where McClane gets really hurt.
404;Because of the fact that John McClane is such a vulnerable protagonist, he's more believable as a person and this vulnerability makes him creative with his plans to weed out the terrorists infesting the Nakatomi building.
405;He also does a great job playing a slimy terrorist leader, since he has no problem personally killing his hostages and has a smooth charisma that keeps him from going into over.
406;the supporting cast is solid as well.
407;Bonnie Bedelia is solid as Holly Gennaro.
408;The actors playing Gruber's cronies all do a good job, particular Alexander Godunov as Karl, Hans's right.
409;aCTION SCENESThe action scenes in Die Hard are top notch and highly memorable.
410;The action scenes, going along with the premise of a highly.
411;vulnerable protagonist, exercise a great deal of creativity with the methods of combat McClane adapts to make it out alive.
412;mATURE CONTENTThis is R. rated for good reason.
413;tier action movie, there's a good deal of bloody violence and death infesting this masterpiece.
414;sOUNDTRACKThe music in Die Hard is top notch.
415;Overall, it's rather daunting and exciting, and the music is a perfect fit for the type of movie being played here.
416;Michael Kamen did a great job with the music here, and he'd do really well with the soundtrack for Event Horizon nine years after this.
417;"dMC played towards the beginning of the movie, and some other Christmas tunes being played to bring about the ""Christmas feeling"" to this movie."
418;fINAL WORDThis is an action movie masterpiece, and probably John McTiernan's best film.
419;many others have given excellent reviews.
420;Suffice it to say that I love this movie and have watched it time and time again.
421;This picture is nice and crisp, but the high.
422;I'm usually not into this genre, but when I saw this movie I was on the edge of my seat the whole time.
423;Bruce Willis is always worth the price of admission, and Alan Rickman's performance is one of the things that take this movie beyond the just.
424;Definitely worth a prominent place on your video shelf.
425;He and Bruce Willis together was brilliant.
426;A great movie night must have,
427;I like the movie on the whole, exciting, etc.
428;Yell along with the prime quotes.
429;This man is an acting genius, and the fact that I *just now* learned about his role in this film is nothing short of embarrassing.
430;But give me my Alan Rickman, please.
431;I would recommend this to anyone who likes action movies.
432;After a very unpredictable, eye.
433;Die Hard has claimed its spot as one of my all time favorite films.
434;Okay, this is one of those action films that really works.
435;Alongside Speed and Face/Off, Die Hard is superb as it delivers a whole lot of high.
436;But what's so obviously great about this film is the action.
437;The gunfights and the explosions (as well as the stunt work) are spectacular, and many of the action sequences still hold up today.
438;Both Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman are excellent as the hero and villain, though I do think that the villain here, named Gruber, is way more interesting than Willis himself.
439;It's got what you would expect in an action film: intense gun battles, clever dialogue, and a mano.
440;But still, this film is solid.
441;One of the great action movies of all time, and a fun movie to watch during the holidays if you want to change it up.
442;DIE HARD remains one of the best action films of the last twenty years because, unlike so many of the Schwarzenneger, Stallone, and Segal pics, this film actually has a great deal of tension, suspense, and even terror.
443;Clearly, they are at odds with one another, what with Willis' line of work and Bedelia's need for independence, being as she is an executive at the Nakatomi Plaza in West L. a., where they reunite.
444;But eventually, Willis catches up with him and, in a showdonw that pays homage to the 1952 western classic HIGH NOON, shoots and kills Rickman and saves Bedelia.
445;happy buffoon and the FBI men, led by Robert Davi, into a gang of trigger.
446;Willis is at his best here, as is Bedelia, who makes for a far better than average heroine.
447;VelJohnson's performance is also quite commendable.
448;Not so with Rickman, whose performance as Hans Gruber makes for one of the most compelling and crafty villains the cinema has ever had.
449;boosted by Richard Edlund's great special effects work and a high.
450;How can you not love the most amazing Christmas move all time, and one o the most perfect actin films ever which makes his one of the greatest, perfect films all time.
451;but here, for your viewing pleasure, is the glorious seat of the action empire.
452;ray far exceeds the Five.
453;ray video is exceptional in almost every way.
454;ray viewing exceeds the theatrical experience.
455;Everybody knows Die Hard is one of the best action movies ever > highly entertaining and just as cool as it was 20 years ago.
456;A classic flick given a great Blu.
457;i forgot how great this movie is.
458;this is onethrill ride of a movie.
459;willis puts in a great performance as McClane,who becomes a one manarmy.
460;this movie is so much fun,you won't care(or have time to care)about realism.
461;This movie is a great compromise on a Saturday night.
462;My husband loves the action and I love Alan Rickman.
463;this is a very good movie and it's filled with suprizes,humor,and action!
464;Bruce Willis does an excellent job in this film as the hero, it's easy to see how he became a huge success after this film.
465;My hat's off to Alan Rickman as well, his portrayal of the villian was as equally impressive.
466;This film is the definition of exciting and after all of these years, the movie is still as fresh as it was when it was originall released.
467;It's very well made, exciting adventure that you have to see if you haven't already!
468;One of my all time favorites.
469;"this first ""Die Hard"" is a classic."
470;cracking hero, a skyscraper to fight in (and destroy), and great cop.
471;That's a bad day, and he overcomes it in this action packed film.
472;"One sign of a great film is that you can watch it over and over again and enjoy it just as much each time
473;She didn't think she'd like it, as she hadn't yet seen a modern action film that she really liked, but she loved this one for its humanity as well as the fun quotient.
474;special forces hero who simply cannot die or fail, so typical in action movies of the time"
475;Apart from these, everything that he does could be accomplished by an intelligent, experienced cop.
476;this film is also realistic about the capabilities of the weapons and explosives used.
477;, we see an accurate display of why the 9mm is the favorite round of law enforcement everywhere.
478;"The bad guys' Uzi machine guns are 9mm also, as is Hans' stylish little pistol (I do believe)
479;dimensional and narrowly focused to move the action along.
480;For an action film, this one has it all: great casting and good acting"
481;i finally saw this with my dad last month and now it is my number 1 favorite movie of all time, the action in here was perfect not to much or to low.
482;This also has the best movie villan rickman is humorus and the same time voilent.
483;Sure, this first installment of the Die Hard trilogy came to theaters 13 years ago, but to add freshness to this classic action ride, director John McTiernan and his crew technical craftsmen and producers have united to bring the power of INTER.
484;Besides being fun to have the power over what you're manipulating, an added appreciation for the craft of editing is easily achieved.
485;This allows the views to see how the script evolved in the hands of those who made the film.
486;Commentary and behind the scenes words from those who were there are also here for your enjoyment.
487;the best appreciated bonus is the amazing clarity of the digital transfer.
488;bodied sound is spectrually sharp and defined.
489;Fun to watch, always entertaining.
490;Great older movie to kick back and enjoy with some popcorn.
491;John McTiernan was only in his mid thirties when he directed this fantastic film.
492;Presently he is wrapping work on DH4.
493;He also wrote THE DETECTIVE.
494;"Jan De Bont did the cinematography, and as well as being a creative energetic lenser, he is a pretty good director
495;This film was a breakthrough for him.
496;as good as Willis was, much of the credit for the film's success had to go to Alan Rickman, who played charming intelligent villian, Hans Gruber.
497;He seemed to pioneer the notion that an antagonist can be witty, smart, and well mannered, as well as lethal.
498;Rickman, a fine actor, went on to do other brilliant turns as villians in QUIGLEY DOWN UNDER (1990), and ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES (1991).
499;Of course, he is enjoying great success these days as Professor Snape in the HARRY POTTER series.
500;the supporting cast were quite good as well.
501;90% of her career has been in TV films, but she is very effective in this part.
502;I also loved her as Shirley Muldowney in HEART LIKE A WHEEL (1983).
503;note, all snarl and not much inner conflict, but he looked the part, and as a great ballet dancer he moved well in the fight scenes.
504;It established a new kind of action movie"
505;It's a classic action film but what struck me was the technology advances.
506;The state of the art building, which I remember as being very cutting edge at the time, is routine technology now.
507;It's a total blast from the past!
508;One of the best movies ever made.
509;It builds tension, suspense, has some of the best action scenes ever filmed and even a spot of brief female nudity.
510;John McTiernan directs Bruce Willis in this 1988 master piece of modern cinema.
511;mcTiernan (Predator) does his best work here weaving a straight forward plot which we see the protagonist pitted against foreign thieves in a skyscraper.
512;The pacing, cinematography, musical score, acting, stunts, action and story all work perfectly together to create a piece of modern art that really hasn't been rivaled by any other action film since its release nearly 30 years ago.
513;There is no DNR, blacks are deep, colors are vibrant or muted when they should be, detail is very sharp and crisp and the natural film grain is still visible.
514;This is probably the best Christmas movie ever made (although A Christmas Story is an amazing film on the other end of the Christmas movie spectrum) and one of the few Christmas movies I can tolerate to watch during other seasons of the year.
515;It was the most violent and intense movie I had ever seen up to that point in time.
516;This is cinema at its best.
517;This is art at its best.
518;I looked everywhere for this movie and finally found it on amazon and I'm so happy I found it.
519;The movie never gets old, always a thriller.
520;The first of the series, it was always the best.
521;I've seen this movie bunches of times since it came out in 1988, and what's enjoyable for me is not the action, which is well done, but the character interaction.
522;Bruce Willis, as John McClane, is a pretty good representative for the everyman.
523;But he is observant, clever, funny, loyal, and brave.
524;fold: that an everyguy can go up against a brilliant, organized, elite, arrogant force and win and, while he's doing it, he can show his superiors up as complete idiots and get the job done when they can't.
525;He makes an exceptional foil for McClane: their weaknesses and strengths complement ech other's.
526;And Clarence Gilyard as the hacker Theo has a real energy about him.
527;props must be given to the filmmakers for including black actors in key positions on all fronts and including them as savvy, and, for the most part, sympathetic characters.
528;One of the top action films ever and with a Christmas backdrop!
529;so, next Christmas eve (or whenever) gather the family around the TV and enjoy.
530;Other than that, it's a great movie classic.
531;This one really set the stage for the modern action film.
532;Justifiably made a superstar out of Bruce Willis.
533;If you like action films and somehow you missed this, you have a treat coming.
534;the film is really good i would reccomend it
535;The original Die Hard is the best of the series.
536;If you like Bang Bang shoot em ups, this is the best.
537;Because this movie is set around Christmas, my family watches it every year around this time.
538;It's a classic plot with good guys and bad guys.
539;My son is named Bruce partly in honor of Bruce Willis, one of our favorite action heroes!
540;Give me that smartasss New York cop every time.
541;Because John McClane, he earns his Christmas cheer.
542;DIE HARD propelled Bruce Willis to Hollywood's stratosphere.
543;No other actor could've packed this role with so much humanity and vulnerability and wiseassery.
544;There's such a strong human element to the storytelling.
545;McClane and Al's talks via radio are only some of the fantastic grace notes strewn throughout the film.
546;These are actors on top of their game.
547;down the years DIE HARD has earned a well.
548;deserved rep as a rousing non.
549;Director John McTiernan takes the time to set things up, to develop John McClane as a full.
550;There is so much suspense in that premise.
551;McTiernan's precision camera work establishes that sense of claustrophobic space and, in familiarizing the audience with its geography, elevates the Nakatomi building into a supporting character.
552;dIE HARD brings us back to an age when our heroes didn't automatically throw down with the kung fu.
553;And I love his strokes of ingenuity, his knack for improvising under duress.
554;and, omigod, he's so funny.
555;The best thing about his humor is that it feels organic and unforced and off the cuff.
556;Credit Willis for having ad.
557;libbed most of those lines.
558;"If I had my druthers, some sweet day, quotes from DIE HARD will be freely bandied about during the holiday season, alongside the likes of ""Bah, humbug!"""
559;And to all a good night.
560;Of course, everyone has probably heard of this excellent film starring Bruce Willis.
561;The 2nd and 3rd are descent but not great films.
562;Mclaine, the cop, obviously has to do something about this.
563;this is the best action movie ever with some wickedly cool scenes.
564;Bruce Willis proves that he is a great actor with some great lines (yipikaye mother f#$%^*) and when he curses at the lady at the police station on the phone because se thinks that it's a prank.
565;This movie blows the Bond movies and all of the other action movies out of the dust and will remain the true great action movie, and the movie that trully jumpstarted Bruce Willis's career.
566;but there is much more to watch.
567;The first of a series is always the best.
568;Willis is funny and always pulls off his deeds of destruction.
569;Brings back good memories, my wife hates that I say, it is a great Christmas movie!!
570;This movie is just pure excellence!
571;( Mcteirnan is directing, schwing!)
572;Brilliant video, by far the best die hard yet.
573;This is a brilliant video and you should see it as soon as possible.
574;Typical 80's action adventure flick.
575;Big bangs, big story, big acting.
576;Lots of what became traditional action film cannon during that decade.
577;The difference between the trailer and the actual movie is incredible!
578;Second, the Dolby Surround in this movie is top notch!
579;A powerful, action movie which keeps you in suspense throughout!
580;The visual effects are stunning, dialogue fast and very sharp and as always a great, beleavable performance from Bruce Willis.
581;One of the best action movies i've seen.
582;The movie was so innovative and groundbreaking that dozens of rip.
583;But that's just the way he likes it.
584;This is the first realistic connection the audience has.
585;When you don't want to be in McClane's position, it makes for much excitement.
586;john McTiernan, who's only previous mainstream movie was Predator, uses awesome photography and technical skills to give the film a truly polished and sophisticated look .
587;it was nominated for four technical Academy Awards.
588;He also allows for enough time for decent character development, most of which comes between McClane and a cop (Reginald Veljohnson) he makes friends with on a CB radio.
589;die Hard manages to be heart.
590;if you are one of those many people who have only ever been able to watch it on TV then now is definitely the time to rediscover a cool, classic and creative action picture on Blu Ray.
591;Die Hard will always be my favorite action film.
592;Bonnie Bedelia did a great job acting as John's estranged wife Holly McClane.
593;Alan Rickman and Reginald VelJohnson also give fantastic performances.
594;Director John McTiernan did an awesome job with the film.
595;The picture and sound are absolutly perfect in every way.
596;This film is LOADED with special features.
597;The 2 extended scenes are good.
598;The gag reel is cool too.
599;now the action, thrills, and enjoyment begin.
600;I hope you like the film as much as I did.
601;bruce Willis' breakthrough film that helped launch him into motion picture stardom.
602;He even gets a limosine ride to his ex.
603;lag, ten people enter the high.
604;rise and take over the entire building and Holly's boss.
605;our hero, is barefoot during this cat and mouse game.
606;I think this movie is timeless.
607;It still holds up very well today, and brings back tons of nostalgia from when I was young.
608;I've made it a new tradition to watch this movie every Christmas eve.
609;It's a great action movie that you can get away with calling a Holiday classic.
610;I have enjoyed every one of the Die Hard movies, including the newest one at the theater.
611;Love the action and the fun moments.
612;see you at the movies!
613;This movie has turned me into a fan of Bruce Willis.
614;It has some great acting and a great director (John McTiernan).
615;Like when he sends a body down an elevator, and has a special message on the body, just to let the terrorists know that he exists.
616;This is the best out of the series most definately.
617;Bruce Willis goes and beats down terrorists, and it's funny that he does the whole thing, without any shoes!
618;It is really neat to have the movie inside of a building.
619;The movie is usually really believable, but there were a few parts.
620;but that is just to keep suspense.
621;One of the greatest action movies of the 80's.
622;watching and loving this movies is required of anyone who calls themself a man.
623;Hans has that certain accent or personality that really makes this movie so much more intriguing.
624;now, John McClane must fight off those terrorists, then Hans, and make sure that he can save as many hostages as he can, but first, he wants to see his wife and his family, primarily.
625;But can he do just that?To do just that, it takes bravery.
626;This movie shows extreme examples of great fighting scenes between John and the terrorists, including some solo action from Sgt. Al Powell and his cop car.
627;This movie makes a perfect example of what it's like to be surrounded by hostility, in a 40 story building.
628;great use of music too.
629;I was really impressed by the adrenaline.
630;orchestra type format for various scenes.
631;It has all the aspects of heart.
632;pumping action, e. g., c.4 exploding in an elevator shaft, strategies made by John McClane and Hans at the same time, and the sheer amount of chaotic scenes makes this movie one heck of a great journey!
633;Bruce Willis is one tough SOB in this one.
634;He is in top form in the old school way here.
635;Very realistic portrayal of what it would be like to try and resist a takeover of a modern skyscraper by an intelligent and determined group.
636;Bruce Willis and Bonnie Bedelia star in this spectacular action film which is loaded with gunfire and suspense.
637;Al and John have maintained contact over their radios, and a deep bond has formed between the two.
638;class thriller from start to finish.
639;Bruce Willis is excellent as the undergunned but determined McClane, Alexander Godunov is perfect as Gruber's right.
640;hand man Karl, and Reginald VelJohnson is great as Sgt. Powell.
641;The action and suspense continues throughout the film, and there's some funny one.
642;i give this movie a very high recommendation.
643;The action will definitely keep you interested throughout, and Willis' acting is the high point of the film.
644;Yes, he's a cop, and a smart cop, but it is his portrayal as a troubled husband and father with marriage problems that really hits home.
645;He's stubborn and unobjectionable, and that helps us relate.
646;She has moved out there to successfully pursue her career, an idea that an old school Irish cop such as himself is probably not used.
647;He comes from a family who is most likely holding to values that the wife should be taking care of the kids and not working for a multi.
648;The lead terrorist is played by Alan Rickman, also changing the role of the villain for all time as well.
649;Rickman plays Hans Gruber, a smart, slick and highly intelligent criminal who does not gloat with evil laughter.
650;He is single minded and professional.
651;What happens afterward is a sharp game of cat and mouse as Gruber tries to figure out who this monkey wrench in the works is and McClane gathers information about the terrorists and tries to get help from the outside.
652;Add in some humor, some emotional conversations between McClane and a beat cop who he contacts outside the building, and some moments where the fear in Willis' character become very clear, and you get a movie that is so well rounded and entertaining, it's no wonder it's a classic.
653;Its high action and suspense with some amusing moments in the movie!
654;and it absolutely galvanized the packed theater, with everyone cheering and whooping and stomping the floor!
655;The characters were delineated so brilliantly that they're timeless.
656;You watch this flick, with 9/11/02 instantly coming to mind and it makes you think of how innocent we all were.
657;It makes me think of those fantastic Republic serials of the 40s that were edited for lightning fast pace, with thrills galore!
658;Even though Die Hard has been relentlessly ripped off countless times, Willis and this master crew of action geniuses bring this movie to electrifying life.
659;It's vibrant, visual, dynamic aura makes Die Hard a classic that will be watched a century from now, along with similar action classics, like Adventures of Robin Hood (1938)and Republic Studio's collection of mythical serial thrillers like G. men versus the Black Dragon and Daredevils of the Red Circle.
660;Die Hard is a great acion movie, packed with (you gessed it) action, witty humor, and unbeatable suspense.
661;And since his wife in among the hostages, it gets personal.
662;The action is well paced so that each few scenes lead up to a big action scene.
663;Bruce Willis is the man.
664;That covers all my bases.
665;"I just saw ""Die Hard"" for the very first time a few months ago and enjoyed every second of it."
666;After watching this movie I became a huge Bruce Willis fan because he's amazing in this movie.
667;The man does all of his own stunts and is a 1.
668;guy arsenal of power and strength.
669;The movie is total action from the moment it starts until the second it ends.
670;"If you have any interest in action pictures you must see ""Die Hard"" because it truly is the very best."
671;"I have since seen all of the other ""Die Hard"" sequels and enjoyed them all immensely because Bruce Willis stayed true to his character throughout every single picture."
672;Best cop movie ever (other than Bullitt).
673;This film put Bruce Willis on the spot.
674;Alan Rickman played a great badguy and Bonnie Bedelia played a smart part as Willis's wife stuck with the other hostages.
675;A great and believable film with a down right great director (John McTiernan) this film is all the goods.
676;Great sound, music score and visual effects!
677;Bruce Willis does a great job playing the New York cop John Mclain!The main plot of the movie is that John Mclain's wife takes a job in California and so they rarely get to see each other.
678;Can he keep them at bay until the police arrive or will they hunt him down and rid themselves of the threat he possessed?Overall this movie is easily a 5 star movie, and I now know why Bruce Willis is considered one of the best action film actors, right up there with the likes of Arnold S., and Sylvester Stallone!
679;Die Hard is a great action movie and also the best of the trilogy.
680;It has more heart and emotion than the sequels.
681;The relationship between Willis and VelJohnson adds a nice human touch to the film.
682;They manage to have good chemestry without actually talking face to face throughout the movie.
683;Which leads to me always getting teared up when he actually uses his gun again at the end.
684;It's a very emotional and powerful and under.
685;Plus to throw in there, Alan Rickman gives one of the best slimy villian performances in the history of film.
686;First of all, there's a great movie in widescreen on disc one.
687;Obviously, that's two big assets.
688;That fly is Det. John McClane played with gusto by Bruce Willis.
689;mouse with McClane is the German leader of the terrorists, Hans Gruber in an excellent first role for Alan Rickman.
690;Gruber is intelligent, cold, methodical and determined to get what he came for.
691;He relies on many underlings to do most of the work it takes to complete the job.
692;such as those that can be found on Taxi Driver, The Terminator, etc.
693;This is a nonstop action thriller about a New York cop trying to reunite with his estranged wife.
694;fetched but outstanding action movie that I really enjoyed.
695;Bruce Willis just does a wonderful job playing the role of the professional police officer who can hold his own against the bad guys.
696;This is a great movie and I loved it and I recommend it to you.
697;This movie created the one.
698;man army is trapped and saves the day genre and is the best of the them all.
699;Exlposions, gunfire, helecopters, this film has got it all.
700;This is still one of the best movies ever.
701;Die hard has it all action ,suspense,and lotsa comedy.
702;Was great when it came out and still a classic after 25 years.
703;Alan Rickman is just wonderful.
704;"thieves with clever booby traps and a lot of cheeky macho chatter, via a ""borrowed"" walkie."
705;Rickman's wonderfully sinister turn as a haughty villain only adds to the excitement.
706;For fans of clever, stunt.
707;"racing suspense, ""Die Hard"" will never expire."
708;It's a classic and the actors are superb.
709;A unique kind of Christmas movie and great entertainment with some memorable one liners.
710;Probably more than just a couple of times if you watch a lot of action movies.
711;This movie had it all, great dialogue, a great script, great actors, great special effects, and the perfect combination of action with comedy.
712;This is arguably Bruce Willis' best character ever.
713;His banter with head terrorist Hans Gruber is at times hilarious, at times adrenaline pumping, his conversations with Sergeant Powell are inciteful and interesting, and him just talking to himself are all great parts of this film that add to the story.
714;The Scene Editing thing, as many reviewers have said already, is absolutely awesome!
715;It includes the full screenplay, which is cool for people like me who have an interest in writing.
716;I give you my personal guarantee that you will enjoy it.
717;Action, suspense, drama, a little romance and ooohhh so much comedy.
718;One of my top 10 favorite films.
719;I love this movie, its awesome, its my favorite movie of all of the Die Hard ones,this movie is a must.
720;Though I saw this movie at least 10 times before,still watching this movie is fun and exciting.
721;This is my favorite movie of all time.
722;I absolutely love this movie.
723;The picture is awesome, the sound is incredible, you just can't do any better!Plot: New York cop, John McClane(Bruce Willis) comes to L. a. to be with his wife(Bonnie Bedelia) and kids for christmas.
724;I'll let you discover it for yourself.
725;Die Hard(1988) is a fun, well made action thriller based on Roderick Thorp's 1979 novel Nothing Lasts Forever.
726;It has a first rate musical score by the late Michael Kamen.
727;It has state of the art special effects.
728;Alan Rickman is superb as an intelligent, charismatic, well dressed German terrorist Hans Gruber.
729;The film also has some humor.
730;Bonnie Bedelia is quite good as John McClane's wife Holly.
731;Reginald Veljohnson is good as Officer Al Powell.
732;Then he showed us an 8 bit still photo of Steve Urkel!
733;Die Hard is a classic action movie.
734;Great action movie, with well balanced action and suspense.
735;Video transfer is very well done.
736;DTS sound is amazing, shaking furniture on explosions and spinning around you under fire.
737;Other features are also interesting, but what really shines is the editing room.
738;At the end of the scene you can view it the way you mounted it and compare it to the movie's edition.
739;There's also a sound edition feature that's also very intersting, but the editing room will entertain you for more hours.
740;top video, sound and extras.
741;minded silly radicals, And I enjoy that he is fighting these commies in this movie, plus you got officer winslow from Family Matters.
742;Since then I've probably watched it fifty, sixty, seventy times and it still delivers and still makes me smile.
743;on top of the happy memories I have associated with this movie there is also the place it holds within its genre.
744;It is probably the most influential action movie of all time.
745;Taking the motif of the lone warrior to the extreme, this movie's pitting of gruff loner John McClaine against charming villain Hans Gruber is a wonderfully overblown chess match that mixes action and humor, blood and gunpowder, machismo and heart all together into a perfectly seasoned dish of pure entertainment.
746;What can you say about the best action movie ever made in my opinion.
747;But it's a great movie it pretty much made Bruce Willis that and moonlighting.
748;Amazing action and suspense and acting.
749;Just a great action movie and great movie one of my faves!
750;ALthough there have been countless films to enter the action genre, Die Hard continues to be one of the ten best ever released.
751;cop shoot'em up that helped to establish him as one of actions finest stars!
752;Bruce Willis was amazing, and so was Alan Rickman.
753;He enjoyed it just as much as the first time he seen it.
754;This is of course the original Bruce Willis outing.
755;Want to keep guys happy: this is one of the top few essentials
756;The is one of my favorite movies!
757;The Plot is straight forward and brilliant at the same time.
758;John McClane is going to see Holly cause she accepted a job there which has a lot of h** in the marriage.
759;I like how the characters are developed the fight scenes are great effects are too as is the stunt work.
760;Nope, they're all at the office, enjoying a lavish party courtesy of company funding, and breaking now and then for a little work.
761;This sort of Christmas Eve and Christmas Day work ethic is absolutely magnificent.
762;A classic in the genre of action and for those who hate Christmas movies, think outside the box and pick up this unlikely holiday joy ride!
763;A great Action movie for any time.
764;It is a non traditional Christmas favorite around our house.
765;Die Hard was the first modern action movie I saw and it took my breath away when I did.
766;It's exciting, humorous, and fun, and has held.
767;It's always enjoyable to watch Alan Rickman .
768;and Bruce Willis is quite good as the hero.
769;This is not at all a realistic movie, and some of it is a bit campy, but it's all in fun and can provide a good escape of an evening.
770;Very disapointing, especially as this was a gift for a Bruce Willis fan.
771;Every year when Christmas rolls around I like to have some friends over to enjoy a cup of cheer (potent Egg Nog recipe available upon request), put on some nice Christmas music, light some candles, prepare some delicious h'oure dourves, and gather around into my humble but sufficient cinema and watch a wonderful holiday favorite.
772;He is a New York cop whose wife and children moved out west as she takes a great opportunity and adjusts.
773;it has perhaps as likable and convincing a hero as you can get in John McClane and Bruce Willis upstages every other action hero by making John not only smart and funny but easy to relate to with very little drama.
774;It's an effortless performance that I can only compare to Harrison Ford asIndiana Jones.
775;It's fantastical and it's kitschy, but that's forgivable because it's a holiday movie and even more importantly, action is still the priority in Die Hard.
776;on the other side of the coin, Die Hard's greatness is completed by its formidable and accessible antagonist, Hans Gruber.
777;Although we know Hans is capable of vile acts, he actually sees those as merely means to a greater and somehow justifiable end.
778;the supporting cast is another huge strength and helps to highlight the humorous undertone in the film.
779;The cops and feds are all amusing and rich characters, especially Reggie VelJohnson as the relatable LAPD sergeant Al Powell.
780;William Atherton's performance as a reporter is also worth noting, as is John's limousine driver, Argyle.
781;Those of course make it both amusing and accessible to all ages and Die Hard is one of the best examples of hilariously edited television movies.
782;But that is of course not what makes it a great movie.
783;I would actually argue that Die Hard is the greatest pure action film ever made.
784;this whole series is good, even the newer ones.
785;Officer McClane goes to save everyone, but there is fierce resistence and a brilliant criminal mastermind waiting to stop him.
786;this is probably the best Die Hard movie.
787;The action, cast, and screenplay are all very good.
788;"There's a lot you can say about Die Hard, but I'll keep it brief and just say ""It's awesome, you have got to see this classic action movie""."
789;Die hard is the most amazing action movie I've ever seen in my life.
790;We love this movie and are having fun introducing it to our kids.
791;Our 13 year old son loved it.
792;The original and the best in my opinion!
793;See Alan Rickman in his breakout role and in his prime!
794;Hard to believe this movie is 20 years old.
795;action, comedy, intrigue and Alan Rickman.
796;The guy is really believable as a normal, flawed family man who happens to be a cop, who happens to be caught up in a plot masterminded by people.
797;The cast is great (Alan Rickman paints an astounding picture of a villain) and Willis' John McClane just kind of gets under your skin, even if you never thought he would.
798;friendly, and Willis's tendency to be a potty.
799;but older audiences will find the story exciting.
800;The difference: This movie is well.
801;pounding action with funny one.
802;liners that always make me laugh out loud.
803;Bruce Willis is wonderful as the Rambo.
804;armed killers, and reveals just enough of his tender side to endear his character to the audience.
805;willis is backed up by outstanding supporting players who add depth and surprises: Reginald Veljohnson is the sympathetic cop Willis talks to via radio during his ordeal.
806;I heartily recommend Die Hard to those who love action films and those who just love excellence in film.
807;DIE HARD is one of the seminal films of the comedy action.
808;DIE HARD is a well.
809;"At its core a ""heist"" movie, DIE HARD transcends the usual smallish scale of that label with huge set."
810;piece sequences and nonstop action.
811;Bruce Willis, nobody's idea of extraordinary, is the actor non plus ultra of this genre.
812;they (and this) are well worth your time.
813;Still one of the best action movies of all time with a great cast including but not limited to professor snape and Carl winslow
814;Daughter is a big Alan Rickman fan.
815;He's terrific in this movie, and I can't think of anyone else playing the lead except Bruce Willis.
816;offs and with Bruce Willis, started the long line of sweaty vested heroes while making a huge box.
817;The first (and best) in what would become a trilogy, Bruce Willis' first major action man role carries the distinction of being heralded as the greatest action movie ever made.
818;It's title is debatable, but regardless, this movie is great!
819;liners, impressive FX and big noisy things exploding make this one of the all.
820;screen comparison and game demos and more cool stuff for die.
821;This movie has truly influenced countless action films but has also become a statement for all things sweaty and extreme.
822;This is possibly the best action movie ever made, it jumps from one scene of tense action, right to the next, while still having lots of fun.
823;The movie looks Great on Blu Ray, and has some sweet features, like 2 commentaries 1 from the writer and director, and another from the f/x guy.
824;I saw this movie when I was a kid and it hasn't lost any of it's glory in the past 20 years.
825;I'd far prefer this movie than Miracle on 42nd Street.
826;It's fun to watch these two face off, Hans's brain vs John's brawn.
827;The secondary characters are great to.
828;This is one film you can watch again and again, and it even works as a great Christmas movie.
829;even with a running time of more than two hours, the pace is fast and with a good story line.
830;The second installment Die Harder and the fourth Die Hard or Live Free is the best next to the first.
831;"See, here's the thing
832;I mean, seriously, I practically grow an extra Y chromosome every time I watch him.
833;Bruce Willis has done all of that.
834;in all seriousness, Willis' performance is truly fantastic, nervy flurry of raw, unadorned masculinity.
835;His character, John McClane, is one of the great tough.
836;guy action heroes, thanks to his sharp one.
837;cool fightin' skills, and feral intelligence.
838;Alan Rickman is also fantastic as the film's slick, coldly detached, and deliciously evil main villain, Hans Gruber.
839;dimensional as the """"loveable sidekick"""" label might make him seem, played wonderfully by Reginald VelJohnson) and a love interest who manages to be waaaaaaaay more than your typical damsel in distress (kudos to actress Bonnie Bedelia, who pulls of the role of McClane's estranged wife with plenty of intelligence and panache), and you've got yourself an exciting, engaging, blood."""
840;"It seems clear now that the 1988 film ""Die Hard"" is one of the most important cinematic touchstones of our lifetime, simply because every action film since then can be reduced to being a variation on the theme (e. g., ""Speed"" is ""Die Hard"" on a bus)."
841;Everything else pales next to that one, but the common theme you have with all of the key sequences is that McClane is an ordinary guy facing long odds in a series of extraordinary circumstances.
842;Add to this the fact that the action is pretty much non.
843;ultimately, John McTiernan's film achieves a solid balance between characters and actions.
844;"If an action film succeeds on the basis of the villain, then Rickman certainly provides that (I like the way his character is introduced), and I have always thought that VelJohnson's show ""Family Matters"" was an obvious and intelligent effort to capitalize on how great of a character he created in this movie."
845;Then there is Bedelia's Holly Gennaro McClane, who has it all, including a good right hook.
846;Besides making Willis a big time movie star it certainly set the bar higher for all the action films that have been made since 1988 and showed that you needed to have some heart and a sense of style to go with all the witty one.
847;Die Hard is still a lot of fun to watch.
848;It's got a villain that is expertly crafted by the screen writers, and absolutely perfectly portrayed by Alan Rickman.
849;rickman is so good at playing Gruber that, while the character is secretly hijacking a skyscraper, the actor is publicly hijacking the entire movie.
850;It's that kind of film.
851;Willis has a way of delivering, and allowing others around him to shine.
852;bottom line: This is to action films as Hank Williams is to Country music: it engages people who normally dislike the genre.
853;Even if you aren't the action film type, _Die Hard_ is worth a try.
854;I watched it in a packed theater in Los Angeles with a raucous crowd shortly after its opening.
855;The crowd had a great time, laughing in all of the obligatory spots where laugh lines are intentionally placed.
856;hans presented a refreshingly complex and out.
857;culminating in one of my absolute favorite lines in movie history when in response to Holly Genero/McClane's (Bonnie Bedelia) declaration that despite all of the grandiose talk and build.
858;The sparring between Hans and McClane is amusing and drama.
859;while the physical stuff is reserved for McClane's encounters with one of Hans's muscular henchmen, played by Alexander Gudenov.
860;The touching account of why the donut.
861;"eating LAPD officer ""Al"" (played with heart by Reginald Veljohnson) adds a very human side to the film, as well as a subtle reminder of just how tough it is to be a cop."
862;releasing laughs in a very fresh.
863;feeling manner that flows well with the rest of the story.
864;up, with a few occasional small releases of tension along the way, culminating in the final resolution.
865;Director John McTiernan's pacing and sprinkling of humor throughout the movie are what make Die Hard a memorable film.
866;This is a really classic action picture.
867;The best of the series.
868;Die Hard has taken its place among the modern classics.
869;"Bruce Willis is the resourceful but outmatched hero
870;The special features are decent as well, making this more than just a movie.
871;If you liked the movie in VHS.
872;John McTiernan's only film worth seeing is PREDATOR (1987).
873;That Schwarzenegger film has action, suspense, humor, and intensity.
874;In a moment of weakness it has a go at Philadelphia, but otherwise a good flick.
875;It really was a great movie.
876;Bruce Willis is excellent in it.
877;Best action flick out there!
878;Alan Rickman and Bruce Willis make this movie great Movie has you on the edge of your seat.
879;This was given to my brother as a gift which he loved it.
880;I love this movie, it has great action, and the characters pull me right into the story without even realizing it.
881;I would love to own all of them!
882;It is a great series and I would recommend it to anyone.
883;I think most of the action scenes was good, and i think Bruce Willis plays his character John McClane to perfection.
884;the bass from most of the gunshot effects sounded good to me.
885;John`s unarmed fight against one of German`s, i think had surprisingly good bass when they hit and kicked each other.
886;Being an intelligent take action kind of guy, John immediately sets out to try and see if he can do something.
887;john does something you rarely see in action films"
888;John also gets unlucky more than once.
889;John struggles to make headway with the terrorists as he is typically outgunned, but he keeps his head and manages to stay alive, which in this movie turns out to be really difficult.
890;bruce Willis does an outstanding job as vulnerable hero John McClane.
891;He is very human, as is revealed throughout the course of the building.
892;His type of hero is much more real than the stoic iron man often depicted in movies of this type.
893;He has real life problems, including a wife from whom he is separated and children.
894;the supporting cast is remarkable.
895;While there are a few moments when the interaction between John and Al gets a bit maudlin, the pairing is effective.
896;while Bruce Willis was creating a vulnerable hero we are entertained by a well.
897;I was entranced as much by the mysteries in this movie as by the action.
898;This movie is a winner for the combination of action, intelligent plot, and character development.
899;If high voltage gunfights teamed with snappy one.
900;liners and explosive action backed by a multi.
901;million dollar production are your idea of a good action movie, then this one's your cup of tea.
902;Alan Rickman, as Hans, is the best movie villain since Darth Vader.
903;Yeah I'll admit it there are much better films out there, 'Raging Bull' and 'LA Confidential' are but two vastly superior films.
904;like an album I don't always watch it but it is a comforting familiar background.
905;Even after 11 years (I actually only saw it 6 years ago) it is as exciting and thrilling to me as ever, I have never seen another film that I can view as frequently and not get bored of it, that is a testament to how good a movie it is.
906;Die Hard is one of my favorite action films.
907;They made two sequels, but this one, the first one, is the best.
908;Die Hard is THE perfect mix of INTENSE action, very funny jokes and one.
909;liners and entertainment at its best.
910;"And there's even more
911;This is one of the most entertaining films I've seen for sure, and it's the perfect one to watch when you don't want to think a lot and when your brain is tired and doesn't want to work.
912;All I can say about this film is positive.
913;It is long enough, there are no weak moments, and you're staying on the edge of your seat during the two big hours of fun that this film brings you.
914;And I was very surprised by how violent Die Hard was.
915;Die Hard is easily one of the best action movies ever made.
916;John McTiernan directed this thoroughly exciting film starring Bruce Willis as John McClane, NYPD cop who gets stuck in a hijacked building in LA.
917;The action in this film is top.
918;notch as well as the acting and pace of the film.
919;It's a film of the highest calibre.
920;Brilliantly written, wonderfully acted, and superbly directed action film that is believable in many aspects.
921;Our business weasel who tries to negotitate his way out is also superb.
922;it's a rollercoaster ride with enough humor thrown in by our idiot Police Chief to keep it entertaining.
923;I remember seeing it when it first came out and it had me gripping the edge of my seat.
924;There are rules for policemen., yet our hero does what is necessary to get the job done.
925;fun for a drinking game too.
926;The Best Stunt In This Movie Is When Willis Jumps Off The Building.
927;This is the best action movie of all time.
928;The sequels are pretty good.
929;I thought that Die Hard with a Vengeance was the best sequel.
930;See this movie and all those movies that rip this off!
931;It has a very exciting finale!
932;Hans Gruber/Alan Rickman is fantastically mean and John McLane/Bruce Willis amazing and very professional!
933;I bought this to watch on Christmas, it is also a good watch on the 4th of July.
934;Die Hard is the best Christmas movie (yes Christmas) that we have watched in a long time, if not ever!
935;A lot of the reviews I read mention the extra characters (mainly Dwane Robinson) that don't belong in movie.
936;DIE HARD is without a doubt, the most superior action movie of the eighties and the top ten of my movies of all time.
937;The sound is the best!
938;Here is a disc that does justice for a movie that does the action genre justice!
939;Bruce Willis, machineguns, explosions, fire, Bruce Willis, broken glass, terrorists, helicopters, explosions, FBI, dead terrorists, explosions, people falling off a 30.
940;something story skyscraper, and of course, more explosions!
941;How much better can it get!
942;packed, the whole thing is one long adrenaline rush!
943;Eat your heart out, James Bond!
944;washy tearjerkers, in which case I hope I never meet you!
945;Moon Lighting was good, but McClane is Bruce and vice versa.
946;This film is one of the, if not the very best action film ever made.
947;The original is the best.
948;But then came Die Hard, and a new action hero emerged: a pretty regular guy who's smart enough to call for help and insightful enough to realize there's a good chance he ain't making it out of this movie alive.
949;He arrives at her skyscraper office building on Christmas Eve, where she and her co. workers are having a party.
950;Little do they know that a group of very slick and experienced """"terrorists"""" have targeted them for a high."""
951;He's planned this heist down to the second.
952;He's funny, sarcastic and despite his vulgarity, it's obvious he's pretty smart too.
953;Willis gives this character ringing sincerity.
954;the supporting cast is great.
955;Hart Brockner is great as the slimy Ellis, who tries to sell.
956;William Atherton, who always does a great toady, doesn't let down his fans here as the overambitious reporter covering the take.
957;fights, hand to hand combats and a grand showdown between McClane and Hans to keep the action enthusiasts happy.
958;Even though some scenes are improbable, they're still very enjoyable.
959;die Hard set the mold for a new breed of action films, and it's to be commended for that.
960;I think I'll be adding it to my Christmas movie line.
961;This is without question one of the better movies that I have seen in quiet some time.
962;This film has it all.
963;Despite the stupidity of the local police forces he is still able to prevail.
964;This movie has an outstanding plot and many action sequences.
965;This is one of the better action(police) movies that you will see.
966;Great action, funny one liner.
967;Alan Rickman is excellent as the bad guy.
968;Undoubtedly the best of the 4 Die Hards and possibly the best action film ever made!
969;It is definately my favorite action film.
970;The office is celebrating both Christmas and the opening of the new building.
971;There are alot of excellent supporting characters, including Al the disgraced patrol car cop as well as probably one of the suavest villians ever.
972;It's a pretty old movie.
973;This has to be one of the best transfers I have ever seen.
974;Also, the sound is explosive and very impressive, especially if you can watch it in DTS.
975;I know some might be hesitant since they already have the first box set, but believe me, it is worth it.
976;stop action and thrills, Die Hard is a classic, and should be seen by all who loves action films.
977;Again, I must say this is one of the best transfers I have ever seen.
978;One of my favorite movies.
979;Bruce Willis is at his best.
980;I watch this movie every year with my family.
981;Bruce is superb as the inside man while the cops fumble and the Feds too!?
982;offs, but this one still holds up well all these years later.
983;I can easily read the words on signs in the movie.
984;watching this movie like I do.
985;See this first if you are watching Bruce Willis' movies.
986;the first and the best.
987;a classic action movie, very few are better, if any.
988;The movie itself still rocks.
989;ray is a must see.
990;and this one has classic written all over it.
991;amazon, please make your streaming player perform its function.
992;It influences nearly every summer action blockbuster to this very day.
993;"Sorta like how elements of ""The Matrix"" infuse everything from commercials to cartoons."
994;all movies of this genre are elevated by their criminal.
995;Every line is a high point, every glance or arched eye brow tells another piece of the story.
996;The sound design is spot on.
997;mcTiernan's direction is precise and efficient.
998;Everything is clearly and excitingly told, at a pace that leaves you breathless.
999;a documentary on such an influential flick seems a given.
1000;but they will occupy you for a while.
1001;This is one of those films where a character and an actor are perfectly matched.
1002;As John McClane, he is most definitely perfect.
1003;Gonna watch it a lot more.
1004;Ya gotta love Bruce Willis.
1005;He's such a good guy.
1006;who doesn't love a bruce willis movie, this is an older one, but gotta gotta love it.
1007;he's going to be another eastward, he can be 90 and still sexy as all get out.
1008;Die Hard is the best action flick ever made.
1009;Die Hard very well may be.
1010;"What follows are some of the most exhilarating action sequences I've ever seen in a movie: the rooftop shootout, the famous ""elevator shaft"" scene, the helicopter explosion, and the final death of the bad guy."
1011;The acting is pretty good for an action movie.
1012;Willis is fantastic as the protagonist, Rickman is slightly unsettling as the ruthless villain.
1013;All of the smaller roles are memorable as well.
1014;Die Hard is the best of its kind.
1015;Die Hard is an amazing action movie, an edge of your seat adrenaline filled thriller that made Bruce Willis an action star and John McTiernan the most popular director at that time.
1016;This is perhaps Bruce Willis's trademark movie, one that he shall be remembered for long after he's gone.
1017;While today's movie are targeted more the popcorn teenage type of guys, this is an adult thriller, showing off that sometimes in the world of corny action, some true genius does break through.
1018;"She works in the ""Nakatomi"" building, a gigantic skyscraper ruled by Mr. Takagi, a businessman."
1019;The good part about it though is that is has plenty of gunplay to hold your breath depsite the ending.
1020;The directing is amazing, the acting is great (especially Alan Rickman, who plays the leader of the gang, Hans Gruber) A spectacular motion picture.
1021;It's a great movie for people who don't like the traditional Christmas movies, but love action and intrigue!
1022;This movie is possibly the best of the Die Hard series.
1023;value boxed set, this is the most essential of the 'Die Hard' films.
1024;It looks and sounds gorgeous, and is paced so that, after a short introduction, it's constant action until the finale.
1025;It took Bruce Willis a decade of solid work to step from the shadow of his John McClane character.
1026;Willis is perfectly cast as the wisecracking cop who is in the wrong place at the wrong time.
1027;or the right place at the right time??
1028;Many quotable lines in the heart pounding fast paced action film!
1029;Great stunts,story and characters make this one of if not the best action movie ever!
1030;filled and a great ending.
1031;The Dolby mastering is superb and the sub.
1032;woofer gets a strong workout.
1033;It's a great action packed Christmas movie that leaves on the edge of your seat.
1034;I just watched Die Hard for the umpteenth time, but this viewing was with my 13 year old son.
1035;I haven't watched the flick in years, but it's as good as ever.
1036;The cinematography, screenplay, and action scenes are golden, and held my son's attention as well as mine.
1037;I think this is in the top.3 all time of all action movies, and possibly holds the top slot alone.Yippee!
1038;It has become a Christmas Eve tradition to watch this great film each year.
1039;The great picture transfer allows us to see the brilliance of the film, and the commentary from McTiernan is worth the price of admission alone.
1040;The branching scenes don't add much to the film, but they themselves are a nice extra.
1041;This blockbuster would also spawn an inferior (but nonetheless action packed and fun) sequel that was directed by Renny Harlin, and McTiernan would return to the helm for the third and in my opinion best installment, Die Hard With A Vengeance.
1042;It's a an action film, a comedy, a love story, a holiday movie.
1043;it's my absolute favorite Christmas film.
1044;It's classic 80's action at its best with some of the most memorable scenes and lines of all time and it never gets old no matter how many times you see it.
1045;It's about time this movie is done justice with an anamorphic.
1046;Now, if only Armageddon gets released on anamorphic format, I'll be happy as a lark.
1047;I find that this concept is simplistic but nevertheless a great way to make a movie.
1048;Bruce Willis does a great job as the hero in action.
1049;The script is well done and all supporting acting was a plus for the whole movie.
1050;Die Hard was always one of my favorite action movies.
1051;It was funny, thrilling, and had a good plot that allowed for a lot of fancy special effects.
1052;first off, the audio commentary is some of the best I've heard.
1053;I learned a lot about the filmmaking process just by listening to it.
1054;Die Hard, in and of itself, is a true classic.
1055;It is a staple of the action genre, and is still a thrilling motion picture 13 years after its original release.
1056;transfer in 2:35.1 widescreen, Surround Sound, screenplay, trailers and TV spots, and the mega.
1057;disc set as soon as possible!
1058;Amazon was wonderful to deal with during the shipping problem.
1059;I always watch this movie on Christmas Eve, so I think it's safe to say that Amazon saved Christmas.
1060;Of all the action movie franchises spawned in the last 30 years, this is the most memorable.
1061;Bruce Willis was the first regular action hero that I loved.
1062;Hilarious, action packed, a great stroll down memory lane.
1063;One of the best action film of the last 25 years.
1064;One of Bruce Willis best films I have seen.
1065;First, the positive: Bruce Willis is very nice eye candy.
1066;This movie was nice to see again.
1067;Foreshadowing clues make this movie one that I love to watch, especially as I recount how small incidents can pack such punches in our lives.
1068;That is hot and sexy and I am envious.
1069;ok I am being really serious here but did you see the computer rooms I mean glass walls cool right .
1070;Die Hard in my opinion one of the best Action films of the 80's maybe ever.
1071;Bruce Willis is great and this movie made him a star.
1072;A lot of action special effects and humor, a movie worth watching.
1073;I highly recommened this movie.
1074;It is such a classic.
1075;it is Bruce at his finest.
1076;And I love discs which include the filmscript!
1077;Every Christmas our family watches this and Love Actually.
1078;I love Bruce Willis' performance.
1079;He's so young in this one.
1080;The movie was in excellent condition.
1081;and so McClane is plunged into a cat and mouse game, which will test all his resourcefulness.
1082;even after all these years this is still a great action film.
1083;It is brilliantly directed by John McTiernan who utilises all the nooks and crannies of the building to create a real sense of cat and mouse.
1084;There is also plenty of warmth and humour in the story to help relieve the unrelenting tension.
1085;like all good films Die Hard contains characters that we really care about.
1086;Like all good action films this is combined with spectacular action.
1087;Action Packed with great one liners.
1088;Bruce Willis at his youngest and best is a delight!
1089;He creates a personality like now other actor does.
1090;That is what makes DIE HARD so good.
1091;Die Hard has got to be one of my favorite action.
1092;It has got some great action in it and some very un.
1093;this movie is the perfect party movie, perfect friday night movie, perfect for almost any time.
1094;what can I say about this first Die Hard film only that I still think personally this is the best out of the lot.
1095;they (the die hard movies) are all good action films but the first has normally original ideas , Bruce is at his best and I still reckon this is Alan Rickmans finest hour as the baddie Hans Gruber.
1096;i went to see Night At The Museum 2 with my wife and daughter and even though i did enjoy the film the cost of going to see it on the big screen was exspensive.
1097;$45.00NZ dollars , that included a icecream each and one big box of popcorn which we all sheared.
1098;great performances by all , huge exsplosions and great one liners , what more can you want , directed by John McTiernan who also did Predator and The Hunt For Red October.
1099;This is a easy to watch film and it seems to be over before you know it ,which is the sign of a good film.
1100;The original Die Hard is a classic film that is required viewing for action junkies.
1101;He knows what he must do and he uses his extensive skills (combined with a bit of luck and directorial favors) to rise to the challenge and neutralize the situation.
1102;the film is very well crafted and contains something for everyone.
1103;It is surprising just how well this film has held up over the years.
1104;It's still a highly enjoyable, tense, action.
1105;This film is a timeless masterpiece of the genre.
1106;John McTierman's director commentaries are enlightening.
1107;The special feature where you can edit three scenes from the movie, demonstrate in a small way how many creative decision go into putting together a big Hollywood action flick.
1108;The short special effects documentary is good too.
1109;Very short but good with a couple of seconds in B&W because it was never intended in the final cut!!
1110;My wish came true finally!
1111;This is a really awesome movie with great action, and great actors!
1112;Hands down, my favorite Christmas movie.
1113;It's about heart, about reunions and good friends.
1114;It's just that Die Hard also has explosions and Alan Rickman in one of his best performances.
1115;The greatest Christmas movie ever!
1116;Also a great example of an action movie done right.
1117;Alan Rickman turns in a great performance as Hans Gruber and you can clearly see the charisma of Bruce Willis and his smirk that has kept him a box office draw over the decades.
1118;This movie is amazing, it.
1119;s superb, it has great special effects, a great story with great characters, if you are looking for extremely good action, watch this one, believe me it is one of the greatest action movies ever made, you won`t get dissapointed I really can assure you that.
1120;It's excellent, but not outstanding.
1121;My favorite would be DH2, but DH1 really set the mold and probably should win the award for best creativity.
1122;I prefer the winter airport and snowmobile scenes of DH2 to the city skyscraper scenes of DH1 it probably has a significant amount to do with where you grew up.
1123;This movie has no compelling message, no inspiring dialogue, no noteworthy acting, or anything to make it an outstanding movie.
1124;Except that it is one great action movie.
1125;He has this skyscraper at his use to try and outfox these bad guys and he makes the most of it.
1126;It's one exciting scene after another and, all the while, he has to worry about his wife being a hostage of these terrorists along with her fellow office workers.
1127;There are plenty of twists and turns throughout the movie and we find ourselves frequently on the edge of our seats.
1128;i usually expect to be inspired, touched, or otherwise impressed before I consider a movie to be great.
1129;Die Hard holds up well over time.
1130;Some of the lines from the movie are now cultural icons.
1131;I got this for my husband's stocking, since it's a Christmas movie!?
1132;Die Hard is a classic in our family.
1133;it's a great christmas classic.
1134;one of my personal favorites.

1137;Die Hard is a classic of American moviemaking.
1138;Bruce Willis at his BEST, cracking wise, just minding his own business.
1139;brilliant, fun, and full of action, but without gratuitous gore and blood.
1140;Screen favorite Bruce Willis became one of the biggiest action stars in the explosive action.
1141;Die Hard is certainly director John McTiernan's best work and ranks as one of the finest action movies ever made.
1142;This remarkable actioner contains some tight.
1143;paced camera work, a solid storyline, memorable dialogue and some good bits of humor.
1144;Bruce Willis delivers plenty of excitement and laughs, and Alan Rickman is positively engaging as the film's villain.
1145;Die Hard delivers some memorable thrills and spectacular action sequences including an impressive rooftop explosion.
1146;Die Hard Five Star Edition is a remarkable improvement over the previous release.
1147;Its Dolby Digital 5.1 sound is certainly outstanding but for the full home theater experience, the DTS audio track delivers more powerful bass and great clarity.
1148;depth audio commentaries with director John McTiernan and crew, fun outtakes, extended scenes, picture gallery, trailers and colrful interactive menus.
1149;One of the best action movies ever.
1150;The first one is still the best in the series.
1151;Easily the best Die Hard movie and a rare victory in this genre for the director and producers.
1152;I sat down and cheered Bruce on through this movie which is as rare as Michael Jordan being humble.
1153;This is one of those action films that actually deserved to be called a modern classic.
1154;copy immitators, Die Hard is a great action epic, and it's displayed quite nicely in this new 5.

1156;On the second disc, there's a good amount of stuff to keep you busy.
1157;rOM form), and a slick little treat called The Cutting Room .
1158;Here, you can see how elements work in some of the big scenes in this film by either changing takes or playing with the sound.
1159;Also, for you people confused with the difference between widescreen and fullscreen, you get a nice demonstration piece to show you the difference.
1160;What Bruce Willis looked like with hair.
1161;How funny it was with great one.
1162;(Yeah, I was one of the first in America to see it, followed by a Q with McTiernan afterwards.)
1163;Another thing that makes this film great is the claustrophobia.
1164;A group of international terrorists, with one goal in mind and a bunch of hostages that will be their ticket to that goal.
1165;the joy of this movie is that it seems every person who speaks in this movie is just as important as the main one, John McClane (Bruce Willis).
1166;From there, the movie lifts your spirits up, crushes them down, and then repeats.
1167;When it's all said and done, you'll have wrapped up quite the satisfying movie experience.
1168;when you see this movie, you'll truly appreciate the action genre again.
1169;very happy with on time delivery.
1170;ray version is the best version around.
1171;What it did do was really bring to life the rest of the movie that was shot in focus.
1172;The other 98% of the movie is done fantastically well.
1173;ray version of Die Hard, a classic movie you can enjoy all year long.
1174;Die Hard is action film director John McTiernan's ( Predator, Die Hard With a Vengeance, The Hunt For Red October, Last Action Hero) best work and is certainly one of the best action films ever made.
1175;Followed by two lesser but good and entertaining sequels, Die Hard 2: Die Harder and Die Hard With a Vengeance.
1176;The basic plot of Die Hard is that NYPD cop John McClane (a great performance by Bruce Willis) comes to L. a. to visit his wife when her office party on the top floor of a 40 story building is crashed by terrorists.
1177;In my opinion he and Simon Gruber (Jeremy Irons) compete to be the best Die Hard villain.
1178;Though there are too many supporting characters, they play their parts well, including Hart Bochner as a smooth.
1179;the skyscraper is an excellent setting, and the explosions and gunfights are nothing short of spectacular.
1180;Oscar nominations for Best Sound, Best Film Editing, Best Sound Effects Editing, and Best Visual Effects by the visual effects maestro Richard Edlund (three Star Wars films, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Ghostbusters, Alien 3, Plotergeist I and II, and 2O1O).
1181;the music is very well done, the cinematography is great, the screenplay is good and has some funny lines, and the makeup is especially outstanding and realistic, showing how it would be if you got shot.
1182;Overall, a groundbreaking action film that is a real treat to watch.
1183;Great holiday flick with some classic lines.
1184;East meets wild west Leonesque dollar.
1185;Die Hard with Bruce Willis as John McClain is the nearly perfect action movie.
1186;Lots of stunts, an interesting storyline and subdued special effects make it fun and exciting.
1187;developed except for Hans, the mastermind played by Alan Rickman.
1188;Just my impressions of the film and the themes presented.
1189;it's great how the mastermind is smarter than everyone else and is less than happy with the guns that he has hired out.
1190;Kinda glad he got snuffed!The most compelling parts of the film deal with the themes of one man against a well.
1191;The 1980s were a great time for action films and Die Hard was one of the more popular and most copied.
1192;I actually just saw this for the first time, and really enjoyed it.
1193;its Christmas,so people expect good will,and presents from each other.
1194;the Leader of the terrorists is Hans Gruber,a well dressed,well spoken recipient of a classical education.
1195;stop display of thrilling action scenes,and a good performance by Bruce Willis as McClane.
1196;alexander Godunov as Gruber's evil sidekick is excellent,displaying a touch of the psychotic.
1197;however,Alan Rickman gives a flawless performance as Hans Gruber,a ruthless,determined,more refined type of terrorist,a performance that literally commands attention,and probably what has become the first thing many people remember,when Die Hard is mentioned.4.5/5 for the film.
1198;perhaps a special edition in the future with more extras,and an enhanced widescreen format (which would benefit both aspects),and a commentary by Director John McTiernan,is something Twentieth Century Fox should consider.
1199;this movie will always have a special place in my heart.
1200;But for those who are unfamiliar here it goes.
1201;John McCLane is a New York Police Officer, he is on his way to Los Angeles to visit his wife and children to celebrate Christmas together.
1202;Die hard till this day is one of the best and probably the best action movie ever made, and it's probably because it's a fresh story, we can relate to the character.
1203;The character is human so it feels real.
1204;These are the qualities that make die hard till this day one of the best action movies of all time.
1205;Both of these men were moving in the direction of comedy and action movies needed something new.
1206;Willis, most famous at the time for the comic T. v. Series 'Moonlighting', made a perfect ordinary.
1207;He blead and felt pain, a first for the genre.
1208;And yet his cool confident delivery of a great wisecracking, intelligent script made him all the cooler.
1209;But most credit should go to Director John McTiernan, king of the sophisticated action flick.
1210;He made action movies slick, smart and full of pace and wit while never letting up on the bullets, cars and bombs front.
1211;Special praise must go out to Alan Rickman too whose performance as chief baddie Hans is to this day one of cinemas finest, moving convincingly from cool, calm and collected to desperate and nervous, never once seeming anything less than utterly ruthless and calculating.
1212;Die Hard is a great movie for a number of reasons but adding three dimensions to the action genre is this films finest achievement and anyone who has not sampled its delights before now would be wise to get a copy as soon as possible.
1213;Sorry, but I personally love anything that features the fabulous Alan Rickman.
1214;Oh well, he makes up for it with his charming, brilliant, witty, evil and romantic body of work!
1215;After all these years, I rewatched Die Hard with my teenage kids, and it still holds up.
1216;Not only did my wife and I feel it was as good as when we first saw it, my kids, really enjoyed it as well.
1217;Bruce Willis will always be one of the great action stars of all time.
1218;Still a great action flick.
1219;Bruce Willis has found a role that he can do well!
1220;I enjoyed this film very much, and found its orginality and cast refreshing.
1221;This film is action packed and entertaining through the end.
1222;We watched it on Christmas eve and had a good old time.
1223;They were on the edge of their seat and they loved every minute of it.
1224;I loved this movie when I first saw it in 1988, and I still love it today.
1225;i am hoping for a 20th anniversary edition, but hey, I shall enjoy this one immensely for many Christmases to come!
1226;This is one of our family favorites.
1227;Any film that inspires copycats and wannabes really does it's job well.
1228;bruce Willis made a very successful transition from the small screen to the big screen as the everyday Joe forced into being the hero.
1229;This film has all the necessary ingredients to qualify it as a great action film.
1230;All you have to do is see it for yourself.
1231;You can come up with good arguments for many action films as to which is the best all time,and this one is no exception.
1232;A great action movie with good stars and still relevant themes.
1233;Cf. Clinton L. Rossiter, Seedtime of the Republic, (NY: Harcourt, Brace and world, Inc., 1953), p. 411.
1234;'Die Hard' is a must see show for anyone who loves action movies.
1235;She has taken a job transfer to Los Angeles.
1236;this is full of excitement from start to finish.
1237;Willis does a great job as the hero.
1238;Reginald Veljohnson is another great character as LA Police Sgt. Al Powell.
1239;Although Powell is not central to the heroics, he is a good addition to the plot helping to inject a little humor and human touch into the show.
1240;this is really a superb show.
1241;Die Hard is an exciting action packed movie directed by John McTiernan (Last Action Hero).
1242;this movie is pure action with a little suspense.
1243;But Willis plays this role well.

1245;If you just want some mindless entertainment with good acting and decent execution, Die Hard fits the bill.
1246;Remarkably fun idea for an action picture.
1247;So many things work so well in this story: Willis is perfect as a cop with a just.

1249;Nevertheless, this is one film to keep you entertained and cheering all the way through.
1250;Go ahead, take the ride!
1251;We see them up close and personal in this movie"
1252;The first Die Hard is still the best.
1253;looking roller coaster ride filled with fantastic stunts and very slick villians, who are so much more interesting than the usual crop of mindless bullies seen in every other shoot.
1254;it's a nice change of pace to see an everyman hero instead of the typical secret agent or military super.
1255;soldier at the center of an action film, it's nice to see an action hero with a sensitive side, and it's also nice to see a villain with a degree of sophistication.
1256;Willis more than proves he can play an action hero and Bedelia adds a welcome degree of charm to the proceedings.
1257;Die Hard was the film that made Bruce Willis a star, and it was a perfect action vehicle for him.
1258;The result is a high.
1259;voltage action/thriller with funny one.
1260;liners, spectacular stuntwork, and tense action sequences.
1261;He then fires at the window of an office and jumps into the room.
1262;That is the most exciting (and scary) action sequence I've ever seen in an action film.
1263;This is one action movie that has a whole lot going for it.
1264;Along with Aliens and Lethal Weapon , it's one of the best action films of the '80s, if not THE best.
1265;Die Hard is an action packed thrill ride from director John Mctiernan(director of Predator,Rollerball,Basic, and Die Hard with a Vengeance).
1266;He meets Nakatomi(Holly's boss) and discuss his business profits.
1267;Bruce Willis steals the show in his breakthrough role.
1268;Bruce Willis is a legit action hero.
1269;Gritty characters, excellent story line and Willis actually shows wear and tear throughout the movie.
1270;If you love action and adventure with a fun character to follow this would be it.
1271;Had to restart and we were able to finish the movie.
1272;And what is it with the walkie.
1273;When it's all said and done, this movie is the modern day equivalent to a Roy Rogers western.
1274;I can just see the director now.
