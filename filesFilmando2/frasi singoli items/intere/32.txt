I:15286;1;Maybe not everyone's cup of tea in terms of premise of film, but Memento is far and away the most inventive crime/thriller film of recent years.
I:15286;2;naturally, the standout feature of this film is the reverse.
I:15286;3;the two male leads receive the bulk of the screen time, with Australia's Guy Pearce handling Leonard Shelby in a particularly strong manner.
I:15286;4;This performance certainly reaffirms his position as one of the better actors of today.
I:15286;5;joe Pantoliano (of Matrix fame) is also superb as the shady Teddy, a man who clearly knows much more than he is letting on.
I:15286;6;Pantoliano is charming enough in the early scenes to set himself up as the good guy, but (and this is far from revealing the plot) is also capable of presenting a very dark side to his character.
I:15286;7;shelby, who often tells the story in an internal monologue (a definite nod to the noir classics), is a mordantly funny character.
I:15286;8;One of the great moments of the film .
I:15286;9;that, after all, is the mark of success of a film noir.
I:15286;10;In the end, that is really up the viewer to decide.
I:15286;11;It is also a particularly effective lesson in telling a story in an unconventional manner.
I:15286;12;If you enjoy trying to work out who the good guy or the bad guy is so you can cheer for him, this is definitely for you.
I:15286;13;If you love film, you have to see this movie.
I:15286;14;So original, but what Christopher Nolan does best as well as in Insomnia, is immerse you in the main character.
I:15286;15;It ruined the whole feel of a very well paced and intriguing movie.
I:15286;16;I would have given it 5 stars for it's unique qualities and ability to draw you in, but the ending was anything but unique.
I:15286;17;I would highly recommend everyone to watch this at least once.
I:15286;18;It is very well done.
I:15286;19;This film takes a certain level of attention and thought to watch.
I:15286;20;I recommend it to most anyone.
I:15286;21;Memento definitely performs in terms of keeping an intelligent and expectful viewer entertained and wondering what's next.
I:15286;22;The acting is magnificent with the exception of Joe Pantolino who plays the greasy mugging role as usual.
I:15286;23;The direction is great and Guy Pearce really captures the character without playing over the top at all.
I:15286;24;wise and getting peanuts in return.
I:15286;25;something several people keep asking.
I:15286;26;the entertainment was 4 stars.
I:15286;27;I love the way how the movie play backwards.
I:15286;28;I watched it a second time and its still great,
I:15286;29;There's a reason we do that.
I:15286;30;the fact that the main character forgets his memory every day is totally clever.
I:15286;31;hahathis whole move is laugh.
I:15286;32;loud funny and ir ecommend it for the whole familyi hear d that the bad guy from the matrix was in this movie but ididnt see him.
I:15286;33;maybe it was just a cameo, but the matrix is such a great movie.
I:15286;34;Memento starring Guy Pearce is such a brainy and sophisticated movie.
I:15286;35;I wasn't sure what to except when I watched it but I was completely fascinated by this little gem of a film.
I:15286;36;The film is shot in black and white and color.
I:15286;37;I highly recommend checking out Memento, I highly recommend checking out Memento.
I:15286;38;Just a little short term memory loss humor for you, enjoy!
I:15286;39;This movie is an example of Filmmaking.
I:15286;40;This is a movie you will continue to talk about and recommend until everyone you know has seen it.
I:15286;41;It's just very well done.
I:15286;42;The performances are great and the unsequential order of the film made an interesting story even better.
I:15286;43;I suggest everyone read the story as well to see how it all began.
I:15286;44;I truly feel this movie should have got more Oscar Noms than it did perhaps for Best Picture.
I:15286;45;Christopher Nolan has proven himself a true Director with this film and Isomnia but credit must also be given to the writer for this film and it's original short story.
I:15286;46;Memento is a perfect thriller it has the twist and turns that are necessary to carry the viewer through the whole flick.
I:15286;47;I just saw Memento and I have to say it is an great film.
I:15286;48;Memento ends as it begins, and the ending you see, before the credits roll, is chronologically the middle point of the story you watch unfold before you on screen.
I:15286;49;Christopher Nolan, his brother, wrote the script and directed the film, this being his second feature.
I:15286;50;I read a few reviews, many better than the one you are reading now.
I:15286;51;if you liked movies like Se7en, and Usual Suspects, than I definitely recommend the film.
I:15286;52;Memento succeeds on many levels.
I:15286;53;It is among the greatest noir films ever made.
I:15286;54;It's got guns, cars, black humor, red herrings, and a femme fatale.
I:15286;55;It outshines Psycho in engaging the audience on a subliminal basis.
I:15286;56;Indeed, as a thriller, it ranks with Hitchcock's best.
I:15286;57;Best of all, it poses a number of profound BIG questions concerning the nature of man, his morality, and the basis for his civilizations and religions in such a subtle way that it almost seems an afterthought.
I:15286;58;Yes, this movie will really make you think.
I:15286;59;And it will make you want to talk to others about it.
I:15286;60;I recommend it to movie buffs.
I:15286;61;The opening, where a Polaroid undevelops, is a classy lead.
I:15286;62;"The plot is mostly told by ending the scene at the beginning of the prior scene
I:15286;63;"Every thing you witnessed since the first shot of the movie is seen in a new light, questions are answered, and new ones are posed
I:15286;64;all this: the style and substance, plot and gimick, performance and editing, together, adds up to one of the best, most distinctive films of 2001.
I:15286;65;Memento is an addictive thriller from the beginning to the end.
I:15286;66;The editing is just incredible and the movie becomes an addictive gem that will surely caught you.
I:15286;67;Memento will become a classic thriller / mystery film.
I:15286;68;Great idea and story from the man that will later on would give us the Batman Trilogy.
I:15286;69;All the cast members give excellent performances, especially Guy Pearce as Leonard, the sufferer of short term memory loss who is investigating his wife's death.
I:15286;70;the plotting is intricate and stylish with the audience put in Leonard's shoes as the story moves backwards, so most of the time we are as in the dark as he is.
I:15286;71;Direction and editing (essential in this reverse storytelling) are very fine.
I:15286;72;This picture is vivid and natural, really top notch in fact.
I:15286;73;similarly the sound is excellent, with the atmospheric score coming across marvellously.
I:15286;74;I reckon a Special Edition could come along eventually.
I:15286;75;The director The Prestige and Batman Begins knows exactly how much information an audience can retain, and structures the film in reverse, slightly overlapping flashbacks.
I:15286;76;it's really cool, and the ending (or beginning I should say) really caught me off guard.
I:15286;77;beautifully executed, this concept, in Memento.
I:15286;78;Brings a whole new meaning to the word suspense.
I:15286;79;But the film is so layered, reverse accumulation.
I:15286;80;guy Pierce turns out another stunning performance.
I:15286;81;I highly reccomend this film.
I:15286;82;Even though it plays out like so many other films do, it does it in such an innovative way when it comes to filmmaking.
I:15286;83;A film of sheer beauty.
I:15286;84;It achieves what so many films of this genre attempt to do, captivate its audience!
I:15286;85;Easily one of the best films of its genre!
I:15286;86;tHE PAIN, THE ANGER, THE FURY, THE SADNESS, AND MOST OF ALL THE REVENGE.
I:15286;87;This movie will keep you guessing all the way through.
I:15286;88;Memento builds itself upon one such tried.
I:15286;89;The only difference is that instead of telling the story in an archetypical revenge tale structure, it is told through an inventive and effective cinematic approach.
I:15286;90;"The way director Christopher Nolan conducts his film calls to mind the cinematic great Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 masterpiece, ""Rear Window""."
I:15286;91;Because of the directors' skillful manipulations, the audiences in both films are able to experience exactly the same frustration, fear, and other mental processes as the protagonists.
I:15286;92;As well, the ambiguous ending gives the film an almost Lynchian hue, which makes this interesting film even more thought provoking.
I:15286;93;Ok, a friend of mine comes to me and lends me a copy of Memento saying that this is a movie you are going to love.
I:15286;94;We know that there will be a special edition eventually with special features, an added scene and, hopefully, a director's commentary.
I:15286;95;the movie deserves five stars
I:15286;96;This was an awesome movie, by far one of the best I've ever seen.
I:15286;97;Christopher Nolan really knew what he was doing.
I:15286;98;The structure of the film itself by going in reverse order adds suspense and really makes you think.
I:15286;99;The second time I watched it and took notes and it made more sense.
I:15286;100;Teddy had Lenny kill people for him.
I:15286;101;Part of me also believes that Lenny really believed that Teddy was the right guy.
I:15286;102;In his head, he has served justice to his wife.
I:15286;103;This is a real mind.
I:15286;104;Excellent acting by the actors and actresses and a really mentally stimulating movie.
I:15286;105;But hey, that's why I love it.
I:15286;106;Guy Pearce perfectly plays Leonard Shelby, a man who has a rare form of amnesia that allows him to remember everything from his past right up until the incident that took his memory away, but makes him forget everything that happened just 15 minutes ago.
I:15286;107;At the film's end, you may still feel bewildered and clueless, but that is what's so great about it .
I:15286;108;Memento has become an instant classic, and was hands.
I:15286;109;down the best film of 2001.
I:15286;110;Once you see the movie, and you will, you'll know what I mean.
I:15286;111;Leonard is driven by revenge .
I:15286;112;His drive and discipline are perverted by Teddy (Pantoliano), by the beautiful Carrie.
I:15286;113;so where does this leave Leonard?Oustanding performances and edge.
I:15286;114;seat suspense spin Memento into a memorable experience.
I:15286;115;the film had a interesting story.
I:15286;116;is this film as good as most people say?four stars from me.
I:15286;117;if you liked the movie you really need to own this version of it!
I:15286;118;Don't have the time to do a proper review, but I do want to say this film is more than worth watching.
I:15286;119;Christopher Nolan creates a tense and riveting atmosphere where the simple search for a writing utensil becomes a mans chance to find his own identity.
I:15286;120;it is a film that resonates with the viewer long after the last reel has played.
I:15286;121;I recommend watching several times to gain insights into the characters and plot.
I:15286;122;"It is an incredibly awesome movie about a man
I:15286;123;the movie starts at the end of the story and goes backward, well sort of.
I:15286;124;do some incredibly interesting and awesome acting to help bring the story to life.
I:15286;125;But we have supressed our memory of having done this!
I:15286;126;"And so we live our lives in noble ""amnesia."""
I:15286;127;This is why this film is brilliant: because of its reverse chronological narrative we are suckered into our protagonists noble mission.
I:15286;128;With all the movies out there that pretty much tell you what to think and feel, this movie is a great escape.
I:15286;129;It's a great murder thriller, a wonderfully acted masterpiece, and a storyline worth your attention.
I:15286;130;of course, the cast is excellent.
I:15286;131;Almost everyone you're introduced to is important and helps the story along.
I:15286;132;again, I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good murder mystery, but isn't afraid to have the movie take you for a whirl before figuring it all out!
I:15286;133;Film noir with a unique narrative device: the story is told starting at the end in short segments in which the story moves forward.
I:15286;134;Nothing in his background makes this action believable.
I:15286;135;tatoos are important in this film.
I:15286;136;He has a tatoo that we've never seen before.
I:15286;137;But ultimately it's a trip not worth taking.
I:15286;138;creative, fresh, interesting, with as many twists and turns to keep you guessing and never for a minute regretting seeing this movie!
I:15286;139;The acting is good, the directing is superior, and the plot keeps you on your toes.
I:15286;140;i don't want to give anything any but the gist is the central character has a unique form of amnesia .
I:15286;141;He has discovered some very creative ways with which to tell himself how the investigation is going.
I:15286;142;the film is played out in an interesting way that can leave you dumbfounded at first, but once you get the hang of how the movie plays out it's easier to follow.
I:15286;143;You may have to watch it twice before it all clicks into place!If you are a fan of twists and turns and an ending that mistifies .
I:15286;144;this is one to see!
I:15286;145;This is probably one of the greatest films in the past ten years, and definatly most original.
I:15286;146;If you enjoy mystery, crime, or psychological thrillers, this is for you.
I:15286;147;This film has one thing that makes it really, truly great .
I:15286;148;"the end clears up the central plot completely and will surprise the audience (MAYBE you can figure the ""what"" but NEVER the ""why"" until the end) while leaving room for interpretation of subplots by the audience."
I:15286;149;the central theme of this film is how we restructure our own past via our memories to make sense of our lives.
I:15286;150;"there is absolutely no atmosphere at all in the main storyline, but the ""flashback"" sequences are stylized based on time, location and condition to help the viewer make sense of the film as a whole."
I:15286;151;"Given some EFFORT, viewers will figure out what is ""true"" in the context of the film."
I:15286;152;the story is told backward, each scene followed by the scene that precedes it chronologically, allowing the viewer to share the main characters disorientation.
I:15286;153;"He keeps himself aware of his progress on the quest for his wifes' killer via scribbled notes, annotated Polaroids and tattoos of the most crucial ""facts"" in his quest."
I:15286;154;It also makes the film hysterically and unexpectedly funny in places.
I:15286;155;The acting is understated .
I:15286;156;"Guy Pearce is perfect trying to convince everyone, himself included, that he ""knows"" what he's doing and has his ""facts"" straight."
I:15286;157;the excellent short story on which the film is based .
I:15286;158;The interview is very good, but the only extra worthy of the name.
I:15286;159;First off, this is probably the best movie I have seen in years.
I:15286;160;This movie will pull you in from the start, mystify you for 113 minutes, and will leave you stunned at the end.
I:15286;161;Leonard (Pearce) is on a personal mission to discover the identity of the man who murdered his wife.
I:15286;162;But to complicate matters, Leonard has a rare memory condition which he recieved the night his wife was killed.
I:15286;163;the story is told in reverse order so the viewer can sympathize with his condition.
I:15286;164;The suspenseful drama that unfolds is like no other you have ever seen.
I:15286;165;It is a unique story in that you know how it ends, but you watch to find out how it began.
I:15286;166;that will make you want to watch it again on the spot.
I:15286;167;this is one of those movies about which you will discover something new each time you watch.
I:15286;168;I watched this movie 4 times during the first week that I owned it, and then let someone borrow it.
I:15286;169;It leaves a very lasting impression.
I:15286;170;I am taking Psychology in college right now, and a chapter we are reading on Memory referred to this movie, so I thought I would check it out.
I:15286;171;I highly recommend it, I know I will be watching it again!
I:15286;172;Memento is an absolutely thrilling movie based on an original screenplay written by Christopher Nolan.
I:15286;173;minute or so segments, exemplifies quiet brilliance in a completely innovative style that replicates the confusing sequences viewed from the perspective of the main character (Guy Pearce).
I:15286;174;Critics rave over the astuteness demonstrated by this film as complex characters reveal new sides of their personality throughout the film.
I:15286;175;the revelations shown in the final seconds weave the finale to the fascinating storyline that will inevitably catapult a chain of similar films to follow.
I:15286;176;In retrospect, the audience can only follow so far as Leonard Shelby can and that's enough to keep you mesmerized in this film for a while to come.
I:15286;177;i give it 3 stars because some parts were good and the concept was interesting.
I:15286;178;really this was truly a unique film, and spellbinding.
I:15286;179;It's so complex, you can't watch it only once.
I:15286;180;You learn something new with every viewing.
I:15286;181;That said, when caught from the very beginning `Memento' is also one of the most enjoyable and richly rewarding films to be watched.
I:15286;182;It's a true stunner of a film, from plot to execution, and is one that will instigate lots of post.
I:15286;183;The direction of the film is a thing of beauty really, and Christopher Nolan has pretty much established himself as one of our greatest new.
I:15286;184;He truly gets into his material and delivers this masterful story in a very unique way which proves to be the grandest embellishment.
I:15286;185;Teddy is, for the sake of discussion, the man who raped and murdered Leonard's wife.
I:15286;186;What makes this direction so interesting is that the film gives you just enough information to keep you guessing.
I:15286;187;It tells you just a little bit and then takes you back and fills you in, leaving new doors open for interpretation before taking you back again and filling you in.
I:15286;188;It's truly a masterpiece of a film and executed so well it's a real shame the academy snubbed Nolan his directing nomination.
I:15286;189;like I mentioned, Pearce is a spectacle in this film, but there are two other performances within `Memento' that deserve attention.
I:15286;190;Moss surprised me here because I'm really not familiar with her work aside from `The Matrix' and a film like `The Matrix' doesn't really allow the actors to shine, but here she delves into the meat of her character and delivers a great performance.
I:15286;191;The real star though, the actor that outshines them all, is Joe Pantoliano of `The Sopranos' fame (yes, that's Ralph).
I:15286;192;As Teddy Joe is spot on and delivers an exciting, fresh and completely absorbing performance.
I:15286;193;It's funny because my wife and I are HUGE `Sopranos' buffs and when we saw `Ralph' we just about died (since his character was one we loathed from start to his finish) but here he completely sheds his `Sopranos' persona and delivers a separate performance altogether and it paid off wonderfully for him.
I:15286;194;`Memento' is a film for the ages.
I:15286;195;There are so many films where one is advised to sit back and turn your mind off but here I'm telling you to sit up and turn your mind on because `Memento' is the type of film that will keep you thinking, keep you guessing, and in the process keep you completely entertained.
I:15286;196;The end, or should I say the beginning, plays out in a wonderfully inventive way that is unexpected yet ultimately rewarding.
I:15286;197;It packs a huge `wow' factor and I just love that about this film.
I:15286;198;I don't want to say too much because I don't want to spoilt he surprise, but just be aware that it's not what you'd expect, and that's a beautiful thing!
I:15286;199;Its packed full of extras but they're so hard to access that it makes the pain in looking for them out weigh any positives.
I:15286;200;He lives by taking photos and keeping notes of his life.
I:15286;201;So he has dedicated his new life to finding.
I:15286;202;All he knows about the man are the few facts that he pulled from the police file from the accident: his name is either John or James, and his surname's initial is G (John or James G.).
I:15286;203;The man has a connection to illegal drugs, and he has a license plate number.
I:15286;204;"this is one of the few thrillers as of late that succeeds in it's mission statement
I:15286;205;This movie came as a huge surprise on me in a very positive way.
I:15286;206;Once in a while there are screenwriters and/or directors who really want to do something extraordinary to impress the viewers of their production.
I:15286;207;As an example, Groundhog Day had the main character relive the same day over and over again for ages until he finally got the girl of his dreams in the end, and it worked.
I:15286;208;"a lot like the main character in ""Memento."
I:15286;209;The story is about insurance investigator Leonard, who suffers from short.
I:15286;210;Leonard got injured after intervening on his wife's murder.
I:15286;211;As much as I would give you some information about this, you really have to see the movie for yourself to actually understand what a gem this really is.
I:15286;212;"The tension curve is always rising, with an ending so surprisingly good that this movie is up there with stunners like aforementioned ""The Usual Suspects"" and ""Fight Club."
I:15286;213;A brilliant work of storytelling which immerses the viewer into the life of a man with a severe memory problem, called anterograde memory loss.
I:15286;214;the disorientating method of the presentation of the movie sequences allows the viewer to experience first hand the challenges he faces.
I:15286;215;this is a truly ingenious movie with rich characters, superb acting, and directorial excellence.
I:15286;216;I recommend it to anyone with high expectations for a movie.
I:15286;217;The idea behind the movie is amazing .
I:15286;218;taking the whole story backwards.
I:15286;219;and the part when the present and past (the backward story and the frontward story) connect is shown brilliantly.
I:15286;220;and so he makes notes, tattoos his body, and uses polaroids to assist him.
I:15286;221;And I re saw the movie the next day to understand it better.
I:15286;222;it was more fun the second time .
I:15286;223;how many movies can you see two times and say .
I:15286;224;I'll make it simple: This is one of the most fascinating films to come around in recent times (perhaps ever?)
I:15286;225;One of the few that I could describe as mind.
I:15286;226;blowing with a straight face.
I:15286;227;The script is snappy and the cast is top.
I:15286;228;The backwards storytelling may be just a gimmick, but it's quite a clever one, especially in the context of this story.
I:15286;229;This is the kind of movie that makes you feel like part of a secret club after watching it.
I:15286;230;The kind you implore all your friends to see.
I:15286;231;The kind that'll haunt you.
I:15286;232;It's simply beautiful, flawless, confusing, scary, perfect,.
I:15286;233;I love it when that happens!
I:15286;234;"Pay attention to the tiny details
I:15286;235;"i recommend that you watch carefully and with patience
I:15286;236;A refreshing film that will restore your hope in modern film making and story writing.
I:15286;237;Memento is a perfect film.
I:15286;238;guy Pearce gives a most underrated performance as Leonard Shelby .
I:15286;239;Probably the best movie of this year, there is no doubt in my mind that it's at least worthy of contention in that category.
I:15286;240;It also has the standard trailers.
I:15286;241;You go to a movie to be entertained.
I:15286;242;a rare treat in today's market.
I:15286;243;Guy Pearce is excellent, and Carrie Anne Moss is so cunningly evil in this picture.
I:15286;244;while I highly recommend this picture to anyone, I'd hesitate in recommending it to those who watch pictures passively, those who look for a story .
I:15286;245;a plot, to sustain their attention.
I:15286;246;In any case, it's definitely worth watching at least once.
I:15286;247;The film continues to astound and baffle its viewers with its complex structure and gripping storyline.
I:15286;248;"the story of ""Memento"" revolves around its three main characters, Leonard, Natalie, and Teddy, who are played by Guy Pearce, Carrie."
I:15286;249;Christopher Nolan uses this disability to his advantage, allowing him to play with ideas of constructed truth and uncertainties as the movie progresses.
I:15286;250;the backward sequence of events is one of the film's most innovative elements and makes certain surprises even more astonishing to the audience.
I:15286;251;It also forces the audience to rely on their own memory to make sense of the plot, which is a great parallelism that heightens the enjoyability of the movie.
I:15286;252;"The use of ""memory"" is one of the film's most noteworthy innovations, but it is only second to the film's complex narrative structure and suggestive postmodern themes that truly set it apart from other films."
I:15286;253;even though the film is very innovative, it can be easily viewed as regurgitated film noir with a new spin.
I:15286;254;Memento fits these characteristics, as it concerns itself with this specific tone and mood.
I:15286;255;good movies, you might want to sit this one out.
I:15286;256;This will drive some of you insane, but for those of you that enjoy figuring out things for yourself and left with your own interpretations of the movie, then you should definitely watch this flick.
I:15286;257;Although the movie breaks numerous movie norms, I found that it is the movie's obscurity that makes it such a beautiful and noteworthy accomplishment.
I:15286;258;"fartsy, and so on
I:15286;259;what it does, it does really well, and the performances of the stellar cast are nuanced, memorable, and overall quite excellent.
I:15286;260;film school students: let your hair down and enjoy this one, it's actually very entertaining, very accessible, and at the same time difficult enough that you can admit you liked it.
I:15286;261;Hollywood buffs: just once, pay close attention to a film .
I:15286;262;Its got trailers and an interview with Christopher Nolan, but that's about it.
I:15286;263;RegressionI picked this topic to speak on when I remembered laughing at myself the night my film class and I watched Memento, a movie based on Memento Mori, the name of the short story.
I:15286;264;He is the main character of Memento.
I:15286;265;By the time he got done with the movie, he was quite a unique individual.
I:15286;266;movie critics are important to movies.
I:15286;267;They make important decisions in front of viewers or readers everywhere.
I:15286;268;They are so engaging, they occasionally get to be Roger Ebert and Leonard Maltin.
I:15286;269;The best jigsaw puzzles are the ones with a few pieces missing.
I:15286;270;All anyone has to do is tell a good story.
I:15286;271;People have a motivation that's in the subconscious mind, and people understand by drawing conclusions in places where there are no real explanations.
I:15286;272;i bought the movie because I'm a good student to my college course.
I:15286;273;the order in which I put my story is important to the theme.
I:15286;274;After all, when he found my diary, he thought it was his.
I:15286;275;That'll never happen to Leonard because he developed a special system.
I:15286;276;Such an amazing piece of film.
I:15286;277;I love this movie and find myself always coming back to it every few months to watch again!
I:15286;278;The fact is, this movie works on many levels.
I:15286;279;The writing is tack sharp.
I:15286;280;It's a classic noir thriller and a variation on the con.
I:15286;281;But it's also a metaphysical examination of the nature of memory.
I:15286;282;This film is a testament to the thesis that we create our realities .
I:15286;283;It is really well done.
I:15286;284;This is his theme and his tatoos help piece together this puzzle.
I:15286;285;aCTORS:Guy Pearce memorable in L. A. Confidential as the rule.
I:15286;286;He does an admirable job showing the confusion of a young man with a brain disorder that literally forces him to live in the moment.
I:15286;287;Who does a guy with no memory trust?NOT A MOVIE TO RELAX BY, BUT UNIQUELY ENJOYABLE:If you want to think, this is a great movie.
I:15286;288;Great a weirdly unfolding movie.
I:15286;289;Then when a couple of things happened that I didn't expect, it really got my attention.
I:15286;290;Give it at least 1/2 hour to get yours.
I:15286;291;'The cast is exceptional, Guy Pearce in particular, and traditional film noir elements are executed very well, with haunting music, taut cinematography, smart dialogue, effective voiceover, and a constant search for motive.
I:15286;292;This is really an editor's film, and Dody Dorn deserves an Oscar nomination for editing this gem.
I:15286;293;Though operationally a bit buggy, cinematically and artistically the special features are creative and fun.
I:15286;294;For instance, interesting scenes run behind the menus, and many film clips appear framed as Polaroid camera shots, both fun to watch and relevant to the film's concept.
I:15286;295;I would also have liked to have seen behind.
I:15286;296;this is a great film to watch with a group (as long as they don't talk during the film) so you can talk about it afterward.
I:15286;297;Nolan and crew can be proud of this fine film.
I:15286;298;appart from that, the production, acting, scripting, filming, etc. are very good.
I:15286;299;It took a few minutes to get it but when I did, and grew comfortable with the pattern, it was a good watch.
I:15286;300;This movie avoided that dilemma with a catchy dialogue, good actors and an even, arching direction that brought the entire story into focus.
I:15286;301;It took a few minutes to get it but when I did, and grew comfortable with the pattern, it was a good watch.
I:15286;302;This movie avoided that dilemma with a catchy dialogue, good actors and an even, arching direction that brought the entire story into focus.
I:15286;303;He can only remember events up to that incident.
I:15286;304;'Memento' is a rarity: it's a great action film, a suspense film, and a mystery.
I:15286;305;But that's not all: the characters are interesting, the acting is excellent, and the movie makes you think.
I:15286;306;The film is so good I watched it twice and will probably watch it again.
I:15286;307;The film entertains and causes you to examine and evaluate your own memory.
I:15286;308;The film also contains the best last line of the year.
I:15286;309;well it's not really a thriller, maybe it fits into the film.
I:15286;310;The story and the editing are just incredible.
I:15286;311;If you like movies that lets you form your own opinions about the characters and about reality and the many interpretations it can have, well, this movie is for you.
I:15286;312;It's a really good movie, and they do a good job of making everything as clear to you as it is to the main character, Leonard.
I:15286;313;"He is constantly ""reawakening"" due to his medical condition, and usually it is with figurative egg/pie/shaving cream on his face."
I:15286;314;This is simply an Awesome movie from start to finish.
I:15286;315;Well acted, well put together, well everything.
I:15286;316;"Christopher Nolan also made the movie ""Insomnia"" which was just released in theatres a while back also well worth checking out."
I:15286;317;This movie is probably the most fun i've had the movies in years.
I:15286;318;The plot draws you in, Guy Pierce's performances keeps you in, and the questions left by the movie's ending leave you wanting to see it again.
I:15286;319;In conclusion, Memento is an experience, and one not soon to be outdone.
I:15286;320;The editing style alone gives it 5 stars but also, the unique story and wonderful script make this film one of the best in the year 2001.
I:15286;321;done and Guy Pierce does a great job playing the lead character.
I:15286;322;This was an exceptionally good movie.
I:15286;323;Maybe the best I've watched this year.
I:15286;324;Well written and a constant surprise.
I:15286;325;good to own a copy as it is re.
I:15286;326;This was an amazing movie.
I:15286;327;After watching it, all I have to say is genius.
I:15286;328;But if you love a movie that challenges you, get this movie.
I:15286;329;Memento is simply amazing .
I:15286;330;The performances are outstanding all round .
I:15286;331;Guy Pearce as lead character Lenny is perfectly cast as the confused, vengeful husband.
I:15286;332;anne Moss as the sexy bartender are also brilliant: Moss in particular seems to relish her role.
I:15286;333;about the human condition, reliability of memory, the power of relationships and context and the confusion of the mental conditions.
I:15286;334;It is tough work to follow at times, but the satisfaction gained from thinking about the movie makes it one of the best movies of the last 5 years.
I:15286;335;This movie is so great.
I:15286;336;If you are frustated by watching this movie you need to see it again and pay careful attention.
I:15286;337;It is hard for some people to understand but is very rewarding after you grasp everything that is happening.
I:15286;338;Bottom line: Memento is a wonderful mystery.
I:15286;339;Even after you have solved it you will be able to gather more clues with every viewing.
I:15286;340;Momento is great, it really does keep you guessing until the end.
I:15286;341;written, has an interesting story that is told, and it put together fantastically.
I:15286;342;If you want to watch something entertaining and intellectually.
I:15286;343;If he had a debt to repay in terms of movie recommendations, he has done so in full.
I:15286;344;If you can get into the characters, you will be well rewarded for it.
I:15286;345;Very few movies with such pretensions are actually cool BEFORE you know what's going on.
I:15286;346;all you have to do is confuse your audience and they'll have to watch the movie again.
I:15286;347;In the first viewing, quite a few iffy movies manage to entertain.
I:15286;348;"Memento is one of my favorite ""hidden gems"" of 2001, and similar to movies like ""Fight Club"", ""The Usual Suspects"", and ""Dark City"", it stands out as one of the most unique."
I:15286;349;"what is most interesting about ""Memento"" is the style in which it was filmed."
I:15286;350;The movie starts at the ending, and moves backwards to show how things got to this point.
I:15286;351;"The experience one gets from watching ""Memento"" is similar to what Shelby experiences in the movie."
I:15286;352;A surreal trip, which leaves you dumbfounded at the end.
I:15286;353;"the acting in ""Memento"" is first rate."
I:15286;354;"Guy Pearce is a very reliable and versatile actor, and this is his best role since ""LA Confidential""."
I:15286;355;Support comes from two very talented actors, Joe Pantoliano and Carrie.
I:15286;356;Joe Pantoliano, oddly enough, further pushes his trademark.
I:15286;357;Where the movie really stands out is the direction, which is a fresh approach on a very old concept (one man's revenge caper).
I:15286;358;True, you must pay attention while watching, otherwise you will get lost.
I:15286;359;"But I encourage you to watch ""Memento"" with an open mind, it is a very rewarding experience."
I:15286;360;a true collaboration with his biological brothers in vision .
I:15286;361;Everybody knows the setup right.
I:15286;362;"as an ""existential"" redressing of the balance of the crime."
I:15286;363;"My wife won't be avenged until her murderer is dead
I:15286;364;The really important stuff he gets tattooed on so that nobody can deprive him of it.
I:15286;365;He takes polaroids of important people and places and writes cryptic descriptions on them.
I:15286;366;It's all a way of keeping himself vital.
I:15286;367;he actually fares pretty well, all things considered.
I:15286;368;"Naturally, inevitably, he does get swindled in spite of his constant and justifiable paranoia, and because ""Memento"" is a film noir, of course the swindler (well, one of them) is a femme fatale, a spider woman in the grand tradition, played brilliantly by Carrie."
I:15286;369;"The scene with Moss (Natalie"") where she shows her true colors, knowing that she can say whatever she wants without consequence, is almost as hilarious as it is vicious and intense and believable."
I:15286;370;"And the whole movie is composed of similar ""real"" moments ."
I:15286;371;and the way it's edited is perfect.
I:15286;372;it's a device, but it works.
I:15286;373;It was a great story and the way it was told kind of made me lose track of how long I'd been watching it.
I:15286;374;The film itself is a milestone in the annals of innovative storytelling.
I:15286;375;The movie has a noble plot.
I:15286;376;As someone with not so great memory I can relate the issue and it was interesting it to imagine what would it look like if you had to cope with a serious case.
I:15286;377;It's a thriller, you can't expect a lot of correspondence to a real case but I enjoyed watching it.
I:15286;378;This is an edge of your seat thriller produced with an amazing way of storytelling.
I:15286;379;Memento is a great movie.
I:15286;380;I watched this expecting unique storytelling and a great climax.
I:15286;381;while Memento was unique, it was also quite humorous.
I:15286;382;Guy Pierce did an excellent job of portraying Lenny.
I:15286;383;so while this movie is dark at its core, it portrays an innocence and lightheartedness that makes it fun to watch.
I:15286;384;It gives a lot of good information that may shed light on Lenny's condition.
I:15286;385;But what I got was an interesting premise and a well acted film.
I:15286;386;The movie was intriguing, but the only complaint I have is that is was to complex.
I:15286;387;Overall it was an enjoyable movie, but no masterpiece.
I:15286;388;So I bought it and I loved it, now I'm looking for his first film .
I:15286;389;which I can't but so far memento is absolutely amazing!
I:15286;390;He seems like he only directs movies with characters of truly very unique situations so Batman is a perfect fit for this future king of film!
I:15286;391;If you heard of memento then I suggest you see it because it is a film unlike any other that I have ever laid eyes on for a long time.
I:15286;392;If you enjoy a thought provoking film, Christopher Nolan is the way to go.
I:15286;393;And this film doesn't disappoint.
I:15286;394;Guy Pearce and Joe Pantoliano turn in great performances as a man with no short.
I:15286;395;Memento is one of the most captivating movies I have ever seen.
I:15286;396;Memento pulls it off beautifully with strong performances from the three key actors, Guy Pearce, Carrie Anne Moss, and Joe Pantoliano.
I:15286;397;memento is my favorite movie from 2001!!!
I:15286;398;This is a thoroughly original movie.
I:15286;399;"Guy Pierce was convincing as the ""guy with the memory thing"" and Carrie Ann Moss was sweet with a hint of something you can't quite put your finger on."
I:15286;400;"Joe Pantoliano was great as the ""good cop ."
I:15286;401;This movie kept me guessing right up to an ending that could have easily come from a John Carpenter flick.
I:15286;402;I intend to watch it again with friends who couldn't make the first screening.
I:15286;403;but the editor here was an absolute genius.
I:15286;404;the movie shows us Leonard's story from end to beginning so it's easy to get caught up in the strange loops of the narrative.
I:15286;405;The inverted sequence drives the story in ways that make events flow in a way we can follow, but also hits us with sudden ambushes.
I:15286;406;Memento puts us inside the mind of a man whose mind can't work right.
I:15286;407;the best illustration of this occurs some way through the movie.
I:15286;408;even if told in a normal sequence, Memento has layers beyond the story line.
I:15286;409;A pretty dark take on human nature.
I:15286;410;in medias res starting the story in the middle is an effective to tell a story.
I:15286;411;Memento may begin at the end, but it constantly keeps us in the middle of things.
I:15286;412;The rare experience it provides is good reason to see it.
I:15286;413;The movie was enjoyable, good performance by pierce.
I:15286;414;shot in an unusual style in that the movie develops much like the photographs the main character takes to help with his memory, slowly and partially.
I:15286;415;I've explained it remarkably bad but it really is ingenious, and a crucial subplot intersects these scenes giving a nice background and an unusual twist to the overall story, as well as providing a slight relief from all the head.
I:15286;416;the cast headed by Guy Pearce is generally very very good and Guy himself shows why he won rave reviews after L. a Confidential with another excellent performance.
I:15286;417;The direction is pretty slick and extremely sly and all credit must go to the makers not just for thinking up such an intelligent story but for comitting it to film and making it work.
I:15286;418;that aside if your prepared to work with the film to its conclusion and to keep your eyes open and your mind on the plot then its an extremely rewarding experience, one that will have you gasping, full of admiration for all the players involved and with a head full of questions to which there is no answer other than possibly watching again.
I:15286;419;The sort of film you watch and immediatly want to talk about to anyone else who has seen it, and restores faith that sometimes you can get an intricate story from somewhere other than a book.
I:15286;420;good movie of the decade.
I:15286;421;but a editing masterpiece regardless!
I:15286;422;The truth is that the director made this movie solely for the fact to say Im smarter than all of you, so im going to make a movie that none of you can understand so ill look like the genius And Another Thing, the reason this movie won so many awards makes sense because if you think about it, the average movie critic sees over 1000 movies each year.
I:15286;423;He sees a lot of action, comedy, thrillers, and romantic movies.
I:15286;424;Definitely the type of movie that demands your full attention from start to finish.
I:15286;425;The movie combines fascinating psychological speculations with a gritty detective mystery.
I:15286;426;Even though the story moves in reverse, from end to beginning, clever editing makes it comprehensible.
I:15286;427;As Guy Pearce gropes through his nightmare, it is really possible for you to feel what it's like to live without memories.
I:15286;428;Lots of plot twists, a few loose ends, but enouch clarity to leave you satisfied at the end.
I:15286;429;This is an awesome movie and I'm sure you can find many positive reviews for it already.
I:15286;430;The picture looks great the movie sounds very good.
I:15286;431;The format of the movie is such that it would work that way as well.
I:15286;432;But, hey, the film is fantastic and once again.
I:15286;433;Now, the plot of this movie is good, but what Christophe Nolan has done, was take a seemingly normal plot and made it into a story that keeps you guessing and intrigued when the answer is really easy to see had it been in a linear style.
I:15286;434;the movie is good because it is done so well.
I:15286;435;Nolan is an important new director.
I:15286;436;"His first film is a great independent debut, and ""Memento"" made him big, and now he's directing big bidget films like ""Insomnia."""
I:15286;437;This film is worth seeing multiple times.
I:15286;438;Memento is a must see.
I:15286;439;It has a great twist that I can watch over and over.
I:15286;440;Memento is the ultimate movie lovers flick.
I:15286;441;It incorporates the best aspects of classic film noir (circa early 1950s) and turns it on its head with the clever trick of presenting the narrative in reverse.
I:15286;442;"When the truth is revealed, the ""ending"" takes on a whole new meaning."
I:15286;443;"guy Pearce, the ""other"" Australian actor in ""L. a. Confidential"" emerges from Russell Crowe's shadow with an outstanding performance as the tormented Lenny."
I:15286;444;"well scripted, well acted, and challengely put togather, ""Memento"" was the best American movie of 2001."
I:15286;445;After adding my five stars to the well.
I:15286;446;After thoroughly enjoying the movie twice as presented, using the chapter select feature I watched it once more.
I:15286;447;the main character, Leonard, wants revenge for the murder of his wife.
I:15286;448;To aid him, he makes notes, takes photographs, and gives himself tattoos, so that he knows what he has seen and what he is doing.
I:15286;449;This question almost destroys the otherwise excellent plot.
I:15286;450;if you discount the flaw, however, and just accept that he just knows, then you are left with a smart and adventurous movie.
I:15286;451;The acting is excellent, and the method of story.
I:15286;452;ulitmately, this is a great movie, that is taken down just a bit by a slip up in writing.
I:15286;453;It is well worth the money spent on it, and will provide a thought.
I:15286;454;It's one of the greatest films ever, in my opinion.
I:15286;455;every great director has at least one defining film.
I:15286;456;so I was anxious to see where Nolan really established himself in Hollywood.
I:15286;457;it's one of the more artful films I've seen in recent memory.
I:15286;458;it has a ton of twists and turns.
I:15286;459;how the story is told is simply masterful, I can see a lot of Inception in this movie.
I:15286;460;this one is about as perfect as it gets.
I:15286;461;stunning from first frame to last.
I:15286;462;moss really shine and deliver top notch performances.
I:15286;463;therein lies the crux of Memento , a quietly brilliant film by Christopher Nolan.
I:15286;464;rate actors, headed by Guy Pearce in a mesmerizing performance as Leonard Shelby.
I:15286;465;driven, tormented, with a sallow, haunted visage that is maintained throughout the film.
I:15286;466;And can we always believe in the truth of that reflection?)
I:15286;467;everyone should see this movie.
I:15286;468;Memento is one of the most complex movies ever seen.
I:15286;469;the film is about a man with a sickness that affect his memory.
I:15286;470;The film is played backwards, something that gives the film an interesting, unusual perspective.
I:15286;471;This movie is hands down the best movie of 2001.
I:15286;472;A true mind bending experience that has you second guessing yourself everytime.
I:15286;473;chris Nolan's direction is superb and innovative.
I:15286;474;The flick has a great leading man in Guy Pearce.
I:15286;475;He turns in one of the best performances of 2001.
I:15286;476;The supporting players are cool, Carrie Ann Moss delivers a solid performance.
I:15286;477;this was one of the best flicks of 2001.
I:15286;478;With 590 reviews out there, I'm sure someone has already revealed the great secret behind these mind.
I:15286;479;bending challenges , but I'm going to do it once again so it will be up front and easy to spot for all those frustrated kids.
I:15286;480;Sooner or later, but guaranteed to work, you will get to the feature you were looking for.
I:15286;481;But the most simple and effective way is taking the ol' straight narrow.
I:15286;482;On the one hand, I think the menu design and test questions are interesting and fairly entertaining.
I:15286;483;switch on this amazing and mind.
I:15286;484;It came in great shape.
I:15286;485;See the movie in forward and the other puzzles on disk tow were well worth the price.
I:15286;486;Christopher Nolan makes a quirky offbeat film that has a catch.
I:15286;487;You must be an experienced and seasoned film goer to appreciate and perhaps like it.
I:15286;488;he laughs in the face of conventions and goes for broke.
I:15286;489;What we get is a satisfying movie that doesn't take itself too seriously.
I:15286;490;Memento is not the only movie about time manipulations, but it is probably the best one.
I:15286;491;When you are watching it you put yourself in the shoes of the main character (Lenny) then you keep forgetting like he does.
I:15286;492;Memento, this movie is unique.
I:15286;493;But how can he accomplish that with his condition?
I:15286;494;leonard is very organized, he can take notes and take pictures so he can remember who is who.
I:15286;495;He takes pictures of all of his contacts.
I:15286;496;As he goes through his quest he is getting closer and closer he also gets tricked, people can take advantage of someone who wont remember you.
I:15286;497;it's a great movie, period.
I:15286;498;But it's an incredible story line, very well written, excellent acting.
I:15286;499;one striking thing about the movie is that Leonard's (the main character's) condition is a mirror of how many people go through life.
I:15286;500;I found the movie very inspiring, although in a strange way.
I:15286;501;The more I watch this movie the better it gets.
I:15286;502;Every time I watch this movie the stars go up.
I:15286;503;I'm stopping when it gets to five stars!
I:15286;504;For me, that's what made it so interesting.
I:15286;505;I am forced to see the Memento 40 times with the same scenes over and over again but this movie is fun to see.
I:15286;506;I give it five stars because it is not boring, and it is very funny sometimes.
I:15286;507;A wild ride of a movie, done is a calm methodical way.
I:15286;508;the more important things in his life he tatoos on himself.
I:15286;509;For an added thrill the movie shows scenes from the most recent back to the begining so in a way you are like the main character, you don't know what went on before.
I:15286;510;I love this movie because it definitely makes you think.
I:15286;511;Guy Pearce does a great job with his character and taking you along for the ride.
I:15286;512;As a medical doctor with a neuroscience degree, I very much appreciated the intracacies of this psychological thriller which has a very real basis!
I:15286;513;This is an incredible mind trip done in an extremely creative fashion.
I:15286;514;a fashion that puts you in the main character (patient's) shoes!
I:15286;515;I imagine everybody knows what Memento is about by now, so I will be brief: Leonard, who can't make new memories due to a brain trauma, is on the trail of his wife's killer.
I:15286;516;The characters are fascinating, with constant surprises (who CAN you trust, the movie asks).
I:15286;517;There's a delicious sense of disorientation caused by the backward movement, because we don't know any more than Leonard does how he got into each new situation.
I:15286;518;I have an extremely hard time picking my favorite movie ever, because I keep changing my mind, but Memento has a very legitimate shot at getting the number one spot forever.
I:15286;519;original story told in an innovative and original way with extraordinary acting (Guy Pearce and Joey Pants both deserve Oscars), and the best ending since The Usual Suspects (okay, maybe The Sixth Sense too).
I:15286;520;I went with high expectations of seeing something that wasn't retreaded Hollywood garbage, that was an exciting thriller with a real story, good action without overdone special effects and with real acting.
I:15286;521;But after watching Memento a 2nd and 3rd time, I found myself liking it more and more.
I:15286;522;What a great idea to run a movie backwards!
I:15286;523;One of my favorite movies.
I:15286;524;Christopher Nolan has crafted an excellent modern film noir (a genre that is basically as dead as the western).
I:15286;525;The central performances are emotionally engaging and taut.
I:15286;526;One of the better films I've seen in several years.
I:15286;527;The structure of the film is brilliant.
I:15286;528;Only when prior scenes are revealed are we able to understand the motives and actions of the characters.
I:15286;529;Pearce is really good in this, and though the premise has a built in catch.
I:15286;530;since he can't remember anything he continuously says the same things and tells the same stories until the people he meets and the audience are both totally fed up.
I:15286;531;i enjoyed his performance a lot.
I:15286;532;it also makes us doubt the veracity of his subjective view of reality.
I:15286;533;And if he does get revenge, how will he enjoy that dish.
I:15286;534;Such elevated concepts and questioning of the very nature of reality are the hallmarks of Nolan's films.
I:15286;535;He is a rare director who can both toy with philosophy and a big budget, and still fill the seats.
I:15286;536;An art house director whose films are blockbusters.
I:15286;537;Memento, while certainly no blockbuster, was at least successful enough to allow him to keep making films.
I:15286;538;It alternates between flashback scenes, which are in black and white, and color scenes that are present time, moving forward.
I:15286;539;I didn't realize this particular scene until my 4th viewing, but darn it, it was brilliant!
I:15286;540;This may well develop a cult following.
I:15286;541;I would say that this is the most original movie I have seen in a while and by far the best movie I saw come out of 2000.
I:15286;542;Great screenplay, acting was right on and (most importantly) the movie genuinely allows us to see what it is like to be the protagonist, Mr. Shelby.
I:15286;543;NOTE: You will HAVE to watch this movie more the once to understand it all.
I:15286;544;Memento is, in many ways, a classic hard.
I:15286;545;putting the film together in reverse order is a clever tactic that would be nothing more than a gimmick if it wasn't put together so carefuly.
I:15286;546;What saves the film from being more than just a cinematic trick is some excellent directing and a terrific cast.
I:15286;547;Guy Pearce is brilliant as the befuddled Leonard, so sure of his path even though he can't remember how he got there.
I:15286;548;Put together, the cast provides a realistic, grounded performance in a situation that could easily fall into clich and dramatic tricks.
I:15286;549;This is an excellent movie with a fascinating mystery that unfolds in a unique way.
I:15286;550;boiled detective stories and film noir, Memento does it all and makes it look easy.
I:15286;551;We gave this movie to our son for Christmas last year and he loved it!
I:15286;552;As long as he liked it, that is what mattered!
I:15286;553;This is one of a new line of (future) classic movies of the last 5.10 years.
I:15286;554;The film has a couple twists throughout, but the main course is the ending (or should I say beginning).
I:15286;555;"The best of which is a version of the movie in the ""correct"" chronological order."
I:15286;556;This version is almost as good as the original movie!
I:15286;557;it basically comes down to this: if you like your movies on the edge, innovative and little off kilter, this is the movie for you.
I:15286;558;All in all, this was one of thebest of 2001 and I say A+ and highly recommend this movie!
I:15286;559;It was nice and interesting.
I:15286;560;I choose to watch this movie, based on the good reviews of this movie in amazon.
I:15286;561;after you come back from a good day of work, you want to relax with a nice movie, and after watching this movie, I feel terrible.
I:15286;562;this movie is a must.
I:15286;563;have for anyone that appreciates fine film.
I:15286;564;Christopher Nolan is a genius.
I:15286;565;What he's done here is take a gimmick and imbue it with deeper meaning than it was meant to have.
I:15286;566;"it is this hook of the ""unreliable narrator"" that makes the movie endlessly fascinating."
I:15286;567;nolan has reinvigorated film noir as a style for illustratingmodern ills.
I:15286;568;this has become one of my top five films ever.
I:15286;569;Not for those who want instant gratification or are easily frustrated, but lots of fun to those of us who like to stoke the paranoid atmosphere of the movie before watching.
I:15286;570;christopher Nolan is the new post modern Hitchcock.
I:15286;571;a classic in every sense.
I:15286;572;Each moment is a little mystery to him, and to the audience.
I:15286;573;A system of notes and tattoos that he has given himself add meaning to his life, as he is in fact pursuing his wife's killer.
I:15286;574;Each scene is actually the scene before the last, given in reverse order, and each explains what you saw before while introducing a new mystery.
I:15286;575;It all wraps up into a mind.
I:15286;576;blowing ending, the biggest mystery of them all.
I:15286;577;it may sound confusing, but it all works, and Memento is fascinating to watch 2, 3 times or more.
I:15286;578;Once you've figured out the mystery of who everyone is and what is going on (which can take you a couple of viewings) then you can watch this film just for its wonderful insight into human nature.
I:15286;579;This is the absolute best film for peering into the mind of the mentally ill, 'cause for our hero, nothing is wrong except his one weakness, and he tries to compensate for it with intelligence and routine.
I:15286;580;the story is told through Leonard, a man who is looking for the killer of his wife.
I:15286;581;The man who killed his wife also stole Leonard's memory as well, and his mission is to find the man who did it.
I:15286;582;Guy Pierce does an amazing job of playing the helpless Leonard, while Carrie.
I:15286;583;Not only that, but there is a powerful message in this movie as to what motivates a man to continue living after he has lost everything.
I:15286;584;Memento gives you an answer at the beginning and leaves you asking questions.
I:15286;585;disc 2 allows a chronological option.
I:15286;586;As you click through the menus, you'll be told to put a sequence of a woman changing her tire in order.
I:15286;587;carrie anne moss also gives a great perfomance.
I:15286;588;The film receives Two Oscar Nominations from Best Editing and Best Original Screenplay.
I:15286;589;Memento did win Four Independent Spirit Awards including:Best Director, Best Feature, Best Screenplay and Best Suppporting Actress:Carrie Anne.
I:15286;590;This is a well written mystery suspense thriller.
I:15286;591;Some might find this film to be uneven, because the film is told in backwards (Expect for the Black and White Flashbacks) and it`s not for all tastes but Still, this is a one of a kind movie.
I:15286;592;I really enjoy this movie, every time I watch it.
I:15286;593;provoking and it is presented in such a cool and original way.
I:15286;594;The directors did a great job in modeling the sequence of the movie (backwards) after his memory problem.
I:15286;595;It is one of those movies you can't really figure out until it's over and then you can sit with your friends and put all the pieces together for a few minutes, which I've done every time I show it to one of my friends.
I:15286;596;Then I finally watched it and I was very impressed.
I:15286;597;"I just loved how after the first scene he shoots the dude and immediately you think, ""well he must be the bad guy"", and you think that for the whole movie."
I:15286;598;is he?If you like movies that are hard to predict and keep you thinking right up to the end, here's your movie.
I:15286;599;So take my word for it, check it out, enjoy it, and tell your friends about it.
I:15286;600;There has never been a movie that has so completely kept my attention as Memento.
I:15286;601;You will want to see it again and again.
I:15286;602;This movie will keep you guessing and wondering every second until the very end.
I:15286;603;It is the coolest looking set I have ever bought.
I:15286;604;Not only that but Memento is a great movie that you have to watch 3 or 4 times to really get (and then watch it backwards to go deeper).
I:15286;605;it's a truly remarkable piece of film.
I:15286;606;Its really a great bit of writing, directing, and acting.
I:15286;607;Though it requires the audience to focus more than some clean cut action movie, it is much more rewarding with the interesting production tools that go into it.
I:15286;608;For starters, the up is that the case is very cool and unique.
I:15286;609;click here or special features here!
I:15286;610;They make you go through some memory games, but, if you know how to find the easter eggs, you'll access some really cool features.
I:15286;611;I must admit Memento won't be everyone's cup of tea, but I honestly think that this is one of the best movies ever made.
I:15286;612;"I see Memento as a perfect circle
I:15286;613;The more you watch the movie the more answers you will have, but at the same time still more questions will arise.
I:15286;614;to keep us entertained after multiple viewings?
I:15286;615;If you love movies and havent seen this one yet .
I:15286;616;As great as this movie is.
I:15286;617;that being said, I'll tell you why I see it as a WOW!
I:15286;618;Christopher Nolan has created a piece that is unmatched in it's originally and is on par with 'The Usual Suspects' in terms of storytelling at it's finest.
I:15286;619;The script is tight, and the performances (Guy Pearce.
I:15286;620;the fact this film is told backwards gives you an intimate 'bond' with the protagonist, in that you can't remember what happened before either, and this adds a dimension that few films can project.
I:15286;621;this is a true gem of a film that it's a shame it didn't get more buzz early on.
I:15286;622;It looks great and also has very goog content.
I:15286;623;the disc two is the best way to enjoy and understand the movie.
I:15286;624;A movie that starts you off with the last chronological event and working backwards.
I:15286;625;So to help him out, he takes pictures of places and pictures with notes in order to keep track of who's who and who to trust.
I:15286;626;it got quite a lot of attention due to the rather unorthodox way of showing a film(final scene first, first scene last in a time aspect), and also its twist at the end.
I:15286;627;Once it unfolds towards the end, you really see how the rest of the film came together.
I:15286;628;To put it precisely as possible, ~Memento~ is a smart film.
I:15286;629;taken from a short story written by his brother, Christopher Nolan crafted a screenplay and created a film that absolutely requires his viewers to engage and contemplate the story.
I:15286;630;"off on actual memory is a brilliant system combining hand written notes, photos with relevant captions
I:15286;631;orienting himself to why, what and where he is .
I:15286;632;Throughout the film, he continued to repeat a subtle gesture .
I:15286;633;The reason for this quirky mannerism is revealed at the end of the film.
I:15286;634;According to sources, his research as an actor is impeccable, focusing on the finer details of his character.
I:15286;635;This performance easily ranks in the top five for 2001.2.
I:15286;636;What ever you call Christopher Nolan, the man took a great idea created by his brother and put it on the screen with elegance, charm and intellegence.
I:15286;637;this is a film that should be viewed more than once.
I:15286;638;Being a mystery fan, I enjoyed this storyline as it kept me guessing who was a friend and who was the foe until the very end.
I:15286;639;classic mindwarp that is Memento.
I:15286;640;aptly enough, I had forgotten much of it, making much of Memento seem newly fresh yet oddly familiar, much like most of its main character Leonard's daily doings.
I:15286;641;"As Leonard himself will tell almost anyone he meets: ""I can't make new memories ."
I:15286;642;All of which would in itself make for an interesting movie.
I:15286;643;But what makes this film truly ingenious is the way it is constructed and edited.
I:15286;644;written by one of the ultimate storytellers .
I:15286;645;and pushes it to its extreme, actually starting AT the end and then working backwards .
I:15286;646;now, a lot of movies that are assembled in this kind of non.
I:15286;647;But in Memento, this style of editing actually serves the story and makes it better, because .
I:15286;648;perplexing world out of sequence .
I:15286;649;it forces us to experience the movie in the same disoriented way that Leonard experiences the world.
I:15286;650;So as Leonard puzzles his way through his life, so do we.
I:15286;651;This makes us empathize and connect with the film's central character in a way few other movies have ever been able to achieve before or since (whichever way you happen to travel through time in your search).
I:15286;652;Of course, the fact the Guy Pearce's performance is so riveting helps us enormously with our empathy as well.
I:15286;653;relies on the surprise that each new/past detail reveals, so I don't want to ruin any of this film's revelations if you are lucky enough to be contemplating seeing this movie for the first time.
I:15286;654;Because the great thing about owning a movie like Memento, as my experience will attest, is that it rewards multiple viewings.
I:15286;655;And the depth and the detail (in addition to the design) of the film ensure that each viewing is made fresh with new insight and understanding.
I:15286;656;It's also an exploration of what makes up a person's identity, and an examination of the malleability of experience.
I:15286;657;piece by piece, note by note, tattoo by puzzling tattoo.
I:15286;658;and when you finish this movie and immediately start it again you realize what an amazing piece of work it really is.
I:15286;659;Carrie Anne Moss is multifaceted and perfect as well.
I:15286;660;With his second feature film, director Christopher Nolan (Following) created a stunning thriller.
I:15286;661;Not only is Memento an incredible accomplishment as a film, but also an impressive feat for a relatively new filmmaker.
I:15286;662;The story taps the best ideas from both classic noir and detective films of the late 1940s, as well as more contemporary psychological suspense films, and the result is a film, which is in essence a neo.
I:15286;663;Rich in atmosphere and character, Memento is a modern classic and a prime example of using an intricate narrative to heighten a story's impact.
I:15286;664;Left with little to live for, Leonard vows that he will avenge his wife.
I:15286;665;when Memento was released, it was hailed as a visionary piece of filmmaking and it's clear that the greatest star of the film is its story, which unfolds in a series of segments shown in reversed chronological order.
I:15286;666;This method, which might have spoiled the ending in any other film, is miraculous in that it places the story's climax in the beginning of the film and then allows the audience to see what events lead up to that final act.
I:15286;667;Another unique aspect is its psychological inner workings, which suggests many things about the nature of corruption and revenge.
I:15286;668;It is beyond doubt, one of the most startling concepts ever put to film.
I:15286;669;And its not only the plot itself, but the way in which it is told, that makes this a classic.
I:15286;670;God, just watching it (which I have, many, many times) still gives me a thrill.
I:15286;671;Absolute perfection, right up there with Kubrick.
I:15286;672;He can, however, condition himself (in a classical, Pavlovian sense), and so he writes notes to himself, takes pictures, and prints tatoos on his body to keep his life and quest straight.
I:15286;673;The first scene implies that Teddy must have been the murderer.
I:15286;674;is essential for the enjoyment of the film.
I:15286;675;There are many visual clues .
I:15286;676;One is with the film: Leonard's memory problem seems to vary with the needs of the plot.
I:15286;677;There is a special edition of Memento, which would be the recommended format for repeated viewings.
I:15286;678;all, though, this is a very enjoyable movie.
I:15286;679;it's very interesting and intriguing, mostly because of the manner in which the film is constructed, but also due to the actors, who do a good job throughout.
I:15286;680;My head hurts, this film twisted it right off!
I:15286;681;solidly crafted, comparatively thoughtful exploration of the problems of loss and memory disguised as a crime thriller.
I:15286;682;the narrative backmasking, cin ma v rit techniques and soft peddling of its melodramatic aspects didn't grab too much box office (or academy award nominations), but the film has managed to gain a wider audience based on it's artistic merits: some subtler reflections on the nature of the detective as icon and genre, the contradictions of the filmatic urban avenger and some engaging acting performances.
I:15286;683;actually watching it provides the kind of jolting calm effect akin to last year's other under.
I:15286;684;"effect piece, ""the man who wasn't there."
I:15286;685;memento is the kind of patient, emotionally mature film you don't see too much of anymore (at least at your local gigaplex).
I:15286;686;What's good about this movie is the innovative way it's told rather than the story.
I:15286;687;The second time you watch it you think, wow, what an amazing movie, but I still don't know everything that's going on.
I:15286;688;And the fact that you don't know everything will keep you watching this one over and over.
I:15286;689;And the more times you watch this, the better it gets.
I:15286;690;An amazing film from start to finish, or should I say from finish to start?
I:15286;691;You've got to concentrate (tell the other folks around you to shush and turn off the cell phone) but it's well worth it!
I:15286;692;Be prepared to watch Memento several times.
I:15286;693;There is much more going on than may meet the eye at first glance.
I:15286;694;Director/Writer Nolan is doing much more than telling a tale in an innovative fashion.
I:15286;695;the narrative loop in the film, far more than a gimmick, unseats us from the comfortable theater seat and makes us sit up an take notice.
I:15286;696;By the end of the film, we have (hopefully!)
I:15286;697;or does he?I've always thought Guy Pearce was a great actor, and this is easily his best work to date (with LA Confidential a close second).
I:15286;698;Joe Pantoliano and Carrie Ann Moss are brilliant in the supporting cast.
I:15286;699;unfortunately I haven't found any of Nolan's work since to be all that memorable, but he has proven himself to be both insightful and capable of crafting a stunning piece of ground.
I:15286;700;Not that I need it to help the film make sense, but just to get one step deeper into this wonderfully crafted film.
I:15286;701;The film literally starts from the end and finishes at the beginning and has you more intrigued with every scene completed.
I:15286;702;it's a real challenge to watch this film and I felt that the script was written really well.
I:15286;703;And all the screwups he makes as a result.
I:15286;704;This is one of the most innovated films of 2000 and a really cool movie to watch.you'll need to watch it more than once to catch everything and even then you'll still have questions.
I:15286;705;That, however, is the beauty of this film.
I:15286;706;Told in reverse and in snap shots, the story is slowly revealed and it is absolutely spellbinding.
I:15286;707;I won't go into details because I don't want to reveal too much but it is a great way to spend a night with friends and a big bowl of popcorn.
I:15286;708;Guy Pearce is an excellent actor, as are Carrie.
I:15286;709;If you're a fan of Christopher Nolan's other convoluted films, then this one is definitely something that deserves your consideration.
I:15286;710;Nolan uses the narrative structure and editing to mimic Leonard's condition, and that disorientation you feel when first watching the film helps to further immerse yourself in the story.
I:15286;711;"Christopher Nolan's ""Memento"" is one of the landmark films of the new century."
I:15286;712;The film is distinguished by powerhouse storytelling, snappy editing, and great acting.
I:15286;713;Pearce gives an extraordinary performance as Leonard and is ably supported by Joe Pantoliano and Carrie.
I:15286;714;Incredible film, very unique, one of the best I have ever seen (and I have seen many).
I:15286;715;"The story unfolds in reverse so that the viewer is able to share Leonard's dilemma
I:15286;716;It is fascinating to see the events leading to scenes that we have already witnessed.
I:15286;717;joe Pantoliano and Carrie Ann Moss deliver excellent supporting performances.
I:15286;718;This is one of the greatest movies ever made!
I:15286;719;I really enjoyed the newspaper article that helped explain a few confusing parts.
I:15286;720;I highly recommend this movie.
I:15286;721;Now he must bring justice to the one who did it.
I:15286;722;"Seriously, though, ""Memento"" has to be one of the most cleverly."
I:15286;723;"Each little jump back is packed with revelations about Pearce's character, the identity of ""John G."", the little notes on Pearce's polaroids, the tattoos, and the very nature of his quest to find his late wife's killer."
I:15286;724;An unabashed triumph of pacing, plotting, and well.
I:15286;725;Christopher Nolan's 'Memento' is unlike any other film you'll ever see, a piece of film noir so original and so tense, it will stick with you for days.
I:15286;726;'Memento' is a perfectly executed film, full of wonderful montages and unpredictable twists and turns.
I:15286;727;anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano are by turns sympathetic and heart.
I:15286;728;If I see a better movie then 'Memento' this year, I will be greatly surprised.
I:15286;729;I got this tattoo from my friend, Sammy Jankis.
I:15286;730;Memento is a great movie that I saw after someone killed something I loved.
I:15286;731;memento is a great movie I saw.
I:15286;732;I saw it with my friend Teddy.
I:15286;733;and I can't really remember what I was telling you.
I:15286;734;but I have this friend, Sammy Jankis.
I:15286;735;This is a miraculous film.
I:15286;736;If you don't want to be challenged., I can recommend alot of Elvis Movies you can check out.
I:15286;737;But this is a great film.
I:15286;738;One that lets you do some of the discovery.
I:15286;739;This is one movie where it pays to pay close attention.
I:15286;740;the acting is uniformly impressive.
I:15286;741;This represents one of the best.
I:15286;742;This is a cerebral thriller.
I:15286;743;The editing and direction, for that matter, are both first rate.
I:15286;744;if you do, you are in for a treat!
I:15286;745;The first time I watched this movie, I had to watch it again right away.
I:15286;746;One of those movies that is one of a kind, great story line, lots of good quotes and a lot of fun.
I:15286;747;It moves from end to beginning, with each scene that the audience sees being the scene which took place before the previous scene.
I:15286;748;He developed a strange condition from this injury.
I:15286;749;He also keeps pictures of everyone he meets and writes notes on the backs to keep straight whether they can be trusted.
I:15286;750;Both characters are not who they seem at first, and one wonders if either can truly be trusted.
I:15286;751;Kudos must go out to Pearce, who gives an excellent performance as the brain damaged Leonard.
I:15286;752;A couple of neat tricks for us.
I:15286;753;This sets the scene for the type of storytelling we will be seeing.
I:15286;754;It will take a careful eye to spot the moment when they do.
I:15286;755;the main accomplishment for Christopher Nolan is the ability to structure the film in this way and still leave us a surprise at the end.
I:15286;756;The image is crisp and clear.
I:15286;757;My favorite feature is the one which lets you watch the whole movie in real time The black and white scenes all actually happen before the color scenes in real time.
I:15286;758;in short, this is a must see.
I:15286;759;The story is a whodunit thriller with some intriguing, if not confusing, twists.
I:15286;760;But, these flashbacks are very important and pertinent to identifying with the main character.
I:15286;761;It's well worth waiting for and your glad you finally got there.
I:15286;762;It's what makes moviemaking and a good story, interesting.
I:15286;763;It's definitely open to a lot of interpretations.
I:15286;764;known films, up through the blockbusters of the Dark Knight Trilogy and Inception.
I:15286;765;Memento is a gem of a movie that toys with your head and keeps you on your toes with its two forward.
I:15286;766;The film is great, don't get me wrong.
I:15286;767;The special part of this is that the director made it almost impossible to actually watch the movie.
I:15286;768;This film shocked me while watching it.
I:15286;769;This is a really good thriller that was ever made in a long time.
I:15286;770;Guy Pearce is really good as Leonard a man who has memory loss who leaves himself clues to help him find his wife's killer.
I:15286;771;anne Moss are great in their supporting roles.
I:15286;772;The ending is very shocking as well.
I:15286;773;From Christopher Nolan who directed Insomia and the new Batman movie.
I:15286;774;Momento, on the one hand, is a very intriguing, very well made film.
I:15286;775;this is a very well made, very creatively made movie.
I:15286;776;It holds your interest throughout, and it twists your mind in every which direction.
I:15286;777;The acting is very convincing and the story will keep you guessing up to the very end.
I:15286;778;It was an engaging watch, but you have to ask yourself if it would still be as engaging had it been shown in the proper order?
I:15286;779;I realize that it was the intention all along to make the film this way and I do think it is innovative and thought.
I:15286;780;Some people will love it, or some, like me, will be on the fence.
I:15286;781;If I could control the Acadamey Awards like everybody else wishes, I would definetly put Memento in the Best Picture nominations and possibly as the winner.
I:15286;782;Because this move gives the audience a big 1.2 punch by filming the movie scenes backwards.
I:15286;783;Guy Pearce does his best role since L. a. Confidential.
I:15286;784;anne Moss is thrilling since the Matrix.
I:15286;785;i'm impressed with this film.
I:15286;786;so what the ingenious director does is he takes us backwards through the film, so we FEEL the same way!
I:15286;787;Like Leonard, we have to learn anew about them in every scene.
I:15286;788;That's a 6 star movie, simple as that.
I:15286;789;i do, however, deduct one star due to Amazon's incredible lack of enviromental sensibility in their packaging.
I:15286;790;Memento is one of those rare films that manages to do something new.
I:15286;791;Though the mystery element of the plot is compelling, the true force of the movie comes from its ablity to let you experience a series of events from Leonard's perspective.
I:15286;792;this movie is as compelling as any that have been released in recent memory.
I:15286;793;The structure is increadibly unique and well crafted.
I:15286;794;The narrative lines run towards each other and eventually connect using the very clever device of watching a polaroid picture develop (thus providing the bridge from black and white to color).
I:15286;795;guy Pearce gives a tremendous performance.
I:15286;796;If he got your attention in L. a. Confidential, he's proved himself to be a formidable actor here, much like Brad Pitt's career defining performance in Seven.
I:15286;797;But really there is not much more I can say, the whole supporting cast is superb, the script is well above average and the direction and film construction is magnificent.
I:15286;798;This is a daring and thought provoking movie and if you have any interest at all in the genre of film it is not one that you can possibly justify having missed.
I:15286;799;the entire cast is great, the storyline is top.
I:15286;800;notch, and the production is undestated enough to give you that Indie.
I:15286;801;One could easily cut half the voiceover at the end, and still have a fine production.
I:15286;802;The story is a classic detective mystery with a couple of big twists .
I:15286;803;the second twist is a creative result of the first .
I:15286;804;anne Moss, Guy Pierce, and Joe Pantoliano shine even brighter, as you see their actions, then the motivations for their actions later on.
I:15286;805;Layer upon subtle layer, the characters and situations are built, until we arrive at the beginning of the film, and the biggest twist of all.
I:15286;806;It's one of the most creative movies I've seen in a lifetime of cinema.
I:15286;807;It's one of the best films made.
I:15286;808;the storytelling is undoubtledly one of a kind.
I:15286;809;in between these 10 minute reversals are black and white segments that actually move forward.
I:15286;810;it has a lot of features that you'll really appreciate.
I:15286;811;Also, the director's commentary is a useful feature that lets you in on insights into the making of .
I:15286;812;This can be a challenging and rewarding exercise letting you fully interact with the viewing process.
I:15286;813;I have seen a lot of movies and almost always I know what the director is doing.
I:15286;814;Memento is such a work.
I:15286;815;Neurologist Oliver Sacks, in his wonderful book, The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat (1986), recounts the story of a man who could only hold the memory of the last thirty seconds or so.
I:15286;816;Leonard's condition in this movie is better.
I:15286;817;Also he has the ability to follow a kind of learned routine in which he is able to function by continually writing himself notes.
I:15286;818;"the idea of taking notes to ""remember"" is something that some Alzheimer's patients are able to do in the early stages of the disease (which may be where Jonathan Nolan got the idea for his short story on which the film is based.)"
I:15286;819;"He ""remembers"" to look in his jacket pocket to see where he is living."
I:15286;820;In the scene where he wakes up next to Natalie, he gets up and goes to his jacket and finds her picture so he knows who she is.
I:15286;821;He also finds a picture of her and Dodd.
I:15286;822;"She will help you out of pity."""
I:15286;823;regardless of these questions, this is a brilliantly conceived and plotted thriller, and the acting by the three principals is superb.
I:15286;824;anne Moss, whom you may recall from The Matrix (1999), is mesmerizing with her sexy, mysterious eyes as the hard.
I:15286;825;but what really makes this a stunning movie is the way it is constructed.
I:15286;826;This seems an extraordinary way to tell a story, but it works.
I:15286;827;What makes it particularly effective here is the material.
I:15286;828;viewing this the second time (and you may feel a compulsion to do just that) some of the lines that were not funny initially become very funny.
I:15286;829;but you really need to see the movie to appreciate the stunning implication.
I:15286;830;on another level this is a movie about what makes us human.
I:15286;831;He, his friends, and everyone who has seen it liked it much better.
I:15286;832;Now, Guy Pearce is great.
I:15286;833;but the star of this movie is the storytelling device.
I:15286;834;"This movie is a joy to experience, but I'm left with a sense of ""wait a minute"" when I reflect on the story and how it fit together."
I:15286;835;He's riding the knife edge between this moment and the distant past.
I:15286;836;Her impact on the main story and the main character is what's important.
I:15286;837;All in all, it's an enjoyable tale with a unique storytelling style populated with excellent performances from actors portraying characters whose development was sacrificed to the gods of plot and storytelling.Yes, this is one that Hitchcock would have wanted to make, but I daresay he wouldn't have done a better job.
I:15286;838;i think this one's as sharp and tasty as the script allows.
I:15286;839;I thought that this movie was absolutely amazing!!
I:15286;840;It is so intelligently done.
I:15286;841;It's a movie that you watch, but you still have questions about it.
I:15286;842;It truly is a GREAT movie and everyone should watch it.
I:15286;843;It is more than a movie, it is an intellectual masterpiece!!!
I:15286;844;As a filmmaker, I found this to be one of the most original films of the last few years.
I:15286;845;The film works it's way backword, while the black and white footage progresses forward.
I:15286;846;The acting is great, and the character in the story is as confused as we are as to what's happening.
I:15286;847;bones edition allows you to view the movie in chronological order of scenes should you wish or if you are still confused after the first viewing, but I recommend that you watch it the way it's intended first.
I:15286;848;With some good haunting music for the film score.
I:15286;849;This best part about this film was that it was low budget.
I:15286;850;Mostly in the form of poloroid picture and very important notes are tattooed to his body.
I:15286;851;He is on a mission of revenge.
I:15286;852;It may sound confusing, but is actually quite e4asy to follow.
I:15286;853;the acting is perfect and the cinematogrophy is perfect as well.
I:15286;854;The music really fits the mood too.
I:15286;855;Plus there is a twist at the end (or the beginning!)
I:15286;856;Multiple viewings are required to really pick up on certain things that are definelty missed and will make the story have more sense and really uncover the conspiracy , if there really is one that is!The special features could be really good.
I:15286;857;And that was all I was able to find.
I:15286;858;That one gripe aside, everything is perfect.
I:15286;859;This is truly an original film.
I:15286;860;"anne Moss, Joe Pantoliano, and most notably the lead actor, Guy Pearce, whose role in ""L. a. Confidential"" began my personal respect for his talent."
I:15286;861;It is true that the first time I saw this, by movie's end, I wanted to scream.
I:15286;862;The director, Christopher Nolan, forces the audience to remember each previous scene in detail leading up to the end, thus making the audience identify with the main character who suffers from short.
I:15286;863;This is a unique film, and I am proud to have it in my collection.
I:15286;864;The plot twists and surprises that director Christopher Nolan employs in his energetic, frenetic script are intelligent to a fault, ones that tease the mind for hours after the film has ended.
I:15286;865;There is more to keep up with, which makes it even more interesting.
I:15286;866;The movie keeps this a secret even after its ending, inviting us to think on the subject, to ponder on the film's many turns and spins.
I:15286;867;By the time we finish thinking about it, we're more concerned with who is on top rather than who killed Mrs. Shelby.
I:15286;868;and that is precisely what makes this such a fascinating film.
I:15286;869;the film has its share of effective performances that range from subtle mysterious to all.
I:15286;870;Guy Pearce brings a hushed fervor to his character, embodying Leonard with an inner willpower that keeps the film at a fever pitch.
I:15286;871;anne Moss is eerily mysterious as Natalie, whose intentions play a bigger role than you would first consider.
I:15286;872;Joe Pantoliano gives his character just the right appearance, that which instills a great sense of suspicion for his character, Teddy, who uses Leonard's memory loss to his advantage.
I:15286;873;Appearances can be deceiving, and this is a fine example of that.
I:15286;874;Nolan's reversal device enhances rather than diminishes the movie's effects, perhaps because it allows us the chance to give serious thought to the events going on.
I:15286;875;"I entered into this realm of filmmaking not knowing what to expect
I:15286;876;Formalistic experiments in film can be a hit.
I:15286;877;Memento writer/director Christopher Nolan flies out from among his competition by finding a story which by nature demands an unconventional narrative approach, making Memento the four.
I:15286;878;the amazing thing is that Nolan makes you hang on to a story in which you find out the ultimate outcome of the plot in the very beginning.
I:15286;879;Memento, however, makes you care about *how* something happened, the cause of the effects, and somehow manages to generate suspense even though you're watching events unfold backwards.
I:15286;880;The actors do a terrific job .
I:15286;881;Guy Pearce wisely holds himself back and delivers a low.
I:15286;882;"over job that are instantly winning
I:15286;883;anne Moss continues to make smart choices in edgy roles, not content to milk her sex.
I:15286;884;"symbol status
I:15286;885;term memory for fresh comedic moments, and this also helps keep your attention even if you might sometimes get lost in its complicated plot.
I:15286;886;And of course, the bounty of story twists and revelations make this movie a terrific rewatch experience.
I:15286;887;one of the best films of 2001, and certainly the most original.
I:15286;888;"This is the type of movie Alfred Hitchcock would produce today
I:15286;889;Contrary to popular belief, yes you do need to be a rocket scientist to figure out what the heck is going on.
I:15286;890;This film really twists and turns, engaging you as the story unfolds, and the climax is something that you wouldn't believe!
I:15286;891;This movie is a serious trip!
I:15286;892;"Like Mulholland Drive in that you'll watch it several times and experience those ""Aha!"""
I:15286;893;it's just kind of trippy).
I:15286;894;I loved Joey Pants in this thing.
I:15286;895;He did a great job.
I:15286;896;This is a movie for movie fans.
I:15286;897;the storyline is intriguing and will hold the attention of a movie lover as they too try to work out what is going on.
I:15286;898;So just sit back and enjoy it.
I:15286;899;I first saw Memento on Video and thought this movie rocks.
I:15286;900;Its original and thats what makes a good movie, the way its told backwards is good.
I:15286;901;It makes you confused but then the ending makes it clear, with a twist.
I:15286;902;Definitely strange, interesting and fun!!!
I:15286;903;Very unique idea for a film!!!
I:15286;904;strangely enough, I got this movie the first time viewing it!!
I:15286;905;"maybe better said as, ""The last scene/end of the movie is run forward first as the movie starts ."
I:15286;906;New memories can never be formed and since he's decided to solve his wife's murder and his assault he has to write himself notes and other various extreme things so as to remember what he has discovered from day to day .
I:15286;907;Even if the ending were extraordinarily mind.
I:15286;908;For your sake, I hope you listen to the one voice of reason crying in the wilderness of mistaken notions of effective filmmaking.
I:15286;909;Say what you will of its subtsance, that film, at least, contains, along with its flash, almost nonstop humor and an abundance of compelling character acting.
I:15286;910;If you thought it was hard to write script with a suprise ending, how do you think it is to write one with a suprise beginning?It was an amazing movie, hard to follow, but amazing.
I:15286;911;Great movie, excellent acting and a brilliant script.
I:15286;912;One of his best performances.
I:15286;913;I suspect this will also be true of some number of other potential viewers.
I:15286;914;By me, so to speak, this is an art.
I:15286;915;offBroadway, Dadaist, University experimental film.
I:15286;916;Usually, when I put on a movie with which to relax after dinner, I want something straightforward to watch.
I:15286;917;This is a deep psychological thriller based on the some of the freakiest elements of memories and revenge.
I:15286;918;I'll tell you right now it's not the kind of movie everyone likes.
I:15286;919;The plot is not easy to understand, but it is thoroughly amazing.
I:15286;920;"except if you get it hang on for your life
I:15286;921;It is one of the best pieces of literature produced in our age.
I:15286;922;But once you have seen the movie, it is good fun to look through.
I:15286;923;Momento is a great psychological thriller.
I:15286;924;After seeing this movie you can appreciate that there are people out there you still want to create great movies.
I:15286;925;Guy Pearce gives the performance of his life in what I think will go down as one of the greatest films ever made.
I:15286;926;This could well be the greatest movie of all time.
I:15286;927;A true cinematic gem, missed at the yawn awards.
I:15286;928;Inventive, stylish, provocative and in a class all by it's self.
I:15286;929;This is virtuosso film making at it's finest!
I:15286;930;A true movie connoisseur's movie.
I:15286;931;I am a big fan of Guy Pierce and his first movie, Priscilla Queen of the Desert is still my favorite performance of his so I was very happy that he was finally recognized with Memento (although it seems to have been his version of kd lang's Constant Craving where the public recognized at long last your talent and then ignores you.)
I:15286;932;I love the Movie and Do watch it about every three months.
I:15286;933;I like the fact that you can watch it in chronological order if you figure out the menus.
I:15286;934;Great movie (which I already knew) that arrived in great condition!
I:15286;935;I bough this as a christmas gift for someone and they loved it!!!!!
I:15286;936;the movie will start from the credits to the beginning (showing the scenes in the right order, and you'll be able to watch the story as it happened.
I:15286;937;Technically the picture is fine with no artifacts , and the dts track performs beatufully in a fine tuned system, watch the movie and solve the puzzle, you won't be dissapointed.
I:15286;938;indulgent to allow that to happen.
I:15286;939;To be fair, it had it's fair share of great moments.
I:15286;940;The clever chase scene where he figures out he is being chased is cool.
I:15286;941;The ending is surprising and interesting, it made me think about the movie a while afterwards.
I:15286;942;It will be and already is a huge cult hit, so I guess I'm fighting a losing battle.
I:15286;943;I really enjoyed this movie.
I:15286;944;It's the kind of movie that you really need to pay attention to at all times.
I:15286;945;it was a very interesting idea that was well crafted.
I:15286;946;I think that Guy Pearce was amazing in this movie.
I:15286;947;It has a few twists and turns that are well worth watcing.
I:15286;948;it's a original film, and one of the better films I've seen this year.
I:15286;949;Just watching the innovative style of the film, being played backwards, is enough to behold.
I:15286;950;Though it's seems unnatural at first, the way director Christopher Nolan pieces the film together flows really well.
I:15286;951;If the unique style wasn't enough, the plot and message of this indie film are both superb.
I:15286;952;Here Nolan takes the mystery genre to a fresh level that has yet to be discovered.
I:15286;953;purpose in life, the selfishness in mankind, trust, and memory.
I:15286;954;i really gained a great respect for Christopher Nolan, this being his sophmore film.
I:15286;955;I also recommend watching his first feature The Following.
I:15286;956;All three are very believable and do a remarkable job.
I:15286;957;This story keeps you glued to the story line to figure out who each of these characters and what are they doing to Leonard.
I:15286;958;In Memento, Guy Pierce plays a former insurance investigator with a rare form of amnesia trying to track down his wifes murderer.
I:15286;959;For the most part this works to great effect in creating an intriguing scenario and thickened suspense, although at times it neccessitates that the plot be overly simplified just so it's easier for the viewer to try to correctly piece everything together chronologically.
I:15286;960;Understandably, this brings us closer to experiencing Pierce's feelings, but is ultimately detrimental.
I:15286;961;With a whole world filled with remakes and clich s it feels great to come across a movie such as Momento.
I:15286;962;When thrillers where really good?
I:15286;963;Well here you have Memento, a real jewel which will grab you and keep you on the edge of your seat.
I:15286;964;The film starts at the end and takes us trough his quest for vengance all the way to the begining.
I:15286;965;write it on your fore head.
I:15286;966;It is a realistic thriller with adult content in a crime setting.
I:15286;967;I stunned at so many good reviews.
I:15286;968;This movie starts at the end and goes backwards from there.
I:15286;969;The main character (wonderfully acted by the talented Guy Pearce) has short.
I:15286;970;anne Moss is simply brilliant in this movie.
I:15286;971;anne Moss is sultrier than ever.
I:15286;972;If ever there was a movie that Guy Pearce was destined to play in, Memento is it.
I:15286;973;Don't get me wrong, L. a. Confidential was superb, but this is just amazing.
I:15286;974;Shot in black and white and color and told in a reverse.
I:15286;975;forward manner that will amaze you, Memento has everything going for it.
I:15286;976;It's puzzling, but it certainly fits the movie.
I:15286;977;It amazed me how not only this movie remained cohesive, but also offered intriguing characters, and still managed to throw in a twist ending (or should i say beginning)that was actually a good twist ending.
I:15286;978;I have the special edition and watched the hidden version that takes place in actual chronological order (which should only be watched once youve seen it how it was meant to be watched) and it was still a good movie.
I:15286;979;Please please please watch this movie.
I:15286;980;Memento is well made, if nothing else.
I:15286;981;Taughtly written, well directed, well acted, and once you get used to the backwards storytelling, surprisingly easy to follow.
I:15286;982;The film is so relentlessly depressing, and disturbing that the ending, while clever, and satisfying on one level, brings its own sense of relief that you can get back to normal life.
I:15286;983;this is one of the best movies ever.
I:15286;984;The best and most underrated movie of last year.
I:15286;985;I read an extremely detailed review, with explicit spoilers, before seeing this film.
I:15286;986;It's the most original concept in film.
I:15286;987;to give credit where credit is due.
I:15286;988;dressing, and dialogue is extremely well done.
I:15286;989;but DAMN, you'll have a fun time debating and puzzling over it.
I:15286;990;this interesting use of editing and sequence lets us completely enter the confusing world of the main character, who's unable to form new memories, and so, can't remember anything for longer than 5 minutes.
I:15286;991;It also helps to keep us guessing about major plot points.
I:15286;992;Memento is a very good movie.
I:15286;993;ray format presents the movie in a clean format but the extras and almost no subtitles makes it hard to share with everyone you want.
I:15286;994;Although, is not a bad choice if you want to have it in the best digital format.
I:15286;995;Wonderfully complex and original film by Christopher Nolan, who made the Batman/Dark Knight films and Inception.
I:15286;996;I got Mememto for me and a friend to watch, and I found the movie to be VERY GOOD!
I:15286;997;You have to think about what is going on, and just when you think you had it solve, there is another twist which makes it more interesting.
I:15286;998;It is like a good detective story with great twists, and I recommend this movie who are interested in a good mystery.
I:15286;999;The memory is also played in chronological reverse, turning a clever story into a brilliant movie.
I:15286;1000;"This is directory Christopher Nolan's 2nd movie, and beats out his brilliant first film, ""Following."""
I:15286;1001;A great film to check out if you end up enjoying this one as much as I did.
I:15286;1002;I have watched this movie 4 times now and I _think_ I get it.
I:15286;1003;This is an awesome movie, a must.
I:15286;1004;The film is a revolutionary concept.
I:15286;1005;We actually travel backwards with Leonard until the startling conclusion.
I:15286;1006;A sympathetic friend (Carrie Anne Moss) seems to be helping him.
I:15286;1007;"Directed by Christopher Nolan, ""Memento"" is a Masterpiece of suspense."
I:15286;1008;I highly recommend this film to all viewers.
I:15286;1009;Moving along with the narrative, we see Leonard as an insurance investigator prior to his attack.
I:15286;1010;And Sammy's story is important to the film.
I:15286;1011;Teddy's character is very important in the film, and where Teddy's loyalties are, leave the viewer in suspense.
I:15286;1012;writing, and it is thoroughly worth the watch.
I:15286;1013;I highly recommend this film to all viewers.
I:15286;1014;lots of subtlety in the film, well beyond just a great film.
I:15286;1015;noir styled plot with an interesting backwards.

I:15286;1020;additionally, he takes teddy's photo during the black white sequence, and he has this photo in his possession each time in the film that he meets teddy (including before he records Fact 6.)
I:15286;1021;Its witty cinematography combined with the philosophical perception of reality made this movie a masterpiece in my mind .
I:15286;1022;As has been well described in other reviews, it's a brilliant psychological thriller that keeps you guessing as you see each scene the way the main character would.
I:15286;1023;Which is why the film is worth seeing again.
I:15286;1024;That made each scene more significant and enjoyable.
I:15286;1025;to put it another way, when you see the film the first time, you're mostly in the dark about what's really going on until the end.
I:15286;1026;Seeing it again, each detail becomes richer in meaning, the film seems deeper, and I could appreciate it on another level.
I:15286;1027;when you get past the superficial level of the plot mystery, what remains is a meditation on how we choose who we are in the world, and the role that memory plays.
I:15286;1028;crafted illusion to create the world we want to live in.
I:15286;1029;In that world, the meaning we bring to each new day is just a product of the memories we carry with us.
I:15286;1030;This gripping revenge thriller will keep you guessing from beginning to end and keep you talking long after it is over.
I:15286;1031;With it's unusual style and it's extremely complex plot, Memento will take you for a mesmerizing ride that you will not soon forget.
I:15286;1032;He must assemble numerous clues for himself, some in the form of tattoos, others in the form of Polaroid pictures of people relating to his search.
I:15286;1033;memento is a great movie to own because it is one of those rare movies that you will want to watch over and over again.
I:15286;1034;With it's intricate plot and changing perceptions of characters throughout, there is always some missed hidden detail waiting to be discovered.
I:15286;1035;It is a masterpiece that must be seen.
I:15286;1036;quick plot synopsis: A psychological thriller about a man with short.
I:15286;1037;It does an excellent view of putting the viewer on the same level as the main character by showing the movie in reverse.
I:15286;1038;The first scene you see is the last one in the story.
I:15286;1039;"disc set gives you everything you'd expect from a special edition: director's commentary
I:15286;1040;all i can say is great price, the movie got to us super quick, cant complain at all!
I:15286;1041;Great exercise for those who like to think about the films they watch.
I:15286;1042;I like the people in this movie and mostly the pretty girl with the dark hairs.
I:15286;1043;If you enjoy the challenge of mapping out the contents for yourself, more power to you, have a blast.
I:15286;1044;ray and was able to compare.
I:15286;1045;packaging of the original with more extras (all the extras from the 2.
I:15286;1046;The picture is greatly improved (the original is 'soft' .
I:15286;1047;the 10th anniversary edition shows much more detail).
I:15286;1048;i did see the movie through hoping for some big twist and then it will all come together for me and I'd be somewhat entertained by the finale of it.
I:15286;1049;Just brilliant enough to interest scores of stoned undergraduates.
I:15286;1050;Then I watched it again after a month, and I stuck with my original opinion that this is in fact, a really good and original thriller.
I:15286;1051;No, but it's still quite the classic and a must.
I:15286;1052;It starts at the end, starts at the beginning, and alternates between the two until they meet in the middle, to which the movie is wrapped up.
I:15286;1053;It works for the story, and keeps the viewers on their toes in keeping track of everything.
I:15286;1054;Let me illustrate to you the brilliance in this presentation.
I:15286;1055;She tells Guy Pearce that it was her boyfriend did it to her and that Guy needs to get rid of one of his associates.
I:15286;1056;It's more or less brilliant and Nolan uses it to his advantage to spice up an already great story.
I:15286;1057;The movie goes deep into the detail of how somebody with this condition would live.
I:15286;1058;But hey, the reveal speech by Joe Pantoliano and Guy Pearce is great.
I:15286;1059;And again, it's a 'Holy Crap' moment that will leave you satisfied on your first viewing.
I:15286;1060;Still a classic, I really hope I never get that short.
I:15286;1061;_Memento_ is a revenge/thriller that stars Guy Pearce, who turns in a very good performance, in the role of Leonard Shelby, a widower, who has completely lost the ability to make short.
I:15286;1062;"He relies primarily on Polaroids, notes and tattoos in order to help him remember the most important ""facts"" he discovers."
I:15286;1063;Along the way, Shelby is befriended by Natalie, played by Carrie Anne Moss, and Lenny, who is brilliantly portrayed by Joe Pantoliano.
I:15286;1064;_Memento_ offers a reasonably original screenplay that is well acted on the overall, and, considering that this is Nolan's second film, the directorial work is deserving of praise.
I:15286;1065;It's definitely worth a single viewing, though I doubt I'll ever watch it a second time.
I:15286;1066;Don't get me wrong, this is a good movie .
I:15286;1067;Christopher Nolan's Memento is one of those films you may have to view several times to truly appreciate.
I:15286;1068;What makes the film unique is simply the way it is told, using a non.
I:15286;1069;It's a bit jarring at first, and difficult to follow, but it doesn't alienate the audience, and eventually the viewer is able to pick up on this type of narrative.
I:15286;1070;Therefore, from Leonard's point of view, the line between friend and enemy is always indistinct.
I:15286;1071;Memento somehow manages to mimic its storyline with its film techniques, with scattered clues here and there, and is a cerebral whodunit experience for the viewer to try to piece together.
I:15286;1072;It is also a unique, stylish, film that has great pacing and building suspense, and finishes with a nice twist.
I:15286;1073;If you want to know if you will enjoy the movie, the other raving reviews should help you.
I:15286;1074;So, that's most definitely a steal.
I:15286;1075;Oh, and it was plastic wrapped and in perfect condition.
I:15286;1076;It's one of those movies you have to watch over and over again.
I:15286;1077;It's captivating, thrilling and suspenseful.
I:15286;1078;I love having it at home so I can watch it whenever I please.
I:15286;1079;Memento eclipses everything which preceded it, and set the bar so high it may never be topped.
I:15286;1080;director Nolan does a remarkable job of juggling the complex plot elements, but sabotages himself with some of his rather ordinary visual schemes.
I:15286;1081;I refer you to the diner sequence in which characters portrayed by Guy Pearce and Joe Pantoliano converse over soup.
I:15286;1082;Close ups work best when used judiciously and to provide emphasis.
I:15286;1083;his accent is that authentic.
I:15286;1084;"All of the performances are convincing and it's always fun to see ""Eve 6"" (Harriet Sansom Harris) from that great ""X. files"" episode."
I:15286;1085;please watch this movie, it is very well.
I:15286;1086;acted, and entertaining as well.
I:15286;1087;it has a lot of clever and detail.
I:15286;1088;"ridden ""reverse punchlines"" as well as suspense."
I:15286;1089;It's better to let this movie take you on a backwards path from end to beginning.
I:15286;1090;I watched this a couple months ago and the music stayed in my subconscious.
I:15286;1091;Finally had to play the movie again, and I enjoyed it just as much as the first time, even after knowing all the twists and turns.
I:15286;1092;There is actually a dual main menu, and you can access the secondary one by slipping into the audio selections and then returning to the main menu.
I:15286;1093;More companies should be so innovative in bringing a fresh approach to creating unique menus.
I:15286;1094;this is a great movie for thinking people to watch.
I:15286;1095;It is one of the better.
I:15286;1096;written and edited movies out there.
I:15286;1097;And I know that most movie.
I:15286;1098;I would have thought that people under 18 might not like it so much, but they are consistent with the overall score.
I:15286;1099;memento is the most innovative and absorbing thriller to come out in years.
I:15286;1100;christopher Nolan presents us with a thrilling and provocative noirish screenplay.
I:15286;1101;There are many twists and turns as we're kept on our toes as Leonard searches for those who destroyed his life.
I:15286;1102;"guy Pearce carries the film on his head and shoulders
I:15286;1103;Pearce is backed up by strong supporting performances from Joe Pantoliano and Carrie.
I:15286;1104;exhilarating and unsettling, Memento is a film you won't soon forget.
I:15286;1105;Finally, the trend in hollywood has moved towards brain twisting clever thrillers.
I:15286;1106;It's really something that you have to see to experience, but is done flawlessly.
I:15286;1107;going to watch it again soon!
I:15286;1108;christopher nolan is a great writer.
I:15286;1109;guy pierce is the perfect actor for this film.
I:15286;1110;Wow, this movie was awesome.
I:15286;1111;Christopher Nolan finds a neat way to tell a story.
I:15286;1112;backwards with cause and effect.
I:15286;1113;Guy Pearce and Joe Pantalonio did a wonderful job but i didnt think Carrie Anne Moss did that good of a job, couldve been better.
I:15286;1114;Christopher Nolan is now one of my favorite directors.
I:15286;1115;The movie is engaging and it makes you wonder what's going to happen next.
I:15286;1116;For a few reasons, one of which was Lenny's memory of giving his wife an insulin shot.
I:15286;1117;I saw this movie my freshman year in college [5 years ago] and fell in love, but I wanted to watch it closer because it's one of those movies that make you think.
I:15286;1118;I also wanted to share it with my boyfriend because I thought he'd enjoy it, and he did too!
I:15286;1119;Still, on top of being a first.
I:15286;1120;rate thriller (well, more or less a thriller anyway.)
I:15286;1121;'Memento' has got a real human interest angle, and prods into some ideas with regards to reality and perception.
I:15286;1122;As you would imagine, this can get pretty damn complicated.
I:15286;1123;Still, clever and intriguing as the plot is, the character of Leonard is perhaps the most interesting part of the film.
I:15286;1124;Personally, I find him to be a great, tragic and highly sympathetic figure.
I:15286;1125;He's particularly compelling to me, as I find revenge to be a rather romantic notion.
I:15286;1126;performances are all excellent, though special note goes, again, to Guy Pearce as Leonard.
I:15286;1127;He's in a really complicated spot, as there really no guidebook for how to play this role, as he's got to continually be in a sorta semi.
I:15286;1128;(or vice versa) Nolan's direction is stylish and sharp, though it doesn't draw as much attention to itself as it might have, which is probably a good thing.
I:15286;1129;key, pulsing stuff, but still charged with emotion.Yeah, it's a great movie.
I:15286;1130;Clever plot + emotional resonance.
I:15286;1131;But still, I was impressed with the way the direction and the editing of the movie was done.
I:15286;1132;Pitch perfect to describe it.
I:15286;1133;The action sequences were also great and there are a lot of scenes that I'd like to see over and over again.
I:15286;1134;Guy Pearce was great, so is Carrie.
I:15286;1135;But director and cast can rest assured they made something unique in thtehistory of the movies: one of the worst wastes of time ever !
I:15286;1136;This film really impressed me!
I:15286;1137;i think the film will at least walk away with a Best Original Screenplay nod.
I:15286;1138;This would without a doubt be considered my favorite film of 2001!!
I:15286;1139;Memento is original, daring and creative.
I:15286;1140;A grabber in the true sense of the word, this film demands contemplation, reflection and respect.
I:15286;1141;seriously, and im pretty good at keeping up with them.
I:15286;1142;i you gotta watch it to know what i mean.
I:15286;1143;and the only way to keep track is through a pitiful but impressively clever way of reminding himself of what and where and who he is doing, going, and seing.
I:15286;1144;you cant watch this once and be satisfied.
I:15286;1145;you leave this movie with a smile when you get it because you have to respect and truly tip your hat to the concept.
I:15286;1146;i give it ten punk points for sheer nerve.
I:15286;1147;the structure, story, and conventions used in telling the story contained in this movie are amazing, frankly.
I:15286;1148;The trick is, and this is fiendishly clever.
I:15286;1149;the movie takes place in a series of two to three minute chunks, which is about the amount of time it takes to form a new memory.
I:15286;1150;this turned out to be, by FAR the best movie to come out this year.
I:15286;1151;Christopher loved it and they began to collaborate on the project.
I:15286;1152;"nolan was born in England, and he spent his childhood moving back and forth between the United Kingdom and the States
I:15286;1153;"It was considered by the executives who saw it, ""the most innovative script"" that they had seen in ages."
I:15286;1154;One just has to admire such audacity.
I:15286;1155;He also responded to literature presented that way.
I:15286;1156;"So he decided to take the methodology, and what he learned on his first feature, refine it and transfer the concept to MEMENTO
I:15286;1157;It certainly is evident that he succeeded beyond his wildest imagination.
I:15286;1158;"Suddenly, following the action in the narrative, the two timelines merge, and the action is transformed to color
I:15286;1159;"guy Pearce as Leonard Shelby was astonishingly good, both a lost soul and a dangerous avenger
I:15286;1160;up emotion and energy .
I:15286;1161;yet he manages to capture our empathy, and holds our attention, his hopes become ours, his quest our own.
I:15286;1162;moss as Natalie the bar maid, the gangster's moll, a drug runner, a femme fatale, love interest, abuser, and ten times a bitch .
I:15286;1163;was very effective, creating a character that we can not shake from our senses, emerging as sexy, selfish, and far from innocent.
I:15286;1164;quite a feat for any actor.
I:15286;1165;this film provokes discussion, after challenging the viewer to stay with it.
I:15286;1166;Director Nolan has created a complex methodology that continues to perplex us, even after multiple viewings.
I:15286;1167;Regardless, this is a film like no other, an original that is worthy of both its accolades and its criticism.
I:15286;1168;I have now watched it several times and each time I see it I discover something new that I had not seen or noticed before.
I:15286;1169;It is truly an awesome movie that will keep you guessing long after you have turned it off.
I:15286;1170;Plus, all of the acting in it is fantastic.
I:15286;1171;boggling and truly great than this film.
I:15286;1172;Without even knowing the story, the fact that the film move backwards is what sets this apart from the rest of the croud and what keeps you watching.
I:15286;1173;So you go to the movie, you see it, you're already thinking about a zillion ending.
I:15286;1174;It's a great movie, not for .
I:15286;1175;Fresh new face, fresh new style.
I:15286;1176;this movie has everything: interesting characters, great thought provoking plot, and emotional background music ambiance.
I:15286;1177;Everytime I watch this movie I noticed something new and draw a new conclusion as to what is really going on.
I:15286;1178;Guy Pearce has also done a few interesting films (Ravenous and The Count of Monte Cristo).
I:15286;1179;Still, the acting is top notch, since Guy Pearce truly is an excellent choice for the lead role, delivering a subdued and intriguing performance.
I:15286;1180;Directing Christopher Nolan suceeds at creating a gripping and moody atmosphere with enough suspense and interest, grabbing the viewer`s attention.
I:15286;1181;As a whole, this effort is worthwile and appealing, yet it`s more cerebral, cold and distant than enjoyable, entertaining and warm.
I:15286;1182;Still, Memento is a remarkable movie about human nature, lies, trust and love, providing a clever (perhaps too clever, by the way), unusual and witty mistery.
I:15286;1183;It`s unfortunate that, at parts, it carries more style than substance, but it`s a solid cinematic experience nonetheless.
I:15286;1184;That's the meaning of Pearce's tattoos.
I:15286;1185;engineering both in and outside of entertainment is an instinctual skill of mine, it now runs on a subconscious motor, so I can't help myself.
I:15286;1186;This may be a termite infested limb, but I suspect that Derrida was just used as a framework for pure entertainment and in this respect the film works very well.
I:15286;1187;This is probably one of the most tightly crafted films I've seen in years.
I:15286;1188;This is ensemble acting at its absolute best with completely flawless direction and razor.
I:15286;1189;I'm not a fan of violent movies, but this is beautiful and brilliant.
I:15286;1190;It's also very well acted.
I:15286;1191;Memento is the best movie I have seen, with its incredible use of film to tell the story and a well written script to grab the viewer and hold them close.
I:15286;1192;Arrange the sequence backwards, like Memento, and you've got it!
I:15286;1193;Christopher Nolan, is all you need.
I:15286;1194;As soon as you put in the movie the fun begins.
I:15286;1195;I won't go into detail, but it gets you REALLY geared up and in the perfect mood to watch the movie.
I:15286;1196;I just needed my memory to be refreshed by seeing it again.
I:15286;1197;analyze and have more fun with this movie before Nolan tells me everything and puts all my theories to rest.
I:15286;1198;and the rest of the Special Features you will have to find yourself.
I:15286;1199;This is one of the best and orginal movies ever.
I:15286;1200;it is a must see for all thiller fans.
I:15286;1201;Ever since getting the new release I've researched the movie deeply and the amount of things that I've found that goes way past the end is staggering but interesting.
I:15286;1202;If any one is interested in e. mailing me to further discuss this astounding movie, please feel free.
I:15286;1203;"Christopher Nolan's ""Memento"" literally breaks new ground in the film department, creating one of the most enticing pictures in the history of filmmaking."
I:15286;1204;Guy Pearce is excellent .
I:15286;1205;the entire cast is excellent.
I:15286;1206;Additionally, the film's editing, cinematography, storyline and directing were each very creative, definitely representing more than a mere fresh breath of air.
I:15286;1207;the film's conclusion, in which the story's time periods meet to reveal a plot twist that satisfies the viewer but does not end the storyline, is so original and mindboggling that it SCREAMED Give me Oscar!
I:15286;1208;"Gosford Park was good
I:15286;1209;Chris Nolan's mesmeric thriller, Memento, is a dazzlingly original piece of filmmaking the likes of which Hollywood rarely produces.
I:15286;1210;is flawless, but Memento's genius is largely based on it's unique style of narrative.
I:15286;1211;or as he succinctly puts it, his ability to make new memories.
I:15286;1212;in recreating the world from Leonard's point of view.
I:15286;1213;"Leonard is able to make some sense of the world by writing things down, taking photographs of the people he becomes involved with, and for the really important ""facts"", tattooing them onto his body."
I:15286;1214;Yet each time he wakes up, the only thing he remembers is that his wife is still alive, and the ways in which he is forced to realise what happened are heart.
I:15286;1215;a tremendous central performance from Pearce allied to a fine supporting cast (Joe Pantoliano, Carrie Ann Moss), taut script, evocative photography and brilliantly paced direction make Memento a truly memorable film, and one you won't want to miss.
I:15286;1216;And I wanted a drink.
I:15286;1217;And that is what a real movie should be about.
I:15286;1218;This movie is truly unmissable.
I:15286;1219;I can see exactly why the world loves the movie.
I:15286;1220;Memento is just everything you want out of a smart and fun movie.
I:15286;1221;You truly get your money's worth with this one.
I:15286;1222;He put his heart and soul into this movie and has come up with a true original.
I:15286;1223;The script was actually adapted from a short story but extended to a film that seems so totally new and fresh you would never guess it had been adapted from anything.
I:15286;1224;He uses black and white for the unforgettable flashback scenes and colour for the scenes that are happening at that time.
I:15286;1225;Another great thing at the movie is Guy Pearce.
I:15286;1226;He is one heck of a performer!
I:15286;1227;While not only truly believable, he somehow possesses his character into amazing form.
I:15286;1228;There are plenty more great things about the movie.
I:15286;1229;The editing is effective, especially within the first few minutes.
I:15286;1230;moss's character is very intriguing.
I:15286;1231;This movie is shocking, intriguing and truly unforgettable.
I:15286;1232;"I just finished watching ""Memento"", and it is definetly one of the most mindbending movies I have ever sceen."
I:15286;1233;Just let me put it this way.
I:15286;1234;Now This is a film a lot of people would swear by.
I:15286;1235;There's no review that can actually help you find solid on this movie.
I:15286;1236;my choice for best movie of the year, definitely best script and editing.
I:15286;1237;the presentation fits the subject.
I:15286;1238;with few characters and scenes the movie is intense as it races time.
I:15286;1239;please notice the black and white vs. color scenes, why?
I:15286;1240;a keeper and possibly an important movie from a film standpoint.
I:15286;1241;This is my favorite movie.
I:15286;1242;bending and makes you think and question the story just like Guy Pearce's character.
I:15286;1243;Guy Pearce is so great in this movie.
I:15286;1244;It is a movie that keeps you intrigued all the way through.
I:15286;1245;He really enjoyed it and said it really made him think the whole movie.
I:15286;1246;So I highly suggest watching the special features first because it helps explain the movement of the film and gets you prepared.
I:15286;1247;He also has tattoos all over his body which are all reminders as well.
I:15286;1248;this is my favourite movie.
I:15286;1249;i bought this limited edition the first day it came out, and i still watch it every time and i gather a new piece of info in the story.
I:15286;1250;At the end, you'll be surprised, shocked and confused.
I:15286;1251;Believe me, it's worth watching!
I:15286;1252;This was the best of the 3 and that makes it even a better deal!
I:15286;1253;You can read all the reviews here and they will tell you what the movie is all about.
I:15286;1254;A great mystery, I have loaned this out several times and recommended it more than that.
I:15286;1255;You will definitely have to watch this movie more than once.
I:15286;1256;ray has much better special features than the original Blu.
I:15286;1257;This movie is very deep and you'll need to think a lot to understand it.
I:15286;1258;He's got one big gun and will do anything to find this man.
I:15286;1259;He gets assistance from a cop and a good friend.
I:15286;1260;of the movie will you understand everything.
I:15286;1261;This movie is a masterpiece and it's one that I will definitely add to my collection.
I:15286;1262;The ending is very unpredictable and excellent.
I:15286;1263;The movie is a masterpiece as I have said because it's so original.
I:15286;1264;The acting is great notably by Joe Pantoliano.
I:15286;1265;this powerful and challenging Noir has to do with a simple question: what about you or me if suddenly the lights of the memory simply turn off?
I:15286;1266;"a man without memory will become a desperate man
I:15286;1267;On the other hand a man with just a memory becomes a modern Faust.
I:15286;1268;supported by a breathtaking script .
I:15286;1269;integrates an astonishing and fundamental Quartet of golden movies: Twelve monkeys, Dark city and Mulholland drive.
I:15286;1270;The acting and the storyline are the best.
I:15286;1271;The movie actually works itself back from the present.
I:15286;1272;So if you are in for a very surprising and twisted ending (beginning) then this is the movie for you.
I:15286;1273;Guy Pearce and Joe Pantoliano are both really great.
I:15286;1274;Chris Nolan, the director, (the Dark Knight) is masterful.
I:15286;1275;The remaining cast is Excellent.
I:15286;1276;layered MYSTERY with a dose of IRONIC HUMOR.
I:15286;1277;A modern day film noir.
I:15286;1278;Guy Pearce is one of our best contemporary actors and this film is a shining example of that.
I:15286;1279;Otherwise it's excellent, and deserves multiple watchings.
I:15286;1280;i also liked the menu clues .
I:15286;1281;very clever, extending the story outside the bounds of the film itself.
I:15286;1282;also, Guy Pearce could be my best friend's twin brother.
I:15286;1283;I recommend going here: [.]
I:15286;1284;This IS a very interesting movie that pulls you in, keeps you guessing, and leaves you saying, WOW!
I:15286;1285;That was a great movie!
I:15286;1286;i've seen it up close and I can't imagine what they were thinking.
I:15286;1287;"I got this movie because I watched Bollywood version of it called ""Gajini""."
I:15286;1288;Memento was a total dissapointment after watching Gajini, the Bollywood version is brilliant.
I:15286;1289;MEMENTO's use of a reverse narrative structure to tell a murder mystery is very clever.
I:15286;1290;The performances are generally good and the piece is often quite engaging.
I:15286;1291;Memento is just one of the most intelligent, innovative, and suspenseful brain teasers to come along in years.
I:15286;1292;Definitely reminiscent of the Hitchockian suspense, where you're guessing until the final scene.
I:15286;1293;Guy Pearce is swift and glides gracefully from scene to scene with that fragment of fear upon his face like anyone in a condition where they couldnt remember one thing from the next.
I:15286;1294;We totally empathize with his character and we are totally right there with him with each lost and lingering gaze.
I:15286;1295;Memento is so smart that it out smarts even the most intricate investigator, it makes you apart of the puzzle.
I:15286;1296;moss, and the style and concept were interesting .
I:15286;1297;Memento is a terrific movie with excellent acting, complex structure, and fine editing.
I:15286;1298;It reveals new layers even after many viewings and is an empathetic depiction of unfamiliar memory.
I:15286;1299;I really recommend the movie.
I:15286;1300;Guy Pearce gets the audience to appreciate the character's situation and sympathize.
I:15286;1301;One of his persistant acquaintences, Teddy (Joe Pantoliano), claims Leonard has killed yet a fourth person.
I:15286;1302;He might be considered a smiling psychopath, even allowing for the memory deficiency.
I:15286;1303;"A friend recommended ""Memento"" to me, because I am very much into suspense thrillers."
I:15286;1304;It was just, frankly, boring, I told my friend.
I:15286;1305;i countered that Hitchcock movies have big shock ending payoffs at the end, too, but that Hitch *kept the viewer interested* with taut suspense, a great plot and finely.
I:15286;1306;When he catches the real killer, he can exonerate himself.
I:15286;1307;"As far as ""The Big Sleep,"" ""Out of the Past"" or ""White Heat,"" forget about it!"
I:15286;1308;"And I've got plenty of that suspension: It keeps me well entertained even by such formulaic movies as ""Dodgeball"" and ""Mr. 3000."""
I:15286;1309;"tATOO GUY: What does it say?PEARCE: ""He has a gun, and he's coming for you."
I:15286;1310;pEARCE: I got it from Chris Nolan, my director.
I:15286;1311;"He said I've got to look ""killer cool."""
I:15286;1312;tATOO GUY: Wow, that IS cool.
I:15286;1313;Lots of cool Goth script.
I:15286;1314;"school film, I recommend Edward Dmytryk's 1965 classic amnesia thriller ""Mirage"" as the perfect antidote."
I:15286;1315;Instead, he uses Peter Stone's crafty dialogue.
I:15286;1316;He also does something else that has eluded Guy Pearce.
I:15286;1317;It is a story told to us backward, for the wonderful and fiendish effect of reverse suspense, never knowing why the events of the movie are occurring.
I:15286;1318;along the way one can find a psychological study in the slippery nature of memory and reality.
I:15286;1319;rate movie and a devilish thriller, complete with a small cast of characters who may or may not be helping Leonard to survive and find his elusive John G to exact revenge for Leonard's wife's death.
I:15286;1320;And yet, the movie works.
I:15286;1321;I'm going to make this short and sweet.
I:15286;1322;This is an excellent piece of film.
I:15286;1323;Guy Pearce does a wonderful job as Leonard Shelby.
I:15286;1324;Christopher Nolan has really done a great job.
I:15286;1325;and this is one of the most memorable films around.
I:15286;1326;Like a classic book, Momento is a simple story masterfully told with meticulous attention to detail.
I:15286;1327;the story is really quite simple (I'm not going to spoil anything), but it is told/shown such a unique matter that it keeps you intrigued from start to finish.
I:15286;1328;The sooner you catch on to where the storyline is taking you the sooner you want to rewind and start over.
I:15286;1329;his portrayal of this strange character is memorable.
I:15286;1330;The writing is also wonderful: he is witty, smart, yet at the same time oblivious to the nth degree.
I:15286;1331;And thus he is vulnerable and taken advantage of by people around him.
I:15286;1332;the film is also quite funny.
I:15286;1333;He is constantly talking to himself trying to make sense of his surrounding.
I:15286;1334;i guarantee that this is one movie you'll have to watch twice.
I:15286;1335;And be sure you will recommend it to others.
I:15286;1336;It was in the most often seen place, on his hand!
I:15286;1337;Memento is definitely my personal favorite movie.
I:15286;1338;The entire movie keeps the viewer's attention, as it is backwards.
I:15286;1339;It is very fun to watch (alone or in a group).
I:15286;1340;The acting is incredible, and so is the Academy Award nominated script.
I:15286;1341;I would recommend this movie to just about anybody.
I:15286;1342;There are no mistakes and it is completely unpredictable.
I:15286;1343;term memory and uses notes and tattoos to help him hunt down the man who murdered his wife.
I:15286;1344;Employing a relatively unique approach to storytelling in a movie, Memento begins at the end and then works slowly backwards, kind of taking two steps back for every step forward.
I:15286;1345;While initially somewhat disconcerting, it's eventually revealed to be a wondrously effective method that, to an extent, mirrors some of the confusion felt by Leonard.
I:15286;1346;The most crucial information he has tattooed on his body, and his entire body is crosshatched with inked information.
I:15286;1347;the most chilling of which is written backwards on his chest so he can read it in the mirror.
I:15286;1348;anne Moss have absolutely killer roles and performances as supporting characters, and Guy Pearce's portrayal of Leonard is convincing beyond all measure.
I:15286;1349;The plot is so simple, it is complicated.
I:15286;1350;Each detail of the movie is important.
I:15286;1351;Couple this with the fact that there are some dubious characters taking advantage of him so that he can carry out their dirty work and you've got a beautifully shot, cleverly acted story.
I:15286;1352;I highly recommend it, as it truly one of the best movies I've seen.
I:15286;1353;Disc 1 was pretty easy.
I:15286;1354;I managed to find the Director's Shooting Script that correspond to the film in multi.
I:15286;1355;Undoubtably it was fun for the first minute.
I:15286;1356;It's one of the best movies I've seen in years.
I:15286;1357;Both discs are set up like a psychological test!
I:15286;1358;Depending on how you answer the questions is how you get to your features!
I:15286;1359;If you answer one question wrong you can get sent right back to the main menu.
I:15286;1360;However the movie [is excellent] so if you enjoy watching Indy films at their best then this is one for you!
I:15286;1361;Thank you for your time!
I:15286;1362;This is a very comprehensively produced piece of home entertainment.
I:15286;1363;this is one I will watch again and again.
I:15286;1364;"MEMENTO: Christopher Nolan's groundbreaking film that revealed to the world that he was one of the most unique new voices in cinema
I:15286;1365;Guy Pearce is the kind of actor who never seems to get the acclaim he so richly deserves, and he's astonishing as Leonard.
I:15286;1366;Joey Pants (Pantoliano) is chewing up a good deal of scenery in this film and certainly appears to steal some scenes, but Pearce's self.
I:15286;1367;effacing charm and quiet intensity make you unable to take your eyes off him.
I:15286;1368;when you get right down to it, the film ultimately belongs to Nolan.
I:15286;1369;Being inside of a mind like that is such a disturbing place to be, and I think that's what keeps me from watching the film again, but I can still say without a doubt, I still realize what a powerful, suspenseful and great film MEMENTO is, and I am doubly glad that Chris Nolan continues to make films that not only defy Hollywood convention, but they also push you and challenge your ideas.
I:15286;1370;In another life, Nolan designed great mazes and created great riddles.
I:15286;1371;with the exception of INSOMNIA, which is a film I respect but don't like, Nolan has made some of the very best films of the last decade.
I:15286;1372;From THE PRESTIGE to BATMAN BEGINS to THE DARK KNIGHT to INCEPTION and MEMENTO, Nolan is now a name on par with the very best cinema has to offer.
I:15286;1373;Everything looks new, which is saying something because of all the stuff that they packed into the special edition.
I:15286;1374;An unusual look at the loss of identity.
I:15286;1375;Christopher Nolan pieces together the shattered life of Leonard Shelby, very effectively conveying the sense of schizophrenia.
I:15286;1376;Guy Pearce puts in another fine performance, capturing the manic edge of the protagonist as he struggles to solve the vexing riddle of his identity.
I:15286;1377;The story itself is rather simple, but Nolan's sharp editing makes it a movie to remember.
I:15286;1378;Memento is one of the best films I have ever seen.
I:15286;1379;Memento boldly tests Hollywood filmmaking and logic.
I:15286;1380;If you want to see a good movie see Memento.
I:15286;1381;Christopher Nolan hands down, is the best new filmmaker.
I:15286;1382;Guy Pearce does a fantastic job as Leonard Shelby.
I:15286;1383;anne Moss also does a great job as the snotty Natilie.
I:15286;1384;And Joe Pantoliano does a good job as the back.
I:15286;1385;see this movie, but beware becuase you are in fun an awesome treat!
I:15286;1386;There was never really any realistic chance that it would win the Oscar for Best Editing that it so richly deserved.
I:15286;1387;Go to the video store right now.
I:15286;1388;I love the case for this edition.
I:15286;1389;The extras are pretty nice, but I love this movie, so I would recommend this movie anyway.
I:15286;1390;Memento is the film that started the career of one of our most gifted and successful directors, Christopher Nolan, and it remains his finest work.
I:15286;1391;the storyline was appealing and interesting.
I:15286;1392;those who tolerate movies with this language may find it enjoyable.
I:15286;1393;This movie is a testament to Christopher Nolan's artistic ability to direct a well crafted thriller and still tell a tragic story about loss, love, justice, and manipulation.
I:15286;1394;The movie works in reverse, so the thriller is even more compelling.
I:15286;1395;The reason Memento is so amazing is that it's told in reverse.
I:15286;1396;It's completely unique, a trend.
I:15286;1397;It's a truly amazing idea that keeps a viewer slightly off.
I:15286;1398;either way, the movie is incredibly well made, and a unique idea amidst a sea of retread garbage typically put out by major Hollywood productions.
I:15286;1399;the director Christopher Nolan is the greatest screenwriter in hollywood,now also on my top directors list.
I:15286;1400;Strikingly original and gloriously film.
I:15286;1401;noir, Memento is a rare film that finds the perfect marriage between substance and style without sacrificing the tension, drama, and humor in its well.
I:15286;1402;director Christoper Nolan, and adapted from one of this own short stories, Memento engages audiences of all levels in a murder mystery of the first caliber.
I:15286;1403;school choice and a masterful way to tell a story, the story is told in 10.
I:15286;1404;In fact, one could make the case that Memento is a meditation on the meaning and reliability of memory in and of itself, but I'll leave that one to the scholars.
I:15286;1405;format Region 1 version, seen here, has an interview and the incredible Memento website on it (which, I should note, adds to the story, but only look at it after you've seen the movie, because it might spoil some things).
I:15286;1406;the American version will be just fine.
I:15286;1407;The picture and sound are great, and the chronological mode is basically, as a friend put it, a gimmick.
I:15286;1408;And, with a movie as good as this, we can live without a commentary.
I:15286;1409;This was a great movie the first time I watched, it kept me intreged well after it had ended but the more I thought about it, the more I realized how badly it was writen.
I:15286;1410;If so, Leonard might be the one with the drugs or working with Sammy to steal from the dealers.
I:15286;1411;Teddy, a crooked cop and a lier, uses Leonard to find the man doing the drug deal (who is a John G) and kill him for the drug money.
I:15286;1412;When John G is dead, Teddy shows up to get the drug money but Leonard takes it instead and steals John's car before Teddy can get it from him.
I:15286;1413;During this time Teddy keeps showing up and sending anonymous messages to Leonard to mislead him.
I:15286;1414;Natalie identifies the license plate number as Teddy's and gives it to Leonard.
I:15286;1415;The finnal clue is the license plate number.
I:15286;1416;I liked this movie because it intrigued me.
I:15286;1417;this is truly a great movie.
I:15286;1418;The best movie I have seen all year.
I:15286;1419;Maybe the best movie I have seen in about two years.
I:15286;1420;Guy Pearce is excellent in this movie.
I:15286;1421;This makes for a very interesting plot device.
I:15286;1422;I look forward to watching it several more times to see what further interpetations I can gleam from this great movie.
I:15286;1423;This movie will be a classic.
I:15286;1424;rated and not popular, was possibly one of the best films of the year 2000.
I:15286;1425;So Leanord gets tattoos and writes notes to remind himself who he's searching for and important things that he has discovered.
I:15286;1426;Along with the plot, the cinematography is superb.
I:15286;1427;I recommend this to any film.
I:15286;1428;If you're sick of seeing movies like American Pie and Scary Movie, Memento is a fresh change of pace.
I:15286;1429;provoking inner dialogues about the nature of the self, the soul, time, and memory.
I:15286;1430;The acting is fantastic, cryptic, as we aren't sure how much Leonard really knows about himself (and he doesn't know how much he knows either!)
I:15286;1431;A masterpiece that should have won some Oscars.
I:15286;1432;this movie is a master piece this movie is a master piece from the end at the beginning to the beginning at the end you will be wrapping your memory around what is really going on here?
I:15286;1433;but fine, for a good movie, I'll pay the few bucks (that I technically already paid since that was a deciding factor on whether or not I wanted prime to begin with).
I:15286;1434;This film shows the formal qualities of film that can be utilized like no other medium.
I:15286;1435;First time watching it is breathtaking.
I:15286;1436;Second time looses a lot of the magic/wonder, but you start to see HOW this story was constructed in a way that telling it backwards is the most exciting and dynamic way to tell it.
I:15286;1437;Memento was my favorite film last year, and I was very happy to finally find a film that wasn't Planet of the Apes, Tomb Raider, or The Mummy 2.
I:15286;1438;This film is much, much better than any other action movie put out last year.
I:15286;1439;I believe the characteristic of this movie that is most engaging is the subtlety with which aspects of the plot unfold.
I:15286;1440;Subtlety is in very short supply in modern movies, and I was happy to see that it played a very large part in Memento.
I:15286;1441;the actors gave excellent performances.
I:15286;1442;decision roles that make you empathize with them, and yet sometimes you are reviled by them.
I:15286;1443;the best film of the year last year, and I applaud them for making it.
I:15286;1444;Guy Pearce is Leonard, a man that has a rare brain disorder that impairs his short term memory.
I:15286;1445;You learn more and more as you go into the movie, the more we go backwards into Leonard's life.
I:15286;1446;This film really makes you think, and in the end, you're really taken for a loop.
I:15286;1447;Memento is one of these movies you have to see twice.
I:15286;1448;Pearce is excellent, the suspense is there, and there is alot of suprise as well.
I:15286;1449;The movie unfolds backwards as you watch it so that, by the end, you finally figure out how it's all started.
I:15286;1450;the writing on this movie is excellent and, like The Sixth Sense, it's one of those flicks you'll want to watch again and again to really try to make sense of it.
I:15286;1451;The ending is quite possibly the greatest example of movie producing I've ever seen, and the two hours after it don't leave me with any complaints either.
I:15286;1452;this movie is incredibly intelligent, and I presume it will go underappreciated .
I:15286;1453;The acting, cinematography, and above all else, writing in this movie is unparalleled.
I:15286;1454;no offense, but I have friends like you.
I:15286;1455;The movie makes me question my notions of truth and reality, perception and emotion, love and trust.
I:15286;1456;The primary and secondary actors performed their roles well.
I:15286;1457;The editing and sets were not great, but the story is what draws you in.
I:15286;1458;It is an amazing experience.
I:15286;1459;the movie is an unique experience and well worth watching.
I:15286;1460;Yes ,this is a fine film.
I:15286;1461;If you liked pl, 23, fermats room (my personal favorite ) ,exam and the like then you will also enjoy Memento.
I:15286;1462;"this movie is a very ""on the edge"" thriller."
I:15286;1463;Its probably best not to descibe this film as a thriller but the plot has us guessing and trying to find a solution to a complex puzzle.
I:15286;1464;My memory of seeing , touching and using a similar item.
I:15286;1465;now this film is certaintly not about pencils but it is about perceptions and memories Our journey throughout is about questioning our protagonist memories or lack of and the way he preceives what is in front of his eyes and in our minds.
I:15286;1466;The director,editor and script gives us a very interesting ride.
I:15286;1467;One was Requiem for a Dream which is enough to drive a person right over the edge with sheer intensity, the other is Memento.
I:15286;1468;i've talked to people who've expressed frustration over how difficult this movie is to follow, but to me, that's what makes it so great.
I:15286;1469;It commands your attention and it makes you THINK.
I:15286;1470;pilot and cruise along unchallanged.
I:15286;1471;Do your brain a favor and treat it to one of the most original and thought provoking movies of the last decade or so.
I:15286;1472;Your brain will thank you.
I:15286;1473;Leonard Shelby (Pearce) is obsessed with finding the man who murdered his wife.
I:15286;1474;joe Pantoliano stars as Teddy, a person who befriends Leonard and tries to help him find the killer.
I:15286;1475;"It was hard to keep track of the plot, and I really had to ""work"" to watch the movie and keep track of the events."
I:15286;1476;Thus, I only recommend this movie to people who have a sharp sense of detail, and who can follow events very closely.
I:15286;1477;My opinion is my own and I hold no ill feeling to those that enjoyed this movie.
I:15286;1478;It was entertaining to see how the movie progressed.
I:15286;1479;The performances were excellent, as was the script.
I:15286;1480;anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano all carry the movie so well.
I:15286;1481;And I do know something about art, I was an art major in college.
I:15286;1482;A film noir, with quite a few laughs along the way, told backwards about a man who experiences short term memory loss from an attack that also involved his wife.
I:15286;1483;But are they really?While Memento is primarily an enthralling suspense/thriller about a man in search for an attacker/killer, it also delivers intriguing, philosophical reflections by the main character about the accuracy of memories which we develop over a lifetime.
I:15286;1484;Every actor delivers a strong performance there is nothing weak about this film.
I:15286;1485;watch it at least twice, Memento is mind.
I:15286;1486;minded vengeance focused on finding the murderer of your beloved wife and you have a volatile mixture for increased interest and high drama.
I:15286;1487;The driving force for bringing this unique premise to the big screen is the product of the collaborative efforts of Director Chris Nolan and Columbia Tri.
I:15286;1488;Their efforts in creating a story that stimulates our intellect and traps us in its' snare of plot twists for the entire duration of the movie is an achievement and makes this a must see for anyone looking for change a pace from the typical drama.
I:15286;1489;"further adding to this unique premise is the fact that the story is told in an unnatural reverse sequence
I:15286;1490;The viewer roots for Leonard due to his absolute devotion to finding his wife's killer through many of the creative efforts he utilizes to overcome his affliction.
I:15286;1491;With all of these elements combined, this movie fulfills the role of achieving the highest excellence in film for this genre and creates a superior classic psychological drama for all to enjoy.
I:15286;1492;Rarely have I watched a film that demanded that I pay such rapt attention to detail.
I:15286;1493;I had to expend a lot of mental energy comparing the events in each segment and piecing together what I thought actually happened.
I:15286;1494;"It is worth energy to figure out though!For those who don't know, ""Memento"" is a story of a man who loses his wife in a rape attack inside their home, pledging that he will track down a murderer for revenge and peace of mind."
I:15286;1495;Indeed this film is excellent and played with my emotions, emotions of sympathy, anger and questioning my own morals and judgments.
I:15286;1496;Peirce is exceptional as the lead, and the characters that come into contact with him also give fine performances (notably Carrie.
I:15286;1497;the film is beautifully shot and the editing and photography is even better.
I:15286;1498;The best part: the film starts at the end and works it way to a middle point.
I:15286;1499;The film has such a great Psychological deepness and by all means breaks the conventional art that goes into filmmaking.
I:15286;1500;It greatly deserved that award and Nolan greatly deserved best director for it.
I:15286;1501;One of the best films I've ever seen.
I:15286;1502;memento was the most refreshing movie I've seen since iThe Matrix/i, which is pretty funny when you consider it has both Carrie.
I:15286;1503;this movie will entertain you, but more importantly it will make you think.
I:15286;1504;Think about who you are, what defines you, how people perceive you, and how you perceive yourself.
I:15286;1505;One of the best movies I have seen in a long time
I:15286;1506;memento, although admittedly founded on an idea that makes so sense whatsoever, hits the mark as surrealism and an intriguing cinematic delve into extreme abnormality.
I:15286;1507;the movie may be a metaphor for the human condition rather than a mere whimsical narrative by a brain damaged character given backwards:the meanings and goals we set in our lives are provisional, abstract, and we actually have no idea if they any 'reality' beyond the parameters of our own minds.
I:15286;1508;This movie is amazing, I had heard good things from many people so i bit the bullet and bought it on Amazon UnBox, I was not Dissapointed.
I:15286;1509;malls is the backdrop for Christopher Nolan's hypnotic tale, Memento.
I:15286;1510;i have racked my brain for a film to compare with Memento, and the best parallel I can draw is to Hitchcock's masterpiece Vertigo.
I:15286;1511;ann Moss and Joe Pantoliano give expert supporting performances as Leonard's acquaintances, but the molten core of Memento is Guy Pearce's Leonard, a man teetering on the brink of madness, clinging desperately shreds of reality.
I:15286;1512;such as tattooing important information on his body.
I:15286;1513;to keep his life in some kind of order.
I:15286;1514;One of the film's unforgettable scenes shows Leonard frantically searching for a pen to write down a critical piece of information.
I:15286;1515;Such is life for Leonard.
I:15286;1516;always desperate, always searching, a moment away from oblivion.
I:15286;1517;Memento's conclusion is immensely satisfying, but the greatest thrill of the movie is watching Leonard's tragic struggle for survival.
I:15286;1518;This movie is a thinker, lots to keep track of.
I:15286;1519;This is one of the most innovative films I've seen in such a long time.
I:15286;1520;It is certainly worthy of the Oscar nod for best Scrrenplay.
I:15286;1521;And that is what life is all about.
I:15286;1522;We create our own realities.
I:15286;1523;Even with amnesia, a person can establish an identity in a few weeks, judge new people and surroundings, and function.
I:15286;1524;Probably you would need to trust a few friends to keep a few key documents and help you update them occasionally.
I:15286;1525;It's a fascinating and suspenseful movie, but one can see that the hero is at a tremendous disadvantage.
I:15286;1526;on the other hand, there are some things the hero knows quite well, and that makes the movie work.
I:15286;1527;"In the movie ""Memento"" starring Guy Pierce, gives a good performance as a man who suffers from a memory disorder in which he can't make new memories after a severe accident with a killer who murdered his wife."
I:15286;1528;He has to rely on his photogrpah notes to catch the murderer.
I:15286;1529;But in the end it all comes out to a great ending.
I:15286;1530;The suspense and intensity is unbelievable.
I:15286;1531;Like I said Guy Pierce gives a good solid performance along with Joey pants, (A friend or a foe).
I:15286;1532;But it still frustrates me when i see a great movie that doesn't get any respect.
I:15286;1533;You wanna see interesting thriller see Memento it won't dissapoint you.
I:15286;1534;The limited edition especially is amazing.
I:15286;1535;Cool artwork and sweet packaging.
I:15286;1536;the menu screens and chapter selections are interesting as well, it gives a good intro to the mood of the movie.
I:15286;1537;The special features are interesting as well, solid commentary, nice behind the scenes, ect.
I:15286;1538;5.1 surround sound and a clear crisp transfer.
I:15286;1539;Memento is a film I had a little trouble following at times and I have to see it again to truly understand it.
I:15286;1540;Still though, it's a really an original piece of work.
I:15286;1541;oh wait, he's chasing me , I love scenes like that.
I:15286;1542;Guy Pearce does a great job in the film too, it's an very unusual role and he handles it very well.
I:15286;1543;Memento is brain twisting and a bit confusing but still, I loved it!
I:15286;1544;But give it your undivided, and you'll find that it haunts you for days, perhaps weeks, after the credits roll.
I:15286;1545;Little details will return, plot points will reveal themselves, incidents will fit together in a new way, and you'll be sitting at work thinking of ways to get off early so you can rush home and see it again.
I:15286;1546;the acting is superb, the look is perfect, the premise is inspired, and the ending (which may take a few minutes to fully grasp) might just be the most jolting twist since the Statue of Liberty poked out of the sand in Planet of the Apes.
I:15286;1547;Odds are that your mind will still be wrapping itself around this thriller until the wee hours.
I:15286;1548;I mean I really liked it, I think its great.
I:15286;1549;Pierce does a great acting job, and the film doesn't insult your intelligence, it makes you work to follow key plot points.
I:15286;1550;People actually have to pay attention to what is going on, which is something that is highly unusual in mainstream American cinema.
I:15286;1551;well the film is backwards.
I:15286;1552;it is a superb mystery about a guy whos wife was murdered but by who.
I:15286;1553;, crisp direction, emotional story, thrilling plot, characters you care about even though you're never really sure if they're 'good' or 'bad', terrific acting, and the best direction.
I:15286;1554;good movie, not a blockbuster, not sexy, but makes you think and care and wonder and beam.
I:15286;1555;I'm happy Nolan went on to such acclaim, but nothing he's done since is 'better' than this diminutive masterpiece.
I:15286;1556;what Chris Nolan does give us is one heck of great film which will keep you absolutely glued to your chair.
I:15286;1557;Things slowly begin to unravel during Memento, and the end manages to completely unglue everything you thought had figured out concerning Guy Pierce's very well acted character, Leonard Stanley.
I:15286;1558;My friend and I have come up with three possible scenarios, which range from plot loophole to a deranged scerial killer with charm.
I:15286;1559;I'm going to have to study it further.
I:15286;1560;I really enjoyed Memento and am very glad that I own it.
I:15286;1561;Memento is one the most thrilling, intense, screwed up films I have ever seen.
I:15286;1562;Besides that it is one of the best written, directed, and acted films I have ever seen.
I:15286;1563;Guy Pearce is very intense and passionate as Leonard, and Carrie Anne Moss gives an equally convincing performance as Danielle.
I:15286;1564;Highly recommended and could be considered one of the years best!
I:15286;1565;It was shipped in a timely manner and was in great shape when I did get it.
I:15286;1566;This movie is gritty, dark, and downright fun.
I:15286;1567;If you haven't watched it, drop everything you're doing and watch it now.
I:15286;1568;Memento is a truly complex and engrossing thriller, full of twists and ambiguous peripheral sub.
I:15286;1569;okay, so it's an original story, and it's also really original insofar as it's a plotline which is told in neither a linear or non.
I:15286;1570;if you only watch it once and understand it completely you're a genius because it's taken me several viewings to get the entire picture.
I:15286;1571;if anyone knows of a better one, please let me know) and found that even after watching Memento in chronological order, it was still engrossing and deeply intricate.
I:15286;1572;The most well crafted film in recent memory.
I:15286;1573;I loved this film but be warned, it may require intense disussion amongst friends at the end of the film.
I:15286;1574;, then this film will be right up your alley.
I:15286;1575;Guy Pearce does an astonishing job in this film and you'd never know he was an Aussie from the vocal job he does in this movie.
I:15286;1576;A thriller with some serious twists.
I:15286;1577;Memento, the innovative and intelligent thriller from Christopher Nolan was certainly one of the best films of 2001 and is one of my personal favorites.
I:15286;1578;Nolan is a gifted director and adapts a screenplay based on a fascinatingly original short story written by his brother, Johnathan Nolan.
I:15286;1579;The film is very unique for many reasons: great performances all around (especially from Joe Pantoliano as Teddy who just about steals the show from Pearce, also Carrie.
I:15286;1580;"anne Moss who proves that she's more than just a pretty face and action star as Trinity from ""The Matrix"" and turns in a superb performance as Natalie."
I:15286;1581;the film is also told in reverse, and starts from the end.
I:15286;1582;Nolan is definetly a talented director, his more conventional follow.
I:15286;1583;"up ""Insomnia,"" (2002) was also great."
I:15286;1584;This film easily rewards repeated viewings.
I:15286;1585;That should most definetly be promising.
I:15286;1586;"Lots of writers can dream up challenging puzzles
I:15286;1587;I give it 5 stars.
I:15286;1588;This is a must see!
I:15286;1589;Follow it closely and you will be amazed.
I:15286;1590;"Happily, ""Memento"" is suspenseful enough to command it."
I:15286;1591;Pearce makes an ideal Leonard, a desperate man skirting insanity, but Pantoliano steals the show as the shady, enigmatic Teddy.
I:15286;1592;This is beyond a doubt the most mind twisting, suspense thriller i've seen in years.
I:15286;1593;I got this the first day it came out and have only gotten to see 1 special feature on it.
I:15286;1594;Those are the three best words to describe this movie.
I:15286;1595;It's the first time I've ever been on the edge of my seat for a movie that starts at the end!
I:15286;1596;Guy Pearce gives a fantastic performance and the rest of the cast off his torment perfectly.
I:15286;1597;The packaging may be a bit daft, but it is at least original, which is befitting one of THE most original movies made from any corner of the industry in years.
I:15286;1598;i promise it will be THE topic of conversation for you when you make it back to work Monday morning.
I:15286;1599;Like that way underappreciated classic, Memento gives you the ending immediately, and then spends the rest of its time showing you how it got there.
I:15286;1600;Each scene offers clues and various revelations.
I:15286;1601;each of which are thrilling mini.
I:15286;1602;the acting is first rate.
I:15286;1603;Guy Pearce, best known as the one who wasn't Russell Crowe in L. a. Confidential , is Leonard, a character who will intrigue you, engage your sympathy, and might even scare you by the end.
I:15286;1604;her performace as Natalie will make you love her, hate her, and make you fiercely protective of her.
I:15286;1605;An unbelievably astonishing plot, constructed so that it makes perfect sense in spite of being told backwards, starting at the end, and ending at the beginning.
I:15286;1606;All the facts about memory functions of the brain are scientifically accurate and well represented in the dialog.
I:15286;1607;I found the film to be utterly absorbing and interesting throughout.
I:15286;1608;All characters are thoroughly believable because the entire cast does such an excellent job.
I:15286;1609;This film is so fascinating that I find myself watching again and again!
I:15286;1610;But I still think it is a great movie!
I:15286;1611;There is much good to be said about Memento.
I:15286;1612;key direction is a big plus (no annoying swells in the soundtrack and such) that adds to the tension.
I:15286;1613;the best thing about it is the story.
I:15286;1614;This is a high concept that is done very well.
I:15286;1615;Not only are you caught up trying to figure out what's going on, but many of the scenes are surprisingly powerful: Leonard's tatoo.
I:15286;1616;A story this complex probably leaves a few goofs in continuity, though it takes some careful observation to spot them.
I:15286;1617;What were they thinking?That said, this is a great movie with mondo potential (demand, almost) for multiple viewings.
I:15286;1618;Leonard shoots one man directly in the head, seeming to kill him.
I:15286;1619;This is Leonard Shelby's final memory.
I:15286;1620;The only thing Leonard has as he begins his search for the man who raped and killed his wife and destroyed his ability to create new memories is a name: John G. this is the basis of Memento, one of the most interesting and imaginative movies ever created.
I:15286;1621;Without the ability to hold a thought for more than a few minutes, Leonard has developed a system of ways to keep track of his investigation through a complex series of notes, photos, and tatoos.
I:15286;1622;It is, however, very effective in this case.
I:15286;1623;as Leonard continues his backward search, he meets up with both allies and enemies, most of those he meets are both.
I:15286;1624;If you watch the whole movie with no or very few interruptions, you will be greatly rewarded with the privalige of watching (and hopefullly understaing) an amazing film.
I:15286;1625;This movie may be too fast paced for most, and not everyone will appreciate the backward story telling (it takes some getting used to), but ultimately this film is worth watching, even if it's only to be able to discuss the ending endlessly with those who watch the movie with you.
I:15286;1626;A really intriguing and terribly confusing film!
I:15286;1627;"If a movie can be deemed a ""Thriller"" or a ""Mystery"" this would be it,people who have seen Nolan's work(with the exception of Dark Knight)The Prestige being a prime example and a movie I enjoyed more than this."
I:15286;1628;With each step back into the past this movie gets better and more intense, and the final scene left me absolutely speechless.
I:15286;1629;written films I have ever seen.
I:15286;1630;A great director, an unusual story line and a very talented Australian actor made this a great movie.
I:15286;1631;Their recent efforts show how good they are.
I:15286;1632;Not many films anymore draw out the characters as well as this one does.
I:15286;1633;This is one of the best movies I have seen in the last few years, and I completely recommend it.
I:15286;1634;Just make sure when you watch it you give it your undivided attention or you will get lost.
I:15286;1635;This movie makes you twist your mind and think around corners.
I:15286;1636;I see this as one of those great 'little' movies that are simply wonderful, like Slingblade.
I:15286;1637;This is a really good movie.
I:15286;1638;anne Moss, and Joe Pantaliano are very good in this.
I:15286;1639;Christopher Nolan directed his brother's story very well.
I:15286;1640;This is the kind of product you can appreciate because it's unique and the layout of the case inside and out reflects the characteristics of the movie.
I:15286;1641;the movie itself is amazing.
I:15286;1642;Someone raped and killed his wife and destroyed his ability to remember, but he's created a system of polaroids, tattoos and very specific notes to take the place of memory.
I:15286;1643;This is accomplished through scenes (each exactly the length of time Leonard can remember before forgetting) in reverse order accompanied with segments of a phone call between Leonard and an unknown caller, describing his condition, letting the audience know exactly what he's capable of, and how he manages to function day.
I:15286;1644;(The movie, on the other hand, is brilliant, and many more things have been said about it than I could say.)
I:15286;1645;This movie is one big juxtaposition and I love it.
I:15286;1646;leonard certainly gets to you.
I:15286;1647;I guess that's a cretit to Guy Pearce's talent as an actor.
I:15286;1648;The humorous aspects of Guy Pearce's Condition are really well.
I:15286;1649;But the second half of the movie abandons the humor of the story and instead turns into a full.
I:15286;1650;It's good still, but not nearly as good as the movie's first part.
I:15286;1651;In fact, I'd say the first hour of this movie is one of the best hours of film I've ever seen.
I:15286;1652;I really enjoyed this movie greatly.
I:15286;1653;it's a great interesting movie.
I:15286;1654;And believe me every scene you will be asking yourself what are the true intentions behind these people.
I:15286;1655;An excellent movie to own.
I:15286;1656;But remember this is a thriller, if you expect an action movie this is not it.
I:15286;1657;this is one of the most original, well directed, and well written movies i've ever seen.
I:15286;1658;this is the kind of movie where you have to watch more than once .
I:15286;1659;Excellent film / Excellent price.
I:15286;1660;see x 2 (you'll want to watch it twice.
I:15286;1661;It's uncommon manner of presentation makes this film unique sets it above the other suspense/thriller movies.
I:15286;1662;We immediately know how it ended right at the start of the movie but what makes it extraordinarily gripping is the series of events that led to its real denouement.
I:15286;1663;Moreover, watching it the 2nd time around makes you comprehend more.
I:15286;1664;My husband I have seen it twice, we still debate as to what has actually transpired.
I:15286;1665;In short I loved this movie!
I:15286;1666;Guy Pearce captures the tortured Leonard perfectly and Carrie.
I:15286;1667;anne Moss is amazing as the femme fatale.
I:15286;1668;For those of you who enjoy a movie with intelligence, rush out and see this movie right now.
I:15286;1669;"At first the direction of the plot was somewhat disorienting
I:15286;1670;The fact that this many people can review a film and still have it rate close to five stars ought to tell you all you need to know about it.
I:15286;1671;for my money, this is one of the most clever and innovative movies I've ever seen.
I:15286;1672;There are enough clever twists and turns in it to hold your attention.
I:15286;1673;The package is worth the coin.
I:15286;1674;Memento is a very inovative movie that keeps you guessing right to the end even if you know who the killer is in the beginning.
I:15286;1675;yep that right you see the end of the story in the beginning and the end which is the beginning is the climax.
I:15286;1676;Leonard played by Guy Pearce is after John G., the man who killed his wife and took away his short term memory.
I:15286;1677;The movie starts with Leonard killing Teddy, rightfully played by Joe Pantoliano.
I:15286;1678;The movie is strengthened by another supporting performance: Carrie.
I:15286;1679;There was a predominant artsy.
I:15286;1680;fartsy intellectualism, you'll probably concede your chances of enjoying the movie.
I:15286;1681;enjoy it, don't take it too seriously.
I:15286;1682;there's always gotta be something at the end.
I:15286;1683;It's just kind of there.
I:15286;1684;What you make of it is up to you.
I:15286;1685;finally, what I enjoy most about this movie is the character development.
I:15286;1686;I think that's true, but I think that's what makes it great.
I:15286;1687;I'm not sure anything in this movie is necessarily brilliant, but I do enjoy the fact that we DON'T know the characters and their integrity.
I:15286;1688;What we're left with is an introspective on truth in relation to perception.
I:15286;1689;we know what we're supposed to do, but even the best of us aren't always inclined to do so.
I:15286;1690;It is a tremendous movie which will surprise and shock you as well as make you think.
I:15286;1691;It was so well done, ingenius concept, direction, and acting.
I:15286;1692;Guy Pearce is just phenomenal and does a wonderful job portraying a man with amnesia.
I:15286;1693;In my opinion, undoubtably one of the best movies ever made.
I:15286;1694;Memento shows us his search in reverse, taking us further and further into memories that Pearse no longer has.
I:15286;1695;This storytelling technique works brilliantly, and never becomes confusing.
I:15286;1696;"If you are a fan of Hitchcock or ""The Usual Suspects,"" you will absolutely love ""Memento""!"
I:15286;1697;This movie is possibly one of the best movies I have ever seen.
I:15286;1698;Christopher Nolan is a genius along with all of his other movies.
I:15286;1699;This movie is very unique and will never get old.
I:15286;1700;What exactly don't you get?I was pleasantly surprised by the bizarre nature of the film.
I:15286;1701;It was a little distracting at first, but my husband and I enjoyed putting the pieces of the puzzle together.
I:15286;1702;And I felt that the ending was pretty self.
I:15286;1703;i really enjoyed this movie.
I:15286;1704;while it might not be the most original film ever made, it certainly was an interesting one.
I:15286;1705;Navigating is a bit confusing, but then again so is the movie :) Good shipping time and in great condition!
I:15286;1706;the Limited edition version is by turns incredible rewarding and distressingly frustrating!
I:15286;1707;it challenges a lot of our assumptions of truth and memory and really forces us to home in on our own ideas of which narrative we believe, and should we trust the narrator.
I:15286;1708;The plot itself is dark and disturbing, yet tinged with a surprising amount of humor ( See, I have this condition. )
I:15286;1709;I actually found this really cool, as each narrative presented by the director is presented as fact, and it's really cool to watch them all back to back with the thought I'm being lied to!
I:15286;1710;very rarely a movie comes along that is so good it makes you rethink everything you once thought about movies.
I:15286;1711;the other special feature I was really looking forward to is the chance to see the whole movie in the correct sequence, which is also buried in Disc 2.
I:15286;1712;Guy Pierce is amazing and delivers an outstanding performance.
I:15286;1713;It's a must own for film fans as well.
I:15286;1714;Memento is one of the best suspence thrillers out there today.
I:15286;1715;Director, Christopher Nolan brings you into a new world where your friends could be your enemies or the other way around.
I:15286;1716;Christopher Nolan (Screenwriter and Director) excells in every aspect of writing a genius script.
I:15286;1717;The dialogue is very real and the characters are fully developed.
I:15286;1718;You will definitely enjoy this movie.
I:15286;1719;This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.
I:15286;1720;If you enjoy a movie that keeps you guessing, you'll love this.
I:15286;1721;The movie was made so that you actually feel what it is like to be in Leonard's had.
I:15286;1722;This gives the watcher a real sense of confusion and disorientation.
I:15286;1723;which leaves you utterly surprised, this movie is a must see.
I:15286;1724;the movie is told in scenes, chronologically reversed.
I:15286;1725;really, you have to fight your way through the story but that's what makes this such a great movie.
I:15286;1726;The plot is fine, the acting is fine, the backwards story isn't as good as the backward episode of Seinfeld, but still fun.
I:15286;1727;A solid movie borrowing heavily from other sources.
I:15286;1728;If one is not familiar with these other works, I am sure Momento is compelling, on the other hand, anyone who watches TV or film regularly will be dissapointed.
I:15286;1729;2) Best Directed film of 2001 3) You have to watch this movie a few times to appreciate it.
I:15286;1730;4) Guy Pearce is a pretty darn good actor, his performance is similar to that given by Christian Bale in American Psycho.
I:15286;1731;I happen to enjoy the way that each of the film's scenes tells a story unto itself.
I:15286;1732;It kind of socked you right between the eyes and I love that kind of non.
I:15286;1733;It was intense from start to finish.
I:15286;1734;I highly recommend this film for anyone who is into edgy, dark drama.
I:15286;1735;This film is single handedly one of the greatest achievements in filmmaking.
I:15286;1736;the film starts out at the end of the film and works its way backwards.
I:15286;1737;along the way he meets a few characters who are quite suspiscious, and until the end you can't trust any of them.
I:15286;1738;This film is exceptionally done and it leaves you feeling with a new look and respect for filmmaking.
I:15286;1739;The film is amazing, and if you've never seen it before, I highly recommend it.
I:15286;1740;It was fun to be able to watch it in chronological order but I recommend watching it in the original form for anyone that haven't seen it.
I:15286;1741;The Acting, storyline, twists in the plot, all keep you guessing.
I:15286;1742;Thinking of anyone who may suffer from this affliction helps really get what it is like for them.
I:15286;1743;this is truly an enterprising way to choreograph a film .
I:15286;1744;stars to this bewitching and intriguing film.
I:15286;1745;christopher Nolan directs this absolutely engaging film of a man with memory disorder who is hunting down his wife's killer.
I:15286;1746;Kudos to Nolan for the genius in assembling this mind.
I:15286;1747;Guy Pearce, in his first starring role, perfectly nails the leading man, the forgetful Lenny Shelby.
I:15286;1748;The movie unfolds backwards in 15 minute increments, and it is up to the perceptive attentive viewer to piece the puzzle together and figure out this filmatic enigma.
I:15286;1749;if you desire a challenging, yet fun film, this is it.
I:15286;1750;I guarantee you will watch it more than once.
I:15286;1751;It is rare these day to see a truly original movie.
I:15286;1752;It is a bit more cerebral than most Hollywood flicks so you'll have to pay a little more attention than usual.
I:15286;1753;The movie begins at the end and works its way to the beginning, resulting in a very thought provoking and enteraining film.
I:15286;1754;I highly reccommend it, and would give it 4 1/2 stars if possible.
I:15286;1755;But see it, you won't be dissapointed.
I:15286;1756;price, this is a must.
I:15286;1757;as they see it, the case is open.
I:15286;1758;the most effective way Christopher Nolan found to confuse the viewer (as much as Leonard must have been) was to portray the film in ten.
I:15286;1759;the entire cast was well.
I:15286;1760;anne Moss as the highly intriguing Natalie.
I:15286;1761;"Joe Pantoliano (Moss' co. star in ""The Matrix"") was also excellent as John G./Teddy."
I:15286;1762;Memento is a masterpiece, and if you love amazing movies that make you think, this one is a keeper.
I:15286;1763;Clear a two hour space in your schedule to watch it, and then add an extra hour or so while you flick back through the film and attempt to come to terms with what you've just witnessed.
I:15286;1764;It really does help to have the brain cells firing on all cylinders for this film!Memento is one of the most original and intelligent (not to mention funny and profound) films of the last decade.
I:15286;1765;the story revolves around the character of Leonard Shelby, (played wonderfully by Guy Pearce), a man who has no short.
I:15286;1766;in order to place the viewer in a similar state to the protagonist, the film has a unique structure, beginning at the end of the movie chronologically, and working its way backwards through time in small (10 .
I:15286;1767;there is also a wonderful kind of twist at the (actual) end of the film, which completely changes your views on what has transpired and no matter how good you are at guessing the ending of films, this one is going to catch you out.
I:15286;1768;How Christopher Nolan managed to cultivate such an intriguing and intricate story as this is astonishing.
I:15286;1769;the performances of the three main leads are superb.
I:15286;1770;Guy Pearce plays Shelby with the perfect amount of bewilderment, ironic humour, and pathos.
I:15286;1771;It is essential to the way the story works that we feel empathy for his character and his situation, and Pearce manages this brilliantly.
I:15286;1772;ann Moss puts in a great performance as Natalie, one of the two main characters whom Leonard comes into contact with.
I:15286;1773;She manages to remain ambivalent all the way through the film, and one is never sure whether to trust her or not.
I:15286;1774;ann Moss'), is ambivalent throughout, but he manages to remain wonderfully charismatic.
I:15286;1775;He keeps us guessing about what it is that he knows about Leonard and his past all the way through the movie.
I:15286;1776;i can't recommend this film highly enough, particularly to those who enjoy thrillers, or giving their brain a good work out during a film.
I:15286;1777;Keeps you on the edge of your seat.
I:15286;1778;Once in a great while, a movie comes along and absolutely blows my mind .
I:15286;1779;instead of unforgettable ones like this one.
I:15286;1780;In the end, everything you took as a given is shaken .
I:15286;1781;And the more I thought through it, the more amazed I became.
I:15286;1782;constructed mystery has the advantage over average thrillers with a startingly.
I:15286;1783;The whole backwards premise works amazingly well, and is one of the best ideas ever devised for a film, reminiscant of PULP FICTION.
I:15286;1784;G provides for some chilling moments.
I:15286;1785;Director Nolan does the best with the inventive tricks and piecing together the plot machinations.
I:15286;1786;And extra kudos for the editor, not to mention the brooding score throughout the film's running time.
I:15286;1787;In short, it's a fantastic film, and deserves to be placed high in the great Film Noir masterpieces.
I:15286;1788;I could just ruin the mystery and tell you how to do it, but where's the fun in that?
I:15286;1789;as for the movie itself, it is a great one.
I:15286;1790;First and formost this is a very good film.
I:15286;1791;One of the best movies I saw on Netflix streaming.
I:15286;1792;I liked it so much I bought it here after canceling Netflix.
I:15286;1793;It shows scenes and eventually you arrive at the whole picture.
I:15286;1794;If you like movies such as The Prestige, The Illusionist, or Inception you will probably enjoy this film as well.
I:15286;1795;I've never seen anything like this before, refreshing and original(mainly in the way the story is told).
I:15286;1796;I will see Dark Knight Rises and will always respect him as a visionary filmmaker(or once was) because of this masterpiece.
I:15286;1797;Memento can obviously be described in many ways.
I:15286;1798;I see it pretty much as a mind boggling and extremely original movie that is extraordinarily inventive in how it's told.
I:15286;1799;I simply cannot think of any other film that I've seen that has been portrayed in such a manner and oddly enough, it works wonderfully for this thriller.
I:15286;1800;simply put, to make this movie work, it had to take some of Hollywood's best on screen talents and that is exactly what the producers of this film came up with.
I:15286;1801;Guy Pearce's performance as a man who cannot make new memories is stunning to say the least.
I:15286;1802;anne Moss of Matrix fame performs brilliantly, showing that she definitely has talents outside of the Matrix.
I:15286;1803;Joe Pantoliano, most recently acclaimed for his performance during his stint on The Sopranos, performs exceptionally well in this film, just showing that he gets better and better with every role.
I:15286;1804;the movie was based on an original short story by Jonathan Nolan and Christopher Nolan took it and ran with it, culminating in this extremely intriguing revenge thriller.
I:15286;1805;Christopher Nolan most certainly deserves all the praise and accolades he has and continues to receive for the originality of concept in the screenplay and his directing performance of this film.
I:15286;1806;What follows from there is an intriguing tale in which Leonard, who is constantly taking Polaroid snapshots, making notes and doing self tattoo's to remind him of the facts, attempts to seek revenge upon the person responsible for his wife's death.
I:15286;1807;i would definitely recommend this mind boggling, well told revenge thriller for any and all who are interested in this type of film, Guy Pearce's performance alone makes this film one to watch!
I:15286;1808;I really enjoyed this movie for it's uniqe chronology, and for the numerous other reasons I'm sure have already been mentioned here.
I:15286;1809;If you must do this give me an option to see a real menu.
I:15286;1810;boggling thriller that changes your reaction since it's told in reverse.
I:15286;1811;This is definitely the most original movie in a long time.
I:15286;1812;It includes good acting and a great plot.
I:15286;1813;Guy Pearce portrayed his character flawlessly and made it completely believable.
I:15286;1814;Carrie Ann Moss and Joe Pantoliano also turned in wonderful performances.
I:15286;1815;The plot was good and played out beautifully.
I:15286;1816;This movie is one of the best thrillers and rates way up there with the likes of Fight Club and The Matrix.
I:15286;1817;I am a fan of Guy Pearce cause lets face it, the mans hot.
I:15286;1818;This is my idea of the perfect triller and the fact that u knew what happens after it already happens but not sure why it did happen is the coolest, lol, it was perfect.
I:15286;1819;I was mezmoried by this film, perfect.
I:15286;1820;A supremely intelligent and sensitive man, he remembers everything up to the point he became ill, but now exists in a perpetual and bewildering now.
I:15286;1821;Yet he is able to play a piece of music from start to finish with no trouble, because each moment of the music flows seamlessly into the next.
I:15286;1822;He has a touching relationship with his wife .
I:15286;1823;wearing's plight as presented in the film forces us to confront what it means to be human .
I:15286;1824;Memento is a thriller based on this interesting and compelling condition, with the scenes in reverse order, so the audience does not remember what happened any more than the main character, who suffers from a milder form of Wearing's condition, does.
I:15286;1825;Prisoner of Consciousness, if you can find it, is a far superior and ultimately more moving film.
I:15286;1826;Since the edges of the scenes overlap by a few seconds, we are able to piece them together to form a continuum.
I:15286;1827;brilliant in concept, well executed and well acted, this film is a spellbinding puzzle that is engrossing from beginning to end.
I:15286;1828;I think the film achieves a perfectly reasonable balance, considering these constraints.
I:15286;1829;as Leonard Shelby, Guy Pierce delivers a fine, low.
I:15286;1830;key performance: that of a man whose emotions are sometimes grayed by the trauma of a life that has come unraveled.
I:15286;1831;however the finest performance of the film is by Carrie.
I:15286;1832;the movie is not perfect, and not for everyone, but I found it well worth the viewing.
I:15286;1833;Highly recommended but make sure you take notes!
I:15286;1834;I just saw this movie and I have not had a chance to think about it very much yet, but the idea that everything is in the perception is always an intriguing one.
I:15286;1835;a brilliant way to isolate pure perception from interpretation.
I:15286;1836;Anything that shows how the passage of time affects our memory and opinions is a winner.
I:15286;1837;(even though it was a small one) He made some smart casting decisions by casting the always great Guy Pierce as Lenny and surrounding him with a cast of solid supportive character actors.
I:15286;1838;They both give excellent performances.
I:15286;1839;Guy Pierce particularly sells this film with his continually ability to make the fact his characters memories keep disappearing believable.
I:15286;1840;what Christopher Nolan loves to do, and does well, is winding a plot that makes it difficult to separate the reality from the fiction.
I:15286;1841;He is striving for more than just a simple plot hook with a twist at the end.
I:15286;1842;A Nolan film is unmistakeable in its artistic value.
I:15286;1843;Its dark gritty, and his style is very distinct.
I:15286;1844;watch it, Memento is truly a great movie.
I:15286;1845;The most important thing is that the ending fit.
I:15286;1846;term memory is utterly fascinating.
I:15286;1847;But what makes Memento great is what writer/director Christopher Nolan does with that clever idea.
I:15286;1848;Pulp Fiction films that plays around with the time should just calm down and realize the story is simply being told in a regressive manner, with each scene taking us back for the next key piece in the puzzle.
I:15286;1849;If you have seen a better film noir than Memento, I bet it was in black and white.
I:15286;1850;so the movie itself it first class first of all .
I:15286;1851;very nice to watch but only after you've seen the original sequence of the feature.
I:15286;1852;the first one is a continuation of the commentary from the rest of the film, i. e. talking about the movie etc., two other commentary tracks concern teddy's character with opposing views about him in each track.
I:15286;1853;finaly the fourth alternate commentary is the most interesting just because it's recorded backwards!
I:15286;1854;finally guy pearce in great in this movie and boy was i surprised to learn he's the guy from Priscilla Queen of the Desert!
I:15286;1855;Great acting altogether and amazing editing.
I:15286;1856;I originally wanted to watch it because I am a huge Jorja Fox fan and she stars in it.
I:15286;1857;He can remember everything in his life perfectly up until that omnious night.
I:15286;1858;This is a deep movie and it took me a couple of times watching it to understand a few things.
I:15286;1859;Great movie with a lot of suspense.
I:15286;1860;This is one of Christopher Nolan's finest.
I:15286;1861;If you enjoyed Inception you should definitely pick this movie up as well.
I:15286;1862;office smash, this film is for people who enjoy storyline over special FX/car chases etc. the film starts with the end of the story and works its way back.
I:15286;1863;You are kept guessing the whole time.
I:15286;1864;Funny, Eddie and The Cruisers begat my exposure to Memento.
I:15286;1865;There's a memory I could live without.
I:15286;1866;memento is without a doubt one of the greatest movies of all time and maybe the best movie of the new millenium.
I:15286;1867;It's originality, and phenominal script out do any other movie I have ever viewed.
I:15286;1868;Guy Pearce and John Pantaliono give amazing performances and Christopher Nolan's abilitys as a director and screen writer portrayed in this movie are simply unfathomable.
I:15286;1869;who appreciates GREAT film and a good suspense story.
I:15286;1870;the supporting cast make this movie even more interesting.
I:15286;1871;Leonard (main character) interacts with these people based on the messages he writes on their pictures.
I:15286;1872;If you like movies that exercise the brain, this is a good one for you!
I:15286;1873;You'll be on the edge of your seat and asking questions the entire way through!
I:15286;1874;This is a great movie!
I:15286;1875;Uses film in a creative way to tell a story.
I:15286;1876;Well acted, tightly drawn mystery, told in a spellbinding way.
I:15286;1877;Be sure that you have full concentration as you will need it.
I:15286;1878;It was delivered in a timely manner.
I:15286;1879;Brilliantly directed by Christopher Nolan, who also wrote the screenplay based on a short story by his brother, Jonathan Nolan, this film had to be a huge challenge for all.
I:15286;1880;And he also tattoos things he wants to remember all over his body.
I:15286;1881;The role calls out for an exceptional actor and Guy Pearce certainly does rise to the occasion.
I:15286;1882;I found myself drawn to him, identifying with his condition, and joining him in his struggle to relate to the world.
I:15286;1883;the story unfolds backwards, an unusual narrative technique that is tricky to use.
I:15286;1884;While I tend to want films to have a beginning, middle and end, and a story line that is easy to follow, this an exception to the rule.
I:15286;1885;I definitely recommend to those who are willing to explore this unique film, which is certainly one of a kind.
I:15286;1886;I can figure out how most movies are going to end up long before the conclusion, therefore I appreciate it when I can't.
I:15286;1887;This is one of those rare movies.
I:15286;1888;One of the most mind bending movies ever.
I:15286;1889;I have recommended and given this movie to so many people.
I:15286;1890;I love it when I finish a movie and have to ask my husband, So what do you think was real?
I:15286;1891;On the plus side:The cinematography was decent.
I:15286;1892;The tension and suspense were palpable.
I:15286;1893;the plot twists were mesmerizing.
I:15286;1894;Everything about this movie is perfect.
I:15286;1895;It's suspenseful and keeps you guessing until the very end.
I:15286;1896;"Then got really into storyline, the ""who do you trust"" aspect."
I:15286;1897;Guy Pearce was really good, really carried the film.
I:15286;1898;"Enjoyed it overall, but liked ""Usual Suspects"" more."
I:15286;1899;Makes me look at Tom Hanks 'Mr. Short Term Memory' skits on SNL in a new way.
I:15286;1900;600+ reviews, average of 4 1/2 stars, good to great reviews stressing originality.
I:15286;1901;Similarly, the film takes you back to show how it led up to the final.
I:15286;1902;This is a intricate crime story, and somewhat confusing to watch.
I:15286;1903;He is a former insurance investigator, very aware of his handicap, explaining to people in great detail why he has trouble knowing them or remembering what he told them.
I:15286;1904;The two sequences come together at the end of the film.
I:15286;1905;She offers to run the license plate on Leonard's latest tattoo to help in his investigation.
I:15286;1906;the ending is somewhat of a surprise if you can figure out the movie's timeline.
I:15286;1907;"What makes ""Memento"" unique is the fact that the movie goes in reverse."
I:15286;1908;The movie begins on the last scene and works its way through each scene backwards until (at the end of the film) you reach the beginning of the story.
I:15286;1909;To go back to it, savor it, catch all the nuances and the beauty of the performances (or in the case of Memento, the editing!)
I:15286;1910;and truly experience the film.
I:15286;1911;beautifully filmed and written, with a fine performance by Guy Pearce, and a great supporting actor role by a Polaroid camera.
I:15286;1912;The movie is an intense experience in filmmaking and film watching!
I:15286;1913;see it over and over, if you wish.
I:15286;1914;I really enjoyed this movie.
I:15286;1915;If you like really screwy but really good movies you should definitly see this.
I:15286;1916;Then add to that that now he is on a mission to find the man who did this, but because he has this condition he has to take pictures and write notes to aid him and you have the makings of a great story.
I:15286;1917;Now you need a great screenplay, great acting, and great direction.
I:15286;1918;You get all this and more in this wonderful movie.
I:15286;1919;This is sheer genius storytelling, because we as the audience are swept up in this story along with Leonard as we too try to figure out who's the real villian.
I:15286;1920;I loved the way the movie was made.
I:15286;1921;Memento is an incredible movie about a guy who has no short.
I:15286;1922;The movie options on the disc are probably the most complicated I have ever seen.
I:15286;1923;I must admit it does fit the theme of the film quite well and it's definitely original.
I:15286;1924;There is also an easter egg that allows you to watch the film in chronological order.
I:15286;1925;"special Feature:* ""Remembering Memento"" ."
I:15286;1926;I would rate the film 5 stars and the packaging and content 4 stars.
I:15286;1927;It is a very original and well.
I:15286;1928;the acting is superb on all counts, as each actor plays their role perfectly.
I:15286;1929;, but if the viewer is willing to relax his or her sense of reality, the plot is deeply engrossing.
I:15286;1930;I highly recommend this film.
I:15286;1931;The Sammy Jankis business is a dreamy conflation of a real story with events from Leonard's own marriage, events so horrifying and guilt.
I:15286;1932;A figure walks across the front of the camera .
I:15286;1933;But as Leonard himself tells Teddy fairly early on, Memory's unreliable .
I:15286;1934;Leonard tells us that Sammy ends up there.
I:15286;1935;But Teddy tells us that Leonard's nuts, and then there's that flash in which we see Leonard himself there
I:15286;1936;This sort of movie is not really my thing, but I enjoyed it just the same, and I can recognize it certainly is a fine movie.
I:15286;1937;I prefer more visually appealing screen blockbuster action.
I:15286;1938;type flicks with lots of special effects myself, but there are a lot of classic movies I enjoy, and this one will probably become a classic in its own right.
I:15286;1939;the overall premise is quite interesting, since the scenes occur in reverse order, as you watch the memory.
I:15286;1940;Pearce does an excellent job in the role, as he methodically gathers the evidence and tries to sort it all out depite his memory impairment.
I:15286;1941;Pearce does just that, and by taking photos and writing notes on them, he is able to remind himself of the facts he has discovered during the course of his investigation and ultimately solve the mystery.
I:15286;1942;i also enjoyed Pearce's role as the professor in the recent remake of the Time Machine.
I:15286;1943;All in all a fine flick and worth seeing even if you're not into more thoughtful kinds of movies like this one.
I:15286;1944;This is a really strange movie that will definitely keep your interest.
I:15286;1945;How better to document your moves than memos. . . this is a very well written movie and after seeing it on cable, I had to have it so I could watch it whenever I wanted.
I:15286;1946;Original Plot, great acting (Pantoliano was awesome).
I:15286;1947;Great editing, and eerie music, What a classic!!
I:15286;1948;The best thriller of recent years!
I:15286;1949;The final line of Pearce character was the best of the year!!
I:15286;1950;Eventually, you will put certain flashbacks and fast.
I:15286;1951;"forwards together and be stunned at the ""real"" story."
I:15286;1952;The packaging is very creative.
I:15286;1953;This is a film about the dialectics of remembrance and oblivion, about the question of the existance of a real world outside of our consciousness, about the nature of time and truth in a psychological sense.
I:15286;1954;This makes it really absolutely interesting.
I:15286;1955;For me, the movie is based on a brilliant idea, exciting, made virtuoso, unfortunately with very low respect to reality, but still a rewarding brain.
I:15286;1956;teaser and contribution to a philosophical and psychological discussion.
I:15286;1957;Next to Die Hard and Brazil this is my favorite movie of all time.
I:15286;1958;It is so original and so filled with great ideas and plot twists, .
I:15286;1959;I waited until the Limited Edition of Memento was released to see it for a second time.
I:15286;1960;Not only can you watch the film with director Christopher Nolan's commentary but you can also watch the film in chronological order.
I:15286;1961;It is amazing that backward or forward.
I:15286;1962;the film works both ways and is one of the best psychological thrillers in years.
I:15286;1963;Memento is that rare film that can be looked at over and over again and you will always find something that you missed the first time around.
I:15286;1964;The director does a wonderful job of putting the viewer in the shoes of the main character .
I:15286;1965;Perhaps the film had so powerful an effect that it caused in me a condition, similar to one of the protagonist (at least in relation to the contents of the movie itself).
I:15286;1966;two stars for an honest attempt at originality.
I:15286;1967;:)A suitable alternative to this (and The Usual Suspects ) .
I:15286;1968;a much more philosophically interesting and satisfying film.
I:15286;1969;It's just a unique way of doing a movie and the story is great.
I:15286;1970;joey Pants, Guy Pearce, and Carrie.
I:15286;1971;this movie is odd and i love odd movies.
I:15286;1972;he takes polaroids to remember people and places (i. e. where he stays, what he drives, his friends, etc.) i was very surprised at how it ended (or began if you want to get technical) it's a really good movie especially if you like twisted weird things.
I:15286;1973;i recommend it to everyone!
I:15286;1974;The concept of this movie is a very interesting one.
I:15286;1975;He lives on a quest to find and kill her attacker.
I:15286;1976;Also, this movie starts at the end and works its way backward in time to the beginning.
I:15286;1977;one side note: of my friends who have seen this movie, more of the men liked it .
I:15286;1978;The answer is so interesting you just have to see if for yourself.
I:15286;1979;In a year filled with scores of simply BAD movies, this one will naturally stand out.
I:15286;1980;Then I saw Memento and my faith in the entertainment business of making movies was restored to an extent.
I:15286;1981;What a refreshing, absolutely stunning great movie.
I:15286;1982;The movie is told backwards with the end at the beginning, but we are given a narrative that is unique in the way it's told to get to that end.
I:15286;1983;Leonard Shelby, who is played exquisitely by Guy Pearce (who is always great in the movies I've seen him in, why hasn't he been up for the Oscar by the way????)
I:15286;1984;What a great theme, and Christopher Nolan the director and screenwriter tells it to us in a way that is unforgettable.
I:15286;1985;anne Moss (also from The Matrix provides the femme fatale character, and the two of them complement Guy Pearce'S great performance very well.
I:15286;1986;Joe Pantoliano's is able to inject humor, empathy, and charm in his character and Carrie.
I:15286;1987;anne Moss provides some good eye candy and and excellent acting as well.
I:15286;1988;Even though the theme is serious it has it's funny moments too, and this helped to relieve some of the tenseness of the strong scenes that I found myself caught up in along with Leonard Shelby.
I:15286;1989;BTW, Guy Pearce is pretty darned good looking in this movie too!
I:15286;1990;anne Moss may have already staked her claim in the biz with the Matrix movies, but you can now expect to see huge things from Guy Pearce and Christopher Nolan as well.
I:15286;1991;This is the best film I've seen for 2001.
I:15286;1992;Powerful and chilling, with an excellent performance by Guy Peirce.
I:15286;1993;The ending is fantastic but you have to look into the film to understand the deep meaning behind it.
I:15286;1994;This is a powerful film about human psychology.
I:15286;1995;Its not only incredibly difficult to write a film with such an ingenous concept with the memory loss and everything, but the dialogue is great as well.
I:15286;1996;That makes for good acting.
I:15286;1997;The direction by nolan was glorious as well.
I:15286;1998;Its not easy making a movie where you see everything backwards pretty much and do it succesfully.
I:15286;1999;Deffanately one of the best films all around this year, with great direction, great story and script, and great acting.
I:15286;2000;Not only that but you actually have to think about what you are watching, and that my friends is something incredibly rare in today's pop culture run society.
I:15286;2001;I highly encourage seeing Memento right away, there isnt a film out that is more worth your time!
I:15286;2002;I found this movie to be very well acted, well done, and pretty much perfect.
I:15286;2003;It was so neat how the film started with the end and ended with the beggining.
I:15286;2004;I reccomend this to anyone who likes watching interesting films that cause you to think.
I:15286;2005;This outstanding suspense thriller gets just about everything right.
I:15286;2006;It's stylish, tricky, clever and intriguing.
I:15286;2007;It's the kind of movie that makes you think, leaves you guessing and causes you to debate it with the people you watched it with.
I:15286;2008;the movie opens with a shot of a hand waving a Polaroid snapshot.
I:15286;2009;leonard's long term memory is perfectly intact.
I:15286;2010;He remember everything from before the injury.
I:15286;2011;He has a methodical personality and uses all sorts of tricks to help him remember things now.
I:15286;2012;It is important to note that Leonard isn't looking for justice.
I:15286;2013;guy Pearce is stunning as Leonard.
I:15286;2014;Yet Pearce does make us care about Leonard.
I:15286;2015;After Memento, be promises to be a very recognizable creative talent.
I:15286;2016;there is something reassuring to me about this movie's success.
I:15286;2017;The fact that all those kids can be so impressed by a literate, intelligent movie that has no special effects and no pop music soundtrack is something that others in Hollywood should pay attention to.
I:15286;2018;moss and Joe Pantoliono star with Guy Pearce in this deranged thriller.
I:15286;2019;All of this is topped off with unique acting, disgusting language used constantly.
I:15286;2020;This technically skilled and wondrous film would work if only it knew when to stop itself, if it could understand the boundaries and tolerances of audiences.
I:15286;2021;The film is highly skilled with an edge to it that the audiences want, but it is overdone with originality that the film doesn't make any sense anymore.
I:15286;2022;If only the plot wasn't like playing catch, going back and forth, when instead it should be keeping us in an orderly fashion of the film's movement, we'd all be able to keep up with it.
I:15286;2023;Christopher Nolan's impressive follow up to his Indie film Following, Memento is a mindbending film with a twist.
I:15286;2024;you see the ending first, then slowly work your way back to the beginning.
I:15286;2025;anne Moss, you are given one impression of them, which you figure is the right one (because you've already seen the movie end).
I:15286;2026;With a fast paced and intelligent script, and great performances by all of the leads, this is definetly the mindbender of the year.
I:15286;2027;This is the movie you watch if you enjoyed Fight Club, and want to reach the hallowed next level of plot twists and character development.
I:15286;2028;I had one of the best cinematic experience of my life by watching Memento .
I:15286;2029;Great script, great story, great directing, acting, editing.
I:15286;2030;Memento is an outstanding effort.
I:15286;2031;making and acting are superb.
I:15286;2032;Part of what made Memento so good was the surprise I had because I didn't have enormous expectations.
I:15286;2033;Maybe if I had a friend over who'd never seen it, but even that's no fun really.
I:15286;2034;This movie exemplifies why I love movies.
I:15286;2035;And rewards upon subsequent viewings.
I:15286;2036;That is why I love this movie!
I:15286;2037;Definitely a movie a viewer must watch at least 2 times to remember crucial important clues and relevant names to the plot.
I:15286;2038;Quetin Tarantino style of direction.
I:15286;2039;Leonard, the main character, was an insurance investigator who found that his memory loss was attributed to mental health instead of physical trauma.
I:15286;2040;Very unique story line and direction.
I:15286;2041;First film I have ever seen that focused on memory as being the most crucial element in uncovering the plot.
I:15286;2042;The viewer will see small clues as the film advances and you will return to those same clues with more information to link the puzzle together.
I:15286;2043;You will see random events that will link all together the further you watch this movie.
I:15286;2044;It will make so much more sense near the end.
I:15286;2045;It is a very compelling film that will keep you watching.
I:15286;2046;This will help you with association with the main character.
I:15286;2047;Movie is executed very well with dialogue, acting, and time references.
I:15286;2048;Very clever editing and the relapses in time are exact with real time.
I:15286;2049;Very intelligent film making and direction with a strong supporting cast.
I:15286;2050;My only complaint is that the film never clears up why and how certain character evolve into the story line.
I:15286;2051;This movie is a great discussion piece for philosophy and interpretation.
I:15286;2052;So suspenseful that it keeps your attention the entire time!
I:15286;2053;If you do like thinkers, watch this right away.
I:15286;2054;This film is the best I have seen all year.
I:15286;2055;The way that the film is unraveled backwards is unique and mindbending.
I:15286;2056;Avoid if you know what's good for you.
I:15286;2057;This was a pretty good movie, the acting was good but the plot was alittle confusing, it jumped around alot and was alittle drawn out.
I:15286;2058;Slowly over the years I have come to appreciate Guy Pearce as an actor more and more.
I:15286;2059;First, (to my knowledge) PRISCILLA: QUEEN OF THE DESERT .
I:15286;2060;He is very strange and absolutely wonderful in this film.
I:15286;2061;It has become one of my all time favorites!
I:15286;2062;This is a crazy, delicious film!
I:15286;2063;I recommend it to anyone with a stomach on the strong side, again he rocks!
I:15286;2064;The others in this flick are great also, Carrie Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano (both of Matrix fame.
I:15286;2065;But our Guy hits the bullseye with this in depth look at a human beings inner thoughts.
I:15286;2066;Everything about this film is intriguing and fresh.
I:15286;2067;So all in all Memento is awesome!
I:15286;2068;Definetly see the others for a taste of great film making and talent.
I:15286;2069;you know, i always thought that people who review the flicks on a website were just people who are small inside, and wish to be big and important.
I:15286;2070;wether it's an awesome flick or a piece of shizzah, you just want to talk about it.
I:15286;2071;and yeah, it makes you feel like you're doing something.
I:15286;2072;THis movie was pretty good, and now i consider myself.
I:15286;2073;The movie is excellent the features are amazing, and gives you great insight into the true thinkings of the director and.
I:15286;2074;The solution, for Leonard, is to become a killer, a good one because he doesn't feel regret (because he soons forget what he did!!!)
I:15286;2075;I think Memento is very well done.
I:15286;2076;The ending is incredibly sad and I feel for the main character every time I see it, even though I know what's going to happen.You also get a whole new spin on the story.
I:15286;2077;Go see the new Bond or something if you don't think you can handle a backwards.
I:15286;2078;Great performances all around, and the whole Sammy Jenkis story is really interesting and works well grounding the viewer between the backwards scenes.
I:15286;2079;Kudos on the film, however.
I:15286;2080;it was strange going backwards all the time in this movie but it was a greay viewing and Pearce did an excellent job at telling his characters problems.
I:15286;2081;in this respect, _Memento_ is a masterpiece.
I:15286;2082;The scripting and execution throughout the movie are flawless, and the acting is superb.
I:15286;2083;Joe Pantoliano should top everyone's list for best supporting actor, and Carrie.
I:15286;2084;anne Moss and Guy Pearce also turn in Oscar.
I:15286;2085;Mememto is a remarkable film.
I:15286;2086;"There are details upon details hidden throughout
I:15286;2087;it's worth your time and effort.
I:15286;2088;"Now, you can get the special edition of ""Memento,"" which is loaded with tons of cool features and extras."
I:15286;2089;Leonard Shelby has a condition.
I:15286;2090;Now, Leonard is armed to the teeth with important tattoos to help him remember important info, and is also armed with a camera to take pictures of those who he encounters.
I:15286;2091;This is a movie that forces you to think.
I:15286;2092;"now the special features
I:15286;2093;You get to hear director commentary, which is very cool.
I:15286;2094;Some of the features are a behind the scenes feature, two trailers, pictures, the short story by Nolan's brother, Leonard's journal, and more.
I:15286;2095;And there are hidden features I have yet to find.
I:15286;2096;But I did find one that I think will interest you very much.
I:15286;2097;It's pretty easy to do.
I:15286;2098;here's the order: third image, fourth image, first image, and then the second image.
I:15286;2099;"enjoy!I was very pleased with this special edition of ""Memento."""
I:15286;2100;This special edition surpasses the original in every way.
I:15286;2101;See it to believe it.
I:15286;2102;it continues like that until the end.
I:15286;2103;if you can stay with the plot, the ending will mesmorize you, it's so great how its connected to the beginning.
I:15286;2104;I suggest you go see this movie right now.
I:15286;2105;Who is manipulating whom?This is an adventurous and totally original bit of filmmaking that strikes out in a completely unfamiliar direction.
I:15286;2106;The cast and acting are absolutely superb, the script is tightly paced, without a single word of wasted dialogue, and the cinematography creates a gritty, noir feeling.
I:15286;2107;The result is a a movie with uncanny sense of realism and individual alienation that pulls the viewer in and holds their attention right up to the end.
I:15286;2108;Ironically enough, the last movie I went nuts over before Memento was also a Guy Pearce film, L. a. Confidential.
I:15286;2109;The disc is produced nicely.
I:15286;2110;the menus show us a portion of the first scene, in forward playback for the first time.
I:15286;2111;There is also a nice 20 minute interview from IFC with Christopher Nolan, as well as the movie's entire website.
I:15286;2112;There's a nice little tattoo gallery as well.
I:15286;2113;gotta go watch it a seventh time.
I:15286;2114;that Leonard has set himself up.
I:15286;2115;The whole world, you discover, is subjective.
I:15286;2116;makes the most of the possibilities.
I:15286;2117;Can you believe Teddy's explanation?

I:15286;2124;one TV interview with the director, widescreen format, Dolby audio, digital video, small picture gallery .
I:15286;2125;This is one of my favorite movies ever.
I:15286;2126;This edition turns the menus into a game, themed after the movie.
I:15286;2127;it is a very confusing movie but it's worth the time everytime you watch it.
I:15286;2128;If you are one of the few individuals who enjoys a film that challenges them, and makes them question their own opinions about themselves and the world around them, you will fall in love with this film.
I:15286;2129;Leanord is obsessed with finding the man who destroyed his life, and it is something that he can never forget, for it is the very last thing he can remember.
I:15286;2130;One of the saddest and most powerful points in the film comes when Natalie asks Leanord what the last thing he can remember is.
I:15286;2131;It is moments like these that make Memento one of the most brilliant films ever created, and I highly recommend it to anybody looking for a challenging and incredibly involving film experience.
I:15286;2132;provoking and extremely creative menu format.
I:15286;2133;It combines an interesting idea that is enhanced by the cinematographic execution of the narrative.
I:15286;2134;It is a murder mystery with a twist.
I:15286;2135;forward in the movie time line) that gives you the perpsective of the hero (Leonard).
I:15286;2136;this is a movie you are going to want watch more than once.
I:15286;2137;I would recommend this movie to anyone with an IQ of over 100
I:15286;2138;It was a relatively low budget film that is part revenge story, part drama, part dark comedy and part love story.
I:15286;2139;And keeps doing that throughout the entire movie.
I:15286;2140;while the writing and directing are great, the key to the movie being as good as it is was the acting.
I:15286;2141;Guy Pearce as the main character, Lenny/Leonard does a great job both when he is narrating the rules for his life, and when he is onscreen.
I:15286;2142;anne Moss both having come off making the original Matrix film when this came out are great playing characters that are much more than they seem.
I:15286;2143;It's much more complex than that.
I:15286;2144;But another part moves swiftly forward, starting from the traditional beginning.
I:15286;2145;It all culminates somewhere in the middle, the various narratives intersecting with a truly satisfying twist.
I:15286;2146;those who describe Memento s narrative structure as simply an attention.
I:15286;2147;Sure, it's a unique take on a standard film.
I:15286;2148;Our emotional investment in him helps create the exhilarating moment when the curtain is pulled back and we really see who's pulling the levers.
I:15286;2149;I was grinning wildly at this point, impressed that the filmmakers managed to catch me off guard.
I:15286;2150;Guy Pearce is laid back, stylish, and cool, even when caught in the midst of a hazardous situation.
I:15286;2151;He's also a fine example of the post.
I:15286;2152;This convention, which works well when utilized in literature, is a tough feat to pull off in film, for the audience sees what the character sees instead of being told about it.
I:15286;2153;The film's unique structure subverts this point, and Pearce is left carrying the load of exposition.
I:15286;2154;Pantoliano imbues Teddy with hidden wisdom and cunning, wrapped up in a package that would intimidate no one.
I:15286;2155;She appears to be in Leonard's corner, but Moss allows just enough doubt to keep her character intriguing.
I:15286;2156;I found Christopher Nolan's work to be relaxed and assured.
I:15286;2157;And all this while keeping the suspense tight, the story moving, the visuals appealing and perfectly symbolic.
I:15286;2158;It demands (and rewards) your attention.
I:15286;2159;I enjoyed every minute of it, and can't wait to see it again, armed with the knowledge of what really happens.
I:15286;2160;It's a terrific little movie.
I:15286;2161;those who describe Memento as anything but a superb piece of filmmaking, are doing the film a oh wait, have I told you this before?
I:15286;2162;note: Extremely cool formating of extras.
I:15286;2163;This movie is completely mind blowing.
I:15286;2164;The way it goes is very original espicially how it goes back wards.
I:15286;2165;It is a very good movie.
I:15286;2166;This movie is brilliant and you don't have to be a rocket scientist to understand.
I:15286;2167;A Masterpiece of orginality and a rare diamond in a sea of Hollywood medicority.
I:15286;2168;"this film is brillant on every level, its' genius has been discussed enough by previous reviewers but the only warning you have to give is that the ""viewer"" must enjoy a thought."
I:15286;2169;it is not to state that I am some great intellectual but I do enjoy the act of asking myself questions and trying to come up with the answers.
I:15286;2170;The best way to wind up a film for me is to have a coffee and talk about it with whoever I saw it with.
I:15286;2171;I usually gauge the success of the film by how long the conversation goes on after.
I:15286;2172;An hour is usually the mark of a really good film, that happened with Fargo, Schindler's List.
I:15286;2173;candy and take it all in at the surface level.
I:15286;2174;He is obsessed with finding his wife's killer.
I:15286;2175;We are introduced to the two main people in his life .
I:15286;2176;Both Teddy and Natalie have personal reasons behind wanting to help Leonard.
I:15286;2177;i am a sucker for a good mystery, and Memento is the most original and well executed mystery film that I have ever seen.
I:15286;2178;The story is suspenseful and extremely complex.
I:15286;2179;I love how Christopher Nolan had the film unfold in reverse.
I:15286;2180;This actually involves you in the film personally, and makes you sympathize for Leonard overall.
I:15286;2181;I loved this aspect of the film, because Sammy suffers from the same condition as Leonard's.
I:15286;2182;Memento is also guaranteed to keep you guessing.
I:15286;2183;The film continually dangles clues in front of you.
I:15286;2184;But since the story is told in reverse, what you are seeing, may not be what it seems!
I:15286;2185;Guy Pierce's portrayal of Leonard is one of the best that I have ever seen.
I:15286;2186;It is so realistic, and so convincing, that you come to believe that Guy Pearce actually went through the same thing himself.
I:15286;2187;Joe Pantoliano and Carrie Ann Moss are also great.
I:15286;2188;Their performances add to the film's suspense, because you never know what to believe.
I:15286;2189;christopher Nolan's Memento is amazing.
I:15286;2190;The film has great acting, a nice script, an intense, complex story, and an outstanding ending.
I:15286;2191;That brings the meaning of the word interactive to a whole new level!
I:15286;2192;It is much more complex and infinitely more brilliant than I had thought, and believe me, I already thought it was brilliant.
I:15286;2193;"You'll have to search online for the ""keys"" to unlock the secret that lets you watch the movie in its linear form, but it's not hard to find on the Web, not hard to do, and well worth it."
I:15286;2194;Friends recommended this movie to me.
I:15286;2195;Memento is a classic who.
I:15286;2196;It is as if the director (.)
I:15286;2197;and well its the best movie iv ever seen ive seen a lot of movies like this but none that will go as far as being clos to the horror movies i like but this is one movie that u will no stop thinking and is an unbelivably good movie.
I:15286;2198;Wow this was a really cool movie, very unique.
I:15286;2199;It is one of those movies that has you thinking the whole time you are watching it and then continually thinking about it after the fact.
I:15286;2200;This is my all time favorite movie.
I:15286;2201;it's is simply brilliant, well.
I:15286;2202;acted, and makes you actually think.
I:15286;2203;It's a little confusing the first time you see it, but you are left with that feeling of catharsis and it is entirely worth it!
I:15286;2204;Yeah, it is free and yeah the title seems mysterious but .
I:15286;2205;Though it was one of the most popular movies of the year.
I:15286;2206;Memento is an excellently crafted work of art.
I:15286;2207;I enjoyed the film immensley.
I:15286;2208;I reccommend it highly to fans of anything from director M. night Shyamalan (The Sixth Sense) and any future work from writer/director Christopher Nolan.
I:15286;2209;It is the works of a true genios.
I:15286;2210;I recomend it to anyone with good taste in movies.
I:15286;2211;Reminicent of Hitchcock, it is unique.
I:15286;2212;The actors are fabulous, especially Guy Pearce, who shows that Academy Award acting often goes unnoticed, probably because of lack of publicity for the film.
I:15286;2213;Much to the director's delight, I presume.
I:15286;2214;This a classic film noir on a par with the best of Hitchcock.
I:15286;2215;The plot was so ingenious and imaginative.
I:15286;2216;That leaves a compelling plot, and Christopher Nolan's screenplay milks it for all it's worth in this terrific movie.
I:15286;2217;add the incredible acting skills of Guy Pearce, great supporting performances by Joe Pantoliano and Carrie.
I:15286;2218;anne Moss and you have what is in my opinion the best movie of 2001.
I:15286;2219;I can tell when a mystery is great because I was so blown away by the truth that was revealed at the end (or in this case, the beginning)!!!
I:15286;2220;More importantly, it's an adults' movie, which of course means that it can never be a box office success.
I:15286;2221;twice movie if ever there was one.
I:15286;2222;The acting from every quarter is wonderful, hopefully setting up Guy Pearce as a major star .
I:15286;2223;Come on Hollywood, the rest of the stars of 'L. a Confidential' are doing well!
I:15286;2224;ann Moss proves that there's more to her than rubber suits and special effects and Pantoliano gives a magnificent turn as Teddy.
I:15286;2225;Well, it's intelligent for one.
I:15286;2226;There's a neat little subplot that tugs at the heart strings.
I:15286;2227;outs to help make the lead look good.
I:15286;2228;This movie came with my PS3 that I just got.
I:15286;2229;Let me tell you, you'll love it.
I:15286;2230;this is a movie that you have to connect the dots yourself.
I:15286;2231;the movie starts with the ending of the story.
I:15286;2232;"Everybody can now take a deep breath
I:15286;2233;Christopher Nolan's suspense thriller Memento does precisely this, and it's a wonderful experience.
I:15286;2234;The protagonist is Leonard Shelby (played with quiet intensity by Guy Pearce), a former insurance salesman who tries to hunt down the man who murdered his wife and inflicted brain damage on him.
I:15286;2235;The movie is sequenced starting with the final events and works its way backward in the colour scenes.
I:15286;2236;"The multifaceted and often manipulative supporting characters keep the viewer on his/her toes
I:15286;2237;What makes this film so relevant is that it refuses to settle for a simple, generic whodunit, using its innovative structure to build a tapestry of clues and characters, and also to put the audience in Leonard's shoes.
I:15286;2238;It is a film that tempts .
I:15286;2239;This is a classic example of intelligent movie.
I:15286;2240;Starting with the end, this brilliant thriller weaves an intriguing spiders web and culminates in the best ending since 'The Usual Suspects'.
I:15286;2241;leonard uses tattoos and polaroid photographs to remind himself of the important points, but can he trust the past?Remeniscent of Pulp Fiction in the way the timeline is de.
I:15286;2242;linear, this sparkling classic will be remembered as the film which made both Guy Pearce, and the writer/director Christopher Nolan.
I:15286;2243;(one to watch) Highly recommended for all fans of tight plotted braintwisters.
I:15286;2244;An Amazing drama/thriller/mystery/action/suspenseful movie with a bit of humor!
I:15286;2245;The 2 disc special edition is very good and has a good transfer.
I:15286;2246;there are a lot of great gimmick stories.
I:15286;2247;this is a movie that demands your full attention, but it all makes sense in the end.
I:15286;2248;If you enjoy clever suspense stories, this is highly recommended.
I:15286;2249;His life is permanently lived in present.
I:15286;2250;what makes this movie really intriguing and keeps you on the edge of your seat is the fact that the story is told from the end backwards, each segment of the movie revealing a little bit more of what has previously happened.
I:15286;2251;This is what keeps you interested, this what keeps you guessing.
I:15286;2252;Despite the fact that it is undoubtedly excellently crafted and has top notch performances from Guy Pearce, Joe Pantoliano and Carrie Anne Moss, it's the intrigue that holds the movie together and hold it together it does very well, for this is an excellent, very intelligent movie.
I:15286;2253;burn, complex, intelligent thrillers, this comes highly recommended and will hopefully bring Guy Pearce an Oscar nomination.
I:15286;2254;My opinion is the less you know about this film the more enjoyable it is in solving the riddles.
I:15286;2255;basically Lenny, with the help of Teddy , are building a mystery using the truth as model for their deceptions.
I:15286;2256;the black and white scenes give the movie a truly nice touch that threw cleverly threw me off the scent.
I:15286;2257;A must for all fans of this classic movie.
I:15286;2258;For those who haven't seen Memento please watch this movie.
I:15286;2259;I always recommend this movie as a must see.
I:15286;2260;It is pure movie enjoyment.
I:15286;2261;So few movies today actually engage your mind and emotions.
I:15286;2262;Most merely stimulate your senses.
I:15286;2263;This movie requires you to pay attention and it draws you into its interesting story using a bizzarre backwards narrative structure that puts you in the same state as the memory.
I:15286;2264;Still, any movie that can actually be logical and consistent and still require the full attention of the viewer to comprehend is worthy of note.
I:15286;2265;The most remarkable scene is the one where Carrie.
I:15286;2266;anne Moss reveals her true nature and intentions to the hero, knowing he will forget in a few minutes.
I:15286;2267;It is a fine piece of acting in a remarkable piece of filmmaking.
I:15286;2268;This movie was extremely good.
I:15286;2269;It starts from the end and goes to the beginning.
I:15286;2270;It'll keep you gripped to you seat saying, Oh my God.
I:15286;2271;This is easily one of the most unique and interesting movies that I've seen in a long time.
I:15286;2272;The writing, direction, and acting performances by everyone in this film are all top notch stuff.
I:15286;2273;the basic premise of the film is a narrative as told from the perspective of the main character, Leonard (played by Guy Pearce) who is an insurance claims investigator.
I:15286;2274;there is a juicy twist, however.
I:15286;2275;The other main characters are the crooked cop well played by Joe Pantolano, Carrie.
I:15286;2276;This mirrors Leonard's own world and draws you into the character.
I:15286;2277;But to anyone who enjoys a good Noir.
I:15286;2278;Memento is a thrilling movie about Shelby Leonard, a widower who cannot form new memories.
I:15286;2279;This is one of those movies you have to watch again when you finish it, understanding the little details which eluded you before.
I:15286;2280;anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano give great performances
I:15286;2281;This movie is certainly a very unusual type of film that plays both backwards and forwards revealing the plot in a very interesting narrative.
I:15286;2282;Overall, it isn't a perfect film, but a great film and while it doesn't benefit largely from the Blu Ray format, it is a solid movie for anyone looking for something that will challenge your mind.
I:15286;2283;This was the most incredibly well made movies i've seen in a long time.
I:15286;2284;This movie has more twists than any other i've ever seen.
I:15286;2285;The backwards story is great.
I:15286;2286;This is a fantastic movie that will keep you guessing to the very end and anybody who didn't like this movie is just too stupid to understand it.
I:15286;2287;Guy Pearce (L. a. Confidential) is outstanding in this hypnotic film noir that is simply one the best films of 2001.
I:15286;2288;One of her best lines in the film is, You sad, sad freak.
I:15286;2289;Joe Pantoliano (Bound) is equally compelling in his supporting role.
I:15286;2290;Before Christopher Nolan would be tapped to direct a remake of 2002's Insomnia, he directed this modest budgeted thriller that sets bold new standards in mystery and suspense cinema.
I:15286;2291;That alone is pretty much the plot, but what sets Memento apart from other revenge themed thrillers is the fact that the film moves backwards event wise.
I:15286;2292;anne Moss (another Matrix alumnus) plays a sympathetic soul to Lenny's crisis while hiding ulterior motives, and she gives a knockout performance as well.
I:15286;2293;Memento requires more than one viewing to fully understand the complex storyline, but once you do you'll be left with your jaw on the floor.
I:15286;2294;This is definitely the type of movie you'd want to own.
I:15286;2295;We constantly recommend this movie.
I:15286;2296;"Christopher Nolan's ""Memento"" is a revenge story told backwards from the end to the beginning."
I:15286;2297;when we first meet Leonard, he is well aware of his condition and knows pretty well how to deal with it.
I:15286;2298;He is constantly on the look out for those that might want to take advantage of him and is not trusting of anyone.
I:15286;2299;The rest of the movie goes backwards, explaining how Leonard came to the conclusion that the man he shoots at the start, was the second bandit involved in his wife's murder.
I:15286;2300;this movie is exceptionally well shot on film and very captivating.
I:15286;2301;This is a completly original concept, at least as far as I have ever seen and engages the viewer's full attention.
I:15286;2302;"Joe Pantalioni is perfect for the role of 'Teddy' a ""friend"" of Leonard's and is very convincing as the overly."
I:15286;2303;this film is well worth purchasing, as it will take a viewing or two to fully understand, appreciate and get used to the way this story is told.
I:15286;2304;This is a phenomenal film.
I:15286;2305;A wonderful film that I almost turned off halfway.
I:15286;2306;It was satisfyingly surprising and made me re.
I:15286;2307;If you start getting antsy, just hang tight, things will reveal themselves by the movie's end.
I:15286;2308;I only gave it two stars cause guy is in it and he always does a fantastic job.
I:15286;2309;i really enjoy this movie, which I feel is just as fresh and exciting now as it was when it was first released.
I:15286;2310;But the thing that REALLY impresses me about this movie is that if you watch the scenes in order, the movie still works as a thriller, and a mystery.
I:15286;2311;I enjoy the frustrations ofn the main charater and coming full circle at the end.
I:15286;2312;This is a very good movie with a lot of twists.
I:15286;2313;I think after years go by, this movie will be said as one of the best in the genre.
I:15286;2314;this is a very good movie with a lot of twists.
I:15286;2315;I think after years go by, this movie will be said as one of the best in the genre.
I:15286;2316;The genius of this film lies in it's directing.
I:15286;2317;That way you piece things together just as he does.
I:15286;2318;'Memento' is a very well made film.
I:15286;2319;The main character Leonard makes genuinely surprising discoveries throughout his search for the man who murdered his wife.
I:15286;2320;One thread plays forward, another, which involves most of the action in the story, works backward, scene by scene.
I:15286;2321;It works well, and is more than a gimmick.
I:15286;2322;The climax is neither predictable nor over the top, and is one of the best I have seen in a while.
I:15286;2323;the acting is astounding, particularly by Carrie Ann Moss.
I:15286;2324;As her character gradually unfolds, the viewer sees the greatly varied facets of her personality.
I:15286;2325;Joe Palantino is an excellent actor, and he is perfectly cast as an untrustworthy but seemingly helpful cop.
I:15286;2326;due to its intricate plot, carefully attended details, and complex character motives, 'Memento' holds up on repeated viewings.
I:15286;2327;Dark, suspense, at times humourous, a fantastic movie.
I:15286;2328;This is a fast paced, edge.
I:15286;2329;Joe Pantoliano (Teddy) gives an outstanding performance and deserves a nod for best supporting.
I:15286;2330;well you'll still like the movie but you won't be thrilled with the ending.
I:15286;2331;You *WILL* talk about this movie after you watch it.
I:15286;2332;destined to be a classic and definitely on my list of movies to own.
I:15286;2333;that being said, the movie is also cinematically brilliant .
I:15286;2334;provoking, with a perfect balance of ironic humor and tragedy, and scientifically accurate to boot, this movie earns a solid 5 stars.
I:15286;2335;This is one of the best movies of its year.
I:15286;2336;This movie was really good.
I:15286;2337;In summation, probably the best cast for the movie.
I:15286;2338;Memento is surely one of the most innovative pictures in recent years.
I:15286;2339;Christopher Nolan's screenplay (based on a short story by his brother Jonathan) is terrific and introduces us to a complete new way of storytelling.
I:15286;2340;nolan very wisely chose relatively unknown actors to play in his complex thriller, so that the audience can focus on the bewildering story.
I:15286;2341;Pearce, well known for his performance as an honest cop in Curtis Hanson's masterpiece L. a. Confidential, does a great job along with The Matrix stars Joe Pantoliano and Carrie.
I:15286;2342;if there is one movie to watch this year, it's definitely Memento.
I:15286;2343;I watched the entire movie with my mouth open, glued to the screen.
I:15286;2344;And I still watch it with the same feeling of suspense and interest.
I:15286;2345;This movie is truly a genius production, a masterpiece.
I:15286;2346;(Except we, as the viewer, are able to see the 'future' and know what will happen to him next!)
I:15286;2347;I thought the actors were great, the director did a great job and, to quit raving about this movie, I have to say that it's simply SUPERB.
I:15286;2348;Watch it and you won't be dissapointed.
I:15286;2349;This was such a good psychological thriller!
I:15286;2350;It made me pity those with memory loss (I never knew how much it could hinder someone's life) but it also kept the mood heightened and intense with all the violence and deceit.
I:15286;2351;Nolan's first explosive film, and in this set you get it.
I:15286;2352;The film is set to be a mystery, seeing it in order removes the intrigue, which I personally keeps the film hinged, but it still makes for a fun re.
I:15286;2353;And of course the behind the scenes are great, but the best extra on here is short story developed by Jonathan Nolan, where honestly the narrator feels completely lost and manages to bring the readers into his own internal aimlessness.
I:15286;2354;I felt that Guy Pierce did a really good job of playing a complex role, and Carrie Ann Moss and Joe Pantiliano were pretty good too.
I:15286;2355;christopher Nolan does a great job of intelligently directing what must have been quite a challeging movie to make.
I:15286;2356;The editing, central to this movie, was quite smartly done.
I:15286;2357;It is a good ending to a film in a Hitchcock sort of way but does not come close to the twist scene in the Usual Suspects but it is still leaps and bounds ahead of say .
I:15286;2358;The film is mostly shot in reverse and that is a very cool concept that is committed to the screen in a very daring and remarkable way.
I:15286;2359;Great entertainment value but not the best plot twist we have ever seen by a long shot.
I:15286;2360;The format of the movie is very intriguing, the plot plays backwards, and you don't find the motivation for any of the characters' actions until after each scene plays out.
I:15286;2361;"this is one of those movies that leave you questioning what really happened
I:15286;2362;If you want to watch a movie that has the most jaw.
I:15286;2363;This is a movie that demands attention and you will want to watch it several times.
I:15286;2364;My best advice for the first time viewer is to sit back and enjoy the ride.
I:15286;2365;I bought the movie believing it was a really good movie based on what I had heard but was really disapointed once I watched the movie.
I:15286;2366;Christopher Nolan and his brother ( the writer ) did an great job and i think great things are to come of them.
I:15286;2367;a tour de force of creative imagery and it keeps you interested throughout the whole movie no matter if it goes im complete reverse.
I:15286;2368;i highly reccomend it to anyone with a working brain.
I:15286;2369;I love this movie and I'm very happy about this limited edition.
I:15286;2370;aside from that, the film looks great.
I:15286;2371;So I appeal to everyone who reads this.
I:15286;2372;in this first part I will mention that this film is highly unusual.
I:15286;2373;You the viewer, are the final judge as to what actually took place within the story.
I:15286;2374;This movie is that obscure, intricate, illusive, and downright subjective.
I:15286;2375;i would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys being intellectually challenged.
I:15286;2376;Those of you who are intuitive and sensitive to subtleties, those of you who notice things that others overlook, and those of you who are clever and inventive will love this movie.
I:15286;2377;Detectives, medical professionals, psychologists, sociologists, scientists, mathematicians, and creative professionals, such as writers, will find this film very rewarding.
I:15286;2378;There is also a website set up specifically for admirers of this fantastic movie.
I:15286;2379;If after watching, you can figure out the website address, you are very clever.
I:15286;2380;the way I see it, Leonard is a person who loves to kill.
I:15286;2381;Leonard is extremely clever and intelligent, and he is disciplined and systematic to a precision.
I:15286;2382;leonard was committed to a mental institution prior to meeting his supposed wife.
I:15286;2383;"There is special meaning to the one tattoo that Leonard can see at all times, ""Remember Sammy Jenkis,"" and it is not because Leonard is Sammy."
I:15286;2384;And the real kicker is that Leonard would have everyone believe that his memory condition is a physical handicap, when in fact it is a mental projection produced by his severe psychosis.
I:15286;2385;and the beauty of this film is that it does not matter if my opinions are near fact or far fetched, what matters is that this film allows me to create what reality I would have with it.
I:15286;2386;what does that have to do with anything?This is a well made, well acted, suspensful movie with an interesting story.
I:15286;2387;It's a great movie that holds your attention for almost 2 hours.
I:15286;2388;Sure, some people won't be able to follow what's going on, and that's too bad for them, but this is a great movie.
I:15286;2389;"All we wanted was to watch a movie and be entertained
I:15286;2390;This is one of the best, and by far, the most original movie I have ever sceene.
I:15286;2391;Its hard to follow at first becasue the sceenes go in revese order, but that is one of the aspects that makes this movie interesting.
I:15286;2392;Great acting jobs all around and once you think you know people in the movie, you are proven wrong!
I:15286;2393;Each sceene keeps you guessing as much as the main character on how he got there and what happened right before hand.
I:15286;2394;See it and be blown away.
I:15286;2395;That's the beauty of this film.
I:15286;2396;It has great replay value!
I:15286;2397;"this film is directed by the british director Christopher Nolan, who also directed the brilliant come back of batman in the batman franchise title ""Batman Begins""."
I:15286;2398;Memento is Nolan's second film and is the first film in cinema history to be told backwards.
I:15286;2399;The film bassicly starts from the end and works it's way to the beggining which is the end of the film.
I:15286;2400;this film should've taken home the oscars for best screenplay and editing for very good reasons, Christopher Nolan had to start with the end and work his way backwards, same goes for the editing.
I:15286;2401;The performances are very good and exciting to watch, but the stand out is definately Guy Pearce's tough role as the the man with a condition he's still holding onto.
I:15286;2402;Memento scores big because of intellegence, maturity, and most of all being unique.
I:15286;2403;Guy Pearce puts on a very convincing performance of a nervous and confused Leonard.
I:15286;2404;Joe Pantoliano also does a great job as Leonards friend, yet you never know for sure who he is until the end of the movie.
I:15286;2405;ann Moss plays another one of Leonard's friends who puts on a great performance as a hard.
I:15286;2406;memento is flawless, a masterpeice.
I:15286;2407;Every element that makes up a good movie is present here, it is a deep and intellegent movie that will keep you on the edge of you seat, thinking and always dying to find out what will happen next.
I:15286;2408;Without a doubt a 5 star movie, original, unique, exciting, and very intellegent, see this movie.
I:15286;2409;The first disc is fine, the menu I can understand.
I:15286;2410;I was also able to see the foreign posters and a special that was on IFC.
I:15286;2411;the movie is great, just not the Special Edition disc set.
I:15286;2412;This is perhaps the most intelligent and enthralling film I have seen for a long time.
I:15286;2413;Not only does it have one of the most talented casts you will see but it has the story to go with it.
I:15286;2414;For some people who enjoy their no brainer blockbusters it might be hard to comprehend but please persevere!
I:15286;2415;You will be rewarded with the most twisty.
I:15286;2416;turny film you will probably ever see.
I:15286;2417;The real appeal of the film for me however lies in the cast.
I:15286;2418;You have three of the best actors you can see at present.
I:15286;2419;Guy Pearce is outstanding as is Carrie.
I:15286;2420;The film thoroughly deserves it five stars and should be in some of those top five film lists that will soon be appearing!
I:15286;2421;I liked the creative way that this story is told in bits and pieces.
I:15286;2422;It keeps you thinking throughout, and the short.
I:15286;2423;Each additional time you watch it you will see new things.
I:15286;2424;This movie has been moved up to my #1 favorite movie ever.
I:15286;2425;It is incredibly thought provoking, well written and directed.
I:15286;2426;Guy Pearce does an excellent job and proves just how talented he really is with this performance.
I:15286;2427;I highly recommend this movie to everyone.
I:15286;2428;This is also a good thing, though, because you can watch the movie several times without it ever getting old.
I:15286;2429;"The movie is done well, and adds a twist to both the ""backward."
I:15286;2430;"drawkcab"" and amnesia themes, and it's an interesting murder mystery with a great twist at the end."
I:15286;2431;My husband and I enjoyed this movie tremendously.
I:15286;2432;This movie is very well made, but it may be a bit tough for some people to digest.
I:15286;2433;This movie starts you off at the end of the story and takes you back to the begining.
I:15286;2434;This technique is very effective in that it keeps the viewer on the edge from the start of the movie to the surprising ending.
I:15286;2435;This collectors box is great condition!
I:15286;2436;Definitely the coolest collectors edition box I own or seen.
I:15286;2437;A lot of neat stuff on the inside as well to make it all the more a great box
I:15286;2438;"Better people have made the map of this territory
I:15286;2439;Memento looks pretty, projecting depth with tons of style.
I:15286;2440;But it is essentially as slick and vaccuous as movies get.
I:15286;2441;It is Deep Movie Lite.
I:15286;2442;I thought this was an excellent film.
I:15286;2443;The script was absolutely original and really kept you guessing until the very end.
I:15286;2444;The whole backwards technique works, actually, and to great length.
I:15286;2445;The soundtrack/score is also amazing in a subdued, quiet way.
I:15286;2446;It's just a good time looking at the menus.
I:15286;2447;The film, as you know by now, tells the story of the protagonist by presenting his events backwards in time.
I:15286;2448;Simultaneously, the film tells a forward moving parallel story of a similarly affected person.
I:15286;2449;The hero of the piece is a puppet without his awareness and you wish that he never knows the extent of his manipulation by the good folk that populate his world.
I:15286;2450;Never ever boring and occasionally gripping, this movie is a movie lover's movie.
I:15286;2451;It is an essential to any discriminating viewer's personal catalog.
I:15286;2452;Group viewing is best for the conversation that the movie compels.
I:15286;2453;I'd just like to point out that this is a great movie, however the ENTIRE story isn't backwards.
I:15286;2454;The actual end of the film is the middle of the story, kind of confusing, but a very original and cool concept.
I:15286;2455;One of the most innovative, original stories using a very innovative method of telling the story .
I:15286;2456;I don't really like spoiling the story in movie reviews but if you like movies that make you think all the way through and enjoy great endings you have to at least watch this once.
I:15286;2457;In a day and age where plot twists are common place, Memento takes it a step further working itself forward and back at the same time.
I:15286;2458;An entirely origional plot, terrific dialoge, and superior acting make this movie an easy contender for almost anyones top ten list.
I:15286;2459;I guarantee you will watch it over and over again.
I:15286;2460;If you're like me, you will not only be happy to pick up something new each time, but also you will try to see any screw ups within the movie.
I:15286;2461;And that is a testament to the director and editors who have done a superb job of not mixing anything up in such a complicated story line.
I:15286;2462;Definitely one of those that you want to see .
I:15286;2463;item summer movie, but as one that you have to see in order to say you have experienced all types of movies.
I:15286;2464;"My observation of the books selections is that a few of those movie I didn't really have to see but ""Memento"" is one that lived up to the billing."
I:15286;2465;The retelling of the various scenes created impressions as well as doubts and that really came together at the end.
I:15286;2466;Memento is one of the most innovative and intriguing films of the past 10 years.
I:15286;2467;The singular thing about it is the way the film successfully puts the viewer in exactly the same position as the protagonist .
I:15286;2468;in reverse order, causing the viewer to have to remember what came next , and .
I:15286;2469;Rarely does a theatrical experience challenge the audience to this extreme.
I:15286;2470;all look and feel is certainly 'Film Noir'.
I:15286;2471;The whole experience is so unique that the mood is maintained throughout.
I:15286;2472;Amazingly enough, Memento manages to accomplish all this without ever seeming self.
I:15286;2473;The cast is uniformly excellent, and the script is sharp and precise.
I:15286;2474;Memento is without a doubt an ingenious and clever thriller, and for that it should be fully commended.
I:15286;2475;It is merely a tool used to add to the suspense and drama of the thriller, and it is here that the heart of the movie truly lies.
I:15286;2476;Memento is an engrossing and deceptive thriller.
I:15286;2477;Leave it at that, and this is definitely one to remember.
I:15286;2478;And to those who bitched and moaned because the movie was backwards and as a result confusing, I can only say one thing: develop a sense of fun and adventure for a change!
I:15286;2479;Leonard can recall everything up to the accident.
I:15286;2480;i love this movie because it asks a valid question:Upon what do you rely to create your reality?Memories are faulty.
I:15286;2481;tedy is a suspicious character, but he gives Leonard some information that is verifiably true.
I:15286;2482;condition is the human condition.
I:15286;2483;Great story and great attention to detail.
I:15286;2484;and thus concludes my chessy synopsis of a pretty good movie!
I:15286;2485;Exactly WHAT is going on in those black and white scenes is yet another mystery and wonderful entanglement of Memento.
I:15286;2486;There's plenty of twists and turns as more and more is shown to you.
I:15286;2487;When the movie wraps up and all the frayed ends are connected for you, the amazing twist at the end leaves you wanting to re.
I:15286;2488;watch the whole thing right then.
I:15286;2489;The wonderful writers, actors, and directors of this film have made that world possible.
I:15286;2490;We all know the name of Christopher Nolan thanks to his superb Dark Knight Trilogy and Inception.
I:15286;2491;What you may not know is he has other great films one being Memento.
I:15286;2492;The editing, the shots, the acting the Noir style all add up to one great film with a great ending.
I:15286;2493;Although some people may find it hard to keep up with the film as the sceenes of the film are played in reverse, but once you have pieced this together the film fits together into an exiting and unforgettable thriller.
I:15286;2494;But this works for this film.
I:15286;2495;It is a quirky, yet very original way a filming and creating a picture.
I:15286;2496;Hands down, one of the best movies I have ever seen.
I:15286;2497;It was definitely a movie I thoroughly enjoyed.
I:15286;2498;insurance salesman, but he's very good nevertheless.
I:15286;2499;Carrie Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano are even better in key supporting roles.
I:15286;2500;Telling the story backwards from the perspective of the protagonist (who sustained a brain injury that makes it impossible for him to sustain new memories more than a day) is a clever device that keeps the viewer intrigued and involved.
I:15286;2501;It was reassuring to see this movie sweep the Independent Spirit Awards, and it wasn't much of a surprise that the Oscars largely snubbed it.
I:15286;2502;Compare this to something like Moulin Rouge, which some think is so very creative.
I:15286;2503;Memento satisfies on both the style and substance levels, a real rarity in the commercial film biz today.
I:15286;2504;Not to mention Joe Pantoliano (numerous co. star roles).
I:15286;2505;But, these 3 actors are all making a great name for themselves in Hollywood.
I:15286;2506;All 3 delivery the goods in this backwards thriller.
I:15286;2507;This widescreen 113 minute adventure starts at the end.
I:15286;2508;and it leaves you guessing as to why it all happened.
I:15286;2509;This film is just one of those amazing creations that you hear by word of mouth.
I:15286;2510;You will want to see this movie 2 or 3 times and then you will realize the brilliance behind it.
I:15286;2511;A modern classic (5 stars).
I:15286;2512;Aside from the hook (the story backwards), this is fine, fine, fine film noir.
I:15286;2513;Regarding the movie, it is certainly worthwhile to watch.
I:15286;2514;Be sure to set some extra time aside after the movie as you'll likely want to watch certain things again.
I:15286;2515;There's a good reason for it to be crossed out.
I:15286;2516;the special feature that some reviews have mentioned would be nice is what this is for.
I:15286;2517;It certainly makes it easier to rewatch.
I:15286;2518;If you've seen the movie, you'll know what this is.
I:15286;2519;The film has a precise structure.
I:15286;2520;Leonard is a fighter, however.
I:15286;2521;He tattoos information on his body.
I:15286;2522;He has a flow chart on the wall of his hotel room with pictures and notes.
I:15286;2523;the narrative structure for this story is Leonard's ability to frame his experiences.
I:15286;2524;We see scenes, and are introduced to characters, but we can't make any connections among them.
I:15286;2525;"Later in the movie, each scene makes sense
I:15286;2526;I thought of Roshomon, watching it, but it is much more intricate than Roshomon.
I:15286;2527;boggling is Guy Pearce as Leonard.
I:15286;2528;He proves himself a consummate actor in this film, at least to me.
I:15286;2529;His range is astounding: the last film I saw him in was Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.
I:15286;2530;also, if you see this film, you get to hear one of the funniest lines of the year: What's going on here?
I:15286;2531;The film is a masterpiece at psychological manipulation.
I:15286;2532;The acting is great as was the cinematography.
I:15286;2533;it made the Nolan's rich.
I:15286;2534;I was mad at first, some movies you really want to understand and this one lets a lot of the ending come from each person that watches it.
I:15286;2535;chronological order, the way it spills its plot and the story's characters scene by scene is an achievement in movie making which is an amazing thrill to enjoy watching this film!
I:15286;2536;Memento is well executed because despite what appears to be disjointed and confusing scenes quickly ties into congruent segments to form a comprehensible whole.
I:15286;2537;it is a brilliant film.
I:15286;2538;It is rare to see a film which can truly be called unique.
I:15286;2539;The entire movie is backwards.
I:15286;2540;Just when you think it's a great movie it gets better.
I:15286;2541;Memento is one of the best films ever made in Cinema and I give credit to the Director and the actors, mainly Guy Pearce.
I:15286;2542;the story is pretty simple.
I:15286;2543;overall this is an Excellent film.
I:15286;2544;the film is pretty original if you ask me and Director Christopher Nolan did an excellent job editing, pacing this whole film.
I:15286;2545;i really like how the movie plays backwards which give the audience little confusion but that's it and the black and white scenes are very juicy and detailed until the very last scene where we find out what the real truth is.
I:15286;2546;I really liked the characters in this film especially Teddy.
I:15286;2547;The characters were great and it's good to see Carrie.
I:15286;2548;This film has excellent writing editing, Great Actors, Excellent yet very simple story told backwards and some really great yet accward moments and there for I give this film a5 out of 5 stars.
I:15286;2549;It keeps you on your toes as you piece the story together.
I:15286;2550;"what's philosophically important in all this is the ""meaning"" of the first (and in a way, last) scene."
I:15286;2551;he beat up, put in a closet, and then just let go.
I:15286;2552;I think that Memento is to be seen by generations to come as one of the most intriguing and best thrillers done in history.
I:15286;2553;"A good idea, isn""t it?"
I:15286;2554;Stand up and read your body in the mirror and you will gonna have all the answers.
I:15286;2555;So many questions, so many answers.
I:15286;2556;Somehow akin to Blade Runner in asking many intriguing questions to viewers.
I:15286;2557;this is one of the best films I ever saw.
I:15286;2558;Ok, maybe I have also forgot some other good films to compare with Mememto, but the film is pretty much good.
I:15286;2559;it may not be a great film, but it's certainly an intruiging one.
I:15286;2560;That much I can garantee you.
I:15286;2561;His long term memory is intact right up to the incident which caused his condition.
I:15286;2562;This is easily the best movie I saw this year and I highly recommend it.
I:15286;2563;"bending thriller ""Memento"" is one of those rare instances in which the form of a movie is designed to match its content."
I:15286;2564;"Still, ""Memento"" deserves enormous credit not only for trusting its audience to be able to cope with this complex style but for managing to keep most of the plot details well."
I:15286;2565;One of the ways that Nolan avoids that trap is by devising a plot that is as gripping as any to be found in a traditionally structured example of film noir.
I:15286;2566;Memento is filled with the kinds of narrative twists and turns, surprise revelations and moral ambiguities that form the basis for any good example of the genre.
I:15286;2567;More important, Nolan makes Leonard a compellingly sympathetic character, one whom we come to care for because his plight is so heartrending at its core.
I:15286;2568;special note should be taken of Guy Pearce, who delivers a knockout performance as Leonard, perfectly capturing the determination, frustration and emotional pain that define the character.
I:15286;2569;"ann Moss and Joe Pantoliano offer superb support as two perpetual ""strangers"" who play significant roles in Leonard's strangely dislocated and fragmented life ."
I:15286;2570;yet just what those roles are is as much a mystery to us as it is to Leonard.
I:15286;2571;How many movies actually manage to shift our paradigm of perception and make us look anew at the way we observe the world around us?
I:15286;2572;christopher Nolan's brilliant and audacious cinematic tour de force reawakens our faith in the medium and those who dare to challenge it.
I:15286;2573;This totally unique film is as tough to watch as it is rewarding.
I:15286;2574;I watched the film at least 5 times and enjoyed it less each time.
I:15286;2575;I loaned it to a friend for a second opinion.
I:15286;2576;If you like watching the same scene over and over and over and over, each time getting a little longer, then you'll love this movie.
I:15286;2577;Great movies like Exotica, Crash, and Vanilla Sky are wonderfully crafted storys that stretch your perceptions of reality and make you think at the same time.
I:15286;2578;The best actor is a cop, if he is in fact a cop, but we never find out.
I:15286;2579;casting, it coulda been great.
I:15286;2580;This had to be the dumbest movie I've seen in quite a while.
I:15286;2581;"my favorite ""laugh out loud"" moment?"
I:15286;2582;Enough people have already told the plot of this movie but itis so interesting to see such an unusual and unique film beingmade today.
I:15286;2583;It is so clever and how anyone can up with thisstory is beyond me.
I:15286;2584;I love the way you see a scene and then it goes back to why the scene happened.
I:15286;2585;All I can say is GuyPearce is excellent.
I:15286;2586;ButI guess that is what makes it so unique.
I:15286;2587;Look there is so muchcrap out there it is so refreshing too see something so original.You really have to watch this movie again and again and I can'twait.
I:15286;2588;OK so your wife gets raped and killed right in your own house .
I:15286;2589;It is so so creative it's cute .
I:15286;2590;All the actorsand the director in this movie have cut their teeth years ago as being top notch .
I:15286;2591;you will have to pay attention to the movie since it's all encompassing .
I:15286;2592;do a positive review of Memento on Amazon today .
I:15286;2593;I was on the edge of my seat for the entire movie.
I:15286;2594;Along the way, though, if you don't find certainty, you'll at least have fun watching a truly original and engrossing film noire.
I:15286;2595;Took a while to finally see this .
I:15286;2596;very clever, but you have to pay close attention, wondering what parts matter, trying to remember who's who, and just feeling compassion and fear for this guy.
I:15286;2597;the best movie I've seen so far this year.
I:15286;2598;how the acting and direction is great and must be seen to be belevied.
I:15286;2599;this is the only movie that lets you become the leading charecter and you are able to feel for him.
I:15286;2600;The first time I saw it, the movie ended, and I sat there with my eyes wide open and said .
I:15286;2601;And that's because it's an intricate, complex, mind.
I:15286;2602;This movie is utterly amazing.
I:15286;2603;Sure, that's pretty good, basic but good.
I:15286;2604;Now, add this final twist: make the film backwards.
I:15286;2605;This is my favorite movie, and it takes multiple viewings and maybe some cheating (watching it in chronolgical order) to straighten it all up in your mind.
I:15286;2606;Hard to explain the plot of this movie without revealing spoilers, so I'll just say Memento is definitely worth a view, maybe two.
I:15286;2607;But Memento was a terrific exception to the rule, and the filmmakers didn't even have to use special effects as a crutch since the story was compelling.
I:15286;2608;i give all kinds of respect to everyone involved in the making of this film.
I:15286;2609;The script is terrific and Guy Pierce (remember Priscilla, Queen of the Desert?)
I:15286;2610;is a very credible troubled nut case.
I:15286;2611;instructions:1) Watch it the first time2) Think about it.
I:15286;2612;Christopher Nolan has amazed me with every movie he releases.
I:15286;2613;It's one of the best movies of the 2000's.
I:15286;2614;this movie is extremely engaging.
I:15286;2615;It jumps from place to place, although it's still easy to follow.
I:15286;2616;It is loaded to the brim with special features.
I:15286;2617;Includind an excellent audio commentary from Christopher Nolan, plenty of features, a trailer, making of featurettes, and some amazing hidden features including a chance to watch the movie chronologically.
I:15286;2618;I haven't yet tried this but it's definitely worth it to better understand the entire movie.
I:15286;2619;Great special features and a very creative idea!
I:15286;2620;I'm not sure how much replay value this movie has, but it's definitely and interesting watch.
I:15286;2621;I went to see Memento opening weekend with 2 of my friends.
I:15286;2622;I really liked this film but neither one of them did.
I:15286;2623;Certainly the best picture of 2001.
I:15286;2624;The cast is great and the story is one of the most originals I've seen.
I:15286;2625;If you like twists and uncertainies, you will like this.
I:15286;2626;A great director is born!
I:15286;2627;The sign of a true artist is to take a simple story or scene and recreate it masterfully.
I:15286;2628;The endless plot twists, the ingenious editing ploys, the ambiguity and mystery of each character, the backwards tatoos, and oh that cool Jaguar!
I:15286;2629;Guy Pierce deserved the Oscar if for no other reason than he delivered an impeccable American accent (the guy's Australian).
I:15286;2630;this is about as close as modern filmmaking will get to duplicating the effects of Hitchcock's masterpieces.
I:15286;2631;anne Moss is actually similar to the character of Constance played by the gorgeous Ingrid Bergman in Hitchcock's 'Spellbound'.
I:15286;2632;eye observers on the internet spotted Teddy in the background of those flashback scenes.
I:15286;2633;Not only is this movie an enigma, it is also rich thematically.
I:15286;2634;"Teddy, ""the liar,"" often tells it like it is and becomes the audience's source for actually figuring out what is going on."
I:15286;2635;The movie plays with time (reverse chronology) and asks us how genuine are our own memories.
I:15286;2636;very interesting and will have its viewers on the edge of their seats.
I:15286;2637;The stage is set for a tense, dramatic and emotional thriller that tells the story of Leonard Shelby (played by an excellent and pretty fine if I do say so Guy Pearce) in reverse.
I:15286;2638;To remember things, he keeps notes and tattoos important information on his body.
I:15286;2639;With ten minute footage intermixed with a black and white shot subplot, the film takes you on a ride full of twists and turns.
I:15286;2640;'Memento' is truly a great picture, why don't more movies like this get seen or even made?
I:15286;2641;It is definately one that will keep you on the edge of your seat and wondering along with Leonard.
I:15286;2642;I would have to say that this movie is definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen.
I:15286;2643;forwards concept is positively mind.
I:15286;2644;True movie making innovation is achieved in a film called Memento.
I:15286;2645;the movie begins in color with the first scene showing a developed Polaroid picture.
I:15286;2646;Someone's hand shakes the Polaroid, but each time it shakes the picture is fading out.
I:15286;2647;If you are closely paying attention, you realize that the black and white scenes are moving forward in time, while the color scenes are moving from the future, backwards, at the same time.
I:15286;2648;the crazy scene sequence tells an interesting, edge.
I:15286;2649;The most important of these refers to finding his wife's killer.
I:15286;2650;memento is groundbreaking in terms of its innovative, unusual screenplay, which earned an Oscar nomination for best screenplay.
I:15286;2651;The actors do a magnificent job of telling the story and making it very realistic.
I:15286;2652;While the storyline is excellent and the acting is great, the style of scene sequence could leave you frustrated and confused.
I:15286;2653;I'll just add that this is a great movie, and it stays with you afterward.
I:15286;2654;"A day lateer, you'll still be saying to yourself ""Oh!"
I:15286;2655;not to mention guy's body, ouch, literally made me swoon. . . in case you cant tell, i loved this movie, and everyone should definetely own this.
I:15286;2656;while in the other he remains the same as the others develop and transform before our eyes .
I:15286;2657;Teddy's speech at the end.
I:15286;2658;As you can see from the many other reviews, this movie is outstanding.
I:15286;2659;I go to the movies about twice a week, half of them independent films, and this is the best movie I have seen in the past year.
I:15286;2660;This movie tackles many interesting philosophical questions about the construction of the self, memories, and the world using anterograde amnesia as a vehicle.
I:15286;2661;If you like a movie that forces you to think about philosophical issues, this movie is also for you.
I:15286;2662;nolan's film is the most unusual cinematic adventure I've ever seen.
I:15286;2663;What keeps Lenny going is the search for his wife's killer.
I:15286;2664;Because of his condition, he can't remember for more than a few minutes, so he uses notes, picture, tattoos, and conditioning to keep himself on track.
I:15286;2665;But is it the right guy?My Opinion: Memento was gripping from the very first moment and it hasn't let up even though I've finished watching it over 12 hours ago.
I:15286;2666;I loved the concept of Lenny not being able to make any new memories.
I:15286;2667;It fits excellently with the backward method the story is told with.
I:15286;2668;It took some mental work to put the pieces together one by one as they happened, but I thoroughly enjoyed doing it.
I:15286;2669;The subplot of Sammy Jankis rounds out a very full story and makes Memento something very special.
I:15286;2670;I found the acting to be top notch Guy Pearce is awesome as Lenny.
I:15286;2671;Joe Pantoliano is equally as great playing Teddy.
I:15286;2672;No mater what conclusion I come to about Teddy, one thing is certain: Memento is a highly entertaining movie.
I:15286;2673;It is a prime example of why I love movies like I do.
I:15286;2674;Menus: The menus are freaky and very cool.
I:15286;2675;what You Should Do: See this movie.
I:15286;2676;Christopher Nolan gave the world notice in this visionary, virtuoso contemporary film.
I:15286;2677;Worth a second viewing, and a third.
I:15286;2678;I just have to say that this is the best movie I've seen since The Usual Suspects.
I:15286;2679;Everything about this movie is good .
I:15286;2680;the editing is completely awesome because the scene progression puts you precisely in the mindset of Leonard, and the acting is great.
I:15286;2681;The plot is decent, but how it is presented is absolutely phenomenal.
I:15286;2682;I hope it's represented at the Oscars this year.
I:15286;2683;"We looked on the main page and found the extra ""hints"" at the bottom right."
I:15286;2684;There were still some items to discuss, but we thoroughly enjoyed the movie and the discussion.
I:15286;2685;i'm going to have to watch it another few times!
I:15286;2686;It was moments like that that made this film something above the usual noir thriller.
I:15286;2687;or that I appreciated it on some artistic level of genious.
I:15286;2688;But I really have to say that I enjoyed it.
I:15286;2689;The best word to describe it is compelling.
I:15286;2690;Memento is a remarkable, one of a kind film that bears (and probably requires) multiple viewing.
I:15286;2691;This film is utterly fascinating for its ability to put the viewer into someone else's head.
I:15286;2692;"The director Christopher Nolan created a superb piece of art
I:15286;2693;This is a great movie and the least I want is to throw any spoilers, but trust me when I say that if you haven't seen this movie you should go and give it a try.
I:15286;2694;Memento is a fascinating study of memory and how it shapes our reality.
I:15286;2695;It also explores the way in which some people will readily exploit the misfortune of others.
I:15286;2696;Christopher Nolan has crafted an inventive psychological thriller that keeps the viewer guessing right up until the final scene.
I:15286;2697;Guy Pierce gives a nicely measured performance and is supported by a solid cast.
I:15286;2698;It's an enjoyable challenge to rewind the movie in your head, as you watch, in order to keep track of the reversed narrative.
I:15286;2699;off at the end is also quite satisfying.
I:15286;2700;masterful, so intricatly thought out it can cause dizzieness just thinking about it.
I:15286;2701;The most original film I'v seen since Fight Club.
I:15286;2702;This is a great film, I saw it at the theater a few years ago and was blown away, I really liked how the film goes forward and back, it felt fresh and original.
I:15286;2703;Guy Pearce is fantastic in this film, he is such an underrated actor, people often tell me I look like him, so it's weird to watch him in this role, because his character is so confused and lost, it really resonated.
I:15286;2704;It was so cool how he wrote things on his body so he would remember, you could feel his desperation, really a great performance.
I:15286;2705;If you appreciate great film making and enjoy a great performance then I can't imagine you not liking this film, it will stay with you.
I:15286;2706;This film, easily the most original film (the only other candidate being Being John Malkovich ) of the past ten years, is also probably the best film made so far this year.
I:15286;2707;If you get up to use the bathroom, I promise you'll miss something crucial (and you'll want to remember everything you can for the astonishing, much.
I:15286;2708;technically, the film is exceptional.
I:15286;2709;The music and cinematography is first.
I:15286;2710;Guy Pearce conveys phenomenal depth and range as the desperate, troubled, yet wry Leonard.
I:15286;2711;moss (almost wholly unrecognizable after The Matrix ) shines as the bitter, yet tender Natalie.
I:15286;2712;It's a magnificent performance, and one that well deserves award recognition.
I:15286;2713;Some of it is very intense, and it certainly will mess with your mind.
I:15286;2714;But for all those patient and willing enough to sit through it, think about it, and give it a chance, it will prove to be that most rare type of film: a film that proves as intellectually stimulating and challenging as it does entertaining.
I:15286;2715;most stunning for me was how well the story.
I:15286;2716;off of the segmented story , instead it uses a very unique timeline approach.
I:15286;2717;First the good: This is an amazing film.
I:15286;2718;Guy Pearce is brilliant, as is Christopher Nolan.
I:15286;2719;The moodiness and the style in which this film unfolds is a tour de force.
I:15286;2720;"I've watched it many times, including the ""chronological"" version ."
I:15286;2721;This movie is a very , very good movie.
I:15286;2722;It works backward (you find out why on the end) what is so great about this movie is that when you think you got everything figured out (or at least something) it backfires at you and changes your idea.
I:15286;2723;Director Christopher Nolan recieved a great deal of critical acclaim for Momento, and deservedly so.
I:15286;2724;The film is unlike any film before it, and the amount of thought and artistry put into the film make it a true masterpiece.
I:15286;2725;Joe Pantoliano does a great job in this film, as does Carrie.
I:15286;2726;anne Moss, but Guy Pearce really does a marvelous job.
I:15286;2727;"He uses body language and other subtle devices to make his ""condition"" truly believeable."
I:15286;2728;The special features menu is a giant puzzle which you must decipher to access certain features, and it is very entertaining and enjoyable.
I:15286;2729;This limited edition version is worth every penny and is a must have if you love this film.
I:15286;2730;The most original movie that has come out this year.
I:15286;2731;Such a rare feat in movies today.
I:15286;2732;I personally didn't find the storyline to be paticually confusing, but have spoken to some very smart people who have.
I:15286;2733;Guy Pearce is a nice looking man, but wow, those tatoos were pretty freaky looking.
I:15286;2734;In any case, this is definately a movie to watch while your fully awake and was very entertaining.
I:15286;2735;Like Following, this new improved edition of Memento features the remastered version supervised by Chris Nolan.
I:15286;2736;Plus new interviews to the director.
I:15286;2737;I'd have to say that this is one of or possibly *the* greatest movies of recent years (or any year for that matter).
I:15286;2738;otherwise this is the movie for you.
I:15286;2739;repeat viewings are required to fully grasp what the Director had in mind.
I:15286;2740;btw the directors commentary is pretty interesting as well.
I:15286;2741;A certain scene will play until it reaches the starting point of the scene before it.
I:15286;2742;He also takes pictures and makes notes to remember people or places that he's been to.
I:15286;2743;The film is executed brilliantly and showcases the perfect actors.
I:15286;2744;And the film co. stars Carrie.
I:15286;2745;The film also has a terrific twist of an ending.
I:15286;2746;5 stars, one of my favorite films.
I:15286;2747;They actually managed to make it work, I give them GREAT credit for that.
I:15286;2748;That to me was the greatest achievement.
I:15286;2749;This is one of the most twisted, yet edge of your seat movies I've ever seen.
I:15286;2750;Chistopher Nolan is now one of my favorite directors of all time after watching this SPELLBINDING flick!
I:15286;2751;It truely is a masterpiece for our generation of TWIST AND TURN movies.
I:15286;2752;"There is something subtly funny about the lengths Leonard will go to seek revenge for his wife's death,as he attempts to rationally cope with his disability, including Polaroid photos, notes to himself, maps, and body tattoos
I:15286;2753;By this constant discipline he hopes to overcome his disability.
I:15286;2754;I thought this film was strong in almost all ways, including its portrayal of L. a. lowlife,a brutal drug.
I:15286;2755;leonard constantly forces himself to remember Sammy.
I:15286;2756;All Leonard knows is he loved his wife, and he has mementos of their life to prove it.
I:15286;2757;He even has a call girl come in to recreate their former life.
I:15286;2758;The film is very good at evoking for the audience a state of mind of short.
I:15286;2759;a backwards movie with surprise beginnings!
I:15286;2760;Very well done movie that I don't mind watching over and over.
I:15286;2761;It is well worth the staight attention you have to pay.
I:15286;2762;This movie has such a great story to it.
I:15286;2763;I absolutely love the way it was filmed and put together.
I:15286;2764;Memento is one of the most intriguing films!
I:15286;2765;, and i understand why she says that, but its F. ed up in a good way.
I:15286;2766;it was very refreshing to see another film like that, but it seperates itself from the pack!
I:15286;2767;It's on a whole new level, just like The Matrix is!
I:15286;2768;i like how the film, makes u, well it made me be a part of the film, and i felt it wanted me to feel how lenny felt.
I:15286;2769;There will never be a film like this again.
I:15286;2770;The acting is very good.
I:15286;2771;Guy really does capture his character very well.
I:15286;2772;He has a come a looooong way!
I:15286;2773;Joe and Carrie are also very good!!
I:15286;2774;Confusing films are a lot more fun!
I:15286;2775;We see events unfold and new information is introduced each time.
I:15286;2776;This time, Nolan tells it in color and uses reverse chronological order.
I:15286;2777;It requires patience and your full attention to understand what is going on.
I:15286;2778;in order to function at all, Leonard employs a series of devices to aid his memory.
I:15286;2779;When you see the closing scenes, you'll understand what his true motive may be.
I:15286;2780;natalie (Moss) is also claiming to help Leonard by providing information.
I:15286;2781;Are they even who they say they are?I've seen Memento at least twice a year since I first saw it.
I:15286;2782;It has endless replay value and it's interesting to see some of the events unfold when you know the outcome.
I:15286;2783;Nolan gets the little details right as well as the big ones.
I:15286;2784;each time I watch a Nolan movie I think it's the best thing he has ever done.
I:15286;2785;Whether it's The Dark Knight, Inception, The Prestige, or Memento, he treats his audience with respect.
I:15286;2786;That alienates some viewers, as it did with my friends, but the payoff is worth it if you are willing to pay full attention.
I:15286;2787;It didn't do well in the theatres because nobody knew how to market it (the trailer is truly awful), but it has done excellently on video due to wonderful word of mouth.
I:15286;2788;definitely pay a few bucks extra for the special edition.
I:15286;2789;what is really engaging about this movie are the twist and turns along the way that lead to a very satisfying payoff.
I:15286;2790;minute flashback seens begin and end in exactly the right places.
I:15286;2791;Each new revelation and twist leads logically to the next.
I:15286;2792;I however loved those movies, and found Memento to be endlessly fascinating.
I:15286;2793;(There's definitely room for a few).
I:15286;2794;stop the movie if you take a break!
I:15286;2795;is this is like seeing the very, very best of Hitchcock.
I:15286;2796;The twists and turns have twists and turns.
I:15286;2797;but at the end of the movie) is totally unexpected and jolting.
I:15286;2798;people will be watching this movie as a great classic.
I:15286;2799;Throughout this film you are given glimpses into events which precede those already seen, making for a unique film that raises the question, Can one trust one's own memory?
I:15286;2800;I was really impressed with the acting and the story.
I:15286;2801;It unfolded beautifully and anyone who doesn't require explosions, machine guns and a movie that will keep you guessing will love this movie.
I:15286;2802;the whole production is fantastic.
I:15286;2803;great movie, a must see for action and movie fans alike.
I:15286;2804;"the way this movie is filmed is fairly unique
I:15286;2805;he is just so easily remembered.
I:15286;2806;it's not a bad movie with some credible acting and otherwise good direction.
I:15286;2807;Memento is an absolute masterpiece of modern film.
I:15286;2808;Christopher Nolan does a perfect job of capturing the emotion and despair of Leonard Shelby.
I:15286;2809;Memento is one of the most exciting thrillers to come out in a loooong time, and will stand as a milestone in filmmaking for this century, and the next.
I:15286;2810;This movie is interesting in the way it is edited.
I:15286;2811;I think the actors are well cast and I wanted to own it so I could watch it when I am in a weird mood.
I:15286;2812;This movie is amazing but lets give credit where credit is due.
I:15286;2813;This movie is enjoyable up till the ending.
I:15286;2814;There are other movies like this: _Primal Fear_ comes to mind.
I:15286;2815;but up until that phony ending, it's a real nice movie.
I:15286;2816;The backwards narration forces you to give your full attention, and the result is that you become deeply involved in what's going on.
I:15286;2817;It's quite an experience, and I guess ultimately I recommend this movie for that reason.
I:15286;2818;From my title.you can tell i love this movie.
I:15286;2819;I like a lot of psychological thrillers/horrors.
I:15286;2820;this movie redefines psychological thriller.
I:15286;2821;Without giving to much of this great and sometimes confusing story, i will now tell some of it.
I:15286;2822;He now is seeking vengence.
I:15286;2823;To remember things he stays organized and keeps notes.
I:15286;2824;What is most amazing about this story is 1) the way it is presented, they start from the end and work to the begginging.
I:15286;2825;No movie has done that before, and this movie has done it very well.
I:15286;2826;An amazing movie, with some of the best acting I have ever seen.
I:15286;2827;Because it is so well done.
I:15286;2828;I'm about one of the only people in my town *very big town.
I:15286;2829;or in my state probably that has ever even seen or heard of this wonderful movie.
I:15286;2830;It gives you a wonderful experience that you've never seen before.
I:15286;2831;If not being able to follow what happens to the narrator qualifies as unique moviemaking, then it is one of a kind.
I:15286;2832;Some people have hailed it as the intellect's movie.
I:15286;2833;But, an intellect's movie is good because the movie is intelligent, not because you have to be intelligent to understand the movie.
I:15286;2834;Been ages since I've seen it (bought it for a friend) but it's a great movie.
I:15286;2835;It will keep you guessing, and for me, was a surprise ending.
I:15286;2836;The first time, I thought it w the perfect example of overblown avent garde, with redeeming visual factors.
I:15286;2837;The 2nd time, I was drunk, so I liked it.
I:15286;2838;Don't worry about any big names other than Joe Pantelione He's the best of the bunch.
I:15286;2839;If you enjoyed Things To Do In Denver (Andy Garcia/Christopher Walken) you will count this as a film to watch three times.
I:15286;2840;The storytelling is still just as interesting the second time around.
I:15286;2841;But like all types of equipment and software, they tend to shine at the end and so I got to see this movie completely forward instead of the original direction.
I:15286;2842;The movie is pure art house.
I:15286;2843;It certainly was worth it, though, to get to the end (actually, the beginning) and see what the filmmakers had accomplished.
I:15286;2844;The acting is very good here, and the characters are all believable and fascinating.
I:15286;2845;The most fascinating thing about it is that they've created a film that mirrors the main character's method of keeping track of things.
I:15286;2846;We'll never know who Leonard truly is or what he's truly done, but this film is a great ride to get to the end (beginning) of the road.
I:15286;2847;Wow, this movie is good.
I:15286;2848;i highly recommend this movie I can pretty much guarantee that this will definitely be a memorable viewing experience.
I:15286;2849;bonuses are amazing and very interesting and the packaging is the best i ever seen after FIGHT CLUB and SE7EN!
I:15286;2850;I am also a huge fan of movies that are a little off the mainstream path.
I:15286;2851;This is definitely a unique style, and if it would have worked, I would have been thrilled with the technique.
I:15286;2852;nOTE: I really give the film 2.5 stars.
I:15286;2853;It's has a story that is a little below average, but the unique presentation style is thoughtful and a welcome change to most Hollywood garbage.
I:15286;2854;Truly an imaginative way to experience a movie .
I:15286;2855;Excellent dialogue, especially for Guy Pearce.
I:15286;2856;All in all, fits into my top 10 favorites of all time (displacing Pulp Fiction)
I:15286;2857;First things first:The movie:Memento is an ingenious film center on the life of Leonard Shelby, a brain.
I:15286;2858;It is this unusual presentation that drives the movie.
I:15286;2859;What would otherwise be a relatively dull plot is brilliantly revealed in turns and twists in this presentation.
I:15286;2860;The acting in the film is good though not brilliant, with the best work coming from those around an above.
I:15286;2861;This film's heart is black at best, and takes a decidedly bleak and utilitarian outlook.
I:15286;2862;ultimately, though, if you see the movie once, you will want and need to see it again, and likely again.
I:15286;2863;which brings us to this very unusual disc.
I:15286;2864;The packaging itself, which mimic a patient's file at a mental hospital, sheds light on the enigmatic Leonard Shelby and his past.
I:15286;2865;The package also provide some hidden instructions for viewing the first disc.
I:15286;2866;This brings us to the second disc.
I:15286;2867;This is an artistic decision that borders on cruel, but fits with the overall ethos of the film.
I:15286;2868;The features are worth finding, but not worth the huge investment it would take to do so.
I:15286;2869;Because it is a tremendous movie, and the special features are unique and very good, I give the disc the 5.
I:15286;2870;the masterfull editing is what makes this film really shine.
I:15286;2871;Fantastic film, the ending is the best too.
I:15286;2872;The film is stylish and intelligent, smartly and ingeniously directed, and exploring a number of profound issues such as memory, identity and learning techniques, though it's overburdened by its elaborate and complex plot, which demands total concentration on the part of the viewer, or else the thread is lost.
I:15286;2873;For buffs of art cinema, but definitely not for those who want some fast.
I:15286;2874;This is the best noir mystery thriller I've seen in many years.
I:15286;2875;is excellent) has anterograde amnesia, and is seeking revenge for his injury and his wife's murder.
I:15286;2876;The story unfolds backwards, in brief spans, in a way that grabs your interest in the unravelling, like a top.
I:15286;2877;If you love mystery thrillers, or like studying films, this film is a must.
I:15286;2878;This includes some insights into this film, the festival showings, and the relationship between this film and his brother's short story.
I:15286;2879;this is an independent film that leaped from the festivals to the big screens, which is rare.
I:15286;2880;layered story, editing, and acting are the reason for it's success.
I:15286;2881;anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano (both from Matrix), are excellent.
I:15286;2882;It does have many small twists, including the ending.
I:15286;2883;it's original, well told, and amusing.
I:15286;2884;there are a lot of excellent movies whose scripts rewrote the rules of cinematic storytelling (the Oscar.
I:15286;2885;"winning ""The Usual Suspects"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" are two good examples)."
I:15286;2886;Memento deserves a place among those films: it's the most complex, original, innovative, intriguing achievement to hit the big screen in a while.
I:15286;2887;"Director Christopher Nolan manages to pull off a rare feat in the film business these days by taking the entire industry by storm with his incredible intelligent, disjointed thriller ""Memento""."
I:15286;2888;While many films have since tried to imitate its taut script and superb execuation, it remains one fo the most unique and thought.
I:15286;2889;from the beginning you realize you're not watching the usual thriller: the reversed opening sequence is a fascinating narrative choice, and even more fascinating is the director's decision to tell the whole story backwards, with each separate scene ending where the previous one began.
I:15286;2890;"He also gets some valuable help from a cop, ""Teddy"" (Joe Pantoliano), and a barmaid, Natalie (Carrie."
I:15286;2891;But should he really trust them, given he can't almost even trust himself due to his neurological condition.
I:15286;2892;Nolan (who screenwrote the film as well) knows how to build up the tension, as well as add emotion, with the touching parallel story of Sammy Jankis (Stephen Tobolowsky), a man with the same disease as Leonard.
I:15286;2893;"both Pearce and Tobolowsky are superb as the two troubled men: the former makes you feel as uneasy as he does almost immediately, and he's got some really ace lines (""How am I supposed to heal if I can't feel time?"")"
I:15286;2894;Pantoliano and Moss are very impressive too, their true intentions remaining unclear until the end.
I:15286;2895;Nolan beautifully intertwines the present and the past, linking events together like a detective putting all the clues together until the thief is found.
I:15286;2896;"While ""Memento"" is thoroughly composed with its intertwining plot, the film's great strength can also be considered it potential flaw."
I:15286;2897;Nolan's story and the ensemble cast's acting are outstanding, but a mention also has to go to the cinematography and soundtrack that both helped greatly to create the oppressive mood that pervaded throughout he film and is essential to generate the sense of fragility that exists in Leonard's connection to the world.
I:15286;2898;An intelligent, profound, and supreme addition to the genre.
I:15286;2899;One of the best films of the decade thus far.
I:15286;2900;Masterpiece a. Year this seen I've movie best the arguably.
I:15286;2901;blowing action thriller is one of the best ones in movie history.
I:15286;2902;Guy Pierce is totally hot (for me) and the story is so fast and complicated we watched it three times in row (boyfriend).
I:15286;2903;This is spectacular film with great tension, great characters, great mood, a hint of horror in the way he's losing his mind, good action, and overall a really cool experience.
I:15286;2904;A movie unlike any I have seen (and I watch a lot).
I:15286;2905;Very well written and acted.
I:15286;2906;i had to watch it and my son, who is studying to write movies/TV had to add it to his library as a great example of a mind twisting tale.
I:15286;2907;As I left the theater, my mind clouded with all of the images and story of the film, I realized that I had seen a great addition to the film noir canon.
I:15286;2908;Wow spelled backwards is still Wow!
I:15286;2909;I get up and leave the packed independent theater.
I:15286;2910;If I do, I will rob a moviegoer of a potential surprise.
I:15286;2911;He can't talk to people on the phone, because he has to see their eyes, a skill he learned as a former insurance investigator.
I:15286;2912;"if ""Memento"" were laid out in a typical chronological fashion, it would be an interesting film with some good performances."
I:15286;2913;Christopher Nolan, the writer and director, decided to tell the film backwards.
I:15286;2914;Shakes it a few more times, and so on, until the picture pops out of the camera.
I:15286;2915;This helps the audience really feel for Leonard's plight.
I:15286;2916;This construction is really brilliant and it is a testament to the skill of Nolan that the film does not seem as gimmicky as I just described it.
I:15286;2917;The story of Sammy Jankis provides a very human aspect to the story and allows us to see Leonard as a normal human being.
I:15286;2918;The story also helps us to understand Leonard's plight.
I:15286;2919;guy Pearce is simply phenomenal.
I:15286;2920;The scenes when he is on the telephone, recounting the story of Sammy Jankis also help to humanize the character.
I:15286;2921;ann Moss is very good as the required Noir femme fatale.
I:15286;2922;She has a simply amazing couple of scenes in the middle of the film during which we quickly see who she is, what her role is and how deeply Leonard's problem affects him.
I:15286;2923;She is a very strong character.
I:15286;2924;Joe Pantoliano plays Teddy, Leonard's ally.
I:15286;2925;Teddy is a very complex character who likes to talk and he talks a lot.
I:15286;2926;Memento is a very memorable film, sure to delight you with its twists and turns.
I:15286;2927;Everything I have heard leads me to believe that I will enjoy the film immensely.
I:15286;2928;Well, this is how you'll feel with Memento .
I:15286;2929;This fascinating flick, destined to rack up the Academy Awards,is an example of one of the most original methods of filming editing.
I:15286;2930;Based on 10 minute segments going BACKWARDS, this movie unfolds into a terrific thriller!
I:15286;2931;BOTH deserve awards for their performances!
I:15286;2932;must have classic, tour de force by guy pearce, an unforgettable movie.
I:15286;2933;Slower than the color story is a black and white story that starts from the beginning and tries to do it's best to describe the situation.
I:15286;2934;overall it was very impressive and very well done, and to think it was filmed in 24 or 25 days, UNBELIEVABLE!I think that this movie is a classic.
I:15286;2935;This movie is shot backwards.
I:15286;2936;The last scene is basically the first, while the first is the conclusion.
I:15286;2937;He also tatoos the clues onto his skin.
I:15286;2938;This man is a freak, but quite interesting.
I:15286;2939;this was my first experience with Guy Pearce in a leading role, and he was impressive, accurately portraying Leonard Shelby's sense of hopeful but frustrated determination to overcome his short.
I:15286;2940;moment sense of reality, bringing him into contact with a variety of interesting characters, most of whom viciously manipulate him.
I:15286;2941;Not sure I would want to own it, but a very interesting story that compels you to follow it to completion.
I:15286;2942;Anyone who's read the Count of Monte Christo knows how this one ends.
I:15286;2943;But you cannot deny the process is brilliant.
I:15286;2944;I think Memento is a fine, interesting film.
I:15286;2945;Where is the clever ending?
I:15286;2946;The entire movies builds to something you think you would never expect.
I:15286;2947;The ending is anticlimactic at best.
I:15286;2948;this was an excellent movie, in my head the best since fight club.
I:15286;2949;The style was so unique and refreshing.
I:15286;2950;Guy Pearce did an excellent job, as well as Carrie.
I:15286;2951;Memento is a really wonderful thriller that captivates and entertains.
I:15286;2952;It's funny at times, scary at times, and confusing at times but it is definitely one of the most creative and tricky movies I've seen in a long time.
I:15286;2953;It's one of those movies that you talk about for a long time after you've watched it.
I:15286;2954;There is much to like here.
I:15286;2955;The film is a tour de force in many respects.
I:15286;2956;In the best art, a kind of sublime simplicity is achieved.
I:15286;2957;Any aesthetic connection to deeper ideas is really just gravy.
I:15286;2958;Memento is more of a Borges story elaborated to epic proportions.
I:15286;2959;"The ""profound"" content about identity, projection, etc. really could have been explored with less fuss."
I:15286;2960;still, hats off to the filmmakers and cast for an impressive, if dubious achievement: this is probably the best film of its genre.
I:15286;2961;"addendum, 2011: By now, after ""Inception,"" Christopher Nolan has revealed the full measure of his mediocrity."
I:15286;2962;The movie is told in forward flashes of events that are to come that compensate for his unreliable memory, during which he has liaisons with various complex characters.
I:15286;2963;packed thriller, this is the best movie.
I:15286;2964;Sit back and find out just how twisted and complex Leonard's world is.
I:15286;2965;and the devastation is breath taking.
I:15286;2966;"But still ""Memento"" takes the film noir genre and it's concerns and wraps them up in the trappings of postmodern thought to take the genre where it's never gone before."
I:15286;2967;"When these are combined with the traditional themes and trappings of the film noir, you end up with ""Memento."
I:15286;2968;"What ""Memento"" does is take these noir trappings and raise them to the nth degree of confusion."
I:15286;2969;This is also an outre and compelling crime story.
I:15286;2970;Memento is a film that is undeniably original.
I:15286;2971;The fun of the movie is plugging the pieces together and arranging the plat in your head so it adds up.
I:15286;2972;provoking and will keep you asking questions until the shocking final reveal.
I:15286;2973;It is a movie that will require multiple viewings and each time you watch you will still enjoy it.
I:15286;2974;It definitely adds a whole new level with features like Chronological Viewing and the inclusion of the original story.
I:15286;2975;If you need a new idea, a movie that can change your perception of the industry, this is the film for you.
I:15286;2976;This is one of those films that keeps you going by making you want to figure out what's really happening.
I:15286;2977;Memento was the best movie of 2001.
I:15286;2978;I figure some thing new out with every vewing and that is only something a truly great movie could do.
I:15286;2979;The acting in the movie is top notch.
I:15286;2980;is outstanding, he really makes you beilve that is chactor has this problem.
I:15286;2981;This is her best carrer performance.
I:15286;2982;Christopher Nolan is a really good director.
I:15286;2983;But if they don't that is okay becaue both way's it would be great.
I:15286;2984;Just love this movie, the cast is great, Christopher Nolan is a great story teller.
I:15286;2985;To help himself survive, Leonard takes Polaroid pictures of everything and writes important details on the back.
I:15286;2986;anne Moss (Matrix) and Joe Pantoliano pull off superb performances in their major supporting roles.
I:15286;2987;christopher Nolan's direction is pure genius.
I:15286;2988;At first the idea seems absurd, but it works brilliantly.
I:15286;2989;It makes for a film full of suspense, energy, and excitement.
I:15286;2990;This movie is one of the most intriguing stories that have been told on film, mysterious but clear if you stick with it.
I:15286;2991;"He held this story together perfectly and allowed us to get into the mind of this poor man who's on a mission that at most times is so hard for him to stay focused on because of his ""condition"" so he delevops ways to remind himself of important details about his quest for revenge that are quite amazing."
I:15286;2992;Christopher Nolan's screenwriting is wonderful.
I:15286;2993;Guy Pierce gave a good preformace.
I:15286;2994;I enjoyed it much more, but after the second time.
I:15286;2995;After all, there'sonly so many wise.
I:15286;2996;cracking family pets and rule.
I:15286;2997;breakingcops a person can take.
I:15286;2998;As a result of this, clevermovies.
I:15286;2999;and so it is with `Memento', a pastiche of JimThompson.
I:15286;3000;Memento, granted, will take you at least two viewings before you really understand the true beauty of a movie that runs backwards.
I:15286;3001;He can remembe reverything very well up to the injury but after that, forget about it.
I:15286;3002;He has to take polorids of everything, write notes, tatoos, all in this grand search for the murderer of his wife.
I:15286;3003;By running backwards, repeating scenes over and over, by the time its over you are left with a full story, a full movie, and a tremendous impact of what memory is and just how a story can be told.
I:15286;3004;i was highly impressed by Memento and undoubtedly will continue to watch, and re.
I:15286;3005;watch it, each time gaining more from the story, the technique, and the movie itself.
I:15286;3006;The story is new, interesting and compelling.
I:15286;3007;Now take that concept and show it to the movie going public.
I:15286;3008;What you get is Christopher Nolans' masterpiece 'Memento'.
I:15286;3009;this is one of those movies that really keeps you on the edge of your seat.
I:15286;3010;A story like keeps you watching and thinking and that's probably why this movie is praised by millions.
I:15286;3011;The cast is phenomenal and package is perfect.
I:15286;3012;The funny thing is Nolan is now this huge director because of his re.
I:15286;3013;That's why this film should be a true.
I:15286;3014;It is such an incredible movie it is not to be missed.
I:15286;3015;A dark, disturbing mystery suspense film that once the story takes hold, leaves one panting for the truth.
I:15286;3016;I absolutely adore this movie.
I:15286;3017;The format speaks to the content, the content is very original, funny, spooky and thought.
I:15286;3018;I've read case studies about things like this, and his portrayal of a man searching for some, any, meaning to his moment.
I:15286;3019;moment existence is remarkable and heart.
I:15286;3020;This is the most perfectly put.
I:15286;3021;This was a great movie.
I:15286;3022;Guy Pearce is amazing in it.
I:15286;3023;That is was makes it so clever and unique.
I:15286;3024;It is also directed by Christopher Nolan was is a genius.
I:15286;3025;In this case, the written story made it big due to the excellent movie, not the other way around.
I:15286;3026;A nourish thriller about a man who can only remember the last few minutes of his life and has to find the killer(s) of his wife.
I:15286;3027;But after viewing it, I thought it to be the best movie to come out in years.
I:15286;3028;this is a treat not only because it's so damn good, but also because it's so original and unconventional.
I:15286;3029;christapher nolan is a genius, and this is one of his gem's.
I:15286;3030;You could try to convince yourself about a particular scene, but the next scence challenges you because the movie is presented in a way that you will understand the entire stuff if you watch it from back to front.
I:15286;3031;A modern epic by Chris Nolan, that you will never understand if you are watching it for the first time.
I:15286;3032;this movie is a thriller, and more than the plot, I loved the way it was presented.
I:15286;3033;This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.
I:15286;3034;It is original, superbly acted and brilliantly edited together for a unique viewing experience.
I:15286;3035;The style in which the film explains the story is brilliant, as another way of developing such a unique character would have proven inadequate.
I:15286;3036;All is revealed in the movies satisfying and unexpected ending (er, beginning).
I:15286;3037;Memento is a creative and intellingent story that is crafted brilliantly and assisted further by stellar performances from all the movie's players.
I:15286;3038;I want to start by saying I love this movie.
I:15286;3039;Guy Pearce does an incredible job of getting over the affliction that is in this character's heart over his condition and the loss of his wife.
I:15286;3040;Amazing concept, amazing movie, and an amazing first outing for director Christopher Nolan.
I:15286;3041;You want to remember it, because the first time is the best.
I:15286;3042;You ARE Leonard, because you know exactly what he knows .
I:15286;3043;which isn't to say that this movie isn't excellent the second time around, or the third, or the fourth . . . it's still an enthralling few hours or so.
I:15286;3044;Besides, the acting in this film is absolutely smashing.
I:15286;3045;Guy Pierce is amazing as a protagonist who, while a less.
I:15286;3046;perfect individual, is a mirror of ourselves.
I:15286;3047;While not a pleasant little movie, it is pure genius, and for those who can handle a bit of cynicism .
I:15286;3048;this is an absolute must.
I:15286;3049;In what must be one of the best movies in years, Christopher Nolan has directed a story that is both intelligent and surprising to the viewer.
I:15286;3050;The director insists that the viewer pay attention.
I:15286;3051;guy Pearce is excellent in the lead role as are all the supporting cast, especially Carrie.
I:15286;3052;term memeroy loss and reverse chronology of the storytelling work wonderfully, surprising you and challenging you pre.
I:15286;3053;The editor, who's name escapes me, is certainly to be commended for their work.
I:15286;3054;one of the best films to come out of Hollywood in years.
I:15286;3055;The second time, it was more focused and geared toward the plot and ideas, felt more in synchronisation with this rather bold and complex storyline.
I:15286;3056;Memento has something elusive and cryptic about its ideas and thoughts and leaves for multiple discussion and dissecting of particular scenes (in addition, the cinematography, performances, Hans Zimmer.
I:15286;3057;esque soundtrack, indie feel/credibility, and Hitchcockian/Fincher.
I:15286;3058;esque vibes that ring true in this film are prevalent!
I:15286;3059;In all respect, this film is surprisingly more superior than Inception and The Dark Knight Rises given its source material, its foundation, and credentials.
I:15286;3060;Thought provoking in many layers with an intriguing plot.
I:15286;3061;it will have you guessing, wondering, THINKING.
I:15286;3062;this is gripping and puzzling.
I:15286;3063;anyways, this movie is amazing and awesome and what film should aspire to be!
I:15286;3064;As far as the movie its one of the best movies of the decade and started off the beginning of Christopher Nolan tear of great movies.
I:15286;3065;The reason for this is that the real twists of the movie are revealed at the beginning of the story.
I:15286;3066;I was absolutely SHOCKED at the end.
I:15286;3067;Really, this movie is a classic when it comes to suspense and originality.
I:15286;3068;He has to write down everything and take pictures of every person.
I:15286;3069;This also adds to the interest of the movie.
I:15286;3070;guy Pearce was phenominal, and deserved a 2001 Oscar nomination.
I:15286;3071;He makes you dislike him, much like he did in The Matrix.
I:15286;3072;He has proved time and time again that he is a wonderful talent.
I:15286;3073;I do often notice how she is a good character actress.
I:15286;3074;I have seen her in three movies: The Matrix, this movie, and one of my favorites, Chocolat.
I:15286;3075;In each movie she really plays the specific characteristics of each person well.
I:15286;3076;I look forward to seeing more of her movies.
I:15286;3077;see this movie keeps giving long after other ones are forgotten on a shelf!Guy Pearce is one of those characters I find extremely watchable.
I:15286;3078;Memento is an interesting film that toys with the ideas of time, memory, and indentity.
I:15286;3079;Joe Pantoliano is excellent as Lenny's acquaintance and Pearce himself also delivers a memorable performance.
I:15286;3080;It's a tribute to screenwriter/director Nolan that he created such a compelling and thought.
I:15286;3081;It's rare to find an unconventional approach to film making that really works.
I:15286;3082;guy Pierce is excellent in the role of Lenny, a man who has suffered a severe head injury while trying to defend his wife against an attack by burglars.
I:15286;3083;The most important clues that he uncovers he has tattooed all over his body.
I:15286;3084;It raises intriguing questions about the role of memory in our perception of reality.
I:15286;3085;But MEMENTO is extremely well made (Oscar nominated for Best Film Editing) and well worth the effort for anyone who appreciates film as art and is not intimidated by complexity.
I:15286;3086;this is one of those rare thrillers that in this day and age is daring,edgy,compelling and actually makes you think(whooooa).
I:15286;3087;Maybe i'm being a little pompous by saying this, but this may well be one of the best and most daring thrillers I have seen and should be watched and enjoyed by casual movie watchers and film buffs alike.
I:15286;3088;He lives in the immediate present tense.
I:15286;3089;The two major co. stars are Joe Pantoliano and Carrie.
I:15286;3090;and it has a great ending i loved it!
I:15286;3091;This movie twists the laws of film making, and boggles minds all at once.
I:15286;3092;Watch this movie a couple times, let it sink in and intoxicate your mind, it will make you question your own memory, as well as the world around you.
I:15286;3093;Take a closer look into the best movie in years, Mememto is a true film worth all the hype.
I:15286;3094;By withholding from us the content of the previous scene, we truly see the world as Leonard does.
I:15286;3095;Simply put, you are who you remember you are.
I:15286;3096;A slightly more artsy film, Dark City , explores this concept as well, if more fantastically.
I:15286;3097;If you enjoyed The Sixth Sense or The Game , you will enjoy Memento.
I:15286;3098;A series of logical revelations lead us to the start/end, which is ultimately satisfying.
I:15286;3099;The tone throughout is gritty, realistic and dark .
I:15286;3100;i will be honest the plot is not the best at times but, the movie sucks you up into it.
I:15286;3101;like some of the more alternate genre movies this one starts at the end of the movie and leads you back to the beginning in steps.
I:15286;3102;It helps you to distinguish between past and now using black and white photo and color photo both.
I:15286;3103;sit back and enjoy this one folks.
I:15286;3104;If the screenplay isn't clever enough to engage the movie.
I:15286;3105;Much the same effect as Quentin Tarantino uses.
I:15286;3106;When the movie ended, I felt cheated because the mystery is so profoundly mudane.
I:15286;3107;Give me Hitchcock any day.
I:15286;3108;there is nothing clever about this.
I:15286;3109;I was really looking forward to this as the complexity and originality of it had been highlighted by many reviews.
I:15286;3110;they've done it so we can put the pieces together ourselves .
I:15286;3111;But if you open your eyes, you'll realize they clued us into the ending constantly during the movie.
I:15286;3112;They dont like a plot line and ending you have to think much about.
I:15286;3113;For fans of intelligent AND highly entertaining movies (im not an art house fan) pick this one up.
I:15286;3114;In the film, Guy Pierce has a rare condition in which he has no short.
I:15286;3115;This handicap makes everything harder, as he has to take polariod pictures of people he meets and writes notes upon them to remember something about that person.
I:15286;3116;Without ever lowering its sharp intensity, Momento comes to a close with not only a satisfying, but an all to poignant end.
I:15286;3117;That was how it got popular .
I:15286;3118;The additional features are well worth the extra amount.
I:15286;3119;memento is a great movie,because it is a very ambitious picture.
I:15286;3120;memento is full of suspense andyou don`t know what happens next.
I:15286;3121;nevertheless the movie is really remarkable.
I:15286;3122;I fell in love with this movie and Guy Pearce as an actor the 1st time I saw this, I have seen it twice since and I still love it.
I:15286;3123;This movie rocks, I give it 5 stars and .
I:15286;3124;to create a convincing film that starts with the ending and to make it worth watching is much harder in film than on paper.
I:15286;3125;Christopher Nolan succeeds at this daunting task.
I:15286;3126;anne Moss do terrific work.
I:15286;3127;Excuse the play on words but his performance is essential to pulling off the backward plot convention.
I:15286;3128;anne Moss's Natalie is cleverly plotted and the general theme of the film is equally well concieved and developed.
I:15286;3129;The pace is fast and the script tight.
I:15286;3130;exceptional overall filmmaking and acting.
I:15286;3131;ray not very good for special feature.
I:15286;3132;He knows who is and basic tenants of his life, but the day.
I:15286;3133;"The closest comparison would be to ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", but ""Memento"" is better at that game."
I:15286;3134;The story is told in such a unique fashion that it will keep you guessing (but in a good way) until the very end.
I:15286;3135;The acting is also solid and makes you truly care about the 2.3 core characters.
I:15286;3136;perhaps the greatest compliment I can give this film, however, is that it accomplishes the feat of bending the mind yet ultimately creating a remarkably cohesive overall story.
I:15286;3137;I was taken on a psychological adventure and given an ending worthy of the journey.
I:15286;3138;This movie is a total mind trip from start to finish.
I:15286;3139;All the performances are top.
I:15286;3140;For those who haven't seen it yet, I recommend you watch the original movie on disc 1 then watch the chronological version.
I:15286;3141;It could have done better with more screens and more marketing as it has mass appeal.
I:15286;3142;The film is set up in such a way that you are the protagonist suffering from not remembering what happened last.
I:15286;3143;The story is original, engaging and thought provoking.
I:15286;3144;As of this writing, the subject of this review, Memento, is probably the best film of 2001.
I:15286;3145;leonard Shelby has a rare form of short.
I:15286;3146;He writes notes to himself, takes pictures of important people and places, and even tattoos important facts on his body.
I:15286;3147;The possibilities for great suspense and mystery should be obvious from the premise just given.
I:15286;3148;Memento has the perfect concept for a wonderful mystery, and takes advantage of it through the structure, which is unique, engaging, and central to the film's method of bringing the viewer in.
I:15286;3149;One of the important questions for the film would be, How can it tell the story in an interesting way, and at the same time let us in on Leonard Shelby's world?
I:15286;3150;All these questions are solved in one fell swoop with the help of a great, non.
I:15286;3151;the film starts with a memorable image: a Polaroid being developed backwards, eventually being put back into the camera by our protagonist, Leonard Shelby, after he has shot someone.
I:15286;3152;It's a unique, engaging, and important method of storytelling this film employs, and it never gets confusing or unclear for the audience.
I:15286;3153;But in order to capture the essence of Shelby's existence, we have to be given the sensation of suddenly being thrust into a situation without knowing (or in Shelby's case, remembering) what has happened before.
I:15286;3154;That is accomplished through Memento's structure.
I:15286;3155;"It's much more than a gimmick
I:15286;3156;We are constantly kept alert and engaged in what's happening because we are as clueless as Leonard, and simply because the mystery is so great.
I:15286;3157;"His investigation for ""John G,"" the killer, is fascinating and leads to many twists, turns, new alliances, and back."
I:15286;3158;"Just when you think you have it ""figured out"" (if you're foolish enough to really think so) the film takes a turn and opens up whole new possibilities."
I:15286;3159;with the smoothness and grace of a film that knows it has a spectacular script, Memento introduces its various themes seamlessly into the main detective.
I:15286;3160;"What is so immensely enjoyable about watching Memento is that it has so much thematic depth to it
I:15286;3161;Shelby is a living, breathing personification of an intriguing philosophical question: can someone live without memory, by just knowing the facts about a situation and going on them?
I:15286;3162;the acting is, in a word, excellent, with Guy Pearce wrenchingly inhabiting this character.
I:15286;3163;He's able to be charming, clueless, determined, and gruff all simultaneously.
I:15286;3164;It's a quietly intense performance, and the audience feels his pain through it.
I:15286;3165;It is the perfect ending to a perfect movie.
I:15286;3166;it uses a very interesting method for organize the play and even not comfortable for first viewing.
