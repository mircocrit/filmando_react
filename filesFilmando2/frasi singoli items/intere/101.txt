I:9021;1;The story of Frank Serpico, an honest Nyc cop, is one of the most compelling police movies ever made.
I:9021;2;Al Pacino gives the character a lot of class and cool.
I:9021;3;The film does a great job of displaying how the corruption is corrosive and unjust to the people of our country.
I:9021;4;interesting is that this wonderfully directed Sidney Lumet film is really very much like a suspense adventure chase.
I:9021;5;perhaps due to his knowledge of the real Frank Serpico, or maybe a creative choice.
I:9021;6;Serpico, 1973 filmThe opening lists the names of the people who worked on this film, adapted from the Peter Maas book.
I:9021;7;He will be tested as to his character while fighting crime.
I:9021;8;Serpico is taught how the system works while he is on the job.
I:9021;9;"An arrested rapist is encouraged to inform on his playmates
I:9021;10;Serpico joins the Identification Division to advance his career.
I:9021;11;He learns that who you know is important (as in other fields of work).
I:9021;12;the story continues and shows Serpico's experiences at work in New York City.
I:9021;13;The political reality is that the system exists with the knowledge and tolerance of the rulers.
I:9021;14;"[This is another example of the feudal system, as in politics
I:9021;15;i still remember the original movie billboards with that name in 1973, and it's a classic piece of filmmaking.
I:9021;16;Pacino gets completely into the role.
I:9021;17;he becomes Serpico, an honest open.
I:9021;18;finally this is Al Pacino's definitive performance, in my opinion a superior role and film to The Godfather.
I:9021;19;Out of all the performances he did in the 1970s, Al Pacino's amazing, realistic performance in Sidney Lumet's 1973 film SERPICO is by far his most underrated.
I:9021;20;It seems that some have forgotten this film, but luckily I read about it recently and now have discovered how great this movie really is.
I:9021;21;When the original book was published followed by the film version which became SERPICO, it exposed the public to a hidden evil that was lurking right under their noses and how one honest cop tried to change all that for good.
I:9021;22;the film is based on a true story, on the life of Frank Serpico (Pacino).
I:9021;23;When we first see Frank in his younger years, graduating from training, he's an idealistic man who wants to help people.
I:9021;24;It's clear from the start that Serpico is not your average policeman: he is honest, a do.
I:9021;25;gooder, wants to help people, by.
I:9021;26;book, and his facial and top hair are extravagant.
I:9021;27;For all the good he tried to do and for all the effort he tried to do to put an end to rampant corruption, he is constantly spit on for his actions.
I:9021;28;Pacino really gives an effective performance throughout.
I:9021;29;This is a really great showcase for Pacino's talent.
I:9021;30;Sidney Lumet directs the film with gritty expertise.
I:9021;31;part documentary on the making of the film.
I:9021;32;sERPICO is a towering achievement.
I:9021;33;It deserves more credit that it gets.
I:9021;34;Here is a movie that features one of our greatest actors in prime form and a wrenching story told the way the real Frank Serpico would've wanted it: honest.
I:9021;35;This movie has held up well over the years.
I:9021;36;A young Al Pacing is worth watching for the intensity of his acting and a the story is worth watching.
I:9021;37;Unlike more modern movies, the filming is not over done with intense graphics and there is actually good dialog.
I:9021;38;Serpico, directed by Sydney Lumet at the peak of his career, and also launched Al Pacino into a star status.
I:9021;39;Al Pacino's Performance as Serpico is one of the best in his career, he plays it so cool and professional that it's easy to forget that back in 1973 he was still at the beginning of his career.
I:9021;40;He makes character of Frank Serpico unforgettable.
I:9021;41;The film itself is very credible and honest with no clich s that are often appear in this kind of genre.
I:9021;42;New York has got a terrific look here.
I:9021;43;every place in this film whether it's bars or shops or buildings is memorable.
I:9021;44;Overall this makes for a very unique cinematic experience and shouldn't be missed by any movie fan.
I:9021;45;perfect blend of gripping story (based on true event), mesmerizing performances, and skillful yet subtle and minimal directing.
I:9021;46;"Yes, ""Serpico"" is a courageous and heroic figure, but he is also as down to earth as your next door neighbor painting his house."
I:9021;47;This is about a personal struggle, a tough test on a individual's hope, faith, and moral.
I:9021;48;The picture is sharp and clean, though at time the colors may seem muddy.
I:9021;49;The 5.1 Dolby Digital is as good as you could expect from a sound track remastered from it's mono original.
I:9021;50;scenes featurette which reveals more lights from the history, production, and the public reaction upon its release back in 1973.
I:9021;51;Looks like there is hope in America in the justice system.
I:9021;52;The one good copper in New York faces all the injustice of his co. workers.
I:9021;53;the fact that it is a true story makes you wonder how many other cops died or were destroyed by corruption.
I:9021;54;After seeing it though, I must say it was great!
I:9021;55;And I'm damn proud to be a Serpico!
I:9021;56;This is just a great cop movie.
I:9021;57;al Pacino's acting is superb.
I:9021;58;he really should have won the Oscar.
I:9021;59;Serpico really shows you how frusterating it really was for him.
I:9021;60;I reccomend it for anybody who enjoys an excellent movie.
I:9021;61;I just love the story line in this movie.
I:9021;62;Al rocked it period !!
I:9021;63;Serpico is an amazing cop.
I:9021;64;great to know more about the amazing Serpico.
I:9021;65;my husband had to write a paper for school so we bought it and it was really well done.
I:9021;66;anything with Pacino in it is going to be brilliant anyway :0)
I:9021;67;Pacino is at his best here and you really get a feel of NY in this story.
I:9021;68;What I saw of the movie Serpico I liked very much.
I:9021;69;I havent seen a movie like this in quite a while its very entertaining one of Al Pacino's best no doubt about it.
I:9021;70;Viewed: 6/05, 8/11Rate: 96/05: That is a great performance by Al Pacino.
I:9021;71;The story holds up well.
I:9021;72;To watch Serpico is to see the fascination of the development of a character in Al Pacino.
I:9021;73;Also, Serpico is unique in combining authority and sub.
I:9021;74;culture in one person, and it works very well.
I:9021;75;It is interesting to see him grow his beard and hair long while doing his job.
I:9021;76;If you look at the opening credits, especially the cast, you will notice that it only shows Al Pacino's name.
I:9021;77;screen characters I've ever seen.
I:9021;78;The hair, the clothes, the hats, the attitude and the whole get.
I:9021;79;I also love the story, the hopelessness of it all, being defeated by the morass of the system.
I:9021;80;The ending is a classic.
I:9021;81;All in all, Serpico features the finest work in Al Pacino's career.
I:9021;82;The extra half because it's based on a true story and to think of someone having to actually go through all this is insane.
I:9021;83;This was the first time I watched it and I thought it was pretty good.
I:9021;84;I thought Al Pacino's acting was as sharp as it could have been with the arguments he had with his significant others, but still pretty good.
I:9021;85;I read Serpico's bio after seeing the movie and fell that the movie stayed very true to the book.
I:9021;86;It's also great to see Pacino's work before he tried to be too hammy.
I:9021;87;He can convey a lot of emotions in one look and doesn't have to resort to yelling a la Scent of a Woman/And Justice for All.
I:9021;88;What I like about these older movies I've seen lately because of Prime, is that they were primarily character studies.
I:9021;89;But I think Pacino turned in an especially fine performance.
I:9021;90;This film hit home when I first saw it in the theaters.
I:9021;91;A high ranking PD officer made the rounds once a year asking $100 for each apartment building.
I:9021;92;The higher ranking police got a bigger cut than patrol officers.
I:9021;93;Not even realizing the movie was true story I really enjoyed this flick, and when I found out it was a true story it made it even better.
I:9021;94;one of Al Pacinos best movies !!
I:9021;95;Shot on location, this 1973 classic really captures the look of downtown NYC in those days when streets were dirty and most of Manhattan had not been gentrified.
I:9021;96;The score is a bit dated here, but overall this has really stood up well to time.
I:9021;97;realistic feel that so many of the films from that time period had (and as many of Lumet's own films had), yet it never really works.
I:9021;98;"My advice is to see ""Serpico"" for the place it holds in Pacino's career, but then see ""The Insider"" for a suspenseful, terrific movie."
I:9021;99;The team didnt follow his lead and boom face shot!!
I:9021;100;This was an awesome blast from the past movie to watch.
I:9021;101;SERPICO, is one of my favorite movies of all times.
I:9021;102;I love everything about this film especially Al Pacino who gives the performance of a lifetime.
I:9021;103;This film defined the way police corruption is looked upon in the eyes of everyday policemen and it also became one of the first films in the 1970's to explore the antihero in its most complex form.
I:9021;104;A lot of people say that it was The Godfather that Pacino proved that he was a great actor and even though in The Godfather he did an excellent job as Michael Corleone, it was in SERPICO, that I feel he was at his very best.
I:9021;105;He did follow with other great films like DOG DAY AFTERNOON and BOBBY DEERFILED and he was brilliant in both but it was after watching SERPICO for the first time that I became aware of Pacino's brilliant acting talent.
I:9021;106;This film is a MUST if you care about excellence in acting or if you just one to see a great movie.
I:9021;107;I highly recommend the book in which the film is based on it is also excellent.
I:9021;108;Both the film and book are excellent and I highly recommend both, nothing short of brilliant on all counts.
I:9021;109;I love this performance by Al Pacino .
I:9021;110;It is interesting to see how as the movie progresses and things get intense and dangerous for him, Serpico's sense of humor and lighthearted energy is sapped but he holds true to his principles.
I:9021;111;I am grateful that he had the integrity to do so, and that he survived to continue to be an inspiration and a voice for justice in the world.
I:9021;112;Astonishingly great as all Al Pacino moves have the distinction of being.
I:9021;113;We love everything he does and every movie he is in.
I:9021;114;It was so refreshing to see a masterpiece of storytelling transferred to a brilliant film.
I:9021;115;The special features with directors et al was very enlightening into the integrity and balance of the film.
I:9021;116;I never thought about the great acting I kept thinking of them as real people and felt like I was a fly on the wall of this incredible and terrible series of events in the life of Serpico.
I:9021;117;if your not reminded of their acting ability because you are so involved in the story it has to be great.
I:9021;118;pacino was totally believable and authentic in this role and I personally find this my favourite role for him.
I:9021;119;So to wrap up the waffling all I can really say is regardless of the fact this film is 30yrs old (approx), it stands with precious few as remaining a brilliant and topically relevant film.
I:9021;120;I came of age with this movie.
I:9021;121;The book with the same title is more exciting and gripping.
I:9021;122;Good movie, Al Pacino is great.
I:9021;123;Crazy to believe that this is a true story.
I:9021;124;The book is great too
I:9021;125;"I've seen most of this movie and just wanted to ""finish it up"" so to speak."
I:9021;126;It would make a great re.
I:9021;127;make done by a better director.
I:9021;128;Maybe in the 70's this was cutting edge, but I found it as interesting as an episode of Matlock.
I:9021;129;This story was inspired by true events and tells a heroic tale of a police officer who refused to give in to the corrupt practice of taking bribes.
I:9021;130;There's also a great book by the same name, so don't just watch the movie.
I:9021;131;He also has the nicest head of Italian hair I've ever seen.
I:9021;132;He always puts everything into his acting and it shows every time.
I:9021;133;Griping and taut I enjoyed every minuite of it.
I:9021;134;This is a great film, a slow builder but definitely worth the time to see this story unfold.
I:9021;135;the best parts of Serpico do a fine job of portraying the subtle and not.
I:9021;136;subtle pushing and prodding, the hazing that goes underway with cops.
I:9021;137;You can tell that everyone at the studio and behind the scenes played up this angle to the extreme.
I:9021;138;"This is a ""man in the middle"" film that is so enamored with its theme of urban corruption it just never hits its stride."
I:9021;139;I love police movies and this is definitely a classic for anyone who likes police movies.
I:9021;140;"The movie ""Serpico"" is a very fine movie."
I:9021;141;It is important because it demonstrated that Al Pacino could carry a successful film as the star.
I:9021;142;The supporting cast was excellent as well.
I:9021;143;This movie is based on the true life story of a New York City police officer who joined the force as an idealistic young man only to discover that the force was full of corruption.
I:9021;144;This movie is based on a book by Peter Haas and the account is pretty much true to life and not fictionalized.
I:9021;145;The women in his life and his family are pictured and add realism to the story and also are a sounding board to the frustration that he experienced during these years.
I:9021;146;Serpico grew as a person and during the course of the film, Al Pacino shows himself to be a brilliant actor.
I:9021;147;This early film helped set him as a versitile and talented actor.
I:9021;148;This movie was not the first or the last about the issue of corruption in police departments, LA Confidential comes to mind, but it is certainly one of the best.
I:9021;149;It should however, stand the test of time and does show a great actor as he begins towards his greatness.
I:9021;150;I was told this movie is a must see.
I:9021;151;This movie was raw and gritty and was based on a true story.
I:9021;152;It was Al Pacino's first big screen masterpiece of acting.
I:9021;153;The Godfather was really Marlon Brando's showcase vehicle, and The Godfather, Part Two was a year away, while Dog Day Afternoon, also with Lumet, was another year further out.
I:9021;154;Pacino's Frank Serpico covers alot of ground in his time on the force, and the two and a quarter hour film moves so briskly that it seems much longer, but in the good sense.
I:9021;155;As a biopic, it wisely focuses on the meat of the man's public impact, not a cradle to grave psychodrama.
I:9021;156;all because he's decent and ethical.
I:9021;157;Sidney Lumet had a perfect grasp of the streets and the times in this film, and the old clich s about them not making films like this any more is true.
I:9021;158;And few independent films can afford the budget and time needed to craft so meticulous a work.
I:9021;159;Yet, films like this, Dog Day Afternoon, The French Connection, The Conversation, Taxi Driver, All The President's Men, Apocalypse Now, and the like, still tug at the American psyche.
I:9021;160;'Serpico' is a definitive Pacino classic, with all the right stuff to keep you riveted!
I:9021;161;The acting is killer, and dialogue top notch.
I:9021;162;Albeit now a bit dated as far as the film's scenery and dress goes, it still timelessly captures the essence of the NYPD back in the 60's and early 70's.
I:9021;163;That said, most police officers are commendable, honest, caring people that perform their duties very well, and proudly so.
I:9021;164;This is, in my opinion, one of Al Pacino's finest moments and the direction by Sidney Lumet was brilliant!
I:9021;165;One of the best films of the 70's, and a 'must see'.
I:9021;166;"The name of Pacino's character, ""Serpico,"" has become synonymous with ""honest cop."""
I:9021;167;It demonstrates what a strong impact this movie had on millions of people.
I:9021;168;The long hair, wild clothes, beads, etc. really date this film, too, it being so early '70s in looks.
I:9021;169;"He's been a ""star"" ever since."
I:9021;170;"day film classics, ""Serpico"" is one of them."
I:9021;171;Its great to see Al in some early work this was my main reason for picking this film.
I:9021;172;with Al Pacino early in his career giving a performance all he's got.
I:9021;173;SERPICO is a classic of 1970s cinema and of Lumet's film catalog.
I:9021;174;Watching SERPICO is like taking a big breath of fresh air.
I:9021;175;I love returning to the realism of the 1970s.
I:9021;176;Lumet's camera always seems to cut right through all of the muck, casting a bright light on his character's lives, situations, and surroundings.
I:9021;177;SERPICO is the true story of a virtuous cop in a corrupt system.
I:9021;178;A veteran of the plain clothes unit, Frank Serpico (Al Pacino) lives and breathes the streets of New York.
I:9021;179;pacino is at the top of his art form: he lives and breathes this cop.
I:9021;180;While Serpico lives in an idealistic world in which the cops are cleaning up the streets and making New York a safer place to live, the other cops are merely using the force to make a very good living.
I:9021;181;SERPICO works because it traps our character.
I:9021;182;He has always wanted to be a cop.
I:9021;183;What is ironic is that in a world of drugs, murder, and money, Serpico's greatest enemies are his fellow police officers.
I:9021;184;It is inspiring to watch a man whose character is so unquestionable that you feel bad for your own inadequacies and failings.
I:9021;185;Al Pacino is a short man, but one won't recognize that because he gives such awesome performances.
I:9021;186;Oh well, one can't expect brilliancy at every turn.
I:9021;187;the other star of the film is the director, Sidney Lumet, who is one of the most underrated directors I know of.
I:9021;188;Lumet films are always set in New York and always involve tough characters.
I:9021;189;Although he uses limited ideas and settings, his films are always good.
I:9021;190;This is perhaps Sidney Lumet's finest film and undoubtedly one of Al Pacino's finest performances.
I:9021;191;in fact, on the basis of this film and the first two Godfathers, one could make a case for Pacino as the greatest American actor.
I:9021;192;His work in Serpico is full of the beauty and rage of classic poetry.
I:9021;193;smart, bordering on documentary style at times, absolutely riveting from the first image of a gravely wounded Serpico to the last shot of Serpico with his dog, all alone in the world with his integrity.
I:9021;194;Lumet also manages to bring in humorous scenes, such as the one in which Serpico and other cops try marijuana and get the munchies.
I:9021;195;Lumet is an actor's director and lets his cast establish the momentum of the film.
I:9021;196;the supporting cast is uniformly impressive, with Tony Roberts as an interesting foil for Serpico and a host of solid character actors playing various cops who are hostile to or just plain weirded out by Serpico.
I:9021;197;He does have an interesting website and is very much alive and well, in spite of all the tragedy he has faced.
I:9021;198;"actually, this movie shows that there are 2 ""real Frank Serpicos,"" and one of them was Al Pacino in 1973."
I:9021;199;In any event, Serpico is a great 70s film, a great police film, and a document of the genius of Al Pacino.
I:9021;200;Young Pacino is great in this real life movie about corruption and the cops who take money.
I:9021;201;It keeps you on edge watching.
I:9021;202;Having read the book and watched the movie at least twenty times in the last ten years, I can honestly say that this is the story of truth.
I:9021;203;truth about what honest cops are sometimes faced with.
I:9021;204;recruits it all begins with ethics.
I:9021;205;This is the story of numerous ethical, honest and professional men, yet sadly it is also about crooked cops and, the movie leads the viewer to believe there are more crooked cops than honest ones.
I:9021;206;the story is 100% true which makes it even more fascinating.
I:9021;207;Mainly liked this movie for capturing the grittiness of NY in the 70's.
I:9021;208;Acting was pretty good overall and it highlighted some interesting dilemmas when it comes to plain.
I:9021;209;We really enjoyed this movie, and seeing Al Pacino so young.
I:9021;210;Highly recommended for old movie buffs!
I:9021;211;Serpico is a chilling scene at the world,and how it use to be.
I:9021;212;Also Al Pacino is great as always the man can act no wrong.
I:9021;213;All in all the movie is great and Al Pacino is even greater.
I:9021;214;I've read a lot of books since then, and yet I remember Frank Serpico.
I:9021;215;It's an important story .
I:9021;216;He's been one of our greatest actors for over 30 years, familiar to us all.
I:9021;217;"and yet, when I watched Al Pacino in ""Serpico,"" he was so convincing ."
I:9021;218;That's the highest praise I can give an actor.
I:9021;219;This movie really captures the times of it's subject.
I:9021;220;This movie works both as a showcase of the talent of an early Al Pacino and as protrayal of a true American hero, Frank Serpico.
I:9021;221;Both men are well served by this film, as is the viewer.
I:9021;222;Yeah, he's been in numerous movies ever since the early 70's, and I'm sure you recognize at least his face.
I:9021;223;But in case you haven't noticed, Al Pacino is undoubtedly one of the greatest actors of 20th.
I:9021;224;In fact, he's one of my favorite actors of all time, and there's a very good reason for it: this guy can really act.
I:9021;225;He's been parodied several times on film and on TV, but that's because everyone knows how good he is.
I:9021;226;From The Godfather trilogy to Insomnia, his performances are MORE then just solid gold.
I:9021;227;Serpico is based on the real.
I:9021;228;What really matters is how mesmerizing this movie is.
I:9021;229;directed tour de force that showcases not only Pacino's spectacular acting talents, but also gives us an incredibly solid character study of the man who would become famous in police departments everywhere.
I:9021;230;I must say that Pacino plays the part perfectly, of course.
I:9021;231;The appearance, the mannerisms, and the ANGER of Frank Serpico are shown with real strength and heart.
I:9021;232;This is one of his greatest roles.
I:9021;233;aside from the fact that this movie showcases young Pacino at his best, the movie is photographed beautifully and written extraordinarily well.
I:9021;234;top action and suspense and delivers with a slow and steady pace, which I think is really appropriate for this kind of film.
I:9021;235;The music by Mikis Theodorakis is a pleasure to listen to (except during one specific sequence, in which the music sounds as cheesy as the theme for a 70's cop show).
I:9021;236;It has quickly become one of my favorite films of all time.
I:9021;237;In conclusion, this is a great movie, and if you're a fan of Pacino, then you have to see this film.
I:9021;238;What greater compliment could I pay?Assuming that the real Frank Serpico was accurately depicted, my estimation of that man has, if anything, doubled as a result of my years as a cop, trying in my own way to follow in those grand footsteps.
I:9021;239;Pacino simply nails the walking.
I:9021;240;The perfectly realised portrayal of the concommitant self.
I:9021;241;A young and brilliant Pacino at his stone.
I:9021;242;best before he started caricaturising himself.
I:9021;243;If you love Lumets directing, please seek out the hidden gem Lovin' Molly from about circa 1974 starring Blythe Danner, Anthony Hopkins and Beau Bridges.
I:9021;244;(The score and cinematography are also excellent.
I:9021;245;I like true stories that are accurate.
I:9021;246;Al Pacino was great playing the part.
I:9021;247;Serpico is quite a gripping movie.
I:9021;248;the plot of the story has several intriguing twists and turns that manage to keep the viewers hooked in spite of a sometimes sluggish pace.
I:9021;249;Its interesting to note how Pacino(Serpico)gives such a haggard appearance as a police officer/detective.
I:9021;250;like the title of my review states, this is a fascinating character study as well as a gripping story.
I:9021;251;I remember seeing this movie for the first time on TV when it was new.
I:9021;252;I liked it because it reminded me of when my uncle first became a cop in New York City.
I:9021;253;I really liked the story as I'm sure Al Pacino made the story more lively than it originally was.
I:9021;254;A great movie to see to remind you of how it was to be a cop back when times were really tough.
I:9021;255;Mention 1970's cinema and SERPICO is one of the first 5 films that comes to mind.
I:9021;256;This was the first Pacino tour de force in a film that has staying power through today.
I:9021;257;i always said that had it been released a year later it would have garnered more than the 2 Oscar nominations it did (Pacino as Best Actor and Best Screenplay.
I:9021;258;The film is true to the best seller by Peter Maas and accurately follows the actual record of events (The Whitman Knapp Crime Commission, Serpico's tours of duty with the NYPD)without adding any fluff.
I:9021;259;The secondary performances are outstanding, with John Randolph spectacular as Sidney Green, Tony Roberts rock solid as Bob Blair and the drop dead gorgeous Cornelia Sharpe (where is she these days).
I:9021;260;Serpico is based on the real.
I:9021;261;al Pacino's performance, in only his second feature to receive top billing, contributes quite well to an argument that Pacino is one of the truly great actors of our time.
I:9021;262;I would encourage film lovers to really dig into the Pacino catalog to share in my appreciation!Despite Serpico seeming to be a one man show by Pacino, there are also strong performances in key supporting roles, including Cornelia Sharpe as a free spirited girlfriend who helps Serpico develop his undercover self, Barbara Eda.Young as the love of his life who leaves him out of frustration for having to share in his sufferings, and the great but under.
I:9021;263;Like many great actors, Pacino is always Pacino.
I:9021;264;It's a movie worth watching carefully.
I:9021;265;A classic early Pacino film with excellent sets and props .
I:9021;266;well done and probably could not be made again with such attention to detail.
I:9021;267;True story made it even more compelling, and Pacino was well cast for the lead role.
I:9021;268;"I've always said in my personal meetings with coleagues and friends that Pacino is much more than an actor 
I:9021;269;This movie not only remains as cult movie and one of the most`powerful works of this tireless film maker as Sidney Lumet was in that age.
I:9021;270;Serpico meant a breakthrough with the ancient patterns of good citizen and virtuosi cop.
I:9021;271;"serpico is a simple inmigrant citizen who lives in a little department 
I:9021;272;"In this sense he's naif 
I:9021;273;"this film is part of the amazing sextet together with Twelve angry men, The pawnbroker , The offence , Network and Equus 
I:9021;274;An American Classic based from A True Story.
I:9021;275;Also based from a true story.
I:9021;276;If you did then Serpico is right up your alley!
I:9021;277;I've seen this movie many time over the years and always enjoy Al Pacino's 'honest cop in a crooked police force' portrayal.
I:9021;278;After years of having to live with the previous VHS release, with its sides cropped and its colors faded, I was more than pleased to finally see Serpico as originally intended, in widescreen, and gorgeous Technicolor.
I:9021;279;release, and it's worth every cent.
I:9021;280;sidney Lumet is often thought of as an actors' director, more so than a cinematic genius, but Serpico more than delivers in both arenas.
I:9021;281;Al Pacino's portrayal of the eccentric Frank Serpico .
I:9021;282;a NYPD cop of unyielding integrity .
I:9021;283;is one of his best roles ever.
I:9021;284;He's animated, tough and very human in his role, and one can sense that a lot of the real Serpico rubbed off on him.
I:9021;285;Serpico also boasts an excellent supporting cast.
I:9021;286;known from his roles in Woody Allen movies, take a look at these then.
I:9021;287;"handedly, took a stand against the enormous corruption within the NYPD, and paid for it dearly, is still fascinating and still relevant
I:9021;288;the classic Dog Day Afternoon (also based on a true story, but with a bit more liberties taken) .
I:9021;289;but it rises entirely thanks to Pacino, who turned Serpico into a universal icon of integrity and idealism, with his beard, long hair and penetrating stare, as a hero who fights within the establishment and against it.
I:9021;290;along with The Godfather saga and Dog Day Afternoon this is one of Pacino's greatest performances, and one that earned him an Oscar nomination, and helped make him one of the prominent American actors of the 70's, alongside the likes of Robert De Niro, Jack Nicholson and Dustin Hoffman.
I:9021;291;"time essential classics
I:9021;292;This is a good movie, but not Pacino's best.
I:9021;293;This is based on a true story, and you really get an idea of how corrupted the police force once was.
I:9021;294;I am a big Pacino fan and he plays the straight cop who will not be a cop on the take and he plays the part very well!
I:9021;295;One of the best dirty cop movies ever made.
I:9021;296;Being based on a true story makes it even better.
I:9021;297;Enjoyed it as much today as when it first came out.
I:9021;298;This great little low budget gem from 1973 is one of Sidney Lumet's best films,and one of Pacino's best performances!!!
I:9021;299;The other great character actors(Jack Kehoe,M. emmett Walsh,Alan Rich and so on) also are in great form!!!
I:9021;300;One of the best films of the 70's!!!
I:9021;301;And if you love cop movies,than this one is a must see!!!
I:9021;302;Pacino did a fantastic job portraying Serpico, who selflessly struggled to reform and clean.
I:9021;303;A terrific expose of a dark, dark period in NYPD's history, and even more incredible given that the movie was made on a year or so after the events took place, when the force wasn't yet purged of the corruption.
I:9021;304;It turned a good movie into a great one.
I:9021;305;The movie is a bit dated, but it is still a classic.
I:9021;306;You can see that a young Pacino was going to have great career.
I:9021;307;It's fun to watch actors performing in their young, beautiful years who've since achieved the pinnacle.
I:9021;308;from the first frame of the film one can see what is coming.
I:9021;309;Naturally he believes that taking it to an authority figure in the department will start some kind of investigation.
I:9021;310;in the tradition of the saints, he remains joyful and full of life despite his untenable situation.
I:9021;311;Girlfriend after girlfriend come and go, at first enjoying his joie de la vivre and then being overwhelmed by his moods of agitation and fury at the corruption surrounding him.
I:9021;312;Pacino does all this with his trademark intensity: perhaps the best scene in the film, also taken from the book, is when he humiliates a mobster who he arrests on the street for running numbers and who is a good buddy of all the men he works with.
I:9021;313;His best friend, a more formal but equally just cop (Bob Blair played by Tony Roberts in an understated, realistic performance) uses all the connections he has to get Serpico a hearing on police corruption.
I:9021;314;The might of one strong, good man truly cannot be nailed down by a thousand weak corrupt ones.
I:9021;315;Great true life story about an Honest Cop who had to take on the whole NYPD police department and their corrupt Supervisors.
I:9021;316;Definitely worth seeing and a great read in book form too.
I:9021;317;Nothing is so potent as the truth.
I:9021;318;One of Pacino's best early roles.
I:9021;319;true life event that inspired a nation to crack down on poice corruption.
I:9021;320;What Al Pacino does in this movie as in any other is great, Serpico while looking like some smelly hippie is one cool cat minus the ballet,he's a good cop in a force full of dirty ones.
I:9021;321;I love this movie,time to bust criminals!
I:9021;322;Love Pacino, one of the greatest actors of the 20th century.
I:9021;323;This film is a drama, character study, thriller, among other things.
I:9021;324;It is a tour de force, near magna cumme laude.
I:9021;325;I enjoyed the brilliant acting of the sometimes, slightly, overrated Al Pacino.
I:9021;326;He is in top form here, rarely ever overacting, or letting down the character.
I:9021;327;"He really does a superb job
I:9021;328;because life itself is a very complex thing, it is all the more astonishing that they managed to pull this off so well.
I:9021;329;Typically, film makers/Hollywood have a tough time with recreating true.
I:9021;330;That is why this film is so impressive.
I:9021;331;another reason why this film is so successful is, simply, the courageous story.
I:9021;332;written movie that takes great pains to study character.
I:9021;333;it is pretty simple, really.
I:9021;334;"A great story that pays homage to its own material
I:9021;335;Serpico is a pure classic Al Pacino at his best the setting N.Y early 70's plus a young Al Pacino can't ever be remake love this movie again pure classic!!!!!
I:9021;336;In my top 50 of the best movies made!
I:9021;337;This movie is still interesting even after all these years.
I:9021;338;Movie was a little slow but Pacino is amazing in this role.
I:9021;339;The technicolor process really gave this movie a realistic mood.
I:9021;340;Loved this movie years ago and decided to see it again.
I:9021;341;Al Pacino is the best and deserves accolades for being the most talented actor around then and now.
I:9021;342;Based on the biography SERPICO by Peter Maas, Producer Martin Stegman and Director Sidney Lumet capture perfectly the gritty realities of Frank Serpico's tenure with New York's Finest, when for a time it seemed that Serpico was alone in his refusal to take graft and his resistance to the system that allowed it to flourish.
I:9021;343;"in"" party scene beautifully foreshadows Pacino's performance as SCARFACE Tony Montana in the Club Babylon ten years later, and Pacino's depiction of Serpico's assumption of disguises (as a junkie, a deliveryman, and a Hasidic rabbi) are moments of humor in what is overall a rather grim biopic."
I:9021;344;Serpico is one of the best movies Al Pacino made!
I:9021;345;He is so real and you feel his frustration.
I:9021;346;The movie was great also a classic, Al Pacino is one of my favorites is a great actor Amazon yah did it again thank you
I:9021;347;This is one of the finest movies from the 70's He played a important role at that time, ny finest.
I:9021;348;great on location scenes of 1970s NYC.
I:9021;349;top Pacino is very good in the crooked cops story.
I:9021;350;His performance is in sharp contrast to his later style which often mistakes shouting for drama.
I:9021;351;Ok, so I'm not the brightest of people but I am good with my films.
I:9021;352;Francisco Serpico was an honest Italian cop .
I:9021;353;"Because of his dedication to honest police work and a burning desire to ""do the right thing"" Serpico goes from a non."
I:9021;354;participant in the graft to actively fighting it.
I:9021;355;The right time never arrives and Serpico, prodded by his friend Bob Blair (played by Tony Roberts), brings his complaints outside of the department .
I:9021;356;"Certainly the ""extra"" money that they received was tempting ."
I:9021;357;"serpico is one of the most visible examples of someone ""doing the right thing"" against incredible odds, even as his life was threatened."
I:9021;358;This is a good story that needs to be told and Sidney Lumet and Al Pacino tell it well.
I:9021;359;I watched this movie years ago, now our grandson is going to be a police officer, so this was a good movie and they said they liked it also when they watched it.
I:9021;360;pacino is fantastic as serpico.
I:9021;361;Very good depiction of crime.
I:9021;362;I enjoyed being able to watch this at home and share this with others.
I:9021;363;i was fooled by the posiitve reviews in here, and i thought a movie with Pacino must be as good as these reviews, well, its not.
I:9021;364;i can understand that people who saw it back then (70s) must've found it a great movie, and im sure it was.
I:9021;365;Awesome movie Al pacino at his best movie blew me away really enjoyed it hope this helps you on deciding to watch
I:9021;366;The movie Serpico was one of the finest roles Al Pacino hasever done.
I:9021;367;the acting by Pacino rivals the roles that he played on the Godfather.
I:9021;368;This is a must see film.
I:9021;369;Al Pacino in one of his many Oscar nominated performances, inhabits the role of Serpico with vibrant purpose and brings home the desperate plight of an honest cop amid such corruption.
I:9021;370;making schemes of the dishonest cops and has the courage to stand for true justice, even risking his relationships and life.
I:9021;371;Many such crime stories that surfaced later all felt the impact of this dynamic movie and it still stands today as an important piece of cinematic excellence.
I:9021;372;My wife and I enjoyed the movie.
I:9021;373;It was nice to see how Internal Investigations got it's start, although from what I understand by way of a cop friend of mine, it is still necessary.
I:9021;374;I must admit the dancing at the party was a real treat!
I:9021;375;good plot and based on a true story, however it was slow moving and not written well.
I:9021;376;Serpico is a movie that is worth seeing for Al Pacino fans.
I:9021;377;He puts on a great performance.
I:9021;378;This movie strives to stay true to its biographical source, which means there are dozens of characters and events that unfold that don't seem to flow together.
I:9021;379;I'm glad I saw it and I would recommend it to Pacino fans.
I:9021;380;"the acting and movie pace are perfect,,,this could be Al Pucino's ""best"" film, even better than Godfather III."
I:9021;381;the sound score by Mikis Theodorakis was absolutely the best and well suited to this film.
I:9021;382;I had to hit pause a couple of times during the movie to truly appreciate the goodness.
I:9021;383;The two go hand in hand to produce a classic that I should have seen a while ago.
I:9021;384;The story is in the grand tradition of French Connection but much better (at least I think so).
I:9021;385;The performance delivered by Al Pacino is, of course, superb.
I:9021;386;Al Pacino's performance as idealistic New York cop Frank Serpico not only ranks as one of the great actor's definitive performances, but the film itself is one of the defining films of the 70's.
I:9021;387;Though he was robbed of an Oscar for Best Actor, Pacino is unbelievably brilliant as he displays all the strengths and vulnerabilities of the title character.
I:9021;388;His performance alone makes Serpico one of the finest crime/cop films of the 20th century, and is worth the price of admission alone.
I:9021;389;Honesty in that profession is refreshing, but you also pay a very high price for your honesty.
I:9021;390;this movie is really entertaining because of how real it feels.
I:9021;391;names and the scenary is very raw and all shot on location.
I:9021;392;outs or truly heroic moments that so many other cop films depict.
I:9021;393;al Pacino's performance in this film is fabulous and is very convincing.
I:9021;394;this is a really entertaining movie about a man who believed in his ideals of honesty, dignity and trust and is inspirational in the sense that it makes the viewer want to act on their ideals in the same way.
I:9021;395;An interesting look at corruption in the NYC police department.
I:9021;396;This movie is based on a real life hero who still resides in upstate New York and lectures about his life experiences.
I:9021;397;this is one of the best ones!
I:9021;398;The Godfather may have alerted us to the great actor Al Pacino but that classic first instalment of the trilogy was really Marlon Brando's movie.
I:9021;399;This true story of an NYPD cop standing alone in the midst of corruption on a staggering scale, is both compelling and engaging.
I:9021;400;school New York movies anyway (made back when cars still had yellow licence plates) and even the music, by Mikis Theodorakis and arranged and conducted by jazz legend Bob James, was brilliant.
I:9021;401;Supporting cast give great performances, especially Barbara Edna.Young as Serpico's long.
I:9021;402;this is a must for any Pacino fan or any lover of classic movies.
I:9021;403;Fantastic film with Al Pacino in the title role playing Frank Serpico, a real.
I:9021;404;life NYPD detective whose integrity nearly cost him his life (by disgruntled co. workers) and definitely cost him his career.
I:9021;405;Pacino is amazing in this.
I:9021;406;Serpico is such a movie.
I:9021;407;I've always enjoyed Al Pacino's acting abilities in whaever movie he's been in that I've seen.
I:9021;408;It takes a man of incredible courage to determine to remain honest in the face of the terrible temptations to do otherwise.
I:9021;409;Great acting by Al Pacino, and an inspiring, if somewhat depressing story.
I:9021;410;Al Pacino became a star thanks to his role as Michael Corleone in The Godfather.
I:9021;411;The film that cemented Mr. Pacino as one of the best actors of his generation was Serpico.
I:9021;412;Mr. Pacino brings a realistic approach to the role and you feel sympathy for Serpico.
I:9021;413;The movies were replete with new themes, reflective of the times, (the end of the 1960's) and it was interesting to see the images from 40 years ago.
I:9021;414;Serpico is a perfect blend of fine acting, great story, and thoughtful direction.
I:9021;415;One of the best movies from the 1970s, it shows you don't need car chases and special effects to make an exciting film.
I:9021;416;al Pacino does a terrific job of bringing the character of Serpico to the screen.
I:9021;417;The way the whole story is woven makes for an interesting movie but it is the acting that raises the level even higher.
I:9021;418;There is a romantic and social side of Serpico.
I:9021;419;I hope so because it is an excellent movie.
I:9021;420;Just when I thought The Godfather was Pacinos best performance.
I:9021;421;Better than almost every movie that comes out these days but beat the heroes integrity and the corruption of the police force over the viewers head.
I:9021;422;I really appreciated the excellent directing and the excellent performance by Al Pacino.
I:9021;423;The pressure he was under was tremendous.
I:9021;424;As some others have said, it WAS a real.
I:9021;425;I liked the part when he first met the bag.
I:9021;426;But I still loved the time capsule effect of seeing NYC back then, and also the close.
I:9021;427;"spirit girlfriend ended up being ""traditional"" after all."
I:9021;428;Fantastic drama, superb acting, great rhythm.
I:9021;429;be it as it is, enjoy the movie, guys!
I:9021;430;Great storyline coupled with the usual terrific acting.
I:9021;431;The great part of this storyline is the majority was based on true happenings throughout the municipal police department of New York City.
I:9021;432;In my opinion this is one of the best films ever, and Al Pacino gives as masterful a performance as any he has ever done.
I:9021;433;The fact this is based on a true story makes it that much more memorable.
I:9021;434;We also see a scary lesson of what happens when one honest man takes on an entire bureaucracy that does not welcome him and what can ultimately happen to him.
I:9021;435;A powerful film that is just as relevant today as when it was made.
I:9021;436;the supporting cast is excellent as well, with so many guys playing tough ,jaded NYC cops from the era.
I:9021;437;i guess the definition of a classic is a movie that represents it's era and yet can be viewed and enjoyed years later.
I:9021;438;Serpico certainly meets that criteria.
I:9021;439;There are some movies that everyone should see in their lifetime, and this movie is one of them.
I:9021;440;It got great acting throughout with lots of excitement, and it's based on a true story.
I:9021;441;I loved his idealistic idea of how the police should be.
I:9021;442;Serpico is an indispensable product of that period, and if you haven't seen this yet, you won't get a chance to find out why Al Pacino is one of our most interesting actors.
I:9021;443;When the movie makes you want to read the book immediately after viewing, you know you've come across something special.
I:9021;444;Al Pacino is great in this movie.
I:9021;445;This should be required viewing for high school students.
I:9021;446;"Based on a true story, Frank Serpico, beautifully portrayed by Al Pacino (better than he was in his Academy Award winning performance in ""Scent of a Woman""), is an honest, ethical police officer."
I:9021;447;"But, Serpico keeps saying ""No"" to them, which is a wise thing to do."
I:9021;448;As a criminal justice and law student with many friends in law enforcement, and some of them with the NYPD, I found this movie amazing.
I:9021;449;It was pretty realistic, and kept with what really happened in real life pretty well.
I:9021;450;Besides that, it was a great movie, and it's one of the movies I own that I'll definitely be watching more than once.
I:9021;451;Well told story and well acted too.
I:9021;452;Really gives you a feel of what late 60's early 70's NYC police life was like.
I:9021;453;Really have always loved your work and this is one of the best.
I:9021;454;Very interesting story and wonderful cast, enjoy it everytime i watch it!
I:9021;455;great actor in a great movie.
I:9021;456;Movies intense and balanced, where an honest person, unfortunately, turns into a martyr embittered by events.
I:9021;457;Al Pacino's first real stand alone work away fromThe Godfather Saga is an excellent piece of work about a real life cop who just wanted to be an honest cop.
I:9021;458;Great movie to watch when you are bored, trying to kill time, and have popcorn!
I:9021;459;Coming out right after the Godfather, this is the film that was all about Al, though the Godfather is a timeless classic it is often looked at as Brando's movie, while Serpico gave Al the chance to shine and demonstrate just how talented he was as a lead actor.
I:9021;460;The script is a fantastic adaptation of the book of the same name and Sidney Lumet does an incredible job, proving himself as one of those great directors that continues to do brilliant work throughout multiple decades.
I:9021;461;It is a moving character study that can only be accomplished this well by an actor with incredible talent.
I:9021;462;Classic 70's cinema from a legendary actor and director.
I:9021;463;Pacino does a great job portraying this true story character.
I:9021;464;I'm sure there were creative liberties taken during the production, but its a great glimpse into the past, and a corrupted police force in NYC.
I:9021;465;Sidney Lumet, whose other big hit with Pacino was Dog Day AfternoonDog Day Afternoon (Two.
I:9021;466;disc Special Edition), had a good eye for keeping it real in a time when most movies were usually overly melodramatic.
I:9021;467;"serpico still had its 70s era movie making quirks, but overall it was ahead of its time for making you feel ""truly involved"" with its characters."
I:9021;468;And having a young, talented Al Pacino in the cast (as the lead) certainly helped make an award.
I:9021;469;Serpico is based on the real.
I:9021;470;the movie gets a bit long in the badge by the final 30 minutes, but the suspense of seeing if/how Frank Serpico collars his peers keeps you interested.
I:9021;471;Interesting piece of history for one of those evenings that your queue is light on the new.
I:9021;472;Pacino is at the top of his game in Serpico.
I:9021;473;He brings a level of passion to this role that you can feel through the screen.
I:9021;474;This is the Pacino that created the legend.
I:9021;475;Here it's the New York City police, and you can see how Peter Maas's book on the real Serpico must have appealed to him.
I:9021;476;But his way into such stories is through character, and Al Pacino gives us a here a stubborn, honest, not.
I:9021;477;likable man who simply can't stand it that so many police are on the take .
I:9021;478;Lumet also knows that you can't treat serious, systemic corruption .
I:9021;479;"corruption that goes ""right to the top"" of an organization ."
I:9021;480;and end a narrative with a sentimental kiss.
I:9021;481;"the supporting cast of largely unheralded actors is excellent, and Pacino (in 1973 just a year out from ""Godfather"" Part 1) gives a performance of great intensity that nevertheless is not all about chewing the scenery ."
I:9021;482;"Given that Serpico, as an undercover cop, is often himself ""acting,"" the focus and discipline of Pacino's attention to the character is impressive."
I:9021;483;For me it's a great American movie.
I:9021;484;Anything Pacino does is going to be outstanding!
I:9021;485;He's one of the best actors and one of my favorites certainly.
I:9021;486;I enjoyed it, perhaps just as much as Prince of the City.
I:9021;487;thanks for the quick delivery service.
I:9021;488;A good flick based on a real cop.
I:9021;489;Al Pacino does a great job, but when doesn't he?
I:9021;490;He is one of my all time great actors and he really reached the top of his pinnacle as the gruby (honest)cop in NY.
I:9021;491;This is a must for all Pacino fans this is one of his earlier films and it is a true story about kind of a hippy under cover cop and all the situations that he goes through being undercover and how he might possibly be the one good cop that doesnt take bribes and trying to avoid becoming a crooked copHighly Recomended
I:9021;492;"But for me, the cream of Pacino's crop was in the 1970s, and among his great performances in that decade was in the 1973 movie ""Serpico."""
I:9021;493;"In this feature directed by Sidney Lumet (who also directed another Pacino film, 1975's ""Dog Day Afternoon""), Al plays a cop who joins the force with the best of intentions."
I:9021;494;He's honest, sincere, and treats criminal suspects impartially.
I:9021;495;qualities that should enable an officer to advance in his field.
I:9021;496;Frank's job ultimately takes a toll on his life, both professionally and romantically, and by the end of the movie, he's transformed from an eager.
I:9021;497;please cop to a jaded officer.
I:9021;498;"I'd hesitate to call ""Serpico"" a classic, but it's a fine and gritty drama that has an award."
I:9021;499;Started to collect Al Pacino movies.
I:9021;500;Al Pacino shows why he is one of the greatest of all time!
I:9021;501;A good film, with the great story outshining the movie's good production.
I:9021;502;A great reminder of the benefits of transparency in public systems.
I:9021;503;Great cinema in more subtle times, less cgi and more story
I:9021;504;Even it's an older movie , it's still a good movie to watch
I:9021;505;The lone good cop in a sea of corruption.
I:9021;506;The best part is that this is a true story.
I:9021;507;I had a lone good cop in my life once, so it's a role that I sympathize with.
I:9021;508;watching the cops dial on rotary phones was great!
I:9021;509;Al Pacino is at his best, protraying Frank Serpico and brings him to life on the screen.
I:9021;510;A must watch if you are a Pacino fan or are interested in learning a bit about Frank Serpico.
I:9021;511;prompt and courteous service, product arrived on time and in good condition as promised.
I:9021;512;"the cosmos galaxies and the universe will be open to valuable people to exploit and use the substance matter universe to create the ""happiness"" the only real emotion that can be obtained by value producers."
I:9021;513;Without those brave and courages creator.
I:9021;514;This is a great movie with some great acting.
I:9021;515;really takes you back into life in New York in the 70's.
I:9021;516;pacino was fantastic and you knew he was on his way to becoming a star.
I:9021;517;"Good crime drama
I:9021;518;The one outstanding experience I had whilst watching was the perfectly formed sense of time and place.
I:9021;519;The pealing paint on office walls, the colour in the clothes but most of all those wonderful old, old cars.
I:9021;520;I really enjoyed reading about what it takes to win an Oscar.
I:9021;521;So take a trip back to the early seventies.
I:9021;522;Al Pacino is amazing in this classic movie.
I:9021;523;Highly recommend seeing it if you haven't already.
I:9021;524;And if you have, see it again!
I:9021;525;Great story, amazing cast and it was all filmed in NYC.
I:9021;526;If you ever need ideas for costumes on holloween then this movie will give you plenty of inspiration.
I:9021;527;Sidney Lument made a brilliant move choosing to direct Serpico.
I:9021;528;This is the film that put Al Pacino on the map.
I:9021;529;with realistic acting and realistic actors .
I:9021;530;Serpico has a gritty realistic feel that makes the story stand out even more than it would have otherwise.
I:9021;531;Al Pacino showcases his acting technique in the portrayal of a beleaguered New York cop who just wants to do his job.
I:9021;532;When he finds himself amidst high levels of corruption and money payoffs, he sets out to make it right.
I:9021;533;time has been good to this film and it still shines over 30 years later as a superb police film and real.
I:9021;534;This is an excellent movie with Al Pacino at his best.
