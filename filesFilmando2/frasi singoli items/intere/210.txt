I:11682;1;That said, the film is one of the most complete films I've ever seen, maybe THE most complete.
I:11682;2;This is far from a visually overwhelming spectacle in the vein of Hollywood epics but is stylized in that it is a visually stunning recreation of a time and place.
I:11682;3;it is authentic in every sense of the word.
I:11682;4;in Haynes' telling of the tragic tale of the Whitaker family, the 50's are brought to roaring life, albeit a quiet roar.
I:11682;5;cathy and Frank Whitaker have a seemingly perfect life.
I:11682;6;He is likable and respected and loving.
I:11682;7;What seems so lovely on the surface is about to come to a crashing halt when Frank's secret life (involving men) is uncovered and Cathy is presented with a troubling choice.
I:11682;8;As she struggles to accept (and change) her husband she strikes up a friendship with Raymond, an African American gardener who comforts her and makes her feel a warmth her husband has stolen from her.
I:11682;9;haynes brilliantly captures a society that doesn't quite know how to accept what it cannot bring itself to understand.
I:11682;10;the film is propelled forward by some brilliant performances, especially from Quaid and Moore.
I:11682;11;julianne Moore is often toted as the rightful owner of the 2002 Lead Actress Oscar.
I:11682;12;For me, 2002 is all about Diane Lane, but Julianne Moore is absolutely stunning as Cathy, a true revelation.
I:11682;13;Her style of acting lends itself perfectly to this type of film.
I:11682;14;I have always said that Moore is a very mannered actress.
I:11682;15;"She is mesmerizing as she attempts to make her voice heard without overstepping her boundaries
I:11682;16;His riveting portrayal of a man condemned by his own emotions is just stunning to watch.
I:11682;17;Some have complained that he never really allows us to see why he was such a well loved man to begin with, but the film really uses his character to point out the major flaws in society at that time.
I:11682;18;He had wealth, charm and intellect.
I:11682;19;Quaid is just extremely captivating, moving and so invested in this performance that one nearly quivers as he delivers his heartbroken lines.
I:11682;20;his final decision is gut wrenching for so many reasons.
I:11682;21;the supporting cast (Quaid is supporting as well, since this is Cathy's story through and through) is miraculous, especially Patricia Clarkson, who embodies the term `supporting actress' beautifully.
I:11682;22;She has only a few scenes, but she captures a woman with a deeper sense of structure than the film lets on.
I:11682;23;the film is a beautifully rendered social commentary on the controversies that surrounded a time period and that still bleed into our way of thinking today.
I:11682;24;The critics loved it but I didn't like it, I thought that Douglas Sirk movies were much better, I've watched them and I'm in my 20s.
I:11682;25;She's the perfect wife and mother, they come complete with two young kids.
I:11682;26;pretty soon the wife finds out of his affair with another man, she stars being friends with her African.
I:11682;27;It was well acted, the costumes and cinematography were beautiful.
I:11682;28;but that's all this movie is: artistic and critic eye candy.
I:11682;29;A friend bought this movie and so I watched it Saturday July 24th, 2010.
I:11682;30;Having lived in New England myself for a short time during the 90's I completely understand the entire stratification of social class as this movie captured in detail.
I:11682;31;And the curiously disturbing thing for me is how I can identify with what I saw in this movie with my own personal experience having lived in New England for a brief time during the 1990's.
I:11682;32;"I am a Chicagoan
I:11682;33;I was seduced by everything.
I:11682;34;The cinematography, the wardrobes, the furniture and design sets, the New England colloquialisms and of course the acting.
I:11682;35;I am a big fan if Ms. Moore.
I:11682;36;"I believe I shall now classify this as my favorite ""Moore movie."""
I:11682;37;my initial response after having watched this film is that a lot of research went into this movie in order to recreate a very authentic time period piece.
I:11682;38;"I am not simply referring to the visual aspect but also the way women were ""trained"" in order to be the perfect Barbie housewife and mother and always perfectly ""behaved."""
I:11682;39;to always look their best and to tolerate unappreciative husbands and to turn a blind eye (with a smile and perfect posture, of course) when their husbands whore around and cheat on them.
I:11682;40;the title for this movie is perfect.
I:11682;41;Far From Heaven is the story about a woman from an upper class family who appears to have it all.
I:11682;42;A successfully employed husband, a gorgeous home, two kids, a maid, a gardener, gorgeous looks and beautiful clothes, etc.
I:11682;43;Her character is that of a good woman who is ahead of her time.
I:11682;44;She is progressive about racial issues, is a faithful loving wife and a good mother.
I:11682;45;i thought the movie was well done.
I:11682;46;The mix of racism, sexuality and the 50's era appeal were all captured beautifully.
I:11682;47;I found the subplots of sexuality and racism to tie in very well with what women had to endure during a time in our not so long ago history.
I:11682;48;A story I would watch again and recommend to friends.
I:11682;49;Far From Heaven starring Julianne Moore, Dennis Quaid, and Dennis Haysbert is stunning, the cinematography is gorgeous and lush but the story is very soap opera and slow throughout.
I:11682;50;Quaid gives a great and vulnerable performance as Moore's husband, he harbors a secret that affects his marriage and family.
I:11682;51;It's a film you just appreciate for the scenery rather than the storytelling.
I:11682;52;This film is simply amazing.
I:11682;53;haynes puts the drama of the film inside the house.
I:11682;54;Moore is truly trapped here and often bottle her emotions to keep the facade admist but outside the property Moore can let go and she often does so in the comfort of Haysbert!The final scenes of the flick can have you reaching for the tissue.
I:11682;55;Never once do Haysbert and Moore kiss but just the wave goodbye has more intimate detail and love in it than Moore's entire union with quaid.
I:11682;56;Far From Heaven is a brilliant film and the entire cast lays out truly heart tugging performances.
I:11682;57;she awoke with a start around two in the morning, with a realization that he, her husband and father of her two young elementary school.
I:11682;58;like raised, properly educated at Sarah Lawrence, Class of 1948, to be the perfect mate for her up and coming man and mother to his adoring children, utter those damns in public, well, at least not outside the friendly confines of her Ladies Club luncheons).
I:11682;59;She promised herself to do better, to read the articles more carefully, and to, carefully, ask her best friend Bev who had been through it all with her Ben, what to do.
I:11682;60;A damn homosexual, a damn queer like those guys she would see in New York in the Village when she went into the city to shop.
I:11682;61;She wished now, wished to high heaven, that he was having an affair with a woman.
I:11682;62;Looking back he remembered that first time, that first time with his boyhood friend, Eddy, and how they explored each other on that Boy Scout camping trip when they were tent.
I:11682;63;in the end she depended on the kindness of strangers to see her through.
I:11682;64;A son of Africa displaced on American shores, on leafy suburban country club life streets.
I:11682;65;"A ""talented tenth"" man, a ""new negro,"" not some frosty negro, some Harlem pimp daddy all flash clothes and pink Cadillac, a girl, some white as snow, on every arm, or some tom fetch it from hunger, yes sir, right away sir , throw the blur blackface a quarter, or a bone, negro but negro devoured by black, and proud."
I:11682;66;this jewel dazzles on every level, conception, directing, cinematography, acting, relevance, and heart.
I:11682;67;In conception it is a stylistic homage to the melodramatic films of the 1950s, and to its eternal credit, is played straight, completely without irony.
I:11682;68;Director Todd Haynes, fond of fishing in some very dark water, exercises admirable restraint here and respect for his source material.
I:11682;69;The cinematography is simply breathtaking, this movie is consistently gorgeous eye candy from start to finish.
I:11682;70;"Julianne Moore's beauty fits well in this context, and her wardrobe and mannerisms say everything about the alleged ""perfection"" of her life."
I:11682;71;Quaid is consistently workmanlike with many good performances to his credit, but here he is like a tennis player who, for some unknown reason, is playing far above what is normally his best game.
I:11682;72;"I am astonished at how good ""Far From Heaven"" is in all categories: screenplay, direction, themes, acting, locations, and design."
I:11682;73;at home, the amazing, versatile Julianna Moore plays the wife.
I:11682;74;Like the graceful swan, she must look stately above water while paddling like hell underneath to keep afloat, but we can't condemn her because her motives are well.
I:11682;75;She knows perfectly well these fatuous social gestures complement and keep afloat her husband's career at TV.
I:11682;76;"Free spirits are slaughtered
I:11682;77;That much we all know about the Fifties, but HOW that occurs and the WAY in which its citizens were so damaged is fascinating, especially with such terrific direction, acting, and a good taut script.
I:11682;78;american gardener throws the smart set into a frenzy.
I:11682;79;"Wonder which is worse: mean and forthright or mean and genteel?Only people ""of a certain age"" will remember this time and milieu well, but those who have affirm that this superb film's rendering of a bygone era is scrupulous."
I:11682;80;Oh, a neighborhood is easy enough, but a whole town?
I:11682;81;Much skill, craft and inspiration must have gone into this movie.
I:11682;82;My thanks go to Steven Soderberg and George Clooney, executive producers.
I:11682;83;unless you'd absolutely despise a serious movie set in the year 1957 with blazingly brilliant fall color and top.
I:11682;84;"notch acting, I'd more than highly recommend ""Far from Heaven."""
I:11682;85;In my opinion it's one of 2002's very best.
I:11682;86;it garnered, I'm more than happy to support.
I:11682;87;Far From Heaven is like a perfectly cut cubic zirconium.
I:11682;88;"In the same way,""Far from Heaven"" is a '50s ""women's film"" a la Douglas Sirk,but it's not."
I:11682;89;Julianne Moore is luminous as a '50s housewife caught between the two men in her life.
I:11682;90;"her beloved husband (Dennis Quaid) and her black gardener whom she befriends (Dennis Haysbert)""Far from Heaven"" is retro with an edge."
I:11682;91;There's a timelessness, but also a contemporary slant.
I:11682;92;Dennis Quaid,usually macho,is perfect as the closeted,conflicted husband.
I:11682;93;Haysbert is wonderful as Moore's wise friend.
I:11682;94;Julianne Moore is especially poignant and powerful in her portrayal.
I:11682;95;Far from Heaven is melodrama.
I:11682;96;It stands as one of Haynes' best works and proof that Moore is one of the great actresses of our time.
I:11682;97;Far from Heaven is celestial!
I:11682;98;One of those 50s movie that brings on the tears.
I:11682;99;Music by Bernstein just lovely.
I:11682;100;When we first meet this family they seem to have it all: the husband, Frank, is a successful sales executive and they live in a beautiful home in Hartford, CT with two kids.
I:11682;101;love for quite some time.
I:11682;102;See this movie for the mood, the music, and the sets and don't be disappionted if your not surpised by the story.
I:11682;103;He's nothing short of spectacular as the conflcited husband in this stylish 50s set piece from director Todd Haynes.
I:11682;104;haynes' personal muse Julianne Moore is also good here, but I question why she received the lion's share of the attention at Quaid's expense.
I:11682;105;'Far from heaven' the film throws light on situations, secret affairs and taboos.
I:11682;106;The film takes you right to the mid 50's, the costums, the settings, the whole atmosphere is that of the late 1950's.
I:11682;107;Julianne Moore gives an outstanding performence, you can see her expressing so much through her eyes alone.
I:11682;108;Dennis Quaid was excellent too, you can see the plight in which the charecters are.
I:11682;109;Nevertheless, Dennis Haysbert delivers an excellent performence as well, the chemistry between Haysbert and Moore is quite strong in the film and you can smell the attraction in the air.
I:11682;110;One of the very few drama based films worth appreciating, watch it for the strong charecter developments and chemistries, watch is specially for Julianne Moore, words alone wont describe this wonderfull film.
I:11682;111;Good in all the aspects!
I:11682;112;And Julianne Moore are so intense in this movie (well, all her movies are intense)!
I:11682;113;In the same year I saw The Hours!
I:11682;114;Here we see a lovely housewife taking care of her children and husband (great Dennis Quaid), organising parties and women meetings.
I:11682;115;"the ONE we all ever need is a true friendship that is given by her gardener (Dennis Haysbert) wich caused tremendous shock in the ""world"" she lives!"
I:11682;116;she played so well in both movies!
I:11682;117;The beauty colors of the film, the Elmer Bernstein score evoques the 50s so well.
I:11682;118;I took it as plainly as possible, ready to enjoy the cinematic treat many critics purported this to be.
I:11682;119;Although the movie has many redeeming qualities.
I:11682;120;Far From Heaven certainly recreates setting of 1957 with striking sense of detail.
I:11682;121;"From the beginning you have to but admire exquisite colors of cinematography, nice production design and beautiful music by Elmer Bernstein (""The Age Of Innocence"")."
I:11682;122;class housewife Cathy Whitaker (played by Julianne Moore) discovers that her handsome husband Frank leads a double life .
I:11682;123;the viewer of course must feel sympathy with Cathy (merited also by Moore's flawless performance), who is portrayed as conventional, yet inside a very strong woman.
I:11682;124;art approach basically works very well, but as a result the film .
I:11682;125;The scenery, the sets, costumes, were among the most beautiful I have ever seen in a film.
I:11682;126;The music was exquisite in some places and you knew you were seeing nothing less than filmmaking at its finest.
I:11682;127;And I am quite certain that the premise of the film, a beautiful woman married to a homosexual man, is one that played out in the 1950's, and before that for that matter.
I:11682;128;having said that, go and get the movie and revel in the scenery, music, and mood that whisks you back to a better place in time.
I:11682;129;Perhaps this is the most powerful Todd Haynes film I've seen.
I:11682;130;But in order to fully understand it one must first be privy to Douglas Sirk movies.
I:11682;131;That is why Haynes' magnum opus elegantly confronts Sirk's work, mainlyAll That Heaven Allows (The Criterion Collection)andImitation of Life.
I:11682;132;once the film begins the viewer witnesses the harmless tribulations of a most perfect family, settled in an idyllic environment.
I:11682;133;Surrounded by success and smiling people, nothing seems to seclude them from happiness.
I:11682;134;but the interdict acquires power precisely because of the nature of its prohibited condition.
I:11682;135;Thus it's evident that even if Frank tries to live the life of a straight man, he will eventually give in to his innermost desires.
I:11682;136;Because Haynes film is a brilliant analysis of America, of sexuality, of repression and ultimately of the well.
I:11682;137;Todd Haynes (Safe, Velvet Goldmine) directs a talented cast in his subversive homage to a genre of 1950s films (primarily those by Douglas Sirk) that featured mature women in socially painful situations.
I:11682;138;julianne Moore plays Cathy Whitaker, a homemaker with a seemingly perfect life .
I:11682;139;successful businessman husband, 2 kids, great house, hired help, coterie of friends, etc.
I:11682;140;Like the films to which it pays tribute, Far From Heaven presents an idyllic setting populated by people making big choices at dramatic moments, living lives in stark contrast to their surroundings.
I:11682;141;The couple's children are invisible and easily disposed of .
I:11682;142;this is a quiet film about appearances, restraint and social pressure.
I:11682;143;On first viewing it, I enjoyed it but didn't think it was brilliant, though I loved the over.
I:11682;144;top look of the film, so to me it succeeded more as an homage than as a film in its own right.
I:11682;145;And committed tribute it is .
I:11682;146;with the look, the sets, the shots, the plot, the music, that never veer from their inspiration.
I:11682;147;sets and costumes are sumptuous and the lighting is quite dramatic, darker than West Wing with pools of emerald and cobalt lights saturating nearly every interior shot.
I:11682;148;It's jarring to watch the making.
I:11682;149;of feature and see that these scenes were filmed in normal light during the day.
I:11682;150;Most of the exteriors were shot in gorgeous New Jersey locations.
I:11682;151;The film can be heard in English or French, and subtitles are available in English, French or Spanish.
I:11682;152;this would be a lovely double feature with All that Heaven Allows or Magnificent Obsession.
I:11682;153;I guess the acting was good, but the dialogue.
I:11682;154;don't get me wrong, I love a good social commentary, if it's done right.
I:11682;155;I thought more of the story about how Julianne Moore's, who did do an excellent job, charcter felt about her husband's extra.
I:11682;156;"One good thing about this movie was the colors
I:11682;157;The movie could have been great if the writer and director stuck more to providing a good, moving story rather than to making a 50's homage.
I:11682;158;Though we are led to believe, at the beginning of this movie, that this is the perfect suburban family, we later learn this is far from true.
I:11682;159;The movie takes an interesting twist when the poised housewife played by Julianne Moore learns that her husband is gay.
I:11682;160;Her best girlfriend seems more appalled at the wife's interest in the black gardener than in her husband's homosexuality.
I:11682;161;Of course the gardener is kind, accepting, charming, and handsome.
I:11682;162;"All of a sudden now the most important thing is his daughter

I:11682;164;She has feelings for him.
I:11682;165;True motives and true love can be revealed when the going gets tough.
I:11682;166;"i care about you and I want to continue to explore this relationship."""
I:11682;167;"Days after seeing this, I find myself still saying things like ""My stars, Debbie!"
I:11682;168;The reason for it, strangely, is the delight I felt about this movie, which is not supposed to be set in the actual 1957 or a parody of 1957.
I:11682;169;perfect Technicolor melodramas for the time by standing alongside them, looking like them and treating its subjects in the manner that those movies did.
I:11682;170;It is, as best it can be, a fun old movie (that just happens to have been made today).
I:11682;171;But it's better than that because it represents its '50s movie culture subject without making fun of it, just going along with the joke completely straight.
I:11682;172;The movie was important, beautiful and fun.
I:11682;173;this is the best film of 2002.
I:11682;174;Can't recommend this to anyone.
I:11682;175;It captures the era in white society perfectly.
I:11682;176;The acting, dialogue and cinematography are top notch.
I:11682;177;Julianne Moore has seldom, if ever, been better.

I:11682;180;"julianne Moore's character ""Cathy"" certainly begins the movie with an appreciation of the richness of her life."
I:11682;181;Stunningly beautiful in the movie, Cathy knows she has a beautiful life, and works hard to hold her vision of perfection together.
I:11682;182;"Liberal, kind, polite, she is ""Mrs. Magnatech"", an icon of her age."
I:11682;183;"So perfect is her world that it is believable, though funny, when she rebukes her son for saying ""Jeez, Mom,"" with a ""We don't use language like that at this house."""

I:11682;186;While he distances himself from his perfect wife, his perfect life, she meets a man who is her equal in dignity, in compassion, in love for beauty and the arts, a natural king among men.
I:11682;187;julianne Moore's performance is Oscar.
I:11682;188;But he certainly inhabits this character.
I:11682;189;Cathy Whitaker (Julianne Moore) has it all: a charming and successful husband, Frank Whitaker (Dennis Quaid), two adorable children, fashionable friends and she is the perfect housewife and mother with impeccable manners.
I:11682;190;Yet, the dark and unfair side of 1950's perfection is revealed in this moving and touching drama.
I:11682;191;She finds comfort in her intelligent and calm gardener, Raymond Deagan (Dennis Haysbert) and feelings grow between the pair.

I:11682;193;"The way she portrays her character's genuine and kind heart is beautiful
I:11682;194;spoken manner that betrays her inner pain is vivid and heartbreaking.
I:11682;195;dennis Haysbert was impressive in his dramatic role as the kindred spirit that Moore is attracted to and while their scenes together are ones of delicacy, there is great chemistry between the two.
I:11682;196;Then at the end, he does deliver a great show of the emotional guilt and turmoil he is experiencing because of leading a double life.
I:11682;197;the costume and art design is bloody wicked!
I:11682;198;The use of light, dark and colour is excellent.
I:11682;199;The colour is rich and vibrant but yet when it is dark, it adds to the sombre and tragic tone of the film.

I:11682;202;racial relations and homosexuality and portraying that betrayal lurks everywhere even behind the smiles of the perfect couple.
I:11682;203;'Far From Heaven' is perfectly shot in brilliant Technicolor with fine attention to detail: excellent costumes, gorgeous sets and beautiful vintage cars.

I:11682;208;Will she finally become a strong willed and independent woman?
I:11682;209;Julianne Moore infuses so many subtle nuances into her portrayal of Cathy that although at times you want to slap some sense into her, you can't help but feel her pain, especially when she finally breaks down.
I:11682;210;although the themes explored in Far From Heaven have been tackled before, this film comes across as touching and heartfelt.
I:11682;211;Its a close call between Julianne and Nicole for this years Best Actress Oscar.
I:11682;212;It is also noteworthy to see Juliannes performance as a depressed 50s housewife in The Hours as well.
I:11682;213;"Beautiful photography and great sets mark this outright throwback to classic 1950s movies like ""All That Heaven Will Allow."""
I:11682;214;I loved the perfect 1950s cars, and the idyllic settings in suburban Hartford.
I:11682;215;Even the gritty parts looks perfect, all lit with a golden glow and moody colors.
I:11682;216;The joys of cinema are explored in.
I:11682;217;From it's Sirk tribute in exquisite production design to the carefully nuanced performances, it's everything a movie.
I:11682;218;the story is simple, but it's telling is complex.
I:11682;219;Julianne Moore plays the perfect Donna Reed woman of the 1950s, and underneath her perfect family lies a secret that threatens to pull apart her family.
I:11682;220;She's so distraught and can only find solace in the humble fine presence of her black gardner.
I:11682;221;This creates a shockwave in the community that has far.
I:11682;222;ANATOMY OF A SCENE, MAKING OF featurette, interview with Todd Haynes and Ms. Moore, and a commentary track!
I:11682;223;A great value for a great film.
I:11682;224;1950s production values, good acting, and lots of extras.
I:11682;225;I did enjoy it even though it is not upbeat.
I:11682;226;The acting is top notch, but Julianne Moore does have the greatest presence.
I:11682;227;The print is very good as is the color.
I:11682;228;The color pops which makes the story even more interesting along with the twist.
I:11682;229;"She and her gay executive husband are perceived as the perfect ""Mr. and Mrs. Magnatech"" leading the perfect suburban life."

I:11682;236;Instead of complementing the plot with its autumn Connecticut landscape that brings to mind all those lonely Sundays of the soul, the cinematography conveys mood but also supplants what could have been an involving and moving story.
I:11682;237;Both husband and wife find their emotions form a kind of smog around them, crowding out all other reality and values.
I:11682;238;Instead, the characters find themselves gradually swept into an out.
I:11682;239;when the dialogue proves her to otherwise be intelligent, socially conscious, and forward thinking.
I:11682;240;This would have been a great movie had it drawn believable characters and dealt realistically with the subjects at hand.
I:11682;241;The relationship depicted between Moore and Dennis Haysbert is utterly charming, and viewers can easily maintain sympathy and interest in their plight.
I:11682;242;Far From Heaven is a unique film, to say the least.
I:11682;243;and sheer intensity of the sweeping landscapes, from the tree lined street, gardens and buildings.
I:11682;244;I found it unique and timeless.
I:11682;245;Thank heaven that we have left the 1950's behind (for the most part).
I:11682;246;The primary focus in my opinion is actually our housewife's (Cathy .
I:11682;247;This story is focused upon in much greater depth and is extremely powerful and though.
I:11682;248;Another unexpected great film in my list of 5 star experiences.
I:11682;249;This time out, he nails it.
I:11682;250;Everything about Far From Heaven is flawless, from the pastel production design and complimentary costuming (even to the rear projection for interior car scenes and the Lana.
I:11682;251;down hair on the males is just right.
I:11682;252;Particularly stunning are the scenes between the always.
I:11682;253;wonderful Moore and stalwart performer Haysbert.
I:11682;254;There is so much subtext, so much quiet courage that the viewer dares to hope for the impossible.
I:11682;255;Julianne Moore keeps getting robbed of the awards she so richly deserves.
I:11682;256;She's not only achingly beautiful but she's profoundly gifted.
I:11682;257;bringing something new, something profound yet understated to every successive performance.
I:11682;258;This is one of the most underrated, seldom shown films ever.
I:11682;259;The subject matter is timely now, and is one of the most sensitive treatments of a conflicted relationship in 50s America ever made.
I:11682;260;Frank and Kathy Whittaker should be happy.
I:11682;261;They have a seemingly perfect life with the right house, the right car, and perfect kids.
I:11682;262;the perfect life is only a facade hiding the very real pain of these two people.
I:11682;263;When Kathy learns of her husband's sexuality, she is devistated and finds refuge in the form of her black garderner.
I:11682;264;A perfect world is anything but.
I:11682;265;When I saw this movie in the theater last fall, I loved it.
I:11682;266;the clothes, the sets, the cars, the film graphics, the music.
I:11682;267;and on the big screen, it made a huge impact me.
I:11682;268;I am familiar with the Douglas Sirk movies on which he based this film.
I:11682;269;I found it a very powerful experience to go to a theater and see for the first time a movie in the style of rerun staples on Turner Classic Movies.Yet this experience did not translate for me on the small screen.
I:11682;270;the film's plot is powerful and profound: the marriage of a perfect 50's couple in Hartford, CT, is threatened by his homosexuality and her friendship with a black college.
I:11682;271;Dennis Quaid, in the role of the tortured, gay husband, turned in the finest performance of the year in a supporting role in my book.
I:11682;272;Julianne Moore and Dennis Haysbert are also wonderful in their roles.
I:11682;273;haynes uses the technique of exaggeration as a means to examine the artifice and the lives of those individuals in 50's.
I:11682;274;Once again, I loved it in the movie, I found it less impressive on the small screen.
I:11682;275;still an important, intelligent movie that most serious moviegoers should see at some point.
I:11682;276;rich film which concerns itself with the inner decay that strikes an outwardly picture perfect family in Hartford, Connecticut in the 1950's.
I:11682;277;The husband of the family is secretly homosexual, and greatly tormented to be.
I:11682;278;In her desperation she develops a close bond with a sensitive Negro gardener, and more than any other occurrence within the film it is the hostile reactions to this friendship from all sides which carries Far From Heaven through its run.
I:11682;279;It also featured a profoundly restrained performance by Julianne Moore, and the beautiful scenery of autumn colors around her in the first half of the movie was striking to behold.
I:11682;280;all in all for its sets and setting Far From Heaven is a gorgeous film to behold and worth seeing once if you have the time, but it's far more remarkable for what you look at around the central characters than what it is those characters are doing.
I:11682;281;`Brokeback Mountain' to me is one of the greatest and most intelligent films I've ever seen and so with that in mind my mind was set in seeing this film as well.
I:11682;282;Cathy Whitaker (Moore) is living the perfect life, and this life is immediately fed to us within the first few minutes of the film where the local newspaper is doing an article on her.
I:11682;283;She has the perfect house, children husband and she seems genuinely happy, that is all until she discovers her husband's dark secret.
I:11682;284;dennis Quaid is one of the reasons this movie is so wonderful for he finally proves what I've suspected all along, this guy can really freaking act.
I:11682;285;His portrayal of the confused Frank Whitaker is so emotionally charged and heart breaking that I'm utterly astonished it didn't garner him at least an Oscar nomination (while in my humble opinion he should have won).
I:11682;286;What makes this film for me was the genuine sincerity in Quaid's performance.
I:11682;287;I was just truly blown away by the power in his performance.
I:11682;288;I've actually never been on her bandwagon, having really only seen performances I've felt were good at best, but her performance here was stunning and perfectly poised and on point.
I:11682;289;She captured the essence of the 50's housewife to perfection and carried so much expression and weight in her face alone.
I:11682;290;I did notice something though, and I just want to throw this out there, but to me Julianne's performance really shined when she was interacting with her brilliant supporting cast, her best scenes stand where she was bouncing off of Quaid's intensity or Haysbert's sincerity or even Clarkson's wit and charm.
I:11682;291;i will make a quick note as well in regards to Todd Haynes brilliant directing here.
I:11682;292;He truly captures the era that was the 1950's, from the look, the feel as well as the performances he drew out from his entire cast.
I:11682;293;I was utterly impressed with every passing frame.
I:11682;294;He knows that he'll never be truly happy if he ignores it.
I:11682;295;Thanks in a large part to Quaid's riveting performance `Far From Heaven' will be remembered, no not as the best film of 2002 but certainly as one of the most moving.
I:11682;296;The acting, directing, screenplay, and cinematography are all as good as it gets.
I:11682;297;One of 2002's best films.
I:11682;298;Julianne Moore is an actress that makes interesting choices in her career.
I:11682;299;"Whether it be a drug addicted porn star in ""Boogie Nights"", stepping into the shoes of Clarice Starling in place of Jodie Foster for the film ""Hannibal"" or as the perfect 1950s wife and socialite in this film, she always seems to be right on target."
I:11682;300;"Cathy, a dedicated wife and mother (imagine the combination of TV mom, June Cleaver and Melanie Wilkes of ""Gone With the Wind""), seems to lead a life that anyone would clamor for."
I:11682;301;She is kind to everyone, well respected and a role model for the women in her community.
I:11682;302;Her husband, played very nicely by Dennis Quaid, is a man tormented by the fact that he can no longer control his homosexual urges.
I:11682;303;A friendship grows between the two, who see the beauty in each other but both the period of time and Cathy's social circle frown upon such a friendship and most definitely a relationship.
I:11682;304;The story is a very emotional ride and well worth the admission for this film.
I:11682;305;Diretor Todd Haynes does a great job of mixing beautiful scenery and the slow building of tension among the story's main protaganists to make a deeply engrossing film.
I:11682;306;Patricia Clarkson is good as well protraying Cathy's best friend, a woman in her social circle who shows her true colors at Cathy's time of need.
I:11682;307;This is an excellent film that I hope lots of people go to see.
I:11682;308;Treat yourself to one of the best films of the year so far.
I:11682;309;The difference, which makes this film absolutely stone cold brilliant, is that Haynes does what filmmakers in the 1950s could not do: address homosexuality.
I:11682;310;the acting of the leads and the supporting cast is stellar, and Julianne Moore, in particular, conveys emotions in such an incredible way that it is impossible not to feel connected to her.
I:11682;311;you can almost see a woman who has felt true, honest human affection for the first time in her adult life.
I:11682;312;I lived in this era, I saw these movies, those colors were in my house, and people said those things .
I:11682;313;but even those have to be considered in light of the whole undertaking, which is absolutely brilliantly conceived.
I:11682;314;He is totally believable, and when their relationship really starts to fall apart, it's tragic .
I:11682;315;an incredibly honest moment which he says a few things that make so much sense .
I:11682;316;This is one of the more daring movies of 2002.
I:11682;317;Far From Heaven proves that Julianne Moore continues to evolve into one of the greatest actress around.
I:11682;318;Her emotional Oscar nominated role as a housewife matches perfectly with Dennis Quaid's greatest role of his career as a successful businessman who realizes he's homosexual.
I:11682;319;Dennis Hayward proves that his acting career has only began as we will be watching more of him many years to come.
I:11682;320;this screenplay accurately desplicts the life as a minority and their friends.
I:11682;321;if you watch this movie, it may take you two times to appreciate it, but you'll be glad you did.
I:11682;322;Far From Heaven will be a classic.
I:11682;323;Haynes succeeds in using Sirk as a template but distinguishing himself in the process.
I:11682;324;As daring a director that Sirk was he couldn't fully explore certain themes that Haynes has the luxury of.
I:11682;325;Where Haynes succeeds best is in his handling of race relations and not just the platonic one between Kathy Whitaker (Julianne Moore) and Raymond Deegan (Dennis Haysbert).
I:11682;326;"Otherwise, ""Far From Heaven"" is one of the best films of recent years and probably of this decade."
I:11682;327;I really enjoyed this movie however I cannot give it 5 stars because despite beautiful photography and solid performances the movie often seemed trite and formulaic due to its rather predictable plot.
I:11682;328;The photography in Far from Heaven is truly wonderful .
I:11682;329;but the movie is hard to accept as a realistic depiction of suburban Connecticut in 1957.58.
I:11682;330;top most of the time, and the two Whitaker kids are just annoying.
I:11682;331;Fair enough, but is it a good movie by today's standards?
I:11682;332;Still, it's worth watching just for the photography, sets and costumes, if nothing else.
I:11682;333;I would like to believe that somewhere down the line the combo of Todd Haynes and Julianne Moore will be mentioned as one of the stunning collaborations in film.
I:11682;334;Haynes is one of the most innovative directors, sometimes saddled to concepts that tend to overshadow the fact that he, like William Wyler, should be directing women's pictures.
I:11682;335;This film, shot in the luscious pallete of Douglas Sirk, glows brightly.
I:11682;336;Some people are satisfied with style over content, and I must admit, if the content is some I m out for revenge.
I:11682;337;the style of this movie is amazing.
I:11682;338;Haynes tells stories of passion unanswered.
I:11682;339;I believe that the style of this movie helps tell that tale.
I:11682;340;The film, told in 50's style, cuts away before we see everything.
I:11682;341;but when taken as a symbolic language for the oppression people still feel, it is a remarkable work.
I:11682;342;Moore gives one of the most restrained performances of great depth I have ever seen.
I:11682;343;Dennis Quaid, who I often think is a little over the top, works well in this.
I:11682;344;Patricia Clarkson is fantastic, as is Dennis Haysbert.
I:11682;345;The work is fantastic throughout.
I:11682;346;so this is a unique film where style helps content to the max.
I:11682;347;I highly recommend the vision and the film.
I:11682;348;The couple, along with their two young children, live in Hartford, Connecticut in the late 1950s.
I:11682;349;Even a casual conversation between a man of color and a white woman is sufficient to encourage considerable gossip.
I:11682;350;He takes over his late father's gardening business and one of his clients is the Whitaker family.
I:11682;351;He is a man of quiet dignity relegated to a second class status by the dominant white establishment.
I:11682;352;Julianne Moore may very well win an Academy Award.
I:11682;353;This might be her best work.
I:11682;354;The acting is superb and the film is breathtaking in color and framing.
I:11682;355;the movie can be appreciated from either view point and deserves your attention.
I:11682;356;Julianne Moore gives a fabulous performance as Cathy Whitaker, a housewife in Connecticut in 1957.
I:11682;357;She has a successful husband, Frank (Dennis Quaid, in an equally fantastic portrayal), and two children.
I:11682;358;She has a normal, perfect life.
I:11682;359;Soon there is whispering all around the town.
I:11682;360;far From Heaven is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.
I:11682;361;The cinematography and backdrop of the film is gorgeous, the script is wonderful (the dialogue sounds just like it would have in the 1950s) and the acting is superb.
I:11682;362;Both Julianne Moore and Dennis Quaid gave marvelous and outstanding performances as people with secret desires.
I:11682;363;if you haven't seen Far From Heaven, you are missing out on a stunning and poignant movie.
I:11682;364;This is a must see.
I:11682;365;Hands down, this picture is beautiful.
I:11682;366;The lush 1950s New England setting, the gorgeous fall colors (that cover up the shadowy realities of homosexuality and racism the film explores), the Technicolor splendor are supported by an emotional score that nuances with the plot sensitively (as expected, under the composition of Elmer Bernstein).
I:11682;367;I just think this is a film that everyone should see.
I:11682;368;A woman finds herself attracted to a good.
I:11682;369;"He is quite skilled at aping other directors
I:11682;370;Haynes' Far From Heaven is a brilliant visual impression of a technicolor 50's social drama a la Douglas Sirk or Nicholas Ray, but its message regarding sexual confusion and racial prejudice has all the punch of an Afterschool Special.
I:11682;371;Julianne Moore is luminous and compelling as always, despite the very mannered veneer that was obviously demanded by the script.
I:11682;372;Dennis Haysbert is very good, but he is virtually reprising his character from 1992's Love Field (a film with an almost identical theme and a much more convincing story).
I:11682;373;Postwar was enjoyed by the few that had the privilege to move to suburbia, get a good job, and raise a family.
I:11682;374;Cathy Whitaker, a Connecticut housewife, had the perfect life.
I:11682;375;a husband, two children, maids to take care of the household.
I:11682;376;Keeping up with appearances can be hard on the body, mind, and soul.
I:11682;377;this movie was good at covering segregation and homosexuality.
I:11682;378;The combination of the two can hold us back.
I:11682;379;Julianne Moore shows us once again the depth of her acting ability ans screen presence.
I:11682;380;plenty of taboos in this film with colours and sweeping musical score.
I:11682;381;share this film with thoughtful, caring people.
I:11682;382;fashioned melodrama that works the eyes and the ears and the heart.
I:11682;383;Quaid is great here as well.
I:11682;384;This is a real stunner.
I:11682;385;sheet for this, do yourself a favor and get it.
I:11682;386;On it's own it's a beautiful piece of art.
I:11682;387;Far from Heaven is a great film which we should see more of this type of film.
I:11682;388;I will be adding this film to my collection.
I:11682;389;numbers filmmaking meant to make you feel good ( I don't think like that, look how far we've come!
I:11682;390;in fairness, I thought Dennis Quaid was very good, but he disappears nearly completely halfway through the film as the film changes focus.
I:11682;391;on balance, great looking patronizing pap.
I:11682;392;"and watch their ""far from heaven"" marriage turn to dust."
I:11682;393;"Like ""American Beauty"", this movie shows us how tragic life can be in the suburbs."
I:11682;394;"in this tribute to 50's movies, Julianne Moore, as Cathy Whitaker, dazzles us with her best performance thus far, and we watch her ""far from heaven"" lifestyle unravel."
I:11682;395;She has great expression and seems constantly professional in her acting manner.
I:11682;396;this is a beautifully filmed drama with some outstanding acting.
I:11682;397;Patricia Clarkson, she plays the best friend Eleanor, is just brilliant in her role as well.
I:11682;398;She is an underrated actress.
I:11682;399;She finds him, in her quest to bring him a nice home cooked dinner, in his office in the arms of a man.
I:11682;400;He is the son of the gardener she had previously employed.
I:11682;401;in one sense it's a parody of the sticky.
I:11682;402;from the beginning of the movie you are drawn into the over.
I:11682;403;juilianna moore and dennis quaid were remarkable in creating their characters for whom i felt both sympathy and shared frustration.
I:11682;404;that having been said, this movie is still one of my top 10 all time favourites.
I:11682;405;The tremendously talented director Todd Haynes, has created an amazing new film called Far From Heaven.
I:11682;406;Cathy Whitaker (Julianne Moore) lives in a perfectly lovely house with a perfectly lovely family.
I:11682;407;She is a respected and envied member of her community, admired for her liberal mind and successful husband.
I:11682;408;from the moment the camera pans down on this perfect community life, we realise we are looking through the prismatic lens of America's most prominent ideals: happy family, affluent lifestyle, happy home.
I:11682;409;Each scene is carefully balanced with soft and hard colors setting the mood.
I:11682;410;Sweeping over this emotional tale is a triumphant score composed by Elmer Bernstein that will remain humming in your mind after the film ends.
I:11682;411;the actors of this film really contribute to its tremendous success.
I:11682;412;Dennis Quaid's performance is powerful in conveying his inability to express hidden aspects of his identity as well his complete disregard for Cathy's needs.
I:11682;413;Dennis Haysbert's character is dignified, quietly hopeful that you may do what feels right if you don't pay attention to the sneering gossips.
I:11682;414;Haysbert conveys this wonderfully and makes our hearts break when his dignity is eclipsed by fear once serious danger arrives on his doorstep.
I:11682;415;Equally strong are smaller roles performed movingly by actors like Bette Henritze and young Jordan Puryear.
I:11682;416;Most prominently, the film is carried along beautifully by its center, Julianne Moore.
I:11682;417;She gives tremendous dignity to this female character who in her own way is trying to understand and define her desires amidst a maelstrom of public scrutiny.
I:11682;418;It would be easy for Moore to deliver this in a knowing self.
I:11682;419;Her performance is worthy of many awards.
I:11682;420;It is most definitely not playful pastiche.
I:11682;421;Perhaps the style of it is intended to just hold up our ideals to the light, like a piece of fine crystal to illuminate all the cracks and magnificent colors.
I:11682;422;She has a knack for playing characters that are always interesting and three dimensional.
I:11682;423;This is a great movie about some controversial issues, including race relations and down low men.
I:11682;424;Randy Quaid is excellent as the tortured, alcoholic husband who is living a double life.
I:11682;425;Julianne Moore is exceptional as the perfect wife and mother whose perfect life is slowly falling apart and she's helpless to prevent it or stop it.
I:11682;426;Her interactions with the new black gardener give the movie an added interesting element.
I:11682;427;This is a great movie with a great cast and it's worth the price.
I:11682;428;If that is enough for you, you may enjoy this film.
I:11682;429;The dated, but bold for its time (1982) Making Love is a masterpiece of realism compared to this.
I:11682;430;It is filmed in 1950's melodrama style, and wow!
I:11682;431;I would classify it as a chick flick and one of the best ones of 2002, I might add.
I:11682;432;An homage to the great melodramas of the 1950's, Far From Heaven accurately recaptures the look and feel of those films.
I:11682;433;dennis Quaid, normally a deeply charismatic actor, played a kind of a jerk, with personal problems.
I:11682;434;julianne Moore, who clearly weighed too much for the role, careened around like a barrel stuffed into a beautiful 50s dress.
I:11682;435;More than anything, it reminded me of the Zip it!
I:11682;436;the movie was visually beautiful, with many scenes worthy of being printed on fiberglass TV trays.
I:11682;437;i hope he makes it huge, and Far from Here.
I:11682;438;"director Todd Haynes meticulously recreates the look and conventions of 1950s ""domestic drama""."
I:11682;439;and time and again the nature of the film works to highlight how ridiculously unnatural this response is.
I:11682;440;the cast is superlative here.
I:11682;441;Julianne Moore, whose career has been building for the past several years, clearly demonstrates that she is now in the same league with the greatest screen actresses of her generation, playing the role of Cathy Whittaker on so many levels that it has the effect of an emotional Rubik's Cube.
I:11682;442;"Dennis Quaid, best known for playing mischievously macho ""bad boy"" characters, gives an extremely unexpected and highly charged performance as husband Frank, and both are excellently supported."
I:11682;443;The script captures every grotesque nuance of the 1950s domestic drama while neatly undermining it at every turn, and the production staff has done a remarkable job of recreating the visual style involved.
I:11682;444;The cinematography and score are incredibly beautiful, and the director's approach to the project is less homage than it is critical evaluation of those who enjoy such artificial constructs both then and now, both on the screen and off.
I:11682;445;It is an extraordinary feat, and quite possibly one of the best movies of the past ten years.
I:11682;446;But it is powerful stuff, and I recommend it all the same.
I:11682;447;"I'm not sure why Amazon's intrepid editors choose two negative reviews as Spotlight Reviews for ""Far From Heaven"" but I'm hoping that fans of this technically brilliant and thought provoking film from Todd Haynes will speak their piece."
I:11682;448;My wife and I saw this movie last week and thought it was as good as any movie we've seen this year.
I:11682;449;We have seen quite a few movies (David Lynch and John Waters come to mind) that portray the Eisenhower years with a great deal of irony and that it is an easy task.
I:11682;450;Haynes resists camping it up and instead presents a heartfelt meditation on the nature of love, breaking social taboos and ultimately the price one pays for following their heart.
I:11682;451;realistic examination of life in the fifties.
I:11682;452;"Far From Heaven may possess the same social values as Water's ""Hairspray"" but Haynes resistance to using campy stereotypes is what makes this movie so powerful."
I:11682;453;the three principal actors Julianne Moore, Dennis Quaid and Dennis Haysbert all turn in compelling performances.
I:11682;454;"seeing ""Far From Heaven"" made me remember that we are still grappling with many of these social issues nearly 50 years later."
I:11682;455;"That's food for thought and ""Far From Heaven"" will definitely provoke a discussion."
I:11682;456;It may be quite slow at times but the movie is beautiful to watch.
I:11682;457;The story is wonderful with a very powerful message.
I:11682;458;And the acting, by all involved, is of the highest caliber.
I:11682;459;It is a movie for everyone, one that everyone will be able to relate to on some level.
I:11682;460;The 1950s were a truly amazing time for America.
I:11682;461;cola came in beautifully sculpted glass bottles.
I:11682;462;We liked Ike and still trusted our leaders.
I:11682;463;That single image evokes the confidence and security America felt during that time.
I:11682;464;"The film is actually Director Todd Haynes' tribute to Director Douglas Sirk's filmmaking style
I:11682;465;"One of the most interesting scenes in answer to this question is when Frank explodes in an alcoholic rage at Cathy after the ""scandal"" of her socializing with Raymond Deagan (Haysbert) has been made public by gossips."
I:11682;466;handed with another man and was still willing to forgive and accept him, but her friendship with Raymond was unspeaskable and out of the question.
I:11682;467;watch this film with someone else so that you can discuss it afterwards.
I:11682;468;"And remember, it's not an attack on the cherished 1950s
I:11682;469;After seeing most movies that, I do go back to read the finer points of several reviews to bring the experience full circle.
I:11682;470;For some reason almost every single review told the ENTIRE STORY and more than ever I was happy that I read them after seeing this movie.
I:11682;471;to me this movie faithfully represents and looks like one of the best movies of 1957.
I:11682;472;When I say one of the best movies of 1957, it say it because it not only convinces you that it is a 1957 social melodrama yet takes it a little further than those actually being made at the time.
I:11682;473;upper middle class suburban family from the 1950's, where not everything is like it appears to be.
I:11682;474;Almost every supporting player, especially Patricia Clarkson and Viola Davis, is exceptional.
I:11682;475;But I still think it was an important movie to go see since I managed to learn a bit about life in the 50's in this country.
I:11682;476;Truly wonderful on both parts of Quaid and Moore.
I:11682;477;Supporting cast was also fabulous.
I:11682;478;the attention to detail of that time period was more than evident across the board and well thought out.
I:11682;479;It's a wonderful film and I learned a considerable amount from viewing it.
I:11682;480;It brought me back into my early life when people were so prejudiced.
I:11682;481;I am proud to own this movie.
I:11682;482;An excellent, well acted movie.
I:11682;483;i know I will keep watching it every so often over the years.
I:11682;484;This movie, for those who were not alive in the 50's, is accurate in every way, from clothing.
I:11682;485;The movie is beautifully filmed.
I:11682;486;Both Ms. Moore and Dennis Quaid are outstanding in this film by Todd Haynes.
I:11682;487;"i've seen the movie twice
I:11682;488;The story is simple but haunting.
I:11682;489;The visual effects and the lights game are exquisite when she talks with him in the hall.
I:11682;490;haynes has surprised me in a positive way.
I:11682;491;The handle of the camera is elegant, fluid and never abuses about the close takes and either the close up.
I:11682;492;"the natural landscape is superbly photographed
I:11682;493;his style reminds me the influence of two great directors,the first one obviously is Douglas Sirk and the other one is Joseph Losey.
I:11682;494;but the most remarkable aspect from this film is the way is told.
I:11682;495;It's an european approach, all along the story and specially remarked in that exquisite ending sequence.
I:11682;496;i really expect great future works from this young film maker.
I:11682;497;She is one of the twenty top great actress in the world.
I:11682;498;All That Heaven Allows dealt with an older woman/younger man relationship and the malicious gossip it bred.
I:11682;499;having read the rave reviews of Todd Haynes' Far From Heaven and the obvious comparison to the Sirk melodramas, I was anxious to see the film.
I:11682;500;She talks to her black gardener Raymond Deagan (Dennis Haysbert), and they become friends.
I:11682;501;Recreating the look of a 1950s women's picture is a fun exercise.
I:11682;502;An excellent story about a 1950s familiy.
I:11682;503;When it comes to marriage and children everything has to look perfect, no matter what lies under the surface.
I:11682;504;Traying to make everything look perfect.
I:11682;505;Hush!While fighting for her familiy, she finds herself becoming close to her gardner, who is black.
I:11682;506;and end that was so anticlimatic, that I was surprised (yet relieved!)
I:11682;507;aMERICAN BEAUTY explains to us how deathly life in the suburbs is, and adds the shocking twist .
I:11682;508;THE HOURS explains to us (in humourless detail) how deathly life in the suburbs is, and adds the shocking twist .
I:11682;509;Sure, originality is only one of many possible virtues a film can possess.
I:11682;510;Telling the same story over again can be extremely worthwhile if there is something new in the telling.
I:11682;511;"Dennis Quaid gives a ""bold"" and ""daring"" ""breakthrough"" performance ' i. e., he plays a [prefers to be with men] man."
I:11682;512;important manifesto it turned out to be, the film might have at least been entertaining.
I:11682;513;if you are interested in seeing a bold, confrontational and innovative film that is willing to take enormous risks to confront the audience's notions of [social] correctness, social propriety and suburban complacency, check out the shocking, disturbing and hilarious HAPPINESS, by Todd Solondz.
I:11682;514;i would give this film 1/5 but it deserves an extra star for all the oh.
I:11682;515;todd Haynes recreates the somewhat dullish, over dramatic style of 50's melodramas with a well thought out, dynamic script that manages to tackle issues so relevant to today.
I:11682;516;It's daring to allow them the full course of their emotions, all the while repressing them every chance they get.
I:11682;517;rest assured, Julianne Moore gives the perfomance of a lifetime in the role of Cathy Whittaker.
I:11682;518;Her range and skill as a performer leads me to see films that she is in simply because she is in them, and I cannot say that about many other actors.
I:11682;519;Dennis Quaid and Patricia Clarkson also wallop their roles wonderfully.
I:11682;520;This is one film that will remain as a hallmark of invention for years to come.
I:11682;521;"replica of Douglas Sirk's classic 1954 ""All That Heaven Allows,"" surpasses its predecessor with stunning grace."
I:11682;522;The film not only broadens the accusation of society's attitudes toward social issues (by adding the factors of homosexuality and interracial relationships), it also achieves something else very important from its audiences: empathy.
I:11682;523;Cathy Whitaker (played by the impeccable Julianne Moore) has a seemingly perfect life until her husband, Frank (Dennis Quaid), struggles with his sexuality and she finds solace in her black gardener, Raymond Deagan (Dennis Haysbert).
I:11682;524;She must deal with her inner demons as she cares for her children, her friends, and her social status.
I:11682;525;Haynes chose the latter, and it was a very wise choice.
I:11682;526;the film is made in the style of a 1950s melodrama, but sincerely refrains from poking fun at the genre.
I:11682;527;The consistency of the exquisite cinematography by Edward Lachman and the magnificently emotional musical score by Elmer Bernstein are among the elements that beautifully add to Haynes's excellent screenplay.
I:11682;528;The true sincerity of the film, however, comes from an utterly brilliant performance by Julianne Moore, who is in practially every scene.
I:11682;529;Subtleties such as this are constant throughout, and though there is no social impact present in the film's plot, the film manages to make a statement which is far more sincere than it would have been otherwise.
I:11682;530;This movie realy captures the time period and the struggles of being gay and race relations in the 50's.
I:11682;531;Everyone should see this movie.
I:11682;532;It has been two years and many movies since this movie came out, but I keep coming back to Far from Heaven as a movie of substance and very fine acting.
I:11682;533;"The story itself is static and engaging
I:11682;534;dimensional story keeps one's interest and engages the emotions meaningfully.
I:11682;535;one story line is Dennis Quaid's character's emerging homosexuality and its effect on his wife, himself, and their marriage.
I:11682;536;"Moore's and Haysbert's characters innocently begin a casual relationship which begins to blossom into deeper feeling
I:11682;537;I loved watching Miss Moore's character, especially, as she was a fine person with a pure heart, and it was refreshing to experience that innocence and goodness.
I:11682;538;Miss Moore's character watches the gardener leave on a traIn at the end, and her expression at their farewell is a magnificent piece of acting, speaking volumes without a word being uttered.
I:11682;539;this movie truly moved me and was thought provoking, with well.
I:11682;540;another great movie that deserved oscars.
I:11682;541;i laughed , i cried , heck i enjoyed myself.
I:11682;542;this is a perfect movie.
I:11682;543;The acting is excellent in a soft spoken, everybody just be civil way and conveys it all with glances and soft words and barely concealed emotions.
I:11682;544;far From Heaven is well done and true to the genre and the time period .
I:11682;545;"That said, I want to talk about the real ""guts"" of this film, which has to do with more than its breathtakingly lush production and the truly immortal performance by Julianne Moore."
I:11682;546;every great actress has a career.
I:11682;547;And now Julianne Moore has her unforgettable performance .
I:11682;548;Obviously, all these performances have something in common.
I:11682;549;the brilliant, lyrical mastery and poetic imagery they brought to their roles.
I:11682;550;Moore truly transcends her written character, making Cathy Whitaker very much a real, yet larger.
I:11682;551;life and somehow ideal, creature.
I:11682;552;because it is combined with a powerful message.
I:11682;553;by contrasting these two barriers, the film not only exposes the barriers that kept us from love and happines in the past, but also shows how far our society still has to go.
I:11682;554;The film was the great, often misunderstood, masterpiece of 2002.
I:11682;555;Far From Heaven is, without question, one of the best movies of 2002.
I:11682;556;It may not have made every top ten list or made enough at the box office, but this was a very memorable film.
I:11682;557;This is a beautiful movie.
I:11682;558;The friendship of Moore and Dennis Haysbert is viewed as more than a friendship and also as a betrayal of white society (Haysbert has the same problem in the black community).
I:11682;559;far From Heaven is a wonderfully acted movie and is perfectly put together.
I:11682;560;The exaggerated ideal of the characters only serves to underscore how powerful the emotions are when the racism and sexual prejudice comes into play.
I:11682;561;"My immediate reaction to this movie was ""beautifully shot, beautifully acted gimmick."""
I:11682;562;Todd Haynes does a wonderful job of recreating the style of 50s melodramas, as well as capturing the look and feel of 1950s, when the future was right around the corner.
I:11682;563;The movie takes a more unblinking view of sexual attitudes and race relations than the movies of that time did (or could, for reasons that are perfectly clear once you see the film), but on first viewing it didn't have much emotional resonance for me.
I:11682;564;now it's weeks later, and I can't get it out of my head.
I:11682;565;I include Patricia Clarkson as Julianne Moore's best friend, whose nuanced performance is one of the best on film this year .
I:11682;566;fling themselves completely into their work.
I:11682;567;Julianne Moore, always stunning, does an incredible job slowly unveiling layers of a character who does her best to add enough layers to protect herself.
I:11682;568;But it shows it to us, in a way that the films of the time couldn't even see.
I:11682;569;This movie is a subtle camp exercise of a nostalgic 50s (wasn't this nostalgia thing over and done with two decades ago?)
I:11682;570;"of ""perfect"" (but not too bright) housewives and their ""perfect"" families that go ""perfectly"" awry."
I:11682;571;"We come to see, arduously, their ""perfect"" lives as being based on nothing more than lies
I:11682;572;And yet this knowledge ennobles them, elevates them above their restrictive, petty bourgeois surroundings, etc.
I:11682;573;The thrill is gone when everyone knows about it, I guess.
I:11682;574;Far From Heaven is indeed beautifully shot and it captures perfectly the mood and decor of a 1950s era Douglas Sirk picture.
I:11682;575;In the end, you have a beautifully shot film with good acting, but Moore still has the same regrets as Jane Wyman about her life.
I:11682;576;it's still enjoyable and even funny in places, but just like the movie School Ties that explored anti.
I:11682;577;great movies with messages should challenge our thoughts not reward us for our own modern.
I:11682;578;introduce that style of filmmaking to modern audiences.
I:11682;579;He made an entertaining film, but not a classic.
I:11682;580;"If you've been around long enough to remember those 50s shows like ""Father Knows Best"", you'll remember how perfect life for the American WASP middle class was depicted as being."
I:11682;581;For those of us who lived even a close approximation, it was.
I:11682;582;own a perfect (and huge) home in a perfect neighborhood of Hartford, CN where you can't see the perfect neighbors for all the trees (gloriously clothed in perfect fall colors).
I:11682;583;The Whitakers have two perfect kids, and Frank manages the local office of mighty Magnatech.
I:11682;584;"It's 1957, and when the Whitaker boy says ""Oh, gee!"""
I:11682;585;"Frank wears a suit, tie and hat
I:11682;586;white world, the only Blacks are the perfect housekeeper Sybil (Viola Davis) and the perfect gardener Ray (Dennis Haysbert).
I:11682;587;in the film's leading role, Moore turns in an Oscar.
I:11682;588;worthy performance as the 50s.
I:11682;589;perfect wife whose perfect life implodes on the day she discovers hubby, ostensibly working late, in his office passionately kissing another man.
I:11682;590;spoken, gentle, and the single father of a young daughter.
I:11682;591;And Haysbert is perhaps another Denzel Washington in the making.
I:11682;592;"The ""look"" of the film is superb, recreating the fashion, cars, home and office decor, and technology of the period to an uncanny degree."
I:11682;593;fAR FROM HEAVEN gives the viewers a glimpse at the dark side of an ideal time perhaps existing only in nostalgia and Norman Rockwell prints.
I:11682;594;For American audiences, this deserves to be a great film.
I:11682;595;Set in 1950's Connecticut, its suburban mix of domestic bliss and martini.
I:11682;596;swilling liberalism both engulfs and betrays the main characters .
I:11682;597;Their story, which begins in what many will know as domestic heaven is swept away by events beyond their control, and as both couple and individuals, the characters are reinvented before our eyes.
I:11682;598;"the condescension towards ""negros"", the perfectly manicured lawns and society funtions."
I:11682;599;The effect is almost spiritual and familiar at once, as the audience tries to cope with the realities of plot and setting and the unexpected sensation of really UNDERSTANDING these characters.
I:11682;600;tod Haynes has created a multi.
I:11682;601;layered work of art that deserves to be seen by any adult who relishes superb filmmaking and simply put, flawless acting.
I:11682;602;Julianne Moore is breathtakingly beautiful in a surreal role that asks her to be vulnerable, angry and honest beyond imagination, often all at once.
I:11682;603;Dennis Haysbert as the family gardner, with whom Cathy explores her own lifeview and inner resolve, is superb .
I:11682;604;And Dennis Quaid gives perhaps the performance of the year as the troubled Frank, the salesman.
I:11682;605;Quaid speaks volumes with casual glances and toss.
I:11682;606;Quaid and Moore deserve Oscars for giving the performances of their careers, and Haysbert's star is certain to rise.
I:11682;607;star profound film that dares to plumb the human condition and address important themes (universal and commonplace even fifty years later) we can all relate to.
I:11682;608;It's easily one of the year's finest films and a sure Oscar contender in myriad categories.
I:11682;609;The art direction, story plot and costume is remarkable and accurate!
I:11682;610;I highly recommend this film to everyone!
I:11682;611;"i only went to see this film based on my experience with another Todd Haynes film, the powerful ""Safe""."
I:11682;612;"My trip to see ""Heaven"" was strictly a time."
I:11682;613;The look, the style of acting, the photography, EVERYTHING seems meticulously like a movie actually made in the mid.
I:11682;614;In fact, that seems to be a fascinating theme throughout Haynes' films, beginning with a college film about singer Karen Carpenter told through (of all things!)
I:11682;615;"haynes, as he did in ""Safe"", once again makes masterful use of quite possibly the best actress of our generation."
I:11682;616;As protagonist Cathy, Julianne Moore does more with a tiny bit of energy and concentration than anyone chewing up and spitting out the scenery.
I:11682;617;equally strong (and startling) is Dennis Quaid as Cathy's husband, Frank.
I:11682;618;His depiction of a bisexual husband is eye.
I:11682;619;In fact, the whole picture painted of how homosexuality was viewed in that time period is chilling and scary, and that's coming to you from a gay man.
I:11682;620;Certainly assured a lot of recognition for best supporting actor in 2002.
I:11682;621;Todd Haynes' best film so far is a complete and very accurate re.
I:11682;622;century, most notedly Douglas Sirk's dramas and romances.
I:11682;623;Figurine, cinematography, art, direction techniques, sound score, etc. everything was made to provide the viewers with the feeling of fifty years ago.
I:11682;624;julianne Moore, once again acting with perfection, is Cathy Whitaker, the wife of a television.
I:11682;625;set company executive, mother of two children, owner of an excellent house with beautiful gardens.
I:11682;626;But then, she suddenly finds her husband, Frank (Dennis Quaid, very good) is gay.
I:11682;627;but a great movie nonetheless.
I:11682;628;Good script, amazing visuals (pay attention to the sets of trees and leaves), and top.
I:11682;629;I loved all I saw, heard, and felt from, in, and about these films.
I:11682;630;What I didn't know at the time was that were all the products of the masterful Douglas Sirk.
I:11682;631;life 1950s, at least not any life I was living at the time, but rather to the beautiful work of Douglas Sirk and his melodramas.
I:11682;632;Films that totally removed us from our routine lives and plunged us into the fairytale romantic world of people with beautiful faces, complex personal problems, thwarted love affairs, stunning wardrobes, lush landscapes, and immaculate homes, lives all lived fabulously surrounded by a background of sweeping, majestically emotional musical scores.
I:11682;633;"created the sound of the scores from the above mentioned films with such accuracy in 'Far From Heaven' it is difficult to believe he was not responsible for any of the original scores of my three favorite Sirk films
I:11682;634;Has there ever been a greater musical film moment than that portrayed by the seductive Dorothy Malone (in her Oscar.

I:11682;636;"goers in the context of today's films (or our lives for that matter)
I:11682;637;structured films can transport us so completely from our real lives into the world of their creation.
I:11682;638;The extras, of which there are several, were interesting and informative.
I:11682;639;if you were a fan of the movies of the 50's, do not let the reviews of those who are not familiar with the originals deter you from securing this film at any price and of allowing yourself to take a magnificent journey filled with heavenly pleasure back into the world of the movies we loved.
I:11682;640;The whole film is totally wonderful.
I:11682;641;And I've seen A LOT.
I:11682;642;It takes the life of a 1950's woman and pins her with all of our glorious modern problems.
I:11682;643;julianne Moore is an astonishing actress .
I:11682;644;she is so good that I cannot believe she hasn't won an Oscar by now.
I:11682;645;due to an unexpected circumstance .
I:11682;646;Item arrived well packaged and very timely, in brand new condition as described.
I:11682;647;Sure, it has a message.
I:11682;648;loved film, but honestly: someone had to say it!
I:11682;649;Far from Heaven is a revisit in style and substance to the films of Douglas Sirk .
I:11682;650;one of the unsung directors of the 1950s.
I:11682;651;Far from Heaven goes further to crack the veneer of American society and reveal the racism and the loathing present at the time.
I:11682;652;moore plays the perfect wife of a corporate advertising executive played by Dennis Quaid, spending her time doing the perfect the dinner party.
I:11682;653;Quaid has deep and dark secrets and revealing his true self shatters her neat perfect world.
I:11682;654;everything about the film works perfectly with a superb performance from Moore as she wrestles with her demons and tries to maintain a polite face to the world.
I:11682;655;She is a good character whose world is ripped apart by forces beyond her control.
I:11682;656;It is a bleak and uncompromising and ultimately very touching film about human relations in an inhumane time.
I:11682;657;This delicate story is about a family caught between isms, phobias, and socio.
I:11682;658;Julianne Moore and Dennis Quaid give their best performances ever as this story unfolds.
I:11682;659;This is further supported by a truly superior script and direction.
I:11682;660;It is one of those brilliant cinematic experiences you ponder for a long time after you have left the theater or turned of the TV.
I:11682;661;the viewer will become sickened by the self.
I:11682;662;righteousness seeping from every character like a kind of venom, but at the same time, the viewer will take a long look at their own skeletons and secrets.
I:11682;663;juliann Moore plays the perfect little wife, standing behind her ideal, wonderful husband played beautifully by Dennis Quaid.
I:11682;664;Like, June Cleaver cleaned her TV house wearing pearls and a skirt, stocking, heels, and a neat sweater set and perfectly styled hair with pearl earrings.
I:11682;665;But, that's why we go to the movies, to get away from reality, were the people are pretty and dressed nice and are polite to each other, throw in some melodrama and you got some good popcorn munching entertainment.
I:11682;666;And the handsome black man in this movie had his own business, was well dressed, well spoken, a widower, with a young daughter.
I:11682;667;He was probably lonely, missing his wife, and he meets a lovely, well spoken white women, who is also lonely, missing her husband.
I:11682;668;They have similiar interests, he pays attention to her, maybe going to the all black lounge was a bad idea, they should have gone somewhere else.
I:11682;669;Loved the fashions from that era, women actually looked like woman.
I:11682;670;Don't over analyze, just enjoy.
I:11682;671;His genius and unique power is his ability to continue evoking the film conventions of Sirk and 50s Hollywood even as he subverts them.
I:11682;672;Only this time the handsome, intelligent, soft.
I:11682;673;to make the impossibly noble and intelligent gardener a believable human figure.
I:11682;674;It is a measure of his success that the scenes between him and Moore, while they occasionally may be implausible as drama, are always believable as two wounded souls reaching out to one another.
I:11682;675;"Due to the depth and power of the emotions projected by the actors, ""Far From Heaven"" transcends its origins as a retro."
I:11682;676;homage and attains the power of the finest human drama.
I:11682;677;It's the best film I've seen in a long time.
I:11682;678;The director did a great job in making this film have the feel of 1960s .
I:11682;679;It captures the discrimination and pressures that gays had to face during that time, as well as showing the wife character (played by Julianne Moore) as victim of her husbands fear of being revealed as gay.
I:11682;680;It offers enough not only on the first viewing, but is worthy of watching every once in a while for its beauty, artistry, and thoughtful message.
I:11682;681;Not for children, but adults with open minds will enjoy this fine film.
I:11682;682;Julianne Moore is exceptional in her role, and Dennis Quaid and Viola Davis provide able support.
I:11682;683;The way she talks, dresses, thinks and reacts is an unknown entity.
I:11682;684;The opening shot is exquisite and I couldn't wait to see what would follow.
I:11682;685;What is drawing so much praise here, Todd Haynes decision to recreate a long gone genre was an interesting experiment.
I:11682;686;But ultimately it got in the way.
I:11682;687;"While I thought the style was cool
I:11682;688;This is a story of a seemingly perfect couple with two wonderful children living in a idealized American home in the 1950s.
I:11682;689;It shows that suppression of sexual preference is difficult at best and generally leads to great heartache for all concerned.
I:11682;690;"The public's fascination with the sheepherders' ""love affair"" in BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is indicative of the situation in society."
I:11682;691;It's a special kind of provincialism to imagine that our age is enlightened, and people in other eras were half.
I:11682;692;This film has a lot going for it and I can easily understand why it received several Academy Award nominations.
I:11682;693;the story is about the kind of upscale suburban couple with two children who seem to have a perfect life.
I:11682;694;The acting is outstanding and so is the script.
I:11682;695;written and directed by Todd Haynes, the script is excellent and never preaches.
I:11682;696;At the same time, the dilemma was brilliantly etched in color.
I:11682;697;Julianne Moore always had perfect makeup, wore bright dresses with full skirts and, for some strange reason, never carried a purse when she went anywhere.
I:11682;698;this is a fine film.
I:11682;699;It captured an era as well as the individual stories.
I:11682;700;"style movie, like those directed by Douglas Sirk (""All That Heaven Allows"" and ""Magnificent Obsession"")."
I:11682;701;"What I find curious is that a much better job of ""looking like a 1950s movie"" was done by ""Eight Women"" also out last year."
I:11682;702;One of the other reviewers is quite right when they observed that there is just no way that a character this intelligent couldn't have figured out what would be the end result of his befriending the white Julianne Moore.
I:11682;703;"so, I was far from moved by ""Far From Heaven""."
I:11682;704;totally snubbed of oscars this film is amazing , Julianne delivers the most heartfelt and amazing performance on screen in rencent years as does Dennis Quaid.
I:11682;705;A Truly wonderful film , I Love it.
I:11682;706;Far from Heaven invokes the style of Douglas Sirk's films of the 50s.
I:11682;707;The cinematography is lush and beautiful.
I:11682;708;The colors of autumn blend brilliantly with the costume design.
I:11682;709;Julianne Moore is such an excellent actress that every role she plays she is fascinating.
I:11682;710;He plays against type and tones down the wide smiling persona he often shows in other movies.
I:11682;711;this is a wonderful movie that should be seen more then once.
I:11682;712;Far From Heaven is a beautiful, passionate film.
I:11682;713;It unfolds with the perfect family life for the Whitakers, just like we always saw on TV shows of the era.
I:11682;714;that perfect look of the 50's that only really existed in black and white TV.
I:11682;715;The staging of the utterly perfect home and backdrops is in stark contrast to what is really going on in this family.
I:11682;716;Haynes doesn't let us keep this illusion, but despite his beautiful imagery, the picture perfect costuming, the score, his pace and his skill with the details in a film, it would all be for naught if he were not working with the caliber of the actors that he drew.
I:11682;717;This time he brings out the best in her .
I:11682;718;and she was my favorite for the Best Actress Oscar.
I:11682;719;if you can get beyond Moore's ethereal beauty, you'll doubtless recognize the depth she brings to a character.
I:11682;720;Both Quaid and Haysbert give masterful and understated performances .
I:11682;721;Quaid as a man driven by his needs which he's bottled up successfully inside him, his whole life, and Haysbert, as a man of uncommon dignity, who is forced by society to live in the shadow of his own needs and feelings.
I:11682;722;so much of what makes this an exceptional picture is mapped out for you that the film takes on even more meaning.
I:11682;723;This is one of my favorite movies ever.
I:11682;724;this is a really good movie, with excellent acting, in particular by Julianne Moore and Dennis Haysbert (known to some as the Allstate man).
I:11682;725;This made me wonder, can an actress be nominated for two Oscars in the same year.
I:11682;726;one for Best Actress and one for Best Supporting Actress?
I:11682;727;Julianne Moore is most certainly an exceptional artist, playing her roles with renewed vigor and great emotion.
I:11682;728;Cathy is a loving wife, devoted to her husband and two children.
I:11682;729;She is living the perfect 1950's suburban life, until her husband's secret obsession threatens to tear their family apart.
I:11682;730;Dennis Quaid is superb as her husband, and Dennis Haysbert is surprisingly successful in his portrayal of the man who comforts Cathy in her time of need.
I:11682;731;The feel for the era is most certainly there, and Todd Haynes does a brilliant job of directing, as well as adding little touches here and there.
I:11682;732;Far From Heaven is truly engrossing, wih great performances all around, including Patricia Clarkson, an underrated actress who plays best friend to Cathy.
I:11682;733;see for anyone who appreciates a good film.
I:11682;734;The film is most definitely cohesive in its structure, and there are many, many superb elements to it.
I:11682;735;class couple living in gorgeous, tree.
I:11682;736;lined Connecticut, with precisely two children and one big, spacious house.
I:11682;737;Frank is a successful executive for the Magnatech company, and he and his lovely wife frequently host dinner parties for the town's powerful and well.
I:11682;738;Everything seems perfect, until Frank starts to act upon his hidden, homosexual urges.
I:11682;739;"The look of ""Far From Heaven"" is right ."
I:11682;740;the beautiful autumnal leaves, in all their glorious colors, cascade down from the trees in every shot, adding soft tones to the events of the film.
I:11682;741;The set design is spot.
I:11682;742;The acting is quite good, by all involved.
I:11682;743;Julianne Moore is especially exceptional.
I:11682;744;While racism in the 1950s was deplorable, we have thankfully, for the most part, moved on from that now.
I:11682;745;The emphasis is, at first, on Frank's dalliances, his insecurities with his own sexuality.
I:11682;746;The set design, acting, and cinematography are all excellent.
I:11682;747;Far From Heaven', Todd Haynes' homage to the grand screen melodramas of the 1950s, is the most elegant American movie of 2002.
I:11682;748;It also has one great performance by an actress in Julianne Moore's portrayal of Cathy Whitaker.
I:11682;749;I found the film mesmerizing, as well as meaningful.
I:11682;750;I suppose that to appreciate it fully, one must love movies.
I:11682;751;A knowledge of history is also helpful, as the film presumes that the audience is knowledgeable of the way society in America was in 1957.
I:11682;752;kathy and her husband, Frank [Dennis Quaid], live in a lovely New Haven, CT suburb.
I:11682;753;They are a popular couple with two young children.
I:11682;754;They are representative of the burgeoning middle class which sprung up after WWII.
I:11682;755;Desire and change have lives of their own.
I:11682;756;Underneath Frank and Kathy's perfectionist existence lies the truth about themselves and the world.
I:11682;757;the cinematography by Edward Lachman is gorgeous, and the set designs by Ellen Christiansen are about as close to the look of 1950s suburbia as you will ever see onscreen.
I:11682;758;Greatly enhancing the movie is the evocative music by Elmer Bernstein, whose first film score was written in 1951.
I:11682;759;highly recommended for those who like their movies to actually be about something of worth.
I:11682;760;As time progresses, the crack severs the family completely, and the picture perfect family from the opening sequence become but a memory.
I:11682;761;this film is an amazing glance at the prejudices in life, not just in this time era, but at all times.
I:11682;762;The theme of this movie rings true for the entirety of history.
I:11682;763;"This heartbreaking story is a wonderful addition to anyones collection, movie lover or not
I:11682;764;A parallel story line explores a budding, sinfully sensuous relationship between wife and black gardener.
I:11682;765;The movie is wonderfully filmed with all the accoutrements of 1950s motif.
I:11682;766;Dress, language, style, d nouement . . . all accurately reflects the period.
I:11682;767;Although I did find many of the interactions between the wife and her taboo desire unrealistic for the era, I was able to take the movie fantasy plunge and stay engaged with the story line.
I:11682;768;The film moves slowly at times however, excellent acting by the cast help keep the slow periods from being out right boring.
I:11682;769;There's lots of nostalgia, desire, and temptation.
I:11682;770;First of all it shows the life of a decent housewife who is active in the social scene of Hartford, CN.
I:11682;771;The music, the opening fond of the title, the credits in the end.
I:11682;772;It also seems to be a great ode to the fifties.
I:11682;773;one very visual part of the movie is color, set in the fall in New England, warm natural colors can be seen everywhere.
I:11682;774;In the trees, the grass, the cars and even the clothes of the people.
I:11682;775;It is amazing how in many shots Cathy wears the exact same color of clothing, as if they are all the same in color, both skin and clothing.
I:11682;776;The storyline however tells us that this is definitely a new film.
I:11682;777;it's a fun movie, I recommend it.
I:11682;778;Far from Heaven provides a rare glimpse into some of the taboo issues that lay under the surface during the 50's.
I:11682;779;Julianne Moore's performance is certainly extraordinary, but one should not overlook the performances of Dennis Quaid, Dennis Haysbert, Viola Davis, or Patricia Clarkson.
I:11682;780;on one hand, this movie provides a look at life when the average wife was a homemaker and when there was a great sense of community as demonstrated by the gossip and the way people noticed others around them.
I:11682;781;It also provides a look at the racial boundaries that pervaded that period as well as the sexual taboos that were never really discussed.
I:11682;782;This movie is a reminder that the idyllic life of the 50's that so many yearn for was really an illusion.
I:11682;783;"Far from Heaven is Todd Haynes' homage and attempt to recreate what was called, in the 50's and 60's, a ""weepie,"" a domestic melodrama with all the attendant production values: lush musical score, sumptuous costumes and a heroine with big concerns/problems mostly having to do with Love, Family and usually both."
I:11682;784;"like the best of these films, ""Far from Heaven"" can be unbelievably moving
I:11682;785;cathy and her husband Frank (Dennis Quaid) lead a tranquil life in Connecticut where beautiful and well.
I:11682;786;Cathy's natural openness towards everyone she comes across as well as her empathy for other races specifically her African American gardener Raymond (Dennis Haysbert) is also causing gossip among her friends and her neighbors.
I:11682;787;"Frank, in a kind of homosexual panic, lashes out at Cathy, the one person who loves and accepts him
I:11682;788;The scene in which Frank asks Cathy for a divorce is a stunner: watch Moore's eyes and body language.
I:11682;789;so as not to portray her as the ultimate victim, Haynes has smartly imbued Cathy with a strong desire to change from the all accepting, never questioning woman she's been to the strong, independent woman she aches to become.
I:11682;790;Her heartbreaking attempts to contact the N. a. a. c. p to volunteer are both incredibly nave yet strongly sympathetic.
I:11682;791;heaven to Cathy Whitaker is a place in which she is always loved, always valued, forever cherished.
I:11682;792;"The cinematography is lush and gorgeous
I:11682;793;julianne Moore's performance is letter perfect: she has the Susan Hayward/Lana Turner style down to a pat, but infuses it with a deep passion and strength.
I:11682;794;dennis Quaid matches Moore's performance with his portrayal of Frank, the husband who is cheating on her.
I:11682;795;dennis Haysbert plays Raymond, the gardener, who uses his quiet strength and empathy to show Moore the true meaning of friendship and love.
I:11682;796;still, it's a very well made movie and Haynes and crew should be proud of this accomplishment.
I:11682;797;This movies addresses, with brilliant subtlety, that movies are indeed completely contrived and unrealistic.
I:11682;798;somehow all the actors, and really everything in the movie, walk a fine line between camp melodrama and searing emotion.
I:11682;799;and yet the movie still addresses deep and divisive social issues with heartwrenching realism.
I:11682;800;This is a complex, heartfelt, and wonderful film.
I:11682;801;You'll learn a lot of things about filmmaking, and you'll learn that Haynes has done something great and important here.
I:11682;802;Many people speak of the 1950's with great nostalgia.
I:11682;803;Haynes's film shows that, one, much of this nostalgia really came from movies, not real life, and two, a seemingly simple and clear.
I:11682;804;"Todd Haynes' ""Far from Heaven"" is such a letter."
I:11682;805;perfect recreation of Fifties weepers that you need a little time after seeing the movie to appreciate the true depth and breadth of Haynes' accomplishment.
I:11682;806;"Then the film's irony slowly grows on you, until you realize that Haynes has his cake and has eaten it too: the film works both on the surface as a soap opera and as a deeply ironic commentary on ""American"" values that still go woefully underexamined today."
I:11682;807;The depth and heartfelt emotion of the performances of Julianne Moore, Dennis Quaid and Dennis Haysbert, however, are obvious from the start, and the dazzling, hypnotic colors of Edward Lachman's photography make you long for the days of Technicolor.
I:11682;808;"This ranks with ""Black Narcissus"" for its intoxicating and symbolic use of color."
I:11682;809;While Haynes' obvious inspiration was Douglas Sirk, I also found myself thinking of Michael Powell, and to a lesser extent of Max Ophuls, a great German.
I:11682;810;"along the lines of the HUDSON/WYMAN ""All That Heaven Allows"" and ""Magnificent Obsession"" this is the other side of the coin ."
I:11682;811;superior performances by Ms. Moore, Mr. Quaid and Mr. Haysbert .
I:11682;812;colder, darker and yet equally moving .]
I:11682;813;She takes comfort in a friendship with her Black gardener (Dennis Haysbert), only to find that her affection for him endangers both of their families.
I:11682;814;"written and directed by Todd Haynes, ""Far From Heaven"" both emulates and scrutinizes 1950's America with its stylized environments, vivid colors, and well."
I:11682;815;The first thing the viewer notices about this film is certainly its astonishingly vivid colors.
I:11682;816;saturated colors, but it is so striking and unusual to see in a modern film that I thoroughly enjoyed looking at this movie.
I:11682;817;Its Oscar nomination for cinematography is well.
I:11682;818;Moving past appearances, Far From Heaven closely resembles a 1950's melodrama in its exploration of the trials and tribulations of the most perfect suburban housewife that the world has ever known.
I:11682;819;What separates it from the melodramas of the past that it emulates so precisely is that Far From Heaven's housewife is dealing with life.
I:11682;820;sacrificing, beautiful and perfect housewife of legend.
I:11682;821;Her appearance genuinely reflects her character, and so she suffers the hypocrisies of her society when unspeakable realities invade her life.
I:11682;822;The performances in Far From Heaven are fantastic.
I:11682;823;Cathy Whitaker could easily come across as being a cartoonish or satirical character, but Julianne Moore makes her completely sincere and sympathetic.
I:11682;824;Dennis Quaid is wonderful as Frank Whitaker, torn between his own needs and those of his family.
I:11682;825;Patricia Clarkson is also admirable in a small role as Cathy's best friend, Eleanor.
I:11682;826;see this film for great performances, peceptive writing and extraordinary looks!
I:11682;827;It's one of the year's best!
I:11682;828;Julianne Moore glows in what will surely be an Academy Award.
I:11682;829;The emphasis on the style and language of late 1950s films makes the explosions even more powerful when they come.
I:11682;830;The pace is wonderful, and I found myself wanting to stay in the theater and see it again.
I:11682;831;The movie lets us see some of what couldn't be shown in the 1950s films.
I:11682;832;The film also capture the essence of the 50's and the social life of that era.
I:11682;833;Both Dennis Q and Dennis H were excellent in their roles.
I:11682;834;A interesting film to watch especially in a time when same sex marraige is legal in a few states.
I:11682;835;This is a great movie, from all aspects.
I:11682;836;The acting, set design, music, dialogue, etc.
I:11682;837;This movie is very comforting to me.
I:11682;838;I feel lost in this time and I'm happy to be there.
I:11682;839;Even though the husband is a gay man and the man the wife becomes friends with is black it is still a comfort movie to me.
I:11682;840;This is a great movie.
I:11682;841;First off it is beautifully directed and beautiful to watch.
I:11682;842;The cars, scenery, dialogue, hair coiffure, dress, makeup, it is all so much conformist glitz.
I:11682;843;"Sorry, there is no way given the circumstances of the time that one could expect a happy ending"" However, one gets a quintessential ending of unrequited love as the train pulls away from the station."
I:11682;844;She's right up there with one of the greatest female actors of our time.
I:11682;845;The colors, camera work, period scenes are pure notalgia.
I:11682;846;Julianne Moore looked stunning and even more beautiful in person.
I:11682;847;She has already won the Best Actress award at the Venice International Film Festival this past September 2002.
I:11682;848;Just recently she picked up the Best Actress award from the National Board of Review.
I:11682;849;"Halle Berry won it last year before going on to win the Oscar for ""Monster's Ball"", so that's a really good omen."
I:11682;850;After watching the film I was very moved by the the subject matter and especially the performances.
I:11682;851;I have to say that Julianne Moore is the one to beat for this year's Best Actress Oscar.
I:11682;852;One thing that Moore has such amazing talent for as an actress is restraint.
I:11682;853;"I know a lot of you have the heard the expression, ""the eyes are the doorways to the soul."""
I:11682;854;Well it is so resonately true when watching Moore's powerful performance.
I:11682;855;All I can say is that I thoroughly enjoyed the film.
I:11682;856;Bravo to him and Julianne Moore for making it so subtly powerful.
I:11682;857;I give this film 8/10.
I:11682;858;I so enjoyed watching this movie.
I:11682;859;an intelligent, interesting and touching story.
I:11682;860;I know I'm going to catch flack for this one, but the 'genius' of 50's melodrama director, Douglas Sirk, has always escaped me.
I:11682;861;In that respect, the film succeeds.
I:11682;862;It is riddled with lush photography and set in the 1950's .
I:11682;863;But if anything, Far from Heaven proves that you can't go back to the well twice .
I:11682;864;In retrospect, that premise works.
I:11682;865;the transfer perfectly captures Haynes' intent.
I:11682;866;Colors are rich, vibrant and nicely balanced.
I:11682;867;Black and contrast levels are accurately rendered.
I:11682;868;There is a considerable amount of edge enhancement and some shimmering of fine details.
I:11682;869;The soundtrack is 5.1 and adequately rendered.
I:11682;870;This, granted, is a meticulous, plush film.
I:11682;871;will relish in the abundant references to Douglas Sirk's films (especially 'All that heaven allows'), and it is impossible not to smile when this film so subtly and subversively makes use of fifties editing staples (love those dissolves).
I:11682;872;homosexuality, interracial love, the oppression of women, all enveloped in the staples of womens pictures of the period (hard drinking, malice, home.
I:11682;873;modern ('oh really, how quaint!)
I:11682;874;This was certainly the desired effect, and the form/style suits the content perfectly.
I:11682;875;Still, this film is a rare beast indeed: a thoughtful, languid, self.
I:11682;876;reflexively contemplative film made by a Hollywood studio in 2003.
I:11682;877;A perfect antidote to the sturm and drang of the latest wave of latex.
I:11682;878;that's really all you can say about FFH.
I:11682;879;Worth seeing overall, not owning.
I:11682;880;The movie starts with a big suspense when Frank Whitaker was confused about his own sexual orientation.
I:11682;881;mindedness of the people in a small town.
I:11682;882;In order to perform as a archetypal wife, Cathy Whitaker (starred by the charming Julianne Moore) puts up with rumours and gossips by the people in the neighbourhood.
I:11682;883;In the movie, the racial issue is well.
I:11682;884;Perhaps it is the best way for Cathy Whitaker to survive.
I:11682;885;fAR FROM HEAVEN is definitely a movie to be tasted.
I:11682;886;Having seen this piece a few years ago and upon repeat viewing (very recently) I really had a much, much deeper appreciation.
I:11682;887;I really did enjoy this.
I:11682;888;I was lucky to see it in a grand old theater with a huge chandelier and multi.
I:11682;889;Dennis Quaid also has a nice performance as a man seething with a lot of secrets and anger.
I:11682;890;for her it is a Black man and for him, it is breaking one lifestyle to choose another.
I:11682;891;julianne Moore's character is castigated and vilified by those closest to her in friendship and even at one point her husband, in a true double standard moment, because of her friendship with the black gardner.
I:11682;892;And then the reverse when she goes to an all Black club that amongst Black people, shocked and dismayed and frightened at her presence, is both observed by her, at first in a feeling of being used and then as a silent agreement of mutual defiance.
I:11682;893;But Haysberry is wiser about the world than she is, he knows that its the time, the 1950's that is truly keeping them apart, not convention or lack of possibility.
I:11682;894;bye to HAysberry at the train station is bittersweet but I got the feeling that Moore's character has possibility, that she's learned from her husband that when you find what it is that truly gives you passion, you have to go after it.
I:11682;895;four stars because her relationship is so well examined and Quaid's isn't as deeply.
I:11682;896;julianne Moore deserves an Oscar, for something, for all of her work and Dennis Quaid whose face looks older still had the charisma and form of someone willing to take risks with himself.
I:11682;897;There's a nice balance in actors like him who are willing to work at being great actors, regardless of what the perception of them may be.
I:11682;898;That kind of courage is what makes great films and artists and work.
I:11682;899;"grooving to rock and roll, watch Far From Heaven, a recreation of Douglas Sirk's style of filmmaking that follows a prototypical 50's housewife as she discovers that her husband has homosexual tendencies and that she's attracted to a black man
I:11682;900;but that is the last you see of that again.You will probably be suckered into this movie by hearing that it is a tribute to the 50s movie era.
I:11682;901;"if this film was made in the 50s it may have got some acclaim, standing behind the ranks of movies like ""To Kill a Mockingbird"", but its tribute values fly out the door when the film just seems to hang in parts like a painting that has just tilted to one side."
I:11682;902;The plot of the story was incredibly brilliant.
I:11682;903;If you want to know what happened in the movie, please watch it yourself, and I highly recommend it.
I:11682;904;the acting of this movie was superb and fabulous.
I:11682;905;All the actor and actress did a great job on their own roles especially Julianne Moore, she is amazing.
I:11682;906;the director of this movie Todd Haynes was a very talented and intelligence director.
I:11682;907;He makes the whole movie looks classy and excellent and catches the attention of audience easily.
I:11682;908;In addition, the costume, scenario and cinematography were extraordinary stunning and spectacular.
I:11682;909;i think this movie was one of the best movies of all.
I:11682;910;I found the authenticity of the clothing, automobiles, hair styles, and furnishing to be very correct.
I:11682;911;the use of color in this film was impressive.
I:11682;912;This was a very good film in my oppinion This could have been a true story.
I:11682;913;A fictional account of fiction, as it were.
I:11682;914;"of dreamy, lush landscapes
I:11682;915;Every camera angle is shot at eye level, so there are lavish, abundant, autumnal colors in every shot.
I:11682;916;middle class life in the fifties really this opulent?
I:11682;917;What the filmmakers have created is a fantasy land, and one which we realize almost immediately they are going to attack.
I:11682;918;The film very carefully shows us how upset the neighbors of Ms. Moore's character are at her relationship with the black gardener.
I:11682;919;But the reality is, most Americans in her social class.
I:11682;920;She goes with him one afternoon to a mostly segregated cocktail lounge, has a drink with him, and dances with him.
I:11682;921;She is a socially prominent housewife in an affluent suburb.
I:11682;922;But it's a pretty heavy.
I:11682;923;Yes, we see Mr. Husband ask his wife for a divorce so that he can be with Mr. Boyfriend.
I:11682;924;It is done by the numbers, with no freshness or originality.
I:11682;925;None of the others are worth mentioning.
I:11682;926;The 50's dialog can seem very funny.
I:11682;927;The topics of racism and homosexuality are handled delicately and honestly.
I:11682;928;The movie earns its tears honestly.
I:11682;929;Technically, the movie is beautiful.
I:11682;930;Ed Lachman does a wonderful job with the cinematography.
I:11682;931;Elmer Bernstein's score is divine.
I:11682;932;Some bad camera placement, otherwise wow!
I:11682;933;There are moments in the story where it deals with the subjects of homosexuality and racism in a very honest way and other times it casts shadows over them.
I:11682;934;For dramatic purposes and mood and to keep the story from the perspective of the lead female character, it works to an advantage.
I:11682;935;Besides all that it has a wonderfully written human being in the character played by Julianne Moore.
I:11682;936;She earns our respect and sympathy.
I:11682;937;The photography is a great hommage to Douglas Sirk who made many wonderful melodramas.
I:11682;938;"The difference between Sirk and Todd Haynes, is that you feel the ease of Sirk's direction in his films
I:11682;939;At the end, I did feel I had a wonderful film experience because that style had been lost forever and Todd has given us a piece of retrospect heaven.
I:11682;940;Next time I'd like a bigger slice, please.
I:11682;941;One of my high school teachers recommended I see FAR FROM HEAVEN shortly after it came out.
I:11682;942;Julianne Moore is absolutely believable as the suffering housewife.
I:11682;943;It really provides insight into the thought process behind the film.
I:11682;944;Far from heaven is another gay.
I:11682;945;i will spare you another briefing here.
I:11682;946;in a few words: Moore is more than good here.
I:11682;947;truths, and reveals America in the 50's for what it truly was: misogynistic, homophobic, and racist.
I:11682;948;Boy, just imagine if they actually made movies like this back in the fifties .
I:11682;949;Far From Heaven is a surprisingly original form of drama.
I:11682;950;It tells the story of family secrets, acceptance and love stylistically wrapped up in the techniques of 1950's films.
I:11682;951;Every detail of this film is like it's counterparts in 1950's melodrama.
I:11682;952;The old fashioned acting styles are note perfect for both Julienne Moore and Dennis Quaid, the music is wonderfully recreated, the set designs constructed in the same fashion, even the opening title sequence and end credits look authentic.
I:11682;953;But most importantly, it all worked perfectly with the story.
I:11682;954;lovers of 1950's melodrama will eat this film up, and anyone who can appreciate the guts and talent it took to recreate it so authentically will find much to love.
I:11682;955;But the story is strong enough on its own to not even need it.
I:11682;956;It would have rounded out a bunch of great films well worthy of their nominations.
I:11682;957;the appeal of this movie lies in its presentation of two issues that remain quite powerful today: racism and sexual repression.
I:11682;958;This gives one a glimpse of how these two subjects may have been handled together via this genre in the 50s.
I:11682;959;there is absolutely no question about the performances.
I:11682;960;Julianne Moore is simply exquisite as the tortured Cathy whose whole world eventually crumbles before her eyes.
I:11682;961;Dennis Quaid does a wonderful job but I suspect this is probably his bravest role as opposed to his strongest performance.
I:11682;962;Dennis Haysbert is, as usual, quite good.
I:11682;963;His performance is perfectly nuanced and perfectly predictable.
I:11682;964;She could have a field day spoofing the conflicted soul of the quintessenital white woman whose life is crumbling around her.
I:11682;965;She is about to be interviewed for the society page and the interviewer sees him too and both women look as if they have seen Bigfoot or something.
I:11682;966;And for those of you who think that it was rare for a college.
I:11682;967;That was infinitely more common that you would care to think.
I:11682;968;Kudos to the production/costume designers .
I:11682;969;create this look by color grading with my Corel X5, Vitascene and other stuff that came with Corel.
I:11682;970;The story was great also.
I:11682;971;"RACISM and intolerance
I:11682;972;FAR FROM HEAVEN is a beautifully crafted motion picture.
I:11682;973;minded, you'll enjoy this stylish flick.
I:11682;974;After all this time, I finally saw the Oscar.
I:11682;975;While stars Julianne Moore and Dennis Quaid were good in their respective roles, I was more impressed by the quiet performance from the always.
I:11682;976;While his restraint was a little too much to be believed, considering what he and his daughter went through, I can still say that his was the role that should have been rewarded with an Oscar nod.
I:11682;977;His character was truly the most sympathetic of the trio.
I:11682;978;The movie had great costuming and an attention to set detail that made one think that the 50's had returned.
I:11682;979;The locations and vintage automobiles, along with Elmer Bernstein's appropriate scoring, added to my enjoyment of the film.
I:11682;980;Julianne Moore is one of a very small handful of contemporary actresses whose presence onscreen harkens back to the glory days of Movie Stardom .
I:11682;981;and her palpable glamour and undeniable screen presence are a hugely welcome change from the bland bleatings of actresses like Gwyneth, Halle, et al.
I:11682;982;She's a hugely talented actress, too .
I:11682;983;in pictures like 'Magnolia' and the sublime 'The Hours' she shows that she's so much more than a pretty face.
I:11682;984;a good premise for a movie, with an excellent cast .
I:11682;985;Quaid, back from the dead and on top form, gives a compelling performance as a man coming to terms with himself .
I:11682;986;and Haysbert has a screen presence and a benign charisma that few of his contemporaries can equal.
I:11682;987;Moore, as I've mentioned, is luminous and quaint, without ever once being cloying or sentimental.
I:11682;988;direction is lovely, with Todd Haynes' retro.
I:11682;989;fantastic vibe pervading the whole picture, giving an enormous sense of 'The Lucy Show' gone awry.
I:11682;990;The premise of the picture is compelling, the ensemble cast are highly talented and the directorial talents of Haynes are top.
I:11682;991;visually compelling, and in places, great, on the whole, 'Far From Heaven' is a disappointment that really could have been a Classic.
I:11682;992;They wear couture to return the tupperware!Extravagant and richly fullfilling and a deluded and ultimately disillusioned leading lady.
I:11682;993;Heartbreaking and satisfying at the same time.
I:11682;994;For this film, she turns in a remarkably restrained and subtle piece of acting, one that puts me in mind of Emma Thompson's excellent work in The Remains of the Day.
I:11682;995;It is done skillfully, and seems to be indicative of the '50's in general, this sense of a perfect mask, hiding any number of problems.
I:11682;996;another excellent performance is found in Dennis Haysbert, as Raymond Deagan, the Whitakers' African.
I:11682;997;nevertheless, Far From Heaven is a film filled with wonderfully subtle performances, and expresses the feel of America in the 1950's very well.
I:11682;998;Far From Heaven portrays both the shell and the conflicts beneath it almost perfectly, and reveals a great deal about the time.
I:11682;999;It is a film, and a subject, worthy of attention.
I:11682;1000;The movie and story and the wonderful settings of the mid.1950's was all soul sturring.
I:11682;1001;In that respect it was a wonderful walk in the past.
I:11682;1002;"The hardest part and most heart breaking of the whole film is the ""wife."""
I:11682;1003;all in all this is a wonderful film.
I:11682;1004;Not a feel good movie by all means but a great film on acting, thought, love, emotion and remenice of the 50's.
I:11682;1005;The music score and title graphics are also excellent.
I:11682;1006;"I'm not sure if this will be a hit or not,,,,,maybe a sleeper like ""Greek Wedding"" but it is worth the price of admission to see this wonderful 1950's film."
I:11682;1007;Good job cast and crew of this movie.
I:11682;1008;The movie begins with lush color and music that could have so easily been a mockery of films from the 1950's.
I:11682;1009;certainly not our successful hero and heroine.
I:11682;1010;special mentions must go the superb acting of the entire cast, the exquisite art direction and costumes, and one of the best musical scores heard in years.
I:11682;1011;They appreciate a movie for its technical merit, and for references and homage to other movies.
I:11682;1012;(For example, note all the references to Douglas Sirk in the positive reviews.)
I:11682;1013;The actors are terrific, the sets are amazing, yet I found this movie almost completely unwatchable.
I:11682;1014;Far from Heaven (Todd Haynes, 2002)The movies that have found their way onto my Best of 2002 list have no way of being compared, really.
I:11682;1015;proof Fence, and Far from Heaven and compare them in any meaningful way.
I:11682;1016;Cathy and Frank are considered by the residents of their Connecticut suburb to be the perfect couple, so much so that the local weekly paper wants to do a profile on them.
I:11682;1017;the aforementioned counterpoint is best shown by the treatments of the two taboos the characters break.
I:11682;1018;Cathy soon finds out there is a lot more to Raymond than meets the eye, and the two find themselves falling in love.
I:11682;1019;"while one would expect the double standard one actually gets here (Franks behavior is suspected, but not known, and somewhat tolerated
I:11682;1020;It is never less than compelling, brilliant from beginning to end, and easily one of the best films of 2002.
I:11682;1021;Except for the wonderful period costumes and props, the loving lush wide.
I:11682;1022;At best a period piece, at worst Hollywood's version of an Eisenhower.
I:11682;1023;The people behind this movie were successful at achieving their vendetta for the fifties.
I:11682;1024;Hollywood has still not got over the blacklisted era and this movie is a good example of revenge of the liberal nerds.
I:11682;1025;I have a warm memory of the fifties ala American Graffitti and this movie gives no credit to the wonderful aspects of the era.
I:11682;1026;having been raised on the 1940's and 50's movies, it is very nice seeing one done in that style again.
I:11682;1027;I hope they do more movies of this type.
I:11682;1028;It is also refreshing to see a happy ending for a gay person, i. e. the love interest stays, and the gay person doesn't die!!
I:11682;1029;It takes a conventional story and brings it vividly to life with a precise display of colors, genuine wardrobe, and authentic environments.
I:11682;1030;One aspect in particular the movie excels at is recreating the acting element of 50's cinema.
I:11682;1031;The performances are both compelling and genuine and the movie, while slow moving at times, in its entirety is certainly worth watching and wholly enjoyable.
I:11682;1032;It had promises of being a beautiful movie, one with which many of us could relate to.
I:11682;1033;Perhaps its the initial scenes of a picture perfect life.
I:11682;1034;Julianne Moore is a bit too sugary sweet there, trying too hard to potray a contented, well loved and happy wife , mother and friend.
I:11682;1035;dennis Quaid is very good as the confused man coming to terms with his homosexuality.
I:11682;1036;Dennis Haybert plays his part of a sympathetic and generous friend very well.
I:11682;1037;The attention to detail, the music, the costumes, the camera angles, the cinematography .
I:11682;1038;The reason anyone, male or female, should watch this picture is the standout performance delivered by Quaid.
I:11682;1039;But Quaid was clearly at the top of his form here.
I:11682;1040;Kathy and Frank Whitaker (played by Julianne Moore and Dennis Quaid) live an ideal life in Connecticut in 1957.
I:11682;1041;They live in a picture perfect house with their two school age children and have a fulfilling social life in the local community.
I:11682;1042;Frank has a successful executive job while Kathy is devoted to her husband and children while attending various social functions with other like.
I:11682;1043;As word escapes about the truths of the Whitaker family Kathy gets a first hand glimpse into the ignorance and intolerance of their extramarital activities.
I:11682;1044;i remained captivated throughout the showing of this movie.
I:11682;1045;The acting was very good, especially Julianne Moore.
I:11682;1046;Julianne Moore is devastatingly stunning, the costume and set designs are marvellous and the flow of the movie is impeccable.
I:11682;1047;All round excellent production.Yet, something is amiss.
I:11682;1048;Perhaps that atavistic thrill that comes from not being able to predict the next scene in a movie, which sadly is not a luxury Far from Heaven affords.
I:11682;1049;in any case, the characters are developed with picture.
I:11682;1050;perfect tenacity and you're bound to end up feeling the desparation of all of them.
I:11682;1051;The movie touchingly conveys a sense of community and hidden depths of human kindnesses and hypocrisies.
I:11682;1052;"Made as a homage to ""Woman's pictures"" of the 1950's this film is visually stunning, historically explorative and in part glides along like a well oiled machine, while also suffering major and difficult breakdowns on route."
I:11682;1053;Moore's performance in particular, is fragile and yet stonily veneered to a fault, vulnerable yet stoic and her beautiful performance is so delicate as to scream out in pain.
I:11682;1054;This film is beautiful, moving and an experience that will haunt you for some time to come.
I:11682;1055;It's social and historical comments are accurate, couragous and superbly told.
I:11682;1056;This is one of the most aesthetically beautiful films I've seen in years.
I:11682;1057;The more perfect the image, the larger the gap between the image and the reality, and the more dramatic the impact when the perfect image begins to crumble.
I:11682;1058;a film that will have you thinking after you leave the theatre.
I:11682;1059;a wonderful gift to any movie lover!
I:11682;1060;All of the tragedy that the wife experienced, I thought this movie gives us a clear message that the wife will empower herself with the hope for idealism of fairness she found in herself as well as in a Gardner.
I:11682;1061;Far from Heaven sets a wonderful serene mood with its quiet autumnal vistas, echoed by the primarily orange and green color scheme.
I:11682;1062;"Everything is clean and new in Hartford Connecticut during the late 1950's
I:11682;1063;Cathy played by the incandescent Julianne Moore, is the perfect hostess, housewife and mother.
I:11682;1064;Her husband, played by a wiry, edgy Dennis Quaid is the perfect father and successful businessman.
I:11682;1065;Their gardener, Deagan, played by Dennis Haysbert, is squeaky clean as well, always wearing brand new clothes even though he just came out of the garden.
I:11682;1066;Yet Cathy and her husband are both touched by passion that violates the expectations of small town 1950's society.
I:11682;1067;this movie makes the point that the serene beauty of this time is achieved at cost of loss of awareness and passion.
I:11682;1068;"The double life that must be lived by those who have longings for something other than the mainstream is hinted at by the movie marquee that advertises ""The Three Faces of Eve""."
I:11682;1069;this film is beautiful and passionate with a wonderful attention to detail.
I:11682;1070;feminine clothing of the women and the brilliantly painted rooms and cars create a nostalgic mood that is contrasted by emotional tone of frustration and lonely despair.
I:11682;1071;A wonderful moody piece with brilliant acting.
I:11682;1072;"Usually ""cleverness,"" when perceived in a work of art, short."
I:11682;1073;circuits our capacity to be moved by it .
I:11682;1074;usually, cleverness implies the self.
I:11682;1075;Dennis Quaid, often shot in darkness or near darkness is absolutely splendid as the tortured Frank.
I:11682;1076;"When I use words like ""superb"" and ""splendid,"" I am responding to performances that not only are a matter of representing characters: the actors here are also acting the part of 1950s actors playing the characters ."
I:11682;1077;Haynes believes that that style WORKED, that any style can work, if it is employed with directness and attention to detail, and backed by a good script (in a complementary style, of course).
I:11682;1078;the truth that Haynes is after is emotional .
I:11682;1079;class Connecticut, and the lines have to do with sexual orientation and race relations.
I:11682;1080;In the final scene he boards a train for a new life in Baltimore, and all Cathleen can do is exchange with him a final silent wave.
I:11682;1081;It sounds sentimental, and it is .
I:11682;1082;but it's played superbly straight, and we believe it.
I:11682;1083;The lush photography and lavish musical scores of 50's melodrama Haynes reproduces with an obsequious fidelity, though he is original in adding one unfortunate element .
I:11682;1084;if the film has any saving grace, it's in the lead performances.
I:11682;1085;Both Moore and Quaid do commendable work, though it should be noted that their roles are so limited in depth that not very much is demanded of either.
I:11682;1086;She has an initial inkling that racism is bad, and with experience she finds it indeed to be so!
I:11682;1087;Todd Haynes flawlessly captures a devastating portrayal of suburban rot and dysfunction against a seemingly perfect fifties backdrop.
I:11682;1088;the performances are excellent all around, and the music score is simply beautiful.
I:11682;1089;Julianne Moore and Dennis Quaid both deserved every award that they won for their work here, and Todd Haynes proves that he is an amazing director.
I:11682;1090;First, this is a gorgeous movie.
I:11682;1091;The sets, colors, angles, costumes and lighting all come together to make some dazzling images of idyllic 50's suburbia.
I:11682;1092;"a ""message"" movie, I thought."
I:11682;1093;she gracefully, stoically handles it all as if it were nothing more than a spilled drink at a cocktail party .
I:11682;1094;if you like lush visuals you should check this out.
I:11682;1095;This beautifully realized film by Todd Haynes not only rediscovers the style of 1950's cinema, but explores the pain and loneliness beneath the stifling facade of 1950's American life.
I:11682;1096;Haynes' highly economical screenplay neatly articulates three key arenas of prejudice: race, gender and sexual preference.
I:11682;1097;And at the heart of this film are three great performances.
I:11682;1098;Dennis Haysbert is wonderful as Raymond Deagan, striking just the right balance between subservience and dignity.
I:11682;1099;Whatever the case, the Academy certainly got it right when nominating Edward Lachman for his cinematography.
I:11682;1100;The deliberately Technicolored style which revives our latent memories of Douglas Sirk's melodramas is an extremely clever choice.
I:11682;1101;For these viewers, the result will be a film which is as moving as it is beautiful.
I:11682;1102;Excellent acting, I loved Julianne Moore and Dennis Quaid.
I:11682;1103;the costume design is exquisite, Julianne Moore is a lovely depiction of the perfect 50's housewife, including her curiosity and caretaker demeanor.
I:11682;1104;Also I enjoyed the lighting in this movie, as it depicts the time authentically.
I:11682;1105;In FAR FROM HEAVEN, Todd Haynes fulfills the promise of his brilliant early works (i. e. POISON) and has delivered not only his best film, but one of the best films of the year.
I:11682;1106;"favorite director Douglas Sirk as a reimagining of his style, HEAVEN turns the 50s ""women's picture"" genre on its ear while simultaneously embodying its stylistic conventions."
I:11682;1107;Gorgeous to look at, filled with beautiful and subtle performances, the picture will move many to tears and send many back for a second look.
I:11682;1108;"sold ""blockbusters,"" a film of such quiet beauty may not get the attention it deserves, so see this one soon ."
I:11682;1109;"I first discovered her when she was starring on ""As The World Turns"" and always knew she would be an amazing actress one day."
I:11682;1110;"In ""Far From Heaven"" Juliiane plays a 1950's housewife who has everything a woman would want in the ultra conservative fifties
I:11682;1111;the performances in this film are flawless and Dennis Quaid does a superb job playing the husband leading a double life.
I:11682;1112;"julianne Moore would receive an Oscar nomiantion for Best Actress for her role in ""Far From Heaven"" and the movie was a hit at the boxoffice."
I:11682;1113;Far From Heaven may not have been filmed in 1957, but director Todd Haynes invests such a fierce attention to detail that it could have very well been made in that era.
I:11682;1114;It's a heartbreakingly effective tale of a Connecticut family whose white.
I:11682;1115;Julianne Moore gives the performance Oscar fantasies are made of as Cathy Whitaker, the good.
I:11682;1116;natured and dutiful mother and husband of a successful TV executive (an emotional Dennis Quaid).
I:11682;1117;"I'll refrain from revealing anything more, but ""Far From Heaven"" had me hooked from the word go."
I:11682;1118;But what peaked my interest is how this film, set in 1957, handled homosexuality in a period that pre.
I:11682;1119;Far From Heaven is a beautifully done film that deserves your attention as much as it deserves a handful of awards.
I:11682;1120;I am thrilled to see this type of movie brought back to the silver screen by the multi.
I:11682;1121;What a wonderful, emotional and beautiful movie.
I:11682;1122;The movie looks absolutely perfect.
I:11682;1123;The Douglas Sirk stylings are a wonderful hommage to the classic director.
I:11682;1124;The script is one of the best.
I:11682;1125;Julianne Moore deserved more than an Oscar nomination for her portrayal of the perfect 50's housewife.
I:11682;1126;His picture perfect performance is nothing short of spectacular.
I:11682;1127;I envy those of you who are seeing this for the first time.
I:11682;1128;Simply put, it is the best film of 2002.
I:11682;1129;I enjoyed this film on many levels.
I:11682;1130;The images of the 50's are excellant and the acting was inspired.
I:11682;1131;The script was good and the story was believable.
I:11682;1132;In a nutshell this was a good film and it did draw you in, make you think and feel the tention.
I:11682;1133;A good film worthy of a look.
I:11682;1134;I saw this movie because friends who write print reviews wanted my take on whether this was a realistic depiction of Hartford in the 1950s, a place and time I lived there.
I:11682;1135;The director Todd Haynes does a wonderful job of recreating the mood and film style of the '50's in FAR FROM HEAVEN.
I:11682;1136;the movie is technically superb, and tells it story at the leisurely pace of the films of that period while tackling topics directors such as Douglas Sirk (whose ALL THAT HEAVEN ALLOWS is the model for this film) could not touch at that time.
I:11682;1137;"Dennis Quaid is excellent as the corporate man of the period struggling with his sexual orientation
I:11682;1138;It may seem stereotypical, and in some regards, it is, but this is a solid film with wonderful performances that should not be missed.
I:11682;1139;Quad's character promises to get help, and she smiles and says thank you.
I:11682;1140;Throughout the film, she attempts to put on a happy face.
I:11682;1141;Her character is very popular.
I:11682;1142;standing friends, she have 2 children, a gorgeous house.
I:11682;1143;the film goes through some up and downs, all the while anchored by Julianne Moore's brilliant performance.
I:11682;1144;the ending is a tad unresolved, but I felt satisfied, in a way.
I:11682;1145;I thought the director did a fantastic job, not just with the script and plot, but with the look and feel of the film.
I:11682;1146;It looks ridiculously authentic, from the clothing, to the cars and props and even the start and end credits looked genuine.
I:11682;1147;This is certainly one of the prettiest films I've seen that takes place in that particular era.
I:11682;1148;It made it that more impressive and authentic.
I:11682;1149;i do recommend this to anyone who loves a good melodrama.
I:11682;1150;I was pleasantly surprised myself.
I:11682;1151;Far From Heaven is the perfect antidote to all those right.
I:11682;1152;wing reactionaries who hold the 1950s as a time of perfect peace and tranquility.
I:11682;1153;The way the movie is filmed is worthy of note as well.
I:11682;1154;The one glaring note in it is the portrayal of the children, particularly the requisite boy and girl of Julianne Moore and Dennis Quaid's family.
I:11682;1155;"They are little more than caricatures, fresh from a Norman Rockwell painting, saying things such as ""Aw shucks!"""
I:11682;1156;Focus Features came out with two movies in the year 2002: The Pianist and Far From Heaven.
I:11682;1157;The Pianist was a holocaust film and Far From Heaven was a social commentary about homosexuallity and racism in the 50's.
I:11682;1158;I must note that Far From Heaven was a better movie as far as acting goes (with the exception of Adrien Brody, who I thought portrayed his character's sense of horror and shock very well) as well as cinematography and enjoyment.
I:11682;1159;That statement brings me into my next issue.
I:11682;1160;It takes a certain perspective, I think, to be able to enjoy this movie.
I:11682;1161;A perfect 50's family (stay.
I:11682;1162;Julianne Moore's character is what helps hold everything together.
I:11682;1163;Dennis Quaid deserved an Oscar nomination and possible win for his best performance as Mr. Whitaker, an advertising executive.
I:11682;1164;This was Quaid's shining morning.
I:11682;1165;portrayed by Moore, whose best performance is this movie.
I:11682;1166;She did recieve an Oscar nomination, and an apparant close win.
I:11682;1167;Patricia Clarkson also deserved an Oscar nomination who plays Moore's possibly.
I:11682;1168;a best friend (if that makes sense).
I:11682;1169;bottom Line: Should have been nominated for Best Picture over The Pianist for its outstanding cinematography, story, direction and, of course, acting.
I:11682;1170;I was eager to see this based on all the hype.
I:11682;1171;Take the friendship with Moore and her gardiner .
I:11682;1172;No woman with such a high reputation to uphold would have done that then.
I:11682;1173;By the time the characters are really starting to develop the film is over .
I:11682;1174;rated piece of film which has been 'disguised' by nice colours and good acting.
I:11682;1175;"But ""Far"" has a visibly homosexual character who'd played by a heterosexual actor, and."
I:11682;1176;you feel you're watching someone assemble LEGOs, rather than viewing a dramatically meaningful story.
I:11682;1177;"implying that his affection for another man is ""real"" in a way his feeling for Cathy never was ."
I:11682;1178;Haynes has a gift for writing brief, verbally terse scenes that clearly convey the characters' thoughts and emotions.
I:11682;1179;He has time to show Frank cruising and (implicitly) having sex with a teenager while on vacation with Cathy.
I:11682;1180;"Adding another five minutes, with Frank meeting and falling in love with someone worthy of his affection, would have added dramatic balance, as well as ""pushing"" the genre by showing something that Sirk was never able to directly reveal."
I:11682;1181;"Providing an implicitly ""happy"" ending for Frank (while Cathy continues in her solitude) would have made an ironic comment on the ""glossy melodrama"" genre and the mores of its era."
I:11682;1182;this is how life actually was in the 1950s.
I:11682;1183;And I feel sorry for, and I know you will to, the children in the movie.
I:11682;1184;you'll just have a better understanding of this concept when you see the movie.
I:11682;1185;this is one of my favorite movies, and it's destined to be a classic in decades to come.
I:11682;1186;The director and the actors are brilliant.
I:11682;1187;Both sagacious and poignant, this homage to Douglas Sirk's film noir/women movies of the 1950's delivers an emotionally.
I:11682;1188;powerful story both successfully and allegorically.
I:11682;1189;The filmmaking and subject matter of Far from Heaven are expertly displayed in the exact, old.
I:11682;1190;fashioned style as Sirk's movies, while being a stylish film with a relevant, perceptive message.
I:11682;1191;perfect lives with dark and very human underlying secrets.
I:11682;1192;Far from Heaven is the exact same type of movie, but one that is capable of transcending the cinematic melodramas of the 50's.
I:11682;1193;Cathy is introduced to us as a perfectly polished, ideal housewife of the 1950's.
I:11682;1194;She is well respected by her peers, well groomed, and loves her family.
I:11682;1195;Raymond is a charming, handsome, and intelligent black man who has a passion for seeing color, or more specifically, whatever is on the surface of things.
I:11682;1196;esque lifestyle in which she lived.
I:11682;1197;far from Heaven is the ultimate antipode to the other great period movie of 2002, Chicago.
I:11682;1198;Rob Marshall's musical Chicago was entertaining, bold, brassy, and the sort of film that people see to simply have a fun time (and, of course, there's nothing wrong with that).
I:11682;1199;Far from Heaven, on the other hand, is a solemn film that is message.
I:11682;1200;the performances of Moore, Quaid, and Haysbert are all masterfully delivered.
I:11682;1201;The way in which Moore displays the character of Cathy makes her performance one of the year's best.
I:11682;1202;She is able to let the audience know that the kind.
I:11682;1203;hearted Cathy is actually masking her troubles with her faade that everything is perfect and in control without stating so.
I:11682;1204;Quaid, who normally plays characters of great masculinity, is astonishing as the homosexual Frank.
I:11682;1205;He is convincing, and is able to show the character's inability to mend his problems while instead bottling them up inside to the point of unbearable angst with great skill.
I:11682;1206;the filmmaking of the movie is exquisite.
I:11682;1207;Sandy Powell's authentic costume design, Mark Friedberg's sumptuous production design, Elmer Bernstein's wonderful score, and Edward Lachman's gorgeous cinematography all capture the cinematic feel of 1950's films, and the overall feel of the movie's messages with proficiency.
I:11682;1208;todd Haynes, who directed and wrote the screenplay to Far from Heaven, is certainly one of the most promising directors of our time.
I:11682;1209;Haynes handled everything about this movie with great ability and maturity.
I:11682;1210;the film, although it takes place in the 1950's, is quite relevant to the society of the present day.
I:11682;1211;Not everyone will enjoy the often.
