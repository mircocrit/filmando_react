1;This French film was the winner of the 1952 Academy Awards, and back then, it's easy to see how a tender subject during wartime can win the hearts of Academy Awards.
2;From there they are determined to give creatures a proper burial.
3;This family has temporarily adopted her.
4;It is about a deep friendship and the love for life, and a search for dignity in death.
5;It is not morbid, it is enlightening and through the eyes of the children.
6;as usual, children in foreign film have generally done wonderful performances.
7;See this, get the Criterion Collection.
8;See it with your children.
9;One of the first films to see the horrors of war through the eyes of children, Forbidden Games was a critical smash, winning prizes from the New York Film Critics, the British Academy, and the Venice Film Festival.
10;"But the portrait Forbidden Games paints of its adult characters is unsparingly disdainful
I:11271;11;For a story with the potential to drip with easy sentimentality (generous peasant family takes in adorable war orphan), Forbidden Games offers something more bracing: a clear.
I:11271;12;Nothing else in Clement's career matched the achievement of this classic.
I:11271;13;By inviting the viewer to interpret the weird things going on, and thus reveal his own heart and mind (the dark side of them).
I:11271;14;on the surface, if you disregard everything said above, the film is still beautiful and haunting.
I:11271;15;The charming little kids play their """"secret"""" games."""
16;The cinematography is gorgeous, the guitar (splendid 'Gardens of Aranjuez by Rodrigo) music is enchanting and the overall mixture of tragicomedy and macabre allegory is really haunting.
17;Every character (& groups of characters) is worth attention and study.
18;Forbidden Games deals with the reaction of a couple of children .
19;Because we have witnessed what Paullette has gone through.
20;whether this topic is analized as the simplicity of an ill influenced child's play, or through any psychological or mental connotations or meanings that could be applied, Forbidden Games is still, even today, a very original piece of cinema, that would hardly reach the same meaning if it's filmed today, without the context and recent history that influenced it back in 1952.
21;Ren Clement did the right thing with the material that was handed to him, and the story and its meaning is so powerful and well executed that can still be enjoyed today.
22;unlike what one might think about a movie made in 1952 and with children as the lead actors, acting is flawless.
23;I said that we never question the innocence of the children, and that is due in great part to the looks and great work of Briggitte Fossey and Georges Poujoly, whom give great credibility to that premise.
24;As usual, it's a commendable work of restoration in many senses: in the sense of allowing more people .
25;the original French soundtrack is included, along with the english dubbed, both of them monophonic.
26;"What is ""forbidden"" about the games that the children play has nothing to do with sex (the usual designation of ""forbidden"" in English)."
27;old Paulette (Brigitte Fossey) do that is forbidden is they steal crosses, from the cemetery, from the top of a horse.
28;war movie of incredible delicacy, laced with humor and poignancy.
29;She is so clean, they exclaim and she smells so good.
30;What transpires is a child's interpretation of the healing power of religious ritual and symbol.
31;cl ment uses the world of the children as a counterpoint to the war in the background and as a gentle satire on the church.
32;The children make a game of religion and in doing so demonstrate the healing power of ritual and sacrament.
33;what makes this totally original and deeply symbolic film work is the uncluttered and naturalistic vision of Cl ment and his wonderful direction of his two little stars.
34;Fossey in particular is amazing.
35;She is completely unaffected and natural, an adorable little girl suddenly alone in the world who must make a new world for herself against great odds.
36;Her sense of personal integrity and her strong will makes us believe that somehow she will succeed.
37;Incidentally, Fossey's performance here in conveying the creative world of the child should be compared with 4.
38;Both are deeply religious films that rely on the pre.
39;also very good is Poujouly as the farm boy who loves little Paulette and shows that love by assuming the psychological and spiritual responsibility for helping her to overcome the tragedy of being so brutally orphaned.
40;He is himself experiencing a pre.
41;adolescent coming of age, a transition exemplified by rebellion and a growing independence of mind and spirit.
42;Poujouly is intense and fully engaged, so much so that in one scene we can see him mouth in unison Paulette's lines in preparation for his time to speak.
43;this film won the Grand Prize at the Venice Film Festival in 1952 and an Academy Award the same year as best foreign film.
44;It is one of the wonders of the French cinema, a masterpiece of the human spirit not to be missed.
45;See it for the children, whose strength of character can inspire us all.
46;This movie is a masterpiece.
47;The child actors are sensational, the directing superb.
48;Even the musical score is hauntingly beautiful (Jeux Interdits by Narciso Yepes.
49;I read a review by Roger Ebert (he gave it a stunning review, of course) and he said it is not a tear.
50;Little Paulette and youthful Michel will likely never recover from their psychic wounds, while the shot of little Paulette wandering helplessly among the chaotic tide of refugees is one of the most quietly searing in film annals.
51;The film's brilliance lies in making us feel what she feels in a wholly unsentimental way.
52;Anyway, it's a testament to the mysteries of human personality that such a profoudly intuitive boy as Michel could emerge from such unpromising family fodder.
53;Much of it passes quickly and so is easily overlooked.
54;But it's there, particularly with the Brouard boy, and his lusty relationship with the older Dolle girl.
55;The graveyard scene between the feuding families also has a faintly comical undertone.
56;Anyway, look fast, because there are unexpected deposits of humor in an otherwise very somber story.
57;`Games', however remains a masterpiece of unadorned understatement.
58;Except for the rather stagey graveyard scene, it's told in simple and straightforward fashion, allowing audience emotions to build quietly until the final shattering scene.
59;All in all, it's very effective.
60;proof that something worthwhile has been shown on tv) and it really blew us away.
61;a Beautiful little film about a little girl orphaned by the war and adopted by a farming family.
62;she delelopes a very close frienship with the young boy of this family.
63;it is a really profound and moving film that has stayed with me ever since i saw it.yes, we loved and have been dying to see it ever since.
64;The only thing I dislike is that there's no spanish subtitles, but overall the packaging and the movie itself was really good.
65;Children's imagination and ways of playing during a period of war.
66;The sensitivity, creativity and feelings the films transmits.
67;"but the war and intolerance and narrow mindedness of the adults is the ""other forbidden game"" After all the second ""game"" created the first.Yes, this is an anti."
68;I thought the film was exceptional in every way .
69;the acting, the molding of music to events, the photography, the truth of the picture.
70;It is the equal of Hitchcock, the equal of Kurosawa, the equal of Kubrick's best pictures.

73;The director (and his wife) who helped to shape the film are to be commended for their ability to get such exceptional performances from ones so young.
74;"In France, Brigitte Fossey was awarded ""best actress"" ."
75;an achievement unmatched by any other five year old .
76;Oscars or otherwise.5 stars, ten stars, this is a picture that changes the way we look at the world.
77;I remembered it fondly and always wanted to see it again.
78;I finally splurged and got it last Christmas.
79;For a movie its age, the cinematography is still state of the art, and the acting is wonderfully refreshing.
80;Although I can see why younger viewers (such as myself as a kid) really loved this movie, it is still a treat for adults.
81;This film is a landmark in the story of the world cinema .
82;Its merciless mesage with a haunting and poignant script , means to the WW2 what the Great Illusion meant to WW1.
83;her intimate and beloved friend .
84;the countless qualities of this powerful movie make of it , one of the top ten French Films in any age and the best achievement of Rene Clement along his glorious career.
85;Simple yet human reactions children express in times of confusion.
86;The stark simplicity of Rene Clement's masterpiece makes it one of the more eloquent anti.
87;In a world gone mad, Michel and Paulette respond with an act of quiet kindness, which is their way of making sense of what is happening.
88;While clinging to childhood via their secret game, the two unwittingly reflect humanity's noblest traits in its darkest hour.
89;"This movie is a perfect example of why a person shouldn't judge a ""book"" by its cover."
90;She's too preoccupied with getting her dog Jock.
91;Death is the theme of the film and it is a theme that is hammered into the ground.
92;Anyone who watches this film should realize that it's a great film, but that doesn't always mean you'll enjoy it.
93;After all, a lot of great films aren't necessarily entertaining.
94;This film, however, is entertaining.
95;"If Jean Renoir's ""Grand Illusion"" was the most important film about World War I, than ""Forbidden Games"" is easily the most important about World War II."
96;It's a wonderful, beautifully photographed, and superbly acted film that is largely unseen today.
97;the bridge scene presents powerful and gripping symbolism in multiple ways.
98;Much of this sentiment emerges through the son Michel when he provides Paulette with what she desires.
99;She has developed her own idea that Jock should not rest alone in the little grave.
100;Without much thought, Michel provides all the help he can, as his childish infatuation with Paulette motivates him to do whatever it takes to ease her newly found agony.
101;It leads the story into a ghastly direction that stains the basic notion of children's innocence, but it also provides an intriguing proposition of how children learn from their environment.
102;ren Cl ment breaks the taboo of death and children by telling this story, but he does it tactfully and brilliantly through clever symbolism and remarkable scene framing.
103;In addition, he proposes that children display their view of the world through play.
104;Furthermore, children learn from those around them, as they begin to reflect on their own experiences.
105;Ultimately, it provides the foundation of a child's world perspective, and they begin to form their own ideas with or without guidance .
106;it arrived quickly and I viewed it twice the day I received it.
107;I found it to be an intensely interesting film as a charming tale of childhood innocence in the face of unfathomable loss.
108;Of course, it helps that Michel is there for her in her time of greatest need.
109;both child stars, Brigette Fossey and Georges Poujouly are superb in their respective roles as Paulette and Michel, and director Rene Clement managed to wring equally superb performances from the remainder of the major players.
110;The haunting score by Narciso Yepes imbues the film with the aura of happy sadness that makes the movie so satisfying .
111;Also appealing are the glimpses of French farm life in the bucolic countryside and the comical relationship the Dolles have with their neighbors.
112;i recommend this edition of Forbidden Games to all who wish to own one.
113;Because the Criterion Collection edition provides the extras that give value for money.
114;Clement often comes across as a pompous popinjay, but Fossey is thoroughly charming and forthcoming in her commentary.
115;There are also alternative beginnings and endings which while interesting, were thankfully dropped for the ones that made the final cut.
116;A couple of other extras add just a bit more value as well.
117;Masterful film on innocence in the face of harsh adult realities.
118;Heartbreaking and memorable, this is a film I had to own and share.
119;It is however, very well made movie by especially the young actors in the film and incredible setting and detail.
120;Filmed beautifully in black and white, many scenes are haunting and will leave you room to imagine.
121;This beautiful movie with beautiful music was match made in heaven that will captivate and inspire you.
122;The Bottom Line:A wonderful, simple story of two children during wartime who become friends and attempt to understand war and death, Forbidden Games is an accessible and involving story that culls good performances from its young leads and ends on an appropriately downbeat note: it's quite a film.
123;Dolles welcome Paulette into their family, while she and Michel forge a strange bond.
124;Forbidden Games is a great movie that somehow manages to be cynical and unrelenting in its realism, even as it stays sweet and sentimental on the surface.
125;"The way this movie weaves drama, social commentary and comedy into a perfectly subtle and disturbing little fable reminded me of another great French title released by Criterion: ""Le Corbeau""."
126;"Watching ""Forbidden Games"" will almost certainly make you want to see other films by Rene Clement."
127;I completely relate to this film.
128;It's certainly, of anything, a better and much more interesting take on what innocence really means.
129;Hollywood film critic, Leonard Maltin, nails it with this movie.
130;"The child stars of ""Forbidden Games"" (Juex Interdits) absolutely blew me away!"
131;The acting was so superb!
132;Although a war drama, I think that it was a great comedy film, too.
133;The two child actors provided the best lines.
134;and the scene where Paulette (played by Brigette Fossey) buried and blessed her deceased dog was one of the most outrageous and funniest things I had ever seen.
135;It was a delight to hear throughout the entire film.
136;And though I really enjoyed Yepes's playing, I still prefer Christopher Parkening's rendition of this beautiful tune.
137;I especially love the comment Clement made during his 1963 interview.
138;"Those are the great actors."""
139;Forbidden Games will definitely be considered as Christmas gifts for both family and friends.
140;I highly recommend watching it.
141;Ultimately, this is one cinema classic you don't want to miss!
142;star movies on that list is closer to one percent than to two.
143;There are the films that are, simply, perfect: the acting and directing are impeccable, the soundtrack complements the action precisely, the cinematography is grand without being grandiose, etc., etc.
144;The three movies at the very top of my thousand.
145;is it a perfect film?
146;Instead, it is a gentle comedy, though oddly I have never seen anyone else call it a comedy.
147;"is pretty darned simple
I:11271;148;straddling which is in itself worthy of great praise.)
I:11271;149;It is beautiful and funny and gentle and sad and thought.
I:11271;150;It is a masterpiece of filmmaking like we rarely see, and as far as I'm concerned, it's one of the greatest films ever made.
I:11271;151;simple in its premise and brilliant in its execution, the somewhat inaccurately titled story is set in World War II France.
I:11271;152;amazing naturalistic performances from the two child stars helped secure a much deserved 1952 Oscar for Best Foreign Film.
I:11271;153;forbidden Games informs our most basic experience of what it means to be alive .
I:11271;154;more urgent and relevant than ever.
I:11271;155;Touching story of two children deserved its Academy Award for best foreign language film.
I:11271;156;And now I can see it again, and share it with my wife (a Frenchwoman) and our friends, as I most certainly will.
I:11271;157;Something you'll feel better to possess, to have as your own.
I:11271;158;a moving film with two wonderful child actors, Forbidden Games is depressing but very well done.
I:11271;159;It is a strong arguement against war and a plea for war orphans everywhere.
I:11271;160;Director Ren Cl ment utilizes an untraditional way of opening and closing his film.
I:11271;161;In this way, we are presented with a slice of life and are able to relate better to the story and to the characters.
I:11271;162;in spite of the grim subject, there are a few moments of humor, even in spite of the seriousness of the actions.
I:11271;163;Laughter in times of crisis is often therapeutic, and Cl ment gives us a few of those moments.
I:11271;164;The little girl, who ever she is, and who ever she grew up to be, is absolutely outstanding.
I:11271;165;For any person that loves old films, this is a gem.
I:11271;166;The ending will break your heart.
I:11271;167;this is a very nice film and I recommend it highly.
I:11271;168;In the end the drama of war is heightened in a famous climax.
I:11271;169;A good point of the previous reviewer: blood and gore can be effective, but this deceivingly innocent story unfolds into an immensely poignant statement.
I:11271;170;The movie is so lyrical, the children's acting so heartfelt, the inevitability of loss so heartbreaking.
I:11271;171;It's really a rare moment in cinema when kids can be depicted as what they are and who they are with such innocence.
I:11271;172;I wouldn't say this is the best film i ever saw, but this is one of the most realistic and touching films i have seen about children.
I:11271;173;It was really heartbreaking to see their sadness and loneliness, and yet inspiring to see how they cope with it in a clever and spiritual way.
I:11271;174;The greatest thing about it is that it all looked natural, it didn't even seem as if these children were really acting.
I:11271;175;The Criterion Collection has issued a superb transfer of Rene Clement's masterpiece about how warfare affects children, """"Forbidden Games."""""""
176;"It's a fine piece of filmmaking by the director of such works as ""Gervaise"" (Maria Schell in the Emile Zola novel), ""Purple Noon"" (Alain Delon in the first of the three ""Ripley"" films), and the all."
177;At the end, the sorrow is so profound you will sit there speechless.
178;And the director has drawn from little Fossey and Poujouly performances of great beauty.
179;Judges at the Venice Film Festival were wowed enough to name the five.year.
180;old the Best Actress of 1952 (the adult Fossey is interviewed in a disc extra.)
181;Forbidden Games also won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, a slam.
182;"The movie ""Forbidden Games"" title came from the war the adult Play and how the world and childlen got effected."
