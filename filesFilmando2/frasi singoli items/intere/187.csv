7;Every action of his has a meaning and behind an immediate plan, he has a backup.
8;"michael Lonsdale as the quaint Detective Lebel is probably the most ""uncharacteristic"" hero in any movie."
9;and that itself is a tribute to this superb actor.
10;He displays coolness in equal measure to the Jackal and comes across as a shy and timid man.
11;His character is one of intelligence, resourcefulness and humility on one side with a quiet steely determination and resolve on the other.
12;And Lonsdale is magnificent in displaying all of these aspects.
13;together these two protagonists take an already exciting thriller to an explosive finale that is hard to imitate.

84;Edward Fox is perfect as the Jackal and is great throughout the picture.
85;Everything about the film is very good, and the usage of realism throughout pays off rich dividends.
86;The entire film is a wonderful game of cat and mouse between the police and the extremely intelligent killer.
87;How do you begin to stop such a killer?Edward Fox plays the Jackal as a sophisticated, highly intelligent killer that does not make mistakes.
88;Watching him go through his job routine is amazing.
89;We feel like we are actually watching and learning his secrets of the trade.
90;What makes the movie so fun to watch is the writing of these two characters.
91;The detective is just as good at his job as the Jackal is at his.
92;Day of the Jackal has so many outstanding qualities because it was made by one of the great masters of film, Fred Zinnemann.
93;This was Zinnemann's first film in seven years after a long line of great films.
94;Many consider this his best.
95;Every scene is very precisely planned, yet (as many have already mentioned) each scene looks as if it belongs in a documentary.
96;A great story expertly handled.
97;The script by Kenneth Ross is even better than the novel.
98;The final race against time, is expertly filmed and edited.
99;The American version of this story is a sad, sad second to this tense and brilliant film.

101;the acting is great, direction is very concise with no wastedfootage, the story moves well, it is brilliantly photographed,casting is first class, the script is excellent, and in the endit turns out the way we want it to turn out.
102;Modernmovie makers should watch Day of the Jackel and see how it should be done.
103;That is NOT the way to see this film, for this is an extremely well.
104;As mentioned, the editing is excellent.

108;And while the former is interesting, the latter of these is most fascinating with Edward Fox as the star of the show.
109;it's fascinating to see him move through the motions of obtaining multiple identities, obtain and prepare the weapon, and plan the attack.
110;(The campy d cor of the Frenchman's flat is hilarious!)
111;this is a very quiet film with little music, giving it a documentary ambiance and an high seriousness.

114;"This is a rattling good yarn, superbly told, no messing
I:24918;115;The structure is V shaped: a very wide gap to start with, growing narrower by the hour, until the two tracks finally converge to a point: a bullet.
I:24918;116;The direction has a lot in common with Zinnemann's other masterpiece, High Noon, where, in effect, we are also assured of the outcome.
I:24918;117;In one film it's the good man against the rest"
118;The key moment comes just after he's told his cover is blown.
119;He lets emotion get the upper hand, and carries on to Paris, which is not the sensible decision for a wise percentage player.
120;Zinnemann has this great sense of what will work, what is necessary and what isn't, and how to be economical and cost.
121;This is an outstanding movie, filled with drama, great action and superb acting.
122;Fox is wonderful in this film.
123;The locations and the cinematography are excellent.
124;And the tension and excitement are so well scripted.
125;The intense hunt by the Surete (French police unit) to prevent what you know isn't going to happen makes an amazingly taut, excellent movie.
126;I have to first admit that I love this genre.
127;This adaptation does a credible job of sustaining the tension throughout the movie though some of the Jackal's actions require you to not be too skeptical.
128;Still, the acting overall is solid and I found the lack of big name stars refreshing and allowed me to focus on simply enjoying the film.
129;A great way to spend 2 hours and, at least in part, based on a true story.
130;As a product of the sixties, I really got a kick out of this movie and felt like I was back in time.
131;It is an accurate representation of that time period.
132;The best political thriller ever made, comparable to, but better than, The Manchurian Candidate and All The President's Men.
133;The excellent performances by all concerned, the historical background introduced in the opening few minutes and the location filming create a riveting, masterful film.
134;Nothing to beat it since in my opinion.
135;Very good acting on almost everyone's part.

140;The book is so infinitely better than the movie, that I would not see it until after reading it.

145;Seeing it again after many years I find that it has held up well.
146;I love the James Bond series for what it is, fantasy, but this movie has a much more real.

151;The Jackal's (Fox) demands are few, but very specific, and his price is high, as his reasoning is that this type of job is a career ender, based on the level of importance of the target.
152;i really enjoyed this lengthy film.
153;Zinnemann does a wonderful job showing both sides of the story, that of the assassin, and that of the authorities intent on stopping him, the two stories slowly converging to create a climatic conclusion.
154;Also, it's worth the payoff as the last 20 or 30 minutes are really worth waiting for.
155;i really liked how the Jackal was able to keep a few steps ahead of the authorities (with a little help), anticipating danger and making the appropriate compensating actions.
156;The detective work was presented as thorough, comprehensive, and intelligent.
157;The use of locations, mostly in France, but also in England, Austria, and Italy, was wonderful, and added so much flavor and credibility to the story.
158;All in all, a great adaptation, and a great film.
159;"Fred Zinnemann did an masterful job directing this outstanding adaptation of Frederick Forsyth's political thriller ""The Day of the Jackal""."
160;Using a documentary style with impressive cinematography based in part around Paris, the plot involves a cunningly developed plan to assassinate President Charles de Gaulle.

165;This movie has mega suspense and the assassin (Fox) is one of the coolest killers to ever grace the big screen.
166;The book was great, the movie is better.
167;A great example of 60s and 70s espionage films.
168;this is a truly great movie.
169;The plot is riveting and screen writing is flawless.
170;The movie shows how the Jackal goes to great lengths and uses ingenious methods in attempting to assassinate de Gaulle.
171;Likewise, the police authorities use intelligence and tireless detective work to track him down which builds up to a great ending.
172;You will feel this kind of atmosphere in this film with the difference that Zinnemann worked with a solid gold screenplay.
173;The sound is, in my opinion, the best we can expect from a 1973 movie.
174;As a suspense thriller this movie rates as one of thebest.
175;One can feel the tension and suspense.
176;As an avid Frederick Forsyth fan I have collected all of the movies made of his novels.
177;The Day of the Jackal is by far the best adaptation.
178;Excellent performances, particularly by Edward Fox and Michel Lonsdale, make this edge of your seat thriller totally believable.
179;Those who lived through the tumultuous sixties will appreciate both the villians and heros in this fine film.

I:24918;184;Rarely does a movie do justice to a book, but Fred Zinneman's production of The Day of the Jackal is wonderful adaptation of Frederick Forsyth's novel which, I continue to believe, is one of the greatest thrillers ever written.
I:24918;185;it's hard to put a finger on what exactly makes this film great: excellent performances by relatively unknown actors, a wonderful plot, fantastic location shooting or a complete desire to avoid the bells and whistles, special effects laden movies that are all that makes up the suspense genre of films these days.
I:24918;186;The young Edward Fox is brilliant in the title role and the supporting cast excellent.
I:24918;187;if anything, this film proves that you do not need big named stars, explosions around every corner or computer generated effects to make a fantastic film.
I:24918;188;They stole the show in a cast of super Brits .

I:24918;190;firmly setting their star potential.
I:24918;191;the film is a tight production, nearly boarding on documentary.
I:24918;192;But you are in two minds, actually.
I:24918;193;Fox is so winning in the performance, fleshing out the Jackal just not as a coldblooded killer, but as a man, so you oddly almost root for him to succeed, at the same time cheering for him to fail.
I:24918;194;Great film based on a great book.
I:24918;195;Frederick Forsyth's best book made into an excellent and exciting movie .
I:24918;196;I enjoyed the plot and scenary very well.
I:24918;197;If you like older spies movies were you actually have to think this is a good one.
I:24918;198;I have seen this film at least three times, over a period of years, and I really liked iit each time.
I:24918;199;It is one of my favorites because it is a story of riveting intrigue that captured my undivided attention throughout the film.
I:24918;200;I want to watch it again on a rainy afternoon sometime.
I:24918;201;Then by all means check out THE DAY OF THE JACKAL, an intriguing film made over 30 years ago, based on Frederick Forsyth's exceptional novel of the same name.
I:24918;202;The French authorities learn of the plan and dispatch their best investigator, Inspector Lebel (Michel Lonsdale), to capture the Jackal and prevent the assassination.
I:24918;203;until their paths cross in a thrilling and riveting conclusion.
I:24918;204;fox and Lonsdale are wonderful.
I:24918;205;As the Jackal, Fox makes this cold and calculating killer absolutely believable, while Lonsdale lends a comic vulnerability to his role as the often.

I:24918;207;Unknown to him, a very smart, mild.
I:24918;208;The Jackal is an extraordinarily cunning individual who is capable of very convincing disguises.
I:24918;209;the cinematography in this film is almost stunning.
I:24918;210;The European locations, especially Paris, are beautifully filmed and the color is gorgeous but also realistic.
I:24918;211;This is an interesting and suspenseful movie with an excellent script.
I:24918;212;The Day of the Jackel not to be confused with the inferior remake """"The Jackel"""", is a marvelous character study of the coldest, coolest, most illusive and highly skilled assassin ever brought to the silver screen."""
213;With a superior cast headed by Edward Fox, and an outstanding script, this movie plunges the viewer in a riveting cat.
214;The tension builds wonderfully as the Jackel, a man of brilliant disguises, nears his prey (Charles de Gaulle) with the intrepid constable a step behind.

I:24918;219;Ultimately, I found the pace and atmosphere to my liking, having seen a few similar movies.
I:24918;220;I have seen it twice and really enjoy it If you like films of this sort you will enjoy this one.
I:24918;221;I liked the characters, acting was very good (it wasnt what I would call an all star cast but you dont need that if the story and pace are good) Worth looking into, and for 10.00 why not give it a try.

223;For the rest of the mission, he will rely on his own skills and cunning.
224;Much of the interest of the movie is in watching the Jackel stay one step ahead of the pursuing police and security services led by one Claude Lebel, a French policeman (and well.
225;The Day of the Jackel is very highly recommended to fans of good movie drama, especially those who were less than satisfied with the 1997 adaptation, which had almost nothing to do with the original novel or this movie.
226;This is simply a great adventure film.
227;It possesses a simple story.
228;So they unload the job onto their best detective.
229;This story moved at a rapid pace.
230;A film with so many characters and storylines seldom succeeds but nobody really carries this film.
231;Instead the entire cast provides the film with enormous support.
232;Everybody is assingned a job and everybody does it well.
233;Because of that, I can tell you it was packaged well and I will most likely order similar items again.
234;This is a great movie.
235;From the opening newsreel type shots of France and Algiers to the dual stories of the planning of the assassination attempt and the attempt to thwart it, this film delivers a thrilling exxperience.
236;Of course, we know he fails, but the buildup to the climax is extremely well.
237;I simply love this film.
238;What makes it great is that we follow the Jackal as he goes through every aspect of his planning to murder De Gaulle.
239;That is simply great writing to make the audience root for the bad guy.
240;The outstanding script to this movie is by Kenneth Ross and one reason the picture works so well is its scrupulous adherence to the source novel ,not only in broad outline but in precise detail.
241;the intricate storyline switches between tow strands .
242;thanks to BAFTA winning editing from the admirable Ralph Kempen and the taut suspenseful direction from veteran director Fred Zinnemann .
243;the movie works through methodical accumulation of detail and the plan has the ring of authenticity as does the whole movie.
244;fox is outstanding as the methodical but heartless Jackal and his performance is the ramrod of the movie .
245;lonsdale is also fine as the pursuer and achieves the hard task of making a dull but dedicated man into a hero whose job is his life.
246;just a battle of wits and will between two powerful adversaries .
247;it is a superb movie, a suspense filled political thriller from the top drawer
248;Let's just take a snapshot of that city in that era and step right in.
249;And Edward Fox walking around looking so cool in that perfectly tailored lightweight worsted wool beige suit, so well mixed and matched for his needs.
250;Michael Lonsdale is the dectective, Lebel, who chases him right up to the finish.
251;I love the line Lebel says when asked.
252;i know that the movie is great .
253;It is great for French 1's since it shows the Elyesee Palace, Paris street scenes, border crossings, airports, both in the UK and the continent, plus the staging of the 14th of July parade in Paris.
254;This is a great movie, it keeps you on the edge of your seat!
255;It engages the viewer from start to finish and is an exciting ride all the way.
256;The great performances by the principal players make it a fascinating story with no dull spots.
257;still the movie is captivating because of its study of the meticulousness with which Jackal plans and executes it.
258;still the film evokes interest about how does he operate and takes viewers with him in this cat and mouse game.
259;on the other side, chase and planning of the detectives and Govt officials makes the film more interesting.
260;the choice of an ordinary face as Jackal helped it also as did the moving between beautiful locations of England, France and Italy.
261;in gist, a gripping, interesting and enjoyable film .
262;So Frederick Forsyth does a fine job in creating the suspense that leads to the thrilling conclusion.
263;budget feel that Speilberg subsequently brought to blockbusters.
264;but all in all, this is a good film, a taut thriller that has you half.
265;hoping the Jackal is successful in his objective.
266;And it's extraordinary to see Derek Jacobi (who would star in I Claudius four years later), in such a minor role!
267;"The initial symbolic drumbeat for ""Algerie Francais"" is a marvelous opener."
268;on so many levels, the movie is great entertainment: the unfolding of the plot with almost journalistic detail, the characters involved, the pace of action, the scenery.
269;And Cyril Cusack's portrayal of the armorer is pure perfection.
270;One is left with great empathy for all the characters portrayedAdjudged even 40 years later, Forsyth and Zinnemann set a great standard!

274;The writing, directing and acting are lean and direct, the visual style is spare, efficient, exceptionally effective.
275;It's thoroughly enjoyable to watch the incredible lengths that the film's heroes and anti.
276;heroes go through to achieve their objectives.
277;And more impressive is the film's precise relevance today, in our age of terrorism, even though it was released 35 years ago.
278;An eerie tale, to say the least.
279;the cast is superb from top to bottom, and the director and editors deftly let you into the minds of both the Jackal and the Inspector .
280;keeping you fully engaged with each one's strategies and skills.
281;It has great dialogue, hardly any explosions, great tension, realistic action, excellent direction, excellent performances, and a satisfying ending.
282;This is by far the best spy thriller I have ever seen.
283;The attention to details is just amazing.
284;Acting is very good, plot is excellent, and directing is great.
285;It is amazing how dedicated and professional both Lebel and the Jackal are.
286;One is the bad guy, and the other is the good guy, and yet you cannot help but have respect for both of them.
287;No bells and whistles here, just pure storytelling at its best.
288;please watch this movie an all time winner better by far than the book.
289;This move was one of the best (if not the best) suspense thrillers ever made.
290;The most moving aspect of this film was the realism of the assassin played by Edward Fox.
291;It takes a special breed of actors to play a good believable hit man and Bruce Willis is not one of them.
292;When I saw the Movie The Jackel after seeing The Day of the Jackel I actually laughed at Bruce Willis.
293;I had remembered viewing this movie when it first came out.
294;Recently I found a copy of the book and read it for the first time.
295;"I've always enjoyed Forsyth's books, particularly ""The Odessa File""."
296;This movie is a classic, but I hadn't seen it in a while.
297;Never the less, it still is a great story and an enjoyable movie that gives insight into a post.

I:24918;309;this is the first and best version!
I:24918;310;Altough this film has a plausible and entertaining storyline, it is a whimsical and naive tale of intrigue for the modern viewer.
I:24918;311;As a background for the much more plausible and exciting remake ( The Jackal with Bruce Willis and Richard Gere) it is an interesting historical study.
I:24918;312;This is the ultimate thinking person's thriller.
I:24918;313;Edward Fox is perfect for the role.
I:24918;314;He is charming, cunning, very dangerous, and a master of disguises, continuously slipping in and out of other peoples' identities to achieve his ends.
I:24918;315;The French government's efforts to unmask and catch the Jackal, while he is constantly eluding them, is truly nail biting.
I:24918;316;By the conclusion of this very exciting film one cannot be certain whether the Jackal was really an Englishman, as was believed by the organization that hired him.
I:24918;317;This is simply one of the best action films ever made.
I:24918;318;Beautiful cinematography, good story and great shots of a 70s Europe.
I:24918;319;And w/ no major actors to idolize in this film, the story line just hums along like James Bond's Aston Martin"
320;The ending is a Amazing.
321;Even if you dont like spy movies you will love this movie.
322;Conglomeration of French and British cinematography with Fox portraying the pathological hit man.
323;Movie has it all, great acting, terrific plot, perfect flow, and wonderful camera work.
324;much better than the remake.
325;Even 40 years later, it's easy to understand the historical setting.
326;One of the rare films that surpasses the book it is based on.
327;In addition we need some special features: the making of the film, historical background to the story and a biography of Fred Zinneman.
328;captured and held the imagination.
329;Shot on location across Europe.
330;Both main actors are still alive (and indeed, active) so perhaps one or both could be enticed to provide commentary for a new release?
331;The movie is a great story, but don't know what happened with the rating.
332;Along with Forsyth's Odessa File, Marathon Man and a handful of others, this ranks among the very best manifestations of an otherwise tasteless epoch.
333;i watch this movie every year or so and enjoy it immensely every time.
334;There is such nuance in the acting, art direction, narrative structure and then.
335;It really is a phenomenal movie.
336;The Day of the Jackal is a prime example of an increasingly rare breed .
337;key action film that is actually willing to respect the intelligence of its audience.
338;It is a sign of the story's effectiveness that, even though the majority of the audience will (hopefully) be aware that DeGaulle ended his service as France's President without being killed, the film still manages to hold the viewer's attention in a mixture of heart.
339;pounding suspense and fascination with watching such a realistic presentation of how a political assassination might very well had been pulled off.
340;They are never more or less than recognizable human beings and that makes the film's story all the more enthralling.
341;Instead of filling the film with audience.
342;zinnemann was always known as a brilliant director of actors and the performances in The Day of the Jackal (from a collection of reliable English and French character actors) are flawless.
343;"Though his character is usually overshadowed by the more charismatic Jackal, Lonsdale does a good job as the film's nominal ""hero,"" making this anonymous detective into a sort of everyman."
344;Fox has been typecast as stuffy, aristocratic types so it is a bit of a revelation to see his performance here.
345;He manages to perfectly convey the coldness of a man without a soul while, at the same time, providing glimpes of a neurotic intensity that would come from living a life that is centered totally and completely on death.
346;Fox creates a sympathetic screen villian without ever allowing the Jackal to become Lecterized .
347;This movie is simply amazing.
348;The detail and incredable lengths he goes to in order to get the job done is amazing, and completely believeable at the same time.
349;His adversary, the detective, who's name eludes me at the moment is equally fit to the role.
350;i love the ending, and it reminds me quite a bit of Agatha Christie's endings.
351;anyway you can see it, see it.
352;It is a great film that will instantly become one of your favorites!
353;One of my favorite films.
354;Essentially the plot is lifted intact from Frederick Forsyth's wonderful novel involving the herculean task given a mid level police inspector to track down and stop an unknown assassin from killing Charles de Gaulle, then president of France.
355;while the story is riveting, the cinematography is superb, wonderful French and Italian scenery.
356;"a great film
I:24918;357;Beautifully directed by Fred Zimmerman who was one of the best!
I:24918;358;Excellent cast including Edward Fox and Derek Jacob pre.
I:24918;359;Also wonderful photography of the French countryside.
I:24918;360;It's one of those rare films where you have as much respect for the villan as you do the good guy.
I:24918;361;Fox is incredible as the Jackal and even though you knew the ending, ala Apollo 13, the intensity was there none the less.
I:24918;362;In my opinion, the best espionage film of all time.
I:24918;363;This an excelent film which I recomend to my serious friends.
I:24918;364;not to mention Michel Lonsdale, the best.
I:24918;365;Great movie about an International assassin who has liquidated dictators, top government officialsis NOT KNOWN and had to be identified through the expertise of a French DetectiveFurther comments not possible since .
I:24918;366;director fred zinnimann's """"day of the jackal"""" is a rare movie,it stays close to the book and it treats it's viewers like they have a brain."""
367;they pick the jackal because he's the best and he always gets the job done.
368;edward fox is just right as the cool killer who takes his work very serious.
369;this thriller willkeep you glued to it til the very end.
370;avery well made movie not to be missed!
371;Director Zinnemann brings Frederick Forsyth's bestseller to vivid life, weaving this dense, suspenseful yarn towards a breathtaking climax.
372;Conveying a cunning and colorless anonymity, Fox is perfectly cast as The Jackal, and the intrepid, dog.
373;He is a meticulous and clever planner, a tactician, who hires a forger to fake documents and an armorer to design a special sniper rifle that can be assembled from small sections and easily concealed.
374;All the steps of his preparation for his assassination are documented, using guile and disguises, and along the way he has to dispatch people who get in his way.
375;the French investigation unit led by the unassuming but sharp.
376;He's a flashy dresser and sports an ascot.
377;it's a movie that engrosses the viewer, with a clever, complex plot, well acted, and beautifully photographed with great shots of European sites.
378;Great movie, loved it so very much.
379;Nemeless and faceless , The killer , known by the code name Jackal (Edward Fox 1937. )
380;A truly British Masterpiece of a well done novel and skilled director !
381;The positive impression I had remained for all this time.
382;And was reinforced after I saw it again yesterday.
383;This, the direction, camera movement on the streets makes you believe you're watching a documentary.
384;Such a plot deserved a higher production at the time, in my opinion.
385;He is unknown to the gendarme, who are on his trail early, with the help of an informer on the inside, but eventually his appearance becomes known to them.
386;written by Frederick Forsyth and directed by Fred Zinneman, perhaps this film was predestined for greatness, but in any case it is one of the great ones.
387;Great dramatization of a story of the events of the earlier post ww2 time frame.
388;This fine, riveting film is a thousand times better than that disjointed pile of schlock starring Demi Moore's ex.
389;This is a classic as far as I am concerned.
390;The Bruce Willis version is okay but this Edward Fox version is the best.
391;Whatever you ask for a first class political thriller you will find in this excellent film.
392;The Day of the Jackal is one of those uncommon movies that you are eager to see again, and again and again.
393;Another great Fred Zinneman film.
394;Love the detective and always love Derek Jacobi.
395;Charles Fox is brilliant as the assassin, charming, ruthless, a complete professional.
396;Bruce Willis gave it a good try in the updated version of The Day of the Jackal but the origonal remsins the best.
397;It takes the time to reveal the elements of the plan, the why and the end result.
398;This movie is much more believable than the updated version.
399;Looks pretty good but, being streaming, it subject to being downgraded.
400;_Day of the Jackal_ is one of the best film adaptations of a book ever done, the directors managed to keep the vital elements of the plot and the pacing of the book and successfully transfer them from one medium to another.
401;There are some wonderful moments of irony such as when the leader of the French terrorists says that no soldier of France will ever raise a weapon against him and then is shown being shot by firing squad the next day.
402;This is an outstanding film that can be watched over and over again.
403;The hunt for the Jackel keeps you on the edge of your sit.
404;The Day of the Jackal is truly one of the great classic espionage films of the 20th Century.
405;I have reviewed both The Day of the Jackal, and the new edition The Jackal with Bruce Willis, and I have to truly say that the older edition (Day of the Jackal) with Edward Fox is a much better and more richer film in terms of the script, the plot, the characters, and more specifically Edward Fox is a much better reflection of the true assassin that William Forsyth created in his novel.
406;this is one of the best movies ever made.
407;deGaulle for many reasons but especially for his politics in Algiers, has numerous attempts on his life.
408;Just great stuff with great acting by then unknowns, several of whom didn't act again.
409;This is an excellent movie.
410;crafted and the details are fascinating.
411;I enjoy the process of the search.
412;Movie time line well done.
413;With NSA and computer tracking, such wonderful movies/books/scripts would never be made.
414;Suspense and intrigue at its best.
415;They realize they are now under intense surveillance by French security and intelligence and must go outside France to hire a professional killer.
416;It keeps you on the edge of your seat, building to the climactic 'Day of the Jackal' when DeGaulle is to be assassinated.
417;It is based on the cleverness and genius of the assassin as well as the intuition and perseverance of Investigator Lebel.
418;Both are obsessed with their jobs and are up to the challenge.
419;An Englishman is hired, and thanks to a conniving female sympathizer that seduces one of the top French police leaders, the terrorist group know how the efforts to protect De Gaulle are proceeding.
420;It's a stone wall for them at first.
421;An amazing plot wich a foreign killer was hired to kill President Charles DeGaulle.
422;"A great plot with the ""Jackal""beeing played by Edward Fox."
423;an essencial piece of art for collectors, directed byacclaimed director Fred Zinnermman.
424;The Forsyth book was excellent, but had nuances that could not be translated to the screen.
425;this is one of my all time favorite movies.
426;i love the cast, especially edward fox, who is one of my favorite actors.
427;the plot is beautifully worked out and really captures the essence of the political climate in france during the degaulle era.
428;Well, I just viewed this movie the other night.
429;it has all the elements of a great spy/drama movie.
430;"All the killing is ""tasteful""."
431;Comparing this to the version with Bruce Willis go with this one.
432;I imagine it is more true to the book.
433;This is a masterpiece by any standard.
434;The plot is perfect and the film is shot on location throughout Europe with no more than a bare minimum of dialogue.
435;There is efficiency to the storytelling that respects the audience by demanding the application of its intelligence.
436;A detail worth mentioning is that the the director had the courage to use shoulder.
437;making on par with Stanley Kubrik's.
438;Day of the Jackal is a film for intelligent adults.
439;When the movie came out, I beat a line to the theatre to watch Edward Fox play a cunning Jackal out to assinate Charles DeGall.
440;The movie was well done and had some of Englands finest actors in it.
441;One of the great cloak and dagger films hi.
442;lighting a coup detat scheme that probably resemble true life.
443;The fill seques into a marvelous detective theme that is excellently portrayed.
444;It is funny that a movie which originally was a book has so little words, especially in the end.
445;That is exactly what makes this movie so good because Zinneman has pulled it off making a book into a movie but doing it so well that the movie can stand on it's own.
446;A great film adaptation of a great novel by Frederick Forsyth.
447;It is a great performance .
448;The great thing about this film is that it assumes a high level of intelligence and sophistication of the viewer.
449;Great story by a terrific writer and the movie is pretty close to the book.
450;Edward Fox is the Jackal and he does a pretty good assassin portrayal.
451;The movie was made in the early 60s and the scenery is fun and so are the styles and cars.
452;The acting and casting are excellent, as is the buildup of suspense throughout, even though we know how it will end.
453;Frederick Forsyth's book is excellent, but packed with enough detail to make filming difficult.
454;The makers of this film succeed brilliantly, Watch for a young Derek Jakobi in an important supporting role.
455;see for anyone who likes thrillers or mysteries.
456;see for anyone who likes good movies of whatever genre.
457;You actually feel like you are watching a professional assassin, minute by minute, this movie is f*&king cool, man.
458;movies don't get better than this, sorry, but this is definitely one of the great ones, ever.
459;this by far is one of the best most serious movies ive seen will be in my top collection this was the first movie and later a remake called the jackal with top actors both are suberb movies i like watching the both on a rainy day this is the kind of movies i live for
460;The film, like it should, starts slowly and build on layers of plot to an exciting trans.
461;the original film was a full night's entertainment at the movies, and was shown in two parts with an interval between them.
462;Have watched it many times and still enjoy it.
463;And so is the rest of the somewhat unknown cast.
464;Enjoyed every bit of it.
465;And the French Police, always a tad late, like the US cavalry coming to the aide of the settlers from the indians.
466;And now I must retire for a spot of tea.
467;This is a mostly terrific film with, IMO, some awful moments of acting/scripting/directing.
468;It is one of my most.
469;I also really dislike the strutting, bantam.
470;rooster style of star Edward Fox.
471;The film survives this because it is basically a lonely.
472;the film is niftily embedded in a real and fascinating historical moment to which it is very true.
473;In fact, the remarkable, long, dialog.
474;enactment of a real attempt on De Gaulle's life, is brilliant film.
475;And he was wise to stick close to the Forsyth novel, which is superb.
476;Even though I will give him some hard shots in a moment, this film is remarkable for telling so much of this story cinematically and so thoroughly entertaining us while doing so.
477;It is classic in its tautness, the steady build.
478;up of tension, and the exciting climax.
479;Then Fox rubs his eyes with great weariness and switches off his light.
480;It is by far a better movie than the recent remake by Bruce and company.
481;This is not a bad thing, but I prefer the classic.
482;It is almost perfect in its casting, acting, scripting, editing, directing, and scoring.
483;What cinematic edifice can withstand the winds of your imagination?
484;The Day of the Jackal is a film to keep you on the edge of your seat throughout.
485;This, and the acting ability of Edward Fox, makes this film an absolute must.
486;Go back several decades and we have some great manhunt movies, with this film being one of the best.
487;The acting is fairly good given that the cast is made of mostly unknowns.
488;The cinematography is good, giving the audience glimpses of Europe's beauty.
489;All in all, a great movie.
490;This movie is a top notch, tense political thriller, set in the era of Charles de Gaulle's ruled France of the early 1960's.
491;the fine British actor Edward Fox brilliantly portrays the cold hearted hired assassin called 'the Jackal' by the French police.
492;michel Lonsdale as 'Lebel' is superb, as is Alan Badel as 'The Minister', coupled with Michel Auclair playing the part of 'Colonel Rolland'.
493;The rest of the cast is equally casted, all doing a great job.
494;this movie is very realistic.
495;state automobile, is an additional 'actor' in this picture.
496;The director and actors are superb.
497;A fine thriller sure to please.
498;It is very photogenic and is good suspence even if you know how it ends.
499;It is like a tour of France and Italy to watch this movie.
500;A great suspense thriller where the audience is gripped by both the elusive assassin's stealth as well as the chief inspector's tenacity.
501;Ardently opposed to DeGaulle are many top military officers who've formed a conspiracy to remove him from power: by assassination if necessary.
502;the film is fast paced and brings the audience into the cat.
503;The film follows both the assassin and his pursuer until the climactic ending.
504;The gripping screenplay is brought to life by the great acting talents of the actors as well as a competent director.
505;altogether a great political suspense thriller that is all the more convincing because its mostly true.
506;A great film to own or watch numerous times.
507;The Willis version is a fine movie.
508;Much better story line, better acting, and much better story line!
509;This is a great thriller which keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout.
510;The way in which the assassin's route towards his intended victim is portrayed is riveting.
511;Great casting, incredible cinematography, historic!
512;This film has it all.
513;If film can ever be art, this one is likely a prototype.
514;he also manages a quick and hot affair with a French Nobleman's lonely wife.
515;Perfect levels of suspense at every moment.
516;So it is a throwback to my youth to see the atmosphere created.
517;They are unknown to me, but very good.
518;Director Fred Zimmerman achieves almost the same effect with this movie which seems very much like a suspenseful documentary.
519;Fred Zinnemann's adaptation of the Frederick Forsythe thriller is compulsive viewing for fans of political thrillers, espionage and deadly assassins.
520;and attracted the movie makers with it's dynamic plot and complex characters.
521;edward Fox created one the best killers EVER bought to the screen.
522;fox's character is dashing, debonair, charming and a ruthless assassin who is innovative, driven and exceptionally cold blooded.
523;Michel Lonsdale (in probably his best role) is the intrepid and wily French police inspector who is given the invidious task of finding a faceless man who is on a single minded mission to kill President Charles DeGaulle.
524;His excellent direction of this deadly game of cat and mouse is inventive, taut and brillianty staged.
525;A first rate support cast of predominantly lesser known actors lend a superb authenticity to the feel of the story (Loved Cyril Cusack as the Jackal's expert gunsmith).
526;Never to mind, The Day of the Jackal is A. class entertainment from beginning to end and belongs on the shelf of any devotee of stimulating and riveting thrillers.
527;We are amazed at his precision planning and deft skill.
528;The tension and excitement is kept at fever pitch throughout this political thriller.
529;Most entertaining in every aspect.
530;in the second meeting between the jackal and the gunsmith (Cusack), the jackal is reviewing Cusack's handiwork and admiring the gun.
531;this makes perfect sense in light of what we know of the jackal (that he would off any possible witnesses).
532;As with any film, the story is the basis of appeal.
533;this film delivers with a fascinating story, believable characters and suspense throughout.
534;This film version of Fredrick Forsyth's best seller Day of the Jackal is incredible.
535;the storyline and the subtle ways the director shows the passage of time are marvelous.
536;the modern version of this film (the Jackal starring Richard Gere) doesn't even come close to the cinnematic masterpiece that Director Fred Zinnemann presents in Day of the Jackal.
537;This is one film that one can watch over and over, it is a true classic.
538;The Day of the Jackal is a classic film that continues to amaze this reviewer.
539;Filmed in France, the Jackal leads the French authorities on a wild goose chase for a hired killer aiming for Pres. De Gaulle, the French leader who ended the Algerian occupation.
540;the lead star, Edward Fox shows you the pathology of a cold blooded killer whose skill set is inventive, ( a 1950's film, so no magic Double 007 tricks) and whose character is understated but brilliantly acted.
541;This is a classic film fort those who love to sit on the edge of their chairs for great suspense drama.
542;"I mention this because ""The Day of the Jackal"" does a masterful job of show how a criminal with evil intent is able to integrate himself into a country without being detected."
543;blooded professional who knows his trade.
544;paced yet thorough suspense movie.
545;the acting is good but the movie's title character and most of the people involved intentionally down play their roles to bring out the sterile nature of a professional assasin and his accomplices and pursuers.
546;This leaves one focussed more on the movie than the preformances and that is the way a good suspense movie should be remembered.
547;This movie is timeless in that and many other perspectives.
548;keeps you at the edge of your seat,wondering if the Jackal will forfill his contract or take the money and run!Outstanding!
549;Truly an on the edge of you seat classic.
550;I was amazed at how well made and compelling it was.
551;Great actors and storyline and it doesn't seem to deviate much from the book though I think the movie was tighter and more of a thriller than the book.
552;An extremely intelligent thriller that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats all throughout, this classic from Hollywood veteran Fred Zinnemann works wonderfully well despite the fact that its outcome is known from the very beginning.
553;The trick, then, is the careful manner in which Zinnemann unfolds the tale of an attempt to assassinate the legendary politician, taking his audience on a breathless ride across scenic locales in Europe, including Genoa, Vienna and the etherally beautiful city of Paris.
554;i am writing this review after viewing the movie for the umpteenth time, and I just realised that it grows better with each viewing.
555;forsaking explosive action for an intelligent pacing and clever script that sticks closely to Frederick Forsyth's bestselling novel (in my humble opinion, one of the strongest points about this movie), Zinnemann uses a cast of solid British and French actors as he brings to the screen, almost in a documentary fashion, the race by police across Europe to nab the canny and suave hitman Jackal (Edward Fox).
556;juxtaposed with this is the Jackal's devious and meticulous preparations for the hit.
557;Zinnemann's ability to get under the skin of his characters is one of the film's many strengths, and the film's documentary style has often been emulated, but never as successfully.
558;the gorgeous cinematography and sound design are two of the other strengths of this film, but they aren't very well served by the non.
559;There is, however, an excellent text supplement documenting the making of the film.
560;"It presents many worthy tidbits, such as the surprising fact that ""The Day Of The Jackal"" marked Zinnemann's return to the screen after a rather long hiatus."
561;This one is definitely a keeper.
562;I have seen this movie many time and enjoyed it each time, a truly great movie.
563;This is a suspenseful classic that I enjoy watching several times/year.
564;The movie begins with a real.
565;the Frederick Forsyth novel is depicted well, and makes for very enjoyable, thrilling entertainment.
566;This is an action film based on exceptional character actors.
567;"Then there is the cop, Alan Badel, a wonderful French actor whom many might recognize in the states
I:24918;568;They play a cat and mouse game, where some luck is involved but mostly technique and inspired intuition.
I:24918;569;Throughout, the tension is maintained at a consistent clip, and every single detail is quirky, believable, and realistic .
I:24918;570;that is storytelling as its best.
I:24918;571;it adds up to a great film, with plenty of humor, often dark, thrown in.
I:24918;572;Many of its senior officers felt betrayed by their government.
I:24918;573;There are two separate but related plots: one focuses on the assassin's meticulous preparations"
574;Each fully understands what he must do and how to do it.
575;He is a public official doing his job, no matter who is in danger.
576;For some, I guess, this film is a thriller.
577;It certainly has a number of exciting moments but I, for one, never had any doubt that Lebel would eventually prevail.
578;My interest is explained almost entirely by the seamless development of the two plots, each of which includes several especially well.
579;"Riveting rather than ""thrilling"" summarizes my response to events throughout this crisp and cohesive film."
580;This is an outstanding movie in every way.
581;Both parts played by top line actors and thier performance proves it.
582;so sit back and enjoy a old fashion detective at work before all the forensic sciences got into the picture like we see on TV almost every night.
583;This superlative movie has all the classic ingredients of a real thriller, without all the non.
584;The Jackal provides a classy alternative.
585;Algeria was considered a part of metropolitan France, and held a status much higher than any other French colony.
586;the OAS conducted many assassinations both inside Algeria and France itself.
587;The book, upon which the movie is based takes the plot a step further and portrays a British assassin who is probably a lot more determined and competent than his historical counterpart was.
588;So in the end what we have with The Jackal is some classic suspence, good acting by all the players, and a story that does not dumb itself down like so many action thrillers today do.
589;Jackal can be enjoyed without having to wince from excessive gore or violence.
590;It slowly picked up speed and became an intellectual masterpiece.
591;We get to see a very smart crook from step one set up his plan to asasinate the president.
592;The director very nicely leaves murders a lot to our imagination and doesn't show every detail of deaths or assaults.
593;"Truely an ""A"" rate film."
594;A first class story and very well acted.
595;reproduction was also very good.
596;this movie is worth seeing over and over again
597;This movie is true to the original #1 NYT bestselling novel by the same title,The Day of the Jackalstill one of the best I've ever read.
598;"Fox is outstanding as ""The Jackal"" and Forsyth's plot so compelling you are captured by The Jackal's relentless yet easily believable ability to overcome everything thrown at him by the French intelligence service and national police."
599;"Synopsis: Assassin for hire code name ""Jackal"" takes a high paying, high risk job (the one that retires you) the target: French President Charles De Gaulle
I:24918;600;The movie is pretty faithful to book.
I:24918;601;also the ending scene is 1000 times more suspenseful in the text.
I:24918;602;A great story of plotting an assassination of the French leader.
I:24918;603;It is fast paced and it reads well.
I:24918;604;This is probably superfluous, but thanks to all of the commentators above.
I:24918;605;Fred Zinneman excels all others attempts at a documentary style.
I:24918;606;This is one of my favorite 25 films of all time.
I:24918;607;Director Fred Zinnemann's excellent adaptation of Frederick Forsyth's novel has grown in stature during the past 30 years and has been recognized as the masterpiece it always was.
I:24918;608;The Day of the Jackal (1973) is cinematic suspense at its finest, with a brilliant performance by Edward Fox as the master assassin who aims his sights on French President Charles de Gaulle.
I:24918;609;Superb filmmaking in the classic tradition of Zinnemann's """"High Noon."""""""
610;famous british and french actors, The Day Of The Jackal depicts the cat.
611;actors are good, the story is entertaining, sex and corpses are very much there but non.
612;if you are nostalgic, or simply interested in what Britain and especially France looked like 40 years ago, this movie will provide you with a fairly good idea.
613;"The true success of this film rests in the realistic and unassuming characters of the ""Jackal"" and the French police commissioner, Lebel, who is charged with catching him."
614;edward Fox plays the Jackal, and he is a perfect choice.
615;and that is why he fits the bill so well.
616;And yet, he is also as formidable in deductive reasoning and intelligence as his adversary.
617;"Rather, it allows the viewer to appreciate and even admire the simple game of cat and mouse
I:24918;618;It also allows us to appreciate the intelligence of the characters.
I:24918;619;More and more storywriters are understanding that the intrigue is in the journey and not the climax.
I:24918;620;This line is aimed not only toward his assistant in the story, but to the audience as well.
I:24918;621;this is, quite simply, one of the best films ever made about the """"cat and mouse chase"
622;Some works of art are so grand, and yet, usually so simple, that they can't be duplicated.
623;The Day of the Jackal is one of those films.
624;This is an absolutely superior work of cinema that was foolishly judged to be eligible for a remake, horribly done, with Bruce Willis (no joke).
625;style, director Fred Zinnemann takes the viewer through a believable plot to assassinate French President de Gaulle by French ex.
626;There is probably no cooler killer in the movies than the Jackal but even more than that, this movie works because it slowly builds to a neat climax with a surprising twist.
627;but for intelligent and exciting entertainment this one is a real winner.
628;perhaps the best of the genre.
629;the opening sequence through the (true to life) assassination attempt on degaulle and the jackal's interview with the OAS leadership for the assignment to try again (fiction) is one of the most perfectly compelling sequences for me ever in this type of movie.
630;This excellent film from 1973 features Edward Fox as The Jackal.
631;this is very well directed by Zimmerman, who shot the film on location in Paris and London.
632;This is shot in an almost documentary style, which should not put you off because like a number of other films from the early 70's (The French Connection/Godfather films spring to mind), this is a really entertaining film that you will want to see again and again.
633;It's worth watching Michael Caton.
634;It's a beautifully understated film, a quiet and deceptively slow.
635;moving cat and mouse game in which Fox's mysterious super.
636;Meanwhile Fox is superb as the Jackal .
637;but is in fact one of the most brilliantly tense climaxes of any thriller I know.
638;Completely riveting from start to finish.
639;"ending hit
I:24918;640;Fox studied hard for this role, and it pays off for the viewer: he perfectly portrays the Jackal as an utterly uncaring, egocentric, extremely elusive and clever individual, as a person with this occupation would probably be.
I:24918;641;Lonsdale is just as fantastic"
642;I give this film 5 stars because it's not only flawless, but still rewards attentiveness after all these years.
643;The First, Original, and Only telling of this story, in my opinion.
644;Based on Frederic Forsyth's bestselling novel, this is one of those rare films that does justice to the book.
645;the film is nicely paced and, while it's not laden with special effects, it has no trouble holding your attention.
646;It's a tribute to Forsyth, the screenplay, and the director that, even though you know that DeGaulle was never assasinated, the suspense continues to build throughout the film right up to the end.
647;Just the right combination of suspense and action combined with an intelligent screenplay.
648;I really enjoyed this book since I have never read it or seen the movie.
649;read many of Forsyths book and really enjoy his stuff.
650;The lovely thig about this rendition of the novel is that it holds true to the real deal.
651;That part of the movie is a non.
652;The real thrill is how the government officials assemble the details and how the hit man (Edward Fox's sublimely cool character) himself becomes the target for a hit.
653;A good film never needs music.
654;Instead, Edward Fox was perfect in his role as a calm, ice.
655;"I honestly believe, that because he was so convincing, I would be afraid of this character in real life more than any of the other stars"" mentioned before."
656;The Day of the Jackal is one of the best action.
657;It's nothing short of brilliant and it's something of a hidden treasure.
658;what's fantastic about Jackal is that it works within the realm of possibility.
659;human killers of movies of the last 20 or so years.
660;This is an extraordinary feat considering that the assassin's target is a real historical figure who was never assassinated.
661;This detracted a bit from the realism.
662;this is a must see.
663;"Even if you're not a fan of the so. called ""spy fiction"" genre, you'll enjoy the intrigue, suspense or, in the least, all the wonderful shots of Italy and France."
664;it is rare that a movie doesnt let one down after having read the book.
665;this movie does a great job, it kept me glued although i knew what was gonna happen.
666;The story construction moves along at a logical, rapid pace.
667;ending with a splendid climax where the Hitman meets his demise.
668;One cool way to watch the original back to back with the Richard Gere/Bruce Willis/Sidney Poitier flop.
669;Fredrick Forsythe is one of my favorite authors, and this movie relates his political, suspense drama the best of any of his books I think.
670;it worked perfectly I have nothing more to say about the movie besides it worked very well and nothing else!
671;This movie is a classic!
672;All the way along the suspense is gripping: the race between the would.
673;and there is the final ironic twist!
674;and even thought they get the right man, it turns out that their innitial assumption and premise is totally wrong, and their success has been due to pure luck!
675;When British journalist and foreign correspondent Frederick Forsyth turned to writing fiction, his first novel, The Day of the Jackal became an international best.
676;seller, which was then brilliantly adapted for the big screen.
677;Edward Fox stars as the mysterious and extremely intelligent Jackal, who meticulously plans how he will accomplish the task, and then proceeds to make it a reality.
678;Combined efforts involving the intelligence services of several countries, produces a lead in Britain.
679;most of the key elements from the book are included in the movie, which under the direction of Fred Zinnemann, remains engaging and interesting, throughout out its lengthy 143 minute run.
680;tension builds naturally, with few attempts to overdramatize the situations.
681;Edward Fox is brilliant as the Jackal, a professional who handles any complication, and save for an odd romantic episode, is completely focused on his mission.
682;An original and timely plot.
683;paced, exciting with original devices.
684;Fox was superb as the hero.
685;"Anyways, it's definitely worth the $5 or whatever it cost on Amazon
I:24918;686;This is one of the best suspense movies I've ever seen.
I:24918;687;The whole plot is so unbelievably complicated that you find it fascinating.
I:24918;688;the fact is that its a true story and that makes it even more interesting.
I:24918;689;Edward Fox gives an outstanding performance as 'The Jackal', who's been hired to kill President Charles de Gaulle of France.
I:24918;690;see movie for anybody who's got even the slightest interst in suspense.
I:24918;691;You'll be surprised to find out how well the movie has been directed, and how great all the performances are.
I:24918;692;I was intrigued by the remake """"The Jackal"""" (Bruce Willis/Richard Gere), so I thought it would be wise to check out the original."""
693;As with most things, the original is far better.
694;This film is very well written, acted, and directed.
695;The film is so good that despite the ending, you will be interested throughout.
696;The allure of espionage and the monumental challenge for an assassin are illustrated quite well.
697;great story and suspense without the need for gratuitous violence and body counts.
698;done to be smarter or better acted.
699;drawn and the plot is excellent.
700;In the days of action without a thousand explosions, this one was in the TOP and keeps you involved until the last frame.
701;one of the best suspense thrillers made, Fox is a great actor in this part.
702;I always liked Forsyth novels and the whole film was suspenseful.
703;Iread thebook and the film captured the book beautifully
704;Another Forsyth masterpiece, and a film production that does it justice.
705;Modern movies could take a page or so from this book for riveting narrative.
706;An excellent adaptation of the Frederick Forsythe classic.
707;The movie is well cast, well paced.
708;A perfect thriller or very close to it.
709;If you see the movie without first reading the book, you'll think it was a very good movie.
710;If you've read the book first (and the book is sensational), then you will think the movie is sensational.
711;The casting is superb .
712;movie combination, this duo ranks right up there with James Dickey's Deliverance and Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird.
713;Sophisticated, smart, well done, .
714;a thinking person's unique payoff.
715;A suberb adaptation of the Forsythe novel of the same name.
716;The character played by Fox is both charming and utterly ruthless.
717;His casual way of killing with a completely calm demeanor is chilling while also strangely compelling to watch.
718;The intrigue behind the scenes builds as the security of France is infiltrated.
719;The cat and mouse game is deadly for those that get in the way.
720;The film builds to a climax as the immense man.
721;Truly a great, suspenseful film, that will keep you fascinated until the last scene.
722;Overall, it is not as polished as the newer movies, but it's still nice, Although I felt like the capabilities of the police at the time was exaggerated.
723;but it just catched my attention.
724;I love this film because the detective the method used was so simple but effective.
