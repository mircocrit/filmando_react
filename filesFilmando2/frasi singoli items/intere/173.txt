I:11277;1;This is an excellent, interesting and twist laden film.
I:11277;2;I had never seen any of Almodovar's pictures, but understand now why he is so revered and successful.
I:11277;3;I appreciated how the film required an attention to story, to the editing, and the juxtaposition of characters, some super.
I:11277;4;imposed on top of each other.
I:11277;5;Such is the nature though of the characters, who are as complex as the story, while being fully recognizable to me.
I:11277;6;Later, the boys reunite and begin to discover the truth.
I:11277;7;gael Garcia Bernal continues to expand upon his recurring roles as an object of desire for both sexes and for priests.
I:11277;8;He is fantastic in 'Bad Education' especially since he plays several roles, the main ones being Zahara, the transvestite bar singer, and as Angel, an out.
I:11277;9;work actor with an axe to grind.
I:11277;10;Fele Martinez is incredibly sexy and does a fantastic job as the man caught in the middle of everything.
I:11277;11;It isn't really Almodovar's best work, but it is still really good.
I:11277;12;breathtaking film with a plot so convoluted, I'm going to have to rewatch the movie just to see where all the storylines intersect and converge.
I:11277;13;Gael Garc a Bernal is sexy, charming, and lethal in his layered performance of ngel, Juan, and Zahara.
I:11277;14;This is my introduction to Pedro Almodovar and I am pleased to report that I'm intrigued enough to watch the rest of his filmography.
I:11277;15;This film went slightly out of my comfort zone, but did explore interesting ideas best befitting to big (complicated) gay city life.
I:11277;16;Like all of Almodovar's films, this one is filled with bright colors, deep emotions and complex characters.
I:11277;17;I saw this movie when I was in Seville in it's original Spanish version, and thoroughly enjoyed it.
I:11277;18;It is interesting in that it approaches the issue of homosexuality in the era of the Franco dictatorship without actually politicizing the issue.
I:11277;19;this movie, as well as other Almodovar movies, has the characteristic of humor mixed with serious tension.
I:11277;20;This is a terrific gay film noir, with wonderful performances by the entire cast, particularly Bernal .
I:11277;21;I will be vvery surprised if these two don't work together again.
I:11277;22;"Once again Almodovar breathtakingly blends art and controversy
I:11277;23;viewing discussion, any Almodovar film will do, and this is no exception.
I:11277;24;Spoken dialogue is in English and subtitles are in English.
I:11277;25;That was perhaps one of the most well written, well directed foreign films I've seen in the past few years!
I:11277;26;The writing and the plot were original and intriguing.
I:11277;27;Gael Garcia does an awesome portrayal in this movie.
I:11277;28;Am such a fan of him, also a fan of Almodovars work and movies, but this one was a bit strange for me.
I:11277;29;one of the ones that I like least, but that is just my opinion, but definitely worth seeing.
I:11277;30;Now I'm pretty comfortable in my heterosexuality, but this film really gets you into the physical and psychological aspects of being gay.
I:11277;31;But what it also does is do this in an amazing way: the filming.
I:11277;32;"each shot, each frame, each image of this film is so carefully constructed and manipulated that I could hardly pull my eyes away
I:11277;33;If you're a homophobe, you should definitely NOT see this film.
I:11277;34;But if you're a film enthusiast, and enjoy excellent acting, perfect sets, and a gripping storyline, you MUST SEE this.
I:11277;35;I was shocked to see digital censoring of a scene in this movie.
I:11277;36;At the core of this film is a gay love story between two schoolmates, Enrique and Ignacio that is thwarted by jealous pedophile priest, Father Manolo but there are so many layers to Bad Education, stories within stories, that at times it's a swirling eddy of suspenseful tension that unfolds like a piece of origami.
I:11277;37;There is so much going on in Bad Education that I highly recommend a second viewing to absorb all of the nuances of yet another brilliant Almodovar film.
I:11277;38;Highly recommended but not for the homophobic.
I:11277;39;I so much loved this latest film of almodovar: sensuous and intelligent, thought provoking and deeply felt, ti manages to not go over the top at the same time it overwhelms.
I:11277;40;star Gael Garcia Bernal shines in the multiple roles of drag queen, Zahara, bad boy Juan, and the ambitious actor, Angel.
I:11277;41;"lipped, sensuous film actor, Bernal provides ""Bad Education"" with a throbbing energy that sets the complicated plot(s) in motion."
I:11277;42;In 1980's Spain, the boyishly seductive Ignacio arrives at the office of his old, childhood friend, a film director named Enrique.
I:11277;43;In the script, Ignacio grows up to become exotic performer, Zahara, who finally returns to the church to confront Manolo, and the demons of the past.
I:11277;44;the cinematography is up to Almodovar's usual luxe standards, the writing clever and intense, the plot as engrossing as it is unbelievable.
I:11277;45;In addition to Bernal's fine acting, Fele Martinez is also excellent in the role of Enrique.
I:11277;46;He gives a genuinely moving performance as a man who believes (wrongly) that his long.
I:11277;47;there's a lot going on here.
I:11277;48;"a. film and the numerous lies that serve as ""backstories"" for the characters."
I:11277;49;Almodovar more often works with a company of women actors, allowing their stories to unfold from a distinctly feminine perspective.
I:11277;50;"And while I love ""All About My Mother"", ""Volver"", and their sister films, it's interesting to see Almodovar's occasional foray into the testosterone."
I:11277;51;Just when you think you know everything that's going on, it takes you in a whole new direction and completely surprises you!
I:11277;52;I loved this movie from start to finish and is very easy to understand why: GAEL GARCIA BERNAL.
I:11277;53;He delivers an amazing, tour.
I:11277;54;the film is very well written and expertly directed by Almodovar.
I:11277;55;The rest of the cast does a fantastic job especially Daniel Gimenez Cacho who plays the priest who sexually molested Ignacio at an all boys Catholic school.
I:11277;56;Fele Martinez who plays Enrique Goded an up and coming filmmaker who was Ignacio's best friend at the school also does an incredible job.
I:11277;57;This movie is not for everyone but you should check it out and see it because it is truly a master achievement in Spanish filmmaking.
I:11277;58;Yet I feel it was important to demonstrate the sexual attraction that the characters had for each other especially Martinez for Bernal.
I:11277;59;try and see this film with an open mind and leave your inhibitions behind and you will enjoy this landmark film to its fullest.
I:11277;60;The acting is excellent and the story is very well thought out.
I:11277;61;Gael Garcia Bernal fans this one is a MUST SEE and even if you haven't yet discover the amazing talent that this young actor brings to every role that he plays this is a great movie to find out why everyone can't get enough of this young man.
I:11277;62;One of the finest actors of his generation.
I:11277;63;What a really great film!
I:11277;64;Almodovar treats us to layers upon layers of stories and twists of plot.
I:11277;65;Everytime a new character enters the story, we see a whole new side of the story.
I:11277;66;The film also has wonderful twists of direction, for example when you realize the scenes of the drag queen robbing the church are part of a movie, starring one of the characters acting as himself, but who actually is his brother.
I:11277;67;It certainly is and you will enjoy trying to figure out this dark film.
I:11277;68;Now why would a beautiful young man film his older middle.
I:11277;69;Pretty people create dangerous territory.
I:11277;70;This movie is one of the most erotic things I have ever seen.
I:11277;71;It is beautifully filmed, memories within movies within memories.
I:11277;72;I believe it truly is something to see.
I:11277;73;Gael Garcia Bernal is very good in his part, but it's a young man who has been abused and thrown away by an institution he trusted.
I:11277;74;The movie is still worth seeing, and it has some really great singing in it too.
I:11277;75;coms they now have a very artistic approach and feel to them.
I:11277;76;For example, I totally agree with the assessment that the Catholic Church is a source of great evil and hypocrisy, especially when it comes to homosexuals.
I:11277;77;Bernal turns in another great performance, and the scope of this film is nothing if not ambitious.
I:11277;78;Jimenez Cacho delivers one of the strongest and most haunting performances in cinema history representing a very rigid priest who gives in to his most obscure desires.
I:11277;79;This is a wonderfully crafted movie worth watching multiple times to truly appreciate the numerous layers embedded by director/writer Pedro Almodvar into his masterpiece.
I:11277;80;Some of the most dangerous and deadly parasites are more beautiful than the hosts they are feeding on.
I:11277;81;The innocent relationship between Ignacio and Enrique is quashed by the jealous Father Manolo, their literature teacher, played by Daniel Gimenez Cacho.
I:11277;82;The surprising fate of Ignacio is revealed.
I:11277;83;the accomplished Almodovar as is his ilk, weaves a complex tale of relationships that result in a plot that is a mix of drama, intrigue and psychological turmoil.
I:11277;84;i really enjoyed this movie, but i do have to point out that i do not think that this is almodovar's strongest showing when compared to all about my mother or talk to her.
I:11277;85;this movie has so many twists to it that a viewer really has to pay attention to what is going to gain the full effect by movies end.
I:11277;86;but the effort is well worth it.
I:11277;87;bernal does give a knock out performance in multiple roles and does anchor the movie quite well.
I:11277;88;in all honesty i dont see many underage people watching this type of movie to begin with, so what is the harm in showing a movie that is adult dealing with adult themes and showing everything the artist wants to put on screen.
I:11277;89;oh well watch the movie it is very twisted but in a good way.
I:11277;90;the focal character is Enrique, a young and successful director who is searching for inspiration for his next production.
I:11277;91;ultimately, the movie is about his love of depicting erotic role.
I:11277;92;Granted it has all of the director's omnipresent visual flair, including the striking opening titles and the Bernard Herrmann.
I:11277;93;scenes montage and footage from the red carpet at the AFI Film Festival.
I:11277;94;There is also an extensive photo gallery and several trailers for the film.
I:11277;95;Bad Education is a remarkable film .
I:11277;96;noir with many surprises, with an interesting structure: it takes place in the present and tells the story about the past, presents the story as a film within the film, then mixes past and present together in a twisted turn.
I:11277;97;he is a triple star of the film, and he looks great as a woman (transsexual/drag queen) and a man.
I:11277;98;He is a talented actor, too.
I:11277;99;"The boy Ignacio whispered in awe, ""Sara is beautiful."""
I:11277;100;"pedro Almodovar has always set out to provoke audiences with confronting images and themes that are often described as perverted by his detractors, and nothing has changed with ""Bad Education""."
I:11277;101;This is particularly the case with Gael Garcia Bernal's character, which is the reason why I love this film so much.
I:11277;102;The audience's perception of Bernal's character constantly changes throughout the film and I found myself thinking about just who this person really was for days after finishing this film.
I:11277;103;My fascination with this character is assisted by the fact that he is played by Bernal, who is not just a pretty face, but also an incredibly talented actor.
I:11277;104;"I have enjoyed seeing Bernal in other films (in particular ""Don't Tempt Me""), but to see him working with Almodovar, who has a talent for bringing out the best in his actors, is a real joy."
I:11277;105;It is rare in this day and age to see a film that really brings something fresh and intriguing to play .
I:11277;106;Definitely Hitchcockian in its presentation and delivery, Bad Education is more than something that such a complement provides.
I:11277;107;Almodovar has created something that is more than any simple homage.
I:11277;108;He has created something fresh and exciting!
I:11277;109;"gael Garcia Bernal miraculously creates the multiple roles he plays in the ""real"" and ""scripted"" stories in this film."
I:11277;110;He is a force to be reconed with and I suspect we will be seeing his name on an Academy award before it's over with.
I:11277;111;Both handsome and erotic all at once, he is a sensual pleasure as both male and female.
I:11277;112;the sets and locations are exotic and believable.
I:11277;113;The script is tight and engaging.
I:11277;114;Bad Education is a movie with an important mission, a little provocative, but really worth seeing.
I:11277;115;One after another the viewer will discover something new in the lifes of the main characters, and it's difficult to guess how it will end.
I:11277;116;"Beautiful and without doubt ""Almodvar's"" best since ""All about my mother""."
I:11277;117;It's important that movies like these are made.
I:11277;118;LA MALA EDUCACION is a splendid work of art.
I:11277;119;not only is this film a visual delight .
I:11277;120;scenic compositions with colors and light vs shadow effects and perceptual vantages .
I:11277;121;it is also told with a script so finely written that it simultaneously becomes poetry, acerbic social comment, storytelling that is languidly beautiful at one moment and intellectually challenging at another.
I:11277;122;Enrique is suspicious of Angel's true identity, accepts his script to read, then investigates the truth about his former lover Ignacio based on the information in the vivid script.
I:11277;123;but enough of the intrigue: how this bizarre set of characters intertwine and the real story of the past and the present unravel is the glory of this immensely complex, challenging and vividly entertaining script.
I:11277;124;One is never sure whether the tale before our eyes is life as it is happening, memory, or an on going filming of a movie!As always, Almodovar has gathered a cadre of actors from earlier films and adds new flesh to expand his 'company' of committed collaborators.
I:11277;125;But it is the absolutely bravura performances of Gael Garcia Bernal that will astound you.
I:11277;126;Almodovar's camera loves Garcia and here celebrates an actor of such importance at such a young age that the future of Bernal is more than secure.
I:11277;127;This young actor is simply magnificent.
I:11277;128;and the cinematography is first rate as is the musical score by Alberto Iglesias.
I:11277;129;Every aspect of this film, beginning with the clever, colorful and story.
I:11277;130;"Still transfixed by Writer/Director Almodovar's haunting and powerful ""Talk To Her"", I was swept into the theatre by advanced word of mouth and glowing reviews heralding his new film, a film noir to end all film noir."
I:11277;131;I can take or leave most early Almodvar films, Atame, Qu he hecho yo., Mujeres al borde., etc. but since Carne Tr mula (Live Flesh, 1997), I've enjoyed every one.
I:11277;132;And sometimes this subtlety can be even more powerful.
I:11277;133;Half the fun of the film is piecing the parts together.
I:11277;134;But it's gratifying to know that by the final scene it all gels together perfectly.
I:11277;135;He's involved in pretty much every homoerotic scene in the film, which may or may not be a selling point.
I:11277;136;making performances from his cast lifts this high above the norm.
I:11277;137;homophobic lovers of dark tales of obsession, revenge and mystery will enjoy this film.
I:11277;138;Pedro Almodovar has to be one of the most original and best film directors working today.
I:11277;139;His latest movie, BAD EDUCATION, is a joy to behold.
I:11277;140;The photography is stunning from the opening credits to the end of the movie.
I:11277;141;Shot in beautiful color, many of the frames literally are worthy of framing.
I:11277;142;gael Garcia Bernal (Angel/Juan/Zahara) of THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES and THE CRIME OF FATHER AMARO also is a living, moving work of art reminding us that a thing of beauty truly is a joy forever.
I:11277;143;As he does so often, Almodovar teases the viewer with female impersonators so real that we aren't always certain as to which sex we are seeing.
I:11277;144;It is always exciting and so visually invigorating to see an Almodovar film.
I:11277;145;but the film is besides a real master class about edition process.
I:11277;146;A magnificent script solidly with three levels of narration.
I:11277;147;The plot demands from you an absolute attention.
I:11277;148;The light effects are by themselves another tour de force component.
I:11277;149;The overlapping and intersected dramatic lines amazes us due their astonishing fluidity and natural cohesion.
I:11277;150;This surprising and tragic puzzle breathes as real tide: a synchronized concatenation of sequences will lead us from the facts to the feelings and never vice versa.
I:11277;151;one of the best films ever made in any age and consider it from its initial release an instantaneous classic.
I:11277;152;I remember seeing this movie when it came out and almost forgot how good of a storyline this film had.
I:11277;153;Gael Garcia Bernal is amazing as the conniving transvestite and you almost start to root for him.
I:11277;154;Those are touchy subjects, but Almodovar makes us watch by using a well played game of role reversals and twists.
I:11277;155;It's and enjoyable film, I recommend it.
I:11277;156;I personally love Almodovar movies,and when this movie came available for instant watch I was so happy.
I:11277;157;, and funny with an array of complex characters with enough tragedy for the entire population of any Red State of your choosing!
I:11277;158;One of the characters is Zahara.
I:11277;159;Bad Education is a mesmerizing thriller about identity, revenge and blackmail.
I:11277;160;Almodovar gives us a deep, many.
I:11277;161;layered story with facts that turn in on themselves and then turn out again.
I:11277;162;See it anyway, the performances are quite passionate.
I:11277;163;All in all, a voracious screen triumph for both cast and director alike.
I:11277;164;"For one thing, to describe the plot would be to give away the twists and thus spoil its surprises
I:11277;165;"The other Almodovar movie I'd seen before this was ""Live Flesh"" and ""Talk to Her,"" which I love."
I:11277;166;"Interestingly, ""Bad Education"" has given me a new appreciation of ""Talk to Her."""
I:11277;167;The two films share a lot of themes .
I:11277;168;deception and fantasy of falling in love, the spiritualization of aesthetic beauty .
I:11277;169;"almodovar's genius in both ""Bad Education"" and ""Talk to Her"" is his ability to set the scene, stringing the audience along, lulling it into a sense of comprehension and security, and then suddenly turning the tables with a twist of such dizzying magnitude that the mind, reeling, forced to give up on trying to understand, must just relax and allow the movie to take over ."
I:11277;170;atmospherical levels, for with each twist, the film takes on a new genre.
I:11277;171;Further twists are introduced, and the movie metamorphoses into a mystery, a thriller, a dark rain.
I:11277;172;He is a true movie star .
I:11277;173;divinely beautiful, dazzlingly charismatic, with that all.
I:11277;174;important aura of mystery .
I:11277;175;and though he virtually plays five characters as his character transforms along with the film, his strikingly calm blue.
I:11277;176;green eyes and sensual mouth provide a steady center for the madness around him.
I:11277;177;All of the sex scenes are artfully filmed (there is no frontal nudity) and even the subplot concerning a pedophile priest is handled with care.
I:11277;178;But despite this the film is really well delivered.
I:11277;179;The characters are mostly well written and the story is engaging.
I:11277;180;beautiful characters, victims making bad choices.
I:11277;181;Potent, complex film from master Almodovar features a stunning, gender.
I:11277;182;bernal, and an ingenious plot that has us shifting between Ignacio's story as written and real.
I:11277;183;Another memorable and distinctive entry from director Almodovar.
I:11277;184;spains great pedro almodovar has another triumph in this meditation upon identity and betrayal, as one brother assumes the persona of his dead sibling in order to deceive the now successful childhood friend and lover of his now.
I:11277;185;The performances are absolutely faultless and the script magnificently well adapted from the original book,the director, one of the best.
I:11277;186;but please have an open mind when you see it, and don't try to imitate what you are about to see.
I:11277;187;This exceptional film is entirely unique in its intensity and depth, but not how I expected.
I:11277;188;The sex and nudity is very carefully placed, not at all gratuitous (unfortunately.
I:11277;189;I won't spoil any secrets here, but suffice it to say that it isn't even the secrets that are so intense, it is the masterful way in which things are revealed.
I:11277;190;This is really a film about sex as power, and all of the power plays which don't make anyone happy.
I:11277;191;almodovar's direction and cinematography are stunning, erotic, and intensley emotional.
I:11277;192;He tells so much of the story visually without dialogue.
I:11277;193;the film ends on a realistic note.
I:11277;194;Not considering love among family and love between friends, the ONLY instance of love you will see here is that which shines in the eyes of two young, grade school boys as they look at each other while being torn apart for what appears to be forever.
I:11277;195;"Just one other possibility is a ""memory of love,"" which you see once or twice in the eyes of film maker, Enrique, as he is reminded of earlier, cherished times with his school companion."
I:11277;196;Gael Garcia Bernal is terrific in a complicated, multi faceted role, and all the acting is very good.
I:11277;197;Gorgeously shot, with a great score.
I:11277;198;Many critics consider this Almodovar's masterpiece .
I:11277;199;Pedro Almodvar creates a refreshing cinematic experience that takes sudden turns when least expected while traveling into a dubious world.
I:11277;200;Many of Almodvar's previous films offer laughter and contemplation, yet most of them deal with a dubious theme, as does Bad Education.
I:11277;201;His personal insignia with colorful photography still leaves traces throughout the film, even though it is slightly subdued.
I:11277;202;They were close friends, but they also discovered their first love in one another in the unforgiving school run by Catholic priests.
I:11277;203;This is a clever curveball that Almodvar throws at the audience, but it is necessary to understand what happens as the development of the story rests in the past of Ignacio and Enrique.
I:11277;204;This displays Almodvar's ingenious way of telling a captivating story, as it does not follow the conventional rules that often make films one of dozens.
I:11277;205;the effect is a bit like puppet theatre but without the charm.
I:11277;206;In this film, he's attempting to work with action and a multi.
I:11277;207;leveled plot and the style he uses works against him.
I:11277;208;This is an extremely talented writer/director sorely in need of a good screenwriter.
I:11277;209;The first half of this film is engrossing, but then it goes to pieces.
I:11277;210;Film noir is a genre that, ultimately, is meant to be fun.
I:11277;211;"Director Pedro Almodovar has surpassed his genius of ""All About My Mother"" with this new film."
I:11277;212;The sets and actors intertwine with some of the actors for the real movie story acting in the on.
I:11277;213;Instead of confusion, Almodovar creates excitement and curiosity as he brings the viewer deeper into the story.
I:11277;214;"almodovar has a very keen eye for the American movies of the 1950's and ""Bad Education"" is drenched with the dark, foreboding, and passionate colors of a Douglas Sirk film."
I:11277;215;But this is a film which acknowledges the past but whose mindset is of the Now.
I:11277;216;almodovar has made a thriller, a detective story but has done so with the heart of a romantic and he has used Enrique as his detective to try to solve the mystery that is Juan/Angel/Zahara.
I:11277;217;Enrique is now a famous film director in the midst of a minor creative crisis.
I:11277;218;Ignacio is an ambitious actor looking for a job, and he has brought a short story he wrote based on their childhood experiences for Enrique's consideration.
I:11277;219;All of these twists and ironies are orchestrated to create structural and thematic symmetry, but they are interesting and convincing.
I:11277;220;The film's vibrant purples, oranges, reds, and teals look fantastic.
I:11277;221;Almodovar has a rare ability to make bright colors leap off the screen without being at all overbearing.
I:11277;222;I don't know how that was intended, but it's probably a good thing that the reference comes across as funny rather than self.
I:11277;223;It's a pleasure to watch this twisted tale unfold.
I:11277;224;The audio commentary by Pedro Almodovar is quite detailed and interesting.
I:11277;225;shot analysis of characters, story, structure, themes, and many other details.
I:11277;226;winded reviews in the case of films that really just need to be seen, so I'll suffice to say that it had incredible twists and turns, stunning acting, gorgeous Jean.
I:11277;227;paul Gaultier wardrobe and is definitely worth owning.
I:11277;228;bernal is absolutely amazing and is an actor to be reckoned with.
I:11277;229;"Good script with a few ""suprises"", good acting, beautiful film."
I:11277;230;I love watching foreign films because they tend to be more graphic and straightforward about many issues but that's beside the point.
I:11277;231;The revelations that are constantly revealed in this movie can be shocking for some and a full out party for others.
I:11277;232;They both make a great pair in this film and the passion that is expressed in this movie is amazing!The basic premise of the story is about a long lost love, Angel from Enrique's boyhood showing up with a dynamic script hoping to play one of the main characters Zahara.
I:11277;233;i recommend this movie to people who would like to see something outside of the box.
I:11277;234;People who love a good story and like to be intrigued or possibly shocked!
I:11277;235;Check this movie out, it's worth a look and take note of the main actors Gael and Fele because they are wonderful.
I:11277;236;I have seen Gael in Y Tu Mama Tambien (And Your Mother Too), Amores perros (Love's a female dog (curse word really goes there), El Crimen del padre Amaro (The Crime of Father Amaro), and Diarios de Motocicleta (The Motorcycle Diaries) and he's managed to evoke some strong emotions from me.
I:11277;237;He adds a unique performance to the movies I've seen so far.
I:11277;238;I hope to see both of these actors more often.
I:11277;239;This movie was a real find!
I:11277;240;It does contain some graphic sexual scenes but that's pretty much it.
I:11277;241;the film itself I could enjoy,but I prefer The Crime of Father Amaro.
I:11277;242;Like Hitchcock, whose influence can be felt in this film, you become so absorbed in the story that don't realise how confusing it is until after you've seen it and then try to explain it to someone!
I:11277;243;Hypnotic and mesmerizing, the film draws you in from the first scene and doesn't let you go.
I:11277;244;analzye it, just sit back and enjoy.
I:11277;245;This is a stunning film, powerful and evocative, beautifully shot with excellent performances .
I:11277;246;His films can be called daring while still engaging in topics of particular focus and interest in society today.
I:11277;247;And he uses a somewhat Hitchcockian style to his movies, which is always a good way to boost favor amongst the critics and film snobs.
I:11277;248;language films and one of the strongest actors around today.
I:11277;249;i like it because it's several layers of narrative and narrative.
I:11277;250;"a. narrative force me to question how much of it is actually ""true"" in that some of it may be based on real life experiences of Almodovar."
I:11277;251;But the point is that the film's narrative style forces us to question it's biographical sources, kind of like a movie like The Matrix or eXistenZ forces us to question our own reality by presenting multiple levels of virtual realms.
I:11277;252;He's on the look out for a good story and one comes walking right through his door.
I:11277;253;Turns out his old school friend, Ignacio, who now wants to be known adamantly as Angel, has the perfect solution.
I:11277;254;One poignant scene is during a field trip.
I:11277;255;We see the school boys frolicking happily in a lake while hearing a beautiful coir boy rendition of `Moon River'.
I:11277;256;"The story, aptly named `La Visita' has its ending rewritten and as the final dramatic shoot comes to an end Enrique is still at a loss, that is, until he receives a visit of his own!I'll leave the rest to you
I:11277;257;The actors are spectacular and Gael Garc a Bernal manages to come off as childish, sensual, innocent, conniving and in the end quite chilling, he also makes a stunning drag queen.
I:11277;258;I recommend this move to anyone that likes a good mystery.
I:11277;259;Gael Garcia Bernal is outstanding.
I:11277;260;i love movies, but i don't write great reviews.
I:11277;261;the acting perfect, believable and you can't stop watching.
I:11277;262;"i love the actor he is in my all time favorite movie ""perro amor"" ."
I:11277;263;I can only recommend this great movie .
I:11277;264;The main pleasure in watching this film is Gael Garcia Bernal in a dual role.
I:11277;265;I really loved only 2 Almodovar films.
I:11277;266;Mr. Almodvar fully utilized the all that Gael Garc a Bernal has to offer.
I:11277;267;a story so full of flavors, hard to believe it be true.
I:11277;268;the capacity of this story really shocks you throughout the movie.
I:11277;269;gael really is an amazing actor.
I:11277;270;While not as mainstream as the equally brilliant TALK TO HER, Almodovar manages to keep the audiance on the edge of its seat with this film noir/mystery drama.
I:11277;271;The rest of the film is Bernal, who has gone from a mere pretty boy to a pretty boy who can act.
I:11277;272;I'm sure that this maturation has to do with working with Almodovar.
I:11277;273;What this means is that the film is slightly more honest in it's depictions of sex and violence than an R rated film.
I:11277;274;"Over the years, a stigma has developed around the this particular rating, and is often considered the ""kiss of death"" to the films with which it is awarded."
I:11277;275;this is one of Pedro Almodovar's best films.
I:11277;276;It is also one of his most personal films, because elements within the film are autobiographical in nature.
I:11277;277;This film is told in a complicated narrative structure, which holds the audiences attention.
I:11277;278;The story is about Enrique and Ignacio, two childhood friends at a Catholic school who fall in love with one another.
I:11277;279;the acting and direction are amazing here.
I:11277;280;Gael Garcia Bernal delivers an Oscar worthy performance as Ignacio/Angel/Juan.
I:11277;281;Fele Martinez is equally impressive as Enrique, and effectively conveys the emotions that his character experiences.
I:11277;282;Almodovar proves once again that he is a master of the medium, and the music is amazing.
I:11277;283;It was an interesting film worth watching.
I:11277;284;Great performances, gritty, keeps you on your toes.
I:11277;285;rated film is its rating.
I:11277;286;At any rate, catch this for a compelling script, beautiful direction and some fine acting, especially from M. Bernal.
I:11277;287;see the original that caused an uproar in the Berlin Film Festival 20 years ago.
I:11277;288;He is right now my most favorite man: talented, intelligent, versatile, and any of another 12 to 20 positive characteristics that I will keep to myself for now.
I:11277;289;The latter two films have profound ability to be emotionally empacting and visually beautiful, packed with great performances.
I:11277;290;erotica, sexual trauma, revenge, and redemption.
I:11277;291;It's certainly more provocative and challenging for any viewers who don't watch this kind of themes and are not die.
I:11277;292;From there onward, the mystery of The Visit unfolds as it was based on real life experiences that was rather traumatic and compelling.
I:11277;293;"javiar Camara, who was the lead in Talk To Her, has merely a camero in this film, and he play Paca/Paquito, a flamboyant ""girl"" friend of Zahara."
I:11277;294;fele Martinez is a total Sam Rockwell look.
I:11277;295;His performance is quite captivating.
I:11277;296;daniel Gimenez Cacho, the sinner does intense deeds and his performance is mesmerizing when he's torn between lust and guilt.
I:11277;297;alike, and he gives a fine performance as a man trying to let go and move beyond his sins.
I:11277;298;He also has a steamy sex scene with Bernal!Gael Garcia Bernal has the juiciest role to play.
I:11277;299;"He's the focal point in this film, and he's gorgeous wether he was swimming and revealing most of his goods, or all dolled up and looking like the ""Pretty Woman""."
I:11277;300;It's a very complex performance that he delivered.
I:11277;301;overall, this film still features Almodovar's signiture good visuals(vibrant colours and beautiful camera work), and impeccable score and soundtrack!
I:11277;302;"It's a very edgy in a way, because the sex scenes are rather ""soft."
I:11277;303;"His narrative style here is inspired while his trademark visuals remain very much in tact, however, as in the past we were seduced by the bold, fantastic and unapologetic machinations of a gifted upstart, here you feel that you are in the presence of genuine cinematic genius
I:11277;304;The disparate musings of earlier films here are fleshed out and woven expertly.
I:11277;305;Everyone is uniformly excellent and those that, like me, have witnessed his evolution will not be surprised to find that a very gifted filmmaker has emerged.
I:11277;306;"His penchant for the underbelly and/or fringe society is still present (whereas ""Talk to Her"" took on a more conservative cast of characters), ""La Mala Educacion"" is more in keeping with earlier efforts such as ""Law of Desire,"" ""Matador"" and ""High Heels."""
I:11277;307;I loved it and hope you do, too.
I:11277;308;Bad Education is that rare kind of film that matches stunning cinematography with a twisting, multi.
I:11277;309;faceted story, and brilliant acting.
I:11277;310;I guess I'm not supposed to expect anything less from director Pedro Almodovar, but I don't know that much about him or his work (aside from Volver), so I'm still pleasantly surprised.
I:11277;311;"layered story, but the title comes from the childhood romance (and I do mean childhood) of two young boys in a Catholic school, one of whom is in a disturbing ""relationship"" with a priest
I:11277;312;the rest of the film is an intense examination of the effects of such a childhood and the creation of a film based around this childhood.
I:11277;313;Gael Garcia Bernal is captivating in so many ways in this film, but to reveal too much about his character would be a detriment to the viewer's ability to enjoy the film.
I:11277;314;the story plays out in ever more dramatic ways and becomes more and more intense for the viewer and the actors as more information is revealed and more plot twists surface.
I:11277;315;The story within the story continues to unfold as well, and is equally captivating.
