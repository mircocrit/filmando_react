id;spiegazione
1;Loved watching this again.15 years since I watched it last and it was just as good today as it was then.
2;Michael Keaton is incredible as Bruce Wayne, and if not quite as remarkable as Batman himself, he's acceptable.
3;Jack Nicholson stands out as the Joker and does a fine job, although there's a part of me that somehow feels there is someone else who would've been more apppropriate.
4;Yet all in all, Batman somehow retains its status as a fun, classic movie, which I enjoy.
5;children will enjoy this one.
6;this is easily the best of the batman onslaught of the 90s.
7;this is a film most anyone will enjoy except people who criticize everything.
8;there is only one really hot babe in this one.
9;jack nicholson played an awesome joker.
10;I have been a huge Batman fan for over 35 years.
11;I enjoyed the movie so much that I saw it twice in the theater.
12;The costume was incredible and so was the Batmobile.
13;1989 film is easily the best Batman film of all time and one of my favorite movies.
14;Michael Keaton was the best Batman and Jack Nicholson does an excellent role as The Joker.
15;Heath Ledger did just as good of a role, maybe even better but I prefer the direction of Nicholson.
16;He did a good job as being a villain but still being crazy and having a sense of humor.
17;Also Tim Burton did a great job directing and producing it.
18;Later on in the film it shows the origin of The Joker.
19;Napier shoots at Batman, who deflects the bullet with his metal.
20;reinforced gauntlet and sends it back in Napier's face.
21;the picture and sound is very impressive.
22;The packaging was original and the disc was in perfect condition.
23;All in all, a joke of a comic movie.
24;Thanks for the prompt delivery!
25;Batman directed by Tim Burton is a cool and classic action adventure.
26;Jack Nicholson is perfectly cast as the Joker, his laugh is wickedly memorable.
27;Kim Basinger is great as well, too bad she's always being typecast.
28;Nicholson is particularly masterful as the signature caper opposite the immortal caped crusader .
29;Batman is a classic and despite its age, a solid and memorable piece of filmmaking.
30;That in itself is a compliment.
31;There is some real imagination at work here and this is probably the best movie Tim Burton will ever make.
32;The transfer is vibrant and despite the occasional graininess, pretty sharp too.
33;Clean and simple cinematography drag the Dark Knight out of the gutter and into a bright High.
34;Color is vivid without being over.
35;digital optical effects hold up for the most part.
36;This is a great movie for both adults and kids unlike the Christian Bale version of Batman which is mainly for teens and adults.
37;This movie certainly breathed new life in popular love for the Caped Crusader .
38;In 1989, Tim Burton and Warner Bros. brought Batman to the bigscreen, giving both Batman and Bruce Wayne a severe overhaul and finally giving him a movie that truly captures the purity of the character.
39;Here, a new and improved, darker and more complex Batman emerged.
40;Personally, I love this movie.
41;Nicholson delivers pure evil with a grin, and nearly steals the show from the Caped Crusader.
42;These two performances alone just about make the movie what it is, and behind the direction of Tim Burton, create a movie that is really intelligent, moody and layered, but still has the accessible, popcorn movie feel that one should expect from any superhero flick.
43;Batman delivers the goods, with just as much action as there is character development.
44;The story itself may be a bit dodgy, but does a good job of telling the origins of Batman in a quick, and to.
45;So parts of it may be corny and truly dated, but it's still one of the best superhero movies to date.
46;Batman is simply revolutionary, inspiring and way ahead of the curve.
47;Worth watching over and over again.
48;realistic patina that passes for artistry these days.
49;Tim Burton was, and still is, one of the most recognizable stylists of our cinematic era.
50;the way this movie was done, with the dark, gritty, noir.
51;Also, unlike the other films, there's actually a point to the proceedings.
52;jack Nicholson turns in an unforgettable performance as the Joker.
53;He gives the role the life and free.
54;Nicholson walks the tightrope with ease.
55;keaton himself embodies the traits of Bruce Wayne.
56;He's a very quirky individual, both Wayne and Keaton.
57;Not that it matters in a role
58;Most people say that this 'Batman' is like, real, dude.
59;Elfman, more than any other conductor, knows how to compose a recognizable theme that fits in with his subject matter.
60;'Batman' is one of his finest works.
61;This is one comic book film done right.
62;Many have made the mistakes of taking comics and turnig them into bright shiny happy worlds but Batman stayed true and daark so dark at times you will need to turn the light on just to see what is going on.
63;I loved every minute of this film.
64;even the Prince soundtrack and the vision of Nicholson dancing is a hoot.
65;Everyone is familiar with this film but watch it again for Burton's tribute to film noir
66;OK I confess, the movie is good!!
67;As 4 jack, still feel the same BUT he totally plays the part well.
68;After I saw it I looked up back stories and behind the scene stuff and came across this 2 disc recommendation.
69;It was a very interesting concept and many actually prefer this origin for the Joker to the comic version where he's a nice stand up comic who gets involved with the mob but really doesn't want to.
70;He's much better as a character who was always ready to terrorize.
71;This is an excellent film from director Tim Burton, despite a lot of studio interferance like adding Prince, something Burton fought to get removed but, obviously, no dice.
72;This film, like the Frank MIller comics he drew from, set a new tone for Batman in the public eye.
73;Even though Nolan's Batman Begins was far closer to Batman's actual origins and demeanor fromt he comics, Burton's film is still very good as a sort of Elseworlds tale.
74;The first time I saw Batman I was 5 years old.
75;i fell in love with the movie,after that I became a huge Batman fan.
76;tim Burton does a great job in capturing the darkness of Batman unlike joel schumacher did in Batman forever,especially in batman and Robin.
77;michael Keaton does his best performance of his life as batman and bruce Wayne,jack nicholson does a great performance as joker in this movie.
78;i give it a 5/5 rate.
79;Even if Superman is a decent movie, Batman is the real thing
80;stylized film, and his dark version of the superhero paid tribute to the true spirit of the comics, instead of using the style of the TV comedy series
81;In Batman there are a lot of things to enjoy: good performances (Michael Keaton, Jack Nicholson of course, Kim Basinger and Jack Palance, to name a few), good music, great sets, ultra cool gadgets (the Batmovile is amazing) and a very interesting story.
82;a comic superhero film is not an easy to make, but Tim Burton proved to be the right choice in this film.
83;This is one of the best comic.
84;movies ever made,and most certainly,the best Batman movie ever 'till now!!!
85;With a genius director,this movie filed with an epic storyline,characters,and music.
86;joker is maybe the best villain ever appeared in a movie,and the action.
87;scenes are cool ever for 16 years later.
88;This is as good as Batman films come.
89;The others were great, but this one was spectacular.
90;He is my # 1 favorite Bat.
91;Micheal Keaton was a cool actor, as was Jack Nicholson.
92;This film was both action packed and funny.
93;And boy, this movie really lives up to the expectations of the comic.
94;the action is wonderful the gadgets are great and the car is uniquely wonderful.
95;I'm a huge batman fan, and like many others I was waiting for years for the dark knight to get the sort of motion picture treatment that had been so great for the man of steel.
96;I went to see it at least five times and loved it every time.
97;A perfect example is the scene where the Joker sees a picture of Vicki Vale and suddenly becomes obsessed with her for the rest of the movie.
98;a phoney way to create a three way tension between the main characters.
99;It is often described as a `comic book come alive'.
100;Batman's costume is a classic example of style over substance .
101;The Batman I know is an incredible gymnast who can swing through the rooftops.
102;This movie deserves ten stars if possible.
103;Jack Nicholson was the perfect man to be casted as the Joker.
104;In this film Michael Keaton also does a good job as portrating Batman, a dark charocter who fights for justice.
105;This and batman returnes is going to be classics.
106;the charecters are believable and have lots of depth.
107;micheal Keaton is perfect for the batman.You have to get this movie and batman returnes.
108;Anyways jack nicklsen playes as the jocker,a perfect role for him and I dont think any one could have played it better than him.
109;the graphics are preety good concidering the age of this movie.
110;great plot and sound effects.
111;BATMAN is one of the most influential films in recent years.
112;No longer do superheros have to be so darned happy all the time in bright colorful costumes with amazing super powers like Superman, who fight crime just because it's the nice thing to do.
113;the look of the film brought back the brooding art.
114;And of course you get Jack Nicholson and Jack Palance having a great time playing the bad guys!The credit for most of this magic belongs to the imaginative director Tim Burton, who also leaves his mark on any film he touches.
115;One minute the Joker is murdering gangsters in a meeting and the next he's dancing to Prince music while destroying fine art.
116;I also should mention that it has yet another terrific soundtrack by Danny Elfman, who also changed the sound of film music.
117;Knowing what a terrific visionary Tim Burton is, I'm sure there's a lot of great sketches he and his staff did that I'd love to see.
118;I'd also love to hear his commentary to find out what he was thinking while he filmed it.
119;I loved this movie Michael and Jack did a fantastic job!
120;It's like you cant take your eyes of it.
121;Granted,Adam West is the superior Batman/Bruce Wayne.
122;Tim Burton did great on this movie and Batman Returns.
123;The movie of course does not live up to the hype but is a visually dynamic and enjoyable spin on the Batman mythology.
124;Great idea to mix Batman and Prince.
125;ray is very well done and features a beautiful transfer that highlights the dark and moody atmosphere and the wonderful creations of the real star of this movie production designer Anton Furst.
126;I must also give praise to the wonderful music score by Danny Elfman that sounds terrific on the Blu.
127;I would recommend picking this up if you're a Batman fan or just a fan of big over the top extravagant films productions.
128;The extra's on this Blu Ray are excellent.
129;The Good Things*Some good action scenes, especially at the end.
130;Seems very fresh and original.
131;Quite a few strong images.
132;*Production design is completely awesome.
133;Gotham City is very imaginatively designed.
134;The Batmobile is still probably the best in this film.
135;There are loads of nifty gadgets, cool costumes, and good sets.
136;*Characters are good and well.
137;Jack Nicholson makes a good, funny, somewhat menacing Joker.
138;*Music score is good, and there are a few good late 80s songs in there (lots of Prince!)
139;even though the newer Batman films are stronger in a lot of ways, this version is still quite original and entertaining.
140;It has good characters, a pretty good story, and some excellent production designs throughout.
141;The ending has a lot of great action too.
142;Jack Nicholson delivers a great performance (as always), Michael Keaton (sorry Adam West) plays his best role since Mr. Mom (although too monotone), and we can all agree that Alec Baldwin may be one of the luckiest men alive with Kim Bassinger as his wife.
143;By far the best of the Batman series, Tim Burton does a terrific job of keeping the movie dark and the violence to a minimum for the PG.13 rating.
144;It feels unfair to compare Burton's 1989 film with `Batman Begins'
145;i will say this
146;`Batman' is one of the first films to take the `superhero' genre to a serious level, ditching the camp that comes along with most of this franchise and creating a dark and mysterious atmosphere, richly rewarding.
147;Thankfully Christopher Nolan revived it, in a huge way, with `batman Begins' and it looks like `The Dark Knight' will be just as rewarding.
148;Batman also must juggle his personal life (that as Bruce Wayne) when the beautiful photographer Vicki Vale starts making eyes at him.
149;The movie is exciting and entertaining and takes the genre to a place it had yet to be taken.
150;I found Michael Keaton's Batman to be decent, but I found his Bruce Wayne to be stale.
151;Christian Bale brought Bruce Wayne to a whole new level that Keaton couldn't even comprehend.
152;She's pretty and infatuated and she screams a lot (which can get kind of annoying).
153;I'm bracing myself for a lot of `unhelpful' votes here.
154;Let me say this first
155;He is one of my all time favorite actors in the world, and I totally understand that he plays a variation of himself in most every performance he gives, and I like that about him.
156;I hate saying that because this performance is lauded by a lot of people as the performance that makes this movie so great, but honestly I don't see it.
157;As a `superhero' action film `Batman' is top notch.
158;I personally prefer `Batman Begins' but I know a lot of people who prefer Burton's classic.
159;This was a great movie.
160;Flowed perfectly from one scene to the next.
161;It had a strong humorous element as well!
162;I believe this is the best one in the entire series.
163;Jack Nicholson stole the show, he was phenomenal as the Joker!
164;Director Tim Burton and Michael Keaton team up to create THE Batman.
165;Every bit of this movie is entertaining.
166;Keaton plays his dual roles perfectly.
167;Nicholson is so perfect with this part that I think he should've played it again!
168;The music is top notch and provides the necessary mood.
169;The whole atmosphere in this movie is great.
170;most reviewers have already gone over the plot and other aspects of the film (such as Jack Nicholson's amazing performance as The Joker), so I'm going to jump straight into the second disc.
171;The first disc features an entertaining commentary track by Burton himself.
172;It is insightful, informative and at times hilarious, but never annoying like some reviewers say it is.
173;The interviews are all very enjoyable.
174;His comments are a joy to watch.
175;He to this day loves to have been a part the film, and it shows.
176;It is one you will want to reach for over and over again.
177;Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson make this movie more than worthwhile to watch.
178;You get to see two wonderful actors take on the classic good and evil of Batman and The Joker.
179;Great movie, in my opinion, and a great ending.
180;This is one of those types of movies you can watch over and over and over again without ever getting tired of it!
181;star cast,fantastic visual presentation,excellent plot,rememorable lines.
182;If you know someone who has never got into comics this is pretty much a great way to introduce them into it by getting this move.
183;its amazing how visually the presentation of this movie has improved since its theatrical release,very clear,rich,smooth.
184;This movie was great for its time.
185;it was dark, stylish, and comic.
186;It had a clear plot, focused direction, and good pacing.
187;Overall, the acting was good (except Basinger), and the sets were wonderful, especially for the time the movie was released.
188;Keaton's and Nicholson's performances were excellent, and throughout the entire movie, I reminisced on what it was like to be a kid seeing this movie in the theatre for the first time.
189;if anything, this movie is enjoyable for its nostalgic value.
190;I'd give it a 4 1/2 stars if I could.
191;But all that changes after the Batman confronts Carl Grissom's men at Axis Chemicals and Grissom's top hood, Jack Napier, gets dropped into a vat of chemicals, transforming him into the maniacal Joker.
192;michael Keaton takes on the title role as billionaire playboy Bruce Wayne and his rubber.
193;Nicholson does a brilliant job of blending the serious and twisted Joker while also playing the crazy, laughing, psycho killer.
194;Batman shows up all of four times in the film, the first being something, like, only for a minute.
195;bold, atmospheric and downright fun, Batman is one for the ages.
196;Yeah, this'll make her respect me.
197;He also endangers innocent civilians in a car chase(.)
198;The batsuit is more powerful than the batplane?
199;And how true that statement was.
200;Michael Keaton is the best Batman of the films.
201;Batman is a triumph of production design and visual mastery.
202;Jack Nicholson is sensationally funny and evil as the Joker and Michael Keaton plays the double role of Bruce Wayne/Batman works out better than most people tend to think.
203;He plays the character as a brooding neurotic which doesn't tell us much about the character, but it draws us in anyways.
204;And of course, Michael Gough is perfect as Alfred.
205;tim Burton was the perfect director for the film because of his gothic wizardry, as said by another Amazon.
206;Once again, Danny Elfman did the score and created an entirely new Batman theme that's been redone several times.
207;my favorite part in the movie is when the Joker and Batman are doing their final face.
208;I made you, you made me first.
209;The first Batman proved a lot to the movie fans of how Batman SHOULD be made.
210;Simply put, this is the best gothic vision of our favorite caped crusader and all the clones/spin.
211;Batman is the best Super hero out there, and he all ways will be.
212;The movie starts off with awesome music, which gets you ready for a joy ride with no seat belt.
213;Next the movie takes you on a looptyloop when a sinister psychopath is born, lady's and gentlemen I give you the king of laughs, the master of gestures, the ruler of sick demented mind games THE JOKER!
214;The only one who dares to challenge Batman, and that's when your admission is bought for a masterpiece of a movie.
215;BATMAN (1989) is the one Tim Burton film where his directorial style worked in perfect synergy with mainstream Hollywood.
216;They are all great in that Burtonesque way.
217;noirish look, the film still manages to be generally accessible to the mass audience.
218;It moves at a fast, breezy pace and has an epic, Hollywood feel to it, with a satisfying conclusion.
219;Even more so now since it holds up 20+ years later as great entertainment.
220;But I always felt he was the right choice!
221;Keaton captures the guarded loneliness of the Bruce Wayne character, while still being very convincing as a tough guy who can hold his own when donning the cape and cowl!
222;Nicholson is convincing as high.
223;He has so many memorable lines that I think about all the time.
224;kim Basinger (at her most gorgeous!)
225;She ends up falling in love with Bruce Wayne (lucky bastard!)
226;Basinger is the weakest link of the main actors, but she still does a good job of emoting, being simultaneously fascinated and repulsed by Batman and Joker's antics.
227;Can you blame her?The solid supporting cast includes Michael Gough (wonderful turn as Alfred, Bruce's ever.
228;reliable and dependable butler and caretaker), Robert Wuhl (in an energetic turn as Vicki's fellow reporter Alex Knox), Billy Dee Williams (as DA Harvey Dent), and Pat Hingle (as world.
229;In particular, Keaton and Gough have an effortless chemistry as though they have been close their whole lives.
230;as previously stated, I am amazed at how Burton's style fused perfectly with more conventional Hollywood touches and created something special out of it.
231;movie version one extra star each for NOT being packaged with Batman and Robin or Batman Forever.
232;This is an excellent film.
233;I keep reading that the first two Batman movies(Batman and Batman Returns)were dark and evil.
234;Real Batman fans see and appreciate what I'm trying to say here.
235;Michael Keaton gives an outstanding portrayal of the dark knight, Tim Burton did a great job.
236;I hope you enjoy this film.
237;Batman and Batman Returns are the greatest!
238;This one I thought was the best.
239;I just hope they make it quick.
240;Somehow, Burton not only managed to capture the brilliantly dark atmosphere of Gotham City, but also managed to turn Batman into a movie classic combined with outstanding actors and your standard action film motif, rather than a campy hero romp.
241;hero movie (as some of its subsequent films are), but rather reads to me as a very compelling action film with very interesting and mentally deranged characters.
242;The atmosphere of the film shows a seedy world, in which the gadgets, although far.
243;therefore can manage to have recourses beyond others' reach.
244;He has a plane, a great car and a grappling hook!
245;It keeps it pretty down to Earth, as much as a super hero flick CAN.
246;As for the acting, of course, Jack Nicholson will always reign supreme in his performance as Jack Napier/The Joker.
247;I must also say that Michael Keaton is a fantastic Bruce Wayne/Batman.
248;He manages to show internal conflict very well and darkness unmatched by the following Batman actors.
249;For anyone who knocks the design of this film, I must remind those critics that it won an Academy Award for its design.
250;so obviously, it has that going for them.
251;I can only recommend this highly to anyone with any remote curiosity
252;Not Tim Burton's finest but worth watching for Nicholson's Joker.
253;Michael Keaton does a pretty good job as Batman.
254;This Batman was probably the best of the original four by far.
255;Keaton was suprisingly good, able to pull off the quiet and solitary Bruce Wayne, while still nailing the intense and dark Batman.
256;Right away you can tell that Joker was a role Nicholson was born for.
257;He had everything down perfectly, even the insane laugh.
258;This is probably my favorite yet, and hopefully the new one is even better.
259;This film holds a special place in my heart.
260;It's really the film that got me into comic books and solidified Batman as my all.
261;I think the more realistic you can make the characters and their problems the more the audience will be able to connect with them and the story.
262;The Acme Chemical plant and Joker's chopper are the two most obvious and cheesy models used in the film, but the rest are gorgeous and nearly seamless.
263;Plus the Batmobile scenes are breathtaking.
264;I absolutely love, love, love Jack Nicholson's Joker.
265;A lot of reviewers criticized it as over the top and hammy, but that's exactly what the Joker is!
266;depth documentary with new interviews from all the key players (except for Keaton.
267;An Tim Burton who usually gives yawn inspiring commentaries manages to be insightful and informative with his Batman commentary.
268;It's a classic and the best Batman portrayal i've ever seen.
269;Great memories and some new footage makes it a must in my collection.
270;Not much to say that hasn't been said, this is a great movie.
271;ray transfer is well done making it look as good as it did when I saw it in the theaters.
272;comedy, but when this film came along I really started paying attention and I've since become a huge fan (though 'Batman' was recently surpassed for me by 'Sleepy Hollow').
273;Burton has created a dark and vivid version of Gotham City, with soaring gothic churches and dark, foreboding backstreets.
274;Keaton serves as a fine Batman, but he's better in his guise as Bruce Wayne.
275;And Jack Nicholson is a wonderfully malevolent villain, though I prefer my Jokers a little leaner (see Cesar Romero in the original whakkk.
276;joker dynamic explored in so many Batman comics, and the retelling of the Joker's origin is (to my mind) very similar to Alan Moore and Brian Bolland's excellent graphic novel 'The Killing Joke'.
277;The best of the Batman movies, by far.
278;The worldwide success of Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins has prompted Warner Bros. to finally release Tim Burton's 1989 Batman with an extra disc of special features.
279;and this is an event worth cheering about!A groundbreaking cinematic achievement (and one of the most expensive films ever produced, to that time), Batman was a tremendous gamble, and the story behind the ten.year struggle to bring it to the screen is fascinating!
280;this remarkable story, with archival footage and new interviews, is the highlight of disc two, but there is much, much more!
281;winner Anton Furst, could actually do 95 mph (and that Tim Burton drove it, once?)
282;a little girl, seeing Batman, asks, in all seriousness, Is it Halloween?
283;This movie is a Batman movie, from the 40's, Tim Burton and the producers had gone back to Batman's early days as a crimfighter.
284;Micheal Keaton was the perfect choice to play Batman, And Jack's Joker is perfect.
285;As does the mysterious figure, Batman.
286;But he survived the chemicals, and it turns him into THE JOKER.
287;A true Batmobile, that is sleek and menacing.
288;And surpisingly, Kim Basinger's Vickie Vale is a pretty decent Character, even if she gets let into the batcave.
289;And we get one of the greatest moments in the Batman movies, when Bruce wayne suits, and Danny Elfman's score is incredible.
290;He practically gets his ass kicked throughout the whole movie.
291;the batmobile is cool and the batwing is awesome, which brings me to a couple of points.
292;I really loved this video.
293;It will very likely become a classic.
294;I ordered the movie on 12/4/2009 and received it on 12/8/2009 .
295;very prompt and courteous service from bigredsmitty.
296;full of action, adventure, humor, and a good storyline.
297;Michael Keaton, Jack Nicholson, Kim Bassinger, and Robert Wuhl are great in their roles.
298;Coming October 18th are special editions of Batman, Batman Returns, Batman Forever, and Batman and Robin.
299;Happily, I can report that the movie arrived with time to spare, and Jacob has been enjoying Batman immensely!
300;THE Batman film, the only Batman film.
301;Jack Nicholson IS the Joker, his wonderfully overplayed performance capturing the character perfectly and contrasting nicely with Michael Keaton's Bruce Wayne .
302;In the shadows of Gotham, fear has a name, and that name is Batman.
303;I saw Batman with my best friend on opening weekend back in 1989 and I literally had stitches in my side from laughing every time the Joker, who is my all.
304;Jack Nicholson proves yet once again why he has endured for so many years.
305;Batman confronts the two thieves and instructs one of them to tell all his friends about him.
306;Bruce is successful in courting Vale, and the two spend a passionate night together in the mansion.
307;He confronts Grissom, who thinks him dead, revealing his new appearance, with eerie white skin, green hair and a permanent grin.
308;The Joker's plan, and a successful one in that, is to use his knowledge of chemistry to create hygiene products that are dangerous when mixed.

311;up fight, the Joker pulls a gun and asks: Tell me something, friend.
312;The Joker uses a moment of oppurtunity and pushes both Batman and Vicki off the belfry, where they cling to the ledge for their lives.
313;Batman saves Vicki once again at the end, and the two are peaceful in each other's embrace.
314;Thankfully, the powers that be gave us Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson in their respective roles that made this film a classic among Batman fans.
315;Up until the release of The Dark Knight, it was the highest grossing film based on a DC comic book.
316;In my opinion, this movie is the definitive Batman movie.
317;Although there were three more movies to follow after this one, This movie is my most favorite out of them all.
318;Definitely worth getting if you're a Batman fan.
319;As is the usual with movies by the visionary Tim Burton, Batman just reeks of visual style, amazing set design, a great villainous performance, and at the center of it all, a terrific hero.
320;This is the best comic book adaptation ever made, followed closely by its immediate predecessor, Batman Returns, X. men, and The Crow.
321;Whatever happens, it'll be good, `cause that's just my pal Sam, but I doubt if it'll live up to the level the bar for comic book films has been set to, after a masterpiece like Batman.

324;up and red lipstick is astonishing.
325;He is amazing behind the cape and cowl.
326;But the real star of the movie is its director, Tim Burton.
327;His direction of his visual effects and set design is what makes this movie into the dark, atmospheric thriller that it is.
328;The very close second is, of course, the maniacal Joker performance from Nicholson, who is given so many one.
329;A film that was well directed and acted.
330;When I first heard Michael Keaton was cast as Batman I couldn't believe it but after seeing it I was well pleased.
331;disc Special Edition they put out is great.
332;I love all the extras as they get you an inside look at the concept and making of the film.
333;Great movie, but who the heck is Michael Balfour?!
334;For those of you who follow my reviews, you know that I like most things that have to do with Batman.
335;As a child, I really liked the Adam West episodes.
336;And Tim Burton did a really great job of bringing back some of the original foundation, but at the same time bringing enough of his own dark and gothic signatures into the picture to allow Batman to transcend into the 80s.
337;Gough is excellent as the ever loyal Alfred.
338;Jack Nicholson did a very good job of taking the baton from Cesar Romero and bringing the Joker into the 80s.
339;Bassinger is fine as the lady in Bruce Wayne // Batman's life who carries some intelligence, purpose, and dignity.
340;Alexander Knox is fine as the character who in doing his job crosses the path of Bruce Wayne // Batman.
341;Finally, the scenery, musical tracks, suspense, and acting are all top notch.
342;(I would like to say look at the fight between Patrick Swayzee and Jimmy in RoadHouse), but I'll keep it closer to home.
343;If you like this movie, be sure to see Part 2 Batman Returns.
344;Great movie that started the Batman movie franchise.
345;2 disc edition coming out October 18th, along with a Batman Returns special edition!
346;Despite the sequels and the fanfare of the reboot, this remains my favorite Batman movie.
347;Nicholson as the Joker was solid casting, and he gave a brilliant performance.
348;Whereas Dark Knight was endlessly gritty and tense, Batman was both dramatic and fun.
349;I'm a tremendous Batman fan (the comic character) and during Dark Knight I felt like I was sitting through an endurance contest rather than something I'd assumed would be entertainment.
350;it was a tremendous achievement.
351;The moode was a bit better with Batman Begins, and the origin story was very interesting.
352;Images and sound are top notch
353;I now enjoy this movie for all its worth.
354;so I was pleasantly surprised with Jacks performance, (Absolutely fabulous!!)
355;We see the inevitable meeting between these two characters and wait to see the sparks fly!!
356;This movie is, in my opinion, one the best comic book movie adaptions of all time, right up there with Superman I&II!
357;Michael Keaton as Batman and Jack Nicholson as The Joker were perfect choices for their roles.
358;Robert Wuhl brought a since of comedy to the movie that was refreshing, and Kim Bassinger, as usual, was gorgeous in her performance as reporter Vicki Vale.
359;The scenary, and overall style of the movie was outstanding, and there was a darkness brought to the movie that was lacking in previous Batman projects.
360;The Batmobile looked sleek and powerful, and the Batcave was resembled perfectly.
361;Overall, this movie, if anyone is a Batman fan such as myself, will love this movie!
362;If this is a line the Joker uses all the time, he should get it right every single time.
363;Most of the scenes are shot close up, and you never truly get to see the grandeur of Gotham as a big, sprawling city.
364;i much prefer the more realistic and gritty take that Christopher Nolan took on his series.
365;Director Tim Burton absorbed all the important lessons to be learned from the four Superman movies and added his own unique (some might say warped) vision to 'Batman', successfully moving the motion picture superhero genre to the next level.
366;date black comedy that caused one to both laugh and cringe at the same time.
367;a great beginning for the Batman series that would spawn three sequels.
368;Study the background scenery of Gotham City and you'll see just how much Burton's vision has influenced the genre for decades to come.
369;this movie is cool, see it or die
370;There's just something about this movie that's magical to me.
371;Tim Burton was at his best back then and he still makes pretty descent movies to this very day.
372;Both this movie and Batman Returns were great movies.
373;Pass on the nostalgia to your children.
374;I remembered watching this movie as a kid and thinking it was super amazing.
375;OK . . . a little bit of corn here and there but hey . . . it's still a treat!
376;What surprised the entire civilized world was how intense, dark, and mystically provocative the film turned out to be.
377;The hyestrical dementia of Jack Napier's tansformation into the Joker is so colorfully recreated for Batman with such comical flourish and enthusiasm that Nicholson creates another one of his unforgettable screen personas.
378;Nicholson's Joker maybe a sterotype but he is a lavishely entertaining character that obviously propelled the movie more than any other element.
379;Watch Batman for its unapprecaited gothic atmoshere, zany performances, and genuinely magnificent atmosphere.
380;This was Tim Burton's entrance into mainstream cineama as a considerable talent, and even eleven years later the film is still an enchanting walk into the macabre mind of a master filmmaker.
381;This is and was the best Batman movie until the new ones hit the screens.
382;A must see and own for Batman fans.
383;Batman is a great comic book movie.
384;Jack gives an inspired effort as the Joker, Michael Keaton does well as Bruce Wayne and Batman.
385;The supporting cast do a good job Jack Palance stands out.
386;It has a great music, i like what Danny Elfman did in this movie, i wouldnt think of any other kind of music for this kind of Hero.
387;The music is so adecuate for the movie and the character.
388;Jack Nicholson is just great, but old.
389;If he were the Jack Nicholson from The Shining, that would be a great acting and a very extremely cool Joker.
390;But talking about the devil, the Batman was great.
391;i liked this movie, you star having a crush on the batmobile and on the bat.
392;its just so great to see him this way.
393;It's like going into the theater and watching it again.
394;The sound is also are major improvement.
395;That opening credits score still to this day gives me goosebumps.
396;Danny Elfman's score is actually better than Hans Zimmer's score from the new films in my opinion.
397;Michael Keaton looks fantastic in that batsuit even to this day!
398;Tim Burton does an excellent job at updating Bob Kane's crimefighting superhero to the late eighties.
399;Michael Keaton does a great job in his portrayal of our hero.
400;Jack Nicholson has had a long, distinguished, and enviable career in films
401;Overall, enjoyable by the average summer matinee movie junkie.
402;Looking back, it still has 80% of the wonder but 100% of the fun.
403;top gestures, smart dialog and glorious music.
404;Even my teenaged son loved it.
405;superhero movies such as The Dark Knight and The Avengers continue to dazzle and amaze audiences with spectacular special effects and genre.
406;For while it may not have had the technological advancements at the time to provide stunning effects and epic storytelling, Tim Burton's directorial effort in Batman is, without question, one of most talented and intelligent efforts ever made in film itself .
407;i'll forgo any plot description as I'm sure it's quite well known by this point and more importantly because the plot acts merely as a sandbox for much more brilliant achievements in acting, directing and cinematography.
408;the first I'll touch upon is the cinematography.
409;The beautifully rendered gothic landscape that Anton Furst creates in the sets and scenery of Batman is immediately evident upon first viewing of the film.
410;Instead of having to show their story, the subtleties of their dramas and characters, they can simply say it, and depends with a lot of visual setup and style.
411;it is that silent film element that really makes Burton's Batman exceptional, and really unlike any other film made since the silent era.
412;the first way in which he does this is to always show Batman from an outsider's perspective (generally, Vicki's perspective).
413;Burton even uses lighting to highlight and display Batman's subtle eye or facial movements .
414;Few seem to realize it upon first viewing, but Keaton turns in probably the most subtle and brilliant acting performances of any comic book movie before or since.
415;In compliment to Burton's visual storytelling, Keaton mirrors the silent style of filmmaking by conveying the majority of his character's emotions through both facial expressions and emoting through the eyes.
416;but upon closer inspection, it's really Keaton who steals the show in Batman by portraying the character as both wholly sympathetic and always latently psychotic.
417;Yet, astonishingly, Keaton manages to blend these to aspects together with incredible ease
418;set) weaves in numerous subtle character arcs and story beats that seem simple .
419;but through subsequent viewings can be deemed extremely intricate and expertly executed exposition.
420;to the simply brilliant relationship built between Michael Gough's Alfred and Bruce .
421;Burton continuously weaves a simple narrative bursting with psychological meaning and emotion.
422;but when analyzed with a keen and disconcerting eye, the amount of intelligence and detail weaved into the execution of Batman far exceeds most of the directorial efforts in the history of American film.
423;should be considered one of the best tributes to that sophisticated and timeless style.
424;Dark, mysterious, intriguing is what Batman is characterized in this film.
425;this is one of Michael Keaton's (Bruce Wayne, Batman) best work, aswell with Jack Nicholson (The Joker) who gives one of the best evil geniuses characters based on a book come to life.
426;director Tim Burton knew from the start how Batman should be shown on screen and he couldnt have done it more perfect.
427;He does it again with 'Batman Return' which is also extraordinary like this one.
428;I have always loved this movie, and now it's nice to have it on blu ray.
429;The newer dark knight films are great, don't get me wrong, but this is the start of Batman going in the right direction (until Schumacher took over and took it in directions that it almost didn't come back from) Unique and visionary with a killer soundtrack by Prince.
430;The book is full of colorful images from the movie and lots of insight on the characters evolution as well as the evolution of the movie.
431;They are great and good conversation pieces.
432;This is a classic movie that is now presented on a great D. v. d. Tim Burton really outdid himself with this film.
433;this movie was incredibly successful and spawned a series of remakes where the franchise was able to survive even when the movies were bad.
434;Michael Keaton stars as Bruce Wayne/Batman and turns in an excellent performance that exhibits the right amount of dark brooding.
435;jack Nicholson was an excellent choice to play the psychopathic Joker, a man that jokes about everything, even his killing of innocents.
436;His nonchalance over his crimes yet clear intelligence are the characteristics that a non.
437;Kim Bassinger plays journalist Vicki Vale, Wayne's love interest and a capable woman on her own.
438;This helped make the movie stronger
439;this movie remains my favorite Batman movie, Keaton plays the role with just the right combination of angst and courage and the other characters are also very strong and complementary.
440;Micheal Keaton was the best Batman of all and Jack Nicolson as the Joker made to movie as close as you can get to the original comic charaters.
441;And lastly the blockbuster that it was.
442;A classic movie from when I was young.
443;The condition is great and both of the discs work great, and play all the way through fine.
444;Instead, we watched this, and they loved it!
445;winner:Jack Nicholson) turns himself as The Joker, Who wants to take Control of the City of Gotham.
446;Nicholson steals the film here.
447;Although it falls flat at the film last half hour but it's still entertaining.
448;This film has a Fine Supporting Cast including:Oscar.
449;I have loved this movie since I was a child.
450;While I do remember the Adam West Batman show, this is when I really got into Batman.
451;Definitely a fun movie that is enjoyable today.
452;ray transfer is pretty good as well!
453;To this day, I still watch it from time to time.
454;Jack Nicholson's take on the Joker shattered the ceiling for the time and era this film was made, and Michael Keaton still stands out as one of the best actors to fill the role of Batman.
455;Jack Nicholson is a heinous genius joker.
456;Best Batman movie there is.
457;It's just an awesome Batman movie that you can laugh with also.
458;This is undeniably the best in the whole Batman series.
459;The Joker is by far the best of the film though Jack Nicholson is a bit annoying but his perfomance is outstanding.
460;It is scary in the way Joker falls into acid, his girlfiends new face is very creepy, but this movie is the best in the whole series and it definitley deserved the MAJOR credit it got.
461;The dark knight debut is amazingly well done by the awesome director Tim Burton.
462;I remember seeing this film for the first time a long time ago.
463;This is one film that is a favorite just the mega popular film Ghostbusters!!
464;to honor the memory of this beloved film, Warner Brothers has released this 20th Anniversary blu.
465;This edition gives us a great print of the film, along with hours of great special features documenting the making of the film as well as Batman fandom.
466;ray release, but this edition comes with an excellent behind.
467;ray case, and also includes an excerpt from a comic adaptations of the film, which is quite excellent.
468;for fans of the film, this is THE blu.
469;It all starts here, with nods to Frank Miller, Burton gets it right.
470;For some points, the movie was definitely a disappointment, but in other ways, it was also one of the best superhero films I saw.
471;For the good points, I did enjoy the dark tone of the film.
472;this film serves the purpose well, much better than the Joel Schumacher films that tried to turn him into a comedian.
473;The grime and grit of the city is well displayed.
474;I liked the touch of the corrupt cops.
475;The villain, Joker, is also one of my favorite.
476;Jack Nicholson gives a great performance .
477;I was a bit surprised she slept with Bruce Wayne the first date.
478;Nicholson not only has more screen time than Keaton but is a far more interesting and entertaining character.
479;The dark visual atmosphere and Gotham's matte painting background also keep things more cartoony and fun than disturbing.
480;Burton has a very active camera style that, especially in Joker's scenes, pays off splendidly.
481;The camera movement works on both an artistic level and keeps the film's pace flowing at all times.
482;wall energy and essentially makes the film.
483;It has it's iconic scenes (THE MIRROR!
484;With subtle rage and supressed emotion.
485;this is what Batman truly was, and Keaton pulled it off masterfully.
486;What can be said about Nicholson as The Joker, except easily the best villian characterization we have seen on silver screen.
487;Nice twist by having Bruce Wayne and Jack Napier contribute to each others retreat into their alter egos.
488;Tim Burton hits the look and feel of Batman, Bruce Wayne and Gotham City on the head.
489;The music of Danny Elfman and Prince are right on target.
490;certainly a top 3 comic adaptation.
491;Michael Keaton was the best Batman.
492;Jack N. brought many levels to the joker.
493;introduction of Batman to the big screen in 1989 really got rolling when Nicholson's The Joker came on screen.
494;Then it took off and became wildly entertaining.
495;besides the stylish visuals, they didn't overdo the violence, either, and it wound up being a pretty good movie.
496;Jack Nicholson's Joker is a performance for the ages .
497;Egoistic misanthropy and callous disregard for life have exponentially exploded among our species since the great actor's wild parody of the sins of the Me Generation.
498;In my opinion, this performance is Nicolson's greatest .
499;The soundtrack is my favorite extended effort of Prince.
500;And it's great to have it in such a technically superior package.
501;To be seen in conjunction with reading the amazing Rise and Fall of the Guber Brothers .
502;John Lajoie said it best.
503;Yes, cheese is everywhere but the Batmen were of the comic version I knew and loved.
504;When you get right down to it, Jack Nicholson pretty much carries this film on his shoulders, as it doesn't have the greatest of plots, the whole modern remaking of the Batman mystique results in several drawn.
505;this is, after all, Batman's primary personal enemy.
506;To some degree, The Joker created Batman and Batman created the Joker (and they also seem to share the same taste in women).
507;This was good news for Jack Nicholson because Palance is one of the few actors who could have held his own and taken some of the spotlight away from him.
508;The scene where Nicholson impersonates Palance is priceless, though.
509;Nicholson really gets all of the good lines here (e. g., Wait'll they get a load of me), and he pretty much lets himself go wild playing this insane character.
510;It's interesting that the guy playing Batman doesn't get top billing in a Batman movie, but Nicholson definitely deserved that honor for this film.
511;This is the first time I watched this movie in about twenty years and I still love it.
512;Jack Nicholason was a great joker and I love his devilish smile.
513;Michael Keaton did a great job playing batman.
514;I love Jack and Keeton impresses me as the best Bruce Wayne of any of the Batmans.
515;It is always the original which is best in the series.
516;The 1989 blockbuster Batman delivers this.
517;It is hard to talk great about the Batman series thanks to Joel Schummacher who took over and made the last two batman films: Forever and Batman and Robin both were terrible in thier own rights.
518;But Tim Burton who directed this film and Returns got it right.
519;Michael Keaton still is the best on screen Batman, as he says few words to add to the mystery.
520;Let us also not forget a great supporting cast including Robert Wuhl, Jerry Hall, Jack Palance, Billy Dee Williams, and Michael Gough as Alfred.
521;To this day it is still the greatest Batman ever made.
522;But the first still the best.
523;but i could be wrong when i see another great actor named Christian Bale don the bat suit in Batman Begins, unitl then the first is the best.
524;BATMAN is more a Tim Burton movie than a comic book adaptation.
525;Gotham City is clearly a creation of the artist who will build the world of EDWARD SCISSORHANDS one year later.
526;He has to wear a mask to protect his face.
527;He loves to work on raw material (pitiful Jerry Hall!)
528;Tim Burton doing what he does best!
529;Loved the comic book feel of the movie.
530;They did a good job on this blu.
531;Tim Burton's Batman redefined what a comic.
532;book movie should look like.
533;This is an unforgetable film for those of us who saw it in 1989.
534;There's plenty that Warners could have included here .
535;Batman movies with The Joker are the best of the lot, Nicholson in this one and Ledger in The Dark Knight.
536;This was a treat to every fan of the old TV show, with badass Batgadgets, real bullets and real ass.
537;Now I know I previously praised that film but the original is undoubtedly the best.
538;Michael Keaton is my favorite of all the movie incarnations.
539;Keaton handles the action well and the quiet moments are standout (there aren't really any quiet moments [except in Returns] in any of the sequels).
540;Kim Basinger is good as Vicki, noting that she's essentially a knockoff of Lois Lane back in the 50s.
541;And Nicholson is my favorite modern live.
542;Michael Gough's Alfred is good but I prefer the Michael Caine version as he's more involved with things.
543;Today's summer blockbusters are swamped with them.
544;Burton's movie then deserves our respect.
545;ray release contains a bumper list of special features a 72 minute documentary, an enthusiastic Tim Burton commentary, and (most interesting for me) a 41 minute exploration of the history of Batman.
546;ray release is definitely the way to go.
547;several hours of documentary segments that are very informative, from information about the Batman mythos to the production of the movie.
548;There are 3 Prince music videos, a great commentary with Tim Burton.
549;It was great seeing this movie.
550;Also great to actually understand what Batman is saying.
551;It's interesting watching the first installment some 16 years after it's initial release divorced from the hype and the phenomenon it was.
552;Michael Keaton gives an interesting reading as Bruce Wayne/Batman, a kind of stoicism with personal demons bubbling under the surface.
553;Much was made of the look of the film, which won an Oscar for art director Anton Furst (Full Metal Jacket).
554;The look of Gotham City can best be described as decaying industrial gothic.
555;Unlike alot of films nowadays, with the exception of the Spiderman films, character and story come first here and that's the reason Batman holds up so well.
556;which is a good start on nicholson's part.
557;So many reviews are on the spot about this movie .
558;brilliantly filmed and acted, and the sets, wow!
559;, what I can say but that they are perfect?
560;This is Batman the way Batman should be .
561;It's also Gotham the way it should be .
562;who is an absolutely rotten Batman .
563;Keaton has perfect reserve and intensity in this role.
564;jack Nicholson of course is a wonderful Joker.
565;One can see that Jack was absolutely enjoying his acting time, and really put himself into it.
566;Jack Palance as the whispering evil guy is also a perfect addition to the mood of the film.
567;Although Nicholson really takes the screen in any scene he is in, Keaton is the real standout in this movie .
568;perfectly quirky as Bruce Wayne, the man who is rather shy and nervous around people, but perfectly determined and confident when being Batman.
569;this is the best superhero movie that has been made (in my opinion) in terms of being true to the hero, and in terms of artistic merit in cinematography, writing, set design, costume design, and acting.
570;this is first and foremost an artistic movie, and it just happens to be about a superhero.
571;When I heard that they casted the guy who played Beetlejuice (that's right, Beetlejuice) as Batman, I couldn't help but laugh at him through the entire film!
572;If you do, you'll mis an incredible performance by Jack Nicholson.
573;Just as good as the day I saw it in the theater way back in June 1989.
574;Some elitist fans bag on the Burton and Shumacher films but I find the two Burton films hold up extremely well.
575;Keaton is still my all time favorite Batman/Bruce Wayne.
576;Burton's films have always had a nice balance of comic book fantasy and reality, I don't think anyone has done it better than he has.
577;the acting is superb, especially by Mr. Jack Nicholson, who can't seem to do any wrong with any character he plays.
578;and tim burton does a wonderful job in creating the dark world of Gotham City.
579;also top notch is the score by Danny Elfman who set himself apart from other composers with this score.
580;Many of their stories from the past 25 years (or so) have great dialouge, complex characters and memorable plots.
581;The comics themselves are very like movie story.
582;While the finished film was a step down from its own utterly brilliant trailer, Batman is still very watchable today.
583;Michael Keaton actually plays Bruce Wayne as a human being.
584;Jack Nicholson is clearly great as the Joker.
585;The supporting cast is mostly excellent, except pointless Robert Wuhl.
586;tim Burton creates a total world that enables these extreme characters to make dramatic sense.
587;Anton Furst brings a brilliant production design to the film that has influenced every design of a comic book film since.
588;even the script is pretty good.
589;The story is fairly faithful to the source material and the one.
590;That is about all you can ask from a big summer movie.
591;worthy performance (though I think George Clooney could give him a run for his money) as the title character, yet, of course, is overshadowed by his painted counterpart, played brilliantly by Jack Nicholson.
592;Kim Basinger is the second best Blonde in the bunch (Michelle Pfieffer is the Queen), and really adds a punch.
593;The storyline is weak if you think too hard, like I do, but it's fun.
594;Reall, three and a half stars.
595;A great outing, equalled by Forever, yet surpassed by Returns.
596;All I can say is that this film is even more incredible when you add the widescreen picture(it also features a standard version) and Dolby Digital sound to the movie.
597;tim Burton has made some of the best movies to come out in recent years, most notably Edward Scissorhands and Sleepy Hollow.
598;He created a Batman here that was (please forgive me) even better than the comic book series.
599;The film has a dark, industrial look throughout the film, with little color and a very dark brooding musical score by Danny Elfman.
600;But in his path is the Joker, played by the always fabulous Jack Nicholson.
601;While there is not as much action in this like the other 3 films, it is the best one when it comes to acting, directing, and overall feel.
602;vicky Vale is a pretty photo.
603;He now is disfigured and insane.
604;bruce Wayne is a billionare living with his butler, Alfred.
605;Will Vicky ever discover the true identity of this Batman?
606;Find out and see!OPINION: Another great Tim Burton movie!
607;It's a great superhero movie, filled with action, gadgets, and fun!One of the best parts of this movie is the Joker.
608;So random and funny, in a dark way.
609;oVERALL: A great superero movie that's perfect for a Saturday night.
610;Oh all the great memories of the early I have when I was watching the first and arguably the best entry in the Batman movie series!
611;I just can't help but still love every moment of this movie and I still watch it countless times even after 15 years since first seeing it.
612;With the help of Tim Burton and a really excellent plot, Batman is a candidate for the best Batman movie ever made.
613;The other one is it's sequel Batman Returns which is just about as good but is a lot colder and more dramatic.
614;tim Burton was the most perfect director for not only this movie but for the general Batman movie franchise.
615;His movies showcase an unbelievably imaginary world with very eccentric, and even Gothic overtones and Batman was meant to be directed by Burton and it was and the final result is likely one of his greatest achievements of his entire career although a lot of his other films do offer competition in that title.
616;His personality and dangerous character are brought to life by Nicholson and that classic malicious smile was dead on perfect!
617;Nicholson's portrayal as The Joker was phenomenal and the result is arguably the best batman villain of all time.
618;i still to this day love this movie not only for it's action but also for it's combination of comedic humor in some areas but also how it blends some of those humor moments into the otherwise heavily dark and dramatic undertones of the movie.
619;The music by Danny Elfman is amazing and the result is a really fantastic score.
620;I also enjoy some of the classics by Prince who recorded a really great soundtrack for this movie.
621;Tim Burton's directing is absolutely amazing and how he puts his strange and often eccentric Gothic undertone visuals is just mind.
622;The sequel Batman Returns also benefits from the same styles of this movie.
623;The third one Forever was a lot of fun and had a lot of good moments but it lacked the maturity of the first two.
624;if they can get themselves out of their collapsing chairs, then a Special Edition of this movie as well as Batman Returns and Batman Forever would do major wonders for these films.
625;Amazon,This was quite a feat in getting my hands on this item.
626;a great addition to my ever growing Bat collection.
627;it always shows that its worth traveling theuncharted Amazon for deals (Smile)
628;Hollywood has a penchant for making great movies and then putting out beyond crappy sequels that have zip to do with the original.
629;While Tim Burton's sets and movie making have become predictable, he made quite an impression in 1989 with Batman.
630;The movie did receive one of the greatest amounts of publicity I had ever seen until that point in time (we kept hearing about how much money it cost to make) but this is actually one film that deserved the copious amount of hype.
631;michael Keaton (fresh off Beetlejuice, another Tim Burton film), Kim Basinger, and Jack Nicholson had great chemistry.
632;batman is one of those movies that stands out from the rest.
633;It was original and innovative.
634;Now in blu ray the experience is that much better the only complaint is no deleted scenes and yes they exist my favorite ending in any movie is in this 1.
635;This British import is region.
636;free and will play perfectly on U. s. BD players.
637;this 1989 original is still my favorite modern Bat.
638;When this movie was released in 1989 it was the most successful movie that year and rightly so.
639;Everything about it is truly fantastic.
640;Tim Burton's vision of the film remains true to the original DC comics, he keeps it realistic by making Gotham city dark and brooding and this in my opinion is still his best film to date.
641;But Michael Keaton is just superb in the title role he captures the realism of Bruce Wayne and Batman perfectly and he is still the best actor to play batman to date.
642;Jack Nicholson is also fantastic as the Joker his villainy and hillarious wickedness makes every scene that he is in a joy to watch, yet again he proves just how good an actor he is.
643;kim Basinger is the love interest of Batman and she does well in the role, Michael Gough is also very good as Alfred.
644;the art direction of the movie won an oscar and it deserved it because of the vision of Gotham city well done Anto Furst.
645;Danny Elfman's music score is so good because it suits the film remarkably well.
646;This film is a masterpiece in my opinion worth watching just for Keaton and Nicholsons performance alone.
647;Tim Burton does a fantastic job of transposing his dark, nightmarish vision of Gotham City onto the widescreen in this Superhero effort.
648;The cast includes the top.
649;notch acting talents of Micheal Keaton, Jack Palance and Jack Nicholson.
650;The special effects are well done, the sound of the Batmobile is terrific and the Bat cave looks like something out of Dante's INFERNO.
651;tobey Maguire is a small fellow, but he made a terrific SPIDERMAN.
652;That's because SPIDERMAN has genuine Super.
653;on the upside, Keaton's acting ability does account for some measure of why this movie is worth seeing.
654;He does a splendid job of portraying an emotionally tormented man who leads the double life of ordinary person and Superhero.
655;Furthermore, Nicholson is outstanding as Batman's arch.
656;all, I rate this film a 3 star effort.
657;1989's Batman was rightly a cinematic hit.
658;Directed by Tim Burton, it features a dark and brooding storyline, amazing sets, a well.
659;michael Keaton was a surprising choice as the Dark Knight, by day a weathly philanthropist, by night the Caped Crusader.
660;Keaton's touch is to portray on.
661;screen, and successfully, the motivation of a scarred childhood that drives Bruce Wayne to create and live through his alter.
662;armored suit, using a variety of gadgets to come and go from crime scenes.
663;batman's opponent in this film is the Joker, played with over.
664;top maniacal evil by Jack Nicholson in an Academy.
665;beautiful photojournalist Vickie Vale, earnestly played by Kim Basinger, becomes the object of desire of both men.
666;burton's superb direction takes full advantage of the brooding, spectacular and vaguely retro sets
667;this movie is highly recommended as excellent entertainment for fans of the Batman franchise.
668;ray is packed with special features including comentary, cast interviews, music videos and more.
669;those looking to save a few bucks will be satisfied with this version.
670;Jack Nicholson also pulls off a great role as the psychotic Joker.
671;The writers did a very good job on the story.
672;disc special edition next year for the film's 15th anniversary, complete with a theatrical trailer, deleted scenes, and possibly a commentary.
673;Anyway, I highly recommend this to anyone.
674;my favorite line from the movie:Mugger: Don't kill me.
675;I want you to do me a favor.
676;I remember watching this movie and wanting to love it since I am a fan of Batman but things just never jelled for me.
677;There is plenty of eye candy to go around in this version of Gotham City.
678;the Danny Elfman score is outstanding, Kim Basinger is entirely forgettable, Michael Keaton is decent, the Prince song near the end was too much and the Batmobile is a sight to behold!
679;TONS of cool features including Tim Burton commentary .
680;Amazing edition of an amazing movie.
681;this is yet another burton masterpiece.
682;I think is a great film, altough is not a perfect film, it is the best of the Burton/Schumacher era of Batman movies.
683;THe film is visually stunning.
684;Tim Burton also adds his his usual goth look to this film.
685;THe performance by Nicholson as the JOker was really good, he was the perfect actor to play the JOker.
686;The rest of the cast also do quite well.
687;iN the end this was a great, entertaining Batman film, although it was not very faithful to the comics, it did make people forget about the campy 1960's Adam West Batman.
688;It is really a matter of taste.
689;Excellent director, great actors, outstanding special effects, and a wonderful soundtrack.
690;Michael Keaton delivered an outstanding performance as Batman.
691;You'll see how amazing and versatile Keaton can be.
692;Nevertheless, I give credit for the new Batman Begins and Christian Bales' excellent work as Batman.
693;I may be partially biased since this is one of my favorite childhood movies, but I still think this is a great movie.
694;Michael Keaton looks and does great as Batman, as does Jack Nicholson as the Joker.
695;Captures the gritty, dark atmosphere that is Batman.
696;The item came on time and was just as described and worth the requiring for my good size movie collection.
697;Probably everyone knows the story of Tim Burton's mental breakdown during and after the filming of BATMAN.
698;For those who don't: Burton was a modest, small.
699;fry director and Warner Brothers approaches him with what was to be the biggest action.
700;superhero movie of all time.
701;The storyline is solid, the look is all Frank Miller, although Bob Kane was directly hands.
702;i want to make an aside about the soundtrack, composed and much performed by Danny Elfman (when it wasn't the big orchestra).
703;In a way, he fits really well.
704;What is unfair is that Keaton set the standard for the portrayal of Batman and Bruce Wayne.
705;We said, well, we know masters and great fighters who are puny.
706;We knew Keaton had tremendous potential: indeed, the Batman performances post.
707;Still, I wonder if he'd do it again, just to make us all happy again.
708;I loved that a good guy, albeit it a billionaire, was doing truly good things.
709;I loved that he dressed up just to scare the pants of the criminals.
710;head directed this, and I love Elfman's rousing score (the overture has been compared to Beethoven, so listen up for it).
711;And I love that the 1980s went out with this summer blockbusting BANG!!
712;I think he does an excellent job.
713;This is a pretty good movie.
714;It's fun to watch when you want to watch something crazy.
715;It's pretty interesting to see the special effects and stuff though.
716;The intro with Danny Elfman's theme is excellent followed by the family lost in Gothom, which is pure brilliance.
717;Here we see a man and a women with their son coming out of the theater.
718;perhaps I have been overly critical of the movie's flaws and it is important to keep them in perspective.
719;This movie is far superior to any of the other live action portrayals of Batman (except for Batman: Returns which is almost as good).
720;If one compares it to the cartoon movies it comes in just under the excellent Mask of the Phantasm.
721;I highly anticipated this film when it was being made, however I was greatly disappointed.
722;If you want to see some really good Batman, try the unedited version of Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker.
723;The original was and always will be the best, they keep remaking Batman but as far as I'm concerned Michael Keaton and Jack Nichols as the Joker set the standard they keep trying to re.
724;This film represented a giant step forward in comic book adaptations, and, 19 years later, remains in the top tier of this peculiar drama.
725;this film is unique among the many cinematic versions of Batman in various ways, but one of the most important is the fact that in the beginning of the story the audience does not see the action from the perspective of Batman or Bruce Wayne but from other characters.
726;Rather, a mystique is created and Batman emerges by bits and pieces.
727;All of which are also found in the classic Batman comics.
728;The special effects are good and hold up well, 19 years later.
729;also, since most of the time you only see brief glimpses of Batman, it helps to maintain the mystique.
730;Batman, when properly handled, is a very compelling character.
731;great, even Kim Basinger, who was never that much of a master thespian.
732;The guys who play Alfred and Commissioner Gordon are really excellent, as is Billy Dee Williams as Harvey Dent, DA.
733;Prior to the release of this film, a lot of the fan.
734;I'm excluding Schumacher's Batman (Batman Forever, Batman and Robin), the 1960's Batman series, and The Batman, simply because I believe they are the weakest representations.
735;to be perfectly honest, I love Burton, Nolan, and BTAS equally.
736;So here it goes with MY opinions:BATMAN: Michael Keaton, Kevin Conroy, and Christian Bale have given us excellent performances.
737;Conroy (from BTAS) has the perfect voice for Batman, though the physical depiction seems a bit too much.
738;He has the awkwardness and the eccentricity of the character, and plus his hoarse voice for the Bat is far superior to Bale's.
739;The Penguin, one of my favorite Batman villains, has been blessed with both BReturns and BTAS.
740;Danny Devito and Paul Williams have done superb jobs with this antagonist.
741;All three of them are perfect.
742;Nicholson has the best dialogue, Hamill has the best laugh and look, and Ledger has the best sadism.
743;Efrem Zimbalist Jr. and Michael Gough are the ideal Alfred's.
744;Billy Dee Williams was great in B89, also, and he had the tough and virtuous personality, as did Richard Moll in BTAS.
745;gOTHAM CITY: Burton captured the dark and gothic feel of the hellish city perfectly.
746;You gotta give credit to Anton Furst, the film's art director, for creating this atmospheric universe.
747;Gotham in BTAS also has its advantages.
748;Keaton's Batsuit is classic, while Conroy's cape and cowl is ultimately frightening.
749;The heroines (Basinger, Holmes, and Gyllenhaal) are lovely additions, although I wish Basinger would stop screaming throughout B89.
750;Tim Burton's Batman balances the Batman saga with wonderful drama, dark tones, and just enough camp to make it feel like a Batman film.
751;Each scene is stolen in this original by a wonderful turn as Joker, by Jack Nicholson.
752;Michael Keaton shines as the original Batman.
753;The sets, the lighting, and the mood of Tim Burton and create a world for Batman like no other film has.
754;the stage set here for probably the best Batman of the whole bunch, Batman returns, Tim Burton last Batman film.
755;I already own this fine film on VHS.
756;The film is excellent and is worth 5 stars.
757;I remember a behind the scenes special and a whole lot more.
758;If you want the film only, its worth it.
759;This is a fantastic movie, believe me.
760;Tim Burton has done his usual wonderful job.
761;The thing about this Batman is the creativity.
762;Batman's outfit (rubber and latex) is one of a kind.
763;Keaton however does a wonderful job of displaying a duel identity.
764;Jack Nicholson as the Joker is wonderful.
765;I am very happy to inform that The Joker's signia hand buzzer and acid flower are in the movie.
766;Very exciting to see him shoot acid at Kim Basinger.
767;To put things over the top, Batman did win an Acadamy Award for Best Art Direction.
768;flick, this 1989 rendition is still a classic!
769;Michael Keaton, while not as brutal or intimidating as Christian Bale's version of Batman, still captures the essence of The Dark Knight!Jack Nicholson as The Joker is still the best villian ever in the whole franchise series!
770;He better be damn good because Nicholson's performance will be a tough act to follow!This version is more Gothic and while spotty in places, it is still a solid flick!
771;Back to the subject at hand, this version has many solid performances!
772;This is absolutely still the best Batman flick.
773;Bale is the 2nd best Batman, Keaton absolutely crushed the role.
774;And Tim Burton's view is so perfect.
775;I know the most recent trilogy is excellent, but not better than this, especially Nicholson's Joker.
776;The first of a series is usually best one and grand kids And I like batman so we are very happy.
777;Finally the best Batman movie been released for the first time with bonus features.
778;Great gift to all the Batman Fans.
779;The funny thing is the first time I saw Batman Begins I thought it's good as orignal 1989 Burton version.
780;So before anyone says B. begins is better go watch it second or third time before you make that final decision.
781;I've just acquired the new special editions of Tim Burton's two Batman films and they are most impressive.
782;The disc has nice extras particularly a fasincating documentary on the history of Batman in the comics, and a thorough documentary which chronicles the making of the movie.
783;Seeing it as a nine.year.
784;The beginning of the movie is great, and the end is great.
785;however, I've always liked Michael Keaton as Batman and Bruce Wayne, and of course Jack Nicholson owns the movie as the Joker.
786;I think Nicholson manages to find just the right mixture of danger and humor that is essential to the character.
787;There's also an excellent supporting cast including Kim Basinger, Michael Gough, Billy Dee Williams, Robert Wuhl, and Pat Hingle.
788;Jack Palance is excellent (briefly) as crime boss Carl Grissom, and Star Wars veteran William Hootkins is suitably slimy as corrupt Lieutenant Eckhardt.
789;of course, the production design is a marvel as well.
790;Anton Furst created a Gotham City that is truly unique and not recognizable as any city on Earth.
791;It feels like a city from the 1940s or '50s, yet it has contemporary aspects as well.
792;Another asset that truly brings the movie to another level is Danny Elfman's classic score.
793;ultimately, Batman was a big.
794;With Batman Returns, Burton was given free creative control and it undeniably bears his distinct stamp.
795;I see Batman as a conventional big.
796;studio movie that Burton did his best with, but Batman Returns is a true Tim Burton movie with his imagination and visual genius free to run wild.
797;I still remember going to see this in the theater when it first came out.
798;it's frankly the ultimate batman.
799;My favorite Superhero movie of all time.
800;The main difference between Chris Nolan's more recent Dark Knight trilogy, and Burton's 1989 version, is the visual style.
801;tim Burton is known for many things, but above all else, it is his bizarre visual eye, a gift that works wonders in Batman.
802;As opposed to Chris Nolan's outings, Tim Burton gives us a Gothic Fantasy of the highest order.
803;Every visual element in this film is perfect
804;Nolan had a way of probing deep into the psyche of his characters, he seems to be a very psychological filmmaker, and he came to with fantastic results.
805;But the 1989 version reigns best of them all.
806;Tim Burton gave us a work of Pop Art, a visual feast.
807;A masterwork of the highest caliber.
808;Tim Burton gave us a classic.
809;perfect, ages incredibly well, and knows what it is.
810;He elevates the medium of film.
811;I have no doubt whatsoever that Batman is one of the finest Blockbusters ever assembled, and one of the best movies ever made.
812;this movie means a lot to me, and a lot to my childhood.
813;Classic Good vs. Evil, rich design, completely unforgettable.
814;But Batman is undeniably the work of a very talented filmmaker.
815;The film is such a powerful experience, a tour de force from beginning to end
816;Batman is so very important to a film fanatic like me.
817;A highly analytical dose of entertainment, the way Burton visually tells the tale is to be admired and studied for its precise tenacity and bold audacity.
818;This one is probably the best in the series, even though `Batman Returns' is in some ways better.
819;As with all the Batman films, here the villain is the one that steals the film, and Jack Nicholson is the best villain of them all.
820;Nicholson steals every scene he is in and ultimately ends up stealing the movie, he is perfect as joker.
821;Sure he goes way over the top at times and shamelessly overacts at others but it's all just a lot of fun and that is the way the joker would of behaves anyway.
822;Much of this film's success and the success of the whole Batman franchise is due to the twisted genius of Tim Burton.
823;He is the one who decided to create a brooding, gothic and very dark Gotham as opposed to the TV series.
824;Michael Keaton is the best Batman of all
825;key performance that is only slightly impressive.
826;The score by Danny Elfman is a knockout and has become one of the most famous of all time.
827;This is also one of the first films that marked Burton's brand of `twisted noir' as I call it.
828;From a scale of 1.10 I give this film a 7!
829;The legendary telling of Batman's Story.
830;In my opinion, It's the first Superhero movie with the right stuff.
831;The camera shifts in and out of several tunnels and curves to be revealed later, and well done, the unforgettable Batman Symbol.
832;take the setting: Typicl Gotham which is a cross between the gritty new york streets and the L. a. ones.
833;Shrouded in architectual beauty and shadowey magnificance.
834;take the hero: Batman, in this movie, is just starting to become a legend.
835;The Perfect Adversary.You'll see stunts, gadjets, comic.
836;It's the one movie that inspires would.
837;This is a solid film.
838;I like Batman Begins more .
839;Yes, Tim Burton's directing is excellent, the visuals are respectable, and I like Prince's soundtrack a good deal more than I probably should (favorite songs: Partyman, Scandalous and Trust).
840;Visually, the film is a marvel .
841;This enough to make it a good, 3.5 to 4.
842;but here's what brings it over the edge: The Joker.
843;Jack Nicholson outdoes himself from his first appearance as the full.
844;liners, equipped with many memorable props, including a boxing glove on a spring, a gloved hand that pops out of a gift box, a hand buzzer with a sick twist, and a REALLY big gun.
845;It all peaks in the unforgettable clock tower scene, where he delivers one my favorite line in the movie.
846;I won't spoil it for you, but it's brilliant.
847;this is a good film, but I think Batman Begins does a better job with Batman.
848;There is no campiness of the 1960's TV series to be found here, it's action packed and stays truer to the original comic books, and that is a good thing.
849;the movie stars Michael Keaton, who makes an excellent Batman despite his rise to fame as a comedic actor and Jack Nicholson who holds nothing back in his fantastic performance as the Joker.
850;Even the minor characters are very well cast and have done a terriffic job of bringing these characters to life.
851;the sets are amazing as well.
852;This release also has an amazing array of extras, one being a three part presentation on the making of the movie starting from the very beginning of development all the way through to the Hollywood premiere.
853;A top notch movie for sure, if you haven't seen it, you need to.
854;I never believe for one minute that Michael Keaton is Batman, and Jack Nicholson, great actor though he is, can't come close to Heath Ledger as the Joker.
855;But Alfred is great
856;This movie is 20 years old, but still as great as ever.
857;For someone who never reads comic books, Tim Burton really give Batman the proper respect and setting he deserves.
858;You have to have the right setting to really sell the story, and this story is incredible.
859;He really is great Joker.
860;He can really play crazy, and at the same time have a little humor.
861;That is all I can say about that.
862;a million people have reviewed this movie and they can tell you that they love it, and they are right.
863;It still holds up and hasn't aged at all.
864;The move, Batman, was good and we enjoyed it.
865;as for the Movie, still what I believe is the best Batman movie.
866;As directed by Tim Burton, Gotham City becomes a fantastic nightmare in the grips of The Joker, played by Jack Nicholson who steals the show!
867;It's a pretty good movie with all the right actors.
868;Michael Keaton is a good Batman and I love Jack Nicholson as the Joker because he always makes me laugh.
869;batman Begins is way better with better acting and a better cast but I think this is one of the best Batman films evermade.
870;He delivereda good deal performance as Batman.
871;Jack Nicholson as only Jack can dowas on fire and always knows how to be the in your facepyscho villian.
872;the action was well done with special effects, and you gotto love the whole new darker and gruesome tone than the originalAdam West serial.
873;SPOILERS FOLLOWBatman, director Tim Burton's 1989 film, is a modern classic of its genre and is arguably the original standard.
874;bearing film in the Batman filmography.
875;the screenplay is extremely sharp, as a whole yielding an involved, relatively deep story which draws a compelling connection between Batman and The Joker, and gives each character a considerable amount of depth.
876;Both Mr. Keaton and Mr. Nicholson offer exceptional performances in giving, for the time, the definitive portrayals of their respective characters.
877;There are also a wealth of one.
878;liners throughout the script which reveal the characters in witty, pointed fashion.
879;the supporting cast is also exceptional
880;also featuring a classic dramatic score by Danny Elfman, Batman is highly recommended as both a companion piece to Christopher Nolan's great Batman films, and is a towering classic of the superhero film genre in its own right.
881;Still the best movie, the original.
882;Worth the upgrade no matter how many times you seen it.
883;He never takes his Batman job seriously.
884;When you're on a date, at least comb your hair and put on a decent dress than something handed from a second.
885;While it is a challenge to disengage my nostalgic affection for this film from the critical process and take a critical, objective look at this film, I really must start this review by saying that Tim Burton's 1989 celluloid revitalization of the Batman character is the greatest Batman film of all time.
886;Tonally it is most inspired by Frank Miller's wonderful story, The Dark Knight Returns.
887;Aesthetically, it is inspired by a great Joker story by Alan Moore called The Killing Joke.
888;as faithful as this movie was to the source material, the casting was also inspired.
889;Keaton, who at the time was better known for more comedic roles, was able to deliver a performance that was nuanced, subtle and iconic.
890;He crafted a performance that took elements of the Joker from every incarnation of the character and melded them into something very memorable.
891;While not as psychotic or menacing as Heath Ledger's Joker in The Dark Knight, Nicholson's interpretation is still scary.
892;He's also the most entertaining thing in the film.
893;There really is nothing to match the Joker's sheer presence and sense of fun in this movie and as a result, Keaton's Batman is a perfect contrast as the dark and brooding hero.
894;But Tim Burton's quirky style actually manages to make surprisingly thin character at least a little interesting.
895;Kim Basinger actually makes the role of Vicky Vale fun while minor roles like the reporter, Alexander Knox, and the Joker's right hand man, Bob the goon, are given subtle but interesting life.
896;Even Alfred Pennyworth is charming.
897;lastly, the production design is also one of the film's strengths.
898;The set really forces this film to feel timeless.
899;Gotham City is certainly memorable.
900;It really is a melting pot of ideas and yet somehow the film manages to shoulder the majority of its excesses.
901;The batmobile is my favorite of any ever used in films, comics or otherwise.
902;Danny Elfman's evocative score also has to be one of the greatest and most memorable film scores ever put to celluloid, next to the likes of music for Star Wars, Superman: The Movie, Jaws and John Carpenter's Halloween.
903;The Prince songs in the film serve as the Joker's own personal soundtrack.
904;all in all, Batman has a charm that I've never been able to put my finger on.
905;It's got an electric cast, a great soundtrack and a director with a unique vision.
906;For me it is a film I enjoy for its stylish imagination, its fantastic production design and the fact that it turned me into a lifelong comics fan and a nearly obsessed Batman fan.
907;This movie is beyond the best and no doubt one of my favorite movies.
908;The scene of Gotham city will keep you watching it over and over again.
909;Its one of those movies that will keep you waiting for the sequel.
910;Great art direction, action scenes and plot.
911;And Nicholson is perfect as the Joker.
912;We want to be able to suspend disbelief for a little while in the theater and enjoy or heroes.
913;best modern Batman movie made.
914;Outrageous, outlandish, definitely insane and you almost wonder if Jack actually got to play himself for once!
915;Michael Keaton was the best Batman ever.
916;His acting ability of having good and dark side was simply amazing.
917;directed version of the classic DC Comics superhero is as exciting and thrilling as well as dark, brooding and disturbing.
918;Jack Nicholson has done a great job as the Joker(whose real name is not Jack Napier), and Michael Keaton is at his best as The Batman.
919;The music score by Danny Elfman and the songs by Prince were the best components of the movie.
920;This will go down as one of the greatest DC Comics movies ever made.
921;And this comic definitively must be considered among them.
922;The mask is a symbol of mystery and his bat .
923;this first entry of this saga, is at least to my view, the best of all because it depicts with astonishing lucidity, the psychological springs and the origin of his out of this world behavior.
924;A double life, who may be carried to mask his sorrows and profound sadness, a man who finds shelter and redemption around his heroic actions, surrounded of first.
925;rate technology, but told with intelligent humor and brilliant dialogues in order to balance the enormous affective and emotional burden of Bruno Diaz.
926;Such emotional power reaffirms a terrible disappointment around the justice system and transforms Batman in a minimalist icon.
927;an effective movie who puts us in contact once more with the secret and mesmerizing unconscious power of myth in modern times.
928;Tim Burton is a master of the dark vibe.
929;The action sequences and the story combine to make a win.
930;win scenario that can't be beat.
931;watch 1989's No. 1 summer blockbuster.
932;What really stoked moviegoers, I think, was its sheer originality .
933;Even so, courtesy of a few well.
934;designed flashbacks, director Tim Burton and screenwriter Sam Hamm cleverly side.
935;a disturbed Bruce Wayne who walks, trance.
936;Still, Basinger's charismatic presence nicely balances the lead actors.
937;satisfying yet unique fate (one is left incredulously thinking: That's the best they could do?)
938;Knox isn't necessary to the story, but Wuhl has solid chemistry with Basinger.
939;as for the special effects, they mostly hold up well, particularly the awe.
940;inspiring Batmobile and a surprisingly realistic rubber Batsuit.
941;Despite its weaknesses, this Batman is well worth repeat viewings.
942;This is my Favorite Batman movie.
943;Nickelson is Great in this Too.
944;Like I've mentioned in other reviews, I've been a comics fan for most of my life.
945;Boy, was I in for a treat.
946;It's Batman!The beginning is enough to make any Batman fan squeal with delight, and for average movie fans to enjoy.
947;keaton does an excellent job as both Bruce Wayne and Batman.
948;Although not physically intimidating, he has a wonderful screen presence.
949;Nicholson was the true star of the movie, playing the Joker in a manner that was very true to the comics and should delight all fans.
950;tim Burton's artistic vision is what makes this movie so powerful.
951;Being a budding comic artist himself, he's able to appreciate how a panel of a comic should translate to the screen.
952;overall, this movie not only pleases Batman fans, but the general public.
953;I give this my highest recommendation
954;But I still was hooked.
955;tim Burton's Batman fit the comic book character better.
956;In this movie, Bruce Wayne is sleeping with the love interest outside of wedlock.
957;Pat Hinkle's Commissioner Gordon is easily forgettable, but Michael Gough's Alfred was an excellent and realistic portrayal of the man who served as both a servant and father figure to Bruce Wayne/Batman.
958;The rest of the acting, including that of Kim Bassinger, Robert Wuhl, and Jack Palance, was adequate.
959;cuff action the series did until the end.
960;It was more psychological (and actually realistic) than the series was.
961;Additionally, the movie introduced a symbiotic relationship between Batman and the Joker, each being responsible for the other.
962;After watching both movies, I agreed with Ebert on both accounts.
963;If you were around in summer 1989 then you'll remember that Bat.
964;the marketing team at Warner had to saturate the minds of the public with the big.
965;Tim Burton corrected all that by giving us a dark, sinister and Gothic world with rich production design and a great score by Danny Elfman (who has made a career out of recycling the same old generic cues in nearly every movie he has scored).
966;michael Keaton is the best Bruce Wayne in my opinion.
967;winning design of Gotham City is very original and unique, and is very much in the style of the Comic book.
968;I first saw this when I was a little kid, and I still remember how fun and exciting the movie was and seeing it again brought back those memories!
969;This movie is still an action movie classic because it has the right blend of comedy, action and drama, which was a rarity still at that time with the exception of Superman!
970;The movie stayed the same, action packed and interesting.
971;It was pretty good for my age, in the 80's.
972;Now Batman was an alright movie, but its definitely over hyped.
973;A lot of movies should be thankful to the first serious big screen Batman movie.
974;I was telling everyone I knew and complete strangers that BATMAN is going to be the greatest movie ever made.
975;A rousing theme song encompasses the theater seats and a bizarre looking city is shown on the giant screen.
976;(an impressive entrance) Now I'm reminded of SPACEBALLS with Dark Helmut playing with his dolls.
977;You weigh a little more than a hundred and eight Joker's best line.
978;I stopped covering up and came to grips with that this was not the greatest movie ever made.
979;I do recommend this 2 disc set to own.
980;It is still a fun movie to watch, despite it's shortcomings and the bonus features are plentiful.
981;That's the one I got.
982;Yes their is simply no better movie then Batman.
983;All my life this movie has always been their if I was down and I just wanted to have some fun.
984;The dark knight, Batman, has an amazing costume which makes this movie as wonderful as it can be.
985;The acting is superb, every chacter played their roll here.
986;Keaton Was outstanding as well, it just goes to show that he's a true comedian as well as a serious actor.
987;A very good story, finished off with an ending that no one can complain about.
988;Batman gets 5 stars simply because it was one of the best movies ever made.
989;Batman is the super hero movie all others look to for comparison.
990;With a tremendous cast lead by Keaton and Nicholson acting is something you'll never have a problem with when watching this movie.
991;Batman is kept dark and mysterious in this one which is a crucial part of the movie.
992;He was perfect for the part.
993;There are many who think that was the best Batman movie ever and seeing it myself it does come close.
994;While Jack's performance as the Joker is just as over the top as Heath he did a wonderful job.
995;If you liked Bale's Batman then you will love this too.
996;It has a lot going for it, including a dynamic visual style and (usually) a dark tone, but it also makes several critical mistakes.
997;On the plus side, there's a great musical score by Danny Elf man that really helps to establish the slightly dark tone and feel of the film, and the special effects are incredible considering that this film was made in 1989.
998;Burton's direction is interesting and he has a very unique style, but it feels more like Tim Burton's Batman than true Batman.
999;Batman is easily the best out of all the Batman films.
1000;It has a better cast than all of the other films in the series and it is the best directed one also.
1001;Michael Keaton will always be the best Batman.
1002;The sets and production values in this film are also amazing.
1003;I have always loved this film and the joker (Nicholson) is the best villian.
1004;I loved the dark, gothic sinister version that Tim Burton made, he brought Batman back to life.
1005;Well, this movie is overall an intense film experience despite a few problems.
1006;The film pretty much sets up the origin of the Joker and he kills people until Batman stops him in the end.
1007;but, nevertheless, this film continues to be a dark spectacle, largely due to Burton's vision.
1008;Nicholson's portarayl of the Joker is right on target.
1009;both frightening and funny at the same time.
1010;He takes joy in justice.
1011;It turned out to be a strong, dark movie.
1012;Kim Basinger is Batman's girl friend.
1013;He felt that it is rich in atmosphere with very little happening.
1014;Probably one of my favorite movies of all time, Tim Burton's Batman is a fantastic rendition of our favorite caped crusader.
1015;It has some flaws when compared to the Comic but still a great movie.
1016;It is region free and it played without a hitch on my PS3.
1017;Michael keaton IS batman in this one encompassing everything we all love about the dark night.
1018;the scenery is excellent, probably the best part of the film.
1019;The city of Gotham is its own, which really gives it life.
1020;the comic book fanatics will complains about the change of story in some areas.
1021;Michael Keaton was a good batman when this came out .
1022;this was again, bought for a friend's b day she is a huge batman fanhighly recommended
1023;i loved it its still a fun show to watch after all these years and its look sooo coool on blu.
1024;It is purely dark for the time and defiantly has Tim Burton's mark on it.
1025;Science fiction, fantasy, and action adventure usually have no place in the upper echelon of great motion pictures but I think the world should make an exception.
1026;This film, in my opinion, the greatest movie ever made.
1027;In my 20 years of living, I've seen films with more action (Blade, Speed, Eraser, etc.) better special effects (Stars Wars series Terminator 2 Lord of the Rings) and a better dramatic plotline (Time to Kill, Shawshank Redemption, Arlington Road) but this film is perfection and I believe this film should have gotten more credit than what it did.
1028;This is the Batman i will always remeber, although the joker is a bigger part of the film.
1029;jack Nicholson's Joker is the greatest villan in comic book movie history.
1030;Nicholson is having so much fun with this part you cant help but to love him and hate him.
1031;The new Batman film is good but is missing a few things: A Great score, Fun, Adventure, a good villian, and sillyness that made Burtons film so entertaining.
1032;The movie is so good that it will give goose bumbs by the end.
1033;The voice, movement, overall eveything!
1034;This is the 3rd best in the series.
1035;I liked the plot, but I don't care for Jack Nicholson.
1036;This of may of beeen the first of the modern Batman films, but it was the 2nd best.
1037;Batman Returns shows the true dark genius of a man named Tim Burton, it represented everything which the following Batman films destroyed and I love it for that.
1038;Jack Nicholson is his usual crazy self, and Michael Keaton will always be Batman for me.
1039;Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson star in this spectacular film about the famous comic book hero.
1040;Keaton stars as Bruce Wayne, a millionaire business man who's alternative personality is that of Batman.
1041;She comes to Gotham to check on Batman.
1042;He has written a story about Batman, and Vail proposes that they combine on another follow up story.
1043;jack is sent on a mission to break into Axis Chemical company, steal their records, and cover thier tracks, but unknown to him, he's about to be double crossed.
1044;Batman shows up on the scene as well.
1045;He now has a permanent smile on his face due to nerve damage suffered from falling into the chemicals.
1046;Also, he now paints his skin white and dyes his hair green.
1047;He has become the Joker.
1048;meanwhile, Vicki and Bruce are becoming very close and Vicki spends the night at Bruce's house.
1049;Bruce tells Joker that he knows who he really is.
1050;He also calls out Batman to reveal his true identity.
1051;Vicki finally realizes that Bruce is really Batman.
1052;A large balloon floating above the float begins to release a cloud of poisonous gas on the crowd.
1053;Batman emerges from the plane and sets off after Joker, who now has an unwilling Vicki with him.
1054;time best performances as the Joker.
1055;liners are great, and his performance is truly spectacular.
1056;Michael Keaton and Kim Basinger are excellent as well.
1057;The special effects are great, and Batman's toys, such as the Batmobile, Batplane, and his utility belt are all extremely cool.
1058;I highly recommend this great movie.
1059;stop and the acting, especially by Nicholson, will leave you wanting more.
1060;Watch and see a cool superhero movie and the beginning of an excellent series of movies.
1061;Jack Nicholson's Joker is the most dangerous and the best villian in the movie history, his over.
1062;top performence make this movie shining brightly.
1063;This is the best of the four Batman movies.
1064;The first reason is it has the best plot.
1065;It also has the best villian, the joker.
1066;It may not have as much action as the others but it is still the best.
1067;Next to this movie Batman Returns is the best.
1068;The film itself is fantastic
1069;Give it a chance and I bet you won't be sorry.
1070;The second disc is loaded with features that serve as a perfect companion to the film.
1071;I would recommend it to anybody who loves good movies.
1072;Pls note that we are blessed with a top.
1073;rated home theater system and we watch and enjoy movies ALOT.
1074;This was the best Batman movie ever made.
1075;It is one for the ages.
1076;Batman is a wonderful story, people tend to forget that stories in the world of cinema start right off from frame one, rather than creating a story.
1077;Tim Burton's visual mastery in Batman is perfect.
1078;Batman is one of those perfect movies.
1079;Jack Nicholson, Michael Keaton and even Jack Palance all help this movie become a living, breathing essence!
1080;Batman was released in 1989 and was a huge blockbuster from the first day.
1081;This is clearly Jack's movie, his style of acting makes the movie.
1082;the finest point of this movie is it's cast, which like most other comic.
1083;Michael Keaton is clearly the best Batman to date, Jack Nicholson is exceptional as the evil Joker, and Kim Basinger is convincng as Vicky Vale.
1084;At the same time, Batman's real idnetity is a rich millionaire named Bruce Wayne, who at the time is having a party, and at the party is the lovely reporter Vicky Vale, who Bruce takes an instant liking to, unfortunately so does the Joker.
1085;the soundtrack by Prince is suitable for the scenes and Nicholson brings humor to the film.
1086;The directing is great by Burton, who has became one of my favoriet modern day directors.
1087;Although the superior Batman Begins reinvented, reimagined and reinvigorated Batman, this, the original, still stands alone as a very good movie.
1088;the movie is the best batman movie
1089;the film holds a soft spot in my heart because I still remember seeing it in theaters when I was 6 years old.
1090;This movie is responsible for helping the mainstream public learn that Batman is far from a joke and is one of the greatest badasses in American Pop Culture.
1091;jack Nicholson is amazing as the Joker and I'm sure everyone knows that but Michael Keaton really is great as Bruce Wayne/Batman.
1092;I know a lot of people complained because he didn't physically look the part but his performance is perfect.
1093;This film greatly inspired the 1992 Animated Series with it's design and you can clearly see that.
1094;This is also BY FAR the best of the Burton/Schumacher Batman films.
1095;is this the greatest Batman film of all time?
1096;Is this a fun, entertaining and exciting action/superhero film?
1097;The soundtrack is a bit dated and total 80's with Prince songs but I honestly think it helps add to the charm of the movie.
1098;The Danny Elfman score is ICONIC and right up there with John Williams Superman, Star Wars and Indiana Jones themes.
1099;A fun, entertaining action adventure film that helped usher in all of the modern Superhero films that fill movie theaters to this day.
1100;The movie is perfectly dark and sometimes comical.
1101;It's also brilliant how their murder is linked to the Joker.
1102;The You Made Me and I made You stuff between the Joker and Batman is well done.
1103;So he wants to disfigure other people as well.
1104;Jack Nicholson is so good as the Joker that I never thought about how the movie doesn't have a solid plot.
1105;He did just play a Jack yet again though even if he looked good in the role and had a great Joker laugh.
1106;The film still delivers and what really mattered is that Keaton and Nicholson played off of each other great.
1107;It's exactly the same with all the special features.
1108;I want you to do me a favor.
1109;but a new villain has arrived and is taking the spotlight away.
1110;His main goal is to create a world that is as alive and dangerous as the criminals running amok.
1111;the performances are generally excellent, from Michael Gough adding comic relief as Wayne's butler Alfred to Jack Palance making a memorably brief appearance as crime boss Carl Grisham.
1112;But the movie belongs to Jack Nicholson, who transforms the Joker into a comic terror unleashed.
1113;But that helps make Batman's appearances even more dramatic.
1114;bATMAN is one of the few superhero movies that still works, even in an era dominated by IRON MAN, SPIDER.
1115;This movie portrays Batman in a dark, gothic, vigilante light that makes him somehow more real and understandable.
1116;Jack Nicholson was (of course) brilliant.
1117;First of all, Michael Keaton makes a creditable Batman.
1118;He looks like he's having fun, and obviously director Tim Burton is enjoying it, but many of his scenes run way too long and a lot of his ad.
1119;reliance on gadgets and sfx, Burton and company manage to produce a visually striking film that rivals Ridley Scott's Blade Runner and Fritz Lang's Metropolis for inventiveness.
1120;level action sequences work surprisingly well, and Kim Basinger really brightens up the film's darker elements.
1121;Seeing it now changed my opinion as he has the right amount of ham needed without chewing up the scenery.
1122;His sly humour is a welcome relief from Christian Bale's glumness.
1123;Villains usually have the showier parts but I now feel both characters carry equal weight and blend nicely into Tim Burton's grand vision which is the real star of this film ably supported by Anton Furst's gothic production design and Roger Pratt's sharp cinematography for the evening scenes.
1124;Actually the surround mix is good but there's a possible reason for his complaint.
1125;Play it with this one and you'll hear the difference as it's also louder and brighter.
1126;the 'making of' extras are worth watching as well as the documentaries about the Batman legend.
1127;Prince's three music videos are over the top but that's just Prince being Prince during those years.
1128;Being a huge Batman fan myself, I can say having this digitally remastered version of such a great film.
1129;I highly recommend this film for any real superhero comic fan.
1130;one of the best comic book movies of all time and a unique classic to this day.
1131;Unlike the campy yet cool and fun 1960's Batman, this movie was designed to bring Batman back to his dark roots like Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns and Year One did and Burton with company succeeded on film.
1132;Co. starring Pat Hingle, Jack Palance, Robert Wuhl and Billy Dee Williams this epic superhero action fantasy has brilliant visuals by Anton Furst and a dazzling soundtrack by both Danny Elfman and Prince.
1133;I remembered when i was 8 seeing this in theaters, i loved it and became a Batman fan as i had the merchandise including soundtrack to even comics as it turned almost any 80's kid into a Batman fan as i even watched that campy 60's show on Family Channel as well.
1134;The movie spawned one great sequel, one decent sequel and one terrible sequel, an awesome animated series, a fantastic reboot series and many fans of Batman to come.
1135;Val Kilmer was the 2nd best.
1136;Michael Keaton has a nice black Batman costumeBatman (Two.
1137;Tim Burton's BATMAN was a masterpiece.
1138;The way he took the legendary comic.
1139;book character and brought him to life was just excellent.
1140;jack Napier (Jack Nicholson) works for a gang of criminals.
1141;He also is set on wooing Bruce's love interest, Vicky Vale (Kim Basinger).
1142;batman is definatly the best hero.
1143;hearted and fun for the whole family.
1144;More of a movie for fans of Batman and action movie fans.
1145;I think I actually enjoyed his first Frankenweenie better.
1146;I saw Batman (1989) in the theater when it was released in 1989 and was very impressed with it.
1147;It's very entertaining and well balanced between action scenes and slower.
1148;The overall atmosphere of the movie is very much on the dark side, which is something that works very well, in my opinion.
1149;If you've seen other Tim Burton movies and like his style, then this movie should please you as well.
1150;The dark feel of Gotham City gives the movie a feeling of dreariness and mysteriousness.
1151;The street scenes in Gotham City portray a city with lots of crime and chaos, yet the movie maintains a true comic book feel.
1152;Tim Burton definitely created a vintage comic book movie, and that's really how a Batman movie should be.
1153;michael Keaton does a great job playing Bruce Wayne/Batman.
1154;Nicholson's performance is classic, and in my opinion, the best acting he's done in his entire career.
1155;This was the first movie ever made where the true nature of The Joker is exposed, which is more accurate to the comic book Joker.
1156;Instead, Romero's Joker was made into a funny thief.
1157;This was completely fine for the campy TV series, and Romero was an outstanding Joker with incredible talent.
1158;Nicholson's Joker, on the other hand, is a balanced mixture of dark humor and evil, which is what a true Joker should be like.
1159;His wardrobe and makeup are outstanding, not to mention that permanent grin is incredibly creepy.
1160;For fans of this iconic villain, I highly recommend seeing this movie and the legendary performance of Nicholson.
1161;Personally, I prefer this movie to The Dark Knight.
1162;One of the best things in this movie is the score by Danny Elfman.
1163;The music fits the scenes so well and has become a timeless, classic score over the years.
1164;I highly recommend this movie.
1165;Renewed my love of Batman, so glad that this and Batman Returns were made.
1166;There was so much hype back in 1989 that it's easy to forgot this is actually a good movie.
1167;Extra features are expansive, considering the best they could hope for in '89 was a spot on Entertainment Tonight.
1168;I grew up on Batman and I am a huge Prince fan.
1169;Another bonus is the incredible Prince videos from the double.
1170;Batman is one of my favorite movies so October 18th is marked on my calendar.
1171;Christian Bale is great as the Dark KNight, but Michael Keaton was the first to say I'm Batman.
1172;Good acting and good directing were this movie had going for it.
1173;The reason for this choice at the time was because that comic was (and still) is considered one of the best Batman comics ever written and it made Batman dark and grimey, of course this was in the eighties, while you all were still in your daddy's bag.
1174;Before you write a review and try to sound knowledgeable, do a wikipedia search or something, because this film is a masterpiece.
1175;I mean the style, mood, theme, and cinematography.
1176;This film impeccably creates that dark feeling that the comics had in the eighties.
1177;I loved the Dark Knight but this movie is just as good and deserves mutual respect.
1178;Jack Nicholson as the Joker was amazing and it'll always be debated which Joker was better Heath or Jack.
1179;I can remember boys, girls, men, and women wearing Batman T. shirts.
1180;I can remember a kid with a Batman insignia haircut!
1181;Michael Keaton gives a sincere performance as Bruce Wayne and Batman.
1182;Jack Nicholson steals the show as The Joker.
1183;Kim Basinger is quite good as Vicky Vale, the film's heroine.
1184;The late Michael Gough gives a sincere performance as Alfred, Batman's butler.
1185;Pat Hingle is quite good as Commissioner Gordon.
1186;Tracey Walter is good as Bob, The Joker's lackey.
1187;Batman and The Joker are also smitten with Vicky Vale.
1188;Danny Elfman's Batman music score is excellent and it's aged better than the songs in the movie.
1189;Billy Dee Williams is quite good as Harvey Dent.
1190;In Batman Forever(1995), Gotham City has a bright, neon.
1191;budget color movies, it was certainly one of the mos famous and successful of the transformations.
1192;eccentric director, intended to do something worthy of notice with this new film.
1193;the supporting cast was excellent: Billy Dee Williams, and Jack Palance were sensational, each in his own way, and Palance more even than Pat Hingle, captured the public imagination with his characterization.
1194;myself, I'm impressed mostly by the unique and effective music by Prince, one of yhe most innovative of POP artists.
1195;The stuff made for this movie particularly, was outstanding.
1196;And, in addition to that, the art design .
1197;of the sets and of the ariel floats .
1198;The idea of gassing an entire city by means of festive baloons is a high point in demenedness.
1199;the sight jokes and the staging of them is wonderful.
1200;Basinger is exquisite and the perfect foil for the JOKERS perverse, monomonical lust.
1201;villain
1202;this version of the BATMAN myth, combines with the 1943 Serial, to offer the careful observer of the changes in American POP culture and behavior, a rich and irreplacable reward.
1203;The sexual symbolism is hotter and more overt
1204;part of what gives Batman its self.
1205;awareness is an aspect of the film that I haven't seen remarked on: the range of spoofs of popular and sometimes important art that are sprinkled through it.
1206;It starts by spoofing itself: the Joker reprises Carl Grissom's You're my best man!
1207;p. s. Kim Basinger is brilliant in an under.
1208;rated performance that realistically swings her urban working girl between conceited yuppie, terrified hostage, and insecure single: You weigh a little more than 108!
1209;His Batman is both Dark and Fun, two things that Schumacher and Nolan could not pull off at the same time in their Batman movies.
1210;Scumacher's films were in my opinion very fun but on the light side, especially Batman and Robin.
1211;Batman ('89) is so perfect because it is a rollercoaster ride of fun but its still dark.
1212;michael Keaton is the best Batman of all.
1213;Even though the movie is called Batman its The Joker who really steals this movie.
1214;Jack Nicholson is the absolute best Joker of all.
1215;He was hilarious while still being the absolute best bad guy.
1216;i would recommend this to anyone that is a batman fan
1217;Takes me back to when I was kid.
1218;I think Keaton had the best overall take on both Wayne and Batman.
1219;I love it when Batman says Im not going to kill you.
1220;I love the part when they go to start havoc in the chemical plant.
1221;Batman again enters the picture and uses a device to attach to Jack's face and Jack falls in.
1222;this movie is sure to please people who have a dark sense of humour.
1223;batman as a character always kicks .
1224;i wont say anything more except that the movie is just amazing.
1225;but a film that set the tone and mood for what many consider to be the essence of Batman as both an established character and a pop culture Icon.
1226;It has great performances from the ensemble cast, great set design and use of backlot, but fails to deliver an intricate and complex plot and story that are worthy of the Dark Knight's reputation as a film hero and well known comic book character.
1227;excellent Visual Effects (The Batmobile, Bat.
1228;excellent Performances (Keaton's Batman is subtle and mysterious, Nicholson's Joker is hilarious and sinister, Basinger's Vicki Vale is excellent and optimistic)Jack Palance gives an excellent performance as Carl Grissom, a feared mob bossBilly Dee Williams is great as Harvey Dent (He should have been Two.
1229;face)Robert Whul's Alexander Knox provides good exposition, and some comic reliefPat Hingle's Commissioner Gordon is good (despite his lack of screen time)Michael Gough's Alfred is subtle and noteworthy in the film.
1230;provides stability and balance to Keaton's reclusive Bruce WayneGough's Alfred is very consistent with the comics.
1231;especially with his subtle use of emotion in his performanceGreat songs by Prince!!!!
1232;Burton's Film as a whole establishes and maintains that dark, gritty, gothic feel that we all know and love from the comics and the beloved animated series that came after it.
1233;(yes, she's gorgeous, but still.
1234;Batman operates as a non.
1235;While this film is still entertaining and fun as it has always been.
1236;a solid, ground breaking film, not to be missed (if you haven't seen this film, you need to!)
1237;As time went on the movie actually improved as I was able to better understand The Joker's motivation .
1238;Luckily for fans the Nolan Bros resurrected the Batman franchise and justice for the Dark Knight is once again served, although to me this will always be the best of all Batman films ever.
1239;The story of the hero known as Batman is one that many people are familiar with to some degree.
1240;As a comic book character created by Bob Kane for DC Comics, Batman has remained one of the most popular heroes throughout the years, and the same can be said, for the most part, for all of his various incarnations in both the comics and other forms of media.
1241;Sure the series was a hit, but I challenge any fan of the series to go back now, and actually watch it and see if you truly feel that it did any sort of justice to the character of Batman.
1242;Burton was wise enough to create a version of Batman that was dramatically strong, yet remained true enough to the hero's legendary origins, while still adding a few tweaks for artistic license, that he was able to present a movie that would please the fanboys (and girls), and also gain great critical acclaim and commercial success.
1243;Generally in superhero films both origins tend to be presented simultaneously, or at least in quick succession of each other
1244;The overall story in Batman was very well.
1245;paced, and generally balanced in regards to the main characters.
1246;Basically, all of the story elements within Batman worked perfectly with each other to create a very entertaining movie, and beloved comic book adaptation, and at the time, it could have been viewed as a How To guide for making a successful superhero movie.
1247;the cast was led by Michael Keaton, who was a source of much contention amongst fans at the time of his casting
1248;However, once trailers for the movie started appearing on TV and in movie theaters, and then the eventual release of the movie, the fans soon began supporting Michael's portrayal, and to this day he still remains the fan favorite for many Bat.
1249;in the end, Batman was, and still is, an excellent superhero film adaptation, and at the time was responsible for resurrecting the seemingly dead comic book genre after the one.
1250;First of all, this is one of my favorite movies, and a prime example of Tim Burton in his top form!
1251;There is so much in this film to behold, the absolutely fabulous art direction by the late Anton Furst, the fantastic musical score by Danny Elfman, the performances by Jack Nicholson and Micheal Keaton, and the skillful direction of Tim Burton.
1252;Tim Burton's film about the unique comic book crimefighter became an instant classic.
1253;michael Keaton was a atypical choice to portray Bruce Wayne and his nighttime alter ego, but he brilliantly captured the essence of the troubled man with a very big secret.
1254;Jack Nicholson as the Joker is perfect.
1255;His comic book exploits are in full force here.
1256;Exuding insanity and charm, Nicholson delivers a memorable performance.
1257;Michael Gough as Bruce Wayne loyal butler Alfred is also worth noting as well.
1258;tim Burton and the late Anton Furst delved into the lore of Batman and created a visual masterpiece.
1259;Danny Elfman's rousing film score is among the all time greats, and adds to the mysterious atmosphere of the film.
1260;For those who didn't have the opportunity to see this on the big screen, you missed a real treat.
1261;Love it, always a great classic.
1262;This was a movie that my youngest son wanted as he is a huge batman fan and had to have this one to make his collection.
1263;He of course loved it and watched in 3 times that day.
1264;in my opinion Michael Keaton is probably the best Batman.
1265;I highly recommend to people who enjoy comics and comic book movies.
1266;com and it came quickly in excellent contion, Everything went smoothly with accurate description and exemplary service.
1267;i love this film always have.
1268;My 4 year old daughter dressed as Batman for Halloween a few weeks ago and so this movie is definitely a hit with her.
1269;It is an older version, but that makes it even better!
1270;The product arrived in great time and my husband loved it.
1271;He loved all of the extra features and the movie itself.
1272;Tim Burton percieved the Batman comic book better than any other director of the Batman series!
1273;If you love great movies, then you will love this movie.
1274;The story evolves from a fairy tail type story, to a darker and more evil story as Jack Napier turns into the evil and sinister Joker!
1275;This Batman is clearly the best.
1276;up, costume designs, set designs, and acting.
1277;Get ready for the edge of your seat acting, pyrotechnics, stunt work, and photography as Batman makes it's way into your Souls as the greatest superhero movie of all time!
1278;This film captures all the right tones of the character.
1279;Its got everthing going for it.
1280;It is visually far better than that tripe Nolan put on the screen.
1281;Stalls for a perfect silhoutte against the full moon!
1282;That was an inspired shot,that was conceived by a genius!
1283;Theres not one shot in Batmans begins that can hold a candle to this one magical movie moment.
1284;They got it perfect back in 1989 and everything that has came since pales in comparison.
1285;This is fun escapism at its best.
1286;Batman The Movie shows the origin of Batman and Joker is the villain in this movie.
1287;The movie had a great story, great sound, great graphics, and great action.
1288;It's much better than the VHS.
1289;Amazing that Keaton could pass for Batman, good production, epic Soundtrack from Prince and Elfman.
1290;screen heroes that came after it.
1291;It's a good movie that shows you just how twisted and complex Batman really is.
1292;imbalanced human being who just happens to be loaded and has a collection of wonderful toys.
1293;Although everyone talks about Nicholson, Keaton is the real treat here because he pulls off a character that no one really thought he could portray.
1294;don't get me wrong, Nicholson is wickedly funny as our favorite villain, Joker.
1295;He is the glue that keeps this story together.
1296;the special effects are excellent for the time period, and the supporting cast is good as well.
1297;As other reviewers stated, the story is a little uneven, but it's made up for with the brilliant belltower climax.
1298;Enjoy this flick, and if you like it, you'll probably enjoy Daredevil and the Blade flicks as well.
1299;Even though Batman Begins is the best Batman film yet, Batman {1989}, is still a great film and a masterpiece.
1300;I love how they worked on the new Batman 2.
1301;The new transfer rocks and the really did a great job remastering the footage.
1302;In fact, everytime I watch this film and see his performance as The Joker, I just get excited.
1303;Even though Christian Bale took the title from Michael Keaton as the best Batman/Bruce Wayne, Keaton still is a excellent Batman.
1304;compared to the other movies, it is definetely one of the best.
1305;For a movie produced in the 80s, that one was very well directed.
1306;Very exciting with a very good story line.
1307;michael Keaton is a great Batman!
1308;jack Nicholson was also a great Joker.
1309;But I gotta say, Heath Ledger is the real Joker!Sound track is great.
1310;Batman's suit and weapons are very cool.
1311;Tim Burton's Batman is dark and gothic, and while after several years I find fault with this film, all in all, I enjoyed it when it opened in 1989.
1312;Batman creates the Joker, but in the end one sees that the Joker created the Batman.
1313;While over the top, it is still a great performance.
1314;still, the movie feels surreal and ultimately it is a viewing pleasure.
1315;Burton sparks the movie box.
1316;Danny Elfman's score is simply spectacular.
1317;Jack Palance, Michael Gough and Robert Wuhl provide strong performances.
1318;It is one of the best special editions around.
1319;The history of Batman documentary is great, with interviews with great Batman artists and writers like Denny O'Niel and Frank Miller.
1320;Peter Guber's energy still shows through 16 years after making this picture.
1321;He brings a lot of insight into the movie making process.
1322;I think one will find Nicholson's comments interesting and yes, like his Joker, a little funny.
1323;while the movie suffers from a week narrative, the visuals, musical score, and acting performances are superb.
1324;Michael Keaton was perfect as Batman, if you think about it Bruce Wayne is not the most tightly wrapped guy out there, he dresses up as a giant flying rodent and runs around at night in Gotham City beating up on criminals, and Keaton captured this essence perfectly.
1325;indeed I'd have to say that this is the last good performance that Nicholson did, after this movie he phoned everything in and cashed in on his Jack Nicholson act.
1326;Tim Burton was still a young and fresh director and Danny Elfman scores hadn't become tiring.
1327;However when you look at it as the leader of a cinematic vanguard of action movies you realize how good it is.
1328;This Batman movie is probably one of the best ones.
1329;Michael Keaton sure acted his best and I do believe, as my dad says, that Michael Keaton is the best Batman compared to the other 3.
1330;He really captures the spirit of batman.
1331;The movie was really fun for all.
1332;the basic Plot:There's a new villain fighter in town, Batman.
1333;dies, with a smile on his face.
1334;jack Nicholson also pulled this one off with his wacky character.
1335;The fun spirit of Jack and his companions really rock the house down.
1336;Even when the situation is supposed to be tensed, Jack still continues to make the flow of the movie fun.
1337;this movie is highlt recommended for families who like to get together for a relaxed time.
1338;Most of the camp comes from The Joker's side as Jack Nicholson plays His Joker as a psycho with a huge sense of humor.
1339;I also loved the look and feel of the 1940's that Tom Burton gave to the film, from the style of clothes that the main character's wore, to the architecture and even phones.
1340;vicky Vale is the weakest link in this movie.
1341;That Michael Caine created a better Alfred was an unanimous decision in those of us who had seen both franchises.
1342;The one daughter who has seen the Nolan series enjoyed this movie also and appreciated the bit of camp that was thrown into this version.
1343;This is still the best in the series, with all the key players working to their very best.
1344;Burton, master of the bizzare, was the perfect man to bring the legendary comic book to the screen, and he does it wonderfully.
1345;Danny Elfman's excellent score is another added plus, and the action, while not Burton's strong point, is expertley done.
1346;The look of Gotham City is inventive and fascinating, creating a nuance of comic book.
1347;All this blends perfectly to create one of the best comic book movies of all time.
1348;I enjoyed learning about the background info about how Batman became Batman.
1349;Batman is a good example of a movie that can entertain.
1350;It has humor, it has action, some nice effects, and a good cast.
1351;I loved this as a kid and i still love it now,all batman fans should own this.
1352;batman is a great comic book movie and is the best of the sereis
1353;It's always been pretty awesome!
1354;The darkness has always been awesome for sure!
1355;And Jack Nicolson was great as The Joker!
1356;He had the perfect smile for it.
1357;This is a cool film.
1358;I liked this Batman film the best because there's no annyoing stuip Robin.
1359;This version of Batman is all about Tim Burton's vision of Batman as the dark knight, and agreeably the noir lends itself to better explain the legend.
1360;A great loss!The added features greatly add to the viewers enjoyment of the film.
1361;Burton directed this movie, and did a great job .
1362;Needless to say, Batman is Wayne's alter ego.
1363;Keaton is magnificent at playing the character's alter ego.
1364;Keaton also does a good job playing the character when he's not in costume.
1365;But overall, Bale's Bruce Wayne is superior to Keaton's because Bale has a much more developed character to play.
1366;But when Keaton is onscreen in the Batman costume, Batman seems so menacing and captivating that you enjoy all of his scenes.
1367;michael Gough is a delight as the old butler Alfred.
1368;Pat Hingle was really good (as Commissioner Gordon) in this movie.
1369;Hingle and Gough were in all four movies of the original series, and I enjoyed them both in Batman Returns.
1370;there's lots of little things I love in this movie.
1371;The look on Napier's face when he sees the emptied safe.
1372;The grin on the young Jack Napier.
1373;By the way, you can tell that Nicholson's make.
1374;up job would look a lot more realistic in this day and age of filmmaking.
1375;First of all, I found Keaton's Batman to be so cool and the Joker to be so entertaining that I ABSOLUTELY LOVED this movie.
1376;This is my favorite movie of all time and it was directed by one of my favorite directors of all time, Tim Burton.
1377;great musical score by Danny Elfman.
1378;For me, Batman represents that shining beacon of hope to the hopeless, and he always seems concerned for the safety of others.
1379;It may have a decent story, but I'll always look at this big.
1380;One of Jack Nicholson's best roles.
1381;Burton really did do an amazing job on this.
1382;This is a Tim Burton movie mainly
1383;But, for all of that, it is a classic.
1384;Danny Elfman still has a film score composing career because of his ingenious superhero score for this one.
1385;now this is an interesting point, because this Batman is in fact aimed more at adults than the kiddies.
1386;What the reviewer really means to say is that Batman is a very human movie
1387;This Joker is very much Jack Nicholson, but man, what an actor!
1388;top (it was trendy then, such as De Niro recognized when he did Cape Fear ), and it might cross the line in good taste, but I could honestly say that Nicholson was the best actor in movies after seeing this performance.
1389;For my money, this is the funniest, craziest, nastiest impression ever.
1390;Of course Nicholson is using the Joker to channel his own psyche through, but it works every time.
1391;It is a collector's dream.
1392;The documentary on Batman included here moved me to tears, especially hearing Bob Kane's wife discuss his chills after realizing how much the Batman character and franchise became loved and admired around the world.
1393;Every boy grows up with Batman (in one form or another), so I don't think anyone will fail to be moved by this tribute.
1394;After seeing the Dark Knight movies made afterwards, it makes this movie seem cheesy
1395;This film proved to the world that comic book films could be much more than action.
1396;This film (and the first sequel Batman Returns ) have so much more to it than that.
1397;Batman is a gripping and very moving exploration of the psyche
1398;The film is brilliantly acted by its perfectly.
1399;Tim Burton makes perfect use of his wonderful directorial talents, Anton Furst designs a gothic, beautiful Gotham City, and Danny Elfman's classic musical score further help make this a unique, thought.
1400;provoking, and very powerful modern classic, a masterpiece of film noir and grand opera.
1401;It wasnt as good as Batman and Robin with George Clooney but he still loved it.
1402;of course the batmobile was a huge hit, along with all the gadgets.
1403;was a good movie to watch for a family of super hero nuts.
1404;But when I received the package as soon as I opened the envelope you can tell the piece that holds the movie in place broke so it was not package well.
1405;keaton we love ya .
1406;Michael Keaton dons the cape and cowl in what is the best of the live.
1407;Gotham is a dirty, ugly city and Burton portrays that perfectly.
1408;Keaton is given little to do here, but he makes a good Batman nonetheless.
1409;His presence in this movie is enough alone to steal the show.
1410;Nicholson is a highly talented actor and this movie confirms that statement.
1411;The film that relaunched the Batman craze put Michael Keaton in the Batmobile opposite Jack Nicholson as the dark hero's greatest adversary, The Joker.
1412;Adding a good mix of dark humor and light drama, this exciting opener for the franchise does a darn good job of introducing Batman to a new generation.
1413;My only real complaint about this film is that it acts like more of a vehicle for Jack Nicholson's career than for Batman's, with the Oscar.
1414;winning actor receiving more screen time than the title character.
1415;the original batman and the classic view of gotham city and the bat cave!!
1416;Keaton's seething delivery perfectly captured the public reaction to the excess of the 80's.
1417;As psychotic as Keaton, these two are opposite sides of the same coin, in this pitch perfect delivery.
1418;jack Nicholson makes a wonderfully perverse Joker.
1419;I also love Michael Keaton as the unlikely superhero.
1420;More than 10 years after it's release, Batman is still the best in the series and arguably the best super hero film out there.
1421;keaton, does a suprisingly good job as Batman and plays him much like a split personality.
1422;It's one of his best performances and really gets into the role.
1423;batman is a dark and interesting film and shouldn't be missed.
1424;Good item to add to my Comic movie collection so my kids can show there kids and keep the imignation alive.
1425;Tim Burton turns Frank Miller's verison of the Dark Knight, into one of the greatest superhero movies.
1426;But the more and more they see him action, the more people in the city realizes that he is, in fact, a hero.
1427;Elfman comes again with Tim Burton, proving they are a match made in Gothic heaven.
1428;I thought he was fine.
1429;vicki Vale: A news reporter who is interested in Batman and is Bruce Wayne's love interest in this film.
1430;aLexander Knox: A news reporter who works with Vicki Vale and is also interested in Batman.
1431;Tim Burton the director of this film did a wonderful job on It.
1432;He made the film dark.
1433;The movie had a great music composer Danny Elfman his been doing queit a few of burton films.
1434;In this darkly entertaining retelling of the Marvel comic classic, ace photojournalist Vicki Vale (warmly and sympathetically played by Kim Basinger) is also on the trail.
1435;So go and see it.
1436;I love this movie because I felt like they captured Batman's true nature.
1437;I like the serious tone to the film and I enjoyed every minute.
1438;This movie was a hit when it first came out, and its still fun to watch now.
1439;Its not till the amazing Heather Leder stole the spotlight that we get a new Joker in our modern era.
1440;I have always loved this film.
1441;As a child I was mesmerized by how epic this movie was.
1442;As an adult I continue to admire its charm.
1443;If you we're to watch this film for one reason alone, it should be to witness the oozing charisma of Jack Nicholson as the Joker.
1444;If you ask me why I continue to watch it, I could tell you several reasons, but one of the main ones would be the beautiful score by Danny Elfman.
1445;The pacing of this movie is operatic in musical, emotional and narrative terms.
1446;Batman is a clasic that should be cherished by whoever sees it.
1447;The acting is the best of it's time and ours.
1448;The storyline is unique and fun.
1449;The original 'Batman' film holds, for all Bat.
1450;fans, a sacred title as the one true (and certainly best) film in the original saga.
1451;The mere fact that it grossed hundreds of millions of dollars and shattered box office records is a testament to its validity as a cinematic tour de force.
1452;Facts and figures aside, the original Batman film revolutionized the way that films were made in regards to scale, merchandising, and certainly publicity.
1453;Disc 2 displays the classic image of Batman violently gripping the Joker's suit jacket in the film's climax in Gotham Cathedral.
1454;tHE LOOK AND SOUND:The widescreen 16:9 aspect ratio captures practically everything Burton shot in '89.
1455;Dolby 5.1 and DTS Surround ensure that every unique sound effect in the film is heard perfectly.
1456;The digital transfer crystallizes every single visual effect and brings Gotham City into its full glory during every sweeping master shot.
1457;The gem of them all is a marvelous half.
1458;The History of Batman features many prominent comic book icons such as Stan Lee, Kevin Smith, and Bob Kane himself, all creating fantastic insight into the psyche and appeal of the Caped Crusader.
1459;Also featured are several extremely relevant Batman writers and artists who are responsible for thrusting the Dark Knight into a more contemporary context for several generations.
1460;part documentary showing the process to get Batman onto the big screen, is the second best feature of the second disc.
1461;production for Batman with the last installment focusing on the principal photography and after effects of the film.
1462;The most remarkable thing about this documentary is that it features dozens of interviews with integral members of the cast and crew.
1463;Notorious for his privacy, Nicholson graciously supplies dozens of glorious minutes explaining his role in the process and even the psychosis of the Joker.
1464;All other cast and crew interviews are brand new!Also on the special features menu is a Beyond Batman documentary gallery, housing 6 separate featurettes with subjects ranging from the production design of the film
1465;gadgets
1466;The structural and architectural analysis of the design of Gotham City is especially fascinating to witness!Rounding out the second disc are three music videos by Prince, a lost Robin storyboard sequence, and a short clip of Bob Kane reflecting on his creation on the set of the original film.
1467;Each featurette reveals great insight into the lore of the Batman as well as the production of the first film.
1468;The creative genius of Tim Burton and the over.
1469;top performance by Jack Nicholson, make this an instant classic, and a must.
1470;There are hours of bonus features included, mostly done in documentary format.
1471;Beginning with the original Batman creator, Bob Kane, through the lengthy history of Batman, to the ultimate cinematic adaptation by Tim Burton, who also speaks at great length about the production of the film.
1472;This is very interesting material that a fan will truly appreciate.
1473;The combination of Tim Burton's vision and direction, impeccable casting and wonderful special effects took the movie world by storm and reached far beyond the silver screen.
1474;i still feel this is the best Batman movie.
1475;Jack Nickolson's Joker is the real star of the movie and I'd say that probably Robert Wohl has as much screen time as Keaton as Batman and Bruce Wayne combine.
1476;spoken and far from heroic looking.
1477;But seriously, I think that Batman Begins is the best Batman movie yet.
1478;It is dark and forboding, yet still herioc in its depiction of Batman.
1479;Batman is a well made movie based off a comic book.
1480;batman is the story of Bruce Wayne.
1481;His boss knows and sets Jack up.
1482;michael Keaton was a surprise as Batman.
1483;He does it very well and I think you can argue him as the best Batman.
1484;jack Nicholson steals the movie.
1485;He is such an awesome actor and is one of the better ones to ever grace the screen.
1486;I think it's a role he was born to play and I can't see anybody except for maybe Jim Carrey doing as good as a job as the Joker.
1487;The Joker in my opinion is the greatest on screen villian from a comic book ever.
1488;Jack Nicholson does that good of a job.
1489;She is totally hot and plays Vicki Vail well.
1490;She plays off the other actors well.
1491;She is also believable as a photograher and the writers and directors deserve credit for that.
1492;She is so hot and I can watch the movie for her alone.
1493;He displays the world of Gotham well.
1494;I think it's one of the best movies he has ever done.
1495;danny Elfman has written a fantastic score.
1496;It's the best work he has ever done.
1497;It rivals a John Williams score and accents the movie so well.
1498;This is one of the best and catchiest scores you will ever hear.
1499;It's one of the best comic book movies ever made.
1500;If your a comic book fan this one is a must.
1501;In my opinion this is a great idea and makes for a far more interesting story.
1502;It is also good that the next Batman cartoon was more like this movie then the Batman cartoon's that Hanna Barbera made in the seventies.
1503;A lot of the fight scenes are done in almost pitch black alleys and streets.
1504;Nicholson's Joker is very good yet sometimes he hams it up a little too much.
1505;Of course some great quotes by Jack as the Joker.
1506;You'll laugh a few times at what he has to say.
1507;Keaton's Batman/Bruce Wayne was great.
1508;I really enjoyed the ending of this movie.
1509;Burton definately used his own style in the Batman film, but it's story is above average with a great villain and hero.
1510;Kim Basinger is great as Vicki Vale.
1511;SPOILER Best part: Joker shocks a man to death with a 10,000 volt joy buzzer.
1512;When this movie came out in '1989', it was my most favorite superhero movie at that time.
1513;fated Batman Forever and Batman and Robin and before it was gloriously revived with the spectacular Batman Begins (which in my humble opinion is even better than this film), there was Tim Burton's Batman.
1514;Utilizing a huge market campaign and boasting top.
1515;the film boasts an impressive production design (which earned a well.
1516;deserved Oscar) with casts Gotham as a moody, Gothic place in the mold of the twenty.
1517;The score by Danny Elfman is a wonderful orchestral score that has some of the heroism of John Williams's Superman theme but with a moody and oppressive tone to it.
1518;And the acting is fairly good .
1519;Michael Keaton makes for a quiet, unassuming Bruce Wayne (but unimpressive Batman), Jack Nicholson makes for a wonderfully loony and twisted Joker and Michael Gough makes for a homely, well.
1520;Nevertheless, the movie is entertaining to a fault and while it isn't one of the finest superhero movies ever made, it is responsible for reviving comic.
1521;book superhero movies up into the mid.90s where Batman and Robin ran the Batman franchise into the ground.
1522;And is the upgrade worth it?
1523;the transfer is brighter, more natural.
1524;You can finally make out the details in the darker scenes and overall the video transfer is very pleasing.
1525;highly anticipated theatrical trailer for the film on the first disc.
1526;A cast or crew member sitting with him could've made the commentary more engaging, but it's good for some of the information Burton tells us.
1527;Still, it's good for archival purposes.
1528;All of the new interviews provide some nice behind.
1529;As a nice touch, there's a storyboarded deleted scene featuring the voices of Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill (who provide the voices for the Tim/Dini Batman animated series) and a collection of music videos Prince contributed to the film (Partyman, Scandalous and Batdance).
1530;The 1997 disc is also available (for a much lower price than this edition), but I highly recommend this edition if you still haven't got a copy of this movie yet.
1531;The video transfer (and the fact that it's in a keep case) alone is worth the upgrade.
1532;The book included is kind of cool.
1533;I actually love the whole Warner book editions of these blu rays.
1534;So reviewing this film is an exercise in taming my nostalgia.
1535;it is a very good movie.
1536;It's got some very good performances, especially Keaton and Nicholson.
1537;The story overall is strong, intertwining the origins of the two principals.
1538;established characterization in 50 years of prior stories.
1539;Actually, what strikes me now is how low budget it seems at times, if you're looking for it anyway (and the vision is generally so powerful that you might not .
1540;but then I've seen this film a good 20 times).
1541;It inaugurated the boom of comic book movies that we are still enjoying/suffering through today.
1542;Kids 8 to 80 should enjoy this film.
1543;It's well worth owning as a home video.
1544;ray:This video transfer is very faithful to the original film.
1545;When a scene is lit reasonably well, you can see pretty good detail in hair, facial wrinkles, and wet pavement.
1546;But the overall dynamic range of the image, from dark to light, is pretty flat.
1547;burton's commentary is very entertaining.
1548;He starts to repeat himself a bit by the last half hour, but overall it is very engaging, loaded with information, and has plenty of honest opinion from the director.
1549;It's easily the best of the original 4 Batman movies.
1550;top TV show as our source for live action imagery of the Caped Crusader, and not to be taken very seriously.
1551;Jack Nicholson takes his roll as The Joker and runs with it, makes it his own.
1552;Michael Keaton also plays his Bruce Wayne/Batman with class and respect.
1553;The extra are fun too, including commentaries from Burton, Nicholson, Keaton, and others.
1554;well, Batman DID come from a comic book!
1555;Overall everyone did a really nice job in this film, and it was the beginning of a solid series (well, at least the first two movies in this series were really great)
1556;I have seen the Batman films, and this one is the only one that shines as truly original, and fun, and true to it's character.
1557;the first batman was the big blockbuster of the 1980s and has beome a big comic caper to this day.
1558;then the city faces a new threat the one and only best batman villian the joker.
1559;This was a great movie.
1560;With a lot of excitement.
1561;I just love a good movie with michael keaton in it.
1562;Classic Batman in the spirit of the original.
1563;Michael Keaton, Jack Nicholson, Kim Bassinger, and the rest of the cast were the best.
1564;This is still the best super hero movie.
1565;Superman was good, x. men was good, and Spiderman was good, but this Batman is great.
1566;Jack steals the movie as the Joker, and Keaton makes for one great Batman.
1567;The movie helps the viewer understand that Batman is not this kind hearted person who just wants to do good in the world
1568;The movie is both funny and tastefully done.
1569;The direction and acting are great.
1570;I enjoyed this movie when it first came out when I was a kid, and enjoyed it so much more as an adult.
1571;Released in 1989, Tim Burton's Batman holds up very well 22 years after its release and I actually prefer it over Christopher Nolan's re.
1572;entry, as interesting as his vision is.
1573;Burton's first Batman is pure escapism in a sort of old fashion way.
1574;No CGI to be seen here and it works better that way.
1575;Other films at the time such as Blade Runner (1982) and Brazil (1985) had already experimented with the classic film noir style, done in a sort of retro/futuristic way but Anton Furst's design for Gothem City truly feels like you are viewing a modern retelling of the classic noir films from the 40s.
1576;sam Hamm's script is solid and while it has been the target for criticism, I feel that he did a nice job, his dialog is very witty at times and a little over the top but it's appropriate, particularly with Jack Napiar/ The Joker.
1577;The performances are actually quite impressive and even better then what Chris Nolan got out of his actors but that's just an opinion.
1578;Micheal Keaton, while controversial and unusual at the time, gives a really good performance, he is very shy and sensitive which is the Bruce Wayne that I respond to the most.
1579;His joker is fun and even believable, Jack is just as great of an actor as James Cagney in my mind.
1580;Kim Basinger is actually much better then she is given credit for, her and Keaton work well together.
1581;The rest of the cast really are supporting characters, some are familiar to the Batman story, some are new.
1582;as for Tim Burton's direction, he handles the actors very well and as for the technical work, I have mixed feelings about that.
1583;There are a couple of matte painting shots that may not hold up as well today but none of this really matters, it still works.
1584;He combines the fun, the adventurous and the dark side of Batman into one piece.
1585;I think that Batman may be the best Hollywood movie of the late 80s and I still consider it a favorite from my childhood.
1586;I know that comic book purists prefer Nolan's Batman but as just a movie guy who loves old fashion Hollywood movies, this one appeals more to my taste.
1587;Burton's 1992 sequel, Batman Returns is equally as great and even takes the series in a direction that's more complex and provoking which Joel Shumaker ignored.
1588;The transformation of comic book superheroes into film or television properties is always a risky process.
1589;But with visionary director Tim Burton at the helm and versatile Michael Keaton in the title role, this Batman is a rousing success.
1590;all the elements really come together in this memorable film.
1591;Keaton's brooding but likeable take on the Dark Knight is well complemented by Jack Nicholson's menacingly manic performance as the Joker.
1592;A fine supporting cast also strikes a good balance between fun and seriousness.
1593;The costuming and production design are astounding
1594;And Danny Elfman's superb orchestral score perfectly complements the other elements of the film
1595;there are a number of truly inventive sequences in the film, and as a whole it's a fine blend of action, drama, and mythic flourishes.
1596;But Burton's first Batman is a treasure.
1597;Great movie, one of my favorites!
1598;It's still my favorite, even after Batman Begins blew me away.
1599;Jack's Joker is great and Michael Keaton will always be my Batman.
1600;The look and feel of this movie is dark and exciting without being oppressive.
1601;Occassionally the strain on your suspension of disbelief is a little much, but this movie is still well worth your time and your money.
1602;I loved this entry in the Batman saga.
1603;I thought Michael Keaton did a great job, as Bruce Wayne AND as Batman.
1604;He was a suitable mate for Kim Basinger.
1605;Give me a touch of humor with my action movies EVERY time!
1606;The movie didnt look all that much touched up, but it does look a bit better.
1607;disc 1 also features a commentary track with Tim Burton.
1608;disc 2 has a bunch of stuff thats in some ways a bit disapointing, and yet other bits are interesting.
1609;HOWEVER, there is a very interesting thing that shows the story board of a scene that did not get filmed, but intended to have a suprise glimpse of the boy wonder!!!!
1610;In revisiting this piece, I can easily take apart what was influenced by art deco and I am impressed by it.
1611;batman's costume, first off, hints towards strong use of deco, with its two spires at the top of the head, sharp features (like the knife.
1612;It had so much depth and such neat visuals, that I always thought that a splash of color and neon would really liven it up.
1613;while I love the design behind Batman Forever and Batman and Robin, I do come away feeling that Batman is a much more optimistic person, when the entire point of this saga is supposed to be that Batman, despite being a superhero, has mental problems that drive him crazy.
1614;So while I appreciated the design in the later Batman films, I come away with an even greater appreciation for the original Batman and Batman Returns, and I can better see why the dark design was much better for the Batman series, itself.
1615;Batman, the movie, was strongly told through its design, and much of what we understand about Batman comes from the design.
1616;Joker is the best on there .
1617;was the greatest movie ever.
1618;loved micheal keaton as batman.
1619;i say again the best
1620;this film is pretty good.
1621;it's better than the other 3.
1622;tim Burton does a good job but he has done way better films with less cash hype.
1623;jack Nicholson does a good job.
1624;michael Keaton is real chill.
1625;BATMAN: fantasy action comic book story
1626;Tim Burtons Batman of 1989 is definitely a classic and a milestone in superhero movies.
1627;I respect it for all the Batman and other comic book movies, cartoons, TV series, etc. that we have today.
1628;Afterwards I was introduced to the Nolan Batman trilogy, which I also highly enjoy.
1629;I like those other versions more, but I still really like this film.
1630;He stops criminals in the shadows and is regarded as an urban legend.
1631;Great mystery surrounds Batman aka Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton) both to the citizens of Gotham and the audience, which is part of the films charm.
1632;She ultimately becomes the token love interest/damsel in distress.
1633;the film does many things right and some amazingly.
1634;All the actors do a good job or at least a decent job.
1635;Michael Keaton does an amazing job as Batman.
1636;Jack Nicholson also does a great job as the Joker.
1637;I like Mark Hamill and heath Ledgers portrayal more but he is definitely my third favorite.
1638;He is a great choice because they man always plays crazy people.
1639;The guy is born to play crazy.
1640;The film looks like a comic book in movie form which is part of the films appeal.
1641;One thing I like about this film is that it is the middle of the road.
1642;It can be dark, series, and brooding but it is still a comic book film and there is much fun to be had.
1643;Batman the Animated Series did a great that as well.
1644;I like the grounded Batman that Nolan films bring but sometimes I like a fun comic book film.
1645;Burton is just the right person to do that for Batman.
1646;I also love the effects for the Batmobile and especially the Batwing.
1647;The action scenes are also well.
1648;First of all while Keaton does an excellent job as Batman I did not care for him as Bruce Wayne.
1649;I just prefer the suave Bruce Wayne who is more of a playboy.
1650;She is good looking but that is it.
1651;I have seen characters like her in pretty much every movie ever made especially superhero films.
1652;It is a very fun movie but can definitely be very serious.
1653;Batman is a good time for both kids and adults.
1654;When the film came out I went to see it because I had enjoyed the TV series when I was a child.
1655;I had my doubts going in about Michael Keaton playing the role of Batman, but he did a wonderful job.
1656;The ladder is the second sentence uttered by the imposing Dark Knight, and it helps launch the spectacular Batman, rich in noir.
1657;life production design, director Tim Burton's ambitious vision, Danny Boyle's muscular, rhythm.
1658;All of these elements contribute to to craft a modern classic, one that makes the last two Batman films directed by Joel Schulmaker look like child's play (no pun intended).
1659;to perfectly complement the dark story, is gritty and shady production design by Anton Fursk, who won and Oscar for his work, and deservedly so.
1660;And Director Tim Burton uses them to all their extent, which, when combined with Burton's ambitious, visually stunning direction, makes Batman into what it should be.
1661;And Danny Elfmans' sinewy score sets a perfect musical complement to the films' spectacular visual elements.
1662;to make Batman complete, there is confident acting by all the cast.
1663;Nicholson is the highlight of the film, having as much fun as possible with his maniacally gleeful character.
1664;But right there with him is Michael Keaton, who the ideal actor for Batman and Bruce Wayne.
1665;He perfectly captures the brooding essence of both men, proving he is by far the best Batman so far.
1666;But both Kim Basinger and Robert Wuhl turn in exceptional performances as reporters trailing Batman.
1667;arguably, this first entry into the Batman franchise is the best.
1668;It had the production designer, the script, the composer, the director and the cast to make it a classic.
1669;It seems timeless, having aged gracefully into this new millenium, which is quite a statement.
1670;The score by Danny Elfman is easily the strongest comic book theme ever created for film and could you ask for a better Joker than Jack Nicholson?
1671;Jack Nicholson plays the Clown Prince of Crime in this 1989 example of filmmaking perfection, and he truly makes the role his own.
1672;He became the world's greatest detective, a master escape artists, learned martial arts and pretty much anything and everything that could help a man fight crime without the use of deadly weapons.
1673;With his wealth he armored himself with vehicles, an assortment of high tech gadgets, and a special suit that hid his identity while also giving him the imposing appearance of some sort of half man.
1674;the film begins with a classic day in the life scene, where a couple and their son walk through a dark alley in Gotham city and are straight away mugged, with Batman winging in to nab the villains.
1675;With a newfound confidence and a taste for revenge, Jack, now calling himself The Joker, kills boss Grissom and takes over the mob that runs Gotham.
1676;Joker is poisoning the people of Gotham city through a mix of cleverly hidden chemicals in common beauty and hygiene products.
1677;When Batman finally deciphers THAT riddle, a new danger comes up.
1678;screen and widescreen, a feature I always enjoy having, even if I always seem to choose widescreen nowadays.
1679;As for the movie itself, Batman ranks up at the top of those ultimate comic book movies, alongside Spider.
1680;The cast is top notch, and this is definitely one of Tim Burton's best, up there with Sleepy Hollow.
1681;I bought it the other day too.
1682;The most entertaining and the most visually appealing.
1683;I can see it the whole way through without having to pause or jump scenes (as I do with the first 30 minutes of Nolan).
1684;The praise he gets is well.
1685;deserved from flatout kickass acting.
1686;Keaton holds is own too.
1687;This one and the one from Forever are great.
1688;Batman was the next big success in DC's comic to film genre.
1689;There are a lot of films around that originate in comics that no one knows about (e. g. From Hell).
1690;Spiderman was a great film for 2002, Daredevil is expected to do well, and Hellboy is in the making.
1691;Acknowledge that geniuses have made an incredible machine that allows people to views great stories on a screen.
1692;And then find a means to experiencing this film.
1693;The acting, story, and Danny Elfman score in this film were all very well done.
1694;Jack Nicholson gives a smashing performance as the Joker while Michael Keaton takes the lead as Batman.
1695;the best movie out of all the installments that would soon follow.
1696;This movie not only focuses on Batman, but it also focuses on the life of Bruce Wayne.
1697;This is an excellent movie with a great transfer to Blu Ray.
1698;It's always been known that originals are always better than their sequels because the first has the best villians, the best fights, the most suspense, and many other things.
1699;And I was pleaseantly surprised with what I saw: Incredible fight scenes, an unbelievable villain, and a whole lot of thrills and surprises.
1700;It's one of those films that might be boring after a few views but still is something you want to watch.
1701;batman proves the theory that all originals are far more superior than their sequels.
1702;Unlike the violent Batman Returns and the boring Batman Forever and Batman and Robin, Batman has a bit of everything, which holds the film firmly together.
1703;She's determined to find out who the superhero really is and that leads to the film's romantic story.
1704;He brings a distinct feeling of comedy and intelligence to the film and establishes himself as a likeable character who you want to see in every scene.
1705;Joker will probably be the best and most terrifying bad guy because he acts at though it's all a game and all he wants to do is have fun playing it.
1706;And Michael Gough (I think he's the only person who remained for all four movies) is brilliant.
1707;Batman is a must get for all superhero, Keaton, action, and Burton fans.
1708;It is sure to be a classic and to be remembered in decades to come.
1709;Tim Burton crafted the first real Batman Movie and it was absolutely amazing.
1710;I absolutely loved it from beginning to end.
1711;He has the personality down perfectly because it is similar to may of his other roles.
1712;He has some of the most memorable lines in the film and the way he conveys it makes it even more memorable.
1713;Michael Keaton is simply awesome as Batman and Kim Basinger is a great love interest for him.
1714;Everything about this movie is classic, powerful and unforgettable.
1715;Its one of the most classic films ever made.
1716;I have some of the most wonderful memories of my childhood because of this movie.
1717;It is one of the most iconic endings of all time.
1718;The plot is intriguing, engaging, exciting to viewers.
1719;The character of Batman/Bruce Wayne is so very believable combing darkness with sophistication.
1720;I mean, he's a Batman, bats are dark creatures.
1721;Michael Keaton who is among the most underrated actors ever, can play the perfect Dr. Jackyll and Mr. Hyde character with the dark, forboding Batman to the brainy, social Bruce Wayne.
1722;While Keaton makes a great balance between the two.
1723;And it makes sense for him to be casted as this for those of us that have seen The Shining.
1724;He makes a good psycho, who knows how to laugh at all the wrong moments, and makes the character believable.
1725;This made the depth of the film complete and the showdown between the Joker and Batman worth watching till the end.
1726;Again, this film isn't perfect, but it's still great.
1727;overall Batman is a superhero form of Dr. Jackyll and Mr. Hyde.
1728;This film does such a great job pointing this out, explaining again and again why Batman is the way he is.
1729;i recommend Batman to anybody who wants to see a great movie with a good storyline and good characters.
1730;It's entertaining, it's dark, and it's worth the experience.
1731;It's a tough thing growing old!
1732;I do enjoy this film despite it's flaws, but you have to remember at the time this was fairly new territory.
1733;I went to see this opening night and it was a grand experience for the most part although I was not completely happy with the film!Keaton who fans and critics scoffed at for being picked to play the caped crusader is actually pretty good and way better than Kilmer or the abysmal Clooney!
1734;He really brings the Joker to life for this movie.
1735;He is one of my favorite superheroes.
1736;Good movie, not a great movie.
1737;Jack nicholsons performance is great as The villianous Joker.
1738;Directed by Tim Burton, it was a hit at the time, especially among the fans that wanted a darker telling of the legend.
1739;batman may not be too impressive as far as effects, but for me this was a fun movie.
1740;This felt more like a super hero movie than the Dark Knight.
1741;Finally, here it is with bonus features covering everything from filming, costumes, make up, music, it even includes a segment on the comic book origins.
1742;I highly recommend listening to the commentary as well.
1743;Some interesting insight on the filming of the movie.
1744;With the second disk jam packed with so many extras, at last we have an answer to the Jokers famous question:  Where does he get those wonderful toys?
1745;Although there are some minor gripes, this is by far the best Batman film.
1746;Sorry Val and George fans.
1747;As a kid, i loved this movie to death and as a huge batman fan, I thought for a long time that this was the definitive screen version of the caped crusader.
1748;disc special edition of this movie.
1749;The film improves whenever The Joker shows up.
1750;Jack Nicholson clearly steals the show here, As he's undeniably funny as Batman's arch nemesis.
1751;Another high point that remains in this movie is the terrific and timeless score by the amazing Danny Elfman.
1752;Prince's music here is good too, But it doesn't fit in with this movie.
1753;After over 20 years, The look of the set pieces in this movie are still pretty impressive.
1754;The movie starts well, But it falls apart at times in the middle, But it does finish on a pretty good note.
1755;While there are occasional dark undertones lurking here and there, For the most part, This is a pretty campy movie due to the Joker's over the top comedic antics all throughout this film [Although this isn't as campy as the 60's tv show or Batman Forever and Batman and Robin].
1756;The effects are great, and still very effective.
1757;The acting and chemistry between Michael and Jack is great, and they both chew up the scenes when it is just them with the other actors.
1758;For kids, this is pretty good for entertaining, I know I was just blown away in the movie theatre.
1759;That cutback is omitted and has been since the original theatre cut.
1760;As I kid I read Batman.
1761;Not only is it more influenced by Miller's Year One and related materials
1762;There is no better Batman, yet, than the 1989 Tim Burton version with Michael Keaton.
1763;Yes, many objected to Keaton as being used for the Dark Knight role, but he plays it perfectly.
1764;He really looks like a believable Bruce Wayne.
1765;Although, I have watched Batman several times I enjoyed watching again because I watched it with my 11 yr old granddaughter.
1766;michael Keaton plays an incredible Bruce Wayne/Batman.
1767;The classic detective atmosphere of the movie was awesome!
1768;Kim Basinger plays a great Vicki Vale, and Jack Nicholson plays a very realistic, and quite scary, Joker (granted, it was the last good thing he had ever done).
1769;this was the movie that started it all, and was, in fact, the best, until Batman Begins came out (although that only beat this Batman for first place by about 1/8 of a star).
1770;Tim Burton did an excellent job.
1771;this is Jack Nicholson's best role.
1772;This is an adaptation of this Jokeras a jolly ringmaster of death, and Nicholson is perfectly cast here.
1773;he electrocutes, shoots and poisons Gothamites with a gleeful personathat is simultaneously hilarious and chilling.
1774;Keaton does a decent job, but that doesn't make up for a lack of screen time or a lighterapproach to mysterious Batman.
1775;But close your eyes for minute and imagine that it's the summer of 89 once again.
1776;It was the biggest, most expensive, and the most anticipated movie ever.
1777;It was the sixth highest grossing movie of all time.
1778;So how does it hold up today?Not very well, I'm afraid.
1779;Batman is an interesting character, so why is in the spotlight so little?
1780;First and forermost is Danny Elfman's amazing score.
1781;I beleive that it gives this film legs to stand on.
1782;It is my favorite score of all time.
1783;The camera rises up to the rafters ot Batman himself, standing tall as the music swells to the greatest musical notes in the history of film.
1784;The fights also hold a certain amount of charm to them as well.
1785;i guess the reason the film works so well is due to the simple, almost mythic Batman character.
1786;The film certainly dropped the boat on what could have been a well.
1787;developed character arc, but the basic idea that it's one man against evil, the idea that the individual can make a difference, is really the appeal of the character, and Burton hits that note perfectly.
1788;So at least he had a solid eight year run.
1789;The features are very well deserved by this important movie.
1790;and yes Mike Keaton is by far the best Batman Ever.
1791;The great Tim Burton overhauled the campy 60's era Batman into a gothic, brooding vigilante that turned the way comic book movies being made on its ear.
1792;Michael Keaton is the best Batman ever, and I don't blame him for not wanting any part of Joel Schumacher's chapters in the Batman saga.
1793;Keaton is perfect as the dark brooding hero by night, and the millionaire playboy by day.
1794;Jack Nicholson brings the Joker to a new level, making him a darkly humorous villian, and one of, if not the, greatest villian to ever appear in a comic based film.
1795;All in all, the first installment of the new Batman saga is still the best no matter what, and with the way the series is now, it will be the best of all time.
1796;Nicholson was good as the Joker (real name: Jack Napier).
1797;I love when he moves slickly around to do his killing.
1798;Tracey Walter (who often plays heavies in rather small film parts) is on hand as the Joker's main thug, a very underrated touch.
1799;I just saw the movie a couple nights ago, and man, i havent had so much fun watching it as i did then!
1800;its a rollercoaster of a movie, keeps you watching for all the great performances going on.
1801;basically, the story is about how batmans first days in gotham city, which is this masterpiece of a city, yes, its an art deco city, and amazing nonetheless.
1802;its creepy, keeps you on edge, and scares you!
1803;What a way to open a movie!
1804;Keatons performance is incredible, you can tell how much he puts of himself into this role, HIS role, as in he OWNS thid role.
1805;hgis eyes pierce through you in that dark cowl, those eyes that haunt you, want to tear you limb from limb.
1806;plenty of action with the batmobile with some of the greatest music (decent into mystery for fans of the fabulaous soundtrack), and the batwing as well, in one of the most memorable scenes in cinama.
1807;keatons offbeat, phychologically disturbed bruce wayne fits the tone of this film, and his Batman pefectly.
1808;dont listen to the negative reviews on this movie, its well done and the acting, especially keaton, is superb, and he nails the true spirit of batman and keeps the mystery intact as well.
1809;very serious, has a great score, and just wont let up!
1810;This and batman returns are the only good out of the four.
1811;Jack Nicholson is fantastic in this film.
1812;Michael Keaton is great as batman too.
1813;He's way better than George Clooney.
1814;The art design in this film is amazing.
1815;When Tim Burton put out Batman in 1989, comic book fans and movie fans alike were pleased with this movie about the caped crusader.
1816;Coming in at 2 hours in length, this was the first modern comic book movie.
1817;This comparison is best illustrated in their respective scenes with their love interest
1818;Contrast this with Gyllenhall's portrayal of Rachel Dawes
1819;The dialogue between Bale and Gyllenhall are serious, introspective, with tinges of melancholy, hope, longing and regret all rolled into one.
1820;probably the most vivid contrast between the movies is the emphasis on ethics, morals, straw.
1821;Burton's Batman is essentially a comic.
1822;book world, and does for comic.
1823;And this difference is driven by the Joker.
1824;so all in all, Keaton's first Batman movie is good, but not great.
1825;Its worth the watch, especially to see the progression of how Hollywood has done comic.
1826;One of the first comic book hero's who came the big screen.
1827;And the acting well done by Micheal Keaton.
1828;A movie for the ages for comic book lovers
1829;This is the best Batman movie of all 4 of them!
1830;Micheal Keaton is the best Batman of all, he could kick Val Kilmer and George Clooney's butt any day of the week.
1831;The Joker is Batman's best enemy, and Jack Nicholson does a great job of this monstrous villian some call The Joker .
1832;The movie is dark and spooky (well, it has to be seeing how Tim Burton directed it).
1833;im my opinion michael keatons batman was the best and christian bale's batman was great also.
1834;do yourself a favor, get batman, batman returns ,and batman begins and i ask you.
1835;I grew up watching various incarnations of Batman in cartoons, as well as reruns of the Adam West cartoonish.
1836;jack Nicholson's portrayal of The Joker is what makes Batman .
1837;I have always thought Batman were the best superhero.
1838;Yup, no fun and games anymore.
1839;well I can understand Tim Burton`s decision, and it was a bit surprising, but also a bit TOO obvious.
1840;The movie it self scores skyhigh.
1841;Of course the film is the most important, but hello, we are talking one of the best superhero movies ever.
1842;, this is an absolute winner.
1843;The Cover is simple, but yet it wields so much symbolic power that one cannot help but being impressed by it.
1844;Dont let it hinder you, this is absolutely one gem you WANT to have in your collection.
1845;Highly recommend the soundtrack too(the Score, not the one of Prince)
1846;Ok writing, that's a star.2.
1847;Ok acting and at times a little better, that's a star.3.
1848;Ok directing and that's a star.4.
1849;Neat modeling, music (for the Batman scenes) right on target, that's a star.
1850;Was it interesting enough to see a couple more times?
1851;It's a popcorn movie and because it came out, and had such a big reception, the industry tried to make other Batman type and style movies.
1852;well, its is a jet powered car.
1853;The Batmobile is Jet powered.
1854;and it's just a model and just a movie.
1855;The Joker gave a fine performance no matter what anybody says, and the other Jack played his part well.
1856;palance always has (I hope I spelled that right).
1857;So, I give this popcorn popper a five star rating and recommend it to all of us who still haven't sold out our taste.
1858;It seems Burton and Keaton had a good time together in 1988 with Beetlejuice and decided to team up a year later with Batman.
1859;it is absolutely undeniable that Nicholson stole this movie and ran with it.
1860;He fit the part so naturally well, managing to throw in his own style for The Joker.
1861;Burton's visual style, mixed with Elfman's brilliant score, is a formula for a wonderful cinematic treat that everyone should see at least once.
1862;I think this one is the second best of all the Batman films.
1863;Michael Keaton is the best Batman of all.
1864;Jack Nicholson is a very good Joker.
1865;She needs to learn how to mind her own business.
1866;The funniest character is Knox.
1867;Nicholson is fantastic, story is creative.
1868;Probably my favorite Batman movie.
1869;Michael Keaton was a serviceable Batman, and did a good job as Bruce Wayne.
1870;It is well worth your time and money.
1871;this 1989 masterpiece by Tim Burton deserves 10 stars simply because of Jack Nicholson.
1872;He was born to play that part.
1873;now, Michael Keaton was absolutely brilliant as Bruce Wayne/Batman
1874;Michael Keaton played Bruce Wayne with a very laid back persona.
1875;A perfect example is when Kim Basinger's Vicki Vale and Robert Wuhl's Alex Knox are roaming around Wayne Manor.
1876;When Knox says How do you know that Keaton answers Well, I bought it there.
1877;Kim Basinger was also perfectly cast as Vicki Vale.
1878;He even made Joker likable.
1879;Jack also had all the best lines in the movie.
1880;Jack Nicholson is absolutely great in it and without him is hard to say what this original film would be.
1881;Many people consider this to be arguably the greatest work of his career.
1882;Hard to say but most of everything he does in pretty great.
1883;The movie starts out a little slow but then gets fun.
1884;I am not a big fan of comic book type movies like this but have to say Batman is very entertaining.
1885;The man took a role he was perfect for, a mob goon, and incooperated the unpredictable insanity of probably the greatest comic book villain of all time, and he did it all so seamlessly that you'd think he was really born just for this one role.
1886;Nickelson matches wits with Michael Keaton, a man whose background in comedic roles led everyone to believe he would not make a suitable Bruce Wayne/Batman.
1887;And let's applaude the man who brought them together.
1888;life scum that happened to be lurking around.
1889;A superhero film for the ages.
1890;This is an amazing movie, and I think most Batman fans should see it.
1891;One such issue is that it does kind of take away from the interestingness of the Joker by giving him a definite origin, but at least it sticks to the most widely believed claim and I can look past it, but it would be a lot more interesting if they went with a multiple choice past.
1892;I also didn't care for the subplot of Joker being in love with Vicki Vale, but maybe it's just me and in any case they don't play it up as a major plot point, and one of their scenes together is, admittedly kind of cool.
1893;Otherwise it's a great movie, there are some cool fights, there's some mystery to Batman and Bruce Wayne, and the Joker does something that only a well.
1894;done Joker can
1895;From what little I've seen of The Dark Knight, the Joker does the funny and scary thing too, but I prefer the emphasis on the funny from this one.
1896;dramatized special effects queen and not the guy running down the parking lot in blue spandex, this film brings the cult superhero to life.
1897;The film is probably the best out of all of them.
1898;In my opinion, Batman Forever and Batman and Robin were both over.
1899;p. s. Jack Nicholsan is effing great in this movie!
1900;I won't claim this movie is better than Batman Begins, but in my opinion it is definitely just as good.
1901;One thing I liked better about Tim Burton's film is the Bruce Wayne character.
1902;On the other hand, Batman Begins tells the story of the Dark Knight himself whereas in Tim Burton's version the Joker rather than our hero is the focus of attention.
1903;Very pleased with this blu.
1904;The cover art is great and the features are many.
1905;first, let me say I much prefer Burton's film.
1906;I find it's baroque theatricality far more interesting and entertaining than Begins attempt to shoehorn Bruce Wayne/Batman into something like the real world.
1907;the last point I'll include here is the CHARACTER of Batman himself (not the actors or their performances: they're both excellent).
1908;He MUST be Batman to deal with his inner demons.
1909;Perhaps he has done both.
1910;Danny Elfman's score rocks and the Batmobile in Begins sucks!
1911;I won't even go into the rewriting of the Joker's origins, which was so perfectly established in the graphic novel The Killing Joke.
1912;Batman introduced a new world of reality.
1913;This is a very adult story.
1914;It is a very adult movie.
1915;This movie is powerful and tragic.
1916;Scenes will move you to tears as he fights with the inner demons as well as the outer demons.
1917;The best Batman movie and the best Tim Burton movie.
1918;Kim Basinger and Michael Keaton did an Awesome job.
1919;ray but what it really has is amazing sound.
1920;I haven't yet reviewed this movie and I feel obligated that I must.
1921;I've always been a Batman fan from childhood up.
1922;While Nolan's are better, this movie right here still belongs in my Batman movie collection more than the other live interpretations from the past.
1923;And yes, he is a superhero.
1924;Great action, good performances and I must say it's still iconic today.
1925;I was 13 when this came out and I remember begging my dad to see it.
1926;When he finally took me and my brother to see it, I enjoyed every second.
1927;The Batman I read in comics had been done right.
1928;But it was all I had then and it ruled for years, Batman wise, until Batman Begins.
1929;Nolan's trilogy is my definitive live action Batman but 1989 Batman still gets high praise with them.
1930;If you haven't seen it, see it.
1931;This is the first of all the Batman movies that followed, and still is the best.
1932;top as Batman is, the rest of them went way to far over the top.
1933;ray this movie was a must for me to get.
1934;This picture was a big improvement.
1935;My son loves this movie he is into super heros and watches this all the time.
1936;It is a real good movie and teaches kids good is best.
1937;under director Burton's able hands, Keaton showed a talent that had been hidden by his previous comedic roles.
1938;This performance is worthy of that recognition.
1939;A marvelously haunting score from Danny Elfman as well as the contributions from Prince make for pleasurable listening during the film.
1940;finally, the look of Gotham City is both beautiful and grotesque.
1941;This makes for a truly unique movie.
1942;Oh man, Batman is one of my favorite movie superheroes of all time.
1943;It spawned lots of comic books, sequels, merchandise, toys, books, and a lot more!PLOT: Bruce Wayne is a man who thinks he's normal, until one day, he becomes a caped Crusader named Batman.
1944;Great movie, great price, great watch.
1945;One of the best Batman movies yet.
1946;Well, take a deep breath and relax, because salvation is at hand, via the magic of the movies, with Batman, directed by Tim Burton.
1947;millionaire businessman Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton) has a secret, as well as a secret identity
1948;But more than that, to putting things aright
1949;Donning a black cape and mask when a situation arises, he becomes Batman, the quintessential avenger and rectifier of misdeeds.
1950;And right now in Gotham City, his services are needed.
1951;Unabated, it may signal the end of the Gotham everyone knows and loves.
1952;Their last and best line of defense is the man everyone knows and no one knows
1953;lifting his hero from the pages of the comic books which spawned him, director Tim Burton has infused him with the breath of life, transforming him into a very real, three.
1954;Terrific entertainment, with perhaps a subtle message included?
1955;Burton approaches the story from a very real perspective, rather than as merely a live version of a comic book character, and it works.
1956;It is, in fact, the difference between this being nothing more than a cartoon with live actors, and being a well crafted and delivered motion picture.
1957;creating an atmosphere conducive to the realistic approach he takes, Burton grounds even the most fanciful elements of the film by steeping them in that same sense of reality.
1958;And those who use the tools he offers will be rewarded with a rich and riveting experience.
1959;To those individuals I would say: Look for the metaphor
1960;a gifted actor with an innate penchant for comedy, Keaton left no doubt as to his versatility and his ability to do solid drama with the film Clean and Sober.
1961;Here, he draws upon his considerable talents to create a character that is credible and believable, and he does it by playing to the man, rather than to the bat.
1962;And it's the reason his stands as the definitive portrayal, miles ahead of the interpretations of those who followed him in the role in the sequels, Val Kilmer and George Clooney.
1963;Accomplished actors, Kilmer and Clooney nevertheless failed to achieve the success Keaton enjoyed as Batman, and it's because they opted to play to the bat, rather than to the man, especially Clooney.
1964;to the fantastic aspect of this two.
1965;they compromised the integrity of the reality and lost that edge that made Keaton's portrayal so believable.
1966;To put it another way, Keaton played him as a man whose extraordinary motivation and determination enabled him to accomplish extraordinary things
1967;jack Nicholson gives a memorable performance as the Joker, creating a character whose extroverted, demonstrative nature plays well against Keaton's understated presentation of Batman.
1968;It gives a sense of fire and ice to the film, tempered by Burton's atmospherically dark mood (which is established in the opening frames and continues throughout to the very end).
1969;Nicholson, who generally plays his characters from a point of introspection, gets a chance to really open up and let loose as the Joker.
1970;It's a role he seems to be having a good time with, while at the same time keeping it real and reflecting the vision that Burton realized with this film.
1971;However you take it, it's a film that you'll appreciate more with each additional viewing.
1972;Like a good wine, it gets better with age.
1973;The 1989 Batman film is probably the best we'll ever see of The Dark Knight in a major motion picture.
1974;At the time of this writing there has been two Batman films directed by Christopher Nolan, I won't waste time comparing Burton to Nolan but I will certain defend this first outing with Michael Keaton wearing the cape and cowl.
1975;The Joker is suppose to be the one in the limelight to soak up the attention because he because he sees himself as a great artist and entertainter and remaining Anonymous would be the last thing on mind.
1976;up committed in the film, Batman lowers himself down and surprises the criminals with his cape as simulated wings.
1977;Really it's the perfect introduction to a theatrical character.
1978;This is the perfect Batman for film, pure imagination from a thoughtful director.
1979;This film has a great many centerpieces.
1980;Generally, the action is convential and well done but not the most memorable parts of the films.
1981;action Batman film to date.
1982;I have always liked this movie.
1983;I think that the acting was very good in all roles.
1984;The 2 disc special edition has a whole disc of special features that were, to me, interesting.
1985;I just viewed this Blu.
1986;I remember the huge anticipation for this movie back in the Summer of 1989.
1987;tim Burton, the director, has a unique visual style, and his movies are always interesting to look at.
1988;key performance is easily overshadowed by Nicholson's.
1989;Batman Forever(1995) is the best of the four Batman movies, which isn't saying too much:( Hopefully, the upcoming Batman Begins movie will learn from the mistakes of its predecessors.
1990;i remenber seeying it at the cinema.
1991;Jack Nicholson as the JOKER is brilliant and remarkable.
1992;bATMAN is such a tremendous cool character, and the JOKER is one of the most interesting lunatics of all time!!!
1993;Acclaimed filmmaker Tim Burton brings the legendary caped crime.
1994;fighter to the big screen in the spectacular 1989 blockbuster Batman.
1995;Batman is an outstanding action.
1996;packed spectacle that honors Bob Kane's popular creation.
1997;Director Tim Burton's unique style gives the story much emotion and depth.
1998;Michael Keaton gives a fine performance as Batman/Bruce Wayne and Jack Nicholson is terrific as the Joker.
1999;The movie also contains some nice visuals, impressive action, great humor, cool gadgets and a rich music score.
2000;The cast also includes Kim Basinger, Robert Wuhl, Michael Gough, Billy Dee Williams and Jack Palance.
2001;for fans whom been waiting years for a special edition release, Batman Special Edition really delivers.
2002;minute Legends of the Dark Knight documentary, several behind.
2003;With such new bonus features, Batman: Special Edition obtains an A.
2004;Batman is definitely one of Tim Burton's best films and a great take on the DC Comics Batman series.
2005;michael Keaton in many ways is much more believable as taciturn and brooding Bruce Wayne than Batman.
2006;He's got the best lines and Nicholson is very hard to play against.
2007;the effects are still good and the action still keeps you glued to your seat, but the soundtrack doesn't fare so well.
2008;This film proved to the world that comic book films could be much more than action.
2009;This film (and the first sequel Batman Returns ) have so much more to it than that.
2010;Batman is a gripping and very moving exploration of the psyche
2011;The film is brilliantly acted by its perfectly.
2012;Tim Burton makes perfect use of his wonderful directorial talents, Anton Furst designs a gothic, beautiful Gotham City, and Danny Elfman's classic musical score further help make this a unique, thought.
2013;provoking, and very powerful modern classic, a masterpiece of film noir and grand opera.
2014;I think these films are all great in there own right.
2015;This is a must see film.
2016;But this is the very firstBatman film produced in the 1990's and they did a great job on making this film.
2017;i give this film *5* stars because it was a great movie!
2018;The Joker is the best bat villian.
2019;Great cast with Jack, Michael, and Kim.
2020;Best Batmobile and batwing too.
2021;like vision of the DC Comic is intensely stylish and dark, putting the Gothic into Gotham.
2022;Batman opens with a nihilistic, almost surreal depiction of Gotham City.
2023;In a city governed by violence and corruption, the mayor is struggling to restore confidence in the denizens before Gotham's 200th anniversary celebration takes place.
2024;tim Burton balances the dark tone of the film with just the right amount of tongue in cheek, as evident in several bitingly witty scenes.
2025;Michael Keaton's cleverly eccentric portrayal of Batman/Bruce Wayne imbues the character with as much dimensionality as it can bare.
2026;Jack Nicholson's sardonic performance as the maniacal Joker is simply brilliant.
2027;Danny Elfman's supremely original and stylish score is a classic, fitting the Gothic mood of the film like a well.
2028;Along with an engaging story and colorful characters, Batman is replete with astonishing eye candy and clever tricks like the sleek.
2029;The Batwing is one of the most spectacular contraptions (contraption is misnomer) ever to streak across the silver screen.
2030;The action scenes are expertly choreographed and entertaining.
2031;And the climactic battle between Batman and The Joker in the Gotham City Cathedral is a satisfying finish.
2032;This is the way to make a film based on a comic book!
2033;This live action story of the comic book hero, the caped crusader, is an excellent film by director Tim Burton (Beetle Juice, Sleepy Hollow, Edward Scissorhands).
2034;Michael Keaton's Batman and Bruce Wayne add interest to what the real Batman is like.
2035;But the one steals the show is the brilliantly cast Jack Nicholson who falls into acid and becomes the evil Joker.
2036;was the ultimate Batman in my era which is the 1980's.
2037;i' am not putting down the performance of George Clooney, Christian Bale and now Ben A. but you have to give Mike Keaton kudos for a great performance.
2038;I remembered this being a decent show back when it came out.
2039;Visually the show was stunning then.
2040;and it looks good now.
2041;Of all his movies, I've always had the impression he's kind of a visual guy.
2042;With an action show, I don't need much, and this was pretty good.
2043;i'm a throwback, but I still love my old PSP, so I was very pleased to find this movie on a UMD for it.
2044;If you enjoyed the show 20 years ago or so, I think you'll enjoy it now.
2045;It's got action, love, a villian, and a great freakin superhero.
2046;Michael Keaton is a great Batman (the best of them all) although he isn't as good as Vall Kilmer as Bruce Wayne he is definetly the best dark knight.
2047;Jack Nicholson steals the show as the Joker.
2048;Tim Burton did a great job of making gothim city dark and evil.
2049;So from reading this review you know that batmans the best.
2050;If you like this movie you should definetly see the secong one (Batman Returns).
2051;looks better and sounds better, and A classic.
2052;Just as great a movie as all the other ones.
2053;This is the one where Keaton made his first movie and again a great performance.
2054;The classical battle between Batman and his nemesis the Joker looks and sounds better than ever.
2055;Both Keaton and Nicholson's performance make of this film the cult classic it is for many fans.
2056;the Special FeaturesThe original trailer is included as well as many other documentaries that will be a delight for fans of both the comic and the movie.
2057;A new audio commentary by director Tim Burton that (as usual and if you are familiar with his previous commentaries) provides not much of extra or valuable information but is a nice to have.
2058;A great added value this edition has is the storyboards of the deleted Robin sequence.
2059;With all these details you can see and imagine how many efforts WB put in the production of this set.
2060;a great edition of this classical film finally completed with extras that make it a collector's piece.
2061;Tim Burton is a film genius.
2062;He immerses you into this world of crime and mystery.
2063;I believe of the four films that were made this one is the best one.
2064;Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson, along with Kim Basinger, highlight the awesome cast.
2065;Jack plays the joker perfectly, and Michael brings a dark mystique to Batman.
2066;If you are a fan of the popular comic see this film.
2067;The sets are mavelous as well as the effects.
2068;This is a fantastic movie .
2069;First, the music tells you that you are watching an epic tale
2070;We know that both men will eventually clash and it will be an epic struggle.
2071;A haunting vision of what a crime incident is like, IF you survive it.
2072;The tables have turned, he no longer has all the wonderful toys and the upper hand.
2073;He has to go straight up.
2074;a great film that reminds us that it takes someone willing to go toe.
2075;When we are as determined as Batman is to bring criminals to justice our crime problems will be greatly reduced.
2076;I love this movie when it first came out.
2077;This is a great movie.
2078;A good, if uneven film overall, on a sub.
2079;issue with some kind of reasonable special features.
2080;jack Nicholson is the real star here, regardless of the billing order .
2081;spirited maniac and can't nobody do mean.
2082;It's a lot of fun.
2083;I really enjoyed my package and I was satisfied as well.
2084;It was worth the wait!
2085;Tim Burton does an excellent direction job, the script is very witty and good, and Anton Furst's production design is dark, vivid, and also won an Oscar.
2086;Danny Elfman's score is a classic.
2087;Possibly the best Batman film, Batman combines humor with seriousness and Burton's distinct visual style.
2088;Better than the eye candy, special effects driven, colorful comic book adventures Batman Forever and Batman Robin, in which one is good and the other isn't that good.
2089;Also possibly better than the dark, dazzling, malevolent Batman Returns.
2090;Unlike the latest two Batman outings, Batman and Batman Returns rely on darkness, a great production design, Burton's direction, great makeup and perfomances, and cleverness.
2091;The other Batman films rely on eye candy, special effects, okay peformances, okay scripts with some funny lines, and comic book type adventures.
2092;All I can say is GREAT MOVIE and it's even better on Blu.
2093;I remember seeing this movie when I was a kid back in '89 and now I'm sitting back and enjoying it with my kids.
2094;Like I said GREAT MOVIE and the book was pretty cool my son had fun with it.
2095;Michael Keaton brings an understated disaffection in the role of the billionaire with a disturbed soul and dual personality.
2096;Robert Wuhl's character is especially unnecessarily comical.
2097;Nonetheless, the visuals are stunning, the action is taut and the film vastly entertaining.
2098;It is a testament to the film's influence that numerous comic book movies have subsequently used Danny Elman scores (including rival Marvel's Spider.
2099;CLASSIC!First Batman film, hallmark of the 80s and 90s.
2100;well done, incredible Elfman score, Joker's a bit cheesy, but Nicholson is still.
2101;hard fans allways knew the true Batman was a dark and sophisticated character, but in the public eye, Batman was Adam West in that goofy outfit who shouted campy one.
2102;handedly turned that image around and had an even bigger impact than today's Batman Begins (much as I love Begins) on the perception the average joe person had of the Dark Knight.
2103;keaton's performance as Batman is under.
2104;rated because it is subtle.
2105;Nicholson as the Joker does, in fact, do a wonderful job balancing fear with humor.
2106;visually, the movie is a real treat.
2107;The late Anton Furst won a production design Oscar for his work.
2108;Tim Burtons Batman is so fun.
2109;The best Batman, even better than the Dark night version
2110;best Batman movie of all time, but every superhero film that has come after it owes something to Batman '89.
2111;By now you've read a lot of reviews of this film and you know what's good about it, so I won't bore you with that here.
2112;jack Nicholson is really the star of the show, and he's far more exciting than Batman is in this movie.
2113;It's one of Nicholson's favorite roles and deservedly so.
2114;michael Keaton and Kim Basinger are wonderful in their roles despite being woefully miscast.
2115;I may prefer Christopher Nolan's Batman films, but I also recognize that without this movie, the ones I like more would never exist.
2116;Anton Furst's beautiful set design is mostly responsible for making the movie as visually striking as it is, a feat made more remarkable by the fact that Burton has no idea how to shoot it.
2117;And that is, really, at the core of the film's weaknesses.
2118;classic score is really all that propels the film.
2119;It's a great score and arguably Elfman's best work.
2120;ray is definitely worth the money.
2121;Its best selling point is the extensive catalogue of special features, and since I don't own the 2.
2122;ray was a treat for me if only for that.
2123;There was definitely nostalgia involved.
2124;tHE VERDICT:It's a really great blu.
2125;ray release of a pretty good movie.
2126;It's still the best of the 90's Batman movies
2127;Not a masterpiece by any means, but a flawed classic.
2128;Batman is such a favorite of mine, I can nearly quote the entire damned film.
2129;Batman Forever is the best of the series,but this a really close second.
2130;jack Nicholson and Michael Keaton are great in this.
2131;anyway,a great movie!Followed by one terrific sequal(Forever),one that is very underated(Batman and Robin),and one that is just plain awful(Returns,boy I HATE tht movie).
2132;I actually bought this movie for my husband for Christmas, its one of his favorites.
2133;He was so surprised when he opened it on Christmas morning and absolutely loved it.
2134;But he is still very happy that he has it and can watch it anytime he wants.
2135;Tim Burton's classic Batman revived the superhero movie genre in 1989.
2136;Burton's dark gritty vision of the dark knight is taken from the 1940's Batman comic, an iconic character who is a terrifying urban legend to the underworld of criminals.
2137;In the opening scene we see how something as innocent as going to the movies in this town can become a terrifying experience in this town for both the family of victims and the superstitious cowardly lot of criminals.
2138;michael Keaton is perfectly cast as Batman and his alter ego Bruce Wayne.
2139;Keaton easily shifts between characters in this dual role, going from Batman's menacing presence to Bruce's Wayne's tormented spirit and his boyish charm.
2140;He gives a breakthrough performance here
2141;He is clearly the best actor for the role available in 1989.
2142;Jack Nicholson is perfectly cast as his arch nemesis the Joker.
2143;Thankfully the batman is there to save the day in the thrilling conclusion.
2144;director Tim Burton does an excellent job in adapting the comic making sure the character fits the original dark vision of the late Batman creator Bob Kane.
2145;From the opening scene, sets, art direction, and the casting this film truly set the bar high for comic book and super hero movies.
2146;far before Tim Burton became a little too obsessed with himself, he created films that were stylish and meaningful.
2147;This film has incredible sets that make you feel like Gotham is a real unique place.
2148;They are just so great to look at and to take it.
2149;It can take multiple viewings just to appreciate the whole thing.
2150;The movie even after over 20 years feels very right.
2151;what really steals the show in this film is the acting and the characters.
2152;What we have are two characters that are so much fun to watch.
2153;keaton as Bruce Wayne is so enigmatic.
2154;The first time you watch the film, you'll be asking yourself what will he say next?
2155;Plus when he puts on the suit, Batman knows how to take care of business.
2156;jack Nicholson as the Joker is the star of the movie by far.
2157;He is the best to watch.
2158;, but he shows a level of insanity that is both funny yet frightening.
2159;do you like superhero, comic book, or just great action films?
2160;Tim Burton is what made this film the masterpiece that it is because he created a gothic.
2161;This is the best Batman suit model I've ever seen, it shows that Batman means business and is a force to be reckoned with.
2162;Micheal Keaton plays the introspective Bruce Wayne nicely but when he becomes Batman he is a commanding force that you can't take your eyes off of.
2163;Jack Nicholson played the Joker perfectly, breeding classy with psychotic like it's nothing.
2164;Danny Elfman's score is one of the best movie scores I've ever heard.
2165;It's true that movie's like The Dark Knight are very good movies but that movie and the others can never match this because this wasn't just a movie
2166;I am a VERY big Batman fan,and this film IMO is the best Batman movie ever.
2167;tim Burton did a great job with this film,and Michael Keaton was awesome as Bruce Wayne/Batman.
2168;keaton will always be my favorite Batman.
2169;christian Bale is good,but I think Keaton was better.
2170;jack Nicholson does an excellent job as The Joker too.
2171;just like a Batman movie should be.
2172;hands down,my favorite film of all time.
2173;Sure, he was smart and strong, but most of what he relied on was the Batman Suit and gadgets.
2174;He couldn't even fly
2175;Though the end with the Batman Airplane hanging unto the moon was very nice, but I was amused that such a great plane was incapable of shooting accurately at a man at most 20 meters away.
2176;This is by far the best Batman movie.
2177;I give Batman Returns and Batman Begins a lot of credit, but you can't beat the cast assembled for this movie.
2178;The combination of Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson is incredibe, and Kim Basinger, Billy Dee Williams, and Jack Palance make a good supporting cast.
2179;The story is excellent, with plenty of action.
2180;Overall, this movie is superb in every category.
2181;Good to have this movie.
2182;The product was in excellent condition when received and shipping was quick.
2183;this is the first movie in Warner Bros.'s Batman series, a collection of movies based on one of the world's famous comic book superheroes.
2184;Directed by Tim Burton and starring Micheal Keaton, the movie is dark and mysterious, but it also contains action, adventure, and lovable comedy (you gotta love the Joker, played with delight by Oscar Winner Jack Nicholson).
2185;In a time of darkness, there came new light.
2186;And in a time of evil, there came a powerful hero!
2187;But if you're a fan of superhero movies, this one is for you.
2188;experience the mystery, the slendor, and the adventure, as you are transported into the mysterious world of Batman, where you meet him for the first time.
2189;This is recommend to fan of comic books.
2190;Sometimes the first is still the best, and this Batman is my favorite.
2191;Jack Nicholson is the greatest Joker ever
2192;Keith Ledger may be hot, and I liked him, too
2193;those wonderful Toys (6 min).
2194;It looks a bit dated now, but is still a lot of fun.
2195;This new addition also has some good extras too.
2196;If your into the early Batman movies this is the one for you.
2197;michael Keaton and Kim Bassinger along with Jack Nicholson are great in this early Batman movie.
2198;The film has a fascinating look and feel to it, but that's about it.
2199;The casting is a bit off as well.
2200;Billy Dee Williams, Jack Palance and Michael Gough give good performances, though they are hardly on screen.
2201;The best performance comes from Jack Nicholson as the Joker, though he's nowhere near as funny as Cesar Romero on the Adam West TV.
2202;on the upside though, the few action sequences are pretty good, and Danny Elfman delivers a stirring original score for the film.
2203;I'd only recommend this film to fans of the Dark Knight, and those who enjoy Burton's work.
2204;But if ya want to enjoy a fantastic Batman film, I recommend both Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins, and Joel Schumacher's underrated Batman Forever.
2205;The best of the Batman Movies , and still should have been previewed , and , or consolidated with the  Bataman , From the Beginning  Movie , the 2nd best Movie in this Series
2206;I have not seen the new Batman flick yet, but for now this Batman, in my opinion, is still the best.
2207;Michael Keaton was a surprisingly good choice for the role.
2208;Nobody steals a scene like Jack.
2209;It's certainly 20 miles better than the day.
2210;This movie also features one of the best Batmobiles ever.
2211;A true classic that every child should see before viewing the new movie so they can see how it should be done.
2212;There is nothing bad about the movie it is completely perfect in every way.
2213;BATMAN is the best comic book movie ever.
2214;hero role better than Christopher Reeve(Super.
2215;The movie has great Music, Acting, Directing, and especially Production Design.
2216;Another good comic book film with GREAT production design is the Crow.
2217;Batman and the Crow are great movies which are just as equally Dark, Morbid, and Enthralling.
2218;Beautifully remastered and tons of special features.
2219;This is the Batman I grew up so of course it is my favorite.
2220;Chuck your old copy and get this masterpiece.
2221;proof, plus the Batman logo is a lot more upgraded and catchier with curvier and narrower wings.
2222;Movie was bought as a gift for my Son for Christmas.
2223;The casting for Batman was incredible.
2224;Micheal Keaton and Jack Nicholson defintely bring a lot spunk to this dark but highly moving film.
2225;But it definitely spear heads it a Batman of the future.
2226;I love Batman and I've watched all of the cartoons and movies of this guy.
2227;I also love the Christopher Nolan Dark Knight Trilogy, which is the franchise ever made for Batman himself.
2228;Lets get right to Tim Burton and his own version known as Batman!
2229;Everyone knows who Tim Burton is.
2230;With that said, we can tell that he was the perfect director for Batman back when it was getting made.
2231;So in truth, Burton may make really dark moments in a movie, even a little too much, but he still manages to make the development worth it in the end.
2232;I got very excited for every moment and just enjoy everything there was about the movie.
2233;I actually loved Michael Keaton's performance as Bruce Wayne and Batman.
2234;Even his performance as Bruce was good as well.
2235;action films of Batman ever made, so it can be forgiven.
2236;jack Nicholson was a great Joker.
2237;He made me laugh at times whenever he made a joke that was worth laughing over.
2238;I also love how the movie tells about his transformation into the joker and also has references to his alter.
2239;i also loved the performance of Kim Basinger as Vicki Vale.
2240;She brings out the whole visionary of Vicki and also manages to bring out something new as well.
2241;Another thing is that Basinger really brings Vicki's emotions to life and also her strong.
2242;She understands why Bruce does what he needs to do and takes his secret very well.
2243;In a way, it makes her more hot and sexy for that.
2244;the movie itself was well put together and allowed us to just enjoy everything about it.
2245;The graphics are not exactly as they are today, but they are still nice and well.
2246;Some really do a nice job at portraying Gotham City.
2247;The atmosphere of the movie is dark and exciting.
2248;And the design of the costumes, the adventure, and the emotional moments are amazing.
2249;as I look back on it now, I realize that there are a few things that could have done better and that I have moved on from this movie.
2250;The backstory of Bruce's beginning as Batman is told very well.
2251;So, as I realize that now, Batman is a great film and one of Tim Burton's great movies.
2252;It was dark (in its own way) and a great beginning for Batman himself.
2253;The answer is absolutely yes!
2254;You will enjoy every moment of it and just feel great afterwards.
2255;Just enjoy the movie and have fun watching what Tim Burton and many other people have created for us.
2256;But the original Batman , directed by the brilliant Tim Burton, is by far the best comic book movie ever made.
2257;Jack Nicholson plays the Joker, in what I believe is the best performance in his career.
2258;Michael Keaton also shows he is the best Batman of them all, his calm and broodingness appropriate for the Dark Knight.
2259;burton directs this movie perfectly, bringing in his patented cartoonish look, making Gotham the perfect combination of 'toon and nightmare.
2260;His wild imagination could not be better on this movie, as he must have had thousands of ideas to bring the classic comic to life.
2261;I hope that WB puts out an anniversary edition this year, since it has been 15 years since its release.
2262;For those who like the idea of a comic book going to film, this is the movie to watch.
2263;Aside from that, it is a great dark story about vengeance and classic good versus evil.
2264;An excellent movie all around.
2265;From the darker and more comic book feel to the superior musical score from Danny elfman this is still the best batman movie.
2266;Batman is a triumph of style over substance.
2267;Every shot of this movie looks exactly how a Batman film should look.
2268;The music, actors and effects are all appropriate.
2269;first off, Michael Keaton is the best Batman.
2270;He is physically menacing and suprisingly vulnerable.
2271;the film is overall good but it could have been great.
2272;He's out there, right now and I've got to go work.
2273;But the tone of the comic had changed since the 60's.
2274;sociopath killing on a whim and a laugh with goulish devices such as a flower brouch pin filled with corosive acid and his now trademark Smilex gas that can bring a smile to ones face only a coroner could love.
2275;It was one of Keaton's first dramatic roles, and it worked.
2276;nicholson steals the show as the over the top Joker, hitting all the right notes of insanity.
2277;Screen vets Michael Gough and Pat Hingle are great in their roles Alfred Penneyworth and Commissioner Gorden.
2278;The film, I think, got an Oscar nod for best set design.
2279;danny Elfman gives a memorable score to the film that should have gotten him an Oscar nomination.
2280;I hope Warner smartens up and releases a Special Edition to this film as well as the other Bat installments (well, we could do without Batman and Robin).
2281;Until 2005's BATMAN BEGINS appeared on movie screens, 1989's BATMAN was considered the best of Dark Knight's cinematic entries.
2282;free with stealing the movie from Batman and everyone else, for what it's worth.
2283;Batman is such a great movie .
2284;The original, which is by far the best, shows a dark and gothic Gotham city yet still has a hint of light.
2285;Burton is undoubtedly one of the best director's around .
2286;Batman Returns has a very creative and Burton.
2287;Seeing as though I was like 8 when this movie came out and I've never really sat down as an intellectual adult and enjoyed this movie, I decided it was about time.
2288;I find Bill and Hillary's romance more exciting frankly.
2289;This movie also took a lot of liberties assuming we were familiar with the whole Batman world.
2290;As a fan of the comic book, it takes a lot for someone like me to actually prefer to watch the awfully camp antics of Adam West.
2291;He is the worlds greatest detective, innovator and fighter of all arts .
2292;but also a man who is tormented.
2293;Pretty unbelievable stuff, but a superb film (also very well cast) and the audiences liked it!
2294;Give the imagination of the audience more credit.
2295;What you then get is a richer, more refined film (more refined because the stories and characters are based on decades of literary evolution as opposed to a third rate story knocked up in a few weeks) that will also appeal to true fans .
2296;If you want a good example, just look at Lord of the Rings.
2297;anyway, the Batmobile looked good, the Batcave was OK and Nicolson made a passable Joker .
2298;, good news is that Batman Begins was actually quite good .
2299;In my mind this is the best Batman, even considering the newer versions.
2300;time DC comics hero and 1960s television series, Batman is a screen triumph with plenty of action, fine performances, and an upbeat soundtrack.
2301;When The Joker (played marvelously by the one.
2302;hero action flick, director Tim Burton's dark portrayal of the Dark Knight is right on, shadowing Keaton and drawing a much more personalized characterization in the lead.
2303;Much more melodramatic than expected, Batman is a deep, devilish of a good time that embodies a true good versus evil theme.
2304;One of the better of its kind.
2305;The successful Batman movies were a great deal of the reason for the cartoon's existence, and the series outshines the movie in every way.
2306;sets, or you can start with one of the two Batman theatrical releases worth watching (not counting the not.yet.
2307;This is the best Batman movie in the entire series.
2308;It is dark, gothic, and the actors were superb.
2309;Michael Keaton is excellent as the Dark Knight and should of played him for the rest of the series.
2310;Jack Nicholson as the Joker was also an excellent pick.
2311;The following two Batman movies after Batman Returns should of been directed by this gothic wizard.
2312;Batman is a super hero classic and will be for a long time.
2313;I remember first seeing this in a movie theater in the summer of 1989, I was just a kid, and I was highly impressed.
2314;If you can only see one Batman movie and can't decide which one to watch, watch the first, the original, Batman the movie.
2315;I liked this movie because of the great actors and the appearance of the newest batmobile, also to see Gotham City!
2316;its by far the best one in my opinion.
2317;tHE WHO'S WHO: Starring Jack Nicholson, Michael Keaton, Kim Basinger, Robert Wuhl, Pat Hingle, Billy Dee Williams, Michael Gough, Jack Palance, Jerry Hall, Tracey Walter.
2318;: Latter day superhero movies (Spider.
2319;Director Tim Burton imbues the Dark Knight's revival with flashy fight scenes and grand comic one.
2320;nemesis the Joker have their origins adequately explored and the viewer has the distinct feeling that they can understand where both sides are coming from.
2321;The two are destined to fight mano.
2322;The Joker has a few nifty items including an acid.
2323;Batman, on the other hand, has his Batmobile, Batwing and a few other notable BatToys to play with.
2324;Both of the lead actors deliver key performances.
2325;Michael Keaton's droll, acerbic portrayal of Batman offsets Jack Nicholson's disturbed, slightly manic Joker perfectly.
2326;The darkest moments of the film are the most realistic in appearance.
2327;Where this disc really shines is in its audio.
2328;The car crash outside of the Monarch theater is particularly memorable as well as the Batmobile's charge through Axis Chemicals.
2329;There's also a French Dolby 2.0 surround sound alongside English, French and Spanish subtitles.
2330;The subtitles are presented within the borders of the film and are clear and easy to read.
2331;The inside of this atypical Warner Bros. paper case features a much better photograph from the film and also gives the thirty.
2332;There's an extraordinarily brief section on cast and crew information.
2333;There's an informative, although not very imaginative, series of production notes.
2334;She comes off more as a giggling schoolgirl than a sensual photo journalist.
2335;That's as close as this movie franchise will ever come to having bloodshed.
2336;It's the first time I had ever seen a crowd cheer wildly just for a trailer.
2337;ish film, right down to the fedora.
2338;keaton ended up doing an admirable job as Batman.
2339;hand fighting action that Batman was known for in the comics.
2340;on the plus side, Michael Gough made a fine Alfred and Pat Hingle was good as comissioner Gordon.
2341;Jack Palance as crime boss Grissom was good in a small role.
2342;visually the movie looks fantastic.
2343;The Prince music is pretty good and Jack Nicholson is having fun and Michael Keaton was a pleasant surprise, but mostly this movie is a by.
2344;of course, this is still a Tim Burton movie and it is beautiful for that and there are some great scenes that are worth repeat viewings.
2345;The best comic book film to date.
2346;Tim Burton's unique visual display will leave you breathless.
2347;Batman, or the Dark Knight, scares criminals and delivers justice to the city.
2348;He waited for many years to get his hands on Jack Napier, or the Joker.
2349;This movie is filled with comic relief from Jack Nicholson with his art altercation in the museum, 'love that Joker' commercials, and huge revolver.
2350;Michael Keaton is perfect as the mysterious, but tough Batman and Kim Basinger is too cool as his love interest.
2351;Listen for the soundtrack with its great orchestration and Prince songs!
2352;This movie is the coolest comic book film ever and will forever remain the best.
2353;The closing scene where Batman is on a rooftop of a building looking up at his signal is just the best.
2354;This movie is pure immortal.
2355;havent used the item yet but im confident everything is as good as it seems.
2356;I've liked each actor and version in their own way, but have to say that Michael Keaton, a comedic actor, really came through in this darker role.
2357;Jack Nicholson is also perfect as The Joker in this one.
2358;He pulls off the perfect blend of slightly.
2359;This first installment in the Batman movie series is solid, with a decent (not great) plot, and with stellar performances by Keaton, Nicholson, Basinger, and Wuhl.
2360;A lot of people will say that the Joker stole Batman's thunder in this movie, and I believe that's true to an extent.
2361;The good thing is that we get Batman, but also Bruce Wayne.
2362;Michael Keaton plays the role of Wayne to perfection
2363;Keaton makes this more than just a film about the Joker and Batman fighting
2364;The next movie (Batman Returns) is more his style, and a better movie than this one.
2365;Still, this movie is a memorable experience with lots of good one.
2366;Havingly recently seen Christopher Nolan's spectacular Batman Begins, I thought it was time to go back and re.
2367;tim Burton has long been one of my very favorite directors.
2368;With his taste for dark, humorous, wacky and often weird films, he was the perfect choice to direct Batman.
2369;Keaton was an interesting choice for Wayne/Batman, and he gives a great performance.
2370;Jack Nicholson is absolutely wonderful as The Joker .
2371;the score is definitely one of the film's highlights.
2372;It's by Burton favorite Danny Elfman, and was one of his earliest scores.
2373;It truly is fantastic .
2374;The Batman Theme is everything it should be and more.
2375;another terrific aspect of the film is the set design.
2376;The film's sets are magnificent.
2377;They perfectly capture the dark, Gothic city that is Gotham.
2378;all the aspects I've mentioned above work along with fine photography and a good script (by Sam Hamm) to make a really great movie.
2379;though I think it's kind of neat .
2380;Prince contributed numerous songs to the soundtrack, and it's the one thing which dates the movie.
2381;I'd highly recommend this movie
2382;I have always like the first Batman movie.
2383;I selected this movie for the office to have a movie day.
2384;Seriously liked everything about it.
2385;It had everything and did everything really well.
2386;Besides superman it was the only other really well done super hero movie at the time.
2387;Honestly they could have done a much better job.
2388;this film started a movement, and while others say cheesy Dark Knight, is one of the best films in ages, I think this one is far better.
2389;there's something about Michael Keaton, as Batman, and Jack Nicholson, as the Joker, that just can't be beat with remakes.
2390;I've watched all the Batman films, and by far, Batman 1989, is the ideal Batman film.
2391;michael Keaton is the best Batman.
2392;Keaton is Batman when we see him in the film.
2393;Also Mike's personality is darker, more intellectually savvy, and unique, than Christian Bale's attempts to fit into the character with the later Dark Knight film.
2394;Jack Nicholson, actually throws life into the character with his unique touch into the twisted personality, he adds a ton of glitz and makes the Joker appear more human, and more psycho in a realistic way.
2395;there's so much of this movie that is just stellar film making, including the Joker's crashing into an art museum, his mayhem accompanied by a boombox screaming Prince music, and Batman's whisking Vicky Vale away on a harpoon rope ride, that just can't be outdone.
2396;mann Kim Basinger wuz fine back then, great flick all round unless u can't get past the age of the film yay for batman fans!
2397;so his disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts.
2398;winning photo journalist who wants to uncover the secret of the mysterious bat.
2399;And just how does billionaire playboy Bruce Wayne fit into all of this.
2400;Tim Burton takes a darker twist to an over the top TV show that was loved by everyone.
2401;With a cool soundtrack by Prince and and awesome setting, please watch Batman, it's a true classic.
2402;Batman stands as an example of how to make a good comic book film.
2403;Above all, the film is just oozing with atmosphere, and Batman 's look is undoubtedly its #1 strength.
2404;see below), and, most importantly, a good man in the Batman suit.
2405;the film belongs to Jack Nicholson.
2406;he is probably the real main character of this movie.
2407;He makes the Joker both a funny and menacing character, and he gets all of the best lines.
2408;This was a role Nicholson was born to play, and he enjoys it with relish.
2409;michael Keaton was the best Batman, in my opinion.
2410;He makes this a Batman to root for.
2411;nevertheless, I really do like this film, and I get caught up in its atmosphere every time I watch it.
2412;it still looks good 14 years later (although some of the Gotham backgrounds were obviously paintings).
2413;This is largely thanks to director Tim Burton, who mostly understood how to handle Batman and his universe.
2414;he was the best man for this job.
2415;He gets help from a great score by Danny Elfman and terrific designs by designer Anton Furst.
2416;i would recommend this to all comic book fans, as it stands as an example of both a great comic book transition and of good filmaking in general.
2417;Good adaptation of the comic.
2418;Nice balance of darkness and humor with a very talented cast.
2419;Tim Burton directed this film in 89 and it has well surpassed the test of time.
2420;Casting Michael Keaton as Batman was quite a unique choice.
2421;Jack Nicholson IS the Joker, the role is by far the actors individual best and one of the best villans to EVER grace the silver screen and Kim Bassinger is lovlely as photo journalist Vicki Vale.
2422;This is the world Tim Burton created for Batman.
2423;This was the first and the best of the new era of Batman movies.
2424;Jack Nicholson and Kim Basinger deliver a perfect performance in this one.
2425;The opening of the movie is amazing, and it continues with stunning special effects, dark atmosphere, and suspense up until the end.
2426;The soundtrack by Prince is good.
2427;As far as originality and acting this one stands head and shoulders above the sequels.
2428;Jack Nicholson is perfect as the joker.
2429;The story and characters are great.
2430;I love every like the Joker says.
2431;Just campy enough, just dark enough, perfect!
2432;The good thing is, Nicholson's Joker is so good it should be center stage.
2433;Anyone who has read a comic book knows that the Joker IS over the top.
2434;He played the part perfectly.
2435;Tim Burton excels at taking well.
2436;the two characters oppose each other in every sense
2437;burton successfully creates a brooding, gothic look to his city and characters.
2438;He draws inspiration from Lang's Metropolis, especially in the final scene atop the cathedral.
2439;look beyond the script flaws to enjoy a fantastic performance from Jack Nicholson and a dark visual delight.
2440;Let me tell you a story, and take you back in time.
2441;finally, with the help of a well funded producer, and the creator of Batman himself, Bob Kane, Michael Uslan managed to get Warner Bros. to accept the possibility of making a serious Batman film.
2442;and so the great wheel began to turn, towards a date in 1989 when the world rediscovered a hero.
2443;Micheal Keaton uses his talents to portray Batman as a driven man, one who masquerades as just a social billionaire in the daytime, all the while waiting to descend into another life, the one he truly wants to live.
2444;jack Nicholson portrays an insane, but brilliant madman, the Joker, who terrorizes the citizens of Gotham with his cruel and deadly jokes.
2445;tim Burton redefines all the elements of Batman's world, and brings them to the big screen in a way never before seen by audiences.
2446;all in all, the first Batman movie is by far one of the best, and it captures Batman as he was always meant to be captured, as the Dark Knight we all know today.
2447;In 1989 Tim Burton brought Batman back to the silver screen like never before seen.
2448;That summer Batman blew the competition away at the box office.
2449;Michael Keaton proved he deserved to wear the cape and cowl and Jack Nicholson stole the show with his performance.
2450;The cinematography in this film is beautiul, leaving you with a timeless, dark setting that looks like it could have taken place in the 40s, the 80s, or whenever your imagination chooses.
2451;This is the way I look at Batman's transition from comic action hero to movie screen crime fighter.
2452;Anchored by Danny Elfman's theme music and Tim Burton's superb direction this movie gives us a picture of the dual Bruce Wayne/Batman personalities.
2453;In his intimidating outfit, Batman is a nimble fighter who can deliver his punches while absorbing a few.
2454;He's a face in the crowd yet still able to convey his emotions.
2455;We are introduced to an ambitious journalist, Vicky Vale, who arrives in town just when the Batman phenomenon is just capturing everyone's attention.
2456;for diehard Batman fans, there's enough gadgets in the movie to keep everyone happy.
2457;this is the best movie of the BATMAN saga and will most likley stay the best.
2458;Its a good watch if you haven't seen it since 1989, but other than that it is borderline boring.
2459;And he was always in control of his emotions and knew what to say, unlike this peculiarly neurotic version, who goes from extremes of cool confidence and rationality to wishy.
2460;The Joker, although well played by Jack Nicholson, is WAY over the top.
2461;If you're looking for a good comic.
2462;It's a much better movie, especially for kids.
2463;The first big budget Batman film with Michael Keaton was a very well done film and, if you don't own a copy, by all means the blu ray is worth picking up.
2464;The movie has held up well since its 1989 release .
2465;The video transfer is alright and looks nice and sharp .
2466;99% of the sound is right out of your front right and left speakers.
2467;Go to the menu and you pretty much are given options for the additional special features.
2468;it's a great film, and if you don't have a copy .
2469;this is still your best bet.
2470;Tim Burton's gothic style goes over very well with Batman.
2471;Michael Keaton does a terrific job as Batman.
2472;He brings both an edginess and comic element to the role.
2473;His over the top performance fits perfectly within the Batman universe and, again, provides balance to Keaton's performance as Batman.
2474;The other performances are fine as well although the great Michael Gough is virtually wasted in the role of Alfred.
2475;His style always seems to triumph over content.
2476;The best Burtom films begin with a solid well written script with few major changes.
2477;still, there is quite a bit to be said for getting the gothic mood right.
2478;Burton manages to see Batman closer to Bob Kane's vision vs. Hollywood's.
2479;Batman Return is a much darker but ultimately sharper film (and still remains the best in the series to date).
2480;I'd love to see the screen tests for Batman, rehearsal footage or outtakes.
2481;what really saves this movie is the casting of Jack Nicholson as The Joker.
2482;movie version of Batman,Mr. michael Keaton!
2483;I love this movie,it was brillant!
2484;The chemstriy among Michael,Jack and Kim was excellent!

2490;The plot was well put together!
2491;The ten songs from 'Prince' were priceless!
2492;Kim Basinger's constant screaming got on my nerves after a while!
2493;I bought this because I'm a huge fan of the film and Michael Keaton still remains my fav.
2494;But I do like the new Batman films or at least I loved The Dark Knight, Batman Begins did not impress me much.
2495;it just looks so amazing in hi.
2496;I sure did enjoy the movie.
2497;Michael Keaton did a wonderful job as Batman/Bruce Wayne.
2498;This was a real action packed movie.
2499;I have always been a fan of Michael Keaton, and when I saw this I just had to have it!
2500;This movie was wonderful and everything that I expected!
2501;If you are a batman fan, this is a must see!
2502;But it is definitely needed.
2503;This is by far the best packaging I have seen for the original, and in my opinion, best Batman movie to date.
2504;The original creation of Batman as intended to be dark and be mysterious which this movie mastered very well.
2505;The creator of the original story and comic book charecter, Bob Kane, was on set during the making of this film.
2506;I was pleased to run into this 2.
2507;disc collection of Batman by accident, as it serves the film well.
2508;the bonus features are numerous.
2509;I like the features that introduce the charecter of Batman, the creator, and the evolution of the comic strip charecter over time.
2510;I am very pleased with the digital sound and picture.
2511;I was very excited in 1989 when this flick came out
2512;There was a good buzz about the film.
2513;This is a quintessential example of style over substance.
2514;most of the high ratings of this film are from people who saw it when they were kids and they're just nostalgic.
2515;the acting in this movie also stands out as impressive.
2516;Michael Keaton plays a very introspective and intense Bruce Wayne and is spot.
2517;overall, this film really brings the character of Batman back to its dark, brooding roots.
2518;In typical superhero movie style, Batman features its share of cool gadgets and intense action sequences, but it also contains enough character development to make viewers care about the main storylines.
2519;ray far exceeded my expectations!
2520;Batman is one of the best super hero films I've ever seen.
2521;Michael Keaton portrays the role of Bruce Wayne and Batman very convincingly as well as Jack Nicholson as the Joker.
2522;The direction was really great for this film
2523;The special effects are definitely the best I've seen so far for any super hero movie.
2524;Jack Nicholson a. k. a. the Joker is the best comic book villain to grace the big screen
2525;Overall, the movie offers a very deep story about the Dark Knight and offers many action sequences to compliment the plot.
2526;I feel many Batman fans will love this movie as well as everyone else.
2527;You know, the more I go to the movies, the more I appreciate watching them at home.
2528;With wonderful little distractions like this, is it any wonder I prefer to stay indoors to maximize my cinematic enjoyment?This, the first of the modern cinematic `Batman' outings, became a case in point.
2529;It's kinda gauche, you know?But, aside from that, I rather enjoy this little slice o' comic.
2530;Jack Nicholson's Joker is one of his most nutso performances ever!
2531;scenes shows that he wanted the Bruce Wayne character to look like he HAD to dress up to be scary to criminals).
2532;Still, for the sake of putting together as thorough a review as possible, I gotta make a few sacrifices.
2533;anyhoo, there's a whole ton o' behind.
2534;scenes featurettes, retrospectives, and even a history of Batman in comic books featuring interviews by such comic book luminaries as Paul Dini, Alex Ross, Frank Miller, and Kevin Smith, as well as the late, great Batman creator Bob Kane.
2535;Quite frankly, I found some of the effects in this particular go.
2536;disc special edition release of the first Batman flick gives you about as thorough a look at the history, development, and making of the movie as you can get!
2537;Batman is a great movie, and actually won an Oscar.
2538;It is great to see Batman that clear with sound that is astonishing.
2539;My kids love the Batman cartoons, so I figuered why not let them see a good movie version of the comic series.
2540;This town needs and enima is probably one of the best lines in the movie, followed by Oh, we have a live on here.
