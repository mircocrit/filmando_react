18;Both De Niro and Grodin are terrific.
19;A good pairing of actors and a well.

38;The acting is top notch, not just from DeNiro and Grodin, but from the entire cast.
39;Each character is well defined and believable.
40;The dialogue is great, and the film is laced with humor.
41;the best kind of humor, situational.
42;the evolution of the relationship between DeNiro and Grodin's characters, as has been mentioned, is the core of this picture.
43;It is done magnificently and is the reason the film is so great.
44;The film is chock full of these delicious scenes.
45;A classic with two phenomenal actors.
46;He is now a bounty hunter based in Los Angeles.
47;Robert De Niro does a great job in this action comedy.
48;Great movie with tons of action and comedic lines throughout.
49;Got it from Netflix and rated it 5 stars.
50;Acting is great as well as the story.
51;It just keeps twisting and turning right up to the end which is the best twist of all.
52;Just perfectly made and acted.
53;career DeNiro and I can't stand Grodin in general, but they're perfect in this.
54;This is a great movie.
55;this?This is just a good movie, top to bottom.
56;A dream team of characters with many of them at the peak of their powers.
57;One of the funniest movies I've ever seen.
58;Definitely a movie that's in my top 5 of all time.
59;Good casting, comical, and a unique film.
60;Robert DeNiro and Charles Grodin were a good combination for this type of movie.
61;I have taken slack for saying this, but this has to be my favorite De Niro film.
62;come film with a great cast, and soundtrack (Danny Elfman).
63;This movie easily earns 5 stars.
64;plenty of shootouts, getaways and stolen vehicles keep the pace brisk while at the same time allowing us to get to know the characters.
65;A strong dose of comedy is also everpresent above the more serious relationship of Walsh and Mardukas.
66;excellent writing and acting throughout, and DeNiro at his best.
67;One of my favorite action comedies.
68;What do you define as a classic comedy?
69;Good choices, one and all.
70;But Midnight Run IS a classic.
71;Funny, intelligent, witty, this is a film for individuals whose sense of humor is matched by their i. q. and appreciation for perfect timing .
72;something that DeNiro and co. star Charles Grotin display time and time again throughout this gem.
73;end comedy and pulls off a major win.
74;He allows Robert DeNiro and Charles Grotin both shine as each other's foils.
75;What makes this a genuine 24 karat hit among the fools gold of its genre is its actors.
76;Robert DeNiro and Charles Grodin you expect to be pretty good of course, but their chemistry together is that rare cinematic commodity when two seemingly incongruent stars mesh perfectly playing off each others strengths and weaknesses in a comic dance that only a few comedy teams (Laurel and Hardy for instance) enjoyed.
77;While Grodin could be accused of doing this in a few scenes, it remains remarkable he more than holds his own literally handcuffed to Robert DeNiro for most of the films running time.
78;together they bring scenes to life and get laughs in remarkable ways.
79;A great example of this is in a scene taking place in a bus.
80;Yet while DeNiro gets frustrated and almost verbally abuses the woman behind the counter Grodin is able to bind with the woman by some sympathetic facial gestures which almost immediately makes the woman behind the counter trust him completely.
81;It's a classic scene. . . yet it's classic only because of what the actors' are doing, playing off each other.
82;He's masterful in the scene though leaves ample room for DeNiro to be an integral part of the humor of the scene.
83;But the actors are working as a team, not trying to top each other at all.
84;now I could stop right here and you'd probably agree it sounds pretty promising.
85;the reason everyone seems to be at the top of their game has a lot to do with director Martin Brest, who consistently lets his actors `breathe' and have moments and pauses to add bits of nuance to their performances.
86;He really did a wonderful job of this in Going in Style and even succeeded in turning what easily could have been a chaotic mess, Beverly Hills Cop (since it was originally written for Stallone), into an enjoyable action comedy.
87;There's a nice set up and some well written lines from writer George Gallo (which is nothing to sneeze at) , but mostly it's the actors, director and film editor that give the material all of its juice.
88;It helps that you've got some great get boogie.
89;He has a history with Chicago mobster which somehow ended his police career in Chicago.
90;A bond is formed between the men, and a respect slowly grows between them.
91;Grodin and DeNiro manage to play very real and quite endearing characters, finding a natural humor in their situation and relationship that is infectious.
92;what is surprising is how funny and even warm this exciting action comedy actually is.
93;This is a great movie.
94;I loved this and this is probably my favorite movie of all time.
95;this is one of those super rare comedies that remains funny even after you've watched it a zillion times.
96;realized and have their own scenes to shine.
97;of course, the number one reason why this film works so well and holds up to repeated viewings is the chemistry between De Niro and Grodin.
98;The many scenes that De Niro and Grodin share are so good because they are given time to flesh out their respective characters and develop their relationship so that you actually care what happens to them.
99;this was also Martin Brest's last great film.
100;Do yourself and a favour and check this movie out.
101;A buddy movie just for fun.
102;He is just the right combination of anal.
103;retentive accountant and deadpan comedic timing.
104;Yaphet Kotto is so much fun as well.
105;These actors are so far above relying on a single word to convey anything.
106;The dialogue was otherwise brilliant.
107;You'll recognize a lot of the cast as you laugh through this movie.
108;This is also a great movie to watch when you've had a bad day.
109;great performance from de niro.
110;The way in which these various elements cross paths and converge for a suspenseful finale is just one of the marvels of this well.
111;The interplay between DeNiro and Grodin is even more wonderful.
112;There are no jokes here, but the two characters are so well.
113;The two lead actors do masterful jobs and develop a chemistry that pushes this film toward the top of my list of favorite movies.
114;Midnight Run is like a timeless comedy classic with thrills and wonderful chemistry among the principal actors, especially between Robert De Niro and Charles Grodin.
115;Danny Elfman's music is unique, catchy and shows his immense talent to contribute to the fun narrative in the unfolding comedy drama.
116;I find this to be one DeNiro's best work.
117;I enjoy this movie so much, the comedy, the insults, the action.
118;Robert De Niro and Charles Grodin star is this action.
119;packed suspense thriller with a touch of comedy in between.
120;up toward the end that may keep you on the edge of your seat.
121;Good movie with great actors.
122;Can be watched over and over and is still enjoyable.
123;I hopefully doubt that there'll be a remake of this '80s comedy because this film is a riot thanks to this duo and also director Martin Brest who has lost his touch recently with Gigli and Meet Joe Black has perhaps made his best movie to stand alongside Scent Of A Woman with Pacino.
124;Grodin and De Niro are paired in what seems to be a match made in movie heaven!
125;Grodin is fantastic with his dry delivery and De Niro is top notch with his 'angry' persona.
126;I loved it the first time I saw it and each time I see it.
127;It is a must have for any movie buff who knows a great comedy when they see it .
128;and this one is one of the greats!
129;If you want to laugh, or cry laughing this is the movie with a pretty impressive cast backing them up.
130;This is the best movie if it's kind.
131;The characters are so entertaining and DeNiro is amazing.
132;I had seen this before and wanted to see it again.
133;Grodin and DeNiro are terrific together
134;Classic movie so glad I could find it at a good price.
135;All I can say is that this movie is outstanding!
136;It is both a great action movie and a fantastic comedy movie.
137;De Niro is hysterical and Grodin is the hilarious straight man.
138;EVERY ONE of the characters is memorable.
139;Charles Grodin's dead pan humor produced a terrific chemistry with De Niro.
140;Funny, sad, dramatic, comic, it has everything.
141;This is a great movie.
142;Timeless dialogue, hilarious and quick.
143;Midnight Run will be enjoyed by people who like lighthearted, well.
144;crafted films with mild suspense.
145;The movie is one big exciting chase with many laughs and entertaining interludes along the way.
146;Who knew, back in the Taxi Driver days, that Robert DeNiro could be this funny?
147;This is the movie I put on just before I take a road trip so I can fully appreciate how comparatively easy I'll have it, flight delays or not.
148;As played by Charles Grodin, hands down one of the all time best comic actors for playing close.
149;vest stonefaced characters, the accountant Mardukas is wickedly sharp at throwing monkey wrenches into Walsh's plans and in just generally driving him nuts, continually badgering him about smoking and asking him why he isn't a Chicago cop anymore
150;No matter what role Farina takes, though they're pretty much the same, good guy or bad guy, he's always entertaining to watch.
151;(For the record, she got over it.)
152;The story is worth giving it a chance.
153;I always liked this movie.
154;De Niro is a riot along with a great cast.
155;This is easily one of the 10 best films of the 80s.
156;DeNiro and Grodin are the perfect compliment for arch rivals that develop respect and friendship in a very humorous and engaging storyline.
157;This the kind of the movie that you will likely watch far more than once.
158;It is raw, it is funny, it's the kind of movie that leaves you feeling that you had as much fun (0r pain) as those starring in it.
159;extremely entertaining, one of the best movies I have seen of its kind.
160;The two main actors are wonderful together.
161;The touches of humour through it, the very real touching human situations that are not over the top or nauseating.
162;This is a great Deniro movie and Charles Grodin is priceless in this comedy.
163;In Midnight Run De Niro demonstrates just how wide a base he works from and why he's outlasted so many more critically.
164;Not only can he do heavyweighted roles in The Deerhunter but this films showed his ability to grasp roles that are a complicated mixture of darkness and humanity, allowing serious and comedic moments to unfold so naturally it's hard to believe he started his acting character as an extra (Scorsese's 1973 Mean Streets was, I believe, De Niro's breakthrough role).
165;charles Grodin is a masterstroke of casting.
166;Midnight Run is possibly one of the most underrated films of 1988.
167;Director Martin Brest has crafted together an original (for it's time!)
168;and very enjoyable film, full with great action, many laughs and a terrific cast (Joe Pantoliano, Dennis Farina, John Ashton).
169;The story, above all else, is the best part of the film.
170;I really enjoyed this movie.
171;Caught up with this 22 years after I first saw it .
172;DeNiro is in top form .
173;real comedy works best when the characters don't have to act funny .
174;the 80s had some good movies.
175;This is a delightful comedy.
176;After about 50 viewings and a 'hit' of Midnight Run every 2/3 months, the scene at the end when Alonso smiles at Sorrano in the airport is still the greatest ever.
177;The best action comedy ever made .
178;but please, people, help me .
179;It's one of the two funniest movies this old grandmother of 17 has ever seen.
180;out TV version I've seen once or twice is just as funny.)
181;alonzo Mosely: What should be of paramount importance to you right now.
182;A surprisingly tender and uplifting movie, F. word or not.
183;Part of the reason is the rich collection of minor characters, including a dumb FBI cop, an hilarious duo of bail bondsmen, and a wonderful set of performances from the mobsters who are after De Niro.
184;I think its a walk through for De Niro who is at his charming slightly neurotic best, Grodin is wonderfully endearing and to top it off, it has a happy ending.
185;One of the best feel good movies of the eighties.
186;One of my favorites Robert DeNiro and Charles Grodin work well off each other.
187;but director Martin Brest (teehee) vehemently opposed this idea and the project ended up at Universal.
188;the role of Jonathan Mardukas ended up going to deadpan Charles Grodin (though a young Bruce Willis auditioned) since Martin Brest (teehee) felt that he had the best chemistry with Deniro.
189;The FBI also want The Duke for their own purposes and The Duke is a clever and cunning enough to chuck as many spanners in the works as possible.
190;hit Beverly Hills Cop will find a lot of Midnight Run's pacing and cinematography familiar.
191;He is the kind of director that only makes a movie every five years or so but I have a feeling that Gigli has ended his career for good.
192;Even if Midnight Run didn't have a clever and funny script the chemistry between Deniro and Grodin is worth it alone.
193;couple buddy/buddy types before but they do it with class.
194;This is one of those classic movies where the actors really do play well against each other.
195;They annoy each other and it's funny to watch.
196;Love this one even all these years later!
197;Probably in my top 5 comedies.
198;Some of the best lines and deliveries of lines I've seen.
199;An unlikely pairing of actors that works absolutely perfect.
200;I hope you watch it.
201;One of the best fun movies of the 80's.
202;I had the honor of driving Mr. Brest, the director, on this film.
203;This is one you can watch over and over.
204;I had a great time helping make this film and you will have a great time watching it many, many times.
205;my best comedy of all timewatched this movie in the past many times now i can see it anytime i want
206;The acting is superb and one of my all.
207;time favorite actors, Dennis Farina, gives his usual spot.
208;Midnight Run is DeNiro's best movie as far as I'm concerned.
209;It is really funny and also warm (!)
210;Charles Grodin makes a perfect foil.
211;I used to hate Charles Grodin until I saw his great chemistry with Robert DeNiro in this movie.
212;Rarely am I a fan of a movie enough to write a review on it, but this is my favorite.
213;Grodin and De Niro are just great together, and that's what makes this a classic.
214;The movie held your attention all the way.
215;very good movie to spend a rainy night watching.
216;This film is one of my all time favorite's and if you have never seen it, watch it.
217;DeNiro is superb, Grodin is equally.
218;Together with Yaphet Kotto and Joe Pantoliano is a cast that gives you none stop laughs and the twists just keep on coming.
219;If you've seen it before, watch it again, you will love it all over.
220;I was watching this movie recently and I really took notice of the tasty R&B ensemble that makes up the Danny Elfman soundtrack.
221;The guitar work is so nice I did a search to find who it is.
222;I'm happy to report that the electric guitarist is the late Blues guitar virtuoso, Stevie Ray Vaughn.
223;SRV fans should give another listen to this fine soundtrack.
224;Great road flick with real world dialog.
225;One of the better and funnier comedies from the 80s, Robert Deniro at his best!!
226;Looking forward to be able watching this again and again in the future!
227;This movie is a classic.
228;Best Grodin movie ever, and DeNiro is unforgettabe.
229;Dennis Farina is the best character, though, and steals it.
230;Run achieves ideal balance between comedy and action, creating pure, adrenalized entertainment.
231;DeNiro and Grodin project surprisingly strong chemistry as polar opposites thrown together by fate.
232;Their inspired interaction elevates the movie well above the standard buddy picture.
233;This is one of my favorite movies.
234;The interaction between DiNiro and Grodin is classic, there is a nice mix of action and comedy with a surprising and satisfying ending
235;This is one great classic comedy.
236;the political incorrectness is hysterical and is a great example of comedy that is needed in future film
237;This is one of the funniest movies.
238;De Niro is excellent as always and Charles Grodin (who I am not that crazy about in general) is hysterical.
239;If you like action movies, this is the best NON.
240;De Niro and Grodin are the perfect comedy team.
241;The comic timing of both stars, along with a phenominal supporting cast, is impeccable!
242;It has action, comedy and a good story.
243;The acting is great as well.
244;It's a thoroughly enjoyable movie and I did enjoy it.
245;fast paced and funny from start to end.
246;De Niro and Grodin have great chemistry throughout and give great performances.
247;I have watched this movie over and over and still love it.
248;The interaction between Robert De Niro and Charles Grodin is so much fun to watch.
249;The sound track is perfect for the action and adds to the tongue in cheek humor.
250;It's one of my all time favorites.
251;One of my all time favorite movies.
252;The relationship between these 2 characters will crack you up!
253;DeNiro at his comic best.
254;wonderful, memorable, and quotable lines.
255;Very entertaining film which was serious in spots and very funny in others.
256;Robert DeNiro was great and the elusive Charles Groden was cleaver.
257;Still a good movie after all these years.
258;This is a great movie with a masterfully cast group of actors and a reasonably believable plot line.
259;Worth the investment for your movie library as I think you will find yourself going back to watch it again from time to time or watch it with friends to see if they love it as much as you do.
260;De Niro in one of his first comedic roles, teamed with Charles Grodin's dry wit, makes this a must see.
261;Grodin was always going to be harder to cast than De Niro, that's not his fault, but in MIDNIGHT RUN he matches De Niro so perfectly, note for note, scene for scene, that it's exhilarating to watch him.
262;One of the best comedies ever made.
263;It'll have you in stitches.
264;the soundtrack by Danny Elfman is 5 stars as well.
265;It was still a great movie.
266;I really enjoyed this fun movie.
267;My boyfriend had seen it and highly recommended it.
268;There is also a second bounty hunter that was put onto DeNiro's trail by the bond broker, and that leads to some amusing misadventures.
269;verdict: This movie is great.
270;It's worth the price if you want to see it on demand and worth the time that it takes to see it.
271;Here is a great movie for anytime you need a pick.
272;Great plot filled with comedy
273;Robert De Niro steals the show as a bounty hunter.
274;Charles Grodin does a memorable job as the Robin Hood type who steals from the gangsters and gives to needy organizations.
275;The Bail Bondsman calls the whole transportation to West Coast a Midnight Run or just a piece of cake.
276;With all this going on it makes for a most interesting film.
277;I love it and that is why I gave it five stars!
278;The cast is stellar, the dialogue is snappy [but authentic, according to my husband, who works in law enforcement] and the ending feels right.
279;It it's a great story with laughs and action but also has a surprising sentimental side.
280;I definitely recommend this movie!!
281;This is a surprisingly little known, brilliant, intelligent comedy about numerous criminals, two bounty hunters, one accountant and one FBI agent.
282;what follows is a brilliant comedy which takes us on 126 minutes long the incredibly entertaining odyssey through of most of continental Unites States by almost every way of travelling that is humanely possible.
283;i saw this film at least six times and every time I loved it even more, as I still discover some new jokes and goofs at every viewing.
284;The number of gags, both verbal and situational, is purely unbelievable and Robert De Niro and professional comedian Charles Grodin are simply UNBELIEVABLY GREAT!
285;This film has also considerable charm, is quite heart.
286;bottom line, this is an EXCELLENT film, one of my absolutely favourite modern comedies.
287;Now at the grand old age of 34 and a million action films later.
288;But language aside it was a great film!!!
289;Full of niceness and dedicated to the pursuit of niceness!!!
290;This is a really fun comedy.
291;De Niro is great, and Grodin is even better.
292;Farina, Ashton, Pantoliano and Kotto are all superb as well.
293;brest's directing is superb .
294;The movie was very well written by George Gallo.
295;bluesy music score by Danny Elfman goes so well with this film.
296;and the film is filled with dozens of cute and memorable little catch phrases :)But be forewarned .
297;This is one of my very favorite comedies and the dialogue is terrific.
298;Have always enjoyed this movie .
299;Midnight Run has always been one of my family's favorite movies.
300;Every line and every scene is hilarious and classic.
301;I recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good comedy.
302;De Niro, as always, is exceptional.
303;This is such a funny movie however, we had to keep the volume at the maximum because the movie volume wavered from real loud to real soft.
304;Great humor blended with a strong plot line.
305;I would highly recommend this movie.
306;The cast is stellar as well.
307;deniro and grodin make a hilarious pair as they travel across the country.
308;Charles Grobin is absolutely hysterical in this movie !
309;If you truly enjoy dry humor , this is a must see !!!
310;great action although the movie.
311;Dinero at his best,great actor.
312;issue it, this is a fun movie, and like Smokey and the Bandit before it, it really is funny, but has a level of seriousness to it, and also has a cross.
313;released with some extras, it deserves it.
314;Was interested through recommendation via the Sports Guy, Bill Simmons.
315;I thought it was okay.
316;All in all I was entertained.
317;Well, it's 12 years later, and I still think that funny man DeNiro gives a great performance here as a bounty hunter ex.
318;And like every good movie road trip, the two men learn to work together, and even to like each other.
319;universe Rain Man , no?All that being said, this is a very funny movie.
320;They play off each other (with the help of a great script by George Gallo) extremely well.
321;The comedy even manages to overcome the frequent moments of mayhem and destruction.
322;the supporting cast is quite good.
323;toting rival bounty hunter is manic and bullheaded and quite funny as well.
324;They are all pawns here, moved around the board expertly through plot twists and double crosses, helping to create a very entertaining movie.
325;That's something movie audiences should lament as well, for De Niro and Grodin were hilarious together in Midnight Run, one of the rare action flicks that combines thrills and laughs with fully fleshed, believable characters.
326;There's something happening every minute in this cross.
327;which makes this movie truly outstanding.
328;George Gallo's script is intricate and ingeniously detailed, and the top notch cast including Robert De Niro, Charles Grodin, Yaphet Kotto, John Ashton, Dennis Farina, and Joe Pantoliano really go to town with it.
329;Of course, director Martin Brest of Beverly Hills Cop fame did an incredible of a job as well (he makes a cameo appearance in the movie as well).
330;There are so many little details that perhaps seem irrelevant at first, but the way things end up coming together is uncanny.
331;The pairing of De Niro as the tempermental Jack Walsh with Charles Grodin as the deadpan Jonathan Mardukas (aka The Duke) is uncanny, and Dennis Farina, formerly of the Chicago Police Department, is characteristically brilliant.
332;Even the soundtrack is cool and meshes brilliantly with scene after scene.
333;With the great drama, suspense, and hilarity (including a number of classic one.
334;comedy of the best kind
335;Grodin's 'big moment' here is the hilarious Litmus Configuation scene which fondly recalls a similar scene with him in it from 1972's The Heartbreak Kid.
336;thankfully, it's in widescreen format, and also features the theatrical trailor which contains some bits left out of the finished movie, and a very entertaining and insightful Making of 'Midnight Run' as well.
337;This is a great movie!
338;Look familiar now?Still a great flick with some snappy comeback lines.
339;,to which Jack,(DeNiro),replied,Jeez,yeah boy,with you and all your millions
340;So he sends bounty hunter Jack Walsh (Robert DeNiro)to retrieve The Duke and bring him back.
341;Now it is up to Jack to keep The Duke alive and in one piece, while avoiding Marvin, the FBI, and the two mafia hitmen that are hot on their tails.
342;midnight Run is without a doubt the best buddy film ever made.
343;The reason is because Jack and The Duke's friendship takes the whole movie to develop.
344;The film also features the perfect mix of action and comedy as well.
345;There are certain points in the film that are extremely funny and entertaining.
346;The dialogue in this film is first rate.
347;Robert DeNiro has had a lot of great performances.
348;Charles Grodin manages to be just as good, and even better than DeNiro at times.
349;after all these years, Midnight Run is still a favorite of mine.
350;I have seen the film many times, and it seems to get better after each viewing.
351;Overall, the film features first rate laughs, an action packed story, and great performances from DeNiro, Grodin, Dennis Farina, and Joe Pantoliano.
352;I have seen this movie several times and always enjoy it.
353;The chemistry between DeNiro and Grodin is great.
354;It is one of the rare movies my husband and I both enjoy.
355;One of the best comedic gems of the 1980s.
356;The chemistry between the 2 main actors(De Niro and Grodin) is astonishing!
357;The pace is non stop and a true delight.
358;You will be left with a handful of delicious movie lines to share with your friends for years to come.
359;De Niro was never better.
360;I loved the late Dennis Farrara in this movie, Its great to hear him say Do something get a glass a milk or something .
361;The very end is awesome.
362;I will admit to more than a little bias, as this is my favorite film, period.
363;I watch it probably twice a year, and my daughter and I quote dialog which seems to apply to a myriad of our own life situations.
364;What can I say , I simply love this film.
365;It is a film so good that you lose youe elequence raving about it.
366;Don't just see this flick , own and love it'll be a start of a beautiful friendship.
367;i mean Patton is good flick considered a classic by most , I own it I've only seen it once and probably will never see it again.
368;Midnight Run (like the wonderful Plains, Trains and Automobiles ) is good to the thousandth viewing.
369;Midnight Run is a rare gem, a top class action comedy with one of the most unusual screen buddy partnerships in cinematic history, which has sadly been somewhat overlooked by the majority of people and that's a great shame because it boasts great characters, great comedy, great action scenes, a wonderful plot and a brilliant script with stand.
370;out performances from Dennis Farina, Charles Grodin and in particular Robert De Niro who proves what a great comedic (as well as character) actor he is.
371;Expertly directed by Martin Brest, who directed Beverly Hills Cop (and Scent Of A Woman), this is in my opinion a much better movie than the much lauded Eddie Murphy movie and a must see, particularly if you are a fan of Robert De Niro.
372;Midnight Run can't help but make you feel great, and you'll wish they still made movies like this one.
373;this is my favorite movie and I was allways looking for a copy for my self and I got one thank you Amazan.
374;The actors/actresses are excellent and the movie leaves me feeling good with a lot of laughter.
375;Midnight Run is an action comedy genre film with a narrative that focuses on bounty hunter Jack Walsh's (Robert De Niro) cross country escapade with convicted creative accountant Jonathan The Duke Mardukas (Charles Grodin).
376;It is a journey of self.
377;The steel heart of Walsh is continually eroded by the gentle and at times sneaky Duke, and their death defying adventure certainly brings out the best in both of them.
378;One of the best films ever made.
379;Witty script, compelling performances, great sound track, just one perfect film!
380;Shows de Niro at his most subtle best, and wonderful cameos from supporting staff.
381;No doubt one of the two will disappear, but I will still keep one to watch.
382;The plot has twists, turns and somersaults throughout.
383;My husband really likes this movie and we were updating our tapes and filling in with the older movies.
384;I also like the fact that it fills the screen.
385;A friend recommended it and I was dying when a helicopter was downed with a Beretta 9mm.
386;That will always make a movie for me!
387;You get it started and I'll run you over.
388;That's the best plan I can think of.
389;This 1988 film directed by Martin Brest ('Beverly Hills Cop') and a script by George Gallo brings the talents of Robert DeNiro and Charles Grodin in a mob.
390;action movie that is sprinkled with the right dosage of humor and wit.
391;risk/stress job
392;a good comedy with a great script carried through by the amazing talent of Grodin and DeNiro.
393;The pair really works well in this film to make it a laughing adventure to watch many times over.
394;Very of its time, but still very funny.
395;This may be one of DeNiro's best.
396;If you can get past this, it is a very funny movie that you will enjoy.
397;I still communicate with friends who also love this flick by using lines from the movie.
398;Unreal funny lines run through the whole movie.
399;The chemistry between DeNiro and Grodin's still impressive after all these years and the story has more than one valuable insight on integrity and friendship.
400;Robert DeNiro, Charles Grodin, and an excellent supporting cast.
401;It's an action/comedy, but there are moments of heartfelt depth and a wonderful chemistry between DeNiro and Grodin.
402;From start to finish, a fun movie with great comedic moments and a satisfying story.
403;From the uplifting music to the witty (sometimes ad.
404;libbed, I believe) repartee between the two stars to the believable, well.
405;acted supporting characters, this movie is a winner.
406;grodin is a very underrated actor.
407;wife is very touching, his rants about lyonnaise potatoes are hilarious, and his impersonation of an FBI agent tracking phony bills is priceless.
408;This is one of the funniest and most charming movies of all time.
409;Great performances by DeNiro and Grodin, a great plot, great action and comedy, not to mention a fantastic supporting cast.
410;I hope to see a re.
411;This is one of the best all time comedies around.
412;A great acting duo in De Niro/Grodin.
413;done, it shows the character of both the main heroes' as they trekk across the country.
414;This tale of friendship also lightens my heart, for it features two guys who go through a lot of trouble.
415;but both finding what they want at the end:Jack Walsh finds peace of mind, and John Mardukas gets his freedom.
416;the morale of the story is many, but the main one is: Always keep going for what you want, you'll get what you want eventually!
417;Always fun and a very smart movie.
418;One of my all time favorite movies.
419;A young De Niro and Grodin lead us on a hilarious cross country caper.
420;If you are a fan of the late Dennis Farina you must see this flick.

423;This movie has been a favorite of mine ever since I saw as young kid.
424;it quite frankly features some of the best acting I know of.

426;The writing is also great.
427;Great to see two fine actors like Robert De Niro and Charles Grodin whilst at their peak.
428;They appear to be having much fun.
429;Mix all this in with just enough humor and it all adds up to a very good movie experience.
430;this may not rank with de niro's dramatic classics made with scorcese, but it is one of the all time great B movies starring an A actor.
431;it's a funny, bittersweet tale that transcends buddy and cop movie cliches due to clever writing and superb realistic acting by the stars and the supporting cast.
432;Its fun when the character goes through un believable situations and comes out on top both actors are my favorite, Great Stuff
433;This movie is one of my all time favorites!
434;Its funny how many people |I have talked to that have never even heard about it!
435;written and efficient screenplay can make or break a film.
436;The exposition in Midnight Run comes out naturally and logically in normal conversation between characters.
437;But, anyway, if you haven't seen this, or if you have, it is a fine, fine entertainment.
438;This film pairs Robert DeNiro and Charles Grodin in a Buddy/ Road film/ Action story combination that results in one of the best pairnings ever in this type of movie.
439;Both actors are in top form and play off of each other beautifully.
440;The supporting cast is also excellent particularly Dennis Farina who delivers a superb performance as a sleazy mob boss who has an endless supply of creative threats to use to motivate his subordinates.
441;Yaphett Koto is also very good as frustrated FBI Inspector Alonzo Mosley.
442;It is the combination of DeNiro and Grodin that really drives the flim and provides both it's best comedy and it's more dramatic moments.
443;One of the best movies of this type I've ever seen.
444;There are so many memorable lines that the movie holds up to repeated viewings.

448;It will become a favorite if you watch it!
449;deNiro shows how to catch talents of improvisation.
450;His cheeky schoolboy look certainly supplies some of the film's lighter moments.
451;He delivers some of the best punchlines, when he replies: 'Well if you don't cooperate, you're gonna suffer from fistophobia.
452;'Charles Grodin is perfect as the prisoner who gets some of Serrano's records on computer disks, figuring if things got too rough, he could always trade them for his life.
453;He continually gets on DeNiro's nerves, and with his soft and ironic tone of voice he advises Walsh that a restaurant is 'a very tricky investment.'
454;the best parts of the film are, in fact, the interactions between the two stars.
455;The story holds up perfectly and entertains the viewer in every way.
456;Martin Brest does bring out the realistic, funny and moving sides of his likable characters.

470;I recently won a vintage `Advance' poster off E. bay, which was put out right before the movie was released.
471;day taglines are listed above the picture.

489;One of our top 10 favourites at home.
490;One of my favorite movies with Robert De Niro and Charles Grodin .
491;both are great and really developed quite a relationship.
492;One of the funniest films ever made that still manages to hold up an engaging plot.
493;it features some of the most genuinely stupid and amusing tough guys in the history of cinema, and a tantalizing slow burn by Deniro, a shortchanged ex.
494;The comic chemistry between Robert De Niro and Charles Grodin is top.
495;comedies that don't wallow in their humor are twice as much fun, and Midnight Run maintains a swift pace throughout.
496;wise, it's a dynamo of action.
497;I found the denouement to be quite moving as well, at the very least it provokes thought.
498;This is a great buddy movie but more than that, it's a touching story and FUNNY AS HELL. . . there haven't been many good comedy teams to equal DENIRO GRODIN in the 80's and as one reviewer notes, where's the sequel?
499;Just enjoy this one because IT'S THE BEST in all respects: script, supporting characters (almost TOO RICH), action, music, suspense, etc.

504;People who love comic gangster movies will enjoy it immensely.
505;I love Deniro and this is one of his best.
506;Charles Grodin gives his finest performance ever as he plays himself (a whiny jerk with a bleeding heart), the perfect foil for Robert De Niro's tough guy bounty hunter who won't sell out, even if it costs him his marriage and his family.
507;This is one of the funniest comedies of all time, but it also has a poignant, true feel to it.
508;also features great supporting performances from Yaphet Kotto at an FBI inspector and Dennis Farina as a mobster.
509;bTW, this is also my mom's favorite movie ever.
510;Robert De Niro and Charles Grodin are so funny together.
511;He is working for backstabbing Los Angeles Bail Bondsman Eddie Moscone played by Joe Pantoliano.
512;As a result, the trip accross the country for Walsh and the Duke is a crazy, hilarious and exhausting trip.
513;It is a trip to be remembered for sure.
514;Grodin and DeNiro will be friends in the next life.
515;Finding that out will make you laugh and keep you on the edge of your seat.
516;One of the best buddy movies ever with great comic performances by De Niro and Grodin as a bounty hunter and fleeing mob accountant.
517;This film is often overlooked on the lists of great comedies, but it deserves a high standing!
518;There are also some quite moving moments between De Niro and his teen age daughter.
519;Actors, screenwriter and director work together to keep the audience engaged and highly entertained.
520;Also Robert DeNiro's best, Charles Grodin's best, and one of the best 'buddy' movies in movie history.
521;DeNiro and Grodin play so well off each other every scene with them together(usually bickering, or DeNiro threatening Grodin with some act of violence)is a joy.
522;All the 'minor' characters are top notch, from Kotto to Farina(my personal favorite), to the wiseguys to 'Red'

524;Director Brest keeps it moving along at a nice pace, so much so you hardly realize it's 2 hours.
525;Great story telling and great cast.
526;This is so funny and so incredible brilliant you just have too see it to believe it.
527;It is so funny and so well thought out and written, that you must see this movie.
528;If this review doesn't help you in anyway, then just look at the average star rating and that should tell you something about how good this movie is.
529;more complexity = more laughs and surprises.
530;Grodin and De Niro are perfectly paired.
531;is also DeNiro's visit to his home and his interaction with his daughter, one of the most tender moments in an action film.
532;One of the funniest films of all.
533;DeNiro and Grodin are great together.
534;Many unexpected twists and turns during movie.
