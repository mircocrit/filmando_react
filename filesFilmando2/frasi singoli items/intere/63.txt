I:9102;1;A frighteningly realistic film about redemption from evil.
I:9102;2;The dinner table scene with Derek's father was one of the best of the movie.
I:9102;3;american History X is a brutally honest and raw account of a young man who joins a violent white supremacist group that primarily enlists young people.
I:9102;4;This is, without a doubt, Ed Norton's finest performance.
I:9102;5;It is one with such energy and madness that he literally seems at times to come off the screen.
I:9102;6;It is one of the best films I have ever seen, and without a doubt, should have won best picture and actor that year.
I:9102;7;I bought this movie years ago and it is intense.
I:9102;8;An extremely powerful film, at times I found myself struggling to keep my eyes on the screen during several highly visceral scenes.
I:9102;9;Edward Norton's acting ability in this film is the main reason why he is one of my favorite actors today.
I:9102;10;American History X blew my mind.
I:9102;11;This movie is a striking education on what is actually out there, and why things happen.
I:9102;12;on the other hand, the performances (especially by Edward Norton), the direction and the storytelling made up for it quite well.
I:9102;13;American History X is deeply moving, dripping with importance, and incredibly daring to say the least.
I:9102;14;The film travels between color and black and white images.
I:9102;15;The ending still gets me to this day, a movie you have to see.
I:9102;16;I highly recommend this realistic portrait of one man's determination to make right with an uncertain future and his embarrassing past.
I:9102;17;i would recommend this to anyone.
I:9102;18;the story is powerful, the acting is believable, the cinematography is awesome(color for the present, black and white for the past, lots of symbolism that you have to watch the movie a few times to really understand.)
I:9102;19;"American History X, Starring Edward Norton (as Derek Vinyard) and Edward Furlong (as Daniel ""Danny"" Vinyard), is one of the greatest silver screen efforts to bring to the fore a discussion regarding the construct of race and one of its many manifestations: hate both of others and yourself."
I:9102;20;The movie delicately balances the topic in terms of thematic coloring, i. e. black and white for reflection and color for the present.
I:9102;21;"Not only is this technique, effective in reflection, it also serves as a symbol to encompass and discuss the antagonistic positions held between ""Blacks and Whites"" in the film as well."
I:9102;22;american History X portrays the rise of a white supremacist organization and its impact on one Venice Beach family.
I:9102;23;"Given that it is told from a perspective not widely portrayed in American media: from that of a member of a professed ""hate group,"" it captures the attention and imagination of the viewer with its charged storyline and reflective camera work."
I:9102;24;"there are several poignant moments in the film
I:9102;25;Such a moment illustrates that as humans and social beings, our behavior is learned and acted out and the level of belief.
I:9102;26;time, American history X provides the viewer with many profound moments for consideration.
I:9102;27;In one such instance, upon Derek's incarceration, one of his initial teachable moments comes in the form of fellow inmate Lamont, masterfully played by Guy Torry.
I:9102;28;This appeared to be a sobering moment as to not only the reality of his situation, but of the rhetoric voiced by his mentor Cameron Alexander.
I:9102;29;With that question raging in his head, Derek begins a journey of self.
I:9102;30;Such a moment not only brought them closer together, it also serves, symbolically, as another turning point in not only their respective lives, but the life of their family as well.
I:9102;31;american History X is a wonderful movie replete with thought.
I:9102;32;nazi leader of a skinheads gang of Venice Beach, California.
I:9102;33;And then are the color scenes, the present, where we see a new Derek, a reformed Derek, he is now ashamed of his racist past, and now he has to fight to save his brother of following his footsteps.
I:9102;34;edward Norton is incredible as Derek, in this movie he offers his best performance so far, and that's saying a lot.
I:9102;35;In American History X he is as impressive as Robert De Niro was in Raging Bull or as Daniel Day.
I:9102;36;The rest of the cast is also perfect in this movie, particularly Edward Furlong as Danny.
I:9102;37;perhaps American History X may offend some people, but open minded people will appreciate better this movie.
I:9102;38;Everyone told me that i would love this movie, and after giving in and watching it, i almost kicked myself in the head for not watching it sooner.
I:9102;39;Great movie, i recommend you give it to all the rebellious teenagers out there who just don't care anymore.
I:9102;40;This is a clever way of showing that during the black and white portion, Derek is only judging people by the color of their skin, while during the colored portion he begins to see it's not that simple.
I:9102;41;Derek is reluctant, but knows he needs to do this to be a good role model for Danny.
I:9102;42;This relationship helps Derek question his prejudice and change his ways.
I:9102;43;The background music helped capture the mood of each scene and most of the time I didn't even notice it was there.
I:9102;44;"almost all of the scenes have great acting
I:9102;45;The first that comes to mind is a scene towards the end of the film where Derek is talking to Danny outside school before he turns his paper in.
I:9102;46;Other than that everything was very well done.
I:9102;47;the film as a whole is a very powerful experience and leaves you with questions of your own.
I:9102;48;The film certainly shows us in a crystal clear fashion what human hatred and jealously can lead to.
I:9102;49;Sure there are few shortcomings, but I still will wholeheartedly recommend this film to anyone looking for a well structured and powerful film.
I:9102;50;the movie is a must see.
I:9102;51;This movie shows that no matter how strong ones beliefs are that they can change.
I:9102;52;No person was better for this part than Edward Norton, he gave an outstanding performance.
I:9102;53;After viewing this movie I was conflicted.
I:9102;54;Without a doubt it is very distrubing and powerful.
I:9102;55;On the other hand some elements of the movie, technically speaky, are not perfect.
I:9102;56;I got to thinking does that matter.
I:9102;57;the plot keeps your attention.
I:9102;58;I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes edward norton.
I:9102;59;This is a truly great movie!
I:9102;60;It really makes you think!
I:9102;61;nazi that's what the life is about.
I:9102;62;This has a great story to it, if you can get over the fact.
I:9102;63;I bought this in the beginning looking for the scene from 25th hour, thinking this was the movie.
I:9102;64;which obviously, 25th hour is 25th hour and not American History X. I did enjoy this movie though.
I:9102;65;Roberto Benigni might have been humorous, but Edward Norton is the actor that truly deserved the Oscar.
I:9102;66;His wonderful performance ranges everywhere from frightening to compassionate, disturbing to emotional.
I:9102;67;AHX is the most shocking, moving, and simply amazing movie to come out of Hollywood since the Best.
I:9102;68;deserving Saving Private Ryan of last summer.
I:9102;69;Yes, the language and motivations of the characters will shock all who watch, but this movie will undoubtedly stay with everyone who watches it.
I:9102;70;It is a bit melodramatic and tries too hard to tackle a whole bunch at once, but this is a good film from both artistic and socially redeeming standpoints.
I:9102;71;if the idea of a coming of age film set in modern times tackling hard core social/race related issues sounds interesting to you, then you'll appreciate this work.
I:9102;72;It's kind of depressing, but it's also a slice of life from many and it does carry a strong message.
I:9102;73;prison changd Derek and the prison scenes were another reason why this movie has a very strong R rating.
I:9102;74;the movie is excellent but it is not a movie for everyone.
I:9102;75;norton made his character seem so real.
I:9102;76;Edward Norton (Nazi) is convincing as I have ever seen an actor be.
I:9102;77;once this movie ended I thought of it as one of the three most powerful emotional moments of my life.
I:9102;78;this move is a classic very good looking on blu ray if you have nice smart tv and good sound system and you prefer watch moves at home go for this title and enjoy classic movie in blu ray 5 star for this master pice
I:9102;79;I definatley recommend this movie to ALL ethnic backrounds!!
I:9102;80;We are white and what I didn't know was that this is my son's favorite movie.
I:9102;81;He has watched it six times now.
I:9102;82;He says it helps him immensely to not get caught up in the racism prevalent in his school and everywhere he goes.
I:9102;83;Absolutely stunning, a movie that goes from the pits of hatred through the eyes of those who feel that they are cheated, that nonWhites take everything from them and pollute the country, to eyes no longer clouded by hate when life is in late bloom.
I:9102;84;What starts steady and rises higher and higher its characters forming and reforming constantly the range of motions that goes with the dialogue is all too real and brings the feelings home.
I:9102;85;Fueled by a powerfully convincing Oscar worthy performance, `American History X' is probably my favorite movie of the given year.
I:9102;86;The reasoning behind his hatred is explained with such conviction and assurance that he begins to sell the audience.
I:9102;87;His performance is one of the most impressive and earth shattering portrayals of the human heart I've seen in years, perhaps forever.
I:9102;88;His control over his character is incredible.
I:9102;89;His conviction, his determination, his grip on his characters reality is so strong it's engrossing and absorbing.
I:9102;90;Derek Vinyard is a revelation.
I:9102;91;the film focuses mainly on the relationship between Derek and his younger brother Danny, played brilliantly by Edward Furlong.
I:9102;92;tony Kaye does a fantastic job directing this film, creating an unsteady air about the scenes that adds layers to the message behind this film.
I:9102;93;The film is forceful and blunt but it manages to invest itself so deeply in the audience that we become invested in the film and thus and compelled to keep watching despite the at times very harsh sequences of events.
I:9102;94;`American History X' may not be the easiest film to sit through, but it's easily one of the most important films to ever address the bounds of racism.
I:9102;95;Highly superior to the Oscar winning `Crash', `American History X' sets a profound statement that not only rationalizes with the villain but breaks down his barrier and exposes the scared little child growing within him.
I:9102;96;It is incredibly powerful, shocking and moving, lasting long in your mind after the end credits have faded to black.
I:9102;97;"The performances are particularly engaging, both Ed Norton and Edward Furlong giving career bests, and Stacy Keach, Elliot ""Father Gellar"" Gould, and Beverly ""Mother Griswald"" D'Angelo thankfully kept to an absolute minimum."
I:9102;98;class family, and not because it is wrong.
I:9102;99;And so, though the ending is powerful and shocking from an emotional drama point.
I:9102;100;i gave `American History X' four stars because of its power: just a look from the characters can rend your heart.
I:9102;101;motion footage and music, is incredibly moving.
I:9102;102;see movie, if only for the cinematic masterpiece that comprises the final scenes.
I:9102;103;Watching it as a drama, it is a great movie.
I:9102;104;Watching it as something else is deeply unsettling.
I:9102;105;Beautiful, brutal story about racism, social hierarchy, and family.
I:9102;106;This is one of those movies you have to see at some point in your life.
I:9102;107;Edward Norton is incredible in this one.
I:9102;108;I highly recommend this film.
I:9102;109;I first saw this movie on TV when USA aired it a few years ago, I thought this movie was really good.
I:9102;110;They did alot of great acting and although the movie is about racism I believe its a good movie because of the realism.
I:9102;111;Even though it is somewhat disturbing and definitely deserving of its R rating, this movie is something that should be required viewing for everyone over the age of 18.
I:9102;112;Its compelling insight regarding Neo.
I:9102;113;nazism, racism, and family issues delivers a powerful and shocking blow to even the most cynical viewer.
I:9102;114;we just finish watching this movie and admire edward norton role, he is just amazing and I love the movie because it deals with some sensitive issues that society would rather not talk about.
I:9102;115;He does play unbalanced quite well.
I:9102;116;There are definitely twists and turns in the plot, and it resonates when done.
I:9102;117;just a really deep movie and touches on rascism in the world and how you can make a change if you change yourself
I:9102;118;All I'll say is this: you must see this movie.
I:9102;119;It is probably the hardest hitting and most truthful movie you will ever see about the other side of racism.
I:9102;120;See it, you will not be sorry!
I:9102;121;The main thing I liked about this movie is that the storyline was top notch, This movie shows us how bad racism can be and how sad it could end to tragedy.
I:9102;122;Unfortunatly this was the saddest movie I ever seen but it was a great drama flick.
I:9102;123;That is what keeps you simultaneously revolted and glued to your screen.
I:9102;124;Because it deals with it in a way that is most effective.
I:9102;125;This movies doesn't insult the concept of reality in any way, but rather utilizes the concept in order to compose a movie so compelling that you won't be able to move when it's over, and you'll never forget it .
I:9102;126;American History X: rated R, 1 hour and 58 minutes American History X is a well.
I:9102;127;thought out thriller in which Edward Norton stars as an extraordinarily astute neo.
I:9102;128;The characters in the movie are exceptionally developed with skillful actors to match their complexity.
I:9102;129;Furlong's acting is sensational, but Norton in particular displays talent literally beyond human conception.
I:9102;130;He delves so deep into the character of Derek Vinyard that he easily wins over the audience in thoroughly convincing them of his animosity.
I:9102;131;His eyes are filled with deathly delight, his mouth twisted in a grin of sheer pleasure, and his cheeks glowing with the image of death.
I:9102;132;At this instant, as well as throughout the whole movie, Edward Norton puts in his greatest effort and captures and provokes the audience utilizing his incredibly skilled acting ability.
I:9102;133;I firmly believe that he is worthy of holding the best.
I:9102;134;Danny titles the report American History X and proceeds to type it up with minimal success.
I:9102;135;He submerges into his past and progresses greatly with his life story.
I:9102;136;The rest of the movie deals with Derek attempting to restore his own life and correct his younger brother's before it is too late.
I:9102;137;Chilling and forceful, American History X is aimed directly at the hearts of sensitive Americans like myself.
I:9102;138;It is in my opinion, the most powerful and emotional movie of the decade.
I:9102;139;The movie is created as a wake up call to America.
I:9102;140;As well as acting as a warning, the movie offers great insight into questions that many of us have forever yearned for the answers to.
I:9102;141;American History X is an incredible entertaining and educational experience.
I:9102;142;The movie brought tears to my eyes during certain sequences and fury during others.
I:9102;143;profound and mesmerizing, American History X, also starring Elliot Gould, Beverly D'Angelo, and Stacy Keach, directed by Tony Kaye, is in my eyes one of the most rich and enlightening movies of its time.
I:9102;144;I give it a flawless A+.
I:9102;145;The story of Derek and his brother Danny is a heart wrenching and intense story filled with prejudicial killing, intense racism, the culture behind gangs, and how a man's life can change.
I:9102;146;edward Norton does a FANTASTIC job playing Derek and it is amazing to watch the transformation he goes through after he gets put in the big house.
I:9102;147;It is amazing to also see how the power of influence plays over people.
I:9102;148;I saw this movie, and well, it disturbed me.
I:9102;149;It has the whole This Is What Racism Is And It's Bad theme, Edward Norton does a wonderful job portraying a man who has killed because he was a racist and then fighting with the demons of the killing, and the filming technique is brilliant.
I:9102;150;I can't explain it all, so I will leave you to see this movie on your own.
I:9102;151;This is one of those movies that everyone should see, but not one that everyone will like.
I:9102;152;ship very fast and a very good movie as will.
I:9102;153;I love this movie because it shows how people can become a product of their enviroment, yet change when they realize that everything that they've been led to believe is a giant lie.
I:9102;154;I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone 16 and up.
I:9102;155;"as a matter of fact, it is a ""need."
I:9102;156;"see"" for ages 16 and up."
I:9102;157;This movie is the reason Edward Norton is one of my favorite actors.
I:9102;158;I enjoyed every aspect of this movie except for the acting of Edward Furlong.
I:9102;159;Well, it's pretty violent and about every third word starts with F, but it's an important story, and based on a true story.
I:9102;160;He interrupts Derek's activities to tell him, and Derek goes out in his underwear with his semi.
I:9102;161;He also had several tattoos.
I:9102;162;They will call the class American History X, and Danny's first assignment is to write an essay all about his brother and his influence on him and on the community.
I:9102;163;"the movie is set up as a kind of morality play
I:9102;164;Still, his younger brother, played well by Edward Furlong, is fascinated by the power and allure of the neo.
I:9102;165;All of the cast, from Norton to Furlong to Eliot Gould to a host of others are excellent, and this gripping story of how easily hate, distrust, and violence beget more of the same is a sorry statement of what the not so benign neglect of the society toward its less fortunate sons and daughters can result in.
I:9102;166;This is an excellent movie and is one I highly recommend.
I:9102;167;This movie is a must see for everyone.
I:9102;168;This movie shows the life of a neo.
I:9102;169;The movie was entertaining and the acting couldn't get better.
I:9102;170;This movie has a lot of racial slurs and explicit language but it's essential to the story build up and the development of the characters.
I:9102;171;It will truly show the effect that big brothers and fathers have on the younger siblings: that they will follow and believe in what they believe no matter what.
I:9102;172;I will just say one thing, the ending is unexpected, you won't see it coming.
I:9102;173;always loved this movie growing up so owning it on blu ray is pretty epic!
I:9102;174;all of the performances are incredible.
I:9102;175;It's a edward norton classic .
I:9102;176;Its interesting to see the difference between the other movie rolls he has done .
I:9102;177;It is for mature audiences.
I:9102;178;this is an amazing movie Norton deserved an award and the issues in this movie are so real you can read them in the paper each morning.
I:9102;179;all performances are great and the effects of the black and white along with all the other effects and the story make this a rippa of a movie
I:9102;180;First of all Edward Norton delivers an absolutely incredible performance along with all the supporting actors.
I:9102;181;This is trully one of the best films I have ever seen.
I:9102;182;The film also does a good job of showing how racism is narrow minded and just not worth it.
I:9102;183;Just a very well written, acted, and shot movie.
I:9102;184;It makes you cringe, think, and draws you in as few movies do.
I:9102;185;edward Norton is clearly one of the best actors going and this is just another rock solid performance.
I:9102;186;ray transfer is well done, though not outstanding.
I:9102;187;I first got American History X because 1.
I:9102;188;One of my good friends said it was an amazing movie and that I would love it (probably because I love thought provokers.
I:9102;189;Because it is one of the greatest movies EVER made, and also one of the most important.
I:9102;190;West Chester is a very harmless place, and I first heard of the beheading, the whole town was in a shock, much like the setting of American History X.
I:9102;191;This movie is so powerful, and its message hits you with a sludgehammer.You have most likely read the summary of the movie, but what makes it so great?
I:9102;192;I can't even begin to tell you how many emotions I felt while viewing this movie.
I:9102;193;He gives such an ominous presence when the camera is turned on him, and that swastika on his chest only adds to this effect.
I:9102;194;edward Furlong, who plays Dannie Vinyard, does an excellent job as a younger actor.
I:9102;195;the hardest part in viewing this movie.
I:9102;196;is that it's so real.
I:9102;197;The only thing that we can do, is watch a film such as this, and learn from our mistakes.
I:9102;198;See what it's all about, see the undeniable truth in our society, and the pain.
I:9102;199;This is certainly one of the greatest movies I have ever seen.
I:9102;200;it's a bit old, but it is timeless.
I:9102;201;What makes American History X work so well is Ed Norton's acting.
I:9102;202;Beverly D'Angelo also does outstanding work as Dereks sick mother.
I:9102;203;This movie rocked the nation when it came out.
I:9102;204;Anyone that has seen this movie, can relate in one way or another.
I:9102;205;Everyone can take something away from this film, some lesson, some meaning.
I:9102;206;a classic, everyone should see this movie!
I:9102;207;I think Edward Norton played this role as a White supremacist is his best.
I:9102;208;I seen a documentary on the making of this film and I found it interesting how artist Tony Kaye put everyone through so much bull because he wanted to edit the movie since he was the one who directed it.
I:9102;209;After viewing the film like alot of the excellent films I seen I strongly disagree with the director's attitude on the film being unfinished.
I:9102;210;I think whoever edited this piece knew what an audience would associate most with the characters and made the film successful.
I:9102;211;A very eyeopening, intense drama that will have you questioning America's pursuit to quelling conflicts between racial ethnicity in this country.
I:9102;212;Towards the end I found it hard to pay attention.
I:9102;213;American History X is worthy, worth seeing, but not worth seeing twice.
I:9102;214;This is the best movie I've seen in the last 10 years.
I:9102;215;Here in AMerican History X he fits in perfect.
I:9102;216;A good portrayal of opportunities and obstacles of life in America.
I:9102;217;AMERICAN HISTORY X is so powerful, so engrossing, so well.
I:9102;218;acted, that I sat in silence for some time after the last credit rolled past.
I:9102;219;The message of hate and how it affects generations is something so true and ingrained in our culture that it often defies logic.
I:9102;220;And so goes this film.
I:9102;221;The two form a bond based on trust and understanding, and a love for sports talk.
I:9102;222;Derek is surprised when he actually survives his prison term, only to learn that his survival was helped along by his friend of color.
I:9102;223;"I wanted to see my hopeful thoughts come true
I:9102;224;an incredibly powerful performance by Norton and an even more powerful message of (possible) redemption .
I:9102;225;Great acting, story line a little gritty.
I:9102;226;This movie offered some insight into an area of society that's often overlooked.
I:9102;227;Edward Norton is a genius, and portrays the almost psychotic zealot to the letter, while showing the 'redeemed' Derek just as well.
I:9102;228;Half the movie is shot in color, symbolizing the present day.
I:9102;229;The present day scenes show Derek and his attempt to dissuade his brother Danny (Edward Furlong) from following in his footsteps.
I:9102;230;there are several great performances in this movie.
I:9102;231;Beverly D'Angelo was also outstanding in the role of Derek and Danny's mother.
I:9102;232;Avery Brooks is also excellent as a high school principal who can be both intimidating and compassionate.
I:9102;233;He plays the same character here, except that this role is far more powerful and emotionally charged.
I:9102;234;"There's a memorable scene in the movie where he's driving down the street in a van singing ""The Battle Hymn of the Republic"" substituted with White Power lyrics."
I:9102;235;However, this movie is extremely compelling, and definitely a must.
I:9102;236;I suppose I didn't understand the message at the time, and watching it again, I realize it is a great movie.
I:9102;237;Edward Norton plays the best role he's ever played (in my opinion), and I feel like most people who love it or hate it do so for the wrong reasons.
I:9102;238;His principle is appalled, and having taught Derek, instructs Danny to write a paper on Derek.
I:9102;239;Throughout the movie, you see images and events leading up and during his imprisionment.
I:9102;240;His younger brother gets invited to a party full of skinheads Derek knew.
I:9102;241;This movie is truly compelling and gives a real life perspective of Skinheads in todays socity, and not just giving them a bad name
I:9102;242;We see lots of compelling black and white photography, ominous film score and, especially, an awful lot of slow.
I:9102;243;Just a lot of family interaction set in a grim.
I:9102;244;It's difficult to watch, powerful, and it makes a statement.
I:9102;245;the film has striking and stirring social issues.
I:9102;246;It is more than just a story or social issues and racism, but it is also a story of family.
I:9102;247;This part was what made the film exceptional.
I:9102;248;The film captivated the pure emotion that a family faces in times of great tragedy and confusion.
I:9102;249;I originally thought that a person can succeed, even under the most pressing circumstances.
I:9102;250;this movie is a must.
I:9102;251;Amazingly, it has a first time feature director in Tony Kaye and a freshman screenwriter in David McKenna.
I:9102;252;He is also Danny's hero.
I:9102;253;When Danny finally sees Derek again he realizes that he has come home a man, and we witness one of the most powerful stories of redemption I have ever seen.
I:9102;254;He immediately makes his presence known to the Aryan convicts and is safe with them.
I:9102;255;"He tells Derek about his own angry days of youth:""I used to be mad too."
I:9102;256;Dr. Sweeney gives him help too, but it is a conditional grace based on his heart change.
I:9102;257;not only is Derek a man of honor when he comes home, he displays a compassion and protectiveness of his family he hasn't had for years.
I:9102;258;He is clearly appalled at where they have to live and they are his top priority now.
I:9102;259;x is an emotional and moving piece of work, a wonderful marriage of image, writing, and acting.
I:9102;260;He does not rely on the handy crutch of pathos but allows his progeny to live and move amongst the rest of us.
I:9102;261;The material he supplies allows Edward Norton to shine and give an Oscar.
I:9102;262;"Mr. Kaye shows a flair for the showy image at times but as Edward Norton states: ""his visuals."
I:9102;263;"are wholly unique"" and he does make his presence felt less than many other Hollywood directors."
I:9102;264;mouthing it to this day.
I:9102;265;"What is more ironic is this egotistical clown, who is by his own estimation ""the greatest English filmmaker since Alfred Hitchcock,"" could win an award for his work on the movie
I:9102;266;When I watched the Oscars, I was thrilled to see Roberto Benigni win the Best Actor Oscar, but having since seen Norton's performance for the first time, I can honestly say that he was robbed at the Oscars for the second time in as many nominations.
I:9102;267;See this film, if for nothing more, because it contains a truly great performance by a truly great artist.
I:9102;268;It looked good, so I decided to watch it.
I:9102;269;As I got into the movie, I began to enjoy, unlike a lot of the movies on this channel.
I:9102;270;the movies about a young teenager who really wants to be a skinhead like his older brother Derek Vinyard, who is famous for starting up a group of skinheads in Venus Beach, California.
I:9102;271;The teacher now sends Danny into a class which he will teach named American History X. To start off the class, Danny has to write a new report on his brother Derek.
I:9102;272;He is met early by the still bald.
I:9102;273;headed Danny, who tells him about the report he has to do.
I:9102;274;intense, disturbing, and touching at times, American History X gives the story of a family who has been torn down by racism.
I:9102;275;It pulls in family, anti.
I:9102;276;Def his best acting for this classic
I:9102;277;This movie has some strong language and sexual content .
I:9102;278;minded person can over look that and grasp the true message, it is inspirational.
I:9102;279;the plot centers around two sons in a Venice Beach, CA family.
I:9102;280;The film starts off very promisingly, with incredible performances from Edward Norton and Edward Furlong.
I:9102;281;Dialogue is snappy, and the rantings of Norton's character have an eerie half.
I:9102;282;There are a string of striking images, such as skinheads bathing a black store clerk in milk during a robbery.
I:9102;283;The film stays strong until after its midpoint, but it begins to descend into plot contrivances and melodrama.
I:9102;284;It remains a powerful movie, but tantalizes with the prospect of how great it could have been had the third.
I:9102;285;"a final note: very interesting casting sees supporting performances from Beverly D'Angelo, Fairuza Balk, Ethan Suplee, and even Paul Le Mat from ""American Graffiti""."
I:9102;286;This is a good and powerful movie.
I:9102;287;It shows us what the world is actually to life.
I:9102;288;They take a problem that has existed in the world for years and expanded on it and it moves people with the power behind it all.
I:9102;289;this movie is the most amasing movie ive seen.
I:9102;290;i think this is edward nortons greatest movie and the same with edwark furlong.
I:9102;291;American History X is a film that grabs your senses.
I:9102;292;I would highly recommend this movie.
I:9102;293;a lot of good information and great acting.
I:9102;294;This is a great series and makes the perfect gift.
I:9102;295;"I owned it in the past on VHS
I:9102;296;American History X will be a great film to discuss in regards to intercultural communication.
I:9102;297;Intense and as realistic as a movie can get on this type of subjectEdward Norton's performance is absolutely mesmerizing
I:9102;298;She said it is about a guy that goes to prison and turns his life around.
I:9102;299;American History X is a powerful film about a controversial and disturbing subject: racism in America.
I:9102;300;I think that the final product was very good, and I don't see why Tony Kaye didn't want to be associated with it.
I:9102;301;The film I saw was well directed and covered a very controversial subject remarkably well.
I:9102;302;I guess it is just that the subject creates very strong feelings, and it is difficult to come to an agreement about how best to convey the proper politically correct line.
I:9102;303;well, okay, that's a good reason for not joining a gang thereof, but the philosophy was not deconstructed AT ALL.
I:9102;304;The sister screams swear words at her brother, there's a winning defense.
I:9102;305;The sister's life, the one that rejects the racism her father has taught, is ignored.
I:9102;306;"With American History X, I fully expected yet another bombastic Hollywood race epic
I:9102;307;Although the story has holes in it big enough to drive a panzer through the movie held my interest.
I:9102;308;Special mention should be made about the excellent acting of all those involved, especially Edward Norton, who somehow makes Vinyard's transformation from psycho killer to penitent believable.
I:9102;309;In my opinion, Norton's presence in any movie is enough to raise it a star or two.
I:9102;310;All in all though, a worthwhile way to spend 119 minutes.
I:9102;311;it's message behind all of that is so powerful it can't be expressed into words,it's just a way of thinking that changes the way you feel about human nature.
I:9102;312;Loved how this movie was so thought provoking.
I:9102;313;The tale is stylishly shot and edited, perhaps too stylishly in its use of slow motion, lengthy black and white flashback scenes and dramatic musical score.
I:9102;314;A simpler approach would have helped the movie's sense of gritty reality and upped the emotional ante.
I:9102;315;Ultimately though the film is a bit too Hollywood and heavy handed, chosing to reach for easy emotional thrills, simple answers and consequences rather than to more fully explore its dark and complex subject matter.
I:9102;316;The movie can be at times VERY powerful, but true redemption is hard to come by.
I:9102;317;this is 1 of the most powerful films i have ever seen when it comes to true stories, especially if its a topic that is very sensitive.
I:9102;318;this is 1 of ed nortons most intense characters he ever played.
I:9102;319;not to mention every scene in this movie is strong in language, imagery, and subject matter.
I:9102;320;very powerful from beggining to end.
I:9102;321;Hated by most, enjoyed by many.
I:9102;322;Norton and Furlong's performance make this movie a must see.
I:9102;323;Ok, keep in mind I love this movie.
I:9102;324;The content is incredibly serious, and the scenes that are shown within reflect this.
I:9102;325;Derek's intense hate coupled with Norton's almost terrifyingly real performance, helps the audience see that there is some basis in the rhetoric that is presented in racism.
I:9102;326;I was scared at how convinved I was of Norton's performance, and deep thought is requied to try and overcome his sway.
I:9102;327;the plot is so gripping, you can feel the emotion around you while you watch scene after scene filled with nothing but hate.
I:9102;328;Norton truly deserved the nomination he got for the role, and I was surprised to see that he didn't get it.
I:9102;329;I would recommend this movie to anybody who hasn't seen it, and all I can do is hope that everyone enjoyed it as much as I did.
I:9102;330;It is a moving tale.
I:9102;331;There are very few films that I truly came away from stunned.
I:9102;332;The plot unravels Derricks penchant for leadership while Daniel looks up to him in awe.
I:9102;333;Filmed in both colour and black and white, this is very powerful film.
I:9102;334;making backed up by powerful performances.
I:9102;335;this is a powerful and impressing film that everyone should see.
I:9102;336;This is without a doubt one of the most riveting films that I have ever seen.
I:9102;337;Ed Norton, no slouch whatever his role, puts forth one of the finest roles he will ever play.
I:9102;338;This is one of those movies that kids should see and discuss.
I:9102;339;neo Nazi Skinhead (Edward Norton in a strong, believable performance) returns home to his middle.
I:9102;340;A strong rare drama that rings true to racism and changing the life style, you used to have.
I:9102;341;This is a thought provoking film that I highly recommend.
I:9102;342;Edward Norton's acting in this film is superb.
I:9102;343;The supporting roles are also played very well.
I:9102;344;It is also an entertaining movie as well.
I:9102;345;Norton's character makes simple and straightforward legitimate arguments.
I:9102;346;I thought the individual responsibility and liberty was a main tenant of the theory of natural rights, the very theory upon which our nation was founded.
I:9102;347;I'll explain in a minute, first let's give a small summary.
I:9102;348;Enriched by black and white flashbacks, and incredible emotion and superior acting by the main characters, and its supporting cast (Fairuza Balk, Ethan Suplee, Beverly D'Angelo, and Elliott Gould), AHX is a movie I'll always remember and love.
I:9102;349;the acting in this movie surely makes it great.
I:9102;350;All the characters are quite believable in their roles, and they make those roles come alive.
I:9102;351;Edward Norton's portrayal of Derek is one of the best performances I've ever seen.
I:9102;352;Furlong, Balk, and Suplee give performances of a lifetime as well.
I:9102;353;Watch this and be mesmerized by memorable performances, and highly emotional scenes.
I:9102;354;There is a certain graphic realism, and it shouldn't be overlooked.
I:9102;355;OK this is a good movie , it has a good story on rascial prejudice and how our own hatred only ignites violence after violence.
I:9102;356;True skinheads are anti rascist working class people who believe in unity and family support.
I:9102;357;This movie is quite possibly the most surprising film I have ever seen.
I:9102;358;Not only does he look the part (due to some serious gym work and some tattoos), his actions and rhetoric are so convincing that you can't help believing his character.
I:9102;359;A solid performance was also turned in by the supporting cast, especially Edward Furlong playing Danny, the younger brother.
I:9102;360;I have shown this film to several people, and every one of them has remained speechless at the end of the movie, mostly due to the surprise ending and the strong message this movie sends.
I:9102;361;The plight of his redemption is so real.
I:9102;362;As a half white/black women,the complexities of his racism are those of some of my uncles,Its a real life movie and Norton absorbed this character
I:9102;363;It is an awesome movie and tells it like it is.
I:9102;364;the ending was not what was expected, but made a very good point.
I:9102;365;Great storyline and great cast.
I:9102;366;You will enjoy this movie and it's message
I:9102;367;Furlong is a talented actor and is restrained in this picture, resulting in his performance being totally believable.
I:9102;368;This movie, at first, shocked me.
I:9102;369;Slowly towards the middle i realized that this is exactly what I see every day.
I:9102;370;It also explain better to me how people so easily can over.
I:9102;371;Despite how most people would classify this movie, I thought it was great!
I:9102;372;Edward Norton was so amazing and i can not beleave that he did not win the acadamy award.
I:9102;373;It is very disturbing but i do beleave it is very important to the film.
I:9102;374;Enjoy I guarantee that you will!
I:9102;375;It's a story of one man's true conversion to harmony with his fellow man.
I:9102;376;See this movie with an open mind and heart.
I:9102;377;The nominees for best picture: Shakespeare In Love (winner), Elizabeth, Life is Beautiful (Best Foreign Language Film winner), Saving Private Ryan, The Thin Red Line.
I:9102;378;O. k. I'll ask: Would any of you today, in your right mind, claim that any of these films (every one of them set in Europe, by the way), with the possible exception of Saving Private Ryan, held a candle to that enduring masterpiece, in the opinion of so many here, and elsewhere, one of the greatest and most important and moving films ever made, American History X?Over time, the vox populi imparts justice of sorts.
I:9102;379;something students if any of them have seen Shakespeare In Love, maybe a hand goes up.
I:9102;380;crafted piece of fluff (with its cavalier sense of history) made all the more delicious by the mellifluous, long.
I:9102;381;A decade later, an entirely new generation of viewers again experiences the intensity and passion of this magisterial cinematic statement and responds in kind.
I:9102;382;Like the audience, the film industry must eat to stay alive.
I:9102;383;When a great script gets made into a masterpiece, in Hollywood no less, even the best tend to shun or worse, pan it.
I:9102;384;take the greatest screenwriting mentors: Robert McKee and Syd Field.
I:9102;385;McKee's masterpiece, Story, may be best book ever written on dramatic writing (roll over Aristotle), or writing narrative, period.
I:9102;386;What is the favorite script of these genius pedagogues?
I:9102;387;No doubt a great script .
I:9102;388;in many senses a great film .
I:9102;389;a moment it eulogized .
I:9102;390;But to tell you truly, American History X (to my knowledge wholly ignored by both Field and McKee in their writings and seminars) is the greater script (for all the principles it betrays) and the greater film.
I:9102;391;I would say, in the progressive cadences of its tragedy, in the somber measure of its gravity, this script ranks with the best of Aescylus and Sophocles.
I:9102;392;That grimy little block of Venice, CA takes on epic proportion by the film's end.
I:9102;393;This is a powerful display of how racism is passed on from generation to generation as well as peer to peer.
I:9102;394;I would recommend this movie as an educational piece for any bigot out there.
I:9102;395;This was the film that brought Edward Norton to star status, and rightfully so.
I:9102;396;This is the platform for which Derick, the eldest brother of the family begins to form his neo.
I:9102;397;Derick is a bright, well spoken young man, and after his father is slain by black gangsters, he concentrates his energy upon forming a white, neo.
I:9102;398;it's a timely lession because we all do it.
I:9102;399;a beliver in the fact that anyone can change what they feel and with enough effort and love we can make a differnce in the lives we effect!
I:9102;400;I saw this movie a couple days ago, and I can't tell you how much I liked it.
I:9102;401;Edward Norton gave one of the best performences I have ever seen him give, and he really pulled me into his character.
I:9102;402;when his teacher from high school visits him in the prison there, he is opened up to the fact that it's all just an idea that can be broken.
I:9102;403;this is a moving story with the motion picture that just grabs you and won't let go.
I:9102;404;I highly recommend them for sure!
I:9102;405;This is a well told story of the moral transformation of one man .
I:9102;406;It's a story of human tragedy and the acting is superb.
I:9102;407;extremely disturbing film, with a strong important moral(or is it social) message.
I:9102;408;both edward norton and furlong's acting shine and help indefintely bring out the message in the movie.
I:9102;409;"From an incredibly unknown director, ""American History X"" is a powerful film that brings the audience face."
I:9102;410;Rather, it is white supremacy in the mind of an extremely intelligent young man played by Edward Norton.
I:9102;411;While anyone with reasonable intelligence can see the holes in Derek Vinyard's logic, the arguments themselves are delivered with powerful and forceful eloquence that is absolutely shocking.
I:9102;412;"Norton's performance is riveting
I:9102;413;One is able to go from hating him to being moved by him to absolutely routing for him.
I:9102;414;the movie is extremely graphic and moving.
I:9102;415;It manages to emerge from the rubble and provide a positive message for those of us who are left to deal with the world.
I:9102;416;I highly recommend this film to everyone.
I:9102;417;I sincerely think that the subject of AMERICAN HISTORY X is one of the most important matter to discuss nowadays.
I:9102;418;Just imagine, in the character played by Edward .
I:9102;419;Will he be able to convince Monty that duels are a no.
I:9102;420;Good subjects don't necessarily make good movies specially if there's only a yes man to direct.
I:9102;421;So, if you want to study the evolution of the right.
I:9102;422;This is an amazing movie from many views.
I:9102;423;An absolutely excellent way to complete the holidays for my family and myself
I:9102;424;All of the actors in the movie were incredible and i really like the movie.
I:9102;425;See this movie and you will be move
I:9102;426;It certainly has its heart in the right place, but it has a perfunctory feel about it.
I:9102;427;Norton's performance is brilliant, but while he plays both the fiery racist and the weary survivor with consummate skill, the transitions between these states seem to be missing.
I:9102;428;I have always loved this movie.
I:9102;429;Insight into the mind of what troubles America today.
I:9102;430;It is graphic and intense which keeps the tone of the move through out this amazing movie.
I:9102;431;This movie made me think a lot of how I look at and treat other people.
I:9102;432;The use of black and white flash backs was quite interesting.
I:9102;433;Well acted and the direction is great.
I:9102;434;A very well crafted movie.
I:9102;435;This film is scary, intense and intelligent.
I:9102;436;the dining table scene was incredible.
I:9102;437;Still, it makes a compelling statement and I was completely engaged throughout.
I:9102;438;I guess the point of a dramatic move with a message is to make you think and reflect when it's over.
I:9102;439;This is really one of the best movies I have ever seen.
I:9102;440;It moves along seamlessly with the black and white flashbacks accompanied by a beautiful score.
I:9102;441;Norton, Furlong, D'angelo, Brooks, Suplee, Gould and Balk give great performances and Tony Kaye does a marvelous job of directing.
I:9102;442;I give this movie a 5* rating and recommend it highly.
I:9102;443;this has to be one of the best onscreen performances from Edward Norton.
I:9102;444;hard to watch in places, but definately a movie he should have won the Oscar for for his portrayal of a Neo.
I:9102;445;"hes definately one of the best actors of this generation, since ""Incredible Hulk"" is his best film to date, American History X is definately Top 3 of his career."
I:9102;446;The film is very graphic in many scenes.
I:9102;447;the ending gets you the most.
I:9102;448;this was a powerful film that sent a real tough but good message out about hate groups.
I:9102;449;in the end it comes back to haunt the ones involved.
I:9102;450;It arrived very quickly and works great!!!
I:9102;451;The movie's whole point roles together at the very last scene.
I:9102;452;And since I'm a real punk I'm against racism.
I:9102;453;An easy way to see it (in my eyes) racism equals nazi.
I:9102;454;This movie is very deep and really makes you think.
I:9102;455;It's a great film and it tells that life is to short to hate each other all the time.
I:9102;456;It was great and it changed the way I look at people now.
I:9102;457;minded good guy who wants to save his brother from the skinhead groups.
I:9102;458;a genuine film about racism would be showing about average people and their racist beliefs.
I:9102;459;"That is the real racism in America
I:9102;460;Was it Edward Norton or Tony Kaye who made this film good?
I:9102;461;This movie was by far one of the top ten for 1998.
I:9102;462;It is good to see someone take a look at the white youth inside of always focusing on the bad things of the minorty.
I:9102;463;This was a very good movie.
I:9102;464;He befriends a black man and changes.
I:9102;465;nominated performance, is superb as the buffed, tattooed, skin.
I:9102;466;fascist bigots in Venice California.
I:9102;467;He totally dominates the film, and gives flesh and bones to his character so well, that some of his lunatic beliefs almost begin to sound plausible.
I:9102;468;And yet Norton is such a good actor that he makes his point sound reasoned, and despite ourselves we can see some logic in his rationale.
I:9102;469;not easy viewing, but worthy.
I:9102;470;This film should be compulsory viewing for every young teenager of 15 years plus, despite its R rating.
I:9102;471;"of course,Edward Norton is not the only thing that appeals to you in this movie:Edward Furlong is fine too
I:9102;472;but Edward Norton is the light that guides everything here,with a powerful acting (as usual),helped by those continuous flashbacks that help you understand the reasons why ,and changing wonderfully from full.
I:9102;473;after this one i have seen every film Norton has shown up in but Frida,and he is great.
I:9102;474;he deserves those 2 oscar.
I:9102;475;"so if you want to enjoy a very good ""old school"" movie with great acting and a delicate subject get this one.You will not regret it."
I:9102;476;"It's brilliant, with a very honest look
I:9102;477;Why this film is so good is that it actually takes you on his journey, and regardless of the content, that will greatly offend some, the message is clear if the movie is understood.
I:9102;478;"edward Norton, as well as Edward Furlong are so great in this movie
I:9102;479;It's true that Edward Norton gives a superb performance as a skinhead Nazi admirer and there are some arguments pro and against racism in the US, but the film didn't impress me.
I:9102;480;be wary, due to the subject of this movie and xcontent is received an R rating.
I:9102;481;if you want something powerful and important, watch it.
I:9102;482;Norton does an excellent job in his roles.
I:9102;483;A very brutal and terrifyingly emotional piece, American History X takes many cult and gang issues and packs it all into a gorgeous film.
I:9102;484;Norton and Edward Furlong, who plays the brother, give excellent performances that add nothing but integrity and believability to the film.
I:9102;485;While being graphic in nature, the film is a breathtaking view of what life is like in gangs and cults, and the life.
I:9102;486;He has the haircut, the friends, the ideals.
I:9102;487;He gives a performance worthy of the nomination it received for Best Actor in this year's Academy Awards.
I:9102;488;incarcerated Danny, he is a powerful and vile character.
I:9102;489;His skinhead rhetoric is delivered with force and conviction, and the way he kills one of the would.
I:9102;490;be thieves is one of the most gruesome acts I've seen.
I:9102;491;Once he's released, the reformed Derek is portrayed as soft and afraid by Norton, an amazing transformation.
I:9102;492;Furlong and Brooks give fine performances as well.
I:9102;493;Guy Torry, in a supporting role as a black co. worker in the prison laundry, gives an notable performance.
I:9102;494;This is an excellent film and only some tweaks in the plot development keep it from being a superior one.
I:9102;495;What a lucky move for me!
I:9102;496;Therefore, I will have to be content with passing on my own highest recommendation to my own students, encouraging them to watch and respond to it.
I:9102;497;I usually try to accomplish double duty while watching a movie.
I:9102;498;After its stunning conclusion, I found myself.
I:9102;499;But also powerful, profound, and dramatic.
I:9102;500;Highest recommendation for all thoughtful viewers!
I:9102;501;filled skinhead in AMERICAN HISTORY X may be his best, most powerful performance.
I:9102;502;Stacy Keach playing a cold, cunning, calculating mentor to the skinhead gang is extremely effective, and Edward Furlong is compelling as Norton's impressionable younger brother.
I:9102;503;and a very ironic friendship.
I:9102;504;a powerful lesson to take from AMERICAN HISTORY X, a compelling, engrossing, yet disturbing film.
I:9102;505;filled, most violent, and arguably best film.
I:9102;506;Norton is at his best portraying three personas as the film masterfully transitions forward and backward in time among adolescent Derek, skinhead Derek, and mature Derek.
I:9102;507;Edward Furlong is superb as the impressionable younger brother and fair witness to events.
I:9102;508;But you've got to understand.
I:9102;509;This movie was a very thought provoking movie, it leaves you with a sense that this would have happened to the family whether their father was killed or not from the way that he inflicted his thoughts towards racism towards his family.
I:9102;510;Great movie and it was shipped to me earlier than I had expected.
I:9102;511;My son recommended this movie to me when I told him I had just watched the chamber.
I:9102;512;American history was much more street level, gritty, suspenseful and entertaining.
I:9102;513;Strong well done performances, nice photography.
I:9102;514;Edward Norton gives what was probably one of the best performances iin his career.
I:9102;515;the director does a great job on the film and the ending was a bit of a surpriseI highly recomend this film.
I:9102;516;This is one of the most powerful films that can move a person, can really make a person stop and think.
I:9102;517;Edward Norton as well as Edward Furlong do a tremendous acting job in this film.
I:9102;518;One can learn a great deal of things through this film.
I:9102;519;You have to keep it real.
I:9102;520;American History X keeps it real.
I:9102;521;It gives perspective to a culture that some of us have never experienced first hand.
I:9102;522;After all these years, it's still going strong with new fans all the time.
I:9102;523;Though he claims that Edward Norton edited the film to allot himself more screen time, most believe there is something deeper at work here.
I:9102;524;equally as interesting: this film's script.
I:9102;525;(Though this conclusion is alluded to in the actual film.
I:9102;526;A credit to his talent, indeed!!
I:9102;527;(It is a common film.
I:9102;528;if you are interested in film art, keep an eye on the use of the sea .
I:9102;529;scape painting . . . his head engulfed in the waves.
I:9102;530;Some see the work as heavy.

I:9102;533;dinner table and the role of food in general in the films American History X and American Beauty.)
I:9102;534;Wow, what a great movie.
I:9102;535;I can't even express how good this movie is.
I:9102;536;I absolutley loved this movie and was very moved by it.
I:9102;537;It also serves as a great example of the power of brainwashing and redemption.
I:9102;538;American History X is probably one of the most profound works of art I have ever seen.
I:9102;539;"This is the kind of movie that transcends ""movie"" and becomes ""film."""
I:9102;540;"It is hard to watch at some times
I:9102;541;"The main character ""Derek,"" masterfully played by Edward Norton, is a white supremacist, who has gone to prison for killing an African."
I:9102;542;"After immerging from his time in prison, Derek, has found that his little brother ""Danny,"" played by Terminator target Edward Furlong, has followed in his big brother's ways and has become a skin."
I:9102;543;The film is so very strong in every aspect.
I:9102;544;Every character fits their role to perfection.
I:9102;545;This film is one of hope.
I:9102;546;It may not seem it at first glance, but watch the whole movie, it is so very worth it.
I:9102;547;It has so much to offer.
I:9102;548;Edward Norton gives an extraordinarily brilliant (and Oscar nominated) performance as Derek Vinyard, a neo.
I:9102;549;nazi skinhead in this explosive and powerful drama about two brothers caught up in a cycle of racial hatred and violence.
I:9102;550;brilliantly written by David Mc.
I:9102;551;notch performances from both its male leads (ably supported by Avery Brooks and Stacy Keach) American History X is an intelligent and powerful examination of the causes and existence of racial bigotry and hatred.
I:9102;552;Controversial because of its frank portrayal of rascists as human beings, the scariest part of watching American History X is how credible and believable Edward Norton's rascists arguments (as the charismatic leader Derek Vinyard) can be and how easy it must be for impressionable youth to be drawn into a world of hatred and violence.
I:9102;553;This is as much education as entertainment and essential viewing for fans of intelligent drama.
I:9102;554;This movie is a great (albeit dramatized) look into one of the most prominent racist groups in America.
I:9102;555;Having read numerous autobiographies of racists who have turned their lives around, this movie definitely hits the mark based on how people get involved in these groups in real life.
I:9102;556;i definitely recommend this film!
I:9102;557;The liberal bias in Hollywood is present, and you want prove watch this.
I:9102;558;The dinner table scene with Elliot Gould is the best example.
I:9102;559;While that may sound like cliche hyperbole to some, it's true.
I:9102;560;This movie really makes you think about these issues, and for that, along with the fine acting of the cast (especially Ed Norton), this movie is outstanding (a word I seldom use).
I:9102;561;the movie deals with Derek Vinyard (Norton), an intelligent, charismatic, and well.
I:9102;562;infamous scene involving the curb) are very well.
I:9102;563;another interesting point is how well.
I:9102;564;spoken and articulate Derek is.
I:9102;565;He actually does bring up good points about Rodney King, and illegal immigration in America.
I:9102;566;In short, this film is a must.
I:9102;567;Phenomenal movie, loved every second of it.
I:9102;568;Do no recommend watching for people with sensitive dispositions, its a pretty grimy movie.
I:9102;569;An excellent movie, it belongs in everyone's collection!!
I:9102;570;Some of it may be hard to swallow, probably because of it brutal honesty in it's characterizations.
I:9102;571;This movie is brilliant, and Edward Norton is at his best.
I:9102;572;this film allows you to see everyone as a legitimate person.
I:9102;573;I was pleasantly surprised by this movie, which for some reason I thought was going to be an action flick.
I:9102;574;Instead, I found a socially powerful, gripping film.
I:9102;575;Edward Norton once again proves that he is a fine actor.
I:9102;576;It's tough, gritty, brutal and honest.
I:9102;577;Hatred is something people feel at least once in their lives.
I:9102;578;but it's certainly worth a look for the curious
I:9102;579;It is just one great film, not a ten part documentary series by Ken Burns.
I:9102;580;This film may touch you on many levels.
I:9102;581;When I was a baby I played with a little neighbour girl who was black.
I:9102;582;In the film, Derek (a shocking and excellent Edward Norton) goes to prison for murdering two black boys who have come to his house and attempted to steal his truck.
I:9102;583;All the actors here are excellent, Norton being the most brilliant, to Beverly D'Angelo and the scary Fairuza Balk as Derek's psycho girlfriend Stacy.
I:9102;584;American History X is a disturbing yet realistic film that will make you think about the world we live in.
I:9102;585;It is one of those rare films that when you finish watching it, it will just stick in your head for days.
I:9102;586;"But it does impart a very important lesson, and I will have to quote one of the characters in the film: ""Hate ."
I:9102;587;Edward Norton, as usual, delivers an Oscar worthy performance as Derek.
I:9102;588;Fairuza Balk, while I would suspect that most of her scenes ended up on the cutting room floor, is also intense as Derek's girlfriend.
I:9102;589;A very gripping scene here is the lunch sequence where Edward Norton's character explodes and attacks his own sister.
I:9102;590;Beverly De Angelo's performance in this sequence is heart wrenching.
I:9102;591;But this film is very real, because the hatred that is depicted in this film exists up to this day in many forms.
I:9102;592;That in itself is worth the price tag.
I:9102;593;I was moved by the superb acting and intense story.
I:9102;594;It is a movie that you will definatley enjoy if you like Ed norton.
I:9102;595;this story is a very realistic one and any one who is interested in learning more about the way hate is contagious as well as dangerous this is a great movie.
I:9102;596;American History X is one example of motion picture that can be called cinematographic art!
I:9102;597;"It is absolutely not a film for those who go to the movies just for fun
I:9102;598;Proving that some legacies must end, it is a motion picture in which the image worths a thousand words, concerning a serious and real drama that affects not only the America but the whole world: the prejudice, one of the most irrational attitudes of the human kind.
I:9102;599;It is even better due to the remarkable performance of Edward Norton.
I:9102;600;American History X is definitly one of the best motion pictures ever produced concerning the racism legacy and one of the most powerful movies of all times!
I:9102;601;American History X is one of the rare movies that I remember after so many years after watching it.
I:9102;602;derek (wonderfully captured by edward norton in one of his many great performances) is a highly intelligent high.
I:9102;603;schooler destined for great things, but the seeds of racism were planted deep within and soon the innocent derek is drawn into the shadows.
I:9102;604;it is an important film and a powerful display onscreen.
I:9102;605;the black and white flashbacks are an interesting touch by kaye, and norton gives an unforgettable performance.
I:9102;606;This movie touched on the issue in an extremely powerful way.
I:9102;607;I know that most people can't stomach it, but it is worth seeing.
I:9102;608;It has got to be one of the best movies I have seen in the last two years.
I:9102;609;If you can get past the first scene, you can make it through the movie.
I:9102;610;It will leave you shocked and in thought.
I:9102;611;Part of you will want to hate him and part of you will want to love him.
I:9102;612;He'll strike fear in you and slowly caress your heart to a state of reflection and empathy.
I:9102;613;It is fun to get to know other cultures, and one grows and learns a lot about themselves in the process, but it comes at a terrible price.
I:9102;614;Multiculturalism is a looting of culture and tradition.
I:9102;615;american History X is a good movie, I highly doubt there is anyone disputing that.
I:9102;616;It's a great movie to watch if you want to have a debate about racial issues afterwords.
I:9102;617;But the scales are tipped in favor of non.
I:9102;618;It has always been one of my favorite movies, but now that I am learning to actually like my own people again, I see it for what it is, yet another brilliant propaganda piece made by Holly Wood, which is in fact an elitist magical world wanded by people who are not of my race, and who are famous for hating my race.
I:9102;619;Ha ha whitey, now the whole world is blaming you for our actions.
I:9102;620;with phenomena like the zimmerman case fresh in our mind, this movie shows real white supremacists and racists, their repentance and the ironic twist in the end that leaves you thinking.
I:9102;621;This is one of the best movies ever.
I:9102;622;This film sets a precedent in the way violence and intolerance are portrayed in films.
I:9102;623;Great film, at a great price, and i of course recommmend it.
I:9102;624;I'd wish only it had more features, but in the end the movie is the most impotant feature of all, and it is presented in great image and sound.
I:9102;625;It was truly worth it.
I:9102;626;I know some people don't like to admit to it but there are a good portion of younger kids today who feel this way, and I think this movie does a fairly good job of tackling this issue.
I:9102;627;One thought that crossed my mind during it was something I said earlier, there are people who feel this way, and it's scary.
I:9102;628;This movie won't change the world but it's a good eye.
I:9102;629;Great acting by Ed Norton and the kid who plays his younger brother.
I:9102;630;American History X stands firmly in one of the most moving films I have ever seen.
I:9102;631;This film should be carefully watched by mature audiences knowing right from wrong and please try to get the overall message behind the film.
I:9102;632;Which is hate breeds hate and love is the greatest blessing one can do.
I:9102;633;American History X is an excellent movie!
I:9102;634;If you are racist and think that it is right, this movie will change you!
I:9102;635;It also shows the touching story of brotherly and family love.
I:9102;636;It is the absolute truth!
I:9102;637;This is one of the movies that touched me more than any others have in quite a long time.
I:9102;638;At times this movies is difficult to watch but I think it is important for everyone to see.
I:9102;639;It is brutal yet honest and it is what good filmmaking is all about it.
I:9102;640;Edward Norton is a scary yet powerful actor and because this story is so sadly on target for today's society, it will hurt you to watch it.
I:9102;641;tEACHERS: An excellent film for high school students, provided they are warned about very disturbing violence and language.
I:9102;642;But after watching it we were both speechless and after finishing the credits, all he can say is beautiful .
I:9102;643;That summarizes everything with the movie.
I:9102;644;edward Norton is such a great actor.
I:9102;645;He should have won the Oscars for his portrayal.
I:9102;646;Ed does a good job of being a thug, albiet a somewhat less convincing job of being a convict.
I:9102;647;"there were some wonderful moments in this movie, such as when the Principal described the lesser Vinyard as ""misguided"" and sets out to straighten him out by taking a personal interest in him."
I:9102;648;nazis were and are thier own best spokespersons.
I:9102;649;"In this sense ""American History X"" comes close to ""Fight Club"", another entertaining movie which also did not burden itself very much with logical consistency."
I:9102;650;Written by David McKenna and somewhat controversially directed by Tony Kaye, this movie should disturb you with its frightening vision and at the same time entrance you with the wonderful performances.
I:9102;651;deserved Best Actor Oscar Nomination this year for the lead role of Derek.
I:9102;652;They carry their weight as the story unfolds.
I:9102;653;Through Danny's paper we see how Derek, a brilliant student, is turned into a bitter teen.
I:9102;654;"power"" will he get anywhere in life."
I:9102;655;ed Norton is wonderful in this role.
I:9102;656;During the time frame of the movie he carries us convincingly on the journey from embitter teenager to enlightened young adult.
I:9102;657;This movie well deserves it's R rating.
I:9102;658;If you are prepared for something like this I highly recommend this movie.
I:9102;659;The story is extremely powerful and the performances by all are moving.
I:9102;660;edward Norton's astounding performance saved it from this fate.
I:9102;661;His acting is at its best when his character Derek is at his worst.
I:9102;662;nazism when his fireman father is murdered by black gang members, Derek's powerful oration, lightning sharp mind and leadership skills help propel a group of Hitler.
I:9102;663;oh, the cinematography, especially for a relatively low budget film, is beautifully done.
I:9102;664;What I got was one of the best movies that I have ever seen, with a hard.
I:9102;665;This movie is perhaps the most powerful film I've ever seen.
I:9102;666;It gives true insight as to how a skinhead can be manipulated into thinking the way he does.
I:9102;667;Definitly one of the best movies I've seen.
I:9102;668;It realistically depicts both the overt and covert racism that still plagues our nation.
I:9102;669;Ed Norton, Avery Brooks and Stacey Keach do a remarkable job in this film.
I:9102;670;even though it was quite shocking because of some brutal and violent scenes, we liked it.
I:9102;671;american history x has a really good message about the danger of joining a violent group like skinheads.
I:9102;672;at first he is rather brutal and proud of the power he has over his family and right.
I:9102;673;american history x was worth seeing it.
I:9102;674;"A solid, worthwile movie on its own, ""American History X"" falls a bit short of being a masterpiece."
I:9102;675;Tony Kaye`s directional debut is a strong piece of filmmaking, a poignant urban drama about racism and the way youth deals with it.
I:9102;676;the plot focuses the relationship of Derek Vinyard (an excellent Edward Norton) and his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong, also well cast), who live in a Californian neighborhood.
I:9102;677;Derek and his friends have strong neo.
I:9102;678;Kaye knows how to deliver a gritty and realistic atmosphere, with an intriguing visual style and some tense and suspenseful moments.
I:9102;679;"despite some stereotyped moments, ""American History X"" is still a consistent effort, one that is both captivating and meaningful, way above most of the mind."
I:9102;680;Edward Norton's character evolves so much through this movie, it's amazing.
I:9102;681;First, he's the notorious headleader of a nazi gang, and at the end, he's become a genuine spokesman for peace.
I:9102;682;One of the greatest transformations I've seen from an actor/ or character to date.
I:9102;683;I was eager to see this film before it got released, simply by virtue of the fact that Edward Norton was going to star, and the extremely sensitive nature of the film (given it's subject matter).
I:9102;684;but the choice to shoot its flashback scenes in black and white is brilliant, not just for the symbolism, but also for the starkness of each actor's performance.
I:9102;685;one of the best films of the last 20 years and eaily tied with a simple plan (in my opinion anyway), for best film of last year
I:9102;686;(I believe Adrien Brody's recent win for THE PIANIST made him the youngest winner ever.
I:9102;687;norton's performance, as is generally acknowledged, is a tour.
I:9102;688;At the very least, Keach needed more screen time to establish why he was able to exert such a hold over Venice Beach's alienated white youth.
I:9102;689;It is a final, powerful reminder that the cycle of hate is nearly impossible to break.
I:9102;690;This movie is a great film and the acting is top notch.
I:9102;691;He may be the best actor in America now.
I:9102;692;The word riveting is, for once, totally accurate: you cannot take your eyes off of Norton.
I:9102;693;etc This movie answers all those questions very convincingly, very plausibly.
I:9102;694;It's a fascinating look inside a certain culture, a rare voyeur's.
I:9102;695;class neighborhood with a kind of an Archie Bunker.
I:9102;696;When spouting his views, he brings up all the points that mainstream politicians make all the time .
I:9102;697;(i. e. the kid is well.
I:9102;698;No description can do this haunting and moving film justice.
I:9102;699;edward Norton (The Score, Fight Club) is brilliant and Oscar worthy as Derek Vinyard, a bright young man who is at the breaking point and falls victim to the trap of racism by listening to the lies and propaganda of white supremist leader Cameron (Stacy Keach).
I:9102;700;American history x is an inspiring movie that shows how people change their ways.
I:9102;701;Two thumbs up for this movie.
I:9102;702;I just hope one day that this world can live in peace instead of war.
I:9102;703;provoking and has a redeeming message.
I:9102;704;Edward Norton is amazing in this movie.
I:9102;705;What really make this movie are 2 people.
I:9102;706;Whenever something comes up on the news about Nazis, skinheads, African.
I:9102;707;I have never seen a male give what is such an effortlessly amazing and truly masterpiece of a performance.
I:9102;708;writers, Edward Furlong, other supporting characters and good cinematography and design which flips from black.
I:9102;709;Totally amazing stuff, American History X earns a place on my top 10 films of all time, making it not only the best movie of 1998 but the third best of the decade, following American Beauty (it is obviously good to have American as the first word for your film title .
I:9102;710;all the movies that start with the country are fantastic .
I:9102;711;American Beauty, this film, American Pie, American Psycho, so on and so on) and The Shawshank Redemption.
I:9102;712;Ed Norton, a reformed racist/skinhead comes to grips with himself in prison.
I:9102;713;What this movie does is ask you about how are you going to handle it.
I:9102;714;ed Norton's performance is both frightening and powerful.
I:9102;715;It is also very thought provoking.
I:9102;716;the movie begins and ends with a beautiful sunset on an isolated beach.
I:9102;717;The music really adds to the surrealness of these two scenes.
I:9102;718;The background music also fit into that (and every other scene) perfectly.
I:9102;719;i highly recommend this movie.
I:9102;720;As always Edward Norton proves he's a powerful actor.
I:9102;721;The story is extremely powerful and disturbing.
I:9102;722;If I want to discuss my opinion about the movie, I'd say it is a well.
I:9102;723;done powerful disturbing movie that I recommend watching!
I:9102;724;It may not be suitable for some because of some violent scenes but at least there is a good cause behind this movie.
I:9102;725;All stressed on peace and love.
I:9102;726;"From the opening scene where Edward Norton gives that guy a ""California Smile"" this movie had my full attention."
I:9102;727;This is an amazing movie where Edward Norton gives a spectacular performance.
I:9102;728;It is an amazing movie about how racism and hatred doesn't get you anywhere and leaves last ripples.
I:9102;729;It's amazing from start to finish and the ending leave you stunned (and I cried).
I:9102;730;It was very disturbing and moving and is a masterpiece.
I:9102;731;The movie is excellent with powerful performances notably by Edward Norton.
I:9102;732;Edward was robbed!The movie is very powerful and moving and has a very sad and tragic ending.
I:9102;733;The movie is so powerful and moving and shows the remarquable transformation of a mean and angry man into a kind and caring man.
I:9102;734;this movie is one of my favorites ever and I recommend it to everyone.
I:9102;735;This is an amazing movie that EVERYONE should see.
I:9102;736;Tony Cave has made his masterpiece.
I:9102;737;The powerful first rate script is supported by the astonishing performance of Edward Norton.
I:9102;738;"despite the fact the influences of ancient films 
I:9102;739;dazzling direction and overwhelming performances.
I:9102;740;i could have gone w/ a little less moral at the end, but overall this is an excellent film.
I:9102;741;From the beginning, this movie plunges you headlong into the very real and very scary world of racism.
I:9102;742;Edward Norton gives a stunning and captivating performance as Derek Vinyard, the neo.
I:9102;743;nazi icon in South Venice Beach.
I:9102;744;Gruesome, riveting, and suspenseful, this movie had me on the edge of my seat until the very end.
I:9102;745;This movie allows us to view the struggles of life in poverty from the comfort of our couches.
I:9102;746;I stumbled upon American History X on the Independent Film Channel, and it has forever changed my outlook on life.
I:9102;747;The first thing that captured my attention in this film was the acting.
I:9102;748;Asside from Primal Fear, this is Norton's best piece of work to date.
I:9102;749;though X is extremely graphic and for mature audiences only, it is easily one of the most influencial and underrated films of our time.
I:9102;750;what else to you expect from him?Pros:*An extraordinarily brilliant performance by Norton(I say extraordinarily,because the performance was stunning,and not because Edward is usually mediocre,of course).
I:9102;751;personally,I think he's the best young actor out there.
I:9102;752;cons:*The movie,as a whole,is so.
I:9102;753;Strong, powerful, emotional, and interesting.
I:9102;754;i found the plot to be very entertaining and something I haven't seen from Hollywood in awhile.
I:9102;755;The acting was excellent, as you'd expect from these great actors.
I:9102;756;Then the more i saw it, the better it got.
I:9102;757;I personally think this movie is more worthy than many other movies of the same year.
I:9102;758;This is generally a very good movie which explores the issue of race relations, primarily revolving around the story of a neo.
I:9102;759;The acting is good overall, the plot is gripping, many of the images are (appropriately) horrifying, and Ed Norton is impressively buff.
I:9102;760;Again, all of this is illustrated well by the movie.
I:9102;761;Because of this flaw, and because the movie didn't really cover any new ground or offer new perspectives for me (I've thought about this stuff for nearly all of my life), I've deducted one star, but I can still recommend this movie to anyone interested in a vivid depiction of these issues.
I:9102;762;Edward Norton gave a grammy winning performance in this movie!
I:9102;763;Everyone should see this movie.
I:9102;764;Edward Norton once again does an execelant job acting.
I:9102;765;American History X is more like a documentary, than a story.
I:9102;766;The story is told in such a way as to keep you gripped throughout the entire movie.
I:9102;767;This movie is a must see, Edward Norton is amazing, A great cast to follow, I loved it, definately worth every penny.
I:9102;768;American History X is by far one of few movies I give 5 star ratings to.
I:9102;769;The movie itself is very powerful with a powerful message within the movie showing how a young boy growing up with certain feelings about society and the people within that society can change his life around.
I:9102;770;Though it also shows that same main character how he was able to change once he got out of jail for his crime and try to live a better life and watch out for the family he loves.
I:9102;771;Edward Norton delivered an increadible performance as a repentant skinhead.
I:9102;772;This was truly an amazing movie.
I:9102;773;It is Norton's best role, which says a lot because he's always great (Fight Club, Rounders, The Score, 25th Hour).
I:9102;774;American History X is an extremely hard core movie that reflects hard core life styles.
I:9102;775;It is unforgettable and will have a powerful impact on you.
I:9102;776;feeling towards Derek's racist beliefs and helps Derek change his attitudes towards other people.
I:9102;777;Ed Norton's portrayal as a young racist was chilling and convincing.
I:9102;778;I thought Ed Norton deserved an Oscar, however the academy gets weak knees about issues such as racism.
I:9102;779;I would recommend this movie.
I:9102;780;This is a movie about how life's experiences can create you, break you and change you.
I:9102;781;It is a story about a family and it's struggles to survive in a world that not fair or kind.
I:9102;782;This is a film that takes moviemaking beyond entertaining.
I:9102;783;This movie teaches, changes minds and makes people think.
I:9102;784;The images and story will stay with you long after the film ends.
I:9102;785;Edward Norton is excellent and has once again proven that he is a great actor.
I:9102;786;It is true there are some interesting scenes in the first four fifths of the film.
I:9102;787;His brother was redeemed by Derek's tale of what happened to him in prison and by the black principal of the school.
I:9102;788;The best movie I have ever seen in my life.
I:9102;789;While he may have had some stiff competition at the awards ceremony, I think it's east to argue that this is the best performance of the year.
I:9102;790;This is one of those impact movies that everyone must see.
I:9102;791;I would recommend this, Schindler's List and Boyz in the Hood to anyone.
I:9102;792;Three impact movies that make you think.
I:9102;793;Beautifully executed exploration of hatred, racism, and transformation.
I:9102;794;Edward Norton, the script, and the cinematography are all richly deserving of awards.
I:9102;795;Plus all that criteria for a good movie are in this film anyway.
I:9102;796;Danny not testifying portrays Danny's strong love for his brother.
I:9102;797;It will also explain Danny becoming more and more like his brother that is at time in jail.
I:9102;798;"This is a strong point in the movie
I:9102;799;At the dinner table one day, Derek talks about how his teacher is making him read this book, which has a premise of white prejudice towards blacks.
I:9102;800;the film continues with Derek in jail, from this point on the film jumps backwards and forwards a lot.
I:9102;801;After the incident he becomes his friend and you see Derek transforming thorugh this realization.
I:9102;802;there are two more powerful scenes that make the ending to the film.
I:9102;803;the film has nice ending with Danny reading his paper about his brother that he was asked to write by the same teacher that visited Derek while in jail.
I:9102;804;Another style effect that I found fitting was black and white color that was used whenever a look back to the past was made.
I:9102;805;this movie is one of the best movies for its originality with dealing with racism, ignorance and prejudice.
I:9102;806;This film at the least has made people think about the truth of our society.
I:9102;807;People can easily identify with this film it seems so real and it's so powerful, that you think you've just witnessed a lot if it right in front of you and not on a screen.
I:9102;808;But it gives a fantastic idea of racism, and Ed Norton and Ed Furlong are both incredible in it.
I:9102;809;The movie has a very powerful message, and even I found myself on the verge of tears at the end.
I:9102;810;You'll have a great time.
I:9102;811;Edward Norton, one of today's finest actors, stars as a former white supremacist recently released from prison who tries to save his brother Edward Furlong from following in his footsteps.
I:9102;812;Norton is riveting in the central role, bringing an all.
I:9102;813;The supporting cast are fine.
I:9102;814;The black and white and colour cinematography are excellent and used to great effect.
I:9102;815;Tony Kaye's American History X is a work of art.
I:9102;816;It is one of the more brilliant stories of our time.
I:9102;817;Everything fits as it should.
I:9102;818;All the while it is accompanied by a beautiful score that not only shows the dark life of our hero, but also the beauty of nature and life in essence.
I:9102;819;The dialog is realistic and never overacted.
I:9102;820;Ed Norton should havebeen nominated for best actor for his role in this film.
I:9102;821;You can see all the emotions of his character just by looking in his eyes.
I:9102;822;Edward Furlong proves to us that he CAN act.
I:9102;823;Also, AHX has some of the best cinematography that can be found in these days of flashy camera angles.
I:9102;824;The cinematography actually makes sense in portraying the drama and seems necessary in all of its usage.
I:9102;825;By far one of the best films of the year.
I:9102;826;This movie has breathtaking preformances by Norton and Furlong alike.
I:9102;827;This is one of my personal all time favourites and would recommend it to anyone in a second.
I:9102;828;The sheer power that it delivers in every scene depicting the hatred and conflagrations that still take place to this day in places is mesmorizing.
I:9102;829;Nothing else can compare to this beautifully filmed masterpiece.
I:9102;830;A great add to anyone's collection!
I:9102;831;thus provokes a struggle between the two, and esentially their family and friends.
I:9102;832;great acting by both men.
I:9102;833;"stayed historically accurate
I:9102;834;Its the type of movie youre going to want to see.
I:9102;835;the ending is still quite a point of contention though, and with good reason.
I:9102;836;viewing the movie from my perspective, though, the story was actually speaking to everyone trying to reform Danny through Derek's story.
I:9102;837;He's exploring the story of his brother, as we are, because he needs to learn something from it.
I:9102;838;It's a cycle that we need to break, and that's really what the ending, including the ending Abraham Lincoln quote signifies.
I:9102;839;i highly recommend this movie.
I:9102;840;Great product, love the movie.
I:9102;841;Took a while to ship from this seller but movie is great overall.
I:9102;842;The movie also displayed the anti.
I:9102;843;He shot them in self.
I:9102;844;I listened to what Ed was saying in that conversation, and tend to agree with what much of what he said.
I:9102;845;It's all about personal, individual responsibility questioning, then rising above, the herd mentality.
I:9102;846;what it does to people and what it takes to change a person's heart .
I:9102;847;should be required viewing for everybody.
I:9102;848;The final line of the movie What have I done??
I:9102;849;it's truly a great work.
I:9102;850;Ed Furlong is, as usual, excellent as a troubled young man with adorably floppy hair.
I:9102;851;The acting was fantastic and the plot wonderful.
I:9102;852;I reccommend this to anyone who likes a good intense film.
I:9102;853;"they have lots of phsychal power and can gain followers just by acting/looking ""cool""It is a subject that still exisist's in many schools today even if people refuse to believe it."
I:9102;854;This movie lead me away from the world of hate I almost fell into and it has helped many others.
I:9102;855;But if you're a real movie afficianado, you'll find this flick's messages are so overt that it's almost hard to be entertained by the story.
I:9102;856;Film was just as good as it was the first time.
I:9102;857;This is a powerful movie that deserves all the respect it has gained.
I:9102;858;It's not at all a preachy story of a changed man, rather it is an intense portrait of a family hit by race issues, and the stuggles of each family member to come to terms with reality and find their own personal belief system.
I:9102;859;this is an amazing movie about racist ideals and family ties.
I:9102;860;This is most definetly of the best movies of this genre I've ever seen.
I:9102;861;Excelent performance by Edward Norton.
I:9102;862;Great extra features, and good clean picture, and sharp sound.
I:9102;863;"I remember very clearly when ""American History X"" was all the rage, and every guy with a trench coat or a goatee thought it was the best movie ever made."
I:9102;864;I have to say, though, this is actually a pretty realistic film of what can transform an average, or intensely bright person from being disgruntled and alienated into full racist scumbag.
I:9102;865;"The predator, played despicably well by Stacy Keach, calls himself ""Cameron"" and just like a pedophile, he waits for white kids who feel pushed around by minorities to feel empowered with Nazi ideology."
I:9102;866;"For a time, Derek sees him as his surrogate father and is willing to do his bidding anywhere
I:9102;867;"Anyone who has known a true skinhead or Neo Nazi is aware that they can encounter nice minorities anywhere and chat with them
I:9102;868;And it happens so quick with Derek.
I:9102;869;"This isn't the ""most enlightening movie"" I've ever seen, but it has superb acting and direction and is absolutely a memorable film."
I:9102;870;This movie should be required viewing for high school students.
I:9102;871;All of the actors were excellent.
I:9102;872;He had a right to protect his family, so the idea of him going to prison for protecting his family from ARMED GANG MEMEBERS is ludicrous, but it shows really how decayed the justice system in America is.
I:9102;873;Daniel's perspective is often true, especially during the dinner scene, where he speaks of Rodney King.
I:9102;874;That alone puts it over the top.
I:9102;875;There were graphic scenes, yes, but I do believe that it's part and parcel of the message that is being sent.
I:9102;876;This movie did not end at all how I thought it would, and I was shocked to find myself moved to tears.
I:9102;877;This will twist your emotions in knots.
I:9102;878;"But ""X"" owes its extraordinary power to the super."
I:9102;879;"With Norton so convincing in balancing Derek's obvious intelligence and charisma with his more noxious Nazi persona, ""American History X"" is a raw, engrossing tale of a pained conscience turned inside out."
I:9102;880;This movie will leave you thinking, it will leave you stunned, and if you are a Neo.
I:9102;881;nazi it will make you think twice about being in that crowd, This was without a doubt the best film of 1998.
I:9102;882;I highly recommend this masterpiece.
I:9102;883;This movie is very vivid in showing how skinheads are.
I:9102;884;This movie may make you feel uncomfortable at some parts but I highly reccomend it!
I:9102;885;It's amazing that truly great acting does not get rewarded at the Oscars (nothing but politics)!
I:9102;886;The way he trys to save his little brother, by telling him what happen to him in jail is very moving.
I:9102;887;If you are looking for a very moving picture to watch look no further.
I:9102;888;I know if you watch it you will feel that way to.
I:9102;889;Insightful, powerful and best of all: unbowed to the ever.
I:9102;890;This is a movie that is able to show a portion of the raw realities of race and racial relations and yet leave a message about how damaging hate can be without being preachy.
I:9102;891;Norton was good in Primal Fear, but this is how I will remember him: powerful, passionate and eloquent.
I:9102;892;And the movie did just the right thing.
I:9102;893;Letting the audience perceive it the way each and everyone could see it.10/10
I:9102;894;I just recently saw the movie and i thought it was absolutely great.
I:9102;895;the movie is really well laid out and has a clever way of showing when an event is in the past,they make that certain scenes black and white.
I:9102;896;i really think Edward Norton plays his part really well.
I:9102;897;The movie also has funny lines,and theres vocabulary that youll wanna say outloud right after.
I:9102;898;well this movie was one of my favorites,i hope you see it and you like it.
I:9102;899;American History X. is a great movie, great acting and perfect cast.
I:9102;900;This is a movie that will keep you in your seat, because of the way it flows it does not concentrate on one specific event but on a transformation of a human being.
I:9102;901;Danny, the younger brother of Derek, tells the story.
I:9102;902;This has a good effect in the film, because his brother has convinced him that hatred is good.
I:9102;903;(A) A liberating piece of film making which deals with some important social issues in our society today or (B) a piece of (.)
I:9102;904;"American History X may be violent (the film is rated R for Graphic Brutal Violence Including Rape, Pervasive Language and Strong Sexuality and Nudity) but despite the reasons for it's R rating and despite the violence used to portray waht point they are trying to get across
I:9102;905;Edward Norton scored his second Oscar nomination for the film, rightly so, as Derek Vinyard.
I:9102;906;"The ending is sad and great
I:9102;907;"Norton is brilliant in his role
I:9102;908;Furlong is good, but wasn't the greatest choice to play Danny in my oppinion.
I:9102;909;"I'm not saying this one of my favorite movies or even that it's one of the best films ever made
I:9102;910;American History X was such a powerful movie, I'm still reeling from its emotional, psychological, and personal impact.
I:9102;911;This is one of the best handlings of the issue of racism I've ever seen.
I:9102;912;Edward Norton's portrayal of Derek Vinyard definitely struck a nerve.
I:9102;913;This film is truly superb and gives a strong message past the obvious but poignant observations about the neo.
I:9102;914;Also, this film is one of the only films in history to give a realistic depiction of and give events that would actually lead to someone with deep.
I:9102;915;American history should make every person delve within themselves for their true feeling about various social issues.
I:9102;916;Wonderful acting on behalf of the cast.
I:9102;917;This is one of my all time favorite movies.
I:9102;918;It's a very powerful story and Edward Norton's acting is outstanding.
I:9102;919;American History X is a MUST see.
I:9102;920;This film is very graphic, griping, and will open your eyes to some of the causes of hate that is flourishing in this world.
I:9102;921;Edward Norton gives a stellar performance and you can FEEL his rage, his hate.
I:9102;922;His time in jail allows him to transform his hate into compassion and love and it is ironic how this is actually accomplished.
I:9102;923;"In fact, all of the actors were excellent in that you could ""feel"" what they were going through as well."
I:9102;924;The location: Venice Beach, California, a neighborhood that was once white suburbia, but is now plagued with gangs.
I:9102;925;sweet success tinged with irony.
I:9102;926;the story, from the aggressive start to the shocking, emotional ending, is powerful, universal, and timeless.
I:9102;927;But the movie is propelled to a whole other level with the outstanding performance of Edward Norton.
I:9102;928;The following few minutes are pure film, with the exception of police commands in the background.
I:9102;929;Nortons portrayal is so powerful because he appears to literally become Derek, never once stepping out of character.
I:9102;930;along with Nortons superb performance, the movie has multiple other noteworthy actors.
I:9102;931;His voice cracks with emotion and his eyes brim with tears, as he effectively portrays Dannys newly discovered innocense.
I:9102;932;of the smaller roles, Guy Torry, who plays Dereks black friend in jail, and has much to do with his new mindset, gives a notable performance.
I:9102;933;Torry provides comedy, making the difficult plot a little easier to swallow.
I:9102;934;but besides the outstanding acting and superb plot, there is also spectacular cinematography, which can be attributed to director and cinematographer Tony Kaye.
I:9102;935;Besides creating very aesthetically pleasing visuals through the constant switching of colors, the black and white and color scenes add a very distinct mood to the movie.
I:9102;936;The color conveys a sense of optimism, despite the movies ironic twist of an ending.
I:9102;937;American History X is a timeless movie, one that seemed all too appropriate when it first came out, not long after the death of Mathew Shepard, and one, that sadly, seems all too appropriate now, amidst the hatred and the war.
I:9102;938;I will steal the ending lines of the movie, for as Danny says, someone has already said it best.
I:9102;939;But when tackling this extremely heavy subject matter, one should be prepared to do their homework.
I:9102;940;American History X is a most memorable movie.
I:9102;941;Edward Norton delivers an unforgettable performance.
I:9102;942;This movie will snap you back to reality.
I:9102;943;Equally excellent is Edward Furlong, who portrays Derek's younger brother.
I:9102;944;The interplay between the actors is impressive and moving, and this brotherly connection is what ultimately makes this movie work as well as it does.
I:9102;945;the American media today is saturated with (mostly international, anti.
I:9102;946;This film provides a realistic portrayal of what extremism and bigotry can do when set loose on the streets of America.
I:9102;947;This film is very well done.
I:9102;948;Although a fictional story, it gives us an honest and realistic perspective on racism's end.
I:9102;949;Norton was phenomenal as was the whole cast.
I:9102;950;Good writing and directing too.
I:9102;951;It was a tad intense at times here and there.
I:9102;952;I would totally recommend this movie to all!
I:9102;953;I wrote a review to say how much I loved it.
I:9102;954;However watching again made me realize, it's just right.
I:9102;955;His character is so believable.
I:9102;956;I think its's wonderful, so deep and touching.
I:9102;957;The film has so many levels.
I:9102;958;I wanted the movie, I bought the movie, it came in the mail, and now I own it.
I:9102;959;It was pretty simple and basic.
I:9102;960;Let me preface this by saying that I feel Edward Norton is one of the best actors around.
I:9102;961;so I was bound to like it just because the acting is so good.
I:9102;962;But this is compelling and if you find it interesting to see how other people live, this is a great movie to see.
I:9102;963;Edward Norton's performance in this film is nothing short of brilliant.
I:9102;964;fortunately though, he meets his enemy (the black man) face to face in prison and actually has many conversations with him.
I:9102;965;derek learns a lot about the man and himself.
I:9102;966;I highly reccomend this movie.
I:9102;967;This movie is an all time classic.
I:9102;968;American History X is more of an educational experience than entertainment.
I:9102;969;Every young adult should see it at least once.
I:9102;970;Then I saw him in Red Dragon: Well, he did a good job in Red Dragon but Red Dragon wasn't that good anyway.
I:9102;971;Then I saw him in American History X, and just let me say this, this is his best role ever.
I:9102;972;Edward Norton, Edward Furlong, and the entire cast puts on an outstanding performance.
I:9102;973;This is good because it actually feels like you're seeing a flashback and there's no flashbacks within a flashback either.
I:9102;974;I bought this movie as a gift for my girlfriend(nothing says I love you more than American History X =P)because she as well liked the movie so I figured it would be a good gift.
I:9102;975;Anyways, all I have to say is that it is a good movie focusing on a person who committed a hate crime and tells his tale from beginning to end.
I:9102;976;Ed Norton puts forth his best acting effort yet.
I:9102;977;The whole cast was picked perfectly.
I:9102;978;This movie is a must see!!!!
I:9102;979;The plot is very original and pure Americana.
I:9102;980;the acting is great across the board.
I:9102;981;The story is unique, unpredictable, and entertaining from start to finish.
I:9102;982;check it out if you can handle an intense movie.
I:9102;983;Each time I watched it, each time I marvelled at the intricate character portrayal and intense subject matter of this film.
I:9102;984;If anything, it's an indication of a great movie for me.
I:9102;985;brilliant performances by both 'Edwards' who paired up as credible onscreen siblings.
I:9102;986;To me, every good movie has a story to tell and a message to bring across.
I:9102;987;But for what it's worth and what it trys to achieve out of it, this film deserves our kudos.
I:9102;988;what I feel is most significant about the film personally in terms of its message is this: when you act insensibly in life and end up hurting yourself, you always end up hurting someone else along with you.
I:9102;989;Perhaps another reason why I like this film so much is because of the strong bond between the brothers and the impact each has on the other .
I:9102;990;something which I can relate to.
I:9102;991;Absolutely excellent, Kaye's ( or actually from what I heard Norton's) film is very harsh and at times very violent, yet never for a moment loses its humanity and impartuality.
I:9102;992;The main protagonists themselves, despite their obvious social misunderstandings, are very sympathetic and are likable to the audience.
I:9102;993;Overall the film has a very semi documentary/ Cops type of cinematography which is at times breathtaking.
I:9102;994;i loved it and, i dont really like drama movies, but this movie taught you everything from racism to prejusdice.
I:9102;995;because everytime you see it, it teaches you something new about life, and how your younger brothers and sisters look or looked up to you and how you changed there lives from what YOU did and taught them to do.
I:9102;996;This movie has a very surprising and tragic ending that could move anybody to tears.
I:9102;997;edward norton is a very good actor also faruiza boulk is too.
I:9102;998;I bought it a week after i saw it because it was so beautiful!
I:9102;999;edward Norton's performance was mesmerizing and totally believable.
I:9102;1000;nazi and his character is smart and eloquent enough to make you almost understand why he thinks the way he does.
I:9102;1001;i recommend this movie to anyone who can bear the intensity of the emotions it evokes.
I:9102;1002;this is a fantastic movie but not for everyone.
I:9102;1003;perfect example of where racism stands these days.
I:9102;1004;This is one of my favorite movies of all time.
I:9102;1005;Edward Norton and Edward Furlong give an allstar performance in this chilling tale about the consequences of racism.
I:9102;1006;It is a great movie.
I:9102;1007;this movie is really Gritty and realistic.
I:9102;1008;Sometimes, a single image is enough to make or break a film's advertising, and the theatrical poster for American History X is an example of the latter.
I:9102;1009;nazi contingent on Venice Beach, a tightly organized group with a similar political view to the Pat Robertsons and Fred Niles of this world.
I:9102;1010;americans, and Derek is sent to prison for three years as a result.
I:9102;1011;The plot summation to be found on the back cover is, in fact, surprisingly accurate, even if the story is a little simplistic in terms of detail, with the support cast not being particularly fleshed out.
I:9102;1012;Still, a film with such a story as this one certainly cannot keep up the action without taking some time to explain why the men in the film are kicking, punching, and otherwise assaulting one another.
I:9102;1013;In any case, if you need a film with intelligence to while away two hours with, then American History X is definitely worthy of your consideration
I:9102;1014;This is one of the most thought provoking movie I've seen in a long time.
I:9102;1015;Everybody involved in this film deserves credit.
I:9102;1016;This movie has its heart in the right place, I suppose.
I:9102;1017;This film is a honkey fairy.
I:9102;1018;And you see how he and his brother are dealing with his family.
I:9102;1019;This movie is so great, that I couldnt really describe what I felt after coming out of the cinema(yeah this time it was cinema for a change), I was just stood there, and thought WOW!
I:9102;1020;Edward Norton is amazing as the racist family leader, Derek.
I:9102;1021;He lets you into his character's mind, especially when Derek's in prison.
I:9102;1022;It's really intense in parts but also really sweet and honest.
I:9102;1023;There are some movies that you can watch a lot because they don't stay with you after you turn it off.
I:9102;1024;This was very good and I enjoyed it a lot.
I:9102;1025;I have a deep respect and admiration for Edward Norton.
I:9102;1026;I think he is a fantastic actor.
I:9102;1027;This movie is such a masterpiece about racism that it should be mandatory viewing in high schools.
I:9102;1028;this movie is a masterpiece .
I:9102;1029;"a true ""must see"" movie."
I:9102;1030;This is an excellent movie.
I:9102;1031;A film about learning, a film about life.
I:9102;1032;this is an excellent movie and it is moving as well as disturbing.
I:9102;1033;This is a great movie.
I:9102;1034;My husband wanted to watch it, I wasnt sure if I'd like it but I actually thought it was great.
I:9102;1035;(basic plot) The film is set in a neighbourhood in Venice, LA County, California.
I:9102;1036;I can see why Norton was nominated for an oscar, his performance is chillingly real, and his acting is so convincing that even the most un.
I:9102;1037;Although obviously I'm not saying they're right, of course the whole point is that they aren't, but Norton's acting is persuasive enough to make you question your own opinion, if only (I hope) for the duration of the film.
I:9102;1038;Taken for what it is, the film is pretty negative, but when reading between the lines you will see the positive message that the director intended you to.
I:9102;1039;American History X is powerful, gritty, graphic and absolutely belivable!
I:9102;1040;Both Edward Norton and Edward Furlong are amazing!
I:9102;1041;It's one of those movies that's got to be seen again!
I:9102;1042;The acting, the cinamentography, and the story(the way it was presented with the black and white past and the color present) was so provocative, fantatic, sensational.
I:9102;1043;It is most deffinatly one of my top three movies.
I:9102;1044;acted, surprisingly accurate portrayal of naive but dangerous Neo.
I:9102;1045;The films primary fault lies in the unrealistically easy enlightenment of Derek, the films primary protagonist.
I:9102;1046;But I liked almost everything else about the film.
I:9102;1047;And Edward Norton's performance was great.
I:9102;1048;He is a fine actor who has a natural mastery of difficult roles and made me feel that he actually WAS the skinhead he portrayed.
I:9102;1049;American History X is set in Venice Beach, California, a hotbed of racial tension and it's time that someone finally was willing to deal with this problem in a film.
I:9102;1050;And lots of excellent directing.
I:9102;1051;There are good uses of slow motion and cuts.
I:9102;1052;recommended for the curious, but it is certainly not a great film.
I:9102;1053;This movie definitely explored the effects of racism.
I:9102;1054;This is a great story with a good moral to it.
I:9102;1055;It's one of thoughs storys that moves you.
I:9102;1056;The first time I saw it, it shocked me.
I:9102;1057;The third time, I shook my head and sighed at the fact that people like the characters in this movie .
I:9102;1058;pros of this movie: Excellent acting.
I:9102;1059;"I have a new respect for Ed Norton after this
I:9102;1060;to me, it added to the black vs. white conflict that Derek encountered when.
I:9102;1061;Violence, and lots of it, but it works into the plot, so again, it makes sense.
I:9102;1062;overall, this is a powerful movie that will make you rethink what you thought you knew about racism and how the human mind works.
I:9102;1063;When he returns home after three years, he is a humble, changed man, but still strong.
I:9102;1064;The movie is truly scary when you see the skinheads bonding, brought together by an irrational hate and Derek's ability to gratify it with his fierce oratories.
I:9102;1065;His performance is compelling and real.
I:9102;1066;I sincerely think he is one of Hollywood's most promising actors.
I:9102;1067;Edward Furlong is also powerful, which is shocking for an actor of his age.
I:9102;1068;The script is stunning, likewise the directing and editing.
I:9102;1069;the movie is violent and brutal, almost disturbingly so, but it is critical to underscore the power of the story.
I:9102;1070;up people can rise above the pettiness of hate.
I:9102;1071;One of the most powerful scenes in the movie is when Derek and Danny pull down all the Nazi crap on his bedroom wall.
I:9102;1072;this movie is intense, as well.
I:9102;1073;But at the same time it's a remarkably powerful story with first.
I:9102;1074;rate acting and a powerful message.
I:9102;1075;Ed Norton does a wonderful job of portraying the rage and confusion so many racist skinheads have.
I:9102;1076;I highly recommend the movie.
I:9102;1077;AMERICAN HISTORY X is a film that definitely makes you think.
I:9102;1078;edward Norton does a phenomenal job as playing a kid, Derrick Vinyad growing up against all odds being thrown at him and going through the judicial system .
I:9102;1079;the photography is cleverly don the best part about the film is the kid playing Edwards brother, played by Edward Furlong, gives an incredible performance right until the end.
I:9102;1080;but the emotional impact is very real.
I:9102;1081;this is a good film, but certainly not for kids under high school age .
I:9102;1082;Some parts are hard to watch but well worth the message.
I:9102;1083;I saw the movie years ago but bought it so that I could watch it with my 18 year old son.
I:9102;1084;He is tough because he has to be .
I:9102;1085;Oo my goodness, the movie american history x was sooooo good!
I:9102;1086;That movie was deep!but it's a good story and I am hearing take to Review its I like it!
I:9102;1087;Walk in someone else's skin.
I:9102;1088;Let kids see the big picture as individual stories (which of course they are) and it will open them up to truth.
I:9102;1089;I never saw a movie with Edward Norton in it, but this definetly is one of my favorites.
I:9102;1090;The message at the end is unbelieveable and so true too.
I:9102;1091;This is one of my all time favorites now, and I want a movie poster even though I have nowhere to put it.
I:9102;1092;It's about fear, thoughtfulness, caring, love, and deep emotions.
I:9102;1093;This movie is educational, entertaining, controversial and above all, very well acted.
I:9102;1094;Edward Norton gives a great performance as a turned skinhead who does what he can to un.
I:9102;1095;excellent movie, I really like the message of tolerance that renders the film.
I:9102;1096;very good performance of the main characters
I:9102;1097;While I believe that the transformation of Norton's character was a bit shallow,I still give this movie 5 stars for portraying the reality in America, his speeches were amazing and it really makes you think about the way a lot of people think.
I:9102;1098;His speeches are so powerful that he makes you think he IS right.
I:9102;1099;I highly recommend this movie.
I:9102;1100;The movie immediately grabbed my atttention so I eventually ordered the movie so I could watch the entire thing.
I:9102;1101;I do now consider this a movie that is one on my top list to watch and own.
I:9102;1102;I highly recommend this movie to everyone!
I:9102;1103;Great acting and a great story.
I:9102;1104;I hope everyone else can enjoy the movie as much as I did.
I:9102;1105;Edward Norton does a great job acting though.
I:9102;1106;I'd say it's his second best compared to Fight Club.
I:9102;1107;Something to learn from for anybody, the right cast, excellent direction, a very strong story that will touch your heart and conscience.
I:9102;1108;What it does deal with are real concerns of white Americans and it presents a great deal of the basic argument of White Nationalists.
I:9102;1109;It does leave, however, the viewer with a strong impression of the problems America faces because of illegals.
I:9102;1110;The movie also serves to reinforce many racialist ideas.
I:9102;1111;This movie is incredible in telling the tale of one man's realization that the racism he adopted just gave him more problems.
I:9102;1112;The actors in this film played their parts brilliantly.
I:9102;1113;Special kudos to Edward Norton who played the role of Derek Vinyard with a chilling power and charisma.
I:9102;1114;Definitely one of my favorite actors.
I:9102;1115;It is a powerful, complex indictment of the destruction that hate causes to society, one's family, and one's self.
I:9102;1116;Watch it with an open, honest mind.
I:9102;1117;And at the same time it is a heartbreaking movie.
I:9102;1118;This movie was a great movie.
I:9102;1119;My dad and I watched it together and my dad was shocked on how realistic this movie was.
I:9102;1120;this movie is the best movie to use to teach kids about hatered and how it destroys instead of constructing.
I:9102;1121;"This movie was very, very true to life
I:9102;1122;"as it is visually true to life with the wording the characters use plus the actions that the characters performed
I:9102;1123;Stunningly powerful movie which left me and my friends in a state of quiet and thoughtful contemplation even as the titles were concluding.
I:9102;1124;A cautionary tale I guess set in Venice Beach,California about hate and prejudice.
I:9102;1125;he is unremorseful at first but eventually finds his epiphany within the stark reality of the prison walls.
I:9102;1126;i especially liked the flashbacks in black white.
I:9102;1127;an often used device which works well here,as does the quote by Abraham Lincoln towards the end, .
I:9102;1128;one of my top ten for this last decade of the millenium and well deserved.
I:9102;1129;It has been many years since I have seen this film.
I:9102;1130;Much of the story is told in a flash backed black and white.
I:9102;1131;this is a powerful, moving film.
I:9102;1132;It works best when it shoots for an emotional response, rather than an intellectual one.
I:9102;1133;nazi skinheads, and this type of discussion can be found every other day on day time talk shows.
I:9102;1134;there are two powerful performances from Edward Norton and Edward Furlong.
I:9102;1135;Furlong who once made Arnold Schwarzenegger look like Laurence Olivier with such a wooden performance, here has finally made himself worthy of attention.
I:9102;1136;He gives a fine performance here, as a young man struggling with the passionate feelings of youth.
I:9102;1137;tackling an issue as heady as racism in America is a worthy, yet difficult cause.
I:9102;1138;This is a powerful, well made film.
I:9102;1139;There is plenty to chew upon and discuss.
I:9102;1140;It is, in fact, a good film to watch with others and bring into light an important debate.
I:9102;1141;Edward Norton could probably play anyone, he is one of the best actors out there.
I:9102;1142;This movie is very powerful and the performances are just incredible.
I:9102;1143;I highly reccomend you see it.
I:9102;1144;It's a little disturbing at times, but it's very moving.
I:9102;1145;American History X takes its place among a handful of films that dare to address difficult subjects without any sugarcoating or watering down.
I:9102;1146;In our modern age, what's most important it that it was made and is available for anyone who chooses to see it.
I:9102;1147;it is simply done, yet exquisite in its deliberate use of both black and white and color.
I:9102;1148;The world is far more complex than black, white and shades of gray can capture.
I:9102;1149;it is the story of an average American boy named Derek [Edward Norton in his Oscar nominated performance] who turns into a neo.
I:9102;1150;How this decision affects the lives of his younger brother Danny [Edward Furlong in his best role] and the rest of his family, not to mention the lives of others around him, is the focus of the movie.
I:9102;1151;edward Norton truly deserved his Oscar nomination for Best Actor.
I:9102;1152;every part of this movie rang true to me .
I:9102;1153;class family struggling to survive, the love between brothers, the scenes in prison.
I:9102;1154;Even the somewhat cruel ending makes perfect sense if you stop and really think about the beginning of the movie.
I:9102;1155;anne Dudley contributed here one of the finest music scores for a movie in 1998.
I:9102;1156;it provokes thought about human relations while entertaining at the same time.
I:9102;1157;There are exciting and persuasive arguments all through the movie.
I:9102;1158;try it out, it is the best movie I've seen in a while.
I:9102;1159;Also Edward Furlong acting is good and the story in this movie is very good and very intense.
I:9102;1160;The end of the movie was surprising and very shocking.
I:9102;1161;He returns home and sees things mostly the way they were, with the exception of his brother.
I:9102;1162;the rest of the movie shows Derek work to resolve the issues he had, while also trying to protect his family from the people he once knew and called friends.
I:9102;1163;strong performances from Edward Norton (who became a frightening manifestation of hate, later on, a changed man), Edward Furlong (much improved from his Terminator 2 debut), Avery Brooks (excellent as always in authoritarian roles) coupled with sharp cinematography and a powerful message make this movie essential in any mature film owner's collection.
I:9102;1164;As it is I can't help but feel that the director/studio wasted a great opportunity with one of the best and most fearless young actors in movies.
I:9102;1165;my brother love this movie and he cant stop watch it he love this moive and I happy I could but it for him
I:9102;1166;I think the best thing that American History X has going for it is that it makes you care about what happens to its characters, Neo.
I:9102;1167;nazi brothers Derek (played by Norton) and Danny (played by Furlong).
I:9102;1168;the actors and screenwriters of American History X let you into the minds and pasts of these two brothers.
I:9102;1169;You cringe at the actions of Derek, but (and this is a big compliment to Edward Norton) you can see the emotions and, even if for only a moment, some threads of logical thought and credibility behind his philosophies.
I:9102;1170;and you feel his pain when his jail time is up and he returns to a broken family.
I:9102;1171;Even the cinematography is striking (note the panoramic view of the beach shadowed by red clouds at the beginning, the flashbacks in black and white).
I:9102;1172;It almost makes me want to be an English teacher for a while so that I can make it required viewing for a growing class of angry, alienated American teens.
I:9102;1173;I believe every high school civics class should have this film as part of it's curriculim.
I:9102;1174;This powerful, at times gruesomely realistic movie paints racism and hate in a modern and true way.
I:9102;1175;It paints a real picture of the neo.
I:9102;1176;The same things that brings gangbangers to their own groups.
I:9102;1177;A must see for any kid attending high school in America today.
I:9102;1178;I think this movie is great.
I:9102;1179;Not only it is a great film with exciting moments and unforgettable feelings, but it also gives a very interesting point of view over the problem of racism.
I:9102;1180;norton truley gives an outstanding performance, looking buff and mean with a swastika on his chest, norton should have gotten that oscar and furlong really redeems himself in this film and everyone else in the film gave great performences.
I:9102;1181;friends a black man and uncovers the truth about his racist ways.
I:9102;1182;great film and if i were haggis, he should of modeled after this film.
I:9102;1183;He makes every effort to impart in him all he has learned while in prison.
I:9102;1184;stark and harshly real, American History X makes a political and social statement about the world we live in.
I:9102;1185;This film was very well.
I:9102;1186;I loved how the most poignant scenes of the movie were shown in black and white, stripping down all of the polish and getting to the harshness of it all.
I:9102;1187;Some of what you see will stun you and some will appall you, but be that as it may, this is a very realistic film dealing with a very realistic problem in America.
I:9102;1188;Great acting by Edward Norton as the angry and anguished Derek.
I:9102;1189;Equally good work by Edward Furlong as Danny and Stacey Keach as Cameron.
I:9102;1190;Still love the movie but i wanted in in widescreen for a reason.
I:9102;1191;Edward Norton is such an amazing actor!
I:9102;1192;I will see ALL of his films!
I:9102;1193;The messages it sends are horrific yet revealing about the real world.
I:9102;1194;I will watch this movie more than twice to complelely digest the story as I do with all my movies.
I:9102;1195;Yet I found myself gripped to the screen throughout.
I:9102;1196;"particular acolades should go to Edward Norton, who also performed so brilliantly in ""Primal Fear""."
I:9102;1197;One is reminded that compassion, love, and above all, reaching out to others, even when those people may hate you, forms the cornerstone of eliminating racism and bigotry from our societyI also loved the cinematic use of black.
I:9102;1198;The cinematography was incredible, and one cannot watch this movie without feeling a strong emotional reaction.
I:9102;1199;Some may hate this movie because of its obvious liberal overtones, but that is part of the shear brilliance of this incredible work.
I:9102;1200;No matter who you are, you will NOT watch this movie without having a strong emotional reaction to it!
I:9102;1201;This is one of the best films I have ever seen.
I:9102;1202;This is one of the visceral movies ever made, on the same level as Schindler's List.
I:9102;1203;All in all, a difficult film to watch, but ultimately rewarding in the end, something few movies released today can say.
I:9102;1204;American History X comes out as a film that will stick with you after watching it with it's great performances, great writing, and some very well thought out and realized characters, yet one can't but feel it missed the mark on a couple things that could have made the film more than what it is.
I:9102;1205;to start off, the performance by Edward Norton is what really carries the movie by playing as Derek, a neo.
I:9102;1206;norton and his character really shine by despite being a man filled with irrational and misdirected hate he is able to bring up numerous great arguments and points, making him into an obviously intelligent person and less of a simple racist stereotype.
I:9102;1207;like many great movies, this one has many scenes be made into wonderfully tense and powerful.
I:9102;1208;Often tense without the use of violence or something to that effect, just tense with the use of great writing and performances from the characters where the hostility towards one another could be cut with a knife.
I:9102;1209;i strongly recommend this movie as more of an emotional then intellectual look at modern racism in America.
I:9102;1210;great acting from everyone and a great story, definately worth having.
I:9102;1211;Edward Norton gives an incredible performance as Derek Vinyard, a neo.
I:9102;1212;This is a beautifully photographed and wonderfully written movie that takes a very strong subject, and forms it all into a truly unique film.
I:9102;1213;He has such as tremendous range as an actor that it so difficult that he also played a neurotic New Yorker in Woody Allen's Everyone Says I Love You.
I:9102;1214;up physique, shaved head, and goatee all make him look incredibly realistic as a Los Angeles skinhead (and worried some that skinheads would become chic).
I:9102;1215;His performance is incredible, as are the standout supporting performances from Avery Brooks as the black teacher who believes in both Derek and Danny, and Stacy Keach (who seems determined to break his image as Mike Hammer) as the head white supremacist in town.
I:9102;1216;time feature director Tony Kaye (who also served as cinematographer) directs and photographs this film beautifully, and Anne Dudley's score is one to remember.
I:9102;1217;This film is quite possibly one of the most powerful films released as a major film release.
I:9102;1218;Edward Norton's domination of the screen enables him as one of the premier character actors today.
I:9102;1219;The darkness of the content is splatted with images of intense light and clarity which make the ideological struggle in the plot that much more intimidating.
I:9102;1220;Anyone interested in the deconstruction of hateful thought and its roots should take this film's message into consideration.
I:9102;1221;Then a friend insisted that I watch the rest, then I got it.
I:9102;1222;I found this film to be incredible poignant.
I:9102;1223;This film would have been the best picture in other year.
I:9102;1224;i wasn't too keen on watching this film based on its premise, but it is truly one of the best films I've ever seen.
I:9102;1225;The film levels the playing field quite admirably.
I:9102;1226;Sweeney, reflecting on his own youth, sheds light on reverse.
I:9102;1227;Both Edwards (Norton and Furlong) deliver intensely real performances.
I:9102;1228;i highly recommend this film, Ed Norton is great.
I:9102;1229;This is a great movie, don't get me wrong.
I:9102;1230;It was well written and the cast was exceptional.
I:9102;1231;This is one of the greatest movies of all time!
I:9102;1232;Great value for money, and it looks incredible on Blu Ray!
I:9102;1233;It tured out to be one of the best movies that i have ever seen.
I:9102;1234;It was a magnificent movie.
I:9102;1235;He was flawless in this movie.
I:9102;1236;This movie was a masterpiece to say the least and i hold it in high regards.
I:9102;1237;I highly recomend this movie.
I:9102;1238;This is the quintessential movie about race relations in the United States.
I:9102;1239;A stark portrayal of neo.
I:9102;1240;What sets this movie apart is its ability to give the audience a critical insight into the thought process of white supremacists.
I:9102;1241;It is amazing that a movie so simplistic can have such a powerful emotional effect.
I:9102;1242;At best, this film reminded me more of a watered down, made for tv movie.
I:9102;1243;Don't get me wrong, Ed Norton was wonderful ( but Oscar nomination?)
I:9102;1244;, and ed Furlong as the mimicking brother was good as well.
I:9102;1245;Now it is up to Derek to save his brother and teach him the true meaning of redemption.
I:9102;1246;American History X is one of the best films that I have ever seen.
I:9102;1247;The story is amazing, all the actors are outstanding, and the script provides for shocking scenes and great dialogue overall.
I:9102;1248;Watching the film unfold will leave you in awe.
I:9102;1249;The parts dealing with Derek's past are shot in black and white to give them more of an ominous appeal.
I:9102;1250;The present is shot in color to give the appearance of hope.
I:9102;1251;He plays both sides of the character great.
I:9102;1252;He is very convincing as a skinhead, and after prison shows that redemption is possible.
I:9102;1253;Edward Furlong in my opinion did the best job in the movie.
I:9102;1254;Furlong supplies extremely realistic emotion to let the audience know the inner conflict that his character is dealing with.
I:9102;1255;It has shocking scenes and a realistic look at racism.
I:9102;1256;But the story and characters are emotionally driven, and Derek's fight towards retribution is inspriring!
I:9102;1257;It is an entertaining film, but an important one as well.
I:9102;1258;Turned out to be a very captivating story with a powerful message.
I:9102;1259;Both my husband and I thought it did a great job of exploring a very unfortunate subculture of our country.
I:9102;1260;An incredible look into the mind of Derek Vinyard(a skin head) and his little brother Danny Vinyard(a up coming skin head).
I:9102;1261;This is an amazing work on the foundations of racism in America and how a family overcomes it.
I:9102;1262;I have to say this is the best movie i have ever watched.
I:9102;1263;What i like about American History X is that its very detailed and that it catches your eye right from the beginning.
I:9102;1264;Its a very bruatal movie but also can be a lesson learning movie about racism.
I:9102;1265;I finally got around to seeing American History X tonight after hearing much good hype and it was a great film dealing with ugly issues.
I:9102;1266;Edward Furlong, better known as the whiny kid who played John Connor in Terminator 2: Judgement Day, is surprisingly very good here as well.
I:9102;1267;"People of all races should see this realistic film dealing with the ""stuff"" few like to discuss in public, but can still be seen throughout the world."
I:9102;1268;one of the all time great movies.
I:9102;1269;I do think this is a brilliant film and an extraordinary performance by edward norton, i also do agree with some reviews about the mixed feelings.
I:9102;1270;I know it's a movie and it's suppose to be sensationalized.
I:9102;1271;Despite it's flaws it's still a very good film that people can learn from.
I:9102;1272;Whenever i hear this movie being mentioned, i always hear how hard it has hit it's viewers and the strong ,message that it has, which defeats the little flaws it has, it's still a great filmAs for the murder scene.
I:9102;1273;It takes an incredibly difficult premise and manages to make it credible, evocative and tragic.
I:9102;1274;The movie takes a look at Norton's time in prison, his return and his effect on those around him.
I:9102;1275;thanks to Edward Norton's brave, compelling performance, the audience is really dragged into his emotional turmoil.
I:9102;1276;His performance is unflinching, refusing to cop out and go for the sympathetic vote.
I:9102;1277;He's backed up by strong performances from Edward Furlong (the kid from 'Terminator 2') and Fairuza Balk (a much underrated actress whose formidable acting ability is yet again proved here) as his girlfriend.
I:9102;1278;this is a movie that has several levels to it.
I:9102;1279;It's touching, horrific and serves up some troubling issues about the society that we live in.
I:9102;1280;'American History X' is a movie that everyone should see, and is one of only two movies (the other being 'Heavenly Creatures') that affected me to great depth.
I:9102;1281;Its amazing how a movie as astonishing as this one was never on the big screen.
I:9102;1282;The casting was impressive also.
I:9102;1283;my friend is the one who introduced me to this classic.
I:9102;1284;after I seen it, and seen the ending, I was shocked, amazed, and moved.
I:9102;1285;This movie has a strong message and in my opinion should be seen by anyone in high school.
I:9102;1286;what makes this classic so great is the fact it is close to reality.
I:9102;1287;You can actually relate this movie to real life events.
I:9102;1288;Trust me its worth the money.
I:9102;1289;But I did feel emotion after watching the film.
I:9102;1290;This film is extremely realistic and it makes you think about the society we live in today and how messed up it is, but on the side to that the film teaches a very valuable lesson.
I:9102;1291;my point is this, the movie examines both sides of the issue, with a great deal of irony.
I:9102;1292;American History X is a brilliant film that should not be overlooked.
I:9102;1293;Edward Norton gives an extraordinarily brilliant (and Oscar nominated) performance as Derek Vinyard, a neo.
I:9102;1294;nazi skinhead in this explosive and powerful drama about two brothers caught up in a cycle of racial hatred and violence.
I:9102;1295;brilliantly written by David Mc.
I:9102;1296;notch performances from both its male leads (ably supported by Avery Brooks and Stacy Keach) American History X is an intelligent and powerful examination of the causes and existence of racial bigotry and hatred.
I:9102;1297;Controversial because of its frank portrayal of rascists as human beings, the scariest part of watching American History X is how credible and believable Edward Norton's rascists arguments (as the charismatic leader Derek Vinyard) can be and how easy it must be for impressionable youth to be drawn into a world of hatred and violence.
I:9102;1298;This is as much education as entertainment and essential viewing for fans of intelligent drama.
I:9102;1299;certainly made this film interesting to watch.
I:9102;1300;Just stay quiet and all will be well, is that it?
I:9102;1301;hero derek through his eloquent monologues.
I:9102;1302;fitting score and some of the more stylised shots that would look more at home in an old spice advert and just emerse yourself in one of the most chilling films of recent times.
I:9102;1303;This is an incredible film with searing performances and frighteningly real portraits of a family torn apart by violence and hate.
I:9102;1304;Stacy Keach delivers a chilling performance as Cameron the driving force behind the motion.
I:9102;1305;"Even though it was really hard for me to watch this film given its content, I have to say that ""American History X"" is definitely a film worth seeing."
I:9102;1306;I understand that not all movies can be nice and comfortable, and this movie proves that.
I:9102;1307;edward Norton was incredible in his role as a reformed Nazi skinhead.
I:9102;1308;And Karma is a bitch!
I:9102;1309;well when i first saw this movie, i could not believe how good of a movie it was.
I:9102;1310;This movie is such a great message to everyone, its a great movie to watch.
I:9102;1311;this movie is the far the most best movie that i've ever saw.
I:9102;1312;I did appreciate the film at home.
I:9102;1313;rousing rhetoric an' intelligence of Edward Norton's character Derek, makes for a damn compelling watch.
I:9102;1314;this probably is one'a the best an' more important films of its year.
I:9102;1315;It's beautifully shot, intriguing an' definitely thought.
I:9102;1316;He was one'a my favorite actors before this based on his should'a. won.
I:9102;1317;"Is' a disturbing scene but nothing is more striking and horrifying than the sequence when the police arrive
I:9102;1318;These early scenes as well as the ending, are some'a the most compelling pieces of filmmaking I've seen in a long time.
I:9102;1319;The newfound sense of humanity and compassion for human life has finally brought out the shame in him.
I:9102;1320;As he stares, he places his right hand over his heart, covering up the swastika.
I:9102;1321;In spite of its shortcomings, this is a good and powerful film that MUST be seen and understood.
I:9102;1322;i think that this movie is amazing, because attack the hypocresysice of the deepest and show us the real american feeling about the judes and the nigers.
I:9102;1323;One of the most powerful films to come along in quite some time, American History X would not have achieved such greatness were it not for the performance of Edward Norton.
I:9102;1324;Furlong gives the best performance of his career, and he deserved much more acclaim for his performance than he received.
I:9102;1325;"nazi mentor, and Avery Brooks as Derek's former teacher
I:9102;1326;All in all, American History X is one of the most powerful films to come along in quite some time, and it is carried on the shoulders of Norton's brilliant performance.
I:9102;1327;The ending of the film is both tragic and ironic, and will haunt you for days after viewing.
I:9102;1328;Edward Norton and Edward Furlong are incredible actors.
I:9102;1329;The events in the story could be true to life makes it scary.
I:9102;1330;American history X really helped to show me how much of a great actor Edward Nortan is.
I:9102;1331;From start to finish, he gives a strong performance with Edward Furlong about two troubled young men.
I:9102;1332;it had been almost 10 years since I last saw this movie, and it is still one of my favorites.
I:9102;1333;Awesome, powerful movie about hate and how it can rip apart a society.
I:9102;1334;Norton gives an jaw dropping performance about a Neo Nazi that changes his hating ways after a prison education.
I:9102;1335;and create the good and virtuous.
I:9102;1336;That quote is what Oliver Stone believes good art should be, if it is to be classified as good art.
I:9102;1337;The movie American History X is very complex and intricate.
I:9102;1338;I feel that it is indeed an example of good art.
I:9102;1339;The film also goes on to create the good.
I:9102;1340;I found it quite interesting to see some of the signs of this transition.
I:9102;1341;American History X, I believe, clearly works to create.
I:9102;1342;"and create the good and virtuous."""
I:9102;1343;"This was the beginning of it all and when Derek's dad was killed by a person which he was told ""to be careful"" about, this helped to spawn it even more."
I:9102;1344;I hold American History X to be an act of resistance and a piece of good art for in my opinion it clearly meets Stone's criteria for this.
I:9102;1345;It aims to create the good and virtuous by showing Derek and Danny's new understanding of people towards the end of the film.
I:9102;1346;If this film were shown to people that are racist in someway it could help them greatly, and I believe that is a very important feature of this film as well, all the more making it good art in my opinion.
I:9102;1347;I believe it adheres to Stone's principles very strongly and I also believe that more films should be like this one: good.
I:9102;1348;Okay this is well documented about the director's unorthodox antics, with the studio.
I:9102;1349;in my opinion he walked away from a daring film, not seen since the likes of 'A Clockwork Orange'.
I:9102;1350;This is one of those rare films shock and compell youat the same time.
I:9102;1351;I think this movie is one of the best ever made and is a must see.
I:9102;1352;Beautiful performances by Edward Norton and Edward Furlong.
I:9102;1353;The best Movie I have ever seen next to the godfather.
I:9102;1354;That's a very important aspect of this film.
I:9102;1355;"That aside, I loved ""American History X"""
I:9102;1356;I spoke to a friend of mine in 2001 and he told me that it was good so I looked at him like he was crazy.
I:9102;1357;I decided to see it in 2005 and was blown away by how good it was.
I:9102;1358;plot/spoiler: Derek Vinyard(Edward Norton) is a well.
I:9102;1359;opinion: This is the best movie of 1998 and I'll go out on a limb and say that this is one of the most important films in history.
I:9102;1360;Beverly D'Angelo is in top form as the mother who has to put up with the pain her son causes with his racism.
I:9102;1361;Avery Brooks is great as Dr. Sweeney and Guy Torry is his usual goofy but funny self as Lamont.
I:9102;1362;written and well acted without coming off as pretentious.
I:9102;1363;You really believed that those characters thought that way.
I:9102;1364;This movie will stand out as one of the best things to come out of modern cinema.
I:9102;1365;"The Bottom Line:American History X is a terrific film
I:9102;1366;This is an excellent movie .
I:9102;1367;With a stellar performance from Edward Norton, we get to see a positive change in learned human nature through a trying personal experience.
I:9102;1368;This movie will give you goosebumps to see the transformation of Derek Vinyard and how it impacts his brother Danny, how they learn to accept others, and let go of the hate and anger in their hearts.
I:9102;1369;American History X stands on its own as a great piece of powerhouse performing by all the cast involved, including .
I:9102;1370;Yes, it is hard to believe at times and certainly there is a lot to spoon down in that department, but overall the film is certainly very good and plays out well even if the story is a bit contrived at times, however you will LOVE the cinematography that Kaye produces on the screen and this film does indeed look lush in its color, black and white, slow motion sequences.
I:9102;1371;definitely a picture worth looking at .
I:9102;1372;American History X is a brilliant film.
I:9102;1373;Norton Should have won the Oscar.
I:9102;1374;Some of the gangster types (both skinhead and black) are rather simple, but this fits with there characters.
I:9102;1375;This movie is so powerful and great.
I:9102;1376;After I saw it for the first time I immediately decided it is one of the best movies I've ever seen.
I:9102;1377;Edward Norton is one of the best actors in the world and is very underrated but I sort of like it that way.
I:9102;1378;He's one of my personal favourites.
I:9102;1379;Just an extremely well done movie and anyone who hasn't seen it should.
I:9102;1380;This is a great movie in every way you could want in to be.
I:9102;1381;The acting was incredible, but we knew Edward Norton had a gift.
I:9102;1382;He is one of my favorite actors.
I:9102;1383;The story prior to his arrest builds dramatically until the murders.
I:9102;1384;He shows the dominant personality and aggressiveness needed to make the film realistic.
I:9102;1385;This movie shows that anyone can change their ways, but your actions and what you do, does not affect just you but your friends and family as well.
I:9102;1386;done film with redeeming qualities, though it takes a while to get there.
I:9102;1387;Seemed quite realistic, appreciated the change in Norton from staunch racist to a decent human being, all because of the humanity and unlikely friendship of a fellow prisoner.
I:9102;1388;love this movie, looks amazing on blu.
I:9102;1389;ray and the audio is outstanding, if you love this movie enjoy it on blu.
I:9102;1390;It helped start him asking questions and an insightful dialogue on social issues.
I:9102;1391;Ed Norton's performance pulls you into the many emotions in this movie.
I:9102;1392;One of the most powerful and disturbing movies you'll ever see.
I:9102;1393;see for everyone at least once in their lifetime.
I:9102;1394;And I have always been a fan of Edward Norton.
I:9102;1395;He is an influential member of the skinheads.
I:9102;1396;first of all, I have to say bravo to the writers and the film makers for making such a bold movie.
I:9102;1397;That is how profound the dialogue is.
I:9102;1398;Derek delivers some of the best lines in this scene, that you are left wondering.
I:9102;1399;Is is true what Derek is saying, and if it is.
I:9102;1400;Sure, the supporting cast did a fantastic job as well, especially Edward Furlong who played Derek's brother, Danny in the movie.
I:9102;1401;He gave a superb performance in Primal Fear in 1996, followed by this in 1998 and ending the millennium with outstanding acting in Fight Club in 1999.
I:9102;1402;He feels disgusted with what his neighbourhood has become and he decides to take matters on his own hand, and do something about it.
I:9102;1403;How Norton transforms himself to reflect this is really amazing.
I:9102;1404;He knows it won't sit well with them.
I:9102;1405;good movies entertain, but great movies affect you on a personal level.
I:9102;1406;Terrific script and brilliant acting makes this one of my favorite movies.
I:9102;1407;This is a great movie as always it cAme fast cheap and no scratches case was im good condition even though thats never a big deal to me if you dont have prime i recommend that too gotta love prime!
I:9102;1408;This, along with Fight Club, is my favorite Edward Norton movie.
I:9102;1409;He is raped by a group of also neo.
I:9102;1410;He becomes friends with the black people in the jail, and when his time is up, he is ready to to move on with his life.
I:9102;1411;The ending was totally unexpected for me, and the final scenes were very powerful.
I:9102;1412;the acting here is terrific, Edward Norton is spot on.
I:9102;1413;The best thing about this movie is that it shows racism from the standpoint of white against black and black against white.
I:9102;1414;A wonderful film that everybody should see!
I:9102;1415;It has a very good story line, one with a message esp.
I:9102;1416;Definitely one to have in your library.
I:9102;1417;i think it's one of Norton's best.
I:9102;1418;We can see exactly how he gets such a loyal following, but his cases for racism are so convincing at times that I feel this movie doesn't do a good enough job to cut them down.
I:9102;1419;Instead of using compelling evidence to counterstrike Derek's points, all we get is a simple.
I:9102;1420;By the time I was done watching the 2.
I:9102;1421;My mouth was gaping with the marveling awe of impeccable filmmaking by director Tony Kaye, the tears were flowing freely from my eyes, and my heart stung with the emotional intensity of the film.
I:9102;1422;It is, in a word, a masterpiece of modern film art.
I:9102;1423;edward Norton perhaps has hit the high point of his career here as skinhead Derek Vinyard.
I:9102;1424;the film works well with black.
I:9102;1425;It works through these flashbacks brilliantly, not dulling the rest of the story at all, until the unforgettable explosive climax that stings the back of the mind long after watching American History X. Norton carries his own in this film.
I:9102;1426;And Furlong takes a wild ride as Danny here in the role of his lifetime.
I:9102;1427;Although Furlong has unfortunately been in a limited few films, he shines here.
I:9102;1428;He makes every word he says entirely believable and captures his character's burning intensity extremely well.
I:9102;1429;Beverly D'Angelo has a small part in this film as well, yet despite her character's few scenes, D'Angelo, as Doris Vinyard, the emotionally wounded mother of Derek and Danny, does so well here that you can just feel her pain come right through the screen.
I:9102;1430;She does her best acting in American History X and should have been commended with at least an Oscar nomination (but then again, Norton himself should have grabbed an Oscar and unfortunately didn't).
I:9102;1431;It's perhaps one of the most brutal films of the year, next to Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan, and has an intensity shining within that jolts a viewer.
I:9102;1432;But it is a masterpiece, maybe even more so than some thought Private Ryan was.
I:9102;1433;The impeccable acting, the agonizing content, the savage way of portraying it.
I:9102;1434;I think this movie is important for two reasons: 1.
I:9102;1435;i think Racism is an important topic in general.
I:9102;1436;i've never really liked Ed Norton as an actor.
I:9102;1437;I think he is fairly bland at best, but in this movie he does a far better job than in any other film I have seen him in.
I:9102;1438;I like how the film draws in both of the brothers, how they interact, how they choose to tell their side of the story and how they view each other.
I:9102;1439;secondly it should not be forgotten that this is a movie and the point is to tell a story and I think the cast and crew has managed to tell this story very well.
I:9102;1440;this movie is def worth seeing.
I:9102;1441;It is brutal on some point which ads to the importance and realistic tone of the movie.
I:9102;1442;It surprises me that when I talk to people about this movie that a large amount of them haven't heard of this movie.
I:9102;1443;This movie is does an excellent job at showing the true reality of racism in American.
I:9102;1444;Edward Norton does an amazing job at portraying his character who's a leader and a an idolized racist who holds against the minorities because his father was killed by blacks.
I:9102;1445;this movie is extremely gripping from the beginning as it goes between the present day and multiple flashbacks.
I:9102;1446;Even as rough as the content in the movie is, it is a great movie teaching about the reality of racism and the world we live in.
I:9102;1447;This is an excellent story staring Edward Norton and Edward Furlong as two brothes caught up in the skinhead movement of Southern California.
I:9102;1448;He soon works on changing his brother's attitudes towards race.
I:9102;1449;this is truly a hard.
I:9102;1450;It would earn a perfect five stars from me, if not for the ending.
I:9102;1451;overall, however, this is an excellent story and one that I highly recommend.
I:9102;1452;Very interesting, learned quite a bit.
I:9102;1453;the really wild thing is that this is real and could be happening everywhere.
I:9102;1454;My wife and i both love this movie, it definately teaches you that people can change no matter what background they came from
I:9102;1455;The film is set in Venice Beach, California.
I:9102;1456;This ,of course, sends everyone into fits.
I:9102;1457;The heartbeat of the story revolves around Danny's brother 'Derek', a Nazi skinhead who is well played by Ed Norton.
I:9102;1458;The roots of this attempted theft actually goes back to a basketball game in which Derek and his friends defeat a group of Blacks .
I:9102;1459;Anyway, In prison Derek does the right thing and joins the skinhead gang inside.
I:9102;1460;Here is a man who argues his ideology with passion, conviction and intelligence.
I:9102;1461;the film does have some strong points.
I:9102;1462;There are flashbacks in black white that are somewhat effective and a very good performance by Fairuza Balk as Dereks girlfriend.
I:9102;1463;Family relationships represent some of the most important relationships one creates in a lifetime.
I:9102;1464;These connections shape personalities, thoughts, and actions.
I:9102;1465;"Richard Corliss, a movie reviewer for Time, draws the conclusion that, ""you've got to be taught to hate."
I:9102;1466;When the audience can determine that Derek helped to turn Danny racist and then can turn around and also say Derek helped Danny stop his racist ways, the movie really shows the strong bond between two brothers.
I:9102;1467;another reason why the importance of sibling relationships represents the theme of American History X refers to the fact that we see most of the movie from Danny's standpoint.
I:9102;1468;But because the flashbacks take place in Danny's memory, the audience can see how much Derek means to him.
I:9102;1469;"Instead it examines the various ways these elements tear at the fabric of a family"" (Berardinelli)."
I:9102;1470;The inclusion of a family plays an emotional angle.
I:9102;1471;This is a searing contemporary tragedy that grips one working.
I:9102;1472;This movie clearly intends to reveal the strength of a relationship between two brothers.
I:9102;1473;The final presentation of the movie forces the audience to take a deeper look into Danny and Derek's relationship.
I:9102;1474;American History X simply uses the aspect of racism in order to explore the bigger issue, the importance of sibling relationships.
I:9102;1475;This is the one movie I feel strong enough to write a review for.
I:9102;1476;the acting is powerful, the story line excellent and the message undeniable.
I:9102;1477;But I also knew that Norton, as spectacular of an artist as he is, could not single.
I:9102;1478;also in most movies, there is a distinct line drawn between protagonists and antagonists.
I:9102;1479;American History X is filled with such complex, disturbed, and impressionable characters that it is difficult at times to be sure who is who, ethically speaking.
I:9102;1480;For example, Derek's (Norton's) motivating speeches about white supremacy and illegal immigrants are given with such confidence and leadership that at times, I find myself agreeing with his views.
I:9102;1481;along with Edward Norton's wonderful performance, I found Avery Brooks' role to be powerful and authoritative, to such a realistic extreme that I felt guilty whenever his lines were punishing, and reassured whenever his words were comforting.
I:9102;1482;"i guess I'll finish saying this: American History X has the power to force us to question ourselves and the people that influence our lives
I:9102;1483;American History X is an excellent, powerful film.
I:9102;1484;Norton's performance is oscar worthy, in my opinion.
I:9102;1485;This is a picture that makes you think.
I:9102;1486;Ed Norton gives an outstanding performance as a racist skinhead.
I:9102;1487;It is dark movie, and there is no happy ending for this one, but it is wonderfully crafted and well acted all the way around.
I:9102;1488;Well lets see its very rare for me to use five stars, but American History X deserves many more.
I:9102;1489;In my personal opinion it was the best movie of the year in 98, but of course would not have won due to the subject matter.
I:9102;1490;should had gotten best actor for this film.
I:9102;1491;Edward Furlong also was extremely good.
I:9102;1492;the director did a amazing job in keeping the story together.
I:9102;1493;American History X is one of the best movies ever made about racism and how people get to be like that.
I:9102;1494;I definitely recommend this movie to anybody and everybody.
I:9102;1495;This film is a master piece!
I:9102;1496;"Part of me was going ""ya!"""
I:9102;1497;We are here on earth to learn and this movie is a wonderful example of how to learn to control and understand the people we fear.
I:9102;1498;Give this film a change, you will learn alot about people and about yourself.
I:9102;1499;He's a rare Hollywood talent who has all my respect.
I:9102;1500;He knows his craft and is excellent at it.
I:9102;1501;The supporting cast is also equally as good.
I:9102;1502;This is a very powerful movie and hope that it is listed as a very important film in the 20th/21st Century.
I:9102;1503;This film takes a look at a small segment of our society, those who follow the warped beliefs of Nazism and Hitler, and brings it to life.
I:9102;1504;The film follows how the sons of the family developed or incorporated those beliefs as their own and how the rest of the family worked to change them or stay away from them.
I:9102;1505;Should you see this film?
I:9102;1506;what it does do is show you very vividly.
I:9102;1507;this film just brings it out in a very vivid way.
I:9102;1508;this is one that might just do it for you.
I:9102;1509;American History X is probably the best film I can remember seeing in my collective memory of life.
I:9102;1510;It is the single most stunning, true.
I:9102;1511;life, scary, and exciting film I have ever seen.
I:9102;1512;notch, everyone born to play his or her role.
I:9102;1513;This film is guaranteed to shock you with surprises 'round every corner.
I:9102;1514;"If you're looking for a drama that will frighten you terribly when you realize how true it really is, ""American History X"" is your best bet."
I:9102;1515;I always think they should see thought provoking movies on such subjects as this.
I:9102;1516;they really liked it a lot and couldn't believe how people were acting.
I:9102;1517;this film virtually explodes with all types of raw passion and emotion the likes of which i haven't seen in years.
I:9102;1518;"it was gripping and highly emotional
I:9102;1519;he is a terrific young actor who will become one of the greats as the years pass.
I:9102;1520;the photography (both color and black and white)was brilliant as was the digital transfer.
I:9102;1521;new line has done it still again!
I:9102;1522;this is one awesome and unforgettable flick that will stay with you for hours after you have viewed it for the first time.
I:9102;1523;American History X is an extremely powerful and important film.
I:9102;1524;Director Tony Kaye displays his talent as a filmmaker here.
I:9102;1525;His cinematography, both in color and black white, makes Venice look like a training ground for the Apocalypse.
I:9102;1526;Edward Norton gives his best performance.
I:9102;1527;The music here is also effective and flows with the film's mood, if not enhancing it.
I:9102;1528;This is an important film, which I think, should be shown in high schools around America.
I:9102;1529;It is a powerful study of hate.
I:9102;1530;Still, this is a powerful, important movie that everyone should watch.
I:9102;1531;Edward Norton is very well done in this film.
I:9102;1532;this movie defintley sends a message to viewers.
I:9102;1533;I loved this film and put it in my movie collection.
I:9102;1534;This was a great indepent film for me.
I:9102;1535;It was also one of my most favorite idependent films.
I:9102;1536;In my mind, he is the 1998 Acadamy Award winner for best actor in a leading role.
I:9102;1537;His performance was outstanding and I believe this to be his best movie role ever.
I:9102;1538;Good movie, great acting by norton.
I:9102;1539;An open and honest tale of two brothers .
I:9102;1540;This movie is written extremely well, the acting feels real, and the color contrasting is quite smart.
I:9102;1541;The ending is shocking and done superbly.
I:9102;1542;American History X is one of the strongest movies i have ever seen.
I:9102;1543;Pretty brutal at some points, but it helps convey the message.
I:9102;1544;evil man in a most interesting way.
I:9102;1545;or what is the purpose of my life.
I:9102;1546;this story takes you right to that answer.
I:9102;1547;We are born to answer the roar of the animal within us with the sweetness of The Light.
I:9102;1548;"We are born to balance on the very edge of Destiny determined by ""Seek and you shall find."
I:9102;1549;But many times the animal wins.
I:9102;1550;This film is powerfully moving watching one mans struggle to save his brother from the fate he is inflicted on him himself.
I:9102;1551;norton is amazing in this film and earned a well deserved Oscar nomination as he is so believeable as Derek Vinyard.
I:9102;1552;the film in general is amazing how the past is portrayed in black and white and the present in colour.
I:9102;1553;the scenes when Derek is retelling his time in prison are very touching and to watch a man realise all he has known is a lie is very moving indeed.
I:9102;1554;i love this film and now after watching it tell everyone I know what a great film it actually is.
I:9102;1555;this film explores hatred in many of its forms with an unblinking eye.
I:9102;1556;Disturbing, haunting, and extremely eye opening this is one film that should be mandatory viewing in college sociology classes.
I:9102;1557;American history X explores the racial prejudices of our society by graphic images of hate and through this provides a strong message of individual change.
I:9102;1558;Actor Edward Norton, who plays Derrick, plays the part perfectly.
I:9102;1559;The separation between black and white is witnessed in a territorial competition at the basketball courts.
I:9102;1560;Derrick turns out to be the star, winning the courts for his race.
I:9102;1561;In the prison laundry department Derrick finds himself working along side a black man.
I:9102;1562;What at first is a quiet and tense relationship quickly develops into a strong friendship.
I:9102;1563;The young gang member pulls out a gum and shoots Danny in the chest killing him.
I:9102;1564;This movie really makes you think about things.
I:9102;1565;I would recommend to anyone who has those types of views towards others because it can really be effective in changing your mind for the better.
I:9102;1566;Norton's performance, as expected, is beyond comparison, and he is truly one of the finest actors of his generation.
I:9102;1567;This narrative of redemption through the violent haunting of the past forces an older brother to see the ultimate results of his earlier actions.
I:9102;1568;this is recommended for all who love Norton's work, for school humanities classes, and for those seeking to better understand what it means to hate, and love, in America.
I:9102;1569;The breadth of subject matter and the beauty and mastery with which it is presented is what makes this film such a success.
I:9102;1570;up with the other members of the Supremists organization.
I:9102;1571;In this film, you see what life is like through the eyes of present day skin heads, as well as the consequences for their actions.
I:9102;1572;Edward Norton is spectacular in this film, as well as all the other main actors.
I:9102;1573;The way the movie is planned and laid out, the message is sent out very well.
I:9102;1574;I tip my hat to this film.
I:9102;1575;Edward Norton has demonstrated he is one of the hottest young actors the movie industry has.
I:9102;1576;American History X is a great film with a stellar performance by Edward Norton.
I:9102;1577;(He really should have won the Oscar.)
I:9102;1578;and is something that can resonant with anyone despite the discomfort some might feel about the racism portrayed.
I:9102;1579;I would recommend this movie to anyone.
I:9102;1580;It is not a comfortable movie to watch but it is one worth watching.
I:9102;1581;A great film even if the director didn't think so in the end.
I:9102;1582;This may be one of the biggest surprises of my life.
I:9102;1583;A very well acted and made movie it tackled large subjects without flinching and not avoiding.
I:9102;1584;Beverly D'Angelo, Avery Brooks, Elliot Gould and Stacey Keach are all fantastic in the supporting roles but it's both Furlong and Norton ,mostly Norton, who really have the floor in this movie.
I:9102;1585;Norton is proving that he is the best young actor of this generation and he recieved a much deserved Oscar Nomination for this role.
I:9102;1586;This movie deserves every bit of the praise that it has ever received.
I:9102;1587;It works on so many levels that one can't help but be impressed.
I:9102;1588;blowing and not your typical Hollywood ending (one of the things that makes the film so amazing).
I:9102;1589;quite simply, Edward Norton puts in the performance of a lifetime, one that nothing he ever does after this could possibly top for its intensity and power.
I:9102;1590;Edward Furlong plays his role extremely well, though his performance is greatly overshadowed by the more elder of the Edwards.
I:9102;1591;The cinematography is excellent, as is the sound and the editing.
I:9102;1592;It will be one that you will remember for the rest of your lives.
I:9102;1593;In a word, this film is fabulous.
I:9102;1594;it is an emotionally engaging, heartrending experience, essentially unlike anything I have ever seen before.
I:9102;1595;"it is certainly comparable to some of the greatest ""classic"" films that people tout much more openly: the stark, unflinching way in which it addresses some of the darkest elements not only of our society, but of the individual, is unforgettable."
I:9102;1596;this is THE film for anyone who is looking for a thought.
I:9102;1597;provoking, stirring, and unbelievably raw work.
I:9102;1598;norton (who, incidentally, ended up contributing a great deal in the post.
I:9102;1599;production process after the director effectively abandoned the project) delivers a fabulous and haunting performance.
I:9102;1600;Approach with an open mind, or stay away.
I:9102;1601;It has always been a good movie.
I:9102;1602;While I don't agree that this movie sums up all of our American history it is an intense drama about a man's journey and how his life has affected others as well.
I:9102;1603;The story is about redemption, and is highly powerful, and thought and heart provoking.
I:9102;1604;The drama is heart wrenching, and the movie makes you think.
I:9102;1605;Its an very important film that explains alot, and should be viewed because it matters.
I:9102;1606;I love this film, which touches on a bit of reality in our society.
I:9102;1607;Brutal and graphic with a powerful story.
I:9102;1608;The movie is incredibly thought.
I:9102;1609;provoking and the actors are absolutely brilliant.
I:9102;1610;I won't give away anything, but there are ups and downs in the movie, but anyway you look at it, it is definently touching.
I:9102;1611;Edward Norton delivers one of those once in a career type of performances that will make you want to watch the film over and over again.
I:9102;1612;Show it to your children when they're old enough to understand and process this stuff.
I:9102;1613;It's a great movie, but I expected to get a disc that at least mostly worked.
I:9102;1614;American History X had a ton of potential to be a really great film, with a powerful anti.
I:9102;1615;racism message and a deep look into the heart of white supremacy in America.
I:9102;1616;natured conversation with one black man.
I:9102;1617;It also offers an interesting look into the Aryan Youth subculture and what encourages these blue.
I:9102;1618;let's be realistic here, that's cold murder.
I:9102;1619;The main character (Derek) learned how to see past the color of someone's skin and came home to help his family discover the same.
I:9102;1620;This is one of the best movies of the decade.
I:9102;1621;Edward Norton plays an outstanding role as Derek Vinyard.
I:9102;1622;By the end of the movie you are moved and enlightened.
I:9102;1623;You understand something that the general public doesn't recognize that much, and it really takes a powerful effect on you.
I:9102;1624;let me warn you that it is a very graphic movie, yet, it is also amazingly one of the best I ever have seen.
I:9102;1625;Instead, suspend your disbelief, and allow yourself to believe Ed Norton's finely crafted performance and be absolutely blown away.
I:9102;1626;it approaches its delicate subject matter with conviction, maturity and stark imagery.
I:9102;1627;nazism among California's disenchanted urban youth in the 80's and early 90's, X is the story of one family, headed by eldest son Norton, and how the seed of racism takes root in his heart and begins to grow.
I:9102;1628;a fascinating and deeply layered tale of prejudice and the painful lessons of lives misspent in its shadow, American History X is explicitly violent but superbly performed and executed.
I:9102;1629;The ending, as shocking as any I've seen in cinema, is as uncompromising as the rest of the film and will provide little comfort to happy.
I:9102;1630;a couple of years ago i had a chance to talk to him after a very chance encounter in santa monica.
I:9102;1631;the original ending was the most important section of the film and it was completely altered.
I:9102;1632;"in fact, the inspiration for ""derek"" to embrace these ideas is absolutely linked to his personal and emotional experiences and not his logical mind."
I:9102;1633;if you want to judge for yourself, watch the film closely!all in all, this film was well directed, and in my opinion very well acted.
I:9102;1634;Apon viewing History, I left with knowing three things: 1)The writing and direction are bar none 2) Edward Norton is still a phenominal actor and 3)American History X is one helluva film.
I:9102;1635;Never before has anyone tried to take a Nazi, a modern day Nazi at that, and turn him into a heroic character.
I:9102;1636;His acting talents have leaked into other flicks, but with History X and Fight Club, Norton was in rare form, catipulting two revolutionary films even further.
I:9102;1637;Mixing themes of race, gang life, and redemption, American History message is left blatently open, but is strong and powerful.
I:9102;1638;As brutal as it is brilliant, AHX is rated R for good reason.
I:9102;1639;It packs as big a punch with adult material is it does with it's message.
I:9102;1640;Regardless, History X is a great film that derserves to be viewed.9.5
I:9102;1641;American History X is one of the most powerful films I've ever seen.
I:9102;1642;Edward Norton definitely deserved his Oscar for this role.
I:9102;1643;His great acting mixed with the stunning direction and cinematography makes this a truly brilliant film.
I:9102;1644;The story is the best part, it's about having the ability to put aside differences is what makes a true American and that having anger never makes your life better.
I:9102;1645;I recommend it to anyone who believes themself an American.
I:9102;1646;In the face of chaos, it highlights the possibility of how education, respect for humanity, love for our family, and love for ourselves can change not only me, not only you, but all of us.
I:9102;1647;He infects me and compels me to believe him.
I:9102;1648;Edward Furlong (Terminator 2) is the picture perfect intelligent young man with the ability to be taught a better way.
I:9102;1649;Norton is surely deserving of his nomination for best actor.
I:9102;1650;This film was recommended to me by my brother.
I:9102;1651;It provides the viewer with an uncensored look at how prejudice begins and where it leads.
I:9102;1652;It also shows that when you get to know a person all the pre.
I:9102;1653;If you want a true look at prejudice and bias from both sides of the fence this is a must see movie.
I:9102;1654;One final note, this movie is not pro white, black, yellow, Christian, Jewish, or Muslim.
I:9102;1655;This is by far Ed Norton's finest acting job to date.
I:9102;1656;American History X is a powerful film directed by Tony Kaye, and starring Edward Norton (Fight Club), Edward Furlong (Terminator 2: Judgement Day), and Beverly D'Angelo (National Lampoon's Vacation).
I:9102;1657;american History X is a very intriguing movie about redemption, discussing some very delicate and serious issues that are infesting in American society on a daily basis.
I:9102;1658;What makes the movie so powerful is Edward Norton (he was nominated for the Best Actor Oscar for his excellent performance) who delivers his best onscreen performance to date.
I:9102;1659;What I liked most about the movie is its non.
I:9102;1660;Undoubtedly we all experience the manupilative impact of our surroundings, not only the obvious effect of right.
I:9102;1661;It's very hard to put into words how this movie makes me feel, because each and every time I watch it, I am swept away by how powerful and influential it is.
I:9102;1662;derek (Edward Norton) has reasonable predisposed opinions of African.
I:9102;1663;The consequences of these beliefs take a powerful impact on his family when he guns down two Crips trying to steal his truck and is incarcerated for three years.
I:9102;1664;edward Furlong is excellent here, showing there is a deeper acting power lurking in him than such flops as Brainscan , Detroit Rock City and Pet Sematary II .
I:9102;1665;He plays his character with impressive range and doesn't inflate Danny's Nazi disposition to a ridiculous degree and balances his emotional outbursts to an acceptable median.
I:9102;1666;She definetely fits the character description with her willingness to buzz her raven locks and wear unattractive appliques to the most noticeable parts of her face.
I:9102;1667;She's one in a million, and I have to say she was wonderful.
I:9102;1668;This is a sign of an amazing writer, one who harbors an autocratic power that is channeled through this mesmerizing and credible character.
I:9102;1669;The film finishes with the full.
I:9102;1670;color portions of the beach, suggesting to the audience that everyone (characters and viewers) is illuminated as a result.
I:9102;1671;American History X is without a doubt one of the most moving films of this decade.
I:9102;1672;I reccomend this movie to everyone.
I:9102;1673;Edward Norton gives an unforgetable performance as a reformed Neo.
I:9102;1674;edward Norton is like a young Robert De Niro,with the way Nortongot into his role as Derek Vinyard.
I:9102;1675;In order for this story to be told well the graphic content is necessary.
I:9102;1676;This really is an awesome movie.
I:9102;1677;This is the greatest movie i have ever seen.
I:9102;1678;nazi movie set in Venice Beach California.
I:9102;1679;The lead character is a skin head who is very intelligent.
I:9102;1680;In the end a price must be paid to fate.
I:9102;1681;To be brutally honest, after seeing American History X, I'd have to say it's one of my favorite films ever.
I:9102;1682;Edward Norton does a magnificent job of acting in the movie.
I:9102;1683;The climax of the movie and the ending are also some of the best for its genre.
I:9102;1684;i'd recommend this movie to anyone.
I:9102;1685;His role in this film is Oscar worthy.
I:9102;1686;A very powerful drama demonstrating how some people really feel about racism.
I:9102;1687;This movie was one of the most moving films that I have ever seen!
I:9102;1688;I believe that this is a movie that most people should see because of it's extremely powerful portrayal of racism and the consequences of racism.
I:9102;1689;Edward Norton, Edward Furlong, and the rest of the cast give wonderful performances.
I:9102;1690;Although I can't stand tons of profanity, I tolerated it in this movie because of the strong subject matter that it dealt with.
I:9102;1691;There was graphic violence and lots of blood, but it is also accurate to the subject of the film.
I:9102;1692;this movie portrays the redemption of a man who thought he had screwed his life up forever.
I:9102;1693;It is absolutly beautiful to see him try to change his life, and the lives of others, particularly his brother.
I:9102;1694;I loved it, and will add it to my collection of films.
I:9102;1695;A good movie to watch
I:9102;1696;Edward Norton plays the racist, but the dialogue is sharp and intelligent.
I:9102;1697;While there is no question that Norton is not in the right, and that his racial hatreds have taken him down a perilous personal path, he makes certain biting commentary about race and society that are entirely true and worth agreeing with.
I:9102;1698;He is charismatic, and intelligent enough to see the light after being stigmatized in prison.
I:9102;1699;He seemed to have finally won the battle to save both his family's soul when his past all of a sudden catches up to him and kills Danny.
I:9102;1700;This twist at the end makes it impossible to finish the movie feeling good about ourselves that the hero has won his redemption through his trials by fire.
I:9102;1701;Great idea and a great movie.
I:9102;1702;Edward Norton is perfect in his role.
I:9102;1703;Norton's change of heart is totally believable.
I:9102;1704;this is a wonderful movie, an important movie which has a message.
I:9102;1705;Well my friends, that is the feeling that this movie delivers.
I:9102;1706;edward Norton is a highly underrated actor who delivers a mind blowing performance in this film.
I:9102;1707;The actors performance is so real, it's actually kind of hard to believe that they are NOT truly racists.
I:9102;1708;the characters in this movie portray what neo nazism in the real world is really like.
I:9102;1709;American History X is an epic movie to share with the ADULTS of the family, because this movie is VERY, VERY VILE!
I:9102;1710;I watched this shortly after it came out and remember being very moved by it, but waited another decade to see it again because it is just so hard to watch.
I:9102;1711;If you are affected by ugliness like I am, give it a chance.
I:9102;1712;There is a point to it all.
I:9102;1713;the settings are all great.
I:9102;1714;The costumes, hair, and overall look of people is right on.
I:9102;1715;the writing is pretty good.
I:9102;1716;the story is unique and fresh.
I:9102;1717;It is a biography of a skinhead.
I:9102;1718;I wouldn't say all's well that ends well because it doesn't exactly end well, but the ending is what made it watchable for me.
I:9102;1719;this movie was shocking and entertaining and moving and disturbing and, above all, incredible.
I:9102;1720;This is a stunningly powerful film which draws outstanding performances from Edward (fight Club) Norton, and Edward (kid from Terminator 2) Furlong.
I:9102;1721;A powerful film, moreso for the black and white prison scenes, it hopefully carries the message that racial violence solves very little.
I:9102;1722;This movie is great because it hits a spot in your heart, even though I give this movie 5 stars, it can be disturbing to watch in certain scenes.
I:9102;1723;Whether you confront and face your fears or the truth, it can set you free.
I:9102;1724;Hatred is so powerful, is the what will consume life if we as humans let it, one day there will be no earth left, hatred is the most deadliest, potent, evil, dark, form of energy that can completely take over ones mind and change oneself completely.
I:9102;1725;This is an amazing film about a neo.
I:9102;1726;What is so great about the film is it's strikingly new and original subject matter.
I:9102;1727;And the awesome use of black.
I:9102;1728;The supporting cast does a fine job in its role as well.
I:9102;1729;This is an excellent movie.
I:9102;1730;The acting was universally great, the writing was sharp, the characters believable.
I:9102;1731;And the conversion of the lead character from racist agitator to normal person is convincing.
I:9102;1732;This five star drama is emotional and powerful, and is filled with a recognizable cast including Beverly D'Angelo, Fairuza Balk, Elliott Gould and Stacy Keach.
I:9102;1733;Edward Norton's eloquent, passionate portrayal of a skinhead seemed more real than his quieter, more introspective portrayal of an ex.
I:9102;1734;i believed Edward Furlong: he acted consistently throughout as a hero.
I:9102;1735;His behaviour hinged so much on Norton's, however, that Norton's unbeleivable character turnaround pulled Furlong's solidly grounded and well played character from the believability and realism the acting merited.
I:9102;1736;all in all, a brilliant, disturbing, thought.
I:9102;1737;"provoking film
I:9102;1738;nazism than with an inspiring story of their salvation from hateful views.
I:9102;1739;"there are certain films that come out that raise enough commotion due to a political (""Schindler's List""), religous (can anyone say ""The Passion of the Christ""?)"
I:9102;1740;, and historical themes that are sensitive issues for many people.
I:9102;1741;Many of these films reveal to be an honest portrayal of the account in which they are trying to explain.
I:9102;1742;edward Norton gives the best performance of his young career as a skinead Neo.
I:9102;1743;nazi who returns from prison to his Venice beach home.
I:9102;1744;"but the film mainly focuses on his metamorphesis into an enlightened parolee and his relationship with a young brother (played exceptionally well by Edward Furlong, star of ""The Terminator 2: Judgement Day"") who is following in his toxic foosteps."
I:9102;1745;and also the strength and courage that it takes to break the chain.
I:9102;1746;"truly one of the most important films of the last decade, ""American History X"" is a bold statement that is not for all."
I:9102;1747;"adults and children alike
I:9102;1748;One of the best films of the latter part of the decade.
I:9102;1749;It shows that it`s not only whites who are prejudice , racists full of hate but that it works both ways .
I:9102;1750;Norton Furlong function well as the two brothers and their complementation to each other is excellent I really hope that Norton gets the Oscar for his performance but since AMX isn`t your typical Hollywood movie it`ll probably go to Tom Hanks or some other character who played a part in some billion $ political correct movie .
I:9102;1751;Beverly Dngelo (Derek Danny`s mom) is great as the brothers ill mother who manages to love her boys even with their political views what this brings down on her/(personal life) I can`t recorment this movie enough if I could I`d give it 6 stars out of 5 .
I:9102;1752;Wish they would make more movies with this great acting.
I:9102;1753;Edward Norton and Edward Furlong give a stellar performance and I love to watch this movie.
I:9102;1754;It is definitely worth the 8 dollars I paid for it.
I:9102;1755;It seems so insane to us, but it exists.
I:9102;1756;Edward Norton is incredible, and a post T2 Furlong works well as little brother.
I:9102;1757;The real skinhead culture has it's roots in Jamaican music and British working class ethics.
I:9102;1758;The rest of the cast is there to service a role.
I:9102;1759;Fairuza Balk is cool in a freaky goth chick sort of a way.
I:9102;1760;Edward Norton is one of those actors that is entirely watchable.
I:9102;1761;He can play very nice or very scary and you never know where he's going to go with it.
I:9102;1762;the film is both uplifting and tragic, as well as brutally realistic.
I:9102;1763;The ending of the film reminds us, however, that we still have a long way to go in race relations in America.
I:9102;1764;beverly D'Angelo, Elliot Gould, Stacey Keach, and Fairuz Balk also play convincing supporting roles in this powerful drama that is well worth watching.
I:9102;1765;This movie is an astonishing in dept story about neo.
I:9102;1766;Out of all the movies I have seen with wars against whites/blacks this movie definitely has to be the best one.
I:9102;1767;This movie had an amazing ending to it and I can't even compare this movie to any other.
I:9102;1768;in the view of a white person towards the black: Black guys are good.
I:9102;1769;This film is a gripping account of racism in modern America.
I:9102;1770;The character of Derek is brilliantly written and developed.
I:9102;1771;Furlong also turns a magnificent performance.
I:9102;1772;Hands down, this is an amazing movie.
I:9102;1773;the acting is by far the highlight of this film.
I:9102;1774;He goes from downright scary to completely likable through the movie.
I:9102;1775;More importantly, its a transition you really believe.
I:9102;1776;furlong, who bothers me a lot, mostly it's his voice, also puts in a good performance.
I:9102;1777;The rest of the cast also adds a lot to the movie.
I:9102;1778;Also Fairuza Balk puts in a sold performance.
I:9102;1779;And Avery Brooks, always a winner, really comes through.
I:9102;1780;I think Brooks puts in the second best performance, next to Norton, of the whole film.
I:9102;1781;In a movie with the caliber of acting, thats saying something.
I:9102;1782;the story itself is uplifting in it's own way, but still very dark.
I:9102;1783;Normally I am not a fan of flashbacks, but they are handled very well.
I:9102;1784;A good friend of mine suggested this film, and I really didnt know what to expect going in, but after this film was over, I sat in stunned silence.
I:9102;1785;the loss of love, friends, family.
I:9102;1786;and the realization that everything that you believed to be true isnt always the way things are.
I:9102;1787;Edward Norton's performance takes the viewer through this journey, and its not a pretty one.
I:9102;1788;it is quite shocking, as is much of the film.
I:9102;1789;I loved the story, acting, writing, everything about it.
I:9102;1790;I always enjoy Edward Norton movies, and I think he is one of the best actors of today.
I:9102;1791;At times of his past life he scares and shocks you, while when he is older you feel compasion for him.
I:9102;1792;It is definitley one of my favorites, and if you haven't had a chance to see it, go now!
I:9102;1793;One catch: the man is part of the local skinhead movement.
I:9102;1794;He goes to prison with a preconcieved notion of race, friendship, and humility.
I:9102;1795;A martyr of his brothers fight so.
I:9102;1796;played with utter brillance by Edward Norton and Eddie Furlong this movie will leave you with a lasting impact and stirred emotions.
I:9102;1797;Watch it in the dark.
I:9102;1798;His almost maniacal performance is simply astounding.
I:9102;1799;You can see it in his eyes, he takes this role 100% seriously.
I:9102;1800;It truly is probably his best performance to date and surely worthy of the Oscar nomination.
I:9102;1801;He owns this role and he is the reason to see this film.
I:9102;1802;Again, the acting made it believable.
I:9102;1803;i would recommend this film to anyone that wants a good story with wonderful performances.
I:9102;1804;Edward Norton's best role ever.
I:9102;1805;This is a great movie with great characters, great acting but an ever better story.
I:9102;1806;If you don't know why you fear or hate something or someone, watch this movie !
I:9102;1807;It is a good reflexion over racism and where our civilizations go in general.
I:9102;1808;This is a very real story.
I:9102;1809;It's got great acting by some great actors.
I:9102;1810;It brings a very real story together about stuff still going on today.
I:9102;1811;American History X is one of few movies that may be classified as a drama, but it will also give you a whole new perspective on how you view what is going on around you, and may even lead you to question areas of your life.
I:9102;1812;American History X is film so dramatic, so controversial, with so much conflict, that it will leave you sitting in silence while the credits roll.
I:9102;1813;It really scared me, in an incredible way.
I:9102;1814;It's really intense and hard to swallow so beware, but it's worth it.
I:9102;1815;furlong and Norton are able to obtain a perfect amount of love for each other.
I:9102;1816;And that's the kind of brilliance you should be looking for in a film.
I:9102;1817;And it's a great one.
I:9102;1818;but what really makes this movie so great is its ending.
I:9102;1819;"It's brilliant, it's shocking, and if you didn't see it coming the first time
I:9102;1820;It gives us a view of the high and low points of both races, and in the end it all works out.
I:9102;1821;So watch this movie and enjoy it, you won't be let down.
I:9102;1822;Edward Norton's is outstanding as a reformed black racist, as well as the supporting cast who includes Beverley D'Angelo as his mother.
I:9102;1823;dimensional, something rather rare in film and seemingly unheard of in films with themes of racial tensions.
I:9102;1824;Edward Norton is riveting and believable in the lead role.
I:9102;1825;edward Norton,always excellent,gives the performance of his career as Derrick Vinyard,a young man driven to hate and racism by the death of his father.
I:9102;1826;breathtaking, and certainly worth seeing the movie for.
I:9102;1827;Edward Furlong was a welcome presence here, and one I hope to see more from .
I:9102;1828;white seemed meaningful, and the character of Derek was intelligent as well as conflicted, but I didn't understand his metamorphosis, and I found it extremely hard to believe that his younger brother would simply .
I:9102;1829;all in all, I'd only give this movie the three stars on the basis of the strong, strong acting.
I:9102;1830;Well, if you look at any of my other recommendations, you can tell that I believe that Ed Norton is one of the best actors today.
I:9102;1831;One of the best storylines in this movie is the relationship between Norton and Edward Furlong.
I:9102;1832;Even with the lack of extras, this is still one of Norton's best films and well worth the price.
I:9102;1833;edward Norton's astounding performance saved it from this fate.
I:9102;1834;nazism when his fireman father is murdered by black gang members, Derek's powerful oration, lightning sharp mind and leadership skills help propel a group of Hitler.
I:9102;1835;oh, the cinematography, especially for a relatively low budget film, is beautifully done.
I:9102;1836;Some of the scenes are very powerful, especially the one where Derek killed a black man and then got arrested.
I:9102;1837;The eariler expression of racism is so powerful that the later less successful projection of the transformed Derek pales in comparison.
I:9102;1838;Viewers may not agree with the way the movie handled such a sensitive topic, but it in any case has succeeded in bringing us a strong visual sensation of racism.
I:9102;1839;But with the excellent casting by Norton, it all appears so vividly in front of our eyes.
I:9102;1840;It freezes a lot, it cuts parts but I still think it's an amazing movie.
I:9102;1841;This movie is so very good Edward norton is a great actor you need to see this movie American History X
I:9102;1842;American History X is one of the most powerful and gripping dramas ever made.
I:9102;1843;"The movie does an excellent job of driving home the old adage that ""what goes around, comes around."""
I:9102;1844;With an amazing cast, and powerful story line, it's all but impossible to walk away from this movie unmoved and with eyes unopened
I:9102;1845;I have never seen Norton anything but excellent in any role, my expectations of him were high, and he fully met and surpassed those expectations.
I:9102;1846;Indeed, this is one of his best, and I can understand why he was nominated for an Oscar based on his performance in AHX.
I:9102;1847;American History X portrays a young man turned into a neo.
I:9102;1848;Outside of those prison walls, his younger brother, played also with exceptional skill by Edward Furlong, yet another boy who idolizes his older sibling, continues on the path Derek has blazed.
I:9102;1849;Most lessons in life are learned best when we hit bottom.
I:9102;1850;He emerges from prison a changed man.
I:9102;1851;But Norton makes this transformation of a man's heart ring true.
I:9102;1852;The movie stands as a powerful statement of the possibilities of changing evil into good, of waking a spirit seemingly lost to hatred to the grace of love in what becomes a true hero: the man who was once fallen, who grows through his pain, and becomes a man able to stand up for what takes true courage .
I:9102;1853;If you want to watch a one of the greatest films about hatred from all races this is the one for you.
I:9102;1854;The movie is truly one of the best of all times.
