1;This is a very intense story and not for the faint of heart.
2;The background being desert like for both times and the resemblance of the women made it hard to realize the difference right away.
3;Otherwise it was a sit at the edge of your seat story and the revelation at the end was worthy of O. Henry.
4;This movie will have you on the edge of your seat.
5;A absolute must see for everyone!
6;I will say that the movie kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time.
7;Even though aren't car chases or shootouts, the movie makes you feel as if you will miss an important detail if you look away for a second.
8;A masterpiece of emotion and thought provoking scenes.
9;The beginning scenes of the film offer us a clue to the direction of the film so please pay attention.
10;casting of this film is amazing.
11;The shocking tragedies experienced by the mother and one of the most jolting endings of all time, make this a essential watch.
12;all I have been able to get is French sub Titles.
13;The movie is full of twists and turns and I enjoyed it immensely but my wife, who is from Lebanon/Syria, did not like it so much because of graphic violence in parts of it.
14;i thought the acting was excellent, and the use of settings was superb.
15;i highly recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in thinking about the long term impact of war on both the innocent and the terribly guilty, andIncendies (Two.
16;It will appeal, above all, to viewers who might be drawn to original, story.
17;driven cinematography complimented by rich cultural details.
18;It also provides exceptional panoramic and intimate shots of a bustling Middle Eastern country generally shrouded in mystery.
19;the title of my review will give you the nexus.
20;It is a great example of tenacity, love and forgiveness.
21;This movie has the most interesting twists.
22;everyone has said it was a great movie.
23;the story is compelling and will hold your interest.
24;I personally prefer uplifting movies.
25;The special features are worth watching.
26;It's the kind of movie that you think about once in a while.
27;It's a very sad movie but also very interesting.
28;the cinematography is great and some of the story lines (like the bus) are interesting, but it just didn't work for me.
29;I watched it twice in the same weekend and it was just as good the second time as the first.
30;paced and easy to digest.
31;Incendies is one of the most thought.
32;provoking movies I've seen in ages.
33;Director Denis Villeneuve really knows how to pace and weave a fascinating tale.
34;A riveting and wonderful film with a shocking ending I didn't see coming.
35;"A film adaptation of Wajdi Mouawad's play ""Scorched"" which has won multiple awards including eight 31st Genie Awards including ""Best Motion Picture"", ""Best Actress"", ""Best Director"" and ""Best Adapted Screenplay""."
36;up of the faces of the characters, the vibrant colors as both women travel throughout the Middle East, the detail on the baby receiving its mark on its foot, the grime and bruised feet and legs of Nawal in prison.
37;There is a lot of detail in this film.
38;Black levels are inky and deep and a good balance between warm and cool colors throughout the film.
39;"if anything, ""Incendies"" looks fantastic on Blu."
40;driven film, the film utilizes the ambiance of a war.
41;"sPECIAL FEATURES:""Incendies"" comes with the following special features:Commentary with Director Denis Villeneuve ."
42;"jUDGMENT CALL:""Incendies"" is one of those films that stays in your head for quite awhile."
43;"feeling that a film such as ""The Shawshank Redemption"" gave be back in 1994, unpredictable climax and a shocking ending to make you feel that you just watched one hell of a masterpiece!Make no doubt about it, this is probably one of the most disturbing family tragedy that one will watch but once the ending credits show up, you just realize how powerful and cathartic ""Incendies"" truly is."
44;the film which was an adaptation of Wajdi Mouawad's play is wonderfully done.
45;Suffice to say, what the two discover is quite shocking, what her children would learn about their father and the brother the never knew they had.
46;villeneuve was quite wise in utilizing cinematographer Andre Turpin to give us the visual images showcasing the violence and terror that Nawal Marwan had to live through.
47;"it's hard to believe such a powerful film was based on a play but the wonderfully directed and screenplay adaptation is what makes ""Incendies"" work, balanced with a wonderful performance by the film's leading ladies Lubna Azabal and Melissa Desoremeaux."
48;And once again, this film reinforces how location is important.
49;ray and then watching the making of the film special feature, you realize that in order to capture the realism of what the women had to undertake, you have to be in the area, among the people who have suffered from the war.
50;It was quite intriguing to watch the behind.
51;"but a question that I have been asked is which film did you enjoy better ""Incendies"" or ""In a Better World""."
52;"And with the spotlight on bullying and school violence around the world and featured so much in the media, that is probably the biggest advantage that ""In a Better World"" had over ""Incendies""."
53;"but while ""Incendies"" did not win the Academy Award for ""Best Foreign Language Film"", it did win multiple awards and the film has pretty much received mostly positive reviews from the film critics around the world."
54;It is a great film, well.
55;cast and features a great performance by its cast.
56;it doesn't have the banality of other films, if anything, it's a unique film that yes, it is a family tragedy film but in the end, love conquers all.
57;Incendies is fantastic and if you are a cineaste, this film is a must.
58;Very disturbing but well done movie.
59;It is a movie that will stay with you long after you have viewed it.
60;Thought provoking and well crafted film about a volatile subject.
61;Amazing twist at the end.
62;Some of the crimes against her are committed by Christians, others, by Muslims but ultimately, as she so perfectly articulates, none of that truly matters.
63;That said, this is probably a good film for those who are more introspective to watch because it raises a lot of important questions about what it means to be a human being .
64;But the manner in which she goes about recovering from this hate is miraculous in and of itself.
65;If you want to see a film about an outstanding woman and a fantastic mother, this is the one for you.
66;Any woman who truly loves her children will understand the actions of this, very real and very elegant person.
67;The twist, though over the top, exhibits well the monsters that war makes us.
68;I will not reveal the plot of the story but i highly recommend.
69;The result is a staggeringly powerful film whose story is so well revealed by a cast of sterling actors that telling too much of the plot would be a disservice to those who come to this experience for the first time.
70;In this viewer's opinion it is simply one of the finest films of the decade and it bound to become a permanent part of the cinematic library.
71;the opening of the film reveals many clues as to the direction the story will take.
72;Very little of the tragedy of Nawal's life is spared but the power that comes from the moments of discovery of the truths of that life lies in the quiet shock in the eyes of the twins.
73;This is an amazingly powerful film that keeps the audience tension level high making the surprising ending just that much more powerful.
74;The cinematography by Andr Turpin manages to capture both the vast power of the Middle Eastern desert and villages as well as the moments of intimacy.
75;The musical score by Gr goire Hetzel enhances the atmosphere and the story line very subtlely.
76;But in the end it is the sensitive direction of Denis Villeneuve that brings with human tragedy of a story alive.
77;It is always interesting to see the craft and slant put on films by those who create a film outside of the US.
78;This is especially true when the film is set in the ever turbulent Middle East.
79;I recommend it to anyone interested in the day to day life of the Arab countries, but I hope what is depicted in the film is not the normal course of events experienced by the typical citizen.
80;dennis Villeneuve (43) has demonstrated he is one of the major driving forces of the great cinema, and if it's true the film didn't take the golden statue, it will remain among the most lucid, powerful and ambitius films of this century that just begins.
81;The power of the performances, direction, storyline, and cinematography are amazing.
82;The ending will shatter you.
83;One of the thrills of the movie is that, unlike so many twisted plottings, you the audience are ahead of the questing children, the daughter always determined, the son only gradually but then inexorably drawn on, in realizing the stunning twist.
84;Wonderful movie its a must see.
85;Brillant story with a ending you dont see coming!
86;Bravo ive watched it twice.
87;Now its time to find another movie just as good
88;Sad and beautifuly told story that stays with you for a very long time.
89;A superb story told in an amazing way.
90;It hooks you from the start, takes you through a convoluted road of intrigue, doubts and surprises.
91;See it, and you will never forget it.
92;BUt it does and I found it most enjoyable.
93;So much I bought it for repeat watches.
94;This movie demonstrates some of the highest aspects of our ability to show divine compassion in the face of complete suffering and loss.
95;The wisdom gained from this film priceless and the insight into the passions at play in Lebanon and the Middle East is exceptional.
96;This is a transformative movie.
97;This powerful story takes up a few destinies that are affected by the horrors of the war and the oppressions that exist in a few conservative societies.
98;a strong and haunting movie.
99;An outstanding movie in all areas.
100;but we were so engrossed by the brilliant acting, the unfolding tragedy (which would do justice to a Classical Greek play!)
101;a brilliant story with a gripping twist in the tail.
102;This is both sad and beautiful and makes you happy to be born in the States.
103;A twisted tale about family and a mother's past.
104;By removing the story from the real.
105;It is best conceived as a horror story.
106;The way the story unfolds is gripping while providing an inside look at war.
107;The acting is extremely good .
108;and the ending provides a real twist.
109;The viewer is drawn in to each scene and can't help but feel compassion and empathy throughout the story.
110;It arrived and we are enjoying it.
111;A great story of overcoming all odds.
112;My recommendation is stay away!
113;It has a message of letting go of hate, which is a beautiful message but I think it could have been portrayed in a more positive, less sickening manner!
114;this film will appeal to viewers who are drawn to original, story.
115;A moving film that stands as metaphor for the ongoing civil wars for Lebanon.
116;She hides her cross and converts her scarf into a hijab in order to hitch a ride on a shuttle bus .
117;When asked about her allegiances given that when she worked for her uncle's newspaper she wrote about peace her response is chilling .
118;in my case it anchored the film politically in time.
119;One of the 10 best movies I have seen in the past 10 years.
120;One of the five best movies I have seen in the past 10 years.
121;One of the best movie I have ever seen in my life, I love it.
122;And for one who only seen two foreign film before this has so much it speaks to us about life.
123;It kept my attention, because you have to read it to know what was happening (smile) and you need to pay attention because you will miss so much its worth your viewing.
124;OK, so it's a bit heavy.
125;handed sometimes but the interweaving of periods works to good if initially puzzling effect and there is one perfect, heart.
126;If awarded the Foreign Language Film Oscar, it's deserving.
127;a movie of a Canadian twins seeking their roots in this Middle Eastern country looks to a reviewer aka a modern continuation of the Arabic Nights told by a French.
128;what is really fresh is story characters' broad possibilities and ease of moving and getting jobs in the West, which to a great extent might explain a spread of terrorism in a real world afterwards.
129;if you're in the mood for a complicated and deeply felt story, this is for you.
130;Our Canadian neighbors produced this emotionally devastating film which gathered an Oscar nomination for best foreign language film.
131;A series of flashbacks begins as an 18 or 19 Nawal has besmirched the family honor by becoming pregnant out of marriage.
132;The young father is killed but Nawal is saved by her grandmother.
133;Others may see it coming.
134;The performance by Azabal as Nawal is certainly noteworthy and the twists and turns of the uncovering mystery make this film high on my recommended list.
135;the Sony Blu ray disc is extremely good.
136;Much of the film is shot is with a sandy landscape representing rural Lebanon.
137;Interior scenes range from colorful to bland but the Blu ray gives an honest representation.
138;While much of the film is dialog centered, there is plenty of external action to keep the speakers occupied.
139;There are many crowd scenes as well a cramped but noisy rooms.
140;There are also several war events as well.
141;Excellent movie and a wonderful portrayal of the situation in The Middle East.
142;What was even more entertaining was the use of the Lebanese language.
143;A shocking yet very realistic story.
144;I loved the movie and strongly recommend it.
145;This is one of the greatest films I have seen.
146;It's good to find a book or movie that surprises you with its twists and turns.
147;and this movie qualifies as one of those movies.
148;the topic is dark with a culture and life style that is so foreign to me.
149;I first watched it on TV and then bought it to share with a specific friend of mine.
150;i believe you'll enjoy this movie.
151;and at the end of it all, there will be a good feeling about the strength we human beings have to overcome .
152;It tells a tale that is reminescent of classical Greek tragedy.
153;It is disturbing and dark, but emotionally powerful and probing.
154;To me, on many levels it is a cinematic work of art that will resonate and haunt the viewer.
155;let is be said that I haven't seen such a powerful movie in quite a while, and I see a lot of movies.
156;"I also saw the movie that did win the Oscar last year for Best Foreign Movie, Denmark's ""For a Better World"", which is not bad either, but let me tell you, this is MILES better and it's a shame this movie didn't win the Oscar."
157;All that aside, PLEASE WATCH THIS MOVIE, you will be in for a rare treat.
158;Incendies is HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommended.
159;I loved the uniqueness of the music.
160;The story was more than surprising and the acting and the backdrop was wonderful.
161;Next, be sure to see it in the theater for maximum impact.
162;There are some very emotional scenes, but very little violence, which is amazing, considering what was happening in Lebanon in the '70's.
163;"I've seen a lot of good films from that category and ""Incendies"" is one of the best."
164;The acting, although not outstanding, is very good.
165;There is a variety of locations and a variety of cultural settings and issues that are very engrossing, sometimes almost too engrossing.
166;The back and forth from present to past is very well done and greatly enhances the the suspense of the movie.
167;"The innocence I previously mentioned about some of the characters is a key to the success of ""Incendies""."
168;As always I had previously seen it but the story has so many readings that every time you see it is the first time.
169;You will burn with superb film making.
170;For mature audiences who can handle traumatic and violent subject matter and scenes.
171;"highly recommended for film watchers who need something to ""up the ante"" and break out of the boring routine mold."
172;I was very entertained and emotionally moved by this excellent movie.
173;a mother dies and the intentions of her will are revealed to her twin, adult.
174;The scenes are quite chilling and shocking.
175;The film jumps all over the place, chronologically, without full explanations as to how characters (primarily the mother) arrived there.
176;"I don't believe that a whale would purposely sink a ship but I, nonetheless, still love ""Moby Dick""."
177;This is an expertly directed film that is meticulous in it's depiction yet always riveting.
178;The performances are first rate.
179;The pacing makes for great entertainment.
180;Whether realistically acceptable or not, the climax of this movie is unexpected, moving and acts as a very satisfactory ending.
181;this was a great, entertaining story, involving a subject matter that is rarely examined in the movies and the flick packed a powerful emotional whallop when the credits came up.
182;big thumbs up, warts and all!
183;"Incendies (the title translates as ""Scorched"", but, much as with ""Les Miserables"", the original meaning is conveyed to Anglophones quite adequately by the French word) was the most successful Canadien film of 2010, earning eight Genie Awards (including awards for Best Picture, Director, Actress, and Screenplay), and being nominated for the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film."
184;But regardless, it is a superb piece of cinema, easily the strongest effort from rising writer.
185;"Nawal's employer and friend, notary Jean Lebel (Remy Girard, a regular in the films of Denys Arcand, including ""The Barbarian Invasions"", which won the Oscar in 2003), provides them with her will."
186;Nawal supplies a major revelation for her children: their father and a heretofor.
187;unmentioned sibling are both alive and somewhere in Lebanon.
188;Nawal provides two letters, one for each, and asks that they locate and deliver them.
189;the performances of the main cast are uniformly strong, particularly Azabal, who won the Genie for her work here.
190;Girard (who rather resembles a Quebecois Tom Wilkinson), the veteran of the cast, does a nice job in a supporting role.
191;poulin and Gaudette as the children do a commendable job with the present.
192;"day segments
193;Villeneuve's writing and direction are both excellent.
194;handed analogy between life and pure mathematics, were later significantly dispelled (the mathematics motif, for instance, has an excellent final usage).
195;Villeneuve artfully structures the action.
196;This is a very strong intense movie.
197;Very strong build up to a gut wrenching ending.
198;I really liked it and having spent time in this parts of the world really helps to understand the true nature of and power of a film like this one.
199;the picture is flawless, and once you watch the documentary, you realize how fortunate we all are that the end result turned out this pristine.
200;So then one should be happy knowing with how Villeneuve does both his long landscape shots and even lengthier face.
201;that it merits this Blu as being some of the best clarity and vivid detail preservation I have seen for a film of this make.
202;the main special feature is a 44.
203;of that is worth the watch and actually well produced.
204;I appreciate the little things in a film, and there are so many that percolate throughout this entire piece.
205;A very high recommendation, (**maybe a spoiler**) but I understand why it did not win the Oscar as the Incendies themed ending also torpedoed an amazing film by John Sayles years ago.
206;The film is an emotional adventure filled with a mystery that will shock you to the end"
207;The story leaves an unforgetable imprint in your mind and your heart.
208;This film is just the best movie, I have seen in many a year.
209;The film has a middle eastern war setting and will bring a grown adult to a tear or two as we follow the protagonist in her tragedies.
210;The story and film direction defies putting into words and one can only urge viewers to review the movie frame by frame after an initial viewing.
211;Without delving into the storyline or director pedigree, this film lives up to creating a rewarding and amazing film viewing experience for any who cares watch.
212;My co. worker loved it a little more than the 'Winter In Wartime'.
213;She said it was quite a tear.
214;Guess I'll watch it soon.
215;`Incendies' translates into English as `scorched' and is a good metaphor for the whole film.
216;Simon is disgruntled with the whole thing and stays at home sulking .
217;that is probably the Gallic influence.
218;The real past is told in episodic flashbacks, and we start to see what a harrowing and extraordinary life that Narwal has lived.
219;Whilst this is all done very tastefully, it has the feel of being much more gritty than it actually is and that has to be a testament to the brilliant direction of Denis Villeneuve (who also adapted this from the stage play).
220;this is also beautifully shot and has a powerful soundtrack that features Radiohead.
221;In French, with some Arabic and English, all well translated, albeit translitterally, this is a film for anyone interested in World cinema.
222;It is also about the indominatabilty of the human spirit and the love bond a mother has for her child.
223;I found it utterly absorbing and I hope you do too.
224;The movie is really told great and the story is really good.
225;This film truly blew my mind.
226;A mystery till the shattering end.
227;And there she learns the truths about their mother's turbulent life at the time of a civil war.
228;"Bolstered by the strong performances of the cast (Lubna Azabal is amazing), ""Incendies"" (nominated for Best Foreign Language Film) is notable for its dramatic impact."
229;And that truth is that the fighting is tit for tat.
230;Nonetheless, Villenueve still implies that it's the Muslim side who are clearly the wronged party here.
231;"The guide's assurance that ""everything is okay"" is enough for him to take a ride with a duo of potential killers."
232;'Incendies' manages to keep one's interest despite the main character's motivations that don't add up and the director's clear political bias.
233;It turned out to be one of the greatest movies I've ever seen.
234;The story line, the ending, and everything in between is brilliantly played.
235;It is definitely worth watching and after seeing it, I knew I had to own it.
236;So I found myself on Amazon and now I have added it to my collection!
