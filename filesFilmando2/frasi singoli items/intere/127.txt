I:18462;1;This is by far my favorite musical.
I:18462;2;This is truly a great film.
I:18462;3;No wonder it won best picture at the 1961 academy awards.
I:18462;4;Marias brother is killed, and so is Tonys friend.
I:18462;5;There are some great songs such as Tonight, Cool, I Feel Pretty, and America which only adds to the films greatness.
I:18462;6;Rita Moreno as Anita, is an excellent dancer.
I:18462;7;The voice overs are very well kept secret, so you think the characters are actually singing their own songs.
I:18462;8;It is about love and predjudice.
I:18462;9;Truly a movie for those of a mature audience.
I:18462;10;I have found that when I was a youngster, I hated the film, but now I love it.
I:18462;11;Anyways, Natalie Wood is great, along with the rest of the wondeful cast.
I:18462;12;Natalie Wood is astounding,and the music is beyond compare!
I:18462;13;I am a music instructor and I show this film to my music appreciation classes as a prime example of the American musical theater for several reasons:1.
I:18462;14;Bernstein's score was daring and fresh.2.
I:18462;15;The choreography is also unique.
I:18462;16;It fulfills a specific purpose of integrating movement with the music and creating energy.3.
I:18462;17;I also show my classes a stage version to compare it to.
I:18462;18;an innovation in the late '50s, and a social message for today.
I:18462;19;the story itself is great and the acting superb, but what really makes this movie worthwhile are the snappy songs and phenomenally choreographed dance numbers.
I:18462;20;the performances are absolutely outstanding.
I:18462;21;richard Beymer's Tony was great, Natalie Wood's Maria was extraordinary, particularly near the end, and George Chakiris's Bernardo was cool, calm, and collected (but also despicable at times).
I:18462;22;The real standout, however, was Rita Moreno's Anita, energetic and jazzy throughout the whole film.
I:18462;23;The best musical I have ever seen, no questions asked.
I:18462;24;Choreography and music are great .
I:18462;25;A few particular scenes absolutely stood out and glowed, owing their magic to the actors' chemistry.
I:18462;26;Richard Beymer and Natalie Wood do a great job.
I:18462;27;First time the 10 yr/old saw it and she was impressed and enjoyed.
I:18462;28;It is my favourite cinematic production of Shakepeare's Romeo and Juliet.
I:18462;29;The dancing and the music is so great.
I:18462;30;West Side Story is beloved musical but I could never get in to this classic.
I:18462;31;Natalie Wood is the bright point in this film, even though she didn't actually sing the songs, her performance is riveting, she was a special actress back then.
I:18462;32;A movie is a great movie if I want to see it year after year.
I:18462;33;I know they have revivals of West Side Story and other classics on Broadway.
I:18462;34;This product is exactly what I was looking for, and I found it here much cheaper than anywhere else.
I:18462;35;There's definitely a connection between this story and the history of Jesus dying for the world.
I:18462;36;It's beautiful and as cheesy and old as this movie is, it's still a classic.
I:18462;37;I'm 22 and I'm suggesting everyone see this movie (yes you can make fun of the cheesiness).
I:18462;38;West Side Story is the film that set hearts a flutter and mouths a talking in both a positive and negative way.
I:18462;39;When the movie was released people were amazed by the vivid colors and striking direction of the film the low camera angles on the dance scenes is just amazing allowing an open freedom to the choreography!
I:18462;40;With this film she shows more range and vitality than any actress that year.
I:18462;41;And the film was awarded the most Oscars for any movie musical ever!
I:18462;42;It is fitting that one of the most stunnigly beautiful films ever made is about something that everyone should fear hate.
I:18462;43;It is just Romeo and Juliet set to some of the best songs and some of the most amazing direction for a musical ever.
I:18462;44;This is one of my favorite all time musicals.
I:18462;45;Personally, I saw it about 20 years ago and was stunned that it had won so many Oscars.
I:18462;46;I could see that it had good music, but that was the only thing it had.
I:18462;47;Let's face it: the Musical is a genre that the recent generations don't seem to enjoy very much, with some possible exceptions, like the more recent Films with songs and dances like Chicago , Moulin Rouge or the Disney Films.
I:18462;48;however, this movie West Side Story , will delight everybody.
I:18462;49;West Side Story is one of the best musicals around, a lot of people consider this movie the best of the genre, and there are a lot of reasons why this movie is considered a classic.
I:18462;50;the songs are great, the choreography is stunning, the actors / dancers are fantastic, the cinematography is flawless, the direction is almost perfect, overall this movie is very good.
I:18462;51;West Side Story is an old but all time movie which got 10 well deserved Oscars.
I:18462;52;The music, by Leonard Bernstein, is great.
I:18462;53;It is sometimes vibrating and vital, others romantic, but always powerful.
I:18462;54;The choreography is quite distinctive, full of energy and it's daring and agresive.
I:18462;55;West Side Story is more a modern opera rather than a film with some songs and dances.
I:18462;56;This movie is guaranteed to put a smile on your face (because you're either loving the music, studying the imagery and visual metaphors, or laughing at the cheesey gang members frolicking around each other in very tight pants).
I:18462;57;If you never saw West Side Story, the most brilliant musical in the history of cinema, it is a true epic indeed.
I:18462;58;The characters are memorable and the music is sensationally stunning, especially Tonight .
I:18462;59;One of the best musical of all time, and I'm glad to report that fixed BD .
I:18462;60;Both picture and sound are great!
I:18462;61;"There are some great tunes here
I:18462;62;But any movie should entertain, and to me, this one is deficient.
I:18462;63;Everyone must love this musical.
I:18462;64;All of the players do a superb job of acting and the choreography is A.1.
I:18462;65;natalie Wood was one super actress!
I:18462;66;I bought this for my Daughter.
I:18462;67;A movie that she would have never seen, but now she tells everyone that she has it.
I:18462;68;This is one of the greatest movies ever made in the U. s.
I:18462;69;It has a love story.
I:18462;70;A study in the dynamics between two cultures.
I:18462;71;Loved itGreat racial movie a true gem.
I:18462;72;Played great on my TV.
I:18462;73;A classic and wonderful film for all time.
I:18462;74;We shared it with a generation that had never seen it.
I:18462;75;Bought it to view with our granddaughter whose ballet group performed a 10 minute summary.
I:18462;76;She wanted to see the whole story.
I:18462;77;I for one loved the play and movie.
I:18462;78;Its a piece of movie historyThe movie is fantastic, the music unforgettable.
I:18462;79;I got this for my 9 year old daughter after seeing a touring production and it really enhanced her appreciation for the show.
I:18462;80;I have always loved this movie and wanted to see it again.
I:18462;81;Found it here on Amazon and watched it with my 12 year old daughter and she loved it as well.
I:18462;82;It's a musical version of Romeo and Juliet, with New York Gangs.
I:18462;83;They both liked it a lot.
I:18462;84;The movie won 10 Oscars and you'll recognize most of the songs, as they are iconic (Tonight, Maria, I Feel Pretty).
I:18462;85;The songs and dances such as America and the Act cool song were really good because it stuck in peoples heads However it can't really be called a Romeo and Juliet movie because if it was it would require both star crossed lovers to die in the film which did not happen.
I:18462;86;Perhaps the greatest musical is honored respectfully in a boxed set.
I:18462;87;And Amazon offered it at an irresistible price.
I:18462;88;It opens a door into the incredible power of theater's ability to recreate its traditional stories for every generation.
I:18462;89;A great movie of a great idea.
I:18462;90;When finished with this chore I'll have a great vinyl collection for sale and still have all my favorities.
I:18462;91;A love story with a timeless and universal appeal.
I:18462;92;A pulsating energy from beginning to end.
I:18462;93;A fantastic libretto and Leonard Bernstein's outstanding score, with performances to match.
I:18462;94;wEST SIDE STORY also features some fine acting performances, although curiously not from the leads.
I:18462;95;what really energates WEST SIDE STORY is the brilliant choreography of Jerome Robbins.
I:18462;96;Much more than a Musical, this masterpiece satisfies all the senses and it remains unsurpassed in its achievement.
I:18462;97;wonderful music, revolutionary dancing, and powerful story!
I:18462;98;Sondheim and Burnstein are two great masters!
I:18462;99;I am a sucker for musicals and this one with the cinamatography is my favorite.
I:18462;100;ish, it is a deep rich story of a broken system and the lives of just hurting scared people with their reactions to society.
I:18462;101;West Side Story is a true broadway classic.
I:18462;102;The film is directed by Robert Wise and it features memorable songs such as: Tonight , Somewhere , and America .
I:18462;103;The film also won an Oscar for 'Best Picture' in 1961.
I:18462;104;I bought this for a gift for a friend who is a West Side Story fan, I am sure she will get a great deal of pleasure out of it.
I:18462;105;I loved every part of this movie and I am only 14 years old.
I:18462;106;The best parts are the brilliant songs I love all of them and the ending because I have seen it 5 times and I cried at every one.
I:18462;107;Let me just say that all the actors especally Richard Beymer, George Chirikas, Rita Merano, and Natalie Wood do an excellent job and this will be my favorite movie for all time.
I:18462;108;It's a really really great combo.
I:18462;109;"Very good movie
I:18462;110;My daughter really loves it and wanted to see it as we're going to a live performance at the end of the month.
I:18462;111;Deserved to win best picture.
I:18462;112;This musical was very moving.
I:18462;113;winning play, WEST SIDE STORY (Best Scenic Design and Choreography.
I:18462;114;set in the summer of 1957, WEST SIDE STORY is an unusual, edgy jazz.
I:18462;115;Thank you so much now I can watch it over and over very satisfied with the selection
I:18462;116;Everytime I see West Side Story, I make myself beleive the ending is going to be so happy.
I:18462;117;I vote for an extra scene in the special features that makes an alternative happy ending.
I:18462;118;Can you believe they kept her a secret for so many years, in so many movies.
I:18462;119;the choreography in this movie is one that is genius, will never be surpassed on film and a collaboration we will NEVER see again.
I:18462;120;and I will tell you MY favorite part of the movie cause THIS can only be done in an independent movies because of MONEY MONEY MONEY issues.
I:18462;121;aLL that SILENCE, is so effective and pure gold.
I:18462;122;What amazed me was how technically great the movie was.
I:18462;123;The camera work was great.
I:18462;124;The choreography was some of the best I have seen.
I:18462;125;Moreover, even some of the cast members gave incredible performances (especially Rita Moreno who gave one of the best supporting performances of all time IMO).
I:18462;126;"The great songs also captured me:""America"", ""Tonight"" reprise, ""Somewhere"", and ""Maria""."
I:18462;127;the storyline was based on Romeo and Juliet, so it had a great work to build its foundation on.
I:18462;128;The way the work was transformed from Broadway to film was another advantage, preserving this masterpiece (I do not throw this word loosely) for future generations.
I:18462;129;the Sound is really great in my mind.
I:18462;130;Its classic faboulus Musical .
I:18462;131;Especially great for a film buff like me are the hefty special features and even a copy of the screenplay.
I:18462;132;It's a great film and it's opening moments were accidentally mutilated by the blu ray mfr.
I:18462;133;Very excited by the song.
I:18462;134;What again another classic film, this is one of my wife's most favourite films, and what a super 50th anniversary Edition box set, Super fast delivery, many many thanks.
I:18462;135;I still believe west Side Story is the the best musical ever invented, very well written, produced, entertaining, dancing, acting, and singing.
I:18462;136;It's just the best love story ever.
I:18462;137;The extras are great to have.
I:18462;138;A classic that should be in every home's movie collection.
I:18462;139;It made me laugh and it made me cry!
I:18462;140;It had amazing songs (most notably: Maria , America , and Cool, and Tonight. )
I:18462;141;The dancing is great as well!
I:18462;142;This is definitely one of my Top 10 movies.
I:18462;143;Shipped in a timely fashion.
I:18462;144;The disc was perfect and shows well.
I:18462;145;Good value for the money paid

I:18462;147;I say, it is the best I have ever seen.
I:18462;148;the movie has such wonderful songs, acting, and yes, dancing.
I:18462;149;Does this movie's choreography dazzle the viewer and create a dramatic atmosphere perfect in which to recreate one of the best love stories of all time?
I:18462;150;I watch this movie and still find hidden meanings.
I:18462;151;kids my age should all watch this movie, as should everyone.
I:18462;152;If you look past the gangs dancing (which, by the way, can be one of the purest and most beautiful forms of human expression ever), you will see a classic film, one that should be seen by everyone with a social conscience.
I:18462;153;West Side Story is one of the best films ever made.
I:18462;154;I had intended to send him his card and clue him into the fact that a gift was coming, but the sender was so quick, my grandson got the gift before the card!
I:18462;155;forgot how great this musical was from the 50's.
I:18462;156;great doing business with you.
I:18462;157;It got ten academy awards, including best picture.
I:18462;158;born, but probably second generation Polish, Italian and the like.
I:18462;159;But even the fights are carefully choreographed dances, and this creates an agreeable unreality, which is heightened by sets and lighting and costumes and everything.
I:18462;160;the story is basically told in its songs, and they are beautiful.
I:18462;161;When you're a Jet it's the swingingest thing.
I:18462;162;He anticipates something wonderful is coming to him.
I:18462;163;Puerto Rico, you lovely island, Always the hurricanes blowing, and the money owing, and the babies crying, and the bullets flying.
I:18462;164;"I like to be in America, OK by me in America, Everything's free in America sings Anita, and Bernardo finishes the line ""For a small fee in America."
I:18462;165;Dear kindly Sergeant Krupke you gotta understand, it's just our bringing upkey that gets us out of hand.
I:18462;166;I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel giddy and witty and bright, and I pity any girl who isn't me tonight.
I:18462;167;Then Tony sneaks in the back door and they play with the dummies that display wedding gear, introducing Mama and Papa, and Anita as maid of honor, Biff as best man.
I:18462;168;The two gangs have agreed that it's going to be a fair fight between Bernardo on behalf of the Sharks and Ice on behalf of the Jets.
I:18462;169;one of the most unrealistic scenes and songs is Play It Cool, sung by Ice to Action to explain that that's what the Jets will need when the cops start asking questions.
I:18462;170;Maria counters with I Have a Love, and Anita accepts it.
I:18462;171;Just as they come together, Chino shows up and shoots him.
I:18462;172;It's one of my favorite movies.
I:18462;173;The music is so memorable and the dancing even better!!
I:18462;174;Love it, Love it Love it!!!
I:18462;175;watching the Sharks vs. the Jets singing, dancing was fantastic.
I:18462;176;West Side Story is, of course, a masterpiece.
I:18462;177;the documentary disc accompanying the feature film, remarkably, is as inspiring as the movie itself.
I:18462;178;The story of the collaboration between the creative geniuses and performers who made this classic could stand on its own merits.
I:18462;179;scenes treats, including a fascinating documentary about the making of thte film, Natalie Wood's not.
I:18462;180;I have a new respect for this wonderful film now that I have seen how much preparation, thought and hard work went into it.
I:18462;181;It has to be the best musical film ever made, or at least in the top 10!
I:18462;182;West Side Story is probably one of the greatest musicals of all time.
I:18462;183;movies go, this is one of the best examples of it.
I:18462;184;Bernstein's music and Sondheim's lyrics created a masterpiece in West Side Story.
I:18462;185;amazing clarity, color and details things that we'd never noticed before in many previous viewings.
I:18462;186;It's one of those rare movies that keep defying their age.
I:18462;187;The film West Side Story received ten Academy Awards in 1961 and could easily have won more.
I:18462;188;It is as powerful and as graceful today as it was when it first premi red.
I:18462;189;A musical that combines drama, ballet, humor, poetry, irony, and some spectacularly tasteful camera effects, West Side Story boasts a score by Leonard Bernstein, lyrics by Stephen Sondheim, on.
I:18462;190;site filming on Manhattan's lower West Side, and superb choreography with the expert directorship of Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins.
I:18462;191;The film was probably Natalie Wood's best performance in the role of immigrant girl Maria, newly arrived in New York from Puerto Rico, totally unaware of the hostilities in her new surroundings.
I:18462;192;Bernardo draws a knife, and soon both sides draw knives.
I:18462;193;She sees he is wounded and asks if he has been fighting.
I:18462;194;Tony stays with Maria until he hears Anita arriving.
I:18462;195;Anita enters, looks around, and sees Tony in the distance.
I:18462;196;"In the duet that follows, ""A Boy Like That,"" Anita expresses her anger for Maria's betrayal, and Maria answers the paradox of love in ""I Have a Love,"" one of the most rare and beautiful moments of modern musical theater."
I:18462;197;Anita leaves so that Maria can talk with the police.
I:18462;198;The final scene is particularly heart wrenching and is one that the viewer must see to appreciate fully.

I:18462;221;It is a fine reminder of how relationships were, how they still are, and hopefully, what they can become .
I:18462;222;West Side Story is an outstanding movie, even in the context of modern works.
I:18462;223;There's a very cute and touching scene where they meet up in the clothing store where Maria works, and they pretend to get married.
I:18462;224;There is also an incredible amount of choreography from beginning to end.
I:18462;225;this movie also makes a powerful statement on a number of issues including love, brotherhood, loyalty, and poverty.

I:18462;228;up to reading and watching Romeo and Juliet), but they were absolutely riveted and were inspired by how powerful a reinterpreted story could be.
I:18462;229;It helped them to be more creative when I had them reinterpret the story in their own ways.
I:18462;230;I insisted that my family watch this beautiful, rich urban adaptation of Shakespeare's classic Romeo and Juliet .
I:18462;231;I just love the energy, dancing and the awesome music.
I:18462;232;Although I am in my mid.30's, I grew up watching a lot of musicals thanks to my mom.
I:18462;233;That being said, this is one of my favorite musicals of all time, along with South Pacific and An American In Paris.
I:18462;234;i have owned the VHS (and the soundtrack), but this is the best version available that I have seen.
I:18462;235;The color is beautiful, the bonus disc will make any WSS fan smile and the accompanying book has tons of photos and the screenplay.
I:18462;236;There are several musicals that will be standouts for the ages.
I:18462;237;It has a plot involved with all the dancing .
I:18462;238;the chemistry between Richard and Natalie is non.
I:18462;239;Considering Larry Kert was gay his Tony did a much better job convincing me he loved Maria then Richard Beymer's.
I:18462;240;"what I did like was swapping ""Cool"" and ""Gee, Officer Krupke""."
I:18462;241;"It suits the show a lot more to have a tense song like ""Cool"" in the second act."
I:18462;242;the orchestrations are great, sometimes better than the original OBC.
I:18462;243;"America is reshaped to be a sparring match between the Sharks and their girls, great restaging, although the lyrics don't flow as well and my favourite line was cutRosalia: ""When I will go back to San Juan""Anita: ""When you will shut."
I:18462;244;i added a star for the extras, very detailed and well presented, I especially liked the making of and interviews.
I:18462;245;I waited for some time for a good price and it arrived.
I:18462;246;Same great transfer, but with the extra items.
I:18462;247;The music is so good, the choreography so compelling that even the mediocre performances.
I:18462;248;I have loved West Side Story since i was a kid but what I really love about this collectors set is that it comes with a documentary that is full of information about the making of the movie.
I:18462;249;The troubles, what makes it so special, and just the trivia that i love so much.
I:18462;250;There were also recordings of Natalie Wood actually singing her parts.
I:18462;251;This collector's edition is now a most cherished part of my movie library.
I:18462;252;The story is as it always has been, at least for me, heart wrecking, but very refreshing as to how this sort of discrimination has not ended, and I think it never will.
I:18462;253;I always cry and get angry with Maria (I am from a latin country) The history of the movie and the pictures are great.
I:18462;254;Loved the singing, choreography, and music.
I:18462;255;i would recommend this to anyone who loves the old musicals.
I:18462;256;west Side Story is fantastic.
I:18462;257;It's actually the story that counts.
I:18462;258;the sets and dance numbers are incredible.
I:18462;259;get your kids into classic films, my 7 y/o loved it, yes there are fights and knives but believe me it's all done in a very tasteful way.
I:18462;260;executed to work and to impress audiences and critics alike.
I:18462;261;This is a triumph of mayor proportions in the history of cinema, and now, with the release of its delicious Blu.
I:18462;262;ray edition, this important film looks better than ever .
I:18462;263;the film's beginning and end are just astonishing and original, as the story itself.
I:18462;264;The first group, of course, believed that the second was invading their turf.
I:18462;265;jets who has reformed himself and is living a decent life.
I:18462;266;between all this rubble, there is the magnificent and fiery Anita (Rita Moreno).
I:18462;267;West Side Story is many things at once: a well.
I:18462;268;"elaborated musical, which mixes the reality of the times with music and dance
I:18462;269;The result is just fascinating in every sense.
I:18462;270;The music works, the message works, and the dancing works .
I:18462;271;And then there is the excellent, colorful and masterful cinematography by Daniel Fapp.
I:18462;272;The film won ten Academy Awards in 1961, including Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor (Chakiris) and Best Supporting Actress (Moreno, who steals her scenes).
I:18462;273;The story is a good one and a must see for young and old alike!
I:18462;274;Natalie Wood does an amazing job overall
I:18462;275;I really enjoyed the music.
I:18462;276;This is a timeless tale.
I:18462;277;my experience with the vendor is successful because the arrival time was good the protection of article was correct and arrived without a scratchthanks
I:18462;278;Most of them liked it.
I:18462;279;Legendary filmakers combined their talents to make this milestone musical.
I:18462;280;Direction, Choreography, Casting, Writing, Its all here.
I:18462;281;the opening shot tells us that this is a Robert Wise Film.
I:18462;282;For those who were extremly lucky to see this on Broadway with its initial company best regards,,,for the rest of us who want to revisit .
I:18462;283;"This overrated classic musical lifts Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet"" storyline, and muddles it with a cold romance and gangs that were dated even at the film's world premiere."
I:18462;284;the positives are what made the film a classic.
I:18462;285;The songs are excellent, using Stephen Sondheim's lyrics to carry the emotions of the characters.
I:18462;286;The dancing and ballet choreography are superb.
I:18462;287;fighting, but the pure athleticism on the part of the dancers is fantastic.
I:18462;288;Rarely have dance numbers been so physical, and so grand.
I:18462;289;He thinks he is scoring a bombastic Broadway song even in quiet moments.
I:18462;290;It is squarely in the middle of the spectrum.
I:18462;291;I watched this back when I was younger and wanted to share it with my children.
I:18462;292;Thank you for sending me this in a timely matter.
I:18462;293;This is a great Romeo and Juliet story set in NYC.
I:18462;294;Great dancing, singing and acting!
I:18462;295;I probably wouldn't like it if I was 20 or 30, but I was a teen when it came out, dating the love of my life, the good memories were a big part of the good movie.
I:18462;296;Great musical to have in your collection .
I:18462;297;having it in blu ray is an added bonus!
I:18462;298;songs you are still singing for weeks afterward.
I:18462;299;Fans of the musical West Side Story should enjoy this box set complete with the entire script of the film and special features including a look back at the making of West Side Story.
I:18462;300;The commentary is interesting and brings insight to the directors' intentions as well as an appreciation of the hard work of everyone involved with this film.
I:18462;301;I've always loved that movie!
I:18462;302;It made an impression on us, hubby too!
I:18462;303;I would definitely recommend if you liked the movie The Notebook
I:18462;304;The movie is a classic so we wanted our son to see it.
I:18462;305;This blockbuster film deservedly won ten academy awards.
I:18462;306;"One of the best movie musicals of all time
I:18462;307;The cast and their performances are magic.
I:18462;308;Of course I knew I loved it before I downloaded it!
I:18462;309;I did the show in high school and have loved it ever since!
I:18462;310;A classic for almost 50 years, this retelling of Shakespeare's tale of star.
I:18462;311;the plot is skilfully adapted from Shakespeare's original, with most of the elements still in place and a couple (particularly the characters of Anita (Rita Moreno), Maria's friend and Bernardo's girl, and Anybodys (Susan Oakes), the crop.
I:18462;312;But of course the best part of the movie is the songs.
I:18462;313;"the yearning ""Maria,"" ""Somewhere,"" and ""One Hand, One Heart,"" the sardonic ""America"" (though I personally think the original Broadway lyrics were better) and ""Gee, Officer Krupke!"
I:18462;314;"smart ""Jet Song"" and ""Cool""."
I:18462;315;This is a true classic of Hollywood musicals and one every fan of the genre should know.
I:18462;316;It has a gorgeous restored picture (important for visual effects during the gym dance and the rumble, which saturate the screen with the color red), and pristine sound.
I:18462;317;probably the most gorgeous score ever composed by Leonard Bernstein.
I:18462;318;"The songs ""Cool"" and ""I Feel Pretty"" are completely restaged from the original libretto, and the background score is given something of a theatrical makeover."
I:18462;319;And the dancing, of course, is peerless.
I:18462;320;"whether it's the ""Cool"" dance in the garage, the ""America"" battle of the sexes featuring the Sharks, or even the delicate rooftop solo performed by Natalie Wood."
I:18462;321;radiant and bewitching in a white dress.
I:18462;322;Best film of it's time!Even tho it was way before my time.
I:18462;323;meeting Rita Moreno, George Chakiris, Russ Tamblyn and Robert Banas from that films great too!
I:18462;324;The movie streamed right in and worked perfectly.
I:18462;325;The music is great, Romeo and Juliet in gangs instead of families.
I:18462;326;This product is very nice.
I:18462;327;It contains a blue ray production of the play and also includes a lot of added things.
I:18462;328;This was worth the amount paid for.
I:18462;329;Yet another Full Screen release of a great film shot in Widescreen 2.20:1.
I:18462;330;It gets 2 stars because even with half the image taken out it is still a great film.
I:18462;331;for anyone who loves this movie as much as I do, it's worth spending extra just to have this great package!
I:18462;332;If you want an entertaining evening of wonderful music and choreography, then this is the film for you.
I:18462;333;But Rita Moreno, on the other hand, is outstanding as the older and more worldly sister.
I:18462;334;Overall, this is an enjoyable film based on a classic romance.
I:18462;335;One of my all time favorite movies.
I:18462;336;The music, the story, the imagery.
I:18462;337;It's just a beautiful movie to enjoy over and over.
I:18462;338;For me, that makes it more heartbreaking.
I:18462;339;both for great music and dance, and also if you want to think.
I:18462;340;West SIde Story is a modern rendition of the classic tale of Romeo and Juliet, which is made even better by the addition of music.
I:18462;341;The cast makes it even better, with the beautiful Natalie Wood playing the star.
I:18462;342;crossed lover Maria, and Richard Beymer as her ill.
I:18462;343;fated escort Tony, passionate support being given by Rita Moreno.
I:18462;344;I would recommend this to everyone, no matter whether they are interested in romance, drama, or music.
I:18462;345;It has to be both.
I:18462;346;This recording worked well in my classroom, and was exactly what we needed to end our theater unit.
I:18462;347;More than a musical, more than a film or a play, West Side Story represents a view of life in New York City experienced by the Sharks and the Jets seen through their mythical eyes and told in real terms as only they knew it.
I:18462;348;The portrayal of these rival gangs transcends time and reflects what we discover in our largest cities today.
I:18462;349;West Side Story is uniquely American, the ups and downs of inner.
I:18462;350;A classic musical created for stage and film more than five decades ago and truly as fresh, enlightening and entertaining today.
I:18462;351;i ordered this as a gift.
I:18462;352;it was a good price and it got there earlier than expected and she's very happy with it.
I:18462;353;the movie itself is great :) I can't get I Feel Pretty out of my head though.
I:18462;354;West Side Story, released in 1961, is a great adaptation of the Broadway musical thanks to producer and director Robert Wise (Jerome Robbins also directed).
I:18462;355;The film earned ten Oscars including Best Picture.
I:18462;356;lasting impact has made it a worthy classic.
I:18462;357;The lyrics and the musical theme wonderfully blend with the plot, and every musical detail adds a wonderful unforgettable touch to every scene.
I:18462;358;The dancing gives these songs additional meaning while enacting the storyline.
I:18462;359;All these film details give great homage to the original Broadway stage version.
I:18462;360;The plot romances the love scenes beautifully while intensifying the vocal and physical battle scenes wonderfully.
I:18462;361;the actors and singers perform their roles wonderfully.
I:18462;362;Though not every actor actually sang, the overall performances were spectacular, namely Rita Moreno (Anita) and George Chakiris (Bernado) in their Oscar winning roles (Best Supporting Actress/ Best Supporting Actor).
I:18462;363;Beymer (Tony) and Wood (Maria) contain the special chemistry between them that makes the love theme more romantic.
I:18462;364;Their charm gives their characters and the film the added beauty.
I:18462;365;All other actors give the film the added individual touch.
I:18462;366;West Side Story is a great musical for genre fans to watch.
I:18462;367;This is sure to continue pleasing audiences for many more years.
I:18462;368;Such combination makes a great entertainment experience.
I:18462;369;"Inarguably ""West Side Story"" is the greatest American musical film ever, hands down."
I:18462;370;"Singing in the Rain is the greatest musical without stage origins but ""West Side Story"" transcends it's stage roots to far surpass any other musical."
I:18462;371;The stars alligned for this film and it works on all cylinders.
I:18462;372;Robert Wise's direction is fluid.
I:18462;373;Jerome Robbins' choreography is vibrant and life affirming.
I:18462;374;The music score by Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim is transcendent without a bum note in the bunch.
I:18462;375;Boris Leven's spare but evocative art direction is a marvel to behold.
I:18462;376;The performances here are a marvel to behold.
I:18462;377;Russ Tamblyn, Richard Beymer, Rita Moreno and George Chakiris are simply brilliant.
I:18462;378;Wood's casting may smack of commercial considerations but she was one of the finest actresses of her generation and is more than adequate here.
I:18462;379;One of the best musicals every made and I got this at a GREAT price.
I:18462;380;This is an excellent musical displaying all the broadway characteristics from its original stage production of 1959.
I:18462;381;"Classic songs nclude Maria 
I:18462;382;A memorable movie that you will want to watch again and again.
I:18462;383;It's amazing that a film made forty years ago still has such relevance.
I:18462;384;It's ability to entertain and make the viewer think about racism and social issues is timeless.
I:18462;385;Rita Moreno steals the show as Anita with her unsurpassed dancing and acting skills showcased beautifully.
I:18462;386;All the players are magnificent and this film changed forever the way we see the movie musical.
I:18462;387;West Side Story is among the greatest.
I:18462;388;ever movie musicals, glorious winner of the 1961 Best Picture Oscar and nine other Academy Awards.

I:18462;393;plugging, and multiple acts of turning the Blu.
I:18462;394;"All that matters is how glorious ""West Side Story"" appeared with video and audio in synchronization."
I:18462;395;I saw this movie when I was a kid and I continue to return to it.
I:18462;396;The acting, plot and music combined to leave leave, each time I see this, with a joy and sense of entertainment.
I:18462;397;this is a whole new movie.
I:18462;398;but this is a winner.
I:18462;399;i put it up there with some of the best.
I:18462;400;how many BD's are as great as those.
I:18462;401;The pic and audio are superb.

I:18462;406;we know the story of this film but what's important for you to know about here are the extras you get in this package that make it worth your while: The first disc is the film, preserved perfectly.
I:18462;407;And the second disc has your special features.
I:18462;408;first, you get a great documentary on the making of the film.
I:18462;409;Lots of other goodies, like the theatrical trailers and photos galore.
I:18462;410;it's simply a valentine to a remarkable film, and a fantastic package, all the way around.
I:18462;411;The music is unforgettable and truly classic.
I:18462;412;I recall an early viewing of this 1961 classic.
I:18462;413;"i write this on the eve of the 50th anniversary of ""West Side Story's "" Broadway debut."
I:18462;414;white youths led by their leader, Riff (the energetic, back.
I:18462;415;they begin to stroll away from the playground, and via Jerome Robbin's expressive choreography, display their delight in the thing that gives these disadvantaged youths a sense of indentity and solidarity: Being a Jet.
I:18462;416;irritated by the prospect of losing their turf to newcomers, the Jets reaffirm their solidarity in song, and Riff has a consultation with his best friend and Jets co. founder, Tony (a stunningly handsome Richard Beymer) who despite his days as a gang member, has moved on and taken a job as a delivery boy in a local drugstore run by Doc(Ned Glass), a sweet old man, weary of gang rivalries.
I:18462;417;He tells Riff about a strange sense of anticipation he has about some mysteriously wonderful event in his life, which Riff suggests might make itself eminent at the dance.
I:18462;418;tempered and strong Natalie Wood, whose singing is dubbed by Marni Nixon), who was brought to America for an arranged marriage with gang member, Chino (Jose de Vega) is also anticipating the dance.
I:18462;419;He walks home from the dance, dazed and singing.
I:18462;420;after another confrontation with Officer Krupke, the Jets have their own moment of levity, poking fun at all the reasons psychoanalysts give for their delinquent behavior.
I:18462;421;Schrank arrives, expressing distain for the Sharks, and provoking members of the Jets with reminders of family issues that fuel their anger.
I:18462;422;Tony Mordente's Action could be the perfect inner city school teacher if he can control his rage, Tucker Smith's Ice seethes with raw charisma, and Eliot Feld's Baby John is a reluctant gang member.
I:18462;423;hours encounter with the young seamstress and agrees to keep quiet.
I:18462;424;The two lovers imagine a wedding, and Tony agrees to stop the rumble.
I:18462;425;"It is a technique later used in the musical ""Les Miserables"" with the song, ""One Day More"" to great effect."
I:18462;426;Advice from Susan Oakes' Anybody's, who embodies the human need for acceptance, proves helpful.
I:18462;427;relevant cautionary tale that will be enjoyed for many years to come.
I:18462;428;A pleasure to do business with.
I:18462;429;She really wanted this 50th Anniversary Edition for a keepsake.
I:18462;430;It pleased her to receive it, so that made us happy too.
I:18462;431;I recommend it to anyone who loved this movie, or anyone who never did get to see it.
I:18462;432;it beats watching it in a theater!!
I:18462;433;The opening shots of NYC offer some shimmering but afterwards, everything is perfect!!
I:18462;434;and this transfer is pretty close to what I saw originally.
I:18462;435;"Recommended for music buffs and Natalie Wood fans alike (she had a banner year with this film and ""{Splendor In The Grass"")."
I:18462;436;The opening scene with the shots of New York City from above were absolutely INCREDIBLE!
I:18462;437;The sound was fantastick, and the classic movie in Blue Ray is so worth the time.
I:18462;438;This film may be dated in some ways, but it is still pure pleasure to watch!
I:18462;439;This is a good musical.
I:18462;440;I got it because I had heard some of the songs, and had always wanted to see the movie.
I:18462;441;The client is very pleased.
I:18462;442;This ia a very intense, fast moving story in which many of the scenes easily could have happened in real life in New York at that time.
I:18462;443;My favorite musicals are those from 1950.1970 and of all the great ones like Oklahoma, South Pacific, and the Sound of Music, West Side Story impresses me as the most exciting dramatic musical of all time.
I:18462;444;For a fast moving drama this is a classic against which to compare other musical drama.
I:18462;445;The producers certainly succeeded in bringing up to date the Romeo and Juliet saga.
I:18462;446;The romance and tragedy of Tony and Maria will always be indelibly impressed in my mind.
I:18462;447;this is a musical that deserves to be seen on a big screen (or at least a big screen tv with a killer sound system) to be appreciated for the wonderful score.
I:18462;448;Forget the idea of Natalie Wood playing a Puerto Rican and enjoy a great movie.
I:18462;449;And see the stage production if it ever comes to your town.
I:18462;450;Without a doubt this is one of the top five movies musicals of all time, if not number one.
I:18462;451;The score, the choreography, the direction, the performances, all of them are flawless.
I:18462;452;The screen play improves greatly upon the original show's book and is much tighter.
I:18462;453;This is a true work of art, and one that will be remembered for years to come.
I:18462;454;The classic love story and the story of gangs in NY City at a certain time and in a dancing stage production.
I:18462;455;These were great date movies shown on the giant theater screens.
I:18462;456;The dancing in this movie take my breath away.
I:18462;457;This is a fantastic movie and deserves all the praise it recieves.
I:18462;458;Left an incredible memory on me that I revisited with this Blu.
I:18462;459;Price is excellent (anniversary was two years ago, so it's discounted greatly).
I:18462;460;Bought this for my young niece who's an aspiring actress as an example of the pinnacle of musical.
I:18462;461;It is one of my favorites and now it's one of her's!
I:18462;462;West Side Story remains one of the most powerful, compelling and exceptional musicals ever brought from the stage to the screen.
I:18462;463;for starters, the music is great and stands the test of time.
I:18462;464;"It has beautiful love ballads (""Maria,"" ""One Hand, One Heart,"" ""Somewhere""), star."
I:18462;465;"crossed lovers (Maria, a young Puerto Rican girl, who has connections to the Sharks, a Puerto Rican gang and Tony, a young Polish boy, who has connections to the Jets, a Polish gang), fiery and passionate dance numbers (""America"" is a wonderful example of the beautiful choreography, transferred directly from the stage to the screen, by the legendary, late, great Jerome Robbins) and a compelling message about the cautionary effects of hatred in the face of love."
I:18462;466;this film was definitely worthy of the ten Academy Awards in 1961 (one being for Best Supporting Actress, Rita Moreno.
I:18462;467;I really feel this film is timeless in its universal story of love, tragedy and life.
I:18462;468;I forgot how wonderful this movie musical was.
I:18462;469;I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend to musical lovers everywhere
I:18462;470;I saw it in high school for the first time, in my film study class.
I:18462;471;And instantly I was hooked.
I:18462;472;This is one of the great classics that almost nobody has ever actually seen.
I:18462;473;It stands as Leonard Bernstein's greatest accomplishment outside of the concert hall.
I:18462;474;For me to give a musical 5 stars is, therefore, somewhat profound.
I:18462;475;For fans of Bernstein and Wood this movie is a must.
I:18462;476;The songs are memorable and the story is timeless!
I:18462;477;A great remake of a good movie.
I:18462;478;It draws you in just as good now as when it was first released.
I:18462;479;The dances still astound and the opening images as well as the end titles are still powerful and eloquent.
I:18462;480;Thank you Natalie Wood and the rest of the people involved with producing this movie.
I:18462;481;I have the screen play right in my hands with the little booklet that comes with it!
I:18462;482;my wife and i enjoyed this classic.
I:18462;483;i mainly got the movie because my wife had never seen it before.
I:18462;484;There is no getting around the fact that this 1961 musical melodrama is a monumental work by theater masters at their peak .
I:18462;485;"Leonard Bernstein's timeless music
I:18462;486;"driven lyrics
I:18462;487;Fortunately, all of this is beautifully captured on the pristine 70.
I:18462;488;Starting with the highly dramatic overhead shots of Manhattan, the prologue is justly celebrated as a stunning expression of Robbins' genius in formulating dance moves that fluently convey the gangs' swagger and menace.
I:18462;489;as the story settles on the core romance, the movie maintains its momentum and high energy through the memorable score, in particular, the three powerful ensemble pieces .
I:18462;490;"America, in which the Sharks boys and girls playfully but pointedly argue the merits of living in the U. s.
I:18462;491;"cutting showing the diverse shades of anticipation for the final rumble
I:18462;492;What holds the music and action together is the strongly individualistic visual style set forth by Daniel Fapp's color.
I:18462;493;saturated cinematography (the reds really pop) and Boris Leven's impressive production design (only the prologue was filmed on location).
I:18462;494;hip dialogue that now sounds quaint next to today's youth.
I:18462;495;oriented movies, the story still maintains a dramatic gravitas that has certainly worked since Shakespeare's day.
I:18462;496;Carrying most of the pathos of the love story, she completely nails the final tragic scene with tear.
I:18462;497;Russ Tamblyn, already a longtime film veteran at that point, plays Tony's best friend Riff with gusto and shows off his amazing acrobatic dancing skills with fervor.
I:18462;498;George Chakiris, a far more polished dancer than Tamblyn, is a searing presence as Bernardo, though the best all.
I:18462;499;Singing (with one notable exception), dancing and acting up a storm, she lends a scene.
I:18462;500;The rest of the dancers perform in nova.
I:18462;501;like bursts with amazing precision and synchronization.
I:18462;502;"long documentary called ""West Side Memories"", which is about as good a retrospective making."
I:18462;503;When you take a great composer, a great lyricist, a great choreographer, a great director, a pretty talented young acting team, and a story with universal themes and a respect for the pacing and structure of classical theatre, it is impossible not to produce one of the greatest films of all time.

I:18462;508;"All I know is that on my 100"" screen and state of the art sound system, this film looks and sounds better than ever on Blu Ray."
I:18462;509;Timeless classic, unforgettable cast and a recreation of best love story ever written (Romeo and Juliet).
I:18462;510;Beautifully written lyrics and performances which will always be remembered and past down from one generation to the next.
I:18462;511;This is simply one of the best movies of all times.
I:18462;512;The end of this movie actually brought me to tears!
I:18462;513;The Sharks are Puerto Ricans who have just moved to America and are trying to establish themselves in the new territory.
I:18462;514;Anita, Maria's best friend, and Bernardo try to convince Maria to stop loving Tony, but Maria can't help it!
I:18462;515;Tempers flair and Bernardo and Riff are killed in a fight.
I:18462;516;The choreography is great and the music awesome.
I:18462;517;I feel pretty, Tonight, and Somewhere are some of my favorites!
I:18462;518;Got this for my 15 year old granddaughter for Christmas and she loves it.
I:18462;519;as to the movie, it is as beautiful as ever.
I:18462;520;If you love movies or musicals you will enjoy this one.
I:18462;521;Natalie Wood remains stunning and timeless.
I:18462;522;In the newly restored format, it's worth seeing again and again.
I:18462;523;This is an amazing transfer to blu ray.
I:18462;524;my sister is a big fan of musicals, and this was one she just had to have.
I:18462;525;If you are into musicals, definitely see this one.
I:18462;526;I find most musicals absolutely annoyingly sweet.
I:18462;527;"One of the few musicals that I like is ""West Side Story""."
I:18462;528;I first saw this classic was in my high school english AP class.
I:18462;529;"i love ""West Side Story"" so much is because of Leonard and Bernstein's music and the choreography."
I:18462;530;The songs are infectious and the choreography so lively.
I:18462;531;I also enjoyed performances by a young Natalie Wood, Rita Moreno, Richard Beymer, George Chaklis, and Russ Tamblin.
I:18462;532;For me it is a timeless classic.
I:18462;533;I was happy with the delivery of the product.
I:18462;534;This is a great redone movie and a story you can watch over and over, mainly because of the songs.
I:18462;535;The choreography is beautiful, the music is beautiful, the lyrics are fantastic, the acting and singing are magnificent and it is timeless!
I:18462;536;A perfectly crafted Romeo and Juliet story that will out live most other tragic love stories well into the future.
I:18462;537;Everytime I see it I fall in love with it all over again.
I:18462;538;The best musical film score ever!
I:18462;539;I really enjoyed viewing this classic.
I:18462;540;I recommend it for pre.
I:18462;541;"I go through the house humming ""Maria"" and all the other fabulous songs from this delightful movie."
I:18462;542;The movie is, as we all know, fantastic.
I:18462;543;Mastered from the original 70mm film stock, the images are pristine, beautifully saturated, and tack sharp.
I:18462;544;Naively, the lovers believe they can get away and be happy forever.
I:18462;545;This is a very good film for the most part and many of the songs are great, sticking with you afterwards.
I:18462;546;This is a wonderful movie whichever way you may see it: wether you like musicals, drama, dance, romance, or simply looking for cinematographical masterful direction or production, this is a must have in anyone's collection.
I:18462;547;Seen more than 18 times, I'm always surprised, emotionaly speaking, by the beauty and the strength of choregraphy and music.
I:18462;548;2 big moments: the gorgeous imitation of sergeant Krupke by the Jets, and the emotional and vibrant garage choregraphy after the 'struggle'.
I:18462;549;Thanks to R. wise and L. bertsein for their emotion.
I:18462;550;Wise's and Robbins' changes from the stage show improved the flow of the tension and added to the cinematic experience.
I:18462;551;Colors are vibrant and rich.
I:18462;552;Certainly the best this film has ever looked on any home entertainmet format.
I:18462;553;The box set is packed with lots of goodies for any fan.
I:18462;554;This Collector's Set is a real treat for fans of this very well made film.
I:18462;555;Included in the set is a great book containing the entire screenplay which I had fun following along reading while I watched the movie.
I:18462;556;finally, a Collector's Set with something truly worth collecting!
I:18462;557;The bonus disc contains very nice documentaries on how the film was made with excellent interviews of the cast and crew as well.
I:18462;558;this film is that rare musical that has excellent music and choreography as well as a good storyline.
I:18462;559;"Oklahoma for example has great music but a weaker storyline and it's the same with say ""Phantom of the Opera"" but ""West Side Story"" is very well balanced with great drama in what is essentially Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet"" retold in a modern setting as well as brilliant dance and song sequences."
I:18462;560;"Although the singing has been overdubbed by ""better"" singers the overall acting of the cast and especially that of Natalie Wood is first class."
I:18462;561;this is one Collector's set to shout about and is certainly value for money.
I:18462;562;Just a little musical introduction, an overture if you will.
I:18462;563;everybody that considers themselves a fan of Broadway Musicals has a favorite.
I:18462;564;Seldom, if ever is a film version of a Broadway musical as good as the stage production.
I:18462;565;But that's all you need.
I:18462;566;But I do use pause a lot so that I can compose myself now and then.
I:18462;567;I don't care if you love it for the music, the dance or just the beautiful people in the cast, you are going to love this simple presentation of what I consider one of the finest pieces of American art ever created.
I:18462;568;It was actually more exciting on stage.
I:18462;569;But the film does the play justice and captures much of the play's excitement.
I:18462;570;The score, by Leonard Bernstein, is by far his best.
I:18462;571;(On The Waterfront is right behind).
I:18462;572;I love the opening, the overture, the lines on the giant screen that eventually become New York City.
I:18462;573;Oldie but goodie at a great price!
I:18462;574;choreographer Jerome Robbins, WEST SIDE STORY blew Broadway audiences away with its startling mixture of gritty dance, Latin and jazz.
I:18462;575;By and large, the 1950s and 1960s were tough on the musical, and those who worked in the genre struggled to move it from the frothy confections of the 1940s into something more relevant to contemporary audiences that favored an often noir.
I:18462;576;the first fifteen minutes or so of the film are arguably its best: a dance sequence that shows the clash of the rival gangs, the Jets and the Sharks, filmed on location in New York and capturing some of the best choreography ever put upon the screen.
I:18462;577;But once the ballet ends, the look of the film becomes remarkably stagey, the bulk of the scenes very obviously shot on sound stages and clashing with the style and tone of portions shot on location.
I:18462;578;That said, however, the dance sequences are stunning, the score can still run chills up your spine, and the cast.
I:18462;579;ranges from exceptional to at minimum rock solid.
I:18462;580;but both give artful performances and (Wood in particular) are successful in bringing it off.
I:18462;581;and an incredible dance ensemble that simply explodes across the screen with tremendous grace and power.
I:18462;582;"the Special Edition Collector's Set will please most fans of the film
I:18462;583;out, as unexpected today as it was when it first roared onto the Great White Way.
I:18462;584;u. copia is what makes the musical a musical.
I:18462;585;This film tells us why Leonard Bernstein was the greatest classical composer of his time.
I:18462;586;I knew I was watching something great.
I:18462;587;The oscar winning performances of Rita Moreno and George Chakiris was well deserved.
I:18462;588;The greatest musical ever filmed!
I:18462;589;cultural romance is very contemporary, whilebeing timeless.
I:18462;590;The reason anyone should see this is because Marni Nixon dubs Natalie Wood, and also because of Rita Moreno, who gives a charming performance as usual.
I:18462;591;The story was amazing (but seemed familiar .
I:18462;592;The acting was very, very good, but not quite perfect.
I:18462;593;The music and the dancing wre wonderful.
I:18462;594;I love watching this movie as much today as I did when it first came out.
I:18462;595;The music, dancing and story have always touched my heart.
I:18462;596;Witching it brought back old times.
I:18462;597;And just as great as watching it at the movies.
I:18462;598;i love this movie and this being the first thing i have ordered i was worried the disc would be scratched but it wasn't and i was happy that is why i choose 5 stars so thank you amazon you helped bring back my love for this movie
I:18462;599;40th comes with more information of the production.
I:18462;600;I had seen this movie when younger and loved it.
I:18462;601;I hope she enjoys it as much as I did.
I:18462;602;Good actors and actresses with a variety of music.
I:18462;603;West Side Story has wonderful music and brilliant dancing/choreography.
I:18462;604;synced, but still solid entertainment.
I:18462;605;This reminds me of my day growing up in NY city.
I:18462;606;those youthful days of wonder and excitement.
I:18462;607;This is a marvelous film,from the beginning to the tragic end, and it encompasses all the best that a show can offer.
I:18462;608;gangs, and a love which is doomed, especially in this kind of Romeo and Juliet love story.
I:18462;609;Then there's the dancing, and Chakiris shines, as well as does the ensemble cast.
I:18462;610;Natalie Wood is wonderful as Maria, and she brings a flair to this young role unlike any other film which has tried to duplicate its success.
I:18462;611;an outstanding achievement, and when you add this film to your library, you'll want to revisit it periodically, especially as the story and the songs enter your heart.
I:18462;612;This is truly a message for our times, and in another respect, this story is timeless.
I:18462;613;My goodness, after wearing out my old VHS copy, it was amazing to see this in such clarity.
I:18462;614;hour documentary and production home movies and stills were fascinating!!!
I:18462;615;a great picture with a great actress, one of the most beautiful of the whole hollywood story since the beginning
I:18462;616;This is probably my favorite musical ever.
I:18462;617;sequences survive(America), as do the four young stars.
I:18462;618;How delightful to hear music one can actually sing along with.
I:18462;619;I would prefer to see the original Broadway cast in the film version.
I:18462;620;Robert Wise made his masterpiece with this film mixing the essential spirit of the shakesperian mood , recreating it in the modern times as a racial conflict.
I:18462;621;wise mixed the drama with a credible plot .
I:18462;622;the sequence fights between the bunchs is perfect articulated , there is a fine balance between drama and music.
I:18462;623;With one viewing you will be humming the songs.
I:18462;624;"I Love this Film, it is that Rare Masterpiece, One that is truly watchable many times, never boring, Interesting Characters, Plot, and Great Music
I:18462;625;"Tony meets up with Maria soon after, atop a Fire Escape by Her Family's Loft, He tells Maria He loves Her, Maria wisely tells Him ""it's early"", but She is clearly smitten with Tony, and the next afternoon at Her Workplace (a Dress Shop) She is Giddy in Love, singing ""I feel pretty"", Tony Meets Her at 6 p. m. Closing Time and They hold a mock Wedding Ceremony in the Dress Shop."
I:18462;626;an extremely Naive scene, but again, I'm feeling it as I watch, and bleeding a Tear or Two.
I:18462;627;I first watched it in one of the high school English classes, and have been hooked ever since.
I:18462;628;He puts so much passion and life into Riff, that it broke my heart when he died.
I:18462;629;Also this musical has some great songs in it.
I:18462;630;Whether the characters are singing about love, (Tonight, Somewhere) agrueing about where life is better, (America) or just making fun of the adults, (Gee Officer Krupke)the characters bring it all to life.
I:18462;631;I would recommend this musical to anyone who is in the mood for a great movie about love and life, and bring a hankie, trust me, you'll need it
I:18462;632;This movie is a classic!
I:18462;633;Fabulous dancing, great songs, wonderful acting.
I:18462;634;Completely restored version with vivid colors and sharp contrasts.
I:18462;635;Highly recommended with a decent price.
I:18462;636;Remember that Marnie Nixon is Natilie Wood's singing voice.
I:18462;637;So happy to see amazon put some real classics into the prime collection.
I:18462;638;Being a newbie to the multiple Oscar winner.
I:18462;639;Be that as it may, this is one aventurous flick!
I:18462;640;The long steady camera fixed visual overture creates the feel of a stage musical (probably that was the idea).
I:18462;641;Great performances across the board!
I:18462;642;At the end of the day, the legendary Leonard Bernstein score rules the day.
I:18462;643;Add to that some of the most passionate work ever by a young cast including Natalie Wood and Rita Moreno in her star.
I:18462;644;dazzlement moment, and it all clicks.
I:18462;645;Picture and sound are both great.)
I:18462;646;This film is a myth, like the musical it comes from.
I:18462;647;It is doomed to be a lasting success and hence a classic in its genre and in its field.
I:18462;648;of course it is a rewriting of Romeo and Juliet but with some kind of a twist.
I:18462;649;They all are born Mercutios.
I:18462;650;The musical was for an elite audience, that of the Broadway theatres.
I:18462;651;The film amplified the success of the musical.
I:18462;652;The spectator is supposed to let him/herself slide into that magic and enjoy both visually and auditorily but the heavy machinery that produces the lights, the amplification and the various physical elements of the show take you for a real dance and you may fly into the show.
I:18462;653;The very strong sentimental scenes and situations may carry your emotions away too.
I:18462;654;But that will remain moderate due to the distance between you and the characters.
I:18462;655;This real location is of course an enormous change because of the liberation it provides the actors, singers and dancers.
I:18462;656;the second change you perceive from the very start is of course the great mobility of the camera.
I:18462;657;You can shift from one angle to another instantly and that creates movement in the picture and on the screen since you are constantly capturing the situation from a myriad points of view.
I:18462;658;This acceleration of the camera's movements and multiplication of shooting angles really project you into the action or suck you up into it if your prefer and you are a lot more involved in the action, in the film.
I:18462;659;this is multiplied by the fact that the camera is constantly zooming onto faces and bombarding you with close.
I:18462;660;ups that enable you to see the facial expressions of the actors, their tears and their suffering, their joy and their pain.
I:18462;661;You are deeply moved in your own sentimental emotions by this closeness to the actors and you may not identify with one particularly actor or actress, but you definitely feel part of the situations that are constructed on the screen.
I:18462;662;sensorial, which makes you keep a mental reflective distance, especially since you constantly keep in mind Shakespeare and so many other love dramas you know, from the Titanic to Love Story.
I:18462;663;Note this empathy you feel in front of this film comes from your famous mirror neurons that make you project yourself into the emotions of other people.
I:18462;664;the film knows how to maintain this distance which is basic with a wide screen film.
I:18462;665;here the film very precisely uses some means to remind you how you must keep that mental reflective distance.
I:18462;666;the film also uses lights to create such a distance by building luminous situations that are not realistic like red lights under the highway.
I:18462;667;finally the credits at the end leave a fully realistic set behind and write most names as graffiti on brick walls, stone walls, concrete surface, palisades of all types and particularly a palisade only made up of old doors, to finish with road signs that are orders to turn left or not turn right, of stop, or not walk on the grass.
I:18462;668;There you know that you are in a film, that you have to keep a distance, that your mind is supposed to stay alert and fresh, and that you are supposed to come back on earth.
I:18462;669;the film is thus a perfect example of what can be done with a musical.
I:18462;670;It becomes a real film that associates a multi.
I:18462;671;sensorial experience and yet a mental reflective distance, and at the same time some acting conventions, the dancing and the singing, the music even, are there to both charm you and keep you alert.
I:18462;672;And you sure have quite a plateful of thinking to do all along the film and you are nourished and fed with the necessary energy to chew your food properly.
I:18462;673;Though i thought it was supposed to also come with the soundtrack for the price I was still very happy with the item.
I:18462;674;Just simply amazing from start to finish.
I:18462;675;The movie it self is a great achievement in movie making and we have never seen nothing like ti sicne.
I:18462;676;Overal a great film and one of the best films ever.
I:18462;677;But let me explain a bit further .
I:18462;678;I do realize that this silliness has its reasons, that the film has a message, and so on, but .
I:18462;679;the colour, shots, scenery, lighting 10/10.
I:18462;680;wow it must have been amazing.
I:18462;681;The movie looks sumptous and rich, the sound incredible, and the music soars.
I:18462;682;Every performance in the film, from Russ Tamblyn to Natalie Wood to Rita Moreno, and so on and so on, is powerful and compelling.
I:18462;683;The huge dancing numbers are visually mesmerizing, you get lost in the middle of them constantly.
I:18462;684;in fact, the directing of Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins is inspiring.
I:18462;685;Robbins and Wise pull back and allow the dancing to speak for itself.
I:18462;686;so come on, enjoy the Sharks, Jets, their fighting, dancing, all set in the arms of an amazing love story.
I:18462;687;No wonder AFI chose this as one of the 100 best films of all time.
I:18462;688;Rita Moreno was just as vibrant as she was forty years ago and it was found seeing surviving cast members tell their stories.
I:18462;689;Great transfer, I loved this movie as a boy and worshiped Natalie Wood as Maria.
I:18462;690;I loved hearing her actual voice trying to sing those songs, with a Puerto Rican accent, no less, which the dubbed voice did not have.
I:18462;691;bernstein and Sondheim made a great team and Jerold Robbins and Wise made a masterpiece.
I:18462;692;One of those rare moments when everything came together just right.
I:18462;693;"The ""America"" is one of my favorite sequences but it all works for me."
I:18462;694;Tonight is its best song.
I:18462;695;It is still a great musical and takes a very innocent look at life in that time frame.
I:18462;696;The dancing is still spectacular
I:18462;697;Will be sending it back.
I:18462;698;I loved seeing Natalie Wood again.
I:18462;699;i love this movie and i love all the choreography in it.
I:18462;700;if you are a dancer you could definately learn a lot of great moves from this movie.
I:18462;701;For me it is a virtually perfect presentation of a classic musical.
I:18462;702;The movie was very great but this 50th Anniversary Edition Box Set makes it sensational.
I:18462;703;Would recommend this to the generation of today.
I:18462;704;West Side Story has been my favorite musical put on film since its introduction in 1961.
I:18462;705;This movie is a must anyone who loves musicals, it's a total classic.
I:18462;706;If you thought you knew a lot about the movie, think again, because with all the extra fetures will provide you with more knowledge that you than think about.
I:18462;707;the movie has definatley got some of the best dance seguences ever made for a musical.
I:18462;708;This was one of my favorite movies when I was a kid and it is still very stirring.
I:18462;709;the story and songs are timeless and beautiful.
I:18462;710;Bernstein's score is a gem, as is the choreography.
I:18462;711;"time movie buff
I:18462;712;After watching the movie, and extras that came in the set, all I can say is that the price that I paid for the movie was an outright steal, (and I paid under $26 for the movie, including shipping).
I:18462;713;The colors were extremely vivid throughout the movie, (from the outdoor shots, the school dance hall, to the colorful outfits worn by many of the characters).
I:18462;714;"In junior high music classes, I remember our teacher devoted class time towards teaching us about ""West Side Story""."
I:18462;715;And, I quite believe that these lectures, now almost 40 years ago, led me to a deeper appreciation and understanding of this all.
I:18462;716;time classic movie.5 stars for the movie and the collector's set offered on Amazon.
I:18462;717;So my daughter was able to find it under the tree and was very excited about it!
I:18462;718;I first saw this movie at age of 12 and it is just as powerful now as it was nearly 19 years ago.
I:18462;719;Bernstein's and Sondheim's score is brilliant, Robbins' choreography is superb, and Rita Moreno's performance in a supporting role is still etched in my mind.
I:18462;720;"The mambo number is an explosion of color and movement, and I still find myself humming ""I feel pretty."""
I:18462;721;Natalie Wood shines as Maria, even though we were spared her natural singing voice.
I:18462;722;West Side Story impresses me as the most exciting dramatic musical of all time.
I:18462;723;For a fast moving drama this is a classic against which to compare other musical drama.
I:18462;724;The producers certainly succeeded in bringing up to date the Romeo and Juliet saga.
I:18462;725;The romance and tragedy of Tony and Maria will always be indelibly impressed in my mind.
I:18462;726;The movie is the best and this boxed set has a book with lyrics and pictures and inside information.
I:18462;727;I bought it as a gift because of the extra info and it is well worth the extra investment the info is awsome so is the many story.
I:18462;728;Great movie, but I have often wondered what happened to most of the actors.
I:18462;729;But after the first scene, it completely captured me.
I:18462;730;Natalie Wood was definitely the best choice for Maria.
I:18462;731;"Her performance in ""I Feel Pretty"" is stunning."
I:18462;732;Richard Beymer's performance as Tony is truely heartbreaking, especially in his dying scene.
I:18462;733;the music is far better than any other musical movie.
I:18462;734;This movie is truly a masterpiece that will last for generations to come.
I:18462;735;West Side Story will definitely capture your heart as it did mine.
I:18462;736;great recording and price enjoyed it.
I:18462;737;I was looking for something to use in my classroom and this was perfect.
I:18462;738;Enter Chakiris and Moreno to save the picture,( both winning well deserved Oscars).
I:18462;739;This has been my favorite musical movie.
I:18462;740;Brings me back to my teenage years.
I:18462;741;Now I can watch it and even dance to it!!
I:18462;742;It is a long film, but well worth the time to watch it.
I:18462;743;A modern heartbreaker, the Romeo and Juliet of the 60's,(90's?)
I:18462;744;West Side Story was quite entertaining.
I:18462;745;I've seen the stage version, had to watch the movie version made from it, and though it suffers slightly from not seeing it on a large screen, it still packs a punch for its Bernstein music, backed by a remarkable cast and crew.
I:18462;746;Some people feel the romantic male lead was inappropriately cast, but I found him passably good all the same.
I:18462;747;The music of West Side Story was the very first music I can ever remember loving as a child.
I:18462;748;It filled my small town boy head with dreams of the big city and indeed the big world around me.
I:18462;749;the music truly reaches right into the heart and as I have always felt outside the norm, the song A Place For Us will always be among my very favorites.
I:18462;750;Romantically speaking, the delicate crescendo of unfinished love dominates this powerful classic (easily one of the finest dramatic musicals ever produced).
I:18462;751;The unfolding of love, passion, and intimacy between Tony and Maria, like the riptide, spills into the soul of this film.
I:18462;752;Their whispered and orchestrated words on the balcony create nuances beyond the realm of normal drama.
I:18462;753;Their marriage before God establishes their union, solidifies the romantic crescendo, and allows Maria to mourn her husband's death at the end.
I:18462;754;all meetings between Tony (played by Richard Beymer) and Maria (played by Natalie Wood) are stunning in presentation.
I:18462;755;The musical overtures are superb, the dancing is brilliant, and the conflict between the Jets and Sharks (women included) has its own originality in classical terms.
I:18462;756;"Yet, Maria alone commands the stage in virtually all tender moments (except those involving Anita)
I:18462;757;"In truth, this masterpiece resides in both categories, tragedy and romance
I:18462;758;Our catharsis is directly affected by Maria's youthful passion related to unfinished love in its most delicate stages.
I:18462;759;running Broadway play, this triumphant production combines a brilliant score and jaw.
I:18462;760;dropping choreography with a heart.
I:18462;761;rending tale of doomed love.
I:18462;762;The leads work well together, with Wood particularly effective, but supporting players Russ Tamblyn (as Jet leader Riff), Chakiris and Rita Moreno (as Bernardo's sassy girlfriend Anita) virtually eclipse the stars with their intense moves and portrayals.
I:18462;763;This vibrant film is also elevated by an unsurpassed, evergreen Bernstein/Sondheim score.
I:18462;764;We really enjoyed this movie.
I:18462;765;Arrived on time and packed well.
I:18462;766;It remains true that West Side Story is one of the five best American musicals ever created for Broadway, and the film version is a masterpiece that captures the sentiment and aesthetics of the 1950s.
I:18462;767;bernstein conception is beautifully realized in the cinematography, coloration, dancing and acting in this youthful myth of love.
I:18462;768;years, weall can have a chance to at least hear what her own vocals were like.
I:18462;769;My daughter loves it too.
I:18462;770;She dances around the living room to it.
I:18462;771;On a large screen it makes for theater.
I:18462;772;This is a classic musical and was a gift for my daughter who thinks we had the best music of all time.
I:18462;773;Great price and quick delivery.
I:18462;774;for the price and what you get.
I:18462;775;it's a great movie to add to your collection.
I:18462;776;All the while it is set to the magnificent score of Leonard Bernstein and choreography of Jerome Robbins.
I:18462;777;"Filled with unforgettable songs like ""Something's Coming"", ""Maria"", ""America"" and ""Tonight"", ""West Side Story"" will keep your anticipation high, keep you glued to your chair, and steal your heart."
I:18462;778;This movie is brilliant from all perspectives, is a classic, the music in one of the best scores from twentieth century, and the story, tha dances, the actors, wow.
I:18462;779;I love this movie and i always will be.
I:18462;780;The set is incredible and the documentary is great.
I:18462;781;Great movie very life lesson like Romeo And Juliet!
I:18462;782;Anyway it could be a Great Valentine's day gift!
I:18462;783;My favorite movie of all time!!
I:18462;784;Great story, dancing and especially the music.
I:18462;785;ray is super as is audio.
I:18462;786;My favorite extra was the dances of West Side Story mode on the blu.
I:18462;787;movie viewing mode, a nifty feature, that has numerous experts .
I:18462;788;The blu makes a very nice addition to already great set).
I:18462;789;A terrific film, made even better in blu format.
I:18462;790;West Side StoryScore: 86/100In 1961, West Side Story, this endearing classic, garnered a total of ten academy awards, which is one of the most plausible amounts ever.
I:18462;791;west Side Story is a musical adaptation of Romeo and Juliet set in New York City, where rival street gangs .
I:18462;792;battle for territory and respect.
I:18462;793;west Side Story is a truly electrifying piece of cinema, it sets ageless tragedy on the slums of New York in the 1950's and does it maturely and with stunning style.
I:18462;794;The violence and some unnecessary language may slightly falter it, but Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim's unforgettable score, which includes such famous songs as Maria, America and Tonight, and Jerome Robbins' exuberant chereography makes up for whatever may put the film down.
I:18462;795;"crinkly actors
I:18462;796;winners Rita Moreno and George Chakiris both make sure this film is satisfying in supporting performances as well.
I:18462;797;west Side Story is a lovely film that remains a feast for the eye, the ear and, ultimately, the heart.
I:18462;798;He has already watched it 4 times and loved every minute of it.
I:18462;799;His collection of great movies is building, thanks to Amazon.
I:18462;800;As much as this musical is presented in schools, etc., it is good for young people to see the original.
I:18462;801;It is a classic and I had never seen it before.
I:18462;802;I loved the story and was awed by Natalie's voice.
I:18462;803;A breakthrough movie of its time where dance drives the storyline and dance and singing develops organically from dialog and action.
I:18462;804;A classic movie that is worth watching again and again.
I:18462;805;Upon seeing it, I was delighted with all of its amazing music and dance scenes.
I:18462;806;For being one of the first musicals its one of the best ones love the story.
I:18462;807;It brings broadway into your home.
I:18462;808;Better than i expected it to be.
I:18462;809;I'm so happy I got this for my musical loving daughter, its so nice to see how simple love stories and great music are timeless , even for this generation of kids.
I:18462;810;I thought this was a very good movie.
I:18462;811;It was funny at some parts, suspenseful at some, and just plain made me cry at the end.
I:18462;812;My 14 yr old daughter and I watched and enjoyed.
I:18462;813;I haved loved this musical all my life its is a true classic.
I:18462;814;This musical is ageless and is as relevant now as it was when it was first on broadway in the 1950s.
I:18462;815;I not only loved the story, but the music was amazing as well.
I:18462;816;but the boy belongs to one gang, and the girl's brother belongs to a rival gang.
I:18462;817;Plus, with the difference in ethnicity, how can this love ever blossom?I must say, if you believe in love, the ending is one that will haunt you forever!I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys musicals.
I:18462;818;If you haven't seen it already, you are in for a real treat!
I:18462;819;groundbreaking in its transfer from the Broadway stage, and in its production values and design, featuring (among other virtues) a matchless score by Leonard Bernstein, brilliant choreography by Jerome Robbins, costumes by Irene Sharaff, and a fantastic supporting cast, the film is a treat for the eye and ear.
I:18462;820;singing actresses in the 1950s and 1960s, Marnie Nixon, was brought in to dub Wood's songs, further depriving Wood's performance of the somewhat stronger gestalt it needed.
I:18462;821;Neither a particularly good singer, nor particularly good.
I:18462;822;enemy, Riff (played in the film by the energetic and insouciant Russ Tamblyn).
I:18462;823;One would never know from Chakiris's intense, bitter, and gorgeously danced performance as Bernardo, that he was fresh from playing his opposite number.
I:18462;824;Moreno was equally unforgettable as Anita.
I:18462;825;"the film's other, and less glaring flaw, is its somewhat arch ""beat"" script, with phrases like ""Daddy."
I:18462;826;"you can see the difference immediately if you watch a film like ""On the Waterfront"" with its gritty presentation of the woeful poverty of the New York waterfront."
I:18462;827;as I said, even with these exceptions, the film retains a warm and affectionate place in my heart.
I:18462;828;The supporting cast is brilliant, with the aforementioned Chakiris and Moreno, in particular, pulling out memorable performances on both the dramatic and musical levels.
I:18462;829;all serve up a delectable feast of melody, movement, color, and strong characterizations.
I:18462;830;"Steven Sondheim's lyrics have become immortal (""Maria"" has probably been sung more often than any song in modern Broadway history), and Irene Sharaff's costumes are divine, especially those for the dance at the gym."
I:18462;831;as for those big numbers: that amazing opening sequence, the dance at the gym, the rooftop dance by the Sharks, the dance in the garage for the Jets .
I:18462;832;you'll go a very, very long way to surpass their propulsive, irresistable spirit and beauty.
I:18462;833;The film is worth your time and money just for those sequences, and for the supporting performances.
I:18462;834;West Side Story won ten Oscars, including Best Picture.
I:18462;835;The information on this movie is incredible.
I:18462;836;Jerome Robbins certainly knew what he wanted from his dancers, and it showed in the movie.
I:18462;837;"I love this movie because of how it told the story of ""Romeo and Juliet"" in a modern setting."
I:18462;838;I have seen the musical a couple times and I can say the movie adaptation is wonderfully done.
I:18462;839;Arguebly, the best movie musical of all time.
I:18462;840;The product was in wonderful condition.
I:18462;841;west Side Story traced the rivalry between two gangs, the native born Americans Jets and the Puerto Rican born Sharks.
I:18462;842;the bonus second disc has a very informative and enlightening documentary on the making of the film, including clips featuring Natalie Wood and Russ Tamblyn's own vocals before they were dubbed in.
I:18462;843;the piece de resistance of the set is the booklet that came with it.
I:18462;844;The booklet first have a timeline that traced West Side Story's origins from Broadway smash to cinematic legend.
I:18462;845;Then the entire screenplay is included, with pictures from the movie inserted at key sequences in the script.
I:18462;846;The screenplay followed, for the most part, the original Broadway prodcution with the addition of the character Ice (Tucker Smith) and the elimination of Diesel.
I:18462;847;Casting wise, the male Jets are more distinctive in terms of their individuality and characterizations.
I:18462;848;While their rivalry with the Sharks are based in no small part to racism, they are still likeable.
I:18462;849;This trend is reversed in the Sharks, where the female characters turn out to be more interesting than the guys, with the exception of Bernardo.
I:18462;850;Perhaps it is because of the widescreen, and that my sense of perception has matured, watching the movie I found myself constantly drawn to Tucker Smith.
I:18462;851;Just went to see the Broadway production, which was very good.
I:18462;852;Its hard to review a film like West Side Story, that has been cannonized as a film classic.
I:18462;853;All I can do is try to relate the joy, energy and wonder I feel everytime I view this movie.
I:18462;854;This is one of those rare instances in film history, where commerce/box office success intersects with great art to create an entertainment legacy, that is truely special.
I:18462;855;We all pretty much know the story.
I:18462;856;It is a modern, musical retelling of Shakesphere's Romeo and Juliet.
I:18462;857;where do you start with what makes this movie great?
I:18462;858;Do you begin with the talented youthful cast?
I:18462;859;Richard Beymer and Natalie Wood both are wonderful as the young lovers, who make the ultimate sacrifice.
I:18462;860;Likewise Russ Tamblyn, Rita Moreno and George Chakiris give amazing performances as young people, who are caught up in a world that dosn't seem to understand their need to explode in violence.
I:18462;861;The entire cast is just fantastic and never gives us a false note of acting.
I:18462;862;Finally there is the brilliant Choreogaphy of Co. director, Jerome Robbins.
I:18462;863;The story, music and dancing all comes together under the artistry of Robbins and his Co. director Robert Wise, who both share the responsiblity for the creation of this filmmaking masterpiece.
I:18462;864;if you are a fan of this movie, then you will be in heaven with the tons of extras included.
I:18462;865;Most prominent is a great one hour documentary called West Side Memories , which includes both home movies, original vocal soundtracks, and interviews from actors and production people.
I:18462;866;If you are a fan of West Side Story or classic movies in general, then I highly recommend this 'Special Edition'!
I:18462;867;For them, it's silly, questionably entertaining, and maybe even laughable.
I:18462;868;this film has awesome cinematography, very complex dance numbers, a beautiful score, and a story that intelligent viewers can not only enjoy, but relate to as well.
I:18462;869;it is a basic story of love that exists despite some serious restrictions.
I:18462;870;natalie Wood and Richard Beymer are great as Maria and Tony.
I:18462;871;They touched a chord with young audiences back then because the struggles of immigrants, and the discontent of others, were real issues.
I:18462;872;"give the film a break and see it for what it is
I:18462;873;This a great classic movie and musical.
I:18462;874;"it was great acting,great dancing and great musicit has a unique vibe and feel of it own
I:18462;875;The picture and sound for this 1961 movie was very good!
I:18462;876;Enjoyable to watch after many years with my kids.
I:18462;877;It was really cool, Daddy.
I:18462;878;it is growing young day by day.
I:18462;879;keep it in your library.
I:18462;880;West Side Story (Full Screen Edition)A great upgrade version to replace your old VHS tape of this classic Broadway (movie version) musical.
I:18462;881;My students laugh at the dancing and singing but still watch it.
I:18462;882;"I liked it and wanted to be ""just like Maria."""
I:18462;883;This is a wonderfully made movie.
I:18462;884;Perfectly cast and beautifully presented.
I:18462;885;I don't care who did the actual singing, it is flawless!
I:18462;886;The singing voices match up perfectly with the actor's speaking voices.
I:18462;887;Watch it if you care about the deeper message of love, understanding, and acceptance.
I:18462;888;A classic Romeo and Juliet story made for today's kids.
I:18462;889;Everybody's happy with it , and the price was right.
I:18462;890;The music and lyrics of Bernstein and Sondheim and the choreography of Jerome Robbins make this film adaptation of a Broadway hit a movie classic.
I:18462;891;Loosely based on Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, West Side Story will fill your mind with memorable tunes, unforgettable characters and riveting dance sequences .
I:18462;892;and your heart with the emotions of romance and lost love.
I:18462;893;If you have never seen it, do yourself a favor and watch it.
I:18462;894;If you have, do what I do and watch it again.
I:18462;895;A classic for all time!
I:18462;896;Just introduced my 12 yr old daughter to it and she loved it!
I:18462;897;One of the best musicals ever made.
I:18462;898;Fabulous support comes from Rita Moreno, and George Chakiris who both won supporting Oscars for their roles.
I:18462;899;I enjoyed seeing this in revival in a theatre.
I:18462;900;The best way to see it.
I:18462;901;Anyone can enjoy this great film.
I:18462;902;popping, and the songs are beautiful and singable.
I:18462;903;"Wood and Beymer seem miscast and wooden at times, but the music is simply wonderful and has stood the test of time: ""Tonight,"" and ""Maria"" are well."
I:18462;904;talented Tamblyn is completely convincing as Riff, the leader of the Jets.
I:18462;905;Rita Moreno and Chakiris shine as immigrants who have adapated by joining the Sharks.
I:18462;906;This film certainly deserved its 10 Oscars for its outstanding script and musical numbers.
I:18462;907;Be it known, that 97% of us in the United States speak english.
I:18462;908;They were both 'sung' by Marni Nixon, and excellent singer who appears as herself in The Sound of Music as one of the nuns.
I:18462;909;The true appeal of West Side Story, is the story.
I:18462;910;I suggest one should look at the film as an entertainment value, not as a politically correct venue.
I:18462;911;Enjoy it, and keep in mind what was intended, entertainment.
I:18462;912;The greatest musical of all time.
I:18462;913;I bought this product as a Christmas gift, and specifically for the book enclosed.
I:18462;914;Contains the original screenplay as well as a lot of other really interesting memorabilia.
I:18462;915;I used to watch this movie and sing the songs when I was little, but getting to watch it on a regular basis is great!
I:18462;916;Highly recommend to anyone who enjoys an older, but terrific movie!
I:18462;917;Great movie, and Amazon instant watch made it super easy to download and watch it on the go!
I:18462;918;When I was a young girl,I always wanted to look like Natalie Wood.
I:18462;919;West Side Story, with all its song and dance, whirled me right into the story!
I:18462;920;No matter how many times I see it, I find myself caught up in the action and the powerful soundtrack.
I:18462;921;This, I believe, is Leonard Bernstein's masterpiece.
I:18462;922;He had me on the edge of my seat during the rumble, and sobbing during the final music, as they carried Tony's body off the stage.
I:18462;923;Natalie Wood gives a heart.
I:18462;924;breaking performance as a young girl who grows up and grows old in two days.
I:18462;925;Richard Beymer is a sweet, over.
I:18462;926;The Cinemascope captures the full effect of the dances and songs.
I:18462;927;he surprised me by coming home and singing songs from the play.
I:18462;928;We haven't had time to watch it yet, but I've seen it many times and love it every time!
I:18462;929;the musical score is magnificent and many of the songs, popular then are remembered today.
I:18462;930;So many great Broadway musicals over time.
I:18462;931;One of our all time favorite movies.
I:18462;932;When I first saw West Side Story I cried.
I:18462;933;Natalie Wood and Richard Beymer are wonderful as Maria and Tony(And who cares if they didnt sing! )
I:18462;934;When the movie first went on television the tag line was unlike some other musicals,West Side Story grows younger ,and its true.
I:18462;935;It will always have a special feel and meaning to me!
I:18462;936;There's some photos of the making.
I:18462;937;"(See also Bass own comments on his documentary ""Bass on Titles"" part of SHORTS 11 ."
I:18462;938;This is the best movie musical ever made.
I:18462;939;in my opinion, FAR superior to Singin' in the Rain which has some great stuff but is not consistently as inventive, creative, imaginative, and energetic as West Side Story.
I:18462;940;The best dancing of any movie musical ever made.
I:18462;941;Choreographer Jerome Robbins was an extremely intense, non.
I:18462;942;"When you watch the dancing in ""Cool"", for example, your jaw drops open."
I:18462;943;The creativity on display in all the dance sequences, from beginning to end, is way beyond brilliant.
I:18462;944;Leonard Bernstein, the composer, was one of the most powerful intellects in the history of American music.
I:18462;945;He wrote classical music, jazz, popular music, and was a phenomenal conductor.
I:18462;946;Listen to the absolutely unconventional but tremendously compelling music of the songs, as well as the rumble and the dance at the gym.
I:18462;947;The emotional power of the songs is such that it thrills and touches the viewer/listener like nothing else in the history of American musicals.
I:18462;948;Here he was in his early days and already a master at his craft.
I:18462;949;The performers are really well cast.
I:18462;950;"The two ""E""s. energy and emotion."
I:18462;951;The story is timeless and is very intelligently drafted from Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet by screenwriter Ernest Lehman.
I:18462;952;He did a terrific job of transitioning the theme of love and conflicting groups to New York City, circa the 1950s, and the inclusion of racial prejudice as a powerful plot device is one of the driving forces that makes the film so amazing.
I:18462;953;This is the reason, among others, that Rita Moreno is the soul of West Side Story.
I:18462;954;It's a TEN star film.
I:18462;955;If you are into musical this is a great one.
I:18462;956;But this one was very lively.
I:18462;957;The songs, the music, the dancing.
I:18462;958;Rita Moreno is a serious talent!
I:18462;959;The classic Romeo and Juliet story told with fantastic music and dancing.
I:18462;960;I absolutely love this movie.
I:18462;961;I'm a sucker for a good love story musical
I:18462;962;West Side Story is absolutely a classic musical.
I:18462;963;They are well known songs, found in so much of our modern culture.
I:18462;964;time, the women in the story are as just as powerful, working in the sweatshop, striving to form a new life where their independence is valued.
I:18462;965;sweet, West Side Story tackles some important issues head.
I:18462;966;"rape of one of the female characters, showing how powerful the ""not."
I:18462;967;this definitely is a movie that you could watch repeatedly and see new subtleties in it each time.
I:18462;968;The way the characters relate to each other, how they change over time, and how they either listen to or ignore influences from others is well done.
I:18462;969;it's surprising to me that for many of these actors this was their one shining moment on the screen.
I:18462;970;"This seemed to have become a ""perfect moment"" where the cast worked well together."
I:18462;971;perfect, it would be Russ Tamblyn's dubbed singing in his intro song.
I:18462;972;Russ is a fantastic dancer and gymnast .
I:18462;973;I'm still in awe at some of his movies .
I:18462;974;perfect note that leads us into the rest of the magnificence.
I:18462;975;Very embarrassing to give this as a gift!
I:18462;976;I had forgotten some of the awesome energy and the incredible musical arrangements, so to see the movie again on Blu.
I:18462;977;ray has been the best!
I:18462;978;To see interviews with some of the stars of this classic and to learn about what it took to film this masterpiece makes it even better.
I:18462;979;A great piece of film history that I would recommend for anyone.
I:18462;980;I was raised to love the movie musical, but I honestly find this movie very hard to sit through.
I:18462;981;And if you're watching with kids, they'll find the ballet sequences really funny.
I:18462;982;"west Side Story stands alone in movie history
I:18462;983;I probably hold this movie in high esteem because I watched it on my first date.
I:18462;984;arguably, there are other fine date movies.
I:18462;985;Every actor/dancer was inspired, fluid, poetry in motion.
I:18462;986;"i defy you to keep still when listening to ""America!"""
I:18462;987;if you think Aguilera/Spears/Simpson are superstar singer/dancers, this movie willshow you the difference between real talent and fanny.
I:18462;988;The writing, singing, staging, dancing, sound engineering, and editing produced a modern classic, a movie with a life uniquely its own.Yes, West Side Story is ALIVE.
I:18462;989;"It will entertain you
I:18462;990;Fun to see the difference between how movies where made and how they are made in today's world.
I:18462;991;What an enjoying day that was.
I:18462;992;I didn't get a whipping from my dad that day, I saw two great movies, and felt for once in my life like an actual teenager.
I:18462;993;Even if you are at home, watch these two movies back to back and enjoy.
I:18462;994;everyone knows what an incredible musical this is but to have it digitally re.
I:18462;995;The whole cast is just great, especially (my personal favorite) the great Rita Moreno as Anita.
I:18462;996;Terrific songs, most notably Cool, The Jet Song, America, I Feel Pretty, and Tonight.
I:18462;997;"The dances are fiery and fierce
I:18462;998;The Gee, Officer Krupke is unabashed fun, and the full.
I:18462;999;cast version of Tonight is one of the most brilliant pieces of music I've ever heard.
I:18462;1000;Everything is so good, I can't find a bad thing to say about it.
I:18462;1001;As much as it sounds like a commercial, if you like musicals, you'll love West Side Story.
I:18462;1002;I just love the songs in this movie.
I:18462;1003;The cast did a wonderful job belting out the tunes.
I:18462;1004;The acting was pretty good.
I:18462;1005;Also, Natalie Wood isn't too pleasing to look at in this movie.
I:18462;1006;On the bright side, this a classic musical captured on film.
I:18462;1007;A fun one for the whole family.
I:18462;1008;This movie i seen back in junior high and fell in love with it!
I:18462;1009;The movies today are very violent and the love stories are like tha of today's world but the way human's loved back then seems so much more genuine because morals and values were instilled in the up bringing of the children better.
I:18462;1010;Along with religion being a strong foundation.
I:18462;1011;This movie goes with the times so if you like musicals and plays, just a lover of art forms in various ways this is a classic!
I:18462;1012;The picture was good and it was worth the money!
I:18462;1013;I think it was actually a steal!
I:18462;1014;I watched this movie when I was young and enjoyed it it all over again.
I:18462;1015;It is really a masterpiece!
I:18462;1016;I recommend to viewers who like musicals!!
I:18462;1017;Lots of fighting and death.
I:18462;1018;The odd point is that the story contains dancing, singing and a lot of energy.
I:18462;1019;That is what makes it a great movie.
I:18462;1020;Really affecting and very moving.
I:18462;1021;the musical album numerous times.
I:18462;1022;My kids loved it too.
I:18462;1023;As explained in the special features, color .
I:18462;1024;was an important factor in creating the look of the movie.
I:18462;1025;the special features, especially the documentary featuring cast and crew, are such a treat.
I:18462;1026;It was also great to finally hear Natalie Wood's original vocals.
I:18462;1027;The highlight of the feature was the cast itself .
I:18462;1028;It is truly a classic.
I:18462;1029;It's entertainment as it's very best.
I:18462;1030;What a perfect masterpiece of music, poetry, dance, story and film making.
I:18462;1031;It's all too rare to be moved to tears by both beauty and pathos in the same film but West Side Story can do it.
I:18462;1032;'West Side Story' is one of the greatest musicals to come out in the past 50 years.
I:18462;1033;The songs and dancing sequence are always wonderful like usual, including the in.
I:18462;1034;famous 'I feel pretty,' ' America', ' Somewhere ' etc.
I:18462;1035;Great movie for children of all age and adults.
I:18462;1036;The dancing alone makes this movie one to treasure.
I:18462;1037;It was a triumph when it was released and remains so to this day.
I:18462;1038;Songs are amazing, so is story.
I:18462;1039;Still holds up as an emotional story with much social relevance.
I:18462;1040;And some occasional humor as well!
I:18462;1041;Wonderful story, wonderful songs, wonderful cast!
I:18462;1042;I stil enjoy watching it 19 yrs.
I:18462;1043;Also worth checking out Songs of the West Side Story on compact disc.
I:18462;1044;All 4 One, Selena, Brian Setzer, Wynonna Judd, Aretha Franklin, Sheila E., and Patti LaBelle are just a few who contributed their talents.
I:18462;1045;This is a classic for collection.
I:18462;1046;Was a gift for my daughter who wanted to know more of the movie and times of the past.
I:18462;1047;Would highly recommend to everyone.
I:18462;1048;A true classic musical for the entire family.
I:18462;1049;This movie is inspiring as it tell us that, despite our perceived differences, we still have many more commonalities than we can imagine.
I:18462;1050;Story line is very good also.
I:18462;1051;Natalie Wood does an excellent job.
I:18462;1052;The picture is so clear, I can see the original film grain.
I:18462;1053;The colors are stunning too.
I:18462;1054;The red was so deep and vibrant.
I:18462;1055;the packaging on the 50th Anniversary edition is quite nice.
I:18462;1056;The nice touch is also a separate blu.
I:18462;1057;The book is interesting and the postcard size international movie posters are nice too.
I:18462;1058;My wife is going to frame them together.
I:18462;1059;ray will be great for most.
I:18462;1060;But if you want the extra nick knacks, this set will please.
I:18462;1061;Even on an older analog tube TV, this fine film should be viewed widescreen.
I:18462;1062;When you read those words the first thing that pops into mind is.
I:18462;1063;"A confrontation is inevitable
I:18462;1064;The Jest ARE their family.
I:18462;1065;And the Jets treatment of Bernardo and his friends is just the culmination of how he views the world in America.
I:18462;1066;He sees the downfall it leads to.
I:18462;1067;With Bernardo comes Maria to her first dance.
I:18462;1068;The two see one another and its love at first sight.
I:18462;1069;the two love birds still find a way to see one another and share their hopes and dreams of finding a world where they can be themselves and not worry about others.
I:18462;1070;so now that you have the story you might wonder what makes this one so special.
I:18462;1071;Yes here we have a group of tough teens dancing and leaping and singing about how much they love their gangs.
I:18462;1072;Sure but it works and works well.
I:18462;1073;initially this story ran on Broadway but never to huge box office success.
I:18462;1074;It did big at the box office and even won the Oscar for best picture, best director (Robert Wise), supporting actor (Chakiris), supporting actress (Rita Moreno as Bernardo's girlfriend), cinematography and more.
I:18462;1075;When that happened the play became a world wide sensation as well.
I:18462;1076;It has been called one of the greatest movie musicals of all times.
I:18462;1077;It has been hailed as the best of the best.
I:18462;1078;ray transfer of the film is amazing.
I:18462;1079;This film is being seen as it should be, in glorious color with a transfer and restoration from what was previously available done right.
I:18462;1080;It is one of the best examples of why film restoration is something people should take seriously and consider.
I:18462;1081;Many of the films from our past, from when we were growing up, are deteriorating in cans around the world.
I:18462;1082;the movie seen here is better than a number of films released since.
I:18462;1083;The dance numbers, choreographed by the late great Jerome Robbins is fantastic.
I:18462;1084;It's a combination of ballet, jazz dance and improv that combines to become something unique.
I:18462;1085;Their work together here is remarkable.
I:18462;1086;Not just any chance, but one that offers it in the best possible way ever.
I:18462;1087;It's a classic movie that I love.
I:18462;1088;Wonderful story, following a 'modern day' romeo and juliet story.
I:18462;1089;Make it a musical and there you have perfection.
I:18462;1090;Still, the intonation when Maria and Anita sing in octaves in 'I Had A Love' is wonderful.
I:18462;1091;This is one of my favorite movies that I watched as a child.
I:18462;1092;I forgot how much I loved the singing and dancing.
I:18462;1093;It's the classic story of Romeo and Juliet set in New York.
I:18462;1094;Some of the best music ever written.
I:18462;1095;george Chakaris, Bernardo, played Riff in the London stage production) The dancing is fantastic.
I:18462;1096;Again, the singing and dancing were superb.
I:18462;1097;The Romeo and Juliette story is always wonderful and with the addition of singing and dancing it was even better.
I:18462;1098;So much fun to see this again and again.
I:18462;1099;Brings back memories from the 50's.
I:18462;1100;Introduced it to younger friends who had no idea what it was all about.
I:18462;1101;I love the songs so much, that I feel the story takes a back seat.
I:18462;1102;It's just the way I see the movie, it's like I'm always looking forward to the singing and dancing!
I:18462;1103;West Side Story is one of the most wonderful Musicals of all time.
I:18462;1104;Watch it for the music with the volume turned up.
I:18462;1105;the one hour documentary featuring interviews with some of the cast, Robert Wise, Harold Prince, Sondheim, and some key crew members is completely engrossing.
I:18462;1106;Home movie footage showing the filming of the movie is included.
I:18462;1107;Examples of the techniques that the movie makers used to film a musical are fascinating.
I:18462;1108;Rita Morena is particularly informative regarding the dubbing of her song A Boy Like That .
I:18462;1109;The documentary is invaluable for fans of the film.
I:18462;1110;The anamorphic transfer is very good.
I:18462;1111;The book which accompanies the set is very cool, with a great introduction by screenwriter Ernest Lehman (who is one of my movie heros).
I:18462;1112;i'm very impressed with this special edition of WEST SIDE STORY.
I:18462;1113;The film is a classic, and deserves such treatment.
I:18462;1114;Such a great music, songs and dancing being shown in a film!
I:18462;1115;For years I was keeping a watchful eye for any reposition show or festival including the movie.
I:18462;1116;"At last VHS was invented and the third picture I bought was ""West Side Story""."
I:18462;1117;"Tony is Riff's best friend, the boss of the ""Jets""."
I:18462;1118;Tragedies are tragic and this is one of them!Second the performances: a lovely and tender Natalie Wood give flesh to Maria in a remarkable acting piece.
I:18462;1119;the choreography is out standing: coordinate and dynamic movements electrify the audience.
I:18462;1120;"The songs are superb, especially ""Maria"", ""Tonight"", ""America"" and ""Something's coming""."
I:18462;1121;"The score is very nice and the ""leitmotiv"" persists thru more than forty years!One of the best musicals of all times!Reviewed by Max Yofre."
I:18462;1122;Movie is one of my favorites.
I:18462;1123;great story line a classic.
I:18462;1124;Its kinda like romeo and Juliet but amazing and way better
I:18462;1125;The best choreography and musical score of it's generation.
I:18462;1126;This was a popular musical when I was in high school and we used to sing this music and it had quite an impact.
I:18462;1127;Maria and Tonight are two of my favorite songs and they sick will you for a week after viewing.
I:18462;1128;i highly recommend this to people of all generations.
I:18462;1129;Great art never goes out of style and you will be glad you spent the time.
I:18462;1130;Did I mention that this is my favorite movie?West Side Story has it all: New York, ethnic conflict, romance, music, dance, excitement, drama, laughs, even spirituality, albeit hidden.
I:18462;1131;I've loved this movie since I was a kid.
I:18462;1132;recently I've seen this movie as a spiritual tug.
I:18462;1133;crossed romance is a story of a sheltered young girl who learns to take her faith and love beyond the prayer closet and into the streets.
I:18462;1134;A classic love story that you have to watch.
I:18462;1135;Will be enjoyed by all who view it.
I:18462;1136;What can you say about a fifty year old classic.
I:18462;1137;Music, songs, and dancing are great.
I:18462;1138;One of the best movie musicals ever.
I:18462;1139;I love the characters and the dancing.
I:18462;1140;The ensemble dance sequences are some of the best ever filmed.
I:18462;1141;The music is forever part of our iconic history.
I:18462;1142;West Side Story is one of the classical american musicals.
I:18462;1143;I figured we would just have to eat it, so to speak.
I:18462;1144;com for making me a very happy customer.
I:18462;1145;Damn, this is a great movie.
I:18462;1146;Its small flaws are overwhelmed by the powerful score and cinematography and the intense, breathtaking choreography.
I:18462;1147;This movie is so great!
I:18462;1148;I love musicals and I could'nt stop singing the songs all day long!
I:18462;1149;One of the best musicals out there (Across the Universe and Chicago are in the top three).
I:18462;1150;Watching how the movie was made and all of the details it took to create it was amazing.
I:18462;1151;Actually the extra features are just as good as the movie.
I:18462;1152;This is the definitive performance of West Side Story as far as I'm concerned.
I:18462;1153;ray it comes back to life in great glory.
I:18462;1154;It came in the mail faster than I thought it would and the movie looks amazing!
I:18462;1155;So happy with my order!
I:18462;1156;can they find happiness together before family tears them apart.
I:18462;1157;The movie West Side Story won 10 Awards.
I:18462;1158;what I love about this movie is the dancing, it's perfect and flawless.
I:18462;1159;The whole movie is like a dance.
I:18462;1160;The natural flow of the movie is timeless.
I:18462;1161;This is a very great music/drama movie.
I:18462;1162;Singing songs to express their feelings is a very cool thing.
I:18462;1163;That's what people like to see now.
I:18462;1164;This is the best movie I have ever seen!
I:18462;1165;It is so fantastic, so amazing, so perfect!
I:18462;1166;west Side Story is pure Hollywood all the way, and 50's Hollywood was a propaganda machine .
I:18462;1167;I love this movie, and even though I've seen it several times, I still cry every time I watch it.
I:18462;1168;I always forget what great moral lessons some of these old musicals hold for us .
I:18462;1169;just like South Pacific, West Side Story is food for thought as well as fun and enjoyable.
I:18462;1170;For me this is the best musical ever.
I:18462;1171;With the recent Blu ray release, I thought I'd give it another look.
I:18462;1172;As you might expect, there is a noticeable improvement to the clarity of the film.
I:18462;1173;You can see the film shimmering and fluttering.
I:18462;1174;She comes across as sweet and innocent and is a fair dancer.
I:18462;1175;All of this is of little importance because the overall structure of the Romeo and Juliet adaptation (save the ending), the Bernstein/Sondheim score and Jerome Robbins brilliant choreography overcome these quibbles.
I:18462;1176;West Side Story remains a cinematic masterpiece.
I:18462;1177;I saw the original Broadway production and nothing can compare to the very first serious musical conducted by Leonard Bernstein, himself!
I:18462;1178;But, the film is wonderful and the dancing, spectacular.
I:18462;1179;West Side Story is one of the most impressive musical movies I've ever seen.
I:18462;1180;last month, I bought a high definition projector and an 8 foot screen and a new home theater sound system.
I:18462;1181;This was the first time I've watched this movie on a large screen and with a good sound system.
I:18462;1182;I think I got a hint of how impressive this film was when it was first watched on a big screen in the theaters back in 1961.
I:18462;1183;The energetic and tension filled dance scene at the dance hall.
I:18462;1184;The colors and cinematography when Tony is singing Maria.
I:18462;1185;The clever and funny I Like to Live in America scene.
I:18462;1186;It is a magnificent work of art that needs to be experienced by as many people as possible.
I:18462;1187;OMG I loved this movie from the first time I seen it years ago in middle school.
I:18462;1188;"A perfect film
I:18462;1189;West Side Story if the best film ever made.
I:18462;1190;One of the reasons it is so great is the ensemble dance sequences.
I:18462;1191;this film won 10 Oscars.
I:18462;1192;It deserves the respect of seeing it the way Daniel Fapp shot the film and Robert Wise directed it.
I:18462;1193;It has great extra features and a book with the script and photos.
I:18462;1194;The extra cost is definitely worth it.
I:18462;1195;Full Screen means that it fills the entire screen of your old 4:3 TV set .
I:18462;1196;I'll start out by saying that my initial introduction to West Side Story was through the music of the original Broadway stage production of this musical.
I:18462;1197;My love of West Side Story took off.
I:18462;1198;release of it, had passed the heyday of its popularity, freshness and newness.
I:18462;1199;i finally did get to see it for the first time, at around Christmastime of 1968, as a high school Senior, at a now.
I:18462;1200;now for the real crux of my essay:West Side Story, as everybody knows, began as a famous late.1950's Broadway stage musical, which played in NYC's Winter Garden for roughly two years before embarking on a national tour, and then an international tour, as well, becoming a hit national and internationally, as well.
I:18462;1201;"There were also afew name changes to this musical along the way as well
I:18462;1202;after Walter Mirisch bought the rights to the movie version, West Side Story not only became a big hit on stage, both nationally and worldwide, but it became a big hit as a spectacular film, which won ten Academy Awards, including Best Picture, after its initial release in late October 1961.
I:18462;1203;since I was still a teenager in high school the first time that I saw the movie West Side Story, I was able to identify with the Jets, the Sharks and their girls, regarding kids being kids and so on.
I:18462;1204;I was able to appreciate West Side Story as a dynamic work of art and cinematic technology, as well as the intense scenery, the brilliant Bernstein musical store, the wonderfully.
I:18462;1205;with the exception of Richard Beymer (who I've always regarded as sort of a weak, lacklustre Tony), I thought that WSS had a very strong cast, and was a very strong film overall.
I:18462;1206;"West Side Story, to me, carries a certain message
I:18462;1207;Regardless of how many people claim that seeing it on a great home theatre system on TV is fantastic, absolutely nothing beats seeing West Side Story in a real movie theatre.
I:18462;1208;In fact, WSS cries for a great big, wide movie theatre screen.
I:18462;1209;area audiences, while more reserved than NY audiences, enjoy it about as much as New Yorkers, and West Side Story is especially wonderful in a real movie theatre, on a great big, wide screen, with the lights down low, and with a slew of other people whether one knows them or not.
I:18462;1210;The scenery seems much more expansive, and one can see all of everything.
I:18462;1211;The intensely brilliant Leonard Bernstein musical score, as well as the richly.
I:18462;1212;colored costumes and beautiful cinematography, and the beautifully.
I:18462;1213;as for the songs/scenes in West Side Story, America, Cool, The Prologue/Jets Song, Dance At the Gym, the pre.
I:18462;1214;rumble Quintet, and the Rumble itself were strong pillars in this great movie, but all of the songs/scenes and characters contributed to what this great film is, and continues to be.
I:18462;1215;I attended the 40th year anniversary screening of WSS at NYC's Radio City Music hall with friends, a special event of the one.
I:18462;1216;They learn the language faster and enjoy learning at the same time.
I:18462;1217;This movie has great music and is visually stunning, but this cannot detract from the flaws in this movie.
I:18462;1218;as nice as the movie looks, there is a certain silliness in the dance numbers considering the tragic storyline.
I:18462;1219;i enjoy a good musical and can see why something like Sound of Music can win best picture.
I:18462;1220;We love musicals and this classic was a great addition to our collection.
I:18462;1221;My husband and I enjoyed watching it.
I:18462;1222;The movie version always seems better.
I:18462;1223;How anyone who loves musicals and choreography and music, in general, can criticize this masterpiece is truly beyond me.
I:18462;1224;West Side Story has to rank as one of the most beautiful musical scores ever written!
I:18462;1225;I saw this film when I was 9 years old and still love and remember it to this day.
I:18462;1226;Natalie Wood is adorable, and those dance sequences are unforgettable.
I:18462;1227;This film truly deserved its 10 oscar nominations, and it is one of the few films I would see again several times in my lifetime.
I:18462;1228;Wonderful art included (especially the mini.
I:18462;1229;A great set if you are a fan of the movie.
I:18462;1230;the message is that love is stronger than family?!
I:18462;1231;i give this 3 stars because alot of the movie is beautiful,and the dancing and arobatics are great.
I:18462;1232;some of the songs are good.
I:18462;1233;"the one where the latinos sing about ""living in america"" is the best,and the one where the Jets sing about being crazy is also good,as well as Maria's ""i'm so pretty""."
I:18462;1234;otherwise the rest of the songs,in my opinion,are throwbacks.
I:18462;1235;this had great promise to be the great film that everyone says it is,but because of the obvious problems,i'll never be convinced otherwise.
I:18462;1236;if you want a great musical,watch Yankee Doodle Dandy or Grease.
I:18462;1237;I returned it to amazon right away.
I:18462;1238;I love this movie since I was small.
I:18462;1239;Got it right on time.
I:18462;1240;I can put this on while the grand kids are here.
I:18462;1241;It teaches them good basics to music.
I:18462;1242;A older movie, but excellent, a younger generation not that familiar with musicals, should check this out.
I:18462;1243;Had fun watching it again.
I:18462;1244;It was nice to see Nathalie Wood.
I:18462;1245;Its worth watching this movie.
I:18462;1246;The songs, music ,choreography are just awesome.
I:18462;1247;The songs rightly fit into the script.
I:18462;1248;Ballet dance is inspiring !!!
I:18462;1249;The most brilliant musical ever filmed!
I:18462;1250;It is so pristine and beautifuly packaged.
I:18462;1251;she is stunning, beyond beauty and so vulnerable as Maria she will break your heart!
I:18462;1252;however, if you just want to enjoy the great music and dance of WEST SIDE STORY, it's worth having.
I:18462;1253;Taking them to see the stage version this weekend!
I:18462;1254;West Side Story is one of the greatest films ever made.
I:18462;1255;this film can get deep with underlying messages, but I wont discuss that because what makes West Side Story so great is its music.
I:18462;1256;Those wonderful songs, and great Score(Leonard Bernstein).
I:18462;1257;She is just so spunky and full of energy.
I:18462;1258;Rita Moreno won one of the 10 oscars, and George Chakiris did too.
I:18462;1259;this edition comes with a wonderful scrap book, with a complete screen play for West Side Story, so now you can get those lyrics that you are a little unsure about.
I:18462;1260;this is a keeper and one that you need to add to your collection.
I:18462;1261;Great classic with memorable songs and a poignant message that still applies to today.
I:18462;1262;"I cried in this movie
I:18462;1263;"When ""West Side Story"" hit the Broadway stage it must have shocked theater critics."
I:18462;1264;eyed and humming the Leonard Berstein score.
I:18462;1265;The difference here are the songs, so electric and outstanding that they easily steal the show.
I:18462;1266;Having said that, the transfer is quite good, with a rich bold color scheme and fair solid blacks.
I:18462;1267;There's also a lot of pixelization in the backgrounds.
I:18462;1268;A moderate listening level is recommended to fully appreciate this audio.
I:18462;1269;for starters we get a very handsome book that contains the entire script as well as personal reflections from the producers and cast and newspaper clippings of the initial reviews.
I:18462;1270;disc set, the movie is on disc one, with the option to listen and view with or without the intermission music .
I:18462;1271;congratulatory and pretty much plays it safe.
I:18462;1272;The premiere and the film's enduring popularity are glossed over.
I:18462;1273;The handsome packaging on the exterior hints to more hidden treasures than are actually found inside.
I:18462;1274;bOTTOM LINE: A genuine work of art.
I:18462;1275;The transfer is nice, just not pristine.
I:18462;1276;Every scene jumps will color and motion and ostentatious evidence of an extraordinary meticulous pre.
I:18462;1277;The studio obviously pulled out all stops to make an entertaining, Oscar.
I:18462;1278;It makes a spectacle of itself.
I:18462;1279;"incidentally, one of the co. directors is the smart Robert Wise, editor of ""Citizen Kane"" and director of the fine films ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" and ""Star Trek: The Movie""."
I:18462;1280;The dancing, in fact, outshines the singing.
I:18462;1281;"Although the ""Jets"" and ""Sharks"" are solid in their numbers and the singer who dubs Richard Beymer has a fine voice, those who sing for Natalie Wood and Rita Moreno pale beside Carol Lawrence and Chita Rivera on the original Broadway cast recording."
I:18462;1282;But the acting is strong all around.
I:18462;1283;Wood may look a bit mature for the teenage Maria, but she glows here .
I:18462;1284;Moreno is a sincere actress and a lithe dancer.
I:18462;1285;This has always been a favorite movie of mine but never see it play on television anymore.
I:18462;1286;And old musical that continues to hold the interest of children and provide evidence that real boys can sing and dance.
I:18462;1287;and that's a good thing.
I:18462;1288;My nephew had expressed interest in seeing the picture, since he had learned one of the songs in music class.
I:18462;1289;And it's been many, many years since I last viewed it, so I thought it a good choice for this weekend.
I:18462;1290;"With a fantastic score and great orchestrations, wonderful choreography, and a story with real emotional pull
I:18462;1291;the performances are uniformly good, with Rita Moreno a stand.
I:18462;1292;The special edition set gives you the widescreen print of the film with a 5.1 surround audio mix, a booklet containing the script and additional information, plus an additional disc containing bonus features.
I:18462;1293;most interesting of the bonus material is an hour.
I:18462;1294;long documentary detailing the making of the film.
I:18462;1295;The documentary contains a lot of footage shot behind.
I:18462;1296;scenes, as well as some footage where you can hear Natalie Wood's own vocals for the musical numbers.
I:18462;1297;"I have to say, Marni does a great job here
I:18462;1298;This is one of those films that is so much a part of pop culture, and the history of the American theatre, that I think everyone should give it a try at least once.
I:18462;1299;bit of trivia: The opening of this film was notable at the time for the way it began with long aerial shots of the city, with the camera gradually moving closer and closer to street level as the sounds of city life slowly became audible, before finally focusing in on individual characters at ground level.
I:18462;1300;"It's interesting that, all these years later, it is actually the opening of ""The Sound of Music"" that is better remembered and more famous than that of ""West Side Story."""
I:18462;1301;ray version has brilliant colors and great sound along with some of the greatest songs ever written.
I:18462;1302;it remains my favorite musical through all these years.
I:18462;1303;love it first saw it in the theater Worth watching again for young and old.
I:18462;1304;Good story line and great music
I:18462;1305;saw it as a child and loved it and knew all the songs by heart.
I:18462;1306;Just saw it again as an aging baby boomer and found it to be just as wonderful.
I:18462;1307;it actually seemed quite innocent compared to all of the violence everywhere inn the world now.
I:18462;1308;West Side Story was great ant i would highly recommend it.
I:18462;1309;I bought this in a package as a gift.
I:18462;1310;it was appreciated, the package arrived timely and many thanks, thanks, thanks.
I:18462;1311;The music is the very best.
I:18462;1312;This year marks 50 years since this Broadway classic opened to enthusiastic reviews.
I:18462;1313;What a great cast, a great story and to sum up this is the musical that gets better every time you see it.
I:18462;1314;If you want a movie that dances, that sings, that has its dramatic and fun moments,WEST SIDE STORY is for you!
I:18462;1315;If you like West Side Story, you'll love this product.
I:18462;1316;In addition to the blue ray disc, the special features disc that comes with this product is fantastic.
I:18462;1317;This is a great value.
I:18462;1318;This a great film for the classroom.
I:18462;1319;It gives students a chance to understand elements of plot, theme and etc.
I:18462;1320;Shipping was excellent as well.
I:18462;1321;This movie is absolutely fantastic!
I:18462;1322;It is one of those movies that will be cherished for all time.
I:18462;1323;I would Recommend this to all my friends and it came in on time and it was a good price
I:18462;1324;This was a great movie!
I:18462;1325;A great story of life for Puerto.
I:18462;1326;I would recommend watching it with kids who understand racism and gangs, but otherwise it was a REALLY great movie!
I:18462;1327;This is a wonderful movie!
I:18462;1328;Even people that don't care for musicals will love this movie!
I:18462;1329;First rate acting, first rate songs, first rate directing!
I:18462;1330;Watch it once and you will be hooked!
I:18462;1331;great story (modern romeo and juliet), gorgeous score by Leonard Bernstein, wonderful commentary on stereotyping and breaking the barriers that ignorance creates.
I:18462;1332;All aside a huge movie fan would appreciate the gift enjoy.
I:18462;1333;This is a great musical!
I:18462;1334;Bernstein's score is a masterpiece of vocal and instrumental arrangements!
I:18462;1335;The sets are a masterpiece of colour and design!
I:18462;1336;And it has a raw yet romantic feel.
I:18462;1337;The director has captured a unique and surreal world and has created what I consider the most extraordinary dramatic musical ever made!
I:18462;1338;This is among the great ones in my opinion along with Casablanca and Auntie Mame.
I:18462;1339;Watch and enjoy this one.
I:18462;1340;I just watched the new blu ray and overall it's wonderful.
I:18462;1341;The final product is damnable as so much of its improvements are impressive but, ultimately, unfullfilled.
I:18462;1342;One of the best classics ever and I never get tired of watching it.
I:18462;1343;I love the music and all the original actors.
I:18462;1344;Can never go wrong with such a great musical!!!
I:18462;1345;My favorite musical in Blue.
I:18462;1346;ray so I had to give it 5 stars.
I:18462;1347;I argue this is possibly the best American musical ever made.
I:18462;1348;It's steeped in the style and idiom of the day, there's a nostalgia infused throughout, yet it remains fresh and timeless and consistantly affecting.
I:18462;1349;The music and choreography is splendid ~ the duet 'Somewhere' between Tony and Maria is one of the most eloquent love song ever penned.
I:18462;1350;edge for the time and will never go out of style.
I:18462;1351;WEST SIDE STORY is, as most are aware, a reworking of Shakespeare's immortal tale ROMEO AND JULIET, and a worthy one at that.
I:18462;1352;this was a good movie!
I:18462;1353;It was romantic, occasionally funny, sometimes sad, sometimes sort of disturbing, and very musical.
I:18462;1354;Overall, I recommend this movie to tweens, teens, and adults who want a good, romantic movie (From the days when movie romance was genuine, instead of non.
I:18462;1355;Having performed this musical in high school, it was a pleasure and brought back pleasant memories throughout the viewing.
I:18462;1356;Glad I added it to my collection to introduce a younger generation to the musical.
I:18462;1357;The singing, dancing are superb and the story line is of course well known.
I:18462;1358;The packaging for this particular West Side Story collection is wonderful and quite well assembled, BUT the media contents contained on all 4 discs fall short of spectacular and rob the film of its full glory.
I:18462;1359;THIRDLY, anyone that's seen West Side Story at a movie theater knows that the original film print of it contains a 15 minute intermission card which has a soundtrack score of beautiful sweeping music.
I:18462;1360;When I had the in theater experience everyone enjoyed the intermission segment which came as an unexpected surprise to those of us who grew up seeing the film on home video.
I:18462;1361;It's music is breathtakingly gorgeous!
I:18462;1362;Well, now that we have that out of the way, let's take a look at the actual movie.
I:18462;1363;The parallels are fascinating: the Prince of Verona becomes the short.
I:18462;1364;it continues throughout the movie.
I:18462;1365;the dialogue is realistic and revealing, the characters real and honest.
I:18462;1366;with incredible coreography (27 pairs of pants split in the course of filming!)
I:18462;1367;, innovative (for the time) and striking filming, and wonderful, catchy, heartfelt music, the old familiar story of star.
I:18462;1368;crossed lovers takes on a bright, vibrant, bursting young life.
I:18462;1369;if you're a fan of this musical I would highly recommend this!
I:18462;1370;I love this movie and always has.
I:18462;1371;It's a classic movie like the Wizard of Oz.
I:18462;1372;Thank you and Happy Holidays.
I:18462;1373;Beyond that, there are thousands of pieces of American experience in literature and that uniquely American medium, the big.
I:18462;1374;screen motion picture that confer an understanding of America as she developed.
I:18462;1375;screen movie house just so the grandeur of the picture can be appreciated.
I:18462;1376;Because America is such a mix of cultures, there must have been thousands of such stories in New York in that time and millions more across the nation since then.
I:18462;1377;hur was voted best picture of the year for 1959.
I:18462;1378;Has been one of my favorite movies and musicals since I was a little kid.
I:18462;1379;Watch it at least once a month probably more.
I:18462;1380;She loved the dresses the women wore at the dance, the songs, and, especially the story.
I:18462;1381;I enjoyed the movie just as much or more than when it came out.
I:18462;1382;I appreciated the choreography much more.
I:18462;1383;The dances, the songs, the New York locations, and the very talented young cast, have all been lauded for years as flawlessly executed.
I:18462;1384;His cocky demeanor and brilliant dance attitude are magnificent to behold.
I:18462;1385;he puts the C in cool!
I:18462;1386;I bought this for my 19 yr old daughter, She loved it.
I:18462;1387;she told me it was a great movie.
I:18462;1388;Those who have nothing will do everything in their power to protect it, even if all they have is territory, in which case they will claim ownership by planting a metaphorical flag in the middle of it and marking the boundaries.
I:18462;1389;especially the ones at the top of the pyramid.
I:18462;1390;And when circumstances bring Tony and Maria together and they fall in love, it sets the stage for tragedy on a grand scale, all of which is captured on the screen in this film, the most celebrated musical of all time.
I:18462;1391;when a movie earns ten Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director (Jerome Robbins also received a special award for choreography), it clearly indicates that this is a film of extraordinary merit.
I:18462;1392;Told through the magic of music, presented through the dramatic and driving Oscar winning songs and score of Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim, Shakespeare's tragic love story becomes a transporting, memorable experience that is at once a sweeping visual extravaganza while at the same time an intimate chronicle of the romance between the star.
I:18462;1393;Lavishly staged, the film evokes a true 1950's sensibility while retaining the agelessness of the passion at the heart of the story.
I:18462;1394;"The production numbers are dynamic, from the quietude of the enthralling and poignant ""Maria,"" and the perky, uplifting ""I Feel Pretty,"" to the energetic ""Dance At The Gym"" and the thundering, dramatic strains which accompany the rumble."
I:18462;1395;This is an example of filmmaking at it's best, brought to fruition through the talents of Wise, Robbins and a superlative cast and crew, whose many and varied individual contributions are too lengthy to mention here.
I:18462;1396;this may not have been Natalie Wood's greatest role, but she is nevertheless unforgettable as Maria.
I:18462;1397;She is charming and beautiful, with riveting, dark eyes that speak volumes about her character.
I:18462;1398;Her accent is passable, if not perfect, but most importantly her natural ability as an actor enables her to create a very real, believable person in Maria.
I:18462;1399;There's an endearing vulnerability about her, yet in her eyes you find the pride and determination that makes Maria strong.
I:18462;1400;It's a solid performance, and just one of the many reasons this film was so well received.
I:18462;1401;wise, and his portrayal of Tony is credible, but fairly lackluster.
I:18462;1402;"If a weakness in the film could be singled out, it would be his performance
I:18462;1403;As his buddy, Riff, Russ Tamblyn comes across much better, and makes the most of showcasing his considerable talents in what is one of his most memorable roles, as well.
I:18462;1404;Chakiris, with his dark, good looks has never been more convincing or better in any role, and he has a commanding presence especially in the production numbers.
I:18462;1405;"And Moreno is in a class all her own as the fiery Anita
I:18462;1406;She is such a vital presence in this film, and along with Chakiris, more than helps in bringing the music and story to life.
I:18462;1407;An emotionally involving story underscored by a blood.
I:18462;1408;"stirring soundtrack, ""West Side Story"" is without question one of the all time great movie musicals, thoroughly entertaining and presented with the kind of flare that is rarely even attempted anymore."
I:18462;1409;Within the genre, it's the best of the best, the realized vision of a group of extraordinary artists.
I:18462;1410;Earning Oscars, as well, for Cinematography, Costumes, Art and Set Direction and editing, this is a prime example of the true magic of the movies.
I:18462;1411;This musical story was so well done that I watched it fourteen times.
I:18462;1412;The acting, singing and dancing were fantastic.
I:18462;1413;West Side Story is an old musical classic that I picked up not because it takes place in my home town of New York City but, more so that it received 10 academy awards including best picture in 1961.
I:18462;1414;You find the musical routines to be very well done and the story plot to be well layout.
I:18462;1415;The film starring Natalie Wood in a lead role with street gang warfare as a back drop very good overall and they kept it clean with street gang fight scenes.
I:18462;1416;Add it to you classics collection.
I:18462;1417;Overall, still a great movie.
I:18462;1418;It was a good musical and it made fun of the gangs in new York in a musical way.
I:18462;1419;But when it comes to Broadway, everything's comedy except this one.
I:18462;1420;Gotta keep it light, right?
I:18462;1421;"The fact that it made it to the screen is a testament to the fact that the only time ""musical tragedy"" was ever done, it was done right."
I:18462;1422;All of Bernstein's superb sound made the trip intact.
I:18462;1423;"The hypnotic 12/8 Latin rhythms of the sardonic ""America""."
I:18462;1424;Anyway, the year this film hit the Oscars, it copped just about everything.
I:18462;1425;, and that bench clears as they advance on Kaye, finger.
I:18462;1426;"A story of ""forbidden"" love and cultural differences that should be seen by all."
I:18462;1427;Superb cast, especially Natalie Wood and Rita Moreno.
I:18462;1428;The Academy Award winner for Best Motion Picture of 1961, this film ages extremely well with time.
I:18462;1429;it looks and sounds better than it ever has before.
I:18462;1430;it is and was always such a strong piece of music.
I:18462;1431;West Side Story has always been one of my favorite movies.
I:18462;1432;Every thing was so crisp and clear.
I:18462;1433;Good price, love the extras included
I:18462;1434;Had to get this classic, hope to enjoy it, again and again, hope my wife enjoys it also, great music.
I:18462;1435;key chorus of My Fair Lady, there's still a good deal of off.
I:18462;1436;, and leaves out some of the finest plot twists and most endearing characters from that play.
I:18462;1437;It is the best way to watch this film that takes Bernstein's music out onto the streets he wrote about.
I:18462;1438;What an edge the film would possess today if it had actually Hispanics instead of faux ones.
I:18462;1439;From the opening sequences, of spectacular overhead shots of upper Manhattan, to the first shots of the guys dancing on the street, you can tell you are in for something special.
I:18462;1440;But this is a completely jazzed up Berkeley, and the dancing possesses an edgy, energetic, hyped up style that had never before been witnessed onscreen.
I:18462;1441;The opening dance number, with woodwinds and horns battling out a melody, was unique in its blend of organized chaos, both in terms of orchestra and dancers.
I:18462;1442;Also a strong point, although he was a newcomer and unknown at the time, was the lyrics of a very young Stephen Sondheim.
I:18462;1443;"He would be involved in bigger and better things in the future, but what a way to break in!Although the highpoint of WEST SIDE STORY was its score and choreography, the songs interspersed through the story are frequently superb, from the great ""When You're a Jet"" that opens the film to the incredibly exhilarating ""America"" to the gloriously beautiful ""Somewhere"" one knows the songs are dramatically above average."
I:18462;1444;I was never a huge fan of the plot.
I:18462;1445;Marni Nixon was one of the great voiceover artists of her generation, but I still think the film would have been dramatically improved by casting an Hispanic actress who could sing in the lead role.
I:18462;1446;Richard Beymer is adequate in his role, but, again, they could have cast someone who could actually sing.
I:18462;1447;nonetheless, WEST SIDE STORY remains one of the great triumphs of the film musical.
I:18462;1448;It is entertaining, funny, exciting, and extraordinarily well photographed.
I:18462;1449;It is also one of the few times where popular entertainment seems to be blurring the line between it and serious art.
I:18462;1450;Being a huge fan of both the film and the series, they thus have become oddly linked in my mind.
I:18462;1451;This is a great box set edition of a classic movie.
I:18462;1452;Anyone who enjoys this movie would really enjoy this box set
I:18462;1453;Shakespeare's classic 'Romeo and Juliet,' is transported by Robert Wise, beyond the conventional movie musical, to modern.
I:18462;1454;The two young idealistic lovers enhance the attractiveness of two nice kids, caught in racial and ethnic barriers.
I:18462;1455;The film (nominated for an incredible 11 Academy Awards) took home an incredible 10 Oscars including Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor (George Chakaris), Best Supporting Actress (Rita Moreno), and Best Direction (Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins).
I:18462;1456;the opening of West Side Story is very innovative.
I:18462;1457;As the overture plays, an abstract design on the screen changes color and becomes a breathtaking aerial view of the island of Manhattan.
I:18462;1458;jerome Robbins's powerful choreography captures the explosive tension boiling in the big city slums.
I:18462;1459;The tender lyrics and poignant music complement and balance the tough nature of the choreography.
I:18462;1460;The songs advance the plot, and illustrate the action.
I:18462;1461;They range from jazzy and feverish to lyrical to comical, and they are all richly evocative of the film's moods and characters.
I:18462;1462;"in ""Maria,"" Tony gives voice to his feelings about the girl he has come to love."
I:18462;1463;"In ""I Feel Pretty,"" Maria describes her own reactions to the miracle of love."
I:18462;1464;"Their love blossoms out on a poignant scene in ""Tonight,"" and at a bridal shop (""One hand, One Heart"") when both affirm their love for each other by celebrating a mock marriage ceremony."
I:18462;1465;'West Side Story' is a beautiful work of art with spectacular music and energetic dancing.
I:18462;1466;It is surely the finest dance musical since 'Seven Brides for Seven Brothers.'
I:18462;1467;The principal dance numbers are all terrific.
I:18462;1468;Her skillful dancing and Latin temperament are perfect for the character of Anita, a fiery lady who leads her girls in an exciting mambo dance.
I:18462;1469;Life is alright in America is possibly the most triumphant sequence of the film.
I:18462;1470;A welcome tone of mockery is introduced, and the 'mambo' atmosphere makes you want to jump out of your seat and dance.
I:18462;1471;It breaks new ground in its depiction of contemporary social issues in a musical.
I:18462;1472;The motion picture explores with deep emotional resonance, a world of hate, violence and prejudice.
I:18462;1473;history will remember Leonard Bernstein as the most important American musical force in the 20th Century.
I:18462;1474;He is one of the greatest conductors that has ever lived.
I:18462;1475;In 'West Side Story' his superb music communicates directly with the heart.
I:18462;1476;The music is catchy and memorable.
I:18462;1477;I found myself humming a few of the songs for the next couple of days.
I:18462;1478;I'd have liked to see the musical score.
I:18462;1479;modern, which appeals to some and turns off others.
I:18462;1480;Great music, unusual and stunning choreography, and engaging, though sad, story.
I:18462;1481;Russ Tamblyn especially good in this role, as was Natalie Wood
I:18462;1482;I loved it when I first watched.
I:18462;1483;I have always enjoyed musicals, this is no exception.
I:18462;1484;It is a great classic musical anyone would enjoy.
I:18462;1485;The actors in it are great and the drama and music is wonderful.
I:18462;1486;Though the youngest members of your family will not necessarily get what subtlety exists in this epic romance, and there is much implied violence, this classic musical is an excellent introduction to today's generation the real heat, talent and creativity behind those GAP commercials.
I:18462;1487;"the score alone remains one of the most memorable and emotionally satisfying Broadway scores ever
I:18462;1488;Set in the real streets of New York, this movie has it all: a Romeo and Juliet love story, featuring the adorable and winning Natalie Wood, who despite the fact that she is lip.
I:18462;1489;synching to Marnie Nixon's lovely soprano, does a smashing job in the role of Maria.
I:18462;1490;Richard Beymer, who continued to play Tony onstage for many years, is goofily winning as Tony.
I:18462;1491;Rita Moreno adds fire and spice in the flashy role of Anita.
I:18462;1492;"Robert Wise, who would later helm The Sound Of Music, works magic with Jerome Robbins
I:18462;1493;I truly believe that if the right creative team took the chance on something as hip and well.
I:18462;1494;One of the 10 greatest and most influential Broadway musicals of all time, this movie version is worthy of watching, if only to see the amazingly gifted Rita Moreno as well as child.
I:18462;1495;provide innocence and charm to the most thankless role in the movie.
I:18462;1496;"This is simply because ""America"" is North America, Central America and South America."
I:18462;1497;This is the best package to order.
I:18462;1498;The footage is actually in Blu.
I:18462;1499;All in all good box set.
I:18462;1500;Still timely speaking volumes about the pain and stupidity of racism.
I:18462;1501;Great story (Romeo and Juliet) and awesome music (Leonard Bernstein).
I:18462;1502;She danced along with the movie!
I:18462;1503;The dance turned into fight immediately made an impression, as did the fantastic songs which fill the musical score by Leonard Bernstein and lyrics by Stephen Soundheim.
I:18462;1504;Winner of 10 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, this film version of the classic musical is one of those rare films which are as good as they are memorable.
I:18462;1505;taking Romeo and Juliet and updating it to 1950s New York City with music, West Side Story is about the forbidden love between two members of rival gangs.
I:18462;1506;This colorful winner of Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction and Best Costume Design is a vibrant film, and also one with an emotional punch within the storyline.
I:18462;1507;West Side Story is my second favorite musical of all time (second only to Grease.)
I:18462;1508;This is a definately more real and compelling story than Romeo and Juliet.
I:18462;1509;Maria and Tony are so real together.
I:18462;1510;The movie itself is brilliant.
I:18462;1511;The music and dance sequences are always vibrant and non.
I:18462;1512;stop and the music is electric and colorful.
I:18462;1513;The acting is wonderful, especially Natalie's, and Anita's.
I:18462;1514;All in all the film is excellent and it definately gives Skakespeare a run for his money.
I:18462;1515;I just viewed this movie AGAIN, but this time at a local theatre on the big screen, and I was SO impressed with the sheer energy and brilliance of this movie.
I:18462;1516;The dance numbers are amazing and my favorite just has to be the JETS dancing in the parking garage after they find out Biff has been killed.
I:18462;1517;Try not moving your body to that pulsing music!My mother loves to watch this movie at home with us whenever we're home, and she ALWAYS cries at the end.
I:18462;1518;She tells us every time that this was the first movie she ever cried at.
I:18462;1519;It is an astonishingly moving, entertaining, and engaging film, and will NEVER be topped.
I:18462;1520;thsn the Criterion Laser Disc I have, with all the interesting bonuses included (storyboards, screen tests, etc.) This is a classic movie in itself.
I:18462;1521;we will enjoy this for years to come.
I:18462;1522;The actors are pretty good (Try Beymer and Wood) some of themkind of stink (I won't name any names.)
I:18462;1523;The songs are pretty good too.
I:18462;1524;It's about the dance!Wonderful choreography by Jerome Robbins and the amazing tunes by the team of Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim, just take you away.
I:18462;1525;You can't help yourself, it's so mesmerizing and at times dark and depressing.
I:18462;1526;the production values are quite high.
I:18462;1527;11 Academy award nominations and winning ten.
I:18462;1528;the amazing choreography is just to die for.
I:18462;1529;I'd love to see these performed on stage someday.
I:18462;1530;story is good and good to see one of the best broadway musical
I:18462;1531;This movie is in retrospect, the best musical of all time.
I:18462;1532;With its deep mysertious characters and chaotic plot, the movie keeps you gripping your seat til the dramatic conclusion.
I:18462;1533;Overcome with emotion, Tony, who killed Bernardo after Bernardo killed Riff, wants to turn himself in, and finds himself unworthy of Maria's love.
I:18462;1534;Maria can't see the hate, she wishes to love everyone and everything.
I:18462;1535;The movie has many brilliant dance and song numbers, and a deep, revolving plot.
I:18462;1536;brings latin spirit and is a simply amazing seaquence to the film.
I:18462;1537;Winner of 11 Acadamy Awards, more than any musical has ever won, this movie clearly states all over it that it is a true classic.
I:18462;1538;West Side Story is a very good movie.
I:18462;1539;The way it portray's love between two people who really don't give a *Bleep* about what their friends or family think is just genious!
I:18462;1540;Tony and Maria just give off this vibe of wanting to feel the same love they have for each other.
I:18462;1541;"Rita Moreno's performance of ""Anita"" is just superb!"
I:18462;1542;Her being the only real Latina in the film made it even more special for all Latin people making it today.
I:18462;1543;He had told my mom that it was his favorite musical .
I:18462;1544;he really liked it when I presented it to him .
I:18462;1545;West Side Story is my favorite movie of all time.
I:18462;1546;When the time is right, I'll know it.
I:18462;1547;Even my grandchildren liked it.
I:18462;1548;Here's a classic musical about a star.
I:18462;1549;this is a good movie to revisit some memories.
I:18462;1550;"West Side Story met my expectations
I:18462;1551;really a good movie Natalie Wood is outstanding actress so very sad she died so young like to have her do more acting
I:18462;1552;I just turned 33 years old and I was pretty young when I first saw this movie.
I:18462;1553;As of this day, that movie still touches my heart.
I:18462;1554;If you like musicals, dancing and a wonderful movie plot this is the movie for you.
I:18462;1555;I love this movie and would recommend it to anyone.
I:18462;1556;This movie is definitely a 5 star movie !!!!
I:18462;1557;The music is really cool too!
I:18462;1558;The hole movie is wonderful!
I:18462;1559;If you like musicals, you'll love this movie!
I:18462;1560;The choreography is great, the music is great, the acting is great!
I:18462;1561;This film and story is always entertaining and filled with lots of beautiful music.
I:18462;1562;It makes for a good evening of entertainment.
I:18462;1563;Wonderful movie, outstanding dancing and ground breaking choreography.
I:18462;1564;There's not too much point in my writing a review of this movie, since everyone already knows it's great.
I:18462;1565;and I mean, I absolutely HATE .
I:18462;1566;but West Side Story is a shining and spectacular exception to the rule.
I:18462;1567;Not only is the story a beautiful one (after all, you can't improve on Shakespeare), not only are the actors and actresses uniformly superb, but the music is so well integrated into the plot and the characterizations that it almost never becomes the jarring influence that it is in so many other films.
I:18462;1568;Thumbs up, I love this thing.
I:18462;1569;The best modernized version of the classic Romeo and Juliet story yet created!
I:18462;1570;Memorable tunes and sharp wit are only a few things I could say to praise this film.
I:18462;1571;WEST SIDE STORY (1961, United Artists) is one spectacular movie musical and winner of eleven Academy Awards, including a special one for Jerome Robbins' brilliant choreography.
I:18462;1572;This is Shakespeare's ROMEO AND JULIET set to superb music, and you will never be able to read the play again without wanting the show's songs.
I:18462;1573;all repeat their roles in the brilliant Robert Wise movie (co. directed by Robbins), which has a screenplay by Ernest Lehman (who later worked with Wise on THE SOUND OF MUSIC, as did production designer Boris Leven).
I:18462;1574;we start with an enthralling prologue that combines knockout music with Saul Bass' excitingly colorful mosaic painting of lower Manhattan for five minutes.
I:18462;1575;Tony (Richard Beymer with a dubbed singing voice) loves Maria (Natalie Wood with a dubbed singing voice), who are on opposite sides in the gang war.
I:18462;1576;PEYTON PLACE's Russ Tamblyn sizzles as Riff, while George Chakiris won an Oscar as Bernardo, Maria's volatile brother.
I:18462;1577;Rita Moreno also won an Oscar as Anita, Maria's knowing sister.
I:18462;1578;Robert Wise gives it a cinematic excitement, helped by the magnificent color and camera movement of cinematographer Daniel Fapp.
I:18462;1579;And Jerome Robbins, also the choreographer, maintains the stage excitement for enthralling musical numbers.
I:18462;1580;Leven and Fapp deserved their Oscars for, respectively, sets and photography.
I:18462;1581;Officer Krupke on a sidewalk is hilarious.
I:18462;1582;"Right after the intermission, Maria does a poignant ""I Feel Pretty"" in her bedroom with a pretty orange and yellow dress."
I:18462;1583;Every single song in this show is a winner, and the choreography is so sensual and exciting.
I:18462;1584;"But it gets Tony and Maria up on the roof again for a powerful ""There's a Place For Us"", one of the show's very best numbers."
I:18462;1585;"The big number with them back on the street is ""Be Cool""."
I:18462;1586;the ending is tragic, stunning, and electrifying.
I:18462;1587;Somewhere, Somehow ends the show on a potent and sobering note.
I:18462;1588;WEST SIDE STORY is one of the g reat movie musicals of all time, the big Oscar winner of 1961, including Saul Bass' creative end credits.
I:18462;1589;It is priced to sell to families for around $20, has two audio commentaries, a filmmaking documentary, a songs.
I:18462;1590;along, and a look at the seven kids then and now.
I:18462;1591;unseen, it sounds like a very nice Christmas present.
I:18462;1592;The movie would be a lot less fine without their superb performances.
I:18462;1593;But Bernstein riffs have POWER, and West Side Story captured the American experience.
I:18462;1594;What a solid piece of entertainment.
I:18462;1595;Captures the 50's 60's feeling very very well.
I:18462;1596;enjoy it, if I could guarantee it I would.
I:18462;1597;but chances are if you lived through the entire sixties you will identify with this classic piece of art history.
I:18462;1598;Thanks Carol, thanks for the memories that reconnect me to my Pennsylvania roots and time gone by.
I:18462;1599;See it, and hear it again you won't regret it.
I:18462;1600;I have loved this film for 40yrs.
I:18462;1601;The dancing, the singing, and the story is incredible.
I:18462;1602;My favorite musical of all time and the story is timeless.
I:18462;1603;to take advantage of the angles for the wonderfully vibrant dance sequences.
I:18462;1604;Great musical movie with outstanding dancing and acting.
I:18462;1605;Would love to see more of this type of movie!
I:18462;1606;"My 9 year old wanted to see this after her Spanish teacher played ""America"" in class."
I:18462;1607;We loved warching it together, the music and dancing is timeless.
I:18462;1608;I had to explain what prejudice is, which is a good sign.
I:18462;1609;This was a Christmas gift and my daughter just loves it!
I:18462;1610;Shows that the music is good for all generations
I:18462;1611;As most audiences know, West Side Story is a modern.
I:18462;1612;smart direction by Robert Wise to Jerome Robbins' innovative choreography which melds raucous athleticism with balletic grace and precision, West Side Story is an unqualified triumph.
I:18462;1613;leonard Bernstein's vibrant, inventive, and uncommonly beautiful melodies challenge and engulf the audiences' senses.
I:18462;1614;Bernstein's score is still one of the finest ever written for theater or film.
I:18462;1615;stephen Sondheim's verse is poetic and socially relevant.
I:18462;1616;Sondheim expresses himself with economy and clarity which are highly effective.
I:18462;1617;there are few musicals on stage or on screen as riveting as West Side Story .
I:18462;1618;Good music and fantastic choreograph.
I:18462;1619;Although this is an old movie it still gives a warm romantic feeling with a premonition of doom.
I:18462;1620;This is my favorite movie of all time.
I:18462;1621;Not a huge fan of musicals but this one has great story of love and hate and the perfect music to go with it.
I:18462;1622;It is a classic and I wanted a copy for future reference.
I:18462;1623;I am very happy with it as are all your Amazon products.
I:18462;1624;imaginative and so tight .
I:18462;1625;but you add that to the songs and it's the whole package.
I:18462;1626;Not so on the SLE version, which does a much better job of immersing you in the audio.
I:18462;1627;Still one of the greatest movies ever, and if you don't already own it, I highly recommend it.
I:18462;1628;West Side Story is the best musical ever made.
I:18462;1629;Everything about this movie is excellent .
I:18462;1630;the acting, the singing, the story line/plot and especially the dancing!
I:18462;1631;This is the best movie ever created and that is all that needs to be said.
I:18462;1632;"Anyone with knowledge of 1960's cinema knows ""West Side Story"", probably one of the greatest movie musicals in history."
I:18462;1633;"Everything from Robert Wise's and Jerome Robbin's superb direction to the flawless acting performances of Natalie Wood, Rita Moreno, and Richard Beymer, ""West Side Story"" succeeds on all fronts."
I:18462;1634;crossed love story set against the backdrop of 1950's New York City gang life, the movie is known for its beautiful score and music.
I:18462;1635;"Memorable songs include ""Maria"", ""America"", and ""Somewhere"", and performed with some of the most unforgettable choreography in film."
I:18462;1636;winner of an outstanding 10 Academy Awards including Best Picture of 1961 the movie made Natalie Wood a boxoffice queen and Rita Moreno a well.
I:18462;1637;The film holds the record as being the only movie musical to garner the most Oscar wins.
I:18462;1638;this exquiste box set is simply breathtaking.
I:18462;1639;Bonuses include a book that houses the film's entire script with rare photographs.
I:18462;1640;"Also included are trailers, a ""West Side Story"" documentary, and much more."
I:18462;1641;Not just a musical, thought that part is excellent as well.
I:18462;1642;This has just enough heft to make this modern day take on Romeo and Juliet just as heart.
I:18462;1643;The theam is almost timeless, and the songs are first rate.
I:18462;1644;Anyone who enjoys good music, and/or acting should make an effort to view this film.
I:18462;1645;There is no denying this fact: West Side Story is arguably one of the best musicals ever made into a movie.
I:18462;1646;Many people would argue it's THE best musical.
I:18462;1647;It had a great book that came with, all these special features, etc.
I:18462;1648;There is something worthwhile, I will say, about the blue ray disc .
I:18462;1649;"I don't make a claim like this lightly, but I honestly do think that ""West Side Story"" is an improvement upon its source material, William Shakespeare's play ""The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet""."
I:18462;1650;"what I mean is this: what is added to ""West Side Story"" vis."
I:18462;1651;rather, there is a ray of hope amidst the sadness.
I:18462;1652;It was there in the Shakespeare play and it's present here as well.
I:18462;1653;"Because of all this, I believe that ""West Side Story"" is a true improvement upon the original source material, and that I can say this without knocking the original Shakespeare play."
I:18462;1654;West Side Story is an amazing piece of American film history that exemplifies Leonard Bernstein's passion to tell a story with his music so that audiences will enjoy the experience and share his emotions.
I:18462;1655;In one work, it is an opera, a ballet, and a dramatic theatrical performance that succeeds because his music is still as exciting today as it was in 1957.
I:18462;1656;His music also served as the inspiration for Oscar Peterson and Stan Kenton to develop their own jazzier versions of the compositions.
I:18462;1657;I own all of these variants of West Side Story (The Making Of WSS, as well as Peterson's and Kenton's works), and they are a tribute to Bernstein's genius not only as a composer, but as an artist who inspires others through his work.
I:18462;1658;This is probably a great movie.
I:18462;1659;Watching the movie on my Kindle Fire was pretty cool.
I:18462;1660;every aspect is so strong,.
I:18462;1661;Very enjoyable and production was very good.
I:18462;1662;This was a very good movie to watch and enjoy!
I:18462;1663;She likes musicals and it's fun to see her enjoy it as we did when it first came out in the theaters.
I:18462;1664;This is one of those movies that just stays.
I:18462;1665;When I first saw the trailer, I found that hard to believe, but when I saw the movie, I came to the conclusion it's the truth.
I:18462;1666;the movie is a classic that just grabs your heart.
I:18462;1667;this '60's Romeo and Juliet kind of story is maqnificent!The dancing, the acting, the singing, the characters, the sets ,the feeling .>
I:18462;1668;You can see that much time and work has been put in this movie.
I:18462;1669;"Breathtaking!With songs like ""Maria"", ""Somewhere"", ""One hand, one Heart"" , ""Tonight"", this movie will leave a mark in your mind and your heart."
I:18462;1670;even if the movie is over 40 years old, it keeps entertaining and one of a kind.
I:18462;1671;oh so old, but oh so beautiful.
I:18462;1672;One of the best movies of all time.
I:18462;1673;Another childhood favorite and so I had to have it.
I:18462;1674;It has the full script included.
I:18462;1675;That was fun to read through.
I:18462;1676;West Side Story is one Broadway musical that is often considered an exception to this rule and seems better on film.
I:18462;1677;"Even though MGM's Golden Days of Musicals had long ended when ""West Side Story"" was filmed, we see the former glory of this great studio in this film."
I:18462;1678;The singing is great, the dancing leaves a viewer spellbound, and the story is timeless.
I:18462;1679;It is a great film and deserves its rightful place in film history.
I:18462;1680;Got this on time and boxed up so well that it was in pristine condition when I opened it.
I:18462;1681;you are a West Side Story fan as I am, you will enjoy this great blu.
I:18462;1682;I particularly liked the commentary on the dance sequences.
I:18462;1683;It was really well done and highly informative.
I:18462;1684;A real treat to sit down and watch.
I:18462;1685;In the middle is a gang war between the Jets and the Sharks.
I:18462;1686;The revised audio works great on my 7.1 Dolby system, the old stereo sound gone.
I:18462;1687;Also the images are stunning.
I:18462;1688;Amazing what they can do these days.
I:18462;1689;This movie is as great as it was when it first came out for viewing.
I:18462;1690;Great actors and just an overall great movie for all ages!!!
I:18462;1691;It also contains 8 artcards and hardcover indeed.
I:18462;1692;One of the best musicals ever made.
I:18462;1693;This is also where most of the films strength comes from.
I:18462;1694;They are having a great time on screen and it's infectious!With respect to Natalie Wood and Richard Beymer I found myself tuning out after the first of many songs where they declare there love for one another.
I:18462;1695;The love/hate stories about perfectionist Jerome Robbins are entertaining and informative.
I:18462;1696;You have a deeper respect for the dancers.
I:18462;1697;Particularly after Play it Cool.
I:18462;1698;Not to mention the archive footage is really neat and I liked hearing the difference between Woods and Nixon.
I:18462;1699;The special features may less than expected, but it's a great addition for a collector and fans of the genre.
I:18462;1700;one of the greatest movies/musiclas ever.
I:18462;1701;Bought it for my 13 year old because she truly loves it.
I:18462;1702;Thanks so much and the price, love it !
I:18462;1703;One of the most wonderful and happy films ever made.
I:18462;1704;is not only a great musical, the story is really clever and full of wonderfull insights that deal with the process of making movies.
I:18462;1705;deservely, one of the ten best films ever made!
I:18462;1706;I actually gave it as a gift for a friend.
I:18462;1707;He also loves this movie!!!!
I:18462;1708;There is singing in it?
I:18462;1709;With a young Natalie Wood and it being the Full Screen Edition it's more than one could hope for!
I:18462;1710;It's a great film and I wish that they made more like them these days.
I:18462;1711;The final scence still makes me shed a tear.
I:18462;1712;My all time favorite movie and musical.
I:18462;1713;Romantically speaking, the delicate crescendo of unfinished love dominates this powerful classic (easily one of the finest dramatic musicals ever produced).
I:18462;1714;The unfolding of love, passion, and intimacy between Tony and Maria, like the riptide, spills into the soul of this film.
I:18462;1715;Their whispered and orchestrated words on the balcony create nuances beyond the realm of normal drama.
I:18462;1716;Their marriage before God establishes their union, solidifies the romantic crescendo, and allows Maria to mourn her husband's death at the end.
I:18462;1717;all meetings between Tony (played by Richard Beymer) and Maria (played by Natalie Wood) are stunning in presentation.
I:18462;1718;The musical overtures are superb, the dancing is brilliant, and the conflict between the Jets and Sharks (women included) has its own originality in classical terms.
I:18462;1719;"Yet, Maria alone commands the stage in virtually all tender moments (except those involving Anita)
I:18462;1720;"In truth, this masterpiece resides in both categories, tragedy and romance
I:18462;1721;Our catharsis is directly affected by Maria's youthful passion related to unfinished love in its most delicate stages.
I:18462;1722;A wonderful story of love and immigration to America.
I:18462;1723;West Side Story is one of the best Romeo and Juliet remakes everwith great music by Leonard Bernstein.
I:18462;1724;the customer service where I bought it was very nice though.
I:18462;1725;A timeless classic that I never get tired of watching and enjoying.
I:18462;1726;The music, acting, and setting converge to make this a fantastic movie experience.
I:18462;1727;I had seen this in a theater many years ago and, liking musicals, I loved it then.
I:18462;1728;She played the older friend of Natalie Wood's character, Maria.
I:18462;1729;They talk of willing suspension of disbelief in literature, and of course in a musical that is required.
I:18462;1730;Still, there is a beautiful story here and while it seemed to me to have a slower wind up at this point in my life, it still had a good pitch.
I:18462;1731;(No musical pun intended) Rita who is in her 80s now still looks amazing.
I:18462;1732;She was certainly among the most beautiful if not the most beautiful women of her generation.
I:18462;1733;This film, for any person who loves music, still holds up.
I:18462;1734;One of the Greatest Musicals and the most acclaimed of all time over 50 years old and still looks fresh in Blu.
I:18462;1735;ray 50th Anniversary Edition, a Film with a memorable Music Score you will be humming the Tunes for days.
I:18462;1736;This 1961 film version of of Stephen Sondheim and Leonard Bernstein's stage hit begins hopefully.
I:18462;1737;The camerawork, editing, choreography (by Jerome Robbins) and, most of all, music, pulsate with dazzling energy.
I:18462;1738;and at a great price.
I:18462;1739;It's my All time favorite musical, the dancing and singing, just a classic., my kids hates I when I sing along with the movie when the song I wanna be in America.
I:18462;1740;This is truly a tale of love and deceit, racism, tolerance, class, culture, barrier breakers, hope, hopelessness and hatred.
I:18462;1741;The tale of love keeps popping up above all the other negative attributes which create and drive the storyline.
I:18462;1742;I totally understood it then and now 53 years later, the story is still as fresh and relevant and poignant as it was to me, in 1961.
I:18462;1743;The music and choreography are amazing .
I:18462;1744;so musical so romantic and all about this movie.
I:18462;1745;Winning 10 academy Awards make this movie so special.
