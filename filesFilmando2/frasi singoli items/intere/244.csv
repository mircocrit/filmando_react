58;A (so many scenes in the movie were hilarious)story.
59;The daughter of a wealthy politician got kidnapped """"unexpectedly"""" ( yeah, right!)"""
60;Cris T. was extremely funny in this movie)
61;This is such a funny movie, that is if you can stand Chris Tucker.
62;Chris Tucker's job is to keep an eye on Jackie and to keep him from assisting.
63;These two are really funny together.
64;The movie has a lot of great action scenes, which I'm sure took a lot of time to rehearse.

66;this movie is the best movie that was ever made
67;Chan and tucker have really good chemistry on this series of movies a must see this one

69;Chris Tucker has some of the funniest lines, the best being Alright, which one of y'all kicked me?
70;I loved the credits, where they showed the bloopers.
71;but I always get a kick out of those.
72;This aside, the film is quite good.
73;This is a very funny, extremely action packed movie.
74;This one makes you laugh and yell out loud!
75;A classic buddy cop movie from childhood with acrion star Jackie Chan doing his usual fight scenes.
76;Chris Tucker is funny as always.
77;Made in the USA isn't necessarily a good thing and this film is a prime example.
78;Even in Jackie's Hong Kong films where the plots make very little sense there is some originality involved.
79;He has William Shatner's moves too.
80;The stunts are an incredible let down and the fight scenes are anemic.
81;The fight with Jackie and Tucker hand.
82;cuffed together was done much better in Project A II.
83;For a better US buddy film with Jackie Chan and a somewhat more talented actor than Chris Tucker check out the superior Shanghi Noon with Owen Wilson, or better yet get Jackie Chan's Hong Kong films and 48 Hours, one of the better of the buddy cop films.
84;Exciting, funny, action packed even.
85;This was a good movie, I've just seen it so many times that the 2nd one is just as good as this, but this one's actually better!!!

105;Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan have onscreen chemistry that shines in this film.
106;granted, this film wont win any points for originality as neither the plot, nor any of the gags are original, but Chan and Tucker infuse the movie with pure fun.
107;jackie Chan delivers with his usual combination of Brce Lee meets Buster Keaton formula that always makes his movies good clean fun.
108;so if youre looking for a great Hollywood style actioner with Honk Kong style thrills, then this is the movie for you!
109;This is one of the funniest movies that I have ever seen in my life(besides two and three).
110;Chris Tucker is a great offset to Jackie.

112;Thumbs up to you guys awsome
113;These two somehow manage to take an edge of your seat story and make it hilarious!
114;Jackie is amazing does all of his stunts I think, he is one of the most talented actors and sings very well and he always looks so happy, in excellent shape.
115;'Rush Hour' continues that great tradition of Hollywood popular cinema as set by D. w. Griffith, John Ford and Frank Capra, in which foreigners and outsiders to the dominant white culture are absorbed into that shimmering ideal: America.
116;And what is particularly winning about 'Rush Hour' is that these 'serious' themes are integrated with the lightest of touches: where Capra would have hectored his audience with platidunous speeches, 'Rush Hour' offers delightful verbal riffs, hilarious musical interludes, and, that old stomping ground of clashing cultures, food.
117;more important than the thematic stuff is that 'Rush Hour' is a very rare thing in contemporary Hollywood: a fast and funny comedy thriller.
118;mouthed, slightly bent Chris Tucker, and humorous but disciplined Jackie Chan is sheer pleasure, at once relaxed and intense.
119;The dialogue has more than its fair share of classic wisecracks.
120;But best of all, in this age of hamfisted advertising graduates and jaded hacks, is that Brett Ratner knows how to direct and pace an action movie, helped immeasurably by the maestro of slick soundtracks, Lalo Schifrin.
121;Chan may be moving down a gear for his American audience, but his body's flexibility is a wonder.
122;Pauline Kael once compared Bruce Lee to Fred Astaire: Chan must be Gene Kelly, his inventive use of props for dazzling choreographic effect (see in particular the climactic business with a millenia.
123;ancient vase) is at once physical, weightless and always witty.
124;Fast action and hillarious moments.
125;A great venue for cross.
126;A perfect film for someone looking for an easy to watch, laughs and punch.
127;this is an awesome movie chris tucker and jackie chan are the best comedy duo since walter matthau and jack lemon.
128;Jackie Chan has come to America and scored a huge hit, thanks to his undeniable charm, daring athleticism, and deft physical comedy.
129;The movie's plot may not be much, but the pairing of Chan and Tucker is definitely worth watching.
130;He speaks five languages .
131;I certainly don't speak Chinese, and have taken French for 3 years, but can't really speak it either, and English is the hardest language in the world to learn, blowing away the English to French or Spanish transition by a long shot.
132;Chan speaks more with his expressive face and body language, and wonderfully brilliant ballet.
133;he's made many films with much more in the way of fantastic choreography and jaw.
134;His timing with physical comedy is also among the best in the business.
135;The language barrier aside, Chan is one of the most talented all around performers ever, and watching him on screen is a joy.
136;The American production values and English language of this film served to open it up to a wider audience, which Chan definitely deserves.
137;Hopefully he'll have the power now to make Hollywood Blockbusters with more of the trademark Jackie elements in them.
138;great movie, and the end they show retakes, funny stuff :) I am disappointed that rush hour 2 and 3 are not included with our prime membership.
139;rush Hour also includes two full length music videos(Dru Hill.
140;How Deep Is Your Love and the other is a bonus (Heavy D. Nutting but Love ).
141;a bonus for you PC users.
142;over all I enjoyed movie.
143;It Was good for me.
144;Funny, has a great story and they really click together!
145;He is so funny and I enjoy the humor of it all!
146;This is a great movie if you need to laugh.

148;I really like it, and I can't stop having fun every time I see it.
149;For me, it's a classic movie with lots of action and lots of fun.
150;i really recommend this movie for any Jackie fan!
151;It is truly a gem.
152;the movie is funny and interesting enough.
153;I enjoyed the physical interactions between Jackie and Chris Tucker.
154;I think the stunts were wonderfully orchestrated.
155;Jackie Chan is a genius at physical comedy.
156;This movie was just great.
157;Chris Tucker was just hysterical and Jackie Chan was brilliant with his incredible stunts.
158;If you want to see a fantastic action comedy, I recommend you get Rush Hour.
159;even though this movie isn't a collector's edition and doesn't contain two discs, the special features are still pretty good.
160;It has a widescreen format, the theatrical trailer, informative and pretty interesting documentaries, making, and best of all, the deleted scenes.
161;I recommend you get this movie right NOW!!!
162;Rush Hour is an action film with a comic side to it.
163;Tucker and Chan do a good job acting together.
164;This was one of the most popular movies of 1998 and for good reason.
165;It was and still is one of the funniest and best of the buddy action comedies.
166;Chris Tucker hasn't been seen much since Rush Hour 2 but he is a great comic actor and I'm suprised his popularity didn't skyrocket and get him plenty of roles after this hilarious performance.
167;Jackie Chan also does a good job in his role.
168;"Everyone knows he's not a very good ""actor"" but he is a great ""star""
169;The chemistry between Chan and Tucker is great.
170;Chan plays a great straight man to Tucker's over the top role.
171;1 takes care of introducing everyone to one of the best buddy.
172;great to watch an old action flick.
173;It's probably the best of the three movies.
174;Both Chan and Tucker were really good.
175;It's an old movie at this point, but it's still really funny and entertaining to watch.
176;fast moving and lots of things going on.
177;I forgot how funny it was since I hadn't seen it in such a long time.
178;Nice to see it again.
179;I'm a big Jackie Chan fan.
180;I used to love this film when I was younger.
181;This is the best one of the Rush Hour series.
182;Chris Tucker keeps you laughing.
183;this is a pretty good movie.
184;it's an action adventure comedy.
185;there isn't a lot ofcomedy,but comedy bits there are,are pretty funny.
186;jackie Chan'sacrobatic,over the top cartoonish martial arts moves are funny.
187;chrisTucker's motor mouth character is pretty funny at times.
188;also theteaming of Chan and Tucker is a great idea.
189;i liked their backand forth banter.
190;These guys are electric together.
191;The culture clash is histerical with lots of action!
192;Good movie best in series, hope they make a fourth.
193;This is a good movie for family or just a silid watch.
194;My son is practicing Martial Arts so he really enjoys the fighting scenes.
195;The two lead characters are funny and the story line is engaging enough for the entire family.
196;The whole family enjoys it.
197;Jackie Chan's stunts are so well done it's fun to see what he's going to do next!
198;If you want a lot of a little bit of everything mixed together with a good plot then this movie is for you!
199;rack movie was something new for me.
200;It was amusing, to be sure.
201;It'd complicated, but makes good sense if you are viewing the movie.
202;It's fun to watch them try to get away from one another early in the movie to becoming a very effective team at the end.
203;there's action, action, action in this movie and it pays to keep a sharp eye in that some of the stunts can go by so fast as to be almost invisible if you aren't glued to the visual scene.
204;In particular, the fighting is just incredible.
205;A lot of the stunts are not only amazing physical feats, they're funny.
206;It's an amusing movie and Chan and Tucker play well off of one another.
207;action movie with really incredible and amusing stunts.
208;Rush Hour revitalized the buddy action flicks of the 80's and has become a modern classic.
209;It is a movie in the tradition of 48 Hrs and Lethal Weapon, and like those two movies, it has perfect casting.
210;Chris Tucker is hysterical in his best performance since Friday, Jackie Chan is in top form, complete with incredible stunts, cool martial arts and hilarious broken English.
211;written and full of funny situations for both Tucker and Chan.
212;The chemistry between the two leads is probably what makes this movie so great.
213;All this makes Rush Hour a guaranteed good time.
214;sure, Chris Tucker is funny.
215;That reeeally got under my skin.
216;Some good action scenes throughout and the usual humor.
217;The paring of Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker was indeed a good match.
218;These guys feed off of each other very well.
219;Tucker really brightens up the screen with his personality and antics.
220;This movie is a great action comedy!Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan star is movie where a little girl is kidnapped.
221;directed by Brett Ratner, this is a must see for everyone!
222;First off, I just want to say that this is a great movie.
223;It has something for everyone, including action and comedy.
224;an interesting point by the modest director is that henever dreamed the film would be a huge hit.
225;Partially a martial arts movie, but also, a comedy.
226;A laugh a minute, as they say.
227;recommended for fans of Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan.
228;I have seen this movie 4 times and it made me laugh each time!
229;I STRONGLY recommend it to anyone over age 10!
230;Both my husband and I enjoyed this movie.
231;Good for a laxy night and a laugh.
232;I'm a Jackie Chan fan and have been for years.
233;His constant yammering and high.
234;I love this movie .
235;I think it is one of the classic comedic movies around!
236;This was one of the best Action/comedy flicks to drop in 99.
237;He said 50 million and chris said 50 MIllion!
238;Don't think that it's all jokes alone because they bring up some serious things in the movie like how easy it is to smuggle certain stuff over to the U. s. with the right connections.
239;He finds himself involuntarily teamed up with LAPD's most arrogant, but hilarious, officer.
240;these two actors play wonderfully off of each other.
241;I highly recommend this flick!
242;I'm telling you the truth.
243;A decent plot and Tuckers humor brought this film to one of the top grossing films of the year with over 100 million in box office gross.
244;With good performances by both Chan and Tucker this is a good starter for those who say they dont like Jackie Chan movies.
245;these two guys are jus funny together they do a great job and the action is very good.
246;It was a great combination of action and hilarious comedy.
247;But I have some reservations about the movie with Jackie in it.
248;His voice sets my teeth on edge.
249;This is usually what makes Jackie's films so special , though as he is getting older it makes sense that he does not take so many risks.
250;So though it is a good film to watch and enjoy I still don't consider it a real Jackie Chan film!
251;This is a fun movie that the whole family can watch, minus some minor swear words.
252;Shanghai Noon is still my favorite.
253;I received this item and I think or it may be from shipping because when I opened it brand new the disc was not in its right position.
254;the combination of these two with this writing was pretty funny.
255;Somehow it came together really well in this movie.
256;The way Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker interact and play off each other is so hilarious.
257;Jackie Chan's Hollywood career got a second break with Rush Hour and the plot has more substance than most Jackie Chan movies.
258;we got James Carter, played by Chris Tucker, who is an LAPD detective with a penchant for dancing Michael Jackson.
259;style while blowing up blocks of buildings.
260;The FBI want Carter and Lee to not interfere with the investigation of the kidnapping of the Chinese Consul's daughter, but Lee and Carter do anyway, in their own charismatic manner and triumph where the FBI fail.
261;the martial arts expertise of Jackie Chan is fantastic and shows that his truly a master in what he does.
262;Chris Tucker does a terrific job of playing the off the wall LAPD officer who trys to keep Chan's character out of the way of an investigation.
263;Chris Tucker is an extremely well disciplined actor, and seems to go very smoothly with the styles of Jackie Chan.
264;Rush Hour is nothing to take seriously, but it is fun to watch.
265;The movie was very action pack with plenty of excitement!
266;Ireally think Jackie Chan was wonderful and is a great actor.
267;Although this not Jackie Chan's first movie in a police/martial arts role, it is the first in which he has actually spoken english.
268;in my opinion, what give Jackie his edge is that he does all his highly skilled stunts by himself, absolutely no stunt doubles.
269;now, he enters the US market with its biggest mouth, Chris Tucker.
270;class acting and wonderful mixture of both humor and action whilst keeping them apart when required.
271;I love this movie, it's always been one of my favorites for a long time, funniest movie ever!!
272;The best I've seen in years.
273;She loved it, and has started using Jackie Chan to describe artful fighting behaviors in the name of justice .
274;I am not sure Jackie Chan would have started doing flips and kicking people over half eaten bowls of cereal in left in the living room, but it is a fun picture to carry in my head.
275;Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker are sensational.
276;And some pretty good action too.
277;great movie but a bit grainy.
278;Cant really complain on the kuro since everything looks great on that set
279;comedy that has the right ingredients to make one of 1998's most popular movies!
280;Chan and Tucker make a great team together.
281;The movie has a perfect mix of action, laughs, and stunts from Chan, it's the best work Brett Ratner has done and the sequel is even better.
282;rom extras and music video by Dru Hill.
283;This is one of the best Jackie Chan movies ever.
284;I'm glad they included Chris Tucker in it to make it funny.
285;In the sequels, Chris Tucker is given top billing and Chan plays the co. star during action scenes.
286;The music by Lalo Schifrin is very good.
287;Brett Ratner did a decent job directing the film.
288;There's rap, disco and classic R&B"
289;He wanted to make a romantic.
290;Rex Linn and Mark Rolston are quite good as FBI agents.
291;Rush Hour is a solid, fun action comedy from the 1990's.
292;Very funny movie, good to watch with the family, I think this is the best of the trilogy.
293;Jackie Chan and Chris Rock steal the show.
294;This is a must see for martial arts fanatics and like an excellent comedy as well.
295;This is a fun movie with a little bit of action.
296;Chris tucker and Jackie chan forms a nice duo
297;Mainly because of the huge difference in the two actors.
298;Well after watching I realized that the two are perfect together.
299;While the other is a cool, slick cop who likes women and having a good time.
300;This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time so I would say try it out.
301;Very funny and a lot of laugh.
302;Jackie Chan's good, but I like Chris Tucker's performance more.
303;It still makes me laugh.
304;Wow it my favorite movie it's and adventure and action lovely movie though and is very educative.
305;If that doesn't bother you, it's a funny movie.
306;This is an excellent film.
307;syndrome, in which you tensely twist your body this way and that as you watch.
308;Chan and Tucker work well together and seem to enjoy doing so, which helps.
309;Your mileage may vary, but you'll probably enjoy it quite a lot .
310;"Lots of Action
311;this movie is very good if you like these two together"
312;The 2nd one is better though!
313;I prefer to watch movies more than any TV show.
314;There is a movie that stays and will stay in my mind.
315;Jackie Chan's role is Officer Lee and Chris Tucker plays Detective Carter.
316;Officer Lee is good in action, and Detective Carter is good in comedy.
317;The movie starts in a very interesting way.
318;Here are some quotes that make the movie funny.
319;What is special about this movie is the action of Jackie Chan and the comedy of Chris Tucker.

358;Let's face it: Jackie is the man.
359;It's thanks to his risky stunts and his goofy attitude that action films are where they are today.
360;I've seen him in other movies and I think he's funny.

369;This movie definitely keeps your interest, will make you laugh, and keep you delighted throughout.
370;Just another Jackie Chan movie, you thought?
371;You can always expect great human from Chan and Tucker!
372;The sequel is funny too, which typically does not happen as most sequels usually are not very good.
373;This is a nice comedy to have for times when you need to chill out.
374;Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker make an outstanding opposites attract team.
375;Matching Chan's action with Tucker's humor is priceless.
376;A must see for action movie lovers.
377;It ranks up there with other great comedies like ARTHUR and LIAR LIAR !
378;Even if you're NOT a martial arts fan, you'll love it!
379;and the best part is when Chris Tucker Says The N Word.
380;Rush Hour has to be one of my favorite movies of all time.
381;Brett Ratner does a good job of directing, and showing the opposition and chemistry between Tucker and Chan.
382;A comedy that never gets old, and is sure to become a cult classic from the mini major New Line Cinemas.
383;Very entertaining and funny. . . . . . . . . .
384;This movie is funny and has action!
385;, there are plenty of special features and the case i got was very good and I there are no skips
386;Jackie Chan, the great Chinese action star, plays a Hong Kong detective at the time of China's taking control of the city.
387;You've already guess that the two policemen get along at first like cats and dogs, but by the end of the picture, they are best buddies.
388;as a comedy team, Chan and Tucker work well together.
389;american does create a lot of opportunity for humor.
390;Opposing tastes in food is a good topic, as is the language barrier.
391;What carries the movie is the teaming of two actors whose personalities work well together.
392;lalo Schifin delivers a fine musical score.
393;while Rush Hour is often entertaining, it does not measure up to a couple of similarly themed comedies .
394;Classic Jackie Chan and funny Chris Tucker.
395;Go watch it and laugh.
396;Enjoyable action film starring Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan.
397;Great Action scenes and a lot of laughs from Tucker (who definitely seems to be a cross between Eddie Murphy and Jaleel White .
398;Most humour is wasted on him, but he can be funny in an innocent way.
399;art skills make up for it.
400;That said, I'll add that Jackie Chan is a god .
401;jackie being the hero, Chris Tucker the comic relief.
402;One of the best action.
403;This is an enjoyable film and out of the trilogy is the best.
404;Jackie Chan does a great job as always with his martial arts and stunts, and Chris Tucker provides the nice comedic relief to Jackie's taciturnity.
405;"The original ""Rush Hour"" remains one of my favorite movies of all time."
406;Jackie and Chris have great on screen chemistry, and the fights are absolutely classic.
407;The film also has fantastic stunts, a wonderful plot, and a great score by Lalo Schifrin.
408;If you love Jackie, and want to see one of his best american films, look no further.
409;What is it good for, absolutely no.
410;Actually this one was very good.
411;When I first watched it I was on the edge of my seat almost all the time.
412;Not to mention that it is very funny.
413;I like it a lot.
414;One of my all time favorite movies.
415;Always makes me feel better!
416;My daughter an I love watching it together and laughing
417;this is a great, hilarious movie with great stars.
418;just as good as the movie itself.
419;I definitely love actors that can laugh at themselves.
420;One of the reasons I still like my videos.
421;you will have a rolicking good time with this one .
422;This is a great movie.
423;so funny and with action and adventure, too.
424;These two actors have a great chemistry.
425;Pop some corn and enjoy.
426;this ones a winner, theres no doubt about it.
427;Tucker and Chan work great and the action and comedy really blend together.
428;Very funny moments include Tucker terroizing an old man because he has marijuana.
429;"That's due to the fact that Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker work together beautifully
430;Tucker's voice in itself is unique.
431;Oscar nominee Tom Wilkinson makes a cooly malevolent villain, and the movie moves at a frenetic pace with the expected well executed fight scenes.
432;But the movie is all Chan and Tucker, and being a box office smash, we got the inevitable sequel which I haven't seen yet, but hopefully it will be as mindlessly entertaining!
433;One good point was Jackie Chan.
434;He was the best actor in this movie by a longshot.
435;Another good point about this movie is the sequence of the movie.
436;The way the story was planned out was so overused and trite, but they did a good job of turning the story into a good action story with some funny sequences in.
437;Jackie Chan is the funniest man alive and he shows you why in this movie.
438;Chris Tucker was very loud and funny as usual.
439;They make a good duo and it is very cool at the end.
440;But this movie is extremely funny.
441;I think Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan are a classic couple.
442;I'm a big Jackie Chan fan, and I know everyone says he's done better films, but I don't care, in my opinion this is his best movie yet.
443;dubbed movie, and it's actually really funny.
444;The comedy comes mainly from Chris Tucker, who does a great job of getting laughs at every turn.
445;Chris Tucker(who is so sexy) steals the show.
446;Chris and Jackie Chan are such a great duo they will have you crying from the great on screen chemistry they share.
447;The action in this movie is good.
448;A great movie to have in your possession.
449;I watched this film more than 10 times and I really enjoy the action fun of the two heros,Tucker and Chan.
450;he has really a great talent more than any of Hollywood heros.
451;The action is good, the dialogue is funny and the chemistry between Chan and Tucker is surprisingly good.
452;Not as good as its sequel but does enough to satisfy all Chan fans and fans of action/comedy movies in general.
453;Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker sure are hilarious in this movie, but I think that he should it easy down the stairs!
454;Now Tucker, he is darn hilarious!
455;But he also is has to take it easy on the punching, but overall he is a great actor like my friend Jackie!
456;Rush Hour is a great movie.
457;It combines the action and character of Hong Kong and Jackie Chan with the style and comedy of America and Chris Tucker.
458;The interaction between the cocky American and the out of place Chinese is hilarious as they put each other in their respective places.
459;The success of this film has proven that Jackie Chan has his place set out in Hollywood.
460;Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan are great in the movie.
461;It will keep you laughing all the way through the movie.
462;This movie is hella funny!
463;Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker make a great combination!
464;This is about as funny as Friday with less swearing!
465;Everybody needs to see this!
466;Rush Hour is, without a doubt, the most funniest, most surprising action comedies ever made!
467;And more importantly, I think that Rush Hour was Chris Tucker's breakthrough film since he first appeared in Friday .
468;Rush Hour calls the attention to Jackie Chan as Inspector Lee, a detective from Hong Kong who travels to L. a. after he finds out that the daughter of a Chinese diplomat has been kidnapped and being held for ransom.
469;Rush Hour has everything that you'd expect from a Jackie Chan film.
470;unbelievable stunt work, action, you name it!
471;And it has everything that you'd expect from a Chris Tucker film.
472;laughs, laughs, and more laughs!
473;This is the greatest buddy.
474;chris tucker is funny, but he seems to always be playing the same character.
475;regardless, it's a great movie and well worth owning.
476;Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker are hilarious.
477;I laugh my a$$ off every time I watch this.
478;I thought that the movie was good.
479;But soon the 2 manage to work their way in to save the little girl.
480;Chris Tucker had lots of Great one liners!
481;The way Chan and Tucker play off each other is wonderful.
482;there is a big docufilm about the movie along with a special game that you can play to help save the little girl.
483;It is a lot of fun.
484;can always watch this movie more than once.
485;Its fun and has lots of action with its fair share of comedy.
486;Great on Jackie Chan TReal Stunts Chris tucker Is a rare character since 2000.
487;This is a funny Movie.

491;This movie is one of the great of the nintees.
492;My two little boys love it and keep asking for more Jackie Chan moives to watch.
493;A majority of us have probably seen Rush Hour at least once, but the movie is still as enjoyable as ever.
494;My kids (13,12,10) all love Jackie Chan and the comedic antics of Chris Tucker, so watching the two banter back and forth throughout the movie make for an enjoyable movie.
495;Tucker and Chan are perfect """"action heros"""" together."""
496;Chan is a great straight man for Tucker's jokes.
497;The pair work well together.
498;Movie is full of surprise actions, well directed and very good photography.
499;Would recommend to anyone who loves action movies.

502;This is the best Action/Comedy I have seen in a while.
503;ChrisTucker played an excellent role as Detective Carter N.Y. p. d.
504;Very entertaining with some laughs.
505;We enjoy action movies and this one had that.
506;This may not not necessarily be the most creative action film that has ever been released, however Tucker and Chan have good chemistry and I think they work well together.
507;you will be on the edge of your seat watching this movie.
508;reward your self and get it now.
509;I love all 3 movies they are great.
510;They have a little of everything action, funny and it also makes you cry.
511;ray is really cool so glad I finally have it for us!They need to release rush hour 2 on blur.
512;These 2 make one of the funniest on screen duos i have seen.
513;Even the outtakes are fantastic.
514;One of the best buddy films made.
515;I do know of Jackie Chan, but he was far from his best in this movie.
516;Overall, the movie is a decent comedy.
517;this is a good movie!
518;This is a fairly well done action/comedy movie.
519;The little Chinese girl is so cute and spunky.
520;Jackie Chan is Jackie Chan and Chris Rock is decent.
521;The screen relationship of Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker is legendary.
522;hand action I love so much?
523;But I wanted Jackie to beat down, and I got very little of that.
524;was an interesting choice for a costar, but I get the feeling that Jackie was being led on in this one.
525;Jackie should always have the upper hand and creative control in all of his films.
526;This movie with two great and funny actors is just one of the most important thing a action.
527;The story and the carry out is a real succes.
528;Just great, this is a masterpiece in comedy.
529;I have never laughed so much.
530;This movie is just as good now as it was when it came out.

532;Rush Hour starring Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan is the new breed of all action packed and humorous police films.
533;This film will keep you laughing from start to finish.
534;other than the great Bruce Lee.
535;The two, however, ultimately bond and join forces to crack the kidnapping case without the help of the FBI.
536;Rush Hour is full of explosive action and comic wit.
537;Rush Hour is a must have for all movie lovers.
538;Watching this movie is very fanny and interesting.
539;I can say it is one of the best movie I can watch 1000000s of time.
540;It is very entertaining and action packed.
541;Our family really enjoys all these videos.

562;Combining Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan together in this movie was pure genius.
563;They are both funny as heck.
564;billing, this film is actually a vehicle for the sassy, brassy, foul.
565;But the film compensates with the brilliant chemistry between the leads and the very, very funny moments they share together.
566;Tucker and Chan are perfect together.
567;One of the most entertaining movies I have ever seen.
568;It is and oldie but it is a really good one.
569;Nice to see the banner part again at the end!
570;director's commentary, good documenary, 2 music videos, trailer, early short film from the director, biographies etc. and i'm just talking about the region 2 disc (i think the 1 version has an isolated score track extra).
571;I mean, sure, Chris Tucker gets to be a pain in the butt sometimes, but hey, it's funny!
572;RUSH HOUR is a lot of fun.
573;It really is a lot of fun.

592;Rush Hour is one of those movies I could watch over and over again and enjoy it each and every single time.
593;The chemistry between Chan and Tucker is superb (Lethal Weapon.
594;An easy 5 stars for me.
595;Classic comedy, another in the lineage of 48 hours and Beverly Hills cop, feel good comedy.
