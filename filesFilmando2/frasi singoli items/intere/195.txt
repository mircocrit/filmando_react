I:10719;1;The amazing aspect of this story is that the dialogue centers upon two characters Vincent and Max inside a taxi cab.
I:10719;2;Collateral as a story works because of the ensuing dialogue, which takes place after this point.
I:10719;3;Vincent's answers are so well.
I:10719;4;michael Mann does an excellent job with this character.
I:10719;5;His commentary provides further insight into the character's background, but also focuses on Tom Cruise's training and development of Vincent's character.
I:10719;6;Very cool, dedicated and sharp, my wish is that Fanning's character would have played more of a dominant role in the story.
I:10719;7;Altogether the movie is filled with interesting characters, insights, and entertainment.
I:10719;8;This is another excellent film from the great director Michael Mann, Also another stunning portrait of L. a. as scene in Heat ( 1995 ).
I:10719;9;If you liked the film Heat then the chances of you liking this film are very high.
I:10719;10;Although the story sometimes seems a little predictable and unprobable it's a great one.
I:10719;11;On their trail is Detective Fanning, a great supporting character played by Mark Ruffalo.
I:10719;12;In a role that shows his acting talents better than before, Foxx is wonderful as the down to earth and funny Max.
I:10719;13;For some reason I am always skeptical about movies with Tom Cruise, but each film I watch expecting him to be bad he turns out to give a great performance.
I:10719;14;The chemistry between Cruise and Foxx was superb and throw in a great story, with a good Director and you have Collateral.
I:10719;15;The character is strong, invokes fear in others but is still very much human and not Rambo.
I:10719;16;For those looking to watch a good film for about 2 hours, this is definately worth a look.
I:10719;17;packed movies of the summer.
I:10719;18;It had mystery and suspense, and I had my eyes fixed to the screen throughout the entire 2 hours.
I:10719;19;A music video without the music!
I:10719;20;Tom Cruise looks better with mustache, beard, gray hair.
I:10719;21;Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise give a spectacular performance that will literally keep you on the edge of your seat!
I:10719;22;One of the most satisfying movie experiences of the year, Collateral is a thrilling movie that doesn't exhibit any thriller cliches.
I:10719;23;This is a movie that prefers building an atmosphere of dread over using shock tactics, dialogue over violence, and atmosphere over frantic chases, and it still manages to be an incredibly engaging film.
I:10719;24;Of all the movies I saw this year, I will admit this to be among my favorites, and I am a bit of a film snob.
I:10719;25;Credit where credit is due, Mark Ruffalo and Jada Pinkett.
I:10719;26;smith both make very strong impressions in minor roles.
I:10719;27;Mann's use of striking imagery and perpetual darkness turn Los Angeles into a dark, almost mystical locale, and the mood is perfectly set for what follows.
I:10719;28;Both the leads turn in what could be called the best performances of their careers: the suave, frigid Vincent is the role Cruise was born to play.
I:10719;29;He really gets into it here, and like his best performances, he gets to be cruel and edgy.
I:10719;30;Foxx is very moving in the film, endowing Max with great humanity.
I:10719;31;Overall, this is a hardly conventional and very enjoyable movie that I would wholeheartedly recommend to anyone looking for an intriguing character study and an invigorating film.
I:10719;32;it did an excellent job of building the characters in the beginning, and showing a realistic development of them during the story.
I:10719;33;this is a movie I'll want to see again for the mood and to appreciate the characters.
I:10719;34;Vincent(Cruise) is a true existentialist.
I:10719;35;The genius of this film is in its unexspected bleakness.
I:10719;36;This is truly a quintessential classic.
I:10719;37;Collateral starring Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx is a film that actually works even though the premise is outrageous.
I:10719;38;This is probably Cruise's best performance ever!
I:10719;39;Foxx was nominated for best supporting actor, he is pretty good in this even though he is not my cup of tea.
I:10719;40;This film isn't perfect but it's pretty close thanks to director Michael Mann.
I:10719;41;Every moment, every look, every line, every shot are all perfectly thought out and move to build the relationship between these two characters and push them on their terrifying journey.
I:10719;42;These characters are real people, and their journey is awe.
I:10719;43;Pretty good movie, just another addition to my collection.
I:10719;44;Absolutely the best choreographed shootings I have ever seen.
I:10719;45;So the Professional killer walks up to the door and gets shot thru it?
I:10719;46;Collateral is my favorite film of the summer and my second favorite of the year, only to Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind.
I:10719;47;Michael Mann, who already gave us the crime classic Heat, delivers another crime classic in the form of Collateral, a film about a taxi driver who is forced to drive a hitman around town as he goes from hit to hit.
I:10719;48;For the people who were nervous about Tom Cruise being able to pull the role of the villian off, relax: This is the best performance of Cruise's illustrious career.
I:10719;49;I loved him in Jerry Maguire, thought he ws amazing in Born on The Fourth of July, saw his greatness in Magnolia, and still think Rain Man holds the most underated performance of his career, as well as his second best after this.
I:10719;50;From the moment we see Cruise walking through LAX Airport, he takes hold of the film and the audience with his gripping intensity, his sarcastic quips, scariness and mean streak.
I:10719;51;This is one of the best movie villians of all time, right there with Denzel in Training Day and Hopkins as Hannibal.
I:10719;52;In fact, his character is as charming in some scenes as a Jerry Maguire.
I:10719;53;The movie is worth a look for his performance alone.
I:10719;54;It is Foxx's best performance as well, as he also takes hold of the audience as the protagonist, a cab driver too scared to chase his dreams, but still someone who cares and takes pride in his work, even if nobody notices him or respects him.
I:10719;55;the resr of the cast did their job beautifully as well, especially standouts Mark Ruffalo, Jada Pinkett.
I:10719;56;The editing was great, and the script by Stuart Beattie was top notch.
I:10719;57;Michael Mann does what might be his best work as a director, outside of The Insider, as he shot the film with a digital camera, that helps make the city of LA an integral character in the film.
I:10719;58;I love this movie and will be hardpressed to find too many more movies that will be better than this one.
I:10719;59;the film looks great, with lots of dazzling overhead shots of a bright lights and glitter LA, and it sounds good too, with a score by James Newton Howard, and some pleasant non.
I:10719;60;"There are many moments of humor with some witty lines between the two leads, who have a marvelous ""anti."
I:10719;61;"the cast is excellent
I:10719;62;Both are in peak athletic shape, and do their share of some fast running.
I:10719;63;"put reasoning on hold, and you'll enjoy this splashy thriller, and what is ultimately a bizarre ""buddy film."
I:10719;64;jamie Foxx was the real treat in this movie however.
I:10719;65;i actually have always enjoyed Micheal Mann's movies.
I:10719;66;Part music video and part intense action drama noone blends the two concepts together like Mann does.
I:10719;67;there are parts that are intense and some things that are comic along with quite a few memorable lines like my favorite:Max: Hey!
I:10719;68;casting was terrific, Cruise was great but Foxx was better.
I:10719;69;good watch for a Saturday night.
I:10719;70;I didn't like Phone Booth but liked this.
I:10719;71;Collateral is an excellent .
I:10719;72;thriller from Michael Mann, the director of Heat.
I:10719;73;Most of his acting is done through his eyes and the confidence of his movements, delivering a completely believable but subtle performance that some might miss.
I:10719;74;While someone like, say, Javier Bardem (also in this movie) could have been cast as Vincent, Cruise adds a sense of 'glib nihilism' (as Mann puts it) and affability that makes his character both charismatic and interesting, much more so than a merely one dimensional, evil assassin.
I:10719;75;Collateral works on the level of a thriller, but is also a character study in how people can meet seemingly inconsequentially, and can change each others destinies.
I:10719;76;Excellent writing and acting makes watching Vincent and Max compelling and fascinating as both a study of who the characters are, and the subtle changes to what they become.
I:10719;77;max is instantly endearing and genuine, but perhaps the greatest triumph of Mann is the ability to get a performance from Cruise that is at once ruthlessly determined, but also touches on some of Vincent's latent humanity.
I:10719;78;Max's unease and sometimes shock over Vincent's nature segues into genuine talks between both characters that reach deep into the core of their inner beings.
I:10719;79;Throughout the the film, Mann makes both characters worth caring about.
I:10719;80;the intensity of Vincent's work .
I:10719;81;continues to escalate in an exhilarating fashion, culminating in a brilliant club shootout that is one of the best of it's kind.
I:10719;82;This scene alone is worth the price of admission.
I:10719;83;much of Collateral's excellence is dependant on camera work, as some of the most poignant scenes are wordless and expressionistic.
I:10719;84;completing the package is a solid and diverse soundtrack.
I:10719;85;The closing track of the movie, 'Requiem' by Antonio Pinto, gives this haunting movie an almost Vangelis Blade Runner era feel, further pressing the film into the viewers mind.
I:10719;86;smart, intense, sometimes mesmerizing and beautifully acted and filmed, Collateral is something that will stay on ones mind long after the credits roll.
I:10719;87;The best movie Tom cruise ever made.
I:10719;88;jamie Fox does a stellar performance in this show.
I:10719;89;also watch the special edition.
I:10719;90;This is a movie that will definitly keep you at the edge of your seat for the entire length.
I:10719;91;They are so well played.
I:10719;92;It's amazing how this story springs up.
I:10719;93;The fight scenes are so awesome, especially the one in the blue.
I:10719;94;I highly recommend it to everyone looking for some fun!
I:10719;95;Max's first fare of the evening, a beautiful Annie (Smith), renders his guard down allowing the next passenger, Vincent, to enter his clean.
I:10719;96;Foxx puts on an excellent performance opposite to Cruise, and is a natural in this serious role.
I:10719;97;I was looking forward to seeing this movie after the hype, and found Cruise and Foxx to be both believable and talented in their respective roles.
I:10719;98;After a moderately slow start, the story builds nicely, with some intelligent plot work, good action sequences, and promises much in suspense, action, and the ability to hold your attention.
I:10719;99;Good movie, but NOT great.
I:10719;100;Great acting, superb camera work, terrific directing, great storyline .
I:10719;101;This is one of the few thrillers to enjoy again and again.
I:10719;102;There's always something new to discover, even when you know the story by heart.
I:10719;103;"time"" (if 12 years can be considered part."
I:10719;104;If Max is a good driver, he'll give him an extra $100 in tips.
I:10719;105;the actors were both very good at portraying their characters, but it was the movie's score and camerawork that made it truly effective.
I:10719;106;The music playing in the background was very good at either complimenting a certain scene, or providing a good contrary to the situation.
I:10719;107;"Also, the movie was shot in a ""home movie"" style, meaning that it was very unsteady and moved with the action."
I:10719;108;sadly, the only major twist is easily guessed five minutes into the film, but the movie is still enjoyable.
I:10719;109;While not the greatest movie I've ever seen, this is definitely the best I've seen in a while.
I:10719;110;'Collateral' is classic Michael Mann .
I:10719;111;He's about as far from that here as you can get.
I:10719;112;minute scene with Javier Bardem is just about the finest piece of acting you'll ever see.
I:10719;113;In the club scene Micahel Mann shows his dynamic camera work as Vincent (Tom Cruise) kills so many people with precision skill.
I:10719;114;The movie is paced really well and we see Jamie Foxx showing his acting skills as a convincing meek yet virtuous cab driver.
I:10719;115;The movie is also very deep and dark and we see who Vincent is and why he turned out the way he did.
I:10719;116;I saw Collateral in the theater with one of my friends the other night and it's great.
I:10719;117;i think the acting in this movie was good for all the actors involved.
I:10719;118;worthy are getting a little ahead of themselves.
I:10719;119;He DID do a good job, but I don't know about an Oscar nod.
I:10719;120;Michael Mann is at the top of his game.
I:10719;121;This riveting thriller combines nicely etched characters, sharp and pointed dialogue, explosive action and violence, delivered with the intelligence, wit and intensity Mann brilliantly brings to the genre.
I:10719;122;Like Tarantino, Michael Mann knows when the extreme closeup of his actors faces is all that is required to reveal character and mood and that cross.
I:10719;123;the film just plain looks great.
I:10719;124;Michael Mann captures the nighttime streets of LA in as mesmerizing a way as his daytime shootout on those same streets in Heat was simply un.
I:10719;125;Beyond the look, the choices of locales, and the mood and pace of the film are spot.
I:10719;126;tom Cruise is terrific in this role and is matched all the way by Jamie Foxx.
I:10719;127;It is basically a two character drama, so the two leads had to carry their weight and they did so admirably.
I:10719;128;It is a very nice piece of work.
I:10719;129;"man"" role, and he acquits himself well."
I:10719;130;The supporting cast, down to the smallest role, is perfect, with Jada Pinkett Smith and Mark Ruffalo carrying the largest support, but also fine cameos by Javier Bardham and others.
I:10719;131;this is class work by a fine director, cast and crew.
I:10719;132;The 5 stars are, of course, for fans of thrillers.
I:10719;133;Foxx did a great job and was very believable in his role.
I:10719;134;"hitter
I:10719;135;The movie is directed perfectly, with silences and cinematography that capture the emptiness of the night.
I:10719;136;Michael Mann manages to make the streets and skyscrapers of L. a. beautiful, both his direction and the grainy cinematography is worthy of an Oscar.
I:10719;137;another magnificent aspect is the ending.
I:10719;138;Movie is good as expected.
I:10719;139;It arrived very quick and was in very good condition.
I:10719;140;"Very few movies made in the last 10 years possess a certain ""charm"" to them that make me want to watch them again and again."
I:10719;141;Cruise plays a slick, fearless hitman who oozes of confidence and charm, while Foxx is just a decent, regular guy.
I:10719;142;Both actors give fantastic performances and make this flick really fun to watch.
I:10719;143;Cruise's character, while ruthless and amoral, is intelligent, charming and quick.
I:10719;144;And he's a jazz music buff to boot!
I:10719;145;Talk about a great script.
I:10719;146;Somehow, though, it's hard NOT to like Vincent, he's just so cool in his own way.
I:10719;147;"liners from Vincent when his own ""tough"" gets going is also quite amusing!As others have indicated, not the most realistic movie, but for sheer entertainment value, it's top."
I:10719;148;COLLATERAL, for my money, is one of the best films of the decade.
I:10719;149;out to his groundbreaking 80s TV series MIAMI VICE), COLLATERAL is an absorbing, atmospheric, provocative tale of two men who meet at the literal crossroads of their lives.
I:10719;150;"a mystery man named Vincent (played with 100% utter conviction and ease by the legendary Tom Cruise) arrives at LAX and ""accidentally"" bumps into another man, in which a briefcase exchange ensues."
I:10719;151;Every time I watch the film, I pick up on a detail or nuance about Vincent and Max I hadn't seen or noticed before and am amazed at how believable their interaction is and how meticulous a film that Michael Mann has constructed.
I:10719;152;This film ought to easily be considered one of the best of the decade.
I:10719;153;within this fascinating film, Mann mixes in a great soundtrack, superbly staged and convincing action sequences, and beautiful cinematography of LA after dark.
I:10719;154;, Javier Bardem (in a pitch perfect scene as the big bad guy Felix), and last but not least an incredibly vibrant and sexy Jada Pinkett Smith (as an early fare of Max's who ends up being a key to the story).
I:10719;155;It is as much a physical performance as it is a verbal one.
I:10719;156;And he handles both sides with aplomb.
I:10719;157;"I would have settled for him getting a ""nomination"", but, I swear, everytime I watch this flawless film, I continue to believe that this is THE performance that Mr. Cruise should always be remembered for, leaving all his other great work in the dust!"
I:10719;158;This may be the best performance of his career, and it is thankfully part of a truly great film.
I:10719;159;A masterpiece as far as I'm concerned!
I:10719;160;the movie begins quite strong and quite well.
I:10719;161;Collateral is one of the best thrillers I've seen in quite some time.
I:10719;162;Along the way, we learn much of both of these characters, whom director Michael Mann obviously cares a great deal for.
I:10719;163;Truly superb acting, storyline, directing, settings, music, tone, and mood make for a great movie that deserves awards and recognition as one of the best thrillers of the last decade.
I:10719;164;"This film is one of Michael Mann's all time best (only ""Heat"" beats it in my opinion)."
I:10719;165;Great action, well paced, and well acted.
I:10719;166;and has holes in the logic of its story, COLLATERAL is a solid, fun movie that just keeps moving, getting more and more twisted and interesting.
I:10719;167;The digital camerawork, which can weaken the impact of some films for me, is one of COLLATERAL's strengths, adding to its mood and keeping things uneasy and weird.
I:10719;168;I did like Tom Cruise's white hair and spiffy gray suit.
I:10719;169;This movie just oozes with cool.
I:10719;170;"Cruise does some of his finest work to date as a professional hitman who comes to the stark realization that he is somehow ""flawed""."
I:10719;171;He just simply nails the character, and brings to it a level of complexity quite often lacking in today's run.
I:10719;172;I didn't know if he could pull it off, but I found myself quite pleased with his performance.
I:10719;173;These 2 lead characters play off each other quite well, and before the end, I kind.
I:10719;174;I very much liked that the whole movie spans just a few hours.
I:10719;175;The guy has a natural instinct for pairing film with music.
I:10719;176;"I was such a big fan of ""Miami Vice"" back in the day, and was always impressed with just how much the right music can bring to a scene."
I:10719;177;"He is the absolute best at this in the business, and ""Collateral"" just showcases this at every turn."
I:10719;178;"Before this movie, ""Heat"" was my favorite Michael Mann movie."
I:10719;179;This movie has a cool vibe to it and is so much fun when you watch it because it's so simple and not confusing.
I:10719;180;Great proformances by the actors,The rest of the movie you have to see for yourself,get this movie NOW.
I:10719;181;Very good movie,, kept me at the T. v. I do like a bit of action, which this had plenty.
I:10719;182;I have a new high.
I:10719;183;The action and plot are top shelf.
I:10719;184;aside from mann's patented abrasive camera work everything seemed to be headed in a positive direction.
I:10719;185;as a matter of fact my enjoyment was thorough and unquestionable up until the point when an audioslave song came on, then i remembered precisely why i disliked michael mann movies.
I:10719;186;certainly, the way his movies move imply calculation, but upon further investigation one can see that tapestry of lies unravel and end up in frayed tatters on the floor.
I:10719;187;i'm sure this is absolutely necessary.
I:10719;188;berating spazz, he's still a great actor.
I:10719;189;"Blend all these together into a script over the course of a tipsy evening and you can do better than ""Collateral"" did."
I:10719;190;"But ""Collateral"" really takes the cake, with 4."
I:10719;191;Because that's what makes a good crime movie .
I:10719;192;michael Mann's contempt for Los Angeles drips from every frame, from the dialogue to the choice of shots and locations.
I:10719;193;Jamie Foxx/Tom Cruise work well together in this flick.
I:10719;194;ray, i didnt need to with this one.
I:10719;195;Nominated for two Academy Awards, Collateral is an electrifying, high.
I:10719;196;Tom Cruise turns in an outstanding performance as the noted hit man, and Jada Pinkett Smith enjoys one of her most notable performances as a high profile lawyer.
I:10719;197;packed movies of 2004, Collateral is an unforgettable glimpse into the world of professional assassins.
I:10719;198;los Angeles taxicab driver Max (Jamie Foxx) is an easy to get along with guy, a guy with big dreams of owning his own company and vacationing on a beautiful Caribbean island.
I:10719;199;When he picks up an unusually beautiful fare, an attorney named Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith), the two hit it off real well.
I:10719;200;But Max is actually a highly trained professional hit man, and he wants to utilize Max's services for the entirety of the night .
I:10719;201;As the cops chase after them, the fate of both Vincent and Max become intertwined.
I:10719;202;wrought with suspense and a number of high.
I:10719;203;energy action sequences, Collateral is an enjoyable film.
I:10719;204;And the onscreen relationship between the two characters makes for a great movie.
I:10719;205;With some the best performances of Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise's respective careers, Collateral is a definite must.
I:10719;206;I for one think he is underrated.
I:10719;207;As the story unfolds and Foxx and us realize what he is capable of doing, we are in shock and awe.
I:10719;208;Foxx is excellent in this role.
I:10719;209;Typically he has been type cast in comedies, but he shows he is quite capable of dramatic roles as well.
I:10719;210;He does a great job of playing an average man that is caught up in something he can't escape without taking drastic measures.
I:10719;211;i am a fan of Michael Mann and I am glad to see him direct another great movie.
I:10719;212;The style that Mann uses to show the dark side of the city and human nature is excellent.
I:10719;213;Collateral is one of the best movies of 2004.
I:10719;214;What ensues is one of the most dark, yet entertaining movies I've seen.
I:10719;215;The movie grows in suspense with every ticking moment until the last 25 minutes when everything explodes.
I:10719;216;Great performance by Jamie Foxx, who later on that year showed even more genius by his performance of The Genius Ray Charles.
I:10719;217;He gave, in my opinion, one of his best performances.
I:10719;218;I'm not a big Cruise fan myself, but I know a great performance when I see it.
I:10719;219;the movie has three very good things going for it .
I:10719;220;In my opinion, his best in recent memory.
I:10719;221;Foxx, as ordinary cabbie Max who carts around Cruise's hitman Vincent, is also excellent.
I:10719;222;What really elevates this film above the level of your typical action.
I:10719;223;thriller, however, is the direction of Michael Mann.
I:10719;224;The film is kept remarkably taut as soon as Vincent gets into Max's cab, but Mann does this without sacrificing top.
I:10719;225;What keeps this film from being truly excellent is Stuart Beattie's run of the mill screenplay.
I:10719;226;The film is filled with traditional suspense movie sequences (ie.
I:10719;227;Great acting and direction, but only an average script.
I:10719;228;It was one the best movies I have seen so far this year.
I:10719;229;will want to see this one again .
I:10719;230;Cruise and Foxx are at their best .
I:10719;231;the insight into the depth of the characters is extremely well done .
I:10719;232;If you like crime dramas that take place in LA, this is a must see.
I:10719;233;Like Mann's other classic LA crime drama, Heat, Collateral delivers a compelling story with superb acting.
I:10719;234;This is one of the best performances of Cruise's career.
I:10719;235;The movie trailer, out of context, wasn't that good, but when you see it in the movie, it was really good.
I:10719;236;Foxx did a great job (and that whole scene from the trailer was great), and this was the best I've seen Tom Cruise.
I:10719;237;Still, his performance in this film was very good.
I:10719;238;Collatoral has a great cast, a great plot, and is a joy to watch.
I:10719;239;It's what a thriller should be, and Cruise is better than his usual self.
I:10719;240;There are some great things about COLLATERAL.
I:10719;241;The work he has done to look like a trained killer is fantastic.
I:10719;242;the production value is fantastic.
I:10719;243;Throughout the movie, the camera lets the action do the talking.
I:10719;244;he manages to come up with his own words??
I:10719;245;Seemingly frozen in his seat.
I:10719;246;finally, I know that Jamie Foxx is a very good actor.
I:10719;247;For years Tom Cruise has done some films that pull the envelope for his talent.
I:10719;248;DEspite being nominated for 3 Academy Awards, this man still stands as one of Hollywood's most successful actors.
I:10719;249;This was a very good movie.
I:10719;250;It is stylish, which is a trademark of Michael Mann's, and has good performances by Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise.
I:10719;251;Foxx proves he can really act and Cruise makes a believable sociopath.
I:10719;252;There is a lot of psychological warfare going on from Cruise's character and eventually Foxx begins to fight back.
I:10719;253;This is a good thriller with an intelligent script and good actors creating good characters.
I:10719;254;My only problem would be a little bit of a contrived ending but then again maybe I'm thinking too much and I should just shut up and enjoy the movie.
I:10719;255;from the start I was hooked.
I:10719;256;I have loved him since his In Living Color days, and lemme tell ya .
I:10719;257;The action is great, the dialogue is even better.
I:10719;258;i still must admit that I thoroughly enjoyed it.
I:10719;259;It kept me on the edge of my seat waiting to see what happened next.
I:10719;260;I'd watch it again, and would like to own it.
I:10719;261;first the movie: Collateral is a great film with plenty of action and suspense.
I:10719;262;What makes this movie is the fact that it takes place completely at night .
I:10719;263;there's just something about it and it's right here.
I:10719;264;The viewer gets wrapped up in the story easily, and both Cruise and Foxx deliver great performances (and I'm not a fan of either one of them).
I:10719;265;bonus disc has some very nice features also.
I:10719;266;but everyone is good in Collateral.
I:10719;267;The plot has just enough originality, some realistic dialog and even a clever and almost plausible twist at the end.
I:10719;268;"Michael Mann's slick, ultra violent thriller ""Collateral"" serves as a worthy coming out party for the non comedic talents of Jamie Foxx."
I:10719;269;mann's direction keeps the flick moving at a crisp pace.
I:10719;270;The interplay between Cruise and Foxx is superb and heightens the character developement to make them both believable and sympathetic.
I:10719;271;The musical score is quite good as well.
I:10719;272;Thanks again and i recommend this person anytime.
I:10719;273;Director Michael Mann (ManhunterandHeat) is well known for being a precise and methodical filmmaker.
I:10719;274;This unique interaction between Mann and his cast is exemplified in the suspense film, Collateral, which features an impressive cast of actors, all of whom give naturalistic and psychologically complex performances.
I:10719;275;The story, about a cab driver who is forced to drive a hitman around the city of Los Angeles while he assassinates his targets, is quite literally driven by its vividly realized characters.
I:10719;276;dimensional and feel almost familiar, are brought to life by an all.
I:10719;277;Each member of the cast gives a great performance, especially Jada Pinkett Smith and Mark Ruffalo, who aren't what would be considered the main characters and yet they create memorable personas.
I:10719;278;stealers are the performances of Foxx and Cruise, whose characters are dynamic despite being polar opposites.
I:10719;279;As Max becomes more assertive and confident, Vincent is reintroduced to his more human side.
I:10719;280;though highly stylized and at times a little predictable, Collateral is one of the best suspense films of the past decade.
I:10719;281;The reason being that it's rare to have such naturalistic actors playing such believable characters while they are trapped in the most extraordinary of circumstances.
I:10719;282;This is where Mann excels as a filmmaker, telling stories that are somewhat far.
I:10719;283;"As we watch Max and Vincent confide in each other, and as we see them both become torn by internal conflict, we can't help but empathize with their plights and wonder, ""What would I do in that situation?"
I:10719;284;now Michael Mann has done it again with Collateral.
I:10719;285;After all, what better way to engender sympathy for a character than to have him be potentially lucky in love (especially with the surprisingly lovely Jada Pinkett.
I:10719;286;A lot of people saw this as a stretch (similar to Tom Hanks playing a killer in Road to Perdition), but it's really just Cruise doing what he does best: looking and acting really cool.
I:10719;287;making it a more engaging experience than anyone had a right to expect from a Tom Cruise movie.
I:10719;288;tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx are the stars of the film, Foxx winning an Academy Award.
I:10719;289;He was just outstanding in here as the immoral hit.
I:10719;290;ish cab driver who is pulled into Cruise's murdering adventures.You'll appreciate both of these guys, and the great visuals, more on the second viewing after you are familiar with the story.
I:10719;291;The intense film is definitely worth more than one look.
I:10719;292;This was a very entertaining thriller.
I:10719;293;Tom Cruise is a very fine villain and Jamie Foxx does an even better job as the fish out of water hero.
I:10719;294;Jada Pinkett Smith plays the super competent (but anxiety filled) and beautiful prosecuting attorney with a good balance of strength and vulnerability.
I:10719;295;Foxx's embodiment of Max is actually quite good.
I:10719;296;the extras on the second disk are pretty good and provide good background on the movie including how it was made.
I:10719;297;I am not a fan of Tom Cruise but he does pretty well in this movie.
I:10719;298;Its gripping and keeps your attention the entire time.
I:10719;299;Would this scare off a mainstream audience?The first disc features an informative audio commentary track by director Michael Mann.
I:10719;300;The veteran filmmaker really did his homework as he talks about the realistic details used in the background of scenes and with various characters.
I:10719;301;He also talks at length about the characters' backstories and motivations.
I:10719;302;minute look at how this film came together and was made.
I:10719;303;This is a step up above the usual electronic press kit material.
I:10719;304;Included is actual footage of Cruise in action.
I:10719;305;Shooting on Location: Annie's Office examines the use of high.
I:10719;306;Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx Rehearse gives a glimpse into the creative process as we see footage of the two actors reading through a scene in Mann's office, juxtaposed with the final scene in the movie.
I:10719;307;collateral is a fitting addition to Michael Mann's distinctive filmography.
I:10719;308;It is also deals with another Mann obsession: transformation.
I:10719;309;It is the exploration of such weighty themes, coupled with Mann's distinctive style that elevates Collateral from its generic conventions.
I:10719;310;what sets this movie apart from other conventional thrillers is the smart script and gritty, fly on the wall direction from Michael Mann.
I:10719;311;This is easily Mann's best film in recent years.
I:10719;312;Initially, I resented having the special features separated on another disc but from the first frame of the feature presentation, you can see where the space of the disc go to.
I:10719;313;The picture is excellent with the contrast and hues being distinct.
I:10719;314;Although the whole movie is being set at night, each character's face is remarkably sharp.
I:10719;315;Also we have the making of featurettes and as well as an emphasis on the FX aspect of the movie.
I:10719;316;This movie was on cable a while ago, and I caught part of it.
I:10719;317;It was so good that I immediately ordered it on Amazon.
I:10719;318;blooded killer who is arrogant and charming, yet occasionally very human.
I:10719;319;Jamie Foxx is excellent as his unwilling partner, a cabbie with unfulfilled dreams of success.
I:10719;320;The L. a. scenery is used very well as the backdrop for the criminal activity.
I:10719;321;There is a wonderfully choreographed nightclub scene that is a sort of ballet of violence.
I:10719;322;The end comes almost too soon, always a sign that it's a good movie.
I:10719;323;One of the best crime dramas of this millenium, so far !
I:10719;324;I watched this movie last night and I have to say that it rose far above my expectations.
I:10719;325;"It's almost like he woke up last year and said ""dang, I really need to do something great"" and so he did, with this movie."
I:10719;326;He picks up a woman (Jada), a lawyer working on a big case and he gives her his philosiphy, that you need to take mini breaks, mini vacations throughout the day and he does this by looking at a postcard of an island.
I:10719;327;This is important, because the heart of this movie is so much more than a hitman and a cabbie.
I:10719;328;In return she gives him her number.
I:10719;329;so now he keeps that in the spot saved for his photo.
I:10719;330;There are plot twists and turns, especially come the last thirty minutes or so, and the last ten minutes will have your heart beating through your chest.
I:10719;331;Heres what I love so much about this movie, because without the underlining moral of this story it would just be a movie, but it's so much more than that.
I:10719;332;He lives for the moment.
I:10719;333;that he's saving up for his dream, getting things in order.
I:10719;334;The fact of the mater is Vincent was the best thing that ever happened to Max!
I:10719;335;The acting was top notch, with Tom as villian and Jamie Foxx at his best ever!
I:10719;336;The quick pace and building tension kept me on the edge of my seat.
I:10719;337;Michael Mann is one of the top action/thriller directors working today, and COLLATERAL only serves to confirm his stature.
I:10719;338;Full of Mann's prototypical and wry observations, and beautifully photographed, edited and scored, the movie grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go.
I:10719;339;Probably Tom Cruise's finest performance ever, as he reaches inside to extract a psychotic darkness and animal intelligence that redefines him as an actor.
I:10719;340;But what I found pleasant about this film is the unexpected turns and twist, such as Tom Cruise's character's first HIT falling four stories onto the cab he was using.
I:10719;341;jamie Foxx plays cabbie Max, a man with big dreams and a lot of common sense.
I:10719;342;The actual activities and routes the charaters perform are believable, parts of the dialogue are NOT.
I:10719;343;all and all, this is a good movie.
I:10719;344;I think most people will enjoy the entertainmnet.
I:10719;345;But under the direction of Michael Mann, Tom Cruise finds his pacing and delivers one of the best performances of his career.
I:10719;346;Combine his character with the recent explosion of Jamie Foxx and you have the makings of a great movie.
I:10719;347;Both Cruise and Foxx guide COLLATERAL to its explosive conclusion, all the while managing to shed light on their characters and explore real emotion.
I:10719;348;The opening sequences are great, the dialogue is superb, and the imagery is extraordinary.
I:10719;349;Los Angeles comes alive in COLLATERAL and Mann's picture seems to be a tribute to its scenic locations and nightlife.
I:10719;350;ultimately, I found COLLATERAL interesting because of the depth of its two main characters.
I:10719;351;But Cruise manages to squeeze a lot more life into the character than I had expected, particularly in the scenes where we learn about his childhood experiences.
I:10719;352;But he is also a man capable of great heroism and courage, witnessed several times throughout the film in short bursts.
I:10719;353;And it transforms the audience as it transforms its characters.
I:10719;354;COLLATERAL is one of Michael Mann's best films to date and an absolute must.
I:10719;355;Collateral was a very pleasant surprise in the summer of 2004.
I:10719;356;But until that happens, we're treated to a suspense film that is equally strong in atmosphere and in characterization.
I:10719;357;"but I would rate it as competent dramatic work, certainly a step up from his ""Booty Call"" days but nowhere near as memorable as his press agents suggest."
I:10719;358;Tom Cruise delivers yet another overlooked virtuoso performance, on the other hand, playing a heartless killer.
I:10719;359;Both Foxx's and Cruise's characters have plausible, believable motivations, which adds to the fun.
I:10719;360;"Foxx and Cruise have excellent chemistry together, and it's the interaction between those actors that help make ""Collateral"" a film that will be remembered years from now."
I:10719;361;disc set is excessive, however.
I:10719;362;Extras are great if a film is technically groundbreaking in some way, or if a film is adapted from a difficult novel.
I:10719;363;the hasty, Hollywood happy ending will ruin this film for many.
I:10719;364;To me, the greatest pleasure of the film is watching the way the night.
I:10719;365;time cinematography reveals so much about two characters most of us would innocently pass by on the street.
I:10719;366;Adult pleasures like this are rare in summertime blockbusters, and should be applauded.
I:10719;367;Suspense and noir fans will definitely want to add this to their collections.
I:10719;368;out near the end and give the kiddies a happy ending with a standard.
I:10719;369;teeVee written all over it, is astounding, perplexing, and more than a little sad.
I:10719;370;1) Every professional hitman works hard to blend in to the scenery by frosting his hair silver, wearing Agent Smith.
I:10719;371;arounds, and donning a dress.
I:10719;372;Because, you know, cabs are the.
I:10719;373;Oh yeah, and did I mention?
I:10719;374;But if you can roll with that, you are in for an extremely entertaining ride.
I:10719;375;Foxx (the real star of this film) and Cruise do great work and there are many specific character details that bring the story and people to life in a manner that is uncommon in the action genre.
I:10719;376;Director Michael Mann and screenwriter Stuart Beattie acquit themselves well.
I:10719;377;this is pretty pedestrian stuff.
I:10719;378;Foxx is pretty good, but again, it's a one.
I:10719;379;dimensional character, mostly just reacting to what's going on around him.
I:10719;380;"Keep saying to yourself ""It's a movie, it's a movie"" and you might not mind how much you're being manipulated (and being asked to swallow)."
I:10719;381;Michael Mann has a unique directorial style that seduces the viewer into casual interest in the characters, then sucks us into the building suspense till we can't escape.
I:10719;382;rate as an unassuming likeable, honest guy, while Cruise's portrayal of Vincent is a more accurate depiction of his real.
I:10719;383;moving script, but seemingly perfectly appropriate for the plot shifts.
I:10719;384;seeming fare is going to give him the ride of his life.
I:10719;385;The less you know about the plot the better, so i'll just mention that the cast is outstanding, the pacing is excellent, and there's surprising humor as well.
I:10719;386;"quick explanation of ""Collateral""'s storyline centering on a kidnapping, hostage situation of sorts, I decided this was the movie I wanted to see, since I thought this type of picture would not disappoint, and deliver a lot of intrigue and physical punch in the process, which these blackmail and espionage style thrillers usually endow upon the viewer."
I:10719;387;Jada Pinkett Smith's appearance is by far the best of the three main actors here, all the moreso making laughingstocks out of both Cruise's and Foxx's subpar performances singlehandedly.
I:10719;388;I hope all those who make films choose to see this movie at some time in the near future.
I:10719;389;If they do, they will see the essence of great filmmaking.
I:10719;390;Is this the best film ever made?
I:10719;391;But it does display the things that great movies have.
I:10719;392;After giving a ride to a beautiful lady, he gets a new fare, a man named Vincent (Tom Cruise) who basically hires him for the night to drive him around town for 600 dollars.
I:10719;393;Director Michael Mann once again chooses a great cast to carry his film.
I:10719;394;Both Cruise and Foxx are splendid.
I:10719;395;They are complex characters, as we learn much about each of them during the course of the film.
I:10719;396;Great films are always great because of the characters and their development.
I:10719;397;I highly recommend this movie.
I:10719;398;Michael Mann is one of two directors that can combine Action and drama with such a stylish feel.
I:10719;399;The soundtrack for this movie is also great the part at Club Fever when you hear the beat of the music you know you are about to see a great action sequence .
I:10719;400;I also really liked the lecture that Vincent gave to Max in the cab after Club Fever.
I:10719;401;special forces operator who has come to town in order to assassinate five people.
I:10719;402;Vincent is at once charming, philosophical and absolutely devoid of conscience.
I:10719;403;Foxx is at times sympathetic, and also noble.
I:10719;404;Cruise plays the villain perfectly.
I:10719;405;I particularly enjoyed the philosophical musings.
I:10719;406;Vincent's worldview might be nihilistic, but he lives consistently with it.
I:10719;407;Jada Pinkett Smith is solid as Max's love interest.
I:10719;408;Mark Ruffalo, always memorable, has a small part.
I:10719;409;It is also punctuated at times with strong language.
I:10719;410;i recommend this movie for mature movie watchers.
I:10719;411;While the violence is visceral at times, director Michael Mann has given us a glimpse into the heart of darkness.
I:10719;412;And the disc has pretty good features.
I:10719;413;Cause it is a great add to your action collectionThere is over 54 minutes of special features on this 2.
I:10719;414;"Michael Mann's slick ""Collateral"" brings two talents into sharp focus."
I:10719;415;The cinematography is exquisite, and for that alone no serious filmgoer should miss this.
I:10719;416;Jamie Foxx is extremely great as the title character and hero in this film.
I:10719;417;The scenes between Cruise and Foxx are rich and refreshing.
I:10719;418;Michael Mann's direction is also spellbinding.
I:10719;419;Mark Ruffalo (he's a real good actor), Jada Pinkett Smith, Peter Berg, and Bruce McGill(D. day from Animal House!)
I:10719;420;are great in their characters as well.
I:10719;421;crafted thriller by director Michael Mann offers not only edge.
I:10719;422;seat suspense but also solid characterization and cinematic mood.
I:10719;423;the surprise of this movie is the acting and chemistry between the two stars, Foxx and Cruise.
I:10719;424;Both give their characters depth .
I:10719;425;and the viewer perversely understands both Vincent's affection for Max and his willingness to kill him.
I:10719;426;the soundtrack is good, and the mood created by Mann of a late.
I:10719;427;night, underbelly LA is exceptional.
I:10719;428;recommended viewing for thriller fans.
I:10719;429;Tom Cruise and Jamie Fox really showed their talent.
I:10719;430;I can express my feelings for this movie in 5 words .
I:10719;431;If a movie begins with excitement, remains through the movie with several plots to keep you guessing as to what the outcome may be, then its proven to be a 'Fantastic' movie.
I:10719;432;I've added it to my collection also.
I:10719;433;THE hyper sexy professional prototype and Max .
I:10719;434;The adrenaline rush, the violence, the cool steely demeanor, hired killer .
I:10719;435;"The peek into the murderer's killings and mind, the steely aesthetics, the beautiful ""smelly"" portrait of a rough L. a., are just supportive of the central human theme."
I:10719;436;Max is a blue collar worker with a dream.
I:10719;437;That dream keeps his child spirit alive, and that of most of us striving in the middle.
I:10719;438;He also dreams of island far away, that he keeps a picture of on the cab of.
I:10719;439;He is incapable of risking emotionally, either.
I:10719;440;He sees her walking away from him, and aches.
I:10719;441;Masterful performance, all the way.
I:10719;442;vincent's cool, roll with the punches.
I:10719;443;high level mercenary behavior seem appropriate with his taste of music.
I:10719;444;One with the appropriate tone: Jazz.
I:10719;445;a beautiful, masterfully written and directed piece at a Jazz club, lets us know a side of a cultured Vincent, who knows about Jazz history and understands the craft.
I:10719;446;You can sense his love for it.
I:10719;447;and deep inside, he knows it.
I:10719;448;He despises what he does.
I:10719;449;Although full of satisfying (for him) rationalizations for his actions, that he blurts to .
I:10719;450;the cab driver, that entertains us fully during the film.
I:10719;451;living, breathing justification for Vincent's exhilarating line of work, there is a connection that Vincent wants to keep.
I:10719;452;That change hints the promise of a new life.
I:10719;453;"the ending, which is the only ""traditional Hollywood"" segment that indulges the audience with a happy closure, has been criticized a lot."
I:10719;454;and it surely reminds us, the flavor of irony we extract from our own life's events.
I:10719;455;And Mann, as a great composer, leaves you with a feeling that this ending had the beautiful consistency of that logic.
I:10719;456;And some fine acting by Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise.
I:10719;457;this stylish, atmospheric thriller is yet another Hollywood ode to the hit man.
I:10719;458;Consider these engaging hit man movies from the 90s:2 Days in the Valley (1996) Danny Aiello as an over the hill hit man turned pizza baker.
I:10719;459;top portrayal of a rival hit man always making with the jokes.
I:10719;460;"genre has something in common with ""the whore with the heart of gold"" flick."
I:10719;461;Surprisingly enough Collateral is also a buddy movie of sorts, or at least Tom Cruise's Vincent thinks he is making a friend, in as much as he is capable of making a friend.
I:10719;462;but what makes this movie stand out, aside from Foxx and Cruise doing such a great job, is how stylish is the development, how worldly wise the dialogue, and how crisp the direction.
I:10719;463;another good film directed by Michael Mann is The Insider (1999) starring Al Pacino and Russell Crowe.
I:10719;464;"I enjoyed the film
I:10719;465;Overall I thought the movie was great.
I:10719;466;I thought the screen play was spot on, the plot twist was not predictable, and the way Mann filmed LA at night was simply beautiful.
I:10719;467;The scene where the car was parked at a light and you see the silhouette of the palm trees against the incandescent LA sky was gorgeous, along with the three coyotes.
I:10719;468;up action movie near the end, i really enjoyed the dialogue a lot.
I:10719;469;I have been waiting for years to see Jamie Foxx take his rightful place in the pantheon of great American performers.
I:10719;470;He is a gifted actor, funny.
I:10719;471;"In "" On Any Given Sunday "" Foxx showed the movie viewing public that he could deliver a first rate, solid dramatic performance."
I:10719;472;I have found that there is a limit to how many shots of his hair, smile and steely gaze that I can stand.
I:10719;473;"he was wonderful in "" Rain Man "" and I thoroughly enjoyed his work in "" Minority Report ""."
I:10719;474;"in "" Collateral "" Cruise intelligently takes a step back and lets Foxx shine."
I:10719;475;His performance as a professional killer is nuanced, and well developed.
I:10719;476;foxx has established, once and for all, that he can hold the screen as a lead in a big time, big budget movie.
I:10719;477;He puts all of his wide range of dramatic and comedic to superb use.
I:10719;478;In numerous scenes he subtly uses his eyes alone to described shifts in his thinking and moods.
I:10719;479;He also has demonstrated that special ability to merge so thoroughly with his role.
I:10719;480;The overall casting is perfect.
I:10719;481;The movie is beautifully filmed.
I:10719;482;jada Pinkett Smith also shines as a Federal prosecutor.
I:10719;483;I swear she grows lovelier with each passing year, and her screen presence and acting ability have followed a pace.
I:10719;484;She came to acting late in life and brings her wisdom and life experience to every role she plays.
I:10719;485;She is an American treasure!This is a first rate action thriller.
I:10719;486;Collateral was a good choice of movie.
I:10719;487;I saw it with my sister and it was excellent!
I:10719;488;Vincent, played superbly by Tom Cruise, is a hit man who is sent to assassinate five people in a 10.
I:10719;489;With a sense of humor and suspense, Collateral may be nominated for an oscar for best screenplay, best actor, and best director.
I:10719;490;Michael Mann does a superb job in directing the movie as to where in L. a. events take place and in that time span.
I:10719;491;"I thought my sobriety was impeding my ability to enjoy this ""film""."
I:10719;492;after all, I heard so many great things about it, and my goodness!!!
I:10719;493;watched some more, and just got angrier.
I:10719;494;This is just my opinion thou and I dont represent the view of the general public.
I:10719;495;He tells everyone that this job is just part time and temporary.
I:10719;496;Its something to do while he makes other arrangements.
I:10719;497;Max also has a gift for getting his customers to their destination on time, and in the amount of time he predicted.
I:10719;498;'Collateral' is a good movie.
I:10719;499;It explores quite a few aspects of human behavior.
I:10719;500;Amongst its themes are the stories we tell ourselves that get us from one day to the next, even though everyone else sees right through them.
I:10719;501;This theme is at the heart of the relationship between Max and Vincent.
I:10719;502;Its subtle in points, but it clubs you over the head in others.
I:10719;503;the best part of the movie is the acting.
I:10719;504;Cruise and Foxx were ideal for their roles.
I:10719;505;For Foxx, this film continues his entry into dramatic roles and away from comedy.
I:10719;506;Both of them do a superb job.
I:10719;507;overall, I'd recommend this film to fans of Cruise and Foxx and those that like dark gritty movies.
I:10719;508;This is an amazing pshycological thriller with great action scenes!
I:10719;509;The way that Mann shot it is superb and I watched it twice in the same week, this week that is!It's all shot in LA, over one night, and despite the trap of making a boring, typical action movie, these guys make the most out of LA by night!Great twist, although nothing remarkable, but the overall film experience is worth it.
I:10719;510;Once again, Tom Cruise shows that he knows how to choose scripts and directors!Well Done!
I:10719;511;cold hitman Vincent in Michael Mann's stunning thriller COLLATERAL, Cruise is at his gruesome best.
I:10719;512;and forces Max to make a life.
I:10719;513;mann is a sensational director, and he brings to the screen a gritty, brutal tale, with a seedy LA becoming a character all its own.
I:10719;514;"Cruise is in serious physical shape to play this role, and it shows
I:10719;515;"The climactic sequences at the prosecutor's office that move to the public transit are also well done, but this is where the movie stumbles just a bit
I:10719;516;"I actually wanted to see this movie mainly for the cinematography
I:10719;517;That's right, not Mother Theresa, but the highly professional killer.
I:10719;518;Advice to Hollywood deep thinkers: Stick to the car chases!
I:10719;519;You can watch it without being annoyed, characters are very good, and pictures are beautiful.
I:10719;520;there is one thing I admire about Hollywood: even when running for her life girl would never ditch her high heels.
I:10719;521;We have plenty of high heel races here.
I:10719;522;This film is a classic Michael Mann signature genre hit.
I:10719;523;That signature will always be there.
I:10719;524;Collateral is a signature Michael Mann crime thriller film all the way.
I:10719;525;tom Cruise absorbs Vincent's character and brings him to life.
I:10719;526;Max's growth in the film is only supported by Jamie's vastly improved acting skills.
I:10719;527;Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx work well together in this film.
I:10719;528;But the length of the film is actually two hours.
I:10719;529;She compliments Foxx's on screen personality.
I:10719;530;michael Mann, I think, did a very good job with this movie.
I:10719;531;The plot is very organized, the story is excellent, the action and speaking is very crispy, and the characters in the movie are very interesting.
I:10719;532;this movie has both equal elements of drama and action, but it is a perfect blend and flows very well.
I:10719;533;She and Max flirt and it creates a very interesting plot twist.
I:10719;534;Ruffalo was so good in his role, that at first I didn't even realize it was him.
I:10719;535;i could see an Oscar nomination for Tom Cruise with this movie.
I:10719;536;His character is so complex, and Cruise portrays him with perfection.
I:10719;537;this movie had me on the edge of my seat at the end and i understand now why Jamie Foxx got nominated for best supporting actor.
I:10719;538;but really, this was a great movie.
I:10719;539;lots of great action and of course, i love me some Jamie Foxx.
I:10719;540;He was very disapointed when before the movie even got started good I revealed plot twists.
I:10719;541;Anyway, it was a good movie and Tom Cruise played a really good bad guy and it was interesting to see Jamie Foxx not being cool or a tough guy, he was fantastic as a humble cab driver.
I:10719;542;There was a lot of action, it was high paced, and exciting at times.
I:10719;543;since everyone seems well aware of the story.
I:10719;544;line I'll dispense with that but for this film to work you truly do need to put a certain amount of reality on hold.
I:10719;545;Right away the premise is beyond believable!
I:10719;546;But if one is able to neglect that glaring nonsense the movie does have its good points.
I:10719;547;the action is pretty much non.
I:10719;548;While Mr. Cruise, in his own way, is a fine actor I never truly believed for a moment in his ability to come across as a hardened murderer.
I:10719;549;I'm assuming this was included to give Vincent's character a rather 'warm and fuzzy' appeal that offers the film its one tender moment.
I:10719;550;The only saving grace was Mr. Manns inate ability to use Los Angelos as a third character, giving the film a nice, urban detached look that worked extremely well.
I:10719;551;It does flow well and it will keep you in your seat ( though hardly on the edge! )
I:10719;552;A cool popcorn flick for he hole family it has thrills chills and spills.
I:10719;553;As I suppose most hitmen would be, he's tempermental and invokes his own brand of ethics in order to justify his actions.
I:10719;554;As viewers, we end up putting ourselves in his place, and the result is quite a psychological thriller.
I:10719;555;i've always enjoyed Michael Mann movies and would not mind his making more films.
I:10719;556;"His works always bring an ""intensity"" to the table not normally found too often in most other films."
I:10719;557;"Now, ""The Insider"", along with ""Heat"", ""The Last of the Mohicans"", and ""Manhunter"" are some of my favorite movies."
I:10719;558;If you want an entertaining movie, this will suffice.
I:10719;559;Meanwhile we learn plenty about Foxx's character and we sympathize with his plight, becoming truly concerned for his well being, and witness to what his character eventually becomes capable of.
I:10719;560;plenty of suspense keeps you on the edge of your seat and Collateral delivers hearty punches in the action department as well, with great shootouts and hand to hand dirty work.
I:10719;561;well written, well acted and well directed.
I:10719;562;Collateral gets my vote for one of the top action movies of 2004.
I:10719;563;Starting watching on a Sunday morning early, found it to be riveting and stimulating.
I:10719;564;"While the movie easily stands on its own terms without any ""Collateral 101"" preparation, bearing a witness to the genius of ""Michael Mann University"" as Jamie Foxx beautifully put it, made for a quantum leap in my appreciation of this film."
I:10719;565;"How all three of these lives rise and converge on the streets of Los Angeles is done with such impeccable artistry and refinement that every scene takes on a level of believability
I:10719;566;His character's journey is so measured and so real that you cannot help but undergo it with him at key points.
I:10719;567;It is one (strangely), and yet paradoxically is also anything but.
I:10719;568;But that just once again reveals the genius of the real star of this picture: director Michael Mann.
I:10719;569;i give it four stars and not five because of the way it ended.
I:10719;570;The final scenes momentarily reminded me that I was watching a well.
I:10719;571;crafted movie and not helplessly experiencing a live event.
I:10719;572;But the movie is sweet nonetheless.
I:10719;573;Collateral certainly kept me entertained, even though the last 15 minutes was just an onslaught of implausibilities.
I:10719;574;like all Michael Mann movies, this is mainly an exercise in style, i. e. snappy, eye.
I:10719;575;decent acting here for a change, and looks far less flaky than usual with a head full of salt.
I:10719;576;The rest of the time it's very competent at what it does.
I:10719;577;For the most part, this is one sharp crime thriller that doubles as a character study of two lonely men.
I:10719;578;blooded as one can expect in this type of film, but Stuart Beattie's script reveals a well.
I:10719;579;pepper hair and without his trademark smile, Tom Cruise is relatively good as Vincent, though as with most of his films, there is an air of posturing about his performance that negates the malice of his character.
I:10719;580;At the same time, when it comes to his character's profession, he is convincing as an expert at his craft, who has mastered a clear method of killing that absolves him of blame and conscience.
I:10719;581;He is also a complex figure, a man who has deluded himself with dreams of running his own limousine service.
I:10719;582;As Max, he captures all the inner conflict showing surprising pockets of courage when he realizes he has nothing to lose.
I:10719;583;The interplay between Vincent and Max is what makes this film uniquely intriguing, as it is just not about a villain holding a reluctant victim hostage but about two men who leverage each other's blind spots and weaknesses to fulfill their immediate goals.
I:10719;584;smith is sharp and memorable in a small but pivotal role as Annie, a federal prosecutor who gets drawn to Max at the beginning.
I:10719;585;The scene between Foxx and Bardem is superbly played out as Max gradually steels himself into Vincent's identity.
I:10719;586;But I still recommend this movie for its overall originality.
I:10719;587;disc set has plenty of extras .
I:10719;588;Mann's informative commentary, a feature.
I:10719;589;of documentary, an interesting prep reel of Cruise and Foxx getting into their roles and just one deleted scene.
I:10719;590;Well worthwhile even if you are not a fan of this genre.
I:10719;591;I'm not a fan of this movie, but my husband loves it, so I got it for him as a Christmas gift.
I:10719;592;He is probably watching it right now!
I:10719;593;And Vincent responds with the very matter.
I:10719;594;That's such a fantastic line.
I:10719;595;Okay, so I thought the plot was good.
I:10719;596;I recommend it, but if you're a huge fan of movies like this, I wouldn't take my opinion to mean much.
I:10719;597;It is a Micheal Mann movie, so you can expect great photography, well thought out plot and palpable tension, but the real stand out in this movie for me is Jamie Foxx.
I:10719;598;He's an intelligent, seemingly classically trained actor.
I:10719;599;You can't help but feel impress.
I:10719;600;"Foxx has a comedic face and he is known for comedy but he can also do drama and ""Collateral"" is the proof."
I:10719;601;The movie itself is beaurtiful to look at.
I:10719;602;Micheal Mann treated Los Angeles at night like an icy blonde, nice to look at with dangerous underpinnings.
I:10719;603;The plot and the tension is nicely paced and builds to a frantic ending.
I:10719;604;Oh, and Cruise is very convincing as a high priced killer, although his character could have done without the powderd, gray hair.
I:10719;605;essential Mann characteristics are present though, from masterful filming sequences, to an excellent soundtrack, but the flick remains one step behind the director's standards.
I:10719;606;well cast, entertaining, funny at times, this is a movie to enjoy if not expecting to be dazzled by movie making.
I:10719;607;Yeah he is type cast.
I:10719;608;Jaimie Fox does a very good job as well.
I:10719;609;The effort that both actors put into preparing for their respective roles is astounding.
I:10719;610;For those of you that enjoy the 'Michael Mann' flavour, this is an opportunity to experience it in a new mix.
I:10719;611;One of the hallmarks of previous Mann productions is the creation of atmosphere using well matched musical accompaniment.
I:10719;612;something happened there too and it was much more interesting.
I:10719;613;It's refreshing seeing Tom Cruise step outside the pretty.
I:10719;614;This is worthwhile entertainment that will grab you in the mood and take you with it.
I:10719;615;Whatever else you might fault with the production the visual treatment is terrific.
I:10719;616;stark, nihilistic, ambiguous and visually delicious.
I:10719;617;recommended dining:The Gaumont production 'La Femme Nikita' by Luc Besson provides a better example of mood and atmosphere or the so. called style over substance genre but with a surprising amount of substance and some pathos thrown in for good measure.
I:10719;618;If you've never seen a Micheal Mann film, he is very good at using a combination of script and filming to get the viewer to associate themselves with the characters as well as develop them to a point where you don't want to see them die, and when they do it's unexpected and really twists your insides if you allow yourself to be serious about watching the movie.
I:10719;619;jamie Foxx steals the show though.
I:10719;620;Vincent changes Foxx's characters life in both a positive way for his future and a negative way in the present.
I:10719;621;this movie was good up till the very end, not the events leading up to the last scene.
I:10719;622;The best part about the ending is that it is ironic since the irony came out of Cruise's mouth.
I:10719;623;The end in Collateral is similar, but more intense.
I:10719;624;this is easily the best movie of the summer, and Number 1 on my list of movies to own.
I:10719;625;If you've seen this movie I highly recommend Heat, and vis versa.
I:10719;626;There's something about this movie that you really want to like.
I:10719;627;It looks good at the beginning.
I:10719;628;Cruise is rather convincing in his role.
I:10719;629;Foxx does a fine job.
I:10719;630;This should have been a longer movie, and with more genuine plot twists.
I:10719;631;Jamie foxx does a great job as does tom cruise as he always does.
I:10719;632;He may be a little weird but he is a good actor and makes good movies for the most part.
I:10719;633;This film is an impressive thriller film combining clever dialogue with subtle dialogue and explosive action to rise the ranks easily to the top films of the year.
I:10719;634;Ala Hitchcock, the innocent man, Max (Jamie Foxx) gets in the way, gets involved, and gets thrown in the middle.
I:10719;635;The film dazzles, surprises, is barely guessable, and a lot of fun.
I:10719;636;And with dialogue that is so refreshingly unique and witty, I'm so pleased that this film boosts the stock of an otherwise weak year in film.
I:10719;637;He keeps his cab squeaky clean during his night shift, he knows his streets and his signals, and he always reaches his passengers' destinations in time.
I:10719;638;She gives him her card after a drive to the Justice Department, and Max can't decide at the moment if he wants to call her later or not.
I:10719;639;What comes next is something that is completely unexpected.
I:10719;640;He looks to be a business man, with a clean gray suit and a luxurious.
I:10719;641;Collateral is a movie that focuses on these two men of extreme differences.
I:10719;642;"Vincent never loved L. a.
I:10719;643;These two men find themselves questioning each other's motives and beliefs, which leads to an ultimate confrontation in the end.
I:10719;644;"the city of Los Angeles becomes an important ""character"" in the film."
I:10719;645;Director Michael Mann has really captured the look and feel of L. a. in an almost perfect way.
I:10719;646;The digital cinematography makes it all worthwhile.
I:10719;647;cruise, Foxx, Pinket Smith, and Ruffalo make a fine acting ensemble.
I:10719;648;blooded contract killer who knows how to properly use a gun.
I:10719;649;Foxx manages to play the part of the average guy very well.
I:10719;650;"He should've won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, but his win for ""Ray"" clearly makes up for it."
I:10719;651;Pinkett Smith's role is smaller in the film, but it is influential in that she becomes part of Vincent's questioning of Max's life.
I:10719;652;She is a fine actress, and she never misses a beat here.
I:10719;653;Ruffalo may be a bit off at times, but he is still believable as the Detective who starts to see that the killings may be linked to something more serious.
I:10719;654;this is one of my favorite movies in general.
I:10719;655;the steps the story takes makes sense and are logical.
I:10719;656;the suspense filled moments were well directed and kept you on the edge of your seat.
I:10719;657;jaime Foxx is definitely demonstrating he can do serious roles and not just comedy.
I:10719;658;Every single bit that comprises this masterpiece was crafted so well: the direction, the performances, the script.
I:10719;659;goody roles for the extent of his career, he is finally revealing his dark side and he delivers.
I:10719;660;After this convincing performance, I am certain some will begin to question his Hollywood Nice Guy reputation.
I:10719;661;Grim at times, sometimes poignant, and with a touch of wry humor, his performance is simply unforgettable.
I:10719;662;He is able to show his character worry, contemplate, and mature so well.
I:10719;663;lastly, there is the incredible script.
I:10719;664;The cab exchanges between Max and Vincent, besides showcasing the fantastic chemistry between Cruise and Foxx, become scenes of psychological warfare between the two.
I:10719;665;But rarely are they ever so close to perfection that you wonder when such a film can ever be outdone.
I:10719;666;Then again, Collateral is a rare movie in and of itself, the sum of all equally great parts, an exhilarating trip through Los Angeles, that it deserves to be one of those films.
I:10719;667;drawn chase and fight scenes, etc.
I:10719;668;For what it is worth, this is an entertaining film.
I:10719;669;It certainly held my interest for the most part, but it began to wane as the movie progressed.
I:10719;670;I found the first half of the movie was far more enjoyable than the latter half, and, as the second half unfolded, and with each new chase and each new murder by Cruise, I found myself rolling my eyes more and more at the preposterousness of it all.
I:10719;671;standers and, well, calmly shoots innocent by.
I:10719;672;still, on a lighter note, an aspect of the movie that is rewarding is the acting in itself.
I:10719;673;going cab driver with bigger goals in life.
I:10719;674;It is a fun movie and it will be better if you can stretch your imagination and not be bothered by the usual clich s in action films.
I:10719;675;Collateral is a truly excellent and intelligent thriller.
I:10719;676;One of the most captivating movies I have seen since the start of the new Millennium.
I:10719;677;I am not a Tom Cruise fan, on the contrary I would say, but in his role of contract hitman Vincent he is very convincing.
I:10719;678;Director Michael Mann creates a fascinating athmosphere.
I:10719;679;This is surely a movie that you'll want to see more often than once.
I:10719;680;crafted psychological thriller and police.
I:10719;681;Jaime Foxx and Tom Cruise do it again in this movie!
I:10719;682;this movie is awesome and I highly recommend this film to anyone.
I:10719;683;One of the best movies of 2004
I:10719;684;After being the hero in so many films he reverses the rolls and lets Jamie Fox be the good guy.
I:10719;685;A very cool film by Michael Mann.
I:10719;686;collateral has action,suspense and very good performances.
I:10719;687;all in a beautiful location of L. a. that makes this film very cool.
I:10719;688;he meets on one of his rides a beautiful attorney Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith) and gets lucky with getting her phone number.
I:10719;689;as luck hit him well with Annie.
I:10719;690;vincent is a cool guy that we kind of like.
I:10719;691;he likes Jazz,he's smart,he's nice.
I:10719;692;in each of his films you will see the characters fledge out.
I:10719;693;each character is special and interesting in Michael Mann films.
I:10719;694;there as important as the plot.
I:10719;695;we cant forget Jamie Foxx performance that got him a Oscar and Golden Globe nomination.
I:10719;696;always a comedian Foxx as with other actors.
I:10719;697;he got his chance in Oliver Stone's Any Given Sunday where from them to now.
I:10719;698;now award winning actor on to better and bigger things.
I:10719;699;michael Mann on this film used for the first time a high definition camera.
I:10719;700;he uses high def for the unique look of L. a. at night.
I:10719;701;this a great L. a. with great locals through out L. a. from palm trees,to ghettos to Korea Town.
I:10719;702;Plus nobody knows L. a. like Michael Mann.
I:10719;703;also that it's a hase scene in the end.
I:10719;704;i think it's a good ending but it also goes on taste and what you prefer.
I:10719;705;but besides that it's a good commentary track.
I:10719;706;the behind the scenes of the film is about 40 minutes with very interesting facts and information of the film and on production and preperation.
I:10719;707;this a nice film with a lot emotion as well for the character that we care for.
I:10719;708;michael Mann is one of the best directors out there.
I:10719;709;and proves once again that he is a great director.
I:10719;710;this is not one of the best films you will see.
I:10719;711;but you will have a fun ride and enjoy countless of times.
I:10719;712;"It's generally accepted that his masterpiece was 1995's ""Heat,"" the epitome of filmic cool."
I:10719;713;"But in ""Collateral,"" he makes a movie nearly as good by stretching himself and showing us something new."
I:10719;714;"While ""Heat"" had a lot of warmth in the peripheral human drama, at its cold cold heart was the cool vs. cool of DeNiro and Pacino."
I:10719;715;living cab driver and perpetual momma's boy, played with remarkable precision and ability by Jaime Foxx.
I:10719;716;That is, until Vincent steps into his cab.
I:10719;717;dressed man offering a very simple deal to Max: work all night, make five stops, get to the airport by 6:00 am, and earn 700 dollars.
I:10719;718;cool leading men dressed, like so many of the director's cool killers, in a suit and no tie.
I:10719;719;And at first, there's a good deal of fun to be had watching him try to coach Max into coolness through sheer force of ego and personality.
I:10719;720;max seems overtaxed by such simple everyday trials, until Vincent steps up to show him how to sail through such situations with ease.
I:10719;721;they offer a good look at the perfectionism and artistic process of an incredible director, although for me that can be bittersweet, like watching a magician reveal his tricks.
I:10719;722;But most importantly, the characters are fleshed out and interesting and real.
I:10719;723;"While ""Heat"" showed us a cop and robber who were astonishingly similar, who were inexorably drawn to one another in the course of a drama that sprawled like L. a. itself, this gives us a tight little movie with two men destined to repel one another despite their proximity."
I:10719;724;Michael Mann is a wonderful director, and i have to say this is his best movie.
I:10719;725;He is walking the streets with thousand of dollars cash in his pockets, has vastly superior physical skills, slings and shoots a double.
I:10719;726;barrel magnum like he's flinging a biscuit to a poodle, and carries a highly sophisticated laptop loaded with a wireless internet connection and a file that includes the pictures, names, addresses and biographical summaries of his six victims.
I:10719;727;Most hilarious of all is the arrogant hitman's assertion that anonymity is his code .
I:10719;728;Yet this wholly unbelievable scenario manages to pull itself off, thanks to the compelling work of Jamie Fox, whose tandem with the brutally suave Tom Cruise gradually rises to a fever pitch of suspense, humor and moral quandry.
I:10719;729;Fox turns in an endearing and intense performance as an under.
I:10719;730;achieving cabbie who is hurled into epiphany by circumstances beyond his imagination or control, while Tom Cruise delivers his strongest performance since playing a sleezy and misogynistic motivational speaker in Magnolia .
I:10719;731;The premise the film depends on for its effect is entirely fantastic and challenges even the most boundless imagination, but Michael Mann's script and instinct for suspense does more than save the film: it makes for one of the year's finest movies.
I:10719;732;If you are willing to relinquish your grounding in the real world in exchange for the thrill ride of the summer, you're in for a real treat.
I:10719;733;collateral is a very intelligent, yet simple action movie.
I:10719;734;This is one of Cruise's best characters ever.
I:10719;735;If you enjoy a smooth talking, Charismatic, Clint eastwood style badguy then you will love this movie.
I:10719;736;Ahh, but that's just what we need!
I:10719;737;If you need a fun escape, then take a ride with Foxx and Cruise in Collateral.
I:10719;738;COLLATERAL is simply excellent entertainment.
I:10719;739;The direction by Michael Mann is tense, highly nuanced, and achieves superb performances from of his excellent cast.
I:10719;740;The camera work takes us places Los Angeles hides under smog during the day, skylines at night so magnificent you'd think they were New York.
I:10719;741;The accompanying musical score is apropos and builds tension.
I:10719;742;But in the end it is the tour de force of the interaction between Foxx and Cruise that makes this movie more than just another summer action flick.
I:10719;743;otherwise, Jamie Foxx is great and the film is entertaining.
I:10719;744;"This not the typical action flick you see those saturdays at night beacuse Micheal Mann has done the greatest action movies ever with his previous works like ""Heat"" and ""The Insider"" are proofs why Mr. mann is one the best action movie directors, Collateral is not one of those stupid non."
I:10719;745;He is good, to be sure.
I:10719;746;He has already proven himself more resourceful and resilient than viewers might have guessed at first.
I:10719;747;By the end of the film, Max proves himself more than the killer's equal, matching him manoeuvre for manoeuvre.
I:10719;748;Affable and modest about his talents, he nonetheless conveys quite early on that, in the contest of wills with this murderous outsider, he will prove to have home turf advantage.
I:10719;749;eyed but spouting eminently existential one.
I:10719;750;This I thought was a really good movie and I got it for less than $10.00.
I:10719;751;Tom and Jamie did really nice jobs of acting in this.
I:10719;752;There are also quite a few extras on this disc too.
I:10719;753;Overall I think you will be happy when you see it.
I:10719;754;I recommend this good flick.
I:10719;755;The master knows how to develop deeply motivated criminals (Frank in THIEF, Neil in HEAT) and give them their own unique look.
I:10719;756;COLLATERAL belongs to it's players: Cruise, Jamie Foxx and the usual important supporting roles: Peter Berg, Bruce McGill and Jada Pinkett.
I:10719;757;COLLATERAL is one of 2004's best films, at last this may be Mann's Oscar year.
I:10719;758;Jamie Fox was impressive in an ubelievable character.
I:10719;759;The cast and acting were excellent.
I:10719;760;Tom Cruise put on an excellent display of firearms proficiency!
I:10719;761;"smith (""Woo"", etc.) have small roles in this entertaining thriller."
I:10719;762;The ending SUCKED, however, but overall, it was an excellent thrill ride.
I:10719;763;sadly,I havent followed his films but he does manage to raise an important point.
I:10719;764;i can safely say Tom Cruise proves himself time and again as one of the best actors time has seen.
I:10719;765;also the discussion of Miles Davis in a jazz bar was more interesting than what I can possibly try and comprehend.
I:10719;766;it's just that it perfectly fits the four star grade.
I:10719;767;and oh yes,Tom Cruise's suit fits him like silver skin.
I:10719;768;he's a bit of a Terminator 2 villain in this film and I'm sure a lot of people would love to watch this side of the man.
I:10719;769;paced flick, but, like all Michael Mann action flicks, it is beautifully executed.
I:10719;770;While there are guns, danger, darkness, and fear, there is also beautiful music, stunning camera work, and characters with great depth.
I:10719;771;In a way, Collateral is nostalgic, recalling a time when character development meant more than giving a character a wife with a minor speaking part.
I:10719;772;slightly eccentric casting pays off in the case of Cruise and Fox, one easily believable as a suave killer who could pass for a businessman, the other equally believable as an ordinary guy with an acute sense of humor.
I:10719;773;"the strong performances by the two main characters and the solid, clever script are the main attractions, but also worth noticing is the beautiful photography
I:10719;774;There's something about seeing Tom Cruise effortlessly break a man's leg with a stomp kick which alone is worth the price of admission.
I:10719;775;thematically, Collateral is interesting, although Cruise's Philosophical Villain may seem overplayed to those very familiar with such devices.
I:10719;776;Even at the end, when it seems to degenerate into a simple action picture, the themes are still subtly operating, and are strongest in the last scene.
I:10719;777;i'm wondering if this film is destined to become a sleeper hit.
I:10719;778;The movie is excellent with a highly original and awesome plot, loads of great action and suspense scenes, one awesome shootout at a nightclub, lots of great humor, and one scene where Vincent completely destroys some punks that steal his briefcase.
I:10719;779;It's got the perfect cast, and everything else I already said.
I:10719;780;It's more like a play than a standard movie in that it relies on strong characters and a simple chance series of events to make its point.
I:10719;781;He is witty, dangerous, and utterly ruthless, a professional who is not the overly compentent standard sociopathic antagonist.
I:10719;782;Their chemistry together is GREAT.
I:10719;783;This is one of the BEST performances ever by TOM CRUISE.
I:10719;784;he is, absolutely, CONVINCING and TERRIFYING as a COLD BLOODED SOCIOPATH.
I:10719;785;Certainly one of the best Micheal Mann (director) movies.
I:10719;786;This movie is very much character driven and the dialogue is great, but there is also MASSIVE ACTION.
I:10719;787;tOM CRUISE is one of our greatest contemporary actors and, in my opinion, is grossly under appreciated (despite his many movies and wealth) because of his personal life.
I:10719;788;He is a GREAT actor and VERSATILE in all genres, i. e. action, drama/melodrama and comedy.
I:10719;789;I'm a big fan of Mann's movies.
I:10719;790;He's a man with dreams, but who has driven a cab for 12 years, telling himself and others that he has big plans and one day he'll give up this temporary job.
I:10719;791;But the last one, means something to Max.
I:10719;792;The tension ebbs and flows, then builds to a crescendo, only to rise again.
I:10719;793;For the most part, this film will leave you breathless and perhaps wondering about your own values as you sympathize with the characters.
I:10719;794;It is either that Michael Mann is a real movie stylist or that he knows exactly which cinematographer to hire.
I:10719;795;Heat is still my personal favorite: Collateral is highly entertaining itself, but Heat is more hypnotic.
I:10719;796;What is most memorable about Collateral, at least to me, is all that driving at night and all that conversation between strangers taking place in the dark of the night, and that alone was worth two hours of my time.
I:10719;797;I was alone and most peaceful, almost hopeful, and this movie took me back to that place, which was in a strange way a very good place.
I:10719;798;Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise did a very good job acting.
I:10719;799;Great Michael Mann actioner with an amazing Jamie Foxx performance and Tom Cruise playing a human.
I:10719;800;i love the film and admire Cruise for having the guts to take a role so far against type for him.
I:10719;801;He absolutely nails it!Foxx matches him stride.
I:10719;802;The arc of his character, and the subtlety Foxx brings to the progression, are amazing.
I:10719;803;His character's turning point in the movie is one of the most compelling moments I've seen on celluloid.
I:10719;804;r. rated for startling and graphic .
I:10719;805;I recently played the game Hitman 2: Silent Assassin on my Gamecube.
I:10719;806;competent assassin would off at the end of the night anyway.
I:10719;807;Whatever the bad guys are paying him, the paycheck far exceeds the skill.
I:10719;808;michael Mann directs the film with amazing skill, brilliantly capturing the multiple looks and feelings of night.
I:10719;809;There are many scenes of tangible atmosphere in Collateral, so much so that the film is eerily calming.
I:10719;810;cruise and Foxx have great chemistry together though it must be said that Foxx comes off as the better performer/character.
I:10719;811;The Dolby 5.1 soundtrack is also stunning, fully complimenting the movie's dynamic sound design.
I:10719;812;James Newton Howard's atmospheric score is also seamlessly woven into the film's sound design and it's surely Howard at the top of his game, miraculously blending his own score with non.
I:10719;813;Though horribly disturbing, Ellis's portrayal of the serial killer, embedded within his time at the close of the 1980s and early 1990s, and particularly that time in New York City, for me, stands out as one of the most astonishing works of fiction written.
I:10719;814;Cruise is subtle and unrelenting.
I:10719;815;It is a great movie at the level of aesthetics (all of it taking place at night, bringing a feast of tones and images to the eyes), but also in terms of dialogue.
I:10719;816;Mixed in is a powerful and curious combination of fatalism, Taoism even, and animal.
I:10719;817;How many of us can really, truly say that good triumphs in this complex, unfathomable world?
I:10719;818;Collateral is a fashionable example of just how exuberant a thriller can be.
I:10719;819;Max ends up winning his bet with Annie, but he insists that the ride be free of charge.
I:10719;820;Then Annie unexpectedly returns to the cab, taps on the window, and hands him her card.
I:10719;821;Vincent is a polite, charming, and conversational individual.
I:10719;822;He has a big night ahead of him .
I:10719;823;Collateral is all about dialogue and set pieces, with a story managing to fit perfectly into a script.
I:10719;824;Max finds himself fending for his life, as Vincent abruptly morphs into a malevolent customer.
I:10719;825;Collateral is such an intelligent film that seems so complex, but is instead so simple.
I:10719;826;It is incredible how situations so simple can grasp your attention just by the words that are exchanged by the characters involved.
I:10719;827;Collateral s final twenty minutes should be its most enticing, and while they are, they are also the sloppiest.
I:10719;828;I would have loved to have seen the film end in something besides a chase that rampages through a massive building and concludes on a subway, but Michael Mann's direction and Stuart Beattie's screenplay thoughtfully turn it into an intriguing cat.
I:10719;829;"if nothing else, ""Collateral"" is purely electrifying when it wants to be, and even when it isn't it is still an enjoyable watch."
I:10719;830;What we have here is a thriller that focuses on its two main characters, gives them a certain period of time to battle it out, and entertains the audience in the process.
I:10719;831;While there is not enough potential for an Oscar as far as best film goes, this is still a great movie, but screenwriter Stuart Beattie should be given an award for his trouble.
I:10719;832;Tom Cruise did a good job playing the bad guy, not as good as Arnold though!
I:10719;833;From a craft point of view, of course, the film is superb: Cruise and Foxx give tight performances, and Michael Mann can direct stylish action set.
I:10719;834;Everyone involved in this project is at the peak of their powers.
I:10719;835;cruise, in his always polished and convincing manner, nevertheless spouts a lot of fake philosophical hooey about the cosmos and self.
I:10719;836;he's a hit man (oooh), and he's got a gun (oh my).
I:10719;837;As in so much hip.
I:10719;838;They've all done enough stellar work that we can let them slide on this one.
I:10719;839;Try a bit harder next time, guys, and I bet you make a masterpiece.
I:10719;840;"Hollywood is big on ""myth"" structured movies nowadays, as many screenwriting manuals will attest."
I:10719;841;but given that, it's a good story because it contains the primal elements of myth.
I:10719;842;If you've only seen this film once, I recommend seeing it again.
I:10719;843;Collateral delivers an interesting story with a tight pace, with some intense action sequences.
I:10719;844;the best part I thought was the action.
I:10719;845;Jamie Foxx is convincing at playing a cabbie going about his daily doldrums, and is gradually pushed past the border of sanity by his involuntary role in a killing spree.
I:10719;846;He eventually reacts to it in the most heroic and unthinkable way.
I:10719;847;Foxx is good in this movie, but I'm not sure if he's Oscar.
I:10719;848;The action is intense and tight here too, and definitely kept me at the edge of my seat.
I:10719;849;He will even go slightly further.
I:10719;850;The interest is the rhythm and the twists in the fabric of the tale.
I:10719;851;In fact it is economical in blood and even bullets because it centers on the psychological profile of the taxi.
I:10719;852;"Typical Mann movie
I:10719;853;If you already own couple Mann movies add this one to your collection, it is definitely worthy of my collection.
I:10719;854;Beyond the solid direction, there's very little original territory here.
I:10719;855;There is nothing original here, and solid performances and superb direction by Mann don't elevate this beyond a standard thriller.
I:10719;856;Michael Mann is expanding on his own genre of gritty crime dramas with Collateral.
I:10719;857;Using high definition video, he creates the most realistic vision of L. A. that I have ever seen on screen.
I:10719;858;Cruise and Foxx are exceptional here.
I:10719;859;out performances that are unique in their restraint.
I:10719;860;Instead they keep with the whole tone of the film and what you do get is much more rewarding and compelling.
I:10719;861;The real reward here is in the performances and the brilliant direction of Mann, who achieves even greater success with a more minimal approach.
I:10719;862;Both play their parts very well, especially Cruise.
I:10719;863;up, but the balance works.
I:10719;864;There is a lot of justified praise here for this movie.
I:10719;865;The acting is good, the plot is interesting, the dialogue is interesting and funny, the music is good, and the film looks great.
I:10719;866;a better performance than cruise's.
I:10719;867;foxx proves himself to be quite a versatile actor in this film.)
I:10719;868;decent action, laughs, acting, etc., and a somewhat thought.
I:10719;869;it's creative and exciting cheap thrills make Collateral worth seeing, but it doesn't go down as one of my favorites
I:10719;870;inspired to write a brief one about _Collateral_, the film I just experienced.
I:10719;871;i thought Cruise was fun to watch, whether his acting was good or not.
I:10719;872;as for the plot, it was very fun to watch and very engaging until Foxx called Smith from the top of the building and, surprise!
I:10719;873;But with its tight writing and direction, and great performances by all actors involved, Collateral is without a doubt one of the best movies of this summer, and the surprise sleeper hit of the year.
I:10719;874;While there are several scenes of gunplay, the core of this movie deals with the interaction between Vincent and Max.
I:10719;875;it is true that, like in most movies, Collateral's most interesting character is the villain.
I:10719;876;Cruise's portrayal of the character is amazing.
I:10719;877;As Vincent, Cruise delivers his lines with such ease and confidence, that it's more than worthy of Oscar consideration.
I:10719;878;He is also extremely resourceful, as shown when he pretends to be a lawyer telling off Max's boss when he (the boss) wants to take any damages done to the taxi out of Max's paycheck.
I:10719;879;Vincent also always has something sarcastic (and often funny) say to Max when he begins to criticize what Vincent has done.
I:10719;880;'Max himself is also an interesting character, and is surprisingly well.
I:10719;881;He tells people who get in his cab about his intentions to own a limo service and drive around famous people, yet at the same time he projects a sense that this is more of a dream than a real plan, and you feel sorry for him.
I:10719;882;And when Max has to confront a powerful drug lord while posing as Vincent, he has to force himself to become as cool and collected as Vincent himself.
I:10719;883;an interesting thing to note about this movie is, just like Michael Man's other movie Heat, Collateral likes to use a lot of the wide shots of the background.
I:10719;884;In Heat this was used to good effect to give that movie a more `epic' experience.
I:10719;885;With so many special effect blockbusters out there this summer, Collateral bucks the trend by providing a movie that focuses on strong characters and dialogue, and a few unexpected twists, rather than relying on huge explosions.
I:10719;886;The best scene of Collateral has to be when Vincent's briefcase is jacked from Max's (Foxx) cab by a couple of street punks.
I:10719;887;The ultimate payoff in this film is certainly not worth the ride.
I:10719;888;Overall, Collateral is a marked step back for Michael Mann but a great expansion of range for Cruise.
I:10719;889;Collateral has got to be one of the best and most excitiing crime thrillers made in years!!!
I:10719;890;hour adrenaline rush from start to finish, filled with gritty action, and outstanding performances.
I:10719;891;This movie is going to set Jamie Foxx up for a whole bunch of great roles in the future and along with the biography of the late.
I:10719;892;great Ray Charles he is set to star in later this year, this will be a huge year for him.
I:10719;893;the intensity and energy of the movie will keep you in tune to it throughout and the last 20 minutes will have you on the edge of your seat!!!
I:10719;894;"If you want to actually get your money's worth and have fun at the movies definitely go see ""Collateral."""
I:10719;895;Tom Cruise was excellent in this film, perhaps the best performance I have ever seen him have.
I:10719;896;Not the best film out there, but certainly worth a l
I:10719;897;Watching this film noir was pleasurable, I had plenty of opportunities to interact with it.
I:10719;898;The entire film is full of them, the climactic end not sparing either!
I:10719;899;After being shot in the face he manages to leap frog onto the back of a speeding subtrain.
I:10719;900;But it's just one of those films.
I:10719;901;The cinematography focuses, at its most creative moments, on the lonely nature that lives on the peripheral of the city limits.
I:10719;902;See if you can catch them all.
I:10719;903;And as a New Yorker, I can tell you that the chance of getting an English.
I:10719;904;speaking cabbie is rare, as well as a clean cab, along with a nice driver.
I:10719;905;is masterful as an underworld hitman who commandeers Jamie Fox and his cab in order to carry out a string of assassinations on government witnesses before they can testify against the thug who hired Cruise.
I:10719;906;fox turns in a memorable performance as the cabby who turns the tables on Cruise when he discovers the identity of one of Cruise's targets.
I:10719;907;I quicklyfound myself void of interest, energy, and sanity.
I:10719;908;Collateral is, in it's own twisted way, a throwback to the crime/noir films of the 40's and 50's, even if modernized quitea bit.
I:10719;909;From the moment Vincent (hitman/sociopath) played by Tom Cruise jumps in for the ride,we feel the city somehow come alive.
I:10719;910;The one unbelievable aspect is that Vincent could keep this goofball alive.
I:10719;911;The ending is an improbable turn of nail biting events whichend in Vincent's death.
I:10719;912;This movie approaches greatness, but I think a Morgan Freeman or a more classical type actor would have been better than Jamie Foxx.
I:10719;913;This film is special on so many fronts.
I:10719;914;The way that the film is shot and how Mann makes nocturnal Los Angeles a living character is just outstanding.
I:10719;915;Cruise and Foxx are at the top of their respective games, each going against type and performing close to flawlessly.
I:10719;916;"A nod should also go to Jada Pinkett Smith, one of the more underrated actresses at present
I:10719;917;You care about Max and Vincent's relationship and you are interested to see what happens between the two of them.
I:10719;918;The film really reminds you of how anonymous most people are, despite the fact that the main three characters find themselves intertwined.
I:10719;919;I'd rank it as high as Heat and it is easily one of my favorites of all time.
I:10719;920;I recognize I probably liked it more than most, but I promise you that Collateral will linger in your mind far longer than the vast majority of films being made.
I:10719;921;The look, the feel, the action.
I:10719;922;It is gritty and raw.
I:10719;923;This movie hooks you in the beginning and even lets up.
I:10719;924;"it also is a thinking action movie when they talk about life ""stuff""."
I:10719;925;the plot of the film is great and has an ironic twist at the end which I loved.
I:10719;926;overall, it was a good movie and enjoyable as one of Cruise's rare bad guy roles.
I:10719;927;I loaned the movie to my son, and he wont give it back.
I:10719;928;The movie is good enough to get another for myself.
I:10719;929;Tom Cruise is actually at his best when playing a villain just like in Interview with the Vampire.
I:10719;930;He's funny but is also really good at being a sensitive and soft spoken actor as well.
I:10719;931;also good in supporting roles are Mark Ruffalo (13 Going on 30) as a cop who stumbles on to one of Vincent's crime scenes.
I:10719;932;Jada Pinkett Smith has good chemestry with Foxx eventhough they only have small scenes together.
I:10719;933;She plays a lawyer that Max picks up one day and they get along so well that she gives him her business card so he can call her.
I:10719;934;Collateral is suspenseful and has lots of violence but just like in Mann's Heat these 2 totally opposite guys interact and talk and get to know each other.
I:10719;935;This movie was really good.
I:10719;936;Cruise looks cool with the grey hair and Jaime Fox did an excellent job.
I:10719;937;Leave it to Michael Mann to create classy, intelligent thrillers.
I:10719;938;At a time when most thrillers forsake characterization and genuine suspense for car chases and repetitive gun fights, it's refreshing to see directors like Mann take the action genre seriously as an art form.
I:10719;939;"Mann has given us the terrific ""Heat"" and ""The Insider""
I:10719;940;Here, Mann skillfully uses Cruise's trademark cockiness to create a chilling character.
I:10719;941;"the real star in ""Collateral"" is Los Angeles."
I:10719;942;"Rarely has Los Angeles looked more decadent than in ""Collateral""."
I:10719;943;and for fans hungry for some action, there are two excellent action sequences that'll whet your appetite.
I:10719;944;Both action scenes are edited to achieve a relentless pace and propel narrative momentum.
I:10719;945;"michael Mann's ""Collateral"" is a beautifully crafted, terrifically acted and immensely entertaining thriller that stimulates the mind and rattles the emotion."
I:10719;946;Collateral is a triumph and one of the best movies of 2004.
I:10719;947;A stylish thriller, yes, but I found it very difficult to get past many of the preposterous holes in the logic of the film.
I:10719;948;The first two acts are good, anchored by Jamie Fox's self.
I:10719;949;assured character acting and Tom Cruise's surprisingly subtle approach.
I:10719;950;I was excited about watching this movie.
I:10719;951;Really like the cast members and had heard good reviews.
I:10719;952;His dream, as he tells various fares, is to own his own luxury limo company: Island Limos.
I:10719;953;$600 is a lot of money for one night's worth of work.
I:10719;954;what is fascinating about this movie is how the relationship between Vincent and Max works.
I:10719;955;Yet, there is a certain charm to Vincent, and he treats Max well so long as Max goes along with what Vincent wants.
I:10719;956;There is not a friendship here, but throughout the movie a grudging respect between the two characters build.
I:10719;957;The viewer can guess in what direction the film is going by the way director Michael Mann ties things together early on in the movie.
I:10719;958;"Collateral is building to this ending, which I felt was fully appropriate, the entire movie and with the exception of a single scene where Vincent becomes the second coming of the T.1000 from ""Terminator 2"", everything in ""Collateral"" works for me."
I:10719;959;The city itself is a character, giving setting and tone and depth and a sense of place to the film.
I:10719;960;Collateral can be dark and violent, but it is also intelligent and stylish.
I:10719;961;The whole film does (excluding that one scene I mentioned), and when put together it is better than its parts, and this includes the fantastic performances by Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx.
I:10719;962;thriller from Michale Mann is more than satisfactory, it's one highly enjoyable ride loaded with thrilling performances from Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx.
I:10719;963;Michael Mann of course has crafted many great thrillers incluing Manhunter, Thief and the superb Heat.
I:10719;964;nomination, Ali and THe Last of the Mohicans.
I:10719;965;Then we meet Vincent played wonderfully by Cruise, with his salt and pepper hair and shades.
I:10719;966;The suspense and tension build up and we reach an exciting and intense climax.
I:10719;967;This is probably one of the more enjoyable films of the summer, I mean we've got good action, acting, story and suspense, what more could you ask for.
I:10719;968;The movie isn't perfect but it proves to be a great and remarkbly smart and well.
I:10719;969;collateral is rated R for Violence and Language.
I:10719;970;THe action is surprisingly good and there's plenty, but probably not enough to satisfy hardcore action fans.
I:10719;971;The language is fair, not constant but a substantial amount.
I:10719;972;Overall a great thriller, worth seeing in the theatre.
I:10719;973;Collateral is an action packed movie thriller which succedes in being fairly entertaining.
I:10719;974;The acting in this movie is exceptionally good and the Director Micael Mann does a swell job.
I:10719;975;collateral is a descent movie that is worth watching.
I:10719;976;"Forget the contrived ending in an empty city
I:10719;977;I like the majority of the films Tom Cruise has made but this one is my favorite in both the storyline and his performance.
I:10719;978;jamieFoxx also does a nice job with his character.
I:10719;979;This is an excellent film on all levels.
I:10719;980;Collateral is an excellent film.
I:10719;981;i've enjoyed Michael Mann's work for a while going back to Miami Vice.
I:10719;982;He's as gray as his soul.
I:10719;983;Still, Foxx made good progress throughout the movie on his journey of empowerment until the finale where of course, he must take on Cruise to save his sweetie.
I:10719;984;A bit of a stretch to be sure, still the interplay between them and the dark streets and night of LaLa Land as a setting made the movie gripping, and ultimately memorable I think.
I:10719;985;But Cruise continues to surprise with his versatility as an actor and you can see him get better with each film he does.
I:10719;986;eyed professional contract killer is intense in every sense of the word and combine that with Jamie Foxx's terrific performance and you have the makings of a very good film.
I:10719;987;He ends up picking up a fare called Vincent(Cruise), who is impressed by Max's knowledge of the streets and routes around Los Angeles.
I:10719;988;a ton of money if he will stay with him all.
I:10719;989;The plot really picks up and never lets down after that great scene that sets up the rest of the movie.
I:10719;990;book thriller and I found that aspect very interesting.
I:10719;991;The cinematography, which is beautiful but very dark, adds greatly to the atmosphere.
I:10719;992;It really grabs you and pulls you into the story.
I:10719;993;And Michael Mann's direction is sure and steady, keeping the action coming just when things appear to be slowing down.
I:10719;994;Mann keeps proving himself as one of the best directors out there.
I:10719;995;while Collateral proves itself as an above.
I:10719;996;Up to that point I felt the film was very unique, but the ending seemed to drawn from every other film of the genre.
I:10719;997;Still the film packs a great punch and features two great performances by the lead actors.
I:10719;998;Don't let the title mislead you, Collateral is an excellent movie.
I:10719;999;The acting is superb, and it is a very well thought out action movie.
I:10719;1000;well,the worm has certainly turned in this one,and I was pleasently surprise by this film.
I:10719;1001;"tom Cruise who typically is ""the maveric"" character who battles predictable demons in many of his action based films takes on a very interesting character."
I:10719;1002;on the outside he is easy to decipher.
I:10719;1003;"i thoroughly enjoyed his enlighting conversations with jamie Fox&outlook
I:10719;1004;i don't want to give up really anything about this movie,as it really is one of Cruise's best thus far.
I:10719;1005;it just goes to show that he is an individual that takes his acting seriously,and will go all out for the right script/part.
I:10719;1006;cruise hits a good one now and then,and I think he's due for an Oscar.
I:10719;1007;Surprisingly Good Movie,Tom Cruise is impeccable in the movie, Jamie Foxx even better.
I:10719;1008;it's a good high paced thriller movie.
I:10719;1009;the circumstances of the two characters and how everything intertwines is good.
I:10719;1010;Now, while there's nothing wrong with that, and it is a nail.
I:10719;1011;I must say, however, that the acting by both Cruise and Foxx is superb, and it's difficult to tell which is the Lead and which the Supporting role.
I:10719;1012;"I think the best film of the year is ""Kill Bill Vo.2"" and this is a close second."
I:10719;1013;the performances are absolutely amazing.
I:10719;1014;jamie Foxx has been getting the best reviews for this film and I think he will be nominatedfor Best Supporting Actor for this film.
I:10719;1015;Tom Cruise gives an Oscar worthy performance but I don't think Cruise is gonna score gold this year.
I:10719;1016;"But,the story (by ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" writer Stuart Beattie) is spectacular and it's masterfully directed by Michael Mann."
I:10719;1017;The two develop a sort of weird friendship along the way,but the movie is totally suspenceful and just plain terrific.
I:10719;1018;"It's his best performance since ""Eyes Wide Shut""."
I:10719;1019;"Jamie Foxx (who started off as a comedian, then came into drama with Oliver Stone's crappy""Any Given Sunday"") gives his best performance until a few months later when ""Ray"" was released."
I:10719;1020;But, yeah see this movie for sure.
I:10719;1021;This was a nice turn for Cruise .
I:10719;1022;he actually comes off well as the baddy.
I:10719;1023;Jamie Foxx is also fairly good as the good guy, although his performance is a little uneven .
I:10719;1024;The exchanges between Cruise and Foxx are some of the best scenes.
I:10719;1025;The special features like the making of collateral are really excellent.
I:10719;1026;I enjoy most Michael Mann movies and seeing how he makes them and how the actors get into their characters is terrific.
I:10719;1027;I also think having Tom Cruise (not one of my favorite actors) play the hit man is great casting.
I:10719;1028;Both the lead actors are very good in this but Tom Cruise is just a bit more polished and believable an actor in his role than Jamie Foxx.
I:10719;1029;This is a violent movie but also creates a mood that gives it power.
I:10719;1030;Highly recommended if you like action flicks that stick close to realism.
I:10719;1031;The teaming of Cruise and Jaime Foxx in this movie was true inspiration.
I:10719;1032;Cruise is totally convincing and effective in his role as murderous Vincent and Foxx does an equally good turn in his role as Max the taxi driver.
I:10719;1033;the mood of the movie is intense, the soundtrack is complimentary .
I:10719;1034;Anyone familiar with the work of director Michael Mann will immediately detect his artful style in this film.
I:10719;1035;this movie is suspenseful, violent, dramatic.
I:10719;1036;It also has elements of dark comedy interspersed throughout.
I:10719;1037;To use a clich , I found myself on the edge of my seat the whole time.
I:10719;1038;I thought I had it pegged from the commercials .
I:10719;1039;that Tom Cruise is a hit man, and that Jamie Foxx finally outsmarts him.
I:10719;1040;Tom Cruise gives a terrific performance in his first, all.
I:10719;1041;hero, Lestat), with a head of prematurely gray hair.
I:10719;1042;He attacks the part with his trademark enthusiasm, and is truly breathtaking when he is called upon to use violence.
I:10719;1043;Michael Mann, one of our best directors, wisely avoids the stereotype of making the race.
I:10719;1044;michael Mann's masterpiece is Heat .
I:10719;1045;but it still inhabits the same world of shadow.
I:10719;1046;The movie's strongest points are the excepcional direction by Michael Mann, and Jamie Foxx.
I:10719;1047;michael Mann wanted to do a thriller.
I:10719;1048;"And he did it, with a capital T. ""Collateral"" has some very strong moments, leaving the viewer tense for most of the time."
I:10719;1049;Jamie Foxx, strong in comedies, proves to be a very resourceful and convincing actor, carrying most of the weight of the movie on his back.
I:10719;1050;twist that is not unexpected (but not too obvious either) and provide the best moments of the movie.
I:10719;1051;Jada Pinkett also rises above the expected supporting role she's supposed to play.
I:10719;1052;Collateral is one more above.
I:10719;1053;average movie by Michael Mann, one of the (few) trully innovative directors in today's Hollywood.
I:10719;1054;Within an actor's career there is generally one film, sometimes more, that is viewed as a defining moment for that actor.
I:10719;1055;"For Tom Cruise, his defining moment, actually moments in his case, would be ""The Last Samurai"" and ""Collateral""
I:10719;1056;"for me, ""Collateral"" is the biggest defining moment in Tom Cruise's career, I know I said he's had two moments, but this movie is much more significant than ""The Last Samurai"", in terms of how convincing his performance truly was."
I:10719;1057;"Everything about Cruise's performance was brilliant, from his charm that masked his underlying evil, to his extreme intensity and sharp focus, he never once missed a beat, and that is what allowed ""Collateral"" to become such a defining moment in his long career."
I:10719;1058;the supporting cast, primarily Jamie Foxx, was very solid, engaging and thoroughly believable.
I:10719;1059;Jamie Foxx delivered an excellent performance as a cabbie who is deluding himself and those around him into believing that he will one day own a limo service for the rich and powerful.
I:10719;1060;From his attention to detail and cleanliness to his delusions of grandeur, nothing about Max would ever be the same after this night was over, and Jamie Foxx handled the evolution of his character with such ease and believability, that it's easy to see why he's become such a big star in Hollywood.
I:10719;1061;"directed by acclaimed director Michael Mann (""Heat""), whose great attention to detail and character development is appropriately suited to just this type of material, the fate of ""Collateral"" could not have been in any better hands."
I:10719;1062;Mann has managed to direct such big name stars as Al Pacino, Robert DeNiro, and Colin Farrell throughout his career, and he's become so powerful within the Hollywood system, that he actually had the clout to be able to reject Tom Cruise, at first, in regards to the role of Vincent.
I:10719;1063;Collateral is the kind of movie that demands your attention from start to finish, as it continuously builds up an intriguing story and increases the tension as the minutes tick by, leaving audiences on the edge of their seats until the credits roll.
I:10719;1064;Collateral is rated R for violence and language.
I:10719;1065;This film was very cool.
I:10719;1066;The plot was a little far fetched, but I really loved it.
I:10719;1067;there were also many errors in the making of the film such as seeing the camera man in the reflections and stuff like that, but that doesn't really take away from the fact that it is a entertaining movie.
I:10719;1068;overall I enjoyed the plot and action,but I did not enjoy the look.
I:10719;1069;It's fun and not to be taken very seriously.
I:10719;1070;I truthfully didnt think that cruise could pull off being a bad guy but i was wrong and it was a great movie.
I:10719;1071;Jada Pinket is also hot.
I:10719;1072;Anyway, that said, I had fun with this movie, to my great surprise.
I:10719;1073;talented acting, writing, and directing.
I:10719;1074;Some parts of the movie had serious artistic flair.
I:10719;1075;the cinematography is excellent and the soundtrack drives the action well.
I:10719;1076;"Cruise and Foxx are adept and earnest in their roles, and the dialogue works well enough, though it does break down at a few points
I:10719;1077;All in all a common thriller with solid technical merits, but proving once again that a great movie must have more than good cinematography and sound.
I:10719;1078;A truly superior movie must a decent, or at least believable, story and that is what this movie lacks.
I:10719;1079;Michael Mann, however, seamlessly brings the two together, and even treats the audience to excellent cinematography!
I:10719;1080;And remember to enjoy it!
I:10719;1081;This is the focus of Michael Mann's new suspense drama.
I:10719;1082;In the blink of an eye his life becomes a toy.
I:10719;1083;The film is filled with a lot of meaningful dialogue and it's meaningful because its true.
I:10719;1084;"This brings up the point of ""what can you do to make a difference""."
I:10719;1085;The other part is a well.
I:10719;1086;paced intense film that will grip you and won't let go.
I:10719;1087;This movie was really intense and very well made.
I:10719;1088;You know that this could have been a disaster of a movie, but with so many veterans on board they turned it into something very good, very good indeed.
I:10719;1089;aCTING: The acting here was top notch, very good.
I:10719;1090;But it's really the writer you have to credit here.
I:10719;1091;Tom Cruise was excellent, a very haunting role for the audience to watch.
I:10719;1092;He knows what he's doing and even though he's the bad guy, he is a smart one.
I:10719;1093;A great cast that delivered a superbly written movie.
I:10719;1094;The movie is a near perfect suspense drama.
I:10719;1095;If you know Michael Mann's work then you know you can expect something good, and even if this is your first Michael Mann movie you will enjoy this dark themed drama.
I:10719;1096;"When you live in the present you gotta ""roll with it""."
I:10719;1097;Well worth seeing, more than the usual twists and turns, although I do have to say the ending may be hotly debated by viewers .
I:10719;1098;Try to see it in a theatre without too many people or distractions so you can give it your full concentrations .
I:10719;1099;What a great cast and movie.
I:10719;1100;I have to say that Jada really set the perfect tone for the movie, building an instant rapport with Jamie Foxx's character that created a believable motivation for his actions later in the movie.
I:10719;1101;Jamie's performance was simply outstanding.
I:10719;1102;Great music soundtrack, great story, great supporting cast.
I:10719;1103;Jamie Foxx was brilliant and incredibly believable.You've gotta see this one.
I:10719;1104;Max, especially, has dreams of eventually owning his own limo service and striking it rich.
I:10719;1105;i enjoyed this film a lot, but I will concede that I probably liked it more for its ambition than for its execution.
I:10719;1106;still, better to have involving human characters that spout convincing dialogue rather than just another high.
I:10719;1107;And it helps that the performances are, for the most part, quite effective.
I:10719;1108;His touching performance as Max truly brings sympathy to his character, who is not only Vincent's victim but perhaps a victim of his own delusions of grandeur.
I:10719;1109;Still, Cruise pulls off this casting.
I:10719;1110;in short, COLLATERAL may not be a truly great film, but it is a good one that works as an effective suspense thriller and as a character study.
I:10719;1111;Tom Cruise does a fantastic job as a hired assassin who travels to Los Angeles to do some people in.
I:10719;1112;The acting was terrific, and so was the dialogue.
I:10719;1113;The Good Guy walks away with the Damsel in Distress at the end, giving her his coat to wear and throwing a protective arm around her shoulder.
I:10719;1114;Tom Cruise is a pretty decent actor in my opinion and Jamie Foxx was a big let down.
I:10719;1115;I was so excited and was so let down by how it ended up.
I:10719;1116;It simply could have been so much better and that is why i rate it 2 stars.
I:10719;1117;When you have something with this much potential then you need to make the movie as good as it can be.
I:10719;1118;The two men are drawn together in a very dramatic turn of events.
I:10719;1119;It's got two great actors, and a pretty original plot.
I:10719;1120;The conversations between the two characters are deep and very real.
I:10719;1121;There's just something missing that makes a movie a classic.
I:10719;1122;Nonetheless, Collateral is a pretty good movie, and it's worth watching.
I:10719;1123;Cruise is very good, although he isn't asked to give the acting workout that Jamie Foxx undergoes.
I:10719;1124;When fares begin to converse with Max he often brings up his vision of the Limo company, and one evening at the airport he meets a stunningly beautiful lawyer, Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith).
I:10719;1125;This is what Vincent's life philosophy boils down to as he brings Max on an existential journey.
I:10719;1126;When they enter the hospital Vincent reminds Max that his mother carried him in her uterus for nine months, and he must bring her flowers for which Vincent pays.
I:10719;1127;Collateral works in a similar manner as Seventh Seal.
I:10719;1128;michael Mann's Collateral is a solid cinematic experience that depicts serious philosophy through an action packed thriller.
I:10719;1129;The cast's performances provide genuine feel for who characters are, maybe the scene when Max pretends to be Vincent as he talks to Felix (Javier Bardem) is a little over the top, but it turns out to be one of those cool scenes where no one can get hurt.
I:10719;1130;The long opening before Max meets Vincent displays Mann's cunningness in direction as this provides a strong foundation that develops strong characters, which is needed for this story.
I:10719;1131;They all worked really well off of each other.
I:10719;1132;They're all really good actors and actress and I give this movie 5 thumbs up
I:10719;1133;But this opened my eyes to their great acting abilities.
I:10719;1134;The direction was great and the ending is perfect.
I:10719;1135;Collateral offers a gripping storyline, excellent acting and direction and a lot of edge.
I:10719;1136;Just from the moment Collateral started I was glued to the screen.
I:10719;1137;This film's taut atmoshpere, great dialogue, and great acting from Foxx and Cruise makes this an extremely watchable thriller.
I:10719;1138;I won't go into details, but this storyline is executed very well and doesn't get confusing or complicated at all like what happens with a lot of films of this nature.
I:10719;1139;like characters (Max a hard working man trying to make ends meet who values people and their company, Vincent a contract killer who values no one's life) made watching Foxx and Cruise on the screen a very interesting thing to watch.
I:10719;1140;Plus to see Cruise playing a character such as this was a breath of fresh air in his career in my opinion.
I:10719;1141;great thrills, a lot of excitement and some really great acting makes Collateral a film I would recommend.
I:10719;1142;This is Tom Cruise's best movie and performance of his career, and is also Jamie Foxx's best movie and performance of his career.
I:10719;1143;"Michael Mann's direction is brilliant and this is his best movie ever since ""Heat"" (1995)."
I:10719;1144;They are excellent and well motivated.
I:10719;1145;Stuart Beattie's story and screenplay is brilliant and well written and also well crafted.
I:10719;1146;The music by James Newton Howard is excellent and well synthesized.
I:10719;1147;There is also additional music by Antonio Pinto, Tom Rothrock and Zachary Koretz, which is also excellent and well synthesized.
I:10719;1148;The cinematography by Dion Beebe and Paul Cameron is brilliant and well shot.
I:10719;1149;The film editing by Jim Miller and Paul Rubell is excellent.
I:10719;1150;The casting by Francine Maisler is excellent.
I:10719;1151;"The production design by David Wasco (who production designed ""Kill Bill Volume 1"" (2003) and ""Kill Bill Volume 2"" (2004) is brilliant and well designed."
I:10719;1152;The art direction by Daniel T. Dorrance is brilliant and well crafted.
I:10719;1153;"wasco (who decorated the sets for ""Kill Bill Volume 1"" (2003) and ""Kill Bill Volume 2"" (2004) is brilliant and well decorated."
I:10719;1154;"The costume design by Jeffrey Kurland (who designed the costumes recently this year for ""Hidalgo"" (2004) is excellent."
I:10719;1155;up on Tom Cruise's Vincent is brilliant and at times, you can't hardly recognize that it is Tom Cruise.
I:10719;1156;This is a well crafted and well made movie with Oscar written all over it.
I:10719;1157;Tom Cruise (Best Actor), Jamie Foxx (Best Supporting Actor), Michael Mann (Best Director), Stuart Beattie (Best Original Screenplay), James Newton Howard (Best Original Score), Dion Beebe and Paul Cameron (Best Cinematography), and David Wasco (Sandy Reynolds.
I:10719;1158;wasco and Daniel T. Dorrance) (Best Art Direction .
I:10719;1159;This is an mesmerizing masterpiece.
I:10719;1160;Michael Mann has proved to be a consistently impressive source of film.
I:10719;1161;Manhunter, Last of the Mohicans, Heat and The Insider show him at his most versatile and entertaining and are modern classics in their own right.
I:10719;1162;office success and recognition he deserves.
I:10719;1163;Collateral, his latest project, made great strides in finally brining Mann to the forefront of modern cinematic directors.
I:10719;1164;Not only is it his most accessible film to date, it strongly showcases his greatest strength of creating an engaging storyline with engaging characters.
I:10719;1165;The two leads are perfectly cast, with Cruise going drastically against type as the remorseless Vincent and Foxx matching him stride for stride as the helpless Max.
I:10719;1166;the two share a unique, strained bond that makes their final showdown both inevitable and gripping.
I:10719;1167;Above it all, Mann's unmistakable flair for his craft shines through.
I:10719;1168;Thanks to the careful hand of Mann and the pitch perfect performances from Cruise and Foxx, it rises above the normal expectations of the genre and comes through as a fresh and original thrill ride.
I:10719;1169;It's truly one of the year's best.
I:10719;1170;are you entertained or not?
I:10719;1171;mann knows how to bring out the best in an actor.
I:10719;1172;like a great coach can see talent then let it run.
I:10719;1173;the movie kept my interest and i was entertained!
I:10719;1174;"One of the ways we get hooked into movies is the ""this could happen"" feeling."
I:10719;1175;up on the 405 or LA smog?Having said that, Cruise is brilliant as the intelligent hitman, and Foxx as the bright but procrastinating cabbie.
I:10719;1176;smith is absolutely gorgeous and plays a nice supporting role.
I:10719;1177;The photography nearly steals the show, very slick like the Miami Vice days and always present as both a scene setter and conversationalist.
I:10719;1178;kudos to Cruise and Foxx who do a nice morphing of the other's best characteristics, Vincent showing a hint of introspection and compassion at the end and Max more decisiveness.
I:10719;1179;paced, clever thriller that focuses on two men, a contract killer named Vincent, effectively played by a gray.
I:10719;1180;haired and grizzled Ton Cruise, and an everyman, a cabdriver with a dream named Max, played with appropriate resignation, intelligence, and angst by Jamie Foxx.
I:10719;1181;Of course, unbeknownst to Max, each of those quick stops is scheduled so that Vincent can dispatch someone to the great beyond.
I:10719;1182;while some of the moments in the film are seemingly incredible, if the viewer suspends disbelief and goes with the flow, all will be well.
I:10719;1183;Under Michael Mann's deft direction, the film stays taut and sharp, with Cruise and Foxx both turning in excellent performances.
I:10719;1184;Foxx can definitely run with the big boys.
I:10719;1185;Overall, this is an intriguing and compelling action thriller that will keep the viewer riveted to the screen.
I:10719;1186;The best twist was the final scene on the train when Max and Vincent emptied their guns through that glass door.
I:10719;1187;I had such an outstanding 'cruise' with Mr. Tom Cruise that I'll have to seem him in more movies.
I:10719;1188;I thought this movie was really good.
I:10719;1189;I didnt like the girl, but both jamie fox and tom cruise were really good in this movie.
I:10719;1190;I loved the part when he goes to the club and kills all the security guards, and then shoots fat charlie, or whatever his name was, the fat asian guy.
I:10719;1191;Overall it was a really good movie.
I:10719;1192;This movie was pretty cool, some funny lines in the cab and some wicked shootouts.
I:10719;1193;This pretty cool movie all of a sudden starts marching lockstep with the formula action movie ending you've already seen a million times.
I:10719;1194;This movie has real class, the photography, shot with the viper hi.
I:10719;1195;def camera, is amazing and adds a depth of escapism that I have only found elsewhere in Michael Mann's Miami Vice, shot with the same camera.
I:10719;1196;"tom Cruise is looking sharp in an all grey suit, tie and hair combo and brings an air of intensity and offbeat Tyler Durden style to his role, espousing the same ""live life in the moment and destroy all those pedestrian parts of yourself that hold you back"" philosophies in between murdering his targets in emphatic fashion."
I:10719;1197;The guy looks good, and carries the main drive of the movie, along with the photography and the music.
I:10719;1198;jamie Foxx does a great job of the supporting actor role, and the storyline is a tightly scripted realisation of a good concept: a foreign assassin turns up in LA to carry out five hits between sun.
I:10719;1199;"watch out for the completely unscripted and impromptu appearance of a wild dog strolling out in front of the car at a light (the camera just happened to be rolling), it's a special movie moment, and really captures the essence of ""being there"", witnessing life as it unfolds, and all that jazz."
I:10719;1200;Delivers on all the levels it attempts to, and possibly more.
I:10719;1201;Foxx is bribed into this with a cool 600 dollers and everything looks innocent enough until.
I:10719;1202;overall, the acting is very good (both Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx do a good job), but it's Jada Pinkett.
I:10719;1203;smith that really steals the show for me.
I:10719;1204;as for the plot, it is interesting, though not without flaws as the previous reviewer has very correctly pointed out.
I:10719;1205;credibility weakens the story considerably, even though Cruise is really good and believable as a hitman (truly vicious), and Foxx is equally as good in his role.
I:10719;1206;"it's interesting that the screenwriter chose not to do an American version of Kamikaze Taxi directly, but instead twist the plot somewhat to try to make it look original and, possibly, more ""American""."
I:10719;1207;the three stars here are for the performances by both Cruise and Foxx which are admittedly quite good.
I:10719;1208;Foxx, brilliantly cast, is funny at times, but he doesn't come off as trying too hard to be funny, which is what Will Smith is often guilty of.
I:10719;1209;Cruise, playing a villain for once, shows his dark side and turns in a more than convincing performance.
I:10719;1210;This movie, like other Michael Mann movies, relies on good dialogue.
I:10719;1211;There are extended scenes of just talking, but they are so well.
I:10719;1212;also of note, the scenery and cinematography of South Central Los Angeles is beautiful.
I:10719;1213;The more violent scenes are incredibly real, on the same level of being real that Saving Private Ryan was on.
I:10719;1214;This truly is one of the best movies that I ever saw.
I:10719;1215;Instead, I was rewarded with a real piece of cinematic genius, a character study of intriguing and odd personalities.
I:10719;1216;This is the night he will truly come alive.
I:10719;1217;vincent, on the other hand, came from a broken family.
I:10719;1218;He has to manage his environment, even Max.
I:10719;1219;He uses public transportation to keep his anonymity.
I:10719;1220;He's skilled, highly trained, ex.
I:10719;1221;every time I watch this movie, I discover something new.
I:10719;1222;And every time I watch, it delights me how cleverly directed and seamless the plot truly is.
I:10719;1223;Michael Mann succeeds in providing major details about his characters without intense exposition or flashbacks.
I:10719;1224;While some elements are a bit far fetched, it is a movie and an exciting one at that.
I:10719;1225;It's pretty amazing to see both Cruise and Fox carry a whole film.
I:10719;1226;Some cool cameos from Jada Pincket and Mark Ruffalo, as well.
I:10719;1227;This recent film is a thriller.
I:10719;1228;There's a good attempt at character development.
I:10719;1229;It's obvious that she's a person who he'd like to see again and is delighted when she leaves him her card.
I:10719;1230;all seems very sweet and normal and then things suddenly change.
I:10719;1231;That's when Tom Cruise, cast as a sophisticated hit man, gets into the cab.
I:10719;1232;But I did keep watching to the inevitable conclusion.
I:10719;1233;this is not a great film but it is entertaining.
I:10719;1234;I love Tom Cruise anything he stars is sure to be a hit.
I:10719;1235;This movie is full of action and suspense.
I:10719;1236;Until finally, he is stopped by our hero, who saves the girl.
I:10719;1237;Plenty of thrills, chills and spills, plausible action.
I:10719;1238;cruise was totally credible in his role.
I:10719;1239;Jamie Foxx gives a wonderful performance.
I:10719;1240;Overall the story line was entertaining, if not somewhat predictable.
I:10719;1241;The extras and film make for an evening of good entertainment.
I:10719;1242;His remarks are intelligent and show to what degree of professionalism he and his actors were committed.
I:10719;1243;tom Cruise is an actor that has surprised me over and over.
I:10719;1244;He is a master of his art.
I:10719;1245;Not only that, he prepares each character in a complete and perfect way.
I:10719;1246;jamie Foxx shows a wide range of expression in this movie and I expect him to offer us some serious performances in the future.
I:10719;1247;For some reason, comedians are very good in dramatic roles.
I:10719;1248;It will stick in your mind.
I:10719;1249;I love the types of movies that keep me on the edge of my seat throughout, and this one definitely did.
I:10719;1250;There are so many twists and turns throughout the movie that it'll make you dizzy!Cruise was good as the bad.
I:10719;1251;ass hitman Vincent (not his best acting job though) and I absolutely loved Jamie Foxx's portrayal of the honest cabbie Max.
I:10719;1252;This is an action movie, but it is also a great story.
I:10719;1253;tom Cruise does a fantastic job as Vincent, the contract hit man.
I:10719;1254;He pulls off this character with the skill and confidence of a great actor.
I:10719;1255;In addition, he must have had some excellent technical trainers, because he displays some outstanding combat shooting techniques.
I:10719;1256;His confrontation with the two goblins in the alley who had just robbed Jamie Fox is worth replaying a couple of times on slow motion.
I:10719;1257;jamie Fox also shines as the Taxi driver.
I:10719;1258;His transformation through the movie kept my interest going until the end.
I:10719;1259;Go now, break in if you don't have cash, hijack the damn theatre if you absolutely have to.
I:10719;1260;How I know this is because of Michael Mann, director of Manhunter, The Insider, Heat, Ali and of the most classic of Miami Vice episodes.
I:10719;1261;He is considered one of the best innovative filmmakers of all time in terms of cinematography, if not the best.
I:10719;1262;You are frightened, intrigued, and ultimately riveted by every solitary second that Cruise is on screen.
I:10719;1263;The only way possible to explain it is that he has an aura about him that is rarely captured on film, and whether that's credit to Mann or Cruise or both is totally up to debate.
I:10719;1264;jamie Foxx is likewise excellent.
I:10719;1265;There is a vulnerability throughout the film just by Foxx's eyes that you are entranced by and can't help but hope that he'll make it out of here.
I:10719;1266;This is the film that will launch Foxx's dramatic career.
I:10719;1267;the secondary cast does not have much of a role, but what we do see is superb.
I:10719;1268;Mark Ruffalo is a narc officer and we are always hoping that eventually he will catch up.
I:10719;1269;He is also a driven, but understated character and his few scenes do shine, in that underworld grit sort of way.
I:10719;1270;Peter Berg is his supervising officer, and having always liked Berg, he reminds me why I keep track of his career.
I:10719;1271;it's been about half an hour after watching this film, and my heart is still pumping.
I:10719;1272;This movie does a wonderful job in setting locale.
I:10719;1273;It hums with the moody power of Los Angeles.
I:10719;1274;Before ten minutes have gone by, you will feel as though you are right in LA, practically smelling the summer.
I:10719;1275;It's the best depiction of a large Western city since Chinatown (LA in a prior age) and Vertigo (San Francisco).
I:10719;1276;And the action concludes with, of all things, an all.
I:10719;1277;chase through the cars of a subway train in a sequence designed to manufacture tension and wake us up, rather than engage our interest by revealing something really interesting about either or both of these guys.
I:10719;1278;He seems to think he can compete with great movie good.
I:10719;1279;"time favorite movies directed by Mann (""Heat"" and ""The Insider""), and having Cruise as one of my favorite actors, I couldn't resist the temptation to check out ""Collateral""."
I:10719;1280;as Mann has us used to, he has you on the edge of your seat all through the movie, with some fantastic dialog and some great directing and photography, something that has made him legendary by now, with his unique treatment of light and shadows.
I:10719;1281;as for Cruise and his interaction on the screen with Foxx, it's a perfect match.
I:10719;1282;"As for Foxx (""Ali"", ""Any Given Sunday""), he too does a fine job, consolidating him along with Will Smith as the top talent in a solid new generation of african americans following the lead of Denzel Washington."
I:10719;1283;all in all, one solid blend of tasteful directing, great camerawork, engaging dialogs and acting, and tying it all together in the background, an eclectic soundtrack combining the musical talent of James Newton Howard.
I:10719;1284;This was a great Movie, lots of action and smart scenes made Collateral a very enjoyable movie.
I:10719;1285;good performances from all main actors.
I:10719;1286;Tom Cruise is good in this movie and his role as a hit.
I:10719;1287;he is convincing as a ruthless killer.
I:10719;1288;Jamie Foxx is REAL good in this movie and in a few scenes he shows the acting ability that took him from playing comic roles to his show.
I:10719;1289;but as he realizes his very life depends on his ability to seem a callous assassin he undergoes a remarkable transformation in a few moments.
I:10719;1290;Foxx steals this scene: the best in the movie.
I:10719;1291;The first hour and fifteen minutes are good and compel you to the ending, but once you arrive there a few formulas kick in.
I:10719;1292;"When Foxx is forced to accompany the killer I was reminded of Ethan Hawke as Denzel Washington's ""good cop"" partner in ""Training Day""."
I:10719;1293;Collateral makes it look like a good boxing punch.
I:10719;1294;"Still, worth seeing, and Foxx probably deserves a ""Best Supporting Actor"" nomination for this film as well as ""Best Actor"" for ""Ray""."
I:10719;1295;In fact, all the actors deserve kudos for what was a great series of performances.
I:10719;1296;based primarily on dialogue, the screenplay is a good variation on the hit.
I:10719;1297;I say this movie is worth seeing, though it starts off a little slow.
I:10719;1298;Collateral proves that there are many great actors out there who have yet to show how well they can shine given a great script.
I:10719;1299;But the plot isn't what makes this movie great, it's the characters, their intelligence, and relationships to one another.
I:10719;1300;Collateral shows exactly how wide a range he has as an actor.
I:10719;1301;And Tom Cruise as a serious villain is perfection.
I:10719;1302;The deep character of Vincent plays to all of Cruise's strengths as an actor and adds magnificently to the movie.
I:10719;1303;for a great drama, with very good acting, writing, and a few edge.
I:10719;1304;This is probably the best Tom Cruise movie ever!!!
I:10719;1305;Collateral isn't just one of the best thrillers of the year, it's one of the best American movies of the year.
I:10719;1306;Collateral reaffirms my belief that a great action film isn't just about great action, it's also about great characters, which comes from great screenwriting and great acting.
I:10719;1307;Vincent and Max get to know each other a little better, and the audience gets to know the characters better, thus allowing a greater involvement in this deadly cat and mouse game.
I:10719;1308;"in a way, ""Collateral"" is an `homage' to the great Alfred Hitchcock, whose persistent theme was that of an innocent man's being caught up in a web woven by a villain."
I:10719;1309;Director Michael Mann, though, takes the genre and creates something uniquely his own .
I:10719;1310;a masterful thriller in its own right.
I:10719;1311;Michael Mann gives us another good film.
I:10719;1312;This time, he really uses the actors to convey a great movie.
I:10719;1313;Moving away from his regular type.
I:10719;1314;Max gives in and takes Vincent for a spin.
I:10719;1315;They start off with good conversation and seem to have a friendship starting.
I:10719;1316;He realizes that Vincent caused the falling body, and now, he knows what he is dealing with.
I:10719;1317;For the sake of his own life, he continues to drive Vincent.
I:10719;1318;This leads to a high speed chase on foot that is a race against the clock and Vincent.
I:10719;1319;this movie is really good.
I:10719;1320;He still has his smile, but it even looks sinister.
I:10719;1321;It may be his best performance since the film Magnolia.
I:10719;1322;jamie Foxx is also very good.
I:10719;1323;Most of the film works on the two main character interacting with each other.
I:10719;1324;Foxx is able to display his emotions to the point.
I:10719;1325;I thought he was good in Any Given Sunday, but here, you know that he can really do more than comedy.
I:10719;1326;collateral really does grip the audience.
I:10719;1327;You cheer for both characters.
I:10719;1328;That's a good thing because he gives a great performance.
I:10719;1329;He does it for a living.
I:10719;1330;In all Micheal Mann's movies there are alway's awesome plot's, plot twists and performances.
I:10719;1331;I know Jamie Foxx who is always good, and Mark Ruffalo will put on good perfomances.
I:10719;1332;"Director Michael Mann has authored many interesting, even if not outstanding, films as ""The Keep"" (1983), ""The Last of the Mohicans"" (1992) and ""Ali"" (2001)."
I:10719;1333;it is an interesting and quite fast paced action movie.
I:10719;1334;surprisingly the best actor's performance is given by Jamie Foxx as Max the taxi driver.
I:10719;1335;"He confirms what he started to show in ""Ali"", working under the same director."
I:10719;1336;the action scenes are very well filmed and adrenalin charged.
I:10719;1337;Yet, the real secret to a great film is that something essential about it must be anchored to an aspect of reality.
I:10719;1338;"The very essential premise
I:10719;1339;secondly, all the key witnesses to this hugely important trial are simply available for the killing.
I:10719;1340;"Is this really the director that brought us that crime masterpiece, ""Heat""?"
I:10719;1341;This movie at first glance is very cool.
I:10719;1342;After you watch it, it holds a terrible emptiness.
I:10719;1343;The comic relief was great!
I:10719;1344;L. a. at night was a perfect setting, peaceful yet decietful.
I:10719;1345;He picks up a few wacky people, and then we meet Foxx's love interest.
I:10719;1346;The comical relief is classic in this movie, and basically saves it.
I:10719;1347;I really liked this movie a lot for awhile.
I:10719;1348;It was really kind of unique for awhile there.
I:10719;1349;All of a sudden Tom Cruise is leaping onto moving subway trains after having been shot in the face.
I:10719;1350;Oh, and the hero saves the day at the last second and gets the girl.
I:10719;1351;Let's see more of that.
I:10719;1352;It was a thrill to behold.
I:10719;1353;Vincent is an assassin, and even though he is bad, is a likable guy.
I:10719;1354;Jamie Foxx was marvelous as well, and makes you really feel for Max, his character.
I:10719;1355;This movie is a must see, trust me on this one.
I:10719;1356;will probably have to see it again sometime to see what I missed.
I:10719;1357;At seven dollars this movie is a steal.
I:10719;1358;Michael Mann is a meticulous filmmaker and he has done great work creating a sleek, economical thriller.
I:10719;1359;Tom Cruise is crisp and kinetic as the incisive and very efficient hitman Vincent.
I:10719;1360;The character of Jada Pinkett Smith is something of a device, though she makes the most of her time on screen.
I:10719;1361;There is a scene between her and Foxx at the beginning of the film that has a really great vibe.
I:10719;1362;The dialog throughout is smart, tight and at times darkly funny.
I:10719;1363;As many reviews have pointed out, the cinematography is striking.
I:10719;1364;Mann has a keen ear and an uncanny knack for marrying music and imagery on film, and I so liked the soundtrack to this movie that I bought it (a first for me).
I:10719;1365;The bonus features are very good and a director's cut would have been icing on the cake.
I:10719;1366;Worth it at twice the price.
I:10719;1367;studio Hollywood movies go, this is a worthy movie delivered in a subtly slick fashion, wrapped around a good heart .
I:10719;1368;It's a rather straightforward, simple movie that goes easily on a linear path from point A to point B.
I:10719;1369;But as it is, it's a nice.
I:10719;1370;good movie colored with dark blue hew of night.
I:10719;1371;type movies as great films.
I:10719;1372;Collateral is a beautiful film: vibrating with gorgeous digital.
I:10719;1373;"And like director Michael Mann's previous ""Heat,"" ""Collateral"" is a visual tribute to Los Angeles."
I:10719;1374;"But ""Collateral"" is also a tribute to the acting talent of Tom Cruise who doesn't seem to get all the credit he is due: for example his excellent work in ""Samurai"" went virtually un."
I:10719;1375;michael Mann has directed with a keen eye and a jaundiced view of what makes Los Angeles, Los Angeles: the City of the Angels, the final frontier of last chances, every inch the Wild Wild West where everything is cool as long as you wear the right clothes, have the right haircut and drive the hottest car.
I:10719;1376;I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
I:10719;1377;"All of them are highly likeable characters, even Cruise who plays a hitman who appears unfeeling to his ""victims,"" while being ""caring"" to others, especially Foxx."
I:10719;1378;I really enjoyed this film, despite the idea of a hitman taking a cab to his assignments.
I:10719;1379;I thought Tom Cruise was excellent as Vincent the hitman and thought it was a nice departure from his usual roles.
I:10719;1380;The cinemaphotography reminded me of the old miami vice series and I thought it worked well with the story.
I:10719;1381;The story moved quickly and had humor and seriousness interlaced through it.
I:10719;1382;Michael Mann returns with this edgy masterwork of a movie about an ordinary taxi driver who gets caught into the world of a contract killer.
I:10719;1383;A nicely done character study with the two stars giving one of their best and believe me Foxx gives it all his best and when is Cruise ever dull as a villain?
I:10719;1384;Lots of action and excitment especially the scenes when Cruise shoots someone.
I:10719;1385;A fast ride worth taking.
I:10719;1386;One of the best movies of the year.
I:10719;1387;Michael Mann's direction is solid and intriguing in this unusual crime thriller.
I:10719;1388;His 80s' MTV style resonates even in this new millenium, and he manages to combine his trademark action elements with satisfying performances from his two leads.
I:10719;1389;"In COLLATERAL, he is obviously acting
I:10719;1390;good and solid, but his nomination for supporting actor leaves me wondering if this performance deserved that accolade, particularly in light of his shooin for Best Actor.
I:10719;1391;His hair sleek and silver, behind those Raybans, Cruise oozes menace and is one of his most interesting performances.
I:10719;1392;I had a hard time believing a cabbie could change so quickly and outsmart a suave professional hit man, but cinematic rules dictated this heroic twist.
I:10719;1393;"Jada Pinkett Smith is cool in a small but pivotal role
I:10719;1394;cOLLATERAL works on many levels and I enjoyed it, although its rather despondent ending only reinforces Cruise's assertation that death is so common in LA that one might not even notice someone is dead.
I:10719;1395;The scenes are done remarkably well.
I:10719;1396;the creators of the movie did a remarkably good job in character development in the beginning of the movie.
I:10719;1397;overall, a fairly well done movie.
I:10719;1398;"don't be put off by your dislike for Cruise, this is one great film, and director Michael Mann once again makes Los Angeles come alive, just like in his other film ""Heat"" Los Angeles becomes a charater here too, the city never looked better at night."
I:10719;1399;There's something about his films, something that catches the certain spirit or aspect of a time period or a culture, or even a city.
I:10719;1400;In 'Manhunter', Mann follows Will Graham in an 80's fused film loaded with a memorable, hand picked soundtrack with the likes of Prime Movers or Iron Butterfly.
I:10719;1401;vincent is the type of guy at the airport you glance at and that's it.
I:10719;1402;Vincent is a contracted killer and he's very, very good at it.
I:10719;1403;In fact, this is his life.
I:10719;1404;as in any Mann film, the acting and realism is top notch.
I:10719;1405;cruise and Foxx work brilliantly.
I:10719;1406;What I do know, is that this combination works, and it shows.
I:10719;1407;Both Foxx and Cruise give astonishing peformances.
I:10719;1408;As do Mark Ruffalo, of whom makes a minor role, and the breathtaking Jada Pinkett Smith, who I find to be one of Hollywood's attractive and better actresses.
I:10719;1409;I was glad The Roots also took a part in the beginning, and I also loved the instrumental scores.
I:10719;1410;the film, at least for me, works very well.
I:10719;1411;It's never too choppy, the shots are fantastic, the story works well, and the dialogue is terrific.
I:10719;1412;There are even a few laughs in here.
I:10719;1413;Everything blends well and I think it's all to owe to the amazing cast, beautiful direction, and the simplistic but well produced screenplay by Stuart Beattie.
I:10719;1414;I'd say this is the summer's best so far.
I:10719;1415;I am not a big Tom Cruise fan but he is very good in this thriller and semi.
I:10719;1416;I had actually owned the movie for a while without watching it and was surprised at how good it is.
I:10719;1417;Foxx is the better of the two and does a great job as a low key cab driver who has his dreams but little chance of seeing them happen.
I:10719;1418;This fits the character well.
I:10719;1419;it is well done and enjoyable.
I:10719;1420;Vincent's domineering, confident attitude is enough for the most part to keep Max in line.
I:10719;1421;"i was pleasantly surprised by ""Collateral""."
I:10719;1422;heavy, the action scenes are very effective.
I:10719;1423;The more pervasive interactions between Max and Vincent are gripping at times, as a strange relationship forms between the two.
I:10719;1424;Cruise's Vincent is a bit of a departure for him, but he fills Vincent's shoes convincingly.
I:10719;1425;Foxx as Max is equally effective as his character gradually develops some strength of character.
I:10719;1426;This is a gem in the doldrums of the August box office.
I:10719;1427;He did a great job and that was scary.
I:10719;1428;"Jamie Foxx's acting was also great as the ""what the heck have I gotten myself into"" cabbie!"
I:10719;1429;The acting is what made this movie great.
I:10719;1430;The bad guy gets shot in the face/neck then hops back up to resume the chase and perform such feats as leaping onto a moving train.
I:10719;1431;Fast because time does fly when you're having fun.
I:10719;1432;I viewed the film both as per usual as well as with the Directors Commentary Feature.
I:10719;1433;He is smooth, charming, slick and graceful and he makes things he does that are disgraceful seem like a loaded barrel full of fun.
I:10719;1434;There are many stand out moments and entire scenes that become a poignant memory.
I:10719;1435;Michael Mann, who directs this beautiful motion picture manages to capture essences of Los Angeles and Urban Life like Peter Parker catches photographs of Spiderman.
I:10719;1436;No one captures spider better than spider can.
I:10719;1437;And this film captures those so many subtle threads of Corporate Reality and the Pursuit of Happiness.
I:10719;1438;"Director Michael Mann does what he does best with ""Collateral"", a well."
I:10719;1439;written (by Stuart Beattie), entertaining thriller that knows just when to be intense and when to be mellow.
I:10719;1440;This makes the bursts of action more intense and surprising.
I:10719;1441;Cruise has nothing to lose by playing unlikable characters, and they will among his most memorable work.
I:10719;1442;possession lends him great presence and charm, while his moral bankruptcy makes him revolting.
I:10719;1443;Cruise is perfect for the role.
I:10719;1444;"Great cast, great dialogue, and perfect pacing make ""Collateral"" an engaging, character."
I:10719;1445;driven thriller that almost everyone will enjoy.
I:10719;1446;Jamie Foxx&Tom Crusie have real good chemistry in this film that feels sometimes like a virtual Reality film in spots.
I:10719;1447;michael Mann does a Good job here with the pacing after a while.
I:10719;1448;He was on Point in all his works last year.
I:10719;1449;The movie was very well done except for the ending.
I:10719;1450;of course the good guy wins and walks away with the girl.
I:10719;1451;all in all a brilliant movie worth watching.
I:10719;1452;Yet it is not, and that is one of the great aspects of this movie.
I:10719;1453;Both are given the power to change their life, but the story is really whether one will.
I:10719;1454;This gives the movie a more distinctive feel, while the great music overtones Cruise's and Foxx's characters life with mellow serenity.
I:10719;1455;That is because this is a more intelligently done action film, with great characters, cinematography, and a beautiful score.
I:10719;1456;I feel that Collateral is definitely deserved of some Oscars.
I:10719;1457;I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked this movie.
I:10719;1458;It was refreshing to see Tom Cruise play bad guy, and Jamie Foxx is terrific as a cabdriver caught in the middle of his scheme.
I:10719;1459;the movie takes place over less than 10 hours, and as a result has a very high.
I:10719;1460;You find yourself viewing the story from the perspective of Jamie Foxx's character, and I certainly wondered quite a few times what I might do if I was in the same situation.
I:10719;1461;Cruise and Foxx are excellent, and once the story picks up you are completely engrossed through the conclusion.
I:10719;1462;It being one of my husband's favorites movies, I bought it for him as a Christmas present.
I:10719;1463;He was so excited .
I:10719;1464;I got my money's worth with Collateral.
I:10719;1465;cruise is a great villain, ruthless and human in the space of the same second.
I:10719;1466;The interaction between him and Foxx is worth seeing as they ride around in a taxi, unseen and unremembered.
I:10719;1467;an upcoming actor who is worth seeing is Mark Ruffalo.
I:10719;1468;in unrated territory with In the Cut, to be back in the role of the tough, good.
I:10719;1469;the bulk of the movie is driven by tension and suspense in the build up to the climactical cat.
I:10719;1470;This sense of building tension is accentuated by the innovative use of an orchestral soundtrack, making for an interesting musical background.
I:10719;1471;"One thing that pleased me is that ""Collateral"" is slightly more intelligent in nature than a lot of action movies, and thus is not readily predictable."
I:10719;1472;the choices in setting and cinematography are interesting, and effective.
I:10719;1473;"Much of the movie has a bit of a ""Phone Booth""."
I:10719;1474;And it is not JUST an action movie, either, but has an emotional element that allows one to connect with the main characters to a higher degree.
I:10719;1475;Director Michael Mann has also made creative choices in where and how the various scenes were shot, enhancing the film's impact.
I:10719;1476;"You can gain a particular appreciation for his skill and eye for detail by watching the featurettes ""City of Night"" and ""Visual FX"" on the second disc."
I:10719;1477;the acting was competent all around.
I:10719;1478;Jamie Foxx is particularly good as the hero in the film.
I:10719;1479;It was interesting to see Tom Cruise as a villain.
I:10719;1480;While quite entertaining on a first.
I:10719;1481;time viewing, it primarily holds the audience's attention via suspense, and once you know what happens, there isn't much else to dig into on subsequent viewings.
I:10719;1482;City of Night is a longer featurette on the making of the film, which provides interesting insights on Mann's various filmmaking choices.
I:10719;1483;Shooting on Location takes you into the cinematography of the film.
I:10719;1484;Visual FX is a particularly interesting segment on the movie's cinematography.
I:10719;1485;It isn't one I'd add to my personal collection, but it was an enjoyable viewing experience.
I:10719;1486;Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx are outstanding!
I:10719;1487;Without a doubt Tom Cruise will be nominated and most likely win the best actor Oscar (Denzel got one for a much more basic bad.
I:10719;1488;Foxx should at least get nominated for a supporting role, because he proves to everyone that he can hold his own with Cruise.
I:10719;1489;The plot is a little thin and predictable at times, but the dialogue is written very well and the direction is tight.
I:10719;1490;The realism of the film adds much more depth and some of the time I completely forgot I was watching a hollywood made movie.
I:10719;1491;Kudos to all involved and thanks Micheal Mann for reviving the thriller/suspense genre in such a stylish way.
I:10719;1492;This thriller was a wicked ride of suspense, action and everything else!
I:10719;1493;From start to finish it was awesome, especially the heart.
I:10719;1494;Great movie with Mr. Cruise and Mr. Foxx.
I:10719;1495;Both are excellent actors and the film keeps you moving.
I:10719;1496;Tom Cruise is a hit man.
I:10719;1497;Cruise tells Foxx that he has a lot of stops and will use him all night.
I:10719;1498;So it's Jamie to the rescue.
I:10719;1499;He gives a very good performance until the end when not even Tom can over come the mess.
I:10719;1500;jamie Foxx is given a serious character and for the first half of the film Foxx is amazing but about half way through he pulls out his safe standard Jamie Foxx character.
I:10719;1501;I saw this film a few years ago and decided to give it another look.
I:10719;1502;The film is well paced and builds slowly to an intense climax.
I:10719;1503;Fox and Pickett should also be commended for turning in believable performances under crazy situations.
I:10719;1504;"When you get down to the meat of the story ""collateral,"" is an engaging more unique than most ride."
I:10719;1505;the screenplay is a gem and the movies real strength is the sense of characterization you get from Jamie Foxx (playing cab driver Max) and Tom Cruise (ruthless and smooth hit man Vincent).
I:10719;1506;layered people that you get to know on a more intimate basis and oddly enough especially in the case of Cruise care about.
I:10719;1507;there are moments that leave you laughing as the screenwriter shoots for irony and humor amidst the chaos and violence.
I:10719;1508;Certainly not a brilliant movie or a best of category but well worth the watching and well worth the ride.
I:10719;1509;Cruise turns over a new leaf as evil killer and Jamie Foxx is just beginning to reveal his true talent.
I:10719;1510;smith, as prosecuting lawyer, is extremely easy on the eyes as always.
I:10719;1511;For most of it's two hour running time, Collateral combines both an intricate character study and some intense action set pieces that make it a joy to watch, beginning with cool, calm, and calculated hitman Vincent (Cruise) hitching a ride with taxi driver Max (Foxx).
I:10719;1512;Max has big dreams and grand ideas and little to show for it, something Vincent uses to his advantage as he takes Max hostage to make his rounds of the night which include the executions of five people.
I:10719;1513;The interplay between Cruise and Foxx is undoubtadly Collateral's strong point, with Foxx giving a knockout performance and Cruise's surprising performance as one of the best screen villains in the past few years.
I:10719;1514;Other than that, everything else about Collateral is nearly flawless, and it is definitely one of the best films to be released this year.
I:10719;1515;The cast also features Jada Pinkett.
I:10719;1516;"Beautifully shot and directed, this tour de force features stellar performances by both Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx (should have gotten a ""Best Actor"" nom."
I:10719;1517;it's 50/50 with Cruise, who also does some of his best work to date).
I:10719;1518;novel concept, smartly adapted and interpreted.
I:10719;1519;Fantastic supporting cast led by Pinkett Smith and Ruffalo.
I:10719;1520;So much care and attention went into the detail of this film that it is a pleasure to watch and gripping from beginning to end.
I:10719;1521;Kudoes to Cruise, Foxx, Mann and Beattie on a wonderful work.
I:10719;1522;With its meditative aerial views of downtown street grids and rich digital.
I:10719;1523;"video cinematography that unites sparkle and grime into a kind of seedy nocturnal poetry, ""Collateral"" is one of the best."
I:10719;1524;"It could be a corollary to another modern noir and Mann's best film, the epic crime story ""Heat"" ."
I:10719;1525;"Joining them are Jada Pinkett Smith (The ""Matrix"" films), Mark Ruffalo (""13 Going on 30""), Peter Berg (""Cop Land""), and Bruce McGill (""Runaway Jury"") in which they gave great performances as well."
I:10719;1526;trafficking trial set to start the next morning.
I:10719;1527;Appealing supporting players Mark Ruffalo and Jada Pinkett Smith are fine, if perhaps underused.
I:10719;1528;But the real attraction here is Tom Cruise, and for a director who has worked with such high.
I:10719;1529;wattage actors as Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Russell Crowe, Daniel Day.
I:10719;1530;Cruise's Vincent certainly makes for a compelling visual, his silver hair and gray stubble matching his shiny, shark.
I:10719;1531;colored suit to form the image of a hit man as walking handgun.
I:10719;1532;His line readings are so practice.
I:10719;1533;perfect that Vincent could be as easily be a Cruise hero from any of the actor's other action movies.
I:10719;1534;"in conclusion, ""Collateral"" has the makings of a gritty, action."
I:10719;1535;packed thriller with suspense at every twist and turn.
I:10719;1536;But luckily for us, Michael Mann gives it enough soul and visual verve to make it worth seeing, which is a not.
I:10719;1537;Very well done, Jamie Foxx plays an almost obsessive taxi driver and delivers perfectly.
I:10719;1538;What I really liked about this movie was the characterization throughout it and how Cruise and Foxx both developed and changed throughout it.
I:10719;1539;Its very professional and you can tell the movie wasnt made just to make money, but to send an important message to the viewers instead.
I:10719;1540;This was a really good movie and it was all thanks to Jamie Foxx, he stole this show 100% and left Tom Cruise looking confused and gray haired in the background.
I:10719;1541;Highly recommended, fresh screenplay, stylish direction and a solid even pacing make this one a keeper.
I:10719;1542;Both Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise deserved Best Actor nominations for this movie, Michael Mann deserved Best Director, and this should have been nominated for Best Cinematography and Best Film.
I:10719;1543;Jamie Foxx is a lead in this movie and was actually nominated for Best Supporting Actor, not sure what is with that.
I:10719;1544;But Tom plays a human, not a machine, and truly deserves Best Actor for his performance.
I:10719;1545;In the Director's commentary, Michael Mann waxes eloquently on the digital camera photography and the artsy visual poetry is in the beautiful night scenes of Los Angeles.
I:10719;1546;The cinematography is so beautiful that it can almost be enjoyed by itself with the sound off.
I:10719;1547;"There's clever camera work like the ""falling camera"" shown just before the body hits the top of the taxi."
I:10719;1548;"is one of the best movie lines of all time: ""No, I shot him."
I:10719;1549;Quite simply, this is not only the best movie of 2004 but one of the best movies of all time.
I:10719;1550;The final sequence in this movie transforms it from a cool Mann crime movie into a dumb action movie.
I:10719;1551;This movie starts off to be a really cool, thoughtful, interesting movie.
I:10719;1552;The film's noir atmosphere is beautiful and the plot is entertaining throughout.
I:10719;1553;The actors all hit their parts perfectly.
I:10719;1554;"He blows away all his ""targets"" with style and panache."
I:10719;1555;vincent shoots people and then, shoots more people.
I:10719;1556;I really loved the way he put down the scumbag punks in the alley.
I:10719;1557;"I bought ""Collateral"" for one of my sons for a Christmas present."
I:10719;1558;He really liked the movie so did I.
I:10719;1559;If you like Tom Cruise's acting, see the movie.
I:10719;1560;If you like Jamie Foxx's acting, see the movie.
I:10719;1561;Great direction and great score.
I:10719;1562;"There is a bit of ""street philosophy"" between the two main characters, Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx, that I found actually quite important to me and have thought about as reference points repeatedly since seeing this movie."
I:10719;1563;Usually it's a visually striking image that grabs the eye into entertainment enlightenment, but this scene has both visual and audio impact.
I:10719;1564;So I watched this full scale assault of a scene again and again because it was so well done.
I:10719;1565;There is another shocker of a scene (a hit) that is so up close, intimately personal, and it incorporates a violent change of mood, emotion and human connection that adds a kind of heart felt pathos that may only be matched again by the end of the movie on the rail car.
I:10719;1566;I don't know about actors, directors and such but it is a good action movie.
I:10719;1567;Just good acting and story.
I:10719;1568;One of the first All Night Digitally shot movies in hollywood history, great story line, fine acting, worth watching over every now and then.
I:10719;1569;Jamie and Tom are great together.
I:10719;1570;He's really good in Collateral.
I:10719;1571;anyway, it's a terrific shoot.
I:10719;1572;up film, if you like this sort of thing.
I:10719;1573;We should start stopping to create films with such a deep meaningand such an outrageous end.
I:10719;1574;but, because of Tom Cruise character and the story behind, Yes, I LIKE THE FILM!
I:10719;1575;, but I'd imagine most people would prefer something that respects its audience's intelligence a little more, regardless of race, color or creed.
I:10719;1576;His characters are always so REAL, and rich.
I:10719;1577;They seemed so real to me.
I:10719;1578;"Jamie Foxx almost stole the movie though with his best performance to date, with the possible exception of ""Ray."""
I:10719;1579;"I loved everything about this movie, and his performance, particularly when he went to meet up with bad guy ""Felix."""
I:10719;1580;It's one you will want to watch over and over again.
I:10719;1581;Great movie with Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx giving top notch performances, I think Foxx either won an Oscar or was nominated for one.
I:10719;1582;a film destined to become a classic of its genre!
I:10719;1583;The film is hip and funky .
I:10719;1584;a film brilliantly portraying LA as it is!
I:10719;1585;But aside from my geographic musings, I very much enjoyed this film.
I:10719;1586;Each showed a sense of experience in their backgrounds while offering a great insight into one another's lives.
I:10719;1587;Though the action is minimal in comparison to many, many other thrillers, it's the interaction between these two men that will keep you at the edge of your seat.
I:10719;1588;obviously, that's the movie i love, and i got it with a really good price.
I:10719;1589;cruise plays a heartless hitman, and does a believable job at it.
I:10719;1590;anyway, I found the movie quite enjoyable.
I:10719;1591;It's a simple plot, so one should know that going in, but it kept my attention better than most.
I:10719;1592;Beautifully shot and artfully polysemic, Collateral is an enjoyable and expertly crafted film.
I:10719;1593;Although it has the dressings of an action thriller, it is more of a sensitive character study.
I:10719;1594;Listening to and watching their interactions with each other is endlessly entertaining.
I:10719;1595;This relationship is the core of the movie and is handled masterfully.
I:10719;1596;the city of Los Angeles, where the film is set, is another important character.
I:10719;1597;Mann deftly captures the feel of the city, using tasteful overhead shots to provide a sense of location.
I:10719;1598;fINAL SAY:An intelligent, meaningful character study that is only slightly marred by minor flaws.
I:10719;1599;Outstanding job, non stop, intense story.
I:10719;1600;I'm a huge fan of most of Michael Mann's work.
I:10719;1601;I actually think Tom Cruise is a very talented actor, and Jamie Foxx delivers a nice performance as well.
I:10719;1602;The film is shot in high definition, and you can really tell it when the downtown LA night line is in the background.
I:10719;1603;It is very interesting to see him play a bad guy, and a very bad guy at that, and he infuses the role with genuine menace and unpredictability.
I:10719;1604;Jamie Fox is also excellent.
I:10719;1605;Well worth watching, as many Michael Mann movies are.
I:10719;1606;I thought this was very good, certainly good for a night's entertainment.
I:10719;1607;Michael Mann has filmed a good nail biter with Collateral.
I:10719;1608;the big surprise in Collateral is Jamie Foxx.
I:10719;1609;Humans are but grains of sand on a universal beach according to Cruise.
I:10719;1610;From the rooftops LA is beautiful but meaningless.
I:10719;1611;hitchcock vision of so many films today.
I:10719;1612;"Yet, when he picks up a sophisticated lady lawyer, he charms her with his quick wit and knowledge
I:10719;1613;mannered, passive type of person.
I:10719;1614;This movie is awesome, Tom Cruise's best!
I:10719;1615;The special features disk is equally as interesting.
I:10719;1616;"The Next Fare May Be Your Last,"" or ""Blonds DO HAVE more fun,"" in reference to Cruise's hair in the film."
I:10719;1617;"Hitchcock in ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" and ""North by Northwest"" did the aspect of the innocent man drawn into a world of intrigue and crime."
I:10719;1618;"Mann casts Foxx as the innocent and the director draws brilliant performances from both actors as they ""play"" off each other like old friends."
I:10719;1619;also, Mann, like Alfred, understands how the look is essential to the success of the film.
I:10719;1620;The movie's setting, Los Angeles, takes on a part of its own, simultaneously looking both menacing and captivating.
I:10719;1621;the score by James Newton Howard, as well as the use of popular songs, is another fine element that Mann incorporates in this engaging thriller.
I:10719;1622;"the second disc features a fascinating ""Making of."""
I:10719;1623;depth look at the very meticulous Mr. Mann.
I:10719;1624;"Maybe, they can do a remake of ""North by Northwest"", with Cruise in the James Mason role, Foxx as Cary Grant's character, and Pinkett."
I:10719;1625;hey, it's just a thought!
I:10719;1626;One of the best films of the year, and a certain bold move by Tom Cruise, the real star of this vehicle is Jamie Foxx.
I:10719;1627;Tom Cruise is great as a villain, an assassin who has an agenda and is relentless in his pursuits.
I:10719;1628;This film has it all.
I:10719;1629;Great direction from Micheal Mann, and a moving score.
I:10719;1630;Great action and some comedy too.
I:10719;1631;This is one of my favorite movies and whenever I watch it I'm always completely immersed in it.
I:10719;1632;Tom Cruise gave an outstanding performance as Vincent, and Jamie Foxx surprised me as well.
I:10719;1633;This movie is an incredible thriller with amazing dialogue and story.
I:10719;1634;Michael Mann did a great job with his work on this.
I:10719;1635;The disc contains a nice amount of extras: There's a deleted scene, the enlightening directors commentary, a few making of's, and some other things.
I:10719;1636;This is a real sleeper.
I:10719;1637;This isn't the best movie of 2004, but it's quite good.
I:10719;1638;The reasons behind this night of bloodshed are artfully revealed as the film proceeds, with clues neatly interspersed.
I:10719;1639;"despite the ending, however, ""Collateral"" is well worth your time."
I:10719;1640;Greed has become the American way.
I:10719;1641;so you see, this isn't just a bad movie, it's a signpost of the impending doom of civilization as we know it!
I:10719;1642;Interesting premise for a movie.
I:10719;1643;Nice to see him in a serious role.
I:10719;1644;This movie is awesome, looks great on on blu ray.
I:10719;1645;PQ and AQ are excellent.
I:10719;1646;so it proves me wrong because TC and JF had their best shot that carried the whole show/content right to the end.
I:10719;1647;***************contains spoilers****************Great action, up until about the final third of the film.
I:10719;1648;foxx is a sensitive, mild.
I:10719;1649;cabbie continues to go superhuman.
I:10719;1650;While this movie certainly wasn't the best movie I have seen, it is a very good movie nevertheless.
I:10719;1651;The interplay between the two actors is great, and the performances are more than convincing.
I:10719;1652;The writing is above average, and the movie is funny at times.
I:10719;1653;this begins a surreal ride down the dark side of men's souls.
I:10719;1654;It's Max's previous fare, a lovely US Attorney.
I:10719;1655;What we have in this film is perhaps the best example of Mann's style: Multiple camera angles, leisurely conversations juxtaposed with high.
I:10719;1656;Mann is a master of portraying gritty realism.
I:10719;1657;overall, Collateral provides solid entertainment.
I:10719;1658;Although I enjoyed The Bourne Supremacy somewhat more, that's just one man's opinion.
I:10719;1659;See both and judge for yourself.
I:10719;1660;I got five stops to make.
I:10719;1661;Collect signatures, see some friends, and then I got a 6 a. m. out of LAX.
I:10719;1662;Collateral projects in a much deeper way into Cruise/Vincent character.
I:10719;1663;He can become very quiet, and we can look at the screen, and we will feel that Cruise is totally in command.
I:10719;1664;It's a compelling drama with realistic action that works for the story.
I:10719;1665;And it is done for an emotional reason.
I:10719;1666;Foxx is terrific as the honest hearted guy driving a cab for twelve years, and both come together suddenly like a spike in a railroad right here in this point where things were going to change in one night.
I:10719;1667;The film seemed somewhat implausable, but if you watch it for the imagery, colors and cinematography, it's a remarkable film.
I:10719;1668;The filmwork really captivates, so this makes for a great film visually, but storywise it is somewhat silly (a contract killer.
I:10719;1669;"What separates Michael Mann's ""Collateral"" from most other crime thrillers is that you actually have characters that you enjoy and, more importantly, understand."
I:10719;1670;blood hitman, which is way more than casting against type, is something to behold.
I:10719;1671;And Jamie Foxx as an unwilling accomplice is superb.
I:10719;1672;And Los Angeles, as an unwilling third character, is hypnotic.
I:10719;1673;Still, the movie held my attention thanks to the peppery dialogue between Cruise and Foxx.
I:10719;1674;water mark in thrillers and an exceptional character study worth owning.
I:10719;1675;this movie had the potential to be really good.
I:10719;1676;it's a well acted movie other than Cruise.
I:10719;1677;Jamie does well andthe some of the wise cracks and a few scenes were good.
I:10719;1678;you know, a decent human being and a live.
I:10719;1679;finds himself face to face with Evil incarnate?
I:10719;1680;Collateral is that rare crime drama that is more concerned with theme and character than with the mechanics of the crime .
I:10719;1681;at least until the movie shatters to pieces in its closing reel, that is.
I:10719;1682;One fateful night, he picks up a fare who will end up changing his life forever.
I:10719;1683;Collateral is, above all, an actor's film, as two intriguing characters square off in a fascinating duel of wills.
I:10719;1684;As Max, Jamie Foxx beautifully captures the subtle intensity of a man, passive and humanistic by nature, who is forced to participate in what is to him an incomprehensible case of ritualized slaughter.
I:10719;1685;Together, these two fine actors draw us into their epic struggle between the forces of good and the forces of evil, with the latter seemingly holding most of the cards.
I:10719;1686;the movie is filled with moments of extraordinary suspense and tension as Vincent and Max act out their human drama against the backdrop of a beautifully filmed LA at night .
I:10719;1687;"with Mann showing, once again, as he did in ""Heat,"" that no director captures that milieu with greater precision than he does."
I:10719;1688;Moreover, the moody soundtrack provides a perfect, otherworldly complement to the slightly surreal story unraveling on screen.
I:10719;1689;"still, taken as a whole, ""Collateral"" is a thriller well worth watching."
I:10719;1690;The movies is exciting and moved fast enough to keep your attention.
I:10719;1691;This action drama is suspenseful enough to hold the viewer's attention.
I:10719;1692;The positive qualities of this film far out weigh the flaws.
I:10719;1693;Good music, colorful characters, and interesting scenery provide a plus.
I:10719;1694;The chemistry between the two main characters is believable and fascinating.
I:10719;1695;The comic relief offers some laugh out loud entertainment and works with the plot quite nicely.
I:10719;1696;You're having a quiet, pleasant night, driving your taxi in Los Angeles.
I:10719;1697;You just delivered an especially pleasant fare.
I:10719;1698;Both actors certainly outdo themselves in portraiting .
I:10719;1699;the story is interesting enough to keep your interest and the charaters a multi dimentional .
I:10719;1700;compelling, suspenseful, unforgettable. . . this is an extraordinary movie.
I:10719;1701;The plot is taut and fast.
I:10719;1702;paced, the dialog clever, the characters exceptionally acted, with touches of philosophy.
I:10719;1703;I'm still surprised how much I enjoyed Collateral.
I:10719;1704;Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed the viewing experience.
I:10719;1705;It's absurd and flinch worthy, almost cartoony at times, but it always is presented with flair and style.
I:10719;1706;In fact the whole movie comes off as something you might see in a graphic novel.
I:10719;1707;Pretty cool stuff to see get Hollywood backing.
I:10719;1708;also, as a very nice added bonus feature you get the incredibly beautiful Jada Pinkett Smith (that Fresh Prince is one heckuva lucky guy) as the damsel in distress.
I:10719;1709;when all is said and done what you get is a witty action/drama that never seems to let up.
I:10719;1710;That alone is hilarious enough to make me recommend this movie.
I:10719;1711;Collateral, an intelligent action drama.
I:10719;1712;Mann does such a fantastic job with his movies except for this one fact, which is troubling.
I:10719;1713;Tom Cruise does a phenominal job, completely believable, and so does Jamie Foxx.
I:10719;1714;Michael Mann's feature Collateral is a big, star driven production that shines with a great storyline as well.
I:10719;1715;disc Special Edition)was another star driven story with a wonderful plot.
I:10719;1716;Foxx stars as Max, a dream inspiring cab driver, and Cruise stars as Vincent, a smooth and calculated hitman.
I:10719;1717;the two disc set features a commentary from director Michael Mann, around four or so featurettes detailing the visual FXs, acting, and others behind the film, and a deleted scene with commentary.
I:10719;1718;Cruise is a serious and remarkably talented actor.
I:10719;1719;"I was absolutely glued to the screen watching this movie
I:10719;1720;collateral is a stunning movie, a psychological/action thriller without compare.
I:10719;1721;it will, I have no doubt, become a classic.
I:10719;1722;I think this film overall was pretty good.
I:10719;1723;The way in which LA was filmed was absolutely gorgeous and the soundtrack was jazzy and at times surreal with what was going on in the film.
I:10719;1724;He gives off some nice loot for a couple of stops that usally cost a lot less, but when a huge puzzle peice as to who Vincint really is lands right in front of Max's face, it's all a rollarcoaster of thrills as to what happens next.
I:10719;1725;this movie does a real good job of keeping the susspence in the movie until the end.
I:10719;1726;Also during the action seenes, they are well directed, and the live style sound effects of the fighting and the gunfights really gets your adreniline rushing during the sceenes.
I:10719;1727;And after that he got a well deserved best actor award for his extrodinary performance as Ray Charles.
I:10719;1728;This movie has great suspenction in it, and it also has great action sceenes in it.
I:10719;1729;Collateral is a great film that is rare during the summer season.
I:10719;1730;Director Michael Mann uses intensity to create suspense and offers several surprises along the way for the viewers.
I:10719;1731;tom Cruise's performance here was definitely underrated.
I:10719;1732;He delivers on all accounts as the murderous Vincent.
I:10719;1733;Jamie Foxx is very good as Max, but was an Oscar nomination really deserving?
I:10719;1734;More deserving of a best supporting actor nod would be Mark Ruffalo, who is constantly delivering in every movie he's in.
I:10719;1735;Featured here as a good cop, Ruffalo's performance is as always top notch.
I:10719;1736;collateral combines a strong director with a strong cast and ultimately produces a strong movie.
I:10719;1737;"Collateral is one of the best films of 2004, a visually sumptuous masterpiece that may eclipse ""Heat"" as the definitive modern Los Angeles crime picture."
I:10719;1738;"The plot to ""Collateral,"" from Stuart Beattie's screenplay, is mere potboiler, but Mann's style so informs the story that it acheives a kind of elegance, a fuzzy sheen not unlike the halos surrounding the street lights in the movie."
I:10719;1739;a conflict emerges: The Foxx character is smart, angry and moral enough to size up his captor's plan .
I:10719;1740;Visually the movie is precisely imperfectly so, as Mann mixes his patented jam.
I:10719;1741;up with overhead shots, staged medium compositions, documentary snippets, as when a coyote gallops across the street in the dead of night.
I:10719;1742;"the look of ""Collateral"" is disturbing and beautiful, distancing and timeless."
I:10719;1743;Here it is exotic and lush, both contained within the car and infinite out the window, with a view stretching for miles toward the desert or ocean.
I:10719;1744;It is a shot the city, and cinema, deserves.
I:10719;1745;Surprised, right from the start with my association to the characters ( excellent actors and screen play ).
I:10719;1746;While exciting, it seemed real.
I:10719;1747;Certainly one of the best movies of the year.
I:10719;1748;When Max gives Annie a speedy ride and pleasant conversation, Annie impulsively hands him her business card.
I:10719;1749;get ready for some truly spectacular performances in this tension filled film.
I:10719;1750;Vincent is a new type of role for Cruise, that he carries out with amazing believability and casual elegance.
I:10719;1751;Jamie Foxx outperforms himself as Max, highlighting the superior actor under the hilarious comedian.
I:10719;1752;smith's role as Annie was fairly small, but stands out because of her excellent performance.
I:10719;1753;`Collateral' is a tense thriller, with a tight script, great performances, rapid action bursts, and enough mental friction to keep you on the edge of your seat.
I:10719;1754;my hat is also off to Michael Mann for his superb directing skills, bringing back memories of Manhunter and Miami Vice as he expertly melds audio to visual, creating that sensory indulgence so unique to Mann's work.
I:10719;1755;this is an excellent movie whether you are in the mood for action, thrills, or tension.
I:10719;1756;Collateral is easily one of the best movies of the year.
I:10719;1757;The director, Michael Mann, who has made a lot of excellent films like Manhunter, The Last Of The Mohicans, and the severely underrated Heat, has made one of his finest films ever.
I:10719;1758;The difference in this movie is that the bad guy is the most exciting character and the same guy that a lot of people would rather take sides with than the guy doing the honest and good thing.
I:10719;1759;Tom Cruise does an above excellent acting job and is amazing to watch in this movie.
I:10719;1760;His performance playing the bad guy in Collateral is so perfect, that it clearly stands out and gives him a chance to show an even larger amount of talent on a whole new level.
I:10719;1761;It's actually so good that it is a good enough reason alone to see this film.
I:10719;1762;what makes this film better than a lot is the setting, tone, and look that it carries.
I:10719;1763;Add that on top of Cruise's performance, and a better than usual job of acting by everyone in the film and you have a fantastic movie.
I:10719;1764;The camera shots combined with the just the right cool music give the film a great amount of entertainment.
I:10719;1765;You even have an rare, and unusual artistic touch in a part of the film where music from Audioslave is thrown into at just the right time.
I:10719;1766;michael Mann takes the film in the right direction as usual.
I:10719;1767;He then combines all the elements of a sure winner to come up with a brand new and enjoyable movie that you want to keep watching from the start to the very finish.
I:10719;1768;Collateral is a five star movie that has everything going for it.
I:10719;1769;The most important being that it is highly entertaining and exciting to watch.
I:10719;1770;not to say tom's performance isnt good, but he was better in last samurai, why do people love him in this, and not Samurai, that was an oscar caliber performance, this is a golden globe.
I:10719;1771;Overall a well crafted entertaining film, i recommend heat if you like this, its manns only other good film, ali was dissapointing excepts for wills performance, i hope mann stays with crime dramas that is what he is good at.
I:10719;1772;Than you have found the perfect 120 min movie to watch.
I:10719;1773;Michael Mann this time brings a unique camera work that mixes documentary style with digital.
I:10719;1774;"it's kind of hard to describe, but it works, it gives the film a sort of ""independent"" filmmaking look."
I:10719;1775;"The best scene is a shootout in a club
I:10719;1776;"Another thing I would like to add is Tom Cruise's acting
I:10719;1777;I have seen almost all of Tom's movies and I have to mention that this is the first time he has played a villain, and very well I might add.
I:10719;1778;Anyway, this is a must have by all movie aficionados.
I:10719;1779;When Max gives a free cab ride to a beautiful woman, his next rider turns out to be Victor, the lovable but.
I:10719;1780;I really enjoyed Collateral, despite some initial misgivings after seeing the trailer.
I:10719;1781;Max was an endearing character and a loveable loser.
I:10719;1782;Victor was funny, and despite being a killer had some spot.
I:10719;1783;overall, a fast fun film sure to please action fans!
I:10719;1784;Some part were worth it, some weren't.
I:10719;1785;The conclusion was easily the films best part.
I:10719;1786;It became a fast breath.
I:10719;1787;The movie was well done, put together well and everything.
I:10719;1788;the entire movie was excellent up until the end.
I:10719;1789;I added a new vacuum bag, came back, and the movie was still as boring as it had been for the past 45 minutes.
I:10719;1790;The movie is well paced and Cruise is in rare form, Fox does a nice job, but this is Cruise's movie and he is very good, expecially when things start to go wrong, his character is riviting.
I:10719;1791;This is just great movie, maybe best of the year, which is interesting, since the plot, when I heard about it, didn't strike me as particulary original (boy was I wrong).
I:10719;1792;"It's also Mann's best since ""Heat,"" and to some extent even better than that also."
I:10719;1793;The little tics, those eyes, the clipped delivery of lines, Mann burns the reality of the killer right into you.
I:10719;1794;A lot of good scenes and a nice twist to the plot.
I:10719;1795;"The movie ""The Island"" is a good example."
I:10719;1796;Let me start off by saying that Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise are good actors, and they both did a good job in this movie working together.
I:10719;1797;This is probably the best movie I have seen Tom Cruise do in a long time.
I:10719;1798;The movie is interesting enough to draw you in, and it manages to entertain.
I:10719;1799;Anyway, it was a good / ok movie.
I:10719;1800;it's a very well made, coulda been a satisfying excellent one if the filmaker would've taken more risk.
I:10719;1801;Michael Mann's latest movie is a thrill ride.
I:10719;1802;Tom Cruise gives an Oscar worthy performance as Vincent, a gun for hire looking to kill 5 witnesses for a drug kingpin.
I:10719;1803;Jamie Foxx gives another outstanding preformance as Max, the taxi driver along for the ride.
I:10719;1804;His character is complex but develops into a bold and straightforward individual.
I:10719;1805;I found it interesting that the Academy put Foxx performance in the supporting role rather than lead acting.
I:10719;1806;This is a powerful and action packed film.
I:10719;1807;The beard could go, but the gray hair was good.
I:10719;1808;See it for Tom Cruise (even though he's a wacko), but overall, not earth.
I:10719;1809;This movie was good, and it deserves the props it gets.
I:10719;1810;Tom Cruise did a tremendous job playing a hit man who goes on a one.
I:10719;1811;Jada Pinkett plays a supporting role in the film, and she does a great job too.
I:10719;1812;It is beautiful that luck can play such a big role in one's life.
I:10719;1813;Fate, therefore is the first theme of this movie.
I:10719;1814;At this moment, a beautiful music starts playing which makes this scene another memorable moment in this movie.
I:10719;1815;Loneliness, therefore is the second theme of this movie.
I:10719;1816;if you are not, you can still enjoy this movie by thinking along with Max (instead of Vincent) how he can escape this curious situation he has fallen into.
I:10719;1817;The flipside is of course that he must control the cab driver, which he obviously enjoys because he likes the challenge and is also interesting for the audience to watch.
I:10719;1818;It's gritty, dark, and intense as only Michael Mann knows how to make his movies.
I:10719;1819;I love Mann's style of making crime dramas.
I:10719;1820;If you enjoyed Heat, and Miami Vice, then you'll appreciate Mann's work here.
I:10719;1821;He really enjoys making a film that takes place at night and in the big city so he can fully encompass that city life type of atmosphere.
I:10719;1822;It's a crime drama, it's in a big city, it's a professional scenario.
I:10719;1823;Aside from Mann's brilliance in directing, I will boldy go out on a limb and say that this is Tom Cruise's best acting role to date.
I:10719;1824;top actor that is rarely believable, but I thoroughly enjoyed his role as a stoic hitman who doesn't show emotion, but is just as witty as the next guy.
I:10719;1825;If you're a fan of the movies Heat and Miami Vice then you'll like Collateral for its simple storyline but amazing cinematography and dialogue pretty much between two characters in Vincent and Max.
I:10719;1826;Both Tom and Jamie were perfectly cast.
I:10719;1827;Glad I finally own this flick!
I:10719;1828;however, I have to say that none of that has tarnished the fact that he is a fantastic actor, and this film is proof of that statement.
I:10719;1829;worthy performance as a contract killer named Vincent, who gives a New York taxi driver .
I:10719;1830;the ride of his life.
I:10719;1831;All that you need to know is that the film boasts some excellent scenery, dialogue, and a pretty cool film score.
I:10719;1832;Michael Mann is at the top of his game here.
I:10719;1833;It's an intelligent thriller with a considerable amount of character development, and of course, there are times where suspension of disbelief is required, but not to the point where you are rolling your eyes.
I:10719;1834;it's the story of a man who is given the chance to take a stand and thereby prove to himself that he has what it takes to change his life.
I:10719;1835;and there's absolutely nothing formulaic about Stuart Beattie's wonderfully original characters, nor the ways in which Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx bring them so vividly to life.
I:10719;1836;The strength of characterization in the writing and performances is phenomenal (check out how much we learn about Max in the cab depot before he says even a single word).
I:10719;1837;and there is a lot of pleasure to be had in seeing him play a mesmerizingly ruthless bad guy .
I:10719;1838;but Jamie Foxx is the real star.
I:10719;1839;He walks the line between strength and vulnerability so expertly you never know which side of it he's likely to fall.
I:10719;1840;The situations Beattie's script puts them in are wonderfully unsettling, the dialogue is crisp and intelligent, and the music and editing conspire perfectly to create an experience which is horribly unnerving but never less than totally compelling.
I:10719;1841;Mann's visual style is typically excellent, giving L. a. both its dreamlike expansiveness and gritty immediacy.
I:10719;1842;That's the touch of a great director.
I:10719;1843;Now, having seen it numerous times since, I've really come to appreciate it even more.
I:10719;1844;I had never seen such a stylistic movie made with such authenticity and precision.
I:10719;1845;The way Mann shoots LA at night in grainy digital makes it seem incredibly surreal.
I:10719;1846;while that may seem like a gimmick, the razor sharp script and Tom Cruise's intense performance as the nihilistic hitman ironically adds depth.
I:10719;1847;while the plot in and of itself is nothing new, the execution is so spot on it makes it seem extremely fresh.
I:10719;1848;I have since come to see all of Michael Mann's films.
I:10719;1849;He seems to like common genre but almost always he transforms them into something dynamic.
I:10719;1850;Maybe it resonates with my kinetic personality type but to this day Collateral still holds up as one of my all time favorites.
I:10719;1851;Not a huge Tom Cruise or Jamie Foxx fan, but this was a pretty good movie.
I:10719;1852;Tom Cruise is a wacky hitman who provides some funny lines between sensless shootings.
I:10719;1853;Jamie Foxx is excellent except his shift from lifelong cabbie to action hero is as tough to swallow as the superhot prosecutor's interest in dating him.
I:10719;1854;Jamie Foxx is also outstanding as the hapless, but intelligent, and ultimately resourceful cab driver Max.
I:10719;1855;This is one of Tom Cruise's best movies.
I:10719;1856;"This movie embodies all the elements that a good film should
I:10719;1857;I am not generally a Tom Cruise fan, but I really enjoyed this film.
I:10719;1858;cruise and Foxx have a wonderfully magnetic on screen chemistry.
I:10719;1859;Michael Mann's 'Collateral' is one of my favourite films of 2004, along with Kill Bill' Vol 2.
I:10719;1860;It's a sleek, smart thriller, and doesn't pretend to be anything more.
I:10719;1861;It accomplishes what it sets out to do magnificantly.
I:10719;1862;The acting, writing, and directing are all excellent.
I:10719;1863;Jamie Foxx shows his considerable talent as an actor, and Tom Cruise is solid in a role you wouldn't expect from him.
I:10719;1864;As said above, the dialogue is not bad, there's a couple of brilliant punchlines, the subtle humor is well mixed.
I:10719;1865;Following par is the cinematography, the photography, and the direction.
I:10719;1866;L. a is given a pretty smooth nocturnal look and the characters flow through the city streets in their cab effortlessly.
I:10719;1867;It's all charming really and this is quite undeniable.
I:10719;1868;The setting is achieved in convincing manner.
I:10719;1869;"which is a pity of course, because ""Collateral"" does have great potential written all over it especially because the idea behind it is very intriguing."
I:10719;1870;This is a very nice movie that has a gripping story.
I:10719;1871;If you have got the electronics, this can show them up.
I:10719;1872;to hand combat is pretty realistic.
I:10719;1873;I've gotta look him up.
I:10719;1874;2.5 stars, mostly for the action scenes.
I:10719;1875;", comes ""Collateral"", a taut, suspenseful crime drama that is one of the best films of the summer of 2004, and has outstanding performances from both Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx (this isn't your mom's Tom Cruise!)"
I:10719;1876;what makes the film tick is the great performances from the two principles.
I:10719;1877;"cruise gives one of his best performances of late and I have a feeling that if the Academy remembers ""Collateral"", Cruise might garner another Oscar nomination."
I:10719;1878;All the elements found in a great villian.
I:10719;1879;I actually liked Vincent!Foxx gives his best performance to date as Max.
I:10719;1880;"Mann does a great job at generating, and keeping the flow of the action going thruout ""Collateral"" (I didn't find that the film had any real drag to it)."
I:10719;1881;just bobble your head from side to side and walk funny.
I:10719;1882;and wasnt that a touching scene in the hospital?!?!?!?
I:10719;1883;movie is silly and j foxx,as funny as he kinda is,is just the flavor of the moment.
I:10719;1884;collateral is the perfect example of that type of movie.
I:10719;1885;Both Jamie Fox and Tom Cruise share chemistry together so well you'd might think they have been doing dozens of movies together.
I:10719;1886;The first few minutes show how Fox can carry a regular cab scene with ease, and proves it when he shows his character's background who wants to open a limo driving business.
I:10719;1887;His protrayal of Vincent is astonishingly cold, cool, and cruel.
I:10719;1888;But besides those small minor details this is one pretty good movie with great camera angles.
I:10719;1889;The action is great, the suspense is nail biting, the acting is off the charts, and the ending is powerful to say the least.
I:10719;1890;Unlike most thrillers of our day, Collateral actually makes attempts at character development, and for the most part succeeds.
I:10719;1891;I recommend this to most who wish to watch a thriller with a fairly good character development stage (save for Vincent who is introduced quickly and simple in character).
I:10719;1892;my one comment is on the super adrenaline.
I:10719;1893;rated R for lots of violence and language.
I:10719;1894;"michael Mann, director of great films such as ""Heat"" and ""The Insider"", distributes another fine, tense thriller with ""Collateral""."
I:10719;1895;Collateral breezes along with crafty fashion to the electrifying climax in which Max must save a prosecutor (Jada Pinkett Smith) from the wraith of the merciless contract killer.
I:10719;1896;cruise is spectacular in his role, bringing incredible wit and savvy to his character.
I:10719;1897;"Just as in ""Jerry Maguire"" and ""Top Gun"", his performance as Vincent is one that he was born to play."
I:10719;1898;Foxx delivers his second best performance of the year (behind his Oscar.
I:10719;1899;"worthy work in ""Ray"") as the John Doe bus driver who just wants a better life for himself."
I:10719;1900;As the night escalates from a regular and peaceful to tormenting and fanatical, Foxx shows the audience the transformation of this ordinary man into a hero.
I:10719;1901;Director Michael Mann does a proficient job using the city of Los Angeles throughout the film, creating beautiful pans of the eloquent buildings and roadways that add to the angst of the picture.
I:10719;1902;"A splendid rogue of a film, splicing elements of ""Taxi Driver"", ""The Terminator"", and the formula for the 80's slasher flicks."
I:10719;1903;An excellent effort of terror and suspense.
I:10719;1904;One of the most unique of its kind.
I:10719;1905;All fans of Cruise will thoroughly enjoy.
I:10719;1906;This is definitely one to watch.
I:10719;1907;The interactions between Vin and Max the cab driver were very amusing and interesting, to say the least.
I:10719;1908;To be short and sweet I'd like to say that I really enjoyed this movie up until the extremely brief ending.
I:10719;1909;It was a nice change and I thought he played it very well.
I:10719;1910;smith are wonderful and believeable.
I:10719;1911;Michael Mann is one of my favorite directors.
I:10719;1912;He creates films filled with interesting characters, involving stories and production design all of which really help to create the world his films inhabit.
I:10719;1913;In a good way, this is understandable.
I:10719;1914;"He is the director of ""Heat"", one of the best crime dramas ever made, an epic starring Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, a sprawling film showing characters on both sides of the law as they make the streets of Los Angeles their personal battle ground."
I:10719;1915;"And he is the director of ""Collateral"", another film set in Los Angeles, this time during the course of one evening, as a hit man travels throughout the city, fulfilling his latest contract."
I:10719;1916;"He has also directed ""Last of The Mohicans"", starring Daniel Day Lewis and Madeline Stowe, one of the most romantic films ever made."
I:10719;1917;Perhaps we should simply typecast him as a great director and move on with it.
I:10719;1918;Max has just dropped off a woman that he is extremely interested in, Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith) and still daydreaming.
I:10719;1919;"much like ""Heat""'s blue landscape and sun."
I:10719;1920;"drenched backdrops, ""Collateral"" goes the opposite direction with equally stunning results."
I:10719;1921;Using a digital camera is a gutsy move and provides a unique look for the film, enhancing the atmosphere.
I:10719;1922;When the characters move to a brightly lit area, their faces pop out in sharp relief, but the backgrounds are still grainy.
I:10719;1923;Vega has received his contract and has a fancy tablet.
I:10719;1924;Each of these stops introduces a new, interesting character into the mix, however briefly.
I:10719;1925;With the exception of the Koreatown club and the finale, the action scenes are smaller and lower key, which fits perfectly into the story.
I:10719;1926;"In ""Collateral"", and later ""Ray"", he shows remarkable skill at drama."
I:10719;1927;"In ""Collateral"", his character is quiet, observant and a bit of a loser."
I:10719;1928;Cruise has become one of the world's biggest stars playing heroes.
I:10719;1929;Like most of Cruise's films, he brings an intensity to the role that fits the character.
I:10719;1930;Because of this, Foxx is receiving the lion's share of attention.
I:10719;1931;Both performances are very good.
I:10719;1932;Ruffalo has the most extended supporting role, and is the most successful with it.
I:10719;1933;Collateral is a very good film that will take you along for the ride.
I:10719;1934;wonderful performance by all involved A great movie for a weekend evening at home!
I:10719;1935;this is one of my very favorite films.
I:10719;1936;I have solid reports that the same is true with the blu.
I:10719;1937;One of his better films.
I:10719;1938;Either way , it's been long enough and so the idea , although used , comes across very fresh and interesting.
I:10719;1939;Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx , give outstanding performances.
I:10719;1940;Michael Mann has a pention for telling stories in creative and realistic ways ( Thief , Ali , ect ).
I:10719;1941;and this film is exemplerary of that talent.
I:10719;1942;I have two thoughts on Collateral, 1) it's a complete hoax of a psychological thriller or predictably 2) it's a stunning psychological thriller.
I:10719;1943;I cant make up my mind, so I went for a decent 4 stars instead of the 5 I would prefer to give.
I:10719;1944;But, I just adored watching the relationship between Vincent (Cruise) and the taxi driver Max (Foxx), truly enthralling.
I:10719;1945;existent in Vincent, yet he shows he has feelings, emotions, he shows he is a moral human being.
I:10719;1946;collateral is a slick, arty action/psychological thriller full of some great scenes.
I:10719;1947;Everything handled great and arrived on time.
I:10719;1948;Glad to have one of my favorite movies at such an affordable price and with great extras!
I:10719;1949;I think Mr. Foxx is excellent.
I:10719;1950;he is a real star potential here.
I:10719;1951;it is certainly one to add to your collection: there are so many classic scenes.
I:10719;1952;Again it has been said that the role was created for the way he acts and i think this could well be true.
I:10719;1953;I am a big M. mann film buff and this certainly goes up there with Heat for intensity and realism (except the aforementioned terminator stuff).
I:10719;1954;Since then, I've developed a greater appreciation for film.
I:10719;1955;making in the way a movie is produced, who's cast in the roles, and especially the way it's written.
I:10719;1956;After sitting down a few months ago to finally watch the entirety of Heat, I discovered the gritty magic of one Michael Mann for the first time.
I:10719;1957;Needless to say, he strikes another excellent effort in Collateral.
I:10719;1958;out characters, Collateral is surprisingly spectacular in that it manages to achieve almost the same effect, but with a shorter, more truncated time frame.
I:10719;1959;Spoilers aside, this is a movie that illustrates many a good point about life in general.
I:10719;1960;The script, acting, and screenplay are amazing, thanks in huge part to the chemistry and acting abilities of Cruise, Foxx, Pinkett Smith, and even Ruffalo.
I:10719;1961;Black levels are still rich, detail is fine, and the contrast never wavers, even in the darkest of scenes.
I:10719;1962;I was especially impressed with the techniques they used in filming the cab scenes to get all the camera angles.
I:10719;1963;As dark and dim as it really is inside a cab, the clarity is actually quite striking.
I:10719;1964;What few scenes there are with lighting have a gritty sheen to them as well.
I:10719;1965;Overall, the look of the film itself makes for a very nice transfer.
I:10719;1966;Aesthetically it's not something you could showcase as being reference, but it's a commendable job by Paramount, nonetheless.
I:10719;1967;Dialogue, by the way, is crisp and clear emanating through the center channel with no traces of dropout or distortion.
I:10719;1968;Music does an adequate job coming from the front sides as well and adds a good deal of sporadic immersion to keep you engrossed.
I:10719;1969;As far as I'm concerned, the audio for how it's used in the movie is a perfect transfer.
I:10719;1970;of featurette is interesting, the real star of the extras is the exceedingly informative commentary by director Michael Mann.
I:10719;1971;It serves as a great compliment to the narrative of the film itself and really has the ability to raise one's appreciation for the overall work.
I:10719;1972;I actually liked the bit with Cruise's training sessions a lot and found it to be a testament to how good of an actor he is (personal issues aside).
I:10719;1973;The commentary, though, is a must.
I:10719;1974;4.5Collateral is an extremely well.
I:10719;1975;It's a film that offers a good dose of grit and realism through a very charismatic Tom Cruise and equally subtle Jamie Foxx.
I:10719;1976;Another amazing movie for 2004.
I:10719;1977;this one is one of my favorites!
I:10719;1978;An exciting and intriguing story, mixed with trippy filming make for one awesome movie!
I:10719;1979;All the stars deliver with exceptional acting, especially Jamie Foxx.
I:10719;1980;This film blew my mind, and should be essential viewing if you're up for an intense, yet sophisticated wild ride!
I:10719;1981;This movie is an expertly.
I:10719;1982;and this certainly is the dumbest piece of hokum I've seen in the past ten years.
I:10719;1983;free thriller even a competent piece of drama, let alone a masterpiece.
I:10719;1984;one of the problems with people who make more than one good movie is that we very unreasonably expect them to keep on making good movies instead of just being grateful for what they've given us in the past.
I:10719;1985;By the final reel when he turns into an indestructible relentless Tominator stalking the pair, you suddenly start to appreciate the finely crafted plots and elegant dialogue found in the works of Dolph Lundgren, Jean.
I:10719;1986;Director Michael Mann proves that a compelling drama doesn't require an excess in plot, car chases or violence or humour.
I:10719;1987;Much of the film takes place in the cab with Cruise and Foxx exchanging philosophies of life, goals and dreams.
I:10719;1988;cruise is excellent as the laser.
I:10719;1989;Witness the scene in the jazz club to see how good his taste in music is.
I:10719;1990;He's not cocky like the mastermind bad guy in the first Die Hard, but he is cool, confident and obviously emotionally detached from his victims.
I:10719;1991;dollar Cruise movie star smile.
I:10719;1992;Michael Mann has produced a mostly believable thriller, that makes the competition look like cartoons for adults.
I:10719;1993;sure, there are stretches in the storyline but so long as you're prepared to gloss over them, this is a fine film.
I:10719;1994;Michael Mann is compelling storyteller.
I:10719;1995;Michael Mann's new thriller cannot boast the ingenious script .
I:10719;1996;but it is still a taut, stylish one with good acting from Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx.
I:10719;1997;"important saga of 'Ali'
I:10719;1998;working, honest, and believing that he can do his own business one of these days, and has spent more than 10 years doing the same thing.
I:10719;1999;It's contradicatory, but Tom Cruise manages to be the merciless killer with great skills.
I:10719;2000;He not only lives in the city, but knows the city, and the 'sprawling' city ('Vincent's word) with many faces plays the most important role in the film.
I:10719;2001;still, Mann succeeds in making the film quite gripping thriller, with the great use of LA landscapes.
I:10719;2002;Just prepare to be entertained.
I:10719;2003;cruise and foxx do a great job supporting their roles, and it's a pretty entertaining movie (until the horribly cheesy ending).
I:10719;2004;but you'll see exactly what i'm talking about once you do.
I:10719;2005;being a big tom cruise fan, it's awesome seeing him take on the role of a bad guy and cruise's scene in club fever is absolutely phenomenal!
I:10719;2006;so, this is what made watching collateral worthwhile.
I:10719;2007;Being a huge Tom Cruise fan, I bought this sight unseen.
I:10719;2008;Cruise continues to pick projects that showcase his growth as one of our finest actors.
I:10719;2009;(At the time, Cruise said it was his favorite film to date.
I:10719;2010;His performance proves he has the chops to become a great actor.
I:10719;2011;Foxx is very good in this film.
I:10719;2012;So why only three STARS?This film has everything going for it: great acting, beautiful cinematography, masterful direction, nice editing, great soundtrack, and some good action sequences.
I:10719;2013;Even the dialogue, at times, is marvelous.
I:10719;2014;As you move from scene to scene in this film you realize that every situation and set.
I:10719;2015;It's important to be able to suspend disbelief in a film like this, but I don't think anyone went past the first draft of the screenplay.
I:10719;2016;But you overlook it because it's such a great film.
I:10719;2017;Let's face it, Mann is known for doing macho male fantasy flicks, so you expect it going in.
I:10719;2018;But the script for COLLATERAL is SO ABSURD that it makes it hard to enjoy the film.
I:10719;2019;Foxx, the cabby, picks up Jada Pinkett, the beautiful prosecutor, at the beginning of the film and SHE gives HIM her phone number.
I:10719;2020;The stars in this flick certainly do.
I:10719;2021;And Foxx steps up to the plate with some cool gangsta posing of his own and scores those elusive little addresses.
I:10719;2022;But, he still manages to make the hit and escape in the very same cab that the cops have been looking for.
I:10719;2023;It's parked right out front.
I:10719;2024;Michael Mann's best films are still THIEF, MANHUNTER, and HEAT.
I:10719;2025;this film gets one STAR each for Tom Cruise, Jamie Foxx, and Michael Mann's amazing Los Angeles.
I:10719;2026;Bubblegum action fans may like this one.
I:10719;2027;I'm going to watch COLLATERAL again before I sell it, because it is beautiful to look at.
I:10719;2028;Seeing all these positive reviews tells me more about the dumbing down of American society than anything!
I:10719;2029;Like good jazz Collateral is able to quietly move into your head before washing you away in an ocean of smooth chaos.
I:10719;2030;spoken man with big ambitions.
I:10719;2031;Vincent (Tom Cruise) is a grey haired, grey suit wearing man whose natural charm is radiant.
I:10719;2032;Unable to escape Max is taken along for the ride as Vincent continues his job with professional precision.
I:10719;2033;in this journey both men will learn from each other in this trek through the underbelly of Los Angeles.
I:10719;2034;director Michael Mann has created a tight thriller with equally award.
I:10719;2035;worthy performances from his two leading men.
I:10719;2036;He operates with expert precision and knows the requirements of his job, but he doesn't do it out of pleasure, or amusement.
I:10719;2037;but he never seems to enjoy his line of work.
I:10719;2038;mann drives a tight movie which explores the bad along with the good of each of its characters.
I:10719;2039;The violence is swift and sudden and will take an audience's breath away, but most of the film's brilliance is within its dialogue.
I:10719;2040;The action and thriller aspects of it are good, but what makes this film great is entirely rested in the performances of Cruise and Foxx.9/10 Stars
I:10719;2041;Tom Cruise is fantastic, as usual.
I:10719;2042;Jamie Foxx is good .
I:10719;2043;Michael Mann proves again, with this film, that he comprehends the minds and machinations of criminals better than just about anyone else.
I:10719;2044;He gives these characters depth, complexity, and crackling dialogue as he takes us deep into their world and their way of thinking and behaving.
I:10719;2045;tom Cruise is so good in the role of the criminal Vincent that after a few minutes, you will forget who it is you're watching.
I:10719;2046;mann lovingly photographs the city and adds the usual perfectly chosen songs to fill out the story.
I:10719;2047;highly recommended and probably underrated.
I:10719;2048;The movie was great to watch, put your feet up and enjoy.
I:10719;2049;Every action film has its implausibilities.
I:10719;2050;Tom Cruise as Vincent, a dangerously apathetic and charismatic hit man, manages to hit every one of his targets perfectly without once injuring or killing a single innocent person.
I:10719;2051;But the benefit I find in minor realism issues in action flicks is that it allows us to be in another place where our hearts can pound as we witness the chilling accuracy of a man who already haunts with no more than a glance reminiscent of a fox.
I:10719;2052;tom Cruise portrays this Vincent surprisingly well.
I:10719;2053;I have to say, I found that refreshing.
I:10719;2054;worthy as many people had hoped, Cruise amazes and enthralls with a cunningly crafted personality and wolf.
I:10719;2055;Cruise manages to make us believe he thinks of humans as stars: there are so many that the death of one couldn't possibly matter.
I:10719;2056;I loved when he compared the death of one man to a massacre in Rwanda.
I:10719;2057;The screenplay really provokes solid thought often absent in many thrillers thrown at us these days.
I:10719;2058;Pinkett Smith's tenderness only elevates the human part of 'Collateral.'
I:10719;2059;the city of Los Angeles also plays a role in the film, thanks to gorgeously appropriate digital cinematography that captures the night life and the eerie silence of a city when all but a few have sunken into dreams.
I:10719;2060;In fact, this is probably his best work since 'The Insider.'
I:10719;2061;His flawless direction alone was worth the price of admission.
I:10719;2062;It still manages to get your heart racing.
I:10719;2063;As the credits role, you feel utterly satisfied, a feeling rare among modern cinema.
I:10719;2064;The only way I found out about it was by clicking Audio Options on disc 1, and there you will see the available commentary by Michael Mann, which is dry but informative.
I:10719;2065;I admit I was pleasantly surprised to find it.
I:10719;2066;The cinematography is sublime, with terrific blues and greens.
I:10719;2067;I've usually disliked any attempt to shoot features on video, but it is employed to perfection here capturing the cab interior and nighttime cityscape of LA beautifully.
I:10719;2068;It is great to see Cruise play evil, maybe his best performace since TJ Mackey in Magnolia.
I:10719;2069;off made acceptable by superb production values.
I:10719;2070;"In an opening scene worthy of its own film, ""Collateral"" introduces its audience to a cab driver (Jamie Foxx) who would rather be doing anything else in the world than driving cabs."
I:10719;2071;the film's strength is found in the performances of its two leads and in the unequaled craftsmanship of its director (Michael Mann).
I:10719;2072;give performances that rival anything in their pasts.
I:10719;2073;"Foxx shows he can tone down his persona, nailing the cerebral Max, while Cruise continues his recent trend of trying to ""muddy up"" his good boy image."
I:10719;2074;Working with material that could have resulted in a corny, tired formula film in the hands of a lesser director, Mann is able to create a film that expands the potential for a crime drama.
I:10719;2075;He opens up the genre with ambiguous questions on the nature of killing and decorates the scenes with haunting, dark images.
I:10719;2076;desirable script into a wholly enjoyable film.
I:10719;2077;Michael Mann's shots make it watchable.
I:10719;2078;On the one hand it's an immensely entertaining watch, full of high style, expansive cinematography, and explosive action.
I:10719;2079;In other words, it's worth watching, but it's certainly not anywhere near the level of Reservoir Dogs, Heat, or other recent masterpieces of its genre.
I:10719;2080;the premise is a perfect example of what's both good and bad about the movie.
I:10719;2081;The idea of a top hitman getting a cab driver to chaffeur him around on his hits is an intriguing one, even if it's not all that hard to poke holes in.
I:10719;2082;This movie relies far more heavily on character than most of its ilk, and the success of Foxx and Cruise in their respective roles is largely responsible for pulling it through its less.
I:10719;2083;Cruise's Vincent is a model of amorality, the kind of character who's so delightfully malevolent that you just can't stop watching.
I:10719;2084;mann's direction is a huge plus as well.
I:10719;2085;And in an extreme situation like the one Max is faced with, it's a lot better to be like Vincent than like, well, himself.
I:10719;2086;the first three quarters of Collateral are especially compelling, as Mann puts his two lead actors through a series of superbly executed set pieces interrupted only by the aforementioned cab scenes and a relatively gratuitous subplot that strands Mark Ruffalo (a good actor) in a rather thankless role as a cop investigating the case.
I:10719;2087;he belongs in romantic dramas, not playing a contract killer.
I:10719;2088;but if you can ignore that, collateral is a smart thriller keeping you on the edge of your seat.
I:10719;2089;Foxx gives a good performance as the cab driver, steering away from his usual comedic roles.
I:10719;2090;"the scenery blends well with the movie, a nocturnal Los Angeles from the ""glitz to the ghettos""."
I:10719;2091;Fox's ability to change character at the drop of a dime is very impressive!!
I:10719;2092;He has just performed a kind deed by providing an attractive young lawyer who has expressed frustration and doubt over the success of the federal case she is in Los Angeles to prosecute a free ride, for which she was grateful and provided him with her card.
I:10719;2093;Initially Cruise behaves in the manner of the successful executive type he appears to be, articulate, well dressed and bemoaning the fact that Los Angeles is so spread out with people failing to connect.
I:10719;2094;blooded that he politely engages in a conversation about jazz and an appearance by the great Miles Davis with the operator of a club in the Leimert Park section of Los Angeles, who also plays the trumpet in the band.
I:10719;2095;Cruise makes a positive impression on Fox's mother through his engaging conversational manner.
I:10719;2096;He has a strong hunch that he is intended to be Cruise's last victim.
I:10719;2097;michael Mann directed the film from a screenplay written by Stuart Beattie.
I:10719;2098;The crafty cinematography by Dion Beebe and Paul Cameron accent the rapidly paced action with bull's.
I:10719;2099;This movie is about a man of action who meets a man of thinking and what happens when the two meet and interact with each other and thus learn from and change each other.
I:10719;2100;up of their own lives, as well as in each character's interactions with others.
I:10719;2101;This is impacting his life, the life of the people he comes into contact with on the streets of LA, and his relationship with his family (grandmother).
I:10719;2102;This change in each other changes other people as well.
I:10719;2103;For one character, he moves on with his life with his new psychological make.
I:10719;2104;this movie is an excellent psychological thriller.
I:10719;2105;The cinematography is unique and powerful.
I:10719;2106;i also love the soundtrack.
I:10719;2107;this is another brilliant and excellent work by Michael Mann.
I:10719;2108;It's diffinately one of the best tom cruise performances I've ever seen.
I:10719;2109;It was wonderful and it's one of the movies that I can occasionally watch several times without getting bored.
I:10719;2110;but I can close my eyese to them and say that it was a brilliant movie.
I:10719;2111;everybody knows that a two disc special edition is more exciting than a single disc even if there is not much on disc 2.
I:10719;2112;Despite of it, the movie is not boring but actually enjoyable and fun to watch.
I:10719;2113;One thing I really liked about this film was the way of look.
I:10719;2114;"I mean, the images of the whole movie are very natural and vivid as I watch a ""live"" TV show."
I:10719;2115;This feature makes the film very unique and worth watching.
I:10719;2116;But you will find Tom's performance interesting and you get the feel that if he does another bad guy, it will become an Oscar conten.
I:10719;2117;The acting was great by all actors involved.
I:10719;2118;The story was well written and well executed.
I:10719;2119;And with the white hair and beard he's captivating to watch as he unstoppably takes on the sociopathic hired [.]
I:10719;2120;jamie Foxx is equally engaging as Max, a big.
I:10719;2121;jada Pinkett Smith has a smaller role, but still puts in some solid acting as a prosecuting attorney who rides in Max's cab.
I:10719;2122;the action and dialogue throughout Collateral are brilliantly played out and hard to turn away from.
I:10719;2123;the second disc is full of special features, including a short about Tom Cruise dressing up as a FedEx worker in order to work on not being recognizable for the role of Vincent.
I:10719;2124;It's all worth checking out.
I:10719;2125;Thanks reviewers for inspiring me to tell the REAL truth!
