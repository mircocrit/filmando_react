I:420;1;I, like most people, loved this director's previous work.
I:420;2;"Signs and ""The Sixth Sense"" are two of the best thrillers of the last five years *arguably only outranked by ""The Ring""* and I expected this to be just as good if not better."
I:420;3;But, visually, and I love those Fall and Winter visuals, this film is beautiful.
I:420;4;The soundtrack by James Newton Howard is 5 stars and is really what saves this film.
I:420;5;The Village should be in everyone's private film library because it is the best example of M. Night Shymalan's use of camera as canvas, despite it being his worse film story.
I:420;6;He does have an eye for scene and location.
I:420;7;Yes, in my opinion this movie is a classic.
I:420;8;One may ask, why do I rate it four stars rather than five?
I:420;9;Instead I watched a film with an amazing concept, an unexpected twist (shymalan's famous for his twists yet he always catches me by surprise) and a message with left me pondering and which is also open to interpretation.
I:420;10;You'll like it better this way.
I:420;11;In a decade or two, i see this movie being considered a classic.
I:420;12;Instead, I'll talk about this filmmaker's first movie.
I:420;13;I taught movie classes, this is a film I chose, and I saw it about a dozen times, fully aware of the ending.
I:420;14;The star is Haley Joel Osment!
I:420;15;The acting was flawless and the scenery most certainly created a mood.
I:420;16;Shyamalan is a masterful writer, director and producer.
I:420;17;One of these days I'm going to watch a Shyamalan movie in the right frame of mind.)
I:420;18;I thought about this film for days after seeing it.
I:420;19;Shyamalan is a filmmaker of bold originality surviving in a commercialized medium.
I:420;20;That's a good thing, no matter what your opinion of each individual film is.
I:420;21;With every movie he has made, the twist has gotten less and less until finally we come to the Village.
I:420;22;As a movie, it was okay.
I:420;23;Shyamalan can create great popcorn movies, but this over.
I:420;24;epic are Joaquin Phoenix as an energetic young man with small.
I:420;25;the redeeming values in the movie, though, are Ms. Howard's astonishing breakthrough performance, which almost redeems the non.
I:420;26;"drama
I:420;27;M. Night Shyamalan is probably the greatest directors of our time.
I:420;28;He developes the plot and suspense throughout this movie.
I:420;29;If you are truly a M. Night fan then you will truly love this movie.
I:420;30;by a true fan i mean you have seen all his movies not just the most popular ones like all the other people mention.
I:420;31;Not many people have herd of that movie but it shows how good he is as a director.
I:420;32;So this is a must see.
I:420;33;m. Night will continue making great movies like this.
I:420;34;"the ""twist"" at the end is great, like all of M. Night's movies, but by the time you get to it, you won't really care."
I:420;35;it made me so mad, cause I hear my cousin and my mother loved it.
I:420;36;The only film of his that I do like is The Sixth Sense, now that movie is pure brilliance.
I:420;37;The film is an exploration reminiscent of the study of human nature in The Twilight Zone show or even, on a lesser level, films such as The Matrix.
I:420;38;"The acting is superb, the film is visually stunning and the screenplay is well paced and free of ""movie cheese"" that we see so often."
I:420;39;However, if you are looking for a suspenseful, WELL ACTED, chilling, emotional movie that actually has a STORY TO TELL, you will love this movie.
I:420;40;This movie was EXCELLENT and superbly acted by all.
I:420;41;"M. Night Shyamalan is one of the few directors working in Hollywood who truly has talent and respect for his craft as evidenced by his masterful films ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"", films with ingenious scripts and sublime yet subdued direction."
I:420;42;faced and above all, handled with a hand so heavy that the film is crushed under its weight.
I:420;43;The story about a secluded community in Pennsylvania in the 19th century which begins to experience terrifying trespasses from mysterious creatures who live in the surrounding woods, is simple and at first, intriguing.
I:420;44;Half of the general public loves it, and half hates it.
I:420;45;The Village holds its own in writing, directing, acting and cinematography.
I:420;46;The writing is complex, smart and quietly shocking.
I:420;47;He succeeded in this hit or miss experiment exceptionally well.
I:420;48;all in all, The Village is smart, tragic, subtle, and tremendously moving.
I:420;49;M. Night Shyamalan is one of my favorite directors, and what happens in this film is another reason why.
I:420;50;William Hurt, a great actor in a great role and performance, is the leader of the town and the father of Ivy, played brillinatly in her first role by Bryce Dallas Howard.
I:420;51;Ivy is a blind girl who seems to have all the good qualities of the town and everyone loves her, especially Lucius, played by Phoenix and a mentally unstable character played amazing by Adrien Brody.
I:420;52;Sigourney Weaver and Brendan Gleeson also put in very good performances in a film that is impossible to talk about unless I give spoilers.
I:420;53;It is the most beautifully shot film of the year and is definitely the most engrossing.
I:420;54;The movie, as thought provoking as it is, is still one of the best films of th year and one of the most entertaining.
I:420;55;If you go into this film expecting 'Sixth Sense' type horror, you will be dissappointed.
I:420;56;The attempts at suspense and frightening the audience ensue from there.
I:420;57;2.5 stars rounded up to 3.
I:420;58;The message is subtle, but powerful.
I:420;59;The filmwork is masterful, and the acting is superb .
I:420;60;it's NOT a supernatural thriller.
I:420;61;If you are willing to be challenged, watch it.
I:420;62;Anyone who has seen M. Night movies by now should know, every time you watch a film of his, you'll learn something new that you didn't catch last time.
I:420;63;I also noticed how moving a story it really is.
I:420;64;For people out there looking for a scare, it has it's dark and foreboding elements in it, and a several great jump scenes (If you watch it at home, watch at night with the lights out, and turn up the volume.
I:420;65;The central theme is a love story, which is incredibly moving and pure, and the soundtrack is breathtaking.
I:420;66;Another pivotal theme is the theme of facing ones fears, and in the end Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard) will have to face her fears for the one person she loves the most.
I:420;67;It's got scares, it's got emotionally moving scenes, but most importantly, it is a great story with great themes and plot points.
I:420;68;M. Nights best work yet, If you are like me, you'll be left wishing the movie was longer.
I:420;69;Well executed, and a beautiful story.
I:420;70;if you're looking for a very well crafted movie that takes you on a thought provoking journey that looks into both the personal and social needs to face our fears and make choices in the face of those fears in order to create a better life for ourselves .
I:420;71;then you might just find this movie as enjoyable as I did.
I:420;72;The Village has it's twists and thrills, but it's not ABOUT twists and thrills.
I:420;73;`cause seriously, unless you've got a real good history in movie.
I:420;74;making and acclaimed talent you shouldn't flaunt your name on a movie so ludicrously.
I:420;75;"There's a forest with some type of ""beasts""."
I:420;76;The council of elders are keeping secrets locked in boxes in the corner of their houses.
I:420;77;Joaquin is in love with a blind girl (daughter of the leader of the village).
I:420;78;She has to climb over a wall at the end of the path and (Big Plot Twist # 2) she's on a road in the 21st Century.
I:420;79;Stunned that this ever made it to the box office.
I:420;80;true: The Sixth Sense was a genuinely absorbing and effective piece of movie.
I:420;81;It will continue to be watched for a long time, and deservedly so.
I:420;82;True too: Shyamalan has a good eye, and some of the shots were ravishing.
I:420;83;True as well: Bryce Dallas Howard is lovely and does as much with her as one could hope in the midst of such drivel.
I:420;84;"a wonderful surprise that, just like The Village, left me with a ""wow"" feeling as the credits began to roll."
I:420;85;The Village has an interesting premise.
I:420;86;"Ivy faces her fears,going on a journey to find the truth&see
I:420;87;The ending is in its own way satisfying.
I:420;88;In a sense,the movie is worth watching for its conclusion alone.
I:420;89;There is genuinely good storytelling& a good message about the effects of fear on society,but the script hobbles it.
I:420;90;"the problem with ""The Village"" is that it was released into a culture that really thought ""Joey"" was necessary, that Oprah is brilliant and that Trump has to be right because he's on TV and rich."
I:420;91;Disappointment is the word that best describes my feelings after watching this movie.
I:420;92;I think I will keep watching Mr Shyamalan's movies, but next time I will know what to expect.
I:420;93;this is a good director that should find a way to stop doing the same thing over and over again.
I:420;94;I loved this movie, despite the disgusting amount of bad critcism it received.
I:420;95;It was a deeply romantic and brilliantly performed story that has shown an increasing talent in the young director now known for his plot twists.
I:420;96;The movie has a great story twist, and the characters are amazing.
I:420;97;The actors alone make this movie worth seeing.
I:420;98;What is it about the movie that has inspired me, you ask???
I:420;99;Well, I am here to tell you that he was successful in what he set out to do with this movie.
I:420;100;"The Village does touch on romance and also flirts with that unknown element that all his movies seem to have, whether it is
I:420;101;It also has the twist ending.
I:420;102;The human spirit and how it needs to soar high.
I:420;103;"la"" but ends up right were it started!"
I:420;104;I like M. Night Shyamalan's movies, I own them all and I rate the village 3 on the list, just ever.
I:420;105;so behind Signs and much better than unbreakable.
I:420;106;Just remember, don't watch this expecting a good horror movie, just expect a good movie that will make you think a little.
I:420;107;It real simple, if you have a higher than average IQ, can appreciate Alfred Hitchcock, and are a movie buff.
I:420;108;It is a must for your collection.
I:420;109;Shyamalan is truly a gifted individual.
I:420;110;"It's shot beautifully, boasts a talented cast of actors, showcases a clearly talented new comer in Bryce Howard, but leaves the viewer with the dreaded, ""Is that it?"
I:420;111;"but they had a pristine green valley, sturdily built cute houses and fashions that would make Laura ""Half."
I:420;112;My nine yeAr old has been wanting to see a scary movie yet she doesnt fare well at bedtime if she does so we are very careful about what she sees.
I:420;113;This one was great for her she loved it and it didt freak her out too bad.
I:420;114;Good plot twists and i like adrian brodys character.
I:420;115;My family really enjoyed this movie.
I:420;116;you can see the ending from a mile away.
I:420;117;Shyamlan's stories a meant to make your mind WORK .
I:420;118;If you want to pause and think 'what if' you will probably enjoy it.
I:420;119;the camera work was great and the actors did an excellent job.
I:420;120;Feeling chilled, and severely creeped out, people gathering the strength to go into the forest is insanely frightening!
I:420;121;plot, beautiful use of colors, suspenseful moments, and horric encounters with beasts and knives where you just want to scream.
I:420;122;The ending carries a surprising twist that changes WHEN you think this village is existing, and a concealed truth about the history of the village and the forest is revealed.
I:420;123;"I predict that this will be the end of M. Night's ""spooky"" film career."
I:420;124;He shoots scenes of the woods for like 10 min straight.
I:420;125;Yea , like that adds atmosphere.
I:420;126;Critics and consumers are entering the theatre with expectations that extend beyond genre.
I:420;127;When you compare a Hattori Hanso sword, you compare it to every other sword made by a man.
I:420;128;There is a great deal of warmth in the characters, which keeps the tension from becoming a source of frustration.
I:420;129;The greatest center of warmth is newcomer Bryce Dallas Howard, who accounts for an easy ninety percent of the emotional punch of this film.
I:420;130;Her talent far outweighs what her filmography may suggest.
I:420;131;the cinematography is amazing because of its duality.
I:420;132;old taking snapshots of the backs of people's heads, and then it effortlessly flops into some of the most gorgeous juxtapositions of radiant colors.
I:420;133;Shyamalan plays with color a lot more than some may dare, and the overall effect adds another dimension of spiritual tone.
I:420;134;the surprise ending is brilliant because it sneaks up on the viewer in such a way that it takes five minutes after the credits are done rolling to fully absorb the weight of what Shyamalan is trying to say with this film.
I:420;135;Great movie, just not wet.your.
I:420;136;The lovely village has many secrets and innocent young people caught in its lies.
I:420;137;bryce Dallas Howard is pretty Oscar.
I:420;138;worthy if you ask me.
I:420;139;She plays the main protagonist, Ivy, a good.
I:420;140;The plot is traditional, but M. night executes such refreshing, unexpected ways of depicting it.
I:420;141;This movie actually has a heartwarming, almost painstaking charm because of Ivy's intense determination to succeed.
I:420;142;After four films where a huge twist is revealed at the end, it seems that the films have become somewhat formulaic.
I:420;143;Also the creatures begin to cross the borders into the village, striking fear into the townspeople.
I:420;144;And then, in the big twist ending.
I:420;145;This movie will entertain you.
I:420;146;After four films where a huge twist is revealed at the end, it seems that the films have become somewhat formulaic.

I:420;150;He builds the world from the ground up every time, spending the first half of the movie lingering on glasses of water and shoes.
I:420;151;wai or anything, but he does this very well.
I:420;152;some people find this slow 'n' boring, but I enjoy it.
I:420;153;I just enjoy watching this fully.
I:420;154;rendered world, there on the screen waiting to get twisted.
I:420;155;The world, and Hollywood in particular, could use more of that.
I:420;156;the same thing happend with Unbreakable, which in my opinion, is probably the best super hero origin movie ever made, because it's so realistically done, you can't feel but believe that this man has special powers.
I:420;157;I either figure it had a gun or some kind of electronic).
I:420;158;Evil actions will still be committed by people, now matter how much you try, because in the end, it is our own human nature that causes those actions.
I:420;159;We feel love, hate/anger, greed, sadness/depression.
I:420;160;Violent crimes are often committed because one of those emotions.
I:420;161;the choice of colors for the movie also shows its point.
I:420;162;Blood is red, so by hurting someone, you are bringing out the 'forbidden' color.
I:420;163;While yellow, if I remember correctly, psychologically, has a soothing effect on human psyche.
I:420;164;it's a movie about wanting innocence.
I:420;165;We are a society that believes themselves to be right in everything.
I:420;166;informed 21st century person, reacted to Ivy's innocence, her pleas and felt compelled to protect that innocence.
I:420;167;It's interesting to see that he was young himself, not yet too old so as to be absolutely cynical.
I:420;168;Because we want to protect innocence.
I:420;169;This movie's one of my favorites.
I:420;170;Up there in the top five, I probably watched it about a dozen times since I bought it.
I:420;171;The script is clever, and the story is VERY romantic.
I:420;172;"eyed and sighing ""all that in the name of love."
I:420;173;Not to mention the ending, which I enjoyed, being not only a girl, but a twilight zone, sci.
I:420;174;As you can imagine, a lot of my dorkier friends came out pleased.
I:420;175;If this is your type of movie, you'll LOVE it.
I:420;176;it helps if you believe in true love ^_^
I:420;177;"M. Night Shyamalan's newest movie is always his best
I:420;178;The Village will never get 5 star ratings across the board because Shyamalan crafted this movie so it only appeals to half the audience.
I:420;179;The controversiality stemming from the initial viewers sparked more viewings.3.
I:420;180;The 50% that loved this movie spread the word and even more viewed it.4.
I:420;181;It will continue selling over the years mainly for its depth but even for its controversiality.
I:420;182;"the Village is not a movie for the masses
I:420;183;It is a joy and a privilege to be living in a time when advancements in technology allow us to witness such an exquisite welding together of visual, sonic, and literary art as can be found in M. Night Shyamalan's most recent film The Village.
I:420;184;The evening my sister, brother and I went to the theatre to see it, we were completely mesmerized from the moment the music began until the very last credit disappeared from the screen.
I:420;185;many people do not presently appreciate the brilliance of the film, but I believe, in time, more and more will come to realize what a masterpiece it really is.
I:420;186;the film contains breathtaking music and cinematography, and excellent dialogue.
I:420;187;The casting and acting is flawless.
I:420;188;The characters develop very well throughout, and the storyline is surprisingly fresh and original.
I:420;189;The Village belongs with other mystery, thriller, romance, dramas such as Vertigo.
I:420;190;The plot is very promising, as is the beginning of the film.
I:420;191;A ninteenth century village is surrounded by a forbidden forest inhabited by vicious creatures .
I:420;192;It works every time, but not in THE VILLAGE.
I:420;193;Anticlimactic is the best word to describe it.
I:420;194;"Loved ""Sixth Sense"" and enjoyed ""Unbreakable"" and found ""Signs"" to be suspenseful, though disappointing in the end."
I:420;195;I was skeptical yet hopeful for some goosebumps.
I:420;196;His use of color is significant and his settings and overall mood are top.
I:420;197;The premise is almost fairy tale like.
I:420;198;as with any community there are always those curious about what is on the outside.
I:420;199;One brave soul decides he wishes to venture out beyond the borders.
I:420;200;And so begins the adventure.
I:420;201;It may not sound like much but I found it to be plenty spine tingling to watch and suspenseful enough to keep me interested.
I:420;202;I thought the main story of the movie was a love story more than a scary one.
I:420;203;Joaquin Phoenix was amazing in the movie and so was Bryce Dallas Howard suprisingly.
I:420;204;Even though I guessed the ending it still surprised my friends and I still thought it was good even though I guessed it.
I:420;205;If you like Night's other movie's you'll most likely like this one too.
I:420;206;however,the more I think about this film, the more I actually was intrigued and really liked it.
I:420;207;Part suspense, a hint of horror, drama, and the ever popular thought .
I:420;208;in this respect this is his gift or talent as a story teller to keep you hooked along with superb marketing and advertising tactics.
I:420;209;I will say this, the ending will definitely surprise audiences more than shock!
I:420;210;Much better than Unbreakable, not as scary or suspenseful as Signs, and nowhere near as somewhat intriguing or chilling as The Sixth Sense.
I:420;211;the Village still entertains in it's own right, though.
I:420;212;I saw this movie YEARS later, and thought it was amazing.
I:420;213;Beautifully written, acted, shot, designed.
I:420;214;par rating is the film's improper promotion.
I:420;215;Signs also hinged on thrill and awe, mystery and fright to achieve it's success.
I:420;216;the film fell from its deserving grace due to the tremendous success of its creator, and audience.
I:420;217;You know, that's where you go into a film experience expecting (usually) to love it based on a particular actor, writer or director who has thrilled you in the past.
I:420;218;On the other hand this latest offering from the mysterious director of Signs, Unbreakable and Sixth Sense has some well.
I:420;219;the acting was good in some cases and wonderful for the most part.
I:420;220;I like the fact that while there was a good representation of power names among the cast, the true hero of the story is played by an unknown, Dallas Bryson Howard, with a genuine feel for what makes a smart and determined young woman tick.
I:420;221;A bit hard to credit, but then wait until you see the kind of savvy the creatures are dealing with in the person of Ivy.
I:420;222;inspired mood piece that it is, if you are capable of checking your preconceived notions (and game boys) at the door first.
I:420;223;the Village will appeal to anybody who appreciates films like Brotherhood of the Wolf, Memento and Identity.
I:420;224;write reviews, but I felt this one deserved it.
I:420;225;Joaquin Phoenix and Bryce Dallas Howard are marvelous and have beautiful chemistry that you have to see for yourself.
I:420;226;"And my little cousin Emily says this of the movie, and I quote, ""That's a really good movie."""
I:420;227;The village is ruled by a group of benign Elders (both male and female), and everyone lives a simple, happy, rustic lifestyle.
I:420;228;The final plot twist reveals that the film is actually set in the present day (2004) and that the village is a kind of cult which has deliberately cut itself off from civilization.
I:420;229;"Yet, ""The Village"" has *something* that makes it tolerable, even good (after a fashion)."
I:420;230;Perhaps it's Ivy, perhaps it's the fact that the Elders are tragic rather than evil, or perhaps it actually is the twist ending.
I:420;231;Both two, three and four stars are options.
I:420;232;The twist ending itself is worth four.
I:420;233;As a compromise, I give it three stars.
I:420;234;"guessing"", simply making a game out of trying to figure out the plot twist."
I:420;235;And it was a simple amazing film.
I:420;236;The cinemetography is gorgeous .
I:420;237;sweeping, clean, and photographically amazing .
I:420;238;it captures the cold, rough atmosphere of the town perfectly.
I:420;239;The acting is amazing .
I:420;240;when you take into account that the characters are actually 20th century people who have to speak in old english, you realize they are actually acting superbly.
I:420;241;And the musical score is one of the best of the past 3 years, rivaled only by LOTR.
I:420;242;It is not horror, it is a deeply moving commentary on modern society, innocence, and courage.
I:420;243;It is rich, intelligent, and emotional, and for me is one of my favorite films of all time.
I:420;244;This movie certainly isn't bad, the first half of it was quite strong.
I:420;245;The characters and their society fleshed out nicely, a good job was done building tension.
I:420;246;One of Shyamalan's good films.
I:420;247;"The plot is good, the ""creatures"" are cool lookin and the ending of the film, where everything is revealed, was really well done and unexpected."
I:420;248;The cast is good and the acting is good as well.
I:420;249;It's a well thought out film.
I:420;250;"And while it failed severely in scaring me, ""The Village"" is still a pretty decent flick."
I:420;251;Great production value with a palpable sense of fear filling every shot.
I:420;252;"The ""twist"" is also quite thought."
I:420;253;provoking in the sense that it makes you think about such incidents happening in real life.
I:420;254;And while it has been said before, it's worth repeating that Bryce Dallas Howard truly carries the film with vulnerability and depth.
I:420;255;m. Night has the potential for becoming a great director, if only he would branch out and try new things.
I:420;256;And at the same time, we the audience should allow him the freedom to try something new.
I:420;257;The Village, while having a great set.
I:420;258;I was really impressed with Sixth Sense, so as with most his fans.
I:420;259;it starts out visually appealing with a range of familiar faces.
I:420;260;"I'm a fair person, so when the movie started out slow I thought ""well a lot of movies start slow so I'll wait till it picks up"" So I waited, waited, waited and waited."
I:420;261;I found that looking at the back of someones head more entertaining than the movie.
I:420;262;I was surprised at the revelations at the film's end, and enjoyed the whole premise, because the director has crafted a complete and atmospheric setting that appeals to someone willing to think a little bit.
I:420;263;they accept the idea and enjoy the details.
I:420;264;Similarily, M. Night Shyamalan asks us to think about how our society (or any society) holds itself together for the benefit of all.
I:420;265;a good film can, in the right way, stimulate questions long after the closing credits have rolled.
I:420;266;Interesting questions, but completely beside the point.
I:420;267;"Perhaps, after all the angles are examined, the best way to view ""The Village"" is as a set."
I:420;268;piece, existing in time and yet timeless.
I:420;269;the acting is fine overall.
I:420;270;I think that William Hurt excels at this sort of restrained, yet passionate character.
I:420;271;Joaquin Phoenix proves that he can dial into a deep reservoir of emotion without resorting to hysterics.
I:420;272;"Adrian Brody is excellent as the disturbed young man whose eccentricities redefine the term ""village idiot."""
I:420;273;The best acting comes from Bryce Dallas Howard, whose subtlety and emotion hints at even better work to come.
I:420;274;and so make their thoughts known in a way that seems quaint to our ears.
I:420;275;Students are able to make the connections between the two utopian societies.
I:420;276;It's time that the lemmings that make up the American moviegoing public realize that M. Night Shama.
I:420;277;"So, wow, what a ""twist"" to later find out what year it really is, huh?"
I:420;278;He writes and directs the most incredible movies.
I:420;279;"I've only seen one before, ""The Woman in the Water,"" and I loved it."
I:420;280;As you can see by the stars, I loved this one, too.
I:420;281;a few of the citizens of the Village are especially important to the story, but I must not tell you much about the ways in which they are important.
I:420;282;ivy Walker, Edward's beautiful daughter, is blind.
I:420;283;"Perhaps that is the reason she has more courage than the rest of the Village
I:420;284;In any case, he's the one who laughs and invites the monsters in rather than being afraid.
I:420;285;from here, anything I say might give away the artfully crafted plot, and I do not want to do that.
I:420;286;And by that time, how it will play out is every bit as important as what the big secret is.
I:420;287;I found it wonderful, really wonderful.
I:420;288;"Meaning, that M. Night Shyamalan, who thus far has done no wrong with this viewer, may of gotten the praise and attention of his surprise ""twist"" endings to his head and thought that he could throw any half hearted twist our way and it will be boughten."
I:420;289;It is way below his normal ending standards, but the movie up to it works pretty well.
I:420;290;It is more of a romantic, period piece, love story.
I:420;291;What the film has to it's advantage is a supremely superb cast.
I:420;292;There lives scary creatures that lurk in the woods that surround the town.
I:420;293;Walker's daughter Ivy, wonderfully played by Ron Howard's daughter Bryce Dallas Howard, is a lovely and blind young woman who falls for Lucious Hunt, the quiet and somewhat odd son of Alice Hunt(who is played by Sigourney Weaver).
I:420;294;See, I said it had a stellar cast!
I:420;295;Her character must make a decision for her one and only love.
I:420;296;Oscar winner Adrien Brody also stars in the film as the village idiot, a role that he is excellent in, but many may wonder why he chose a supporting role with virtually no lines after winning the Oscar.
I:420;297;Like all of his films, Shyamalan gets a great cast, and he uses them to the fullest, even if not all of them in this movie(sad to say)get much attention.
I:420;298;Shyamalan is definitley a a fine storyteller and filmmaker.
I:420;299;Even when the movies aren't also hitting on all cylinders, they are still fine pieces of craftsmanship that are done like no other director today.
I:420;300;He has a keen eye, and a superb sense of direction of choreography.
I:420;301;He films every scene to it's fullest potential, and always makes the most of the scene and the surroundings it's in.
I:420;302;Like all of his movies, Shyamalan's work is an acquired taste.
I:420;303;But even at his weakest, which this film is, he is still very interesting and creates a masterful show.
I:420;304;At the end of the day, the story drags a bit with very little in the way of scares, but it is a beautiful looking movie, with strong performances, that is slightly tampered with the ending.
I:420;305;Weak Shyamalan is still better than most everything out there.
I:420;306;i've got this great idea for a movie .
I:420;307;And then the plot thickened and got more and more interesting.
I:420;308;Luckily for this one the filmmakers did know what they were doing and I had to smile at the end because it all clicked.
I:420;309;The movie has a lot of great points .
I:420;310;strong actors, great storyline, brilliant plot twists, and quite beautiful scenes.
I:420;311;in short, this is definitely a good movie, one that you won't be disappointed.
I:420;312;Like all of his movies, this is about people, their interaction with eachother and their surroundings, and how view the world around us.
I:420;313;brody was very good but had a realiively small role.
I:420;314;The creature were creepy for about 5 seconds, the setting was impressive considering it consisted of a small village.
I:420;315;to top it all off, the movie's not even scary.
I:420;316;the way it's written, the actors are given little to do.
I:420;317;There is little worth watching in it.
I:420;318;"He must be since his name is above the name of the movie, just like in films like ""Steven Spielbergs ET"", ""Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather"" and ""Martin Scorcese's Taxi Driver""."
I:420;319;Yeah, the acting was good.
I:420;320;The production was very nice.
I:420;321;The movie trailers lead you to believe that this is somewhat of a horror flick .
I:420;322;It is intriguing with all the twists and turns.
I:420;323;It is a good movie .
I:420;324;well worth seeing in the theatres!
I:420;325;Bryce Howard looks as thought she will be a great actress.
I:420;326;I honestly thought it was an interesting and entertaining movie through and through.
I:420;327;I thought that the twists and turns were well.
I:420;328;The Village itself was absolutely beautiful and the glimpse into the past was quite refreshing.
I:420;329;Bryce Howard was as good as advertised and, at the very least, you will be entertained by this one.
I:420;330;Everyone lives a full life in a self.
I:420;331;the acting was surprisingly exceptional.
I:420;332;the sets and period costumes were superb.
I:420;333;although this film may not have achieved the potential in many eyes it is probably one of the best balance and almost believable stories Shyamalan has shown us.
I:420;334;It is more than just a tale as we se how people relate and can relate under stress and great joy.
I:420;335;"The four stages making up the cycle of a monomyth are ""passage: separation."
I:420;336;I was completely captivated by the subtleties.
I:420;337;It's amazing how he makes you become one with the character as you watch.
I:420;338;The acting is fantastic, the people are real.
I:420;339;Bryce Dallas Howard is adorable and develops her character remarkably well.
I:420;340;The parts of some of the elders are also well developed.
I:420;341;In his latest film, The Village, Director M. Night Shyamalan has created yet another chilling thriller with a completely unexpected twist at the end.
I:420;342;Somehow, however, the villagers are able to keep the monsters at bay and continue with their simple existence.
I:420;343;A surprise revealation answers this question, but as in Shyamalan's previous works, the real surprise ending is yet to come.
I:420;344;"Although this is not my favorite Shyamalan film (The Sixth Sense will probably always have that distinction), it is clear that the director has not lost his touch
I:420;345;Definitely recommended for Shyamalan fans as well as anyone who enjoys a subtle, haunting thriller.
I:420;346;What a great family friendly movie.
I:420;347;It is also a great love story.
I:420;348;Mr Shyamalan is a great director.
I:420;349;Great Directors made just beautiful movies.
I:420;350;It goes so much deeper than just a plot twist.
I:420;351;It is a masterpiece that I will be turning over and over in my mind for quite awhile.
I:420;352;My wife and I are both intelligent people, and we figured out the so. called twist halfway through this snoozer.
I:420;353;So one brave lad, who falls in love with the movie's heroine (played by Ron Howard's daughter) volunteers to go into town to get medical supplies.
I:420;354;Their devotion to the fairy tale world is so real that they let their kids die of diseases that could easily be cured in the outside world, rather than risk letting them be contaminated by civilization.
I:420;355;if you've ever dreamt of giving up modern civilization for a 19th century style life, you might find much of this movie charming.
I:420;356;Me, I found it nauseating.
I:420;357;The special feature: Deconstructing the Village shows that the actors seemed to have a real fun time making this movie, but I can't say I've been able to share in that fun.
I:420;358;This will entertain and scare your pre.
I:420;359;keep up the good work.
I:420;360;"The concept is excellent
I:420;361;I was more impressed than I thought I'd be.
I:420;362;M. Night Shyamalan is still my second favorite writer and can still deliver.
I:420;363;I really enjoyed the story, but what really stands out in this movie is the cast of really good actors and the fantastic soundtrack.
I:420;364;"I wanted to like The Village 
I:420;365;it is a thriller that wants you to think about courage, love, fear.
I:420;366;The film delivers a rich story of secrets with the elders knowing everything, fear with the 'creatures' of the forests and love between Ivy, a blind girl and the shy Lucius (Joaquin Phoneix).
I:420;367;i absolutely adored Phoenix' character in this film.
I:420;368;Once again, he gives the audience a flawless performance as the mentally .
I:420;369;While Brody and Phoenix are acclaimed actors and justified too, Bryce Howard who played Ivy was simply fantastic.
I:420;370;It was her love for Lucius that really powered this film.
I:420;371;the cinematography was superb too.
I:420;372;Shyamalan uses light and darkness to great effect in this cinematic effort and it reminds me of 'Girl with a Pearl Earring' because this film is a visual success like that one.
I:420;373;The costumes, the music (amazing violinists!)
I:420;374;and the sombre mood make this film work once again because they create the mysterious aura of the film.
I:420;375;"clever film with an impressive twist and finally glad to see Phoenix getting his time to shine
I:420;376;M. Night Shyamalan has created another excellent film.
I:420;377;He does a good job of telling a story about a society that is closely knit and forced to live within certain rules.
I:420;378;"he does a good job presenting both sides of the closed society
I:420;379;the acting is excellent in this film, and, oddly enough, the actors blend well with the setting.
I:420;380;finally, from a visual standpoint, there are shots in this film that are so beautifully framed, it moves the film from entertainment to visual art.
I:420;381;i commend M. Night Shyamalan for creating this visual masterpiece to go with his excellent script.
I:420;382;Although I will admit to thinking more highly of the director's previous film The Sixth Sense, I thought this movie was well.
I:420;383;I would recommend this movie to all who are looking for a good thrill or who enjoy a well.
I:420;384;I found The Village to be a really good scary movie, although it doesn't take much to scare me, with a really beautiful, funny love story in it.
I:420;385;It told the tale of people who wanted to preserve their way of life in the best way they knew how.
I:420;386;If you don't compare this movie to all of M. Night's other works you will find yourself pleasantly suprised by this film.
I:420;387;Signs, Unbreakable, and the witty, dark, and exciting The Sixth Sense .
I:420;388;surrounding The Village is a mysterious forest that moans and creeks eerily.
I:420;389;"but even WITH this problem, the film was well made
I:420;390;i also have to mention this incredible all.
I:420;391;and the list just keeps going!Not surprisingly, the cast made this film VERY enjoyable.
I:420;392;Sixth Sense was his best.
I:420;393;The villiage is one of those few movies I've bought so I can see it again.
I:420;394;a very special bonus is the remarkable score by James Newton Howard.
I:420;395;I enjoyed the plot and the acting, but this movie wouldn't come close to reaching its emotional impact without the marvelous, emotional music by Mr. Howard, who frequently works on M. Night Shamalan films.
I:420;396;It is gripping to every sense.
I:420;397;"The Sixth Sense was powerful, ""Signs,"" less so, and I look forward to seeing ""The Woman in the Water."""
I:420;398;This is not a horror movie in the true sense of the genre, but is more of a creepy thriller that keeps one's interest and keeps you guessing.
I:420;399;Watch this movie without any expectations and you should be pleasantly surprised.
I:420;400;A talented cast do their best, but are undone by the ultimate auteur of our age, M. Night Shyamalan.
I:420;401;there are people whose films I like, those whose films I admire, those whose work I admire more than I like, and those whose work I like more than I admire.
I:420;402;At the ends of the spectrum are those whose work I both admire and like and those whose work I neither admire nor like.
I:420;403;Despite the flood of negative reviews, I found this movie to be highly engrossing.
I:420;404;The strongest point of the movie, in my opinion, is the metaphor it so aptly creates about contemporary politics/religion.
I:420;405;My personal congratulations to the director for the taking the creative risk of producing a mainstream film that doesn't conform to the formulaic user's manual of Hollywood slasher flicks but insteads utilizes an almost anachronistic, 19th century novelistic approach to film.
I:420;406;The real horror is inside us.
I:420;407;I took it all in and it hit me like a ton of bricks.
I:420;408;It's just fantastic story telling which I know all to well .
I:420;409;It is such a visual feast I didn't pay as much attention to the story as I did to the CG effects.
I:420;410;"for those of you who claim to hate ""The Village"" I say watch it again and let the story take you away."
I:420;411;I promise you will change your opinion.
I:420;412;I wish I could give this more stars than two because I've seen other work of Shyamalan's and I thought it was incredible.
I:420;413;The acting is fine and top notch.
I:420;414;The cinematography is gorgeous, setting vibrant yellows, reds and greens against a gray and brown backdrop.
I:420;415;The first 20 mintues or so are suspenseful and scary.
I:420;416;it's worth watching one time maybe twice.
I:420;417;i give this movie a solid 3 1/2 stars.
I:420;418;I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed 6th Sense.
I:420;419;I thought that was a great movie.
I:420;420;It was full of suspense and good plot movements.
I:420;421;A good adjective to describe these monsters is: cheesy.
I:420;422;But by the end, all of the magic is gone and the imaginative balloon has been popped.
I:420;423;Although NOT a horror movie, which I think many people thought it was, The Village is definitely as good or even better than Signs.
I:420;424;The movie, while not horrifying you, is a very entertaining movie to watch on a dark and stormy night.
I:420;425;Great acting, great story, great twists, great suspense.
I:420;426;lahn) has shown that he is a great story teller.
I:420;427;the film is very looonnngggg.
I:420;428;why?Incidentally, i watched this right after Anacondas 2 and that film was far superior to this one.
I:420;429;the village is night shyamalan best movie so far.
I:420;430;it is a vary suspencefull movie.
I:420;431;this movie is worth seeing.
I:420;432;It's deep and philosophical, and very very clever, and I for one couldn't see the big twist in the story coming.
I:420;433;Brilliant brilliant film, and those who keep banging on about it being rubbish really are not understanding the film at all.
I:420;434;The performances are first rate, and though it took me a while to get into, once things kick off, it really is something you could discuss all day.
I:420;435;the film was'nt too bad but it's not a full five stars, but i have to say the photography is excellent.
I:420;436;byrce howard ron howard's daughter is wonderful in her debut role in this film and i hope to see her more films she's quite lovely.
I:420;437;Overall, it is a good movie though.
I:420;438;briefly: every Shyamalan fan (and anyone open to movie twists) should see this movie.
I:420;439;This is an artsy drama.
I:420;440;Give it Shyamalan a chance.
I:420;441;Just like a normal human has, so has Shyamalan.
I:420;442;i found my myself hoping that my favorite modern director could right himself.
I:420;443;"oh P. s., It's a tie: M. Night's best movie is ""Sixth Sense,"" ""Unbreakable,"" and ""Signs."""
I:420;444;now I was so looking forward to getting The Village as it is a fantastic movie and I see on the page here that there is only a DOlby Digital 5.1 EX track listed.
I:420;445;That is quite surprising and I am hoping someone may read this review that is in someway connected to Vista and may suggest they release another version.
I:420;446;it's because DTS audio is far superior.
I:420;447;A small village that lies in a valley surrounded on all sides by a thick wood seems to be an idyllic and beautiful place to settle.
I:420;448;Meanwhile, a love triangle is forming amidst the youth of the village.
I:420;449;I would recommend this movie more for romance lovers than horror fans.
I:420;450;I hope, although I doubt, that M. Night will make a sequel.
I:420;451;She really made the movie.
I:420;452;i could see her becoming a big Hollywood leading lady.
I:420;453;it was a really great movie with a nice morale, and it is very unpredictible but its not ridiculous, its a movie that makes u think about the society and everything.
I:420;454;in my opinion the village was the best movie of 2004 along with million dollar baby
I:420;455;I thought it was excellent.
I:420;456;It has such a twist.
I:420;457;It kept me very on edge and excited.
I:420;458;M. Night Shyamalan's films are about surprise endings, having the rug pulled out from under us.
I:420;459;The movie works best as a study in lighting, acting and cinematography as all are done very well.
I:420;460;Bryce Dallas Howard as Ivy is always believable and somehow we easily empathize with her even though she is written one dimensionally.
I:420;461;"The included documentary ""Deconstructing The Village"" (the most substantial extra at just under 30 minutes) covers the production in a brisk yet satisfying manner as long as you overlook all the numerous statements about how much like a family the entire cast became."
I:420;462;Production values rates 3 stars.
I:420;463;"I actually cared about what happened to ""Ivy"" in the woods."
I:420;464;The moral is trite and the acting is par, but the last twenty minutes of this film is a compelling homage to all the great love stories.
I:420;465;If this film weren't so darn derivative (there is already a novel with similar themes and a poem with a few of the characters' names in it) I would credit M. Night Shyamalan for presenting us a true tale of moral dilemma.
I:420;466;There are boogiemen in the woods.
I:420;467;Colors are used as symbols and ultimately the town elders are faced with what they fear the most.
I:420;468;The film is about their innocence too and whether it is really possible to stay innocent when isolated.
I:420;469;Shayamalan is the smartest, wittiest writter/director out there, and what you will get if you go to see this movie is exactly that, a very intelligent, engaging piece of cinima.
I:420;470;the acting in this movie was brilliant.
I:420;471;Absolutely gorgeous, which could be a draw to this film all by itself.
I:420;472;I guess the reason I enjoyed the movie so much was because I went into the theatre expecting a good drama.
I:420;473;And that's exactly what I got.
I:420;474;The story was very interesting to me.
I:420;475;I enjoyed the relationships between the villagers, especially Lucious and Ivy.
I:420;476;the scary moments just added to the drama.
I:420;477;I loved all the twists to the story.
I:420;478;but still a great movie.
I:420;479;One thing we both agreed on was it was a great story.
I:420;480;It has been years since an ending surprised me in this way.
I:420;481;Not scary but in a way that has you talking to friends and family about the unique story.
I:420;482;"Suffice it to say that most fans of movies like ""Signs"", ""The Sixth Sense"", and ""The Others"" will probably like it."
I:420;483;The cast is key to making it work and do a wonderful job in their roles.
I:420;484;I recommend this movie, and be sure you watch it at least twice before decidng what you think about it.
I:420;485;I felt the movie was definitely deserving of attention.
I:420;486;the film, has many other demensions of meaning than what is on the surface.
I:420;487;or even on the human level of denial of our rights and desires as human beings.
I:420;488;it may take a more subtle approach to that fear.
I:420;489;Cults are very subtle in their brainwashing techniques.
I:420;490;It is done slowly and subtly.
I:420;491;And people should keep this in mind.
I:420;492;There are alot of things to consider and do when working on such a large project.
I:420;493;see it for what it is.
I:420;494;I was surprised and I did have a couple scared moments there.
I:420;495;I was very surprised to be completely on the edge of my seat by the performance of Bryce Dallas Howard (Ivy).
I:420;496;At first I honestly didn't expect much from her character, but hers is the one I remember best from the movie and the reason I watched it again.
I:420;497;It is a great break out performance for her.
I:420;498;Go into it with an open mind.
I:420;499;There's nothing behind the shroud of this film that is worth any praise.
I:420;500;Great performance by Joaquin Phoenix and William Hurt.
I:420;501;the previews had hyped this movie up so much that it looked amazing!
I:420;502;"some people who I talked to loved it
I:420;503;It is one you will have to decipher on your own.
I:420;504;I love a movie I can't figure out the ending to half way into it.
I:420;505;Really good movie and like my dreams, it is all explained at the end so you are no left hanging!
I:420;506;Joaquin Phoenix was great as always.
I:420;507;Bryce Dallas Howard was fantastic in her film debut.
I:420;508;Her father should be proud.
I:420;509;i want to see the movie again, after knowing the twist, to see if I can catch any hints to the twist.
I:420;510;i love that M. Night is keeping his movies local.
I:420;511;He's the pride of Philly.
I:420;512;I love to see where he pops up in his movies.You need to pay attention carefully to the movie, if you do then it shouldn't be too confusing to watch and you might just enjoy it like I did.
I:420;513;the only other good thing that I can say is, The Village was good enough to keep you talking about it long after it's over.
I:420;514;It is magical and poetic and suspenseful all at the same time.
I:420;515;He has a nack for finding the right camera angles and shots that pack as much punch as the characters themselves.
I:420;516;This film is more of a subtle romance film that delves into human character and the things we will do to protect those most dear to us.
I:420;517;The plot revolves around them and the characters dance on strings pulled by M. Night in order to tell their story with the most impact.
I:420;518;Phoenix gives a stellar performance as Lucious, a quiet young man who loves with an intensity that is almost painful.
I:420;519;She is a strong woman posessed of a firm will and iron hard determination.
I:420;520;The actors have done a superb job, adding another layer to this wonderful movie.
I:420;521;For two hours you are immersed in a world that seems real.
I:420;522;M. Night has a way of making us care for the characters, making us feel the emotional tension and sorrow and apprehension at the proper times in the movie.
I:420;523;I suppose that is the mark of a master filmaker.
I:420;524;This movie is truly one of the best that I have seen in years, literally.
I:420;525;A masterpiece of scenery, visual impact, character study, and emotional manipulation.
I:420;526;Truly a treat for any film lover and the perfect way to spend a summer evening.
I:420;527;This movie is such a metaphor for most people's lives.
I:420;528;that it is a constant inspiration for me in discussing the complexities of our modern lives.
I:420;529;Watch it, and watch your reaction to it.
I:420;530;I love movies that change me and that invite reviewing.
I:420;531;"After having seen ""Unbreakable,"" ""Sixth Sense,"" and ""Lady of the Water,"" I've become a fan of this film's director."
I:420;532;"Though this is my least favorite of them, his work so exceeds my thoughts on other movies that this is still a ""5 star"" movie for me."
I:420;533;paced, but I enjoy the leisurely story.
I:420;534;Bryce Howard is an excellent actress.
I:420;535;I look forward to seeing more from her!
I:420;536;Wordy, but intriguing and unique.
I:420;537;plus, the costumes were amazing.
I:420;538;sure The Sixth Sense was better, blah blah blah, this one is underrated.
I:420;539;Like M. Night Shyamalan's other movies, there's a whole lot going on .
I:420;540;well, not necessarily irrelevant, but insignificant to the grand scheme of the tale.
I:420;541;in short, this is really an exceptional film if you're paying attention.
I:420;542;i thought it was kind of cool when she hopped the fence and met the guard, that put a twist.
I:420;543;But it is definitely not a horror.
I:420;544;M. Night Shamylan you did it again you dog :) Hahah, no, but it was good and completely unexpected as his previous work.
I:420;545;Stating the good stuff in the movie: the acting and the cinematography.
I:420;546;M. Night Shyamalan is a highly original director who makes cameos in all his own films.
I:420;547;Shyamalan is also a highly original writer who borrows all his ideas from old Twilight Zone episodes and other assorted sources.
I:420;548;Homages are something that great directors do, and this proves Shyamalan is a great director.
I:420;549;This infliction of random fear is actually profoundly symbolic of Shyamalan's homage to himself and his profound ability to impose random fears free from the constraints of meaning.
I:420;550;well you might see the twist coming otherwise.
I:420;551;she has a bright future ahead of her.
I:420;552;The huge successes of The Sixth Sense and Signs have set the bar so high for himself that it is almost impossible for him to reach it.
I:420;553;He may be a director whose first film is the end of his career, if his future projects follow the footsteps of The Village.
I:420;554;Bryce Dallas Howard is the only character that really delievers a good performance.
I:420;555;M. Night Shyamalan does a great job of telling the story and the setup of the village is amazing.
I:420;556;Shyamalan knows how to make a suspenseful scene and he knows how to write a good movie.
I:420;557;M. Night's trend has been to do one good movie, then one average, then one good, then one average, so hopefully the next one will be really good.
I:420;558;Everyone knows to expect a twist.
I:420;559;Based on his previous movies, you know that there is going to be a surprising ending.
I:420;560;it is a good movie, for a lot of reasons, but it's certainly not without its faults.
I:420;561;The key to any good film is a sympathetic lead character that you can get behind and feel for, hope for and root for.
I:420;562;to me, is the saving grace of the film.
I:420;563;ivy Walker is a young blind girl, innocent, good.
I:420;564;She is member of a small village that is kept from traveling outside their borders by a band of creatures that inhabit the woods.
I:420;565;But, I will say that the suspense is good.
I:420;566;Yet, I enjoyed THE VILLAGE when I went to see it.
I:420;567;In fact, It is one of my favorites of Shyamalan's.
I:420;568;i like character driven movies.
I:420;569;I like movies that build good character and then build suspense, thrills and action on top of that.
I:420;570;how far would you go?I loved this film.
I:420;571;I love the way Shyamalan captures the facial expressions and feelings of his characters, and while I guessed the outcome of the film, it was still great to sit and watch.
I:420;572;Which is too bad, since he is surely a wonderful talent.
I:420;573;I hope he will see the light and turn his hand to something substantial and worthwhile.
I:420;574;adrian Brody and Joaquin Phoenix are amazing.
I:420;575;Once I did, I really enjoyed this movie.
I:420;576;Bryce Dallas Howard did an incredible job with this role.
I:420;577;i thought M. Night Shyamalan did a great job of giving you creepy glimpses of a rather unique creature, before finally revealing it completely.
I:420;578;First off, the soundtrack for this movie is amazing.
I:420;579;The cinematography and background is beautiful.
I:420;580;The story is thrilling and touching, and there's quite a deep moral of the story, for those with ears to hear and eyes to see.
I:420;581;But it was original and Night tried so I'll give it two stars.
I:420;582;It is entertaining and keeps you on the edge of your seat.
I:420;583;"M. Night Shyamalan is the mastermind behind ""Signs"" and ""The Sixth Sense"", but to me his true genius is showcased in his latest project, ""The Village""."
I:420;584;I, however, personally found the plot rather interesting and the movie as a whole to be original and unpredictable with unforeseen twists.
I:420;585;Andrien Brody also did an amazing job at his portrayal of a grown man (Noah Percy) with a child.
I:420;586;like disorder, and Joaquin Phoenix as the brave Lucius Hunt who dared to cross into the forbidden woods, as well as being the silent love interest of the innocent young Ivy.
I:420;587;star cast was well chosen (I really felt kinship amongst the people, which made it all the more convincing), and the score by James Newton Howard was simple yet haunting.
I:420;588;"m. Night Shyamalan (director of ""The Sixth Sense,"" ""Unbreakable,"" and ""Signs,"") brings us an intriguing period piece about love, jealousy, and how far people are willing to go when driven by fear."
I:420;589;the film has an interesting (and creepy) atmosphere to it .
I:420;590;a characteristic few movies these days are able to accomplish.
I:420;591;up profile shot of them talking, and in between their faces you see a grey fog covering the vast field in front of them .
I:420;592;But since this is his fourth major film, and Shyamalan is now known for putting plot twists in his stories, people go into it immediately starting to second.
I:420;593;"as much as I enjoyed ""The Village,"" I think Shyamalan should stop making films with plot twists for a while and just make some good movies with good stories."
I:420;594;"Otherwise, he may very well come to be known as ""M. Night Shyamalamadingdong."
I:420;595;Bryce Dallas Howard's diary was an interesting feature.
I:420;596;scenes featurettes (with the option of playing them all at once) that give us an interesting look at the production of the film.
I:420;597;"Also included are some production stills, as well as an amusing old home video movie Shyamalan did when he was young that looks strikingly similar to that of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" Highly enjoyable."
I:420;598;the last twist in the plot is the revelation that the town founders created their village to escape the crimes and injustices of our world.
I:420;599;sis and stilted actions are sure to please fans.
I:420;600;Good idea but could of been wrapped up in 30 minutes, also he should of really had genuine monsters and could of really developed what they were and why.
I:420;601;M. Night Shyamalan is in a way my kind of director: he writes and directs stories that I'm actually interested in.
I:420;602;After the rebound success of Signs from the underperforming.
I:420;603;underrated Unbreakable, we have the Village which boasts a stellar cast, an intriguing premise but several mistteps that make it less than what it should've been.
I:420;604;One villager loves another but he's in love with her sister who also has feelings for him and his mother has an attraction to the girl's father.
I:420;605;"Mind you, this ain't incest, far from it, but you're like ""wow, lot of loving in this village""."
I:420;606;Casting is excellent with tons of theatre actors and either Oscar, Emmy or Tony winning/nominated actors and they give the film an added credibility.
I:420;607;I know a lot of people hate this movie, but I really enjoyed it.
I:420;608;Besides, this was a gift.
I:420;609;Bryce Dallas Howard is absolutely drop dead beautiful.
I:420;610;The film is pretty good too.
I:420;611;The acting was great, the lighting and mood was superb, but what happened to the scary aspect of a horror film?
I:420;612;So I got this movie thinking hey Shyamalan's other movies are pretty good.
I:420;613;This movie could possibly be the most dissapointing movie I have ever seen.
I:420;614;I will let the movie do that for you!!!!!
I:420;615;But I understand that to a degree.
I:420;616;What I got, however, turned out to be one of the best movies.
I:420;617;He has an impressive track record.
I:420;618;the Sixth Sense was superb, Unbreakable was a bit slow but still not bad, and Signs was both a decent alien movie and an excellent story of a man whose faith stagnates and then is revived.
I:420;619;He proves as masterful an artist here.
I:420;620;the brilliant, moving debut of Bryce Dallas Howard as the blind Ivy Elizabeth Walker, the spunky, pretty leading lady of the film.
I:420;621;Watching the film it is amazing to think that Shyamalan introduced himself after seeing her in a stage production of Shakespeare's As You Like It, and landed her in her first major film role.
I:420;622;Her performance is stunning, and I will be disappointed if she does not earn an Oscar for it.
I:420;623;She deserves every ounce of it.
I:420;624;spoken Lucius Hunt, once again proves that he is a versatile actor.
I:420;625;This was the first film in which I had seen Adrien Brody, and I found his performance as mentally unstable Noah Percy to be quite fine, and without having seen it I can imagine why he got an Oscar for his role in the Pianist.
I:420;626;ok, I take it partly back.
I:420;627;good suspense, then you just might be interested.
I:420;628;You must be prepared, however, to head into a moving, entertaining, stirring.
I:420;629;love story, filled with good characters, excellent directing, and some good questions to think and talk about.
I:420;630;Hilary Hahn, the featured violinist, struts her stuff in some really wonderful violin themes.
I:420;631;It is very classically based stuff, and extremely good.
I:420;632;which is always a plus.
I:420;633;side, this is an excellent film, and perhaps Shyamalan's best to date.
I:420;634;my advice to you is see it now.
I:420;635;I hope that, as friends speak to friends, this film's theatre take will increase.
I:420;636;"M. Night Shyamalan perpetrated a fantastic ruse in his movie ""The Village""."
I:420;637;The Sixth Sense was a superb, suspenseful flick.
I:420;638;Signs was a good solid film but a step down.
I:420;639;shyamalan should venture out of his beloved Pennsylvania and avail himself of the talent Hollywood has to offer.
I:420;640;I just have an ability to read narrative arcs and see where things are going.
I:420;641;this film had potential to be as great a work of art as that other great fictive The Village.
I:420;642;I've given up on him as a film director, but I'm sure he's got his next twist film already in the works.
I:420;643;thirds are interesting and well.
I:420;644;crafted but are undermined by a silly reveal and deterioration of the character development so compelling earlier in the film.
I:420;645;Balancing a four for the first two.
I:420;646;It's worth watching for Bryce Dallas Howard's breakthrough performance and because there are few, if any, movies quite like 'The Village'.
I:420;647;I didn't really enjoy it at all.
I:420;648;The second time I watched it in my history class, and had to take notes on it, and EVERYTHING makes sense, and it's a pretty clever movie.
I:420;649;See?After seeing this movie again, I really like it.
I:420;650;provoking ideas about society and our reactions to it.
I:420;651;director Shyamalan builds his world beautifully with a wonderful use of color (marvelously captured by cinematographer Roger Deakins) as his characters portray their horror of the known and unknown.
I:420;652;Her Ivy is the heart of the film and she is more than up to the challenge.
I:420;653;She's nice to look at, too.
I:420;654;This change is jarring, and could undoubtedly have been done better, but the movie is rewarding in its own way.
I:420;655;"This is definitely going to be a film that will seem better on the second viewing as all (well, most) of Shyamalan's do
I:420;656;"Let me say this about ""The Village"", while there are surprises in the movie, you will likely see them coming a mile away."
I:420;657;It has a soft and poetic soul.
I:420;658;it is definitely worth seeing and all the actors do fine work.
I:420;659;Her performance is powerful and is the light of the movie.
I:420;660;the extras on the disk are quite interesting in how the movie was made.
I:420;661;Shyamalan really does go all out to create the world in which his movie exists.
I:420;662;And I enjoyed his discussion of how he relies on sound to create so much of the mood in his movies.
I:420;663;after seeing it i thought it was the cheesiest funniest movie i've ever seen!!!
I:420;664;M, buddy, you had such a good premise, and fifty minutes in, I was going to my friends, this kicks ::Tail::, and then, Boom, a major char.
I:420;665;I am going to give you a couple of stars for those first 50 minutes, those were excellent.
I:420;666;way out of my skull(Reason I loved Sixth Sense and Signs.
I:420;667;Nope then it got good when they found there sheep and cattle torn and ripped apart.
I:420;668;I waited so long to review this movie, because I figured that in time it would come into its own with audiences, and I think that time has definitely come today.
I:420;669;office hits, the artistry and originality of THE VILLAGE now seems more worthy of appreciation than it did upon its initial release.
I:420;670;"without giving away any of the fabled ""twists,"" this much I can tell you: a small village of Amish."
I:420;671;The town elders, William Hurt, Brendan Gleeson and Sigourney Weaver amongst them, maintain a sense of benevolent authority over all.

I:420;673;form version of the sensational yet deceptive trailers that attracted moviegoers to this film in droves.
I:420;674;and since that is as much as I dare say about the movie itself, let's turn to those trailers for a moment.
I:420;675;Which is very similar to the quandary that Orson Welles must've found himself in when he exploded into the cinematic firmament with his masterpiece, CITIZEN KANE.
I:420;676;gothic thriller that held as many surprises as that previous effort.
I:420;677;The rest you can figure out for yourself.)
I:420;678;There are many great actors and some beautifully modulated performances here from all involved.
I:420;679;drawer rendering of the decent.
I:420;680;dutiful Lucius, the acting world got a stunning introduction to a remarkable new talent.
I:420;681;Bryce Dallas Howard, daughter of prolific filmmaker Ron, made her unforgettable debut here as Ivy, daughter of Hurt's town elder, and nearly unrequited love interest of Lucius.
I:420;682;She commands every scene she's in with graceful restraint and natural charisma, and she deserves every accolade she received for this performance.
I:420;683;the bulk of the movie actually belongs to these three fine actors, and THAT'S as much as I can say about their part in it.
I:420;684;I can't promise you that you will absolutely love it now, but you may make some surprising discoveries you didn't before, and might even come to like it just a little bit.
I:420;685;to the few film buffs who bought into the negative hype and didn't see it at all, give it a shot.
I:420;686;this movie shows an attempt at doing so, it is not preachy, it tells a good story and is more relevant than ever in regards to recent events in our society
I:420;687;Now that all the dust has settled, The Village deserves another look.
I:420;688;This extra explores various aspects of the production, from casting to editing and sound.
I:420;689;For standard press kit material it is refreshingly substantial.
I:420;690;Bryce's Diary features the young actress reading from her diary that she kept while making the movie.
I:420;691;This one is a cute recreation of the famous opening scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark with M. Night playing Indiana Jones.
I:420;692;I thought it was a superb film, though I'll admit that the Colonial dialogue was slightly flawed (but remember.
I:420;693;Anyway, the twist was shocking, though everyone knew one was coming thanks to Shayamalan's previous films.
I:420;694;I thought the best performance in the film was by Bryce Dallas Howard, Ron Howard's daughter, who was absolutely phenomenal in her breakthrough role as Ivy.
I:420;695;She deserves an Oscar for her intense portrayal of a blind girl who risks everything for the one she loves.
I:420;696;You should see this film, it is a lot easier to understand than the other reviewers make it out to be, and a lot better.
I:420;697;let's try this: It's a gothic romance about damaged people.
I:420;698;"Since precious few movies ever break upon the boundaries of serious thought, since soulfulness is almost entirely absent in Hollywood today, and since this movie has the courage to declare that ""the whole world bows before love"": 5 stars."
I:420;699;hour life support system for a twist ending to appreciate that there's a lot more to this movie than its concluding surprise.
I:420;700;People go scatterbrained trying to elude the dictates of our culture today, for instance, with its violence, its corporate intrusions, its governmental omnipresence, and here we saw a successful experiment in utopian existence set in 1890, and I found that wonderful.
I:420;701;I also loved the scenery, the muted color schemes, the attention to period detail and to the agrarian life.
I:420;702;I liked The Village from the first day I saw it, and continue to think well of it even now.
I:420;703;The price was wonderful and I paid just barely over $5.00 for it.
I:420;704;Great movie, filled with just the right amount of mystery.
I:420;705;My copy was used, but it was in excellent condition.
I:420;706;goosebumps), ends up ruining everything that Shyamalan works so hard to establish in the films outset.
I:420;707;The acting in this film is top.
I:420;708;notch, and the chemistry between stars Bryce Dallas Howard and Joaquin Phoenix is undeniable.
I:420;709;Adrian Brody is successful in portraying the village handicap and Jayne Atkinson is wonderfully used as Ivy's (Howard) sister.
I:420;710;tingling good time and instead serving up a romance of sorts, but I can't get too upset for this romantic drama is actually a very good one.
I:420;711;It explores important questions about the structure of societies, cultures, and subcultures and looks at the myths used to perpetuate the immune system of groups and our participation in them.
I:420;712;With its archetypical images of town vs forrest, watchtower and boundaries, color as uniform or taboo,and some subtle characterizations of repressed fear and desire, it is easily one of the best films of the year.
I:420;713;The porch scene with Howard and Phoenix ( will you dance at our wedding?)
I:420;714;is remarkably sensual and has to be one of the most understated romantic scenes to come out of the movies since Bogart and Hepburn.
I:420;715;But I really enjoyed the acting, plot, and filming of this movie.
I:420;716;I think this may be William Hurt's best performance to date.
I:420;717;And of course, Adrien Brody and Joaquin Phoenix performed brilliantly.
I:420;718;Brody was a very convincing love.
I:420;719;smitten (that friendship kind of love, I assume), mentally retarded young man who fancied the beautiful Ivy Walker.
I:420;720;i actually thought the ending was very interesting.
I:420;721;This movie really makes one examine those issues.
I:420;722;this is also a movie that examines one.
I:420;723;this movie is worth the watch.
I:420;724;It is a perfect, picturesque village situated in a peaceful valley.
I:420;725;Children run and play, men and women spend the day laughing and telling jokes.
I:420;726;Something is happening in the forest.
I:420;727;Aside from the suspense, of course, it is the acting that carries this film.
I:420;728;With superb acting and an intense delivery, how could you not want to see this film?Be brave.
I:420;729;Another great film by the master of keeping you on the edge of your seat.
I:420;730;Good wholesome scary m. Night movie
I:420;731;I had heard bad things about The Village, and was seriously considering not seeing it, but it was worth it!
I:420;732;The movie you will find is a far more layered, character driven morality tale.
I:420;733;If you can accept a romance movie by M. Night Shyamalan, you will find ample rewards in the rich acting of the two leads, including newcomer Bryce Dallas Howard and Joaquin Phoenix.
I:420;734;Expectations influence how a movie is received.
I:420;735;both movies, through masterful trailers, promised their audience something big.
I:420;736;shyamalan is an interesting director: interesting in that he takes mainstream cinematic tropes and turns them on their head, puts them under an electron microscope, boring into their guts.
I:420;737;"He did it in ""Sixth Sense"" with ghosts, again in ""Unbreakable"" with superheroes, again in ""Signs"" with alien invasion, and does so once more with ""The Village"", which chronicles our fear of death and the unknown."

I:420;740;All is well, until, as always happens in fairy tales, somebody breaks the Rules.
I:420;741;"i think people want to be deliciously, creepily spooked
I:420;742;Yes it's brilliant and scary and moving and more than a little sad.
I:420;743;I'll sum this movie up for you.
I:420;744;They create a town identical to how towns existed 150 years ago so they can live that lifestyle.
I:420;745;they move themselves there and raise families.
I:420;746;"And to keep their children from learning the secret they create these ""monsters"" to terrorize the children into staying close to the town."
I:420;747;As some of the children become adults they learn this secret so that they can help keep the rest of the citizens in the town.
I:420;748;As you can see from the variations in the reviews, people are all over the map with this one.
I:420;749;not only did I enjoy it the first time, it's the kind of movie I can watch over and over.
I:420;750;the soundtrack is excellent, and the use of sound is masterfully done.
I:420;751;It's funny how people will on the one hand complain that a movie is too predictable, or lacks imagination, etc.
I:420;752;Some people are never happy.
I:420;753;The characters in the film are excellent.
I:420;754;The pace of the film is good.
I:420;755;M. Night has a great imagination, and he is a masterful storyteller.
I:420;756;I hope he continues to make fantastic movies.

I:420;765;It's a scary existence but there is peace, so it might just be a trade off?
I:420;766;If you overlook its flaws, what you'll find is a movie that speaks to any audience.
I:420;767;The scene is alive with energy and light.
I:420;768;She fills her character with color.
I:420;769;Howard enchants from the very first frame and commands the audience's eyes.
I:420;770;Watch out pop a couple years from now we could have another Oscar winner in the family.
I:420;771;the other bright spot in the film is Adrien Brody (The Pianist) he portrays Noah the town retard.
I:420;772;Man did he have a good time.
I:420;773;There is energy in his portrayal that just gushes with enthusiasm.
I:420;774;at its heart THE VILLAGE is social commentary for both sides of an argument.
I:420;775;Isn't it wonderful that they created a utopia?
I:420;776;As for the patented surprise ending, it works.
I:420;777;If you give the movie its due you'll be satisfied.
I:420;778;I smelled it from a mile away and still took a lot away from the movie.
I:420;779;It will keep you talking and that's a good thing.
I:420;780;"Some interesting plot twists are revealed which helps make sense of the overall situation
I:420;781;there is some good suspense built up with the settings and the acting contributing to the whole process.
I:420;782;the Village is a truly beautiful film which tells one of the finest love stories in many years.
I:420;783;The performances by all are top.
I:420;784;The dialogue and usage of symbolism are exceptional, yet only part of the movie's many charms.
I:420;785;This makes for a much more satisfying picture for those who like to think, as is the case with all of Night's films (save perhaps Lady in the Water, which is questoinable).
I:420;786;few motion pictures capture the depths of mystery the way The Village does.
I:420;787;night is a master at revealing the right details at the right times.

I:420;791;Despite this, The Village is very intense indeed.
I:420;792;I loved every moment of it.
I:420;793;Perhaps the best feature is how it shifts perspectives in mid.

I:420;797;There's maybe enough story to fill a half.
I:420;798;I will definitely do business with them again.
I:420;799;The village itself is a well.
I:420;800;constructed movie setting, and the period costumes and dialogue are very well done.
I:420;801;the actors do a good job and William Hurt, as the village's patriarch, is well.
I:420;802;overall, it's a decent flick with some scares to it.
I:420;803;All I knew was that it was a Shyamalan film and that it would have a twist ending.
I:420;804;I truly feel that The Village is an excellent story and conveys deep messages about what people are like now as opposed to what they were probably like back then.
I:420;805;M. Night stayed true to his calling and crafted an unbelievable story that I will see again and again.
I:420;806;The acting is good, as it always is with his movies, the score was amazing.
I:420;807;Thats all thats good in this film.
I:420;808;I really hope his next movie is much better than this.
I:420;809;The children born there might never know the truth.
I:420;810;This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat and will also keep you guessing.
I:420;811;This was one of the best movies I've seen in years .
I:420;812;"Anyone looking for a gore fest or a ""Jason"" redux should look elsewhere, but they'd overlook a spectacular film in the process."
I:420;813;It seems subtle at first, but when you consider the layers upon layers that have ripple effects, it's really quite extraordinary.
I:420;814;And so many others, all brilliant.)
I:420;815;The film work is exquisite, the actors are impeccable (and quite a cast.
I:420;816;Joaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody, William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, and Bryce Howard in a stunning debut), and the story quite intriguing.
I:420;817;I highly recommend this film.
I:420;818;Loved the scenery from that era.
I:420;819;It definitely left you in suspense.
I:420;820;It's a Hitchcock craft lensing, very slow on details, reveling in the blocking for imagery, and the beauty of a simpler times, a style of life gone by.
I:420;821;You see this one coming the whole way.
I:420;822;i enjoy this moving, the imagery is stunning, rarely achieved in any film coming out of Hollywood.
I:420;823;M. Night is a virtuoso as a cinematographer.
I:420;824;And he teases, lures and torments you into expecting so much, thinking this is great.
I:420;825;four stars for the sheer beauty and the heart of a storyteller.
I:420;826;Very worth repeat watching, but expect to feel let down each time.
I:420;827;The beginning of the movie goes on and on and on and nothing exciting happens for a long time.
I:420;828;okay, the bashing has ceased.
I:420;829;The main actress is excellent 2.
I:420;830;Joaquin's few scenes are pretty good 3.
I:420;831;It is intense, but the acting and cinematography is beautiful!
I:420;832;This movie is definitely Shyamalan's best yet.
I:420;833;paced modern movies that they can't handle a simple, well told story.
I:420;834;The movie does a great job of capturing the essence of the human feelings that drive each of the characters to do what they do, and overall I found it very satisfying, and believable.
I:420;835;Also, the script contains a lot of great lines, where it is not just what is said, but the peculiar way that it is said, that gives us deeper insight into how the characters' see the nature of their lives.
I:420;836;This is definitely one of my favorite movies in recent years.
I:420;837;After watching it I was able to put it all together.
I:420;838;In the tradition of the Signs and his critically acclaimed supernatural thriller The Sixth Sense, M. Night Shyamalan's latest clearly is a moving tribute to the compassion and love of mankind.
I:420;839;dropping twists dished out in his maiden effort but The Village benefits from classy direction and first.
I:420;840;rate acting from a seasoned ensemble.
I:420;841;"Bryce Dallas Howard, debuting as blind girl Ivy Walker, sparkles with courage and grit
I:420;842;Supporting cast Sigourney Weaver and William Hurt is under.
I:420;843;Shyamalan's pace may be slow in the first half of the film, but the atmospheric tingles coupled with James Newton Howard's haunting score will keep you awake.
I:420;844;M. Night Shyamalan, while only slightly holding onto his knack for jolts and screams, has created a film that is a tribute to his maturation as a filmmaker.
I:420;845;while 'The Sixth Sense' still remains a better work, both in its unexpectedness and it's simple yet amazing production, 'The Village' has its merits.
I:420;846;as one would expect, the cinematography and direction are gripping and superb.
I:420;847;And the emanated knowledge that a twist is on its way does wonders for eliminating suspense .
I:420;848;however, Interesting camera angles and what seems to be normal editing, create a beautiful town of people.
I:420;849;They are completely engulfed in their lives in a small meadow surrounded by a forest that they do not enter.
I:420;850;They are na?ve, innocent, happy.
I:420;851;They are part of a community, a village.
I:420;852;though the film seems empty and shallow, thinking back has made me realize the multiple levels on which Shyamalan speaks.
I:420;853;It is a beautiful film and I would gladly see `The Village' again, and that is a true testament to the greatness of filmmaking.
I:420;854;I am a big fan of M. Night's movies.
I:420;855;I went to see The Village today anticipating another great thriller that I've come to expect from this director.
I:420;856;Maybe not something as great as the Sixth Sense (one of my favorites), but still, something entertaining.
I:420;857;The way the commercials and trailers deceivingly play up this movie, it seems really scary and really suspenseful.
I:420;858;The creatures themselves seemed cool and frightening upon a first glimpse, but they turned out to be a dopish farce.
I:420;859;This is coming from a big fan of this guy's work.
I:420;860;If you want to watch a good and actually scary film, re.
I:420;861;This movies is definitely a favorite of mine but not for the usual reasons.
I:420;862;The Village is more about purity of heart and the sacrifices made for love than terror or regret.
I:420;863;I love the concepts and values interwoven in the strange plots of the director, who has become famous for twists and shocks.
I:420;864;I love the characters, the score, and the plot and hope that everyone will give this movie a chance.
I:420;865;First of all I think that M. Night Shymalan is a very good director.
I:420;866;He did a very good job directing a movie that had a very simple plot.
I:420;867;But besides that this is a very good movie.
I:420;868;It is very well written.
I:420;869;I thought that the best part of the movie was the acting Juaquin Pheonix and Bryce (Who played Ivy Walker) did a great job.
I:420;870;The performances in this film are first rate, and the story unfolds at a very pleasing pace.
I:420;871;is some of the most amazingly beautiful music you will ever hear .
I:420;872;it fit the picture like a glove, and was integral in making this one of the most fulfulling movies I have seen in quite some time.
I:420;873;hes talented and i'm sure his next film will be a good one.
I:420;874;"M. Night Shyamalan(writer/director), acheiving greatness on his film ""The Sixth Sense"" with 6 Oscar nominations has yet to rekindle that type of inspiration with his three films that followed: ""Unbreakable,"" ""Signs,"" and now ""The Village."""
I:420;875;There are people that expect Night to produce a great twist in every movie.
I:420;876;if however you can understand Night, then definitely watch this movie.
I:420;877;You will be in for a treat.
I:420;878;Similar as to Signs, Night is evolving both as a writer and a director.
I:420;879;STORY is becoming the main thing and .
I:420;880;Night is by far one of the most original writers and one of the most talented directors we have seen in decades.
I:420;881;Signs and The Village are a proof of this.
I:420;882;The twist can be guessed early on and it is also revealed half.
I:420;883;it's all about a GREAT story, storytelling at its best!
I:420;884;Mr. Ebert finds Spiderman 2 amazing, but this movie .
I:420;885;i hope Night will still be able to make the movies he likes and I wish him to find the power to ignore critics that never created anything.
I:420;886;I am sure his genius has more to show and am looking forward to his next movie.
I:420;887;Watch this movie for what it is: a truly excellent drama with a completely original story and brilliant ideas!
I:420;888;The story is so intense and immersive that when you finally find out [spoiler alert here] you're like WATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT.
I:420;889;This is a good movie.
I:420;890;Bryce Dallas Howard did very well in the movie, even though there were times where she didn't act blind.
I:420;891;She gave a very excellent performance.
I:420;892;Though I didn't find it to be too scary, it had a good dramatic pull.
I:420;893;M. Night Shyamalan is an incredible director.
I:420;894;He really has a knack creating films that will make you jump in your seat while keeping them with a PG.13 rating.
I:420;895;He wraps a blanket of fear around viewers by combining suspense and expectation with jarring music and sound effects.
I:420;896;And he drives his movies along with eerie story lines that are mysterious and always end with a twist.
I:420;897;i loved all of M. Night's previous films, and I really thought this one was going to be great, but I was deceived.
I:420;898;He is, after all, only human.
I:420;899;i loved the concept for this film.
I:420;900;In fact, I loved this film right up to about the middle of it, when my friend whispered to me his thoughts about what would happen.
I:420;901;That's right, there are two twists.
I:420;902;This movie is well written and very well acted and I enjoyed it right up until the end (or ending).
I:420;903;perfect for the fantasy the director wants to weave.
I:420;904;The cast is ernest and they sell the premise very well.
I:420;905;a movie I liked .
I:420;906;Let's call it a nice little movie with some good acting and an ending with a twist.
I:420;907;Even if you're unfamiliar with that Rod Serling scenario, you'll have a good chance of guessing the surprise.
I:420;908;"When I learned that the time period for the movie was going to be 19th Century, I knew right away what the surprise ending"" was going to be."
I:420;909;That alone makes it all the more amazing that he is such a good filmmaker.
I:420;910;Director M. Night Shyamalan takes the viewer to an isolated place.
I:420;911;Fear that controls the mind.
I:420;912;The creatures in the woods keep the younger ones from leaving the village.
I:420;913;the color red is an attraction for the ones who do not speak.
I:420;914;The yellow color is safe.
I:420;915;It also has some major gaffs, like the town elders who know the truth and yet .
I:420;916;Anyway, Brody's character is the only one who inspries any real action in the film, and, to be fair, Bryce Dallas Howard is very good actress and has a promising future.
I:420;917;I don't want to give the story away, but it really is more of a psycological thriller with twists and turns that have to deal with the villagers in the movie.
I:420;918;I could sit back and enjoy the plot twists.
I:420;919;Good movie with a nice twist at the end.
I:420;920;If your a fan of his work you'll enejoy the story.
I:420;921;"I love the movie ""Signs"", and figured this movie would be similar."
I:420;922;Fortunately, the stellar cast, beautiful Pennsylvania scenery, and eerie atmosphere held my attention.
I:420;923;"teaming with his SIGNS director, radiates quiet strength and intensity as Lucius Hunt, who tries to cross the village borders into ""the towns"" for medicine to combat the community's recent rash of illnesses and deaths."
I:420;924;matched by Bryce Dallas Howard, lovely and endearing in her film debut as Walker's blind daughter Ivy.
I:420;925;I liked Ivy's subtle boldness as she saves the day after the guys who accompany her to the village borders chicken out.
I:420;926;Brody did a fine job with a role more complex than it first seems.
I:420;927;In Brody's able hands, overgrown child Noah simultaneously breaks your heart, makes you laugh, and creeps you out.
I:420;928;style clothing also got me thinking how great he'd be as Ichabod Crane if somebody films .
I:420;929;The finest moment in Brody's performance comes after Lucius and Ivy's engagement is announced.
I:420;930;the village is a sanctuary from today's world, created by the town elders to raise their children away from the tragedy and heartbreak of their former modern city lives.
I:420;931;A history teacher from a powerful family, Walker used his inherited wealth to establish this quasi.
I:420;932;"I liked the idea that Walker's rich enough to pull this off, with the preserve personnel on board with the ruse (when the young ranger Ivy meets outside the game preserve realizes she's a Walker, he quickly agrees to help her)
I:420;933;Still, the film is worth watching at least once if you approach it as an ensemble drama about a paranoid community instead of as an edge.
I:420;934;The Village requires reflection, patience, character development, and a good discussion later on the issue of whether evil is learned or inborn.
I:420;935;This is a horror movie in the greatest sense: we have met the enemy, and we are him.
I:420;936;This film is truly great cinema, as are all M. Night features.
I:420;937;But, one of my favorite things about this film besides the love story is the costumes.
I:420;938;It is amazing what Night can do without digital effects.
I:420;939;throw away all expectations before viewing this film and enjoy a visionary's tale.
I:420;940;"I ""liked"" the movie (as opposed to ""loved"" the movie)."
I:420;941;It's more a love story with chilling moments.
I:420;942;"He also did the ""Sixth Sense"", ""Signs"" and ""Unbreakable""."
I:420;943;"I own these other movies and I thought ""The Village"" was his best effort of the ones I haves mentioned."
I:420;944;This film deserves four stars!
I:420;945;There is something to be said for suspense, you know.
I:420;946;"i really enjoyed ""The Village"", even though there were logical, or rather logistical, problems which bothered me for days afterward."
I:420;947;I love the plot, and the observations we are invited to make about human nature, taboos and psychology.
I:420;948;"The Village strikes me as a superior and lengthier ""Twilight Zone"" episode, and fans should enjoy this smart film."
I:420;949;It is true what some have said.
I:420;950;If you are watching this film with the goal of figuring out the twist, you may very well guess it.
I:420;951;A very engaging film that is poignant, romantic and as suspensful as any offering by his predecessors.
I:420;952;I recommend watching something else.
I:420;953;Yes, by now we realize that The Village shares the same twist as a certain Twilight Zone Episode, but look past that and this is a really great film.
I:420;954;Watch this movie without such a critical eye and with more of an open mind and I promise you'll really enjoy it.
I:420;955;Any movie which can freak you out with a scene in complete daylight is worth a watch in my book.
I:420;956;"Possibly I went into watching this movie with diminished expectations due to the negative hype surrounding this movie, but I found it enjoyable and the ""twist"" suitable."
I:420;957;an entertainment piece of art and an introspective of the human psyche.
I:420;958;There are many connotations that one can draw from this movie and apply them to everyday situations in the real world.
I:420;959;This movie gives first hand insight into the mind, fears, and desires of all of us.
I:420;960;There are lessons to be learned from the prospective this film offers, a prospective that nobody can tell if the director meant to tell.
I:420;961;"Remember, Shyamalan through his prior movies has given us all a gift, the guarantee that our minds will be hyperactive for at least two hours due to our desire to ""figure out"" the plot twists."
I:420;962;If you see in this movie that which I have seen, your mind will be hyperactive for much longer than the time this film occupies your television screen.
I:420;963;His movies are character analyses that not only tell a story, but also reveal the nature of its characters in a way that you can relate to.
I:420;964;all in all, M. Night's movies grow more mature as they come along, and I find myself watching them over and over just to feel the 'experience' he creates with his amazing eye for direction.
I:420;965;I wonder what he'll do next.
I:420;966;Another of M. Night Shyamalan's unique, and, in some cases, terrifyingly realistic films, The Village, which for some strange reason was marketed as a horror film, is far more at home in the drama genre.
I:420;967;At first glance, the film plays with your emotions, you either like it, or you utterly hate it, but in the end, with it's nice, romantic conclusion that, like most of Shyamalan's endings, seems to emphasize a return to normalcy as well as the importance of family, faith, and tradition, it leaves you in a sort of soft middle.
I:420;968;Few film makers are better than M. Night Shyamalan at making such a touching blend of family values and close.
I:420;969;home horror, and the acting is incredible.
I:420;970;William Hurt, Joaquin Phoenix, Judy Greer, and yes, even Sigourney Weaver deliver a performance that is beyond incredible, accented by the seemingly trademark appearance of the director himself.
I:420;971;This movie is definitely worth a watch.
I:420;972;The end is absolutely clear.
I:420;973;the latter half of the movie is very gripping and pays off well for the patience which the audience shows in the first half.
I:420;974;the most remarkable feature of Shyamalan's movies is, that unlike other horror movies, they are not stuffed with scary scenes.
I:420;975;Also, the hidden message in the movie makes an extremely strong impact.
I:420;976;The Village , the new feature from M. Night Shyamalan, concerns a mysterious community living on the edge of a forest, which may or may not harbor ravenous monsters.
I:420;977;surprising surprises which are difficult to accept and leave a lot of questions unanswered.
I:420;978;The veterans in the cast give sturdy performances, bearing in mind they are fully aware of the village's secret while they project their characters.
I:420;979;They include William Hurt, handsome in a full beard, and Sigourney Weaver, whose raw.
I:420;980;To be fair, Shyamalan can be effective and some of his scenes are striking, such as the pivotal encounter between Phoenix and Brody.
I:420;981;M. Knight Shyamalan, 2004, 108 minutes) is a film I finally got to see and watch intently.
I:420;982;She Who Must Be Obeyed, well, was obeyed!No harm seeing the thing now, and I loved it.
I:420;983;spirited message and no small.
I:420;984;Thus Shyamalan succeeds in establishing that deep trust the audience wants to feel for the players.
I:420;985;That is an artful craft not easy to accomplish, and Shyamalan does it every time.
I:420;986;the fact that he succeeds with this PG.
I:420;987;rated, beautiful, calm film is obvious when one sees (or remembers) the hatred spewed by some after they had seen the movie.
I:420;988;I recall it well: Rotten.
I:420;989;It is one of the best films I have ever seen, simply because in the end, you will ask yourself huge, insanely huge, moral questions and propose hypotheses to yourselves.
I:420;990;and there is no director I know who has ever accomplished that like Shyamalan does with THE VILLAGE.
I:420;991;"Last night I was watching the M. Night Shyamalan film ""The Village"" (2004) and found it to be a mystical parable."
I:420;992;In the film, the blind young girl is the only one able to save her beloved, wounded for love of her.
I:420;993;Only pure love and self.
I:420;994;"on another level, I find ""The Village"" interesting for the portrayal of flight from the world."
I:420;995;I hahve a big disaponment whit Shyamalan.
I:420;996;for all movie you believe in this people.
I:420;997;No, i'm one of those this is a horror movie so let me kick back and enjoy it types.
I:420;998;I find horror movies fun to watch and a great escape from the real world.
I:420;999;You need a good ending to have a good movie.
I:420;1000;Turn, run to your car, and drive away as fast as possible!
I:420;1001;I thought this movie was well done!
I:420;1002;I love suspenseful thrillers, and would recommend this movie to anyone who does as well!
I:420;1003;If you are a fan of Mystery Science Theater 3000, you might enjoy mocking this feature.
I:420;1004;Indeed, there is a lot to make fun of.
I:420;1005;The scares are also few and far between, and cheaply done.
I:420;1006;if you like Signs, then you will enjoy this movie.
I:420;1007;This is a GREAT film!
I:420;1008;I love M. Night Shyamalan's work generally speaking.
I:420;1009;This was a great example of his genius.
I:420;1010;one of this movie's twists is evident from the beginning.
I:420;1011;watch for more excellent work from this extremely talented actress).
I:420;1012;The film is almost entirely a psychological drama, and the tension is purely psychological throughout.
I:420;1013;It's even better if you watch it with your mind open, and not expecting to have a temporary lobotomy for 2 hours as in so many other films with no message, but a lot of eye popping effects.
I:420;1014;"Any film that one either loves passionately or hates vociferously has to be one you should see 
I:420;1015;The community and these creatures have an understanding that each party stays within their boundaries.
I:420;1016;Everyone in the cast except for Joaqin put in convincing performances.
I:420;1017;The suspense of the idea that there were monsters in the woods was convincing.
I:420;1018;The combination of the cinematography and film score was what really made the film suspenseful and intense as it was.
I:420;1019;Bryce on the other hand was a real delight as the independent Ivy.
I:420;1020;M. Night Shymalan definitely has a knack for cinematography.
I:420;1021;I also loved the film score which gave the film an eery atmosphere.
I:420;1022;His late brother River Phoenix was a great actor.
I:420;1023;There were moments of the film when I thought it was simply about an 19th century farming community.
I:420;1024;I loved watching how the film was literally constructed.
I:420;1025;One of M. Night Shyamalan's weakest films.
I:420;1026;The eerie atmosphere throughout the film is effective, however.
I:420;1027;Sigourney Weaver and Adrien Brody give very good performances.
I:420;1028;The look of the film is stellar, and the costumes and sets are fairly decent.
I:420;1029;I wouldn't recommend The Village for the jump scares, but I would recommend it for its quiet creepy atmosphere.
I:420;1030;I have really enjoyed M. Night Shyamalan's other movies, especially 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Signs'.
I:420;1031;The acting is pretty good, especially Joaquim Phoenix.
I:420;1032;Director Ron Howard's daughter, Bryce Dallas Howard is really good as the blind Ivy.
I:420;1033;It's time for something new.
I:420;1034;m. Night Shyamalan is a good storyteller and film maker, and some of his previous movies were brilliant.
I:420;1035;I look forward to Mr. Shyamalan's next film, and hope it is something non.
I:420;1036;"popular ""The Sixth Sense""), that makes you wonder how in the world those villagers can live in that ""secluded village"".1 star for the ""modern."
I:420;1037;"day"" surprise (you'll get what that means) and 1 star for the ""creature"" costume that fooled the villagers."
I:420;1038;I thought it was a great movie, despite the fact that it wasn't all that scary.
I:420;1039;Bryce Dallas Howard really shined in her film debut, and should be applauded.
I:420;1040;Wow so many people that rate this movie are dumb and have no vision for a good movie!
I:420;1041;This movie is so damn good!
I:420;1042;Between the writing, the acting and the music which is so angelic, this is one of my favorite films ever!
I:420;1043;They aren't supposed to be just scary or just one thing, they are always suspenseful, emotional, funny, a little of everything.
I:420;1044;I look at it more as love story than anything really myself.
I:420;1045;And in that light it is so beautifully written.
I:420;1046;The twist was not too original, and the ending is sort of given away near the middle, but it makes a lot of sense, and some people really do live this way.
I:420;1047;It's a seemingly normal place with a population of merely 60 people.
I:420;1048;As the simple life of these innocent persons continues, through the cracks of this perfect and blessed comes something no one ever expected to be there in the first place.
I:420;1049;this is exactly what M. Night Shyamalan sets you up for and it turns from a horror/thriller, to a romance filled with physical and mental obstacles.
I:420;1050;"I came out of the theatre thinking to myself, ""My God, what was I thinking, I want my five months back"" but then I came to realize it does have it's moments, and in it's own way is very entertaining when you look at it one way instead of the other."
I:420;1051;Her roll itself was played so genuinly and so perfect that it keeps you within the movie and not about what's going to happen, or about the average acting.
I:420;1052;After all, how much more better can you get than this on a first time roll?The second thing that really saved the Village was the amazing music.
I:420;1053;With renowned violinist Hilary Hahn, the music captures the movie more than any other I've heard.
I:420;1054;M. Night Shyamalan did a good choice for going through with James Newton Howard to score because the violins with the fast motioness feeling to the fast parts bring in a more subtle feeling.
I:420;1055;There is a certain scene many can relate when the creatures are attacking, and Lucius grabs Ivy's hand and the two rush into the basement.
I:420;1056;This is my all time favorite moment when Hilary Hahn plays the violin at its best, and it gets gorgeous.
I:420;1057;Even though it's supposed to be an intense moment, you can't help but be humbled by the beautiful music.
I:420;1058;And the movie itself did in fact have some laughs, and for you might expect from review, it is good at times and brings in something unexpecting and surprising to it, and if it weren't for those creatures I waited five months to see, I would've never have gotten it.
I:420;1059;His movies are awesome, and they build you up to expectations that were usually met with Signs and The Sixth Sense, but not with the Village.
I:420;1060;I've found the trailer terrifying, and that's pretty much it.
I:420;1061;All in all, it's a good movie, and passed all through the flaws, it's worth 4 stars for originality.
I:420;1062;I'll keep watching M. Night Shyamalan, I just hope he can come up with more like Signs.
I:420;1063;the tiny 1870s community of Covington is comfortably surrounded by a thick forest which shields them from the outside world, and that's just how the elders like it.
I:420;1064;The Towns, as anything beyond the forest is generally referred to, are corrupt and evil and it is best that everyone stays within the borders.
I:420;1065;Lucius Hunt is a quiet, fearless young man who nevertheless seems to have a bit of trouble with public speaking.
I:420;1066;Played by Joaquin Phoenix in one of his best performances to date, Lucius is one of the most intruiging and appealing characters I've ever seen on film.
I:420;1067;Though blind, Ivy enjoys life to its fullest potential and seems ever.
I:420;1068;full of conversation and laughter.
I:420;1069;Bryce Dallas Howard makes her star debut here, in an Oscar.
I:420;1070;worthy performance that left me stunned.
I:420;1071;Ivy is, of course, in love with Lucius .
I:420;1072;another performance worth mentioning is Adrien Brody's portrayal of the mentally unstable, childish Noah.
I:420;1073;like relationship between himself and Ivy is sweet and charming, but .
I:420;1074;this movie is artfully and skillfully done.
I:420;1075;Is this a film where the sum of the parts is greater than the whole?
I:420;1076;even inside the ones you love .
I:420;1077;By leaving so much of the plot unresolved at the movie's conclusion, he is telling us that, in fact, it doesn't matter .
I:420;1078;I saw it anyway and it was great.
I:420;1079;I hope M. Night keeps making good movies like this one.
I:420;1080;I read several reviews before seeing this movie and they pretty muched summed up to the movie being fair to pretty good.
I:420;1081;I will have to say that the director was very true to his style.
I:420;1082;The beauty of the story is that it is much more than what it appears and the director is very successful in tying together many intricate details into a seemless plot that takes a person's perception of reality on a roller coaster ride.
I:420;1083;The plot and story is very original and I recommend it for both its ambiance and story.
I:420;1084;This entire movie could have run in only 20 minutes and you wouldn't miss anything and might even enjoy it.
I:420;1085;It's a shame, I love a good suspense/horror movie and the decent actors in this movies were waisted.
I:420;1086;I think it's a fantastic movie, and makes me think about how wonderful it would be to live in such a place.
I:420;1087;This movie made perfect sense to me.
I:420;1088;i just enjoy the movie.
I:420;1089;And, that's exactly what you should do.
I:420;1090;If Shyamalan didn't end the movie the way he did it The Village would have been a great film.
I:420;1091;Although I had a fun time.
I:420;1092;Here is one with a fresh idea, which is a rare treat.
I:420;1093;"here is something I can tell you, the EXTRAS include a ""making of"" the movie that was REALLY GOOD!"
I:420;1094;The plot is phanomieal, and the twist to the end is the best I've ever seen.
I:420;1095;This is definately one of the best movies i have ever seen.
I:420;1096;Watch it, and see for youself!
I:420;1097;he made you feel passionately about it.
I:420;1098;But the movie was great nonetheless.
I:420;1099;For those of you who have not seen it, please go in with an open mind.
I:420;1100;The twist is great, but view with an open mind.
I:420;1101;"Like a Renaissance miniature, ""The Village"" is a small masterpiece."
I:420;1102;"the cinematography (likewise filled with ""forced"" touches, most notably in the shot of Ivy standing in the forest surrounded by red flowers that, given the overall color balance of the frame, could not possibly be that red) is exquisite, the music breathtaking."
I:420;1103;The whole film comes together as a symphony: cohesive, firmly held within the boundaries of its undertaking, visually and sonically beautiful.
I:420;1104;Why or how this was I'm not entirely certain, but it was definitely there, and it eventually got the weakest reviews of the four major release M. Night Shyamalan movies.
I:420;1105;And yeah, the film was definitely mis.
I:420;1106;And yeah, the ending ain't so hot.
I:420;1107;It's beautifully shot, with gorgeous natural scenery, and some relatively original, intriguing looking creatures.
I:420;1108;What's more, the characters are genuinely likable, particularly the leads Phoenix and Howard, something relatively rare and difficult in a period piece.
I:420;1109;This is a small film, that comes with the burden of huge expectations.
I:420;1110;This film starts from an interesting premise, and the fact that I was mulling it over for sometime after made for quite a pleasant surprise.
I:420;1111;This movie is frakkin' *brilliant* on so many levels.
I:420;1112;Who are the real monsters when the adults are willing to not just lie, but LIVE a lie, for their own ends?Given the context of Ivy's belief system, her courage is truly remarkable.
I:420;1113;being willing to go into and through the woods, blind and on her own for her loved one is the real, unrecognized strength of this story.
I:420;1114;what an extraordinarily beautiful person she plays!)
I:420;1115;pure poetry for the eye, ear, mind and heart.
I:420;1116;i applaud the director's courage in making this movie.
I:420;1117;If you like this, you may also enjoy Signs and Unbreakable.
I:420;1118;I felt this film was a departure from his previous work and taken on a purely entertainment level it was totally worth watching.
I:420;1119;Actually there is beautiful storytelling here and a deep love story interwoven with suspense and M.'s signature style.
I:420;1120;i enjoyed the film and loved the extras.
I:420;1121;it always amazes me the work that goes into a production of this scale.
I:420;1122;i realize it's not the sixth sense but it is truly a very good piece of film making.
I:420;1123;In my opinion it was the best of all his movies.
I:420;1124;Everything was pitch perfect: the scenery, buidings, clothing, speech.
I:420;1125;The cast was full of major actors, any one of which capable of carrying a motion picture just on his or her name.
I:420;1126;The plot was very believable, even the monster was real .
I:420;1127;The movie even had a spectacular ending.
I:420;1128;This is a scary movie.
I:420;1129;This is a thought provoking movie that can lead to some serious discussions about morals, ideas, ideals, and society's role in protecting the weakest members.
I:420;1130;phoenix is amazingly good and still surprises me that he is as good, if not better than anything his now deceased brother was doing.
I:420;1131;Dallas Howard is also something of a great find.
I:420;1132;John Hurt and Cherry Jones (a Shyamalan regular) are also quite good.
I:420;1133;Sixth Sense was a really effective movie, because no director/writer had gone down that path in quite a while.
I:420;1134;It was considered brilliant for delivering a good thriller, but also for poking fun at horror movies, sequels, itself and society in general.
I:420;1135;Although the acting was passable, I found the movie itself absolutely impossible.
I:420;1136;"M. Night Shymalan made some really great films before this, the unbelievable ""Sixth Sense"", the under."
I:420;1137;"appreciated ""Unbreakable"", and even the sometimes."
I:420;1138;It's called Dark City, and Roger Ebert named it best film of the year when it came out.
I:420;1139;The Village was a great movie.
I:420;1140;but it was very exciting.
I:420;1141;From the amazing preview of the village, I was expecting a really good movie.
I:420;1142;A potential scarefest turned into a realistic borefest.
I:420;1143;He started out great, but fizzled out fast.
I:420;1144;He will still be able to sell tickets to future shows, but with every show he will lose credibility in his profession.
I:420;1145;THE VILLAGE is a very good movie if taken as another chapter in Shyamalan's odyssey.
I:420;1146;There is an Amish flavor in dress and speech and government that makes this strange place appealing.
I:420;1147;important concept of Love that is the journey through which Shyamalan guides us.
I:420;1148;The photography is lovely, moody, and atmospheric and the haunting solo violin playing by Hilary Hahn of the score by James Newton Howard contribute elegantly to enhancing the mood of the film.
I:420;1149;it succeeds well, at least to this viewer.
I:420;1150;I was genuinely surprised by some twists in the plot, and I became an M. Night Shyamalan fan because of this film.
I:420;1151;I recommend searching for his other films, as well.
I:420;1152;i see some negative ratings, but I do like this movie and I appreciate the concepts, style, and meaning of the film.
I:420;1153;the suspense and tension in this film build until the revelations at the end.
I:420;1154;Some people may not like the climax, but I see the end as fitting and unique.
I:420;1155;I love all the other movies he's done .
I:420;1156;And I can say it is just as good as any other movie he's done.
I:420;1157;all the previews lead you to believe it will be something frightening and scary but it turns into a very sweet and moving love story.
I:420;1158;"It was advertised as though it were at the very least some sort of ""Blair Witch"" film, but it's more suspense than horror/slasher."
I:420;1159;"it's more of a ""moody"" atmosphere piece."
I:420;1160;"bOTTOM LINE:This will NOT ""wow"" you like ""Sixth Sense"" did."
I:420;1161;But figuring out HOW the twist happens is tricky and still delivers some interest.
I:420;1162;But it is so clearly in the time of the modern world.
I:420;1163;For we DO see towns with present day cars, and a wildlife officer patrols the preserve in a modern Jeep or similar vehicle.
I:420;1164;It is one of the so many unsolved mysteries of this movie.
I:420;1165;That's all I can say.
I:420;1166;So she returns and there's a happy ending?
I:420;1167;This movie is just so totally unpredictable, but NOT in a good way!
I:420;1168;"Yes some clever viewers will figure out what lies beyond the ""forbidden woods"" but that in no way takes the power of this movie away."
I:420;1169;"I thought ""The Sixth Sense"" was wonderful: well."
I:420;1170;done, scary, and with a twist that worked.
I:420;1171;intellectual, swath of artistic pomp.
I:420;1172;I saw this movie in the theatre, and very much enjoyed it: the cinematography is gorgeous, and the suspense is well.
I:420;1173;"minute trick though is that it should make you rethink everything you've seen before
I:420;1174;There are some great scenes in the film that made me want to capture it for a while.
I:420;1175;Now that was an excellent scene.
I:420;1176;There's some great emotion that wilfully shows on screen.
I:420;1177;The haunting violins that add to the super stunning visuals only left me more guessing than I thought I would be.
I:420;1178;Noah's (Adrien Brody) character was very interesting and befitting.
I:420;1179;Fortunate because they have a great movie to look forward to.
I:420;1180;It managed to have that affect on me.
I:420;1181;wise men say what wise men do.
I:420;1182;Watch this film for the love of color.
I:420;1183;moving, is a good one.
I:420;1184;Extremely talented actors, great plot twists, and plenty of scares!
I:420;1185;This movie will provide the perfect night's entertainment for you!!
I:420;1186;It was very romantic with frightening moments.
I:420;1187;I saw the movie as the ultimate prank played my M. Night Shaymalan on his fans.
I:420;1188;This movie had its frightening moments, but it was more a love story than a horror film.
I:420;1189;I'll admit I was disapointed at first because the movie was not what I expected, but I watched it again and realized that it was still a wonderful movie.
I:420;1190;I was impressed by Bryce Dallas Howard's performance.
I:420;1191;I think she has some really great films ahead of her.
I:420;1192;Joaquin Phoenix was incredible, as always, even though he did not have that many scenes.
I:420;1193;He had an absolutely incredible performance.
I:420;1194;I really did enjoy this move, despite its flaws.
I:420;1195;It was not his best movie, but still pretty good.
I:420;1196;The Village movie is well.
I:420;1197;made and interesting in a number of ways, but it just isn't very appealing.
I:420;1198;If M. Night Shyamalan establishes himself as a real legend, I think this will be remembered as one of his minor achievements.
I:420;1199;"With one of M. Knight's surprises toward the end of the movie, this causes you to, again in M. Knight's fashion, reflect back onvarious 'clues' that he gives you throughout, and say, ""I should have figured that out!"""
I:420;1200;The landscape of Southern Chester County, PA, is beautiful, and it is amazing to see (on the extra material) the work that went into building the village.
I:420;1201;The plot line and script are, in my opinion, the best yet by this talented, young writer/director.
I:420;1202;"By this point, 'The Sixth Sense' had become a bit of a millstone around his neck, and Shyamalan clearly felt pressured to deliver the ""twist ending"" yet again."
I:420;1203;"The film actually relies on a succession of ""revelations"", but once the first one is known, you can pretty much guess what the others will be."
I:420;1204;"true ""twists"" he's done before."
I:420;1205;The interesting setup, and some of the performances, keeps this from being a total disaster, but it's fair to say that `The Village' is one of his weakest.
I:420;1206;I liked it a great deal.
I:420;1207;Great words were used in the movie that relate to reality.
I:420;1208;I was very impressed with the feel of the movie.
I:420;1209;i thought the ending was cool, but it didnt have you saying oh my gosh with excitement as in Signs or The Sixth Sense.You know the suspence with Signs and The Sixth Sense was frighting.
I:420;1210;still a good movie, but not his best.
I:420;1211;He wants to stimulate your imagination, to make you more alive by leading you to think .
I:420;1212;about the nature of evil, about boundaries, about truth and innocence, courage and love.
I:420;1213;At this task, he does a masterful job.
I:420;1214;Watch the movie and expect everything to mean something, because it does.
I:420;1215;"the suspense and fear are there because he wants you to feel the reality that there is really something ""other"" out there, something worth being afraid of."
I:420;1216;a movie can have the simpliest storyline(which is not the case here but anyway),the dept of it makes it a winner.
I:420;1217;the village makes you feel has if you are part of the tale,it will touch your heart.
I:420;1218;acted movie I've ever seen.
I:420;1219;Shyamalan is a slave to his template format of a build.
I:420;1220;the director wieldeth powerful magic.
I:420;1221;He's now known as the guy who always has a breathtaking suprise ending in every movie he does, and each ending has to be better then the last.
I:420;1222;"the Village's plot can best be described as ""The amish meet ""Aliens"" ""."
I:420;1223;"A quiet town from the 1800's is surrounded by nasty creatures ""those we do not speak of""."
I:420;1224;sounds like a great plot right?
I:420;1225;It is, and it has the possibility to be so great.
I:420;1226;I will admit there are a few frightenig moments involving the creatures from the woods, but thats it.
I:420;1227;When you see these beasts, they do have a great design thats memorable and creepy.
I:420;1228;A monumental mistake Shyamalan makes is revealing the secret behind the creatures from the woods a full thiry minutes before the film ends!
I:420;1229;Bottom line: The ending is dissapointing and easily the weakest ending in all of Shyamalan's movies.
I:420;1230;So you'll have to see it and come to your own conclusion.
I:420;1231;"Then after seeing the movie I was like ""Dude, rip off"", yet I enjoyed the movie."
I:420;1232;Great story and visuals, from the monster to the setting of the movie.
I:420;1233;His is a unique offering and his audience is becoming intensely loyal.
I:420;1234;It is a pleasure, in many respects, to see a director seek his own vision in his own way without any interference whatsoever.
I:420;1235;but rather a certain bravery in production that will allow some of the most innovative and imaginative story.
I:420;1236;That, we feel, would be Shyamalan's greatest contribution to the genre.
I:420;1237;"Perhaps they are here looking for the reasons why they love his films so much
I:420;1238;We believe that Shyamalan's productions are worthwhile for anyone to watch except for those super.
I:420;1239;Shyamalan's perfect foil as a director is probably Quentin Tarantino.
I:420;1240;The love here is a chaste love.
I:420;1241;"Despite people claiming that the story wasn't really ""as advertised"" it was still an engaging film."
I:420;1242;I'm a huge fan of the writer/producer/director (Signs is my all time favorite movie), and an even bigger fan of Joaquin Phoenix.
I:420;1243;i felt badly for 2 of my favorite actors, Joaquin and Oscar.
I:420;1244;as some of my friends disliked the movie with passion, I loved it.
I:420;1245;I thought it was incredibly smart and intensely moving.
I:420;1246;i found the parallels in this film quite potent.
I:420;1247;The power of instilling fear in society, the power of denial, the power of conviction and ultimately the power of love were all depicted with sheer finesse.
I:420;1248;, the movie was impeccably beautiful.
I:420;1249;go see it with an open mind and you will love it.
I:420;1250;Go see it expecting a horror film and you will hate it.
I:420;1251;they are more of a sub plot, in the way of the real story taking place.
I:420;1252;with that being said, this was a good movie.
I:420;1253;not shyamalan's best, nor does it surpass his previous three movies, but this is still a very good movie.
I:420;1254;the ending had my brother and other people angry as hell and, personally, i liked it.
I:420;1255;i thought it was interesting the way it spawned out to be what it was.
I:420;1256;all in all, the village isnt a memorable movie besides the ending which you will either like or hate.
I:420;1257;i liked it, and i recommend you to watch this movie with an open mind.
I:420;1258;M. Night Shyamalan is in my opinion the best screenplay writer today.
I:420;1259;The Sixth Sense, Hide and Seek and broadway's Iceman Cometh are the few other times I have ever felt the chill and enjoyment of a priceless piece of work that moves you at the end.
I:420;1260;I believe that it is the way a film can bring you to tears, shock you or amaze the senses to the point you are thinking about it for days after that makes a work of art priceless.
I:420;1261;Shyamalan has mastered this craft.
I:420;1262;This will most likely be the last M. Night Shyamalan film i watch.
I:420;1263;I was very dissapointed by this, as I felt Sixth Sense was excellent and Unbreakable very good.
I:420;1264;Shyamalan sets up an interesting premise but there are too few twists and turns to keep this movie compelling throughout.
I:420;1265;Too bad because the film was relatively taut in the first half and enjoyable to watch.
I:420;1266;The elders have chose to turn their backs on the town, keeping vigilant watch on the borders with the the dark forest that separates them from civilization.
I:420;1267;Fine performances by Hurt, Weaver, and Phoenix keep this film moving along at a brisk pace.
I:420;1268;M. Night captures the cadence of 18th century English, further lending to the old world air of this movie.
I:420;1269;But, ultimately love turns into a near fatal dagger that forces a young blind woman to have to brave the hundred acre woods to find medicine for her fallen lover.
I:420;1270;Better to stick to lighter projects like Stuart Little.
I:420;1271;I found the score (especially lead violinist, Hilary Hahn) and sound effects a perfect complement to the overall tone (no pun intended) of the film.
I:420;1272;In fact, I felt that the dominant violin gave momentum and a strong emotional identity to certain moments within the film.
I:420;1273;She sort of blended in with the background of the story until the time was right for her to emerge and become the focal point.
I:420;1274;By the way, Howard's portrayal of Ivy is one of those special few performances that will haunt me and linger with me for a long time to come and if this is any indication, Bryce Dallas Howard will be a household name in no time.
I:420;1275;It was a wonderful and important breakthrough performance for this fine young actress.
I:420;1276;the film is full of allegory.
I:420;1277;hearted blind girl driven by a selfless sense of love and compassion for another human being.
I:420;1278;natured intentions of the village elders.
I:420;1279;"William Golding's novel, ""Lord of the Flies"" addresses some of the very same issues."
I:420;1280;i also noticed a lot of symbolism throughout the film.
I:420;1281;Combine that with the fact that the self.
I:420;1282;the forest can be associated with fears of the unknown.
I:420;1283;Then again, maybe I shouldn't be so pessimistic and maybe I should have more faith in the positive side of human nature and maybe that's a message that the film is trying to deliver as well.
I:420;1284;but what serves as an inspirational counterpoint to all of this is Ivy's success at overcoming every possible obstacle that life had placed before her to complete her mission driven only by her love and concern for Lucius and probably every other single member of that community.
I:420;1285;That's the heart of the film for me.
I:420;1286;boundless triumph of the human spirit.
I:420;1287;That's the emotional core for me at least.
I:420;1288;That's what I'm taking away from all of this and that's why I go to the movies.
I:420;1289;final thoughts: Excellent cinematography with wonderful use of light, shadows and fog.
I:420;1290;Great sound editing and awesome soundtrack.
I:420;1291;I loved all the taut, tense moments but the romance was what this story was all about.
I:420;1292;best scene moment: When Lucius Hunt pulls Ivy into the house at the last possible second right before the creature was upon her.
I:420;1293;At that instant, I realized how destined they were for each other and how selfless their love was for each other.
I:420;1294;A perfect moment in film.
I:420;1295;"boggling as in any of his first three films (even including Signs )
I:420;1296;"executed
I:420;1297;his writing in Sixth Sense and Unbreakable was outstanding, and in Signs, darn good.
I:420;1298;In The Village, it's just very good.
I:420;1299;With Europeans, a good story suffices, and this movie gives a very good story.
I:420;1300;The only good thing I have to say about this movie is that Bryce Dallas Howard did turn in quite a good performance, despite what seemed like a phoned.
I:420;1301;M. Night Shyamalan brings you another one of his stories, The Village (2004).
I:420;1302;as the story begins, the year is unknown for now.
I:420;1303;If you have red berries, surely it means you have been in the woods.
I:420;1304;He knows their are secrets in every corner of this community.
I:420;1305;I cant really give the review I want without spoiling the surprise, but this was a wonderful movie.
I:420;1306;If it could be done how wonderful it could be.
I:420;1307;Many things take sacrifice, but I'm not going to play the ethics card, afterall it is just a movie, and very well done.
I:420;1308;I like horror movies, I wanted some scary bits.
I:420;1309;She barely taps the ground every 5 or 6 steps.
I:420;1310;this movie is not scary but more suspenseful.
I:420;1311;it is a great movie, with awesome twists and anyone who said that they figured out this movie is a liar.
I:420;1312;this movie is perfectly written, acted and directed.
I:420;1313;I found it to be, while a very simple story, very interesting and visually pleasing.
I:420;1314;The acting was VERY good, the story was moving and touching on many levels.
I:420;1315;"Watch this one with an open mind and enjoy
I:420;1316;It is the way of life of an eightteenth century.
I:420;1317;A mysterious wildlife refuge of some sort.
I:420;1318;The refuge is made very mysterious, to be sure!
I:420;1319;This movie has diarrhea of mystery and constipation of solution!
I:420;1320;this movie has it all!
I:420;1321;All, that is, except anything ultimately happening to make us care a whit about all that acting, eerieness, and suspense!
I:420;1322;Let's get this out of the way: the acting in this movie is superb.
I:420;1323;top portrayal of a retarded person of some kind, each character is very well acted and developed when necessary.
I:420;1324;"It's quite compelling
I:420;1325;in addition, the story is told well, with revelations coming at the appropriate moments.
I:420;1326;it's a fun movie to watch if you can completely ignore the glaring plot.
I:420;1327;Maybe that was a good thing.
I:420;1328;Like, Signs was about faith and coincisence, and Unbreakable was about duality and love.
I:420;1329;The marketting was attracting people that wanted to see a horror film!
I:420;1330;Mama's gonna keep you right here, under her wing.
I:420;1331;Their system of implementing it is near perfect.
I:420;1332;In the film's case, a character chooses to seek medicine from outside the village.
I:420;1333;He'd become curious, and he'd mention it to the people of the village and the selfish experiment would come to an end.You see this happen in religious groups, especially fundamentalist and rural religious groups.
I:420;1334;She can't see the park ranger's land rover.
I:420;1335;She can't see his walkie.
I:420;1336;Humanity has, as it's nature, a dark side.
I:420;1337;And there is little they can do to keep the people under perfect control.
I:420;1338;Humans have powerful emotions that move them from time to time to press boundaries.
I:420;1339;"the shining ""remainder to the Matrix equation"" in the film is Adrien Brody's character."
I:420;1340;The boy is unruly and wild.
I:420;1341;Violence born out of the human emotion of jealousy.
I:420;1342;This starts a chain reaction of emotional decisions.
I:420;1343;The dying man's fiance is moved by love to travel to the end of the world to save her beau.
I:420;1344;The boundaries we have are the boundaries we tear down.
I:420;1345;one person's idea of a perfect world is another person's prison.
I:420;1346;There's a lot going on in this film.
I:420;1347;And much of it is pertinent to all of our lives.
I:420;1348;The Village is a nice expression based on this concept.
I:420;1349;it's really more of a drama, with a moral edge, and a pinch of romance.
I:420;1350;it's good to see Shyamalan display the question of social ethics in the film.
I:420;1351;It's interesting to see the ideas and opinions of the villagers change over time, as well as the evolution of deception amongst friends and loved ones, and how it leads to no more than sorrow.
I:420;1352;the idea of the Covington Woods creatures was good.
I:420;1353;most of all, I think an excellent aspect of this film is the imagery used.
I:420;1354;The emphasis on the swaggering trees to stimulate a certain uneasiness was perfect.
I:420;1355;in this film I enjoyed the character development and the ideation.
I:420;1356;I liked the artistic touch, the cinematography and the music that carries the movie.
I:420;1357;Actually the music is very excellent.
I:420;1358;The symbolisms and the overall message was just great.
I:420;1359;At the time, I thought Signs was his best work to date, and I couldn't wait to see what he came up with next.
I:420;1360;The signature twist ending that is the hallmark of Shyamalan's movies.
I:420;1361;I thought the ending was great in The Sixth Sense, okay in Unbreakable, and.
I:420;1362;on the other hand the acting in The Village was, on the whole, solid.
I:420;1363;It was hilarious to watch one of the village girls profess her love for him, and watching him stand there with a deadpan expression on his face.
I:420;1364;I immediately developed sympathy for her having to live the way she does, but she shows great fortitude throughout the movie, and it shows when should stood terrified outside of her house waiting for Lucius during an attack by the creatures, but never running away.
I:420;1365;m. Night Shyamalan is a director who his loaded with talent.
I:420;1366;But even the greatest directors will once in a rare while make a movie that is not up to the standards of their previous works.
I:420;1367;I knew the ending within the first 10 minutes.
I:420;1368;you certainly are a product of your desensitization.
I:420;1369;I saw this in theaters and absolutely loved it.
I:420;1370;Let me just say that I am very pleased with this movie and hope the next effort by M. Night is as enjoyable as this one.
I:420;1371;I see the world, Lucius Hunt.
I:420;1372;Well developed story line, excellent characters you can relate to.
I:420;1373;Imagery is superb as is the typical for M. Night Shamalian.
I:420;1374;A treat for the soul!
I:420;1375;The Village is more along the lines of a psychological thriller rather than a scary movie.
I:420;1376;It shows how powerful of a tool fear is.
I:420;1377;i beg of you to give this movie a chance and to recognize how smart it really is.
I:420;1378;It is very underrated and superbly done.
I:420;1379;i really liked this film.
I:420;1380;First, it's a love story, and a touching one at that.2.
I:420;1381;A second theme illustrates the fact of man's extreme susceptibility to irrational fears and beliefs.
I:420;1382;This movie is full of emotion and love.
I:420;1383;Bryce Howard is simply phenomenal in her debut starring role.
I:420;1384;I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good surprise and a good love story.
I:420;1385;is that it made for a more interesting and suspenseful movie for the blind chick to go seek help.
I:420;1386;A surprisingly riveting thriller that lives of the M. Night Shyamalan reputation.
I:420;1387;By the end of the movie all of your questions will be answered in a satisfying manner.
I:420;1388;Some really intriguing performances, especially from Bryce Howard, Ron Howard's daughter, as a blind villager determined to rescue her lover.
I:420;1389;It is certainly NOT, although a few scenes will have you tense.
I:420;1390;due to the protagonist heroine, and her valiant journey.
I:420;1391;"It's an involved and intelligent story, with a ""Twilight Zone"" flavor."
I:420;1392;This is a film that could have been great with more work on the script.
I:420;1393;Save your money and see something more worthwhile.
I:420;1394;I realize M. Night has a powerful following.
I:420;1395;And the bustle this movie made before it's release was impressive.
I:420;1396;A movie with a monster that seemed fresh to me.
I:420;1397;As with all Night movies, the power is in the climax.
I:420;1398;A dread surrounds his film, A mystery that deserves to be brought to light.
I:420;1399;I hope Night rebounds, because i like his hitchcok style.
I:420;1400;This is the first Night movie my family has seen, and now we want to see more.
I:420;1401;My son, an aspiring filmmaker himself, and I find Night's filming techniques fascinating.
I:420;1402;We were advised that this one is more of a suspenseful movie by a friend, and she was correct.
I:420;1403;this is a very suspenseful, well.
I:420;1404;I would suggest that if you have young children that you preview it, because there are some intense moments.
I:420;1405;"Brilliant as the film was, its ""twist"" ending was so powerful that audiences the world over expected nothing less from the talented young director."
I:420;1406;"although many have made scathing remarks about the ending of ""The Village"", it is perhaps his most perfect since ""The Sixth Sense""
I:420;1407;It's probably not fair to keep comparing Shyamalan's work to his first big hit, one of the best psychological horror films ever made.
I:420;1408;"A director could work his entire career and never make a SINGLE film as good as ""The Sixth Sense"", let alone recapture that movie's amazing brilliance."
I:420;1409;The Village does continues Shyamalan's pattern of there being twists in the plot, but this time there are SEVERAL of them and they occur sporadically throughout the film.
I:420;1410;the characters here are very rich, and their interactions and relationships with one another are very rewarding in big and small ways.
I:420;1411;The acting is phenomenal, most noticeably by Academy Award winner Adrian Brody and Joaquin Phoenix.
I:420;1412;Bryce Dallas Howard (Ron's daughter) lights up the screen in an astounding premiere performance as the blind Ivy, Adrien Brody delivers a searing portrayal of longing as the dim.
I:420;1413;witted Noah and Joaquin Phoenix heightens the moody tone with his strong, silent.
I:420;1414;This is Shyamalan most subtle film because it's beautifully directed and well acted.
I:420;1415;The Village is more of a character study of how a community and individuals respond under pressure and fear.
I:420;1416;"And while it has elements of horror, the twist and turns of the plot makes certain moments of the film scary
I:420;1417;A must see especially if you're a Shyamalan fan.
I:420;1418;Let me start out by saying that I love M. Night Shyamalan's work.
I:420;1419;I even loved MOST of this film.
I:420;1420;In Unbreakable, the twist ending resulted in a revelation for both the main characters and further established Willis' character as a hero in the minds of the audience.
I:420;1421;In Signs, the twist ending completely changes the way Mel Gibson's character views the world/universe and our place in it .
I:420;1422;In all of these movies the twist ending was the foundation for the final scenes of the film .
I:420;1423;In The Village, the twist ending comes and it reveals .
I:420;1424;I'm not going to give it away but I loved the ending.
I:420;1425;"I loved his first big hit, ""The Sixth Sense"", a movie that did everything right: great cast, great story line, outstanding production values and a director's viewpoint that didn't sneer at his audience."
I:420;1426;You beheld a unique filmmaker who put his brilliant imprint on everything in this production.
I:420;1427;making that proves exhilirating to the viewer because these filmmakers poured their passion into their work.
I:420;1428;They sweated blood in the horror genre to create brilliant, fresh looks at worn.
I:420;1429;It's story lulls the viewer into a sense of suspense that reigns throughout the picture.
I:420;1430;It's brillantly filmed and it's actors are superb.
I:420;1431;For those with an open mind and a couple hours to spare I highly recommend joining the director and creator of Signs, etc. for a movie that goes against the grain of your typical suspense thirller.
I:420;1432;The Sixth Sense has to be one of the most overrated movies I've ever seen, and fortunately this one didn't fool anybody.
I:420;1433;The some of the characters were well developed, but some of the performances seemed phoned.
I:420;1434;"The huge ""Plot twist"", and there were 2 this time, were both letdowns and seen well in advance."
I:420;1435;I love that this movie is not filled with vulgar language and sex!
I:420;1436;It's a good show and just creepy enough that my teenage daughter likes it as well.
I:420;1437;Had lots of suspenseful moments and unexpected twists!
I:420;1438;That's why I bought this movie.
I:420;1439;"those of you talking about ""great performances"" ."
I:420;1440;That's why I bought it.
I:420;1441;I took one look at the trailer and I decided right then and there.
I:420;1442;THE FILM WAS FALSELY ADVERTISED.
I:420;1443;An emotional, dramatic love story.
I:420;1444;The image of the scary creatures from the woods.
I:420;1445;The acting from the leading lady was brilliant and her emotional expressions were incredible.
I:420;1446;Interesting story line/concept, but enough with the slo.
I:420;1447;bIG PICTURE QUESTION 3: Would I want to watch this movie again or recommend it to friends?No.
I:420;1448;A love story or a horror flick?
I:420;1449;You have to have a good concept with good story line.
I:420;1450;The Village does have some scary moments, though, and I give Shyamalan credit for his originality, and for trusting the audience to think a little while they are being entertained.
I:420;1451;I'd also point out that Shyamalan succeeds in making the audience want the monsters in the film to be real, even when their nature, is called into question.
I:420;1452;The final twist in the film is as unexpected (in my opinion, anyway) as any that Shyamalan has created.
I:420;1453;I wanted my hubby to see it, I have watched it 2 times since we got it, he has made it through the 1st 1o minutes, lol.
I:420;1454;it is pretty scary nothing that will keep you up at night but it is really good.
I:420;1455;The movie makes you really care about the characters and makes you hope nothing happens to them.
I:420;1456;As for the ending I thought it was perfect very well done.
I:420;1457;It has a great plot and and a great ending.
I:420;1458;but For Me This Is M. night Shyamalan's Best Movie Yet.
I:420;1459;This seems to work out quite well until the day some children find a dead dog with all it's hair and much of its skin removed.
I:420;1460;Is it the work of a deranged wolf or are the creatures warning the villagers that the alliance is on thin ice?In typical creative fashion, Shyamalan builds the suspense and right about the time you say to yourself, I've figured it out, M. Night throws us a series of curve balls that will leave many of us spellboud.
I:420;1461;I ruthlessly look for flaws in any movie and I came away from this one amazed and in awe as usual.
I:420;1462;ALthough The Village did have wonderful cinematography and an underlying story of facing your fears for the ones you love, I expected it to be a horror movie.
I:420;1463;If you liked Signs or any of the book to movie adaptations of Bronte, I recommend this movie.
I:420;1464;Ok, so when the previews started for this movie I was so excited to see it.
I:420;1465;i told everyone about it and got them wanting to see it.
I:420;1466;The first hour of the movie it wasnt mindblowing or anything but it was good.
I:420;1467;I can relate to this movie better than most people I think.
I:420;1468;Bryce and Joaquin are backed by fine performances by Sigourney Weaver and William Hurt who both live with a secret or two.
I:420;1469;This movie is a gem!!!!
I:420;1470;Equally impressive is James Newton Howard's Academy Award nominated score, featuring another young female star, violinist Hilary Hahn.
I:420;1471;Adrien Brody also plays his supporting part well.
I:420;1472;If you put aside any expectation you may see something that other reviewers do not see: another good offering by Night.
I:420;1473;"She absolutely loves ""Signs,"" which I acknowledge is a very well."
I:420;1474;crafted story, but I don't like the way it jams my nervous system.
I:420;1475;"the thing I like most about M. Night's storytelling is his ability to surprise and he delivers again with ""The Village."
I:420;1476;"Much like what can be called Shyamalan's sophmore slump UNBREAKABLE, this is one of those ""watch it once"" movies since you can only really enjoy this movie once, and UNBREAKABLE at least was a bit of a surprise."
I:420;1477;"tHE VILLAGE is one of those ""best looking bad movies"" a movie where the plot and the story is so lame or predictable (the plot came to me as I was thinking of old commercials for tv shows like Alien Autopsy and Discovering the Titanic, think about it or email me if you want my insight on this) but the rest of the movie is beautiful with a good atmosphere and characters you like, remember and can believe."
I:420;1478;If you've seen the commercials you've seen all the best parts, and if the thriller elements are all your interested in, then you gotta pass.
I:420;1479;Hopefully Shyamalan's next movie will be better, or at least live up to what the commercials show us.
I:420;1480;"Perhaps Mr. Shyamalan should have presented his themes in a straightforward way, without ""the past is really the present"" or ""it was Earth all along ."
I:420;1481;"one can forgive a movie's lapses in logic if they are infrequent and the movie is basically intelligent and entertaining, but I felt ""The Village"" is truly neither."
I:420;1482;Would any rational, humane person send a blind girl (no matter how stereotypically pure and resourceful, since of course blind people are always above reproach, unflinchingly brave, and possess extrasensory perception .
I:420;1483;"still, in its klutzy way, ""The Village"" does stimulate thought, which is more than you can say for many movies that are otherwise more efficient and entertaining!"
I:420;1484;What this film maker was thinking when he did this is beyond me.
I:420;1485;Avoid this film and let someone tell you the truth about the Village and you'll be glad you passed this one by.
I:420;1486;It looked like a fine period piece with some horror twists.
I:420;1487;It's absolutely perfect in describing the movie's fundamental flaw.
I:420;1488;It was exactly the opinion I had after watching the movie, but he puts it in such beautiful terms that I feel his review is essential reading for anyone interested in this movie, whether you liked it or hated it.
I:420;1489;Initially, I wanted to be scared more, .
I:420;1490;the cool thing about this film is that I remained scared even after a fear.
I:420;1491;(This is probably the most important aspect of the film and what makes it a winner in my book!)
I:420;1492;, but I will be front line center for M. Night's next film.
I:420;1493;This is by far the best movie of the year and people that hate it just don't understand it.
I:420;1494;For the past 5 years M. Night Shyamalan has brought us shocking and original films that have frightened us and made us think about life and things we care for most.
I:420;1495;And Night's films are always dramatic with suspenseful moments.
I:420;1496;The Sixth Sense taught us about life, Unbreakable showed us that we should go out and do what God planned for us to do, and Signs shows us that everything happens for a reason.
I:420;1497;the Village shows us what happens when we try to protect those we love the most.
I:420;1498;And also what someone would do to save the person they truly love.
I:420;1499;M. Night Shyamalan really shines in this film.
I:420;1500;Jaquin Pheonix plays in his best acting job yet as a young boy destined to help the people of his village by planning to venture out into the forbbiden woods.
I:420;1501;Bryce Dallas Howard is what I can see to become the next big actress.
I:420;1502;She was phenomenal as Ivy Walker.
I:420;1503;the Music to the film is one of the best scores I have ever heard in my entire life.
I:420;1504;James Newton Howard does a great job.
I:420;1505;Roger Deakins lighting was spectacular aswell.
I:420;1506;But it is very dramatic, with SOME frightening sequences.
I:420;1507;This film is just amazing.
I:420;1508;i honestly don't know how this movie could possibly get 5 stars but i suggest you watch it and report your own thoughts, i hope that he does a much better job on his next movie.
I:420;1509;Truthfully, the way I see it is that the smarter you are, the more you will enjoy this movie.
I:420;1510;You will only enjoy this movie if you can look deep into every detail and take what is meant to be taken from it.
I:420;1511;For a movie than makes you question society as we know it and the supernatural, with an ironic twist, The Village is perfect.
I:420;1512;the film's lead female character is Ivy Walker, appealingly played by Bryce Dallas Howard.
I:420;1513;It's on this quest that the audience discovers the true nature of the village and its besiegers.
I:420;1514;Watch it again now that you know what to expect and I bet you'll like, maybe even love it.
I:420;1515;"It's rare to see an intellectual thriller as good as the four which Shyamalan has produced
I:420;1516;And with 'The Village', Shyamalan delivers what is certainly not his best film, but is still an amazingly captivating experience in the dramatic form of Alfred Hitchcock with a Rod Serling morality play thrown into the mix.
I:420;1517;"'The Village' is as well crafted as it is intense
I:420;1518;"acted as it is real to humanity
I:420;1519;of what adds the depth, character, and weight to this picture.
I:420;1520;Roger Deakins' cinematography accentuates the beautiful and the horrific all with one fell stroke of the camera lens, and Shyamalan's writing and directing are as solid and as steadfast and as unwavering as ever.
I:420;1521;The true nature of this film lies what is beyond the twist. . . what lies within the realm of the twist ed nature of the human mind and society as a whole and is a powerful moral tale of perfection begetting imperfection.
I:420;1522;its sad to think that there are people out there who will watch this movie and never realize its true intent. . . its true power and purpose.
I:420;1523;As I said, it is a heavily dramatic film. . . more suspenseful and intense than downright scary or terrifying.
I:420;1524;It is a story filled with love. . . doubt. . . courage. . . anger. . . but, above all, fear and what it means.
I:420;1525;those who understand this film will whole.
I:420;1526;"heartedly enjoy it
I:420;1527;hate it, and it really is their true loss.
I:420;1528;much of the criticism over this film (and Unbreakable) reminds me of the reviews Hitchcock got over many of his pictures. . . critics panned such well.
I:420;1529;I deeply feel this is the way Shyamalan's films will be treated in the coming years as people begin to understand the inner workings of the films and realize what masterpieces such films as this truly are.
I:420;1530;Those movies will be forgotten in time and I'll be quite happy when I'm older to see Shyamalan's films still watched and admired the world over for their originality, boldness, and forthright gestures about what it means to be human. . . about accepting destiny. . . about re.
I:420;1531;highly, highly recommended for those with open minds and who have plenty of time to mull over the material presented and discuss its complexities and puzzles.
I:420;1532;It concerns the inhabitants of a 19th century village surrounded by a forbidden forest.
I:420;1533;The people of the village are good, honest folk who are trying to make better lives for themselves after being touched by violence.
I:420;1534;the story, such as it is, centers around a spunky blind girl named Ivy, the daughter of the village's leader (William Hurt).
I:420;1535;Ivy is played by newcomer Bryce Dallas Howard, and it is her performance that keeps the movie from being a complete train wreck.
I:420;1536;She has a very strong screen presence, and basically carries the entire movie by herself, since the other actors are barely present.
I:420;1537;Howard gives a convincing, emotionally affecting turn that is better than the actual movie.
I:420;1538;Ivy is in love with a brooding, morose man named Lucius, played by Joaquin Phoenix.
I:420;1539;there are several genuinely terrifying moments once Ivy ventures alone into the ominous woods, and some interesting suspense, but it isn't nearly enough.
I:420;1540;The Village could have been a great movie had the screenplay gone through another rewrite and the characters become more than background scenary.
I:420;1541;I still recommend it, despite these reservations.
I:420;1542;It has a lot of good in it .
I:420;1543;chiefly Shyamalan's atmospheric direction and Bryce Dallas Howard's performance.
I:420;1544;She deserves it for her effort here.
I:420;1545;It felt more like contemporary in an Amish.
I:420;1546;But even though that aspect did not seep in, I still found the story to be brilliant.
I:420;1547;"On the other side there are those that are not spoken of
I:420;1548;as the story continues to unfold we get revelation after revelation until the whole brilliant tableau is revealed like a jigsaw puzzle.
I:420;1549;Finding out those secrets is part of the wonder of this film.
I:420;1550;The cast is made almost entirely of Oscar and Tony winners and nominees.
I:420;1551;One of the strongest casts I have ever seen.
I:420;1552;There are two twists in the film.
I:420;1553;I did not like the 1st one and the 2nd one was brilliant.
I:420;1554;Bryce Dallas Howard, Joaquin Phoenix, William Hurt,Sigourney Weaver, and Adrien Brody are all great, but it is Howard who gives the best performance in the film.
I:420;1555;"Now the ""creatures"" that lurk in the woods are very cool looking."
I:420;1556;The costume designer did quite well and as usual Shyamalan throws in his signature twists.
I:420;1557;I love Shyamalan's other films, especially Signs, which was such an underrated film in its beauty and artistry, but this one, YIKES!
I:420;1558;"great line and delivery of ""the young man."
I:420;1559;And finally, the main character Ivy is scary to look at as her corpse.
I:420;1560;The fantastic elements are just a means too drive home the story.
I:420;1561;The movie started out wonderfully: great acting, scenery that could go from gorgeous to terrifying in a matter of seconds, and, at times, almost unbearable suspense (that Shyamalan really knows how to scare!)
I:420;1562;At first this town seems like the perfect place to live: the people are friendly, the houses are cozy, and the scenery is beautiful.
I:420;1563;The two stars are for the cast and the filming.
I:420;1564;Better luck next time, guys.
I:420;1565;This is one of my favorite movies!
I:420;1566;It has an excellent cast of characters played by Hurt, Weaver, Phoenix, Brody and let us not forget Bryce Dallas Howard .
I:420;1567;It is a light thriller with a great story and I don't think it falls apart at the end at all.
I:420;1568;It is also a fantastic love story of sorts with unique characters not often seen in movies.
I:420;1569;It is definitely worth a look if you are a follower of these actors.
I:420;1570;on the other hand, without revealing too much, the premise of this movie is what is fascinating: The concept of 21st century Americans living in a 19th century village with its' corresponding values and lifestyle is what really intrigued me.
I:420;1571;"Ultimately, this is a romantic movie about the power of love and conviction, with a creepiness that is Shyamalan's trademark (are the ""creatures"" real or imagined?)"
I:420;1572;The initial first hour of the movie is so well executed in terms of period costumes, speech, and manerisms that you'd swear it was taking place in the 19th century.
I:420;1573;That's what makes it so believable to the offspring of the elders.
I:420;1574;The innocence and values of the villagers is so well contrasted against modern society that it gives the movie a sort of haunting innocence to it.
I:420;1575;the cinematography is excellent and very well shot.
I:420;1576;And being a musician I really enjoyed the score, which was nominated for an Oscar.
I:420;1577;Look this is a great movie.
I:420;1578;The sets and photography is beautiful, especially the scenes with Bryce Dallas Howard.
I:420;1579;She took my breath away.
I:420;1580;now onto the great debate.
I:420;1581;Cut away what you think you know about M. Night and his movies.
I:420;1582;This movie is about what people would risk for the ones they love.
I:420;1583;And Ivy will put herself in harms way to save the man she loves.
I:420;1584;So take another look at this great movie and relearn the brilliance of one of modern film making's great directors.
I:420;1585;If you have seen Sixth Sense, Signs, and Unbreakable, you will know how Mr. Shamalyan's mind works: create a reality, and when the viewer has got used to it, change it.
I:420;1586;the actors are amazing in their roles.
I:420;1587;They perform flawlessly the characters they have been given.
I:420;1588;This movie is not funny, full of suspense, action packed, and above all, it certainly is not scary.
I:420;1589;Much of the first half is rather suspenseful, but after the twist midway through the movie, you aren't nearly as scared by stuff.
I:420;1590;Adrien Brody did a good job playing the village idiot, a quirky turn after his Oscar.
I:420;1591;While obviously a few (about 6) months early, her work may merit Academy attention.
I:420;1592;Originally I was going to see it during the summer I work at the movies and even though everyone who came out of the movie said it sucked.
I:420;1593;I had to see it for myself because the director did do Signs and the 6th sense so I figured it was gonna be good and scary.
I:420;1594;Bryce Dallas Howard is hot.
I:420;1595;Watching Ebert and Roeper discuss this movie before I saw it was a good idea for me.
I:420;1596;Ebert hated it, Roeper loved it.
I:420;1597;But if you go in with the attitude to just watch it for what it is you'll enjoy it.
I:420;1598;I did enjoy this movie.
I:420;1599;Yes, some things were farfetched but the cinematography was beautiful, as well as the acting.
I:420;1600;Some of M. Night's traditional usage of humor is placed in the movie.
I:420;1601;i felt that the love story was necessary, but sort of drug on in the beginning.
I:420;1602;the bottom line is that if you are a Night fan, see it.
I:420;1603;more of a love story.
I:420;1604;got 3 out of 4 stars from Rolling Stone Magazine (almost unheard of for a thrill/mystery) overall great movie
I:420;1605;A total surprise, and a good one at that.
I:420;1606;Even my husband, who generally isn't into this kind of movie, enjoyed it.
I:420;1607;The tension created by wondering what the creatures are is gone, and the rest of the film's tension is the result of clever directorial tricks.
I:420;1608;It's regrettable, however, that Shyamalan's twist endings have become more of a handicap than anything else.
I:420;1609;Most people think a twist is very clever, but as a film major and screenwriter, I can assure you that it's often just a cop.
I:420;1610;"The ultimate twist ending is ""The Wizard of Oz,"" with its ""it was all a dream"" wrap."
I:420;1611;"i think Shyamalan is a filmmaker who made a big, splashy debut with the masterpiece that is ""The Sixth Sense"" and since then, he has been unable to measure up to that."
I:420;1612;And perhaps it's not fair that we expect him to . . . but we certainly should have expected better than this, and for $8.50 a ticket, we should have received it.
I:420;1613;I loved this movie, but did M. Night ever ponder what might the village people think if an airplane or helicopter ever flew over the village?
I:420;1614;, a facinatingly unique heroine more than worthy of him, humor, suspense, romance, and yes there *is* some terrifying jump out of your seat moments.
I:420;1615;The acting was superb, the interaction between characters rich and fulfilling, and the presentation awe.
I:420;1616;Go into this movie expecting nothing more, nor less, than a truly wonderful film with stellar acting and directing.
I:420;1617;"First of all I am going to say ""The Village"" is an amazing masterpiece that shows what M. Night is capable of doing for audiences."
I:420;1618;The Village has many wonderful aspects that involve love and innocense.
I:420;1619;For goodness sakes listen to the way they speak!
I:420;1620;To me thats more interesting than listening to them talk normal.
I:420;1621;Its what makes the movie unique and I think it adds more to the fact it's a love story, like the way Shakespere speaks.
I:420;1622;"I'm also pretty sure everyone, that is the smart ones, could understand the words in ""The Village""."
I:420;1623;if you are really older than 5 years old and know how to pay attention then you also picked up on the fact that two people are in love and will do anything to stay together.
I:420;1624;twist Number 3: Finally the twist that shocked me and hopefully others.
I:420;1625;It shows what people will do for protection and love.
I:420;1626;"And yes, the preview did make ""The Village"" look like it was going to be scary, but it's M. Night's fourth movie!"
I:420;1627;"We all should know by now how he directs movies and has way more suspense and unknown instead ""jump out of your seat scares""."
I:420;1628;There is more to the story.
I:420;1629;The scenes where they are all gathered outside to have a communal meal at the long tables are somehow very moving.
I:420;1630;But the more I watch it, the more the beauty of this movie unfolds.
I:420;1631;"Lucius' bravery and unswerving love for Ivy
I:420;1632;This movie is well acted and well written, with beautiful cinematography.
I:420;1633;just because I thought the music in this movie was phenomenal, and there was a pretty good concept to the film overall.
I:420;1634;"There were a few moments where M. Night's signature directing style came into effect and mere sounds played a factor into the ""scary"" parts of the movie."
I:420;1635;an interesting concept that makes you think quite a bit at the end.
I:420;1636;In the Sixth sense, you get this overall feeling that everything you are seeing has a specific meaning, and at the end, you realize that it does.
I:420;1637;the movie's good points: Great choice of filming location.
I:420;1638;the sets and costuming are all realistic and well designed.
I:420;1639;I particularly enjoyed Bryce Dallas Howard's debut (daughter of Ron Howard).
I:420;1640;Her performance in this film is both profound and moving.
I:420;1641;nonetheless a very good performance by him.
I:420;1642;Adrien Brody's roll is also meaningful and well acted, though not a large roll.
I:420;1643;Other good points: the music and the overall concept.
I:420;1644;With all the talent and creativity, could they not have come up with more realistic/scary looking monsters?
I:420;1645;I disagree with this thought.
I:420;1646;i thought the movie fell into sequence quite well and played through the 120 minutes just fine.
I:420;1647;overall, 4 stars because I think the movie was good.
I:420;1648;Interesting idea, great music, good actors, and somewhat of a message at the end that makes you think.
I:420;1649;A thriller is a movie with twists and turns, a revelation at the end, and other things along these lines.
I:420;1650;The Village is most definitely a thriller and rightly marketed as such.
I:420;1651;this movie was probably one of the most well.
I:420;1652;done movies that I have ever seen.
I:420;1653;It's so nicely shot and the music is great.
I:420;1654;"I think that this movie was probably the best one Shyamalan has made aside from ""The Sixth Sense."""
I:420;1655;If you do you will guarantee yourself with a dissapointment.
I:420;1656;Don't get me wrong, you're guaranteed to jump more than once and there is a handful of tense moments, but the truth of the movie is where the purpose lies.
I:420;1657;The movie is about the simplicities of life and the human emotions that come with it.
I:420;1658;If you think about it there is an extended metaphor within the movie.
I:420;1659;"Coming back to human nature, Shyamalan really only explores two human emotions
I:420;1660;The only downside of the movie is actually the ending, but it's funny because the ending is also the key to the movie.
I:420;1661;Simply put, the ending works.
I:420;1662;You can expect the Shyamalan Formula here, he'll throw all the answers at you first and then present you with the questions and then hit you with the final thing that makes it work.
I:420;1663;She makes a very smooth transition into the acting world and you'd think that she's been acting for a while when this is her first major role.
I:420;1664;Mel and Bruce were the stars of the previous entries in Shyamalan's filmography, but even with the big names everyone is treated equally here.
I:420;1665;This will make more sense once you see the ending.
I:420;1666;Enjoy this meaningful poetic film for what its really meant for, not for suspense or scares but for exploring the one thing that confuses us the most. . . ourselves.
I:420;1667;The acting, personally, was amazing.
I:420;1668;But I especially loved Joaquin Phoenix's character.
I:420;1669;I recommend it very much to everyone.
I:420;1670;Just go in there with an open mind and you'll love it.
I:420;1671;But The Village was thoroughly entertaining from beginning to end.
I:420;1672;The townsfolk nevertheless go about their daily business, and the suspense of not knowing what will happen or when builds.
I:420;1673;Not all the elements work for me but they tend to be well written, spiritual and creative.
I:420;1674;The movie works as a period piece, a love story, a story of faith and hope.
I:420;1675;The players are all very good.
I:420;1676;I read Ebert's review of Signs (he really liked that movie) and I saw the same strengths in Village.
I:420;1677;Go see it, it deserves much more than one star.
I:420;1678;Im very assured that everyone who sall the previews for the movie expected a film full of suspense and have you at the edge of your seat like i did.
I:420;1679;I anticipated The Village from the moment I saw the trailer.
I:420;1680;The plot was good and the actors were well picked, although I must say Adrian Brody surprised me.
I:420;1681;"I enjoyed The Village until the ""shocking moment"" arrived, then I was just pissed off."
I:420;1682;"I was still able to enjoy the love story subplot in the movie, but I was nonetheless dissapointed that ""Those we do not speak of,"" were not what they appeared to be."
I:420;1683;I still like Shyamalan and I do think that, despite of the criticisms, he is a great director.
I:420;1684;The viewer is constantly reminded by many of the elders (the village's government system if you will)of the violence and greed of the city outside of their little establishment.
I:420;1685;the movie was touted with Joaquin Phoenix as the star, but the real gem of the movie was Bryce Dallas Howard who I felt gave the best performance of the movie.
I:420;1686;i also loved the bond between Phoenix and Howard's characters.
I:420;1687;I think a lot of movies build up this great big tension when it comes to love between two characters, but Shyamalan's is a gentle one that is just as, if not more powerful.
I:420;1688;But still, the real twist to me was at the end.
I:420;1689;one of the things that I love about Shyamalan's work is the fact that he can take a subject that can so easily become complicated, add a human element to it, and make it seem so simple.
I:420;1690;I may have gotten a lot more out of this than some 15 year old who was/is expecting a hideous creature, but I think it is one of his best works.
I:420;1691;While such featurettes are commonly ignored by viewers, anyone who truly appreciates Shyamalan's work will acknowledge their importance in the context of his films.
I:420;1692;the features explore the film's remarkable on.
I:420;1693;location set, brilliant employment of sound.
I:420;1694;"a facet Shyamalan describes as the extent of his ""special effects""."
I:420;1695;and a comprehensive look at James Newton Howard's scoring of the film.
I:420;1696;This truly rare treat introduces young Hilary Hahn, the score's featured violinist who receives top billing in the film's end credits and whose playing style, Shyamalan discloses, uniquely reflects the nature of the film's young heroine, Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard).
I:420;1697;Shyamalan employs some great actors, and writes some great stories.
I:420;1698;This film is the perfect example.
I:420;1699;I'm not gonna tell you the ending in case you decide to watch this, but I will say that the movie is pretty darn good until then.
I:420;1700;In Devil we fear that Satan walks among us.
I:420;1701;In the end, it's an old lady.
I:420;1702;All of his movies are awesome until the truth is revealed.
I:420;1703;As I said before, it's great until the ending.
I:420;1704;And yet the power of the tragic love triangle is gripping, perhaps due to the writing, but also certainly to the performances of the three young actors, Adrien Brody, Bryce Dallas Howard, and Joaquin Phoenix.
I:420;1705;phoenix and Dallas Howard have more chemistry here than he did with Reese Witherspoon in WALK THE LINE!
I:420;1706;"In THE VILLAGE, his character, Lucius Hunt, plays a game of ""Ring of Fire"" that's really chilling, and when Ivy has to go on an epic journey to save his life it's totally involving, because we've gotten to care about the character."
I:420;1707;I think this is a great film to use to discuss with your children or friends the futility of trying to create a utopian society.
I:420;1708;The Village is the second M. Night Shyamalan film that I've seen.
I:420;1709;that changed with The Village, which had an intriguing trailer.
I:420;1710;This movie I was actually looking forward to seeing.
I:420;1711;And it starts out pretty good.
I:420;1712;the really sad part is that I was really enjoying the movie up to that point.
I:420;1713;What follows is classic Shyamalan, full of confusing twists and surprising turns.
I:420;1714;i really enjoyed this film, but I felt like Shyamalan gave up too many clues early in the movie.
I:420;1715;"He neatly blurred the viewers concept of what was happening in ""The Village"" with a couple of fun twists late in the movie, but by that time I already had a pretty good idea of what was really going on."
I:420;1716;go, but this was still an enjoyable film to watch.
I:420;1717;"as far as suspense is concerned, Shyamalan has perfected the art of making the viewer ""peek around the door."""
I:420;1718;This is one of the best aspects of all of M. Night's films and has become a lost art in modern cinema as far as I'm concerned.
I:420;1719;"He'd rather make you think about the ""monster"" or ""alien"" instead of see it."
I:420;1720;The Village is a good representation of both of these techniques.
I:420;1721;"M. Night has also got the ""well, I'll be"" aspect down pat."
I:420;1722;the acting in this film is brilliant.
I:420;1723;"Joaquin Phoenix does a great job in this movie, perhaps better than his performance in ""Signs."""
I:420;1724;Bryce Dallas Howard is the best performer in this flick.
I:420;1725;She is both beautiful and graceful and has a solid grasp on her character.
I:420;1726;Adrien Brody is convincing as the village simpleton, and you feel quite a bit of pain for his character.
I:420;1727;The rest of the cast, including William Hurt, does a wonderful job.
I:420;1728;Other than that, the film is fun to watch.
I:420;1729;"There are also production photos, ""Bryce's Diary,"" and plenty of other fun extras for folks who dig that kind of stuff."
I:420;1730;"in closing, if you enjoyed ""Signs"" and ""The Sixth Sense,"" I'm sure you'll find this movie satisfying."
I:420;1731;highly recommended to fans of Shyamalan and those who like their movies with more intelligence and less whiz.
I:420;1732;Even watching it a for a second time, I still loved it.
I:420;1733;It is a very powerfully done movie!
I:420;1734;Had a few tear filled moments.
I:420;1735;First of all I have to start off saying that I wanted to see this movie because it was by the creator of Signs and Signs was a really good movie.
I:420;1736;in showing the first time, which was an awesome setting for an outdoorsy scary movie, and I loved it for the scary thrill without evil horror.
I:420;1737;And the plot twist, I was looking for it but didn't see it coming, I love that.
I:420;1738;And even though of course I knew what was going to happen, I found myself squeezing a hand and covering my eyes as if it was my first time.
I:420;1739;But I also had the advantage of knowing when my favorite parts were coming.
I:420;1740;And another deeply beautiful theme we noticed this time around was that sorrow is part of life, not a product of environment.
I:420;1741;Take it as it comes, and celebrate the good when it comes as well.
I:420;1742;Anyway, I way highly recommend this movie .
I:420;1743;I'm giving it as Christmas gifts to several people!
I:420;1744;the movie barely gets a two!
I:420;1745;Mostly the blind girl and the nice boy fall in love.
I:420;1746;I really liked Sixth Sense, but would've liked my 100 minutes back from this one.
I:420;1747;First I must say, I like this director and most of his films even unbreakable which I thought was creative.
I:420;1748;But then they go on with this great adventure into the woods when you already know there are no monsters, but you are still hoping something great will happen.
I:420;1749;You can say, yeah those monsters were pretty cool, they were creatures that evolved over time from something someting and they declared war on the village and the town had to fight hundreds of them off by the end of the film showing no clear winner, but leaving room for a sequel.
I:420;1750;I can't believe how many scathing reviews I've read about this film!The Village is at least as solid as Signs, and though none of M. Night's films are going to be like Sixth Sense again,he still puts out intelligent,exciting,mysterious,entertaing movies.
I:420;1751;thank god this movie was made because I loved every minute of it.
I:420;1752;this is a suspenseful drama with a couple of very good twists that happens to have monsters in it.
I:420;1753;The subtleties of the characters and their complex relationships is what makes this film great.
I:420;1754;And a good movie to have on hand, thanks!
I:420;1755;He is a very talented director.
I:420;1756;Which, i can understand, realizing his fantastic debut.
I:420;1757;Also, his promising followup, Unbreakable (one of my favorite films) and certainly one of the greatest comic book movies of all time.
I:420;1758;Signs was very enjoyable, a unique take on a global domination (the twist was unnecessary, but it did help propel the story along nicely).
I:420;1759;It had some nice directing, and one amazing character (adrien brody .
I:420;1760;in a hopeful preview of the joker in the sequel to nolan's Batman Begins).
I:420;1761;Don't get me wrong, this year was fantastic (Spider.
I:420;1762;"Next time I hope he treats us to a real ""twist"" and gets a separate writer for his excellent directing."
I:420;1763;fun movie to watch as far as the twist involved, although lacking in suspense.
I:420;1764;this was still an enjoyable watch!
I:420;1765;The Village and Sixth Sense are wonderful classics.
I:420;1766;lady in the Water was good too.
I:420;1767;M. Night is my favorite director and I was not disapointed.
I:420;1768;The cast did a great job in their performance and the concept was very unique.
I:420;1769;And I always love to see how M. Night gives his appearance and he did a great job in this one.
I:420;1770;I thought it was a fascinating idea.
I:420;1771;i really enjoyed this movie.
I:420;1772;The actors are all excellent and the dark and creepy mood is lightened by a sweet, innocent romance.
I:420;1773;"but others are more intriguing: Adrien Brody gives a touching performance as a mentally retarded young man who causes trouble, and Joaquin Phoenix (Walk the Line) is endearing as the gentle hero.You'll have no trouble figuring out the twist early on, but that's OK
I:420;1774;I just got back from a midnight showing of The Village.
I:420;1775;moving manipulative movie I think I have ever seen.
I:420;1776;i predict that this will be the end of M. Night's spooky film career.
I:420;1777;The cast led by Bryce Dallas Howard as Ivy Walker, Joaquin Phoenix as Lucius Hunt, Adrien Brody as Noah Percy, William Hurt as Edward Walker, Sigourney Weaver as Alice Hunt, Brendan Gleeson as August Nicholson is excellent!
I:420;1778;Their performances are just as much as excellent as well.
I:420;1779;"The master of thriller, M. Night Shyamalan, who wrote and directed ""The Sixth Sense"" (1999), ""Unbreakable"" (2000), and ""Signs"" (2002), his direction is brilliantly well crafted as is his story and screenplay."
I:420;1780;The music by James Newton Howard is brilliant and this is one of his best scores I have ever heard from him.
I:420;1781;The cinematography by Roger Deakins is excellent and well crafted.
I:420;1782;The film editing by Christopher Tellefsen is excellent.
I:420;1783;"The casting by Douglas Aibel (who did the casting to ""Unbreakable"" (2000) and ""Signs"" (2002) is excellent."
I:420;1784;The production design by Tom Foden is excellent and well designed.
I:420;1785;The art direction by Michael Manson and Chris Shriver is excellent and well crafted.
I:420;1786;The set decoration by Larry Dias is excellent and well crafted.
I:420;1787;"The costume design by Ann Roth (who costume designed ""Signs"" (2002) is excellent and well designed."
I:420;1788;This is a well made movie with intriguing and interesting performances by Howard, Phoenix, Brody, Hurt, Weaver, and Gleeson.
I:420;1789;Slower than I expected, but strange and engaging with a very Shyamalan atmosphere.
I:420;1790;Bryce Dallas Howard was excellent (and beautiful) in her portrayal of courage and integrity in the face of enormous challenge.
I:420;1791;Joaquin Phoenix is also very good (as usual).
I:420;1792;The Village is a good movie, but people keep expecting it to be a really scary movie with some sort of HUGE twist at the end.
I:420;1793;It isn't a scary movie (as the advertising seems to indicate), but it is suspenseful.
I:420;1794;"he's doing very well proving the ""Barnum rule"" correct."
I:420;1795;Very thought provoking and entertaining.
I:420;1796;Hurt is becoming like Jack Nicholson .
I:420;1797;Brody's performance was also solid.
I:420;1798;He's drawn comparisons to Hitchcock and Spielberg .
I:420;1799;Resting on the laurels of exactly ONE good movie, he manages to eek out a career for himself.
I:420;1800;UNBREAKABLE was fair at best.
I:420;1801;An interesting idea with a dull, rumbling ride to the conclusion.
I:420;1802;and I really do wish I could enjoy his movies.
I:420;1803;"Bryce Howard is a wonderful actress
I:420;1804;The other cast members also played their parts wonderfully .
I:420;1805;"but nothing to make the ""trick"" ending worth the ride."
I:420;1806;and I think that's good because we need a writer/director who can come up with good stories and good twists.
I:420;1807;The Sixth sense was was amazing, Signs I consider one of the best invasion movies of all time, but Unbreakable was probably one of the top 5 most boring movies I've ever seen in my life, so i knew that there was a good chance that this movie wasn't going to be great.
I:420;1808;it isn't great, but it is really good.
I:420;1809;It was a great mystery in which I had no idea where it was going until the last moment.
I:420;1810;Night obviously has a vivid and creative imagination, and I hope he keeps coming up with great stories, some of which I'm sure won't be good, but nobodies perfect.
I:420;1811;Night has a great style and mind, and I cannot wait for his next attempt, which hopefully won't be as bad as unbreakable.
I:420;1812;The Village is a good movie with a good story and I found it very satisfying.
I:420;1813;On one hand, I was excited because I am such a fan of most of M. Night Shyamalan's other work ( The Sixth Sense and Signs , most notably).
I:420;1814;If, however, you go into this wanting to watch an often subtle observation of an intimate community, and a precious story of love's power, then you will be quite pleased.
I:420;1815;I avoided all the publicity about M. Night Shyamalan's fourth film so that I could make up my own mind.
I:420;1816;As we are introduced to life in the community we learn about the strange rules under which its inhabitants live.
I:420;1817;most of that you can pick up from the trailers for The Village.
I:420;1818;first, given that he has backed himself in a corner it terms of always having to come up with some big secret twist for all of his films, Shyamalan does try to come up with something to meet the raised expectations.
I:420;1819;As we know from Signs and the rest of his films if there is one thing Shyamalan can do it is that everything fits together in the end.
I:420;1820;This is a breakthrough performance, which may well be the only thing that everybody who sees The Village is going to agree on.
I:420;1821;Also, his spin on the scripts causes the viewer to pause and think and start a dialogue with friends.
I:420;1822;I have been a faithful Amazon shopper for years and recommend it to all my friends, but as of today this may change!
I:420;1823;well, visually this movie is fantastic.
I:420;1824;It's atmospheric, spooky, vivid and wonderfully shot.
I:420;1825;The score is also tremendous and deserves to be part of a more fulfilling movie.
I:420;1826;I felt moved during the movie.
I:420;1827;I thought it was interesting.
I:420;1828;I still remember how cool, original, mysterious and exciting this movie looked and how I waited for it to come out.
I:420;1829;Even if I'd never seen the marketing, this movie sets itself up as a thriller, and then it deflates itself.
I:420;1830;"In the end, it's unsatisfying as a thriller, as a romantic drama, and as a ""twist"" movie."
I:420;1831;Because I liked the village!
I:420;1832;"A very pleasant surprise, The Village, brings to the screen exactly what the title implies: the story of a remote village along with its inhabitants!But that is not all
I:420;1833;Most importantly, it brings attention to and succeeds in making people aware of the existence of Protestant fundamentalists and the sheer power of manipulation.
I:420;1834;The plot, the setting, the dialogues, and the costumes are all wonderful!The Village is a very good movie, guaranteed to provide an evening's entertainment.
I:420;1835;In addition, it is one of those films that gets you and keeps you thinking long after it's over.
I:420;1836;"overall, it is a movie definitely worth watching
I:420;1837;I went into the theatre with an open mind, and took the story as it was told.
I:420;1838;It unfolded very smoothly and I completely understood it.
I:420;1839;It was good, and I thought in Hollywood where all movies were after all 'stories', this was a very good one told.
I:420;1840;second, The acting:This was the best.
I:420;1841;The movie was carried very well by Bryce Dallas Howard and Joaquin Phoenix.
I:420;1842;Both were very very good actors.
I:420;1843;He exhibits the style of the sixth sense here .
I:420;1844;visuals: Cinematography and art direction was great, given the plot.
I:420;1845;overall: This is a good movie.
I:420;1846;Yes, the film has good atmosphere and great cinematography, which many of the reviewers note.
I:420;1847;"Good performances by ""elders"" William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver."
I:420;1848;"This film is all about the journey, and every time I watch it I still have that sense of wonder the first time I watched the movie, ""What is going on in this village?"
I:420;1849;The acting is all top.
I:420;1850;notch, especially Bryce Dallace Howard, and this was her first major role as a leading actress and it shows why this was the that broke her in to the mainstream, she is simply amazing as the blind girl Ivy.
I:420;1851;Joaquin Phoenix, before jumping off the deep end and making his mocumentary, is equally fantastic as Lucius.
I:420;1852;William Hurt, and Sigourney Weaver, Adrien Brody are all fantastic.
I:420;1853;even if you watch this movie and still hate it, the one thing that stands out more than any of the actors, set pieces, or plot devises is the beautiful and enchanting score with the Hilary Hahn's amazing violin playing at the forefront.
I:420;1854;I still listen to the soundrack to this day, and I will most likely until the day I die.
I:420;1855;There is a reason it was nominated for best score, it is exquisite and really elevates the movie overall.
I:420;1856;Regardless of what inspired the film however, it is a beautiful and haunting film with a slow pace that reveals itself and its intentions slowly.
I:420;1857;fashioned love/suspense story, you may find it quite enjoyable.
I:420;1858;I've enjoyed all of M. Night Shyamalan's films, but each one is a little weaker than the last.
I:420;1859;Overall, I'd say The Village is a watchable film.3.3.5 stars
I:420;1860;I thought it was going to be good.
I:420;1861;This film has some interesting ideas of the nature of Fear as tool to control using an isolationist Amish style community as its setting.
I:420;1862;The cast does the best it can with the script and implausible plot.
I:420;1863;The acting was really great, and Bryce Dallas Howard was awesome.
I:420;1864;I agree with several reviewers who said that this movie was far more romantic than being scary, and the ending.
I:420;1865;I just hope the next movie he does will be up to the standards of The Sixth Sense, and Signs!
I:420;1866;In fact, Bryce Dallas Howard, daughter of director Ronnie Howard, proves to be a surprised bright spot.
I:420;1867;the village is about a small amish town that is surrounded by a forest.
I:420;1868;his performance is very entertaining, and is the only reason i would watch this movie again
I:420;1869;I was excited to see it when it came out so I went to the cinema.
I:420;1870;"the first thing I thought about this movie is, it's a very ambitious one, because of the name of the pic, ""M. Night Shyamalan's The Village"", i mean, ""the Village"" is not a very appealing name, and the look at cast, i don't know anyone except Joaquin Phoenix (that's my problem, i know, but let's face it, i'm not the only one, right?)"
I:420;1871;"i'd say that ""The Village"" can be highlighted as one of the Mr. Shyamalan finest works, expect the first half of the flim do not have a lot of good climax."
I:420;1872;The Village is a great story, take it for what it is.
I:420;1873;That is EXACTLY why his movies are good.
I:420;1874;he is a master of unpredictable story telling, creating intimate settings that draw the viewer in, and using minimal suggestions to keep the audience on the edge of its seat.
I:420;1875;"All I got out of it was that these people living in a ""colonial"" era like village for some reason within a scary forest, right about now in the twenty."
I:420;1876;the atmosphere of the film and the direction is excellent.
I:420;1877;But as I said, the direction is top.
I:420;1878;This movie was better than the Sixth Sense and Signs.
I:420;1879;Seriously, if you are looking for a suspenseful, heart.
I:420;1880;well, it is about a blind girl (Ivy, I think, right?)
I:420;1881;, who we learn are actually the villagers dressed up in costumes.
I:420;1882;alright, so the story starts out with the blind girl (who has an amazing sense of direction, even running in perfectly straight lines without need of assistance) and her friends.
I:420;1883;So, continuing, she finds a road, and with surprising clarity, runs down it and into a wall, which she marvelously scales, and falls down on the other side just as a ranger.
I:420;1884;If you want a comedy, this is a great movie to pick apart.
I:420;1885;Completely smart, very scary, beautifully shot.
I:420;1886;I liked it better than all of M. Night Shamalayanadahan's movies put together, including The Sixth Sense counted twice.
I:420;1887;"Husband and I kept looking at each other and saying, ""This movie is so cool."""
I:420;1888;Just watch it, and don't anticipate anything while you watch.
I:420;1889;I was scared out of my skin, but I went to bed happy and slept fine.
I:420;1890;In the case of the Village, we have a beautifully recreated 19th century town, a flawless cast, and a genuinely creepy concept to work with.
I:420;1891;Shyamalan is a truly gifted filmmaker and has created some amazing and frightening film moments, however, applying the same formula for the fourth time seems to reveal a level of insecurtiy or fear, that an artist of his calibre should have outgrown by now.
I:420;1892;But it seems that he wanted the suprise ending there at all costs, and in this case, it cost him the chance to finally break the mold and mature as an artist.
I:420;1893;In his previous films, the twist was essential to the story, it made everything make sense.
I:420;1894;It was a huge improvement over Signs, but certainly not in the same class as The Sixth Sense.
I:420;1895;It's a look into the heart of darkness, so to speak.
I:420;1896;In the end, The Village does a nice job giving us an answer.
I:420;1897;In part, because Shyamalan's storytelling approach.
I:420;1898;keeps us from probing deeply and fully its core theme.
I:420;1899;We see a hint of a scary figure.
I:420;1900;I started watching thinking that it would be horror, but pleasantly and surprising it was worth watching to the end.
I:420;1901;"As usual the ending will surprise you just as the Bruce Willis ""Sixth Sense"" did."
I:420;1902;Not a horror film, not for those who are looking for chills, but a truly beautiful tale of love and devotion, set against a background of fear.
I:420;1903;The Village is an amazing movie.
I:420;1904;In terms of atmosphere, pacing, score, and cinematography, it is possibly M. Night Shyamalan's masterpiece.
I:420;1905;The cast including William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, and Joaquin Phoenix is excellent.
I:420;1906;Adrien Brody and especially Bryce Dallas Howard give top.
I:420;1907;The extras are superb, and there are many goodies waiting to be uncovered.
I:420;1908;"interesting ""Unbreakable"", the excellent ""Signs"", and another masterstroke in ""The Village"", the only question many movie fans have left is."
I:420;1909;For a lot of people that's the only reason they dismised this film.
I:420;1910;"A certain philosopher once said, ""There is always some madness in love."
I:420;1911;In good condition, deffinatly an interesting plot line.
I:420;1912;I am pleased with the product.
I:420;1913;First of all, Shyamalan is a great filmmaker, but I hated this movie for one reason: the major twist.
I:420;1914;Now twists are good, if they are used right, as in The Sixth Sense.
I:420;1915;The first two thirds of the movie is very entertaining, with good performances by Joaquin Phoenix and a very good performance by Adrien Brody, but once the monsters are out of the picture, it takes a deep dive into awfulness never to recover.
I:420;1916;And did you know the 'Night' part of his name is something he came up with himself.
I:420;1917;It's actually kind of cute.
I:420;1918;Part of the fun of Shyamalan's films is trying to guess the twist (or twists), since he has a mystery writer's flair for doling out clues and misdirection as you go.
I:420;1919;Within days of seeing this film, my wife and I had to watch it again, because it is simply great storytelling.
I:420;1920;It is a movie about believable people dealing with their fears, whatever their basis.
I:420;1921;"Beautiful, romantic, thoughtful and intriguing, ""the Village"" is worth repeated visits."
I:420;1922;Marvellously gripping and spooky film with great acting.
I:420;1923;This film contrasts very simple touching lives with the horror story threaded through it and is set against a wonderfully picturesque rural scene of an almost Victorian America.
I:420;1924;Its ultimate message is profound regarding what damaging lengths we can go to when a collective of traumatised people come together to 'protect' their loved ones from the ills and harm of modern society.
I:420;1925;He got it, but I have a feeling next weekend won't fare so well.
I:420;1926;with UNBREAKABLE and SIGNS, Shymalan created a good story and interesting characters before ruining the films with absurd endings.
I:420;1927;newcomer Bryce Dallas Howard (Ron Howard's daughter) proves surprisingly charming even though the somewhat stunted dialogue she's given doesn't leave a lot to work with.
I:420;1928;There are some effective moments, but they are FEW and far between.
I:420;1929;I usually go for movies like The Great Escape, It's a Wonderful Life, Anne, and Lord of the Rings, and this.
I:420;1930;but horror or no horror aside, it's a movie full of themes.
I:420;1931;and that's what makes the movie so good.
I:420;1932;It is *very* worth watching.
I:420;1933;Secondly, it's a chick flick.
I:420;1934;It'll save you the eight bucks and provide a bigger scare.
I:420;1935;Mind you, I hate saying this because the acting was good, the cinematography was good, and it was an attractive looking film.
I:420;1936;Luckily, Roger Ebert and many other reviewers have the ability.
I:420;1937;But there are a few things that really propel the movie to the edge of great film.
I:420;1938;You just have to see it all unfold and think about it to see why.
I:420;1939;"When it's over, though, and it settles in, you see that this is, perhaps, the ""truest"" horror movie ever screened."
I:420;1940;Also, James Newton Howard's score and Hillary Hahn's rendition of it can rip your heart out .
I:420;1941;alone worth the ticket price.
I:420;1942;known reason it kept you hangin' till the end.
I:420;1943;Without further ado, I give you A Letter to M. Night Shyamalan.
I:420;1944;i am pleased to tell you that I am an avid fan of you and your films.
I:420;1945;Through these three films, you have crafted pure cinematic genius.
I:420;1946;As per your other films, moviegoers greedily expected another gem in The Village, complete with the signature surprise ending that shocks the audience and reveals the mystery.
I:420;1947;I was shocked, yet I still see a mystery.
I:420;1948;There is a 19th century Pennsylvania town, inhabited by roughly 100 individuals, and are kept there peacefully, under the menacing watch of creatures which reside in the woods.
I:420;1949;On the contrary, I encourage viewers to see the film, yet only to keep a VERY OPEN mind during the process.
I:420;1950;i conclude this letter with a plea.
I:420;1951;M. Night Shyamalan, please continue to make movies.
I:420;1952;Your previous films were entertaining, innovative, marvelous, and often humorous.
I:420;1953;Scare us, shock us, frighten us, and by all means entertain us.
I:420;1954;First of all I love this movie for the love story, the scenery, and the unique way it shows how fear can control us.
I:420;1955;First of all the cast selected was superb.
I:420;1956;Even when there are no monsters they become real when they are created in our minds.
I:420;1957;That way everyone's own imagination will create their own nightmare.
I:420;1958;I have watched this movie many times (I am as I'm writing this) and I see new things to admire about it everytime.
I:420;1959;it is the 2nd best movie of Mr. Shyamalan.
I:420;1960;great actors, good story, nice costumes and a delicious and delicate soundtrack.
I:420;1961;a recommended movie for everyone, does not contain vulgar language, or sex, or nudity.
I:420;1962;open your mind and gives you an opportunity to this wonderful movie.
I:420;1963;Suspenseful, romantic, and thought provoking.
I:420;1964;I love this movie and I've seen it several times.
I:420;1965;I saw previews and this movie looks good.
I:420;1966;let me say that this movie is more funny than scary.
I:420;1967;Let me preface by saying I'm a huge fan of the writer.
I:420;1968;i was the first of anyone I knew to see The Sixth Sense and Signs.
I:420;1969;I recommended both movies to everyone, though some folks didn't like Signs (I'm guessing they didn't get the message?)
I:420;1970;so payoff at the end,) then this is the movie for you.
I:420;1971;i would rate it a solid B+.
I:420;1972;The best directors of the genre create truly great films, which just happened to give the audience a scare.
I:420;1973;A truly surprising ending for the director now, would be no surprise at all.
I:420;1974;where Shyamalan excels is his Hitchcockian use of suspense.
I:420;1975;He understands that some of the best thrills come not from something jumping straight out at the audience, but in what we don't see.
I:420;1976;For Shyamalan understands that our imaginations are more powerful than any piece of costuming or CG effect.
I:420;1977;There were, in fact, several moments during my first viewing of the film that hand my hair standing on end.
I:420;1978;These were tense, beautifully paced moments.
I:420;1979;the film also creates a masterful sense of mood.
I:420;1980;The color scheme, set design and costuming are all top notch.
I:420;1981;The acting, for the most part, is quite good.
I:420;1982;There several interweaving human stories set amongst the supernatural tale, some of which are quite moving.
I:420;1983;The story no longer captivated me as it did the first time.
I:420;1984;it is a film worth a first viewing.
I:420;1985;Shyalaman is a true talent, and I look forward to his next film.
I:420;1986;In a sense the Village is really two stories.
I:420;1987;One is a suspenseful tale of creatures lurking in the dark, and the other of a quaint village dealing with extraordinary circumstances.
I:420;1988;I must say that before I saw it, I saw the preview and thought to myslef how great and scary the movie looks.
I:420;1989;SO I was sceptical about seeing it.
I:420;1990;But I went anyway and I have to say that I loved it.
I:420;1991;acting 10/10 (especially for Bryce Dallas Howard's character)Storyline 8/10Twist 8/10 (not rocket science, but i couldn't figure it out at all up until the end: that is what I call good cinema)Cinematography 8/10 sets the mood very wellOverall 8.5/10 clever, intriguing, and sinisterly haunting.
I:420;1992;Once again, we are faced with a suspense.
I:420;1993;heavy plot with a twist at the end, and once again this sacrifices a bit of forward motion.
I:420;1994;There are a series of twists at the end, with the least surprising involving a well.
I:420;1995;this was another strong outing by M. Night, and was also a refreshing break from movies in which overly.
I:420;1996;I was so excited about seeing The Village.
I:420;1997;I can see why they wanted that for a bunch of reasons.
I:420;1998;The movie has a lot of plot twists and the story takes some major changes.
I:420;1999;If you knew about the changes you probaly wont enjoy the movie as much.
I:420;2000;the movie is sold as one of the scariest movies you will ever see.
I:420;2001;For the last six months all we've seen in the trailers and advertising is how scary this is.
I:420;2002;She was great as the blind girl Ivy Walker.
I:420;2003;She really runs with the movie and is brillant.
I:420;2004;She's funny in places and she's dramatic in others.
I:420;2005;Joaquin Phoneix was great in the movie, well when he's in it.
I:420;2006;William Hurt was also good as well.
I:420;2007;the sets in The Village were great.
I:420;2008;The town looks authentic and the forest is pretty cool.
I:420;2009;The music was pretty good as well.
I:420;2010;The acting and sets are good in the movie, the story just kills it.
I:420;2011;On a style level, it is remarkable.
I:420;2012;The sets, the acting and the photography are first.
I:420;2013;It's worth seeing for these elements alone.
I:420;2014;"rate as always, but, like ""Signs""."
I:420;2015;i did something before seeing this movie that I don't normally do: I read just about every critic's review of the film.
I:420;2016;That film was so good and the twist at the end so mind.
I:420;2017;"Unbreakable was a wonderful film giving us a glimpse of the mythical ""hero's journey"" and ""Signs"", while not very good, was effective in at least building tension before it finally petered out with no payoff."
I:420;2018;Already, there is a tense energy in the air.
I:420;2019;He does so, against their wishes, but is witnessed by one of the creatures to be in their territory.
I:420;2020;The creatures come into town, leaving red marks on every door of every building.
I:420;2021;Animals are found skinned with twisted necks.
I:420;2022;He is brave and he knows how to handle himself.
I:420;2023;"It's Shyamalan's finest film since ""The Sixth Sense"" and exactly what ""Signs"" should have been: smartly written, incredibly clever, beautifully shot, and actually creepy."
I:420;2024;As Ivy, she is very much human and has fears and worries like the rest of her neighbors.
I:420;2025;The trailers for The Village looked really good.
I:420;2026;I especially liked the one that showed clips of M. Night Shyamalan's past films.
I:420;2027;They introduced the film as M. Night Shyamalan's The Village.
I:420;2028;the creatures randomly enter the village and leaves signs of their existence like red slash marks on the doors, skinned animals, and sightings.
I:420;2029;While out, she is chased by a creature and has to be clever in order to escape it.
I:420;2030;She is able to reach the town and return with supplies.
I:420;2031;of course, with this being a Shyamalan film, you can expect to see a twist.
I:420;2032;the actors do a good job.
I:420;2033;Like I said, I was really excited about the film because of the trailers.
I:420;2034;"If you want to see a Shyamalan film to make you jump, see ""Sixth Sense."""
I:420;2035;A drama film with some of the most beautiful direction and characters i have ever seen.
I:420;2036;Appreciate it for what it is: a message to the human race.
I:420;2037;"After viewing ""The Village,"" you may find yourself asking if love is as strong as fear these days."
I:420;2038;"I loved ""Sixth Sense"" ."
I:420;2039;"I really liked ""Signs"" ."
I:420;2040;I love scary movies, and this isn't one of them.
I:420;2041;I heard M. Night say in a recent interview that The Village is his personal favorite of all the films he has done.
I:420;2042;It evolved into more of a love story than anything else.
I:420;2043;i think this film is clever, witty and interesting.
I:420;2044;The flirty banter between the two main characters is great.
I:420;2045;The acting is absolutely superb.
I:420;2046;I particularly enjoy William Hurt's performance.
I:420;2047;The tone of the film that Shyamalan creates is even and consistent throughout.
I:420;2048;The score may be the best that Newton.
I:420;2049;This is the art of film.
I:420;2050;It is a good (if not exceptional) thriller.
I:420;2051;Good acting, good cinematography with an interesting plot.You may really enjoy it, if you do not expect what the marketing was promising.
I:420;2052;"Another one is the woods everybody is forbidden to enter it
I:420;2053;at the moment the film starts this agreement is endangered and the villagers are scared of what may happen with them.
I:420;2054;from this point on a good suspense story evolves keeping the viewer wondering what's all about.
I:420;2055;acting is one of the high points of the film.
I:420;2056;bryce Dallas Howard as Ivy the blind girl gives a very convincing performance.
I:420;2057;adrien Brody as a retarded youngster is great.
I:420;2058;William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver also give solid acting pieces.
I:420;2059;"director M. Night Shyamalan conducts the film with sure hand, even if it is not at the same height as ""Sixth Sense"" (his best film by far)."
I:420;2060;finally: a good thriller if you seat to see it without prejudice.
I:420;2061;I could enjoy this movie in August 2004 when I visited the US for pleasure.
I:420;2062;"This is not a film which can be easily set into a group
I:420;2063;Of course I did not know many actors but they made the film work, and work fine.
I:420;2064;There is a huge twist at the end that I may not be the biggest fan of but know M. Night Shyamalans work you had to expect it.
I:420;2065;What Mr. Shyamalan should do is keep his films simple.
I:420;2066;The acting is good, but their all acting on the same level.
I:420;2067;Ron Howards doughter is one of the stars in the film, but can she do better.
I:420;2068;Shyamalan is a master at telling a simple story, however, and there are moments when he breathes an amazing amount of new life into scenes we have seen a thousand times before.
I:420;2069;Even though The Village is my least favorite film of Shyamalan's, he remains an exciting and original director that I love to watch.
I:420;2070;Shyamalan, the director of three of the most interesting and well.
I:420;2071;That 1999 thriller came out of the blue and captured its audience with the nuance of its narrative and.
I:420;2072;He followed it up with Unbreakable, an underrated film that had plenty of potent drama but seemed less natural in its flow.
I:420;2073;In 2002, we got Signs, one of the finest films of that year, but another that (looking at it recently) seemed more distanced and tidy.
I:420;2074;He's made The Village now, and he's reached the end of his rope.
I:420;2075;The main issue is that the persona of the director has overriden the creative material itself.
I:420;2076;James Newton Howard's score is quite mediocre most of the time, but every once in a while a flourish of rapid violins takes it up a notch.
I:420;2077;Village meetings and other gatherings of the like are as wooden as the structures around them, and Adrien Brody proves yet again that his best role will always be the one in The Thin Red Line.
I:420;2078;what about the underlying themes, the scary moments, and the plot that gets ever.
I:420;2079;Most of those moments are kind of negated, thanks to the fact that we've been trained like Pavlov's dog to slobber for the twist by the opening credits.
I:420;2080;I was impressed with a few scenes: an early encounter with 'The Ones of Whom We Do Not Speak' (I corrected it from what it is in the movie because, well, it's grammatically incorrect) is quite suspenseful, just about any scene that Howard has is watchable, and a later chase in the woods is downright exciting if you don't think about it too much.
I:420;2081;twist) of the movie is quite intelligent, if it only hadn't been discarded soon after.
I:420;2082;headed thematic message that I found to be flat.
I:420;2083;This was an excellent movie.
I:420;2084;even for all of the bad press that this movie got, and all of the disgruntled viewers who were expecting another horror, this truly is one of my favorites from M. Night Shyamalan .
I:420;2085;fest marathons, but movies that are suspenseful and thought.
I:420;2086;At least after seeing this in the theatre, I felt that I'd gotten my money's worth for the ticket price, and this is definitely a movie that I feel I could watch repeatedly.
I:420;2087;with every film he writes and directs, he TRIES.
I:420;2088;what I like about his films is how he lays the pieces of a puzzle for you and forces you to interact.
I:420;2089;Night is a talented individual who's best is still to come and in time I hope he relies less on smoke and mirrors.
I:420;2090;he's a good shooter and man can he inject heart in his films.
I:420;2091;*** honorable mention: Bryce Dallas Howard's debut is worth seeing.
I:420;2092;This is classic M. Night Shymalan, with a plot twist at the end that completely took me by surprise when I first saw it.
I:420;2093;I would recommend you watch this once.
I:420;2094;For some reason she is able to navigate the forest perfectly, even to the point of remembering where things were.
I:420;2095;M. Night Shymalan is probably one of my favorite directors.
I:420;2096;In any case, the movie was visually stunning and the premise of the movie was quite unusual and thought provoking.
I:420;2097;Again, Joaquin does a wonderful job and Bryce Howard was superb.
I:420;2098;It started off interesting and I thought it had a good storyline and the after a while it fell off a cliff.
I:420;2099;the acting is pretty good and the actors themselves help to build the tension throughout the movie.
I:420;2100;It started off so good, amazing even.
I:420;2101;The acting was phenomenal, I will even give it that.
I:420;2102;I heard the reviews of this movie, so I was sceptical of it and waited a while to see it.
I:420;2103;It was thought provoking and interesting, and the acting and directing was unbelievable.
I:420;2104;knit community lives with the frightening knowledge that creatures reside in the surrounding woods, and no one will venture beyond the borders of the village and into the woods.
I:420;2105;quite a cast!This Manoj Night Shyamalan creation is his best yet.
I:420;2106;The subtle nuances of the characters are brilliantly done and the slowly built up suspense works to make this a thriller and a mystery.
I:420;2107;I was captivated by this movie.
I:420;2108;The Village takes us on a journey through one of the greatest stories ever told.
I:420;2109;The way it was written, directed and acted are outstanding.
I:420;2110;They don't see the brilliance in what M. Night did to make this an amazing movie.
I:420;2111;Can love overcome evil?The Village is a whirlwind journey through thriller, romance, drama, and yes.
I:420;2112;brilliant directing, writing, and acting .
I:420;2113;M Night, is definitely one of the greatest filmmakers around.
I:420;2114;I guess I am in the minority, but I really enjoyed The Village.
I:420;2115;I also loved Signs, but not for the alien stuff.
I:420;2116;I loved the story of a man losing his faith and finding it again.
I:420;2117;It is a story about love and truth.
I:420;2118;The acting is superb (although I agree with other reviewers that the talent of Adrian Brody seemed wasted as Noah, the village idiot).
I:420;2119;The cinematography was so incredible.
I:420;2120;The subtle play of light and color added layers of meaning and emotion to every scene.
I:420;2121;"however, if you want to plumb the depths of love and truth
I:420;2122;"With the exception of ""Signs,"" every film that M. Night Shyamalan has made is extremely overrated."
I:420;2123;The Village tells the story of a group of people living in an isolated community that is surrounded by woods.
I:420;2124;but trust me, Shyamalan manages to screw it up.
I:420;2125;"So far the only film he has succeeded with is ""Signs""."
I:420;2126;I first begin with, the only reason I give this review two stars is the marvelous acting Adrien Brody put forth, as always, in this movie.
I:420;2127;Despite my unwillingness to see Signs, I saw it, and enjoyed it, surprisingly.
I:420;2128;But the idea of the film sounded great.
I:420;2129;Shyamalan knows what he is doing and also, let's face it, he has his own peculiar style.
I:420;2130;"personally I think that the critic of fear as a way to manipulate people is very interesting
I:420;2131;the director has created a beautiful package for an irrelevant story.
I:420;2132;The locations, the colors and the music just wrapped something that is a project of what could have been an inetresting film.
I:420;2133;enjoy at your own risk.
I:420;2134;Anyone who's seen the trailer for this movie is led to believe it's a story of a town besieged by giant man.
I:420;2135;it's not your fault though, you've been led to believe this will be a horror movie about trolls and what not, when all it really is is a love story.
I:420;2136;It's a tale of the limits a town is willing to go to protect its innocence.
I:420;2137;But if you judge this movie on the fact that it was not the movie you thought you were going to see, then you're depriving yourself of seeing the great movie that it is.
I:420;2138;it's a fairy tale of a blind girl that finds true love and is willing to go to any length to save her love on one end and what a town is willing to do to protect it's self from the evils of the world on the other.
I:420;2139;This really is a beautiful movie done very skillfully and delightful to see.
I:420;2140;The only way you can molest an audience further is switching and promising a love story that turns out to be a horror movie.
I:420;2141;Unbreakable was advertised as an action movie and Signs lead you to believe it was a movie about aliens invading.
I:420;2142;Its funny how the marketers make you think that the backdrop of the movie (such as aliens invading or a town besieged by monster) is the plot.
I:420;2143;Evil monsters that threaten a town, that's the kinda movie that puts people in the theater.
I:420;2144;They showed you what you thought you were going to see.
I:420;2145;Shame on them for ruining a good movie.
I:420;2146;That would have made a really great film .
I:420;2147;The movie seems to flow very well.
I:420;2148;"There is some nice comic relief such as when a group of youths play ""chicken"" against the creatures by going into the woods and seeing how long they can try to attract the creatures before chickening out."
I:420;2149;I thought the acting and the story were pretty good.
I:420;2150;This is worth checking out
I:420;2151;Pheonix and Howard give magnetic and powerful performances.
I:420;2152;Brody once again proves he can act good.
I:420;2153;Having enjoyed THE SIXTH SENSE immensely and finding UNBREAKABLE fairly so, I had expectations for this film, even though it received mostly negative critical response.
I:420;2154;THE VILLAGE is atmospheric and Roger Deakins cinematography is sometimes breathtakingly beautiful, as is James Newton Howard's haunting and evocative score.
I:420;2155;Bryce Dallas Howard owns the movie with her controlled, passionate performance as Ivy.
I:420;2156;Oscar winner Adrien Brody isn't very impressive either in his role as the obvious village idiot.
I:420;2157;First M. Night Movie I've seen.
I:420;2158;One of THE best movies I've seen in awhile.
I:420;2159;I enjoy suspense and plot twists.
I:420;2160;See it for yourself, then you decide.
I:420;2161;Great Plot, Great Twists, Great Acting, Great Score, Great Costuming, Great Direction .
I:420;2162;At least, that is how I interpret the movie.
I:420;2163;"i believe it is well done and very clever
I:420;2164;I love the story of a society whom decided they wanted to move away from the overly complex and corrupt society of the common world in order to live more simply and peacefully.
I:420;2165;Director M. Night Shayamalan makes cool and interesting movies.
I:420;2166;As far as I'm concerned, that's a more riveting picture than the overly lackluster M. Night 'canvas.
I:420;2167;In fact, stay home and read some HP Lovecraft, and you're bound for a far more entertaining night.
I:420;2168;in all of M. Night's intriguing films, and this is not sarcastic, I do love his films, he uses a formula.
I:420;2169;And, I loved 'Signs', even enjoyed 'Unbreakable' albeit overly depressing, and yes, 'The Sixth Sense' gets me, even to this day.
I:420;2170;'Are You Afraid of the Dark' accomplished that better.
I:420;2171;All the characters are flawed, even William Hurt's, one of America's finest actors.
I:420;2172;with the acting there, but directed nowhere(thanks to Hollywood's finest.
I:420;2173;It's far more intelligent, and if you want great thrills, that actually are thrills, then you'd be happy.
I:420;2174;I guessed the twist ending along time in advance, and even if you don't it's still not very good.
I:420;2175;But something in the woods also keeps the people inside the village.
I:420;2176;Then it becomes a thriller, a mystery to be solved.
I:420;2177;By the end it has totally, completely changed in setting, theme, everything.
I:420;2178;The end brings this flash of insight to what the whole film was about and you understand that the Monsters were never in the woods.
I:420;2179;A town surrounded by woods that have creatures prowling in them.
I:420;2180;And so, this community has thrived safely for many years.
I:420;2181;There are few scary moments in this movie, but they are very effective.
I:420;2182;Their relationship drives the events of the movie, and all three do an excellent job with their characters.
I:420;2183;The biggest role of the three, surprisingly, is Ivy's.
I:420;2184;Unfortunate, but at least it gives Howard a platform to show that she has what it takes to be a great actress.
I:420;2185;If it was explained int he film somewhere what is going on and why, then I mustve missed it, most likely because I fell asleep both times I wacthed it, one in the theatre, and one at home.
I:420;2186;the acting is good and the plot is superb.
I:420;2187;over the last few years, the supernatural thriller genre has belonged solely to one individual: writer/director M. Night Shyamalan.
I:420;2188;None have the courage to venture beyond the forbidden border, except Lucius Hunt, the head strong yet reserved son of Alice Hunt, one of the town elders.
I:420;2189;with as talented an accumulation of performers as is seen in The Village, the most high.
I:420;2190;All Shyamalan films contain a lead role that tests even the most skilled of actors and Howard is able to tackle the role easily without showing once any inability to rise to the challenge, which indicates she could be a rising star in Hollywood if she continues to give prime performances such as this.
I:420;2191;Joaquin Phoenix, in the role of Lucius Hunt, demonstrates that he certainly has the charisma and talent to lead a film with an engaging and emotionally driven performance, far exceeding the role given to him for Signs.
I:420;2192;In other aspects of the film, James Newton Howard is once again able to calibrate a successful and chilling musical score that works directly in sync with the actions on screen, as he has been able to do in all of Shyamalan's films in the past.
I:420;2193;And even though Shyamalan's engaging sense of direction allows the psychological intensity of the film to remain intact through nearly the entire presentation, the less then surprising outcomes makes it out to be all for naught.
I:420;2194;The Village is the first Shyamalan thriller that eliminates the sense of fear movie.
I:420;2195;Whether it is a political allegory or merely a coincidence, either way you slice it The Village is a sure.
I:420;2196;I really enjoyed it and never guessed the twist at the end.
I:420;2197;making and adds a few modern twists.
I:420;2198;There is a clear connection to the twoHowever, M. night has he own style and man, can he add emotions to even the simplest scenes.
I:420;2199;I mean it prob one of his best films and certainly touched a larger auidence but the guy does have more to offer than this and its a tad unfair to always compare every movie he makes to that one really but him on the map.
I:420;2200;When we live in a world of fast, cellioud, popcorn movies, it is both re.
I:420;2201;He is a story teller first and film maker second and has demonstrated 4 times now that he can deliver on both.
I:420;2202;UnBreakable was never going to live up to the 6th Sense but still delivers a interesting, fasinating story that held me to the end with a conclusion that was so obvious but yet not expected by me.
I:420;2203;Signs was a major commerical hit and once again deliver a fine story that was excuted in a way that just oozed emotion and interest for any viewer who likes a good story and film.
I:420;2204;Lastly The Village provides another great tale with brooding emotion.
I:420;2205;But what the man SHOULD be awarded for is his ability to create a great emotional drama.
I:420;2206;M. night is a serious film maker who develops emotional stories first and adds the supernatural elements second.
I:420;2207;a brillant film that moves slowly but constintely and will hold for those who appriectate a good tale with dramatic flair.
I:420;2208;keep it up M. night !!!!
I:420;2209;"What I was expecting from ""The Village"" was a supernatural thriller about some mysterious creatures in the woods."
I:420;2210;What I got was an allegory on morality, power, and fear.
I:420;2211;I wanted to be moved and enthralled and entertained.
I:420;2212;The strengths of Shyamalan's previous mainstream movies have always been the characters and the relationships between them.
I:420;2213;This relationship is the heart of this film and is crucial to the life of the story.
I:420;2214;handed and abrupt, but Howard and Phoenix manage to smooth out the kinks with their charm).
I:420;2215;This is most evident in the final moments of the film when the last line of dialogue is uttered.
I:420;2216;"What I see in ""The Village"" is two separate films: a love story about sacrifice and courage, and a philosophical meditation on fear and control."
I:420;2217;The love between Ivy and Lucius is deeply moving in its simplicity and purity.
I:420;2218;"Although not quite as memorable as some of Shyamalan's other pictures, the presentation of ""The Village"" possesses an alluring beauty in Roger Deakin's cinematography and James Newton Howard's music."
I:420;2219;the best example of this is the scene where Ivy stands by an open door and waits for Lucius in the midst of danger.
I:420;2220;It is a captivating moment, full of power and grace in its lyrical images and engaging violin melody.
I:420;2221;Like all great cinema, the sequence is noteworthy not only for what you can see on the surface (a story element that vividly crystallizes Ivy's and Lucius' love) but also for what you can sense underneath (a subtle reflection on blindness, fear, love, vulnerability and courage).
I:420;2222;"of all of M. Night Shyamalan's mainstream films, ""The Village"" is my least favorite."
I:420;2223;As a social commentary, it is thought.
I:420;2224;now the Acting&writing is hit&Miss,but the Back drops really showcase&highlight the film.
I:420;2225;Shyamalan's previous films, The sixth sense, Unbreakable, and Signs I enjoy.
I:420;2226;I think that this film, and all of his following films, is where Shyamalan's ego really got the better of him.
I:420;2227;M. Night Shyamalan, if nothing else, really does have great imagination when it comes to the premises of his films, including this one.
I:420;2228;Joaquin Phoenox is is this film as well.
I:420;2229;I thought he did a fine job in Signs.
I:420;2230;The production values were nice I have to say.
I:420;2231;It is a good looking film with some creepy imagery at times.
I:420;2232;The design of the creatures were cool as well.
I:420;2233;It looks good and has an interesting premise.
I:420;2234;Sorry, M. Knight, you have set a very high standard for yourself and this doesn't meet expectations.
I:420;2235;I have seen and loved his previous three films, and will pretty much see everything Shyamalan will ever do.
I:420;2236;'It's superbly told and shot, with great performances all around, including the justly lauded Howard.
I:420;2237;"After all, he ""got"" me multiple times before, and I'm sure he will again."
I:420;2238;my wife, a more demanding critic, really enjoyed this film.
I:420;2239;"She knows ""the woods"", and thought this film got that ""spookiness"" of the unknown out there beyond the treeline down cold."
I:420;2240;She mentioned she was surprised at how much she liked this movie.
I:420;2241;At the very least, it is well worth spending an hour or two in the presence of such a great filmmaker as M. Night Shyamalan, even if it isn't his finest hour.
I:420;2242;I always defend this film.
I:420;2243;He foreshadowed it all throughout the film.
I:420;2244;i love this movie for the beautiful cinematography, oscar nominated score by James Newton Howard and the wonderful acting, even if you didn't like the script (which I did).
I:420;2245;i love this film for the love story part.
I:420;2246;Call me a sap, but the scene where they talk on the porch at night in the fog is fantastic.
I:420;2247;I think this is his best work.
I:420;2248;but I think Hard core fans of M. night Shyamalan like me will leave the theater very satisfied.
I:420;2249;I thought 'Sixth Sense' was quite haunting and well.
I:420;2250;'Signs' was far and away his best movie, a fantastic thriller that was both haunting and moving.
I:420;2251;Those themes, which are woven throughout all his films, are much stronger and more interesting than any zinger ending.
I:420;2252;it was fun to just give into the odd pacing and ambiance of 'The Village'.
I:420;2253;"Even though the ""secrets"" had me thinking ""oh brother"" when revealed, I thought the love story between Joaquin Phoenix (always a brilliant actor) and Bryce Dallas Howard (the best young actress in recent memory) was exquisite in it's portrayal."
I:420;2254;"Just giving in to the ""Twilight Zone"" twists and turns, to be rewarded with a sublime love story, was satisfying and refreshing."
I:420;2255;Shyamalan gives the film a metaphorical weight that goes deeper than goose bumps.
I:420;2256;It is a political allegory that we should all heed.
I:420;2257;I absolutely loved this movie.
I:420;2258;it was thought provoking,beautifully shot, great acting and the sweetest love story.
I:420;2259;howard's got a great future and so has Phoenix.
I:420;2260;Night is good at building up expectations and twisting them to his own purpose.
I:420;2261;The tension between innocence/purity and knowledge/corruption is captivating and embodied perfectly in Ivy Walker's character.
I:420;2262;"everything is going well in the ""19th centuryish"" town."
I:420;2263;They live on their side, and the villagers live their lives on the inside, grateful for what they have been given.Yet life is never that simple, for the creatures start crossing borders, and inner romantic struggles shake the village to its foundation.
I:420;2264;the acting was ok, and the story was decent.
I:420;2265;A well done Hitchcockian tale of twists and surprises.
I:420;2266;This will keep you biting your nails and guessing right up to the end.
I:420;2267;"Although the explanation at the end strains credulity somewhat, overall, the film weaves its tapestry of horror and suspense into a cloth, spotted with red, that wraps the viewer in the world and life of ""The Village"" until its conclusion."
I:420;2268;Good, solid acting by the cast keeps the storyline believable.
I:420;2269;A fun fright for family night.
I:420;2270;Then I could relax and wonder what the twist would be this time.
I:420;2271;casting here is just great.
I:420;2272;All the characters are human, well.
I:420;2273;written and fit perfectly into the world created.
I:420;2274;And, like everyone else, I found Bryce Dallas Howard's Ivy charming.
I:420;2275;once you see it and then watch again to pick up all the clues, that's pretty much it.
I:420;2276;"But the characters of ""The Village"" are so engaging that this was one we actaully bought."
I:420;2277;This is a far deeper and better.
I:420;2278;made movie than most people give it credit for.
I:420;2279;People seem to come to it after seeing The Sixth Sense, and expect that the driving force will be the plot and its surprise twists.
I:420;2280;There's a good deal of subtle detail, including some symbolism of M. Night's own making.
I:420;2281;the storytelling and cinematography are very good.
I:420;2282;"There is a tense nighttime visit by ""those we do not speak of"" that terrifies most of the village ."
I:420;2283;to the point that they shiver in their cellars, accompanied by a rich soundtrack.
I:420;2284;Their conversation, shot mostly in profile, is quietly eloquent.
I:420;2285;the acting is strong throughout, even in the smaller roles and bit parts, which is generally (but sadly not always) true of M. Night's films.
I:420;2286;it's still a story about real people, their motives, and their choices.
I:420;2287;If you take it on its own terms, as a movie with a few improbable elements but essentially about the human struggle with our nature, you may be very pleased.
I:420;2288;I realize this movie isn't everyone's cup of tea, but it's my favorite among all M. Night's work.
I:420;2289;But I thought it was intricate and well thought.
I:420;2290;out like a good mystery.
I:420;2291;So yea, take a look at it.
I:420;2292;This film is so well done.
I:420;2293;Give this one a try.
I:420;2294;This is one of those films that I actually like more now that I have had a day to think about it.
I:420;2295;This is M. Night's best cast yet and all the acting is first rate (especially Bryce Howard in her debut), the music is chilling and beautiful at times, and the direction is first rate.
I:420;2296;Go in with an open mind and enter The Village at least one time.
I:420;2297;It is a scary film because of how the people ACT!
I:420;2298;and its very hard to do, but she plls it off thats why its a good performance!
I:420;2299;When the 'twist' at the end comes it is surely one of the biggest anticlimaxes since Y2K.
I:420;2300;"M. Night Shyamaln has made some quite unusual movies in his time, and he continues in that tradition with ""The Village""."
I:420;2301;In this forest live some creatures who the villagers always refer to in indirect ways.
I:420;2302;i thoroughly enjoyed the story, and in some places it still made me jump in fright.
I:420;2303;In this discussion of deeper issues the movie does exceptionally well.
I:420;2304;It presents possibilities with skill and flair.
I:420;2305;finally, I found that this movie grew on me.
I:420;2306;As I thought about the questions and issues it raises, I found myself liking the movie more and more.
I:420;2307;You will probably like it a whole lot more.
I:420;2308;the best story line ever and the best twist.
I:420;2309;I thought this movie was one of the best movies I have seen this year.
I:420;2310;The movie is well written, directed and acted.
I:420;2311;I can't say the same for some of the other movies I have seen so far.
I:420;2312;Just enjoy the movie for what it is.
I:420;2313;A true movie of M. Night Shamlayn!
I:420;2314;It has many variety of emotions but that is what makes it special!
I:420;2315;Truly maybe the most wounderful movie of the summer!
I:420;2316;It is also more thrilling than horrific as in scary!
I:420;2317;If you really think this director is great see theses movies dir.
I:420;2318;Signs If you can catch the buried secret of M. Night Shamalyn oon SCFI watch it!
I:420;2319;Now go see it and have a frighfull time!
I:420;2320;I couldnt believe they called this the best thriller of the year?
I:420;2321;More like the best borer of the decade.
I:420;2322;oh wow what a great idea?
I:420;2323;Only old movies are the best ones.
I:420;2324;are some of the best movies of all times.
I:420;2325;"ZZZZZZZzzzzzzz, you see scarier stuff than that on ""America's Funniest Home Videos"" which is just about what this movie is."
I:420;2326;It is well crafted, well acted, and best of all scary!
I:420;2327;The movie has also a very shocking ending!
I:420;2328;The Village is a masterpiece it should be nominated for some kind of award it is outstanding!
I:420;2329;I love movies and even enjoy some that other do not.
I:420;2330;They got the best end of this deal.
I:420;2331;Forget that this movie has great production values and some very fine acting.
I:420;2332;If you are capable of that, you will probably enjoy it too.
I:420;2333;This movie is alot better than the reviews it has been getting.
I:420;2334;It has a terrific message about our government and human behavior.
I:420;2335;It also shows us what kind of a world we live in today, and that love is the main thing that drives us to do the things we do.
I:420;2336;the performances are fantastic, especially Bryce Dallas Howard who shines as Ivy (she has major star potential).
I:420;2337;"The score is incredible, probably Night's best score to date (either as good as or better than the ""Signs"" score)."
I:420;2338;The plot twists are not very predictable, but as i said earlier, they are very precise on communicating to us the film's true, fantastic, chilling message.
I:420;2339;And of course the direction and script are great as always (Night has done it again).
I:420;2340;"The only reason I gave it four stars is because it isn't my favorite M. Night Shyamalan movie, ""Signs"" is my favorite."
I:420;2341;i recommend this movie to anyone who appreciates fine filmmaking and who goes to watch the film with an open mind, and who is prepared to think, rather than be scared.
I:420;2342;this movie was probably his best plot.
I:420;2343;The Village develops its characters amazingly, creating ingrown stories and feelings towards each character and their own situaions.
I:420;2344;"I saw this movie last year
I:420;2345;visually pleasing with an eye for a good cast.
I:420;2346;Bryce Dallas Howard takes the cake as a stunning beauty / heroine that makes this flick worth watching twice (but not on the big screen).
I:420;2347;If you liked Signs, you will like The Village.
I:420;2348;Bryce Dallas Howard was utterly brilliant, and you should see the movie if only to see her performance.
I:420;2349;This movie was one of the best I have ever seen.
I:420;2350;A great cast, a beautiful and interesting storyline, and an amazing score by James Newton Howard (the best score i have ever heard).
I:420;2351;It has its scary moments but really it is more of a dramatic love story with a great storyline.
I:420;2352;It is all about the atmosphere and how M. Night Shyamalan put it all together.
I:420;2353;It is just simply beautiful!!
I:420;2354;The most amazing performance in the movie is that of Ivy Walker played by Bryce Dallas Howard.
I:420;2355;She is a the young blind heroine of this movie and is simply amazing for her first theatrical debut.
I:420;2356;She is the brightest spot in a movie with so many bright areas.
I:420;2357;But when you watch this movie just take in the beauty and elegance it creates both through sound and vision.
I:420;2358;The best of M. Night Shyamalan's films and one of the best movies I have ever seen!
I:420;2359;Thank goodness I used a 99.
I:420;2360;if anything salvages this drama whatsoever it is the wonderful performance of Bryce Dallas Howard .
I:420;2361;M Night Shymalan has managed yet again to create an atmospheric movie with brilliant cinematography.
I:420;2362;I enjoyed this film immensely.
I:420;2363;the storyline is clever as you would expect from a M. Night Shyalmalan film.
I:420;2364;Firstly, I think Ivy is a wonderful character and the acting here is superb.
I:420;2365;There was some strong minded strong characters, i. e. Lucies and Ivy who are prepared to blindly follow the course of the elders in the village.
I:420;2366;It is almost like he is inviting them to tell him.
I:420;2367;the whole concept of the film is a very interesting one, which shows how people might live in order to avoid the evil person in the world.
I:420;2368;all in all, I recommend you watch this film.
I:420;2369;It has something for everyone.
I:420;2370;They were all victims of violence so moved her to escape the world.
I:420;2371;While the blind girl is in the woods, the crazy guy steals the costume and goes after her.
I:420;2372;WOW what a smart move.
I:420;2373;First he had us seeing people who were dead, now he's making us afraid of the colour red.
I:420;2374;now that we know that the plot twists will be there, we examine his movies with great care.Yet no matter how hard we try to figure out the plot, M. Night Shyamalan always makes us look like a sorry lot.
I:420;2375;as for the plot it is meaningful and deep, even though it may cause you to miss a night's sleep.
I:420;2376;as the film porgresses we get more pieces of the picture, and at the end we understand the whole fixture.
I:420;2377;For all those daunted by the reveiws out there that degrade this movie, please read this.
I:420;2378;I am what may be considered a fan of M. Night Shyamalan .
I:420;2379;I have seen all three of his previous movies and enjoyed them very much.
I:420;2380;i found this movie to be thrilling, well paced, and enjoyable.
I:420;2381;i was willing to look beyond all the bad reviews, and have found a very good movie.
I:420;2382;As for its being enjoyable, you will have to watch it and determine an opinion for yourself.
I:420;2383;i would now like to take this space to contrast this movie with the wonderfully culty (and subtly Catholic) Signs.
I:420;2384;This is a very important and moving theme for todays world, and the resolution was very clear and enlightening.
I:420;2385;Yes they should have sheltered them from 'the world', but not in a falsehood: in the time tested world of a whole family.
I:420;2386;so the moral of the story, kiddies: Shyamalan should get a strong Catholic like Gibson to help him with any and all of his movies.
I:420;2387;after this time the most beautiful,the most sensitive character ivy takes on the role.
I:420;2388;she saves herself by cleverness and ultimately gets the medicines.
I:420;2389;such a sweet,sensitive character she portrayed the role quintessentially.
I:420;2390;But I guess the real shocker was the early century village was actually taking place in today's world.
I:420;2391;This is an incredible movie if you are intelligent enough to understand the ethical issues it raises.
I:420;2392;story of a commune who are afraid to go into the woods because creatures are skinning all of their animals.
I:420;2393;The Village is one of M. Night Shyamalan's best works.
I:420;2394;It's a brilliant drama that embraces fantasy, romance and horror.
I:420;2395;It is one of the best I've seen!
I:420;2396;But we should all have learned by now that the previews are rarely accurate, right?I still think that this was an entertaining story and I thought about it after I left the theatre.
I:420;2397;And the performances were well done.
I:420;2398;It's worth a matinee ticket.
I:420;2399;He tells a masterful tale set back in the 1800s of a village who lives peacefully except for a fear of the creatures who live within the surrounding woods.
I:420;2400;i actually think this is a much better movie than 6th Sense.
I:420;2401;And, unlike movies like the Blair Witch project, you DO actually get to see the creatures.
I:420;2402;Elaborate, it has one of the best plot twists that I've seen in a film since Hitchcock's Psycho.
I:420;2403;Also, the film is beautiful (See: the slow motion scene (those who have watched the movie will know what I'm talking about)).
I:420;2404;In addition to the cinematography, the acting is top.
I:420;2405;out performance, Joaquin Phoenix in his best film since.
I:420;2406;well, since Signs, and Adrien Brody in his most meaningful film since The Pianist.
I:420;2407;In conclusion, the film's score is so incredibly haunitng (with violin and what.
I:420;2408;I ordered this movie on a Wednesday and it was at my house by Friday.
I:420;2409;I got exactly what I ordered.
I:420;2410;It is a straightforward thriller.
I:420;2411;M. Night Shyamalan's twist endings are growing old and he should quit putting them on his films.
I:420;2412;His others, including this one, don't.
I:420;2413;The twist ending is what makes the movie great.
I:420;2414;It is set in the present day.
I:420;2415;I'm on the edge of my seat with curiosity about this twist ending, and about whether it even exists or not .
I:420;2416;"I understand people who approached ""The Village"" with dispositions based on the previews, but the story was incredible."
I:420;2417;How M. Night is still capable of creating these stories is beyond me.
I:420;2418;James Newton Howard's music and Hillary Hahn's innocent and haunting violin were astounding.
I:420;2419;If you didn't like the movie, you must have at least enjoyed the score.
I:420;2420;Signs was one of my favorite films of 2002.
I:420;2421;"Likewise, ""The Sixth Sense"" was also excellent."
I:420;2422;I will say that the acting was good.
I:420;2423;The village is M. Night Shyamalan's 4th film.
I:420;2424;"The film wasn't as intense as ""Signs"" and ""the six sense"" (unbreakable wasn't really intense) but this film had more dept and great cinematography, which made the film great."
I:420;2425;The acting is perfect for the mood and atmosphere, the cinematography of the village and the woods is amazing for the environment and the message is completely relevant.
I:420;2426;It is a brilliant movie with cameos that will definitely make you jump!
I:420;2427;The ending kind of leads to a sequel, but the success of the film will determine that, and if Shyamalan wants to make it.
I:420;2428;this film I definitely recommend to anyone who loves great movies.
I:420;2429;This is one of those films you really have to pay close attention too, or else soon after the film you won't know what is going on.
I:420;2430;That is another reason why this film is so great and brilliant.
I:420;2431;There are a lot of surprises in this film, but the biggest one yet is how much you'll love this film.
I:420;2432;Ignorance breeds fear, knowledge gives power.
I:420;2433;This is her first major film role and I'm glad that M Night Shyamalan takes risks like that, allowing unknown actors to carry a film, and Howard does it brilliantly.
I:420;2434;"The other performance I enjoyed is Joaquin Phoenix, who has a larger role in this one than he did in ""Signs""."
I:420;2435;He plays a sharp and curious young man who makes repeated requests to leave the village to find out what's out there.
I:420;2436;See this film, see it for the allegory it is and don't try to guess the ending if you haven't seen it yet.
I:420;2437;I hope for Shyamalan's sake that he surprises us all with his next film, by making it a straight.
I:420;2438;forward film without twists and surprises.
I:420;2439;"It's hard to top the genius of ""The Sixth Sense"", but this one comes close."
I:420;2440;moving (but appropriately) scenes and the paranoia of what's in the woods that stays inside all the villagers.
I:420;2441;a lot of the movie actually ends up focusing on the relationship between Phoenix and Ivy, but that's necessary because it shows you the love they have for each other and eventually makes it more believable that Ivy would go to great lengths such as this to heal Phoenix.
I:420;2442;Even though it wasn't very scary after you realize what's really going on, it's still just as entertaining and still want to see what happens.
I:420;2443;excellent acting by the lead woman actor who plays Ivy.
I:420;2444;Now, that's my definition of a terrific story.
I:420;2445;The Village is beautifully filmed and acted, with attention to detail that has me picking up things I didn't notice before every time I watch it.
I:420;2446;have the elders done a good and loving thing for their children, in protecting them from the world outside?
I:420;2447;Sure enough it paid off with a great twist almost as good as the sixth sense.
I:420;2448;Night has yet to top this flick.
I:420;2449;He speaks to the notions of the human condition and fidelity and wraps the entire thing in some sort of allegorical reference to Dubya and Nine Eleven.
I:420;2450;The story, the acting, the script, and the cinematography were all there.
I:420;2451;What this is is an excellent film that struggles with an important question: How much liberty should be traded for security?
I:420;2452;his film is perfect for our times.
I:420;2453;If you want great filmmaking that makes you think, I highly recommed this film.
I:420;2454;What a fun ride and great acting!
I:420;2455;The Village is, if nothing else, M. Night's most visually stunning production to date.
I:420;2456;The story is engaging, the cinematography top notch, the acting very well done, it has the best score of any movie released this year, and it has what is.
I:420;2457;the best scene of the year.
I:420;2458;hand with the visuals, with the natural sounds of branches clacking in the breeze, to cast an eerie pall over the whole movie.
I:420;2459;this one is first rate.
I:420;2460;let's talk acting:This cast, from top to bottom does an excellent job.
I:420;2461;hands in another great performance.
I:420;2462;Sigourney Weaver and William Hurt are both great in their understated ways.
I:420;2463;There are so many scenes that almost make this movie great.
I:420;2464;Joaquin Phoenix gets to speak words that will ring true to any man whose ever been in love.
I:420;2465;the Village is a strong movie.
I:420;2466;In a year that had very few great movies, I give this one a strong recommendation
I:420;2467;contained community maintained by fear of the outside and its leaders are manipulators in keeping power.
I:420;2468;While M. Night's has maybe backed himself into a corner with the audience expecting to be shocked at some point, this is nevertheless ranks right up there with The Sixth Sense for me.
I:420;2469;The crux of this movie is the love story between the two characters, played by Joaquin Phoenix and Bryce Dallas Howard.
I:420;2470;That is the real story .
I:420;2471;one of the most unaffected actresses of her generation to grace the screen.
I:420;2472;Watch it for the love story.
I:420;2473;This film is beautifully directed and the cinematography and editing and all that jazz are perfect.
I:420;2474;There's more involved and dang did I mention it's directed quite well?
I:420;2475;Night also picks out unusual names for his characters, keeps everything interesting.
I:420;2476;Good film, so it's not the most perfect, but its a darn good view, that's art baby!
I:420;2477;First of all, the suspense is fantastic.
I:420;2478;The love story element is sweet.
I:420;2479;Ivy's spunky attitude and Lucius' quiet nature fit well together, culminating in a touching dialogue on Ivy's porch and a strong romantic connection throughout the film.
I:420;2480;It's a film that makes you think, gasp, and enjoy it for all its ingenuity.
I:420;2481;Phoenix delivers the perfect blend of the shy but stubborn nature of Lucius, while Bryce Dallas Howard entertains as a delightfully spunky but determined Ivy.
I:420;2482;Adrien Brody's Noah is also compelling: his mental state and actions are alarming and one must wonder if he had any real conscience or control through it all.
I:420;2483;Even the movie's score is riveting, from the haunting lilts to its more intense melodies.
I:420;2484;But if you choose to watch it, it's best if all the lights are out.
I:420;2485;M. Nights other films were much more entertaining and seem to stick with you.
I:420;2486;This is a film about how far people who have been deeply wounded will go to keep from being hurt again and about what we will risk for someone we love.
I:420;2487;The cinematography is gorgeous, the characters, I thought, were three.
I:420;2488;dimensional and felt very real to me and I found myself caring about them.
I:420;2489;I appreciated the care the writers took with the characters' idiom and norms of social behavior, keeping them free of 20th or 21st century anachronisms .
I:420;2490;I thought the acting and language was so real and authentic.
I:420;2491;I thought the whole idea of creating another world within the modern world was very interesting and well.
I:420;2492;I think that this is absolutely one of the best films I have ever seen by M. Night Shyamalan.
I:420;2493;The story ran smoothly along and the twist ending tied together everything that had happened.
I:420;2494;I absolutely LOVE this movie.
I:420;2495;I think that if you are looking for a good Horror genre movie, with twists and a good story, this is the movie for you.
I:420;2496;Will they ever die and go away?
I:420;2497;Of course, there are a few things done well.
I:420;2498;I thought the story was very well done and I completely disagree with Roger Ebert who said it was one of the worst movies of the year.
I:420;2499;What Shyamalan seems to be aiming at with all of his movies (The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs, and The Village) is the creation of an entirely new genre.
I:420;2500;Instead of making audiences jump at time.
I:420;2501;worn screamer moments, he draws the audience in and once he gets them on the edge of their seats he hits them with the unexpected: substance.
I:420;2502;the VILLAGE and the people who live in it.
I:420;2503;provoking movie set in a captivating world, then you've hit your mark and need not go any further.
I:420;2504;I was familiar with few of the actors but they all did a fine job and the casting was absolutely perfect.
I:420;2505;You won't sleep through this one!The film yields a unique, fantastical story and I found it to be infinitely refreshing to say the least.
I:420;2506;both the script and superb cinematography of this film are just superb.
I:420;2507;The color saturation is tremendous and the sets and locations are near perfection.
I:420;2508;there's so much more to it.
I:420;2509;i cannot possibly supply enough good comments about this fine film.
I:420;2510;I felt it was well done and it reminded me of something Alfred Hitchcock may have done if he were still around.
I:420;2511;I think it is his best film yet, with all his other work being good too.
I:420;2512;As for the performances, i thought they were great, especally Bryce Dallas Howard, she was incredible, everyone was great though.
I:420;2513;Overall i would highly recommend this movie to anyone that is a fan of his previous work, just dont go into the movie waiting for the twist, go ther to watch it for what it is.
I:420;2514;This was no fault of the excellent casts and the artistic cinematography.
I:420;2515;The projection of an almost Amish like isolated Victorian era village community was very well .
I:420;2516;It is probably one of the most challenging film script genres to write.
I:420;2517;This is not a movie that most people might enjoy, even if it were improved by such suitable amendments and additions that might occur at some time in the future, but for a minority it is an extremely well done if not a perfectly finished work of art.
I:420;2518;Thus I give it three stars.
I:420;2519;It's languidly paced, and very human.
I:420;2520;It does have a twist, of course.
I:420;2521;I'm enamored with the decent and meaningful way in which the lead characters interact.
I:420;2522;It's just a good movie.
I:420;2523;I really enjoyed this movie!!
I:420;2524;I thought it was well acted and well done overall.
I:420;2525;It kept me on the edge of my seat and the twist was great!
I:420;2526;"A Surprisingly, Brilliant, movie!With this well acted, well thought out plot and beautifully scored music in this movie, I was left with a feeling of, ""What If""?"
I:420;2527;"I highly recommend this movie to those who like and dislike, ""Thriller"" movies."
I:420;2528;There is the most amazing surprise that will trully knock your socks off.
I:420;2529;I have loved lots of movies that other people have found long and slow.
I:420;2530;Im a photography student in Santa Barbara, and I love screen plays and writting with a passion.
I:420;2531;This may not be Alien, but It is gorgeous, and beautiful.
I:420;2532;This has been the most colorful, positive, touching film iv seen to date, since I saw Gattaca.
I:420;2533;I will see every one of this Mans movies, because this movie is more than a movie, it is an art piece in itself.
I:420;2534;It is beautiful in its cinematography, its dialogue, and its idea of a positive world.
I:420;2535;I have a favorite director, by far.
I:420;2536;Granted, it has a few suspenseful moments, and you might even fight yourself on the edge of your seat once or twice.
I:420;2537;The core of this movie, however, is the incredibly powerful story of love that actually dominates most of the movie.
I:420;2538;His relationship with the beautiful, blind Ivy Walker, and the great trial that faces both of them makes for an incredibly emotional and impacting story of love that surpasses all fear.
I:420;2539;It's simply beautiful to watch.
I:420;2540;notch as well, specifically Bryce Dallas Howard, who gives such a convincing performance as a blind woman, that I would have thought she actually was.
I:420;2541;A very minimal musical score rounds out the package, which is perhaps the best thing Night could have done.
I:420;2542;A great deal of the The Village is totally without music, and the movie benefits from this greatly.
I:420;2543;I highly recommend this film.
I:420;2544;"The spooky trailer that I had viewed prior to the film's release, painted a picture of an eerie story mixing elements of ""The Blair Witch Project"" and ""The Howling"" about a mid."
I:420;2545;Suitable viewing for curiosity's sake only.
I:420;2546;This movie is fairly good for what it is.
I:420;2547;And there are good things.
I:420;2548;I give this movie a thumbs up.
I:420;2549;The romance and scaryelements are the icing on the cake.
I:420;2550;This is one of those rare movies that is well written, acted, and beautifully portrayed.
I:420;2551;It holds your interest throughout.
I:420;2552;The music ties it all together perfectly.
I:420;2553;I thought it was rather creepy at times, and the director absolutely has the talent and gifth to capture the attention of the viewer, I did not want this movie to end though I was really curious to understand what was going on inside the woods around the village.
I:420;2554;i love the idea behind The village.
I:420;2555;So what, with a few flaws this movie is done extrememly well.
I:420;2556;The monsters are scary, the atmosphere of the movie is as mysterious as I hoped for, and I can't understand why so many people didn't like it.
I:420;2557;This is the work of a genius.
I:420;2558;The village is another nail biter from M. Night Shyamalan (who is trying so hard to be the next Alfred Hitchcock or Ed Wood but I am not sure which) that keeps you on the edge of your seat and the lets you down by the end.
I:420;2559;He grabbed our attention with the Sixth Sense but has been going down hill since.
I:420;2560;There is great acting from everyone, especially Howard, except Adrien Brody.
I:420;2561;I loved the use of the color red, even though Shyamalan rode the same pony in the Sixth Sense, but just wished he could have came up with a better ending.
I:420;2562;"Shyamalan's previous ""Signs"" surely raised goose bumps, but also interwove remarkable spiritual insights into a gripping, understated, plot."
I:420;2563;The Village continues the minimalist exploration, but throws the pantry doors wide open with a thematically dense script and dazzling array of performances.
I:420;2564;"The monsters of this film are not ""those of whom we do not speak"" who live in the woods, but the very real monsters lurking deep within our hearts and at large in human society."
I:420;2565;the shear humanity of Shyamalan's achievement cannot be ignored.
I:420;2566;William Hurt comes out of hibernation and gives his best performance in a decade.
I:420;2567;"The resolute courage and love shown by Joachin Phoenix in ""Signs"" is again reprised here."
I:420;2568;most of all, Bryce Howard steals the show with an amazing display of childlike vulnerability and inspiring determination.
I:420;2569;makes us love this innocent blind beauty all the more.
I:420;2570;Such minor efforts will be richly rewarded by the time the credits roll.
I:420;2571;well i'm mentioning this because my ten year old sister read it in school and told me her teacher said the village was based on it.
I:420;2572;You see, at the time i thought it would be an amazing thrill like signs and sixth sense.
I:420;2573;I only hope he will redeem himself, because i liked signs, it had some humor.
I:420;2574;M. Night Shyamalan fooled me completely with his other, more masterful films, such as the Sixth Sense.
I:420;2575;Critics had panned THE VILLAGE but considering his track record, I decided to give this work a chance.
I:420;2576;Somehow, the Village elder played by William Hurt is engaging.
I:420;2577;i'm a big fan of M. Night's work.
I:420;2578;packed, still keep you glued to your seat, and hold your interest.
I:420;2579;His stories slowly unfold, telling wonderful stories.
I:420;2580;But if you're going to watch this movie (which I highly recommend) then watch it for the right reasons: It's story is, in a word, superb.
I:420;2581;And, not to mention, the music is beautiful.
I:420;2582;Despite M. Night using his signature style, rest assured that this new peice of work is very original.
I:420;2583;It dropped my mouth wide open.
I:420;2584;instead, I found one of the most captivating lovestories I've ever viewed.
I:420;2585;BryceDallas Howard as Ivy is one of the most convincingperformances on record.
I:420;2586;The twists are intertwined at moments when youthink you just figured out the stunning ending.
I:420;2587;Lucius is utterly fearless, and wishes to enter the woods despite the ban.
I:420;2588;Ivy, though blind, is resourceful and capable.
I:420;2589;By the time one of the villagers is forced to journey into the woods, we are completely absorbed.
I:420;2590;this is one of Shyamalan's best movies, surpassed only by Unbreakable.
I:420;2591;I just finished seeing M. night Shyamalan's `the Village' and I was pleased with the movie!
I:420;2592;"True, it is nothing like his previous works such as ""Signs"" and the ""Sixth Sense"", but nevertheless it is very entertaining."
I:420;2593;What follows is a series of happenings that makes `The Village' so entertaining to watch.
I:420;2594;bryce Dallas Howard, who played the role of Ivy, did a tremendous job for her role and should definitely be nominated for an award.
I:420;2595;She conveys her feeling beautifully in each scene and shines throughout the movie.
I:420;2596;this movie is not that scary, but it does have a lot of twists to it, which you don't expect coming.
I:420;2597;The soundtrack is also great which keeps the tempo of the movie well placed.
I:420;2598;On the whole, it is a movie worth watching!
I:420;2599;a. minute horror flick, you will be disappointed: otherwise, you will love it!
I:420;2600;for those of you worried about content: there are some intense moments, lots of suspense, but surprisingly little objectionable content.
I:420;2601;The scary and adult themes of this film make it unfit for young children, but the content is actually quite clean.
I:420;2602;acted, with stellar performances by Adrien Brody, Joaquin Phoenix, and newcomer Bryce Dallas Howard.
I:420;2603;moving yet intense suspense flick!
I:420;2604;Especially in that it could happen in real life (truth is absolutely scarier than fiction, we often just don't want to think about it).
I:420;2605;While the village lives in the 1800's, the real world is actually going on outside of this protected area, living in the present time.
I:420;2606;ridden real life and live their lives in isolation, pretending it really is 1890.
I:420;2607;, oh yeah, that's got me on the edge of my seat.
I:420;2608;the best part of this movie was when you actually thought there were monsters coming after them, that took up 5 minutes tops in this movie.
I:420;2609;It had a few 'thrilling' moments but I found it to be a lot more than that.
I:420;2610;A person will do anything for love and that's what the whole movie is based around.
I:420;2611;It pulls you in like that and makes you look deeper into it.
I:420;2612;It makes you think and it makes you feel.
I:420;2613;This is one of the best movies I've seen in an incredibly long time and an hour after watching it, I'm still sitting here thinking about it.
I:420;2614;The ending is amazing and I can only wish, what this movie exposed, could be possable.
I:420;2615;Deep inside we all dream of what this writer imagined and put on film.
I:420;2616;It has a classic M. Night plot twist (actually two).
I:420;2617;I saw it with my 15 year old son and the ended provoked a lengthy discussion about this second plot twist.
I:420;2618;Great movie, but ending will make you throw the movie away.
I:420;2619;The Village is a good drama production.
I:420;2620;It is a great movie and awesome message!Very conservative viewers ought to preview before watching with young children.
I:420;2621;The movie wasn't that scary I'll admit, but the love story side.
I:420;2622;"It was creepy at parts, but I found the scene where you first get a chance to see ""those we don't speak of"" anti."
I:420;2623;motion with the music) was just beautiful.
I:420;2624;rounded movie with a little bit of everything.
I:420;2625;and the whole premise of the movie was clever.
I:420;2626;The soundtrack is amazing as well.
I:420;2627;I recommend this movie for those looking for an alternative to slasher films.
I:420;2628;Well, I was kind of liking the movie up until the end, when you find out that the whole thing was just a scam.
I:420;2629;I'm a big M. Night Shyamalan fan.
I:420;2630;Clearly, the man has oodles of talent, and possesses the happy knack of being able to exact wonderfully original performances from the big stars that want to do his movies.
I:420;2631;On paper, then, The Village, should have been an excellent film, with its compelling pseudo.
I:420;2632;it is said that somewhere between truth and untruth lies fiction.
I:420;2633;I have never seen such a promising movie deliver so very little .
I:420;2634;real visuals and frankly standard.
I:420;2635;as Ivy, and saves this movie from a one.
I:420;2636;means that, far from being the suspenseful and beautifully.
I:420;2637;"Ron Howard's daughter, Bryce Dallas Howard, is definitely a force to be reckoned with
I:420;2638;This was a good performance.
I:420;2639;"Adrian Brody was fine
I:420;2640;i've loved Sigourney Weaver in almost everything she's done, and she didn't let me down.
I:420;2641;He asks us to employ our minds and imaginations when we would prefer to be spoon fed vulgarity and unoriginality.
I:420;2642;as proven in the past, M. Night is able to do more with sound, lighting, mood, and acting, than most Hollywood hacks are able to do with $200 million budgets.
I:420;2643;Rather, it probes subjects such as innocence, love, our deep.
I:420;2644;This film is wonderfully acted, beautifully shot, for the most part plenty suspenseful, but the ending is such a let down.
I:420;2645;The film works a little better on TV.
I:420;2646;OK, M. Night, we know you are the master at that stuff, but lets learn a new trick shall we?
I:420;2647;Now I'm ready to let you know that I love this movie.
I:420;2648;I think it's the kind of film that demands more then one viewing but after you know what it's all about and all the hype has disappeared, you can sit back and enjoy the characters, the performances and the interaction.
I:420;2649;"Especially in the case of a ""period"" piece like he has here."
I:420;2650;see it again (three times if you must).
I:420;2651;when you're not waiting to see what will happen next, you can sit back and enjoy the show.
I:420;2652;The writer is great and the director also.
I:420;2653;If you like Night's stuff, you'll LOVE this one.
I:420;2654;if you like a mystery that gradually unravels, that takes THOUGHT (shudder), that has a GREAT twist at the end, and that leaves an impression on you, this is your movie.
I:420;2655;i don't usually write reviews, but I had to put in my mention for Night's brilliant piece, here.
I:420;2656;"I'd managed to avoid hearing what the twist was until actually viewing it
I:420;2657;And while I did more or less figure out what was going on, I was still glued to my seat and scared silly.
I:420;2658;M. Night knows how to build tension and keep it going for sustained periods.
I:420;2659;IMHO, The Village is a *lot* better than critics gave it credit for, and definitely worth watching.
I:420;2660;eerie music in the background is the best attempt by the movie to leave the audience with any after effects.
I:420;2661;i was hoping to see a M. Night Shyamalan movie that will impress me as the 6th sense once did.
I:420;2662;Bruce Willis in 6th sense/Unbreakable, Mel Gibson in Signs) right away and gets absorbed into the plot.
I:420;2663;The only thing that can possibly salvage this movie is Bryce Dallas Howard's convincing performance as Ivy Walker, a blind young woman that was somehow able to 'see' colours in people.
I:420;2664;the scenes inside the forest reminded me of the Blair Witch Project .
I:420;2665;huh to go along with the rest of the movie.
I:420;2666;The tease of the twist is more effective but, even more important, the movie has more heart than the previous two.
I:420;2667;The love triangle, of sorts, is handled beautifully and that allows the creeping and chilling thrills to be felt all the more strongly and emotionally.
I:420;2668;The direction is perfect as always.
I:420;2669;Every gesture, movement and, even, colour is done to drawn the viewer into the moment the director is creating.
I:420;2670;Shymalan knows how to use the medium of film far better than most working directors in a very Spielbergian way.
I:420;2671;It will be interesting to see this director tackle someone else's story.
I:420;2672;It can only serve to help him grow and that will be a good thing for all movie goers.
I:420;2673;It is a sanctuary of innocence, kept away from the sinful settlers of the outside world.
I:420;2674;They have numerous safeguards against these beings.
I:420;2675;this is, in my opinion, one of the great films of our time.
I:420;2676;The Village is of high.
I:420;2677;It is a unique, touching film of love and bravery, and the battle to keep a people innocent.
I:420;2678;go out and see the movie and form your own intelligent opinion on your own.
I:420;2679;The Village is a great example of what happens when a hot young director, in this case Mr. M. Night Shymalan, is give free rein and lots of money to create his masterpiece.
I:420;2680;The love story is down right silly.
I:420;2681;"perhaps my knowledge of these two facts was what let me enjoy the movie on a level that other people haven't
I:420;2682;"With gorgeous visuals, fantastic use of colour and a haunting violinist score, ""The Village"" is certainly a feast for the senses, whatever you might think of the actual story."
I:420;2683;the second generation is represented mainly through Edward's two daughters, the giddy Kitty, and the blind, spiritual Ivy, and Alice's son Lucius .
I:420;2684;"Therefore, whilst the other boys are playing ""chicken"" games at the edge of the woods, Lucius is exploring his own theory concerning the creatures: he is greatly affected by the death August's son, and believes that if the traveller had noble intentions (such as fetching medicines from the towns), the creatures would let him pass unharmed."
I:420;2685;skinned animals and red marks appear on the doors.
I:420;2686;"Is retaining innocence worth the terror that goes with it?As well as this, there are a lot of things to enjoy
I:420;2687;Most touching for me however, was the love story between Ivy and Lucius .
I:420;2688;Shymalan builds an interesting and endearing character, and then he abruptly drops from the action, never to return.
I:420;2689;For that matter, we never actually learn if Ivy was actually *successful* in her mission .
I:420;2690;"does he survive or not?All in all, I enjoyed ""The Village"", and I really hope you take the time to look deeper into what it's trying to say."
I:420;2691;Some great performances from the actors involved, and meticulous direction and control from Shymalan .
I:420;2692;i wholeheartedly recommend it to everyone=you must see it, feel it, experience it for yourself.
I:420;2693;time viewers should listen very carefully, not to what is being said but to HOW it is being said.)
I:420;2694;some of the romantic entanglements and subsequent jealousies are interesting, particularly one that leads to an attempted murder.
I:420;2695;nevertheless, I liked the movie for what it was .
I:420;2696;piece drama with a symbolic message of sorts.
I:420;2697;style community living, isolated in a village.
I:420;2698;**What I liked most was that this story was a superb portrayal of how those in power use fear to control the masses.
I:420;2699;All so that the outside world wouldn't taint their idyllic lifestyle.
I:420;2700;The leaders began with good intentions, but ultimately the entire life of the town was built on a lie.
I:420;2701;thus becoming the perfect scapegoat to bear his society's collective projection.
I:420;2702;But strangely, at the end of the movie it appears that they are simply going to move forward, propping up their delusion and keeping the people in darkness.
I:420;2703;the best thing about this movie is the casting.
I:420;2704;Kind of like taking a cast featuring a bunch of veteran actors and then putting Mark Hammill in the lead role.
I:420;2705;Howard may edge a bit into melodrama a time or two, but for the most part she very much holds her own against the giants around her.
I:420;2706;One of the best openers in movies in recent years, in fact.
I:420;2707;Gleeson's performance is so perfect, so understated, that what follows is either the best movie ever or an anticlimax.
I:420;2708;it's a good idea for a story, and the Twilight Zone comparisons are accurate (The Village, like every episode of the original Twilight Zone, deals with the causes and effects of human isolation).
I:420;2709;"Shyamalan also knows when to twist things, and twist them he does
I:420;2710;Okay, good photography and ONE good performance (Howard) should not be enough for anybody.
I:420;2711;It was like blowing a balloon of suspense up for almost two hours to find it bursts at the last moment.
I:420;2712;M. Night Shyamalan's got a knack for strange circumstances, haunting filming, and twist of plot and in The Village he uses these teqniques to rescue a relatively simple story from mediocrity.
I:420;2713;The Village is a very fun movie to watch and the twists of plot, though given away early and pretty easy to figure out make the movie interesting throughout.
I:420;2714;while this movie is a great watch it would have been better if the characters were built up a little more.
I:420;2715;if you like M. Night Shyamalan you will like this movie and if you are a fan of suspense this movie will certainly please.
I:420;2716;For the rest of us this movie does provide entertainment value and is shot beautifully.
I:420;2717;Shyamalan has a great knack for giving his films a feel and he does this well.
I:420;2718;"Combine this with the fact that The Sixth Sense was just a brilliant idea and the others were somewhat lamer and less dramatic, and you have your answer to the question of how the mind that gave us The Sixth Sense also gave us ""Swing away!"
I:420;2719;"Once again, after an impressive ad campaign based mostly on the belying ""from the writer/director of the 6th Sense!"""
I:420;2720;it has an interesting enough premise.

I:420;2723;I felt this to be true in Signs and it's even truer in The Village.
I:420;2724;"monologue on love, and after Lucius' ""."
I:420;2725;"i will dance with you,"" trembling declaration."
I:420;2726;This story takes place in a simple town, with very complex characters.
I:420;2727;the acting is so good that the siuation of the characters is entirely believable and at times deeply moving: there is the search for love and unfulfilled need, the desire to preserve an utterly unique culture, and the yearning of the young, who find incredible inner resources for the trial that awaits.
I:420;2728;The mood is consistant, mixing color, sound, and stunning visual imagery.
I:420;2729;Each scene is as complex as a portrait painting, with the expressions implying an entire world with quirky points of view.
I:420;2730;the story unfolds as a kind of mythical journey that could go in any number of directions.
I:420;2731;This film is a great and subtle gem.
I:420;2732;"The previews for this film heralded it as being ""another thriller from the creative mind who brought you The Sixth Sense and Signs."""
I:420;2733;When I see a movie, I realize that this is a story from a director's point of view.
I:420;2734;When he gave it back he was so proud he figured it out before the end.
I:420;2735;Watch the movie and enjoy it.
I:420;2736;At the end I was caught between the noble idea of it's creation and the cowardice of the founders.
I:420;2737;The Village by M. Night Shyamalan was an excellent movie.
I:420;2738;It is almost more of a love story then anything but it still has some thrilling moments.
I:420;2739;It was very good and had a great cast with a very good plot.
I:420;2740;When the commericals showed for this movie, I naturally assumed this film was about true creatures in the forest.
I:420;2741;Once again I'm fooled into believing that a film is a good film because of a few fast scenes they show on commericals.
I:420;2742;The Village I thought would be eeriee, at least exciting somewhat.
I:420;2743;"fashioned ""Twilight Zone"" episode all done up in period costume and expanded out to feature film length."
I:420;2744;down look and feel of a morality play performed on a stage whose sets are simple and stark and whose characters and dialogue are weighted down with heavy symbolic value.
I:420;2745;octane chills and thrills .
I:420;2746;In this respect, the movie works quite well.
I:420;2747;filled mission to bring help back from town, who shines in the film.
I:420;2748;The idea is quite interesting, but it's the way the story is presented that bothers me.
I:420;2749;A party is organized to go into the forbidden woods and to the world beyond.
I:420;2750;this makes perfect sense: send someone who can't see through a forest full of unspeakably horrible unspoken.
I:420;2751;It's a twist that likely to bring more groans than gasps.
I:420;2752;The acting is believable though a bit wooden.
I:420;2753;This movie is beautiful, scary because of it's very possible outcome, and wonderful.
I:420;2754;Brcye Dallas Howard steals the movie, she is so fantastic.
I:420;2755;This is a true classic.
I:420;2756;It is a movie that can easily be viewed more than once to capture what was missed the first time around.
I:420;2757;Your time is worth more and you deserve better.
I:420;2758;I was so intrigue by this movie that I went to see it as soon as it came out.
I:420;2759;It is an amazing movie with an amazing cast.
I:420;2760;The Village is a great suspenseful, clean, thought provoking movie.
I:420;2761;Sound effects, music, and images are used very skillfully to engage those watching.
I:420;2762;This is one of my favorites and I hope more people watch this great work of art.
I:420;2763;The revelation here is Bryce Howard, who is lovely and excellent in a difficult (to put it mildly) role.
I:420;2764;The cinematography looks beautiful and the sounds provide some fun diversion, but long before this movie is over, you will be smirking in your seat.
I:420;2765;I've enjoyed all of his films, however, to varying degrees.
I:420;2766;Unbreakable I found simply to be a fun movie exploring in a very real everyday way how a grown family man comes to the realization and terms with the fact that he is a superhero.
I:420;2767;The Village certainly has a twist at the ending, however, it was one that I suspected about 25 minutes into the film.
I:420;2768;The movie has great performances from some great performers and manages to provide a few chills, (without the necessity of the blood and gore that makes it into far too many of our films).
I:420;2769;My advice: Go see the film solely for the purpose of being entertained and watching some excellent performances and maybe, just maybe, being surprised and given a few goose bumps here and there.
I:420;2770;Not all directors put out great films.
I:420;2771;On the small end of things, it's worth the praise for cinematography.
I:420;2772;It's also worth the interesting method used by the director to unveil meaning behind the film which is the danger of innocence lost and what it really means to be innocent in the face of tragedy and loss.
I:420;2773;It's also worth stunning performances given by the entire cast of actors.
I:420;2774;This film is head and shoulders above many films I have seen, and I put it in my top five.
I:420;2775;I hope people will give this film a chance and watch it with an earnest heart.
I:420;2776;And more than that, it is capable of provoking a lot of serious discussion among any group of friends who see the movie together.
I:420;2777;in fact, this would be a good movie to screen for almost any classroom because of the lively, larger debate it invites.
I:420;2778;I loved 6th sense, and have been attending Night's movies ever since, watching them get progressively worse.
I:420;2779;two stars for James Newton Howard's often beautiful score and the refreshing romance between the quietly powerful Phoenix and the lovely Bryce Dallas Howard.
I:420;2780;As allways with such a fine movie maker, people do the one thing that they allways do, COMPARE.
I:420;2781;If you watch it without prejudice you will enjoy it.
I:420;2782;This film will withstand the test of time, and I for one will watch it time and time again.
I:420;2783;As with all M. Night's movies the more you watch it the more you like it.
I:420;2784;I am happy to add it to my NIGHT COLLECTION.
I:420;2785;When i went to see this movie in the movie theater I was expecting another Signs, which I thought was an awesome movie, another great horror/thriller.
I:420;2786;The final twist was interesting though, i honestly didnt see that coming [.]
I:420;2787;This movie is good only once.
I:420;2788;The movie ''The Village'' by M. Night Shamalon was one of my first and best scary movies I have even seen.
I:420;2789;This movie is great for people who are into detail and deep story/plot lines.
I:420;2790;Once again, M. Night Shyamalan delivers a story of great value.
I:420;2791;Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix) approaches the village elders and requests to journey through the woods to the town to retrieve medicine.
I:420;2792;"i must say, though not one of M. Night's best, ""The Village"" is an interesting movie."
I:420;2793;The setting is beautiful, the mysterious creatures are intriguing, and the atmosphere with which the characters respond to the threat of them is quite exhilarating.
I:420;2794;M. Night is one who delivers scares, but Ivy's trip through the woods seemed like a regular walk in the park.
I:420;2795;the twist of the movie is a great idea, but it came too soon so it felt as if the movie was over before the actual ending.
I:420;2796;It was as if M. Night dropped subtle suggestion in favor of outright explanation, as if he completely forgot the art of inference.
I:420;2797;"I'll be honest, though an excellent movie that touches on a lot of life's issues of growing in maturity and relationships, the handling of the twist is nothing compared to ""The Others""."
I:420;2798;But it's still worth the money to have it in your collection.
I:420;2799;It's become one of my favorites .
I:420;2800;well made, with great music to enhance the story.
I:420;2801;"He first made a good movie ""The Sixth Sense"" then made a somewhat okay attempt ""Unbreakable"" where he clearly demonstrated he had lost some direction and then completely cheated audiences in ""Signs"" with green."
I:420;2802;"1 ""The Village"" got the well."
I:420;2803;Shyamalan worked wonders building the characters and establishing the plot.
I:420;2804;I can sum this movie up in one word.
I:420;2805;Those we do not speak of but are having a council meeting concerning them.
I:420;2806;sound) with an open mind, then it is a great watch.
I:420;2807;"And the ""debut"" actress is impressive, but suitably forgettable ( since the key players all shine based on her performance)."
I:420;2808;piece of the film in more ways than one.
I:420;2809;i did enjoy Night's cameo .
I:420;2810;Anyways, if you view it as a good drama, or just as a good film to watch, and don't bring the baggage of the previous films, then you will definitely enjoy a very tense, and beautifully atmospheric film.
I:420;2811;This movie had great moments, and I especially loved the sense of community in the apartment complex and the characterization of Cleveland Heep, who discovers the narf.
I:420;2812;That actor, Paul Giamatti, was amazing and brought such warmth and sympathy to his character.
I:420;2813;The ensemble cast was top.
I:420;2814;notch, and everyone did the most with what they were given.
I:420;2815;Noah is such an example.
I:420;2816;The young people really bought into this legend, and thus they are controlled in part based on fear (for they are afraid to venture beyond the well.
I:420;2817;This movie is definitely food for thought in terms of social commentary.
I:420;2818;i enjoyed the extra features, including Bryce's diary.
I:420;2819;"I loved most of Shyamalan's previous work, ""Sixth Sense"", ""The Signs"", but felt a little disappointed after watching ""The Village"" as it seemed a little predictable when the plot twists would come instead of being shocked into horror."
I:420;2820;But it was good, because there was beauty in it, and that is quite rare in horror films.
I:420;2821;I think the idea of the film was very good, and surprise in the end too, even though the plot was not so brilliant.
I:420;2822;M. Night Shaymalan has done it again!
I:420;2823;"One after the those, this director produces psychological scary movies that leave you saying ""Oh my gosh, I never saw that coming!"""
I:420;2824;This movie's ending will shock and surprise you.
I:420;2825;This movie WILL SCARE you!
I:420;2826;Unbreakable, Signs and The Village have hopefully by now discouraged producers to do another one!
I:420;2827;the Village is pure period suspense and romance.
I:420;2828;It makes you think and it has M. Night Shyamalan's signiture twist ending.
I:420;2829;I loved the feel of the movie and the look.
I:420;2830;This is what made the movie excellent.
I:420;2831;The story may not have been strong, but the actors made it believable.
I:420;2832;Mr. Shyamalan himself said he considered Wuthering Heights to be a kind of inspiration for this film.
I:420;2833;This flick makes any Ed Wood film seem mesmerizing.
I:420;2834;The Village is the fourth film by M. Night Shayamalan, and as with his earlier films, Night has created a film that will leave audiences guessing throughout the story.
I:420;2835;A solitary, quiet but caring man, Lucius believes that the ailments of the town can only be solved by going beyond their borders and seeking out the aid of the people that live beyond the woods.
I:420;2836;shayamalan, who takes credit for writing, producing and directing this film, weaves a story that is one part love story, one part societal drama, and one part ghost story, blending story and suspense in a way that will leave audiences clinging to the edge of their seats.
I:420;2837;Night's characters are believable, and, as with his earlier films, drive the story and make the scary moments all the more intense, the moments of romance that much more tender, and the drama that much more believable.
I:420;2838;i highly recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for a story with enough twists to keep even veteran fans of M. Night Shayamalan guessing to the very end.
I:420;2839;For anyone familiar with Night's films, this one has his trademark twist ending, but the twist will totally take you by surprise.
I:420;2840;The result is that it is now my favorite movie of all time.
I:420;2841;One of the main reasons the film is so good is it is full of emotion.
I:420;2842;All of the members of the cast do an amazing job, and the soundtrack is one of the best I have heard, with beautiful melodies and haunting sounds.
I:420;2843;The Village is the sixth film written and directed by the now infamous M. Night Shyamalan.
I:420;2844;I feel that M. Night Shyamalan felt he needed to provide a twist ending so he made the film progress the way it did.
I:420;2845;"He could have played it from the perspective of the ""elders"" and the sacrifices they made keeping their children pure and innocent."
I:420;2846;understand: I loved Sixth Sense and Unbreakable.
I:420;2847;They were both quite good, as was William Hurt and the rest of the supporting cast.
I:420;2848;"the ""twist"" was completely self."
I:420;2849;"I laughed out loud and nearly left the theater when the ""fearsome creatures of darkness"" arrived."
I:420;2850;"The funny thing is, in ""Signs"" you only got a couple of brief glances of the aliens, so it's clear that Shyamalan has seen ""Jaws"" and maybe the first ""Alien"" as well."
I:420;2851;Cast your mind back to 1999.
I:420;2852;he's back, with a darkly gothic thriller set in a small Pensylvanian village in the late 1800s.
I:420;2853;the first half is lit up by one set piece, the creatures coming into the village to warn us the truce has ended, and that is very well done, Shyalaman showing shades of genuis behind the flaws.
I:420;2854;Average for him, but certainly worth a trip down the multiplex for.
I:420;2855;This is M. Night's best so far, even better then the sixth sense.
I:420;2856;The performances are good, Bryce esspecially deserves an oscar nom.
I:420;2857;The story is well thought out and the twist at the end is very interesting.
I:420;2858;I think it deserves about 8 nominations esspecially screenplay, Byrce's performance, and maybe best pic.
I:420;2859;If the creatures were real they could have symbolized all the bad in the world and M. Night could make up a better conclusion, but o well the one thats there is good enough to make this M. Nights best.
I:420;2860;In comparison to signs and the sixth sense this isnt as good but compare it to the notebook it is damn good.
I:420;2861;If it is the guessing game type, does it keep me guessing?
I:420;2862;Does the action have me at the edge of my seat?
I:420;2863;Most of all, is the movie believable?
I:420;2864;Maybe the craziest, but most brilliant twist I have ever seen.
I:420;2865;Loved and cared for the characters, the romance was beautiful, and the theme was excellent: we cannot run from our sorrows nor our sin.
I:420;2866;I keep watching this film throughout the years and never tire.
I:420;2867;His script gave it away, but the acting is superb!
I:420;2868;The music is outstanding, and it is on my favorite list for best acted film.
I:420;2869;After the movie was over, I left the theater stunned by what an amazing character portrait I had just witnessed.
I:420;2870;(By the way, I loved Unbreakable, The Sixth Sense, and Signs equally as much as The Village.)
I:420;2871;The love story between a young blind girl and an older simpleton.
I:420;2872;like man is captivating all by itself.
I:420;2873;"The girl, Ivy, is wise beyond her years
I:420;2874;One thing she captures is the essence of the quiet worker Lucius.
I:420;2875;They fall in love and share a sweet, quiet romance despite the fact that creepy monsters are haunting the small town.
I:420;2876;It's wonderful writing, directing, and acting.
I:420;2877;I recommend this movie to anyone with a mind open enough to forget that a one trick pony can only do the same trick, in this case the most shocking twist ending, so many times before it gets old.
I:420;2878;I say, Shyamalan's latest trick is his best yet.
I:420;2879;"If ""Signs"" may have hinted at Shyamalan being a one."
I:420;2880;With twists I could spot from a mile, with my shades on.
I:420;2881;Bryce Dallas Howard's performance is the one bright spot in an otherwise terrible film.
I:420;2882;In this modest village, the townsfolk are friendly and easy going.
I:420;2883;tempered and seem to have strong family bonds.
I:420;2884;There are chickens and sheep .
I:420;2885;There is a truce among them .
I:420;2886;spoken, thoughtful young man who is the only child of his widowed mother.
I:420;2887;His mother, played by Sigourney Weaver, is one of the town's elders.
I:420;2888;even if you catch on to the plot before the film comes to an end, you will still be entertained.
I:420;2889;The film is so well shot .
I:420;2890;every angle and reflection is so well.
I:420;2891;it is truly a work of art.
I:420;2892;it will keep you guessing until almost the end.
I:420;2893;The PG.13 rating is appropriate, in my opinion.
I:420;2894;Definetely a movie to see again!
I:420;2895;Miss Howard did a wonderful job as a blind young girl.
I:420;2896;The concept ofhiding from a corrupt world is far fetched but enjoyed the interaction of the twoyoung people was heart.
I:420;2897;Like Rod Serling's classic series M. Night Shyamalan's films go beyond easy classification.
I:420;2898;"perhaps The Village and his other films may or may not compare favorably to Rod Serling's most memorable Twilight Zone episodes but I certainly appreciate the creative effort in bringing this kind of modern ""fairy tales"" for adults."
I:420;2899;"And the lengths they go through in order to maintain their ""ideal"" society
I:420;2900;This was the story M. Night Shyamalan wanted to tell and I believe he succeeded brilliantly.
I:420;2901;This film was absolutely incredible to me.
I:420;2902;I love the way that reviewer Alesha L. Gee and others put it.
I:420;2903;This film is very deep .
I:420;2904;one of the most powerful and thoughtful I have seen.
I:420;2905;I'm just happy that I was able to experience this incredible movie.
I:420;2906;Nobody knows that there was also a small village located in a valley surrounded by Covington woods where strange creatures exist.
I:420;2907;The villagers moved there years before, disgusted with the urban lifestyle and wanted to lead a simple life.
I:420;2908;The music was excellent and I liked it very much, so I think I should watch Sixth Sense and Signs too.
I:420;2909;It's about love, courage, and dealing with grief and the world.
I:420;2910;Give this movie a few decades, and I'm sure it'll be looked on as a classic.
I:420;2911;The Village isn't a typical horror movie, and once viewers manage to get past that point, they'll find the movie has many subtle nuances and a lot to offer.
I:420;2912;I had great fun with it.
I:420;2913;The Village is solid entertainment that just needs a few years to find the right audience.
I:420;2914;Bring a pillow, this S U C K S!
I:420;2915;I enjoy M. Night Shyamalan's films for his willingness to press further into the human experience of the strange, both metaphysically and culturally.
I:420;2916;"while I did not find ""The Village"" to be Shyamalan's best work, the film was well done."
I:420;2917;Suspenseful moments keep it lively while the details of 19th century living were well crafted.
I:420;2918;The cast was wonderful, all performances well done.
I:420;2919;Despite the film not being quite what is expected in theme or delivery, it's a notable feather in Shyamalan's cap, nonetheless.
I:420;2920;It was a quirky sense of humour and ended up biting its own tail.
I:420;2921;I call that an amazing success.
I:420;2922;that is why i am telling you the truth.
I:420;2923;I DID like and still do Signs and The Sixth Sense.
I:420;2924;The visuals were very good.
I:420;2925;a lot of people are saying that the girl playing a blind girl gave the best performance.
I:420;2926;while she gave a good performance, don't forget adrien brody, his performance was pretty dang good.
I:420;2927;it's not scary, it just makes you jump a little, the same as his other films and like his other films, he always manages to sneak in a performance of his own.
I:420;2928;Yeah I work for a living as a butcher and earn a paycheck that I can be proud of.
I:420;2929;see this movie without listening to the opinions of others because it's up to you to decide what is good and what is not.
I:420;2930;Just watch this movie for what it is, not what you want it to be!
I:420;2931;This is a story of love, and of hope and innocence.
I:420;2932;so please, if the only thing thats holding you back from seeing this is the critics, or your friends, then see it anyway.
I:420;2933;if you enjoy a good love story, or even an art.
I:420;2934;sy type of suspence movie, then im sure you will enjoy it.
I:420;2935;Shyamalan is one of the few who knows how to use music for film, who can make the music be a character in the movie.
I:420;2936;The plus to this movie is the outstanding performance by Bryce Howard.
I:420;2937;What a great performance she gave us playing a blind girl.
I:420;2938;I must say that this is one of those movies that is better the 2nd time you watch it.
I:420;2939;"After watching it the 1st time, I would have given it probably a 1 star but now having seen it 3 times, I now give it 3 stars between the acting, the plot and the ""love story""."
I:420;2940;It is truly better the 2nd time around.
I:420;2941;The Sixth Sense was great.
I:420;2942;It was interesting and original and filled with wonderful surprises.
I:420;2943;"I have seen all of M. Night Shyamalan's films, and only ""The Sixth Sense"" is worth seeing."
I:420;2944;Please Mr. Shyamalan, get away from Hollywood, do not listen to what executives at the studios tell you, and write something worth seeing again.
I:420;2945;well, I'll be the first to say that film is a dying art.
I:420;2946;I have four teenagers in the house, and they've seen two movies this year (the new Batman, and the new Star Wars).
I:420;2947;I've really enjoyed all of Shyamalan's work and this one does not disappoint.
I:420;2948;It has a great storyline and the end surprises you.
I:420;2949;It had a lot of suspense and tense moments like only M. Night can do.
I:420;2950;Great job by my favorite director.
I:420;2951;The Village however is the cream that rises to the top of Shyamalan's portfolio.
I:420;2952;Admittedly it draws you in as a horror movie or at least a suspense thriller but it evolves into/ is something else.
I:420;2953;The Village is really a story of love and utopian beliefs and whether or not they can come to fruition either today or at any point in the history of man.
I:420;2954;This movie explores the relationships between: a man and a woman, friends, family and community and then produces a well thought out work of art.
I:420;2955;Shyamalan has crafted a movie with as much intellect as a book and that is no easy feat.
I:420;2956;all of you who understood this movie should pat yourself on the back and all of you who didn't should watch it again because it is perhaps one of the best movies of the year.
I:420;2957;But The Village is actually the last thing you expect.
I:420;2958;After my dad explained it to me, I was able to shed some light on The Village and actually enjoy it.
I:420;2959;It's no The 6th Sense, or even another Signs, but James Atkinson proves that he's a pretty good director, and I think that if you approach this movie with an open mind, you can actually enjoy it.
I:420;2960;But like I said, if you watch it with an open mind, you may find The Village entertaining.
I:420;2961;if you think about it, the whole film speaks volumes about what is going on every single day all around us.
I:420;2962;Indeed, the world does move for love, and kneel in awe at it.
I:420;2963;It's one of the most incredible films of the last ten years, easy.
I:420;2964;Just fine dialogue, fine acting, and a theme worth embracing.
I:420;2965;This Is A Great Movie.
I:420;2966;"The viewer is taken to new heights of suspense and I found myself pushing the ""pause"" button to utilize the bathroom facilities."
I:420;2967;The supporting cast, although, is mesmerizing and TOTALLY excuses the tertiary performances of the main performers.
I:420;2968;"This film is a ""pleasant scare""."
I:420;2969;This is an OVERTLY enjoyable horror film with vast depths of drama.
I:420;2970;there are more than one major twists in the movie, and other smaller ones.
I:420;2971;This is a thoughtful and atmospheric shocker, outstandingly handled in every respect (not least of all the multiple high.
I:420;2972;"M. Night Shymalan has yet to deliver a bad or even a merely average movie (although a lot of people in the media seem to be holding their breath and hoping he does, for some reason), and ""The Village"", along with ""Unbreakable"", is one of his two best in my opinion."
I:420;2973;the acting is superb as is the casting, the lead however, goes to Bryce Dallas Howard as Ivy Walker and Phoenix as Lucius Hunt.
I:420;2974;The script, the music, the cinematography are all excellent.
I:420;2975;The music especially is memorable for weaving an atmosphere of that gives you images of suspense, terror but it is also beautiful orchestral music.
I:420;2976;"i see this as Shyamalan's attempt at breaking out of the ""thriller"" genre that the superb ""The Sixth Sense"" has entombed him in."
I:420;2977;This is his introduction to his other talents at filmmaking.
I:420;2978;It is Shyamalans version of an emotional film with scenes of terror and suspense throughout.
I:420;2979;above all this film is about the innocence in us, and the means that some people will go to preserve it.
I:420;2980;If you want a film that makes you think, that will also scare you but one that is also eerie and hauntingly beautiful then you must see this film, it shows a whole new side to M. Night Shyamalan who is a filmmaker who must be known by more than his previous films.
I:420;2981;In an interview with Charlie Rose a few years ago, Quentin Tarantino made a very interesting point .
I:420;2982;By and large Hollywood sells us stars in situations .
I:420;2983;programming that is the secret to his success .
I:420;2984;driven movies engaging fundamental themes.
I:420;2985;i know everyone will expect the plot twist, and there's enough foreshadowing that it's easier to spot than in some of his previous efforts, but that's not the reason to see this film.
I:420;2986;some of the scenes between them are lyrically lovely, and then you realize after the twist is revealed, how lyrical and meaningful the interactions among the elders, and between the elders and the next generation are.
I:420;2987;I just finished watching The Village and I must say with all sincerity that it is M. Night Shyamalan's best work.
I:420;2988;Not only is it his best film but I will go so far as to say it may join the ranks of my favorite movies of all time.
I:420;2989;The acting was perfect, real, touching.
I:420;2990;The sincerity and realness of each of the characters made me feel for them personally.
I:420;2991;the writing and dialog was beautiful and moving.
I:420;2992;The simplicity of the characters made the power of their essence all the more profound.
I:420;2993;The atmosphere and cinematography created the perfect mood in each scene.
I:420;2994;And the direction was genius.
I:420;2995;and this film kept me on the edge of my seat.
I:420;2996;It really did scare me and make me jump out of my chair a couple of times!The final resolution of the film I felt was perfect, inspiring and I was touched to tears.
I:420;2997;I give this film my highest marks for acting, cinematography, music (which was just right and never in the way of the movie nor did the movie rely on it) story and direction.
I:420;2998;Bryce Howard was excellent in this movie.
I:420;2999;She needs to have more leading roles.
I:420;3000;i liked his other movies.
I:420;3001;Rather cleverly paced with the right information given at the right time, this story may or may not keep you guessing.
I:420;3002;I found this very intriguing, and very entertaining.
I:420;3003;But with a price, as everything is.
I:420;3004;If you are a thinking person tuned into the world today, you will LOVE this movie.
I:420;3005;5 stars for a great idea, and exicution.
I:420;3006;Great for those who are looking for an original movie with a great plot.
I:420;3007;this film is the work of an absolutely rank amateur.
I:420;3008;"He's a Pennsylvania native, and is well known to be provincial about it
I:420;3009;"i did enjoy the possibly unintentional homage to Roeg's ""Don't Look Now"", in the form of the mysterious creature running around in a red cape."
I:420;3010;I'm rather pissed that everytime I see that masterpiece in the future I'm going to be reminded of this piece of celluloid dreck, which should be cut up into guitar picks.
I:420;3011;there's an excerpt from a Super 8 film that Shyamalan shot when he was 12 or something.
I:420;3012;I'm sure he'll continue to make millions.
I:420;3013;what we do have is simply a very haunting social commentary.
I:420;3014;It's a beautiful film, and you'll think about it long after its over.
I:420;3015;She was excellent, and I think that she should be nominated for an Oscar.
I:420;3016;Yes, she was THAT good.
I:420;3017;Everyone else in the cast was great.
I:420;3018;I didn't find the film slow at all, but many people who go to see it will see it that way.
I:420;3019;I believe that I may go see it again so I can look at it in this mind.
I:420;3020;I'll probably enjoy it alot more.
I:420;3021;is that M Night's brilliance does not lie in his ability to trick or surprise the viewer, it is his ability to entertain the viewer.
I:420;3022;to be honest, I've never found his plot twists to be especially clever or unpredictable, but I have always loved his movies because of the way he involves the viewer from the first scene onwards.
I:420;3023;this is another superb and well.
I:420;3024;cast movie from a great director, who is too often being judged by the wrong criteria.
I:420;3025;M. Night Shyamalan knows how to make a good movie.
I:420;3026;"I will go ahead and tell you this about his latest film, ""The Village,"" without giving away anything: Do not expect a serious horror film."
I:420;3027;"Expect a fine drama with a fine story and good performances by the likes of Bryce Dallas Howard (in her feature film debut), Joaquin Phoenix (""Gladiator,"" ""Signs""), Sigourney Weaver and William Hurt."
I:420;3028;"You can also expect a couple of good ""jump"" scenes."
I:420;3029;The cinematography is exceptional, creating a moody, suspenseful tale that doesn't depend on lurid special effects for its impact.
I:420;3030;The dialogue is a bit stilted, but the acting is solid, (impeccable in the case of Bryce Dallas Howard).
I:420;3031;But this film has a clever, well.
I:420;3032;executed premise and explores important questions about humanity in an entertaining way: can we escape tragedy?
I:420;3033;is it even worthwhile to try?Ultimately Shyamalan leads us to discover that we can't run from man's inhumanity to man because wherever we go we take it with us, but the effort is still noble because love and hope make the struggle worthwhile.
I:420;3034;It's superbly shot, cunningly edited, beautifully scored, and has a wonderful cast of established (though oddly stilted) stars and a startlingly good newcomer in Bryce Dallas Howard.
I:420;3035;Usually it's the brilliant linchpin of Shyamalan's work, but this one wears its post.9/11.
I:420;3036;Signs pulled that trick brilliantly .
I:420;3037;"For 90% of ""Signs"" we were terrifyingly entertained."
I:420;3038;This time around, when those moments come, they're handled with all the spine.
I:420;3039;chilling flair we've come to expect from Shyamalan, and you can't help smiling at how thoroughly you've been duped .
I:420;3040;and the extraordinary imaginative power of the man behind it all.
I:420;3041;the editing of voice over, music and images is pure magic.
I:420;3042;These moments make this kind of story worth telling.
I:420;3043;"See ""The Village"" by all means, but it's best if you DON'T expect horror and DO approach it with an open mind: kind of apt, I guess, given the hopeful political message Shyamalan's pushing this time around."
I:420;3044;update, October 3: I've seen this film twice now, and it's far better the second time around .
I:420;3045;When you aren't expecting to be frightened, the subtle tone of the first hour is much more readily appreciated, and really chimes with William Hurt's pronouncements on hope and love later in the film.
I:420;3046;Took a chance and got it because I didn't see it in the theatre.
I:420;3047;This movie comes across as a thriller in the movie trailers.
I:420;3048;It looked appealing to me.
I:420;3049;I bought the movie, and it literally sucked.
I:420;3050;I give it ONE STAR, for set, scenery and costuming.
I:420;3051;I'm ashamed I bought this.
I:420;3052;The ending is one of the dumbest in the history of movies.
I:420;3053;So my independent opinion of The Village is that it's an intriguing use of film as an artistic medium.
I:420;3054;Without any glitzy computerized effects, the director creates an atmosphere that gets his points across and arouses the emotions he wants to convey.
I:420;3055;I admired how the plot slowly builds to a surprising ending with each element revealing just a little more.
I:420;3056;She picked up some good ideas.
I:420;3057;This is a favorite of mine.
I:420;3058;Village is a good movie a gripping story, fine acting and I liked it, give it a chance you may like it too.
I:420;3059;The acting was good and the initial scenes do not reveal the ending.
I:420;3060;the idea for this movie was an interesting, unique one and pulled off well, however, there was a surprise twist (like all Shyamalan movies have) that took the movie in the wrong direction.
I:420;3061;So when small animals appear in the town, dead and skinned from the neck down, the people suspect the creatures have encroached the borders of their town.
I:420;3062;shyamalan has already established himself as a suspense artist very much akin to Alfred Hitchcock.
I:420;3063;And like Hitchcock, Shyamalan's films are less about what makes your skin crawl, but about people.
I:420;3064;And, to their credit, they exhibit the finer qualities of humanity.
I:420;3065;sacrifice and love serve as a refreshing example to many who still struggle with the notion that love is not a feeling, but an action.
I:420;3066;So I have to be careful what I post here as well but this is one unique village that deserves to be visited, if you know what I mean.
I:420;3067;dialouge about as intense as three wet., well you get the idea.
I:420;3068;So i just hope that his next movie will be better.
I:420;3069;I've always like Shyamalan's movies, he've got his angles on movies he make.
I:420;3070;A good movie doesnt need to be scarey to be good.
I:420;3071;I have problems to see what makes all these elements fits into one movie, I just dun see why is necessary to unfold that the village is actually an isolated area from the modern society and everyone inside are escapers from their normal life for their own reasons.
I:420;3072;My problem is, this part of the truth dun emotionally line up with the main plot.
I:420;3073;Let me begin by saying not all of this director's films are good or even passable as real films .
I:420;3074;the Village is a beautifully made film filled with amazon performances and just remarkable acting.
I:420;3075;This movie is a romance.
I:420;3076;One that shows the true meaning of love, courage, and truth.
I:420;3077;But, you can see the movie yourself and have your personal opininon on it.
I:420;3078;Lucious tells Ivy, his future bride.
I:420;3079;I do give credit for some great cinematography but thats it.
I:420;3080;Everyone walks thru their roles.
I:420;3081;Also, the main problem with Shyamalan's film is, after the release of The Sixth Sense and with every Shyamalan film there after, audiences know something is going to happen during the final act of the film, so they keep their eyes open for every little detail available thruout the course of the film.
I:420;3082;I was aware of the extremely diverse reaction to this movie.
I:420;3083;some people loved it, and many (including most professional critics) despised it.
I:420;3084;I felt that the monsters and their menace were very well presented.
I:420;3085;"on the blind girl, Ivy, the ""star"" of the movie, very well played by Ron Howard's daughter."
I:420;3086;"Perhaps that memory, or just common sense, led me to figure out the ""surprise"" ending well before it happened."
I:420;3087;the transparancy of this final plot twist is probably the movie's greatest flaw.
I:420;3088;there are definitely portions that are worth the time and effort, and I must say that is quite original in atmosphere and staging, if not plot.
I:420;3089;This is a great movie.
I:420;3090;This movie scares you with plot twists and suspense somewhat the way Signs did.
I:420;3091;The scariest moments are when you are not expecting something scary to happen.
I:420;3092;Don't listen to the critics, they don't know what a good movie is, and this my friends, is a good one.
I:420;3093;Nonetheless this film is still full of twists and turns that will keep you guessing till the end, it did for me.
I:420;3094;despite the fact that the movie does try to stick to the plotline, several moments were pretty slow, but Shyamalan tries to keep it interesting by showing several moments of suspense that only he can deliver, including a few seconds of us actually seeing the creatures in the light.
I:420;3095;But she is a remarkable person who can actually do a lot of what other people cant, and she is great in this movie.
I:420;3096;She is also the character that Lucius is afraid of for her safety.
I:420;3097;Kind of a real shocker if you think about it.
I:420;3098;as for the scary scenes, they definately deliver, my opinion, and are relatively evened out in the movie, though the first hour rearely has them.
I:420;3099;"While I heard a lot of negative reviews about this movie, being a huge fan of every other M. Night movie, I of course HAD to go see ""The Village""!"
I:420;3100;all the experience was good, not great, but good.
I:420;3101;Was it worth the money?
I:420;3102;And obviously for each writer there will always be one masterpiece that stands out and some work that isn't as good as the rest.
I:420;3103;As far as the twist goes, I am pretty good at guessing endings and I did NOT guess this one.
I:420;3104;It can never live up to what's inside your mind.
I:420;3105;As far as the plot goes, I think it was quite original and creative.
I:420;3106;Plus, the movie had many top.
I:420;3107;"I was quite impressed with a few ""new."
I:420;3108;The only good thing in this movie was Ms. Howard's performance, she is innocent and believable.
I:420;3109;One hour later, I was right.
I:420;3110;Again, I would've enjoyed the movie if the story and the characters were worth caring about.
I:420;3111;"Brilliant as the film was, its ""twist"" ending was so powerful that audiences the world over expected nothing less from the talented young director."
I:420;3112;Signs, another incredibly produced chiller with a magnificent resolution showed his growth both as a screenwriter and director.
I:420;3113;The Village begins ominous and promising, yet there are only a few genuine scenes which make you jump out of your skin.
I:420;3114;The film is most appealing stepping back and watching these characters interact, captured with Shyamalan's meticulous, mannered camera moves and pace, never breathing too deeply or trying too hard, outside of his clunky dialog.
I:420;3115;Despite his failings as writer here, director Shymalan and his cinematographer do well here and produce a film that looks great and manages to produce some images that are memorable and effective.
I:420;3116;Howard steals the film with stupendous effectiveness and charm.
I:420;3117;Her actions may grate as they seem so very unlikely but her actual performance is very good and she makes a good heart of the film once she is moved into that position in the second half.
I:420;3118;A visually stunning and moderately scary political stab at the genre, yet overall the film leaves the audience with a strange sense of deception.
I:420;3119;lots of reviewers stated that the twist ending of this film was easy to predict within the first 10 minutes of this film.
I:420;3120;It is simply a romantic drama with a spooky back.
I:420;3121;I liked it and liked the plot twists, however it does leave one with many unanswered questions.
I:420;3122;Oh that's right, they did knew something, a lot of something.
I:420;3123;Bryce (cool name) Howard played a convincing blind Ivy, she was lovely and had an awesome voice .
I:420;3124;just to listen to her speak was a delight.
I:420;3125;At least it seemed that the actors had a good time filming it .
I:420;3126;He is still young so maybe he has yet to realize that true fame comes from others admiring your work and not from you just thinking that everything you do is great.
I:420;3127;All that's left is the acting, subplots, and scenery.
I:420;3128;shyamalan skips the subtlety that made Sixth Sense such a surprise ending.
I:420;3129;For those too slow to take the hint, with a lot of time remaining, he reveals the truth yet the last third of the movie relies on creating tension that a principal character .
I:420;3130;M. Night Shyamalan is a genius, this is an edge of your seat.
I:420;3131;thriller that keeps you wandering what is really going on in the village.
I:420;3132;Always a good twist at the end.
I:420;3133;I love this movie as well as all of Shyamalan books turned movies.
I:420;3134;The thrill of not knowing until the end makes the books/movies much more intriguing!!
I:420;3135;Far from his best work, the film lumbers along, and upon waking, my wife brought me up to speed on the plot twists in about two sentences.
I:420;3136;If you're into movies with silly fixations on color and dress from an indeterminate period, then you may enjoy this.
I:420;3137;"You can't go into this movie with any preconceived notions
I:420;3138;I truly loved this movie, although it will be a while before I want to see it again.
I:420;3139;Bryce Dallas Howard has a huge award.
I:420;3140;winning career ahead of her if she sticks to the right roles.
I:420;3141;I do understand the metaphor, which is a beautiful message, but I don't like him taking ideas.
I:420;3142;The directing is great and when watching it you really feel like you are in the setting of the film.
I:420;3143;I would recommend people to watch it, but don't expect it to be a great Shyamalan film.
I:420;3144;That may not be scary but it is suspenseful and entertaining.
I:420;3145;They were also telling dramatic stories with a twist ending.
I:420;3146;a deeper and more satisfying experience.
I:420;3147;he is very refreshing and I THANK HIM!
I:420;3148;They are bound by a few rules: 1.
I:420;3149;and so we begin to get scared!DISLIKES?I totally enjoyed the movie.
I:420;3150;He totally threw us with The Sixth Sense back in 1999.
I:420;3151;Night, with that kind of pressure, still is able to put together a very entertaining movie.
I:420;3152;And even though I guessed the one part, I still totally enjoyed the movie.
I:420;3153;Because there is more than a surprise twist ending from Night's films.
I:420;3154;There is heart, compassion, fear, hate and love.
I:420;3155;lIKES?Night always gives us a little and we fill in the rest along the way.
I:420;3156;This film continues that tradition.
I:420;3157;That is done well too.
I:420;3158;I also enjoyed that even though the movie is advertised as a demonic evil that would engulfs the villagers lives, I am glad to say there is nothing demonic at any level in this film.
I:420;3159;Actually, you will laugh at yourself after you have seen it.
I:420;3160;rECOMMEND?If you enjoyed: Night's other films .
I:420;3161;go watch Unbreakable again, and appreciate the depth of detail.
I:420;3162;So naturally, I just had to see it.
I:420;3163;It was like Blade, that had really bad reviews, and when I saw it, I loved it.
I:420;3164;The new actress whats her name, was cool.
I:420;3165;I really look forward to enjoy more flicks with her.
I:420;3166;She has got a sertain look.
I:420;3167;Dont believe the hype, and enjoy a movie with an interesting twist.
I:420;3168;the Pianist guy, Brody or whats his name, is really funny and scary in this movie.
I:420;3169;It has quite alot of twists and turns and surprises instore for it's audience.
I:420;3170;Oh and keep an eye out for Night's cameo.
I:420;3171;The Village is a thrilling tale of an isolated village confronting the astonishing truth that lies just outside its borders.
I:420;3172;At first glance, this village seems picture perfect, but this close.
I:420;3173;knit community lives with the frightening knowledge that creatures reside in the surrounding woods.
I:420;3174;I wish I could tell you the 2 amazing twists in this film, and it's sturring conclusion but I can't ruin it for you guys!
I:420;3175;I'm not a big fan of M. Night Shyamalan's work, but I have to admit that I really liked this movie.
I:420;3176;I didn't think I was going to like it going into the theater and I actually didn't think I was going to like it half way through the movie, but I thought it was great.
I:420;3177;this movie is a love story above everything else, but I also believe that it's a metaphor of the way our (and other people's) government/ruling.
I:420;3178;I think the monsters represent the way our government uses the fear of terrorism/communism/whatever to keep us in line.
I:420;3179;It's a story about the power of love and a strong political commentary.
I:420;3180;I know its a bold statement, but The Village backs it up.
I:420;3181;ups where the tension has the viewer on the edge of their seat, but upon final viewing, it belongs in a category all its own.
I:420;3182;The strength of this story lies in the romance and in the tension on the border between the Village (rationality, love, security) and the Woods (violence, insanity .
I:420;3183;The Village was one of those great movies that somehow I managed to miss in the theaters.
I:420;3184;I really liked how this aspect of the film played out.
I:420;3185;the cameo by Shyamalan was also well done, although it was easy to see if you were looking for it.
I:420;3186;Excluding the price gouging special editions, of course.
I:420;3187;as always, Shyamalan included one of his films he made as a child.
I:420;3188;off on Indiana Jones, which was funny and amazing at the same time.
I:420;3189;Shyamalan had a lot of talent from a young age.
I:420;3190;Good stuff to look back on now.
I:420;3191;an interesting thing about this movie, there is a twist at the end that no one is going to see coming.
I:420;3192;unless you have some common sense and a bit of an imagination.
I:420;3193;The Village is one of the more reviled films of recent years but for me, much to my surprise, one of the best.
I:420;3194;and concentrate on the characters experiencing extraordinary events.
I:420;3195;The Village is certainly more character.
I:420;3196;More surprising too is that for the first time Shyamalan reveals himself to be a surprisingly good writer for women, with Howard's part one of the best for a leading actress in a mainstream film in years.
I:420;3197;Just as interesting is Shyamalan's emphasis on body language and unspoken communication .
I:420;3198;Very impressive indeed despite a few awkward patches.
I:420;3199;I thoroughly enjoyed The Village as it showed why a group of people would do what they did.
I:420;3200;A lot of great talent in this movie so the acting was very good.
I:420;3201;"the acting is full of emotion, yet restrained
I:420;3202;shyamalan's direction of the images, light, and sound in the movie is first rate.
I:420;3203;Shyamalan has definitely learned from Hitchcock, the person who his work owes the most to.
I:420;3204;The human imagination is so much more powerful than what can be shown on the screen.
I:420;3205;In fact, my appreciation for the film increased.
I:420;3206;Instead, it's a love story and one of the best love stories I've watched in a long time.
I:420;3207;The love that is shared between Lucius and Ivy is a love that is strong, purposeful, and realistic.
I:420;3208;THE VILLAGE is a testament to real love.
I:420;3209;It shows us what it really means to love another person.
I:420;3210;That's something we need to hear more and more often.
I:420;3211;i really enjoyed THE VILLAGE.
I:420;3212;It's one of the best love stories to come out in a long time.
I:420;3213;I'm not sure what Shyamalan's faith is, but I do know that he is making some of the most powerful religious movies today.
I:420;3214;After tackling the issues of accepting one's identity in THE SIXTH SENSE and UNBREAKABLE, exploring the nature of faith in SIGNS, and now examining charity and hope in THE VILLAGE, I am quite curious to see what Christian virtue Shyamalan delves into next.
I:420;3215;I enjoyed watching the featurettes.
I:420;3216;I really love this movie and i really loved M. Night Shayamalan!
I:420;3217;It is full of drama and suspense and beautiful storytelling.
I:420;3218;We complain so much about original storys and movies, well here is one!
I:420;3219;Ok here's the ending: It turns out Al Pacino is the DEVIL!
I:420;3220;"Most child actors have some kind of catchphrase, as Shyamalan's trademark is the ""Gotcha!"""
I:420;3221;Each movie he has produced thus far has been a world apart and altogether unique from any other he has made.
I:420;3222;William Golding's classic, Lord of the Flies, was criticised for not tieing up those loose ends.
I:420;3223;"Now, we look back and see that we were wrong
I:420;3224;It is NOT what its predecessors were, but it is good nonetheless.
I:420;3225;The film itself was mediocre, but the portrayal of a blind girl by Bryce Dallas Howard was brilliant.
I:420;3226;Her character alone makes it a movie worth seeing.
I:420;3227;"I think ""The Village"" is wonderful."
I:420;3228;M. night Shyamalan has done it again.
I:420;3229;despite what people say(you can't please everbody) I enjoyed the movie and it was better then I had thought.
I:420;3230;bryce Dallas Howard gave an incredable preformance and Joaquin Phoenix, was and always will be, amazing.
I:420;3231;it's romantic,sad,funny,and scary what more could you want in a movie?
I:420;3232;There are some tense sequences and the beautiful score only enhance them.
I:420;3233;And there is a twist.
I:420;3234;The acting is quite good especially by Bryce Dallas who had the most endearing role.
I:420;3235;I love the mood of this film.
I:420;3236;Like I said, its not terribly chilling or graphic in any way, but it will keep your attention.
I:420;3237;paced by any means, but it is more of a character driven type of film, so we actually get to know the characters quite well.
I:420;3238;What everyone should keep in mind is that this was a love story with supernatural, mystical, and theological flavorings.
I:420;3239;Darn good yarn with happy ending.
I:420;3240;Kept me entertained, and that isn't easy!
I:420;3241;another excellent thing about the movie is its smashing soundtrack!
I:420;3242;It is beautiful, and really adds flavor to the movie.
I:420;3243;Instead of watching this film do something more interesting .
I:420;3244;Jit was wheel worth my time.
I:420;3245;This is one of my favorite movies.
I:420;3246;Seriously, I love almost all this stuff.
I:420;3247;Signs is a great thriller until the somewhat lame and anticlimactic ending.
I:420;3248;leez, we are NOT that smart!
I:420;3249;The second twist came as quite a surprise, and was accompanied by a 'WTF!!??'
I:420;3250;Go home, eat dinner, and let the second, final twist marinate in your brain for awhile.
I:420;3251;Again, givin' us too much credit here, M. Night!
I:420;3252;Either is good with me.
I:420;3253;The few scenes that were scary were done with chilling effectiveness.
I:420;3254;boy who will triumph through the physical prowess that only a man can possess (relax, I'm being sarcastic).
I:420;3255;I always enjoy movies with a real , believeable female protagonist.
I:420;3256;Howard, apart from being utterly adorable and very pretty (I have a weakness for redheads with freckles), is mesmerising and enthralling to watch on screen as she plays her character with genuine emotion and subtle perfection.
I:420;3257;Joaquin Phoenix is decent, also going for the subtle, quiet approach.
I:420;3258;I truly expected better from veteran actor William Hurt.
I:420;3259;level sociology thesis, at the heart of this movie is also a touching love story about the lengths that said adorable blind girl will go for l'amor.
I:420;3260;Really, after seeing this movie, you will think to yourself, wow, now THAT'S love.
I:420;3261;So, let's recap: sociology project, love story.
I:420;3262;I know you'll still go see the movie expecting it to scare you.
I:420;3263;The commercials are powerful, and the notions are set deep.
I:420;3264;And certain parts of the movie WILL give you a jump, for the time being at least.
I:420;3265;All I can say is, give this movie a chance.
I:420;3266;one last note: prior to seeing the Village I was well.
I:420;3267;"To my amazement, I really enjoyed the ""Village""."
I:420;3268;And I hope Bryce Dallas Howard has a long and illustrious career, because she is much more interesting to watch than the majority of actresses her age.
I:420;3269;my favorite line that came out of nowhere: Will you dance with me on our wedding day?
I:420;3270;I find dancing most aggreable.
I:420;3271;Now that the dust has settled the subtle insights can be seen.
I:420;3272;I thought that was pretty clever.
I:420;3273;The deeper meaning of the movie is cleverly placed into the plot.
I:420;3274;Great performances by Howards and Phoenix.
I:420;3275;I would say this is the third best M. Night suspense movie behind the Sixth Sense and Unbreakable.
I:420;3276;howard is incredible, and you basically have to fall in love with her character.
I:420;3277;PLEASE!As for people that go around spoiling movies, they are cheating people out of the possiblity of a really cool viewing experience.
I:420;3278;i liked sixth sense, unbreakable, and signs.
I:420;3279;It didnt really even make sense.
I:420;3280;i mean, this is a freakin love story at best.
I:420;3281;Before M. Night Shyamalan morphed into the Rod Serling of movies, he made very funny and clever short amateur films.
I:420;3282;"Because Shyamalan's film plays like an extended version of ""The Twilight Zone"" and his amateur films were imitations of the film directors he admired (Spielberg for one)."
I:420;3283;"The townspeople and the creatures developed an alliance early on
I:420;3284;When the death occurs Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix)offers to brave the woods and go to the nearest town for vitally needed medicines.
I:420;3285;Ivy's blindness also gives her a unique perception of others.
I:420;3286;"a well constructed suspense thriller ""The Village"" shares much in common with Shyamalan's other thrillers ""The Sixth Sense"", ""Unbreakable"" and ""Signs"")."
I:420;3287;"Although the formula of at the heart of his films might be wearing a bit thin for critics, filmgoers will enjoy ""The Village"" for the atmospheric world that Shyamalan dreams up."
I:420;3288;"The suspenseful pacing, twists and turns in the plot and strong performances by the cast will make ""The Village"" memorable."
I:420;3289;It's a worthwhile film even if a bit predictable by the conclusion of the film.
I:420;3290;It takes tremendous self confidence and as the plot finally begins to take shape, audiences will appreciate it (although some will be mad just as they were at Hitchcock when he made his classic film).
I:420;3291;Shyamalan, like a lot of film directors (most notably Steven Spielberg) didn't want to do a commentary track perhaps fearing tht it might rob the film of its mystique.
I:420;3292;"Rod Serling would be proud of the twists, turns and symbolism in ""The Village"" and that's high praise, indeed."
I:420;3293;The film prompted much discussion among my family at the conclusion.
I:420;3294;the film takes place in a village set in a valley ringed with a forest.
I:420;3295;There is a shot of a tombstone in the cemetery early on in the film that shows a date of 1897, and the village certainly wouldn't be out of place in the 19th century.
I:420;3296;spoken Lucious Hunt, well played by Joaquin Phoenix and the independent, but blind, Ivy Walker, wonderfully played by Bryce Dallas Howard.
I:420;3297;Both Phoenix and Howard are marvellous in their roles, and are surrounded by a great cast including William Hurt as Ivy's father Edward Walker, Sigourney Weaver as Lucious's mother Alice Hunt and especially Adrien Brody as the mildly retarded Noah Percy.
I:420;3298;One of the real treats of this movie is watching how these strong characters interact with each other.
I:420;3299;shyamalan did an outstanding job directing the cast, and a phenomenal job of filming.
I:420;3300;Every shot is well thought out, and only shows you what he wants you to see.
I:420;3301;Especially powerful are the shots of the creatures, for the most part mere suggestions of figures in red, Shyamalan lets your imagination fill in the rest.
I:420;3302;The brooding autumnal forest around the valley makes for especially powerful images.
I:420;3303;The green and austere village fits in perfectly with it's surroundings.
I:420;3304;Shyamalan's use of strange angles really help to create the mood and bring out the best in his storytelling.
I:420;3305;above all Shyamalan is a craftsmen, and The Village is a well.
I:420;3306;Some may guess the secret before the end, but no one can doubt that this is a powerful story of love, well acted, and well filmed.
I:420;3307;The Village is probably the best allegory's ever made.
I:420;3308;What do people raise to scare the public.
I:420;3309;With all the well known great actors in this film, I expected better.
I:420;3310;robed creature was effectively chilling.
I:420;3311;"And it does have the beautiful Judy Greer (mmmmmmm, HERE ""Kitty""!)"
I:420;3312;Like his character in Signs, ALL of his lines are spoken with a trembling over.
I:420;3313;Manoj really DOES want to be like Spielberg!
I:420;3314;The cinematography and music are satisfying, making it half.
I:420;3315;I loved The Sixth Sense.
I:420;3316;it is UNACCEPTABLE in an M. Night movie.
I:420;3317;Bryce Dallas Howard gives a great performance.
I:420;3318;You're going to think about how many idiots didn't like Unbreakable and you loved it.
I:420;3319;How many folks that don't like Signs and you loved it.
I:420;3320;Many people are going into his movies with the single.
I:420;3321;In a sense Night reminds me of the guitarist Buckethead, whose genius shines through the presence of a KFC bucket turned upside.
I:420;3322;The first revelation, that the creatures .
I:420;3323;I immediately made a connection with these creatures and the myths of religion.
I:420;3324;History is full of efforts by well.
I:420;3325;intended groups of people to isolate themselves and their loved.
I:420;3326;"the second revelation (or ""twist"", if you must), which is that the film takes place in modern times, is almost entirely irrelevant and adds nothing of great importance."
I:420;3327;"It was a ""meh"" moment."
I:420;3328;Well, because one of the things this film is is a love story, and a triumphant one at that.
I:420;3329;"As anyone who has seen enough of Night's films knows, or should know, Love, with a capital ""L"", runs like a bright thread through all of them (at least the ones I've seen)."
I:420;3330;"Romantic love, familial love (the deceased mother and living daughter in Sixth Sense: two words to remind you of one of the most moving scenes in movie history: ""Every day""), and deep, spiritual love (with and without the religious connotations)."
I:420;3331;What's especially touching about Ivy's love for Lucius is the way she has to draw him out, to make him speak his feelings.
I:420;3332;She is the great strength in the community, despite being blind, and the scene on the porch where she gets Lucius to confess his love for her is one of the most satisfying scenes I've ever watched in any film.
I:420;3333;"She asks her son how he knows this, and he replies, ""Because he never touches you."""
I:420;3334;raising line and a magnificent reflection on what it's like to harbor feelings of love for someone and not be able to tell them, a feeling with which I am painfully familiar.
I:420;3335;Enter one of the other pivotal characters, Noah Percy.
I:420;3336;The world bows before love, in awe.
I:420;3337;To sum up, the Village is a film which offers many things to think about: is religion a good thing after all, can any utopian system actually work, is it a good idea to smother our loved ones in good intentions and keep them from living full, normal lives, and can love really save the day, when all is said and done?
I:420;3338;Thanks, Night, for this great and thought.
I:420;3339;put together love story with a few creepy events thrown in to keep you on the edge of your seats.
I:420;3340;Also, the score for this film (by James Newton Howard) is amazing.
I:420;3341;Bryce Howard gives an Oscar worthy performance.4 stars!
I:420;3342;"First of all, I found ""The Village"" to be more imaginative than far."
I:420;3343;Her romance with Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix) perfectly captures the film's essence of a simpler, more innocent time (i. e. the complete absense of homosexuality, murder, violence, and alcoholism), and her encounter with a wildlife officer from the civilised world reveals a girl who is mature yet vulnerable, beautiful yet antiquated, mannerly yet naive.
I:420;3344;I highly recommend this movie to anyone with an open mind who is looking for a suspensful film with subtle social messages.
I:420;3345;The oath is more important than his daughter's life?
I:420;3346;"M. Night Shymalan often makes these leaps of logic in his films, but this is one of those ""Oh, come on!"""
I:420;3347;But still, I enjoyed the movie.
I:420;3348;I didn't see the twist coming at the end, and as preposterous as it was, the movie held my interest until the end.
I:420;3349;"wow"", there was the plot twist."
I:420;3350;The fun of the film is to see if you can figure out theanswers before they are revealed, but that's not the only reason toappreciate it.
I:420;3351;Adrien Brody is effective as the detestable village idiot.
I:420;3352;director and writer M. Night Shyamalan portrays the locations with anaura of beauty and mystery.
I:420;3353;On top of this the score is fittinglyhaunting and beautiful.
I:420;3354;As such, the film is a feast for the eyes andears.
I:420;3355;The outsider questions the mysterious girl butultimately discerns that she is genuine.
I:420;3356;This is an extraordinary scene.
I:420;3357;"time best in cinema (much like themysterious Native American bar sequence in ""Wolfen"")."
I:420;3358;"revelation in Shyamalan's ""The Sixth Sense (Collector's Edition Series)"" wasoutstanding and arguably better than the the one in ""The Village"", Ipersonally prefer ""The Village"" overall."
I:420;3359;there are two main mysteries: (1.)
I:420;3360;The nature of the creatures in thewoods, and (2.)
I:420;3361;beyond all that, the film has a potent subtext.
I:420;3362;destroying socialist experiment known as Sweden.
I:420;3363;hearted and intelligent Ivy is ultimatelyseduced by power and welcomed into the inner.
I:420;3364;Safe from the outside world, of course.
I:420;3365;Murder is still a real possibility, and also with this seclusion comes the penalty of not being about to cure common physical ailments.
I:420;3366;`The Village' also has a `Shirley Jackson' feel and is reminiscent of her `The Lottery.'
I:420;3367;And, as far as I am concerned, Shyamalan best effort so far.
I:420;3368;Wait for it to come on cable and you'll thank me for it.
I:420;3369;the meetings of a group of authority figures resemble the form of church rulings.
I:420;3370;The movie also show that good.
I:420;3371;the director has handled the movie with all above elements and express it through conversations and actions and twists.
I:420;3372;The photography and the performance of the new star, Bryce Dallas Howard as Ivy, are absolutely great.
I:420;3373;give the same story to other directors, I am sure most likely most would prefer to treat it as essentially a drama and accordingly downplay the mysterious elements in the plot.
I:420;3374;the gothic atmosphere created in the first two thirds of the movie is great.
I:420;3375;Since nothing great, in terms of the revelation of the truth, is in store, and I cannot help wondering why the director seems totally happy to build up the audience's hope in the first place.
I:420;3376;Sixth Sense has most of its story independent of the movie's final surprise.
I:420;3377;But The Village, Unbreakable and to smaller extent Signs all have their stories orbit around their respective twists.
I:420;3378;with his tremendous craftsmanship in creating atmosphere and the movie's great cast, I believe The Village would have been a much better piece should Shyamalan have not sacrificed the focus on the dramatic elements in favor of the disappointingly empty mystery.
I:420;3379;In fact, I find myself enjoying the movie most in the last half hour of the movie after the twist has been revealed.
I:420;3380;Great love story with a little bit of suspense, excellent acting, Bryce Dallas Howard at her best, and an interesting plot concept.
I:420;3381;Gee, what a pleasant life to live, especially for the children.
I:420;3382;That's much more wholesome and peaceful than the regular world.
I:420;3383;The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and Signs are three terrific suspense/mystery flicks from director M. Night Shyamalan.
I:420;3384;overall, this is a suspenseful, mysterious film that will have you on the edge of your seat.
I:420;3385;You hope and pray, but again just another bait and switch.
