1;Armed with this knowledge it becomes fairly evident where the story is leading and it's probable end.
2;good performances throughout by the entire cast.
3;The film is powerful and all the actors give award.
4;still, I liked it because it is both very moving and has surprising plot twists.
5;riveted to the screen, I was witness to raw nature and circumstance
6;haunting one's days and nights for weeks and months to come.
7;Yes, by my troth I do live dangerously!
8;and Jack Jordan (Benicio Del Toro), a former convict become a born.
9;incidentally, is excellent as Jack's devoted and strong.
10;willed wife, who in one scene is worked up into a passion reminiscent of Shakespeare's Lady MacBeth).
11;It's the three leads, in fact, who turn out one of the most intense, outstanding dramatic performances by a cast I've ever seen.
12;They were riveting to watch.
13;The movie's shot with a sort of raw, gritty and real.
14;On the contrary, 21 GRAMS is a subtly beautiful, powerfully atmospheric, and hypnotically captivating work of art~
15;21 Grams was the best film I saw in 2004.
16;Naomi Watts is so talented, so good in every role she is in, she is remarkable to watch, she should have won the Oscar for her performance.
17;Sean Penn and Benicio Del Toro are fabulous as well.
18;It is amazing how three stangers lives could all change and be affected because of one horrifying event.
19;So I recommend both of them, but I suggest you to see the mexican one first.
20;It also connects them all in new and even tragic ways.
21;It's also much of the challenge, because .
22;like landscape with a gun in his hand.
23;Naomi Watts looked glamorous and stunning in Mulholland Drive.
24;chronological structure, the grungy cinematography, and the excellence of the performances, does cover what could easily be melodramatic excess.
25;the performances are a large part of what makes the film so stunning.
26;Several of them won awards at the 2003 Venice International Film Festival .
27;21 Grams also contains a powerful cameo from Clea DuVall as Christina's younger sister.
28;It's a gripping film and one with strong themes.
29;Well worth a viewing, but I warn you that it does demand active participation on the part of the viewer.
30;It includes an ensemble cast of very talented and gifted actors that only enhance the experience of watching the movie.
31;`21 Grams' may be his best film to date.
32;the film tells the complicated and heartrending story of a young woman named Christina who is drawn into the lives of two men after a tragic accident leaves her widowed.
33;One of those men is Paul, a professor in dire need of a heart transplant.
34;shifting back and forth within time, `21 Grams' weaves a delicate web of harsh realities that brings the audience to a dark place thriving with life.
35;The complexities are all held tightly within these three amazingly real characters, all of which come to life in vivid and mesmerizing ways.
36;I knew it wasn't perfect (not many films are), but it also had such a strong hold on my emotions that I was compelled to watch it again and again and again.
37;Every time I see this film I am rushed with more emotions, for it remains real and compelling every time.
38;Their struggles are so deeply felt, so richly realized.
39;It also shows the will we have to right the wrongs and redeem ourselves through the survival of others.
40;Watts, one of the greatest actresses of her generation (a few pegs shy of Kate Winslet), delivers a gut punch performance here.
41;She understands how to live within the character.
42;You can see her taking in every moment, and it helps create someone truly unforgettable.
43;Del Toro is one of the better actors working today.
44;This performance is most certainly his finest to date.
45;The way he drenches himself in his character determination, allowing his every fault to become his driving force
46;Sean Penn, an actor I find highly overrated, is very good here.
47;This performance is FAR better than his hammy Oscar winning one from the same year (how he one of `Mystic River' is beyond me).
48;the supporting cast is also magnificent here, especially the significant others played by Danny Huston, Melissa Leo and Charlotte Gainsbourg.
49;in the end I highly recommend this film.
50;It is an eternal downer at first glance, so be prepared to take your mood down a few notches, but the rich script allows for the emotions to display themselves in interesting and provoking ways, and this is definitely a film that will continue to provoke you to think, and glean.
51;save the superb acting performances of the three leads.
52;There is a lot of good films about human nature (and probably better than this one) out there, but go for it if you like great acting.
53;Naomi Watts, Sean Penn and Benicio Del Toro are great actors.
54;It is to the actors' credit (and the director's) that they do such poignant and expressive work.
55;Viewed: 4/04, 10/11Rate: 710/11: So.
56;And they succeeded by letting 21 Grams to have very little entertainment value.
57;OK, I really liked the content of the movie.
58;Watching a movie should be a relaxing, enjoyable activity, rather than something that rattles your brain as much as a tough crossword puzzle.
59;goofy sequencing aside, I really enjoyed the 3 main actors' performances.
60;This was quite a realistic movie.
61;I saw Amores Perros (Alejandro Gonz lez I rritu) when it first came out and I just thought it was a perfect film, it had this rough edge that seemed to just create the same affect to the audience and as soon as I heard that (Alejandro Gonz lez I rritu) was coming out with a new film I was just already on top of it.
62;The film hit's you from the minute it starts to the moment it finishes.
63;It's such a beautiful and powerful story with all the meaning it needs.
64;I've recommended it to so many and have all come back with positive reviews and sleepless nights.
65;So I recommend see it and if you like, recommend to everyone.
66;I applaud the director and writer once again for a beautiful job well done.
67;It's such a heavy and undescribable concept and when you finally reach to it it's incredible beacuse it's light as a feather but you don't want to let go (if it makes sense).
68;I enjoy Sean Penn and have always found his craft to be entertaining.
69;Get some really good actors who like juicy, serious roles.
70;i'm a huge fan of all the principal actors (Penn, Watts, del Toro) and they managed to overcome some of this film's problems.
71;Naomi Watts dominated the screen with a depth from her that I've never seen.
72;I suspect the producers figured the storyline was so weak, they had to do something to make the picture captivating.
73;Thematically, it's actually quite complex.
74;In addition to the idea of revenge, the movie explores the ideas of fate and how one's own fate can be tied up in the fates of others
75;the acting is uniformly solid.
76;an immensely stirring, emotional upheaval that takes the viewer through an amazing journey of souls.
77;The viewer becomes engrossed in the disparate but intertwining concerns of the central characters and is compelled to explore the intense dimensions of their psychologies.
78;this is a uniquely stimulating film that rivets and edifies.
79;It draws you into an intense vortex of emotions, tragedies and the occasional tinge of serendipity .
80;tons of great performances make it a must see and easily eclipse any complaints of uni.
81;Inarritu takes the idea of film making he used in Amores Perros and puts it to a story that should touch anyone that walks this earth.
82;Naomi Watts is stellar at times, but at other times it seemed that she was overacting.
83;Overall though the movie is one of the years ten best, which usually results in a pretty stellar film.
84;Thumbs up to Inarritu for being able to put such powerful emotions to the screen.
85;sean Penn is at the top of his game with this one.
86;He's consistent, and quickly draws you to his side, which is something many actors struggle with.
87;She's so good you'll be choked up a few times from her acting alone
88;I have often found his over.
89;(He must have found his character.
90;Great plot, three actors at their best, and an awesome way of editing the movie!I highly recommend 21 Grams!
91;You'll need to watch it without interruptions and be able to give it your undivided attention
92;for the ones who haven't seen Amores Perros, see the movie with full comfort.
93;A believer, who lived all his life as an alcoholic sinner and decided to devote himself to Gesus eventually
94;Now bring these three characters together in one film, connected by a car incident.
95;Benicio del Toro, Sean Penn, and Naomi Watts deliver perfect acting.
96;I believe this is one of the best movies of the year so far and I wouldn't be surprise if it doesn't get some kind of award.
97;The acting is superb from the three leading actors.
98;It is a movie that really makes you think about a lot of things.
99;Sean Penn is terrific, his character is very sick and is dying and his transformation is unreal.
100;con and a reborn Christian who is deeply religious and wants to help those around him do the same also gives a fantastic performance.
101;This film deserves to be remembered by the members of the Academy of Motion Pictures because it truly deserves to be recognized by the Hollywood elite as an amazing film with gripping performances from a fantastic cast of actors.
102;21 Grams is an outstanding example of a cinematic soap opera.
103;the performances in 21 GRAMS are the best you'll see.
104;These performances are what make the movie memorable and a cut above the rest.
105;You see the joy in their lives and in a flash, you see the dark side of their lives, the turmoil, the torn down and bared souls.
106;It jumps around the timeline of their lives, showing us their good sides before the events that destroy them and in a CUT, show the turmoiled people they will eventually become when the events all tie together, and then back again.
107;in favor of the movie, the scenes cut together nicely.
108;The scenes make you wonder, make you question, what caused this?
109;The scenes pose all the right questions and move the movie nicely.
110;The story could have just as easily been told in chronoligical order and held the exact same amount of weight and entertainment value.
111;21 Grams was definitely a film that I would classify as a Mover, which in the meaning means that this is a film that really moved me emotionally.
112;Great performances from some of the most underrated actors and actresses in the business today truly hoisted this film to a higher level.
113;Sean Penn, who is one of my guilty favs as an actor, I've loved him ever since Falcon and The Snowman, was truly brillant and full of life in front of the camera.
114;Naomi Watts, whom is also a good friend of Nicole Kidman's, is actually a lot more enjoyable to watch in film to me than Kidman.
115;I felt her pain through the entire film, and she was startling in every frame that she was in.
116;oozing with emotion that was thick enough to cut with a knife, well written, and acting that was truly astounding, this is truly a wonderful film, and a highly recommended film for those of you out there that appreciate movie making at its finest.
117;Both actors give wonderful heart felt performances, however it is Naomi Watts who really gives the heart wrenching, tortured performance as a mother who is grieving for her lost husband and daughters while falling back into old habits (drug additction).
118;The donor of the heart, the price of redemption and forgiveness moves the characters into obvious intwinement.
119;Director Alejandro Inarritu strikes gold with his amazing triumvirate of life experiences that merge to create the plot of 21 Grams .
120;the acting performances by the three major players were absolutely superb.
121;Her portrayal was unexpectedly magnificent and possibly more impressive than Charlize Theron's Oscar winning performance in Monster.
122;The movie is edited in a non.
123;and each of the many scenes is one tiny piece of a very big puzzle.
124;He is awaiting a transplant.
125;Naomi Watts plays a beautiful suburban mother, a former druggie and party girl, who now loves her family deeply.
126;the actors are all outstanding.
127;The three leads amaze you.
128;The supporting cast also boasts powerful performances.
129;Melissa Leo plays del Toro's wife, a Lady Macbeth in a trailer park.
130;still it is an outstanding movie.
131;I would recommend it to individuals who gravitate towards serious, thoughtful, art.
132;They shine, outshine even almost ever other performer of 2003.
133;Niomi Watts is dealing with a grave loss and Sean Penn is learning to live again, now that he
134;How much is a life worth?
135;Be sure to read a few reviews of this film: the complicated plot is told in a complex, non.
136;acting was earthly, in a great way, and the story was equally amazing.
137;i never thought that I'd like a movie that jumped back an fourth so much, but I loved this the most.
138;Something went off inside of his head and he decided to start really giving it to us, showing us once again that an actor can find himself well into his prime.
139;Benicio Del Toro is electrifying, as always, in his portrayal of a born.
140;Let's put it this way: I love non.
141;After the film was over, I just sat there and said, All right.
142;In the end, the acting is still tremendously strong in this film and I highly recommend it, if only to see Sean Penn in another brilliant performance of the year.
143;The producer of 2000's Amores Perros presents another film masterpiece.
144;time Oscar nominated 21 Grams explores deeper into his unique creativity.
145;Alejandro Gonzales Inarritu leads a talented cast and crew to complete this unforgettable experience.
146;Future and past events being placed in various places offer a more unique intimate look into the characters' lives.
147;The irony continually builds, keeping audiences paying attention to what actually happens and what actually is.
148;Few other writers have mastered this technique this well.
149;The drama builds as one tradegy adds to another.
150;The graphic scenery offer a deeper look at their inner death threats.
151;every actor offers their own sense of tradegy through their character and the film.
152;Naomi Watts and Benicio Del Toro are brilliant in their Oscar nominated roles (Best Actress, Best Supporting Actor).
153;This brings them into more intimate roles that earns them tremendous respect as talented actors.
154;Watts transforms her image for this role of a lifetime that explores her more serious side.
155;Sean Penn is outstanding in his role as a heart transplant patient.
156;He continues to evolve as an outstanding actor, expecially within the last ten years.
157;21 Grams is a great powerdrama for those looking for something intense.
158;This is sure to please audiences for many years to come.
159;Inarritu's Amores Perros is also recommended for fans of 21 Grams .
160;Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu is a new talent to be reckoned with.
161;The structure and editing of this film is so unique that it takes your breath away.
162;It's like fragments of a whole that seem to be random but come together at the end for a satisfying conclusion.
163;The acting in this film by the three principles is top.
164;I thought Sean Penn as the heart transplant recipient gave a better performance here than he did in Mystic River in which he won the Oscar.
165;Naomi Watts continues the stellar work that started with Mullholland Drive as the grieving widow.
166;I recommend this film highly, in particularly for the more ambitious film.
167;A deeply depressing movie, though I still enjoyed the performances a lot, especially Naomi's grief.
168;This is a good drama movie, but it jumps back and forth alot between the future and the present.
169;She has a husband who she loves very much and two lovely daughters.
170;He has two kids and a wife who loves him very much and doesnt like who he has turned into.
171;Its a good movie confusing at times but a heavy drama.
172;the film is not for the faint of the heart, for director Alejandro Gonz lez I rritu takes you, with his camera, to the darkest spots of humanity, but the acting is so incredibly strong and the screenwriting so sharp, you can't help but be entertained and enthralled by this definitive slice.
173;I give it 2 stars, one for cinematography and one for del Torro's spectacular performance.
174;He uses a technique being seen more and more in film, a technique in which the story is not told in chronological order, but temporally scattered.
175;At first it is disconcerting, then intriguing, and finally everything is abundantly clear.
176;And perhaps this heightens the cinematic experience.
177;Sean Penn is brilliant in an understated way as he projects (by turns) charm and tenderness, desperation and hope, and a kind of hopelessness headed for a flat line.
178;Naomi Watts is electrifying in the intensity she brings to the most emotionally.
179;She is one of the most amazing actresses working today, and if you haven't seen her, see her here.
180;She was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress (losing out to Charlize Theron in Monster).
181;He takes responsibility for his actions.
182;as far as the ending goes, note that Cristina is dressed in bright, almost happy colors because of what was discovered when she donated her type O. positive blood to save Paul's life.
183;Obviously I can't reveal what was discovered in a review, but I'm willing to bet some people found it redeeming and hopeful while others found it ironic while still others may have found it cheap and easy.
184;Sean Penn must have had a great year, acting.
185;wise, since this film and Mystic River netted him an Academy Award, a Golden Globes, and Best Actor by the National Board of Review (a poll by all the leading film critics in the country).
186;Watts and del Toro are also superb in their pivotal roles and the title itself refers to the weight applied to one's life when it begins!!
187;It is very interesting to be discovering little by little what is this film about.
188;One of the best actors of the beginning of the century.
189;Good actting in this dark tale.
190;The story is improbable but a good vehicle for the exploration of life and death issues.
191;It jumps around A LOT, and you will probably not fully understand where everything ties in until at least halfway through.
192;i know a lot of people liked this film, but these are two very strong factors you should consider before you spend your money or time on this one.
193;Heavy movie with the Pulp Fiction structure.
194;Very watchable for the performances.
195;A mathematician, a widow, and an ex.
196;To portray these characters, the powers that be recruited three of the finest film actors working today, as well as a talented director smart enough to get out of their way.
197;The result is (not surprisingly) a powerful, gripping film.
198;transplant patient who receives her husband's heart, and finds hiimself living with a strange combination of gratitude, guilt and terror.
199;Watching Watts, Penn, and Toro tackle these characters is truly magnificent, but also heartwrenching.
200;these characters showcase humanity at its most raw.
201;linear way their stories are told, but I thought it worked beautifully.
202;All in all, a terrific film.
203;I went and saw it with some family and the theater was an hour away from hour, and i was speechless the whole way back.
204;The film has an incredible ability to make you reflect on your own life and understand how fragile life can truly be.
205;On the one hand, it's wonderfully well.
206;Yes, there are supporting characters, but the film truly belongs, heart and soul, to the people played by Naomi Watts, Sean Penn, and Benicio Del Toro.
207;And they all do pretty freakin' phenomenal jobs of bringing these people to life.
208;And, while the events taking place on.
209;screen are quite interesting, the film is told out of sequence .
210;Many will posit this is due to the influence, and popularity, of Quentin Tarantino's work.
211;The difference is that Tarantino's movies, for all his chronology games, are quite easy to follow.
212;with the help of her family.
213;convict, now preaching the Gospel to others.
214;Some of his most powerful acting ever.
215;Naomi Watts turns in a solid performance as a grieving widow, who loses both her spouse and her two children.
216;caliber performance as a terminally ill math professor, whose own life is in termoil with a unhappy marriage.
217;All in all, '21 Grams' was shunned at the Oscars (Del Toro and Watts deserved their nominations, and above all deserved the Awards) for nominations in both Best Picture and Best Director (Alejandro Gonz lez I rritu) .
218;I loved this movie and highly recommend it to everyone who has yet to have seen it.
219;good movie, but strangely enough you'll find yourself thinking about it for days after having viewed it.
220;The beauty of this movie only begins with its way of addressing the un.
221;Is not grief the shadow sometimes drawn when the light of the spirit shines on the human existence?The disdain of the oppressive convention known as the time line that is one of the hallmarks of director Inarritu's work in this film is magnificent.
222;this movie is definitely worth owning.
223;It is a profound experience in art, philosophy, technique, love, loss, and life.
224;especially compared to the director's previous film, the instant classic Amores Perros (Love is a bitch).
225;linear chronology in his cinematic storytelling is perhaps at its most heightened in this powerful 2003 drama.
226;Indeed they have with a gritty, heartfelt look at three disparate lives brought together by a single twist of fate and how each copes uniquely with the aftermath.
227;Paul Rivers, an academic awaiting a donor for a life.
228;saving heart transplant, as his impatient, English.
229;There are a couple of sideline performances worth noting as well .
230;out look thanks to Rodrigo Prieto's atmospheric cinematography, but the most impressive achievement is the filmmakers' insightful presentation of complex, multi.
231;layered characters in ways that make these even their more unsavory actions understandable.
232;Slowly, patterns emerge, and a unifying vision of the story manifests.
233;All the main characters struggle to find meaning in life and tragedy, but assembling del Toro's story gives the strongest answer.
234;we find an interesting resonance between del Toro's evangelical faith in a God who controls every aspect of life and Penn's mathematical determinism.
235;in the end, it's a solid five.
236;Sean, Benicio, and Naomi shine through their parts.
237;it should have swept the Oscars.
238;The haunting score, the superior acting, the impeccable direction, the brutally human script, and unrivaled production set this movie head.
239;Melissa Leo's performance really shines, and seems to have been almost totally ignored in both the handing out of awards and in so many of the reviews of this theatrical and horribly manipulative movie.
240;Del Toro's story is the most interesting of the three as an ex.
241;These three characters all come colliding together in interesting ways, and it is truly a movie that makes you think.
242;There are some very rough edges of the film, with rough scenes to go along with it, but the film's intention and terrific acting make it one that I want to see again.
243;The movie starts at the middle.
244;end and jumps around so much that it has the feel of a Memento.
245;despite the film's failures, the acting is superb.
246;I especially liked Del Toro's character who plays an ex.
247;I bought this movie without seeing it on a hunch.
248;I have to say this movie was not amazing but it was darn good.
249;All the actors did a very good job including sean penn.
250;I would strongly recommend this movie to everybody.
251;He gave two of the best performances of the year in two of the year's best movies, Mystic River (for which he won the Best Actor Oscar) and 21 Grams.
252;I, personally, find it the better of the two.
253;The acting is uniformly excellent.
254;The leads give three big staggering performances that are incredibly moving.
255;Alejandro Inarritu does a solid job directing, giving the film a distinct look and feel that separates it from more mainstream fare.
256;He has the potential to be a major director and I can't wait to see what he's doing for his next film.
257;I also like the way that the structure makes the film a series of individual moments without concern for time.
258;i feel that 21 Grams is one of the best movies of 2003.
259;Anyone who is looking for a gripping, exhilarating, moving film experience need look no further.
260;This is a powerful film of real emotional substance.
261;If you appreciate real filmmaking with brilliant and honest acting, 21 Grams will be a riveting, unforgettable experience.
262;This film is so compelling to me that it's made its way to my top 10 list, and that's a difficult feat anymore.
263;I cannot even think of a movie to relate this to, since it stands on its own simple plot laced with fantastic acting, awe.
264;inspiring direction, and a powerful mess of film editing.
265;it method of drama, as well as the reverse sequence of events.
266;The fragmented editing takes away any cliche's but still provides a powerful impact in the pit of my stomach.
267;This is film has received a lot of heated discussion, so I think I'll keep it relatively short, for once.
268;Needless to say, their lives become intertwined afterward.
269;Honestly, it hasn't got much of a plot at all, really, but the three leads all provide stunning, moving performances.
270;Benicio Del Toro is the best of them as the bulky and tattooed born.
271;There are a number of scenes of his regret which are just just so sad and powerful.
272;Also, when she starts screaming her head off it's actually believable, both in the performance and the context, a rarity in the films I've seen.
273;Penn is the weakest of the leads, as Paul, but he's still excellent.
274;He still plays this basic role much of the time in the film, but he is slowly revealed as the film goes on, and proves to be a truly sympathetic individual at the end.
275;Still, I'll have to admit that most of my very favorite films manage to have a strong human element in them.
276;Some have complained about this, but I like the gritty look, particularly the colors.
277;It is pretty damn grainy at times, I'll admit, but again, I'm pretty sure that's how it's meant to be.
278;It's got a sad, stirring soundtrack as well, mostly used relatively sparingly.
279;With a film like this it's tough to really say why it works so well.
280;Still, it's very good, but I'd probably now bring it down to 4 stars, if I were allowed to do so.
281;Sean Penn, Naomi Watts, and Benicio Del Toro give great performances in this movie.
282;By showing us the ending in the middle of the movie removes all possible suspense.
283;These are the three best performances of the year.
284;Sean Penn is subdued and wonderfully weary as a heart transplant recipient.
285;Naomi Watts gives the best performance of her career as a grieving mother and wife turning to drugs to ease her pain.
286;Del Toro is great as a reformed convict.
287;Great movie would watch it again.
288;Actors very good in the movie love all the characters.
289;21 GRAMS is a film of such importance that attempting to review it is intimidating.
290;Once in a while a film appears that is a Benchmark, a film that is destined to alter the concept of moviemaking as an art form.
291;inarritu enlists the intelligence of his audience and what a partnership that creates!
292;Inarritu takes advantage of the fact that visual images can hold so much power that the story behind them seems secondary at the moment of viewing only to alert us to THINK as we see bits and pieces of history and result dangling from a mobile, ever in motion.
293;The ending is an intelligent, shocking surprise and one that alters the way you will view events and people after you leave the story behind.
294;inarritu has employed the gifted artists Sean Penn, Benecio Del Toro, and Naomi Watts and each of them gives the most potent performances of their careers to date.
295;It is impossible to single out the strongest one as each actor owns the full spectrum of each character and each performance seems to exude from their innermost core of their talent.
296;Each is powerful, subtle, sensitive, wholly credible and deeply moving.
297;The other cast members are very strong .
298;This is a VERY important film, so very much worth the work required from us the audience, and as with most things in life, the more we invest the more we gain.
299;excellent acting from Naomi Watts, Sean Penn and Benecio Del Toro though.
300;Strange tale about interwoven lives surrounding a heart transplant recipient works very well despite a super tragic incident which serves as the movie's centerpiece and garners the audience's attention and sympathy.
301;Sounds preposterous but it unfolds believably and becomes a genuine think piece that never resorts to heart bludgeoning measures, given the very emotional circumstances involved.
302;Damn, what a fine movie.
303;this is truly one of the most gritty,starkly realistic, and emotionally raw films I've seen in recent memory.
304;the plot is all twisted and keeps you on the edge of your seat,the acting is brilliant by the entire cast, and the end results are truly riveting.
305;and I mean that in the best way possible.
306;do NOT miss this moving,gritty,raw+real gem filled with some truly explosive scenes of wrenchingly intense acting.
307;21 grams is an underated gem with a splendid cast.
308;It is one of the best movies that I've ever seen and is also one of the most original.
309;It has a brilliant cast including Sean Penn, Benicio Del Torro and Naomi Watts.
310;The acting alone is worth the watch but the movie.
311;wow.21 grams is a deep movie and will require the watcher's full attention.
312;The movie is so original because it throws random scenes at the screen.
313;Now that's what is so original and genius about the movie.
314;it makes you open your mind and the scipt is brilliantly conceived.You will be scratching your head at times and be like what is going on?
315;because the movie's goal is to connect all of these scenes in the end.
316;It makes you watching till the wonderful conclusion.
317;there is no need in talking about the plot because that was something that I enjoyed discovering on my own during the movie.
318;the movie has cruel ironies a plenty and the movie is so powerful that you will be thinking about it for a while.
319;Everything in this movie has a message and a point so pay attention.21 grams is one of the best movies out there.
320;It is a must see and can be comapred to the movie Crash.
321;But 21 grams is a better movie for many reasons.
322;the scene where the boy is using the leaf blower is wonderfully done.
323;This way is much better and much more powerful.
324;So please watch this gem, one of the best movies out there, a must see.
325;You can read in a random order and the storytellnig is always perfect .
326;Another important point to remark is the poem that Penn tells Naomi is from a living venezuelan poet Montejo .
327;this is a detor film .
328;the love appears as a happy son from the deepest regions from the tragedy and almost wins.
329;The religion , the uncertainity about the life , the redemption , the memory , all that complicated puzzle is told with maestry , with poetic flowness , and accurate direction .
330;There are always challenging and twists of fate who amazes the viewer through all the story.
331;this film is a step ahead in 2003 and one of the best and intelligent films made in Hollywood.
332;we really expect that this couple of director and guionist keep working together , 'because they have shown a new road and new possibilities of cinema expression.
333;the film itself is quite good.
334;And if the film and dark story don't do it for you, the cast will.
335;The performances of the 3 stars are first rate.
336;Plus, I'm curious why Sean won an Oscar for it.
337;sean Penn has always and will always inspire me to be an actor.
338;So effortlessly does he embody his character, that it takes a while to adjust to him from film to film, whilst you believe that he is still such and such a character.
339;His first round match up with Naomi Watts here is a great choice.
340;innocent villain and in my opinion you've got a great cast.
341;the imaginative script comes from a great novel.
342;It weaves through time reminiscent of Memento and more recently Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (which I highly recommend!)
343;Otherwise, enjoy these thought provoking films while they still exist.
344;I know this movie has great acting.
345;I wanted to enjoy this movie and its actors.
346;guessing that the director was soon going to reveal the main theme.
347;The movie is a dramatic well.
348;He is a Born Again Christian who will go through his own spiritual hell following the tragedy.
349;Melissa Leo gives an outstanding performance as Jack's long suffering, loyal wife.
350;He finally receives a heart and Christina's husband is the donor.
351;to call this film intense is an understatement.
352;Yet Mexican writer/director team Guillermo Arriaga and Alejandro Gonz lez I rritu, (Amores Perros), have put together an extremely powerful, compelling, character.
353;driven tale and the performances are brilliant, as one would expect from such a superb ensemble cast.
354;I adjusted fairly easily to the movie's collage.
355;I actually found it to be somewhat poetic, but I won't give it away.
356;This is worth seeing for the acting alone .
357;21 Grams provides a chilling experience of love, loss, revenge, and deceit.
358;the acting is superb and the lessons to be learned from this film must not go overlooked.
359;I will tell you that this is an Oscar calibur movie with Oscar calibur actors.
360;That's the way this incredible movie is told.
361;A math teacher (Sean Penn), a born again social worker (a haggard.
362;suffering wife) and others turn in stunning performances.
363;a stunning movie of great art, heart and subtlety.
364;the structure and the performances are engaging, and certain scenes are moving, but when you put the shattered pieces together, the whole isn't quite right.
365;This is one of those films that causes you to become more and more aware of the writer and director as you watch it, which costs you your suspicion of disbelief
366;it not only seems to be inspired by Heart, a little known European film that is much better (sharper, cleaner, more believable, and ultimately much more emmotinally disturbing) , but it seems to steal outright from it.
367;This amazing movie isn't told in a linear fashion, and there is a complex series of interwoven plot threads that come together at the end.
368;The grittiness of the film is reflected in the cinematography.
369;Enjoy this examination of human lives and be prepared for some hefty plot twists.
370;Her life has become more stable as her attention is directed towards the welfare of her family.
371;A car crash involving Jack, an ex.
372;The acting is fantastic, and I have to disagree with some viewers' about it being hopeless: the subtext about Penn and his warning shot at the end, which brings everything together, is what brings salvation.
373;It is gritty and true to real life, almost uncomfortably so.you'd think you were watching a documentary with amazingly sincere people at times.
374;this ranks among one of the best films I've seen to emerge in this decade.
375;and for those reviewers who took the time to explain the structure (convoluted as it is), and point out the amazing and thought.
376;provoking performances in this film .
377;this movie is as perfect a metaphor for life as I have ever seen.
378;Much like the characters in this film, we are caught in that web.
379;We question our selves and our God, and in the end, life goes on without us.
380;This is the kind of film that we so rarely see these days.
381;One that mirrors each of us in some way
382;The movie kept me guessing.
383;Sean Penn is a great actor and proves it again in this film.
384;talented people (see the difference between Amorres Perros and this movie and you will be horrified at how virtually every talented director eventually sells out to these cons).
385;There are fantastic acting performances, and layers of detail, but the structure of the film is what presents the challenge.
386;He has become a Christian, but still struggles with his anger.
387;We see the film play out and we are (or at least I was) working to figure out how everything fits together both as a part of the story as well as to the greater theme of the movie.
388;The film, in my view, is trying to measure a human life, to see what it means to be human, especially in the face of death.
389;On one hand, the film succeeds.
390;This is a good one, even a very good movie.
391;The acting is great, but I'm not sure if the movie is.
392;I hate those reviews of eclectic films that not only gush about how great the picture was, but take the time to belittle anyone who doesn't 'get it.
393;'This is one of those films.
394;And of course, the acting is superb.
395;so even when I did feel rather confused about what was going on, I could at least enjoy the performances.
396;Naomi Watts is a very happily married mother of two young girls, and Benicio del Toro (who won an Oscar for his role), plays a born.
397;but in the end, I thought that sometimes being able to see a little bit (and sometimes quite far) into the future, made for a fascinating film.
398;Alejandro Inarritu,'s 21 Grams is one of the best films of the year.
399;21 Grams is an intimate meditation on life and death, love and vengeance, directed with intelligence and grace by Inarritu.
400;It also boasts some of the best film acting you'll ever see in one movie.
401;For almost the entire film, Inarritu keeps you guessing about what brings these three people into the same room together, and that is one reason why 21 Grams is so effective.
402;It forces you to get involved in the film, investing deeply into the story and the characters.
403;Sean Penn excels at playing a faithless college professor who is dying and needs a heart transplant.
404;Naomi Watts would have won an Oscar for her performance as a drug.
405;Benecio Del Toro is also outstanding in his portrayal of a born.
406;down man, and it shows in the way he carries his body.
407;excellent supporting performances are given by Melissa Leo and Charlotte Gainsborough as the wives of Del Toro and Penn.
408;21 Grams also features exquisite cinematography.
409;It really is breathtakingly beautiful, especially the very first shot of Sean Penn and Naomi Watts.
410;i highly recommend 21 Grams.
411;It is a brilliantly conceived film, featuring skilled direction and explosive acting from all involved.
412;Not a big moneymaker on its initial release, hopefully now it will find the audience it richly deserves.
413;21 Grams is one of the best films of 2003 and has some of the best acting.
414;while Jack is a born again convict who just made a big mistake.
415;through the story all of their lives are intertwined marvelously and sometimes confusingly.
416;everyone in the film gives some performances of their careers including Naomi Watts whose performance is unforgettable.
417;one of the best films of 2003,go see 21 Grams .
418;It's fascinating to watch the movie unfold.
419;top acting and a story that jumps all over the place.
420;Benicio Del Toro was great, but he is great in everything so it was no surprise that he did a great job in his role.
421;I didn't enjoy this film and was very happy when it was over.
422;story lines overlapping, backing up, coming at you from the past (or the future .
423;sean Penn is riveting, as usual.
424;i'm not sure this is the kind of movie I'll be able to watch again.
425;the acting is some of the most engrossing performances i have seen to date.
426;sean Penn dazzles us once again with a truly gritty and emotionally draining effort as the ailing Math Professor who recieves a 2nd chance at life.
427;convict, who finds God, only to question his own faith and morals that really stays in your mind long after this cut and paste account of 3 interweaving lives is over.
428;if cinema is art, heres the proof.
429;I found it incredibly deep and poingant, and it quickly became one of my favorite movies of all time.
430;penn and Watts are both seeking reaffirmation of life, and find this in eachother.
431;They share love, grief, death, and ultimately life again.
432;In the end, life must go on for those left behind.
433;the main characters are beautifully acted, and fans of Watts, Penn, and Del Toro will not be disappointed.
434;Overall a good to very good movie for mature audiences.
435;The performances were all Oscar caliber, probably career making for all 3 of the main stars.
436;I have to say this is one of the best dramitic movies I will ever see.
437;This movie is on the most well.
438;done movie I have ever seen with breatless cinematography.
439;It was very intense at many parts and is very unique.
440;The third person, Christina (Naomi Watts) leads a regular life in the suburbs with a husband and 2 little daughters.
441;The guy and 2 kids are the family of Christina (Watts).
442;Paul (Penn) gets the heart of the guy run over and that ends up saving his life and allowing him to live longer.
443;A lot of stuff happens in the movie and the scenes are very powerful, riveting, and intense.
444;The more I think about 21 GRAMS the more I start to dislike it.
445;all we get is 21 Grams is the weight of the soul.
446;just cut a few notes and I'm sure it will be just perfect!
447;Listen to the King Alejandro!CRASH, TRAFFIC and MEMENTO do all of this better!This film has all the markings of a truly great film.
448;I best stop now, because a feel another star falling!
449;alejandro Narritu is clearly influenced by both of these directors.
450;I can only say 21 Grams can be enjoyed for the performances.
451;He is still a relative newcomer at and can do very well.
452;21 Grams was the best film I have seen in a long time.
453;forwards, but it is incredible to see the scenes come together like a jigsaw puzzle.
454;An intense and emotional film that really makes you wonder How much revenge, love, and guilt weigh?
455;The rich housewife Cristina Peck (Naomi Watts) is a recovering cocaine addict with a wonderful family that she loves above all as she fills her days with rehab meetings and swimming.
456;Despite the similarities in 21 Grams and Amores Perros, I rritu rejuvenates the idea and displays outstanding directorial skills as he offers the audience an innovative cinematic experience.21 Grams is told in a fragmented storyline which encourages the audience to ponder the theme and messages of the film.
457;class editing as it, at an initial glance, seems erratic and difficult to follow, but as the storyline jumps back and forth it offers small glimpses of recollection that encourages thoughtful interaction with the film.
458;scene, and editing are outstanding as they elevate the emotional turmoil that the characters are experiencing.
459;All the cinematic aspects of making a film are brought together by I rritu and he offers the world a brilliant cinematic experience.
460;It's intensely complex with deeply interwoven plot lines that automagically come together.
461;Sean Pean and Naomi Watts are absolutely brilliant.
462;no hollywood ending, but a real, raw, human ending.
463;First, the lead actress is Naomi Watts, who never really has impressed me, despite the award nominations that she has received.
464;Plus in the film trailers I got the impression this was more a spiritual/super.
465;But in reality, it is a very well done mystery and romance story.
466;sean Penn shines, as he usually does, as the mathematician who receives a heart transplant from Watts' husband, who along with their two daughters are run down by a truck driven by Benecio del Toro.
467;It's a complex story that is well acted (even by Ms. Watts, I have to say) and well told.
468;Something extraordinary happened about a third of the way into the film, once the three main characters.
469;I found myself intrigued with the way the story was told.
470;linear plot made it so much more haunting once I actually realized what was actually going on and was able to put it together.
471;to summarize, I thought this was one of the most heartbreaking but strangely beautiful movies I've seen in a long time.
472;Great movie, not going to ruin it for everyone.
473;Consider the college professor with the bum heart and clingy wife, the ex.
474;drug addict with a wonderful husband and two cute kids, and the ex.
475;much like our own lives are undeniably interlaced with the lives of those around us.
476;showing us both the positive and negative ripple effects of one person's action on others and how each person deals with that respectively
477;This film has several good things going for it.
478;First, it has a good story.
479;Second, it has really fine actors.
480;Third, it has a director who has made a name for himself with cutting edge techniques.
481;maybe it works for some people.
482;It was the cutting edge techniques part that played around with the time frame of events that I found difficult to enjoy.
483;but we can all see he is trying to go straight and lead a good life.
484;His wife, played by Melissa Leo is also great.
485;a series of seemingly unrelated events brings all of these people's lives together.
486;The result is high drama.
487;film buffs should see 21 Grams and, for that reason I'm glad I saw it.
488;As I've said before, the performances are great and it's interesting to see new film techniques.
489;The acting was great and the story line raw.
490;Go see this and I know you'll enjoy it.
491;21 grams is the kind of movie that makes you contemplate your own life and existence, and forces you to ponder the the meaning and interconnectedness of life itself.
492;The really unique thing about the movie I felt was the way in which it was shot.
493;For me this served two purposes: one it kept the movie very interesting and in deed captivating from begining to end (the movie would probably have felt more slow and dry if done traditionaly), two it almost seems like a metaphor for life.
494;This really was fantastic I thought and very effective.
495;the emotional impact is also extremely noteworthy.
496;Grief is one of the prime components of the film and the examination of how every action in the world bares a reaction.
497;Anyone who has experienced pain and loss will relate in a most personal way.
498;the acting for this film was also excellent throughout.
499;The whole cast did a great job, and the performances are not just believable but inspired.
500;if you're the type of person who likes phillosophy, or enjoys a well.
501;done artistic movie about life that really makes you think, then this movie is for you.
502;The backwards technique worked in Memento because it fit the circumstances of the plot, but in 21 Grams it seemed like a gimmick and interfered with my enjoyment of the film.
503;And, wow, does she know how to do passionate kissing scenes.
504;The film bears the weaknesses of an internationalized director who has a bad ear for American dialog, how it should it be delivered, and the casting choices necessary to make sure it gets spoken by the right actors.
505;The actors give fine performances, but the movie is hard to watch .
506;the three main characters played by Sean Penn, Benicio Del Toro and Naomi Watts are constantly striving to overcome addictions and life hardships.
507;Just putting the thrashing scenes and pieces of their lives together makes one dizzy.
508;I really enjoy this movie.
509;Not the usual type of movie but 21 Grams is so moving I feel like watching it again and again.
510;So much things happening and keeps me guessing what has happened and how it will turn out to be.
511;I highly recommend to someone that likes drama and looking for good interlocking lives genre.
512;I spend a good proportion of this film being a little confused .
513;In fact so good that I thought the director was the same guy who did 'Vanilla Sky' .
514;I was surprised by Naomi Watts performance, she managed to accuratly portray the depth her character required.
515;This is definatly a film to watch twice, the first time just go along for the ride, the second surch for the clues.
516;I thought it was a great film that was well scripted and filmed, and expertly cut together.
517;I think in this movie in particular it works well, because it is dealing with the most traumatic event a wife and mother can be asked to deal with .
518;while definatly not a feel good film, it is a great way to spend a few hours .
519;This is a riveting, unsettling and thought provoking movie.
520;All three main characters, especially Naomi Watts, gives superb, very honest, bold performances, letting out a lot of raw and powerful emotions.
521;This movie is a must see for anyone who is facing grief and loss issues.
522;The title has more to do with life than with drugs.
523;The acting was good, though.
524;as much as I loved the cinematography, the performances of the three leads and the overall feel of the movie (much assisted too by Gustavo Santaolalla's magical musical touch), and as much as I am into non.
525;all in all, a good movie, but far from Amores Perros, I rritu's cinematic accomplishment to date.
526;I give it three stars mostly for the performances and the movie's overall feel.
527;up past coupled to a temptation.
528;mexican Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu had made the brilliant Amos Perres in 2000 and it went a long way to drawing in huge talent like Sean Penn, Naomi Watts and especially Benicio Del Toro (as Jack Jordan).
529;but it brilliantly unfolds the story so you slowly twig what's happened and to whom.
530;One minute Jack Jordan is clean.
531;in between all of this we keep returning to a father (a brilliantly subtle Danny Huston) on his mobile to his wife.
532;The only other times I've ever seen this sheer acting power is in Bright Star about the life of poet John Keats and Fanny Brawne that has Abbie Cornish give the same kind of mind.
533;there's also a great In Fragments Making Of where the Director gets all the cast and crew to throw red roses in the air at the start of shooting and white roses when they finish.
534;Each of the principal actors get spots and they're praise and love of the work is palatable.
535;Icing on the cake is Gustavo Santaoialla's stunning score of electric and acoustic heavy guitar strums (like a Mexican Ry Cooder).
536;Gustavo also embellished Babel and The Motorcycle Diaries with the same emotion.
537;in 2014 you can pick up the stunning 21 Grams for 10 bucks on BLU RAY .
538;spot well spent in my book.
539;21 Grams is a film of undeniable artistry and fine performances.
540;God knows, I've thought about it .
541;Love doesn't save the characters, faith deserts them, repentence and good deeds go unrewarded.
542;Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu has made a bold film in an innovative style.
543;Naomi Watts gives the best performance I've seen yet from this talented actress as a woman who is happily married to an architect with whom she shares two daughters, but we also see that in her past she did more than dabble in drugs.
544;Benicio Del Toro is heartbreakingly good as a man who has lived a hard life and done some hard time before being saved, in the Christian sense.
545;it's a worthwhile way to spend 2 hours if you want to see strong acting, bravura film.
546;21 Grams is a tense, gripping, and disturbing film full of twists and surprises.
547;In itself, it provides an upfront guarantee of satisfaction and weaves a spellbinding and suspenseful mystery.
548;The wonderful Sean Penn leads the all.
549;star cast, who all deliver possibly the finest performances of their careers.
550;Guillermo Arriaga writes this intelligent story with the intent to captivate his audience, which he does, and at the same time touch them, which he also does.
551;The film is greatly benefited from the award.
552;nominated acting and the superb direction.
553;21 Grams is a profound piece of cinematic art and is highly recommended.
554;This is a superb drama and one not to be missed.
555;Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu accomplishes this great task with the help of immensely talented actors like Naomi Watts, Sean Penn and Benicio Del Toro.
556;Penn excels in subtly as the man who receives Watts deceased husbands heart and falls in love with her.
557;The film is actually amazingly interesting in its ability to keep scenes tight and emotions as raw as possible.
558;It is a rare achievement and this film would have received more accolades if the material were simply more upbeat.
559;In that sense it reminded me of the movie Memento.
560;Once you get the hang of what's in the present vs. what is in the past, you become so immersed in the movie .
561;It is very suspenseful as well as very touching and gut.
562;When you finish watching this movie you'll sit in wrapped silence .
563;though this may be a little too intense for some sensitive souls, I highly recommend this movie.
564;It's extremely well acted, the story line is very well presented, and complete engrossing.
565;Film and video are the most powerful media tools ever created.
566;21 Grams is a force to be reckoned with.
567;Watching it will not entertain you as much as it will shake you up mentally and emotionally.
568;It is a brilliant example of the power a movie is capable of producing.
569;the plot moves forward and backwards in time, but I found it very easy to follow.
570;His investigation leads to the amazing intersection of the three characters' lives.
571;He explored a similar theme in his brilliant and highly recommended Amores Peros.
572;[Note: Mexico produces some of the best movies on the planet.]
573;Penn and del Toro, as well as supporting players Charlotte Gainsborough and Melissa Leo, are brilliant.
574;Penn's performance rivals the one he gave in Mystic River.
575;Watts, however, is the real star of the picture.
576;Whatever is beyond brilliant is what she is here.
577;Hers is one of the greatest performances ever recorded on film.
578;This is a hard film to see and understand, nevertheless is outstanding and deserves to be seen.
579;film director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu has developed a complex, tasty and compromised film d'art.
580;Tragedy and fate reunite all these elements into a griping tale.
581;main actress and actors in the film perform greatly.
582;last but not least, Naomi Watts, as the widow of the donor, gives a performance full of subtleties.
583;this picture is tasty dish for movie fans.
584;If you are a young actor, or just love a well acted movie, you must check this film out.
585;I cannot recall a movie were there were so many standout performances.
586;As always, Sean Penn displays his usual nearly supernatural talent.
587;Penn can do more with his eyes and expression than any actor I can think of, and his capacity for effective understatement is unparalleled.
588;He can simply move the viewer wherever he wishes them to go effortlessly, and he is always a marvel to watch.
589;Benicio Del Toro is tremendous as well, doing what he does best .
590;Naomi Watts is asked to carry a great deal of weight in this picture, and her raw pain and emotion really had me twisting in my seat in sympathy.
591;She actually accomplished that rare feat that happens so seldom in movies: Her pain and grief didn't seem like acting at all .
592;My favorite piece of work, however, came from Charlotte Gainsbourg.
593;With all the bigger names doing such great work around her, it is an easy role to overlook.
594;Ms. Gainsbourg is not a fashion model, nor is she beautiful in a high.
595;She is, instead, beautiful to watch because of her talent.
596;to tell you the truth, this type of character.
597;I like a good crime or action picture, big.
598;as far as impact is concerned, the film (along with House of Sand and Fog) is simply the best I have seen in years.
599;the real gift, however, this film offers is acting masterclass.
600;sean Penn has worked on Paul's character so deeply, that every word he utters feels perfect.
601;Benicio Del Toro, a chameleon like actor creates tremendous emotional weight by simply being in the scene.
602;Naomi Watts is a revelation.
603;Ms. Watts is as great an actress as they come.
604;Watching the film makes the audience uncomfortable, and forces them to dive into the dance of life and death, a filmic dance more beautiful and mysterious than we could have ever imagined.
605;He finds Watts and soon he becomes a part of her life.
606;A gripping, powerfully in your face drama about 3 people who are connected to one thing.
607;Dizzingly chaotic, compellingly acted, and masterfully directed, 21 GRAMS is not a movie that will make you feel happy.
608;naomi Watts is brilliant as Christina, an addicted housewife who loses her husband and two daughters in a hit and run accident.
609;benicio del Toro gives a fine performance as the driver of the truck, an alcoholic ex.
610;con who is now a born again Christian, trying to reform his life.
611;melissa Leo is excellent as his desperate wife, trying to get him to put her and his children first.
612;sean Penn, who was marvelous in MYSTIC RIVER, is even more so in this film, for which he should have received the Oscar.
613;Maybe he got it because he was so good in both movies.
614;Penn's obsession with finding out his donor's name leads to an involvement with Watts that is both poignant and tragic.
615;But it is a tremendous performance.
616;Brilliant portrayal of grief and how people deal with its impact.
617;Sean Penn gives his usual transcendent performance along with outstanding efforts by Watts and Del Toro.
618;Told out of sequence, the tale will grab you from the beginning and as it unfolds you find yourself becoming more and more engrossed.
619;Without a doubt, one of the best films of the year with no defects or weak points.
620;I haven't seen this movie at all but it did come to me in very good condition.
621;21 Grams is a movie of overwhelming power and drama, told in a compelling fashion by director Inarritu.
622;like storytelling technique used in this film, but it works flawlessly.
623;meal manner, lends extraordinary suspense to the film
624;I never knew she could do something like this, and she will surpass your every expectation.
625;sean Penn gave the two best performances of the year, here and Mystic River .
626;They're both career performances, in a career full of them.
627;He's making a strong case for being our greatest living actor.
628;and ending up in 2003 with those two films mentioned above.
629;I was far better than I thought it was going to be.
630;It's the type of movie you want every person who enjoys film and filmmaking to see.
631;set aside a night to watch this, I implore you.
632;If youv'e read this far, this is the type of movie for you.
633;That is the basic plot right there.
634;Do not get me wrong
635;Just take his BMW film Powder Keg for example, but a repeat of one's work is still a repeat of one's work.
636;I must say that this was an amazing film.
637;One of my favorites in recent years.
638;Sean Penn gives his best performance in this film.
639;But, it's fairly easy for that to happen.
640;I think it was a great job of editing.
641;But, this method helps the viewer understand the motivations of the characters.
642;It's a great interplay of emotions.
643;21 Grams came to UK shores with a bundle of critical acclaim and and an Oscar nomination for Sean Penn.
644;And it pretty much lives up to the good things people have been saying about it.
645;For anyone's who's seen the Australian movie Lantana, this will certainly ring a few bells.
646;what makes the movie though, besides the almost poetic direction, are the performances.
647;Sean Penn got a lot of credit for his role and deservedly so, though the rest of the cast also give nuanced and complex performances.
648;Benicio del Toro is superb as the heavy.
649;any other year, 21 Grams would have probably sweeped the Oscars, were it not for the phenomenal success and achievement Peter Jackson demonstrated with The Return Of The King.
650;Whilst it's true to say that in hindsight it's not really as good as it would perhaps like to be, nor as original, it's still a brilliant movie in its own right and one that any fan of intelligent, adult cinema should try to see.
651;But right from the beginning, during the intro, when you get a flash of Rivers and Watts together in bed, you know their paths will cross.
652;Rivers boots his girlfriend and manages to meet and gain Peck's trust.
653;A rattled, guilt ridden Jordan gets released from jail and leaves his family and rejects his faith.
654;conclusionEven with the unconventional method of story telling in the film, it conveyed the emotion, no it tranferred the emotion to me.
655;Though it is probably fiction, it brings tears to my eyes as I write about it, as I can empathize with the characters.
656;Sean Penn's part, while not as emotional was equally well delivered.
657;It's proposed to be the weight of the human soul!
658;if you want a feel good movie with a happy ending don`t watch this one it will leave you feeling thoroughly depressed but in a reflective `what`s life all about kinda way`.
659;this jumps around in time, like Memento.
660;The story line reveal itself by a series of multiple flashes that all add up to make a very compelling cinematic experience.
661;We keep hearing about great actors with great performances, but mostly these scenes look straight out of method acting classes in New York City: highly melodramatic, hyper serious one.
662;Penn's subtle turn is one of his most masterful (he was the only one of the three who weren't nominated for an Oscar for this film, but he took home a Best Actor award for Mystic River the same year), while Watts gives a wonderful and emotional tour de force, and Del Toro is simply brilliant.
663;faceted as it thinks it is, but the film still manages to be something special based on the performances of the three leads alone, and they alone are worth seeing the film for.
664;I waited for months before it arrived here, and i can tell you that it was definitely worth the wait.
665;so if it made it to cinema in your part of the world, dont miss the chance to see a modern masterpiece.
666;Inarritu is undoubtedly one of the more bold directors to emerge from Europe and sneak into Hollywood.
667;In terms of cinematography, it is surely one of the more 'beautiful' films shot on camera, and its ironic how it contrasts with the temperature of the film's narrative weight.
668;A brilliant film that commands respect, attention and the eyes of Hollywood.
669;Take the time to appreciate a truly inspiring work of art.
670;the acting is fantastic, and the movie's theme remains dark and chaotic.
671;The first ten or 15 minutes of this movie will make absolutely no sense, so stick with it, and everything will unfold magically in front of you.
672;Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's '21 Grams' I personally found to be an immensely satisfying experience.
673;linear sense of structure that I found to be really refreshing.
674;D in it's structure while jumping around between three stories whereas 21 Grams has an A .
675;By using this method Inarritu manages to create memories that are carried with the characters through the film instead of using a dreaded flashback sequences.
676;what really impressed me though was the acting.
677;Sean Penn (Dead Man Walking
678;Benicio del Toro (Traffic, Usual Suspects, Sin City) and Naomi Watts (Mullholland Drive) are both quite brilliant delivering impressive performances also.
679;If you like this then you may also enjoy director Wong.
680;kai Wai's films, which I believe to be greater.
681;I had a little trouble following this one at first, but once I got into it I was hooked.
682;It was so real (like Traffic) but so personal.
683;Watts really was strong here, but so was the rest of the cast (Penn etc).
684;21 grams is a movie that tells us what life really means, or I should say how much the notion of being alive occupies in your bodies.
685;This movie is highly recommended to those who like drama and have been searching for the meaning of life.
686;This film has a rather unique plot arrangement with strong acting but all converge upon a non.
687;benicio Del Torro delivers a moving performance as a penitent ex.
688;if you have to see this film, see it on video.
689;There's nothing about this film that makes it worth seeing at the movie theater for $9
690;I love films that have separate lives that are mixed together, and this one does exactly that.
691;good popcorn movies fill our cinematic diet.
692;Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's film however, takes a vacation from that format, asking us to confront the coincidences and tragedies of real everyday life.
693;benicio Del Toro and Naomi Watts in particular are outstanding, while Sean Penn does admirably in his role as a well.
694;meaning compassionate man whose own life is in flux.
695;Inarritu's cameraman, Rodrigo Prieto is instrumental to the pulse of this somber, thrilling, intimate and unforgettable work.
696;There are some moments in the film that will make you laugh even though the director did not intend it.
697;Some scenes come out of the blue that honestly do to match the storyline.
698;There are moments that will try your patients and you will shake your head about what all the fuss was over.
699;Yes we know she can crack up and throw out a performance when asked for it.
700;off experimentation, interesting characters and acting but not really a good film (or a film at all) by any means.
701;sean Penn, Benicio Del Toro and Naomi Watts give their best to a movie that shows the down.
702;Yes, it is a thought.
703;provoking movie with some very emotional and touching moments, but there is no reward in the end.
704;But it is a powerful one.4.
705;But I can say that its about three main characters.
706;convict that got saved, and has turned his life over to Jesus.
707;There are two crucial moments in the movie.
708;But they dance around the two crucial moments, making you piece it together for yourself before you actually see it.6.
709;The utter fragmentation of the films story bothers some people.
710;But I thought it was brilliant.
711;Guillermo Arriaga wrote the movie (he also wrote Amores Perros), and he has an almost supernatural ability to capture the intimate details of love and death, shining darkly between the lines of dialogue.8.
712;over and against I rritu's spiritual subtext, which gives the movie its title and which buzzes insistently beneath the main events and performances.
713;Woody Allen's Crimes and Misdemeanors comes to mind .
714;before the first hour is out, the main narrative lines have clarified, ambiguities begin to sort themselves out, and, abetted by chance, Paul has manipulated the story into an intense tale of odd obsession.
715;The irregular narrative strategy also provides an element of mystery, and the story remains intriguing and unpredictable right through an ultimately well.
716;the accomplished cast delivers performances that are among the best of their careers.
717;dimensional interpretations of complex human beings as they are sucked through the defining, harrowing, moments of their lives.
718;Del Toro continues to challenge himself, and amaze us, in each of his distinctive, shaded performances.
719;Even so, this is a very brave piece of writing, direction, and performance .
720;21 Grams is not a picture for every taste, but it is a strong, challenging antidote to the mass of pulp that passes for popular cinema.
721;where I've settled is that this is a very good film .
722;but it is a very good film nevertheless.
723;when I first started watching I was intrigued and curious .
724;leaving the weird editing to one side for a moment, there is a lot that I liked about this film .
725;the performances are outstanding (Naomi Watts in particularly is superb)
726;The unconventional chronology certainly involves the viewer in the story.
727;rate and it's good to see three top.
728;one of the most striking lines in the movie, which by the way has outstanding script, is when Jack's wife confronts him in jail after he has turned himself in for the hit and run.
729;Marianne is upset that Jack's newfound relationship with Christ has led him to turn away from his family, and she confronts him with an overwhelmingly pungent line of Life has to go on Jack.
730;All three characters are fighting a battle that is both emotionally draining and morally challenging.
731;But the guilt Jack has comes from his own lack of love for his family, for God, and for the family he killed.
732;The hope of the story lies in the future children in each family, and as Mary Rivers is looking for generational healing, so too are Jack and Cristina.
733;this film is beautifully shot, well scripted, and superbly acted.
734;All three performances deserved an Oscar.
735;Then the story actually starts to piece itself together, and it was a pretty rewarding experience.
736;Really good acting by Penn, Del Toro, and Watts.
737;As everyone seems to agree, the acting in 21 Grams is phenomenal.
738;But most truly great films aren't great just because of their value as diversions.
739;Anyone who's seen a Kubrick film knows that the director wasn't always concerned merely with entertaining his viewer.
740;Watts plays a woman with a sketchy past who has come out on top, married a great guy, and given birth to 2 lovely little girls.
741;Their lives intersect around a tragedy, and high art/high drama are the result when the three of them meet.
742;It is a perfect film for sycophantic movie goers that wear black clothes all the time and smoke Gitane cigarettes, and they also happen to be film majors at Univesity.
743;This movie really did captivate you from the beginning till the end.
744;On the screen, those magnificent actors and actress in the form of Benicio, Sean and Naomi were superb.
745;Their performances were compelling and that's probably what made 21 Gram so watchable.
746;blah, blah, blah, so what.
747;As others have said there is some decent acting here, especially by Naomi Watts so I'll offer two stars for that, otherwise this is just another average flick.
748;Mr. Inarritu's 21 Grams is a moving and spellbinding drama that finds the director tackling similar ground as he did in his last film Amores Perros when a car accident is the center of the story.
749;He also once again tells his story through a non.
750;linear format, that allows us, the viewers, to know some clues to the future of the character's
751;The performances from it's three leads are extraordinary.
752;Del Torro is captivating as the ex.
753;Last but certainly not least is the phenomenal Naomi Watts as wife and mother suffering through tragedy.
754;the performances alone are worth every minute of this great film and the only thing that the director's attention on his story telling devise hurts in this film, is that it gets in the way of the characters.
755;overall though, 21 Grams is a moving and touching look into the human condition.
756;The acting is well done, but I found it to be acting for the sake of acting, and such a thing holds little interest for me personally.
757;All in all, the most unwatchable film of the past two years for me, but keep in mind, I am not an art film guy.
758;If you are, you will probably enjoy this.
759;on the positive side, most of the acting is superb.
760;Benicio de Toro's performance was beyond brilliant.
761;She looks good, though, so men might overlook her pallor.
762;Melissa Leo, as del Toro's wife was perfect in her role.
763;It's full of thought provoking elements.
764;Except Jack Jordan (del Toro's character) and his family.
765;Penn, by his natural humanity, makes us care about him, but that's a gift I think he gave to the script.
766;The character is written with great depth and compassion and acted accordingly.
767;He is the one, troubled as he was, who comes through with the real heart.
768;It seems that the goal of the film is to impress.
769;It's one of those films that takes a little time to get in harmony with, but once there it has a lot to say about tragedy and the unfair ways life can present it's self.
770;Benicio Del Toro was absolutely stunning in this film.
771;His faith is deep and though he sometimes finds his old ways rising to the surface once in awhile he is truly a reformed man.
772;Along the way he finds the man's broken wife, played beautifully by Naomi Watts, and they strike up a friendship that helps both of them heal from their tormented lives.
773;And the result is simply riveting and touching.
774;I must say Del Toro has become one of my very favorite actors.
775;He has the face of a Bronson meets Cagney sort of guy, who can play some tough characters, but he can also play people with tender emotions.
776;Will continue to order .
777;linear, but after some time, you notice that things are moving linearly, just with some jumps.
778;And, make a sex scene with Naomi Watts (one of the few good parts in the movie.)
779;*Naomi Watts is the sex relief.
780;All of my reviewing predessors blabbed away the very element that makes this film so compelling.
781;This is one of those full.
782;Life, death, love, hope, desperation and redemption have rarely been examined so thoroughly on film.
783;To say I loved this film would be like saying I loved a root canal
784;*The technique of splintering a plot into a chronological puzzle is ably handled in the first hour.
785;The director's intentions appear admirably fulfilled, and the actors display a wide range of emotions .
786;As it is, the film is more a spectacle than a meditation, an entertainment rather than art, and its detail is quickly forgotten.
787;He has aspired to work with the American studios and has succeeded in measuring up to their standards.
788;21 grams is one of the best well acted films ever.
789;i thought all the actors were great and the film was too.
790;love it or hate it it is a good movie.
791;I personally liked this movie alot.
792;This film was really great.
793;This is one of those films that makes you say wow.
794;This had some really great acting.
795;I really enjoyed this film.
796;All 3 actors did a fine job on this film.
797;But was this a really good film that will probably put you through a sad state for a few minutes.
798;great film.4 out of 5.
799;This is an utterly rivetting film about three lives that intersect by chance.
800;again christian and is lucky to be loved .
801;what makes this film so outstanding is the actors: they are absolutely first rate and you feel what they are going thru as they question life and try to cope.
802;good film where all's well that ends well.
803;It is brilliant art that reflects on life.
804;And it is definitely not for people that want to mindlessly watch a story unfold.
805;however, the powerful portrayal of three intertwined lives and the brutal cause and effect relationship that ties them together is incredible.
806;i put this movie up there with other powerful cinematic tragedies : Dr. Zhivago and The English Patient.
807;21 Grams is a very dramatic movie.
808;The donor along with his two daughters was hit by a born again Chritian ex.
809;The born again, who is a husband and father, has a long prison record before his hit and run, which he turns himself in for.
810;You really have to like dramas to enjoy this movie.
811;21 Grams is a cinematic masterpiece, one of the most brilliant and heart.
812;wrenching films to come our way in the past several years.
813;In a mere two hours and five minutes, this great work grapples with most of the fundamental themes of life, including death, religion, loss, grief, guilt, recrimination, retribution, redemption, salvation .
814;and does so in a way that is utterly unique, profound, moving and compelling.
815;Thanks to the intensity of the performances, the artistry of the writing and directing, and the script's keen observations on human nature, we are drawn into the world of this film in a way that rarely happens in the cinema anymore.
816;among other things, 21 Grams boasts one of the most striking and amazing acting ensembles in recent memory.
817;rate supporting actors who make an indelible mark on the film and on our hearts, prime among them Charlotte Gainsbourg, as Paul's wife, who is unable to make a claim on her husband's affections despite standing by him through his life.
818;The measure of their character lies in how each of them deals with that trial.
819;as he comes to see it .
820;put quite simply, 21 Grams is the single best movie I have seen in years, a complete artistic triumph for all involved.
821;It will leave you reeling.
822;The point of the saying being that tomorrow is a new day.
823;the acting is absolutely SUPERB.
824;Sean Penn, realistically, could have won an Oscar for BOTH Mystic River and 21 Grams.
825;appreciated actors of the modern film world.
826;Even the second tier cast was outstanding.
827;Melissa Leo, for example, was incredible in the way she played a Lady MacBeth.
828;The emotion that Alejandro I rritu is able to get from his cast is staggering.
829;Its emotional impact on his audience is mind.
830;sequence method that was used in the films editing, but it breaks helps to give the audience a small emotional break (as another reviewer stated, this is a REALLY dark, sad film) and also makes for a better payoff as you fit the pieces of the film together to reveal the whole picture.
831;i can't possibly recommend this enough.
832;It is horribly depressing, but it's also an absolutely brilliant work of art.
833;This was an extremely moving film that pulls no punches yet beautifully avoids passing judgment.
834;and then there's Paul, the man who finally brings the two of them together.
835;A mathematician with a terminal heart, condition and a marriage to match, Paul receives Cristina's husband's heart, and then court her.
836;But Cristina has an influence on Paul as well .
837;Suffice it to say, this is the perfect movie for people who like to see the same movie more than once.
838;grabbing, and disturbingly powerful film.
839;It is certainly one of the best films I have seen all year long.
840;She has two wonderful daughters and a kind husband.
841;Jack Jordan (Benicio Del Toro) is a spiritual ex.
842;Little details and clues are fed to the viewer as the film progresses and crashes in a stunning finale.
843;The disturbing images are subtle, and the fabulous photography helps capture what is going on so clearly.
844;the performances are all Oscar caliber in genius Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's tour de force.
845;perfect, but his character touches familiar ground as in Mystic River.
846;Benicio Del Toro is fantastic as a very disturbed but honest man.
847;Charlotte Gainsbourg and Melissa Leo both are solid as the wives of the main characters, and at many times, the audience really hates both these women for being so selfish.
848;if a film can do that, then the screenwriter and director have both done their job.
849;Her performance is so captivating that you can't take your eyes off the screen.
850;She will certainly come out of the Hollywood darkness in this one, making herself a well.
851;known and more respected actress.
852;All of the players are at the top of their game.
853;if you can sit through darkness, drugs, and depression, this is a great movie with a lot to offer and a shocker of an ending.
854;All the performances are perfect, and the technical production of the film is first rate.
855;21 Grams arrives at number 2 on my list of 2003 great films, and deserves all of its acclaim.
856;There's something about this film that holds you down and forces its way into your mind and there's no escaping it.
857;To be nice, 21 Grams is an interesting movie.
858;the story is very emotional, and the acting is pretty good.
859;the movie has some very deep, interesting scenes to it.
860;For example, when her sister flicks her off in the pool this is the same moment when her family is killed.
861;I liked this component of the movie.
862;the few complex scenes and potential excellent.
863;I like more naturally flowing stories.
864;This is a wonderful film that requires a great deal of patience on the part of the viewer.
865;It tells the story of three individuals and how their lives are brought together by a single tragic event.
866;the genius of the film is how the story is told.
867;this is not a very upbeat film, but is emotionally gripping, and contains fantastic performances.
868;Unlike many movies out these days, this one actually has a meaning.
869;The minute you begin to watch this one you realize theres something that sets it apart from other flicks.
870;I personally Sean has the best performance out of the big three.
871;the great part about the movie is the meaning.
872;It really makes you think, I love movies like that (ex.
873;There is a great message to this movie.
874;anyways, I reccomend this movie to anyone who likes movies with purposes, or likes to think.
875;I realize not everyone will like this movie, but I think most people enjoy movies with meanings.
876;It's a film that plays like a hysterical musical composition of raw emotion and lyric.
877;Each performance is truly captivating and the director's merciless nonlinear structure adds volumes to the heightened intensity of the story.
878;It's amazing to be glued to a film in which you're always trying to figure out where you are in it.
879;but Inarritu is a mad composer of slick, realistic, spiritually absorbing masterpieces (check out Amores Perros if you don't believe me)The film is centered around three characters whose lives are forever changed in the event of tragedy.
880;con is gripping to watch on screen has he battles his inner and outer demons.21 Grams is riveting in the numerous issues it tackles without ever being preachy or verbose.
881;to be honest, this movie was breath taking, it left me with a feeling of how much your life is truely worth, and how much happiness you truely have in your days before thee unescapable transformation to the otherside.
882;forwards and flashbacks definitely heightened the dramatic tension and overall experience of this film.
883;what makes this movie stand out, however, is the incredible acting.
884;Del Toro, Penn, and Watts are all great actors, and all three shine.
885;I compare this 21 Grams with Thirteen Conversations, a very good movie by Jill Sprecher: you know, the hit.
886;run, the cheating, the same fate theme, the same pursuit for redemption and happiness.
887;And actually, from having watched each film only once (and 13 not even all the way from the beginning), I find Jill Sprecher's work more impressive.
888;By comparison, 13 Conversations felt much more purposeful and confident.
889;Incredible acting talent in both films (good to see Melissa Leo working again after Homicide) .
890;I just found them used better in one movie than the other.
891;It reminded me of Memento, and it used that certain style of editing and a puzzling storyline to bring everything together in the end, flawlessly.
892;the performances by the entire cast were just amazing.
893;Benecio Del Toro was also amazing, even more so here than in TRAFFIC.
894;His character was probably the most complex and you could really connect with him in a way.
895;if you like films that put you through an emotional rollercoaster and twist your mind thrice times a million times, I'd recommend this.
896;Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's 21 Grams employs an unconventional narrative to explore how one incident can bind together the destinies of three individuals.
897;To watch lives change in an instant is a sobering experience.
898;Jack Jordan (Benicio Del Toro) is a former convict who has turned his life around with the help of his strong religious beliefs.
899;Cristina Peck (Naomi Watts) is a married woman who finds comfort and stability in her husband and two daughters.
900;A tragedy strikes that devastates Cristina and sets into motion a series of events that draws Paul into her life and forces Jack to reassess his most deeply.
901;chronological manner is jarring at the outset.
902;Penn and Watts are solid in their roles but Del Toro's performance is absolutely mesmerizing.
903;Eddie Marsan, Charlotte Gainsbourg and Melissa Leo perfectly compliment the leads with their supporting performances and prove invaluable in increasing the emotional impact of the unfolding events.
904;If you're willing to accept the unique storytelling style of 21 Grams then you will find yourself watching a devastating and absorbing creative work.
905;The technique of this film is fascinating.
906;sequentially, allowing for dozens of flash.
907;The effort of building the story out of this collage of scenes mentally disarms the audience, so that when the fragments come together into a solid narrative the climax arrives with uncommon power.
908;in terms of philosophy, I think of this plot as a conflict between two paradigms: One is deterministic .
909;Their psychic pain is palpableThis dichotomy is at the heart of the human condition .
910;I. e. God works in mysterious ways.
911;These are rich themes and I know I'm just scratching the surface.
912;This is definately worthwhile for fans of existential drama.
913;Del Toro and Penn are equally powerful in their performances.
914;An excellent film for the mature brain.
915;One about the complexity of human emotions?
916;If you have 2 hours at your disposal to directorily comment on all of them you wind up with a film that says .
917;It's in fact a trick that works in many other levels of life just as effectively.
918;candy but precious little else.
919;Oh well, i could go on and on but the point is made.
920;I had to see it twice to appreciate it completely, and of course it takes some endurance to do so.
921;Towards the end, he grabs a gun and shoots himself while Naomi Watts and Benicio del Toro are fighting on the other side of the room.
922;The reason I think there's a bit of reconciliation is that in one of the very last shots of the film, while the narrativevoice.
923;And actually, because the film is giving us what we could call a God's.
924;What is important is that Arriaga has shown us there is potential for reconciliation.
925;and as you might guess, I interpret Christina's pregnancy at the end as being a sort of resurrection.
926;She lost her family, and Sean Penn's love has given her another one.
927;At the very end, you see her in her daughters'bedroom, cradling her pregnant abdomen and holding one of her daughter's stuffed animals.
928;I can't say enough about this movie, I absolutely loved it.
929;I would have loved to be able to hear what the director and stars had to say about this movie, it was definitly one of the best movies i've seen in a long time.
930;written film, and the editing deserves much credit, because the fractured cuts make this movie more interesting than if it went straight through start to finish.
931;I have never been a big fan of Sean Penn, but he is incredible in this movie, bringing a certain innocence and creepiness to his character, a deathly ill man seeking the person who saved his life.
932;Benecio del Toro is a revelation here, providing the best work of his career, even better than his Oscar.
933;winning performance in Traffic .
934;convict who has found Jesus, and found him adamantly, becoming an aggressive bible thumper who lives by the harsh rules of the bible.
935;But the best acting in this film has to go to Naomi Watts.
936;She has already given a couple of very strong performances in her career, and she is no longer just known as Nicole Kidman's best friend, because she has the chops to stand on her own two feet.
937;Nearly every scene she is in is memorable, and her Oscar nomination for this role was very much deserved.
938;the best part about the writing of this film is that although there is not much back story shown about each character, they still manage to be incredibly deep people, and we know about their pasts through small comments.
939;In the end, we manage to care about all the three people involved, and this is what brings this film from being average to being great.
940;The concept was good, however the presentation lacked a real plot.
941;see this one for the performances, for they are all white hot.
942;We are thrown into emotionally intense scenes before we have a chance to actually care about these characters.
943;His acting is good but he does'nt embody the role of a mathematician.
944;Toro's performance saves this film from becoming a self.
945;His character, it seems, makes the biggest journey, and he inhabits his role with a quiet intensity.
946;He is the character that you feel for as the story develops.
947;It's his resolution that gives the film the weight and impact it has.
948;I like to be overwhelmed with an intense empathic response.
949;I also enjoy becoming absorbed into the characters and living the drama myself.
950;I viewed both of these films back.
951;rate and the movie has a message which is worth viewing.
952;The three lead actors in this film give great performances, but I had a hard time getting emotionally involved because of the editing.
953;But the three actors here are among the best acting in film today, so it's definitely worth seeing for that.
954;(I saw it in several, which detracted from the viewing)In the end it's easy to see the movie as a work of art.
955;It's best at it's darkest.
956;as with films such as Mulhouland Drive and Requiem for a Dream, this somber, intense film will be disturbing and unenjoyable for some, while profound, amazing, and powerful for others.
957;best performance of the year (his explosive role in Mystic River earned him his first Oscar win) as a terminally.
958;Naomi Watts gives her best performance to date as the grief.
959;stricken woman who has tragically lost her family due to a traffic accident, only to find hope in the most unique and surprising of individuals.
960;the horrific twist of fate and the events proceeding the tragic accident is magically scripted, placed specifically in certain places so the film is more beautiful and enigmatic.
961;21 Grams is a portrayal of how one event can change everything for three individuals, the emotional roller.
962;but for those who truly enjoy film at its distinct, resounding finest.
963;The best of its kind.
964;if it fits into a genre.
965;first off lets admit that the film has some great acting performances from the three main leads with Sean Penn and Naomi Watts being impressive.
966;Everything about this film is beautiful and superb.
967;All three stars give amazing performances.
968;Sean Penn is great as usual, and Naomi Watts is to brilliant for words.
969;It resembles PT Anderson's work in Magnolia (connection wise), and Tarantino's work in Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction (plot sequence wise).
970;Go see it and you'll love it.
971;The best film that I've seen in 2004 so far.
972;Jack is also a father of two kids, and one of them knows what the father did.
973;christina's tragedy brings another man onto the stage .
974;so unique that you should be very attentive to what is going on the screen.
975;alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu certainly believes in the power of film as media, and he is good at presenting his story, too.
976;something about the still undying power of cinema .
977;sacrificing the accessible narrative method.
978;It takes a lot of energy to watch, and other than some nice scenes of Naomi Watts naked, there isn't a whole lot of reward for your effort.
979;I've never seen such a film that trusts its audience's intelligence so much.
980;Sean Penn gives out, unquestionably, the best performance of his career.
981;21 Grams is quite possibly the most raw and heartbreaking cinematic experience of 2003.
982;I still enjoyed getting wrapped up in the story.
983;I truly enjoyed it regret not watching it in the theaters first.
984;It is, nonetheless, a very thought provoking film filled with resonant performances, great visuals and subtle but moving music.
985;the film is a bit of a puzzle (in more ways than one)
986;The supporting cast is excellent too by the way.
987;All the characters in this film are flawed in some way, which in my mind is one of the strongest aspects of the film.
988;as for me, I really enjoyed this film despite its heaviness.
989;While I was relieved when it was over, my exhaustion was more reflective of the film getting under my skin than dissatisfaction, so I can still really recommend it.
990;The acting is superb and the drama feels real.
991;It also adds suspense and curiosity to see what transpired in between when we see the start,end and certain middle parts one after the other and then spend the rest of the time curious to know what happened in between and to fit the pieces of the puzzle.
992;Great actors, decent story, but the direction left a bit to be desired.
993;in every life a stranger's actions may reflect our future at any given moment and this film brings together three lives and three families as no other.
994;The film takes these main characters and twists and turns back and forth through time revealing the past and presenting glimpses of the future as it rolls slowly along.
995;the actors in this film deserved more attention for their roles.
996;Penn is perfect as the seriously conflicted man managing to always be flawless in such challenging roles.
997;Watts is brilliant next to Penn and is not even close to suffocating in his turmoil
998;He always brings something extra to his roles.
999;Adding to the fantastic acting of these individuals is the way that the director filmed this movie.
1000;But the filmmakers deepen the tragedy of the characters with this unique technique somehow.
1001;With all of the people we pass by unconsciously everyday it may make you wary or it may make you aware of the impact your life has in the world.
1002;The message is clear and the writer/director, Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, has managed to convey his worth to the world in an amazingly unique and profound way.
1003;The weight of this film is more than a few grams and Inarrito has carved himself a brilliant future.
1004;centered drama is a sweeping character.
1005;This is a great movie that captured the reality of life, not hollywood fiction.
1006;If you are one of them, please consider this.
1007;A very interesting concept, but it had nothing to do with the film.
1008;21 Yawns is a better title.
1009;My 3yr old daughter recommended this film to me, and we watched it on a triple bill with Bambi and Spy Kids.
1010;i loved the action adventure set.
1011;Highly original cartoon dream sequence.
1012;*SPOILER*The diets are all successful and by the end they each weight just 21 grams!
