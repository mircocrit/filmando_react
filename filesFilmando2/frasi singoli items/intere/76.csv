id;spiegazione
1;I felt I had received my money's worth after the first five minutes.
2;so if you like this sort of surreal, oh.
3;clever if you're of the yuppy generation and think YOU'RE so terribly clever, exponent of meaningless and purposeless film making, you'll be in heaven.
4;Inexplicably nominated for direction and screenplay .
5;however, one does have to doff the hat at two performances, the rightfully Oscar nominated supporting work of Catherine Keener, and the unjustly Oscar.
6;They are both quite fine and the only reasons to see this bizarre little film.
7;The film portrays the havoc that the existence of this passage engenders, both in the life of John Malkovich, and in the lives of those who utilize this passage to get their own cheap thrills.
8;the storyline of this twisted, darkly hilarious movie shuttles back and forth between the viewpoint of John Malkovich, and the viewpoint of the people who discover the secret passage.
9;The best way to think of this movie is more twists and turns than a spiral staircase that has been filled neck.
10;After seeing this, I guarantee you will feel incredibly curious about how Spike Jonze came up with the whole idea.
11;to literally put words in his mouth, and thoughts in his mind?
12;an interesting subplot is the commentary this movie contains about the nature of obsessive love.
13;I recommend the living daylights out of it.
14;It's definitely worth owning .
15;you'll want to see it again and again.
16;Being John Malkovich is the most original and entertainig movie of 1999.
17;I will join Ebert in giving it a thumbs up.
18;I will aslo join Ebert in calling it my favorite movie of 1999.
19;Roger Ebert is known for viewing and reviewing many pictures over our time.
20;However he can only make one movie his best picture of 1999, and that was Being John Malkovich.
21;If it is good enough for Roger and Me than it's good enough for you.
22;Sorry Michael Moore about the Roger and Me pun.
23;It's a movie full of forshadowing and full of symbols.
24;So free your mind of any thought, and sit down and pop in Being John Malkovich, and enjoy.
25;I'm not easy on them either, but I have studied film for long enough to judge with knowledge.
26;Yes, it has an interesting premise .
27;One relationship twist was piled on top of the other just to keep the movie going.
28;I did, however, enjoy some connectivity between the movie shown through puppeteering in cusak's character in various ways.
29;Being John Malcovich is the most origional movie I have EVER seen.
30;If you have not seen it I would recommend you see it as soon as possible.
31;The origionality and comedy of the movie were incredible.
32;This happens to be one of the ones I appreciate, not love.
33;When you actually are John Malkovich, the camera work is brilliant, as well as the depth perception, sound, and lighting.
34;This movie is very funny, and as importantly, very original.
35;Spike Jonze's directorial humor is perfectly aligned with the script, and he pulls off even the most challenging scenes successfully.
36;As almost everyone knows, this movie is about a character finding a portal into John Malkovich's brain, and it takes a lot of skill on the part of everyone involved in the film to make the movie as good as its premise.
37;john Cusack is great as the down.
38;catherine Keener is also excellent as Cusack's foil, a hard.
39;director Jonze does a nice job of intertwining the visually fantastic (the portal to Malkovich, the 7 1/2 floor, etc) with the utterly real (the New Jersey Turnpike, Cusack's street corner puppet box), so you never get too far removed from the reality of the characters' relationships with each other.
40;In other words, Jonze creates a fantastic world but keeps you connected to the people who live in it.
41;The success of movies like this, hopefully, will encourage film makers to have a bit more confidence in their audiences.
42;Two of the extras are extended segments of programs that appeared on television within the film.
43;sized, full length versions of what the TV was showing.
44;Another extra is a 20.
45;another extra is a brief, parodic interview with the director while he's driving his car.
46;One other extra feature is footage of an extra who had to drive her car in the background of a shot on the NJ Turnpike, along with a couple of dozen other extras.
47;It's shot with a shaky camcorder by, and is entertaining because the girl is really funny, although, again, it doesn't really tell you much about how this movie (or any other movie) is made.
48;Very brief, and will make you laugh once.
49;1999 was a really great year for movies and I didn't get to see all the ones I wanted in the theater.
50;Being John Malkovich is the exception and a very enjoyable one at that.
51;It's entertaining, creative, original, surprising, and best of all .
52;I found myself easily going along for the ride that comes from taking opportunistic advantage of an accedental discovery.
53;It's a good thing this wasn't Being Ned Beatty or something like that(still can't get over Deliverance).
54;This film is brilliantly directed .
55;most likely the best directed film of the year.
56;The script is way, WAY out of left field, but it manages to satire our fascination with celebrity and still tell a genuinely moving story.
57;And the performances are first.
58;John Cusack is one of our most underrated actors, and I also thought Cameron Diaz was terrific.
59;John Malkovich and Catherine Keener though, their craft is on a whole other level.
60;It's success is that it's enjoyable .
61;Very interesting and full of sorprises.
62;I was so brave from the writer, producers, etc. to make this movie, because it could be something totally silly or great.
63;this scene made me reflect quite a lot, and I think that with it, Spike Jonze has uncovered one of humanity's biggest illusions (whether he did it on purpose is another matter): that there are other people around us.
64;What they actually are is: I. For everyone is always I. Every life is lived by I.
65;BEING JOHN MALKOVICH is one of the most inventive movies I've ever seen.
66;The central conceit is clever and original, but the genius of the movie is that dizzying variations on the idea are worked smoothly into the plot and used to reveal the devices and desires of the characters.
67;The entire cast does a suberb job, and even Charlie Sheen appears in a rare non.
68;BEING JOHN MALKOVICH is delightful and disturbing, a rare and magical combination.
69;This is one the most clever, original, funny movies ever made.
70;This was a very nice surprise.
71;The plot is perfectly complete.
72;He used to make the most creative and intense pictures.
73;I still believe that skateboarding world has given a lot of influence to the art panorama (e. g. Nirvana and their enormous offspring, but especially the graphic design world.)
74;Through the entire movie I kept saying to myself, What the?
75;An amazingly interesting plot, Being John Malkovich nearly shot itself in the foot with its odd ball advertising scheme, the trailers and t. v. spots were so confusing that noone I know wanted to see it.
76;The style of acting is so real from Cusack, I had never seen him so natural in a role.
77;It moves itself very well towards its climax, and flows so easily that you don't even realize you were watching a movie until its over.
78;It has comedic elements .
79;All the performances are done well, especially John Malkovich's portrayal of himself.
80;The others, John Cusack, Cameron Diaz, Catherine Keener, manage terrifically with their roles.
81;Being John Malkovich is my choice for the best film of 1999.
82;allison5000 has deemed it so!
83;Stemming from a brilliant script, the film features mandrical performances from the entire cast.
84;The ending is truly a sublime treat.
85;Best Picture of 1999, hands down.
86;The acting is superb, as is the story.
87;Suddenly, he's seeing through the eyes of John Malkovich.
88;Anyway, this guy starts selling tickets, and the fun ensues!
89;There's fun, and drama, and intrigue along the way .
90;"I don't have an answer for why it couldn't have been Tom Cruise (or anyone else for that matter)
91;"The characters, while brilliantly played by Keener, Cusack, and Diaz, are not particularly lovable
92;"I won't try to explain this movie beyond that
93;"a couple of times
94;And it's a whole lot more than being John Malcovich.
95;Aww heck, I wanted to love it.
96;I'm a big fan of black comedies in general.
97;I've followed Spike Jonze's career for years, John Cusack is one of my favourite actors and Cameron Diaz.
98;What if there are good, film.
99;A truly weird and amusing film, made better by the fact that the characters plausibly accept the completely weird world they occupy.
100;strength suspension of belief it achieves.
101;The 7.5th floor set is very amusing (I'm a cubicle.
102;you can take a date or friend to see it.
103;You can think about this film, or not, and enjoy it either way.
104;See this amazing film!It's funny, off.
105;see films of the year.
106;this is a film that defies description .
107;it is so clever and sly and witty and whimsical and weird.
108;I hadn't seen it since it came out and we are introducing our older teen son to great movies that are new to him.
109;It hasn't dated at all, it's as sharp and relevant and funny today was it was when it was made.
110;Has some really funny cameos .
111;Every detail is just works.
112;It's a wonderful film, a true classic.
113;Makes me happy that such a quirky, thought provoking odd film exists.
114;Everyone raved about this movie so I had high expectations.
115;There were moments of brilliance in this film and also moments of pure stupidity.
116;The real John Malkovich is a good sport for going along with this one.
117;on one hand, the film is (as most every critic has already stated) highly creative and original in both concept and story.
118;ironically, the only character the audience can really relate to and have any stake in staying with throughout the whole movie is John Malcovich himself (who is hilarious here, by the way).
119;in my opinion, this picture walks a fine line between concept and execution.
120;Definitely have to watch this movie more than once to pick up on things you missed the first time.
121;john malkovich was great in 'in mice of men' and 'in the line of fire'
122;Charlie Kaufman may be the greatest screenwriter of our generation.
123;He's written three of the greatest screenplays in recent memory (`Being John Malkovich', `Adaptation' and `Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind') and those are just the three I've seen (to be honest, I was not entirely impressed with `Confessions of a Dangerous Mind' and I never saw `Human Nature').
124;He has a knack for creating scenarios that are entirely improbable yet tap into the very soul of a human.
125;there are so many ways to interpret this movie that I feel as if touching upon them all would be too difficult a task at this point.
126;to be completely honest, I woke up wanting to be John Malkovich.
127;the film exposes some very human truths, in regards to the desire to be someone we're not and the desire to see ourselves through someone else's eyes.
128;What I thought was so great about the script was that it in a humorous and sub.
129;The films brilliant prose is bolstered by the fantastic, and I mean FANTASTIC, performances by the entire cast.
130;Cameron Diaz is brilliantly sporadic with her actions and feelings, adding layers to her characters inborn struggle to be herself.
131;Catherine Keener is flawless as Maxine.
132;She demands our attention with her marvelous manipulation of our emotions.
133;His brilliant portrayal of himself is utterly flawless.
134;"I have liked him in the past and found him stale in the past, but this performance is astonishing in every sense of the word
135;Great pressing of one of the best movies of 1999.
136;The supplemental interview with John Malkovich and John Hodgeman is really great if only to watch Malkovich impersonate the sitting on the toilet video, though there is also a great deal of good information in it as well.
137;I just happened to really find that moment wonderfully random and bizarre.
138;I mean they are really some very convuluted and jigsawed films.
139;that consistently are flawless and so very, very watchable.
140;Its so smart, so creative and yes, so original.
141;they performances are EXCELLENT, the music perfect and the direction delicate and precise.
142;Just a wonderful film that most have seen, but for those that have yet to, do yourself a favor and check it out.
143;a great film, matching all the componets for a near perfect experience.
144;Being John Malkovich is both one of 1999's best films and also THE weirdest.
145;A brief summary: a man (John Cusack) finds a portal which you can go into to enter John Malkovich's head.
146;Being John Malkovich is the product of a brilliant script and very creative directing by Spike Jonze (who starred in Three Kings ).
147;The acting is incredible and very believable.
148;John Malkovich ( The Messenger, Dangerous Liasons ) was both intelligent and brave to take a role in which he is deserving of a Best Supporting Actor nomination and haillarious as he makes fun of himself.
149;It is a hillarious comedy with so many twists and turns one viewing does not serve this amazing film justice.
150;Definitely a strange idea .
151;Fortunately for all it is done well.
152;"There are some aspects of the movie that I consider well thought out and interesting, but the movie itself falls short of all the ""ingenious, original, modern masterpiece"" nonsense that is said about it."
153;the main character is an unemployed puppeteer who is truly gifted with creative genius in his art.
154;the climax of the movie displays some of the same creative qualities that I found appealing in the introduction, but overall it just left me just hoping it would hurry up and end. . . . . .
155;If you like quirky scripts, actors working out of their comfort zone, and good directing you should see this film.
156;It was great and strange.
157;I loved the 7 1/2 floor and all the characters.
158;It's interesting seeing the changes people have as they be john for 15 mintues.
159;This is a great movie.
160;At any rate, I thought every moment of this movie was pretty much perfect, and many aspects of it reminded me of another movie I love, Brazil.
161;And to top it all off, it used a fragment of Bartok's Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta, which is one of my favorite pieces of music.
162;This should have been nominated for more Academy Awards and won more.
163;This was a very smart, funny, and creative movie.
164;Great performances by Joh Cuack and Malkovich, too.
165;hard to find a film so full of itself in its supposed humor laughing at what is really a horror story.
166;One of the best movies of the 90's.
167;This movie has an array of known actors, who play in a movie that isn't mainstream comedy, yet it is funny with thought provoking scenes.
168;i love John Malkovich in any movie, but especially this one!
169;Spike Jonze's Being John Malkovich is like a breath of fresh air.
170;the film is about an unsuccessful puppeteer who is in love with a woman and wins her heart by controlling the actor John Malkovich, to whose brain he has found a portal.
171;Though the story is absurd, the film is not merely about its gimmick but full of fantastic twists and turns which I would not dream of revealing here.
172;The film is so original, so unique indeed, that during watching it I sometimes found myself asking: Is this really happening, am I really watching a movie right now or is this just a Kafkaesque dream.
173;Like Fight Club , the film manages to be intelligent, furious and very entertaining.
174;Being John Malkovich is a reminder that even today it is still possible to tell a story in a way like it was never done before.
175;It will be a daunting task for director Spike Jonze and screenwriter Charlie Kaufmann to live up to this film in the future.
176;wall, yet it manages to ask key questions about the nature of identity.
177;It's funny, constantly manic yet always interesting.
178;catherine Keener deserved her Oscar nomination, playing Maxine as this vicious shrew who managed to find and find herself deserving of love.
179;Nearly unrecognizable under a giant, frizzy wig, ministering to animals while trying to come to terms with realizing she's a man in a woman's body, Cameron Diaz gives the best performance of her career.
180;sack hero to villain, proves his range.
181;And Malkovich as Malkovich is superb.
182;visually, it's stunning, as well.
183;And the scene where Malkovich enters his own portal is a particular highlight.
184;this was the best film of 1999.
185;This movie is so inventive that you'll wonder how screenwriter Charlie Kaufman thought of the concept.
186;It is thoroughly original, funny and entertaining.
187;John Cusack is great as the pathetic pupeteer, and Cameron Diaz shows she can take good career risks with this unusual role for her.
188;But it is Catherine Keener and John Malkovich who give the film is's flavor.
189;Keener is the ultimate object of desire for everyone in the film and she delivers very funny lines and gives the best performance in the cast.
190;John Malkovich is also very funny playing himself, showing us that you can deliver a good performance even if you're playing an 'actor named John Malkovich'.
191;Great movie, one of the best of 1999.
192;From a scale of 1.10 I give this movie a 9!
193;Being John Malkovich is hilarious and out.
194;cast superb, and every scene seethes with creativity and an unbridled energy.
195;Watching it, we can't help but smile and appreciate its fearless invasion of the mind, and its journey into the unconventional.
196;A truly unique film, one that doesn't really amount to anything, though.
197;We walk out of the theatre saying That was so fun!
198;It's been a while anything this funny came down the pike.
199;Well, for some of us, so what is that the movie gave us a breath of fresh air.
200;This is an extraordinary movie.
201;They failed in Frankie and Johnny but sure succeeded here).
202;Cameron Diaz loves Catherine Keener (and in a brilliant scene tells John Cusack she wants surgery to make her a man), so he locks her in an animal cage.
203;This must be the funniest, craziest scene I have seen in a movie for a long, long time.
204;Nevertheless, this is a must see movie.
205;Spike Jonze (who later starred in Three Kings) has created a masterpiece.
206;The plot of the film is absolutely interesting and moving.
207;There is absolutely, totally, utterly no point in having half the film set in an office with a shoulder.
208;"Contrast this mess with ""The Purple Rose of Cairo"", a genuinely witty, touching and ingenious film, although founded on a similarly wacky premise."
209;It was definately quite funny, and very original.
210;To my mind, the desperate thirst for something original and fresh that has parched the metaphorical throats of so many film viewers of the 90s and beyond, is the chief thing that has compelled so many to proclaim this a masterpiece.
211;the premise has charm, it's true.
212;John Malkovich couldn't have been a better choice for an oddball film like this, and he is the one actor involved who I feel I can give real, enduring credit to.
213;He throws himself into the project without a trace of self.
214;consciousness, going wherever the movie asks him to, having fun, and tackling tricky territory at the same time (it can't be easy to pretend that you're partially possessed by a dorky John Cusack, but Malkovich does it well .
215;to reflect our own imperfections, somewhat uncomfortably .
216;The film will just decide: It's time to be serious and deep now, and that's that.
217;as far as performances go, it's pretty much Malkovich's show.
218;kudos to Charlie Sheen on a great cameo though.
219;One of the best parts of this otherwise interesting but overrated film.
220;At a time when many movies are utter crap, this one stood out for its originality.
221;In other words, it's a miracle this thing was sort of a minor hit.
222;top to be Funny, his performance could have Saved the Film from being just a Clever Premise looking for a Script.
223;there are a Few things here and there that held my Attention.
224;Also, inside the mind of Malkovich and seeing the world through his eyes is Fun for a While, but it Quickly gets Tiresome.
225;everyone says it's so funny, but I heard no one laughing in the theatre.
226;I absolutely LOVED LOVED LOVED this movie!
227;I thought the storyline was hilarious and John Cusack and Cameron Diaz were great!!!!
228;Spike Jonze's first feature film is spectacular.
229;The fantasy world of mystery that he creates is amazing.
230;The humor added by the Seven and Halfth Floor, the home base for the company that John Cusack comes to work for.
231;Cameron Diaz is barely recognizable as Cusack's wife, and her performance is great.
232;He enters the doorway, and is instantly transported inside the head of actor John Malkovich, played by(imagine that)John Malkovich.
233;The love quadrangle between Cusack, Diaz, Keener, and Malkovich is hilarious.
234;This is a great debut film for Spike Jonze.
235;Nominated for Supporting Actress(Keener), and Best Original Screenplay Academy Awards.
236;Being John Malkovich is incredible mostly for its emotional and comedic premise.
237;loving wife Lotte suggests he take an office job.
238;The elevator is stopped between floor seven and eight, and a hilarious video which Craig views in his orientation explains the reason for this.
239;Soon, he and his beautiful partner Maxine begin to charge 200 bucks a head to be John Malkovich for fifteen minutes, then you are spit out into a ditch on the side of the New Jersey Turnpike.
240;John Cusack is astounding as Craig Schwartz, an Oscar.
241;Cameron Diaz proves that she can be a great actress with her brilliant performance as Lotte.
242;Catherine Keener is excellent as Maxine, her oscar.
243;The truly wonderful performance comes from Malkovich, playing hmself of course, but not all the time.
244;Strong supporting performances by Charlie Sheen and Orson Bean make Being John Malkovich a wacky thrill.
245;Spike Jonze gives a incredible movie with his direction.
246;Being John Malkovich is one of the most fun and bizare films you will ever see, with comedy ranging from slapstick to satire.
247;He gets the job and finds a love named Maxine(Catherine Keener) ,who rejects him, and a portal that lets you be John Malkovich(Played by none other than.
248;There is also an interview with Spike Jonze that has a very Andy Kaufman.
249;There are also four trailers which are very amusing.
250;"My partner and I started by watching this feature first, and suddenly we were looking at each other and thinking, ""Wait a minute!"
251;The concept of being able to slide down a physical portal to take up residence for 15 minutes behind the eyes of John Malkovich makes the viewer wonder if this movie is some kind of allegory .
252;You have to give John Malkovich credit for allowing the makers of this film to use his career as a real.
253;life actor as a springboard for this very clever and imaginative exercise in metaphysical weirdness.
254;While I have seen and enjoyed this film many times I figured with Where the Wild Things Are about to come out I'd give this film a re.
255;see and write a proper review for it.
256;BJM is on it's surface satirical take on modern famous types, unknown creative types, and what it is that makes those at both ends of the spectrum tick.
257;Now while the true creative type from any discipline is compelled by unknown forces there are also those amongst them that are, shall we say, compelled by less pure forces.
258;Still, even the pure artist needs recognition of some sort.
259;Craig Schwartz, is a pure artist who is at the start of the film misunderstood and not communicating, no matter how hard he tries, to those around him.
260;As events unfold his wife leaves him and he is eventually thrust into the head of real life actor John Malkovich.
261;Also challenged is talent, fame and the notion that recognition comes from good art or just any established face in the public eye with some money to spend to explore any whim.
262;in ending we see a new life born, unaware that it is controlled by hidden forces.
263;The film never fully explains itself and that is why the film is so great.
264;watch the film again and agin, seeing it fresh each time it's explored down the road.
265;the inclusion of animals and higher primates in the film is symbolic.
266;I suspect it alludes to our evolution, base animal nature and how we so often deny that we are in fact just another animal on this planet, albeit a creative one, apart but the same from all other creatures.
267;the 1/2 floor represents our subconscious, and also animal side.
268;Personalities and desires, thoughts, hopes, dreams.
269;The portal to ones true self.
270;comedy, a trait that most likely developed as a result of our higher brain functions, is explored as well.
271;this film is a masterwork by the writer and director.
272;This is one of the great films of our times.
273;It is a portal that leads to the mind and body of John Malkovich.
274;"get co. worker lets anyone access the portal
275;This movie plays on many philosophical and psychological abstracts such as mind, consciousness, sub consciousness and private thought and diffuses them out with humor and sexual wits.
276;I'd liked bits and pieces, the puppets and John Malkovich himself, but I found a lot of the other characters not likable, especially the Cusack, Diaz and Keenar ones.
277;It was much improved for me on this second viewing.
278;The idea itself, of being inside John Malkovich for fifteen minutes at a time, before being hurled out of him and onto the New Jersey roadside, was original and brilliant.
279;I love surrealism so I liked this movie.
280;craig (Cusack) is a brilliant, unrecognised puppeteer, who lives with his animal collecting wife, Lotte (Cameron Diaz).
281;"craig discovers a ""tunnel"" and follows it into John Malkovich's brain and he and his freaky co. worker Maxine (Keener) decide this provides a fantastic opportunity to make extra cash."
282;Lotte, OTOH, finds the experience overpowering and overwhelming, with some interesting side effects in her relationship with the freaky Maxine.
283;as and actor, John Malkovich has always fascinated me.
284;I, OTOH, would see it as a wonderful opportunity.
285;the interview with Spike Jonze is priceless but raises more questions than it answers.
286;The movie is odd but at the same time it's so ingenious.
287;"All the characters were really great
288;Some people turned their noses up when I told them how much I had enjoyed it but I'm glad to see so many other people have enjoyed it as well.
289;if you don't then you'll HATE this movie.
290;Reasons to see this movie: I loved Adaptation and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind but hadn't seen this, the film that put Charlie Kaufman on the movie.
291;It's hard to say that it's his most original because they're all so original .
292;Amazing performances from all of the leads, but it's Catherine Keener who tops them all as the manipulative Maxine.
293;John Cusack's obsessive Craig is also fantastically done.
294;overall: Fantastically original, fantastically acted.
295;I think almost every reviewer will agree that this is one of the most original American films in years.
296;But it is also lyrical and superbly witty.
297;But somewhere along the way it seemed that that kid had developed a tremendous understanding of life, of literature and of the audience.
298;one of the refreshing things about Being John Malkovich is that it manages to be wild and unique without trying too hard.
299;It balances an outlandish plot with a subtle and intelligent wit that permeates the entire film.
300;even the best American films tend to be a little too full of themselves at times.
301;And all I ask in return is the opportunity to do my work.
302;the Grifters(1990) Cusack is Roy Dillon, a grifter, son of Angelica Houston, another grifter, and Annette Benning?
303;just a couple of friends' reports that they were very impressed.
304;All I need to say is that this is one terrific film and its a fair bet it's unlike any other you've ever seen.
305;"While it's humour is intellectual, at times downright black, it manages for the most part to remain lighthearted and playful
306;It is a weird movie, but if that is your kind of humor, this is the classic movie for you.
307;Tired of love stories, chick flicks or adventure.
308;well known gem is the kind of movie that attracts a certain special group of people who are fans of John Malkovich and his kind of off.
309;It sounds like a great idea, and it was entertaining, just not nearly to the extent that I thought it would be.
310;As a huge fan of anything by Charlie Kaufmann this movie lived up to my expectations and more.
311;John Cusack was fabulous and Catherine Keener was amazingly sexy.
312;There's twists and turns like you would expect from Kaufmann yet he always keeps you guessing.
313;I know that that is what touched me the most .
314;The image of the frustrated puppeteer thinking that he finally has become what he truly wants by manipulating the ultimate puppet (another human being and a very successful other human being at that) without realizing that HE is the one who is really being manipulated (by his own unfulfilled longings) is a masterful touch .
315;the land where everyone is you .
316;It has been awhile since I have seen such a good movie.
317;It is probably the most thought provoking movie I have ever seen.
318;And I find myself pretty hard to impress.
319;It's not a slapstick comedy like most comedies, but it is pretty funny.
320;Being John Malkovich is very clever and well thought out.
321;It also includes other great things.
322;When I was trying to sleep, all I could think was, Wow.
323;The kind of Wow you let out when you are just so amazed.
324;Wanting to be a man because the feeling of being a man feels soooo good intrigues me.
325;Catherine Keener received an Oscar Nomination for Best Supporting Actress as the Rude but Arractive Maxime.
326;Their home is filled with dogs, birds and even a monkey.
327;While you are there you see everything he sees and hear him speaking.
328;Diaz takes a turn and changes completely as a person.
329;She suddenly believes she should be a man.
330;the ideas in this movie are wildly imaginative and original.
331;You will never see another film like it.
332;loud scenes and also some quiet humor.
333;The performances are excellent, especially Malkovich who riffs easily on his own image.
334;Being John Malkovich is a revelation.
335;"Of course this movie isn't loved by all
336;The first thing I thought of when I heard about this movie was Anything this off the wall has to be good.
337;This movie really pioneers a new genre: I call it reali.
338;It truly is a rollercoaster.
339;But with a story this enthralling, it is a ride you are more than willing to take.
340;john Malkovich delivers the greatest performance of his career.
341;Being John Malkovich is a new film for the new millenium.
342;It is perfect frame by frame.
343;I reccomend this film for everyone.
344;it's probably worthwhile now to give it a second look and see if it does stand up .
345;Finally John Cusack just really gets on your nerves .
346;He sends himself up superbly and anyone that has an image of him as a surly actor will surely have their opinion changed.
347;The scene where he enters his own head is inspired and this gives me hope that Mr Jonze does have a future.
348;going public discover this wonderful actress.
349;a film that has been hyped to the gills, does contain a few excellent touches in what one hopes is a successful career for Mr Jonze.
350;But the greatest film of the last year.
351;it was refreshing to see the usually beautiful cameron diaz and john cusak in clothes and hairdos that made them appear as regular, homely people.
352;catherine keener did a cool job as the icy maxine.
353;nonetheless, the man's a master at his craft.
354;he went along with this strange, surprising plot perfectly.
355;that's another great way to describe what this movie makes you feel.
356;Being John Malkovich is a movie that i will always highly respect and love.
357;I have a theory: audiences are getting smarter.
358;So when a movie comes along like Being John Malkovich, or Memento or even visually impressive like the Matrix, we stand up and take notice.
359;Building a career largely from inventive music videos, first time director Spike Jonze comes out of the gate with probably the most unconventional comedy you'll see.
360;He also has a strong attraction to one of his co. workers, feisty Maxine (Catherine Keener).
361;One day while working, he discovers a small day and going inside he finds out he can see the world through John Malkovich's eyes for 15 minutes with an unceromonious dump on the New Jersey turnpike ditch.
362;The real treat though is of course Malkovich since at times you almost can't tell if he's acting or if he's really that quirky.
363;Then there's the comedy which is subtle to the first.
364;out funniest things I've seen lately.
365;A movie so inventive and funny, I'd suffer through the entire Adam Sandler filmography if they'd let me see it again (except Bulletproof , of course).
366;Especially memorable: what happens when JM enters his own portal and the surprising turn of events when Craig (John Cusack) manipulates JM for his own benefit.
367;It's so refreshing to see a movie devoid of that Test Audience Mentality .
368;Being John Malkovich, the world's first glimpse at Charlie Kaufman's brilliant and twisted mind, is an incredibly original and confident debut.
369;The triumph of the film is mostly due to Kaufman's belief and dedication to his off.
370;He handles big philosophical ideas through elements of humor, fantasy, and escapism, a wonderful clash of styles.
371;Spike Jonze also made an auspicious feature length debut with this film.
372;Whereas Kaufman is most creative on the page, Jonze's field of comfort is the screen, and he proves that with his unique camerawork and strong visual eye.
373;His brilliance shines through in the directing of the puppeteering scenes and most prominently, the sequence in which Lotte and Maxine enter into and travel through Malkovich's subconscious.
374;And the acting, my god!
375;John Cusack is hilarious and pathetic as a very David Foster Wallace.
376;Cameron Diaz is surprisingly great as Cusack's animal.
377;loving and possibly transsexual wife.
378;Catherine Keener's screen presence is enormous as the seductive and bazaar Maxine.
379;And shining with his name in the title, John Malkovich gives a stunning performance in probably one of the strangest roles an actor can take in his career.
380;Orson Bean is also wonderful as a 105 year.
381;old bodysnatcher and Charlie Sheen is great at being Charlie Sheen.
382;The Coen Brothers' chief film composer, Carter Burwell, offers up a great classical piano score that perfectly suits the haunting nature of the film.
383;Being John Malkovich is full of surprises.
384;It's all in a day's work for Charlie Kaufman, and the cast and crew who worked on the film couldn't have been any better.
385;This movie is a perfect example of how you shouldn't take drugs before writing scripts.
386;Get something better, like Amazon Women from Mars.
387;All the characters appeared drawn, like Barney Rubble.
388;Being John Malkovich is a movie that defies description.
389;The opening scene plunges the viewer into a wild, funny, and incredibly bizarre world that doesn't relent until well after the final credits start rolling.
390;the plot itself is intricate and discourages passive viewing, and is layed out in such a refreshingly understated fashion that you won't even realize just how unusual what you are seeing actually is.
391;Eventually Malkovich himself gets wind of the company (how and why this happens is another element that defies description) and the movie enters a new realm of engaging wierdness.
392;The acting is absolutely superb (Cameron Diaz, for example, shows herself to have a real sense of irony in her self.
393;effacing performance), and it is a lot of fun to imagine what Malkovich himself must have been thinking while filming the movie.
394;finally, the film explores what it means to be a person in an existence in which we are limited by our own consciousness.
395;The film plays on this theme in inventive ways, most revealingly I think, in a scene in which Malkovich enters his own mind.
396;this is a very entertaining movie.
397;The lighter moments were the best, and were suitably spaced throughout the movie.
398;But this is a small price to pay.
399;Surely of all the movies I have seen in the last few years, this one deserves that treatment!
400;It sounded great and had many great elements, however for me it just did not work.
401;I think this belongs to the arty farty crowd
402;"This film received rave reviews for being ""original, innovative, unique."""
403;Now, there's a great film!
404;Watching a film written by Charlie Kaufman is to understand what it's like to be a cinephile.
405;"It's actually a hilarious film, and one that's not nearly as ""arty"" as it's reputation would have you believe."
406;Struggling to secure work as a puppeteer, he eventually relents to his wife's gentle suggestion that he look for work outside the field of puppetry.
407;Much of this can be attributed to Catherine Keener, who emotes such a casual coolness that it becomes difficult to separate her from the character, a fact which has dogged her to this day (at least in my mind).
408;This after Craig shows her a portal into the mind of John Malkovich.
409;Now you'll just have to see the movie.
410;Because trust me, there's no review that could do proper justice to the genius that is Being John Malkovich.
411;It's a film that reflects our ever.
412;growing fascination with celebrity, even one as arbitrary as Malkovich himself.
413;Watching this film, I felt a great admiration for the sheer invention of it, the boundless creativity with which the writer and director attacked the subject.
414;Being John Malkovich is full of strange characters, wonderfully creative moments, and a sort of lunatic atmosphere that starts to take on its own twisted logic after awhile.
415;The ricidulousness of the movie's basic idea precludes any sort of traditional, satisfying dramatic conclusion.
416;Some of the characters are genuinely flawed, and in some places, unlikeable, but that fact is one of the few real human touches in the whole production.
417;if the basic premise of Being John Malkovich appeals to you, it's worth at least one look.
418;At the very least, it's one of the most original films to come out in a long time, if not necessarily the most satisfying.
419;1999 was the best year in movies I can remember.
420;And the most original of them all, Being John Malkovich.
421;He finds a door that goes into the mind of John Malkovich.
422;I applaud everyone involved in the making of this movie, you all rock.
423;Stop laughing and step back a minute.
424;it's funny, *and* it's a horror movie.
425;"they succeeded massively with the darkly subversive ""Being John Malkovich"", the story of a disaffected puppeteer (played by John Cusack) who discovers a secret aperture into the mind of actor John Malkovich."
426;headedly think this is a surreal comedy.
427;You'll be utterly delighted and glad you listened to my advice.
428;alright, for those of you who have seen this wicked little gem of sheer cinematic subversion.
429;That's fine, but be warned: everything in in Jonze and Kaufman's little tour de force here is expertly stage.
430;the direction and cinematography here are spot on, and every scene tells.
431;The acting is also superb, from Cusack's dangerously desperate puppeteer, to veteran actors Bean and the late Byrne Piven (Captain Merten, who pities dwarves), to Catherine Keener, who plays the wicked, devious, Machiavellian shrew Maxine.
432;good job, Miss Keener!The real plaudits go to Cameron Diaz.
433;lover Lotte showed the woman has some finely honed acting chops.
434;"surreal, quirky, brilliantly paced, constantly resourceful, occasionally creepy, with a haunting, pining score by Carter Burwell and Bjork that calls to mind Philip Glass's composition for ""Mishimia"", ""Being John Malkovich"" is a clever, wicked, blackly funny work of genius, but it is very much a horror film."
435;Being John Malkovich is one of the most creative and amusing, yet deep and dramatic movie I have ever seen!
436;It can be described well in one word: Amazing.
437;worthy, the script is creative, the cinematography is beautiful.
438;This movie presented its audience with loads of humorous science fiction, but deep inside, the heart.
439;chilling message leaves a thought.
440;Definately one of the best movies of the year!
441;(and most original) Everyone must see it.
442;Spike Jonze's debut is one of those strange little unclassifiable movies that come along once in a while.
443;A beautifully surreal, black comedy that plays its increasingly bizarre premise straight.
444;"effacingly superb, and perhaps the bravest performance to ever grace celluloid
445;psychology remain intact and wholly believable.
446;being John Malkovich, although of an acquired taste, is an undeniably unique and unpredictable voyage of cinema fantasy.
447;This is a great movie.
448;Fun to see Cusak and Diaz early in their careers.
449;Try it, you'll like it!
450;A great original film which shows the potential once again of an independent production.
451;The photography and the writing were exceptionally well done.
452;going from the hilarious side humor to the premise of the movie, somehow the concept of being able to enter John Malkovich's body for 15 minutes actually plays and this movie works.
453;Cusack and his wife, played by Cameron Diaz, compete with each other to occupy Malkovich in order, through Malkovich, to live out their love interest with a third individual (a straight relationship for Cusack and a lesbian relationship for Diaz).
454;"I must also note, John Malkovich is one hell of a good sport to willing to be the subject of this movie
455;Well, this is a comedy, right???
456;Must be a drama, right???
457;Anyone care to answer these questions???
458;If anything it's an art film.
459;But that's a good thing.
460;And what a film they have made!
461;Heartbreaking but humorous, wildly inventive yet strikingly simple.
462;"It's all so amazingly creative and fluid that watching it is like witnessing a dream, something you're constantly surprised by yet extremel
463;arty contraption of a film.
464;I'll call it astounding .
465;Either way, it's really, really good.
466;being John Malkovich has got to be one of the most intriguing movies I've ever seen.
467;Eventually, John himself finds out setting up a hilarious 'Malkovich scene'.
468;The previews were the best parts of this film.
469;I found the idea behind the story, a mysterious doorway that takes the visitor into the mind of John Malkovich, very intriguing.
470;Coupled with a good cast, the possibilities for a riveting and funny story abounded.
471;watching John Malkovich play himself is probably the best part of the film.
472;there are some excellent pupeteering scenes in the film that are enchanting.
473;after this first visit, the story meanders and plots within subplots appear with the pupeteers wife having a love affair with the attractive coworker while she occupies John Malkovich's body.
474;Spike Jonze was best known in the early '90s for his music videos.
475;"championed for its originality, ""Being John Malkovich"" will now be released on Blu."
476;There is a bit more clarity and detail but I'm confident that the Blu.
477;ray version will probably feature even better detail and clarity.
478;While the film is primarily dialogue, there is good use of surround channels during the entry to John Malkovich's head.
479;ray version for even better audio clarity and dynamic range on its lossless audio track.
480;Being John Malkovich comes with a 16.
481;"jUDGMENT CALL:Original and captivating, Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman's ""Being John Malkovich"" was a film that no one would ever expect to be made into a film, but because of its originality, it has become one of the most groundbreaking films to be released in America within the last 15 years."
482;And the main character, Craig Schwartz starts to have a sexual attraction to his co. worker.
483;And those who experience it literally go through a life.
484;"on paper, the explanation of ""Being John Malkovich"" seems as if it is being penned by someone trippin' on acid, but what he have is a writer striving for originality and a young director at the time who was creative and did thing his way."
485;And Spike Jonze is a director that knows how to interpret Kaufman's originality with his own.
486;"he is a product of a young, talented filmmakers that are known for creativity and he has shown that in his films such as ""Adaptation"", ""Where the Wild Things Are"" but creativity that also goes even farther when he and a group of friends created Dirt Magazine, he owns the Girl skateboard company and the collaboration between Jonez and Kaufman have been successful."
487;"back to ""Being John Malkovich"", part of the allure of the film is how people want to experience the life of a celebrity."
488;And they can see it up front.
489;It's an invasion of privacy but yet people revel in it.
490;there are so many things that made me laugh while watching this film.
491;"And watching it again over a decade later, ""Being John Malkovich"" is still a wonderful film!John Cusack did a wonderful job of playing the creep Craig Schwarz and this is probably one of the few films starring Cameron Diaz (and Charlie Sheen) which I actually do like."
492;But both Catherine Keener and even John Malkovich himself were great in the film and how cool Malkovich was of the film's humor and the use of his persona.
493;"and it was also great to see Octavia Spencer in an earlier, shorter role a decade before she would win awards for her role on ""The Help""."
494;as for this new release from the Criterion Collection, eventually the new digital transfer is enticing since the film is on Blu.
495;ray release is surely the definitive version to own, those who don't own a Blu.
496;"This interview was much more informative and enjoyable to watch than the older ""An Interview with Spike Jonze"" which was not good at all."
497;Charlie Kaufman, who wrote the script, and Spike Jonze who directed, are to be commended for being so daring and free with the usual notions of reality while callously demonstrating just how selfish human relationships can be.
498;Catherine Keener enters the scene with her big smile and long legs as a supremely confident amoral user of people and quickly becomes the focus of the triangle as both Cusack and Diaz fall in madly in love with her.
499;Cusack has met Keener through his new job as a fast.
500;is drawn into the person of actor John Malkovich, who is going about his daily life.
501;He is BEING John Malkovich!Okay, we have our strikingly original premise.
502;It includes some funny shtick and some intriguing ideas about identity, a prospect for immortality, Malkovich being turned into a puppet, some unusual sex games, a couple of appearances by Charlie Sheen as his contemporary self and later as a balding middle aged man, ending with the resolution of the triangle and a hint of a possible sequel.
503;I was entertained mainly because of the strong performances by Keener, Cusack, Malkovich and Diaz.
504;But Cusack's prospective life as a little girl was a chuckle to contemplate, and I couldn't help but applaud Keener's sly triumph.
505;This is an interesting film, and I recommend it to those who enjoy the antics of Monty Python, the egocentric humor of Woody Allen, and/or are John Cusack and John Malkovich fans.
506;Liberated women who like to see men get their just desserts will find this film amusing.
507;the cast is wonderful, I especially enjoyed Cameron Diaz in a non.
508;john Cusack and John Malkovich is .
509;, and a suitable role for Cusack following Grosse Pointe Blank and preceding his new film High Fidelity.
510;This is one of those rare exceptions, and a funny one to boot.
511;A film to be watched in one sitting, it is the perfect entertainment for a Friday evening, after a tough week.
512;is creativity for creativity's sake profound?
513;mind you this film is actually semi.
514;it's quirky and enjoyable, an adventure, with bittersweet connotations.
515;certainly it keeps good pace with itself and the character of maxine, whatever she's supposed to mean, is delectable for all she might imply about how desperate we all are.
516;This is an amusing movie.
517;How Craig could manipulate J. malkovich because of his career is kind of a MacGuffin, really.
518;For this movie to be ideal, it would have to have more genuine characters and emotions depicted.
519;It's dreamlike in the perfect way however, you just have to like it for what it is.
520;This movie is so utterly obscure and wonderful and confusing and non.
521;sensical, that it is certain to make you laugh.
522;this movie, riddled with marvelous performances and directing, may very well be the silliest, and is certainly one of the most wonderful movies of all time.
523;their circumstances are obviously surreal, but their reactions are totally believable.
524;i wish i could see it again for the first time.
525;carter burwell's themes are some of the most beautiful pieces of movie music i've heard in a long time.
526;the direction is perfectly unobtrusive (that's actually good sometimes!)
527;The whole thing reminds me of one of my favorite director's work: terry gilliam.
528;Most unusual is just thinking about the later part of the story, with Malkovich becoming the puppeteer, and how that would fit in real life.
529;"Screenwriter Charlie Kaufman, who sends up the creative block he experienced after writing the film's script in 2002's ""Adaptation"", plainly refuses to use any accepted cinematic convention to tell the wildly eccentric story of Craig Schwartz, a downtrodden puppeteer who has a must."
530;kilter, but Kaufman brings perceptive insight into all the major characters in ways that are completely unpredictable.
531;Director (and sometime actor) Spike Jonze is an inspired choice to lead the proceedings since he lends an almost verit .
532;style to the film making the lunacy seem human.
533;Casting is pure gold with a bedraggled.
534;this is wildly inventive filmmaking that may alienate several viewers, but it really should be embraced as the kind of bold experimentation that mainstream Hollywood rarely attempts.
535;"stress
536;"scenes work performed by puppet master Phil Huber
537;A genuinely entertaining package overall.
538;With Being John Malkovich this was one of those times.
539;grabbing is the bizarre and intriguing premise.
540;It is such an audacious idea, expertly executed, it grabs your attention right from the start, grabs you by the scruff of the neck and doesn't let go.
541;and the experience is breathtaking.
542;to me, what makes this film so fantastic, memorable and above all, unique, is its refreshing originality.
543;A film that is remarkably original, and, I believe also very hard to categorize.
544;It is so much more than that.
545;It works on so many levels.
546;This movie is only bested by Eyes Wide Shut in the year of 1999 for the best movie of the year.
547;This movie lets the creative juices flow with impunity.
548;It also works on so many levels, multiple viewings are a must.
549;It works as a satire, comedy, and drama.
550;The acting is this movie is excellent, John Cusack gives a great performence, Cameron Diaz becomes a housewife and is surprisingly thoroughly convincing.
551;The cameos are fantastic, there is one that is especially hilarious, I won't tell.
552;The best thing about this movie is that it convinces you of it's reality.
553;Great film, I give it my highest recommendation.
554;While it was very bizarre, it held my interest, and was a very original story with an amazing screenplay and the acting was pretty good too.
555;The acting all around was excellent.
556;This film was also very funny, I laughed alot.
557;I think Spike Jonze did a great job directing.
558;Which seems, from some of these reviews, to be a good thing.
559;I wound up watching it twice, once alone and once with my wife.
560;There's just enough inventiveness in this movie to keep it going, and yet avoid collapsing on itself.
561;A lot of the credit for that, I think, goes to the actors.
562;style workplace cynicism, to my favorite moment in the film: Diaz and Cusack both jump on Keener at the same time.
563;Still, the ending is haunting .
564;Take a look at the box, and see the larger picture.
565;You see a big head with a door leading into it.
566;it is in this environment that the title action takes place.
567;We then get a special treat at the title character also takes place, and how it's handled is very creative.
568;The last scenes are a bit confusing, but are open to a lot of creative interpretation.
569;Which is only fitting, as this is one very creative, very strange, very entertaining movie.
570;With Hollywood cranking out more mindless films each and every year, it's important to take some time to stop and appreciate those rare films that combine strong writing, inventive direction, fine acting and a unique story.
571;Being John Malkovich fits the bill.
572;The movie twists your understanding of the movies and leaves you wanting more.
573;Of course, that's also what makes it so much fun.
574;the film is director Spike Jonez's debut, but he makes the transition from music videos to cinema seamlessly.
575;shelf, with John Malkovich brilliantlty playing himself, the always excellent John Cusack and Cameron Diaz leading the way.
576;While mind switching and occupation may not be the freshest idea out there, the direction this movie goes is so original it's scary.
577;Both disturbing and entertaining, this movie succeeds on so many levels.
578;All I have to say is .
579;a. doubtly clever, innovating, refreshing and plain.
580;Being John Malkovich can only be classified as simply an incredible movie.
581;and not only is the story wonderful, every one of the performances is incredible.
582;Being John Malkovich shouldn't be missed, and if you have already seen it, it's worth another look.
583;OK Fine movie in its genre, with good acting, good ideas anddirection.
584;This movie really exists and it is called Being John Malkovich .
585;And, if there is one movie that we can call creative, this is the one.
586;Being John Malkovich is probably the most creative film ever made.
587;Directed by the video maker Spike Jonze, it will prove to you that being your own self is the best idea, even if you ever wanted to be someone else, with a brilliant and extremely original screenplay that surprises you from the beginning until the last minute of the film.
588;Watch the movie and you will be asking yourself how can a person create such a creative movie.
589;I had high expectations for this movie since the advertising on the box says it was nominated for 3 academy awards, and Roger Ebert said best movie of the year!
590;"He starts working in the ""seventh and a half"" floor of an enterprise."
591;One day he meets a beautiful woman at work (Catherine Keener) and he tries to attract her attention, but she ignores him.
592;He immediately tells all the story to that woman.
593;Everything is right then, but it happens that Cusack's wife uses it when the other woman is meeting John Malkovich.
594;"John Cusack's performance and Catherine Keener's are excellent
595;depicted, although it's a bit strange to watch her acting in a movie like this, and John Malkovich doesn't really act, because the movie deals about this person, but he shows himself as an interesting and mysterious man, and I think that is the reason of why so many people want to be him.
596;I found fantastic the scene in which he enters the secret door, and what surprise when he discovers a world dwelt by hundreds of copies of himself!This is a movie you can't stop watching, and it's worth doing it several more times.
597;Kauffman amazes us once more with his genius writing, Malkovich's acting is phenomenal and Jonze behind the camera can shoot the scenes as intended by Kauffman.
598;It is a very intelligent film and the theme and content are quite interesting.
599;There are a lot of good reviews though, so maybe I am missing something.
600;Criterion does it again, and gives the film the treatment it deserves with stunning image and sound.
601;I highly recommend to those who haven't seen it and those who already have.
602;This movie is so inventive that you'll wonder how screenwriter Charlie Kaufman thought of the concept.
603;Refreshingly modern, hip, giddy, funny, innovative and bursting with originality, you won't find any creative block here.
604;It is thoroughly original, hilarious and extremely and entertaining.
605;John Cusack is great as the pathetic pupeteer, and Cameron Diaz shows she can take good career risks with this unusual role for her.
606;But it is Catherine Keener and John Malkovich who give the film is's flavor.
607;Keener is the ultimate object of desire for everyone in the film and she delivers very funny lines and gives the best performance in the cast.
608;John Malkovich is also very funny playing himself, showing us that you can deliver a good performance even if you're playing an 'actor named John Malkovich'.
609;Great movie, one of the best of 1999.
610;From a scale of 1.10 I give this movie a 9!
611;This is a clever and imaginative story with a lot of droll and peculiar situations that make for an entertaining film.
612;He takes a job as a file clerk and discovers a portal that leads inside John Malkovich's head that allows him to see and experience what Malkovich is doing for 15 minutes until it spits him out on the New Jersey Turnpike.
613;this film goes beyond humor of the absurd to humor of the bizarre.
614;But the material is fresh and innovative and most of the skits work well, silly as they sometimes are.
615;spike Jonze is a strange guy with a strange sense of humor which is perfect for this film.
616;He does some very interesting things with the camera, lighting and setup that give the film a very distinctive look.
617;Clearly his work in music videos, where directors are a lot freer to push the creative envelope, helped in the making of this film.
618;I thought he could have done a better job with the Malkovich perspective (it looked like you were looking backwards through a pair of binoculars), but most of the camera work was quite good.
619;I particularly liked the way he split the sound tracks to have Malkovich's voice come out of the back speakers while in his perspective.
620;the acting in this film was terrific.
621;John Malkovich, who excels in both dramatic and comedic roles did a fabulous job of playing himself, poking fun at himself at every turn.
622;He was very funny as the tortured puppeteer.
623;overall, this film is a rollicking good time.
624;If you like absurd humor, you will love this film.
625;It explores the themes of identity.
626;in every day people, and their inner desires.
627;John Malkovich gets wind of the portal, and goes to experience it.
628;"At times this film has some fun moments: the scene where John Malkovich goes into his ""own"" portal to see what it is like is rather amusing."
629;He sees a line up of eagerly waiting customers.
630;Craig's first entrance into the portal as John Malkovich is comical.
631;What more can I say?With Being John Malkovich , Spike Jonze delivers a better first.
632;Whatever went on inside the mind of screenwriter Charlie Kaufman, the creativity that emerges in this film is the kind that audiences should get to see more often on the big screen.
633;kaufman's script is one of the best and most original of the 1990's.
634;provoking film highlighted by Catherine Keener's fantastic performance and John Malkovich's delightful self.
635;parody, is destined to become a cult classic.
636;take a trip into the portal.
637;I was very excited to see this film and wanted to like it, But it was so BORING.
638;life thespians but the characters.
639;A triumph of film making?
640;You still have to say this was one of the most intriguing movies ever.
641;Being John Malkovich (1999), the Spike Jonze's directorial debut, is an amazing film .
642;hip, inventive, delightfully weird, incredibly funny and disturbingly serious with the gleefully absurd plot twists.
643;Being John Malkovich is a fascinating and truly original film which I love and always enjoy watching even if there were never a connection with any of its characters (with the exception of Abelard and Heloise and Elijah the Chimp).
644;One of the best movies in recent memory, Bein John malkovich is certainly among the most original Hollywood films ever made.
645;Containing stunning visuals, positively confusing plot and hilarious situations, it is a ture masterpiece.
646;I want to go on record with how much I love this movie.
647;"Unlike probably most ""Being John Malkovich"" fans, I actually saw the later Kaufman."
648;"Well, yesterday I got through watching ""Being John Malkovich"" for the third time, about 2 years after I first saw it, and it's grown on me quite a bit."
649;"I still don't think it's quite as good as ""Adaptation"", but it's pretty close."
650;Being John Malkovich is one of those movies that seems to take place in the real world, except that there are a bunch of odd details that aren't right.
651;puppeteer who lives in depression with his strange but good.
652;(The ceiling is all of 4 1/2 feet high, and they have to emergency.
653;Beyond this, Kaufman has tons of clever, intelligent dialogue to support the wacky plot.
654;The unbelievable, oddball characters are all interesting, usually funny and often endearing.
655;Orson Bean is great as Dr. Lester, Craig's boss and a 125 year old lech.
656;Catherine Keener is fantastic as Maxine, one of the most black.
657;hearted characters I've ever seen.
658;Finally, John Malkovich is wonderful as himself (sort of), and he hits a great range of notes and isn't afraid to make himself look bad.
659;Though I can't help but see Kaufman as the primary author of the film, Jonze deserves a ton of credit for bringing the vision to fruition.
660;Making a film this wacky seem real must be damn near impossible, but Jonze pulls it off with aplomb and spectacular technical proficiency.
661;The score is also fantastic, truly beautiful and often.
662;moving, and it allows for a lot of the emotional impact in the film, particularly in the brilliantly conceived and heartbreaking final scene.
663;It's clever, but that's ALL it is.
664;serving cynicism to be funny.
665;i have friends who like BJM.
666;spirited film, and I hated it.
667;The first half was terrific: it appeared as if I was going to explore what it really meant to be me.
668;What fascinated me most about this film is it's originallity .
669;the script has such high I. q the viewer will have to see the movie several times to believe it .
670;Jonze directs his film with a speedy , bold way .
671;Scenes like the one where Diaz chases Keener into J. malkovich's subconscious memories or the one where Malkovich actually enters his own mind are hysterical moments of a creative banquet .
672;after dinner i'll introduce you to my chimp Elija ) are irresistably crazy and fun while all the cast delivers great perfomances .
673;including Cusack himself and his frowsy, animal.
674;This is one of those films that you sit back afterwards, take a deep breath, .
675;I don't think so), but with him in the title role, it's beautiful (and actually one of his best performances in recent years).
676;Charlie Kaufman has written an excellent and highly original script here.
677;and the brilliant direction by Jonze .
678;and you see what makes this the great film it is.
679;jonze's direction brings unexpected performances from well.
680;talents to begin with, are truly unforgettable in this film.
681;Once in a while a movie comes along that really challenges the mind.
682;It is a movie that differs from the usual formulas of filmmaking and develops its own genre.
683;Such fine examples would be David Lynche's Lost Highway and David Fincher's The Game .
684;Spike Jonze's Being John Malcovich is the most unusual film I believe I have ever seen.
685;One day he finds a door that takes you inside the head of actor John Malcovich for 15 minutes before dumping you on the Jersey turnpike.
686;there are good performances for this film even from Malcovich as himself.
687;Watch for Charlie Sheen's humorous cameo in the film as well.
688;This is just like some other dump fantastic movies.
689;OK watch this movie and see.
690;I loved this dark comedy about the thrilling experience of being John Malkovich.
691;The entire movie is surreal.
692;It is never predictable, sometimes very dark and pessimistic, and oh so delicious to watch.
693;What it all means is up to you.
694;Now that American culture has become so accustomed to movies that simply use formulaic ideas and contrived plot twists, this is a welcome return to the era of inventive filmaking.
695;Being John Malkovich is great in many aspects: it has great acting, a fresh plot, but most of all it succeeds in the surprise factor.
696;It's not completely unbound, however, and makes for a funny and thoroughly enjoyable movie experience.
697;overall, if you enjoy good movies, you must see this one!
698;It'll make you think, make you laugh, and it will probably make you dizzy.
699;Now for a film to carry off that premise the script had better be good and make some sort of sense in its context.
700;This is the most original film I have seen in literally YEARS!
701;Ignore this week's Julia Roberts assembly line product and see this modern cult classic!
702;Watch this movie, if only for this scene!
703;I mean, WHAT A FILM!
704;Being John Malkovich defies objective analysis.
705;It is totally unique .
706;But thank God they did, because this film is the most outrageously original, absurd, thought.
707;provoking and hilarious mainstream film released in years.
708;the genius of Being John Malkovich is that it is played totally straight.
709;"and Charlie Kaufman scriptwriter and Spike Jonze director have dished up exactly what we want
710;I like a lot of movies.
711;Spike Jonze did a great job of directing and the film had some ideas never presented before in hollywood.
712;not even John Malavich is entertaining in this film.
713;as always cameron diaz is the best, she plays wonderfully.
714;The story is a little strange, but it's captivating.
715;I'm giving it three stars only because of John Cusack, one of my favorite actors.
716;The amazing introduction in which we watch two puppets conducted by versatile hands works out into perfection because the best is yet to come.
717;this is one of those few films you love from the first five minutes running time.
718;This a genial cross between Terry Gilliam, Luis Buuel and Woody Allen.
719;who lands in the intimate territory of John Malkovich 's mind.
720;john Cussack is terrific in his role.
721;He is nowadays, one of the most versatile and talented actors of the American Cinema.
722;Cameron D az is brilliant as the neurotic wife and finally a sincere ovation for the artistic direction.
723;Some majorly creative thinking produced this MAJORLY creative movie.
724;I remembered I liked it and, after just watching it again, I liked it again.
725;ALL performances are strong (John Cusack, Cameron Diaz, Catherine Keener and Orson Bean).
726;And enter it they do.
727;BUT, I liked it and think it's funny.
728;And that's all this movie has going for it.
729;cusack is erratic and ingenious as always and diaz is incredibly subtle, but really gets your attention later on.
730;malkovich (also great in Shadow of the Vampire) is simply amazing, especially in the restaurant scene which is odd, but believable in a contradictory sort of way.
731;charlie sheen makes a surprising cameo which is really funny.
732;the whole uniqueness of this film is really hard to explain, its best if you watch it.
733;some people will think it's too screwball insert cusack film here, but others will really watch it with an open mind and see all the things of this film's ingenuity.
734;great acting all the way around, interesting story, plot twists, comedy most of all, and one of the best 1999 films by far (however the all.
735;time best is american beauty, but i wont go into that.
736;imagine for a moment that you find a strange door somewhere, and once you enter, you become John Malkovich, and see his world through his eyes.
737;Throughout this odd sojourn into J. m.'s mind and body is an odd love triangle between Cusack, Keener, and Cusack's wife, played by Cameron Diaz.
738;This movie is just funny.
739;The characters and how the interact is just hilarious.
740;It kept me entertained, as I hope was the point of the movie, because if there really was a deeper side to this movie I missed it.
741;it's kind of like one of the movie adapts of Alice in Wonderland.
742;i did not fully understand the ending, and it was a bit disturbing, but still, a hilarious film.
743;In this Spike Jonze film, you can be anything you want.
744;Real movie buffs will appreciate the zany humor and brilliance of this film.
745;The concept is so original and so intelligent and almost silly at the same time.
746;Oh yeah it makes you think about persepective, mind control, and the soul but it also makes you laugh while doing so.
747;American Beauty was an amazing satire about America facing its own suburban nightmare.
748;This is hands down, the funniest film I've seen from '99.
749;I wasn't sure anything could top Election, but Spike Jonze's Being John Malkovich is such a funny, inventive, revolutionary film, that it was no surprise it affected me the way it did.
750;Well, that applies to every character in the film, and the wonderful thing about it all is that they all compliment each other and enhance the story enormously.
751;catherine Keener and Cameron Diaz are wonderful.
752;Keener can play cool like no one else and Diaz is great in the role of sensitive Lotte.
753;the film is visually stunning, the musical score is appropriately sullen and magical.
754;Spike Jonze created a world I'd never seen before and even more incredibly, it made me really appreciate puppetry!
755;The fact is this should have won Best Picture.
756;Spike Jones has directed a brilliant script by Charlie Kaufman.
757;"John Cusack (so great in ""The Grifters"" and ""Bullets Over Broadway"") gives his finest performance here."
758;John Malkovich and Catherine Keener deliver great performances .
759;Cameron Diaz (never a favorite) proves herself a considerable actress.
760;The editing, art direction, sound and score are all terrific.
761;The last great film of the twentieth century?
762;Certainly the best film of 1999.
763;This film is well worth seeing just on its merit as a comedy.
764;Many of the jokes remind me of THE SIMPSONS (a _good_ thing), and yet the film definitely transcends these limits.
765;the questions about and examination of identity, infatuation, sexual desire, and the value of one's life are there in spades, though no clear resolution comes of it.
766;Some of the camera work is simply stunning, esp.
767;the opening sequence and John Malkovich's dance sequence.
768;If you appreciate cinematography and crisp direction, this film will be right up your alley.
769;The film is deeply funny because of the grossness of the concrete realization of the argument of the plot.
770;Then the plot is absolutely funny.
771;It is based on one person being able to crawl inside another person and impose his or her personality onto that other person.
772;In a way it is perverted since a woman can live her love for another woman by accepting her to be in the man that is the vessel of that intruder or invader.
773;If the man is invaded by a woman and has a personal relationship with another woman, the two women are making love, to the point of procreating a girl, their daughter.
774;Then it shows that success in our society does not depend on the value you have but on the value the public persona you are living in has.
775;If you live in the body of a great person anything you will do will be successful and seen at once as great.
776;Blessed be the gullible, .
777;So all in all a funny film that makes you feel at times kind of ill at ease.
778;OK, I understand the message behind this film, that we're all obsessed with celebrity and that we should be happy with who we are, But this film was too weird and misleading to me.
779;And how Catherine Keener got an Oscar nomination is beyond me.
780;This dazzling portrayal of identity and exploitation can only be described as a contrasted work.
781;To call this film clever wouldn't even touch on the whirlpool of fascinating themes it concocts.
782;It is both dreamlike and truthful.
783;It is both scathingly funny and undeniably beautiful.
784;It is so profoundly honest about the world that these not.
785;ordinary folk inhabit and yet so aware of the audiences apprehension to relate to these characters.
786;we see a thrilling chase through a literal myriad of the private memories of a well known actor.
787;And yet as we witness this, there is something that is always maintained, no matter how wild and untamed the story grows, and that is the undying humanity of these characters, the incredibly poignant truth that is undoubtedly the core of this movie.
788;This film is a remarkable landmark in both screenwriting and direction, something that will not be matched for many years to come.
789;This movie initially demonstrates a great deal of promise.
790;I was very excited to see it, I had heard great things about the movie's creative premise.
791;This is a great movie for people who aren't offended by husbands locking up their wives while they go to pursue other women.
792;Another distinctive memory is the creative puppeteer making lewd public display (on a sidewalk) of lust between a nun and a priest.
793;This is a true story, it is based on my life.
794;And now he goes to jail for life.
795;Being John Malkovich is real.
796;He will die in jail and hang himself with a bedsheet.
797;He will also die in jail.
798;Matt is yellow and has Hep C. Go to his house and take a look.
799;So does Captain Madonna, Pecko, Brian Wearshing, Brian Slattery, Pete Beisser, Dave O'Brien, Brandon Rickards, Jackie Edwards and Edward Basile and everyone else that set foot in my house.
800;worthy moments infused in the humor and oddity of the film.
801;After finishing the movie, it was on repeat so I started watching scenes from the beginning again and everything just ties in so perfectly!
802;Definitely worth watching at least once!
803;And I recommend watching it twice.
804;I had forgotten how good of a movie this is.
805;This film is an example not just of Great actiing but incredibly original writing.
806;Just see this film Because it is one of the funniest and Greatest films of all time.
807;Being John Malkovich is an inventive comic fantasy about a struggling puppeteer who finds, on the 7 floor of his office building a doorway into the mind of John Malkovich.
808;Very well thought out and enjoyable, with a great cast including John Cusack, Cameron Diaz and John Malkovich.
809;"this offbeat comedy is full of offbeat special features including the ""7 Floor Orientation"" and ""An Intimate Portrait of the Art of Puppeteering."""
810;overall, if you're looking for a smart, inventive comedy, then definitely watch this movie.
811;There were some very good scenes: Malkovich inside himself, the A E Biography.
812;One inventive scene follows another in this dark comedy from writer Charlie Kaufman and Director Jonze.
813;For a few glosious years in the late nineties, Hollywood was informed by the spirit of independent films.
814;This was one of the top results.
815;The film is funny both in the traditional sense, with clever dialogue and semi.
816;"normal situations
817;Furthermore, the unusual circumstances of the story make it engrossing, since it is literally impossible to predict what might happen next.
818;This truly makes for an adventure in film.
819;There's a brilliant idea at the core of Being John Malkovich, and when I first saw this flick I expected to like it a LOT.
820;What should be touching is handled with sledgehammer finesse.
821;I wish I could give this movie both five stars and one star.
822;On one hand, I love the world the movie sets up.
823;headed with their own ideas.
824;If you haven't seen this, and you're at all curious, I recommend seeing it.
825;I was moved by Magnolia.
826;The film works on so many levels.
827;it is a screwball comedy, an existential discussion of the nature of existence, a study of sexual identity, and a satire of the modern desire to escape from life.
828;On top of all of that, it is darn entertaining to watch!The characters (played to perfection but Cusack, Diaz, Keener, and Malkovich himself) are all well.
829;drawn, and the actors do a fantastic job.
830;the directing is top notch as well.
831;Spike Jonze (of Three Kings fame) has made a wise choice.
832;he did everything that had to be done to make the film, and he did it well (note his Oscar nod for best director).
833;the production design is a big star here as well.
834;the best word to describe this film is giddy.
835;I saw that because that is what I brought away from it.
836;I felt giddy watching it, and you can teel the cast and crew felt the same making it.
837;i would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a lot of quirkiness in their movies.
838;which we must accept that comes right from the childhood fairy tale.
839;i found this aspect hysterical and trippy.
840;I am impressed she is willing to do these comedy parts that take her out of the realm of just being a beauty.
841;i found extremely funny that fact that no one could remember any of the the productions that Malcovich has been in.
842;I mean, here is a top actor, and yet.
843;somehow, there is some truth to this.
844;That John M. was willing to goof on that was fun.
845;Oh, I loved this movie.
846;Intensely interesting, mostly quirky, and a great piece of film.
847;John Malkovich gives a glowing performance, as does John Cusak.
848;Cameron Diaz is understated, as per the character, and absolutely brilliant.
849;A refreshing look at the psyche.
850;A fun and fascinating piece.
851;She is seriously into animals and the two live with a menagerie in their home.
852;and there he finds the portal that leads to John Malcovich's mind.
853;Things take a turn when Cusack falls in love with Keener, but Keener is in love with Diaz.
854;I love John Malkovich however the characters portrayed by Cameron Diaz and John Cuzak did NO JUSTICE to their otherwise reputable acting careers.
855;but there are many movies that I think they did an excellent job in .
856;Scholars and theologians alike constantly debate free will and fate, but their studies concern the will of a greater being.
857;Incredible performances by all of the cast, especially Malkovich, purposely remaining the flattest character in the movie.
858;See it to discover what happens when we start pulling other people's strings, how our lives are affected, and what the intoxicating feeling of control can drive people to do.
859;It is a fresh and funny.
860;I really liked this movie.
861;I reallylike unusual films that you can't make much sense of them like Brazilor Fight Club and Being John Malkovich is right up there, it's abouta puppeteer named Craig (John Cusack) and his obsession for his partnerMaxine (Cathrine Keener) who doesn't really like him much, her waysof making him feel like 2 cents are hilarious.
862;Oh yeah and Maxine is in love withCraig's wife, well when she's in Malkovich.
863;The result is a wacky, funny and very originalfilm with unusual charactors.
864;A really good start for Spike Jonze,he should have a great career behind him if he makes more films asoriginal as this.
865;since his videos are very offbeat yet fun and stylish I thought that he would bring that same appeal to the big screen.
866;there he leads into a portalinto the mind of actor John Malkovich.
867;he,his witty co. worker(Catherine Keener) and eccentric,pet.
868;but to point out the postive points,I can say that Jonze's wry,(VERY) offbeat humor and the film's sparse direction is creative and at times,strangely enticing.
869;the movie had multiple messages that were often times funny and disturbing.
870;For my money, this was the best picture of the year (1999), a startling piece with some great acting performances that left the competition in the dust along the Jersey Turnpike.
871;in Being John Malkovich, the premise of the movie is hysterical and unique.
872;haired Cameron Diaz (in a wonderful casting about.
873;Malkovich playing himself was a riot, and I loved the appearance of Charlie Sheen in a self.
874;He has managed to make a movie that puts the human mind on trial.
875;Throughout the movie there's never any slapstick humor, but much darker humor and every scene will make one laugh and be in complete awe.
876;Everyone was simply not normal, which I find to be rare in movies.
877;this movie is an Original masterpiece, and is well worth the price for anyone who wants to get away from Hollywood standards.
878;It's one of the most bizarre, inventive, incredible, original and hilarious films to come along in years, heck, even decades!
879;One of the greatest films of 1999.
880;If you are tired of the typical Hollywood comedy, give this truly orginal film a chance.
881;Spike Jonze, the director, has pieced together a modern classic.
882;I had the wonderful experience of seeing this film without knowing *anything* about it.
883;This strangely inventive surrealistic comedy was the inaugural collaboration between onetime music.
884;video director Jonze and talented screenwriter Charlie Kaufman.
885;With such a bizarre concept, this film could have sent audiences home scratching their own noggins, but Cusack, Keener, and an unrecognizable Diaz have a bright, wonderful chemistry that shines through all the head.
886;"Clever, inspired, and extremely funny, ""Malkovich"" is cinema."
887;mirror, and the effect is dizzying.
888;Very entertaining in a demented kind of way.
889;Up until now, I thought the two most inventive movies of 1999 were Fight Club and Magnolia.
890;Now that I've seen Being John Malkovich, I realize it is not only the most inventive film of 1999, it's one of the most inventive films EVER!
891;It is hilarious, beautiful, touching and down right bizarre, all at once.
892;Every single frame, every single line spoken, every single character in this movie is unlike any other movie ever!
893;It really is a work of art.
894;definitely worth the price of admission.
895;Being John Malkovich is an original, funny movie full of plot twists.
896;The most interesting aspect of the film was the way it showed that Craig's talent in in puppeteering was a valid art form.
897;The movie begins with an amazing puppet sequence where we get a glimpse of Craig's talent.
898;Not until he is able to use the notoriety of Malkovich, is he able to show the world what the artistry of puppeteering is really about.
899;I think this is true in the real world as well.
900;Those who like to exercite their minds, here's a nice gymn.
901;Keep an open mind marvel at how unattractive Cameron Diaz is portrayed here.
902;This film is a wonderful introduction into the amazingly out.
903;there writing style of Charlie Kaufman, who reached an even better level with his Oscar nominated film Adaptation last year.
904;definitely give this at least one viewing.
905;but it's well worth it.
906;about the nature of self, about the existence of a soul.
907;Being John is, without a doubt, one of the best films ever made.
908;Director Spike Jonze plays with the concepts of twisted relationships and living out fantasies (and the dangers therein) with remarkable skill.
909;This film sustains interest from start to finish and contains a myriad of facets for the viewer to explore, it definitely demands mutliple viewings.
910;The acting in superb with the entire cast playing their roles to perfection but John Cusack is particularly brilliant as the puppeteer suffering from chronic ennui.
911;To me it's nice to see art prevail in a commercial glutted field.
912;Charlie Kaufman has an absolutely sick imagination and I am pretty amazed that this movie ever got made.
913;Basically, a great movie, but they could have done MUCH better on the presentation and special features.
914;Being John Malkovich was one of the most critically acclaimed and original films of 1999.
915;and spins it into What if you could be one of the greatest living actors?
916;You can enter the portal and for five minutes see the world through the eyes of Malkovich.
917;"Malkovich (as himself) is great
918;All the performances are strong, although I thought Diaz was better than Keener and probably deserved a nomination a little more.
919;comedy in the classic sense.
920;but some of them are pretty funny.
921;This was the debut film by Spike Jonze, who had previously found success directing music videos.
922;Oscar winner Charlie Kaufman (Best Original Screenplay, 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind') penned the movie, so if you've seen the aforementioned film or Adaptation.You know what you're in for.
923;bowl, her animals, his stories as performed by his puppets.
924;this takes into another world as Craig finds a portal/door into John Malkovich's mind.
925;All the true characteristics of the main characters start coming out.
926;john Malkovich delights in this role .
927;He steals the title and the movie!!
928;John Cusack's performance is understated.
929;This is a real movie, watch it and go away thinking.
930;A very well put together film.
931;A classic alongside Gilliam and Kubrick's works.
932;The screenplay is extremely creative but to me it tries to hard to cover too much ground, too many themes.
933;If you haven't seen it yet, you're denying yourself a definite pleasure.
934;One of the greatest head trips I've ever been on, fantastic stuff.
935;Being John Malkovich attracted more attention to cinema.
936;goers than both the two films did, and while they are extremely good ones, did not deserve to get nominated over this almost.
937;perfect crowdpleaser, which should've got nominated for Best Picture and at least 7 other awards.
938;this film is not only an immediate classic as I said earlier, but it's the best movie idea of the 20th century.
939;And the script should've got more attention than it did, ditto the performances from Keener, Malkovich, Diaz and Cusack, all lighting up the screen with comical and enjoyable performances.
940;Spike Jonze's direction however, was most successful for a debut, and the world is now dying for his next feature.
941;But, at the end of the day, Charlie Kaufman's script is the part of this excellent film that makes it really worth watching, his comically ingenious writing is ultimately bizarre, but inspiringly clever and mind.
942;I watched it with my horror club and we enjoyed it immensely.
943;John Malkovich and John Cusak are amazing, although I did not recognize Cameron Diaz.
944;There are several plot twists as well.
945;So when I viewed the movie, together with my husband, it was really a pleasant surprise!We all know how unique the screenplay was, no need to go into details.
946;Just imagine how you can enjoy watching a movie when most of the characters seemed alien to you.
947;you did actually enjoy it!It's funny, at the same time sad, to realize how people are so dissatisfied with their own lives would even pay to be someone else, even for a very short time.
948;to think that the people we admire are happy content in their shell is a big misnomer as well!
949;At a glance, it is funny because the characters acted weird comic.
950;I had heard so much about this film and i was an admirer of Spike Jonze's music videos, Sabotage, And Praise you by Fatboy Slim, i thought were both hilarious.
951;So i was expecting a bit of the same, and defintely received it.
952;The beginning of the film is hilarious, the speech impediment secretary i thought was great, and the 7.5 floor was hilarious as well.
953;The other amazing things to this film was the puppeteering, incredible, i never knew it could be so artistic.
954;I was gripped, ready for a good funny film.
955;As far as originality it was a great film, amazing concept, but the turns of the storyline just bugged and depressed me.
956;And i'm not afraid of stranger films, one of my fav is Time Bandits but this film just didn't go in a direction that appealed to me, it lacked fun.
957;And I must admit: the scene where Malkovich goes through the portal and into his own brain is insanely inspired and absolutely hilarious, and almost makes the film justifiable.
958;This is an insipidly clever film about NOTHING, which, for a generation raised on *Seinfeld* and other facile entertainments, will undoubtedly stand as a seminal work.
959;The plot is unique and the acting is good.
960;overall it was a film worth watching, however.
961;It sounded nutty and fun, weird in a good way.
962;John Malkovich does have his moments, and Charlie Sheen was a nice touch.
963;I disliked them and I disliked the performances of the actors who played them.
964;Malcovich malcovich, malcovich?There were many excellent movies last year.
965;The writing was amazing and the concept, while not something I hadn't thought about before, was something I had never thought about in that way.
966;the actors do an amazing job of being ordinary and Malcovich does a wonderful job of playing himself in the strangest of situations.
967;This is a great movie.
968;"This film, in case you don't already know, is excellent
969;that out of the way, the movie itself is as good as ever, and could also be found in a non.
970;the highlight of the package has to be Lance Bang's Making of Doc of the movie.
971;in fact that's most likely the best way to describe this movie and this package in general.
972;An amazing triumph in film making.
973;Spike Jonze makes the transfer from music videos to film masterfuly and this si the most imaginative film i have ever seen.
974;Very very funny and at some moments touching.

984;Being John Malkovich is an ingenious dark comedy about three oddball characters who discover a hidden portal which sucks you into the mind of John Malkovich (played by himself).
985;Bizare, huh?John Cusack plays Craig, a frusterated and very talented puppeteer in New York who lives in a tiny apartment that's crowded by a bunch of numerous animals (Apes, dogs, birds etc), courtesy from his weirdo, animal.
986;Sure, it has amusing moments, but it's the film's original screenplay and terrific performances that leave you hooked.
987;But if you're really into film, I definitely recommend.
988;This movie takes you into the head of John Malkovich, literally.
989;It was such a surprise at how intrigued I was by this movie.
990;I rated it 5 stars because it was absolutely amazing.
991;I just watched it last night and have already recommended it to everyone I know.
992;It is easily the best movie of 1999, and fully deserved its three Oscar nominations.
993;Catherine Keener and Cameron Diaz also put in fine performances.
994;Although it has it's funny moments, these are subtly played .
995;The overall premise is pure fantasy and requires suspension of disbelief but if you are prepared to go along with it, this movie is well worth seeing.
996;It takes place in a moving car and he ends up getting out and vomiting.
997;It easily slots into my top 10 movies.
998;One of the most original movies I have ever seen.

1001;This movie is clever, witty, raised some interesting questions and above all is the most bizarre movie that you will ever come across.
1002;If you're looking for something entertaining and off the beaten track then this is it.
1003;And yet, it's received accolades from critics everywhere.
1004;I've never seen anything so innovative and creative in my life!John Cusak stars as an out.
1005;Catherine Keener is the sassy woman they both find attractive.
1006;How the writer, Charlie Kaufman, ever thought up the premise is amazing.
1007;And the director, Spike Jonze, certainly knew how to make it all fit together.
1008;this is a comedy with depth.
1009;And the laughs and insights keep getting better.
1010;There's an office building with a floor numbered 7.1/2.

1014;And that's just one of the many sub.
1015;It might sound silly, but as a viewer I was completely there with the story all the way, letting myself enjoy the twists and turns of the plot that just kept getting better as this intriguing tale moved along.

1023;The plot was so imaginative.
1024;If you want to expand your mind and be entranced by an incredibly creative movie, check it out.
1025;while I'm not a fan of all those films, they at least tried something new, and Being John Malkovich stood head and shoulders above the crowd as the weirdest, most original film of the year.
1026;And, to these eyes, the best.
1027;First of all, it contains the movie.
1028;It has the trailer, which hooked many of us the moment we saw it: This looks completely twisted.
1029;I have to see it.
1030;It even has a segment on the real.
1031;This is one of the coolest, most bizarrely funny movies I have ever seen.
1032;Charlie Kaufman wrote a brilliant screenplay and all the actors do a wonderful job as characters who develop such an anguish over their own existence.
1033;I love that it is a totally original tale.
1034;This is the movie to restore your faith in all that is modern American cinema.
1035;In a time when so many movies are either remakes of stories we've heard time and time again, or they just feel that way, this movie is a breath of fresh air.
1036;yet here just serve to provide a lovely aura of unpredictability that will keep one guessing.
1037;Clearly, a stellar movie, and one for the home library if at all possible, because you'll want to view it again.
1038;It is a fun trip that raises many thoughtful questions.
1039;This day job changes both their lives as Cusack discovers a portal that leads to John Malkovich's head.
1040;But then again, at least in the movie, Malkovich is anything but in his right mind.
1041;this movie is best watched late at night.
1042;Most of the scenes are in fact shot at nighttime, adding positively to the surreal effect of the story.
1043;Cusack, Diaz, and Malkovich turn in wonderful performances.
1044;Catherine Keener is suitably hateable as the selfish Maxine.
1045;this movie encourages you to look deep beneath the surface of a person.

1062;I laughed so much the first time I saw it that I missed some key lines, so watching it again a couple of times has made me appreciate it more.
1063;It's not often that a movie so clearly illuminates the dark side of the human condition and at the same time displays such youthful innocence.
1064;this movie is totally whacky and wonderful, forget the metaphysical, philosophical meanings and everything else.
1065;this is one very hilarious movie.
1066;the plot is quirky, but what stands out are the brilliant lines, great situations and absolutely outstanding acting.
1067;catherine keener has the most attractive role and she does full justice, cameron diaz in a deglamorized role shines.
1068;apart from the acting, the quirky movie is radiant with brilliant humor that makes one laugh out loud.
1069;the weirdness of the situations get more and more complex and are very well handled by the director spike jonze.
1070;it was a fun movie.
1071;I'm usually easily entertained when it comes to movies, because I don't usually expect very much of them (at least the stuff that normally comes out of Hollywood as compared to various independent directors).
1072;It's rare that I really rave about a film, but I have to admit I was impressed with how original and unusual this film was.
1073;A lot of films are pretty predictable, but this one isn't, and the film had me wondering what kind of wacky and funny hijinx or scene would come up next.
1074;The film also playfully explores some pretty profound questions relating to identity, consciousness, the afterlife, and so on.
1075;And on top of that there's a kinky scene or two that are pretty over the top just by themselves.
1076;given all the above, I would have to count this as one of the more intelligent, unusual, and funny movies to come out in recent memory.
1077;also, it's great to see Orson Bean is still working, and actually, I thought he looked pretty good for his age in the movie.
1078;Well, I'm not sure really what the difference is between humor and comedy, but this movie certainly has them both in spades and it was very obvious he had a lot of fun making the movie too.
1079;Overall, a very unusual, outrageous, and entertaining film that I suspect will become a cult classic.

1081;Talk to people about this movie and they will tell you that it is weird, and others that it is brilliant.
1082;in this case, I sided with those who thought it was brilliant.
1083;a production has to be brilliant in order to allow you to laugh through some of the delicate topics this movie addresses.

1085;Guaranteed to make you think while having a GREAT laugh!
1086;Intelligent, super suave, extraordinarily attractive, a true gentleman (or so he seems), superior actor.
1087;I'm a fan of John Malkovich and when I heard that he was going to be in the movie that bore his name I had to see it.
1088;it has a couple funny lines, but overall this is just a bizarre movie.
1089;Fortunately, it also has a talented cast that plays it straight, proving that the small laughs can be the best.
1090;John Cusack is great, as always .
1091;The success of this movie lies in large part with John Malkovich himself, who is not only gracious enough to lend himself to the premise, but who is subjected time and again to humiliating little potshots that provide some of the film's funniest moments ( Malkovich, think fast! )
1092;The first half of the movie is definitely the best, as the viewer is placed in one delightfully bizarre scenario after another, and the Maxine character ultimate bogs the whole thing down a little (What does she want?
1093;This is a great movie for those who are kind of burned out on movies, in that it shows that there are still some good ideas out there waiting to be discovered.
1094;"Charlie Kaufman has the distinction of writing the two most deranged screenplays I know of with ""Adaptation"" and it's predecessor, ""Being John Malkovich""."
1095;four fantastic performances are given by John Cusack, Cameron Diaz, Catherine Keener and Malkovich himself, and they are guided by Spike Jonze' direction and Mr. Kaufman's screenplay.
1096;The film opens with a marionette performance so poignant it seems nearly human .
1097;In White Nights it takes a moment before you recognize that you are watching a performance of a ballet, and in this film the marionette is so life.
1098;"sized marionette is made to ""dance"" the lead role in ""Swan Lake"" surrounded by human ballerinas."
1099;She works in a pet store and keeps a collection of animals including a dog, ferret, bird and chimpanzee .
1100;Diaz' Lotte is the kind of person who forms close emotional ties with animals but has more difficulty being intimate with other humans.
1101;"the kind of quirky little thing added in just for ""flavor"" in this film."
1102;an attractive but sarcastic New York woman who has had it with most men, and Cusack's Craig Schwartz certainly seems like most men to her.
1103;on my second viewing of the movie my greatest regard is for John Malkovich himself, who not only allows himself to be spoofed, but participates in the spoofing with great gusto.
1104;I loved you in that movie where you played the jewel thief.
1105;"(Fans of ""Sex and the City"" will enjoy the moment when Willie Garson walks by Malkovich in a restaurant and compliments him on his performance in the movie where he played ""that retard"".)"
1106;Now one of my favorite John Malkovich movies is the one that bears his name.
1107;This is possibly one of the most overrated films I have ever seen.
1108;The plot is a meandering shambles and the best thing in it is Charlie Sheen!
1109;Is it a satire on the nature of celebrity or a surreal sci.
1110;It was so wierd I had to finish watching it the whole way through.
1111;I really found it quite entertaining.
1112;John Malkovich is one of the best actors of the 20th century and his acting is superb.
1113;I have a feeling this is one of those films you either love or hate, but try watching it.
1114;I liked the menu design, clever tv spots (one soo weird it sticks in your brain forever) and the documentaries.
1115;sorta funny, but come on.
1116;Funny ideas, but they're done soo seriously that we're not sure whether to take them as a joke.
1117;If you just want good extra feautures.
1118;Everything about this movie was great, the cast, plot, tone.
1119;All the while, Cusack has been obsessed with Catherine Keener's character, Maxine, and so has Cusack's wife, Diaz.
1120;It is such a nice break when a movie as original as this comes along.
1121;The plot of the movie is terrific and the casting was done very well.

1124;Absolutely hysterical, and easily one of the best and most enjoyable films of the year.
1125;This was a surprisingly good film.
1126;When I did I'd have to say this one one of the top five films of the year.
1127;The direction of this film was outstanding and the use of acting and imagery was great.
1128;Then, decades from now, people can look back and see a unique sample of where originality was at the end of the Twentieth Century.
1129;Obviously, it fits in fine in mine.

1135;If the story is to your taste, there is more good news.
1136;time director Spike Jonze, who made a name for himself doing music videos and commercials, is an astounding talent.
1137;He has learned a lot in his twenty.
1138;As a film buff, the icing of the cake is John Malkovich.
1139;A great special edition that doesn't overdo it, the best since the Criterion edition of Rushmore.
1140;The movie takes a very slow pace, but adds in enough detail to keep it interesting the whole way.
1141;The big name stars in this movie, Cusack and Diaz, are directed in such a way that you don't recognize them as themselves, so the only real focus on celebrity is Malkovich himself.
1142;Using his experience as a puppeteer, Cusack finally decides to possess Malkovich and stay there, having learned how to physically control him.
1143;There are many other elements to the story, of course, but they are best discovered by the viewer.
1144;I started out watching this movie expecting a great comedy, based on the reviews.
1145;Well, I enjoyed the concept of the movie.
1146;I liked the in depth look at puppeteering.

1148;Being John Malkovich now takes its rightful place among the greatest movies of all time.

1150;on many levels (Charlie Sheen's self.
1151;depricating cameo is a revelation).
1152;And it's a wonderful drama.
1153;ask anyone why he or she liked this film and the standard answer is I thought it was interesting.
1154;malkovich and Cusack should be ashamed of themselves.
1155;If you're somewhat rational and intelligent.
1156;like Lord of the Rings for example.
1157;Ok, well hope this is a helpful review.
1158;in a world where Titanics and Phantom Menaces are made and praised, this is a more than welcome change.
1159;I don't do drugs, but this movie sure made me feel like I did.
1160;I felt all the experiences of a druggy: the highs and the lows.
1161;I tell you, this movie definitely makes you feel like you're ON DRUGS.
1162;I want to be John Malkovich and this movie is killer fun.
1163;Cusack is great as Schwartz, the man who finds out theres a door leading into Malkovich's brain.
1164;There's a lot of great moments including when John Malkovich goes inside his owen brain.
1165;"First, a note of explanation on the title to this review: it is my impression that we live in something of a dark age of filmmaking, in which the merely mediocre is exalted as ""original"" and ""compelling."""
1166;the movie succeeds best as a very black sort of comedy.
1167;if you enjoy the spectacle of uniformly reprehensible characters enacting a series of escapades winding down to an ending with no sense of justice, of anyone getting their due (and I often do), you might enjoy this film.

1170;Final kudos to whoever came up with the idea of high.
1171;this should have won best picture.
1172;the spike jonze interview is the funniest thing on the disc.
1173;John Cusack, Jonze, Malkovich , and Kauffman are gods!
1174;Being John Malkovich is easily one of the most original films ever made.
1175;His sexy, tempestuous co. worker played by Catherine Keener is along for the ride, and his wife (Cameron Diaz) is involved with both.
1176;the idea behind this film is brilliant, but the most fun of all comes from watching Malkovich himself endure this bizarre situation.
1177;The cast and the special effects are the two best features of this film, and Malkovich should win some type of award for being such a good sport.
1178;Unfortunately, the story sputters a little near the end, but for its originality and bizarreness , this is definitely worth seeing.
1179;Being John Malkovich, directed by Spike Jonze from a screenplay by Charlie Kaufman, was in my opinion one of the most brilliant films of the late 20th century.
1180;work puppeteer (an excellent John Cusack) who discovers a portal into the mind of actor John Malkovich (played, curiously enough, by John Malkovich!)
1181;bending love story, and an innovative blending of science fiction and fantasy.
1182;Furthermore, the film is a reflection on interspecies communication and the nature of language, a metaphysical exploration of the nature of life and identity, and a somber meditation on the role of the artist in a consumeristic society.
1183;cusack and Malkovich are joined by a superb ensemble cast that brings complete conviction to this bizarre material.
1184;"Orson Bean is particularly hilarious as Cusack's daffy, horny boss
1185;bJM is as notable for its stunning visual effects as it is for its amazing dialogue.
1186;Also marvelous are the parodic films within a film that spice up the whole.
1187;And the film is nicely enhanced by Carter Burwell's fine musical score.
1188;"bJM is imaginative and truly original
1189;I give it my highest recommendation.
1190;This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen, and kids, I've seen all the funny movies.
1191;Easily the most endlessly creative film I have ever seen.
1192;Spike Jonze is one of the new great directors.
1193;Any fan of Terry Gilliam and the Coen Brothers MUST see this film!
1194;Quirky is not the word to describe, for it transcends all things quirky and becomes something much more profound.
1195;I did, and the experience was more enjoyable than I could have imagined.
1196;Also contains one of the best cameo appearences in the history of film.
1197;"(Don't ruin it for yourself
1198;I like John Cusack and I like the whole idea, so I really had high hopes.
1199;While it dealt with the implications of getting in someone's head and Cusack's character's growing dependence on it, it was funny and interesting.
1200;Its just the story of an unemployed puppeteer (a very good one too, the stuff he does is amazing!
1201;Now it does begin to get mad and weird, but in a good and even convincing way.
1202;She loves it so much she decides that she has discovered the inner man in her, and wants to have corrective surgery!
1203;(She wants to discuss the procedure with her doctor, an allergist!)
1204;Also, John Malkovich playing John Malkovich is really something to see .
1205;The ending is good, with a little twist that surprises right at the end.
1206;overall, this is a really funny and surreal, but very accessible film.
1207;Definitely one of the best of the year, it really stands out from the usual offerings of action, love and sci.
1208;the premise of the movie was OKAY from a totally creative standpoint.
1209;I had good expectation for this movie.
1210;All in all, too clever for its own good.
1211;"I remember first hearing about ""Being John Malkovich"" more than a year before it was released to theatres."
1212;This second experience leads me to a conclusion that dovetails nicely with one of the film's major themes: I'm not the same person now as I was then.
1213;director Spike Jonze and screenwriter Charlie Kaufman realize their vision with exuberance and melancholy, which, although paradoxical emotions, make an easy fit together.
1214;Jonze, he who cut his teeth on Beastie Boy, Weezer, and Fatboy Slim videos and who's iconoclastic vision reminds one favourably of his musical namesake, achieves Kaufman's vision so sublimely you'd think the two men sprung from the same artistically fertile womb.

1216;"reading the above paragraph, it's amazing to think that not two hours ago I would have called anyone who'd written such rubbish a frantic imbecile
1217;Well, on further review, she actually does a fine job in both creating her character and subverting her glamorous Cameron Diaz persona.
1218;She shows longing and frustration, and then ecstasy with ease, and is able to pull off some of the deadpan absurdity that Lotte's dialogue requires.
1219;catherine Keener proves that if you need someone to play a sexy ice queen, then she's your girl.
1220;"Ratcheting up a notch her work as a similar character in ""Your Friends and Neighbors"", Keener is a vital life force, giving energy and vitality to a film peopled with losers and freaks (that's the film's message, not just my opinion)."
1221;But, she's also able to sincerely play the more emotional moments, without believability and vulnerability.
1222;I love watching this classy lady on film.
1223;More Keener please!Malkovich himself pulls off the film's best acting, especially when he has to portray what happens while Craig is inside his skull.
1224;Malk details Cusack's mannerisms with spot.
1225;kilter rules, and then remaining absolutely true to that world.
1226;John Malkovich himself was robbed when he didn't get a Best Actor or Supporting Actor nomination, but considering the sheer glorious weirdness of this movie, I must bow to the Academy for breaking its usual bonds and actually giving this film nominations for Best Director, Screenplay and Supporting Actress.
1227;If you're adventurous at all in your moviegoing tastes, this movie is for you.
1228;For fifteen minutes, he sees, hears, and experiences everything that Malkovich does.

1230;Being John Malkovich is one of the funniest and most original films I have ever seen in my life.
1231;The script is amazing with its combination of puppetry, infidelity, and out of body experiences.
1232;The love triangle between Keener, Diaz, and Cusak is extremely well done, and fun to watch.
1233;It is also extremely funny, because they are only attracted to each other when they are inside Malkovich.
1234;The three really offer top notch performances.
1235;John is extremely funny in the role, and gives an accurate portrayal of what one would go through in his situation.
1236;Watching him as a puppeteer,will have you in tears from laughing so hard.
1237;The camera work on this film is outstanding.
1238;The film is actually shot at times, from the inside of John's head, looking out.
1239;this extremely funny, and bizare film is truly one of the best films that I have seen in the last couple of years.
1240;The plot is extremely interesting and creative, the acting is perfect all the way around, and the camera work is amazing.
1241;Being John Malkovich works on an amazing array of levels.
1242;But on another level it is a story of love and loss, and complex passions.
1243;on the deepest, best level, it is an exploration into the wants and needs of the human mind and soul.
1244;It begs to be examined over and over again in order to fully understand it's complexity and beauty.
1245;Of course, if i have piqued your interest, by all means, get it, and enjoy!
1246;"Being John Malkovich is, indeed, an original film
1247;But Being John Malkovich allows its audience to wallow in its creativity.
1248;Being John Malkovich is the kind of film you watch with a cocked eyebrow the whole time, in which you find yourself enjoying the film but you're not quite sure why.
1249;top wife (Cameron Diaz, unrecognizable and wonderful).
1250;There he finds a portal into the mind of actor, John Malkovich.
1251;although the movie has its flaws (sometimes it's TOO odd for its own good, and it doesn't have nearly enough laughs in it to be labled a comedy) Being John Malkovich is so creative and is full of so many witty ironies, that those flaws don't matter.
1252;You will love Being John Malkovich.
1253;You can tell he enjoyed mocking himself while watching the movie, and while the mocking is cute and clever, the makers of this film do it subtly and don't overplay it, so to make it more than just a shameless plug for John Malkovich.
1254;A fantastic movie all in all.
1255;great idea but how does the film work in terms of pacing, plotline, and coherence?
1256;Amazingly, the narrative is tight and follows easily enough.
1257;The satire is always two steps ahead of us.
1258;outloud surprises in here to mention.
1259;dazzle of celebrity, is overcome by a sense of worthlessness and ennui.
1260;Imagination and creativity were abundant, as well as excellent acting.
1261;the acting was good, but I don't believe Mr. Malkovich had to do very much acting.
1262;I believe the best acting came from Cameron Diaz.
1263;One of the most unusual mainstream films ever made.
1264;A stunningly assured piece of work from video director Spike Jonez who toys with just about every conception of modern cinema there is.
1265;Cameron Diaz shows what a talented comedy actress she is, John Cusack carries off the male lead with distinction, John Malkovich is sporting as himself, but for me the films real star is Catherine Keener who smoulders with provocative sexuality and femme fatale appeal.
1266;Jones has very light touch, and although Being John Malkovich is a highly unorthodox film, you cant help but get [pulled] into the movie, which at times adopts a sort of Dogma.
1267;handicam approach for a documentary.
1268;I was almost crying from laughter in my seat.
1269;art student I have yet to see a finer example of Post .
1270;I want to see more like it!
1271;If you like low angle box style photography you are in for a treat too!
1272;"This film is essentially art within art
1273;Some great puppet work too, from a master of the art.
1274;Being John malkovich is unique!
1275;see it and you know you have seen the best in cinematography and plot EVER.
1276;And it's based on a true story too!
1277;Cameron Diaz is the best followed by John malkovich.
1278;i was hooked from the opening scene.
1279;the acting in this film is superb.
1280;the story is really pretty simple, but the implications are immense.
1281;Not only touching on our own celebrity fascination, but also toying with the strange feeling of What would it be like if.
1282;_Being John Malkovich_ is fun, loony, and even a touch philosophical.
1283;Plus, you'll laugh until you cry.
1284;This is definitely a Love it!
1285;Being John Malkovich is probably the most promising debut of any director that I've ever seen, ranking right alongside last year's Lantana.
1286;Directed by Spike Lee, formally known for making pop videos, this is as surprising as it is astonishing.
1287;Telling the story of Cusack's disillusioned puppeteer who whilst working on the 7th and a half floor of an office building discovers a way into John Malkovich's mind, this is brilliant filmmaking from start to finish.
1288;obsessed wife (Diaz in a completely unforgettable role, not just for her acting ability but for the fact that she manages to look dowdy) becomes obsessed with being John Malkovich and that Keener is in love with her inside of Malkovich.
1289;What makes the movie though, as well as its sheer and consistent originality, is its performances.
1290;Keener as the maneater is also incredibly enjoyable, winning herself a well.
1291;deserved Oscar nomination for her multi.
1292;Perhaps what is most delightful though is John Malkovich himself playing along with it all, poking fun at his public persona where nobody can remember any of his films and he's often overly dramatic.
1293;there are countless aspects of this movie that make it enjoyable, although probably the most refreshing aspect of it all is that it was made in the first place.
1294;The only thing I can think of is that the actors read the magnificent script.
1295;Equal parts nightmare and fantasy, Being John Malkovich is one of the most original Hollywood pictures ever released.
1296;This movie, although not a publicized at it ought to have been, is incredible.
1297;Darkly humorous and an overall fun movie to watch.
1298;"BJM is still a Fantastic movie
1299;The comedic timing is perfection and with some art house style.
1300;I love the concept and the execution.
1301;It's part black comedy, part fantasy, part drama, and part thriller that stars attractive people John Cusack and Cameron Diaz as unattractive people.
1302;He befriends Maxine (Catherine Keener), a sharp tongued office sexpot who turns Craig down at every shot.
1303;It was one of the best movies of the year.
1304;Charile Kaufmanwrote one of the best scripts ever.
1305;The movie is quirky, funny andemotional.
1306;It has the best of everything.
1307;A great director and a great cast.
1308;It was one of the best movies of last year, it got ignored at the Oscar's but then good movies always do.
1309;He finds himself as filing clerk.
1310;Personally I thought the movie was a great success.
1311;This madcap journey through definitions of self celebrates, in the best possible way, everything the postmodernists have been babbling about.
1312;deliciously impossible, complex, and darkly witty a la Gilliam and Lynch, this film is studded with stellar performances by principals Cusack, Diaz, Keener, and Malkovich and is directed by the unexpectedly keen Spike Jonze.
1313;Jonze, to his credit, has engineered a visual world and character moments that underline the story rather than gilding it, as Hollywood generally prefers.
1314;but all the better to contrast the vivid reds and whites that signal power in this film.
1315;center humor and demands viewer attention.
1316;cuisine, this kind of film is an acquired taste, and can be watched again and again for many flavors of imagery, style and idea.
1317;the Post Card., this is definitely a winner.
1318;"Two people who love each other end up together
1319;Have you, as the viewer, been manipulated into thinking this is a good film?
1320;"Without writing too much (most of the fun of this film comes from discovering its originality on your own), it can be said without doubt that ""Being John Malkovich"" is an amazing piece of filmmaking."
1321;It reminds us where film can take us, and is arguably the best example of creative screenwriting in the last decade or so.
1322;the film features some classic scenes, including a climactic chase scene through Malkovich's sub.
1323;An amazing example of original filmmaking, directed by music video director Spike Jonze, making his feature.
1324;I seriously think this is one of the only movies that I enjoyed enough to watch all of the credits.
1325;"Great story, great cast, great soundtrack, great writing
1326;Everything about this movie blew my mind.
1327;He is a puppeteer at heart, but to make ends meet he takes this job, and loves it!
1328;He works as a filing clerk, but two factors heighten the working experience.
1329;He is smitten with his co. worker (Katherine Keener), and he discovers a trap door that leads him into the mind of celebrity John Malkovich (John Malkovich)!
1330;See this movie, it's great.
1331;Rarely will you come across a movie that gives such a concept.
1332;Add this all with quirky characters, the unusual 7 1/2 floor, a puppeteer who displays his art in an untraditional way (in a scene that should go down as one of the classic off.
1333;beat comedy scenes in history!)
1334;And that's before we're introduced to the tunnel/portal that leads you into being inside the actor, John Malkovich.
1335;"Just goes to show the ""fantastic,"" or ""magical realism"" of which this movie manages to sit so nicely in between is not only alive and well but maybe this is the proof that telling original stories through movies is still possible!"
1336;The most memorable sceen is is Malkovich's trip through his own mind.
1337;I was amazed that a director that could put together a piece of artwork crazier than a Picasso paintaing but it all fits together through some sort of weave.
1338;It was refreshing for her to play such a powerful role instead of the dumb blonde she usually portrays.
1339;John Cusak also did excellent as the troubled pupeteer who completely takes over Malcovich's body and mind controlling his life and fulfilling his life on becoming a professional pupeteer with Keener as his new companion.
1340;The movie endlessly goes nowhere but it was delicously entertaining and I strongly recommend it if your sick of the action/blood/guy.
1341;girl themes in most movies today.
1342;This is the most original movie I think I have ever seen.
1343;The style of filmmaking, and the original comedic and twisted story will have you thinking for a very long time.
1344;This movie will appeal to a large audience.
1345;"I certainly prefer the director's latest work ""Adaptation"" to this vehicle."
1346;This boasts of originality through and through.
1347;You can tell that a lot of people in this movie are here to help out a friend.
1348;Some actors take their role a way more seriously than others.
1349;I do not like that sort of thing because it makes me feel uncomfortable to be honest and I found it hard to enjoy anything after that.
1350;This vehicle is worth seeing for his performance alone.
1351;This movie is so original, I can't even begin to explain this movie, other than that it was intelligent, fascinating, and hilarious.
1352;Because of the originality, it is completely unpredictable: you are so completely in the dark trying to guess what is going to happen next, that you end up not even bothering to guess.
1353;which makes a great movie.
1354;Cusack, upon the realization that he might not make it as a puppeteer, decides to get a day job, at a place on the seventh and half floor of a New York skyscraper.
1355;this movie is like a dream.
1356;and not in the sense that it's an incredibly great movie, although it is.
1357;This may well be the one movie that you should see this year.
1358;Strong cast and a very interesting idea.
1359;The movie was engaging and introspective.
1360;What a gem of a movie.
1361;Excellent direction from Spike Jonze.
1362;i don't know what else to add but that this was the weirdest, most enjoyable movie I've seen in years.
1363;All the characters in the film are completely off their rockers.
1364;up of our society's obsession with celebrities is hilarious.
1365;The standard of living in America has declined an amazing amount in the last few decades, yet we still hear lots of rosy figures about economic growth.
1366;So yeah, its an amazing concept, and has some crazy premises and situations, and it is imaginative, but as is typical thoroughout the movie, the explanations of the basic concept of this film by old timers who aid the Cameron Diaz character are contrived and wholly unsatisfying.
1367;politically correct coupling of the Keener and Diaz characters.
1368;for those of you that say the movie satisfies your curiosity as to what it would be like to be someone else, in reality, the Cusack character is actually being himself only within the facade of Malkovitch's body.
1369;"In the late scene in JM's agent's office, where Malkovitch reveals to the agent of his impending ""career change"", JM takes on the persona of Cusack."
1370;This film is inspired, hilarious and unnervingly touching.
1371;The script is absolutely original and the characters' interaction between each other very funny.
1372;The scenes between Keener and Cusack are wonderful.
1373;It was hilarious, but impossible to explain to the clerk.
1374;It truly was better than anything else, and it has advanced film and humor theory forward more than any movie in a long time.
1375;In that respect it has a lot in common with Pulp Fiction.
1376;it also would have been nice to hear the following surreal announcement at the Oscars: And the Oscar goes to.
1377;For me it was niether spellbinding nor thrilling (until the end) but it was probbaly the most original most inventive film of the year.
1378;The fact that a puppeteer found a portal in his work office that leads to John Malkovich's head is just fun.
1379;If you're looking for a film that's just pure entertainment then Being John Malkovich is for you.
1380;The thing about BJM is that for a wierd movie the plot holds together right through to the end.
1381;Sometimes something Avant Garde like this gets so wrapped up in being wierd that when the credits roll you are surprised.
1382;there are some really funny moments in this movie.
1383;There is a spoof on corporate videos that is fabulous, including a non.
1384;There are surealistic moments that have the edge of wierdness made easier to handle by subltle comedy.
1385;John Malkovitch is actually quite good at having a sense of humor.
1386;one of the major themes in the movie is puppeteering.
1387;The puppet work in BJM is fantastic.
1388;I think it is one of the great little surprises of the movie and really enhances the enjoyment.
1389;overall this is a fabulous movie.
1390;on the plus side the film does have many funny and unusual elements.
1391;charlie Sheen plays a wonderfully exaggerated version of himself.
1392;a master puppeteer who tries to present creepily morbid skits as 'kid shows'.
1393;maybe that's its main gift.
1394;The choice of actor fits in with the general motif.
1395;It could have developed into something really illuminating.
1396;(shades of Rosemary's Baby)It's essentially a heartless movie.
1397;if you're really impressed by the fact that this is unconventional, and a lot of reviewers here are.
1398;A funny word for such a loveless story.
1399;the reason I gave it any stars at all was for the originality of the concept, and the excellent cast.
1400;It was great to see Mary Kay Place again (and Orson Bean!!)
1401;Cameron Diaz was very good and Catherine Keener was terrific.
1402;The first time I saw it, my mouth was wide open in shock.
1403;It's so crazy it's wonderful.
1404;trip of a story, it's easy to skip over the wonderful performances by the cast.
1405;Catherine Keener is superb as a power.
1406;And that's part of the charm of this wonderful film.
1407;The line of reality and fiction at times becomes fuzzy.
1408;A characteristic that writer Charlie Kaufman and director Spike Jonze play even more with in their follow.
1409;One of the most unique and memorable films to come out under the Hollywood radar in a long time.
1410;This gets my high recommendation.
1411;Being John Malkovich renewed my faith in the capacity for creative thought still lurking out there.
1412;And John Cusack is at the top of his form as well.
1413;If you're the least bit cerebral, you'll enjoy this film.
1414;This movie is very,very original!
1415;The movie is much more than a clever premise, it is an evaluation of the modern world.
1416;The performances are great, especially that of John Malkovich, who's role required the most bravery.
1417;The best film of the decade, even greater than Pulp Fiction.
1418;Well, it is exactly what it said on the tin, people BE John Malkovich, see what he's seeing feel what's feeling and taste what's he consuming.
1419;and one day Cusack's character finds a porthole to John Malkovich's mind in the 7 floor and that's where to the wacky and wonderful story begins.
1420;fi/ Action adventures/ Romantic comedies/ Drama for a few hours and enjoy one of the rarest and best Hollywood export in years.
1421;Well it certainly was original.
1422;I've never seen any movie even remotely similar to this, so if your in the mood for an extremely surreal movie, this could be good.
1423;The Movie Being John Malkovich was fantastic.
1424;John Malkovich and the cast are so good.
1425;It was really a super film.
1426;let me first say that all of the primary actors performed brilliantly.
1427;Cusack played both the melancholy and crazy sides of Craig the puppeteer quite well, and Diaz really shone as his quirky wife.
1428;The idea is a fascinating one, brilliant even, with so much potential.
1429;as it is, I give Malkovich a star for good acting and another star for a nice idea.
1430;Being John Malkovich is one of the most thematically ambitious films of the 1990's.
1431;revealing and often comical actions of the main characters.
1432;faceted aspects of human beings, and the troubles they face in trying to find themselves.
1433;That is, until he meets the magnetic Maxine, who's confidence and boldness enchants Craig for the entirety of the movie.
1434;"altering experience
1435;Maxine is comfortable in her own skin .
1436;Maxine is very aware of the power of self.
1437;assurance, a power which she uses to influence Craig, his wife Lotte, and Malkovich himself.
1438;Before he discovers Maxine's true intentions, he is blissful and carefree, with a strong acting career and a hot new girlfriend.
1439;Indeed, it is Malkovich's conscience that steals his happiness.
1440;if you've ever wanted to be someone else, or at least wondered what it would be like, then Being John Malkovich is a must see.
1441;"A wry comedy that makes you think
1442;oppressive, insightful, and captivating glance into the deepest of human desires and insecurities.
1443;Cusack looks scruffy and he has a bit of a personality disorder.
1444;She looks so incredibly unglamerous in this movie.
1445;the difference between the two films is that Being John Malkovich takes things just over the line and into the realm of the funny.
1446;There is certainly something to the matter.
1447;fact way that people accept coming onto a floor with 5 foot ceilings in the film.
1448;are grounded in reality just enough for you to be genuinely interested in what happens to the characters throughout the film.
1449;This is a story of flawed but genuine people who have their goals met or frustrated in the context of a completely original premise.
1450;The unbelieveable situations are presented so matter of factly that you accept it and move on.
1451;cusack and Diaz are perfectly cast in this film.
1452;We are used to seeing Cusack in good guy role.
1453;hire as likeable as the guy next door.
1454;john Cusack moments to full comedic effect.
1455;Diaz plays a plain and mousy woman in this film and this works for her, too.
1456;Not to forget Malkovich's performance, in which he plays himself and himself occupied by another person!The result is an excellent film that works on many levels.
1457;The film is funny just taken at face value.
1458;The results when John Malkovich takes a turn being John Malkovich are some of the most hilarious moments I've seen in a long time.
1459;This film is both broadly funny and darkly funny and slyly funny and over.
1460;A completely original premise done in superbly accurate and entertaining manner.
1461;scenes segments sort of reflect the moviemaker's skewed view of the world, but the one segment about an extra whose job it is to drive past the set on the highway is quite funny and very interesting.
1462;"Writer Charlie Kaufman, director Spike Jonze and a superb cast team up to deliver one of the most original, highly imaginative and clever films to come our way in a long time: ""Being John Malkovich,"" starring John Cusack, Cameron Diaz, Catherine Keener and John Malkovich is the story of out."
1463;And when he has to take a temporary job to support his wife, Lotte (Diaz), it's the beginning of a bizarre interlude that will ultimately take him, and a few others as well, into a realm beyond the known.
1464;"Jonze has taken Kaufman's unique screenplay, which is witty, humorous and totally engrossing, and made an ingenious movie
1465;It is distinct and filled with nuance and subtle shades of humor, sometimes dark, sometimes hilarious, but riveting throughout.
1466;And the performances are absolutely first rate all around.
1467;Keener deservedly got the Oscar nod for Best Supporting Actress, but Cusack, Diaz and Malkovich are also exemplary here.
1468;"Cusack comes through with one of the best characters he's ever done
1469;It's a great character part, and Diaz plays it for all it's worth, connecting with the audience while ably conveying Lotte's sense of confusion and repressed yearnings.
1470;"Malkovich (as himself) is the icing on the cake
1471;"The ""Malkovich, Malkovich,"" sequence, and his rendition of the ""puppet's dance"" are unforgettable scenes."
1472;"But character actor Orson Bean (with his creation of the wry Dr. Lester), nearly steals the show with a truly memorable performance
1473;Being John Malkovich is a movie that is an experience in itself, and Jonze and his entire cast should be given a standing ovation for bringing this one to life, for making it breathe.
1474;Being John Malkovich explores true human despair.
1475;Human nature is to look toward the future to something grander than we can really achieve.
1476;being John Malcovich explores this dilemma with hilarity, grace, and intelligence.
1477;But the cost is great.
1478;this combination of the practical and the metaphysical sets Malkovich apart from other Theater of the Absurd works, placing it among the greatest films of all time.
1479;It's a true masterpiece of not only the human condition, but of human behavior.
1480;Maxine is the perfect seductress to bring out this situation not because she has the erotic charm of the femme fatale, but because she's attractive and enjoys it.
1481;john Malkovich gives the greatest performance of his carreer as a man fighting for his very soul.
1482;great performances, an utterly original storyline, weird, infectious humour and a unique atmosphere .
1483;john Cusack is magnificent as the troubled puppeteer and Cameron Diaz also shines in an unusual non.
1484;Malkovich is also wonderful as the gloriously OTT thespian.
1485;hyped summer blockbusters starring box.
1486;office bankers such as Will Smith, this films stands out as a masterpiece.
1487;While too many movies suffer the fate of creative bankruptcy, Being John Malkovich is a refreshing study in contrast, so bracing original that you'll want to send director Spike Jonze and screenwriter Charlie Kaufman a thank.you note for restoring your faith in the enchantment of film.
1488;Add a devious coworker (Catherine Keener), Cusack's dowdy wife (a barely recognizable Cameron Diaz), and a business scheme to capitalize on the thrill of being John Malkovich, and you've got a movie that just gets crazier as it plays by its own outrageous rules.
1489;But for 112 liberating minutes, Being John Malkovich is a wild place to visit.
1490;All this and at the same time Being John Malkovitch ranks with the best of the screwball comedies.
1491;the strange world of the seven and a half (suggesting Fellini's 8 )floor immediately sets the viewers body on edge.
1492;The effect is visceral and sets up the desire to get out of the cramped space and therefore out of the body.
1493;one of the great jokes of the movie is the casting of Orson Bean as the 105.
1494;I last recall Bean some years ago had a keen interest in the theories of Wilhelm Reich, which involved some notion life extension and enhanced sexual potency through collecting orgone energy.
1495;This was an interesting concept, but I found it too complicated to follow.
1496;It's probably a very good movie if you like complicated plots.
1497;The premise is very intriguing.
1498;the 3 stars I gave this movie are all for originality and the potential to inspire some really great movies.
1499;I really like the premise and a couple of the scenes are hilarious.
1500;Funny, Inventive, and asks the cosmic question of what if we could be somebody else.
1501;I saw this film many years ago and was happy to now find it on disc.
1502;It's certainly worth a see.
1503;this was director Spike Jonze's directorial,feature film,debut.
1504;jonze has done for film,thematically at least,what Spike Jones did for music.
1505;she will repeat the process and come to think she should really be a woman.
1506;craig has newly discovered that he can now control the amount of time he spends in J. m.'s body,and Maxine and he become an item.
1507;craig/Malkovich and Maxine eventually marry and have a child.
1508;it is a bluff,but in the end it works.
1509;lester and his friends enter J. m's mind on schedule.
1510;the film ends as we see the couple Maxine and Lotte on a beach with Maxine's daughter.
1511;there are so many neat touches such as Malkovich's close friend Charlie Sheen,popping in and out of the film from time to time.
1512;director Jonze does a nice job of layering the film.
1513;he slowly introduces us to his main characters and their quirks,allowing time for us to believe what we see,then builds upon the foundation,ending at the most quirkiest and dizziest heights I have ever seen.
1514;also there is a point in the film where Malkovich actually enters his own mind,and what a hoot that turns out to be.
1515;technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is quite clear.
1516;That's what filmmaking at its best is all about.
1517;And the best part, the true knock on Hollywood?
1518;figure blockbusters and it's still been one of the nation's top ten films every week since the listening public discovered it.
1519;Everyone knows, of course, that Malkovich plays himself (and hams it up tremedously), and most people are aware that the male lead is John Cusack.
1520;The rest of the film's cast is a mystery, I think.
1521;the puppeteering in this movie is tremendous.
1522;garde productions and all that sort of stuff, the incredible complexity of the marionette shows at various times during this film will astound you.
1523;a beautiful metaphor if I've ever seen one.
1524;the film was produced by R. E. M. vocalist Michael Stipe and is the full.
1525;length directorial debut of music video guru Spike Jonze, perhaps best known for his longtime association with the Beastie Boys.
1526;Whatever you may think of their music, you have to admit, their videos are always something new and unexpected.
1527;but you walk out feeling guilty for having enjoyed it as much as you did.
1528;I admired it more than I liked it for it's skillfull blend of dark humor, originality and sweetness.
1529;It's daredevil fun, but it has the potential for more.
1530;Though I enjoyed and do recommend it, I sort of expected more from a movie about going into someone else's head.
1531;A tour of Malkovich's mind would have been more entertaining than just looking out through his eyes sockets.
1532;Still, it's a fun movie and sometimes thrilling in it's own special way.
1533;Being John Malkovich is in a sense, some sort of achievement.
1534;All the actors are great.
1535;John Malkovich is why I liked it.
1536;I laughed when he was singing, dressed as a female laying across the piano.
1537;Spike Jonze has crafted an unforgettable fever.
1538;He cast John Cusack as the lead.
1539;Not since Terry Gilliam's 'Brazil' have I seen such a fresh film.
1540;hero of this modern surreal drama.
1541;in the end I guess I liked it, but I wouldn't take kids to see it.
1542;`Being John Malkovich' certainly ranks among the most brilliantly conceived and executed films of the past several years.
1543;Overflowing with imagination and creativity, it manages to breathe new life into that trickiest of cinematic genres .
1544;Like all films that dare to take risks, `Being John Malkovich' sometimes stumbles in the paths it chooses to take, but at least its course is always an innovative and fascinating one.
1545;One of the triumphs of the film is that it portrays the surreal in such an understated and quiet way.
1546;This floor has ceilings so low that the people who work on it must continually crouch as they move about their business, yet they all accept that fact with an uncomplaining and unquestioning good humor.
1547;Craig's wife, in addition, runs a pet shop and therefore fills their house with a menagerie of exotic animals .
1548;the film makes it possible for us to go along with the characters' otherwise inexplicably blas reactions.
1549;writer Charlie Kaufman and director Spike Jonze hit upon a number of fascinating themes in the course of their bizarre musings.
1550;Craig, for instance, learns that there exists a certain safety in the tediousness of everyday life, for the moment he allows the extraordinary to enter his ordered world he unleashes passions .
1551;mannered artist there lurks the soul of a repressed despot, as he comes more and more to relish the ability to move into Malkovich's mind and control his thoughts and actions .
1552;much as with his beloved puppets, but now on a much more grand, much more malevolent scale.
1553;The film generates much of its comic tension through the complex sexual interplay that develops among Craig, his wife, Lotte, and his alluring but enigmatic co. worker, Maxine, in whom both husband and wife develop a more than passing sexual interest.
1554;the film demonstrates a real stroke of genius in its casting.
1555;John Cusack, with his look of understated bewilderment, perfectly conveys the soul of a man too long accustomed to expecting little in the way of surprise out of life.
1556;Catherine Keener brilliantly captures the detached cynicism and taunting coolness that makes her such an enthralling sexual temptation to both Craig and Lotte.
1557;At moments in which the iconoclasm seems to become an end in itself, one may be tempted to see the film in emperor's.
1558;clothes terms, wondering if what one is seeing is really as brilliant as it appears or just an intellectual scam being played on a self.
1559;For the most part, however, `Being John Malkovich' is fertile enough in its invention and varied enough in its imaginativeness to rate as a film well worth seeing and cherishing.
1560;"For sheer originality, it's hard to beat ""Being John Malkovich"" as the most outrageously entertaining comedy of 1999."
1561;It may sound unworkable on paper, but the approach to the storytelling is unique and offbeat enough to overcome the most obvious hurdles.
1562;director Spike Jonze proves himself a true cinematic visionary.
1563;face comedy, and Jonze's wise choice of murky, underlit camera angles make it clear that all attention belongs on the actors, and on Kaufmann's script.
1564;jonze is just as adept at getting great performances out of his cast.
1565;Catherine Keener deservedly won an Oscar nomination for her bitchy Maxine, but Cameron Diaz matches her, moment for moment, in a much less showy and obvious role.
1566;perfect as the squinting puppeteer, and Malkovich, proving himself the best sport in Hollywood by starring in a film that so unabashedly makes fun of his image, gives a brilliant, perfectly timed comic performance.
1567;from its odd premise the story builds and builds, tossing in one oddball twist afteranother with admirable energy.
1568;"wall plot for maximum comic effect
1569;"Even more surprising is the way ""Being John Malkovich"" examines each of its characters with considerable compassion, when it would be so easy to treat them with contempt."
1570;"roger Ebert named ""Being John Malkovich"" the best film of 1999."
1571;the film damn well deserved a Best Picture nomination.
1572;"Ebert called the movie ""endlessly inventive,"" and that's as much a handicap as it is a compliment."
1573;Almost the best film of 1999.
1574;Great story captured well on film.
1575;Acting is good, dialogue crisp and often funny.
1576;Highly recommend for any adult viewer.
1577;Easily the best picture of 99' and one of the best of all times Being John Malkovich is one of those fantastic journeys that is just so original that when you are finished you are left in awe.
1578;Go in with an open mind and prepare to leave with a blown mind.
1579;I have seen it 5 times and it gets better every time I see it.
1580;Spike Jonze is a truly talented director (Can you believe that this was his first film?
1581;The screenplay by Charlie Kaufman is brilliant and very original.
1582;John Cusack, Cameron Diaz, Catherine Keener, and John Malkovich all give great performances (Why weren't Diaz and Malkovich nominated for Oscars???)
1583;as for the humour, it is as funny and more intelligent than anything released in years.
1584;Not really that funny or entertaining.
1585;The film creates a world with its own logic, to which it stays true enough.
1586;What stands out in the film is the masterly, fresh comedy, from hilarious quirks to perfect deadpan send.
1587;The emotional balance of the film is unsettled.
1588;Just don't get too attached to the characters or anything else that seems genuine at first if you want to enjoy it as comedy.
1589;Imagine a film that could take you on a journey into the most unexpected places in both reality and fantasy.
1590;This is the feeling one gets watching Being John Malkovich , one of the most startling original films to come out in a long, long time.
1591;It's creativity is boundless, it's humour is bracing, and it's depth is sobering.
1592;It's hard to think of a film that combines so many diverse elements and still work perfectly, but this one does.
1593;Being John Malkovich raises some fascinating issues about the illusion of celebrity, the quest for identity, and the way lust and greed can twist people's live around.
1594;You can't help but wonder how some of it's ideas got conceived in the first place, and why they work so well on screen.
1595;It is safe to say that director Spike Jonze will be along side Paul Thomas Anderson and David Fincher as the best new film.
1596;The entire story has a creative adolescent spirit.
1597;A man (John Cusak) finds a door on the 7 1/2 floor of a building and it takes you inside of John Malcovich for about 15 minutes, then you're dropped onto the side of the New Jersey turnpike.
1598;This simple elegance is what makes this film so enticing.
1599;This movie brings reality to an idea most of us dismissed at the age of 12.
1600;Suddenly we're in a surreal place where an office can exist on the 7 1/2 floor and you can actually be another person.
1601;The movie takes your intellect on a thrill ride.
1602;It is unlike anything you have ever seen.
1603;this movie is for people who liked to be challenged and entertained by new ideas.
1604;the puppetry scenes were captivating.
1605;i give this movie full points for creativity and novelty.
1606;Frankly, I find it a wonder I watched it all the way through.
1607;This cast performs flawlessly especially Malkovich, and the direction adds to the mood and strangeness that this film depicts.
1608;This question is handled both on literal levels and figurative levels, which results in the comedy of the film.
1609;All of the characters are extraordinarily self centered, and ultimately that is what makes the story thought provoking.
1610;Not a single person questions Craig Schwartz (Cusack) after he first enters the mind of John Malkovich and goes telling everyone about it, the people he confides in simply take it at face value.
1611;But this film ultimately succeeds because it is a human story, a story that focuses on our greedy motivations.
1612;This is my third favorite film behind American Beauty and Magnolia.
1613;John Cusack's character is the greatest sad character I've ever scene.
1614;Charlie Kaufman has a great up and coming career in Hollywood and I'm interested in whether he'll eventually begin to direct his own work.
1615;Let me just say that the best part about being John Malkovich is John Malkovich.
1616;He really makes u believe that he is having the weirdest experience of his Life .
1617;I did not care for the whole lesbian plot and sometimes the entire thing went overboard but i did enjoy the movie overall.
1618;1999 was a great year for movies in Australia, with Go, Run Lola Run,Election, Cube and this film, Being John Malkovich.
1619;the cast is brilliant, Cameron Diaz isalmost unrecognisable from how we usually see her and outstanding.
1620;Particularly entertaining is the fight everyone hasover possession of John Malkovich's body while overlooking the facthe's the only one entitled to it.
1621;Spike Jonze and everyone elseinvolved has made a very good film.
1622;this unconventional movie starts with a very intriguing notion, brilliantly surreal and off.
1623;It rakes up some thoughtful issues .
1624;ends, the ultimate notion of freedom and love of self, etc etc. all that is well and dandy, and this is easily one of the most creative movies out of Hollywood in recent times.
1625;it's a very cold movie really, nothing wrong with that, but it's hardly one that will merit lasting affection.
1626;Innovative and original genre in its own right.
1627;wind and make sure that you did hear/see what you thought you just did hear/see.
1628;It is quite a hoot.
1629;Yes the beginning was really fine, especially the office scenes on the 7 and a half floor, with the receptionist, the dark haired girl (Keener character), and all the jibes that our hero (Cuzak, not Malkovich, at least not yet) gets from everyone.
1630;"The ""history of the building"" film was cute."
1631;The marionette scenes are nice too, and I even felt some sympathy for this frustrated puppeteer.
1632;It was amusing seeing the world thru John's eyes for a while too.
1633;This is one of the coolest films I've ever seen.
1634;but when such a project is in the good hands of Spike Jonze and Charlie' s, the results are bizarrely entertaining and somehow thought.
1635;There, he finds himself have a huge crush on a well.
1636;dressed, shrewd and cunning colleague Maxine who often treats him like a loser, and, above all, also finds himself, by accident, a gateway to get into one of the 20th.
1637;century finest actors John Malkovich's inside for a big while.
1638;one of 1999' s glorious achievements in terms of creativity, direction, screenplay, cast performances and scores, Being John Malkovich provokes a string of philosophical and metaphysical ideas of existence and immortality in such a bizarrely interesting way, and in a way, is one of the most creative stories of 1999.
1639;Highly recommended for any broad.
1640;It also had to do with what it means to be a celebrity and about their real `identity'.
1641;What a great movie this is, and a more insane story you could not ask for.
1642;malkovich is amazing and some of the sequences with him are trippy and surreal but deeply funny.
1643;the cameos are exccelent, and Charlie Sheen is hilarious in his tongue in cheek portrail of himself.
1644;The whole sideways look at fame and celebrity is excellent.
1645;This is an fantastic film with a genuine theme .
1646;The theme is that it matters not at all who we really are and what our talents are where impressing others is concerned.
1647;What matters is the basic, outward perception others have of us (ie our physical appearance).
1648;The plot delivers this message well but it, in itself, is ingenious.
1649;It was great to see both Mary Kay Place and Orson Bean in such rare form again and John Cusack and the beautiful Cameron Diaz insured that this film will become a cult classic.
1650;If I had it to do all over again I'd have saved the four bucks and bought it right away.
1651;The most unique movie I've ever seen in my whole entire life.
1652;But I'll tell you about it and maybe you can get something out of it.
1653;a puppeteer named Craig Schwartz (John Cusack, who's great as always)gets a job in a business building on the 7 1/2 floor.
1654;Craig's frizzy haired animal loving wife (played by Cameron Diaz, you can barely notice her in this great role) wants to go back in Malkovich more than once and likes the idea of being a man, and decides she wants a sex change and falls for Maxine, who Craig fancies.
1655;this movie is the most original film of the year.
1656;I think the message in this film, at least for me was that we should be happy with are and not hold other people above us and just be happy with what we have and who we are.
1657;All in all it's a great film with some good points, some funny scenes and NEVER a loss of energy.
1658;It just keeps going and by the end you want more, which I think is a good element in film.
1659;Leave the audience wanting more.
1660;One of the very few movies I have ever not been able to finish watching.
1661;This is a very good movie, but not for the faint of heart.
1662;She kept talking and complaining.
1663;If you want to see a quirky movie that is entertaining, this is your movie.
1664;I love a good movie, and this one was great.
1665;It keeps me from fully enjoying the movie.
1666;"I enjoy ""deep"" movies, but sometimes ""deep"" movies appear deep without truly being deep."
1667;This is one of those movies.
1668;reference (see Douglas Hofstadter's works for more info), I belly.
1669;laughed at the concept of Malkovich entering his own portal.
1670;must be a world record.
1671;Probably one of the neatest stories i've seen.
1672;do yourself a favor and watch this.
1673;The cameo by Charlie Sheen is the funniest part of the film.
1674;I think Catherine Keener gives an amazing performance as a self.
1675;She makes the character strangely attractive even I wanted her.
1676;A documentary on puppeteering is included which is sort of interesting.
1677;minute interview with the director as he's driving is funny.
1678;Finally the best part is a 6.
1679;That has to be the funniest thing.
1680;down, have a beer and let this person entertain you for hours.
1681;viewed rack for the scenes I liked and the extras.
1682;So even though I'm still not sure of the point of the movie I find it very entertaining in a strange way because it just cracks me up and in today's times I need and appreciate a good laugh!!!
1683;A good film for thinkers.
1684;Great PQ and good AQ for the type of movie (mostly dialog).
1685;all, and of course a great story.
1686;This is the kind of film that can restore your faith in American cinema.
1687;That it was even produced is a miracle, let alone received Oscar nominations.
1688;up all the loose ends and deliver an ending which is as heartbreaking as it is hilarious.
1689;He also gives us some of the funniest lines ever spoken on screen, to wit: 'Behind the stubble, the too prominent brow, and male pattern baldness, I sensed you feminine longing.'
1690;perfect performances from his high.
1691;calibre cast, with Cameron Diaz and Catherine Keener cleverly playing against type, and John Cusack showing his incredible versatility.
1692;Three cheers for originality and having the courage to follow it through.
1693;Being John Malkovich is four and a half stars.
1694;This film had a perfect casting who was John cusack, Cameron Diaz, John Malkovich.
1695;Beautiful directed and acted also funny.
1696;a man takes a new job on the 7th half floor of some building.
1697;When Craig is sucked into the door, he can be John Malkovich, an actor on Broadway, and boring Craig lives John's exciting life, meeting famous people and pretty girls every day.
1698;this film gave me fresh ideas.
1699;I thought this film, made of questions, absolutely this film fixed my idea when I watched John Malkovich's movies.
1700;the director, his name Jonze did a really amazing job.
1701;That helped me to make a think by myself.
1702;Have you been enjoy yourself in life?
1703;Are you enjoying now?I loved this movie.
1704;Soon he and his atractiv secretary Maxine doo a great business with that door!
1705;200$ for one trip into Malkovich's body!
1706;She sleeps with her while she is Malkovich!
1707;story with great actors and a strange Soundtrack!
1708;A must See,2 Thumbs up!
1709;This is one of the most original, quirky and hilarious movies I have ever seen.
1710;In fact, it is the most original, quirky and hilarious movie I have ever seen.
1711;charlie Kaufman and Spike Jonze ever came up with this is beyond me.
1712;I highly recommend this movie, but with the caveat that it may not be funny the movie for everyone.
1713;kilter a little bit to really enjoy this movie.
1714;It is a marvel to behold, a comedy with an outrageous premise, but told with great poignancy and emotion.
1715;All the actors do an amazing job, but its not really the acting that stands out here, it's the inginous story.
1716;The story starts, and you're happy that its so weird and offbeat.
1717;This trend continues throughout the film, the story constantly putting twists upon twists until the end.
1718;And when the end is approaching, you're thinking, This movie is so great, it can't possibly end right, but it does.
1719;All I know is that this was one of the most original, artistic and maybe even one of the most beautiful films that I have ever seen.
1720;This is when surreal makes way for the outright bizarre and the movie begins to reveal its real charm.
1721;A series of events (the finding of a door which leads in to John Malkovich's mind is just one of many) follow which all culminate to make wonderful entertainment which is way superior in intelligence to the normal churn of Hollwood movies.
1722;It is non conformist, I can't decide what genre this is, but maybe that is why it is so appealing.
1723;I will say though that the cast are brilliant.
1724;John Cusack is outstanding in his role as Shwartz, and Cameron Diaz is hilarious as his wife, believe me you have never seen Diaz like this before.
1725;Catherine Keener plays Maxine, and is brilliant in the role of a vixen seductress.
1726;But the real hero here is Spike Jonze the director, he keeps the film flowing and gives it continuity which must have been a very complex task.
1727;And, oh yes I also said that the film was beautiful, this has largely to do with the use of some wonderful puppetry.
1728;But for now we simply have to make do with one of the most intriguing and involving films of our time.
1729;this film is truly original.
1730;Being John Malkovich is a masterpiece.
1731;Spike Jonze was already my favorite music video director, and now he is my favorite director, period.
1732;He is inventive, strange, scary, and he makes you think.
1733;He looks in the newspaper and finds a filing job on the 7 1/2th floor of a skyscraper downtown.
1734;There he meets his beautiful office.
1735;Spike Jonze is a genius.
1736;This is actually a very interesting movie that came out in the very interesting year of 1999.
1737;It stars John Malkovich, John Cusack (one of the greatest hopeless romantics of all time, this guy never wins), Cameron Diaz, and Cathrine Keener all in arguably career defining roles.
1738;This film is a tour de force in strange and abstract film making.
1739;It is experimental cinema at its finest.
1740;It is a success because it ultimately comes down to what is going on inside your head while you are watching this strange and bizarre gem.
1741;It is a shockingly original, amazing film.
1742;It was truly robbed of an Oscar for best original screenplay: while American Beauty was good, it wasn't as good as Malkovich and not nearly as original.
1743;There aren't a lot of bright colors or beautiful shots, but the movie really draws you in with it's dark, strange atmosphere.
1744;As I said before, the screenplay is utterly brilliant.
1745;The movie kind of reminds me of Terry Gilliam's Brazil .
1746;the performances are quite good, but really do serve the story.
1747;being John Malkovich is a very rare kind of movie indeed: one that is stunningly original and incredibly well.
1748;Dopey characters that were more like cartoons than real flesh and blood people.
1749;Plus, a script that thought it was far more clever than it actually was.
1750;Shows you what she knows.
1751;There is so much to say about and the words you might read, can't do this movie right, because it's originality and class can't be described.
1752;There does the puppeteer, Craig, discovers a tiny door which leads right into the head of actor John Malkovich.2) the actors : John Cusack, Cahterine Keener, Cameron Diaz, John Malkovich,.
1753;ALL do a really great job to make their characters come alive.3)the approach of the movie itself : this isn't just an one.
1754;dimensional comedy like American Pie or such, this is a satire, goofy comedy and dramatic love story in one.
1755;With , sometimes rich, imagination, developed characterization, atmospheric music and a firm director, there is just to much to mention about this movie.
1756;Well, dear people, I can say you this : this is the most entertaining, moving, original movie of the last 5 years.
1757;I guarantee a unforgettable, undescribably great experience!!
1758;This is one of the very rare films that keeps alive my hope that there is some originality left in film.
1759;At a time when it appears that every second movie coming out is eiter a remake of some sort or features an unimaginative deadbeat plot, Spike Jonze's film comes as a fresh breeze of original thinking.
1760;The plot is outlandish to the extreme, yet the superb acting of John Cusack, Cameron Diaz and John Malkovich carries this tale along so effortlessly that even the most bizarre of circumstances seem to fall into place quite naturally.
1761;A clever premise does not a good movie make.
1762;dimensional characters, dramatic structure, or any emotion whatsoever, reflects that.
1763;This was a true masterpiece to see its way through most of the unmemorable fare of last year.
1764;A true classic in its own right.
1765;The film shows what a true director, screenplay and most importantly a real plot can do when they all join forces for the power of good.
1766;The actors have all done better work.
1767;It was mildly amusing in spots but never laugh out loud funny.
1768;While too many movies suffer the fate of creative bankruptcy, Being John Malkovich is a refreshing study in contrast, so bracingly original that you'll want to send director Spike Jonze and screenwriter Charlie Kaufman a thank.you note for restoring your faith in the enchantment of film.
1769;This has got to be one of the strangest movies I have ever seen, and also one of the best.
1770;The only word that will fully describe what this movie is, Beautiful.
1771;The unique storyline, the hidden meanings and metaphoric elements, the puppetry.
1772;right up there with American Beauty and Fight Club as best movies of that year.
1773;This is one of the classics.
1774;It is worth your time.
1775;But, as you also know, he happens to be right, and the end of the movie is anything but funny, not even in the gallows humor sort of sense.
1776;It is, perhaps, better to be much delighted and a bit heavy.
1777;Its hard to imagine a movie that is this off the wall, utterly hilarious, and strangely philisophical was ever written, much less actually made.
1778;Charlie Kaufman's script is so amazingly creative, blending screwball humor and existential philosophy so well that you either laughed or pondered you existance throughout the entire movie.
1779;The acting was equally impressive.
1780;John Cusack has long been one of my favorite actors, and this may be his best, most developed performance yet.
1781;Catherine Keener certainly deserved her Oscar nomination, and John Malkovich himself was hilarious as the man trying to figure his way through this metaphysical can of worms .
1782;I'm so glad that Spike Jonze directed this move, having been a fan of his since the days of the Girl/Chocolate skateboard videos.
1783;Jonze really came through with the perfect mix of subdued cinematography and wacky visuals.
1784;1999 was a really good year for movies, Bringing Out the Dead, Magnolia, Three Kings, The Insider, and The Limey will all be remembered for years to come, but Being John Malkovich was the best and most memorable, without a doubt.
1785;This identity crisis is identified (pun intended) immediately within the beautiful establishing shot(s) of director Spike Jonze's fantastic .
1786;In the aforementioned shot(s) we see a puppet show taking place .
1787;for all the characters in the movie (including Schwartz), each seeking a new and improved existence .
1788;specifically via a magical portal that allows them to enter the mind of acclaimed American actor John Malkovich.
1789;But once the transition is made, and each character has a chance to be somebody else.
1790;for improved emerald splendor of another's grass .
1791;For me, this ingenious film worked on many levels.
1792;An example of this can be found in the choices of lighting for the scenes involving Schwartz.
1793;This clever handling of the lighting shows the audience .
1794;on the emotional and psychological levels, I found Being John Malkovich to be extremely satisfying.
1795;, but the underlying questions being asked, as well, made this a pleasurable viewing experience.
1796;Spike Jonze meets Soren Keirkegaard: I like it!
1797;This movie can make you go into a deep thought process.
1798;Many surprise twists and turns makes this an interesting movie.
1799;By means of a magic tunnel, allthree main characters enjoy life in another body,until, after numerous kinky adventures (which arenot so much tongue.
1800;I am glad I went to see Being John Malkovich because it was a very fun movie with an original idea and a smart screenplay.
1801;I guarantee you enjoy it.
1802;i totally recommend Being John Malkovich to viewers everywhere, if you haven't seen it, see it!
1803;John Cusack and Camron Diaz were great, in roles that I didn't recognize them in at first.
1804;Though the story had a sort of dark humor to it, I found it very entertaining and thought.
1805;I have to be honest.
1806;Take perfectly good actors like John Cuasack, Cameron Diaz and John Malkovich, and put them in this publicity stunt of a movie.
1807;its cool to see filmmakers still taking a chance on celluloid.
1808;but this movie is very special.
1809;amazing performances from the cast (i didnt know the wife was cameron diaz until about an hour and a half into the movie), which take you into a world of fun and excitment.
1810;other stars/directors/studios/writers should be so bold and daring as this movie.
1811;The acting was great, and the premise was incredibly creative.
1812;The ending was a classic anti.
1813;it all makes perfect sense.
1814;this one will flip your wig kids, if you are into movies that make you trip without using drugs.
1815;Stylistically, the tone is a retro homage to the New York of the late 1940s when bohemianism had an intellectual edge.
1816;Although it's something we'd like to see more of, coming from a guy who'd spent most of his career in the music business.
1817;She's an upbeat, postive animal.
1818;"But Craig's big break comes when he comes upon a job looking for 'fast fingers'
1819;What's funny, is it happens to be on the 7 1/2 floor of a local office building.
1820;So being a professional puppeteer, he nails the interview and gets the job.
1821;And while making his way down a tunnel of dirt, he soon finds himself inside the head of a human.
1822;The human is, naturally, John Malkovich (who plays himself).
1823;"i gave this movie only 3 stars because it lacks a strong start
1824;But, nevertheless, the movie is definetly worth seeing.
1825;And if you see this movie, you'll certainly be moved whether it be in a good or bad way.
1826;It has a great cast and features some funny cameo appearances, along with Charlie Sheen (who also plays himself).
1827;All in all it's a respectable piece of work, and I'm looking forward to seeing Jonze's next film, Adaptation .
1828;As other reviewers have said, the idea/plot for this movie was totally unique interesting, but that is all the movie had to offer!
1829;This movie has had its mixed reviews, those that enjoyed it pointing it to its quirkiness and to standout performances like Cusack's, those that hated it pointing to its pacing and what they call its pointlessness, but I think even if you look past all of those major ideas, you can find something valuable here.
1830;Without speaking to some interesting concepts throughout the film or to specific techniques employed by Jonze/Kaufman, I find it easy to recommend this movie.
1831;If you want to see a movie that's suspenseful, highly entertaining, hilarious, and sexually bizarre, then you'll want to see Being John Malkovich.
1832;I highly recommend this movie!
1833;One of the best movies of 1999.
1834;This film is in my all time top 5 for the WORST movies that I've ever seen.
1835;Avoid it at all costs.
1836;Now, to me, 1999 was one of those great years in cinema.
1837;What, basically, you have here is fine performances by Cusack, Diaz and Malkovich.
1838;We're introduced to the minds of Jonze and Kaufman (2 minds I for one want to see more of).
1839;if you're reading this you probably know the plot already,so I'll just say that despite the plot,it's actually very entertaining.
1840;he has the most affecting raised eye.
1841;inspiring beauty doesn't distract from her great performance.
1842;her character Maxine could send the most confident,shallow,thick.
1843;Though I have not watched this gem in some years, still I remember the magitude of the storyline, and now just how appropriate this movie is.
1844;Because in this economy, to be an artist, to have any dreams come true at all is truly a miracle.
1845;I love the nuances of all the characters, the subtle nonacting, that make each scene a realistic interpretation.
1846;As a fan of mind.
1847;"bending films like ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" and ""Memento"", I was recommended this one on Netflix and decided to give it a try."
1848;"put simple, this is an artsy, ""concept"" film if ever one was created."
1849;Many themes in the film are interesting and have potential to really intrigue, but all are eschewed in favor of oblique artistic expression.
1850;The visuals are nice and the content seems thought.
1851;This is an unusual way to present two films which share many of the same actors.
1852;My preference is to begin with Adaptation, which easily merges with Being John Malkovich.
1853;Meryl Streep is a good example.
1854;More of you have seen that film and remember it.
1855;It's hillarious, unpredictable, with a flwless script, brilliant acting, and fantastic direction.
1856;But if you look again you will see that these and many many other things are symbolic and many have reference to other parts of the film and to deeper meanings.
1857;And the best part is that it manages to be funny at the same time.
1858;In my opinion this is easily one of the most ingenious movies ever made.
