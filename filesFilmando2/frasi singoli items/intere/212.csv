1;Amazing story of Queen Elizabeth's rise to power in spite of all the obstacles she faced in securing her throne and the stability of her realm.
2;This is one of my favoite films.
3;From the amazing music, acting, story line, and art direction, it all culminates into a full experience where your suspention of disbelief brings you into Elizabeth's world.
4;It is an OK movie .
5;This is one of the best period films I have ever seen!
6;Great character development, wonderful scene location, and some of the most amazing costume design.
7;Haunting story line that will stay with you forever.
8;If you like history and you like good acting, this is a good choice.
9;she's tough and sympathetic in her role and the photography is wonderful.
10;This is a spectacular film in so many ways.
11;If you enjoy history, Cate, Feinnes, gorgeous costumes, great acting, and panoramic character development, get this film.
12;the product was delivered on time, very good condition.
13;Elizabeth is a superb film filled with wonderful acting, cinematography and directing.
14;Cate Blanchett easily deserved the Oscar way over Gwyneth Paltrow's head.
15;She is Protestant even though England was Catholic at the time.
16;The cinematography is gorgeous and the directing by Shekar Kappur is superb.
17;Running alongside big blockbusters is hard but Elizabeth survived wonderfully and proved that it was the better one.
18;This is a great movie.
19;Cate Blanchett made a remarkable Elizabeth.
20;, and as another reviewer has pointed out, there's certainly more drama and intrigue in his REAL story than the movie allows .
21;It's still an entertaining movie, as I mentioned before, and Cate Blanchett really does deliver an exceptional performance.
22;i agree with the fact others have said.
23;I give them full marks for accuracy on the costuming and set design.
24;I guess that tells how much I liked the movie.
25;"I'd have to say that ""Elizabeth"" does a fair job, but the movie definitely has its faults."
26;blanchett performs wonderfully as Elizabeth and seems made for the role.
27;the scenes where Elizabeth comes into her own with gentle barbs and quiet cajoling of her parliament are beautifully handled and are wonderful to behold.
28;Blanchett manages to convey just the right amount of humility and control, humor and iron will to make the scene convincing.
29;And the scenes where Elizabeth struggles with the realities of power, with the necessities of ruthlessness and aloofness, are perfectly conveyed.
30;overall, this is a decent movie, entertaining enough and with enough kind.
31;historical merit to be pleasant to Tudor lovers.
32;I throughly enjoyed the story of Elizabeth's early years on the throne.
33;Cate Blanchet's performance is one of her best.
34;The top positive and negative reviews say it all.
35;Elizabeth and Elizabeth the Golden Age are 2 excellent movies.
36;"Cate Blanchett does an excellent job of being the ""red haired"" queen."
37;The story line is excellent.
38;As a history buff, I thought the movie very entertaining and the portrayal of Elizabeth quite fresh.
39;The acting was terrific, the suspense wonderful.
40;The costuming and scenery and music were also worthy of mention.
41;Cate Blanchett is wonderful and very believable in the title role.
42;A wonderful choice to play Elizabeth.
43;Very worthy of watching again and again.
44;Interestingly many actors appeared in both productions.
45;All the actors here give stellar performances enhanced by the film's stunning cinematography.
46;The directors commentary is so worthwhile, humorous, informative self.
47;The story of Queen Elizabeth is a remarkable one.
48;much of the film's beginning is dark and filled with quiet whispering.
49;right from the start the movie is intense and filled with action.
50;in trying to capture a very intense love story from English history, this movie is extremely well done.
51;Cate Blanchett is by far a superior actor and a personal favorite.
52;"She ""is"" Elizabeth and her formidable portrayal shows us a passionate, intelligent, calculating and all."
53;Ms. Blanchett's performance deserved the Academy Award for Best Actress, but I am certain that this talented actress will continue to amaze us with her extraordinary talent.
54;There is an excellent review by a reviewer Robert Jefferson, on the next page, I cannot add much to the points he made.
55;This movie has plenty of the later.
56;But as a classic or as history.
57;This movie is fine if all you want is a costumed drama, but since I've very familiar with the actual history, I found the liberties taken with historical fact absolutely unconscionable.
58;Go back to Glenda Jackson for real historical drama.
59;It is the greatest film I ever saw in my life.
60;The acting, the costumes, the locations, the drama and (very important) the music.
61;It shows that it is more important where a movie comes from then what it looks like.
62;This film is an example for historical films made in the future.
63;This movie is a masterpiece of historical FICTION.
64;It is a fabulous illustration of the power, majesty, wit and political abilities of Britain's most powerful and famous Queen.
65;Elizabeth combines sex, violence, betrayal and intrigue, while presenting it in a deep and meaningful way.
66;cate Blanchett delivers a spectacular performance as Elizabeth, portraying her caring sensitivity at the same time as her cold and ironic wit.
67;Her evolution throughout the movie is spectacular, and this performance far outshone Gwenyth Paltrow's in the clich movie that beat this one out for the presigious oscars.
68;Joseph Fiennes plays Robert Dudley, the Queen's love interest, and plays the part well, but comes off as a somewhat two.
69;historical discrepancies aside, this movie is an amazing and powerful portrayal of the raw majesty that was Queen Elizabeth.
70;That aside it is still a remarkable film.
71;The visuals are absolutely stunning .
72;Kapur, brings to life historical personages and gives them real human personalities and not text.
73;This aspect is very well illustrated by Cate Blanchette in the scene where Elizabeth addresses parliament and the religious leaders.
74;Visual splendour, excellent acting, and a plot that intrigues.
75;Cate Blanchette is a fine actress and does a wonderful turn as she evolves from shy, timid Princess Elizabeth to strong.
76;Beautifully filmed with an even lovelier production design.
77;I loved this movie as much as the first time I'd seen so beautifully done, on VHS.
78;Cate Blanchett was born to play this role, young Elizabeth.
79;The story was so well written, not a lot of movies do that to people, transport one back though this one did.
80;I have watched it many times and I must tell you, all the actors were on target.
81;It has been well known about the film Elizabeth is not historically accurated , actually I don't care!
82;cate Blanchett's performance however, was impeccable.
83;Her power and vulnerability were well illustrated.
84;You could see her confidence grow with every step and you could see her dilemmas.
85;this movie had so much good acting, but I felt it was not pieced together well.
86;catholicism is the last acceptable prejudice, especially in Hollywood, and it will continue to be as long as the Catholic Church remains an influential force in the world.
87;Elizabeth carried her father's torch, and continued his bloody work, to an even greater degree.
88;Like a good mystery there were subtle nuances.
89;there are many things that make Elizabeth a great film.
90;For example, not only is it amazingly realistic, but it also portrays a very accurate depiction of the Queen.
91;The difficult early part of her reign is not as well known as the stunning success that she later achieved as a leader, and her potent and strong.
92;willed personality is captured very well in this film.
93;She suffers through countless hardships during this part of her life, and the circumstances leading to her crowning of herself as The Virgin Queen are what make up the story of this excellent film.
94;The visuals, particularly the breathtaking interiors of the tremendous castles in which much of the film takes place, are some of the most amazing things about this movie.
95;This is an epic drama crafted with amazing skill, excellent performances, and stunning photography.
96;"I love this movie which deals with true life history
97;My mom is strong too.
98;The Oscar is very depreciated and overvalued award.
99;they should have gave it to him in The Insider, now there is an astounding performance.
100;Kapur's brilliant direction gives the film a vertiginous rhythm, while Remi Adefarasin's ominous cinematography adds a menacing and sinister atmosphere that sometimes gives Elizabeth the feel of a horror movie.
101;Also worthy of praise are the magnificent production design, the gorgeous costumes and a surprisingly eclectic soundtrack that includes Byrd, Mozart, Holst and Elgar as well as some great original music.
102;the acting is also excellent.
103;She gives a complex, mesmerising and moving performance as she makes the transition from scared and vulnerable young woman to quasi.
104;if you are interested in the true historical facts of Elizabeth's reign you should choose a documentary of one of the many great books that have been written about her (my favourite is Alison Weir's biography), but if you are looking for a great cinematic experience that explores the young queen's personality and motivations in remarkable depth this is definitely the one to choose.
105;In my opinion Shekar Kapur's masterpiece is the best film of its kind.
106;The movie was well done the actors and scene, lighting and the storyline.
107;Cate Blanchett was brilliant as Elizabeth
108;I suppose that's the nature of royal courts, at least back when they held real power.
109;elizabeth held real power, and therefore was threatened on all sides.
110;She was clearly in love with Lord Robert Dudley (Joseph Fiennes), at least until she was told he was already married.
111;that's the rough outline of the story, but the story is in the details, some gruesome, some passionate, and all filled with spectacular costumes and sets.
112;It's a lavish production about royalty, and you won't miss the fact that it's long ago when things were rather more brutal than they are today.
113;cate Blanchett will make you believe in Elizabeth as a force for civilization.
114;Very few historical movies are historically accurate.
115;The primary purpose of movies is to entertain.
116;She is, indeed, just a shell, and Cate Blanchett brings the Queen to life"
117;There is outstanding support from Rush, Attenborough, Eccleston, and Fiennes.
118;Filled with lavish costumes, an exhilarating soundtrack and exceptional cinematography (near the beginning, the camera revolves around Elizabeth intimidatingly as she is questioned, as if we are also in the conspiracy to get rid of her), Elizabeth is a sensational, epic masterpiece.
119;It was very well thought out and was possibly incorrect historically for entertainment purposes.
120;I think that was very clever too, which made it more exciting to watch.
121;Thanks to Kapur and Cate Blanchett (whom I've loved ever since I saw a schmaltzy drama called Paradise Road), Elizabeth is brought to life with grace and vigour.
122;Some might say Kapur's direction is too fancy (William Goldman complained he'd never seen so many actors wasted by showing only the tops of their heads) but I think it's creative and breathes new life into period filmmaking.
123;Probably not the right order, but we did thoroughly enjoy both of these movies.
124;Excellent cinematography, acting, costumes, etc.
125;Highly recommended if you appreciate British history.
126;History is more a matter of Art than Science: history is largely a matter of interpretations after all!
127;almost in full, before she made a decision of the most personal nature, that of choosing her own husband.
128;all these matters are spun together to make a very good drama.
129;This is a most entertaining as well as instructive movie, making history so sensible to most of the viewers who are fortunately not unnecesarily too pedantic: things like the loosening of the Pope's grip on England, the equilibrium between the Europeans powers or even the struggle between Scotland (and France) and England.
130;Production and acting are good, one won't get bored by watchinging it a second time.
131;this film is a real 5 star masterpiece.
132;This is a historical film that does take some artistic liberties.
133;But despite that, he was actually a really great king.
134;Elizabeth seems to be a sympathetic character throughout most of this film.
135;She has enemies both foreign and domestic.
136;Cate Blanchett really embodies the daughter of King Henry VIII.
137;Sometimes she shows an untapped power.
138;Yet she can also be sympathetic and vulnerable.
139;He is very loyal and very good at his job.
140;But in my opinion, Walsingham is really his best performance.
141;Geoffrey Rush comes through and flips the tables.
142;(Violence is disturbing even if the good side is winning.)
143;He knows who did it, and even has fun by greeting the man behind the failed attempt in a friendly civil manner.
144;And in the end, he has the pleasure of arresting him for plotting against Elizabeth.
145;this movie was a phenomenal masterpiece.
146;I was happy to give this as a gift to someone on the happiest day of my life.
147;Okay Kate Blanchett is a wonderful Actress.
148;Very Clever of my Russian relatives Stalin was Maos Dad, to use an existing and proven aircraft carrier design, good aircraft carriers come in threes.
149;Elizabeth is a wonderful movie and Churchill is the alluded to Major Metcalfe Walsingham to mi5.
150;QE2 is enigmatic, tough young Eagle with 120 plus years of cleverness to look forward to.
151;The acting is awesome and the cinematography is beautiful.
152;This film is one of the best movies ever made.
153;From start to finish it will completly hold your attention.
154;Cate Blanchett as Elizabeth the first gave the best female performance of the 1990's and one of the best of all time.
155;Every scene with her is worth mentioning.
156;She gives an amazingly nuanced and remarkable performance that can not be over.
157;The fact that she lost best Actress is one of the biggest robberies in Oscar history.
158;Fanny Ardant gives an amazingly real performance as Mary Of Guise.
159;An astonishing example of a small role that is made big by a remarkable performance.
160;Kathy Burke is great as Mary I ( Bloody Mary. )
161;Also worth mentioning are Richard Attenborough and Christpher Eccleston.
162;The direction job by Shekhar Kapur is one of the best of the 1990's and ever.
163;The editing by Jill Bilcock is remarkably done and adds tremendously to the story.
164;The script by Michael Hirst has some of the best lines ever written.
165;The costumes, cinematography, score and sets are by far some of the best of the 1990's and of all time.
166;Overall Elizabeth is the definition of a masterpeice, one of the best movies ever made.
167;Script, performance, technically its all there.
168;i found the most fascinating element of the film the relationship between Elizabeth and her guardian/mentor, Sir Francis Walsingham.
169;His gentle demeanor as her advisor disguises an almost maniacal willingness to do whatever it takes to protect her interests.
170;Elizabeth's childlike demeanor is a wonderful foil to his worldly.
171;This is a superbly made movie and the acting is simply first rate.
172;I would most highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes history and period movies.
173;I realize that this movie is historical fiction.
174;less as the story may be, it is an amazing story still.
175;Cate is glorious as Elizabeth, and this movie has made her one of my all time favorites as an actress.
176;I was almost as much enamored by the stunning visual feel, cinematography and lighting.
177;effects of this film, as the performance by Miss Blanchette.
178;This film ranges in tone: from silly to grave timbres, certainly covering the catharsis of emotion, as well as creating believable characters (with a glaring exception or two: you be the judge) .
179;Cate Blanchett's performance is as stunning as the historical trashing of the much beloved Virgin Queen Elizabeth.
180;Undeniably, it is another defilement of a great historical leader that rallied her forces to keep England a sovereign nation and the richest nation on earth at the time.
181;Elizabeth was a bold, visionistic, and cunning woman married to her people and a staunch defender of the realm.
182;I am incredibly surprised to see Sir Richard Attenborough take part in making this debauchery of film.
183;The film was incredibly well.
184;Watch Elizabeth R for some real truth and a piece of history.
185;I first saw this movie in June 2003, and I was shocked in how well this movie is directed and played.
186;Although Gwenth Platrows performance was always good in Shakespeare in love, I just feel that she won because of politics.
187;This movie is for anyone who likes a great movie.
188;I think this should have won for art design, picture, director, and Best ACTRISS.
189;Cate Blanchett does a wonderful job of portraying an alternative view of a young Elizabeth Boleyn.
190;Instead of the strong powerful woman we've come to expect, director Shekahar Kapur and writer Michael Hirst, decided to show a younger, unproven Queen of England.
191;It was most successful in spotlighting the dynamic relationship between Elizabeth and the men in her life.
192;An excellent score and breath taking cinematography along with award winning costume designs rounds out this entertaining film.
193;Cate Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush were perfect casting for the historical personages they portrayed.
194;I'll be brief, this movie is fantastic!!
195;I've become a huge fan of the Showtime show *The Tudors* and it has made me return to my love of history in that I've sought out gaps in my knowledge in media form.
196;I never saw this movie when it first came out and now I can truly appreciate it because of The Tudors show on Showtime.
197;She had her arrested and locked up in the Tower of London.
198;"Anyway, her reign was considered ""The Golden Era"" and she was one of the most beloved Queens in the history of the monarchy."
199;cate Blanchette does an astounding job in this movie.
200;Elizabeth is first portrayed as a somewhat immature inexperienced queen who is in love with the passionate, yet married, Robert Dudley, but as the film continues, you see her develop into a witty, animated, and appealing queen.
201;be assasins, and gets to them first.
202;This movie is full of schemes, character development, and suspense.
203;An excellent and accurate portrayal of 16th century England, in the age that was named after England's beloved queen.
204;Cate Blanchett was excellent in this movie.
205;I highly recommend it if you are a period movie buff, like I am.
206;"In that time, I learned that so much of what we take as Gospel from Doctors and Pharmaceutical Companies
207;The immune system, along with reasonable nutritional changes, identify the culprits hidden in processed foods.
208;Juicing, raw food delicacies that delight the palate, enabled me and others featured in testimonials who recovered from Stage 4 cancers and are still livings over a decade later.
209;cate blanchett gave the perfect portrayal of a young woman who suddenly finds herself to be the most powerful woman in the world.
210;geoffrey rush is a brilliant walsingham, the master of her spy network.
211;all this intrigue and romance is set amongst the most lavish scenery and costumes.
212;This film takes extraordinary license with the facts of History and twists them to create a biased farce.
213;as the title of this review suggests, I was pleasantly surprised.
214;The movie moves quickly and does a good job of clearly laying out the challenges facing the new Queen.
215;The acting, wardrobe and set designs are all first class.
216;bottom line: a good movie, with good picture and sound.
217;Will be amusing to see what they come up with for the next movie.
218;Great movie about the beginning of Elizabeth the first's golden age Cate Blanchett gives an amazing performance supported by many other great actors.
219;I enjoyed this movie very much!
220;The acting was wonderful, in my opinion.
221;I saw this movie right after Shakespear in Love and after watching both I couldn't believe Shakespear in Love won an Oscar.
222;Elizabeth was a far superior movie.
223;The characters portrayed are true to form, I've done some research, and this movie is really a true.
224;fictionalized account of the reign of Elizabeth 1, and the story itself is interesting, but Cate Blancett absolutely steals the show!
225;Her performance alone ranks as one of the best you will ever see.
226;while the story plays fast and loose with some historical bits, it's still an interesting look into the 'rebirth' of England and the influence of the Catholic church on it's rulers.
227;geoffery Rush is also excellent as her faithful advisor and 'bodyguard.'
228;great movie, well worth the price!
229;Elizabeth is just so wonderful!
230;I recommend it to anyone.
231;This movie featured my man Joseph Fiennes, and a truly brilliant actress, Cate Blanchett.
232;She portrays Queen Elizabeth 1 with excellence and accuracy.
233;See this video, I hope that Cate wins Best Actress!!
234;She has always been one of my favorite Queens of England.
235;but than only God knows the true heart of his children.
236;What a pity, since the Tudor dynasty is strong enough to stand on the actual facts to spin an enthralling tale dramatically without all the phony embellishments.
237;front and center in this heady swirl of pageantry, sex, intrigue and melodrama is the star making performance of Cate Blanchett as the young Elizabeth.
238;Elizabeth Tudor was one of the most complex, brilliant women in history, a true Renaissance """"Prince"""" in the Machiavellian sense."""
239;She was capricious, a mass of contradictions, formidably intelligent yet neurotic, cool headed but possessed of a fiery temper, charismatic yet kept most people at arms length.
240;Her compelling, muti faceted portrayal heralded the arrival of an exciting, young actress brimming over with talent.
241;Deservedly her achievement was rewarded with a Best Actress Oscar nomination and wins for both the Golden Globe and the British Film Academy Awards for Best Actress.
242;just as a fine diamond will sparkle more dazzlingly in the proper setting, an impressive supporting cast adds to the luster of Ms. Blanchett's portrait.
243;As the foppish, giddy Duke of Anjou, a would be suitor of Elizabeth, Vincent Cassel brings some moments of comic relief to the heavy drama.
244;There is also a glimpse of the future James Bond, as Daniel Craig plays a small but key role as the Jesuit priest Father John Ballard.
245;the settings and costumes are opulent and magnificent, all the splendors of Elizabeth's court, a Renaissance tapestry brought to life, the musical score is effectively used to underscore the events unfolding on the screen.
246;All were rewarded with Oscar nomiinations, a total of seven in all including Best Picture.
247;"regarding the extras, director Shekhar Kupur does a commentary, an insightful glimpse into the vision of the film, and there are two good featurettes, the better of the two is ""The Making of Elizabeth"", which is more developed, but the second one ""Elizabeth"" is also worth a look."
248;Lush, well produced, beautfully filmed, visually appealing, well.
249;I am very surprised at the number of people here who claim to be lovers of British history who praised the film for its accurate depiction of events.
250;This is somewhat surprising given the rich and accurate store of knowledge regarding the couterie of the period.
251;there are numerous other points to make, but simply know this:This is a work of fiction, based on certain historical figures and a few historical events.
252;Watch the film and appreciate the fine acting, the beautiful settings and costumes, and the intensity and passion of the characters (who really were that proud, that devoted, and that ready to die for their various causes), but do not learn history from it.
253;Hopefully you'll be intrigued enough to find a few good books to read and learn of it yourself.
254;you may be surprised that the real stories are even more arresting.
255;Rather, learn about the human condition from fiction, which is the greatest purpose it serves.
256;time best actress in the role of the young Queen Elizabeth .
257;outstanding performance, and she looks the part.
258;as director, Shekar Kapur gives us a very interesting interpretation of the young queen's surviving a staggering maze of hazards, attaining and holding the throne, and establishing herself as a real queen, wielding actual power on her own, not as some man's property.
259;If I were judging this film solely on the merits of its fidelity to history, it would fail by a wide margin: it condenses many decades worth of events into a few brief years, plays fast and loose with several real characters fates, and occasionally creates an outright fabrication.
260;Judged as pure drama, however, this flick is a resounding success.
261;The set design and cinematography are very good, and ably convey the sense that the atmospheres of both England and the Tudor court at this time were dangerous.
262;The supporting cast is reliably good (even Joseph Fiennes, whom I've always regarded as a bit of a weak link in any production he appears in, is watchable).
263;Shes extraordinarily good here, convincingly essaying Elizabeth's evolution from a nave and inexperienced ruler into a ruthless pragmatist.
264;This is a lovely movie, Cate Blanchet's performance as the title character is excellent, as is the rest of the cast.
265;as others have noted, this film is entertainment, not history.
266;the movie is worth watching.
267;And, if seeing it whets your curiosity, read any of the several popular level biographies ofElizabeth I. Alison Weir's _The Life of Elizabeth I_ is very well written.
268;I loved this movie so much!
269;What an amazing portrayal of an amazing true story!
270;I suggest this movie to anyone looking for a historical film with depth that captures you and leaves you wanting me!
271;i love this version of the movie.
272;would make a great gift.
273;I love the part where Anne says boldly before she is beheaded.
274;This one grabs you from the opening moments.
275;I also found myself really caring about Elizabeth and her safety.
276;This one is really a thriller.
277;cate Blanchett should have won the Oscar for her portrayal of Queen Bess.
278;I can see that most everyone here agrees.
279;She took my breath away.
280;As Elizabeth I, Cate Blanchett is, of course, extraordinary.
281;As a visual extravaganza, the film is lush and dramatic.
282;The director uses a pretty heavy hand, especially when it comes to the score.
283;This was a wonderful movie about the trials and tribulations of a monarchy during the middle ages.
284;for those who are not as concerned about attention to historical detail, this movie is a must.
285;see because of Cate Blanchett's riveting performance . . . count me among the reviewers who think she was robbed of the Academy award.
286;In addition, the cinematography and art direction are splendid.
287;All in all, a movie worth adding to your collection.
288;She's a girl with a broken heart, a survival, a murceful queen, honest and devoted to England!
289;I was quiet amazed by Cate Blanchett's performance.
290;The story of Elizabeth's life and her battle against evil within her country as well as from out of borders of England lays out so beautifully by Cate's performance as well as the writers and directors that it was hard to take eyes off of the screen.
291;A history, a legend, and a mystery of the queen Elezabeth won over my heart as I watched the movie.
292;I wish I could write more, but it's hard to put in words something that comes in your life unexpactedly and amazes you with its richness of wonder and fantastic beauty!
293;I recommand this movie for any lover of powerful movies that have mystery, love, darkness, beauty and magic of destiny mixed all together!
294;One of the best films of the year.
295;I truly believe that the Oscar should have been won by Cate Blanchett due to her miraculous performance of Elizabeth , at least she did win a Golden Globe award for best actress in a drama.
296;After watching her portrayal of Elizabeth , I could see why the Elizabethan era was considered one of the best period of England's history, England had a very strong leader.
297;Bravo to Blanchett for doing such a remarkable performance.
298;And the best Shakespeare history plays were always about his present.
299;Sometimes the film feels a little too CGI in its effects, but its mordant, violent and systematic cynicism makes it refreshing in a decade of limp costume dramas, and Geoffrey Rush once again proves why he is a titan among modern actors.
300;First time I saw this movie, great performances, directing and costuming.
301;Great drama from beginning to end!
302;This film about Queen Elizabeth I's (Cate Blanchett) rise to power takes liberties with history but presents a compelling tale of treachery, conspiracy, and ruthlessness.
303;I have become a virgin, she declares at the end.
304;She enters court caked in white makeup that makes her appear inhuman and untouchable, and everyone in attendence is awed by the transformation.
305;Contrasted with the playful young woman in the early part of the film, she presents a moving example of how lonely it can be at the top.
306;Indian director Shakur Kapur acquits himself well and cast members William Attenborough and Geoffery Rush deliver great performances.
307;My biggest impression out of this movie was a sincere feeling of gratitude that I was born in the United States.
308;I loved it the first time I saw it and had to own it.
309;Cate Blanchett did a wonderful rendition.
310;I have viewed this film three times since I first saw it during its debut at the theaters.
311;Cate's interpetation of Elizabeth is not as good as Glenda Jackson's performance in the PBS production of Elizabeth R, but it is refreshing and interesting.
312;The supporting cast is excellent too.
313;this film is worth watching even with its historical inaccuracies.
314;I think that this is the best film about Good Queen Bess since Elizabeth R.
315;The writing and acting was 1st rate and some one paid attention to historical fact to boot.
316;If you love romance, drama, and great acting, watch the movie.
317;I really enjoyed the movie when I first saw it and knew nothing of Elizabeth or Tudor history.
318;Now that I'm a Tudor history student I'm very disappointed in the film and am only really able to enjoy it because I previously loved it.
319;He can do Elizabeth way more honor than this movie and the The Golden Age.
320;overall, good movie if you don't know the history.
321;veiled homage to the superior Amadeus, this movie speaks of the modern plight of women everywhere who must subvert their femininity to the point of hiding their true natures behind a clown's makeup.
322;The stunning ending is presented with the music of Mozart's Requium, but could easily be replaced by Smoky Robinson's Tears of a Clown.
323;This is one of my favorite movies.
324;acting is terrific, story well told, very dynamic without being melodramatic.
325;You see the growth in character of one of history's greatest rules.
326;my daughter order this book because she loves history and this is one of he all time movies she loves to watch
327;What makes Elizabeth such a wonderful movie is the uncompromising portrait it presents of a woman in a life or death struggle while in a position of enormous power.
328;next question: Is this good to know?A great work of art should be content to ask the great questions, not presume to answer them (but see below).
329;cate Blanchett is superb in the title role and wonderfully supported by Geoffrey Rush and Joseph Fiennes.
330;Shekhar Kapur's direction is without a hint of cant or even the slightest pandering to a mass audience, and is psychologically true and without any presumption to moral or spiritual wisdom.
331;The script is a work of scholarship fused with the most compelling dramatic development, climax and resolution.
332;"The editing is almost invisible yet we can see that exactly enough was cut away while the essence was preserved
333;Geoffrey Rush's restraint and control in a part that could have easily been overplayed was highly admirable and contributed strongly to the success of the film.
334;Well, something's lost and something's gained in growing up"
335;In addition he means to show us that Elizabeth was a human being thrust into power, and all that power demands.
336;An innocent among the wolves.
337;On those points he got it right ALTHOUGH people were not quite as clean and good looking then.
338;An historically accurate film would span very very many hours or even more.
339;His performance alone makes this worth viewing.
340;She is a history buff and she just adored the movie.
341;This is a great film, and has about as much connection to reality as Shakespeare in Love also starring Joseph Fiennes.
342;However embellished, the story line is compelling, the action thrilling, and the scenery .
343;He was her most loyal subject.
344;The truth is more compelling than the fiction in his case.
345;She made him 'Master of the Horse' and he was her closest confidente.
346;cate Blanchett deserved every accolade she received for her portrayal of the young Elizabeth.
347;As nearly as I can tell from the historical material I have read, Elizabeth was a great deal like Blanchett's screen portrayal.
348;The most visually stunning scenes in the film take place near the end when Elizabeth dons the white face paint and jewels seen in the Armada portrait.
349;It is clear this queen has become a Goddess.
350;Script, customs and choreographies are fantastic.
351;A world full of color and detail.
352;Cate Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush are just some of the best actors of the modern times!
353;Excellent service, the product was in excellent shape and it came to my home in a very short time.
354;Her portrayal of the Queen was excellent.
355;Geoffrey Rush was great in his role as Elizabeths advisor.
356;A real good movie and I would recomend it to all who like history and action, drama.
357;Elizabeth is a gripping drama that gives to its audience not only the life story of the first queen of England, Elizabeth, but also the traumatic decisions and choices that she made in order to keep her country together.
358;full of haunting melodies by a great composer, filled with themes of love, hate, and treason, this one will definitely please anyone who has a passion for historical dramas.
359;Cate Blanchett delivers a powerful performance, as does Joseph Fiennes and, as always, Geoffrey Rush.
360;Elizabeth the First is one of my favorite historical figures.
361;This flim is by far one the best I've seen.
362;ELIZABETH is and was my introduction to director Shekhar Kapur.
363;Film is a medium that works via visuals, and Kapur delivers sensational vistas, landscapes, settings, and angles.
364;"Her ascension certainly came at a most turbulent time
365;other surprises in this film include a stunning Fanny Ardant, who plays Elizabeth's rival, Mary of Guise"
366;ELIZABETH is a gripping, compelling, artistic period piece.
367;a cinematic feast as rich as it is engrossing.
368;Sign me up as a Shekhar Kapur fan.
369;elizabeth is such a piece.
370;Blanchett's charm and elegance were a joy to behold, and Geoffrey Rush brilliantly injects a tinge of villainy in his ally role, creating a most interesting supporting character.
371;I'm all for visual art and experimental filmmaking, but to completely forsake performance?
372;video techniques) which all historical dramas need, especially one on an epic scale such as this?
373;For a successful negotiation of nouvelle vague style and drama, go for Godard's Breathless.
374;Cate Blanchette gives one of her finest performances.
375;This is a must see.
376;What a remarkable masterpiece this is.
377;Cate Blanchett deserves all respect and honor for her heartwrenching portrayal of Elizabeth, as she struggles to take control of her life and of her country.
378;This is truly a fantastic movie, as is The Golden Age.
379;Cate Blanchett inhabits the character of Elizabeth very convincingly, and it's simply a beautiful film.
380;By the way Mr. Rush was superb as Walsingham.
381;If you get this video and love the performance by Cate Blanchett, or the clothes, or the beauty of the cinematography you're on the right track.
382;Because, let's face it, this story is wildly inaccurate.
383;It's clear the director wanted to have a beautiful, young leading lady but liked the skulduggery of Queen Elizabeth's middle age.
384;The two movies stand alone actually and we enjoyed them, even out of order.
385;There is a lot of history here, most of it hinted at or just touched on.
386;the director also discusses the film's central emphasis on the development of Elizabeth from a young woman into a position of political power.
387;"He states, ""To be a great leader, you have to be totally detached,"" and his film and his commentary amply display Elizabeth's progression from emotional youth to powerful monarch, with all of the benefits and costs to her and those who love her."
388;It enhanced my appreciation for the film in particular, and for film.
389;making and storytelling in general.
390;But as a lesson in how to create an icon, this film is amazing.
391;beautifully shot and acted, this film is worth seeing.
392;cate Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush are superb, Joseph Fiennes is adequate (though his performance was too similar to his William Shakespeare for my taste).
393;I was captivated from the beginning.
394;The way that the director created such a gloomy setting during the scenes that involved Queen Mary and then brighten the screen with Elizabeth was ingenious.
395;The Artistic Creator should be applauded as well.
396;Extemeley accurate to the time period.
397;"1998's ""Elizabeth"" is an excellent dramatization of the early years of Queen Elizabeth I of England."
398;Aided by the sound advice of her advisors and guided by her own intelligence and instincts, she survives a series of threats to her throne and to England to become the legendary Virgin Queen.
399;sister, Elizabeth, who is taken in hand by her courtiers, most notably the experienced Sir William Cecil (played with an attractive mixture of patience and urgency by Richard Attenborough).
400;perfect sinster aspect by Geoffrey Rush).
401;The supreme challenge to her throne comes from the ambitious and powerful Duke of Norfolk (Christopher Eccleston), who makes alliances with both friend and enemy in a plot to overturn Elizabeth.
402;casted, superbly staged, reasonably faithful to the historical record, and features Cate Blanchett in her first real starring role.
403;It is highly recommended to fans of historical dramas and to fans of the Elizabeathan era.
404;This was an excellently done movie, well worth owning, but it did have some serious problems with the story.
405;Several of the major plot elements in the movie are complete piece of fiction.
406;But, these issues in mind, the movie is a sumptuous production, superbly acted and filmed.
407;The costumes are absolutely mouth watering, as any renaissance re.
408;See the movie, then go and get one of the many books available on the Elizabethan age, and find out what really happend then.
409;The enormous support for this film in the press, Academy and other Awards is a further indication of how starved contemporary movie going audiences are.
410;I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and quite frankly am at a loss when I read the negative reviews of folks upset by the historical inaccuracies.
411;the point for me is, was the film an engaging and entertaining costume drama?
412;Once you start playing this video, you will be captured by the sheer charm of Cate.
413;I enjoyed this movie for many reasons.
414;I loved the story and plot.
415;Cate Blanchett is breathtaking before and after she becomes Queen.
416;This is one of my favorite movies.
417;"It is amazing to watch the character visibly grow up from a young frightened girl to the powerful queen whose riegn is called the ""Golden Age""."
418;The music and costumes are both amazing, the dialogue is witty and the use of historical quotes brings a sense of authenticity to the film.
419;If women such as Elizabeth I, Catherine the Great, or Cleopatra interest you this film will definately be for you.
420;There must be better movies about Elizabeth I.
421;it was a pleasure just to view the colors and get a better appreciation of the costumes and set design.
422;The lake scene with the masks is simply superb.
423;This movie provides a glimpse into England's ruling class during the beginning of the reign of Elizabeth I. Well done entertainment.
424;She had been popular for being King Henry's daughter and for what she had to go through in her father's reign.
425;enemy, Catholic King Philipp of Spain (Her mother's great.
426;"I'll refute the ""examples"" one by one."
427;She, being a magnificent liar, sweet.
428;He obeyed his Queen's REAL wishes.
429;I'm sure Elizabeth had a good laugh at the Spaniards' folly.
430;She won the support of the Netherlands, Scotland, the Hugenotts etc. by this brilliant act of diplomacy.
431;Another brilliant way of diplomacy that he misunderstood.
432;She knighted Drake for all he did.
433;Again, no one paid attention to England great, powerful, wise Queen Elizabeth, so legendary for her strength of will and character.
434;She went to see her troops in person and spoke to them passionately to overthrow the enemy!
435;And BOY, they won magnificently!
436;For a real portrait of England's greatest monarch ever watch Elizabeth R. with Glenda Jackson.
437;"It clearly falls within the genre of costume drama, but manages to portray the intrigues of the period in sufficiently byzantine fashion as to keep the viewer riveted and in suspense DESPITE the fact that all of us know Elizabeth ""wins"" in the end."
438;cate Blanchett is truly one amazing actress, and demonstrates an incredible range of emotion in what must have been a very difficult part to play.
439;She cleverly reflects Elizabeth, threatened by her fanatical and mad sister, Bloody Mary.
440;This must be the finest performance of Rush's career to date, and there is some contest as to whether he, or Blanchett, truly dominates this film.
441;Fanny Ardant, playing Mary of Guise with vile yet sweet seductiveness as only she can, is another powerful performance, despite her limited time on the screen in the film.
442;Joseph Fiennes, one of the most overrated of actors, again shows his ability to portray emotion limited exclusively to eyebrows and facial expressions.
443;"Im not sure whether the role was written with ""cute, cocky toy."
444;"boy"" in mind, but as this is all that J. Fiennes seems capable of, its what you see."
445;"what is truly amazing about this film is the fact that, despite an almost total lack of ""action"" until the last few minutes, and the fact that it focuses on plots, counter."
446;intrigues, it still more than manages to keep the viewer engrossed and rivetted.
447;These performances manage to keep you mentally engaged throughout.
448;bearing in mind that Elizabeth has been synonamous with Glenda Jackson in most minds, it is great to finally have a performance by yet another brilliant actress which not only compares favorably, but perhaps supercedes that of Dame Jackson in the role.
449;A beautiful, well crafted cinematic work.
450;At its heart, of course, is the talented array of actors who portray the most important roles.
451;Of course, Cate Blanchett is startling and forceful in her portrayal as Elizabeth.
452;First of all, Joseph Fiennes character, Sir Robert, appears to be Elizabeth's one and only love, and when she feels that love is betrayed, she takes it to heart and declares that England will be her only husband.
453;Elizabeth is a beautifully made film which will illustrate a turning point in English history.
454;Cate Blanchett illuminates the way.
455;Elizabeth is a magnificent work of art.
456;The casting is perfect and the cinematography is amazing.
457;But regardless, I give the movie 5 stars because it is so well done and very captivating.
458;A compelling story of fact and fiction but nicely done.
459;But the costumes, the English culture, the revelation of the power of the Catholic church.
460;whether true to not, is fascinating and worth watching.
461;Cate Blanchett is an excellent actor and fairs well among a very fine cast, under a very gifted director, Shekhar Kapur.
462;When it comes to acting, one must admit that the Brits are exceptional.
463;Historians will criticize the film for the fiction, which will be enjoyed by the movie enthusiast that wants to watch a movie filled with drama and intrigue.
464;Our fascination with British history continues as we watched Elizabeth and the gorgeous sequel, Elizabeth the Golden Years.
465;the movie demonstrates how Elizabeth, masterfully played by Cate Blanchett, surrounds herself with great counsel and trusted advisers, among them William Cecil, the Baron of Burghley.
466;Thanks to the superbly loyal aide Walsingham, played in grand style by Geoffrey Rush, Elizabeth is able to uncover every plot to destroy her reign and she is able to check mate all attempts against her.
467;the extra features provide interviews with the producer and we learn that Shekhar Kapur has followed every detail to provide authenticity as to the architecture and decorations of the time.
468;The movie is superb, the filming exquisite, and we see locations that are simply.
469;making, while still being a fabulous character and period study.
470;She brought England to greatness.
471;If you are not a history buff, this movie may be entertaining.
472;But I highly recommend Elizabeth R for supremely intelligent dialogue, better acting, truer history.
473;it will help if you read the book first
474;It is a fine movie, and if you enjoy movies set in the past, then this movie is for you.
475;This is one great movie.
476;Although it may not be historically correct (follows history exactly), it's retelling of history is engaging and captivating.
477;Elizabeth is a remarkable historic database!
478;"The highlight of this motion picture is, undoubtly, Cate Blanchett's performance as the virgin queen, which is not an easy role to perform
479;I'm glad someone knows enough about English History to recognize the pure fiction of this film.
480;zealous and fanatic (as was a common religious stance in those times .
481;And throughout the film, there was this emphasis on milking the passions for all they are worth .
482;Those two more theatrical representations fulfill the desire for the more dramatic while still coming closer to the history of the times.
483;Great acting , great directing , over all a great movie.
484;I recommend everone who loves history to watch otr own this.
485;This movie had many of the ingredients to make it truly great, including a phenomenal cast, lead by Cate Blanchett, and great scenery and cinematography.
486;The director and the author of the script greatly misunderstood the characters and the material.
487;Not mentioning the awesome movie Elizabeth, the service provided by Amazon is great.
488;And that's the problem: a lavish movie can't survive aa director who chooses to be incompetent.
489;Cate Blanchett's performance was stellar.
490;The God view of the overhead camera was brilliant.
491;I love the movie 'Elizabeth'.
492;It is quite interesting .
493;scripted, and just the right amount of intrigue and suspense for my taste.
494;Of course, she had her own movie (also one of great liberty from the actual historical events).
495;The love affair with Lord Robert Dudley is most likely true in fact, if not in the form presented here.
496;Sussex, the Lord Chamberlain as the plotter for the throne is an interesting detail .
497;perhaps the best facets of this film are in the mood, or style of the film.
498;Going from uncertainty to certainty, growing in confidence and ability, going from being a girl who would be queen to a formidable woman who reigns, this is presented well in the space of a few hours.
499;"
500;the equation of the Virgin Queen with the Virgin Mary is an interesting one, at the conclusion of the film, as Elizabeth becomes wedded to England.
501;able age since William Rufus, son of William the Conqueror.
502;the musical score, haunting and suspenseful, meditative and sombre, and finally triumphant, is memorable, but is in fact better experienced apart from the film, where the imagery and dialogue often overpowers the music.
503;acting is masterful, astutely played by Cate Blanchett, Geoffrey Rush (who was nominated for the Academy Award for another Elizabethean period movie, Shakespeare in Love), Joseph Fiennes (who played Shakespeare in Shakespeare in Love), and Richard Attenborough.
504;in the end, 'Elizabeth' is a victorious movie.
505;"nominated role, gives a splendid performance of ""Elizabeth"" in this sometimes strange dramatic rendering of Queen Elizabeth I's early days on the throne."
506;The cinematography and costuming are excellent and Blanchett is simply stunningly beautiful.
507;Her romance with Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester is given a torrid rendering .
508;Also an intriguing look at what it must have been like to be a major world ruler at a time when women were reduced to subservient roles.
509;To survive, Elizabeth transformed herself into an icon and changed the course of British history.
510;The movie Elizabeth like many other historical movies has the original storyline altered to make it more enjoyable to the viewers.
511;Though much of this movie had strayed from the true information the movie gives a great idea of what Elizabeth went through in the time before and the early parts of her reign.
512;The movie Elizabeth though not always true to the story gives a very good idea of what life during Elizabeth's reign would have been like for her.
513;The acting, photography, and sound is near perfect.
514;The last is by far the best known to most Britons of today, and this movie confuses by totally excluding her.
515;but historical omissions aside, this is a sumptuous portrayal of the era, and a great means of getting people intrigued to discover more.
516;cate Blanchett, who isn't English, performs the title role magnificently, by the way.
517;I found the way the picture has been edited gave great depth to an historic character, who was both strong and forthright.
518;I love history movies and this was good but seemed to move slow.
519;I think most history fans will like it.
520;It is a wonderful companion to Shakespeare in Love which also stars Joseph Fiennes, Geoffrey Rush, and Blanchett's friend Gwyneth Paltrow.
521;A treat for lovers of Elizabethan history.
522;Cate's performance is amazing and versatile, for she captures all the essence of a young queen out to rule the way she wants regardless of any man's desires.
523;Nah, but it was entertaining.
524;Cate Blanchett, brings Elizabeth to life, I thought she did a great job acting it (the resemblance to the queen is scary).
525;Although the beginning of this movie when three heretics were being burned alive was rather disturbing, I thought that the overall production of this movie was amazing.
526;Elizabeth capturese the emotions of the time period and is beautifully filmed.
527;The score was incredible and really helped to portray the mood of the film.
528;Cate Blanchett and Joseph Fiennes both played their roles with great accuracy and helped to create a very interesting, informative, and captivating movie.
529;, this is an immensely enjoyable film, and I can say that in all honesty, I generally can't stand watching period pieces.
530;special mention in this film has to go obviously to Cate Blanchett, who deserved her Oscar nomination and then some.
531;But Richard Attenbourough and Geoffrey Rush are equally good, and the costume and set design is nothing short of phenomenal.
532;Watch this film on a big screen and you'll feel like you're a wall in the castle.
533;"i loved this film for the same reason I love ""I, Claudius""."
534;The actors are all on their marks, and they're never found wanting for conviction.
535;own for fans of historical drama, and a damn good popcorn film for those who're waiting for the next Michael Bay film.
536;It came well packaged and quickly.
537;I also enjoy the great price opportunities that Amazon can offer on so many of its items.
538;i felt that this was an extremely well done movie, and the blue ray feature enchanced the enjoyment.
539;I felt that the photography was outstanding in both of the Elizabeth movies with Cate Blanchett, as was the soundtrack.
540;There were a few scenes that had such beautiful scenery . . . beautifully captured.
541;i enjoy watching the occasional well.
542;done period piece, and this version of the life of Queen Elizabeth seemed to have something for everyone.
543;I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and look forward to watching it again.
544;It is one that I will keep in my library.
545;felt present in the movie.
546;cate Blanchett is outstanding as Elizabeth.
547;The whole movie is superb in its depiction of Elizabethan times and medieval culture.
548;christopher Eccleston, now better known as the Ninth Doctor Who gives a great performance as the Duke of Norfolk.
549;A great from director Shekhar Kapur with the amazing talents of Cate Blanchett, Geoffrey Rush and Joseph Fiennes, Elizabeth is one of the best movies from the 1999 Oscar rush, (deserving the Oscar, but trapped in a very tight race with Shakespeare in Love, yet another fine Elizabethian story line) and wowing me with the outstanding script and direction.
550;based on the first years of Elizabeth I reign, every moment and emotion is captured with perfection by each character.
551;Although gruesome at times, the story was very true to most historical documents from the time period.
552;a must see with extremely romantic and historic undertones, it is well written and beautifully pieced together.
553;It may not be history in all it's accurate details, but it's an intriguing tale filled with conspiracy.
554;Excellent acting on the part of the rest of the cast and kudos to the director who did an amazing job of the movie!Therefore, this movie should have won Best Picture at the Academy Awards instead of Shakespeare In Love.
555;Cate Blanchett should have won Best Actress that year too instead of Gwyneth Paltrow.
556;But you will change your mind after you've watched it, I personally guarantee it!
557;This interesting biopic about Elizabeth I, the greatest monarch England has ever known, features excellent acting all around, but is grossly inaccurate on a lot of points.
558;Just some interesting historical details.
559;"I recommend ""Elizabeth I"" starring Helen Mirren and Academy Award winner Jeremy Irons instead."
560;The fact was that, for that time period, Elizabeth wielded a great amount of power.
561;"i especially enjoyed the costumes and the poignant musical selections
562;i even felt that the historical portion of the movie was as well.
563;overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this film.
564;I am of the opinion that the acting was absolutely superb, and that casting was perfect.
565;through this film, history comes alive to tell the story of one woman's quest for self.
566;Cate Blanchett does an amazing job as Queen Elizabeth.
567;But the essence of who Princess/Queen Elizabeth was and what it was like for her to fight for her crown is captured in this amazing movie.
568;All the actors did a fantastic job and thi smovie has exceptional replayability.
569;I've watched it numerous times.
570;I highly recommend this for anyone who is a fan of this era or a fan of Cate Blanchett.
571;She does a fantastic job.
572;Completely believable as the young Elizabeth.
573;def, the video is vivid and bright.
574;the movie itself is one of my best epic movie.
575;two thumbs up to actors and director.
576;story and actors and specially coustom are awesome.
577;cate blanchett is gorgeous and does a fine job of portraying the young Elizabeth.
578;This movie is in my personal list of the top twenty films of the Nineties decade.
579;A superb script supports a dramatic and decisive historic period in England.
580;But certainly I don't want talk about sad things.
581;Please watch and enjoy this superb film and then convince by yourself about the towering acting of Blanchet.
582;And Geoffrey Rush as his most reliable adviser.
583;LOVE this story of a young Queen Elizabeth's rise to power.
584;History aside, a very enjoyable film
585;Cate Blanchett should have won the Oscar hands.
586;She was absolutely superb in the role as Elizabeth.
587;and her supporting cast was also outstanding!
588;From start to finish this movie offers it all: a love story, intrigue, murder, mystery, danger and the rise of one of history's most prominent figures!
589;Elizabeth is an exceptional film.
590;from the costumes, to the hair, to the scenery.
591;notch and gave one a true feeling of the era!
592;The piece is a brilliant representaion of Elizabeth's ascention to the throne.
593;The the love bit was rather take.
594;it I found the overall story line to be full of energy however dark.
595;Blanchet's performance is memorable and one of particular recognition (it brought her an Acadamy award nomination, though prior works are also very commendable).
596;Great movie, I could watch this movie many many times.
597;This portrayal of Elizabeth was on a par with the second season of Blackadder, but not quite so good.
598;I have seen this film twice"
599;I think it is a very good film, but not the type you would like to watch many times.
600;I believe the director has tried to make the film as authentic as possible, and the days of Elizabeth I were very hard.
601;It is an interesting film for those who want to know more about Queen Elizabeth and her era.
602;This was easily the best cast film of 1998, perhaps of the decade.
603;Blanchett's Elizabeth is every bit as complex and, in the end, interestingly enigmatic, and a bit tragic, as was the historic Elizabeth I. those who complain that this movie is filled with historic inaccuracies miss the CLEAR intension of the movie to be a pastiche, a tableaux, an impressionistic look at Elizabeth I's rise to power.
604;Geoffrey Rush's portrayal of the historical Lord, advisor, and protector of Elizabeth I is subtle and utterly amazing.
605;And the writing helps developes the character well, too.
606;This movie is a feast for the eyes.
607;This film proves again that more deaths are caused by religion than any other cause.
608;He is the most powerful ruler in Europe.
609;She has imprisoned her sister Mary who is Catholic and who Philip wants to see enthroned in England.
610;This is a great movie.
611;The acting is excellent with Kate Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush.
612;This film is a masterpiece about a great queen of England, Elisabeth I.
613;She decided that England was above everything, every personal and particular interest.
614;She got rid of all those who were plotting either on the French side or the Spanish side and she declared herself married once and for all with England itself and no other person at all.
615;She became the Virgin Queen in the blood of the plotters and she managed to make the interest of England the only objective of her reign and of all those who wanted some peace at home and abroad.
616;She is probably the real founder of England as we know it : proud, strong and inspired with a world vision that goes beyond imperialism and contemplates the virtues of freedom, justice and human rights, even if she used some tools and methods that were not always perfectly clean : she only hit at the head of all the plots and prevented any civil war, hence protecting the people and their welfare.
617;An excellant film on the life of Queen Elizabeth with a stunning performance by Cate Blanchett.
618;This is Queen Elizabeth's rise to power, warts and all.
619;Two years old when her mother Anne Boleyn was beheaded on her father's orders, in mortal danger for the next 23 years, she inherited her father's (King Henry VIII) intelligence and will.
620;She was taken under the wing of Henry's last wife Catherine Parr and well educated.
621;"Shot in Durham and York Minister Cathedrals, and Warkworth, Raby, Alnwick, Chillingham, Bolton and Haddon Hall Castles
622;OK, so Cate Blanchett looks hot as the young Elizabeth, the costumes are wonderful and the cinematography grand, but.
623;write history to tell a story that is so compelling to begin with?
624;Furthermore, the real exciting part of QEI's reign isn't her ascension to the throne, it's her keeping the throne and manipulating everyone to achieve her ends, and those of England.
625;Beautifully filmed epic film with gorgeous locations .
626;check out those authentic castles!
627;Some good extras as well.
628;I saw this in the theater when it came out and Loved it!
629;Although sad in it's message a wonderful acting job on all sides!
630;This movie was not only beautifully filmed, but was also superbly performed.
631;The historical factors just made this film better, because it runs along truth.
632;Elizabeth I is a great woman of history and I was so elated to see this film so well done.
633;I highly recommend it for anyone and everyone to see just once.
634;This movie plus the sequel are well done.
635;cate is very believable as both the young and the more experienced Elizabeth.
636;It is entertaining, engrossing and flawless when it comes to the costumes,acting and sets.
637;If you want to be truly entertained, then watch this movie.
638;The true history is far more interesting than the pat formula this story turned into.
639;It is a well made movie.
640;After considering Nicole Kidman, and turning down Meryl Streep (one of only three roles she has ever been turned down for), Shekhar Kapur, an acclaimed Indian filmmaker making his English language debut, saw a trailer with Cate Blanchett and knew that he found the perfect Queen Elizabeth.
641;Queen Elizabeth is a well revered monarch, and not much is known about the early years of her reign.
642;The question is, how well does it work.
643;elizabeth is possibly the most beautiful period piece I have ever seen.
644;The cinematography is amazing, the sets and costumes are absolutely breathtaking, and Shekhar Kapur has an eye for bringing out the most in all of it.
645;Shekhar Kapur also brings a more worldly view of the world as well, not just looking at this as the tale of British nobility, but looking at it as a story for the world of coming of age, politics, and religion mixing with politics and the dangers there in.
646;Hirst's characters are well crafted and lived in, which typically is a problem for most period pieces dealing with real subjects.
647;All too often characterizations suffer in these cases because there are so many people who helped make old mold your central character, but Hirst handles these issues deftly to craft great characters and you either empathize with or despise.
648;the acting pedigree in this movie is stellar, and the ensemble cast of course makes the best of a great script.
649;i would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes period pieces, history, and fans of the actors and actresses mentioned above.
650;Personally, I think this is the best work from most of those mentioned above, including Cate Blanchett, which is saying a lot.4.5/5
651;Excellent cinematography combined with incredible acting, set design, costumes, and a spot on script will make this part of English history come alive!
652;Clear, clean, precise examination of a woman from childhood to full adulthood.
653;The story is deep and serious, the characters amazingly well developed, the film about which you can come away having developed some knowledge of English history, Biographical insight, court intrigues, political infighting, and endless machinations that both impress and shock us at the same time.
654;With amazing degrees of class distinction this movie gives us a valid look at the inner workings of royal rights of succession.
655;Then we see the squalor, cruelty and an honest look at the people who made up the mass of society under Elizabeth's reign.
656;we find ourselves sitting as judges on a great queen and her life and times.
657;Yes she is an incredible Exclamation Mark in history as was Eleanor of Aquitaine, and another rare women Boudica .
658;The directors and producers did a good thing they chose authenticity and honesty when this film planned, written and made.
659;see this film if you have any desire to view greatness acted out on a stage that is vast and intimate all at once.
660;Such great work from Blanchett, Rush, Fiennes, Attenborough, and others, makes this picture very enjoyable.
661;Spectacular costumes make it very appealing.
662;And a stark visual effect of lights and setting make it all very believible.
663;Truely a film about a monarch's beginnings that makes you want to read more about it.
664;Few historical movies have been good enough to overlook the historical fact and just plain applaud the performances and the visual work.
665;Elizabeth is one of those movies.
666;The performance by Cate Blanchett is just simply amazing, and she should have won more than a Golden Globe for it.
667;Shekhar Kapur's direction is great, and Geoffrey Rush's experience is evident as the quiet but deadly advisor.
668;Joseph Fiennes is annoying, and Vincent Cassel is hilarious.
669;Elizabeth is well written, well directed, and well acted.
670;This film deserves five stars because it is without a doubt, at least on my part, a high calibre piece of work.
671;My eyes were riveted by the wonderful cinematography, the beautiful costumes and of course, the superb acting.
672;In addition to Geoffrey Rush, Cate Blanchette gives a soul stirring performance as Elizabeth.
673;A feast for the eyes, Incredible production and costume design, Cate Blanchett shines.
674;Cate Blanchett is wonderful here, the best role I've seen her perform.
675;The scene where she is preparing to speak before Parliament is humorous and believable.
676;If you like period dramas, you will enjoy this movie as long as you are willing to take it as just that, a story rather than a history.
677;Geoffrey Rush is great, and some of the minor parts are played very intriguingly.
678;While the historical data may or may not be accurate, it is nonetheless, made believable in this film.
679;It is emotionlly intense and captivating.
680;A wonderfully interesting story about a historical figure we seldom hear about in the media.
681;Wonderful acting, directing, costumes, and screenplay.
682;This was hands down the best movie of 1999.
683;The costumes were lush, the acting was fabulous, the story was full of wonderful intrigue.
684;I love this movie more every time I see it .
685;The characters, the costumes, and the production designs are good enough to make this movie watch able, but it's Blanchett who breathes life into the film and makes it cinema storytelling at its best.
686;the story revolves around the rise of the young Queen Elizabeth I (Blanchett) who would soon become one of England's most powerful rulers.
687;The supporting cast does an excellent job with special nods to the ever elegant Geoffrey Rush, but it's Blanchett who manages to steal each and every scene.
688;Her performance was more than Oscar worthy, and is surely one of her best.
689;some have compared this with `Shakespeare in Love' which includes two of the main leads from this film and was also released in the same year.
690;There are any numbers of unexplained actions, and characters are sometimes hard to identify, but the camera work, color, and scenic backgrounds are superb.
691;Locations are all real, and the acting is uniformly convincing.
692;If an initial viewing leaves you a tad confused, do a little reading on the period, see the film again, and enjoy it all the more.
693;I thought this movie was a captivating look at a sovereign queen's struggles and triumphs in Elizabethan England.
694;Cate Blanchett shines in the role of Elizabeth with a mix of steely determination and an undertone of vulnerability.
695;She is at once confident and uneasy, shifting unresisting from the role of a country residing princess into the queen of a death and sex filled domain.
696;the romance is present in Elizabeth, but it is pure human emotion that takes center stage.
697;Her trials and tribulations merit beautifully crafted scenes, complimented by Blanchett's acting and by Shekhar Kepur's allowance of solitary scenes with Elizabeth.
698;These scenes not only build up her character, but they also allow the audience a peek into the aforementioned vulnerability that underscores her public decision.
699;Elizabeth is a ultimately a classic drama.
700;It combines all the elements of drama, with a historic setting and sweeping characterization that at once intrigues and mystifies.
701;It also has elements of feminism, and if you are so inclined as to enjoy a depiction of a strong woman with human weaknesses, I would highly recommend this movie to you.
702;I would also highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good biography.
703;If you decide to watch this movie, I sincerely hope you enjoy it as much as I did!
704;The entire production is excellently executed.
705;Wardrobe, sets, story all seem to be historically accurate presenting a visual """"fly on the wall"""" perspective to an exciting part of world history."""
706;Cate Blanchette delivers a passionate and soulful performance of her character Elizabeth.
707;The supporting actors were equally well.
708;cast and delivered believable and engaging performances, enhancing the experience.
709;Cinematography was excellent, given the difficulty of some of the scene's sets.
710;I will watch this many times more.
711;Richard II, Henry IV parts 1 and 2, Henry V, Henry 6 (three parts), Richard III, etc., Shakespeare changes events for dramatic purpose.
712;He tries to capture the overall sweep of events and examine the important issues, while telling a good story.
713;elizabeth is a fine film, capturing the feel of the time, and getting the overall issues right, even if it changes the details.
714;The performances are wonderful and the production lavish.
715;There is no question that Elizabeth I was the greatest Queen, and possibly the greatest monarch of either gender, that England ever had,and Cate Blanchett does an excellent job of bringing her vividly to life in Shekhar Kapur's film.
716;And her answer to that question is to reinvent herself.
717;virginized, married only to England and her people, devoting her life and her love to her country and her subjects.
718;But the number of historical bloopers is mind.
719;This stylishly filmed historical drama covers the ascendancy of Elizabeth to the throne of England.
720;Cate Blanchett is excellent as the young princess Elizabeth, who survives the plotting of her half.
721;So if you are a history buff, you may be disappointed, but if you like conspiracy and dark plotting, this is definitely your film.
722;the cast is fine, with Cate Blanchett moving smoothly and believably from the young princess to the care.
723;Joseph Fiennes is good as Dudley, and I especially liked Geoffrey Rush as Walsingham.
724;the cinematography is good, though the director seems to go overboard with top.
725;the surround sound was excellent.
726;Sometimes the score is overpowering but the music is always thrilling (Galliards and Pavanes at the beginning and ending, inexplicably but thrillingly with Mozart's Requiem.)
727;All in all, an enjoyable film, light on the history but well.
728;I enjoyed the story line of this film.
729;Interesting take on this icon of history.
730;Well paced, and a beautiful film.
731;Women historically have proven to be as capable as any man when it comes to ruling, and Elizabeth, as depicted in this film, is portrayed in a very strong, very proficient light.
732;cate Blanchett captures the authority of the noted queen perfectly, rapturing both her shy school girl resonance, then, as she is forced to either flee or fight, we see Elizabeth become the straightforward and forceful, but loyal, leader of England.
733;the heart of the film deals with Queen Elizabeth's most deepened period of turmoil.
734;She is a woman who is deeply in love with a man in the early portions of her leadership, and one that is quite aware of what it means to be compassionate as well as acutely just.
735;Later, we watch this love turn to her nation.
736;the film is highlighted by memorable performances by Rush, Blanchett, Eccelston, and Joseph Fiennes, who plays Elizabeth's lover, Lord Robert Dudley.
737;"this is certainly no ""chick flick"" and is one of the most enjoyable films I've seen this year."
738;I am in love with this era and love the movie because it shows a true depiction of probably what it was like in that time in that place.
739;It is a great movie and highly recommended to Anglo.
740;philes and movie lovers alike.
741;Although the film plays with history a bit, Shekhar Kapur and staff did a fabulous job with cinematography, costumes, and choosing the actors.
742;This sudden shift of personality seems like she is saying Noone can touch me anymore.
743;If you enjoy tales of life for kings and queens of England, you will enjoy this movie.
744;Elizabeth is a fine movie featuring the many talents of Cate Blanchett, Geoffrey Rush, John Gielgud, Joseph Fiennes, Richard Attenborough, and more.
745;Though not historically accurate, it is nonetheless a tribute to the monarch, who is displayed as a woman who progresses from an unassertive individual to one who, as Queen Elizabeth, has the power to create what is regarded as the Golden Age of England's history.
746;Upon resolution, she changes her administration and appoints a confidant who is well aware of the political and religious scenes that threaten her security to the throne.
747;As an ultimate response that seems to set the tone for the remaining third of the picture, she firmly retorts that she is her father's daughter and that if she chooses so, she can have the heart of a man.
748;But I say that that they are only pieces of the formula, because with time she is revealed as an intelligent person who is increasingly cunning.
749;What magnificent acting on the part of every single person.
750;The story, of course, is well known, but having it btought to life so vividly is a treat.
751;Cate Blanchett did a masterful job of acting, the screen play was so well written, the cinematography was gorgeous, the costumes were so elegant, and the story interesting.
752;this film beautifully shows how young Elizabeth takes the thrown of England.
753;well known is the story of the Virgin Queen, this film depicts Elizabeth beautifully.
754;up bring to live this beautiful drama.
755;Cate Blanchett did a wonderful job as Queen Elizabeth!
756;I love this time period and enjoyed this movie.
757;I love this movie, i love the ere in which it represents, Cate Blanchett in a fantastic performance, man you think she is the queen in her great performance of Elizabeth
758;ElizabethScore: 93/100Elizabeth is like a dream of a movie.
759;It's dramatic, mysterious and fact.
760;Not only this, it is the best film of 1998, and it's one of the most amazing Queen movies of the 1990's.
761;Yes, it's that good, an unforgettable and unmissable motion picture event!When catholic Queen Mary (Kathy Burke) dies the succession goes to Elizabeth (Cate Blanchett), the protestant half.
762;Elizabeth realises she has some decisions to make, the most important being who rules England.
763;It's a remarkable thing to feel like you're there, and I have Kupar to thank for that, his direction is marvellous, his effort for this film was astounding.
764;Cate Blanchett's performance is also very unique, the best performance of 1998 by a long shot, she pulls off Queen Mary with power and elegance.
765;The costumes and set decoration are perfect, especially the costumes, which shine brightly and have unforgettable style.
766;elizabeth is a film of tamed passion and emotional beauty, not to be missed and not to be disliked.
767;The first of two films about this very daring, strong and glorious monarch, you will love the costumes and sets as watch Cate Blanchet bring to life one of history's most unique woman characters.
768;Elizabeth goes from a free spirited girl to a woman who learn how to lead an empire.
769;Beautifully done, scenery took me to the places I visited in the early 90s.
770;Cate Blanchett was superb as Elizabeth and the supportive roles of the men were very well done.
771;This movie also helped me understand the Reformation of Great Britain and the beginning of the Church of England.
772;If you can watch the film as a visual exercise, it is stunning.
773;For that it has my four stars.
774;If, like myself, you have a passionate regard for historical detail, you will find yourself fidgeting and dissatisfied.
775;fine performances by Kate Blanchett, and it was enormous fun to see a favourite .
776;ELIZABETH, a solidly made motion picture by Shakar Kapur (director of BANDIT QUEEN), featuring breakout performances by Cate Blanchett and Christopher Eccolston, provides us with technical problems that distract from the beauty of the images that were so compelling on the big screen.
777;This is a captivating film with amazing acting and scenery.
778;Not surprising that this is an award winning film.
779;Cate Blanchett is superbly cast for this role.
780;So far so good, and pointlessly revisionist.
781;nor does the court intrigue.
782;"The fascinating materials are already there
783;For a more absorbing take on this stuff, I recommend the miniseries *Elizabeth R* starring Glenda Jackson.
784;Elizaneth is a great look into a tumultuous time period.
785;There is some artistic license ( the putting on the stone makeup in kind of weird, but it's a movie) the costumes are rich.
786;The characters are real and the story is easy to follow.
787;Elizabeth is a beautiful video!
788;it is something to own.
789;great performances, beautiful set and costumes, interesting direction.
790;it is a movie you can't miss and must see more than one times!
791;Cate Blanchett should have gotten an Academy Award for a terrific performance.
792;anyone that is interested in history and a enthralling movie would like it.
793;I love this movie and watch it over and over it is done very well and a great story.
794;Cate Blanchett is powerful in this movie.
795;She plays a fantastic Elizabeth!!
796;The story is moving to see a queen's heart
797;I chose this movie because the era of time and this wonderful queen and thedaughter of another great women and king.
798;Cate Blanchett did such a wonderfuljob of pulling me into her joy and sadness.
799;If you love period films you'll love this one!
800;The costumes, locations, acting are some of the best I've ever seen.
801;This is one of my favorite films ever!
802;Daniel Craig has a small role in this film as one of Norfolk's co. conspirators in treason .
803;as always, Craig is compelling to watch even briefly.
804;Elizabeth is a beautifully shot film directed by Shekhar Kapur.
805;The period she ruled was often regarded as the most significant period of growth in England's past.
806;Her legacy is a positive one and she is often recognized as the most highly regarded British monarch in history.
807;It covers a more interesting period in my opinion.
808;The way liberties are taken with historical facts inject drama effectively and actually makes up for what should've been a fairly anti.
809;I found it enjoyable either way.
810;The sets and costumes are incredible and the cinematography is also worth praising.
811;The real strength in Elizabeth is Cate Blanchett.
812;She is the best actress of this generation and is amazing here.
813;This may not seem like a timely review (it's about eight years overdue) but with the sequel coming out I recommend seeing Elizabeth.
814;Biographical Period Films are one (1) of my favorite genres.
815;this production is an excellent version for both historical facts and background and for the minimally fictionalized, glorified character named Elizabeth.
816;The production is inspired with individuals drifting in and out of the darkness, both real and imagined.
817;The casting of all the Actors was perfection.
818;i was thoroughly entertained and very impressed.
819;a fantastic spectacle that plays fast and loose with the historical facts in order to make a good show.
820;We're privy to some of Elizabeth's most intimate moments, and watch as she grows into an unsure young girl into a competent ruler, who ultimately becomes one of England's greatest monarchs.
821;the acting is superb, save for an over.
822;top portrayal of a middle.
823;Cate Blanchett eerily resembles the real Elizabeth, and delivers what should have been an Oscar.
824;period clothing!All in all, the scenery is fantastic, the costumes breathtaking, the music haunting, and the acting first.
825;which, in this instance, is even more compelling than the 'fact based fictional movie'.
826;i loved it the two times I saw it years back, and I still believe that this is a lasting classic film to be enjoyed and savoured over and over again for its stellar performances ,cinematography,soundtrack and 2 hour length.
827;if you prefer Glenda Jackson's performance, magnificent.
828;cate Blanchett and the entire ensemble is first class.
829;i was surprised to see Daniel Craig as the murderous priest.
830;The script sounds like it was written by a bad romance novelist and the historical inaccuracies are amazing.
831;The characters are pure stereotype.
832;THIS is definitely my favorite Cate Blanched role!She totally deserved her Oscar.
833;I just loved this movie.
834;Cate Blanchet`s acting was inspiring.
835;It always has been that way.
836;Geoffrey Rush has once more made an incredible job.
837;My heart is still beating.
838;There are some discrepencies in the relationships that Elizabeth had during her early years as Queen of England, but overall it is truly a delight to watch.
839;The star stacked cast as well as Cate Blanchett's wonderful portrayal of Elizabeth I make this movie a must see for any fanatic of the Enlgish Royals!
840;If you enjoyed this movie you must see A E's recount of Queen Victoria's life with Prince Albert in Victoria Albert.
841;The movie has Liza meeting the Duke of Anjou early in her reign.
842;i loved this movie but I wish Directors would read books.
843;this movie will take you back in time and give you a sense of what it was truly like in this era.
844;Such an empowering performance by Cate.
845;this movie will bring you to your knees!
846;This is now one of my favorite films.
847;The acting in this movie is superb, and I think that Cate Blanchett portrayal of Queen Elizabeth is the best I've seen.
848;Yes, this movie does have a few historical errors, but overall, this movie is really worth watching!
849;This is such a well done film, led by an amazing performance by Cate Blanchett in the title role.
850;She is supported by Geoffrey Rush, who also was great.
851;I'll keep it short and sweet: If you want to see a great film with fantastic acting, watch this movie.
852;the one saving grace of that film.
853;Cate Blanchet WAS ROBBED of the Best Actress Oscar statuette"
854;the music is tremendous, the costumes appear most authentic, and again, there is Ms. Blanchet.
855;Oscar has some serious making up to do for this oversight.
856;Being a fan of the great Queen Bess , I think Ms. Blanchett did an outstanding job as Elizabeth and the movie was well acted, though confusing at times.
857;A lot of creative license was taken in the screen play, making an entertaining production but not a historical drama.
858;In fact, some of the scenes/events where total fabrication!
859;This film is visually stunning.
860;The costuming is terrific, the camerawork excellent, the acting superb.
861;The acting is superb but the character portrayals couldn't be further from the truth.
862;The actual Walshingham was in fact very sophisticated and learned.
863;He did run the most elaborate and sophisticated spy network of his day, but he was not a murderer.
864;loved daughter, at the expense of her own happiness.
865;The real Queen was very strong and very seldom displayed this kind of weakness.
866;Elizabeth certainly got a lot of attention when it was released in 1998.
867;For someone familiar with Tudor history it is an enjoyable re.
868;She certainly deserves all the accolades that were heaped upon her it will be hard to ever picture Elizabeth I as looking any other way.
869;The entire drama is an interpretation of the uncertain early reign of this young, brave queen.
870;The way director Shekhar Kapur used his sets, filming his lead characters through grates and red veils, framing each scene so equisitely is breathtaking.
871;He uses everything around the characters in order to give an emotional charge and electricity to an otherwise over.
872;She was delicate and then suddenly powerful, and the way she always has another emotion lurking behind her eyes is marvelous.
873;The relationship between Elizabeth and Dudley is wonderful.
874;It displays themes of how power, trust, and love coincide.
875;The casting is perfect, the locations are sumptous, and the costumes and sets are lavish and beautiful.
876;One of the best films I have, I've seen it about 15 times.
877;I found the film to be consistent and wonderfully written.
878;I felt the film was of the highest caliber and would certainly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the Elizabethan era.
879;This should have been an interesting story.
880;This version of the reign of Queen Elizabeth is Hollywood at its best.
881;The story is presented with historical integrity, the political conflicts are brutal without being gratuitous and the struggle she went through to survive in a man's world is very evident.
882;The camera and design work absolutely beautiful.
883;I also use most of this movie in a couple of my high school history classes to reflect the time period and the students always like it though it takes some explaining.
884;Watch it first for appropriate scenes.
885;Very fun movie, but it isn't a history lesson.
886;The movie was very entertaining.
887;If you are simply not into history, it is worth the 1 1/2 hours to watch the setting and beautiful costumes.
888;It takes you right into the time of when it was supposed to take place.
889;Even though it was not entirely historically correct, it still gave you a great over view of the history, and the scandals of the monarchy, which was what made it entertaining.
890;It was great to see that Queen Elizabeth was able to stay in power for over 20 years as a female, without getting married.
891;This was a good movie and I enjoyed Cate Blanchett's acting.
892;Good story and held my interest throughout the movie.
893;Most films featuring Elizabeth has focused on the mature queen, dealing with the threat of the Spanish Armada or the problematic presence of Mary Queen of Scots, so a film focusing on the young Elizabeth in the early days of her reign is certainly a worthwhile perspective.
894;It is rather interesting that for the most part the good guys have traditional bears and semi.
895;You do have nice symmetry between the opening of the film where the Protestant heretics are being shaved and the closing sequence where Elizabeth's own hair is shaved as she is transformed into the stunning Virgin Queen.
896;The film is more emotionally true than historically accurate, but Elizabeth Tudor is one of the most important figures in the political history of what would eventually become the American republic.
897;Hopefully watching this film will inspire you to find out more about her.
898;This is a magnificent film with a stellar cast giving award calibre performances.
899;Cate Blanchett deservedly won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Drama.
900;Cate Blanchett now joins their ranks with her own incredible performance in that role.
901;She goes from being a young woman, really no more than a girl, who is in love with Robert Dudley, the Duke of Leicester, dashingly played by Joseph Fiennes, to the commanding woman history would ultimately come to know as the Virgin Queen.
902;She succeeded brilliantly, leaving a rich legacy that would be remembered as the Elizabethan era.
903;this film is an absolute masterpiece.
904;While not quite historically accurate, the film is a broad overview of what happened when Elizabeth first took the reins of power.
905;This film is a lush and lavishly costumed medieval tapestry that is woven with great care.
906;It is, without a doubt, a magnificent movie that will hold the viewer in its thrall.
907;I also ordered *Elizabeth The Golden Age, but when it arrives I will send it right back immediately!
908;cate Blanchett and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least.
909;All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!
910;The clash between England and her adversaries (notably France, Scotland, and Spain) is as fascinating as the conflict between Protestantism and Catholicism.
911;Will the Old Catholics be successful in overthrowing her and placing their own man on the throne?
912;I really enjoyed this movie myself.
913;Cate is a marvelous Queen Bess, and we see her metamorphose into the Queen who would be King, because in her time, women didn't count for very much in their own right.
914;The real Elizabeth had often to refer to herself in masculine terms in order to project strength enough to subdue those who would attempt to topple her from power.
915;The shrewdness of the woman is aptly displayed by Cate, and I applaud her for it.
916;Cate Blanchett did an excellent job as Queen Elizabeth.
917;There's no way this amazing brilliant proud ruler RAN after anyone.
918;watched a 2 episode Masterpiece Theater rendition a few days later and found it much more accurate, satisfying and interesting.
919;lots of violence, but still a good plot.
920;Part music video, part historical epic?
921;at least they have the CHOPS to tackle a great role.
922;Elizabeth is quite my favorite member of English Royalty, and I had always felt that her life would make for a brilliant movie.
923;and I cringed and writhed in fury through the whole thing.Yes, I will grant it is beautiful cinematography, costumes, acting, dramatic tension, etc (hence the 3 stars), HOWEVER!
924;It cheapens who this amazing woman actually was.
925;Cate Blanchett does a wonderful job (as did Helen Mirren) portraying young Queen Elizabeth.
926;Staring Cate Blanchett, Joseph Fiennes, Geofrey Rush, Richard Attenborough and an excellent supporting cast (did Emily Mortimer say a word?
927;The screenplay, written by Michael Hirst, is a hodge podge of scenes touching on famous points in Elizabeth's early history with little sense of a time line.
928;It goes for broke with the Elizabeth/Dudley romance, having them wind up in bed once she's crowned (right on, I say, the only thing I truly liked in this film) and intimating a regular intimate relationship between the two.
929;The actors do their best with what they're given and they make it sound almost plausible.
930;I mean, Gone with the Wind one best color cinematography in 1939.
931;i love a good costume drama as much as the next person and if someone is going to diddle with history they better be very good at it to make it plausible and interesting.
932;This movie is great even if you aren't a history buff.
933;the story spans and amazing life, and the transformation in Blanchett is unbelievable.
934;If you are at all familiar with Queen Elizabeth (or owned a Norton's anthology), you will probably experience some dejavu when seeing some of the beautiful scenes.
935;This is an intense movie, and one that will lead you into a real appreciation of Blanchett's abilities.
936;We want entertainment: the full splendour of magic as woven by intriguing plots, sumptuously designed sets, and an over.
937;one finds an excellent treatment of the ascendance to the British throne of this film's title subject.
938;Shekhar Kapur is an expert magician, carefully managing into a fluid package the steamiest bits of the Queen's early reign, deftly helming the ship round an elaborate and exquisite set, and orchestrating the magnificent cast to a fine.
939;One is offered a musing and attractive interpretation of the famous story, and the result is wholly enthralling.
940;chief among its many wonders is its star performer, Cate Blanchett.
941;She is a fascinating actor.
942;She shall be granted a place in that stellar coterie, and that with lavish and deserved praise.
943;great advances in the Age of Discovery came to the world as brought forth by the English and their Queen.
944;She was a staunch patron of the Arts (theatre, the fine arts, artisanry), the maritime sciences, and certainly Literature.
945;By her leave and her purse, the world was bequeathed the jewels of the one of the greatest languages of the West, giving England a proper place in the enlightening advance of the Renaissance.
946;This telling is as diverting and encompassing a version as the whole tale.
947;The names are the only historical part and rest is pure fantasy.
948;"So I called Elizabeth a ""historical fantasy"" movie."
949;With that in mind, I thought Cate Blanchett was great in this movie and her supporting cast did a superb job.
950;"Script had a ""Godfather"" feel to it, especially at the end."
951;But for good simple entertainment, the movie is good for that.
952;"Otherwise, this is a great Hollywood film, much like the other ""historical fantasy"" film ."
953;Within the context of the film, Elizabeth is one of the best of 1998.
954;in costuming, characterization, cinematography, and in dialogue.
955;It is fascinating to watch the transition of Princess Elizabeth dancing in the meadow.
956;we watch as the spontaneous, earthy girl undergoes a metamorphis and emerges as a calculating and brilliant queen.
957;but Elizabeth outwits the men in her court who wish to witness her downfall by becoming the virgin queen and aligning herself with the powerful female icon in the Catholic church.
958;but it has the 'ring of truth' in it.
959;and creates great suspense as the story unfolds.
960;Well, it really opened my eyes to this Queen of England.
961;You can read the other customer reviews to see why this movie is so fantastic, rich in costumes, scenery, acting, drama, etc.
962;"I understand that it makes the movie more interesting to make her this vunerable ""ruling with her heart"" girl who GROWS INTO the strong Queen we've all heard about."
963;But to be honest .
964;"They even included her favorite ""scandalous"" dance ."
965;I recommend this movie to everyone, but please give this woman credit for being strong from the very beginning despite her age .
966;Elizabeth I's life and times were spectacular enough in truth to have made an excellent movie.
967;I did think that Cate Blanchette did an excellent job of portraying the very complex Elizabeth.
968;See it for Cate Blanchette, but realize what you are seeing is inaccurate about the life of England's greatest monarch.
969;About the best thing I can say is that a handful of scenes are at least somewhat evocative and suggest that the costumers did make an effort at doing the historical research which the writers, director and producer clearly did not.
970;This is an excellent film with a great cast, rightly fit for their roles.
971;Combining fact with fantasy, Elizabeth is more entertainment than actual history due for the most part to the dramatization added to the story to keep the viewer interested.
972;regardless of the inaccuracy of the facts, the great costumes and atmosphere seem to make up for a lot, as well as the praiseworthy acting that so accurately depicts these characters.
973;"Like ""Queen Margot"" it's a ""dirty"" historical film ."
974;I'm sure that may be very historically accurate, but I dislike it just the same.
975;The film may take many historical liberties, but it delivers a solid emotional portrayal of the times.
976;The costumes and actors were magnificent.
977;Cate Blanchett gave an incredible performance .
978;This is one of the few films I will likely watch multiple times.
979;This is one of those star filled productions.
980;Costumes, pomp, ceremony, setting and scenery all breathtaking.
981;We thought the acting in this superb.
982;One worth seeing over and over.
983;The acting was very good and the cinematography was also very good up to a point.
984;Robert Dudley was politically ambitious and most likely used his relationship with Elizabeth to further his cause at court.
985;I prefer Glenda Jackson's portrayal of Elizabeth as more historically accurate and how a queen would comport herself.
986;The musical score was good, although not quite historically accurate however, blending Mozart with Elizabethan music.
987;Elizabeth the First was one of the most incredible monarchs in history.
988;She loved her country and her people, and inherited the throne as a young woman at a time when England was dead broke, and only significant in that the rest of Europe was waiting to see whether it would be annexed by France, or Spain.
989;cate Blanchett does a masterful job of showing young Elizabeth as both a young woman, human, and also a brilliant strategist in the making.
990;the movie is rounded out by a fabulous supporting cast, a great script by Michael Hirst, and delightful camera angles by director Shekhar Kapur.
991;if you love history or just a good story this is a movie worth watching again and again, and will leave you wanting to know more about this fascinating individual who had such a profound effect on the future of England, and in many ways all of the West as we know it today.
992;ELIZABETH is the biography of arguably the most famous monarch in British history.
993;language debut, makes sure of that.
994;What we have is a very modern GODFATHER.
995;type epic, set in 16th.
996;cate Blanchett is absolutely amazing to watch as she evolves from innocent youth to hardened political powerplayer.
997;Geoffrey Rush is also extremely good as the sinister Walsingham.
998;He actually reminded me of a British Tom Hanks, if such a thing is possible.
999;Vincent Cassel as the Duc D'Anjou is a hoot as well.
1000;The rest of the actors are pretty good, except for the two Sirs, Richard Attenborough and John Gielgud.
1001;Director Kapur uses many modern innovations, including using jump cuts for a scene where Elizabeth rehearses a speech, and the climax, which reeked of THE GODFATHER.
1002;The subtle cinematography by Remi Adefarasin is both striking and evocative, and adds to the rich tapestry of the film, especially the sets by John Myhre and costumes by Alexandra Byrne.
1003;Although Kapur condenses and exaggerates a few facts in order to suit his vision, ELIZABETH makes for an exciting, entertaining (if somewhat fictionalized) history lesson.
1004;Elizabeth sweeps across the screen with a splendor and a self.
1005;assuredness rarely found in the movies these days.
1006;It races out of the gate in the first scene and stays on course through its brilliant, mesmerizing finish.
1007;It is a film to be savored, and it reminds us that, at their best, movies are truly an art form.
1008;Even Shekhar Kapur, the gifted director whose vision this movie is, admits that this is a romantic interpretation of the early life of one of the world's greatest rulers.
1009;One effect of modern times seems to be that our emotional growth is slower.
1010;willed, worldly monarch who would make England the world's most powerful nation.
1011;Blanchett's portrayal of Elizabeth's mental and physical transformations is acting of the highest order.
1012;the supporting cast is remarkable.
1013;Joseph Finnes smartly plays Robert Dudley as an intelligent but vulnerable character.
1014;Both of these actors also starred in that other Elizabethan event, Shakespeare in Love.
1015;What a year is was for them!
1016;Everything about it was done well.
1017;Cate Blanchett was brilliant and very believable as Queen Elizabeth.
1018;there are lots of great books on Elizabeth, Mary, and the Tudors.
1019;cate's OSCAR performance carried the entire film.
1020;"i will NEVER understand how Judy Dench's 8 minute cameo in""Shakespeare in Love"" won the Oscar ?????"
1021;That said, this is a beautiful, sensitive, and inspiring film.
1022;Especial surprise to see Daniel Craig here on a mission .
1023;Soon enough, a young woman is also arrested.
1024;She is surrounded by many Catholic.
1025;The cast is superb, although I think that it is possible to say that Cate Blanchett's performance is the most remarkable one.
1026;If you're looking for a documentary, go to PBS, if you want a delightful interpretation.
1027;write of history I have ever seen.
1028;Lovely, beautifully acted, blah blah.
1029;If you want to watch a goopy romance movie, there are plenty of much better ones to choose from.
1030;I am not exactly a fan of royalty, but I liked and have great praise for this film.
1031;"Admittedly, ""love conquers all"" ."
1032;we all empathize with lovers and a love story .
1033;"but I believe it is Cate Blanchett the one who has a much greater burden: ""becoming"" the Queen of England !"
1034;"job"", and upon advise and help from trusted friends develops the maturity, experience, and sophistication absolutely necessary to play the role she was meant for: the greatest woman monarch of all times."
1035;"The conflict with the Church subordinated to the Vatican, the complicated and never predictable ""political dance"" with neighboring ""superpowers"" of the time, Spain and France, the more predictable conflict with men, such as The Duke of Norfolk, the costumes, the music, dances, the decoration ."
1036;all are exquisitely laid out in front of us !
1037;Blanchett brings to life, Elizabeth, a woman who has her own passions and more or less secret lovers (Robert Dudley Earl of Leicester, played by Fiennes .
1038;Enjoy a great film !
1039;Since it is difficult for me to go to a theater to enjoy a good movie, it's great to find one of interest I can watch in the comfort of my home.
1040;Elizabeth is a film by Shekhar Kapur about the coming of age of what may have been England's greatest monarch.
1041;It is an exceptional film about an exceptional figure from history.
1042;Cate Blanchett is the title character and she can only be described as brilliant in the role.
1043;This is an actress with some serious talent.
1044;i also enjoyed Geoffrey Rush's performance as Elizabeth's loyal advisor.
1045;Rush is a talented actor ( Shine , Shakespeare In Love ) who pulls off the part with relish.
1046;The second half of the film is, to a certain extent, Rush's film.
1047;wise Joseph Fiennes and Richard Attenborough turn in good performances as Elizabeth's lover and principle advisor.
1048;Elizabeth is, on the balance, an amazing film about a difficult historical figure to pin down.
1049;The strengths of this film are in its two leads.
1050;Blanchett and Rush are both outstanding.
1051;See this movie for their performances alone.
1052;Cate did a great job in this movie.
1053;I loved watching Elizabeth's character grow from a carefree young woman to a daunting rival to those who challenged her rule, yet she was kind despite the need to harden her heart at times.
1054;She did what she had to do to keep the peace in her country.
1055;Cate did a great job in this role and it is probably one of her best performances.
1056;Her emotions were relayed so well in her expressions.
1057;And Joseph Fiennes, well, he's just a sexy guy as well as a compelling actor.
1058;His character was passionate and if you watched his face you could see he truly loved Elizabeth.
1059;The emotions he expressed by merely looking at her spoke volumes and I was impressed by his acting as well.
1060;He does a great job showing intense emotion.
1061;Yet it was still a very good film.
1062;It showed the very divine moments that stand out well in my mind that what in the early part of her rein over England.
1063;That was a very powerful and moving scene to end the movie on.
1064;Wonderful performances by Cate Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush.
1065;the only good things about this movie was that it was somewhat beautiful with its nice costumes and the acting was well done.
1066;One of my favorite time periods in history and this movie does a wonderful job reliving it!
1067;Excellent story to tell and the cast chosen to portray the characters was amazing!
1068;This film as well as the second installment the golden age are both riveting and addicting!
1069;It is beautiful, like a painting or a poem but on screen.
1070;or incredible acting, visual and auditory effects .
1071;Queen Elizabeth I of England is one of the most impressive figures in European history.
1072;She came to the throne in 1558 at the age of twenty.
1073;Her maturation and the development of her status as a national icon were shaped by a series of trials, both political and personal, that took place over the course of multiple decades.
1074;a very real danger .
1075;lived, and the two remained good friends their entire lives.
1076;"For more information on the real Elizabeth, I highly recommend the biography ""The Life of Elizabeth I"" by Alison Weir."
1077;on the flipside, the film is saved by Cate Blanchett's magnificent portrayal of Elizabeth herself.
1078;Blanchett definitely deserved her Golden Globe Award for Best Actress, and she alone is the reason I actually added this movie to my collection.
1079;Blanchett has a very strong screen presence, and really captures the intricacies of Elizabeth's character.
1080;She is the backbone of the film, without which it would undoubtedly have crumpled into a shapeless mess.
1081;do admirable jobs, but the ways in which the film skews their characters undermine their performances.
1082;The only other thing I would really commend this film for is its costuming, which is magnificent.
1083;Elizabeth's wardrobe alone is stunning.
1084;The story and characters pull you in.
1085;and then bring you the check.
1086;screen movie adaptation of the early years of Elizabeth I starts with the arresting image of a group of preachers being burnt at the stake in the reign of Mary I.
1087;Indeed, the subtext with Robert Dudley is spiced up here.
1088;This is definitely a historical epic for the 21st century in that it is vibrant and full of intrigue, blood and sex.
1089;cate Blanchett's performance is extraordinary as her wide.
1090;What's also impressive is the well.
1091;The supporting cast is top.
1092;the recent trend in historical epics has been a joy to watch, although there's rarely a central female performance of such power than Cate Blanchett's here.
1093;This is basically a thriller set against the backdrop of one of the most dramatic periods in European History.
1094;This was an enjoyable, entertaining film with some superb performances especially from Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush as her close adviser, torturer and Assassin Sir Francis Walsingham.
1095;As a historian I think that if any film makes you want to go to your history books after you've seen it then it has definitely been worthwhile.
1096;and you will have to come, many greater and wiser princes to sit upon this throne.
1097;Cate Blanchett plays ELIZABETH I the best I've ever seen and I have seen a lot of actresses do ELIZABETH.
1098;Quite an enjoyable if sometimes inaccurate portrayal of the early years of the Queen's reign.
1099;Cate Blanchett's performance was excellent and her uncanny resemblance to the Elizabeth depicted in paintings was amazing, if not a little eerie.
1100;"The supporting cast was brilliant
1101;Great historical account and a must see for anyone interested in the story of Elizabeth.
1102;One of the best queens that we have ever had in history.
1103;I really enjoyed this movie.
1104;I would recommend this movie to others.
1105;this as an uncommonly accomplished film, in so many ways.
1106;As long as you don't rely on this to pass your English History exam, you will really enjoy this exquisite costume drama about the early reign of Elizabeth I. Beautiful, Oscar nomintaed Cate Blanchett is magnificent as the Virgin Queen and even Fiennes can be forgiven for resurrecting his Shakespeare in Love persona.
1107;The art direction, score, locations and supporting cast are all stellar, although one wonders what they must have paid Sir John Geilgud to be propped up for a handful of lines as the English.
1108;an uncalled for bit of stunt casting.
1109;Cate Blanchett's performance was outstanding!
1110;She is a marvelous actress!
1111;In my opinion, she should have won the Academy Award as best actress.
1112;Anyway, great movie, with a magnificent Cate Blanchett.
1113;Elizabeth is a good movie.
1114;The script and acting are on point and the subject is really interesting!
1115;Cate Blanchett is great in this film.
1116;Elizabeth the person was great, and so is Elizabeth the movie.
1117;It is a highly romanticized adaptation of Elizabeth I's turbulent life.
1118;the movie has two stellar qualities.
1119;The first one is Kate Blanchett, who plays the title character with ease and skill.
1120;Instead of expressing her emotions only through her voice, she takes advantage of her body language .
1121;The director, Shekhar Kaphur, not only wisely exploits all Blanchett has to offer, he decides not to change the pace of the movie by adding more action or drama.
1122;the scenes where Elizabeth defends herself from the accusations and the preconceptions of her councilors are exciting and dramatic, despite their minimalistic concept.
1123;Elizabeth is undeniably a masterpiece.
1124;watchable co. stars Geoffrey Rush, Joseph Fiennes, Vincent Cassel and Daniel Craig), fantastic crew and the wonderful English feel to it make this movie a royal treat, something to indulge in again and again.
1125;All you need to know is this is the best Elizabeth film ever made!
1126;Cate Blanchett played Elizabeth with the right amount of sexuality, innocence, essence and power that could only describe the woman who led England through """" The Golden Age """"."""
1127;If you don't see this film you are missing a wonderful version starring a mesmerizing, charming little lady who took acting to new heights.
1128;This proves once again that the Oscars has nothing to do with talent but personas.
1129;Cate will always be the Best Actress winner of 98.99 in my book.
1130;She is surrounded by a superb all star cast.
1131;Overall I found this to be a worthwhile drama which gives witness to events of a turbulent time in history.
1132;A wonderful movie that absolutely commands your attention.
1133;Cate blachette gives one heck of a performance and was robbed of an Oscar.
1134;Lush costumes, great script, direction and an overlooked cinematic score.
1135;Oh course kiddies, don't get your history lessons from Hollywood, but the film succeeds in getting you curious enough to start your own research on the amazing Virgin Queen.
1136;Blanchett portrays a great Elizabeth and we watch the anguished evolution of a young naive princess to a worldly.
1137;Joseph Fiennes is superb as Dudley, though it's hard to sympathize with an adulterous dolt who wants to have his cake and eat it too.
1138;an incredible performance developing the deliciously complex character of Walsingham, (lots of lessons to be learned from the portrayal of Walsingham.
1139;"It's doubtful that the real Elizabeth Tudor was this naive or this scrupulously just
1140;She was good person and sometime mean to her woman who served to her cuz she was jealous.
1141;Wow, it was true story.
1142;I love to watch true story.
1143;Even if the movie is not very accurate from the true story of Elizabeth I it's still a wonderful movie to watch, just for the beautiful costumes and atmosphere.
1144;the performance of Cate Blanchett as Elizabeth is great, she go threw the young, fragile girl to become one of the most powerful woman in England.
1145;all the actors are very good in this movie!
1146;Very seldom in moviedom, is biography done as well as this.
1147;Unlike others who have played the role she captures better than them all, the human side to England's greatest ruler.
1148;The film, rich in historical details and insight into this amazing monarch, becomes more enlightning every time I watch it.
1149;Cate Blanchette is my """"must see"""" actress, and she spoke the actual words of Elizabeth I with such power that I researched the speeches of Elizabeth I. I also was compelled to read every book on this queen and compare with the film's account."""
1150;What a way to learn history!
1151;I liked the way this film started and ended.
1152;"I can imagine the director saying to himself, ""I'll make it an historically accurate piece."
1153;no, I won't, I'll make it into a love story and let the history stand aside a little.
1154;i must say I especially liked the end of the film.
1155;The final scene was very well done.
1156;Overall, the film was pleasing without being great cinema.
1157;You really have to have some background to be able to appreciate the ins and outs of that particular court.
1158;This movie was very finely acted and the footage was gorgeous.
1159;Sticks to general facts quite well.
1160;Director Shekar Kapur takes us on a beautiful and exhilarating biography of Elizabeth the Virgin Queen.
1161;Every last piece of this film is a work of artm from the editing to the acting.
1162;The cast of actors is extravagent, but the film itself without a doubt belongs to Cate Blanchett in the Title role.
1163;She can effortlessly transform her Aussie accent into anything she wants, without fault.
1164;"ElizabethCate Blanchett does a superb performance portraying Queen Elizabeth I. Strong in character, tender in the heart, she experienced life as most HRH's ""did not dare"" for the time period."
1165;Blanchett poured every emotion she had into this character bringing a convincing life to the film.
1166;Shekhar's Bollywood background probably inspired the vivid imagery, the vibrant colors as well as some of the song.
1167;Elizabeth ascends the throne upon the death of her half.
1168;She ascends at a time when the country is divided in two along religious fault lines.
1169;I thought this movie was well done.
1170;Cate Blanchett was a perfect choice for the part, from the books that I have read about Elizabeth I, Cate was perfect.
1171;As far as I can tell, this film has got all its historical facts right, but not necessarily in the right order.
1172;The Tudor dynasty was a violent period, and the opening shot of heretics being burnt at the stake captures that period perfectly.
1173;The sheer horriblness of this period is what makes it so fascinating, and Shekhar Kapur doesn't let us down.
1174;The drama is so taut and well paced that I am gripped by this film each time I see it.
1175;The acting is spot on.
1176;A wonderful performance by a fine actress whom I am sure will go on to have a great career.
1177;worship Elizabeth, but it does show her resourcefulness and inner strengths and why she is such an important historical figure.
1178;I gave this a five star for the beauty of the scenery, the subject had credibility, and the acting was fantastic.
1179;I would recommend this movie for anyone who loves British history, art and theatre interests!
1180;Cate Blanchett is indeed a great actress.
1181;Most of the characters are simply unrecognizable as historical figures.
1182;eight years old at Elizabeth's accession in 1558, and remained her chief minister for forty years, succeeded by his own son, Robert.
1183;seals this film's fate, revealing the utter ineptitude of its producers.
1184;Someone should make a good film about Elizabeth I, she's certainly a fit subject for one.
1185;This movie is filled with intrigue and suspense, and that keeps me watching this movie many times a year and in my permanent library.
1186;Very well made movie and Kate Blanchett was magnificent.
1187;I felt this was a very good movie, good acting and I think Cate Blanchett is a excellent actress.
1188;I saw the Gift and she did an excellent job.
1189;She was one of the greatest rulers of England.
1190;Elizabeth has occupied a spot in my personal Top Ten of all time movies since it was first released.
1191;Cate Blanchet is luminous as Elizabeth I, the costuming is sumptuous, set design and scenery are breath taking, the acting superb and the direction without fault!
1192;Cate Blanchett's performance was magnificent.
1193;Her portrayal of Elizabeth made the movie into so much more than a history lesson.
1194;She carried this wonderful movie into the land of classics.
1195;The supporting cast were excellent.
1196;Elizabeth's musical score stirred the soul and embraced each scene with grace and emotion.
1197;How she made herself the vulnerable woman at the beginning of the movie to the monarch at the end was fascinating to watch.
1198;"the rest of the cast is superb
1199;In and of itself, as a movie, this film is superb.
1200;She was an extremely intelligent woman, who was fluent in many languages and who had extensive classical learning.
1201;she NEVER slept with him, she was a true virgin.
1202;Dark, chilling, and at times rather terrifying, it is a pleasure to the senses and a joy for those who like their minds provoked.
1203;This movie takes lots of liberties with the actual history.
1204;but as a movie, it excels.
1205;This one manages to be riveting and yet deal with the history pretty well.
1206;is exquisitely vivid and wrenching.
1207;the settings and costumes are gorgeous, and the acting by everyone is splendid.
1208;but what really sets the movie off is the writing: tricky, intelligent, telling just enough and leaving lots of suspense.
1209;With the renewed interest in renaissance, it helps its viewer understand the history this woman made in her lifetime.
1210;Highly recommend if you like Game of Thrones, or The Tudors.
1211;create the beautiful world of the Renaissance.
1212;From the breathtaking settings to the costuming, it makes you feel in the era.
1213;but what most makes this film work is the superb cast.
1214;And Blanchett commands this film from her thrown, fully deserving all the praise she has received.
1215;following the trail as Elizabeth goes from princess to her rocky start as queen, the film captures the spirit of the era with the music, bawdy humor and language.
1216;And that's how you tell if a historical film works: If it makes you want to learn more about its subject.
1217;for lovers of film and historical fiction, Elizabeth delivers on all levels.
1218;I believe """"Shakespeare in Love"""" was a big hit that year and I passed them both off as costume dramas."""
1219;It is, at times, a dark look at the intrigue of royal politics while, at other times, a bright view of a young lady coming of age in a variety of ways.
1220;This is England in the midst of one of its' greatest crisies and we are reminded that, with the stakes so high, the ruthlessness rose as well.
1221;I took a moment to check my old English History textbook (Willson) and found enough brief mentions of characters and events to let me know that this is a biographical movie based in fact.
1222;This development in her is brought out in a convincing series of personal glimpses and events.
1223;confidence that would take her into the realm of greatness.
1224;The rest, as they say, is history and one that I was pretty comfortable with.
1225;"Regardless of the accuracy of every detail in the movie, ""Elizabeth"" gave me a greater appreciation of just who England's greatest queen really was."
1226;To have done so in such an entertaining manner was a most enjoyable icing on the cake.
1227;I ran to the cinema!
1228;All the elements come together perfectly.
1229;Elizabeth is a great movie which accommodates both the world of facts and history with the world of entertainment and Hollywood.
1230;The movie is a relatively accurate historically, but overall it focuses on the way it really was back then and is an exciting film.
1231;"If you are looking for factual history, read a book
1232;First, the casting was brilliant: I agree with the previous reviewer who felt Cate Blanchett was robbed of her Oscar.
1233;Joseph Fiennes's Dudley was able to gain my sympathy despite his treachery and Geoffrey Rush was superb as always.
1234;The film's additional casting, direction, costuming, editing and intricate story captivated me.
1235;When I want to be entertained, or escape reality, I watch a movie.
1236;But it was good enough to make me want to know those facts, and I think that is the value of movies as entertainment.
1237;So I'm heading to the nearest bookstore to get the very best historical and factual accounting of Elizabeth's reign, in all its complex splendour.
1238;An ominious start to a dark tale of love, lust and power.
1239;Elizabeth is portrayed at first as a woman of the world who takes great pleasure in playful, sensual dancing with her lover.
1240;She seems willing to take risks to be with the man she supposedly loves.
1241;queen Elizabeth she tells """"Joseph Fiennes"""" who was absolutely brilliant in this movie and every woman will just wish she was the one being persued so pationately."""
1242;"
1243;The costumes are stunning and Joseph Fiennes is excellent in this movie.
1244;I was always impressed by Queen Elizabeth I, learning about her through the history courses at the college and watching several movies on Henry the VIII.
1245;Elizabeth has turned England into one of the most powerful kingdoms in Europe and at the beginning of her power England was weaker kingdom.
1246;That woman was extremely intelligent and I am impressed by her personality and intellect.
1247;Kate Blanchet plays her role with great mastery.
1248;Always love historical pieces, speeches, portrayal of religious and social circumstances in England at the time.
1249;Well done film which is a must.
1250;Many hours of viewing pleasure.
1251;An extraordinary pitch perfect performance as the young Queen Elizabeth.
1252;Brilliant palace intrigue and acting performances that are truly remarkable.
1253;Just remarkable film making and directing by Shekhar Kapur in both films.
1254;willed and totally maledependent .
1255;Elizabeth embodies the characteristics of truly great filmmaking.
1256;The transformation of this innocent and uncorrupt creature brilliantlly produces a strong and empowered figure, despite all obstacles.
1257;The style of this period is captured quite effectively, most evident in design of period costume and stage.
1258;Elizabeth transcends the less than accurate account of history by creating an emotionally satisfying experience for the viewer.
1259;Such scenes as Enigma with Joseph Fiennes is as climactic as it is chilling.
1260;Despite all obstacles, Elizabeth represents the remarkable power of the human spirit.
1261;A refreshing and passionate performance.
1262;The movie was the winner of the Golden Globe Award for Drama and Cate Blanchett won the best actress award.
1263;Geoffrey Rush, Richard Attenborough, and John Gielgud are Academy Award winning actors as well.
1264;Elizabeth kept Robert alive to remind her """"just how close"""" the Queen had been """"to danger."""
1265;A deeper symbolism was revealed in two scenes in this movie.
1266;i rate this movie a 5 stars movie because it is one of the most enthralling and believable versions of the life of Queen Elizabeth that has been made.
1267;The gowns and sceneries were beautiful.
1268;I find that I watch the kind of movies over and over that make me aspire to be greater than who I am and this is one of those movies.
1269;piercing, original insight into Elizabeth's character, a new take on her inner circle of advisors, a revelation that she actually wasn't a virgin, something.
1270;Elizabeth is a visually stunning and powerfully written film based on one of the great monarchs in history.
1271;Director Shekhar Kapur gives us a rich tapestry of characters and locations, feelings and history.
1272;Richard Attenborough, Geoffrey Rush and Joseph Fiennes all deliver noteworthy performances as well.
1273;The screenplay by Michael Hirst is smart, poetic and full of political intrigue.
1274;The music by David Hirschfelder is marvelous, it creates mood and provides some rich melodies like the love theme.
1275;What Kapur does with great success here is transport us to another world and time, we feel like onlookers viewing a great drama unfolding.
1276;There is pure suspense in how Elizabeth must find a way to survive and overcome her enemies.
1277;Elizabeth is a powerful experience, you can view it for the characters and drama and simply enjoy the cinematography, which is done with the eye of a painter.
1278;And of course there is the human side of the film.
1279;Elizabeth is a wonderful tapestry of a movie, not to be missed by admirers of focused, intelligent and visually rich filmmaking.
1280;"the movie is really great, it has it all
1281;Everything is just beautiful, and the colours are amazing.
1282;if that 's the case, it's great.
1283;The characters are totally 2 dimensional and signposted throughout.
1284;Here's the heroine, here's the traitor, here's the devious advisor.
1285;It is indeed a sumptuously filmed movie with marvelous costumes.
1286;But then maybe some feel grungy is sexy, who knows.
1287;The performances are fair on the part of the principals, but in the opening scene.
1288;a true light, wainscoted marvel, not the dingy gothic conglomerations more like a cathedral shown here.
1289;She had attended the wedding.
1290;He was always her favorite advisor, and even took his son, Robert Cecil (the future Lord Salisbury) into her service on Burghleys death.
1291;Leicester, Robert Dudley, remained the queen's favorite until his death.
1292;he was given command of the army in the lowlands and entrusted with the defense of the realm in the years of the Great Armada, 1588.
1293;This movie has plenty of the later.
1294;But as a classic or as history.
1295;Directed by Shekhar Kapur and starring Cate Blanchett, this film examines Elizabeth's gradual transformation from being a free.
1296;spirited, lusty, at times reckless, and often silly young princess to becoming a sanitized, somber, and worldly.
1297;He gathers what we now call intelligence data from his espionage network which extends throughout Europe and even goes after important information himself, when necessary.
1298;He also serves as a high.
1299;We know that he served as her secretary of state from 1773 until 1590, was a member of the privy council, and knighted in recognition of brilliant and loyal service to her.
1300;The Duke of Norfolk and the French Duc d'Anjou (Vincent Cassell) are much more interesting characters, primarily because the former poses the most serious threat to Elizabeth and the latter provides some delightful comic relief.
1301;With substantial dramatic impact, it reveals how and why England's survival literally depended on someone who eventually proved to be a much greater leader than her father, Henry VIII.
1302;The movie is an imaginative interpretation of the way that things could have been.
1303;the film shows Elizabeth growing up in an incredibly unstable, tumultuous environment.
1304;And it's a very relevant period of her life, because she was 25 when she became a female monarch.
1305;This movie was a surge of emotional and spectacularly vivid images.
1306;The choice of actors in this movie are top.
1307;notch, and the realism blew me away.
1308;It will remain as one of my top.
1309;Great acting, incredible sets .
1310;And Joseph Fiennes captured the essence of Robert Dudley as I imagine him in his youth and as he appears in a portrait painted of him as a young man.
1311;the 1970's film, """"Mary, Queen of Scots"""", more faithfully captures the true essence of Elizabeth (albeit still distorting historical fact)."""
1312;While the film focuses on Mary and her travails, Elizabeth's story is well represented here, too.
1313;"but ultimately, the portrayal of Elizabeth I that catches my breath, that speaks to me across the centuries is the Elizabeth of Sharon Kaye's novel, ""Legacy""."
1314;"If you are a ""fan"" of Elizabeth or just want to read a good book, find it, if you can, and ENJOY!"
1315;A little violent but otherwise a great story of a strong Queen.
1316;cate Blanchett is fabulous as Queen
1317;Cate Blanchett played a marvelous Elizabeth, almost looked exactly like her as well.
1318;She has the right accent and even the right attitude to play the Virgin Queen.
1319;Strength was a bright aura around Cate throughout the entire film as well as the famous quick.
1320;The only place they did a real doozy on was this passionate bond between the Duke and Elizabeth.
1321;this movie is passionate and bold, showing how a woman ruled England in the most harshest times for women to even own their own household much less an entire country.
1322;Cate illuminated the Virgin Queen perfectly in both her strong moments and in her unsure times, telling the story of a princess shut out of society and then ultimately being thrown into royalty after her sister dies.
1323;this film is above all a great biography of Elizabeth.
1324;It shows the passion, strength, courage, pride and tender heart of Elizabeth.
1325;This film is a must see and I rcommend it to all alike.
1326;Beautiful movie made after my second favorite figure in history.
1327;This movie does her legacy justice.
1328;This is a great movie if your religious or love politics (they're intertwined in this movie).
1329;Also from what I read it had a fair share of historical inaccuracies.
1330;While this is an engaging and entertaining movie, it rides roughshod over the facts of history.
1331;watch it for entertainment, but NOT history.
1332;But this film is a lavish spectacle that acquaints the viewer with the early portion of Elizabeth's reign and rule.
1333;this is an engrossing and enjoyable film.
1334;For the American viewer who is doubtless less familiar with English history, it serves as a fine and entertaining introduction to Queen Elizabeth.
1335;going fascination with good queen Bess these days.
1336;Sets are medieval, costumes are gorgeous.
1337;This baroque offering tells the tale of how the embattled Elizabeth (Cate Blanchett) .
1338;She can be funny (telling the Bishops that it doesn't matter which suitor of France or Spain is superior .
1339;Jeff Rush is also great as her Elizabethan.
1340;Still Blanchett carries the film, helped by excellent cinematography which creates an England shrouded in gloom.
1341;The movie gets 4 stars for entertainment value.
1342;The aesthetic qualities of the film are excellent, no doubt, but often foray into some Vegas.
1343;best way to watch this movie.
1344;clear your mind of any notion that the characters portrayed were in any way real historical figures!
1345;I love this version of Elizabeth.
1346;Cate Blanchet is amazing and so is Geoffrey Rush.
1347;My favorite character is Joseph Fiennes' portrayal of Lord Robert.
1348;"Maybe it's the romantic in me
1349;This film is one of the best portrayals of Elizabeth put on film.
1350;I recommend it without qualification.
1351;Excellent acting and incredible costumes.
1352;this historical drama is informative as well as entertaining.
1353;All of the actors do an amazing job.
1354;I really liked the movie when it first came out, but when I recently watched it again after watching all 4 seasons of the Tudors .
1355;They were both written by the same man and the Tudors was much more historically accurate than Elizabeth was.
1356;they just wanted to make a great movie against the backdrop of some highly interesting history and they accomplished this the best way anyone could.
1357;And it was this Queen who led England during her reign from near bankruptcy to extraordinary prosperity.
1358;The movie is a great movie and it's actually an intriguing thriller.
1359;The costumes are just perfect and Cate Blanchett delivers an excellent performance.
1360;This motion picture doesn't have the usual glamour of similar movies set in this era, but instead the set was kept pretty authentic and that makes this movie even more interesting and enjoyable.
1361;One of the bets I have seen.
1362;Watched it more than once and still enjoyed it very much.
1363;Actually,I give this movie 4 1/2 stars.
1364;In today's techno world, where even some Shakespeare movies have given way to Hollywood, this is a masterfully done movie that relies on character development, a superb script, and beautiful scenery as opposed to effects.
1365;The movie grabs our attention right away with Bloody Mary's psychotic and ill use of power.
1366;One truth this movie reveals is that whatever the faults of her father King Henry VIII were, he was a strong and able king for those hard times.
1367;(When he is spoken of, he is spoken of well.)
1368;It may help us to appreciate this movie more if we remember that Elizabeth's grandfather King Henry VII ended The War of the Roses"
1369;And Bloody Mary quite undid the fine work of her father and grandfather.
1370;Another thing I must say about this movie is that the violent scenes are done well.
1371;Also, our attention is well kept between Elizabeth's personal emotional struggles as well as her struggles to restore England to the state her father and grandfather did.
1372;Yet this movie which is so masterfully done has a limited popularity.
1373;This film pulls you in from beginning to end.
1374;Cate Blanchett at Elizabeth I is simply ingenius casting.
1375;Elizabeth has been portrayed in so many other films by marvelous actresses in their later years that we seem to have a picture of a rather stiff and cartoonish type monarch when we think of Elizabeth.
1376;Cate dispels this image from the start.
1377;joseph Fiennes does a marvelous job of playing Robert Dudley.
1378;The love story is entertainingly expanded upon as well as the various plots against Elizabeth's life by catholic followers.
1379;Elizabeth's flirting way of holding her privy counsel at bay on the issue of marriage are in excellent evidence here.
1380;"She bravely proclaims ""There will be one Mistress here and NO Master!"""
1381;The fifth star is only withheld here for historical innaccuracy, but it in no way hampers the flow or entertainment value of this lavish and lovely film.
1382;Her performance, in a role that has been played by some of the greats, is both fearless and vulnerable all at the same time.
1383;first thing that hooks me up is the fascinating lighting and the camera angles that perfectly complement it.
1384;Darkly lit shots of glorious British castles.
1385;Not just grand in fact but gorgeously color coordinated.
1386;Beautiful, rich, exquisite, exciting and just plain superb.
1387;deserved Oscar nomination for best actress for her portrayal of England's most famous Matriarch, Elizabeth I. the movie gives insights into what was going on with Elizabeth's half.
1388;the acting and scenery are breath.
1389;Nevertheless, this is a spectacular piece of filmmaking.You get a deeper respect and awe for the historical person of Elizabeth, realizing what she overcame despite being a woman in a time when women were only accessories to men.
1390;A true leader and a queen passionate about her very important role .
1391;i'm not a history buff, but I loved this film.
1392;If you're going to get this film, this is the format in which to view it.
1393;Elizabeth I is by far my favorite historical figure, a powerful and fair woman who defined an entire age, lifting her country out of squalor into greatness.
1394;Although historically inaccurate, Kapur's Elizabeth is a masterpiece of cinematography.
1395;great cast, including Geoffrey Rush and Sir Richard Attenborough, Elizabeth is a feast of photography, words, history and acting.
1396;I highly recommend this film, and am looking forward to Elizabeth: The Golden Age.
1397;In a year overwhelmed with reminiscent films, Elizabeth rises above the rest to become one of few stunning manifestations of the Hollywood Renaissance.
1398;Certainly acknowledged by the Oscars garnering 7 nominations, Shekhar Kapur's intimate portrait of a young Elizabeth further expands the modern view on a distant monarch, whose maturing reign as well as taming nature continued to dazzle the 20th century viewers.
1399;presented here by a superb cast led by Golden.
1400;globe winner Cate Blanchett, early Elizabethean era turmoil and upheavel are captured brilliantly.
1401;The lush set itself is a feast for the eye as the audience is drawn to follow a passionate young Elizabeth's path.
1402;Cate Blanchett does a fabulous job capturing the details of a frustrated young woman waking to the merciless reality of queenhood.
1403;If you're looking for a movie with all the intrigue of a good Mafia flick and a lead character as fascinating as Elizabeth Bennett in PRIDE PREJUDICE, see this film!
1404;I've had to go back for several viewings, and I'm as enthusiastic as ever about Cate Blanchett, the script, the cast, the art direction .
1405;I think you may find it irresistible.
1406;cate Blanchett is truly amazing.
1407;A virtual unknown when Kapur selected her for this film, Cate owns the role all the way from the naturally beautiful, frolicking young Princess to the awe.
1408;Her expressive face is very easy to watch in all her moods.
1409;In fact, this is a very convincing effort to deduce the methods and manner by which Elizabeth evolved to her ultimate power and glory.
1410;I think they've done a spectacular job of connecting the dots and giving us, at least impressionistically, a look at the likely forces at work.
1411;It's young and vital and suspenseful and very engaging.
1412;The movie is lush and beautiful, but the film is all about human beings, motivations, machinations and the stream of life.
1413;Blanchett carries the film along with ease, even in its most difficult passages, and is framed by a great cast as well.
1414;and the exotically beautiful Fanny Ardant as the conniving and bloody Mary de Guise.
1415;invention of herself as the 'Virgin Queen' .
1416;for good (at least, in public).
1417;a fine job of rendering by the way and some nice extra featurettes.
1418;Mainly, it is a Cate Blanchett tour de force which establishes her as a major star, but it is also a triumph of the British cinema and an instant classic .
1419;in fact I enjoyed this movie far more than the other period film released at the same time, SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE.
1420;You are going to see much more of Cate Blanchett in future, after all.
1421;A bit more violent than I appreciate, but worthy of a viewing or two.
1422;Cate owns it, but the others also do well.
1423;Cate should have won the Oscar, no question.
1424;I am a fan of historical fiction, and this has to be one of the most historically inaccurate films I have ever seen!
1425;Why tamper with history, when it was actually more fascinating than what was portrayed in this movie.
1426;He worshiped herstatus is what it was about for him.
1427;And they made her out to be so smart in the movie, yet thiswas the stupidest oversight on her part.
1428;an interesting view of the depravity of man in the churchI think of Jesus our Christ reeming out the church officials in the wholechapter of Matthew 23.
1429;You hold the kingdom of heaven before the children.
1430;In general the movie was very enjoyable, it is very interesting and extremely entertaining.
1431;Although the actual plot might not be fully true, the movie helps show many other aspects of the time period, such as language, costume, and architecture, it does this very well which helps make it a bit more accurate.
1432;The movie is spellbinding, artsy, will definitely hold your attention if you're a history buff.
1433;Cate Blanchett gives a compelling performance despite a highly flawed script, well worth the Oscar nomination she received.
1434;Joseph Fiennes, so endearing in Shakespeare in Love, is wooden and plodding here as Robert Dudley, the man Elizabeth loves.
1435;and a lot more entertaining in the long run!
1436;I love watching Cate Blanchett play such a strong female role (and do a good job).
1437;From start to finish, the movie is exciting.
1438;This is of course a great movie.
1439;The acting superb and well match with the sequel.
1440;This is an amazing period drama with a slew of exceptional actors like John Geilgood, Christopher Eccleston, and even Kate Blanchet excels as the lead role too.
1441;Loved the character portrayals, costumes and sets too they really captured the period and as a Brit from what I could see appeared to be historically accurate too.
1442;A must see if you like period dramas.
1443;The result is a stunning spectacle of Elizabethan life and politics that simplifies and sometimes deviates from history, but is never dull.
1444;but perhaps the greatest deviation of the film from history is its portrayal of Elizabeth's favorite, Robert Dudley, as a shallow boy toy.
1445;The real Robert Dudley was tall and athletic and an expert jouster.
1446;But he also studied science and mathematics, was a brilliant conversationalist, and (most important) could make her laugh.
1447;Elizabeth is a fine biopic that deals with the early reign of Elizabeth I, the Virgin Queen.
1448;But these shortcomings are made up by good performances by a unique cast.
1449;"Cate Blanchett (""The Lord of the Rings"" Trilogy) gives an immensely powerful and intimate portrayal of Elizabeth I, and Christopher Eccleston (""The Others""
1450;The supporting cast (Which includes Joseph Fiennes, John Gielgud, Geoffrey Rush, Daniel Craig and Richard Attenborough) also give strong, solid performances.
1451;overall, this is a good film that takes a unique and unrelenting look at the Queen who changed the history of Britain forever.
1452;Every aspect of this film is flawless.
1453;All period films should use this one as an example of how to bring history to life.
1454;I'll resort to my simple Hits and Misses on this one:The HITS:1.
1455;This film is flawlessly acted by all.
1456;earned her Oscar nomination that year, Geoffrey Rush and the suburb, but under appreciated Sir Richard Attenborough (The Great Escape,A Passage To IndiaandJurassic Park) are outstanding in their supporting roles as is the rest of the terrific cast.2.
1457;Exquisite photography, costume design, and settings bring this period piece to life.
1458;The audience is immersed in the era.3.
1459;This film is lovingly directed.
1460;The script is pure gold and provides the brilliant foundation for this outstanding film.
1461;My top three performances of all time.
1462;Given this story, I'm surprised a sequel was given a chance to see the light of day.
1463;I love this film and have watched it several times, Kate Blanchette is amazing as the Queen.
1464;This movie is the seminal work whose beauty and perfect execution and casting inspired writers of a number of excellent books in its wake.
1465;Elizabeth incited a devoted following by presenting the story of the young queen with new insights into the pivotal influences that affected her life, and the course of history.
1466;Throughout the rest of the story, Walsingham emerges as a ruthless defender of the queen's success.
1467;liberties are taken in terms of the timing of certain events and historical figures, but the screenplay and perfect casting of this film well outweigh factual flaws.
1468;She springs into the limelight a fully formed talent with an excellent supporting cast.
1469;Cate Blanchett did a awesome job had me interested the entire time.
1470;I like Cate Blanchett she is a very good actress gets into her charactor strong women in this movie as the charactors think she is not capable of being Queen well she was Queen for 40 years and no King to rule over her.
1471;Shows us how strong woman can be in any century!
1472;This movie is beautifully staged and filmed and very well acted.
1473;don't get me wrong: this is a great film.
1474;Cate Blanchett is outstanding in her role as Elizabeth.
1475;if you have a British costume drama about someone from Victorian or Elizabethian times you are sure to be nominated for an Oscar.
1476;Highlights are the beautiful sets and the wonderful and multiple costumes and hair styles on Ms. Blanchet, who gives a very good performance.
1477;the direction, meant to make a bold statement with its odd camera angles and rapid fire edits, gives the movie a music video feel that ultimately detracts from any attempt to take the viewer to a distant and exotic place.
1478;One will have to look elsewhere to learn about this incredible woman and the Golden Age she created.
1479;Excellent film with perfectly chosen actors.
1480;I enjoy period and history pieces.
1481;Truly wonderful film, gorgeous costuming, historical accuracy, shows what really went on in Elizabeth's lifetime, just wish there'd been a sequel!
1482;Highly recommended for a cold night with a good glass of red and excellent company~
1483;This is one of my favorite Films.
1484;The picture is good, the sound is good, the extras are good.
1485;cate Blanchet gives a nuanced, remarkable performance that redeems the story's slight distortion of history and actual facts.
1486;As good as Gwyneth Paltrow was in Shakespere in Love, Cate Blanchett's performance was the better of the two and was far more deserving of an Academy Award.
1487;Here's the story of Elizabeth's rise from a timid, unsure monarch to a powerful and confident Queen.
1488;Cate Blanchett is fantastic as the magnificent Queen Elizabeth although historians may disagree!!
1489;summary: Nice film, great ending.
1490;Both came to power at extremely young ages, and at times of political instability which would have set the odds of survival against any new ruler, but particularly so, against a woman.
1491;Both beat those odds in ways few people would have foreseen: They not only persevered but ruled for a nearly unparalleled long time, and during their reign achieved to both strengthen England's economy and international stance and give new direction to its society.
1492;The princess, as this movie sees her, certainly knew her insecurities about her role in life and in English politics, her people's expectations, and the intrigues of her own court.
1493;Richard Attenborough plays Sir William Cecil with a humility and quiet dignity that few besides him could have brought to the screen.
1494;Christopher Eccleston bristles as the powerful, ambitious Catholic Duke of Norfolk, that key player from the inner circle of Mary's court who retained his position after her death and became the one member of Elizabeth's council most dangerous to her reign.
1495;eyed, handsome lover from the almost simultaneously released """"Shakespeare in Love"""" (which, while a splendid movie in its own rights, eclipsed much of the limelight that """"Elizabeth"""" would so richly have deserved), playing the man most closely romantically linked to Elizabeth, """"Sweet"""" Lord Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, whose love for her ."""
1496;"key to any great historical movie is the authenticity of its production design, and ""Elizabeth"" overflows with the rich and luxurious colors of the queen's renaissance court and its balls, gowns and pageants."
1497;"must be able to touch the divine here on earth"" and as yet, ""they have found nothing to replace [Mary]."""
1498;And so, this movie tells us, the icon we all know was created .
1499;I gave it 3 stars because I hoped for a strong and confident Elizabeth, Cate Blanchet is a wonderful actress and played her role very well but the story was a little weak.
1500;Great period piece, to me this is better than the one with Helen Mirren and I love Helen Mirren, Cate Blanchett is also in the 2nd Elizabeth the golden age, which is great also.
1501;I was interested about English history and this film, along with Elizabeth: The Golden Age, are great for understanding the beginning and continuance of the Elizabethan Age.
1502;Extremely well put together and superb acting make this film a keeper.
1503;This is a wonderful film with a great cast giving pitch.
1504;Cate Blanchett won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Drama, and should have won an academy award (Gwyneth Paltrow, the winner for her work in Shakespeare in Love, was good, but it was hardly a performance or a film near the caliber of Cate and Elizabeth).
1505;what's good about this movie is the acting.
1506;Cate Blanchett and Geoffrey RUsh are amazing and while Joseph Fiennes is little more than window dressing, the rest of the ministers have their ticks.
1507;The story is intriguing and even though it patterns itself after the Godfather (including a everyone gets killed at once while our hero is in a religious setting scene) it did pattern itself after something great.
1508;So great movie on its own.
1509;It's one of the best books written about English history.
1510;It was an outstanding performance.
1511;I was hooked from beginning to the very end.
1512;elizabeth by comparison is delightful if slightly grim at the beginning.
1513;Mary historically was concerned about Elizabeth's succession.
1514;Geoffrey Rush is great as a highly fictitious intelligent agent.
1515;kate Blanchett is brilliant in the title role.
1516;She portrays well the initial trust that she has with her courtiers something which gradually changes to a steely hardness.
1517;She deserved an Oscar for the performance.
1518;Some have criticized the film for playing loose and hard with the truth but it is at least as historically accurate as Shakespeare.
1519;Cate is one of those actresses that I'd watch read the phone book.
1520;I thought they lessened Geoffrey Rush's character a bit in this film but I loved it nevertheless.
1521;I give it 5 stars and I think you will too!
1522;This is a great examination of life in 16th century England, and the circumstances that made Elizabeth I one of the greatest monarchs in World History.
1523;The best part is that we see the young Elizabeth: passionate, vulnerable, and most of all, human.
1524;reformation of the mid.1500's, and facing love and marriage issues that would challenge man or woman, Elizabeth at the end of the film chooses the only path open to her to secure her throne: to transcend humanity and become an icon.
1525;The last scene in the film encapsulates it, as Elizabeth transforms herself with chalk.
1526;white makeup, a bright red wig, and a spectacular out.
1527;faced icon gives the film a solid emotional arc that helps prevent it from becoming a simple series of confrontations and thwarted conspiracies, almost .
1528;Yet perhaps even more than Blanchett it's a magnificent Geoffrey Rush who often dominates the film from the sidelines as the Queen's loyal and utterly unscrupulous spymaster Sir Francis Walsingham, a man who can seem all things to all men and women but is loyal only to her.
1529;Even when he's simply observing from afar he's a powerful presence in all the right ways, emanating a callous intelligence that is truly frightening.
1530;I had to watch this movie for a history class and I must say that I really enjoyed it.
1531;All though some of the facts were not alltogether true the movie was very entertaining.
1532;if you like history about England you will love this
1533;This film is beautifully produced, and Blanchett's performance.
1534;as well as those of other major cast members.
1535;especially after having seen the brilliant Glenda Jackson mini.
1536;She was marvelous in this and no one could have played the queen better.
1537;The movie itself is beautifully shot, the screenplay rich and informative, while being highly entertaining.
1538;Its dramatic and romantic and nail biting all at once.
1539;"I love watching period films/costume dramas
1540;It may be a bit confusing at first watch, but after a couple more viewings, you really appreciate just how wonderful this film is.
1541;If you love historical movies, then this movie is one to see.
1542;Secondly, """"Elizabeth"""" which begins with Elizabeth as a young girl whom loves to dance with her friend Robert."""
1543;He tells her because the powers.
1544;View the movie to see how this queen reigns supreme with her God, her love for her people and England.
1545;I love the cinematography, the casting and the costumes.
1546;She did enjoy (and demand) the adoring courtly manners shown her by the young men in her court.
1547;The scene where the Duke at first meeting Elizabeth whispers that he'd like to see her quinny is hilarious.
1548;The real plot is interesting enough and I would have liked to see these wonderful actors act it out.
1549;I really liked this movie.
1550;In fact, the real history makes for an even more enjoyable story than the one portrayed in the movie.
1551;In itself it was filled with good acting and was an interesting story (even if REALLY boring and diminished when compared to history).
1552;I loved Cate's performance regardless, and that of everyone else.
1553;If you are looking for a good movie at any rate, this is a must see.
1554;A more historical account of Elizabeth's life that is truly excellent (though a bit low.
1555;budget)would be Elizabeth R, with the amazing Glenda Jackson.
1556;intrigue of the Court very intense.
1557;Cate Blanchett is perfect as Queen Elizabeth.
1558;I do love the actors and the production, which is worth watching even tho the story isn't very accurate.
1559;The acting was wonderful, the story was intriguing, the costumes were cool, and I liked the cinematography.
1560;See more at vyctorynotes dot blogspot dot com.
1561;Through it all, the movie demonstrates her continuous power and how she deals with each hardship.
1562;first of all, this movie is one of the most beautiful I've seen, but in a dark form.
1563;Second of all, the movie wonderfully captures what the challanges of being a ruler were back then.
1564;It truly is a wonderful display of the British Empire as a whole.
1565;the acting in this movie was also spectacular.
1566;Cate Blanchett shines in this powerhouse film.
1567;She triumphantly takes in and conveys every emotion and feeling with such grace that it amazes you.
1568;bottom Line: Everyone should see this movie for its incredible acting, history, depth, cinematography, beauty, music and the costumes that helped make this film perfect.
1569;(I give it an A+ and five out of five stars.
1570;It is number 6 on my top ten favorite movies list.)
1571;"I love Queen Elizabeth and I remembering seeing this in the theatre and thinking to myself, ""who is this incredible actress with this intense presence?"""
1572;You feel the tug and pull within her character and you feel for her predicament.
1573;This was a tour de force performance.
1574;It's a brilliant start for this amazing actress.
1575;It is outrageous that Gwenyth Paltrow won the Best Actress Oscar that year.
1576;Her acting and perfect English accent and speeches strove to be among the A. lists i. e. Meryl Streep etc. from the beginning when Elizabeth is wrongly accused to be sentenced, the times during her political standing against all rivalries and their hidden agendas, to the end she rises to her feet as the ultimate Virgin Queen, Blanchett is fully in control of her powerful acting and plays her parts stately.
1577;And when it comes to her affair with Sir Robert Dudley (Joseph Fiennes), Blanchett's soft feminine side shines through radiantly.
1578;Cate Blanchett is an amazing actress and portrays the Queen beautifully.
1579;The costumes are absolutely amazing.
1580;Blanchett is now in my mind's eye as the beautiful young Elizabeth.
1581;with the voice to match!
1582;The musical score and supporting cast make this film one of the very special historical movies to have.
1583;religious intrigue through which she had to navigate her way in order to transform England from a weak bankrupt country into a great power .
1584;cate Blanchet gives a convincing performance .
1585;The costumes and music are impressive .
1586;An outstanding, beautifully produced movie with an exceptional cast.
1587;based dramas will certainly find this movie quite captivating.
1588;As long as the story line is sensible and the acting is good.
1589;the acting is pretty good.
1590;If you love period films, this is for you!
1591;I've seen my share of period films, and nothing comes even CLOSE to this film costume.
1592;If you are a connoisseur of fine fabric/clothing, it's reason enough for you to see this film.
1593;from warm sweet girl to ice queen.
1594;i really enjoyed everything about this movie, but Cate Blanchette absolutely deserves to be crowned for her excellent performance.
1595;she seamlessly carries you thru her evolution with heart and grace.
1596;I love historical dramas and I love British films (by content or production), so I was really looking forward to finally seeing it.
1597;I must say that Cate Blancett has done a brilliant job in portraying such a difficult historical figure, but then again, she always does a good job.
1598;I loved Geoffrey Rush in his role.
1599;And the rest of the cast stands up to the challenge of their roles as well.
1600;All of these actors together with the scene design and cinematography really help bring this period piece to life.
1601;And with a cast of so many characters it's easy to forget who's being talked about and where their allegiences lie.
1602;Overall, it's definitely worth the two hours to check out a great story, and a great film.
