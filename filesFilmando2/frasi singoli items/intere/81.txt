I:9678;1;He had traveled first class and learned from an angered policeman that his color didn't allow him to ride first class.
I:9678;2;Gandhi took some time out from the spot light to get to learn the country of India and by doing so he was able to see it with a clear view.
I:9678;3;Gandhi wanted the approach to a free India to be positive and non.
I:9678;4;This movie teaches one the value of understanding that every one should be treat with respect no matter their skin color or religious beleif.
I:9678;5;This movie is a wonderful representation of Gandhi's life and the amazing life he led.
I:9678;6;He teaches that changing the world can be simply profound.
I:9678;7;This was an extremely inspirational movie!
I:9678;8;It was amazing to see how much strength and courage in one person could cause so much change for so many people.
I:9678;9;after his success there he returns to India where he continues his non.
I:9678;10;This is a wonderful movie.
I:9678;11;It could be a great learning tool and inspiration to all.
I:9678;12;This is a great film which gives us a good portrayal of Gandhi's life and achievements.
I:9678;13;the film portrays Gandhi as an honest, hard working and kind individual who always tried to do the right thing, even when facing overwhelming resistance.
I:9678;14;if you like the film I would suggest reading his autobiography The Story of My Experiments with Truth, which will give you an insight into his mind.
I:9678;15;Gandhi is such a film.
I:9678;16;That being said, Ben Kingsley is astounding as the Mahatma, delivering more than just an impersonation, but rather a truly felt performance.
I:9678;17;In the same year, a movie was released that was a breath of fresh air to cinema.
I:9678;18;Blade Runner was thrilling, visionary, a stunning spectacle, but also a very clever story about immortality, perception, reality, and the future.
I:9678;19;It dared a lot, and it created an utterly compelling future L. a., which was pretty much another character in the movie.
I:9678;20;Blade Runner was exciting, this movie was an exercise in playing it safe, and it won, of course, because the Academy loves biopics.
I:9678;21;A great movie and Ben Kingsley gives a great performance.
I:9678;22;Seeing India in all its beauty and squalor is something I won't forget, and I can't help wondering what Gandhi would think of the world he helped to create.
I:9678;23;Was Gandhi a great person?
I:9678;24;"The answer will always be ""yes""."
I:9678;25;There is no doubt in my mind that Attenborough created a beautiful, picturesque view of India controlled by British rule and chose a subject very close to his heart.
I:9678;26;Was he the best actor for the role?
I:9678;27;"I believe that he did a great job of ""acting"" like Gandhi, but I do not think he could be labeled as ""the best""."
I:9678;28;driven epic before my eyes.
I:9678;29;I saw beautiful pictures, but not enough about the beauty of this man.
I:9678;30;attenborough has the tendency to build really strong biography epics.
I:9678;31;I enjoyed watching Chaplin, though I didn't think it was a powerful enough story on Chaplin himself, it was nonetheless enjoyable.
I:9678;32;I enjoyed watching Gandhi, but I just felt that Attenborough fast.
I:9678;33;forwarded through some of the most crucial elements to this monumental man's life.
I:9678;34;One of the scenes that I was most looking forward to was Gandhi's powerful pilgrimage to the Indian Ocean.
I:9678;35;He was focused on the bigger picture, thus forgetting the power of the smaller stories.
I:9678;36;A great biography will attempt to do both.
I:9678;37;It will show the power of this figure on a grand scale, but then zoom in closer to the actual person so that we can see the inner struggles they were facing on a daily basis.
I:9678;38;A film that correctly gives us this true mix is Nixon.
I:9678;39;Stone's biography picture does a great job in giving us the man and the nation that didn't stand behind him.
I:9678;40;overall, I thought this was an enjoyable film to watch, but a horrid portrayal of this man's life.
I:9678;41;There were even a couple of scenes where Attenborough had such great landscape happening that it covered up the words of Gandhi .
I:9678;42;is that how you build power towards this great man?
I:9678;43;There should have more connection between these active players and Gandhi.
I:9678;44;True story of a great man.
I:9678;45;A very well directed movie.
I:9678;46;I really enjoyed this movie.
I:9678;47;I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in Civil Rights.
I:9678;48;If you've never seen this movie, now is certainly the time.
I:9678;49;A wonderful and moving film.
I:9678;50;Gandhi is one of those movies where everything seems to be perfect.
I:9678;51;The main character, Mohandas K. Gandhi is one of the most important historical figures, and he deserved a movie that made justice to his legend and greatness.
I:9678;52;In 1982, Richard Attenborough made a beautiful film that without a doubt, made that thousands of people admire Mohandas K. Gandhi.
I:9678;53;ben Kingsley's performance is one of the most impressive that I have ever seen, thanks to a low.
I:9678;54;key and spiritual portrait of Gandhi, Ben Kingsley is now known as an excellent actor.
I:9678;55;There are few main characters, most of them are supporting characters, but the performances are equally impressive.
I:9678;56;the cinematography is flawless: the photography, the costumes, the production design and the direction are outstanding.
I:9678;57;"For those that haven't seen ""Gandhi"", this movie did for Mohandas K. Gandhi the same thing that ""Schindler's List"" did for Oskar Schindler in 1993, thanks to these movies a lot of people were interested in these historical men."
I:9678;58;"definitely ""Gandhi"" is one of the best films ever made, it's a work of art, the homage that Mohandas K. Gandhi deserved."
I:9678;59;Gandhi did so much and this movie really was wonderful to share what he did with the world!
I:9678;60;The movie did and exceptional job putting everything he did into the big screen.
I:9678;61;That was amazing and I could see then that they were not scared of anything and would do anything to keep fighting for their equal rights.
I:9678;62;But really watch and you will learn of this magnificant world leader, GANDHI!
I:9678;63;It arrived quickly in perfect condition!
I:9678;64;This film is a story about a father of modern India and his fight for freedom.
I:9678;65;gandhi continues to provoke the British authorities using nonviolent civil disobedience, is in and out of prison several times, and goes on periodic hunger strikes to influence events.
I:9678;66;Gandhi comes to be revered by the Indian people, and he becomes widely known as Mahatma, meaning great.
I:9678;67;Maybe not something I'd watch more than once, but I am still happy to have seen it the one time.
I:9678;68;It really grabs your attention and leads you to wonder how this could happen to such a peaceful man.
I:9678;69;He was determined to see peace and if that meant starving himself to death, then that is what he was willing to do.
I:9678;70;Gandhi was an amazing person, with a strong will to make a difference in his lifetime.
I:9678;71;Great job in all departments and very well captured life of the Mahatma.
I:9678;72;Sir Ben did a great job and well deserved recognition.
I:9678;73;Also gives insight into what inspired MLK.
I:9678;74;Second best movie ever made.
I:9678;75;love the construction of the story.
I:9678;76;On the surface it seems to be a purely political film about relations between the British and the Indian subcontinent.
I:9678;77;This reveals the dynamic country/subcontinent that is India and which Gandhi tried to reconcile the religious groups into one country.
I:9678;78;He greatly respects Gandhis views even though he does not always agree with Gandhi.
I:9678;79;One of the more touching scenes in the film occurs when a Hindu man who seems crazy comes up to Gandhi who is weak from hunger.
I:9678;80;He loves us all equally and the same, we can all be forgiven by him and we are all equally accountable for our actions.
I:9678;81;This is a great story of a great soul.
I:9678;82;This movie tries to get to the heart of the man, and I believe it succeeds as well as any film can.
I:9678;83;Sir Ben Kingsley was really amazing by his portrayal of Gandhi.
I:9678;84;Definitely worth an evening or two to appreciate his contribution on India's independence.
I:9678;85;It has the awards to prove it.
I:9678;86;Show this movie to a young person and take time to talk with them about it.
I:9678;87;My daughter and I got on the web and researched Gandhi's life.
I:9678;88;this is certainly a cut above the films we normally watch.
I:9678;89;Gandhi is one of my favorite movies.
I:9678;90;This movie is definitely worth seeing!
I:9678;91;From there, Gandhi begins his journey of showing the world that we are all children of God, not only certain people.
I:9678;92;You see his transformation from a young brilliant lawyer to a man of few possessions and many followers.
I:9678;93;It was truly amazing to see and hear what Gandhi had to say to people in high government positions and those who were in severe poverty.
I:9678;94;His passion for all men, women and children and for non violence is something that I will remember for a lifetime.
I:9678;95;"One of his quotes, ""I am a Muslim and a Hindu and a Christian and a Jew and so are all of you"" ([.])"
I:9678;96;is a powerful statement and shows how passionate he was about all people.
I:9678;97;Gandhi is a Hindu, but has a love and understanding of all religions.
I:9678;98;It is an astounding look at the human being we all have inside of us and the fact that one person can, and does, make a difference.
I:9678;99;This movie had terrific acting and a wonderful plot.
I:9678;100;I am so happy I watched this movie.
I:9678;101;Ben Kingsley does a wonderful job portraying Gandhi.
I:9678;102;I really enjoyed the way Richard Attenborough has done this film.
I:9678;103;Richard starts his film with a little foreshadowing, then moves on to the start of Gandhi's great work.
I:9678;104;He is thrown from the train for refusing to ride in 3rd class, because he is from India (colored man).
I:9678;105;This sparks something in Gandhi.
I:9678;106;Gandhi and the Indian Congress of South Africa begin with one small goal to become equals in the British Empire.
I:9678;107;Gandhi begins to show that he can also humble himself and become equal with the other Indians in South Africa.
I:9678;108;When he returns to India, he is greeted with praise for what he has done while in South Africa.
I:9678;109;With every fast, and every demonstration, Attenborough does a wonderful job of letting you see into Gandhi's mind.
I:9678;110;This movie gives you a good look at how religion can affect so much.
I:9678;111;Gandhi's work was portrayed in a good, but unbiased light.
I:9678;112;Even today, India and Pakistan struggle, but the world knows Gandhi.
I:9678;113;I really love this movie .
I:9678;114;for its cinematic effects, its terrific acting, even the editing which has sometimes been called too slow.
I:9678;115;I love it that India is recognizable in the movie, even seen through an Anglicized lens.
I:9678;116;And I'm also partial to the portrait of the Mahatma that Attenborough painted (and Ben Kingsley brought so inimitably to life).
I:9678;117;One can hardly escape being deeply moved by the story.
I:9678;118;In short, it's a masterpiece.
I:9678;119;but the reviewers who claim this movie is a history lesson would maybe do well to read a little Indian history: this movie, beloved as it is, is a cartoon.
I:9678;120;discipline and virtue that Gandhi's politics were built on.
I:9678;121;Any sane person can hardly escape feeling at the end that Gandhi was a saint, and while this is a really pleasant feeling to nurture I'm not sure it's entirely historically fair.
I:9678;122;I give it 5 stars.
I:9678;123;Talk about a film that has not aged well in my mind, `Gandhi' remains one of those Oscar sweeping epic biopics that I just don't get the love for.
I:9678;124;Maybe it was trying to mirror the beliefs and guidelines presented by the film's moral compass, but for me the film dropped my interest.
I:9678;125;The film needed a beating heart, something to draw us in, and instead it felt too intent on delivering a history lesson than actually creating a riveting character piece.
I:9678;126;The acting is decent, but Kingsley's portrayal of Mahatma Gandhi is rather one.
I:9678;127;tailor made for Oscar's eye, but no real dynamic present to make the film memorable.
I:9678;128;"`Gandhi' carries a powerful message
I:9678;129;I like a statement that one fellow reviewer made, so I'm going to borrow it here.
I:9678;130;The film is very ambitious, by that ambition is misplaced in a director who doesn't take the needed time to flesh it out completely.
I:9678;131;dimensional portrait of a man I `wish' I knew more intimately.
I:9678;132;Gandhi was such a wonderful film that portrayed a man who only wanted peace for all nations.
I:9678;133;He is constantly imprisoned because of his beliefs and because the Southern Africans felt threatened by his cause.
I:9678;134;He always remained faithful to his religion and never backed away from what he believed in.
I:9678;135;He believed that all religions are true and individually we should become better acquainted with our own beliefs that we have faith in.
I:9678;136;The acting is incredible, the story monumental, and the dialogue and imagery unforgettable.
I:9678;137;It's so comforting to know there are still values in mankind.
I:9678;138;It is so inspirational to know that there have been people who have won some of the hardest wars in peace and respect for human nature.
I:9678;139;I have rarely been touched by history as much as I have been by looking closer at Gandhi's life.
I:9678;140;This movie will not only give you a deep sense of history but also leave you with a deep sense of humanity and humility.
I:9678;141;A trully beautifully crafted movie that pays respect to a trully great man.
I:9678;142;"This is not just a movie
I:9678;143;"I recently completed reading the novel ""Gandhi"" and this movie unquestionably brought it to life."
I:9678;144;"The lessons of this ""GREAT MAN,"" certainly etched in my mind, heart and soul the values of humility in this modern day world."
I:9678;145;This was a great movie about a great man.
I:9678;146;Unbelievable courage, faith and love of his fellow humans!
I:9678;147;A challenge to Be the change you want to see in the world .
I:9678;148;The story of Gandhi is both uplifting and depressing.
I:9678;149;Great movie, broke it into two showings.
I:9678;150;This has to be one of my favorite movies of all time.
I:9678;151;Ben Kingsley was the perfect fit to play the legendary Gandhi in this brilliantly produced epic showing the struggle for freedom from imperialism and the resultant emergence of an independent India and Pakistan.
I:9678;152;This is history in its finest!
I:9678;153;Excellent film with great performance, as always, by Kingsley.
I:9678;154;A beautiful tribute almost, to a man who lived according to his beliefs, fought for freedom (non.
I:9678;155;On screen his life becomes an epic that really paints him in a human way.
I:9678;156;And the details surrounding certain events are done well.
I:9678;157;The film works on many levels, and it really inspires (which great bio.
I:9678;158;A great movie that started a revolution in India.
I:9678;159;purification, and social protest, and arrested various times as a form of repression.
I:9678;160;Very educational for the kids.
I:9678;161;"The courage and selflessness in this film seem to be increasingly meaningful as the years go by
I:9678;162;One of my favorite actors, Ben Kingsley does an amazing job of portraying one of the most influential people in history.
I:9678;163;Informs viewer about life of an important historical person and events that changed mankind for the better.
I:9678;164;star has done an interesting, yet only minimal job.
I:9678;165;Of historical interest is a collection of period newsreels including one rare recording of the real Gandhi.
I:9678;166;This is truly one of the greatest movies of all time and should be required in all high schools across america, and perhaps even around the world!
I:9678;167;If you didn't like it you simply need to grow up a little more and appreciate how sincerely tremendous Ghandi is and how well this movie portrays well his life.
I:9678;168;The next scene, his funeral, is one of the greatest scenes in cinematic history.
I:9678;169;"chronicling the rich, unforgettable life of a one Mohandas K. ""Mahatma"" Gandhi ."
I:9678;170;played to shocking perfection by the wonderful Sir Ben Kingsley .
I:9678;171;this is a film that I can say really, deeply affected me with its power, its scale, and of course, its timeless message of love and non.
I:9678;172;I cannot fully express how much this great man's way of thinking .
I:9678;173;his words, his struggles, his accomplishments .
I:9678;174;He was the perfect for the role.
I:9678;175;He resembled the real Gandhi.
I:9678;176;He was young enough to portray Gandhi as a young man.
I:9678;177;He is a British actor that nailed the British influenced Indian accent.
I:9678;178;He is a wonderful actor that was patient and humble with such an important part.
I:9678;179;"And he was a relatively unknown actor at the time, so the ""big."
I:9678;180;It will stand the test of time and inform multiple generations.
I:9678;181;honestly, I also enjoyed the performance of all the actors, and they made me appreciate the actions of everyone who surrounded Gandhi.
I:9678;182;i recognize that the movie may not be biographically complete, but I learned enough about his life to respect it in its entirety.
I:9678;183;Never before have I seen such a powerful work of art.
I:9678;184;It made me forget the finesse of the technological masterpiece, an advanced Macintosh computer running MacOsX, which delivered the breath.
I:9678;185;taking scenes in vibrant colors with soul.
I:9678;186;Every scene and every peice of sound hits the nail right on its head with a powerful strike of the hammer.
I:9678;187;I must appreciate the dedication of the team and their quest for perfection.
I:9678;188;Years of their work has produced this masterpiece which mankind can cherish for the eons to come.
I:9678;189;This certainly is one of the best creations of collective human intellect of superlative degree.
I:9678;190;The story of the life of a great soul in a soul.
I:9678;191;Ghandi was a great figure, like Martin Luther King, he had a vision, and he changed the world with his ideas of non.
I:9678;192;Ben Kingsley played the role with sensitivity and brilliance.
I:9678;193;The movie deserved every Oscar it won.
I:9678;194;This movie was the realization of a lifetime dream for Sir Richard Attenborough, who finally succeeded in bringing this incredible spectacular to theatrical release in 1982.
I:9678;195;Ben Kingsley is simply magnificent as the diminutive, principled, and indefatiguable lawyer, humanitarian, and citizen of the world with an uncannily prescient feel for what was possible for a determined and energetic person as well as how to achieve his lofty otherworldly goals right here on earth.
I:9678;196;based on his appraoch here, Attenborough seems to have learned much from such masterful British film.
I:9678;197;makers as David Lean, for the use of scenery, topography, and natural surrounding of the characters as they wind through the more than 40 years of story line is breath.
I:9678;198;there is, of course, an immensely talented cast, including Martin Sheen as an American newspaper correspondent who becomes intrigued by Gandhi's profound and surprisingly effective non.
I:9678;199;This is a wonderful motion picture experience for anyone willing to sit through the more than three hour extravaganza, one that guarantees Attenborough's prominent place in film history, and one that leaves this reviewer smacking his lips in anticipation of whatever other wonderful effort such as this may someday appear based on Attenborough's talents, visions, and moral sensibilities.
I:9678;200;it's an incredibly deft and sensitive adaptation.
I:9678;201;It had power back then and has more now.
I:9678;202;Worthy film of an astounding life.
I:9678;203;Role he was born to play holds true.
I:9678;204;This movie is a true account of the social struggles that the people of Asia endured.
I:9678;205;The man that lead the social movement Gandhi and his personal sacrifices for the good of all.
I:9678;206;I highly recommend this movie to everyone.
I:9678;207;I was extremely moved by the film, and it triggered a facination with South Asia that lasts to this day .
I:9678;208;So for me, personally, this movie is of tremendous influence.
I:9678;209;"white actors
I:9678;210;Well, that's the way of the world .
I:9678;211;He'll be forever known for this role.
I:9678;212;that aside, this is an excellent, amazing film.
I:9678;213;Of course, it's still highly relevant, perhaps even more so in our post.911 world of fear.
I:9678;214;the movie ends with a feeling of real hope and inspiration.
I:9678;215;This is a movie everyone who can should see.
I:9678;216;step,film account of Gandhi's transformation from a dapper young lawyer to religious figure to international icon representing love, forgiveness, acceptance, sacrifice and spiritual leadership.
I:9678;217;It is interesting throughout, deeply moving at many points and occasionally spiced with humor.
I:9678;218;What can be done is to be faithful in spirit to the court record and try to find one's way to the heart of the man.
I:9678;219;What I enjoyed about the India part of the movie was that while he was learning about India, we get to travel with him and learn about India.
I:9678;220;remember that this film was designed for entertainment so sit back and let's be entertained.
I:9678;221;It was well done and Ben Kingsley did a great job playing Gandhi.
I:9678;222;As Gandhi's life unfolds before us, we see the single.
I:9678;223;He led a purposeful life that was devoted to simple truths.
I:9678;224;What are my truths?This movie also demonstrates the timelessness of the human condition: power and wealth are held by a very few and varying degrees of poverty and inequity are distributed to the many .
I:9678;225;I had not seen this movie since it first came out and it is still a superb movie.
I:9678;226;I would recommend this movie to anyone.
I:9678;227;awakened a very important part of world history for me.
I:9678;228;This man changed the hearts and minds of a nation.
I:9678;229;He has changed the world.
I:9678;230;He was a brilliant, yet simple man.
I:9678;231;who CHOSE to be humble and honest.
I:9678;232;He is a truly inspiring figure in history.
I:9678;233;Gandhi is one of the finest films ever made.
I:9678;234;Ben Kingsley's performance is simply superb and well deserving of his Oscar.
I:9678;235;The film arrive in good time and was in good condition.
I:9678;236;This was a good film about a good story.
I:9678;237;I love Gandhi and I have watched this film over and over.
I:9678;238;I first saw this movie many years ago in theaters, and a few years after that when I bought it for my library.
I:9678;239;I'm sure everyone knows the story of Gandhi, so I won't go into that.
I:9678;240;Each time I see it, I enjoy it more than the last time, perhaps because I am older and can understand his significance better now.
I:9678;241;It will make an impression on your life.
I:9678;242;This is a magnificent film well worth owning your own copy, dealing with perhaps the greatest person of the 20th century and many other centuries as well.
I:9678;243;One of the most remarkable features of Gandhi's character was his resilient serenity and fidelity to his purposes in the face of tremendous odds and considerable personal suffering and failure.
I:9678;244;from what reservoir did he draw this tremendous strength?
I:9678;245;I was extremely pleased with the whole movie.
I:9678;246;Director Richard Attenborough's epic biographical film `Gandi' released in '82 is one of those rare, magnificent films that not only entertains and informs, but ultimately transforms the viewers consciousness for the better.
I:9678;247;Yes that's right, I'm talking about transformation.
I:9678;248;if you're like me you'll slowly and subtly experience a discernable shift of consciousness while watching this film.
I:9678;249;Your analytical mind will disengage as your thought processes become more symbolic and filled with images pregnant with meaning.
I:9678;250;His words and deeds will envelope you and force you to re.
I:9678;251;evaluate what it means to be human.
I:9678;252;Now it has become more than a movie, it has become a lesson in how to live.
I:9678;253;attenborough has truly gifted us with a timeless tale of a great man and his loving legacy for Mother India.
I:9678;254;Along with a storyline that must be told the film contains breathtaking cinematography and an entrancing soundtrack that will remain with you long after the closing credits.
I:9678;255;"This is a beautifully made film
I:9678;256;Rather, this film is great for what makes any film great: wonderful acting (phenomenal on Mr. Kingsley's part), skilled direction, great camera cinematography, lighting, editing, and pace.
I:9678;257;The sceenplay and story, of course, are highly contributory herein, but even were this fiction the film would still qualify as a great film.
I:9678;258;It is simply a great film however you look at it.
I:9678;259;I have read Gandhi's autobiography and I give him his just due.
I:9678;260;"Gandhi is an example in one way (and maybe we'll see the likes of another Gandhi somewhere, someday), but ""His Example"" isn't one we should deceive ourselves as being applicable across the board within the chaotic world in which we live."
I:9678;261;In short, this film is a superb treatment of an important historical episode (particular to a rather specific period and set of circumstances) and, as such, well worth your time viewing.
I:9678;262;If you choose this movie to view, I recommend that you pay very close attention to the many political concepts.
I:9678;263;It is amazing how much havock civil disobedience can cause in one country.
I:9678;264;The bonus features are excellent too.
I:9678;265;Ben Kingsley plays Gandhi and it is such a great story.
I:9678;266;It deals with prejudice, political ambition, Love, Faith and hatred.
I:9678;267;It is a true story, even though some area's of the story may be condensed for film A really great film.
I:9678;268;This is a movie for everyone, it was very informative and inspiring.
I:9678;269;I will recommend to my friends and family.
I:9678;270;Charles Nelson Reilly, the beloved star of Match Game.
I:9678;271;oh, they made a good second choice.
I:9678;272;The movie is still wonderful as it is.
I:9678;273;Still, I can't help but wonder how much more wonderful it might have been if Charles Nelson Reilly had starred in it.
I:9678;274;it's still a 4 star movie.
I:9678;275;The high definition version is well worth it.
I:9678;276;they still work, and you can view all the stuff, but you have to guess at what each menu option will do.
I:9678;277;The film was made with jaw dropping skill.
I:9678;278;I can see why it got an Oscar as the best movie of the year.
I:9678;279;Acting is superb, the production is stunning, the story compelling, Wow.
I:9678;280;This film stands head and shoulders above any of the films that are being produced nowadays.
I:9678;281;a great example of humility.
I:9678;282;It shows how knowledge can free the mind.
I:9678;283;The movie Gandhi follows the life story of one of the most influential non.
I:9678;284;He is astonished by such treatment that is received to men who are laborers to men who are educated and wealthy.
I:9678;285;He wants equal treatment and rights.
I:9678;286;He wishes to do away with the caste system.
I:9678;287;One of Gandhi's most memorable non violent marches is when he walks to the sea and makes salt.
I:9678;288;Ben Kingsley was an excellent choice to portray one of history's most celebrated martyrs.
I:9678;289;"Viewing this film is like watching history come alive
I:9678;290;Watch it, and see why it was the Motion Picture Academy's choice for Best Picture.
I:9678;291;He eventually got the British government to make changes due to his non.
I:9678;292;This great movie showed who Gandhi was over a 54 year period and how he shaped the future of India and showed the world the birth of the civil rights movement.
I:9678;293;He found inspiration from reading the Koran even though he was born and raised as a Hindu.
I:9678;294;This is a must see movie that will show you how one person can and did make a difference for nearly one billion people.
I:9678;295;Reviewer: catpole from CanadaAs said before, this may be the finest film ever made.
I:9678;296;which may be the best ever made .
I:9678;297;This smacks of the discrimination Gandhi dedicated his life to.
I:9678;298;Having realized that Indians are being discriminated upon due to their status and race, he becomes inspired and decides to take action.
I:9678;299;During his return to India, Gandhi is well received and praised by the people.
I:9678;300;This promotes great disappointment in Gandhi's heart to a point that leads him to fast until the end of the riot.
I:9678;301;With such great news, also comes conflict that rises due to the division of the country.
I:9678;302;This has a lot to do with World Religions in the sense that Gandhi was a very respected and inspirational man.
I:9678;303;He claimed that truth and love would always win against tyrants.
I:9678;304;Gandhi is an excellent film that any person will enjoy.
I:9678;305;This film will really make you think about life and war.
I:9678;306;You will not ever regret purchasing this great film.
I:9678;307;Very powerful, moving, and inspirational to any person with a soul.
I:9678;308;I highly recommend this wonderful film to everybody.
I:9678;309;Just a fantastic film with a fantastic story about a unique man who stood on the world stage and tried to make the human race just a little better.
I:9678;310;"Excellent movie
I:9678;311;the dialogues are very well written, thoughtful and inspiring.
I:9678;312;Gandhi agrees to accept the challenge set forth and sets to form what starts out as a non.
I:9678;313;Violence and fighting erupt in lasting brawls.
I:9678;314;Even though it eventually stops, the nation shows to be split by religion in such a vast range.
I:9678;315;through this story line its very interesting how even today within our own world religions we are in similarity still per say those of the descent of Pakistan and that area, are still fighting among themselves due to religion.
I:9678;316;It's something many still strive for today, spiritual independence.
I:9678;317;That's when I first saw it and was swept away by it then.
I:9678;318;When Ben Kingsley won the Oscar for his breakout performance in which he all but channeled Mahatma Gandhi, I was ecstatic.
I:9678;319;He's been one of my favorite actors ever since, never ceasing to disappoint (i. e., Schindler's List).
I:9678;320;I love the extras on it with Dir.
I:9678;321;I loved seeing a very young Daniel Day.
I:9678;322;lewis's performance (a bit part) in this film.
I:9678;323;If you love Ben Kingsley as I do, you must have this edition of Gandhi.
I:9678;324;Gandhi is an excellent portrayal of one of the world's greatest leaders.
I:9678;325;Watching it led to some deep discussions in our family.
I:9678;326;This is a well done movie: acting, directing, script.
I:9678;327;More importantly it shows and describes a man and a method that most non.
I:9678;328;It is engaging and intellectually stimulating.
I:9678;329;The characters in the movie are outstanding.
I:9678;330;god is love, not violence, and prohibits violence while encouraging Love andforgiveness and mercy and repentence in every way.
I:9678;331;god is love and wants love.
I:9678;332;so, you might well ask how did I come to see this film again once again afterall of these years.
I:9678;333;when I sometimes feel depressed about the world or life, I will watch this movie, and it always manages to make me feel better.
I:9678;334;Gandhi's life was so powerful, and his motives were so pure and unblemished by personal greed or gain, that it fills my whole being with a deep warmth and true happiness to be reminded that sometimes we humans are capable of such greatness.
I:9678;335;perhaps there are better movies to watch for entertainment, but I would suggest that no movie beats this one for portraying the best we can aspire to, and that is a very good thing.
I:9678;336;"This is great movie about legend ""Mahatma Gandhi"", who practiced first time in the history of world ""Non."
I:9678;337;"violenceAlbert Einstein said of Gandhi""Mahatma Gandhi's life achievement stands unique in political history."
I:9678;338;He has invented a completely new and humane means for the liberation war of an oppressed country, and practised it with greatest energy and devotion.
I:9678;339;Because lasting will only be the work of such statesmen who wake up and strengthen the moral power of their people through their example and educational works.
I:9678;340;we may all be happy and grateful that destiny gifted us with such an enlightened contemporary, a role model for the generations to come.
I:9678;341;"He continued that ""He's somebody I find a lot of inspiration in."
I:9678;342;He inspired Dr. King with his message of nonviolence.
I:9678;343;He ended up doing so much and changed the world just by the power of his ethics
I:9678;344;Gandhi offers his courage and inner peace to us.
I:9678;345;One of the four greatest movies ever, even better in Blu.
I:9678;346;This is one of the most powerful movies I have ever seen.
I:9678;347;it is a movie I think everyone should see.
I:9678;348;Gandhi was incredible, a truly incredible person.
I:9678;349;"He proved that pacifists could win wars
I:9678;350;He wanted the British to leave as friends, which they finally did.
I:9678;351;he was so loved by the people that when fights started breaking out and the people stopped following his teachings of non.
I:9678;352;the movie tells an incredible story about him and I think you should see it.
I:9678;353;to add, the movie one won 8 Oscars, among others Ben Kinsley one an Oscar for his portrayal of Gandhi, which was incredible.
I:9678;354;the emotions which stirred within while framing this picture of Gandhi very much resembled the feelings of loving reverence and humility I feel every time I see this film.
I:9678;355;There is this sense of gentle.
I:9678;356;kindness and simultaneously, tremendous power and strength emanates from this great master.
I:9678;357;for a movie to ignite thoughts and emotions so powerful, poignant, profound and moving, it quite simply has to be a top.
I:9678;358;Gandhi, hands down, stands alone as one of the greatest films I have ever seen in all of my life.
I:9678;359;ben Kingsley is absolutely masterful in this role.
I:9678;360;Kingsley brilliantly weaves the love and humility with the great power, strength and wisdom of Gandhi's personality and real.
I:9678;361;And I have had a few express their disagreement, but Kingsley's role as Gandhi is THE best acting I have ever seen yet.
I:9678;362;Something for the world to benefit from now matter where in the world the viewer is or who the viewer is.
I:9678;363;gandhi was a proud and peaceful Hindu.
I:9678;364;Gives an interesting portrayal of Ghandi's life.
I:9678;365;I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to anyone who wants to understand what it takes to really stand up for a cause.
I:9678;366;Gandhi , starring Ben Kingsley, is a wonderful journey through the life and times of civil rights leader Mahatma Gandhi.
I:9678;367;In 1982, it earned nine Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director.
I:9678;368;The hardword spent on this project is rare for cinema.
I:9678;369;Director Richard Attenborough led the cast and crew wonderfully to complete one of the greatest films within the last thirty years.
I:9678;370;It wonderfully desplicts the life and times of this unbelievable man.
I:9678;371;It accurately desplicts Gandhi's beliefs, morals, and struggles.
I:9678;372;It also wonderfully educates audiences about the wars and the fight for equal rights.
I:9678;373;The emotional value stays at its top throughout the entire three.
I:9678;374;The beauty and the ugliness are created wonderfully by make.
I:9678;375;They amazingly make Ben Kingsey almost resemble the real.
I:9678;376;life Mahatma Gandhi, regardless of desplicted age.
I:9678;377;The characters' aging processes and the fighting aftermaths are brilliantly crafted.
I:9678;378;They amazingly maintained this through every character.
I:9678;379;ben Kinsley won an Oscar for Best Actor for his portrayal of Mahatma Gandhi.
I:9678;380;His own emotional value shows greatly throughout the film, namely loss, hunger, struggle, and victimization.
I:9678;381;His actions and speech patterns accurately desplict that of the actual ones.
I:9678;382;He amazingly maintained his character throught the ages.
I:9678;383;All other actors also perform their roles wonderfully: Martin Sheen, Candice Bergen, and others.
I:9678;384;This is sure to continue pleasing audiences as it has since its release.
I:9678;385;This is rightfully destined to be a classic in the upcoming years.
I:9678;386;The movie that had so much in how the life of one can change the lives of so many.
I:9678;387;It was one of the best movies that showed human to human interaction.
I:9678;388;The acting was very well done the settings where some of the best parts of the film the number of people that it had to take to pull some of the scenes off had to be a Hugh task.
I:9678;389;Let us look at how the plot of the film came in to being.
I:9678;390;The main creator Gandhi was a lawyer for the people, a people who had their lives controlled by the then British Empire.
I:9678;391;The one aspect that has a strong relation to the Hindu belief system is that of caste system this was a belief that all people had their duties or place in the Hindu belief system.

I:9678;395;One simple trick is unplugging the Blu.
I:9678;396;please recognize that a Blu.
I:9678;397;ray, odds go up that it's demanding the latest FIRMWARE.
I:9678;398;That worked for me, thanks to great customer service from Panasonic.
I:9678;399;In my mind, I was way behind when it came to enjoying the benefits of streaming.
I:9678;400;I simply moved my internet connection plug to the back of the Blu.
I:9678;401;A manufacturer defect means plenty more Blu.

I:9678;409;"this also can be bad, especially with great musicals such as ""West Side Story""."
I:9678;410;with Gandhi comes the single best Special Features package I can recall, a separate disc with recent interviews and most of its content in High Definition.
I:9678;411;rarely will you encounter a Blu.
I:9678;412;This is one of the great movies made in the last fifty years.
I:9678;413;It is a good introduction to the topic of Indian Independence from Britian.
I:9678;414;I had already seen the movie in the past, but it was well worth getting to see again.
I:9678;415;Sometimes you just cant find the classic movies such as this one, and for the price, it was worth purchasing.
I:9678;416;Great story of a great man.
I:9678;417;I lived in India for two years in the early 60's and can confirm the atmospheric authenticity of this film.
I:9678;418;could any film ever faithfully convey the nuances of that extra.
I:9678;419;ordinary man and those phenomenal times,and with sensitivity?
I:9678;420;Probably not, but with the included rare films of Gandhi.
I:9678;421;ji himself and Ben Kingsley's comments, this film represents a courageous effort!
I:9678;422;this was an exceptional film and one that i hope many people watch, and maybe take to heart what this man did and the way he acted.
I:9678;423;he was a true christian, muslim, jew, and hindu.
I:9678;424;the film does a wonderful job in presenting his life.
I:9678;425;and the extras are nice.
I:9678;426;The most triumphant moment in modern Indian history is encapsulated by the commentary of American journalist Vince Walker(Martin Sheen).
I:9678;427;so aptly and unforgettably portrayed by Oscar winner Ben Kingsley with a subtle spark of divine fire.
I:9678;428;"He attracts the support of certain Westerners such as the amiable Reverend Charlie Andrews (Ian Charleson, who played athletic clegyman Eric Liddell in the previous year's Oscar Winner for Best Picture, ""Chariots of Fire""), and Dr. Herman Kallenbach (Gunter."
I:9678;429;watch for a cameo of future Oscar winner Daniel Day.
I:9678;430;during another stint in jail, Gandhi tells Reverend Andrews that the best thing he could do to help is to accept assignment in Fiji, so that Indians will have the largest role in the fight for their own independence.
I:9678;431;But Andrews petitions British authorties at the highest level to help the effort as a final act of generosity.
I:9678;432;there is a lovely moment when he reunites with Walker and he and Kasturba reenact their wedding ceremony.
I:9678;433;white captures the Mahatma on film and through his final days.
I:9678;434;It is amusing to see John Gielgud's Lord Irwin, surrounded by the trappings of wealth, humbled by the man with a loincloth and walking staff while extending the invitation to attend the conference.
I:9678;435;this film is a fitting tribute to the man who defeated History's mightiest Empire not with lethal weaponry, but by the might of a wanderer's staff.
I:9678;436;at the close of my review, written to honor both 60 years of Indian independence, and the 25th anniversary of this film's release, I take note of the fact that the Biblical connotations of this man's life are indeed admirable!
I:9678;437;"This movie was vibrant
I:9678;438;Gandhi is one of the best movies ever made.
I:9678;439;This movie is the winner of 8 well.
I:9678;440;deserved Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Actor (Kingsley), and Best Director (Richard Attenborough).
I:9678;441;This movie is a must see.
I:9678;442;Nicely covers the highlights of Gandhi's life and times.
I:9678;443;"One of the great movies
I:9678;444;Ben Kingsley was amazing as were the supporting actors that played Nehru, Jinnah.
I:9678;445;Ben Kingsley transported you to India and the life of One of modern times most revered Heros with an Ascended Spirit and Higher Purpose.
I:9678;446;The acting in this movie is perfect and the messege and life of Gahndi comes through strong and clear in this brilliant piece of cinema magic.
I:9678;447;Every man, woman and child should see this movie.
I:9678;448;This movie was a great tale of a great man.
I:9678;449;Ben Kingsley did a wonderful job displaying the warmth, kindness of this great man!
I:9678;450;Just an amazing film with great acting, One of the all time great films.
I:9678;451;I found the compassion, beauty, and capture of history most compelling and never a dull moment for the duration.
I:9678;452;film raises many questions concerning imperial vs home rule pros and cons, how to gauge a country's ability to govern, how to lead with dignity and respect, the level of committment required to dedicate one's life to freedom, and most of all .
I:9678;453;justification for the love and admiration of wife, family, friends and foreigners alike with humility and sainthood.
I:9678;454;takeaway line of ALWAYS is the true inspirational gem.
I:9678;455;high recommend for Attenborough and Kingsley fans.
I:9678;456;We will keep it in our collection to be watched many times.
I:9678;457;It made a big impact on him, his world and his friends.
I:9678;458;GANDHI is nothing short of a beautiful work of cinematic art.
I:9678;459;Director Lord Richard Attenborough beautifully recounts the life of the late, great Mahatma Ghandi.
I:9678;460;ben Kingsley beautifully portrays the title character and won a well.
I:9678;461;The cinematography is gorgeous, the supporting cast works great together as an ensemble, and the production truly honors Gandhi and his message.
I:9678;462;This film is one of the most important historically.
I:9678;463;GANDHI film is an excellent example of one man's achievement.
I:9678;464;I like the film more with each viewing, and I've seen it many times.
I:9678;465;This Blu transfer is top notch.
I:9678;466;It takes place in South Africa and jumps through his years there from 1893 to present day.
I:9678;467;One arrest after another happen and Gandhi starts to get international attention.
I:9678;468;He is of course motivated and sets an international campaign with obsticales along the way.
I:9678;469;And in my religons textbook Gandhi is a huge part of the history of India and the Hindu religion.
I:9678;470;This movie opened the eyes for people around the world to the life of Gandhi and the leaps he had to make to gain freedom for India and for religion.
I:9678;471;"The movie ends with a quote from Gandhi,""When I despair, I remember that all through history the ways of truth and love have always won."
I:9678;472;The screenplay of Gandhi is available as a published book.
I:9678;473;What can be done is to be faithful in spirit to the record and to try to find one's way to the heart of the man.
I:9678;474;Instead, the story flashes back 55 years to a life.
I:9678;475;After numerous arrests and unwelcome international attention, the government finally relents by recognizing some rights for Indians.
I:9678;476;Gandhi agrees, and mounts a non.
I:9678;477;nevertheless, the campaign generates great attention, and Britain faces intense public pressure.
I:9678;478;It was Richard Attenborough's lifelong dream to bring the life story of Indian political and spiritual leader Mahatma Gandhi to the screen.
I:9678;479;winning Gandhi was one of the most exhaustively thorough biopics ever made.
I:9678;480;"Faced with armed resistance from the British government, Gandhi adopts a policy of ""passive resistance,"" endeavoring to win freedom for his people without resorting to bloodshed."
I:9678;481;Gandhi gets his start as a peace leader in the late 19th and 20th century in South Africa, where he started a peaceful resistance movement against how people of color were treated.
I:9678;482;Gandhi helped with the forming of the new government until an assassin's gun ends the life of the man of peace.
I:9678;483;Gandhi is remembered as a man of love and peace, who brought the British Empire to its knees.
I:9678;484;this movie also shows the virtues and the beliefs of a simple but great man named Mahatma Gandhi.
I:9678;485;Seeking to bring himself closer to God, Gandhi taught peaceful protest.
I:9678;486;With his faith and his own personal will, Gandhi moved the world and taught that love will conquer all.
I:9678;487;It is an excellent movie of an universal leader.
I:9678;488;I used it as a reference for values that we need to share and communicate in our daily life to our friends close to us.
I:9678;489;Richard Allenborough who is known for Jurassic Park (1993) or Hamlet (1996), released another new film.
I:9678;490;"In the end he amazingly won 8 for example for the ""Best Direction"" and ""Best Actor in a Leading Role""."
I:9678;491;Ben Kingsley could also got many good critiques for his performance as Gandhi.
I:9678;492;this movie is a biography about the whole life of Gandhi and how he was able to bring India it's Independence with his philosophy of non.
I:9678;493;Personally, I think that this movie is really impressive and amazing, because it has many scenes where you can see how strong the power of will can be and what you can reach if you just believe in something.
I:9678;494;a deeply, deeply personal favorite.
I:9678;495;"alive film keeps one so rapt with attention that one comes up with descriptions like ""super."
I:9678;496;It also launched the unknown Ben Kingsley into an undeserved stardom, because look what he's done with it.
I:9678;497;Some people will watch anything with Ben Kingsley in it.
I:9678;498;attenborough not only captures Gandhi's backstory elegantly, he also presents a sprawling, inspired life in a kind of sweet shorthand.
I:9678;499;this film has much to say to us today.
I:9678;500;Today we see Pakistan in a whole new light, and we see how Gandhi may have been the cause of it all.
I:9678;501;state solution is neatly and accurately explained here, and if this cannot apply to Pakistan anymore, Israel should definitely be listening!The soundtrack is moving, very Indian, the supporting cast is marvelous and spot.
I:9678;502;In addition, this is the film that always inspired Merchant and Ivory.
I:9678;503;Not bad!Tyrants always fall, thank God great film never does!
I:9678;504;One which offers the movie GANDHI the utmost respect and one which it is rightfully due.
I:9678;505;i am pleased to recommend this to any Spanish speaker unconditionally.
I:9678;506;Gandhi is a powerful movie about the iconic leader Mahatma Gandhi who was responsible for leading a nonviolent resistance against the rule of the British.
I:9678;507;The film is a true story that takes place in both South Africa and India during part of the 20th century.
I:9678;508;He accepts and a nationwide revolution of nonviolent resistance is formed.
I:9678;509;The revolution pays off with Brittan granting India is independence after heavy political pressure and world attention.
I:9678;510;This movie is a powerful insight into the world of India.
I:9678;511;Gandhi also shows that with time and patients anything is possible and not everything has to be solved in bloodshed.
I:9678;512;Overall it was a great movie.
I:9678;513;Such movies are so much more educational than any textbook.
I:9678;514;the answers to which are interspersed throughout the movie.
I:9678;515;Well, it is time you saw it again!
I:9678;516;It's an appreciative script, wonderfully shot, and excellently portrayed.
I:9678;517;very relevant to Northern Ireland and Israel.)
I:9678;518;The film brings in Gandhi's failures, successes, idealism, and compromises.
I:9678;519;It also shows his human weaknesses.
I:9678;520;The performances are wonderfully understated, not just from Ben Kingsley, but also form the entire cast.
I:9678;521;And casting was wonderful, not just for the major parts but also the minor ones .
I:9678;522;The scenary, photogrpaphy and (of course) the subject matter are so captivating it is hard to turn away from this.
I:9678;523;In times of chaos and despair this movie stands as a testament to compassion and love.
I:9678;524;many details of Gandhi's life are perfectly portraited on this movie, and Ben Kingsley probably did his best appearance on cinema here.
I:9678;525;Moving it on is the tricky bit.
I:9678;526;attenborough has a good eye for widescreen.
I:9678;527;goldcrest producer Jake Eberts book 'My Indecision Is Final' for a fascinating behind the scenes look at the production process and distribution deal.
I:9678;528;there is also an interview with Kingsley.
I:9678;529;His praise of Guilgood is over the top.
I:9678;530;Inspirational movie about the power of an individual with conviction.
I:9678;531;What is even more impressive is the fortitude demonstrated for peace and invoking change through non.
I:9678;532;truly a model to change the world.
I:9678;533;An incredible movie about an incredible man.
I:9678;534;wide as a worshipful tribute to one of the 20th century's greatest leaders.
I:9678;535;"The film opens with a statement from the filmmakers explaining their approach to the problem of filming Gandhi's complex life story ""No man's life can be encompassed in one telling."
I:9678;536;"What can be done is to be faithful in spirit to the record of his journey, and to try to find one's way to the heart of the man."""
I:9678;537;The actor truly reflected the tender care of Gandhi.
I:9678;538;His eyes speak humility, his movements speak love.
I:9678;539;"He was a man who made humility and simple truth more powerful than Empires."""
I:9678;540;Excellent portrayal of one of the world's greatest men.
I:9678;541;From all I can personally remember, it is very historically accurate, and, in addition to the main character, the supporting actors and actresses accurately represent their screen personi.
I:9678;542;All school students of almost any age should have this film as a required viewing subject.
I:9678;543;Gandhi was certainly a remarkable man.
I:9678;544;I highly recommend that EVERYONE [Adults and Children] watch this wonderful movie.
I:9678;545;the story, the acting, the cinematography,the casting,the directing,WOW , I loved every moment of this Classic.,
I:9678;546;"As he traveled back to India from South Africa and saw all the poverty and despair around him, I felt the sadness in my heart and the ""want"" to make a change myself."
I:9678;547;Those followers loved and believed in Gandhi so much that several hundred of them walked confidently and willingly, straight into harm's way, allowing the British soldiers to beat them so badly they could hardly move, and they knew this was going to happen to them.
I:9678;548;What a statement and how true it is.
I:9678;549;He was truly a great leader and an inspiring soul, all the while bringing peace to those around him.
I:9678;550;This was a wonderful movie and I hope more people will watch it.
I:9678;551;Gandhi stirs the hearts and minds of people from around the world.
I:9678;552;I bought it for a gift .
I:9678;553;having seen it previouslyenjoyed it greatly.
I:9678;554;Would recommend it to everyone
I:9678;555;A truly great human being.
I:9678;556;Ben Kingsley's portrayal of gandhi here is nothing short of brilliant!
I:9678;557;This is a must see movie and a worthwhile addition to anyones video library.
I:9678;558;You will want to watch this movie again and again.
I:9678;559;What can I add about a man of Peace and his love for humanity.
I:9678;560;read the book first it make the movies so much better.
I:9678;561;This movie played by great actors places you in a time and place where a man takes a people to a place they had only dreamed of.
I:9678;562;Where one man so loved was able to lift a nation with peaceful means to throw off the shakles of coloniesm.
I:9678;563;up and the shots of India are so incredible, and his performance as the Indian holy man are uncanny.
I:9678;564;Richard Attenborough has put together such an astounding resemblance to the man who shaped our world that it is close to being real on its own.
I:9678;565;then there are the performances of John Gieglud as the authority figures, and the supporting cast of thousands, literally, is phenomenal.
I:9678;566;Gandhi's family, of course, don't want him to push things, but the film chronicles his early rise to that of his stature, and the scenes of his starvation diets to press home his political points are so appropriate for the time in which we live, and we can see how Martin Luther King Jr. was so taken with him.
I:9678;567;this may not be exactly the history books, but it is a nice addition to whatever history you may have or remember.
I:9678;568;For the novice who knows nothing about Gandhi, this is a nice place to start.
I:9678;569;this film is still very good today.
I:9678;570;It has beautiful cinematography and magnificent performances.
I:9678;571;Ben Kingsley, who was a complete unknown when he took this part, gives one of the greatest performances in his long career, and one of the best in film history.
I:9678;572;He embodies Gandhi so well you start to think you're actually watching the man himself.
I:9678;573;Martin Sheen, John Gielglud, and Ian Charleson lend excellent support to Kingsley, making this a rich and very satisfying film.
I:9678;574;I think this may have been the first epic film I ever saw.
I:9678;575;I don't know for sure, but if it was, it started me on a long path to loving epic films.
I:9678;576;This film is still as good as I remember it.
I:9678;577;He was creative, asking questions others did not ask and inventing answers others did not offer, with respect to problems we still face.
I:9678;578;"He sought the ""truth"" and tried to live by it."
I:9678;579;Above all, he tried to be honest with himself and with others.
I:9678;580;He was one more human being.
I:9678;581;there is hope for us.
I:9678;582;i recommend this movie for teenagers and young adults, after an introduction to the history that led to the conditions in Ganghi's India, and the ideas permeating Western politics and ethics in that era.
I:9678;583;inspiring biographical film about Gandhi .
I:9678;584;A critical masterpiece, GANDHI is an intriguing story about nonviolent activism, politics, religious tolerance and freedom.
I:9678;585;The other actors in the film are also superb, especially the actress who played his wife.
I:9678;586;respect has stayed with me long after I finished watching the film.
I:9678;587;Gandhi with Ben Kingsley was an excellent movie and my wife and I enjoyed it very much.
I:9678;588;This is a true history of India and how they how it overcome the British control of it country to become a free Nation.
I:9678;589;We highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in the History of India.
I:9678;590;I loved this film, which I knew I would as I saw it in a theater when it came out, and Gandhi is one of my all time favorite people.
I:9678;591;I learned a lot more about the filming which was entertaining and informative in its own right.
I:9678;592;the best $10.49 I ever spent.
I:9678;593;This is the simple and beautiful story of the simple and beautiful Mahatma Gandhi.
I:9678;594;The man whose humility and greatness came from a unique and historically rare realization that violence begets violence.
I:9678;595;ray and rejoice that a man like this existed and CAN live again, if people would take a good look in the mirror and see where they are going.
I:9678;596;I watch this at least once a year, and have been for the past 25+ years!
I:9678;597;Ben Kingsley and Richard Attenborough made a masterpiece!
I:9678;598;justice and good judgment, and value of life are more active in 16.20 year olds than the younger ones, and thus it's probably aimed best for these ages!
I:9678;599;The story of Mahatma Gandhi was quite intriguing to me.
I:9678;600;Gandhi is such an inspiring man and the story played so well with the true and honest man he was.
I:9678;601;The way he interpreted the world and his views are unique and so intricate in the sense that many leaders of this world have applied his concept.
I:9678;602;He helped the many lived he influenced across a many of villages in Africa.
I:9678;603;His compassion and love made for a man with many loving traits.
I:9678;604;This film is a wonderful summary of the life of a man who is counted one of the greatest that have lived.
I:9678;605;A quote that I find it very meaningful from the movie: An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind, .
I:9678;606;I am enjoying the movie.
I:9678;607;i seem to love most British movies.
I:9678;608;An excellent documentary, reflecting values we are missing in our daily life.
I:9678;609;For discussions of the film's cinematic merits, you can read many of the other, fine reviews here.
I:9678;610;Though Ghandi begins in the 19th century and ends in the first half of the 20th, this is truly a story for the new millenium.
I:9678;611;The movie Gandhi portrays the story of the iconic historical figure and his life achievements.
I:9678;612;Gandhi has been a well.
I:9678;613;The quote, People from the next generation will never believe that a human such as him ever existed in flesh and bone, has some truth to it.
I:9678;614;The movie takes us through his life and he exhibits true devotion to his religion in every aspect of his life, from his marriage and family to his teachings that created freedom for the Hindus and Muslims of the British Empire.
I:9678;615;in Hinduism God is seen as one and as many, he is everywhere and everything.
I:9678;616;Gandhis constant good will towards man and equal rights often had him arrested or n trouble with the law but his good karma provided good results in every circumstance.
I:9678;617;Some of the other Hinduism symbols we see in the movie is the folding of the hands and saying, Namaste which is sign of respect (Brodd, et al. 120).
I:9678;618;Her love was so great and spiritual that it helped support and guide her husband.
I:9678;619;Gandhi is a great movie.
I:9678;620;In the end he was able to fully make amends with everyone.
I:9678;621;He not only wanted peace in where his home land was he wanted others around the world to actually see that without violence many things could be accomplished.
I:9678;622;This is one of those legendary films that will surmount it own time.
I:9678;623;And this is possibly the main feature of the immortal masterpieces, works which acquire an independent life and excel far beyond the crowd of bombastic epithets and remarkable adjectives.
I:9678;624;"not only it is worthy to remark the visible conviction of his director:Richard Attenborogh, from the initial shots, the splendid script, the superb artistic direction, the sumptuous photography, but I must insist around the performance of Kingsley as Gandhi
I:9678;625;"He became Gandhi
I:9678;626;The camera achieved the perfect equilibrium between the intimacy and the grandness, eloquence and transcendence, permeating literally your soul, senses, spirit and intellect.
I:9678;627;What this movie does is draw attention to the plight of India under colonial rule and the struggle to overcome it.
I:9678;628;It is distributed within India in Hindi as well it should be.
I:9678;629;this movie does a great job of tracing Ghandi's life as he emerged from trying to lead a comfortable life as a lawyer to an uncomfortable life as the father of a nation.
I:9678;630;One will truly appreciate the power of aggressive peaceful civil resistance which Gandhi employed so effectively.
I:9678;631;Ghandi, is the very important pace.
I:9678;632;man of the century, and the movie is the great tribute of hard labour of a little.
I:9678;633;Time to upgrade to the new stuff, good thing I did.
I:9678;634;I recommend the same to all of you.
I:9678;635;Prayer and fasting is very powerful!
I:9678;636;the life of Mahatma (Great soul) himself !!!
I:9678;637;He has continued to inspire so many of us.
I:9678;638;I enjoyed reading about Gandhi many years ago.
I:9678;639;I enjoyed looking at his story on the screen.
I:9678;640;I would recommend this movie to everyone, especially our youth today.
I:9678;641;violence and demonstrated strength and power.
I:9678;642;Excellent principal actor, such a view into the life and culture of idea.
I:9678;643;,Work of act, love to see more like it
I:9678;644;On one hand, they did a good job on much of the material.
I:9678;645;documented perversions with girls as you as 9 or 10 years were included.
I:9678;646;He enjoyed just as much and became aware of the historical significance.
I:9678;647;Gandhi is clearly a classic film.
I:9678;648;Greatest film on Gandhi ever made.
I:9678;649;This is by far the best movie I have ever seen.
I:9678;650;I was born many decades after the Mahatma's passing, and was privileged to see this picture when it premiered in our town in India.
I:9678;651;I would have liked to see more of the human side of the Mahatma in the movie.
I:9678;652;It definitely has a place in the library of anyone else interested in the impact of Gandhi's principles on history.
I:9678;653;This is also an excellent movie,and when I saw it on blu.
I:9678;654;ray I,knew that I wanted it,and enjoyed it more.
I:9678;655;and it was the highest grossing flick ever.
I:9678;656;True cinematic art is lost on the American Public.
I:9678;657;i liked the movie Ghandi.
I:9678;658;And if there is a Hindi version available I would Love to see it.
I:9678;659;In a stunning performance, Ben Kingsley stars as the famed Indian leader who showed the world that non.
I:9678;660;Director Richard Attenborough fills Gandhi's story with beautiful visuals, yet doesn't shy away from presenting the brutality of violence that Gandhi tried to avoid and end.
I:9678;661;Kingsley is simply amazing in the lead, seemingly inhabiting the body of his character.
I:9678;662;The supporting Western cast are often little more than cameos, well done although not necessary, and the Indian cast are excellent.
I:9678;663;The pace is a little too slow at times, but the film is rich in atmosphere and the photography is beautiful.
I:9678;664;I knew very little about the life of Gandhi prior to viewing this film, and I come away with a knowledge of who he was and an appreciation and respect for what he stood for.
I:9678;665;Gorgeous cinematography is combined here with top.
I:9678;666;notch acting and a compelling and moving story to make a truly powerful film.
I:9678;667;Over twenty years after its initial release, it still has the power to touch viewers of all ages on a deeply emotional and personal level.
I:9678;668;That's because its basic message of love, peace, and harmony .
I:9678;669;While individual clips can be used at various points in a modern world history curriculum, I have found the movie most valuable when it is show continuously, in its entirety, after students have already been made familiar with all of the appropriate thematic topics.
I:9678;670;over half a century after Gandhi's death, his message has continued to be an inspiration for millions, from all walks of life .
I:9678;671;and it's important to discuss this with any class before, during, and after a viewing of this movie.
I:9678;672;As historical based movies go, Gandhi is as good as they come.
I:9678;673;My husband and I loved this movie, even though it is very long (over 3 hours).
I:9678;674;It has historical value, it gives you a glimpse of the beauty of the actual country of India, and Gandhi's message of peace is amazing.
I:9678;675;"Gandhi represents a true masterpiece in film making, a three hour example of the greatness of the art
I:9678;676;deserved Oscar for best actor and this film is certainly deserving of its many accolades.
I:9678;677;beginning with a view of his assassination and then telling his life story, Gandhi is a thoroughly detailed and complete biography of one of modern history's most influential people.
I:9678;678;Believing in nonviolence and disobedience, he founds a philosophy for the mechanism of social change that will come to have a profound impact on future leaders like Dr. Martin Luther King jr. and Nelson Mandela.
I:9678;679;Gandhi's life story is both one of sacrifice and triumph, told beautifully in this film and portrayed by Ben Kingsley with stunning realism and emotion.
I:9678;680;Great educational movie that I have used in teaching civil disobedience and the life of Gandhi in high school.
I:9678;681;This is one epic picture!!!
I:9678;682;The Blu Ray transfer is superb,lots of great extras!!!
I:9678;683;A great 2 disc Blu Ray set!!!
I:9678;684;Great job Sony Pictures Home Entertainment!!!
I:9678;685;Worked flawlessly As for the movie it was amazing Ben Kingsley great performance.
I:9678;686;One of the greatest biopics ever made.
I:9678;687;Ben Kingsley is one of a kind, and this movie is a classic.
I:9678;688;I loved this movie about this holy saint.
I:9678;689;I loved that the wit and humor that he portrayed in his books was not lost in this movie!
I:9678;690;The acting was real and outstanding.
I:9678;691;Gandhi demonstrated that when a person has a higher cause, that is good, and he is an example of what it takes to achieve the higher cause, and is willing to sacrifice everything for it, it creates a power that unites millions of others.
I:9678;692;A great example for all of us to follow.
I:9678;693;nice to watch it again with so much happening in that part of the world.
I:9678;694;"What can be done is to be faithful in spirit to the record and try to find one's way to the heart of the man This is how the film ""Gandhi"" opens."
I:9678;695;Ghandi is epic in every sense of the word.
I:9678;696;Richard Attenborough created a film where everything from the screenplay to the acting, direction and cinematography were beyond impressive.
I:9678;697;The dialogue of the movie was well written, delivered by a cast which included Ben Kingsley in the lead role as Ghandi.
I:9678;698;Every actor portrayed their character believably, imparting the spirit of the time.
I:9678;699;They each captured the passion of their characters whether for or against an independent India.
I:9678;700;The incidence is pivotal, it changes his life.
I:9678;701;He truly captured the essence of Ghandi.
I:9678;702;Through Kingsley's depiction of Ghandi we see a country under tyranny led to its independence, we see India, the heart of Ghandi.
I:9678;703;india is beautifully visualized through the cinematography in this film.
I:9678;704;The film is able to capture the substance of a nation in turmoil, and extract every level of emotion out of the viewer.
I:9678;705;In the end the audience is left with a sense of achievement and loss, elation and sorrow, a beginning and an ending.
I:9678;706;ray transfer was great, not grainy at all.
I:9678;707;The Movie Ghandi is a 1982 film that brings Mohamdas Karamchand Ghandi's life to the silver screen.
I:9678;708;violent movements is very well observed.
I:9678;709;He helped establish villages where people would work and share common things.
I:9678;710;He is now gettine famous in South Africa and the world also.
I:9678;711;Throughout the movie Ghandi is imprisoned for years in South Africa.
I:9678;712;In 1915 he is released and returns to India to be with his family.
I:9678;713;Ghandi is well known for some of the most notable events that took place in Indian history in the twentieth century.
I:9678;714;He was really a great leader that stressed non.
I:9678;715;Great biography, kept me very engaged.
I:9678;716;And excellent production of the movie Gandhi.
I:9678;717;This is an incredible movie.
I:9678;718;But the story is absorbing and well acted.
I:9678;719;He becomes widely known as Mahatma, meaning great.
I:9678;720;After watching the movie I found that Hinduism beliefs played a huge part in this movie.
I:9678;721;He believed in treating people the way you want to be treated.
I:9678;722;I viewed this movie as a requirement in my world studies class during our unit on British Imperialism.
I:9678;723;One particular element to the story I found fulfilling was the display of younger Gandhi as an educated British lawyer.
I:9678;724;His change in identity was very well portrayed as he grew closer to his people.
I:9678;725;This video was an absolutely excellent supplement to my studies on Gandhi and imperialism.
I:9678;726;The manner in which such a frail old man as Gandhi overpowers an entire empire is nearly miraculous, and his attempts at unifying a very religiously diverse India are noble.
I:9678;727;I very strongly recommend this film to anyone who wants to know more about Gandhi, and anyone who would like to vicariously witness the spectacular accomplishments of one of the greatest persons in history.
I:9678;728;"it was definitely worth the time, dedication and wait.You rarely see motion pictures with pure
I:9678;729;"Especially in this day and age of ""blockbuster sequels, lewd
I:9678;730;A wonderful movie this is.
I:9678;731;ben Kingsley gives a convincing and mesmorising portrayal of Mohandas Gandhi, the peaceful warrior.
I:9678;732;Kingsley rightly deserved the 1982 Oscar for Best Actor.
I:9678;733;The movie is shot in some beautiful places in India as well as the not so beautiful places such as the riots in the large cities.
I:9678;734;Either way, the movie gives the important events in the history of India during and after British occupation in an unflinchingly manner.
I:9678;735;His words and insight are so revelant to the world today even 50 years after his death.
I:9678;736;This is a movie that captures the insight of Gandhi, it shows the personal struggle of him and the people of India during the time of British occupation and its eventual freedom.
I:9678;737;But we all should hope that peace will eventually spread throughout the two nations and the world.
I:9678;738;what an excellent movie this is and is highly recommended to everyone.
I:9678;739;It's very pretty and well acted.
I:9678;740;This film, even after a half dozen viewings continues to astonish and inspire!
I:9678;741;Every one of us had seen it multiple times, yet we all were consumed by our love for this extraordinary cinematic achievement.
I:9678;742;"winning ""Gandhi"" explores the life and principles of an extraordinary man who became an enduring example of holiness, humility, and humane resistance."
I:9678;743;Ben Kingsley inhabits his role with saintly authority, brilliantly conveying Gandhi's charisma and unwavering courage, while Candice Bergen (as photographer Margaret Bourke.
I:9678;744;white) and John Gielgud (as Lord Irwin) also shine in their respective roles.
I:9678;745;are handled with graceful verisimilitude.
I:9678;746;A deeply moving, masterful epic.
I:9678;747;I never thought I'd enjoy this movie.
I:9678;748;Winner of multiple Oscars, among them best picture, best director, best actor, Gandhi is indeed a very fine film.
I:9678;749;Richard Attenborough may not be the equal of David Lean, but this is an extremely successful masterwork.
I:9678;750;Ben Kingsley is great in the title role, and John Gielgud and Trevor Howard are among the fine cast.
I:9678;751;I especially enjoyed the interview with Ben Kingsley and the newsreel footage of Ghandi's travels.
I:9678;752;The package is worthy of such a great film.
I:9678;753;I have perused Gandhi's autobiography and, if we give him credit, he *was* an unusually good little boy and young man.
I:9678;754;his initial protests based more on principle and faith in the British legal system than heartfelt compassion.
I:9678;755;i found it highly amusing as the film went on this phrase started to become well.
I:9678;756;Ben Kingsley makes you believe that he is indeed the little brown man who changed history.
I:9678;757;"It is a ""must see."""
I:9678;758;There are films, books, paintings that all should force a bit of introspection.
I:9678;759;This movie makes me feel this way.
I:9678;760;I was very glad I finally got to see it!
I:9678;761;It was rather long to watch but e worth it.
I:9678;762;Just as Mahatma Gandhi's teachings will always live on in the heart and minds of all humans, so should this movie withstand the test of cinematic time.
I:9678;763;For those who have no other resources, this movie is also a standing testament to Gandhi's real legacy.
I:9678;764;First of all, Ben Kingsley, who plays Gandhi, does the best job portraying a historical figure on screen than anyone else I have ever seen.
I:9678;765;Here, Ben Kingsley not only portrays the eyes, but the walk, the voice, the look, even the squiggly vein on the side of his head that both he and Gandhi share.
I:9678;766;Second, this is one of the best epic movies ever made.
I:9678;767;The movie has a grand scale and teaches us all the meaning of peace and non.
I:9678;768;Richard Attenborough has captured the essence of India pre.
I:9678;769;Everyone should see this movie, everyone.
I:9678;770;reliance, and above all for achieving Swaraj.
I:9678;771;gandhi's approach to life was inspirational and admirable.
I:9678;772;I absolutely loved watching how he did not partake in violence no matter what physical, mental, or verbal abuse he was exposed to.
I:9678;773;And all of his followers committed their lives to behaving in the same way.
I:9678;774;This brought respect from me to Gandhi as a heroic individual and to the Hinduism religion and the way they approach life and their people.
I:9678;775;I would recommend it to anyone!
I:9678;776;Ben Kingsly was Gandhi, in appearance, in demeanor, in manner.
I:9678;777;His greatest role as the world's greatest leader and humanitarian.
I:9678;778;It is a beautifully made film about India, about Indians, about human beings, and last of all about Mahatma Gandhi, the inspiration to billions.
I:9678;779;Gandhi stands as Richard Attenborough's signature film, a sweeping epic biography of the spiritual giant among men who was Mohatma Gandhi.
I:9678;780;The film rates 5 stars for all of its cinematic accomplishments, from its stunning cinematography to its colorful palette of costumes, set design and lighting.
I:9678;781;The film is Oscar worthy, especially Ben Kinglsey's starling transformation as the peace loving hero.
I:9678;782;Ben Kingsley's performance is outstanding, and the way the story highlights small details of Gandhi's life is beautiful.
I:9678;783;Wonderful film that takes you back in time and give you an appreciation for the man.
I:9678;784;Excelent Movie, well done, good acting, Ben Kingsley best performance ever.
I:9678;785;Moving ans inspiring story, I recommend it without hesitation.
I:9678;786;I showed this to a World Cultures class of 10th grade students and it was spellbinding for them after they got used to the fact that it wasn't an action.
I:9678;787;The impact of the story is timeless.
I:9678;788;I have seen this movie twice I still find it mesmerizing.
I:9678;789;ccoperation can still succeed in the midst of prejudice oppression.
I:9678;790;It may take time but it is worth the wait.
I:9678;791;The transformative story of Gandhi should be told again and again, for generations of humans seeking to experience deep and abiding truths about our human condition.
I:9678;792;It has significance to our own history.
I:9678;793;It won 8 (I believe) Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Lead Actor, Best Director, Best Costumes, and more.
I:9678;794;I'm a Jewel in the Crown fan, and watching Gandhi is essential for filling in the historical context from the Indian point of view.
I:9678;795;The Featurettes, especially the stupendous filming of the funeral on an actual anniversary of Gandhi's real funeral, is gripping to watch.
I:9678;796;Ben Kingsley brought Gandhi back to life not only for people around the world meeting the brilliant leader for the 1st time, but as you'll see if you watch the Featurettes, for generations of Indians as well.
I:9678;797;It's utterly amazing how the film was created.
I:9678;798;Learning that story explains why the film is so superbly accurate.
I:9678;799;just as amazing is how much the main characters actually look like the real men from history.
I:9678;800;I know these actors from other films but was stunned to see their resemblance to the historical figures.
I:9678;801;And it should be in everyone's film library.
I:9678;802;The movie depicts reality quite well.
I:9678;803;There is a misconception that Ben Kingsley is a British actor.
I:9678;804;He is an Indian, his real name being Krishna Bhanji, and has merely Anglicized his name.
I:9678;805;Those wishing to see more of the Mahatma see the movies .
I:9678;806;I had to watch for homework in my English class.
I:9678;807;Gandhi started to fast and people eventually started to see the light, and stop fighting.
I:9678;808;Peace can be accomplished if everyone has Gandhi's outlook on life and non.
I:9678;809;I loved this movie because of the passion the Gandhi had for other people, and the impact that one man can make on an entire country.
I:9678;810;only downside is that there is no commentary but there is a very insightful interview with Ben Kingsley (Ghandi)who talks about how he prepared for and made the film.
I:9678;811;I found particulary interesting was his thoughts about how the funeral scene was filmed.
I:9678;812;there are no computer special effects in this film so it is every bit the 'epic'
I:9678;813;And I was honestly hesitant to watch it, but one day I decided to.
I:9678;814;I was moved in ways I can't really explain.
I:9678;815;After I finished watching, I took a moment, collected myself, and thought .
I:9678;816;I recommend this film to everyone.
I:9678;817;I remembered this so vividly from when I first saw it that I couldn't believe it had been almost three decades.
I:9678;818;I showed it to my Aisan Studies class, and one student told me afterward, I looked it up on the internet, and when I saw when it was made, I didn't expect much .
I:9678;819;This is an incredible film, moving and memorable.
I:9678;820;Just do a quote search for some of the powerful sayings from this film.
I:9678;821;Gandhi was a very interesting movie from beginning to end.
I:9678;822;In his eyes, we are all children of God and created equally.
I:9678;823;He came up with the famous quote, Love thy neighbor as thyself.
I:9678;824;Unarmed women, men, children, and babies died for believing in their religion.
I:9678;825;Lots of people to this day still try to carry on the actions of a man like Gandhi.
I:9678;826;The movie itself is edited, cut, and imitated so viewers can have a brief idea of his life and struggles.
I:9678;827;He was a man of great power who chose not to brag or boast about such.
I:9678;828;Gandhis movement was very powerful, and it affected us all one way or another.
I:9678;829;Gandhi is a biographical film based on the courageous and influential life of Mohandas Gandhi.
I:9678;830;Gandhi was a patient and nonviolent peacemaker filled with tolerance and love.
I:9678;831;gandhi believed that in order to gain independence they must prove worthy of it, and that there must always be Hindu/Muslim unity.
I:9678;832;He was taken out for a walk with a crowd full of people to greet him.
I:9678;833;A great movie with a wondeful lesson that needs to be practiced to a degree by everyone in this country and beyond.
I:9678;834;What a life this man had.
I:9678;835;What a great lesson on how to treat your fellow man.
I:9678;836;as it is, it comes close.
I:9678;837;"the pluses
I:9678;838;the best moments in the film are his moments of self.
I:9678;839;still, an epic telling of one of the most important, influential and inspiring people of thelast 500 years, and well worth seeing.
I:9678;840;"What can be done is to be faithful in spirit to the record and to try to find one's way to the heart of the man."""
I:9678;841;Because of Gandhi's genius Great Britain is forced to grant independence to India.
I:9678;842;This division takes place despite the objections of Gandhi and his willingness to share power with the Muslim.
I:9678;843;He gains enemies on both sides and is eventually killed by one.
I:9678;844;It is such a good movie.
I:9678;845;It is one of my favorite things to teach each year because the movie was made so well, shows so many important events throughout Gandhi's life, and the kids always love it.
I:9678;846;I recommend watching it for pleasure as well.
I:9678;847;Gandhi was an excellent movie that didn't hold back any punches when looking at the life of Gandhi and the injustice that he fought.
I:9678;848;"GANDHI is Sir Richard Attenborough's magnificent film biography of the incomparable Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi who led India to independence in the first half of the twentieth century by employing Satyagraha (""truth."
I:9678;849;attenborough worked for twenty years to create this wonderful labor of love, which is David Lean.
I:9678;850;esque in scope and storyline and cinematography.
I:9678;851;Many important personages and occurrences in the Mahatma's life are glimpsed in passing and are not deeply explored.
I:9678;852;Gandhi's was the first modern one, able to benefit from recording media and journalistic coverage.
I:9678;853;Also extremely interesting is Attenborough's Director's Commentary, which exposes the underpinnings of this project and Gandhi's profound effect on the man who made this picture.
I:9678;854;cooperation with evil over decades, and bringing this incredible moral power to bear not only against the British, but against those Hindus and Muslims who would see India riven into two.
I:9678;855;Gandhi's campaign of nonviolence and fasting is well.
I:9678;856;this is a Himalayan film about a truly Himalayan human being.
I:9678;857;the movie was made so vivid,even though all the movies should have been as vivid as this one.
I:9678;858;This is what I call a classic of all times.
I:9678;859;First, it displays the oppression that many religions have faced when they are the minority in their resident nation.
I:9678;860;Overall, the movie Gandhi was educational and informative.
I:9678;861;This is a great movie that explores how Gandhi became known world.
I:9678;862;wide, what he stood for and how he brought India together to rise up and claim their freedom from British control.
I:9678;863;The movie Gandhi tells a story about patience, courage and non.
I:9678;864;I remember watching this as a teenage and liking it, but not completely understanding it.
I:9678;865;Now at 62 there is a lot more I understand about this important historical man.
I:9678;866;He brought a concept to 3.5 million Indians and was able to cross religious and cultural lines and bring about a peaceful solution to a touchy situation.
I:9678;867;I thought it chronicled his life very well and was visually stunning.
I:9678;868;I recommend it highly to anyone interested in history.
I:9678;869;gandhi was able to lead a highly effective march in South Africa, and his success caused him to return to India where he could work for an even greater cause, Indian Independence.
I:9678;870;The British ruled the nation of India, and treated the citizens as second class.
I:9678;871;In the movie the Hindu religion was depicted as a strong loyalty to ones beliefs.
I:9678;872;This shows that the Hindu religion requires strong will and devotion.
I:9678;873;Gandhi possessed such a strong devotion, faith filled belief in his way of life that was admiring.
I:9678;874;"Hindu religion was well portrayed in this movie it lead to a greater understanding of the Hindu religion and the ""Mahatma"" (Great Soul) Gandhi."
I:9678;875;Gandhi is a biographical film that tells the story of the life of Mohandas Gandi.
I:9678;876;It covers his life up until his assassination in 1948.
I:9678;877;The end of his life was actually portrayed at the beginning and throughout the movie it flashed back into earlier points in his life.
I:9678;878;Because of this, when Gandhi returns to India, he is seen as a hero.
I:9678;879;This movie covers Hinduism as well as Islam since there was a big up rise between Hindus and Muslims.
I:9678;880;I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and recommend any and everyone to watch it.
I:9678;881;Watching this movie is a good reminder that coexistence is something I stand strongly for.
I:9678;882;It is a huge eye opener.
I:9678;883;Ben Kingsley brought Gandhi back to life in this wonderful production and brought back memories of his tragic end.
I:9678;884;The story of Gandhi ,most everyone knows about but I wanted to watch again at my own pace.
I:9678;885;Ben Kingsley is more than amazing.
I:9678;886;The man is spectacular and he truly deserved the Oscar that he won.
I:9678;887;History and biography buffs MUST watch this movie.
I:9678;888;Richard Attenborough does an amazing job with this movie.
I:9678;889;"This was up against a number of excellent movies including "" E. t. the Extraterrestial "" ."
I:9678;890;Gandhi was a quiet great movie .
I:9678;891;I saw it by accident years ago and it has become one of my favorite films since .
I:9678;892;Just the story of one of the most remarkable men of all time .
I:9678;893;This magnificent film has a cast of thousands as it was was produced before digitizing later became common practice.
I:9678;894;And during the course of the film, he just melted right into the character of this very special man he was portraying.
I:9678;895;The supporting cast was wonderful too and included Candice Bergen, John Gielgud, Trevor Howard, Martin Sheen and Om Puri.
I:9678;896;Always, he yearned for freedom for his people from British rule.
I:9678;897;See it for the great performances.
I:9678;898;See it for a sense of history.
I:9678;899;And see it as a moral lesson in what is possible.
I:9678;900;The film Gandhi illustrates the life of a heroic religious idol in hinduism by the name of mahatma gandhi.
I:9678;901;It then continues on with a flashback to his more youthful years.
I:9678;902;Gandhi was born and raised into Hinduism in so this film directly relates to world religions because of that.
I:9678;903;He incorporated his understanding of his religion into his movement.
I:9678;904;He utilized his firm and devotional loyalty to the moral of non.
I:9678;905;Great movie and even better in Blu.
I:9678;906;One of those movies that you watch over and over.
I:9678;907;This is a movie that everyone should see.
I:9678;908;It is a classic and beautifully produced movie which tells the story of one of the great men in history who changed the world without the use of an army, weapons or money.
I:9678;909;Well done story about a unique man and time in history.
I:9678;910;Haven't seen this movie in about 10 yrs and we really enjoyed it.
I:9678;911;It's a classic and a must for any collection.
I:9678;912;It really tives a fine point of view of the high points and turning points in Ghandi's life.
I:9678;913;I show clips of it to my Sophomore class in college and they are always impressed with it.
I:9678;914;What a fantastic man Gandhi was !
I:9678;915;I'd read the book many years ago and I'd seen the movie.
I:9678;916;very inspiring to see how little one may need to become, and remain, content.
I:9678;917;Excellent portrayal of a historical figure.
I:9678;918;One of the best films ever.
I:9678;919;This mans life is truly an example for us all.
I:9678;920;This movie is a story of a simple man who changed the world with his moral and willpower.
I:9678;921;He showed to the world that truth, morals and nonviolence are the most powerful weapons.
I:9678;922;inspiring great life story wotrh watching again and again.
I:9678;923;When you slip the case out of its' plastic holder, you are treated to the fuller version of the same picture, which, with the wonders of Adobe Photoshop, have rendered what was once just another studio shot of Ben Kingsley as Gandhi, into something far more magical and memorable.
I:9678;924;On this front, I give the disc a full five stars.
I:9678;925;The great Alyque Padamsee who played Jinnah, the wonderful Roshan Seth who played Nehru, the incredibly talented Saeed Jaffrey who played Sardar Patel .
I:9678;926;The Hindi version was the one released to millions of people in India, and the one that plays on Indian national television to this day.
I:9678;927;Nehru was more influenced by Moghul and English culture, and held on to that.
I:9678;928;In real life, he was complicated.
I:9678;929;The truth is he probably wasnt a very good father.
I:9678;930;there is much more to this man than meets the eye.
I:9678;931;So, do yourself a favor.
I:9678;932;So, do yourself a favor and read a few books as well, and you will not have a one.
I:9678;933;This movie challenges the viewer to examine the motivating forces and beliefs that lie behind the way people treat and interact with others.
I:9678;934;"given the warring history of the human animal, that has continued after Ghandi's death, this movie made me bow my head is sorrow and wonder
I:9678;935;It left a lasting impression on me.
I:9678;936;This movie is a timeless lesson on world views regarding politics,as well as social, and spritual tasks ahead of us.
I:9678;937;It demonstrates how one visionary can change a society for the benefit of all.
I:9678;938;i would recommend this movie to anyone interested in learning more about the journey of the human condition.
I:9678;939;This movie is a must see !!
I:9678;940;I remember this movie as a youth and never really appreciated the full scope of what Gandhi did.
I:9678;941;ben Kingsley is a true marksman of acting the role of Gandhi .
I:9678;942;You felt like you knew Gandhi as he lived loved and taught peace without condition or retribution for those who beat him down along the journey .
I:9678;943;an eye for eye will make the world blind.
I:9678;944;i never really knew the story behind Gandhi's works.
I:9678;945;Simply awfulGandhi is one of the greatest biographies ever made.
I:9678;946;Ben Kingsley is supurb as the spiritual leader, it is no surprise he one the Oscar for best actor.
I:9678;947;This is one movie that is worth the 3 hour running time.
I:9678;948;A Historical Biography about a man that lived far beyond the call of duty.
I:9678;949;A classic movie about a peaceful and beautiful man.
I:9678;950;see for its historical significance.
I:9678;951;This may be common knowledge but Ben Kingsley is incredible in this role.
I:9678;952;Not only is this film wonderfully entertaining, it is also educational.
I:9678;953;I learned a great deal about S Africa and India and Pakistan.
I:9678;954;It doesn't seem possible but I believe this film just might do justice to the life of the incredible man.
I:9678;955;"I have the utmost respect for Mr. Gandhi
I:9678;956;It is a well documented fact that Mr. Jinnah was an impressionable speaker and immaculate in his attire.
I:9678;957;In his dealings Mr. Jinnah is known to be very noble and just.
I:9678;958;richard Attenborough does immense injustice to this fact and in doing so does a great dis.
I:9678;959;It was powerful movie then.
I:9678;960;If anything the relevance, power and importance of its message is even greater today.
I:9678;961;This is a must see!Gandhi still challenges us to live up to our highest ideals.
I:9678;962;I'd recommend watching it in two sittings, first night up to the intermission and then come back the next day for the final powerful conclusion.
I:9678;963;A compelling story of an underappreciated, extraordinary leader, who led the struggle of his nation against British colonialism, beautifully presented.
I:9678;964;"The life of a man of peace, who was assassinated by individuals who abhorred peace
I:9678;965;this is a great movie about the life of a great man performed by an outstanding actor!
I:9678;966;Gandhi is pictured as a quiet humble man, seeking fair and just treatment for Muslim and Hindu Indians.
I:9678;967;viewing this film was a perfect addition to my studies of World Religions, as it not only depicted the recent topic of Hindu culture, but also demonstrated the pluralistic behavior of Gandhi.
I:9678;968;"One of Gandhi's most memorable quotes which demonstrates his equal respect for all faiths and people is ""A small body of determined spirits fired by an unquenchable faith in their mission can alter the course of history""."
I:9678;969;This film introduces us to the essence and primary thoughts of Mohandas K. Gandhi and explores the patience and diligence of non.
I:9678;970;in the beginning we see a very young, fair.
I:9678;971;The earliest pictures of MKG show him as strikingly light.
I:9678;972;skinned, and his bios tell us that he had made an excellent career for himself leading as priviledged a life as an Indian man could at the turn of the last century.
I:9678;973;"Although he takes on the ""Bapu"" persona, underneath is a razor sharp British educated solicitor who guides his country into ""home rule""."
I:9678;974;the honesty of this film is striking enough to capture a glimpse of this little understood man here in the west and give clarity to his main philosophies at least.
I:9678;975;But we can get a honest look at his life and what drove him through this well written script and beautifully photographed film.
I:9678;976;the widescreen edition is by far the best way to enjoy the film and although there are naysayers to the films integrity, there are many Indian actors in it as well as British, American and more.
I:9678;977;It is an excellent choice for a quiet afternoon or to introduce young people to this man of principle.
I:9678;978;Beyond this movie being beautifully shot, on location, and brilliantly acted, there lies a thing.
I:9678;979;Not just the brilliant shots, glorious angles and fantastic landscapes.
I:9678;980;And become aware of the most powerful exposition of what it is to be human I have ever experienced.
I:9678;981;But Mr. Attenborough, the conception of Gandhi and those around him, India, Africa, England, they will all conspire to show you something truly amazing.
I:9678;982;But this movie has powerful things to say.
I:9678;983;"I enjoyed this movie because
I:9678;984;I thought Kingsley did an outstanding job!
I:9678;985;The concept of Passive Resistance was such a masterpiece of strategy by Gandhi for those times.
I:9678;986;I thought this movie was very interesting, I enjoyed it.
I:9678;987;I found myself researching more about Gandhi.
I:9678;988;This movie won best picture of 1982.
I:9678;989;Can't remember what the other nominees were but I am quite sure this was the best from 1982.
I:9678;990;His resemblance with the real Gandhi is scary.
I:9678;991;It is an important movie that needs to be seen by everyone, especially after the event of Sep 11, 2001.
I:9678;992;The 190 minutes movie somehow manage to tell us what we need to know about Gandhi.
I:9678;993;What I will add is the value of seeing the original film in high definition.
I:9678;994;Among its 8 Oscars are the awards for Best Cinematography and Best Art Direction, meaning the visual experience is on par with the storyline and acting.
I:9678;995;When I first saw this film in 1982, it reminded me of one of David Lean's epics.
I:9678;996;The cast is top notch, the acting is superb (Ben Kingsley is amazing in this role), and the photography is gorgeous.
I:9678;997;The sound and color all look wonderful, and the extra features are informative.
I:9678;998;This movie is very interesting as it shows some of Gandhi's philosophies.
I:9678;999;Great movie and great reproduction.
I:9678;1000;Gandhi is one of the best movies that I have seen so far.
I:9678;1001;This movie is very powerful and showed that with dedication, faith, and belief if you stand by what you believe in anything is possible.
I:9678;1002;This movie also teaches us non.
I:9678;1003;"He also describes a valuable line, ""I am Muslim, Hindu, Christian, and also a Jew,"" This simplifies that we all are one and that we all love our God in our own way and religion."
I:9678;1004;Gandhi lead by example that world peace is possible with all religions.
I:9678;1005;I recommend everyone to watch this movie.
I:9678;1006;A very good film about Gandhi.
I:9678;1007;Excellent movie showing the truth about his life and struggle to bring independence to India and freedom to humans.
I:9678;1008;Gandhi is a brilliant encapsulation of the life of the man who must be counted among the greatest, most admirable figures in the history of humankind.
I:9678;1009;without doubt one of the finest biographical epics ever made.
I:9678;1010;"It garnered six Academy Awards, including Best Picture
I:9678;1011;This film beautifully fulfills the goals set out in the film's preface: .
I:9678;1012;to be faithful in spirit to the record and try to find one's way to the heart of the man.
I:9678;1013;in this masterfully produced, directed, written, and acted film, the life of Mohandas K. Gandhi is painted against the backdrop of some of the most momentous events in twentieth century Indian history.
I:9678;1014;Gandhi shows how the Mahatma (Great Soul) leads a nation of 350 million people to freedom from British colonial rule using non.
I:9678;1015;He knew how to confront his political enemies in ways that got his point across while garnering from his foes a grudging respect.
I:9678;1016;"the man of peace who consistently espouses the dignity of all people
I:9678;1017;Every aspect of this film is masterfully done!
I:9678;1018;Ben Kingsley's portrayal of Gandhi is one of those singular performances that is so good that it defies description.
I:9678;1019;His meticulous preparation for this part is readily evident in every scene in which he appears.
I:9678;1020;His physical resemblance to the real Gandhi, and the way he mimicked Gandhi's mannerisms, is so realistic as to be positively eerie.
I:9678;1021;Kingsley's performance is always sensitive, even slightly understated.
I:9678;1022;Yet there is always present a powerful intensity that conveys the deep spirituality and integrity of the man he so lovingly portrays.
I:9678;1023;This a truly magnificent restoration and remastering of this great film!
I:9678;1024;amazing feat to have done in ones life time.
I:9678;1025;Lord Richard Attenborough is a wonderful director.
I:9678;1026;Gandhi was a very special person and his life story, personal philosophy and approach to life are a fountain of wisdom.
I:9678;1027;You can watch this film over and over and each time you learn something new.
I:9678;1028;From technical perspective, the film is well made and the fact that it lasts for almost 3 hours is actually to its advantage.
I:9678;1029;Ben Kingsley's performance is also top.
I:9678;1030;I experienced thoughts like, wait, huh, and what happened?!
I:9678;1031;In my opinion, it was done so the audience could experience, early on, the intense emotion that the film would create.
I:9678;1032;One of my favorite scenes of the movie was when Gandhi was on the train.
I:9678;1033;I found it quite comical.
I:9678;1034;An India ruled by a relatively a handful of British.
I:9678;1035;I found that scene altogether refreshing.
I:9678;1036;In a nut shell, this movie fits into the philosophical aspect of Hinduism exceptionally well (Brodd 92).
I:9678;1037;It was absolutely breathtaking, a bit long, yet captivating.
I:9678;1038;It reminds us that we are all human and we are all capable of the most extraordinary and wonderful achievements.
I:9678;1039;We can all simply use our imagination, our will, and our sense of righteousness.
I:9678;1040;richard Attenborough brings this film.
I:9678;1041;gandhi in this film is Portrayed as a Kindred Spirit of Dr. martin Luther King.
I:9678;1042;Ben Kingsley's portrayal of Ghandi is stellar!
I:9678;1043;He won the Oscar of Best Actor and he deserved it!The film documents the history of India during the time of Ghandi and depicts the political atmosphere of the times, a must see for anyone who loves history.
I:9678;1044;It is a great autobiography.
I:9678;1045;Ghandi accomplished so much through his nonviolent ways.
I:9678;1046;The words in this book are very thought provoking.
I:9678;1047;this was a movie well done.
I:9678;1048;very informative about the life of a man that changed the world with original thought and self motovation.
I:9678;1049;it is educationl entertaining and inspiring.
I:9678;1050;gandhi was a great man.
I:9678;1051;What a tale it is, from being a reletively simple, unknown attorney to becoming one of the greatest world leaders in history.
I:9678;1052;But this movie, as well as his written work, taught me how to be a better person.
I:9678;1053;rake and cover the latrine) you do with joy.
I:9678;1054;When I despair, I remember that all through history the ways of truth and love have always won.
I:9678;1055;The movie is based on a true story.
I:9678;1056;Gandhi is a movie that won 9 Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Actor Ben Kingsley, and Best Director Richard Attenborough.
I:9678;1057;Even after roughly six decades of his death, Gandhi continues to influence and minds and hearts of people from all around the world.
I:9678;1058;This movie is a fantastic description of the life of an ordinary man who rose to become one of the world's most influential people.
I:9678;1059;Being Indian and watching it at such a young age was definitely a memory I will never forget.
I:9678;1060;I've seen it since over a dozen times and love it every time.
I:9678;1061;I was ecstatic to see they finally made a two disc special edition one and grabbed it.
I:9678;1062;This movie will live on for centuries, and I really think it's high time someone makes just as symbolic a movie of Martin Luther King Jr. so that children of this time can have a movie to cherish for in centures to follow!
I:9678;1063;Every once in a while this world produces an exceptional human being whose presence makes it a much better place to live in.
I:9678;1064;Ben Kingsley gives a grand performance as Gandhi, from his youth to his death.
I:9678;1065;"The impersonation is spot on
I:9678;1066;if you are looking for a biography of this man on film, this movie is an excellent source.
I:9678;1067;Condensing Gandhi's life into a few hours is such a great feat, especially when there is so much of this man that could be explored.
I:9678;1068;The movie was filmed in India, with 300,000 extras, so if you like epic films you will definitely enjoy this one.
I:9678;1069;The scenery is authentic and the characters have a reality about them so often lacking in `hollywood' films.
I:9678;1070;candy' version of a historical event, this is a real movie about a real person.
I:9678;1071;A wonderful movie about a man with far reaching goals for a nation under the iron fist of colonial England.
I:9678;1072;Excellent movie, a must see
I:9678;1073;I am not a great movie buff, but this is an excellent masterpiece.
I:9678;1074;It was good to watch a movie with morals, Ben Kingsley can play any Character and make you believe.
I:9678;1075;Sir Ben Kingsley is a very versatile actor and it's no wonder that he was awarded with an Oscar for his work.
I:9678;1076;Was delivered promptly and in excellent condition.
I:9678;1077;Richard Attenborough's Gandhi is a masterfully told, massively mounted epic motion picture, depicting the life and times of Gandhi, a benevolant crusader for peace, whose shocking assassination rocked the world.
I:9678;1078;Ben Kingsley rightfully took home the Oscar for his subtle but stunning transformation into the title role.
I:9678;1079;WARNING: This is a slow paced movie but well worth the three hour plus investment of your time.
I:9678;1080;columbia Tristar has given us a very beautiful print of the film.
I:9678;1081;Colors are rich, bold and vibrant.
I:9678;1082;Although black levels are not always at their darkest, this is relatively forgivable, since most of the film takes place during the day.
I:9678;1083;Shimmering, aliasing and edge enhancement are all present but in extremely minute amounts, leaving one with nothing to do but admire the visual presentation in all of its breathtaking cinematography.
I:9678;1084;The soundtrack is 2.0 surround but well represented.
I:9678;1085;Some of the audio has a tendancy to appear thin or strident but, again, considering its dated fidelity and the source material, it is remarkably well represented.
I:9678;1086;disappointing for a big time Oscar winner like this.
I:9678;1087;A must have for those who love history.
I:9678;1088;I will surly let my grand children view this important part of our history.
I:9678;1089;Ben Kingsley's portrayal of Gandhi is a tour de force.
I:9678;1090;Cinematography is beautiful, supporting actors very good.
I:9678;1091;Such a long and eventful life can scarcely be covered even in a movie this long, but it is a great effort.
I:9678;1092;Kudos to film makers who go to great lengths to cast an actor who more than just resembles the person being depicted.
I:9678;1093;Watching this movie I learned about the man behind the 'quotes'.
I:9678;1094;The settings of the movie were spectacular!
I:9678;1095;mounted version of the Mahatma's life that decides to deify its subject rather than examining him but nonetheless emerges as a solid biopic.
I:9678;1096;I found the movie very informative.
I:9678;1097;I really enjoyed the movie.
I:9678;1098;It's a long movie, so popcorn and candy are necessary.
I:9678;1099;I am a school teacher and I bought this movie to supplement a unit on imperialism, India's fight for freedom and the changes brought about by Ghandi.
I:9678;1100;It was a great aid in meeting my frame works.
I:9678;1101;The life of Ghandi gives hope to those of us who want to peacefully stand up for what is right.
I:9678;1102;I have never seen a movie that touched me the way this one has.
I:9678;1103;To see Gandhi as he transforms himself (or is he transformed by others?)
I:9678;1104;from Mohandas K. Gandhi, Lawyer, into Mahatma Gandhi, Revolutionary, is a testament to his strength and wisdom .
I:9678;1105;it also shows a great deal of his cunning!
I:9678;1106;Witnessing Mohandas' inner struggle in the early years in South Africa when he first began using civil disobedience also humanizes this transformation, and shows that even a man as dedicated as Gandhi sometimes can be afraid.
I:9678;1107;Seeing his momentary trepidation at the Indian Card Burning rally showed both his resolve and its costs.
I:9678;1108;all of these characteristics are brought to the screen wonderfully by Ben Kingsley, who was born to play this part.
I:9678;1109;Amazingly enough, this is Ben's first major role, and to put it lightly, he nailed it.
I:9678;1110;Seeing newsreels of Gandhi and viewing Kinsgley's performance is like viewing two of the same thing.
I:9678;1111;Gandhi's use of passive resistance brought the British Empire to its knees, and served as a blueprint for many of the leaders that we admire today, such as Martin Luther King, Jr. and others.
I:9678;1112;"A Gandhi quote used often in the movie seems appropriate for this scenario: ""When I despair, I think that all through history, the way of truth and love has always triumphed."
I:9678;1113;Given the tremendous contribution of these unknown (to Americans) actors, I would have liked to get to know more about their work and histories.
I:9678;1114;overall, the drawbacks are significantly outweighed by the powerful acting and message of this movie.
I:9678;1115;I loved everything about this movie.
I:9678;1116;It captured the spirit of Gandhi's life, had a well developed plot, great characters, beautiful scenery, wonderful music and was a fine example of great drama.
I:9678;1117;this is the best theatrical biography I have ever seen and it is possibly my favorite movie of all time.
I:9678;1118;It is truly inspirational and raises the bar for this type of movie considerably.
I:9678;1119;In short, it is a masterpiece.
I:9678;1120;This film does an excellent job at telling the story of the life of a beautiful, inspirational man.
I:9678;1121;Everyone should watch this film at least once!
I:9678;1122;This movie is one of my all time favorites.
I:9678;1123;The transfer to blu ray is excellent considering how long ago the movie was filmed.
I:9678;1124;I think this is a great addition to your collection especially if you're a Ben Kingsley fan or love historical dramas
I:9678;1125;It was every bit as good as I remembered it from the big screen.
I:9678;1126;What I can't believe is that it has been more than 25 years since its release.
I:9678;1127;As a model for teaching the power of non.
I:9678;1128;Very captivating and strong performances.
I:9678;1129;In 1982, a great film about the trials and tribulations of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was born.
I:9678;1130;gandhi was arrested numerous times while facing intense pressure and attention nationally and internationally.
I:9678;1131;Consequently, he is imprisoned and arrested multiple times yet eventually brings enough pressure from the international public that the United Kingdom grants India independence as a result of his leading the movement.
I:9678;1132;kind, involved in religion as a leader, brought as much successful and righteous change to the world without the use of force as Mohandas Gandhi did.
I:9678;1133;In closing, this film holds the world record for the most extras ever used in a film and in my opinion, Gandhi himself holds the world record for the most successful, non.
I:9678;1134;The film is of epic proportions, yet hardly ignores the small things and nuances of Gandhi, and comes a close as is possible to capturing the essence of the greatness of the man.
I:9678;1135;Ben Kingsley characterization of Gandhi is flawless, and the movie is beautifully framed and filmed.
I:9678;1136;The supporting actors are nearly as good, making for an all around terrific effort.
I:9678;1137;I recommend it to the entire family, if you can tear them away from action games and immerse them a little while in history and storytelling instead.
I:9678;1138;Gandhi is one of the most earnest movies ever to take a Best Picture Oscar.
I:9678;1139;"That's not a political statement
I:9678;1140;It is an enduring human tragedy and mystery that so many great healers have met violent ends, while some of humanity's worst villains have died peacefully.
I:9678;1141;After the initial assassination, the story flashes back to the beginning of Gandhi's adult life, which took place in South Africa.
I:9678;1142;This is a truly massive production.
I:9678;1143;For the title role, Attenborough .
I:9678;1144;chose to debut Ben Kingsley, who portrayed Gandhi so well that he earned several top acting honors including the Oscar.
I:9678;1145;It's a tribute to him that despite the movie's scale, Kingsley always commands its center.
I:9678;1146;As I said, it's an earnest movie and a most thoughtful portrayal .
I:9678;1147;Saw it in the theatre and enjoyed it again at home.
I:9678;1148;A classic not to be missed.
I:9678;1149;I love it , great movie and lovely presentation I would recommend everyone watching at least once in their lifetime
I:9678;1150;Yes it was very good and educational.
I:9678;1151;This is like what others have said, a great movie about a great soul.
I:9678;1152;iMO, Partition was the best thing that happened to India.
I:9678;1153;But a good portion of the 180 Million Muslims in India are Pakistanies at heart.
I:9678;1154;A grace period of 10 years since 1947 or whatever the time period you think is reasonable should have been established.
I:9678;1155;as a Spiritual and moral light, Gandhi was right.
I:9678;1156;Richard Attenborough's Gandhi is a loving look at the life of one the biggest figures of the 20th century.
I:9678;1157;Ben Kingsley is brilliant in the lead role.
I:9678;1158;His transformation from a strong.
I:9678;1159;headed young lawyer to the understanding leader of non.
I:9678;1160;deserved Oscar (though Paul Newman was equally deserving for his role in The Verdict that year) for the role.
I:9678;1161;The film is also quite beautiful to look at as Mr. Attenborough captures the mysticism of India.
I:9678;1162;If one can fight through the over three hours of film, you will have seen a great performance and beautiful vistas.
I:9678;1163;The film predictably swept through the 1982 Oscars (the academy loves factual epics), winning Best Picture, Best Director, as mentioned Best Actor and five other awards.
I:9678;1164;This is the story of one of the truly great men in history, told remarkably well by a great Director, and played by one of the great actors of our times.
I:9678;1165;"The film is extraordinary in every respect
I:9678;1166;ghandi is easily one of the top ten greatest films of the past 25 years.
I:9678;1167;Hollywood take note, this is probably the best film ever made.
I:9678;1168;Without a doubt it's the best of the modern era.
I:9678;1169;"The sets are utterly magnificent
I:9678;1170;I'd give it 6 stars if possible.
I:9678;1171;What a great movie for those that missed it back when.
I:9678;1172;If you haven't seen this, it gives you more understanding of people and more respect of this man and his truly worldwide impact.
I:9678;1173;'Gandhi' is the most authentic movie I have seen on a political figure's life.
I:9678;1174;The movie keeps the storyline on Gandhi throughout and it makes for more realistic and gripping viewing.
I:9678;1175;Its shows the independence struggle in its full glory.
I:9678;1176;The acting is very realistic, specially by Ben Kingsley and Rohini Hattangadi.
I:9678;1177;The number of Oscars for the movie in most of the categories are a testament to the accuracy and vision of the director in bringing the life and times of Gandhi to the big screen accurately and truthfully.
I:9678;1178;Gandhi was lots of fun.
I:9678;1179;gandhi was a cool dudehe was smarter than most the people he hung out with.
I:9678;1180;gandhi was old school but he could have been big today.yes it was a good movie for those of us who can really understand what Gandhi had up his sleeve.
I:9678;1181;The movie gives an exceptional potray of Mahatma Gandhi, The father of India.
I:9678;1182;Gandhi is a great classic.
I:9678;1183;each has taught me something new and insightful in the path of non.
I:9678;1184;but each viewing provides more motivation to exert more effort in learning and practicing non.
I:9678;1185;I believe and know that such is the proper path .
I:9678;1186;This film was so well made and inspiring that it made me want to go out and devour anything I can find on Gandhi.
I:9678;1187;This movie is a perfect depiction of English Imperialism.
I:9678;1188;Ben Kingsley was born Krishna Bhanji.
I:9678;1189;The story of Gandhi has had such a terrific impact on me over the years.
I:9678;1190;This man, by his life, shows us how to truly live peacefilled.
I:9678;1191;I found this movie to be extremely interesting.
I:9678;1192;It followed Gandhi life and his dedication to what he believed to be right.
I:9678;1193;There are so many great moments in this film.
I:9678;1194;I had a chance to visit India once and loved the country.
I:9678;1195;This classic give me a chance to see that country again and to get a better understanding on the life of Gandhi.
I:9678;1196;Winner of 8 academy awards including best picture.
I:9678;1197;A must see movie for both young and old alike.
I:9678;1198;Superlative packaging, production, directing, acting, screenplay, and story.
I:9678;1199;It demonstrated what a man of faith can do.
I:9678;1200;By being good and kind one will find that inner peace for ourselves but more importantly to set an example to others.
I:9678;1201;I have watched the movie twice and keep it in my library for further watching.
I:9678;1202;Watching Richard Attenborough's masterpiece bio.
I:9678;1203;epic is both an uplifting and draining experience.
I:9678;1204;The performance of Ben Kingsley as Gandhi is one of those rare moments in film history where an actor seems to inhabit the character so completely allowing the viewer to get a deeper personal experience of an historical character.
I:9678;1205;perfectly blending the political history with the personal story , this movie at 3 hours is an investment of time that pays dividends rarely found on a screen.
I:9678;1206;I recently watched this again after several years and was just as moved by it as when it was first released.
I:9678;1207;In Gandhi there is a an element of that but the film will stand up to time because the portrayal is historically accurate and the subject at the heart of the film is a mythical character beyond the need of a boost from the movie.
I:9678;1208;I have to say that when I first saw this movie in 1982, I liked it a fair amount.
I:9678;1209;Is it still a good movie?
I:9678;1210;But, and it is a big one, does it capture the essence of Gandhi?
I:9678;1211;Ben Kingsley becomes Ghandi in this ever inspiring movie.
I:9678;1212;Only a few movies move me as does this one.
I:9678;1213;What can you say about such a great man.
I:9678;1214;Not only that, but he succeeded in winning the struggle when the english finnally realized that their violent agression towards the Indians in exchange for their nonviolent resistance was an inhumane act.
I:9678;1215;Gandhi has shown us proof, by gaining India it's independence, that compassion can conquir corruption and right can defeat might.
I:9678;1216;Years ago I saw Gandhi in a theater and was impressed with the film then.
I:9678;1217;The acting, screenplay, and photography are all top rate.
I:9678;1218;This film is a must.
I:9678;1219;see for anyone interested in how individual leaders can be great forces for good.
I:9678;1220;having seen it many years ago.
I:9678;1221;to refresh my memory on the essence of Gandhi and his proven concept of non.
I:9678;1222;violence, love, truth, the Golden Rule.
I:9678;1223;A well crafted portrayel of the life of such an amazing man.
I:9678;1224;One of my all time favorites.
I:9678;1225;Blu Ray transfer was wonderful.
I:9678;1226;"A nice addition if you want more ""soak"" time with the historical perspectives of the movie."
I:9678;1227;attenborough, a filmmaker who can rival David Lean for the big set piece without losing a sense of human scale, presents the political events with real dramatic impact.
I:9678;1228;Still, while Attenborough's endless seas of extras testify to his ability to order crowds, his fine motion picture was seen very believable and realistic, with enough insight either into its sublimely serene hero's mind or into the complex realities of Indian history and politics.
I:9678;1229;british actor Ben Kingsley portrays the spiritual leader with deep simplicity.
I:9678;1230;Kingsley's Mahatma is amazing, so beautiful in its honesty.
I:9678;1231;Kingsley burns with a strong and purer flame, particularly in the way he ages across the five decades which the film depicts.
I:9678;1232;His wetly blazing eyes as a young lawyer in South Africa, his black hair and immense energy, gives way to the bald small modest man, in shawl, loin cloth, steel.
I:9678;1233;"kingsley takes the qualities and details instructed by Attenborough: Gandhi's fiercely intelligent aura
I:9678;1234;a distinguished cast of characters surround Academy Award.
I:9678;1235;"Gandhi has a rare combination of deep character penetration and enormous epic sweep with ""Lawrence of Arabia."""
I:9678;1236;Throughout the picture, which takes place over a half century, one has a sense of a man discovering his own unique dimensions.
I:9678;1237;Perhaps this is the secret of Attenborough's 'Gandhi,' that at the bottom of all the tumultuous action is a remarkable protagonist, an incredible individual about whom one cares, and feels attract to.
I:9678;1238;I've seen this movie several times over the years and pick up nuances each time I watch again, due to further experiences in my own life.
I:9678;1239;Epic film making and performances throughout.
I:9678;1240;Gandhi was an enlightened man, and Ben Kingsley must have been also, to channel him so brilliantly.
I:9678;1241;A long movie but definitely recommend viewing, multiple times.
I:9678;1242;This was a real, flawed, wonderful human.
I:9678;1243;this movie brings you along for a very emotional ride: fear, resolve, despair, triumph, pride.
I:9678;1244;It barely hints at those quirks, choosing wisely to stay with phenomenal integrity, intelligence, discipline, and compassion of this man.
I:9678;1245;recommended for all ages, and anyone who doesn't know Gandhi beyond the quotes.
I:9678;1246;The movie came out in 1982, but the cinematography is excellent.
I:9678;1247;After numerous arrests and the attention of the world of which he didn't care for, the government finally relents by recognizing rights for Indians, but not for the native blacks of South Africa.
I:9678;1248;Gandhi agrees, and starts a non.
I:9678;1249;cooperation campaign on a very large scale, bringing together millions of Indians nationwide.
I:9678;1250;Nevertheless, the campaign generates great attention, and Britain faces intense public pressure.
I:9678;1251;I have always admired Gandhi and since watching the movie my admiration has increased.
I:9678;1252;Ben Kingsley played the part magnificently and the love and intelligence that flows from his eyes while playing this role is epic.
I:9678;1253;Great historical portrayal by Ben Kingsley.
I:9678;1254;He is riding on a train and although he possesses a first.
I:9678;1255;class ticket he is ordered to go to third.
I:9678;1256;class because of his status as a minority.
I:9678;1257;After having some success in South Africa bringing about change he returns to India where he is greeted as a national hero.
I:9678;1258;This is one of the most intense scenes in the field as the director chose to show almost five full minutes of Indian civilians, many of them Indian women and children, being gunned down by a firing squad comprised of what appears to be Chinese or East Asian mercenary troops.
I:9678;1259;Gandhi's reaction is one of great sorrow and this event marks a turning point in the film.
I:9678;1260;in the movie the Hindu religion was depicted as a strong devotion to ones beliefs.
I:9678;1261;gandhi was a strong willed man of peaceful ways and devotion to his beliefs and religious ways.
I:9678;1262;He possessed such a strong devotion, faith filled belief in his way of life that was admiring.
I:9678;1263;This is one of the greatest movies ever made, and I love it.
I:9678;1264;Prepare to be stunned to learn the events of that day, the anniversary of the actual historical funeral.
I:9678;1265;An action packed adventure that is sure to leave you on the edge of your seat.
I:9678;1266;romance, death, adventure, action, drama, struggle, and modern effects.
I:9678;1267;and freedom without blood shed!
I:9678;1268;Ben Kingsly is outstanding as Gandhi.
I:9678;1269;If you want to be inspired, this is a movie to watch.
I:9678;1270;This is one of those films that is a must in anyone's collection.
I:9678;1271;Ben Kingsley does a great job.
I:9678;1272;This show does a great job of protraying the difficulties and successes of Gandhi.
I:9678;1273;The man lived an amazing life and had insights into life that few people ever will.
I:9678;1274;Ben Kingsly is outstanding and deserved the academy award he received for his performance.
I:9678;1275;Watching this through my IPad the sound was often not loud enough but using closed captioning helped a lot.
I:9678;1276;"attenborough's multiple Oscar winner
I:9678;1277;Ben Kingsley realistically performs as Mohandas K. Gandhi who was a man who made humility and truth more powerful than empires.
I:9678;1278;In truth, Jinnah was a brilliant man with great intellect, iron.
I:9678;1279;"will, eloquence and perseverance
I:9678;1280;Watch this movie and become a better, happier person.
I:9678;1281;When it won best picture, I was angry, I wanted that other popular one to win.
I:9678;1282;Gandhi was an incredible movie about a man who believed in world peace through nonviolence.
I:9678;1283;He had charisma that people followed to his death and I was impressed how he helped people by becoming one of them.
I:9678;1284;His nonviolent acts included marches, burning English cloth, taking multiple blows without giving one back, and making salt that is an essential substance to Indian ways of life.
I:9678;1285;all religions are powerful and beautiful in their own way.
I:9678;1286;In the movie, Gandhi states that truth and love always win in the end and that tyrants and murderers are popular for a while, but fall in the end.
I:9678;1287;This concept was proven several times because Gandhi always taught that if we love each other like a brother, then there will be world peace.
I:9678;1288;I've had the pleasure of studying Hinduism in my religion class and I've learned that it is a subtle religion that looks for the good in people and maybe we can have world peace in the future.
I:9678;1289;It is simply one of the best movies of all time in my opinion.
I:9678;1290;Ben Kingsley does an outstanding job as does everyone else.
I:9678;1291;I highly recommend this movie .
I:9678;1292;it is worth the money spent.
I:9678;1293;He is still a sacrosanct figure through much of the world, an incredible amount of history happened throughout his lifetime, but also because, as a protagonist, Gandhi went from a regular lawyer to a major figurehead of peace and Indian independence.
I:9678;1294;quite an arc to effectively show to an audience.
I:9678;1295;Throughout the film are well.
I:9678;1296;ben Kingsley is astonishing as the man.
I:9678;1297;His strength is palpable, as well as his sorrow when things do not go as he meant them to, and his teachings turn to violence.
I:9678;1298;Altogether this is an incredibly distinguished, entertaining and vital film.
I:9678;1299;See it and keep him with you.
I:9678;1300;This movie is, of course, a classic.
I:9678;1301;In one of the interviews with Ben Kingsley, he expressed great apprehensiveness and even reluctance to play Mahatma Gandhi.
I:9678;1302;Nobody can play this man, he'd stated.
I:9678;1303;Thankfully, his decision would bring one of the best and most memorable acting performances ever shown on the silver screen.
I:9678;1304;"brainer that he won the Oscar for Best Actor that year, and that ""Gandhi"" won for Best Picture."
I:9678;1305;"martin Luther King Jr once stated about Gandhi, ""I have found it challenging at times to live by the words of Jesus, but Gandhi proved it can be done."
I:9678;1306;"This beautiful autobiography of the Mahatma"" or ""Great Soul"" (a title bestowed upon him by the people of India and not by himself) demonstrates how one man conquered a nation through love and non."
I:9678;1307;"A master teacher of ALL religions, he recognized the spiritual paths of all men, and put into practice the universal teachings of peace, love, forgiveness, and brotherhood
I:9678;1308;richard Attenborough directed this magnificent story that opens with his assassination.
I:9678;1309;This was a brilliant move, on his part.
I:9678;1310;He shows how Gandhi dies, but immediately focuses on his extraordinary life.
I:9678;1311;Filmed in India with wonderful performances by both Western and Eastern performers, they collaborated together to bring this film to life.
I:9678;1312;ben Kingsley plays Gandhi in such a true and humble way.
I:9678;1313;He brings Gandhi to life and endows him with the characteristics and personality that I have read so much about.
I:9678;1314;every actor, whether they have a small part or a large one, brought their best for this film.
I:9678;1315;You can see that in their performances.
I:9678;1316;it is simply amazing how Gandhi was able to persuade the people of India into non.
I:9678;1317;"Thoreau's ""Civil Disobedience"" coincides beautifully with Gandhi's actions."
I:9678;1318;the film is over three hours in length, and every time I watch it, I feel as if I've had a spiritual experience.
I:9678;1319;One of the greatest men of our modern world who like others who followed tried to teach humanity that the way to living peacefully is not by killing others.
I:9678;1320;with a message for everyone.
I:9678;1321;Gandhi found a way to the hearts of many people with his practices and beliefs.
I:9678;1322;Once again bringing a whole country together to grieve this great man.
I:9678;1323;Mr. Mahatma Gandhi led his people and family to freedom, and it would be hard for generations to come to believe such man of this greatness walked the earth.
I:9678;1324;Throughout this trial in Mr. Gandhi's life he meets Charlie Andrews which would be an influential part in Gandhi's quest back to India.
I:9678;1325;gandhi was always willing to show courage in the hopes that a person's hatred may decrease and their respect will increase.
I:9678;1326;He lived and practiced the idea that people could live together.
I:9678;1327;Meanwhile he took it upon himself to truly discover India.
I:9678;1328;class citizens in their own country.
I:9678;1329;He felt a person wanting to convert should try to be a good follower of his own faith rather than seek goodness in change of faith.
I:9678;1330;Kinda long yet you don't even notice because you're enjoy the story line and history.
I:9678;1331;Richard Attenborough has captured the fierce determination of Gandhi in showing the world a new way of non.
I:9678;1332;At a personal level, it is a story of austerity, self sacrifice and tremendous courage against daunting odds.
I:9678;1333;There are a lot of similarities between the Martin Luther and Gandhi fights for Civil Rights.
I:9678;1334;This perseverance leads unwanted attention for the South African government, and cause them to give into his demands.
I:9678;1335;"this movie is a great educational tool it shows how imperialism of another cultural ruling another
I:9678;1336;This is one of the best movies that I've seen in years.
I:9678;1337;How wrong I was!Gandhi is a fascinating account of a true hero, a lawyer who tried to give Indians rights in South Africa in the late 1890s, and graduated to taking on the entire British Empire in his effort to free India from their rule in later years.
I:9678;1338;I always thought of Gandhi as a pacifist but in fact he used ACTIVE resistance and noncompliance, and was willing to sacrifice himself, his family and his followers for the sake of the greater good.
I:9678;1339;a sincerely noble, honorable and remarkable 20th.
I:9678;1340;Beautifully filmed and very well acted.
I:9678;1341;Really an inspiring movie that makes us shudder to realize the way that Indians were treated in their own country such a short period of time ago.
I:9678;1342;This inspiring and sober depiction of Gandhi is an epic fit for viewing.
I:9678;1343;it brings to life the man behind the robe in a way that draws me completely in to his world.
I:9678;1344;This film does a great service in beginning to introduce him to the West.
I:9678;1345;It concentrates mostly on the political events and under.
I:9678;1346;"I recommend you check out ""Gandi the Man"" by Eknath Easwaran."
I:9678;1347;This is lovely real story.
I:9678;1348;Gandhi is an exceptionally riveting movie about the last 50 years of Gandhi's life and more notably the story of overcoming adversity and racial discrimination.
I:9678;1349;These immoral acts against fellow man sparked Gandhi's lifelong journey to bring peace among all races and eventually the independence of India from British rule.
I:9678;1350;The story brings to light the personal sacrifice people are willing to make in an attempt to bring peace to a race or culture that is seen as inferior to another.
I:9678;1351;There are scenes that are similar in nature to events that took place during Martin Luther King's era and the African American's march to freedom.
I:9678;1352;After numerous arrests and the unwanted attention of the world, the British government gives in and gives right to Indians.
I:9678;1353;He agrees to help fight for freedom and starts another non.
I:9678;1354;Nevertheless, the campaign generates huge attention from all over the world the British government come under great public pressure.
I:9678;1355;Gandhi is now seen as the father of India and is greatly admired.
I:9678;1356;even though Indians are now free and able to establish their own country, they have many tasks including keeping peace between Hindus and Muslims.
I:9678;1357;This disturbed Gandhi deeply and declares he will fast until all fighting stops.
I:9678;1358;peace exists between the Muslims and Hindus and Gandhi returns to his motivated loving ways.
I:9678;1359;The only philosophy that lives on is peace and love for everyone.
I:9678;1360;This is a beautifully acted and filmed movie!!!
I:9678;1361;As profound and pertinent today as when it came out back in the 80's.
I:9678;1362;It is a classic in my opinion!!
I:9678;1363;Ghandi's life is so inspiring and profound and teaches so much if/when we are open and have the courage to live what we know to be true as he did.
I:9678;1364;Everyone will benefit by seeing this movie.
I:9678;1365;and the film, as it turns out, presents a highly edited and sanitised version of the Mahatma.
I:9678;1366;"so long as one is aware that the film ""Gandhi"" is a work of art, fiction, not history, it is worthy."
I:9678;1367;This is a slightly slowed paced, but thoroughly engaging look at the life of Gandhi.
I:9678;1368;Kingsley is masterly in this role and really makes you believe you are watching Gandhi rather that just a portrayal.
I:9678;1369;The scenery is amazing, as is the direction and although it is a little long, it is a great place to start if you're interested in learning more about this great man.
I:9678;1370;First of all, I would sincerely thank the movie making team to produce such a good movie on Mahatma Gandhi and History of India.
I:9678;1371;There are two great shortfalls of such a huge production though:.
I:9678;1372;let us live and die in peace.
I:9678;1373;Ben Kingsley turns in a wonderful performance as Gandhi, the attorney.
I:9678;1374;From the Mahatma's early days as an attorney in South Africa all the way through to his assassination, Sir Ben Kingsley portrays Gandhi with such searing intensity that I sometimes felt as if I was seeing the Mahatma himself and not the actor portraying him.
I:9678;1375;i also have to give a nod here to the wonderful cast of Indian actors who appeared in the film, but most notably to Roshan Seth, who played Pandit Nehru.
I:9678;1376;I have seen this versatile actor in several other films, but I think that he really shines as Nehru, Gandhi's friend and advisor.
I:9678;1377;This must have been an intensely personal project for someone such as Mr. Seth, who was about 5 when the Mahatma was assassinated, and he carries himself well in the role.
I:9678;1378;"Faced with armed resistance from the British government, Gandhi adopts a policy of ""passive resistance,"" endeavoring to win freedom for his people."
I:9678;1379;Also a part that moved me is an early scene in South Africa when Gandhi, long before he adopted the loincloth as his only dress, beams proudly at his small, perfectly dressed sons.
I:9678;1380;I'm so proud of them, he says.
I:9678;1381;Of overall importance is the possibility that the film will bring Gandhi to the attention of a lot of people including me around the world for the first time, not as a saint but as a self.
I:9678;1382;searching, sometimes fallible human like anyone else and that he had a sense of humor as well as a sense of history.
I:9678;1383;Gandhi won eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actor, and Best Director you know it had to be good.
I:9678;1384;GANDHI is one of the greatest films ever released in the past twenty years.
I:9678;1385;Mohandes Gandhi'sa life, from a young attorney and on through India's independence from England, is brilliantly captured, with a peformance that is still Ben Kingsley's best one ever.
I:9678;1386;He deservedly won that Oscar he got.
I:9678;1387;One thing I find remarkable about this film is it's ability to be exciting without much action, music, or dialogue.
I:9678;1388;This is a film that I believe people of every religion will enjoy.
I:9678;1389;Hey, I'm a Christian teen, and I find this film to be absolutely incredible!
I:9678;1390;This was a very well written, filmed, and acted movie.
I:9678;1391;This movie was very entertaining, while also providing a great deal of historical information at the same time.
I:9678;1392;My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, to the point that we are sure to watch it again.
I:9678;1393;Although this is a docudrama, it's still a great story of the last emperor of China, I highly recommend it.
I:9678;1394;list of great cinematic biographies.
I:9678;1395;This depiction of one of the most important political figures of the last century is not only an inspiring tale but also a dazzling and triumphant filmmaking accomplishment.
I:9678;1396;Gandhi is a mesmerizing film primarily because of Kingsley's uncanny performance.
I:9678;1397;It is eerie to see an actor so perfectly recreate a historical figure on.
I:9678;1398;Kingsley is literally perfect in his role and essentially becomes Gandhi for the duration of the picture.
I:9678;1399;He not only delivers one of the greatest performances of the Eighties but one of the greatest performances in the history of film.
I:9678;1400;The supporting cast also is wonderful with Rohini Hattangady a particular standout as Gandhi's wife.
I:9678;1401;Oftentimes a life story can become dull and dreary when chronicled on the big screen but Attenborough manages to hold your interest for the entire 188 minute running time.
I:9678;1402;That's a tribute to both the director's talent and the fascinating life that the real Gandhi led.
I:9678;1403;In this grand epic we are treated to an inside look at how a small man with great conviction and big ideas took on and defeated a superpower without ever lifting a gun.
I:9678;1404;In this superb portrayal by Ben Kingsley, Ghandi and his spirit are shared anew with those too young to have felt his impact.
I:9678;1405;the movie is historically very accurate though there are a few events out of chronological order or disputed with regard to Ghandi's views.
I:9678;1406;One of the best movies I ever saw!
I:9678;1407;An asset to anyone's film collection.
I:9678;1408;Stellar performances by both Ben Kingsley as well as Roshan Seth (who shows a remarkable resemblance to) and takes on the role of Jawaharlal Nehru.
I:9678;1409;On the long side (at three hours+), but still definitely worth watching and adding to your collection.
I:9678;1410;I never knew much of the history of Gandhi who I found to be by turn by brilliant and unorthodox.
I:9678;1411;Clearly a man of passion who made a difference.
I:9678;1412;This is a great film, classic.
I:9678;1413;I got it for my daughter to see before an upcoming trip to India.
I:9678;1414;Well done with an important message.
I:9678;1415;He decides to fight for India's independence from the British Empire.
I:9678;1416;All through his journey of teaching he has a Christian follower in which he accepts fully.
I:9678;1417;to come together and get their freedom.
I:9678;1418;This is one of the best movies in its category.
I:9678;1419;This is the true story of Ghandi and the role he played in freeing India from the British occupation.
I:9678;1420;Both picture and sound are wonderful.
I:9678;1421;i must have watched this movie 10 times already, it is that good.
I:9678;1422;The special features are excellent and there are some newsreels of Gandhi himself.
I:9678;1423;the movie is so well done that one does not feel the three hours plus of its running time.
I:9678;1424;Through the film you also see the making of the Civil Rights movement in America.
I:9678;1425;This is a classic and touching movie.
I:9678;1426;This gives a preview of what is yet to come and I guess leaves an idea of his horrible ending while watchers are viewing his life and the amazing things he did.
I:9678;1427;After this South Africa began to recognize some rights for Indians, so Gandhi returns back to India a hero.
I:9678;1428;In the last few days of his life Gandhi is still promoting peace angering people on both sides of the previous fighting and violence.
I:9678;1429;Gandhi is the prime example of a Guru which we learned is a teacher or preceptor.
I:9678;1430;This movie broadcasts the life of Gandhi, one of the most well.
I:9678;1431;summative way, but this last truly epic film, shot with not one CGI effect that simultaneously illustrates the sheer love and admiration that the life of Gandhi inspires in all of our lives, allows us to understand the aspirations of everysingle on of the extras who stood, walked and cheered in the homogenized blobs of the crowds that are as characteristic of India at that time as the portrayal that the great Sir Ben Kingsley manages to pull off.
I:9678;1432;Beautifully shot and wonderful storytelling.
I:9678;1433;Excellent for opening the minds of those who are absolutely clueless and are not necessarily taught about choice and responsibility at home.
I:9678;1434;I am very pleased with the product and service and will order again.
I:9678;1435;It's long but definitely captures a lot of India's history.
I:9678;1436;For as old as this movie is, it's still a great movie to watch today.
I:9678;1437;After numerous arrests and the unwanted attention of the world, the government finally relents by recognizing rights for Indians, though not for the native blacks of South Africa.
I:9678;1438;He is urged to take up the fight for India's independence from the British Empire.
I:9678;1439;Gandhi agrees, and mounts a non.
I:9678;1440;Nevertheless, the campaign generates great attention, and Britain faces intense public pressure.
I:9678;1441;Without a doubt, Gandhi has to be one of the most momentous and poignant movies ever made.
I:9678;1442;Based on a true story, this powerful 1982 depiction, directed and produced by Richard Attenborough, recaps the life of Mohandas K. Gandhi (1869.1948), who arguably becomes one of the most remarkable and influential human beings ever to walk the earth.
I:9678;1443;A haunting tale to say the least, the story gives insight to what life was like in India during the harsh and violent rule of the British empire.
I:9678;1444;Though he suffers greatly at the hands of his tormentors, and of his own free will, Gandhi holds firm to his beliefs and spreads a message of love and peace to everyone who will listen.
I:9678;1445;"In his words, ""The way of truth and love always wins."
I:9678;1446;The movie has strong ties to Hinduism and gives an inside glimpse at life as a Hindu.
I:9678;1447;"One of its philosophical beliefs becomes a main theme throughout the movie, ""the way to God is to free yourself of possessions and passions."""
I:9678;1448;His infinite wisdom and divine strength serve to educate, persuade, and unite.
I:9678;1449;beautifully written by John Briley, Ben Kingsley delivers the performance of a lifetime.
I:9678;1450;Every adult, young and old, should be required to see this inspiring story of love and courage and by action, the very definition of greatness.
I:9678;1451;This one will be a classic for all times!IMDb.
I:9678;1452;The acting and cast are superb and the content well thought out and factual.
I:9678;1453;GANDHI is by far the most inspiring movie I have ever seen.
I:9678;1454;It will move you and change your opinion of the world.
I:9678;1455;It all began simple enough .
I:9678;1456;Shortly thereafter, and after consultations with established members of his community, he wrote his first treatises and organized his first demonstrations.
I:9678;1457;Shot largely on four Indian locations, Richard Attenborough's nine.
I:9678;1458;Even anticipating that he might be killed by an assassin's bullet, Gandhi once said that he would only deserve that title if he could accept that bullet with Rama's (God's) name on his lips: fittingly, the movie begins with his assassination and comes full circle at the end, affirming that Gandhi truly was a Great Soul throughout.
I:9678;1459;together, thus instantly convincing him that he had found his man.
I:9678;1460;The use of the actual British newsreels covering Gandhi's visit to England adds to the movie's sense of authenticity .
I:9678;1461;and emphasizes yet again Ben Kingsley's achievement in transforming himself into the Mahatma.
I:9678;1462;Yet, this movie eloquently pleads that it is, at least, worth our very best effort.
I:9678;1463;The movie tells a good story of his life, in the time allotted.
I:9678;1464;Watch it, it will make you question your ways just as Gandhi made the British question theirs many years ago.
I:9678;1465;This film, the fruition of Richard Attenborough's decades.
I:9678;1466;Otherwise, the events are deftly and fairly.
I:9678;1467;The Amritsar massacre is the most chilling such movie scene I've ever witnessed.
I:9678;1468;everything about the production of the film is great.
I:9678;1469;The lighting is warm and golden outside, with rich earthtones inside.
I:9678;1470;forgive the cliche, but _Gandhi_ is a triumph of the film.
I:9678;1471;maker's art, as Attenborough displays all his chops in paying this loving tribute to the Mahatma.
I:9678;1472;A master's masterpiece, if there ever was one.
I:9678;1473;i understand that we all have our own personal opinion, but earlier in the reviews someone likened Mahatma Gandhi, nonviolent peace and freedom fighter, to an anorexic Paris Hilton.
I:9678;1474;Freedom for the entire Indian subcontinent!
I:9678;1475;This is a great film.
I:9678;1476;"Everything about it is good
I:9678;1477;It's one of those movies with beautiful scenery and worth the better image.
I:9678;1478;His influence over people was amazing.
I:9678;1479;After achieving his goal he went to India and acomplished the most amazing things.
I:9678;1480;He walked in the shoes of the rich, and also lived in the clothes of the poor.
I:9678;1481;This film, while overlooked by critics, deserves to be recognized as one of the greatest epics and biographies of all time.
I:9678;1482;+ time, this movie will keep you interested and deeply involved.
I:9678;1483;The portrayal of Gandhi was done beautifully by Kingsley, who gave this epic a base for acting.
I:9678;1484;"Perhaps no historical document on film has such a profound modern political impact as ""Gandhi""."
I:9678;1485;"Directed by Sir Richard Attenborough, and permitted by the government of India, ""Gandhi"" is singularized by the brilliant performance of Sir Ben Kingsley."
I:9678;1486;Indeed, one of the great film acting performances of all time.
I:9678;1487;we begin the film journey, for indeed this is quite the epic running over three hours long, in a train car as young Gandhi is headed to South Africa.
I:9678;1488;the second of which is a demonstration at a Salt Factory, .
I:9678;1489;gandhi is a triumphant picture, which preaches the power of the human spirit and the ability of non.
I:9678;1490;Anchored by the brilliant performance of Kingsley, and with the assistance of two American icons in great supporting performances, Martin Sheen and Candice Bergman, as well as the two British legends Sir John Gielgud and Sir Johnny Mills, Gandhi is a feast of the human soul and a wonderful film for dreamers idealists, and lovers of good cinema.
I:9678;1491;Gandhi is a beautifully written movie about the life and works of Mohandas K. Gandhi (called Mohatma Gandhi).
I:9678;1492;gandhi's success in South Africa led to him being asked to lead a revolution for the independence of India from British law.
I:9678;1493;He was successful in recruiting most of India to join him in his battle.
I:9678;1494;He was a well loved and respected man that was able to reach many.
I:9678;1495;This campaign met with success as well as some defeats.
I:9678;1496;Ultimately, the campaign was successful as India received its' independence from Britain.
I:9678;1497;What a powerful and true statement and a great way to end a great movie.
I:9678;1498;Hindu's believe that all should be regarded as important and be loved, and that the way to bliss is to let go of your desire for possessions and passions.
I:9678;1499;This is portrayed beautifully by the life of Gandhi and is even spoken by his wife in the movie.
I:9678;1500;Richard Attenborough's epic film of the life of the man whose policy of active passive resistance against the British helped lead India to gain its independence is a big epic in the grand tradition, beautifully crafted and stands alone in his canon as a director in that it has a genuine sense of vision.
I:9678;1501;aside from its beautifully framed Scope composition, it is full of striking visual moments from waves of protesters passively lining up to be beaten in a 'raid' on a salt factory to the shot of the solitary Gandhi standing at the well in Amritsar after a massacre there.
I:9678;1502;The crowd scenes are plentiful and truly massive and on a scale we are unlikely to ever see again, yet the focus is always on the man and what he stood for.
I:9678;1503;Much of the credit for this goes to John Briley's excellent screenplay.
I:9678;1504;Well constructed and filled with memorable scenes, it condenses an extraordinary life with clarity and pace and avoiding the pitiful cliche of Chaplin.
I:9678;1505;kingsley's performance is one of the miracles of epic cinema, a performance large enough to hold its own against thousands of extras but layered enough to make Gandhi a credibly human figure.
I:9678;1506;This gives the film the real sense of a journey through Gandhi's life, from his initial vanity and failures as a public speaker to a man who became the spiritual leader of his country with charisma, wisdom and wit.
I:9678;1507;"The really impressive work is to be found further down the credits
I:9678;1508;And for once these really are supporting roles, adding to the portrait of the central character rather than detracting from it with scene.
I:9678;1509;despite the critical backlash it suffered (not helped by Kingsley's recent, significantly less than humble behavior), it is an impressive, sometimes moving film that was worth the price of admission in the cinema and is worth adding to your collection.
I:9678;1510;All passion seemingly spent, Attenborough wouldn't make another halfway decent film until Shadowlands more than a decade later, but Gandhi is something of a masterpiece.
I:9678;1511;What can be done is to be faithful in spirit to the record and try to find one's way to the heart of the man.
I:9678;1512;Preface to the filmGandhi, filmed in 1982 and directed by Richard Attenborough, was a biography film that portrays the dreams and beliefs of a single man so well.
I:9678;1513;The inspiring film started out with a young man, Gandhi, sitting in a first class train car for which he had the ticket to.
I:9678;1514;This film did a great job portraying the events that took place in Gandhi's pursuit towards and independent India and does a good job of having them displayed in chronilogical order over decades of time.
I:9678;1515;Gandhi is a film that brings a deep message to the people that view it.
I:9678;1516;His words and actions displayed the message throughout his long life.
I:9678;1517;GandhiThis was a very educational movie.
I:9678;1518;Gandhi was a very brave and intelligent man.
I:9678;1519;He believed they should be able to control their own country.
I:9678;1520;Gandhi believed in freeing yourself from all possessions and passions so that you can get closer to God.
I:9678;1521;Once the fighting stopped, Gandhi started eating and got physically better.
I:9678;1522;The work of Ghandi was world.
I:9678;1523;"changing
I:9678;1524;Then, it does an excellent job of showing us how beautiful this man's heart was toward his fellow man.
I:9678;1525;There is no better documentary about a man's life and growth than this film.
I:9678;1526;This classic film is picture perfect in glorious Blu.
I:9678;1527;Colors dance and the images are sharp.
I:9678;1528;Ben Kingsly did a remarkable job portraying Gandhi and dissolves himself into the character.
I:9678;1529;This true story of one of the most remarkable men to ever walk the earth remains as poignant today as it did when it first was released.
I:9678;1530;A superb movie, it offers a bird's eye view on India's war for Independence, a glimpse of forgotten greats in the war like Gokhale (shown here as Gandhi's mentor), Tilak, Sardar Patel, Kriplani and many more.
I:9678;1531;his life is a message.
I:9678;1532;message of love, peace, acceptance, tolerance, and finally it tells us that you should fight out of love for something and not because of hatred towards others.
I:9678;1533;strictly, only a handful number of people led such an accomplished and complete life.
I:9678;1534;as for the movie, it is very touching and a definitely inspires us.
I:9678;1535;And in the present times when there is more and more injustice(under the cover of good), this should truly help those faintly lit souls standing in the hope of a society filled with justice, love, and peace.
I:9678;1536;Well made, awesome person to portray, we need to see more movies that inspire us I honestly think a movie like this has such a small audience.
I:9678;1537;yes anyone would enjoy seeing this great movie.
I:9678;1538;This is my nth time watching this movie and as usual so inspiring and awesome!
I:9678;1539;Great movie every made about great personality ever lived.
I:9678;1540;It's a glancing account, directed with a stately hand, set against the last gasp of the British Raj.
I:9678;1541;Attenborough recounts the religious and political conflicts that preceded and followed it, opening and closing with the assassination of the founder of non.
I:9678;1542;David Lean, who directed truly great epics and was alive at the time, doubtless felt the snake had struck.
I:9678;1543;It has unknown Indian actors in major roles and uses famous non.
I:9678;1544;indians in small ones, some of them just bits (the young Daniel Day Lewis).
I:9678;1545;winner Ben Kingsley is as good a Gandhi as we're likely to get.
I:9678;1546;But the ersatz epic he's in, which also won an Oscar, is rarely seen today.
I:9678;1547;Too much homework is required of us.
I:9678;1548;i recommend this movie to any breathing, living person on this planet.
I:9678;1549;This movie not only perfectly captured the life of Gandhi, but it also captured the horrors of ethinic conflict and war.
I:9678;1550;Any movie that jolts me with this much emotion I will love.
I:9678;1551;I believe that is what makes a great movie.
I:9678;1552;It really captures you as if you are a fish, but you do not die and become dinner.
I:9678;1553;That is exactly how I felt.
I:9678;1554;And because of that, I would really consider this one of the best movies ever made.
I:9678;1555;the acting was not alone as one of the best things about this movie.
I:9678;1556;His transition from an unknown individual to a strong.
I:9678;1557;That is all I have to say.
I:9678;1558;And if you have to, make some coffee.
I:9678;1559;You really need to keep your eyes and your hearts open.
I:9678;1560;bottom Line: By far one of the greatest movies ever made.
I:9678;1561;The casting is terrific, scenery is spectacular and the depiction of Gandhi as a great leader and a human being is superb, it deserved to win all of the Oscars it did.
I:9678;1562;I consider Mahatma one of the world's greatest peacemakers of all time.
I:9678;1563;A spiritual man that was willing to do everything and anything for injustice without the use of violence.
I:9678;1564;Ben Kingsley's portrayal of Mahatma Gandhi is nothing short of remarkable.
I:9678;1565;But it really impressed me especially Ben Kingsley's acting.
I:9678;1566;He made a superb Gandhi.
I:9678;1567;The on location photography was spectacular.
I:9678;1568;This has to be one of the best films ever made period!
I:9678;1569;I loved this movie the first time I saw it at the theatre (in 1982) and I just recently saw it again and still love it!
I:9678;1570;What an amazing film about the life of Ghandi.
I:9678;1571;What a truly moving movie this was.
I:9678;1572;This movie addresses some of the injustices of this world and even though it was specific to events that took place in South Africa and India several decades ago, the subject matter is still relevant today in many areas of this world.
I:9678;1573;This movie should be required viewing for all the people of earth.
I:9678;1574;Good documentary about a truly amazing person.
I:9678;1575;They did a nice job telling this story in a way that captivates the audience.
I:9678;1576;also, the extras in this film are truly phenomenal.
I:9678;1577;India is the world's largest democracy, and 2nd most populous country.
I:9678;1578;India's greatest human, Mohandas Gandhi, of the last couple of hundred years or so is a most noble subject.
I:9678;1579;This film wonderfully shows Gandhi's unimaginably unflinching pacificsm and social disobedience which bought India's freedom from the cruel British rule, and it necessarily shows the vast human cost that India paid to gain its rightful independence.
I:9678;1580;time Academy Award winner are Ben Kingsley's Oscar.
I:9678;1581;"winning performance as Gandhi, himself, the wonderful acting jobs of Roshan Seth (""Mississippi Masala"", ""Monsoon Wedding"" ."
I:9678;1582;Gandhi, the 1982 best movie, best director, and best actor of the year is about the life of Mohandas Gandhi and his quest to bring nonviolent resistance to the country of India.
I:9678;1583;This is where the simple young lawyer turns to a life of peaceful, nonviolent protests and eventually one of the world's greatest political leaders of all time.
I:9678;1584;He led marches, demonstrations, along with protests all of which brought worldwide attention to the plight of violence of India by the British government.
I:9678;1585;grandi fight for the people of India and ended the suffering nation He is so powerful that millions of people support him .
I:9678;1586;He believes in peace and will fight everything in his power to bring peace to his land.
I:9678;1587;He will fight all he can to fight the British army to restore peace in his country.
I:9678;1588;Such a legion will always be remembered from generation to generation and nation worship him.
I:9678;1589;What can be done is to be faithful in spirit to the record and to try to find one's way to the heart of the man.The Film of Gandhi is one that was very inspirational to all though who believe in true peace.
I:9678;1590;Gandhi was a man of virtue and loved everyone, and believed everyone should do the same.
I:9678;1591;This event and the sadness of Gandhi creates a turning point in the film.
I:9678;1592;violent actions and how powerful they really can be.
I:9678;1593;Gandhi is a perfect example of perfect peace and he idea of been completely drawn to uniting with his lord.
I:9678;1594;Richard Attenborough was clearly a driving force, a superb filmmaker who spent decades crafting and refining this movie.
I:9678;1595;But the greatest credit clearly goes to Gandhi himself, whose meditations upon Hindi and Christian and Islamic principles crafted a philosophy of non.
I:9678;1596;when you bring talent like Kingsley's and Attenborough's together with the content of Gandhi's life, you cannot help but have a masterpiece.
I:9678;1597;Beyond his visual resemblance to Gandhi, the physical movements, the subtle tonal inflections, and beyond the incredible range of emotion and passion Kingsley brings to the screen, his portrayal of Gandhi through 5 distinct phases in his life are what make his performance monumental.
I:9678;1598;we start with Gandhi a young man, mid 20's, working as a lawyer in South Africa.
I:9678;1599;As the film progress in South Africa, we see Gandhi become a strong leader, with the principles of non.
I:9678;1600;Here the young Gandhi is a man of outward passion.
I:9678;1601;gandhi accomplishes his goals in South Africa and returns to India.
I:9678;1602;He gives his first powerful speech to Congress, chastising them for not understanding the plight of the masses.
I:9678;1603;He begins his last fast, a fast with conviction in his principles that reverberate throughout India and Pakistan.
I:9678;1604;He is simply God's messenger, bringing His Way.
I:9678;1605;Kingsley portrays these transformations subtly and convincingly, so that we are lost in the story of the man, forgetting we are watching the portrayal of a man.
I:9678;1606;That is what makes this movie so great, and Kingsley's performance the greatest of all.
I:9678;1607;Born to be a classic!
I:9678;1608;GANDHI is an amazing look into a seemingly ordinary person's life.
I:9678;1609;Yet, when you hear and see of his travels and thoughts, you realize he isn't ordinary because he does extraordinary things.
I:9678;1610;The great thing is how insightful and close this movie brings you to Gandhi's daily life and Ben Kigsley's emotions that he gives to his character bring you close to the pain Gandhi must have gone through.
