1;Even a doctor is in the family, and we don't see him as successful.
2;The only love and attention they get is from a daughter.
3;Also, while many of Criterion's film releases are in black and white, the English subtitles often pose a challenge to read.
4;but with Criterion, you get great features, sometimes great commentary, documentaries, deleted scenes, interviews, and more!
5;In Tokyo Story double disc, the commentary is excellent as it follows the movie.
6;We see and learn a great deal about Ozua and his film style from this commentary that is exclusive to the movie.
7;a 40 minute tribute to Ozu is included along with a two.
8;hour documentary on Ozu provides detailed information about the director and his style.
9;What's also great is that you get a snippet of many of his other films and his low angle camera style.
10;The Japanese characters always getting up and down from the floor, and are leaving and entering frames and you soon notice it to be unique filming.
11;watching Tokyo Story has it's demands, many Japanese characters are introduced, so you must pay attention to know the characters' names and their relationships, while reading.
12;film critics love to get intellectual about very simple things .
13;They love this film .
14;Watch it and see something you've missed .
15;the film is unsettling as it reminds us all of what's coming eventually .
16;If Late Spring is the movie Ozu really started to assure himself of the style and thematic focus of his future movies, Tokyo Story is his crowning achievement, it has all, the family relationship, the train, the solitude, the lament of time passing and eventuality of death.
17;superimposed with a background of a larger city in transition, I think this is his best movie, it told all the stories he ever wanted to tell before or after.
18;I agree with the positive reviewers who have taken such great and personal pleasure in this movie.
19;here instead we are in a world more like a Jane Austen novel, focused on a few isolated characters and how they interact with each other.
20;The restraint of their emotions and the style of the film is what makes the viewer's increasing emotional awareness so much more powerful.
21;His films are not as widely accepted as another great Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa.
22;Which is exactly why the American public has embraced his films.
23;All I want to say is Tokyo Story is a beautiful ( and I never use that word to describe a film!)
24;warm, and highly emotional film.
25;Anyone with a heart should be able to feel for the characters in this film.
26;While, yes some of those films are good, none of them really seem as sincere as this movie.
27;It really hits you at a gut level.
28;It takes a stranger to show them a good time.
29;Ozu loved making films about topics we all can relate to.
30;He dealt with things everyone can relate too.
31;It is for this reason this movie will please not only fans of Ozu, who've come to know what to expect from him, but non fans will find something enjoyable about this movie.
32;This is a slow, tender, warm, and touching movie.
33;Everyone has to try and make an effort to see this film!
34;You'll thank me in the end.
35;Continually voted into the Sight and Sound poll as one of the top 10 films ever made, Tokyo Story is a great introduction to Ozu's work, and Japanese cinema entirely.
36;Even though Ozu is labeled as the most Japanese director, the themes in Tokyo Story are universal.
37;Age doesn't matter either
38;All of these factors contribute to the greatness of the film, a film that we can learn a lot from, and one that we can return to every couple of years.
39;criterion did a great job with the film.
40;The film looks better than the VHS version, and the subtitles are easier to read.
41;The commentary is informative (You'll learn a lot about Ozu's meticulous planning in each scene), and the extras, such as a 2 hour documentary on Ozu's life and work, will only result in you wanting to see all of his films.
42;A lot of my friends had told me this film was exceptional.
43;In fact, most of them consider it one of the best films they have ever seen.
44;In fact, I often compared this film to Akira Kurosawa's own `Ikiru' (which was released the year prior) while watching it and I must admit I find Kurosawa's masterpiece a little more focused and moving.
45;That said, `Tokyo Monogatari' is a stunning film and one that should be seen and experienced by any and all lovers of film.
46;one of the most beautiful things about `Tokyo Monogatari' is the subtlety with which it is constructed.
47;The character is so rich and open to a varying amount of internal and external flavor, and yet there is a blandness that carries itself throughout the performance.
48;Outside of that, the performances here are all rather spectacular, especially Setsuko Hara who gives Noriko such a beautiful light.
49;i know it seems like I pointed out the films `faults' (as I see them) but honestly, the film is still rather remarkable and certainly worthy of all the five.
50;star reviews it has received.
51;As a reflective emotional piece, the film is layered with very profound and provoking themes that burrow deep into the minds and hearts of the audience.
52;As a story, this film nails every aspect of a GREAT story, and as an artistic piece it also seems to soar.
53;I recommend this film without hesitation.
54;For me, family relationships are definitely the most complicated and certainly the hardest to truly identify, cultivate and maintain.
55;I can honestly say that Tokyo Story is one of the saddest and most poignant movies ever made.
56;It is also a cinematic masterpiece of framing, editing, and pacing.
57;The acting is so real and brilliant, that, when coupled with Ozu's signature POV angles, you feel as if you are witnessing real people and real events.
58;This is a story that we can all relate to, even if we do not want to.
59;The premise is very, very simple: an elderly couple visits their grown up children who live in Tokyo.
60;son, and, to a lesser extent, their first daughter's husband.
61;tokyo Story is one of those films, like Kurosawa'sRashomonand Hitchcock'sVertigo, that are nearly perfect in every manner.
62;Again, this gives an almost fly.
63;there is little music in Tokyo Story, but when there is music it is well.
64;Like Haneke after him, Ozu chooses instead to rely on his extraordinarily talented actors, immaculate framing, and a perfect sense of timing to make a point and elicit emotions.
65;placed, contemplative second of silence is worth more than all the music in the world.Yasujiro Ozu's actor's are more than ready for the job.
66;The great star from the Golden Age of Japanese cinema .
67;The rest of the cast is beyond criticism
68;Shiro Osaka as Keizo has a small role, but performed admirably as the prodigal son who may just be the most loyal of all the children.
69;He plays a sympathetic, caring, world.
70;weary old man, one of the most touching and tragic characters in cinematic history.
71;i guarantee you he will break your heart with his haunting gaze near the end of the film.
72;Foreign cinema is so often overlooked, but in my opinion, Ryu gives one of the greatest performances in a tragic film role ever.
73;And his performances is all the more brilliant when he does nothing at all.Yasujiro Ozu's Tokyo Story is one of the finest, saddest films ever made.
74;It is Ozu's magnum opus, a socially relevant look on family values, love, loss, and old age.
75;Tokyo Story is that rare film for the contemplative viewer
76;If this review was helpful to you, give it a like and read my other reviews, many of which are on classic films.
77;I preferred the accessible, recognizable humor of 'Storys' companion picture on my first Ozu double bill, 'Ohayo,' and it was years before I had an opportunity to see 'Tokyo Story' again.
78;Each and every gesture in this picture is carefully calculated and carefully laid out, yet the emotion begins to peak at it's own pace, it's own uncanny rhythm.
79;The 'tricks' that I considered so important to move a movie forward were exposed as just what they were, 'tricks,' and the logic of Ozu's universe was making itself known to me.
80;This is a good place to start.
81;This movie has tremendous power because it deals with fundamental laws of life and death, portrayed with stark simplicity.
82;Unforgettable performances, crowned by Setsuko Hara's haunting portrayal of a still.
83;This supremely affecting work of cinematic art easily transcends its time and place.
84;the movie stars two beautiful and talented actress,setsuko hara and kyoko kagawa.
85;i enjoyed the scene in the end between setsuko hara and the father in law,she confesses her feelings on her deceased husband,also the scene between setsuko and kyoko kagawa about life.
86;the scene where noriko(setsuko hara) tells the father in law how seflish she's been and starts to cry,I thought to myself,why on earth would someone want to make a women like that shead tears?yeah,it's a movie but setsuko hara is the ideal women too me and just mesmerizing,you get the picture.
87;overall wonderful movie viewed it a couple times already.
88;An elderly couple go to Tokyo by train on a rare visit to their children
89;what makes this a truly great movie is the subtlety of all the action: the children aren't blatantly mean, just wrapped up in their own lives and self.
90;Though subtly executed, it's an acute indictment against not only ungrateful children but against indifference in general, and it will be a rare viewer, I think, who doesn't feel the pangs of that reproach personally.
91;The dignity and grace of the elderly couple (played brilliantly by Chishu Ryu and Chieko Higashiyama) through all this is magnificently displayed .
92;and it's heartbreaking to watch.
93;Their children are an obvious disappointment to them, yet they treat them with dignity and respect .
94;this is a realist film.
95;Setsuko Hara is the most positive and conservative character in Ozu's films.
96;The movie unfolds in a very deliberate and subtle manner.
97;Still, life must go on
98;David Desser's illuminating audio commentary opens the film up in new ways, allowing the viewer to understand Ozu's deceptively simple style with greater depth and appreciation.
99;What may seem rather ordinary at first sudddenly becomes breathtaking and you'll marvel at Ozu's sheer economy of storytelling.
100;Truly, Tokyo Story is a thing of beauty and this disc will show you why.
101;One of Criterion's finest disc sets, and that's saying alot.
102;There are many roads to greatness.
103;This is a notion that I have always held to be true.
104;Yet, despite their differences, their greatest films are indisputable masterpieces of cinema, even if they achieve their ends in seemingly contradictory ways.
105;it is true, that nothing much of `excitement' happens in the film.
106;Some have seen the film as a remake of Leo McCarey's 1937 Hollywood sudser, Make Way For Tomorrow, but Tokyo Story is to that film what Long Day's Journey Into Night is to The Bold and The Beautiful.
107;There, the old couple see the town, are shunted aside, then return home.
108;ozu is the master of narrative ellipses.
109;They are simply caring and selfish, as most people are to a certain degree.
110;tokyo Story is a great film, all the way around, but it was ignored for many years until it was re.
111;Twenty years later, in the 1992 Sight And Sound film critics poll, Tokyo Story was ranked as one of the ten greatest films ever made.
112;That the film so perfectly captured all the Japanese conventions of the era, yet still resonates with worldwide audiences, is the mark of a great work of art, and a testament to the great circularly narrative screenplay by Ozu and Kgo Noda, which deftly interweaves symbolism, such as train tracks and laundry, while capturing the way real people talk and react.
113;The character building is superb, and the very relaxed and slow pace of the film shows what such a style can do.
114;the contrast in clothing styles represents more than just comfort vs. convention, for Japan was undergoing a rapid transformation from a tradition.
115;The old couple enjoy the hot baths and the scenery, but at night when they try to sleep they are kept awake by the singing and partying of other guests at the inn.
116;Shukichi remarks resignedly: This is a place for the younger generation.
117;heart talk with her son's widow Noriko, who treats her better than her own children do.
118;It is easy to understand her enormous popularity with Japanese filmgoers.
119;There is a sense of fatalism: a generation swept up by postwar modernization and the transformation of Japanese society finds itself unable to maintain a grasp on tradition.
120;this simple tale is handled with extraordinary delicacy.
121;Two of the director's favorite actors, Chishu Ryu and actress Setsuko Hara, deliver eloquent performances that are not in the least maudlin.
122;shot in black and white in Ozu's distinctive, almost minimalist cinematographic style, Tokyo Story captures the postwar zeitgeist of a nation caught inexorably in the throes of change.
123;It is among Ozu's finest films, and a fine introduction to the art of this master of Japanese classical cinema.
124;Fifty years after this film's release and 100 years after Ozu's birth, audiences in America can now (re)discover this masterpiece.
125;focus on human lives that Ozu employs is strangely moving.
126;Within a minimalist frame, Ozu paints his characters richly.
127;I think this film will move the viewer towards courtesy, kindness and compassion.
128;This film is simply gorgeous.
129;No words can describe its artistic value, its importance and impact that it can have on a human being, and its ability to transcend not only film genres, but also race, culture, and ethnicity.
130;The film is mandatory viewing for any human being.
131;It may not only be the greatest film ever made
132;This is not hype, this film is awe.
133;To appreciate this movie, keep in mind while watching it that traditional Japanese behavior is to restrict expressing your own opinion.
134;Because of this, you must pay really close attention to the words and actions of others to discover how they are really feeling.
135;Try to put yourself into the shoes of each person in this film, and you will feel enlightened when the movie is over.
136;this movie is about a kind old couple who take a trip to visit their grown children in a big city across the country.
137;The movie is really about priorities (culture and peace of mind versus your own self.
138;A classic love story that will never grow old.
139;Sensitive, yet strong in how family dynamics can evolve.
140;The essence of love is truly protrayed in this film which generates in the heart and touches it deeply.
141;Ozu's 1953 Tokyo Story is about as perfect as any film ever made.
142;It's a veritable masterpiece of cinema.
143;there's too many reasons why this film is so wonderful for me to go into here.
144;Others are more up to the task of explaining its many little touches and charms.
145;I will only say that this is a wonderfully warm, human, touching story filmed as good as any movie ever made.
146;Perhaps this is the best print to have survived?
147;There's a great commentary track to listen to as well, and with all of Ozu's films I would strongly suggest listening to the commentaries to fully understand and appreciate the brilliant film methods of Ozu the master.
148;The characters are so real and so complex, just like we are.
149;The story is always believable and never over.
150;That is the mark of a brilliant film.
151;I think this movie is amazing for reasons I was not expecting.
152;This one, however, is a subtly observed family drama set in post.
153;wWII Japan, and it is the quietude and lack of pretense of Ozu's filmmaking style that makes this among the most moving of films.
154;sounding storyline, fraught with soap opera possibilities, Ozu has fashioned a heartfelt and ultimately ironic film that focuses on the details in people's lives rather than a single dramatic situation.
155;What fascinates me about Ozu's idiosyncratic style is how he relies on insinuation to carry his story forward.
156;It adds significantly to the humanity he evokes.
157;I just love the performances, as they have a neo.
158;realism that makes them all the more affecting.
159;Chishu Ryu and Chieko Higashiyama are wonderfully authentic as Shukishi and Tomi, perfectly conveying the resignation they feel about their lives and their children without slipping into cheap sentimentality.
160;Higashiyama effortlessly displays the sunny demeanor of a grandmother, so when sadness does take over in her life, it becomes all the more haunting.
161;in particular, she has a beautiful scene where Tomi looks forlornly at her grandchild wondering what he will be when he grows up and whether she will live to see what happens.
162;The closest the film has to a villain is Shige, portrayed fearlessly by Haruko Sugimura, who is able to show respect, pettiness and conniving in a realistically mercurial fashion.
163;displays the right amount of indifference as Koichi, and Kyoko Kagawa has a few sharp lines toward the end of the film as the disappointed Kyoko.
164;however, the best performance comes from the legendary Setsuko Hara, a luminous actress whose beauty and sensitivity remind me of Olivia de Havilland during the same era.
165;As Noriko, she is breathtaking in showing her character's modesty, her unforced generosity in spite of her downscale status and her constant smile as a mask for her pain.
166;She has a number of deeply affecting moments, for instance, when Noriko explains to Shukishi and Tomi how she misses her husband, even though it is implied he was a brutalizing alcoholic
167;On the second disc, there are two excellent documentaries.
168;hour feature focused on Ozu's life and career, and the second is a 40.
169;minute tribute from several international movie directors.
170;Citizen Kane is a great film, with a camera that darts and flies, moves and runs.
171;The acting is superb and the writing completly real and truthful.
172;This is a treasure to be mined again and again.
173;Aside from the notable cinematic expression of the camera work that Ozu was known for in his films
174;Yes, the film gives the viewer the simple life of a family.
175;Here we see a family that must come to turns with what we must all inevitably face in our own lives: The death of a loved one.
176;Another Ozu regular: the beautiful Noriko, (Setsuko Hara) portrays the widowed daughter.
177;And it is Noriko who treats the elder Hirayama's with more compassion and love than their own children.
178;And this is what makes this film so great.
179;We are given a snapshot of life, and yet the way Ozu is able to present the film makes the film much more profound and poignant than any American film.
180;out with a happy ending.
181;it is a film that will move you deeply and emotionally.
182;The film is both profound and sad.
183;This film is often referred to as a film about generational conflicts which in itself are universal and timeless.
184;More importantly however, is that Tokyo Story allows us look at our own lives, and see our we relate to our loved ones here and now.
185;I highly recommend this great film to everyone.
186;Tokyo Story (1953) by Yasujiro Ozu is about the serene acceptance of the transience of life through a contemplative, compassionate love of the now.
187;Ozu is widely seen by critics worldwide as one of the great Japanese directors along with Kurosawa and Mizoguchi, and this film as his greatest among the 54 films that he made from 1927 to his 1962An Autumn Afternoon .
188;David Desser has edited a wonderful collection of essays aboutOzu's Tokyo Story (Cambridge Film Handbooks), and Paul Schrader's 1972Transcendental Style In Film (Da Capo Paperback)about Ozu, Robert Bresson, and Carl Dreyer continues to show us the value of a contemplative transcendental style of filmmaking that is all too rarely seen in films of today.
189;Tokyo Story is my 2nd favorite film after Kurosawa'sIkiru .
190;A much better Japanese movie from that era was this one about the Hiroshima atomic bomb.
191;As with every great work, the film has its own unique perfection in style, rhythm, details, and artist's vision .
192;but Tokyo Story is very universal in its appeal .
193;It was made 50 years ago in Japan, about people who lived far away, but it is also about all of us, our families, our problems, our guilt and our search for love and meaning.
194;It brings smiles because it is a comedy (for at least the first 2/3) and sadness with a high drama of the last 1/3 of the film.Yasujiro Ozu's quiet and deceptively simple film tells a story of an elderly couple who travel to Tokyo to see their grown up children and their families .
195;law is the one who is really happy with their arrival and tries to make their visit pleasurable.
196;Now it is their turn to make a journey.
197;The simple family melodrama has been told with intensity, humanity, and honesty of character.
198;This is one of the best.
199;I have seen it twice in the last week and will watch it again and again.
200;This beautifully and slowly paced movie allows us to savor the wonderful performances and scenery.
201;Ozu is truly the master.
202;I was told that it's a classic, and while I was respectful in my opinion about it, I never really got it.
203;Having aged a bit, and opening my eyes even more to the world, I saw this film again, and then it hit me on how powerful, sad, and truthful it really is.
204;It's done with so much real emotion, sadness, and subtlety that it doesn't really hit you until the film is over.
205;Even thinking about it now makes me sad because it's filled with truth, that truth you know exists and can't get away from.
206;Ozu was as great as any of the auteurs, like Kurosawa and Mizoguchi.
207;I was very moved by this story.
208;Nothing equals seeing the intelligent, beautiful face of Setsuko Hara as the kind heroine.
209;It almost restores one's childhood faith in the future of humanity!
210;First at all, I should remark this is a milestone film in the history of cinema, and according the British Film Institute one of the five greatest films ever made.
211;the poetic intensity of this overpowering movie transcends by far any egregious epithet.
212;A deeply, poignant and touching drama about an elderly couple who travels to Tokyo, where they are unenthusiastically received by his children.
213;but it's such the narrative power and the unforgettable shots along this masterpiece, that you will be engaged from start to finish.
214;i politely invite you to acquire this memorable masterwork, and once you have watched you will necessarily include among the milestone films ever seen through your existence.
215;the cast, the emotive and tender scenes ( the grandmother and her unworried grandson picking up flowers, is a true landmark sequence) , the multiple issues around a new generation with lack of personality, enthusiasm permeated by an absolute indifference, is just a part of this artful script, whose nostalgic gaze about an emerging Tokyo from the ashes of the WW2 will spell you.
216;an immortal masterpiece and one of my top twenty films ever made.
217;A lovely movie with excellent direction and brilliant acting.
218;Any true fan of cinemography will enjoy the interesting camera views, the beautiful scenes vis a vi the direction and the touching plot.
219;Seeing as how most of their mentalities are turn 18, say goodbye to mom and dad, live as salaciously and promiscuously as legally and physically possible, and then eventually get married because all my friends are doing it.
220;If you are patient and enjoy reading books, you will love this movie.
221;Keep in mind that it truly is a classic, with a valuable message.
222;this film, considered by many his masterpiece, is not so subtle.
223;It reminds me more of a fairy tale with wicked step.
224;sisters of a virtuous young beauty.
225;The young beauty is their impoverished daughter.
226;Often voted one of the greatest films of all time, Yasujiro Ozu's most famous film (made in 1953, but not released in the US until years later) follows an elderly couple as they leave their seaside town where they live with their youngest daughter, Kyoko, to visit their two eldest surviving children, Shige and Koichi, in Tokyo, stopping to meet their youngest son, Keizo, in Osaka along the way.
227;Yet the film celebrates the new Tokyo as much as it condemns it, and the couple admits to themselves that though their children are not as nice as they remembered, they are happy they are busy and can care for themselves.
228;And the most selfless member of the younger generation Noriko (played by the great Japanese actress Setsuko Hara) points out to the stay.
229;One of the greatest pleasures of the film are its superb framed compositions, especially in his transitional sequences where he shows us empty rooms, as if to emphasize the transitory nature of human life and family affairs.
230;the story is immediately engrossing and keeps you rivetted from start to finish.
231;It's not Seven Samurai or Yojimbo, but a simple tale of an elderly couple travelling to Tokyo to see their children.
232;There are no intense moments of melodrama or intriguing plot twists to entertain the viewer.
233;the film is beautifully photographed with a minimal amount of camera movement (if there is any at all), and is well preserved by Criterion.
234;It may not be the best restoration ever, but it's superior to the infamous Ran transfers, and hardly noticeable when the film carries you away.
235;The characters are so realistic that you may be reminded of friends or family.
236;It is simple to the point of understatement, and quite memorable.
237;ozu, one of the most neglected artists in the West, shows himself here to be one of the great directors of all time in this universal tale of deception and honesty.
238;burner for a while so i can explore the new and soon to be released works of this Quiet Master of cinema.
239;I was driven to see this movie while researching all the best from Tokyo after booking a trip to that city.
240;I highly recommend this movie.
241;One of the enduring classics by celebrated master Ozu, this melancholic dissection of family dynamics in postwar Japan may sound simplistic, but Story packs an emotional punch as it observes the erosion of traditional values in modern lifeways.
242;Story may be understated, but Ozu's quiet, immobile visual style and deft direction reflect the nuances of everyday existence like no one else.
243;Half the time they are just blending right into the picture.
244;I have only recently begun exploring some of the works of the eminent Japanese director Yasujiro Ozu, and while I was able to appreciate the greatness of FLOATING WEEDS, it is his TOKYO STORY that I will remember more.
245;Watching TOKYO STORY, I felt like I was in the presence of a wise old man who I felt could teach me, in his own silent way, a lot of things about life, especially when I eventually grow up (I am only eighteen myself) and perhaps run into these same situations that Ozu illustrates in this film.
246;What you see with every shot and every image in TOKYO STORY is life.
247;It's so realistic it's haunting.
248;Great antidote to the stylized, artificial movies of today.
249;Great preparation for my mother's visit to us in a few weeks.
250;not much of a story on the surface, but the strength of the movie is the vivid portrayal of the family, the fine acting, and the emotions brought up for the viewer.
251;This was sort of interesting.
252;I liked the settings of seeing the interior of Japanese homes in the 1950s and the various personalities of the characters, which are believable.
253;this is a lovely and touching movie from the acclaimed director Yasujiro Ozu.
254;In Tokyo Story, we see a couple who love their children and patiently and philosophically forgive them for their rudeness.
255;The circle of life and the real personalities of all the characters make for a poignant story.
256;it moves slowly and may be too long, but the result is an unforgettable glimpse into another time and place.
257;Win Wenders is obviously a huge fan of Ozu.
258;That's a beauty, isn't it.
259;She is the one who busts out crying when she is supposed to, when the more honest characters, the ones who actually feel sad, do not.
260;the father very definitely uses this convention as well.
261;one theme of the film is the thoughtlessness and selfishness of children.
262;there is an interesting scene at the end when the father is praising Noriko for her generosity and love.
263;He is, of course, a very sharp man.
264;Noriko denies that she has those good qualities.
265;She is admitting that she has her dark side, which she hasn't shown.
266;So the father praises her for her honesty, and continues to disagree with her about her character.
267;He understands what she's saying.
268;there is a poignant line in that conversation.
269;the commentary is informative but I found it disconcerting that the speaker sometimes says Noriko but more often says Nordico.
270;this is a good enough film to warrant you seeing it twice as I did, once as performed, and once listening to the commentary and trying to ignore all those Nordico's.
271;But you can't now, since I brought them to your attention.
272;The director's narrative and cinematography to this story is so precise and poignant about families, universally, is what makes it such a High rated classic.
273;This movie reminds me of my family life in Japan, the honesty of the charcters and actions and non.
274;This movie transcends all languages and families as these emotions are the human condition.
275;This movie is a great reminder to respect your family, no matter what.
276;Tokyo Story is the most critically acclaimed of Ozu's films.
277;still, Tokyo Story is a great film, and I'm always pleased when it gets ranked among the best films ever made.
278;It's certainly worthier of such an honor than many other films that are considered classics.
279;The print of the film itself is pretty good, given the age and origin of the material (compare the print of 1954's Godzilla, which is a scratched.
280;hour portrait of Ozu's life and work) and Talking with Ozu (a slightly less superb documentary in which various directors describe their personal reactions to Ozu's films).
281;the one bright spot in this whole film, and one that gives us all hope that there are truly good, decent people out there in the universe who do the right thing no matter what cost to themselves is the daughter.
282;law, who is so beautifully played by Setsuko Hara.
283;bottom line, this is a very poignant and sadly beautiful film that touches the heart deeply on so many levels and it's worth watching for the simple, yet intense, portrayal of it all.
284;Yes, Kane has all the bells and whistles, Last Tango is high art, Ben.
285;hur is the ultimate studio colloboration .
286;none have the simple power of Ozu's finest film.
287;wisely Ozu avoids all these devices.
288;trauma, we have real intimacy rather than intensity and release.
289;Frankly, the most mature film from the true master.
290;Yasujir Ozu's use of the camera at a tatami mat angle with characters often speaking their lines directly at the camera is brilliant and enhances the film greatly
291;there is so much depth to this story and many of the conversations are incredibly honest and revealing.
292;The only person who is happy to see them is their widowed former daughter.
293;just about one day (maybe two if you count the long train ride)
294;another interesting aspect of this film is that while the children are far from perfect, the father has his foibles, too.
295;tokyo Story remains one of the best films of all time.
296;like living facilities will always be relevant and timeless.
297;I highly recommend this film for fans of director Yasujir Ozu and the actors in this film.
298;An unknown but somehow recognizable temple on a hill.
299;A vivacious continuously grateful daughter.
300;this is a great film.
301;don't look for action or even monumental drama and enjoy.
302;One wonders that cinema could be this: a life.
303;enriching, moving masterpiece, that actually makes you feel better about Humankind and hopeful for the future.
304;Capra's It's a Wonderful Life is the only film I love as much as Tokyo Story.
305;Tokyo Story is the best.
306;known film in the West by Japanese director Yasujiro Ozu, whose depictions of everyday life in post.
307;made in 1953, Tokyo Story is fascinating in retrospect for its documentation of life in post.
308;war Japan, characterized by rapid change and 6.
309;day work weeks that created the prosperity that Japanese now enjoy.
310;usual perspective and the tendency of characters to come and go from the frame a nice change from conventional camera placement.
311;Tokyo Story has a measured, slow pace, which I associate with a certain style of Japanese film.
312;The film's pace is a large part of its poetry.
313;setsuko Hara, a huge star in Japan at the time, is radiant and naturally sympathetic.
314;An audio commentary by David Desser, who edited a book about this film, is rehearsed and informative.
315;He discusses the film's themes and provides a scene.
316;law (wonderful performance by Setsuko Hara) lives there as well.
317;After a day or two, the couple has had enough and return to their children.
318;Noriko is kind to both, takes time off from work and shows them the city.
319;Famed director Yasuijiro Ozu is recognized for some interesting camera work and that is surely evident here.
320;There are also isolated scenes where the characters engaged in conversation, talk directly into the camera, one person at a time.
321;The widow of their long dead son has no obligations to them at all but shows them tremendous warmth, kindness, and respect.
322;Everyone should see this beautiful character study.
323;Nevertheless, it is a beautiful movie, which will richly reward those with the patience to carefully consider what is happening and what is being said.
324;an elderly Japanese couple living in a rural town decides to visit their children in Tokyo.
325;She goes out of her way to make them feel welcome.
326;Not much outward action, with the action (feelings and emotions) happening within the characters.
327;It is only once you put yourself into the shoes of the characters that the emotional force hits you and the understatement actually adds to the impact.
328;This is aided beautifully by the scene setting.
329;This is just one example of how the setting and the words complement each other.
330;the film has a lot going for it.
331;It examines how people are so preoccupied with what is happening in their own small worlds that they lose sight of what is really important in life.
332;child relationship, but is also very insighful in its portrayal of the relationship between the mother and father.
333;Whilst they are clearly happy together, there is just the hint of their past and present relational problems and a subtle reminder of the need to cherish that which is precious, especially if it is not everlasting.
334;It is enlightening about Japanese culture, manners and way of doing things and it sheds a great deal of light on that nation's psyche after World War Two.
335;The generally polite and reserved nature of conversation is only sometimes breached, always with significant impact, as when the mother opens up her heart to Noriko (I am a burden to everyone) or when at the end Noriko opens up her heart to her father.
336;Because this happens out of culture and is a rare portrayal of intimacy, the impact is enhanced.
337;a beautiful film then, which can be regarded as a true classic.
338;a wonderful film, thoroughly recommended .
339;This was an excellent film.
340;Sometimes compassion goes a long way in life!
341;I love the simplicity that is portray in the movie.
342;The movies also made me think and reflect.
343;But finally the wait for me is over, and I've had the pleasure of watching A Tokyo Story.
344;Their son, a neighborhood doctor, has patients to care for, and their daughter, a beautician, would rather work than entertain her family.
345;plot aside, there are some beautiful scenes in this movie.
346;All of the shots of the caring daughter in law are breathtaking.
347;She's a beautiful woman on the inside, and I think Ozu highlighted this fact with every scene that she was in.
348;It's a true to life tale, where some don't realize how good they are, while others never learn to think beyond their own desires.
349;It is about the inevitable transitory nature of family, portrayed with the sensitivity that is found only in works such as King Lear.
350;This movie is rightly regarded as one of the best of the best of the best of all time.
351;there is something here for you.
352;In addition, if you are at all a History Channel buff, there is the added attraction of seeing life in postwar Japan, and what the middle.
353;I like to look at the clothes and also see a society in a major transition while still having the influence (still felt) from American occupation.
354;It's kinda fun to compare this with American films about Japan made in the same period, like Sayonara and Teahouse of the August Moon.
355;I found it so fascinating I wanted to redo my room just like the rooms you'll see in Tokyo Story and I also wanted to eat Japanese.
356;So I rate this ichi.
357;But the actors are so good they hold your attention.
358;heavy for a silent era film, and it seems that Ozu's particular style is pretty much dialog heavy anyway, so he just works better in the sound era.
359;Even though this movie is basically people sitting around talking for two hours and fifteen minutes (with a death put in for good effect), it was a very pleasant visual experience.
360;The best part was that I've already read all that stuff about Ozu and family, and he gets it spot on.
361;also, Ozu's quiet, methodical approach to building a quiet, almost listless world is very peaceful and alluring.
362;With only two shots in the entire film with a moving camera, everything felt wonderfully zen (though I wouldn't label Ozu a Buddhist.
363;A definite beingness pronounced the film and helped it be more than just a slide show of a family reunion.5 stars.
364;Roger Ebert was right ,one of top ten all time movies.
365;Hard to believe that it was made 60 years ago.
366;Tokyo Story is simply, the best film ever made.
367;Ozu is a remarkable Japanese director with such a keen perception of humanity and human existence.
368;No words can do justice to his story telling power, and he does it with such grace, reserve, etiquette and charm that it is impossible to believe you are watching a family.
369;It is like spending a good two hours with a next door neighbour.
370;This, the most revered of his films, takes a simple story of an elderly couple visiting their neglectful grown.
371;up children, which could have been a melodrama
372;A stunning work from one of the greatest masters of all times, do not let the steep price, in any way discourage you from getting a copy (a small price to pay New Yorker for getting all these wonderful films).
373;Simply, the best film of all times.
374;This is an excellent movie but not because it is any sort of a blockbuster motion picture nor because it is a cerebral exploration into one's inner self.
375;It is is excellent because it tells a meaningful story in a very simplistic manner.
376;the movie touches us because it hits so close to home (literally).
377;This COULD be us in any of the roles we see.
378;the acting in this movie is exceptional because it makes us feel that we really are looking into the lives of an actual family.
379;This is a movie worth seeing by anyone who doesn't mind reading subtitles in order to discover a bitter.
380;sweet story about their own lives.
381;But he hit his stride with Tokyo Story.
382;This film has been ranked by various film organizations as one of the best ten movies ever made.
383;It is a snapshot of the aspiring middle class of Japan in 1953.
384;Their houses, even the house of the doctor.
385;All the scenes of family life take place in tiny interiors where there are for example, close up shots of two kimonoed women talking intimately with much politeness.
386;The exterior shots contrast an industrial world of smokestacks with the beauty of the Japanese mountains and seacoast.
387;The camera angles are very precise.
388;The actors are unbelievably good.
389;If you are looking for plot, you won't find much here, but you will find a studied slice of life.
390;For Catholics amongst you all I can say is that it is a little bit like a cinematic equivalent of the life of St Th r se of Lisieux: small and hidden things, done with great love.
391;most all of the time I agree with Hitchcock's wonderfully affirming and unpretentious, Some film makers make movies that are like a slice of life .
392;She is still there today.
393;As the dear mother says at one moment in the film, giving thanks quite simply for the day's good weather, it is a blessing.
394;A very tough treatment of a very real issue, not just in our time, but for all ages.
395;I enjoyed how well the story was told with endearing acting and meticulous pacing.
396;Tokyo Story is a work of art of astounding power and profound beauty.
397;I once read that the British Film Society called Ozu one of the greatest artists of the 20th century in any country and in any medium.
398;Tokyo Story is one of his greatest films.
399;Also, be patient with it.
400;For one of the very few times in my life, I had a gut level feeling of certain knowledge that I had experienced a great work of art.
401;anyone interested in learning more about the director and his work can refer to Donald Richie's excellent book Ozu.
402;about my culture that IMDB's if you liked this you'll like.
403;not because they tread on delicate subject matter or anything like that, but because Ozu and Noda's script recreates the kind of quotidian dialogue one hears in real life in vivid detail.
404;There are a lot of people who don't like this movie.
405;And, yes, it makes the first half.
406;Once you get to the climax of the film, it all makes sense, as the true shallowness of some of these characters is revealed.
407;This, perhaps Ozu's strongest outing, is a perfect complement to something like Yojimbo.
408;If you've never seen an Ozu movie, prepare for a unique experience.
409;Those who wish to experience Japanese cinema other than samurai flicks should start with this masterpiece, especially the Criterion Collection version with the English commentary.
410;It certainly belongs on the list, but #1?
411;it's enjoyable, moving, and cinematically satisfying: compared to the constant stream of action, shock editing, and shrill noise of most present.
412;day American movies, Tokyo Story is like a necklace composed of visual haikus, each shot worthy of being savored by the discerning reviewer.
413;that lyrical and rhapsodic dimension of film that plays not only in the soundtrack but is made visible by the lyrical movement of the camera as well.
414;The most memorable films are also the most melodramatic.
415;a balance of sight and sound, the visual and the aural, the spatial and the temporal.
416;The greatest films not only expose loss but restore it through the fullness of music.
417;eyes, a 1954 film that's as operatic as it is cinematic, permitting a richness of expression in time that compensates for the elegiac sadness that accumulates with the passage of the years from pre.
418;Ozu's grave is marked by the Buddhist symbol Mu or nothingness.
419;I love Ozu and his static camera, and his revelation of a changing post.
420;ozu's sigh is so beautiful, so truthful, we've all felt his films as truth in our own lives.
421;i embrace his deep humanity, and feel lucky to have experienced his films.
422;Tokyo Story is one of the saddest and most beautiful films I have ever seen.
423;Godard once wrote that there are five or six films in the history of cinema which one wants to review simply by saying, 'it is the most beautiful of films,' because there can be no higher praise.
424;Tokyo Story is the most beautiful of films.
425;It is a great tribute to Ozu that we take his films to heart and relate them to ourselves.
426;I have seldom been effected, myself, in such a way by a movie.
427;technically, it is such a well made, unconventional, film.
428;Tokyo Story released in japan as Tokyo Monogatari is a very nice look at Japan in the early postwar years.
429;in the film, an elderly couple living in the country visit their children in the city.
430;this film is one of the most popular Japanese film ever made and is very worthy of a release on the Criterion Collection.
431;it also has a theatrical trailer.
432;The persons giving the tributes are: Stanley Kwan, Aki Kaurismki, Claire Denis, Lindsay Anderson, Paul Schrader, Wim Wenders, and Hou Hsiao.
433;It is amazing that this film ranks in most top.
434;Ozu specializes in movies depicting ordinary scenes from everyday Japanese life which subtly transform into memorable stories.
435;Tokyo Story is easily one of the handful of world film masterpieces.
436;Ozu is one of my favorite directors.
437;He quietly stirs your heart like a meditational tea ceremony.
438;i especially enjoy scenes of Japan in the 50's because that is the Japan I left behind as a child.
439;He is so gentle and loving.
440;Ozu's Tokyo Story is simply the most emotionally profound film I have ever seen.
441;It is the sort of film that, after seeing it, may easily change you.
442;This ending was so powerful that I was completely in tears for the final half hour or so of the film.
443;This film was SO profound that I felt moved upon viewing it.
444;You will be moved beyond words by one of the greatest films of all time, Yasujiro Ozu's Tokyo Story
445;Like many of Ozu's films, Tokyo Story ( Tokyo Monogatari ) examines a very simple stage in life, one that I hope most of us will be lucky enough to encounter at some time or another.
446;ozu's usual cast in at their best.
447;As always, Setsuko Hara, Japan's Eternal Virgin, brings light and love into an otherwise dismal story playing Noriko, the widowed Daughter.
448;That is the kind of power this film has.
449;of course, the Criterion Collection presentation is wonderful, with one of the best transfers of Tokyo Story I have seen.
450;It is far from flawless, but vastly superior to my old VHS copy.
451;The extra documentaries are delightful, and offer some insight into Ozu that in turn offers insight into his wonderful films.
