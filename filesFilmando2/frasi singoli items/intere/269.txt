I:18363;1;It is such a strong statement of the American spirit to pick itself up after a horrific tragedy and carry on.
I:18363;2;It might be a small place in America, but it is truly a semblance of our country.
I:18363;3;Spirited and inspiring, `We Are Marshall' takes the tragic plane crash that killed nearly every member of the football team and coaching staff at Marshall University and makes it into a living memorial.
I:18363;4;When Dedmon calls a private session to vote to cancel football, Nicky cleverly sends for people to come to demonstrate on the mall of the campus.
I:18363;5;His heart keeps all perseverance alive.
I:18363;6;He finally convinces, consoles, and cajoles those who are in shell.
I:18363;7;with great music pumping into the scenes, we get the determination to follow the seeds of rejuvenation.
I:18363;8;That is until the first game takes a nosedive and everyone involved starts to second.
I:18363;9;Lengyel, who was inspired to take over despite the results, at least has the winning message.
I:18363;10;The characters are lively and likable, and the story is told in a riveting way.
I:18363;11;It is a movie with great heart and bursting with passion.
I:18363;12;Good movie, good actors, difficult truth to tell but they do it well and respectfully of those whose lives were forever changed.
I:18363;13;We Are Marshall is an excellent movie the whole family will enjoy.
I:18363;14;Matthew McConaughey put a lot of effort into the character: Jack Lengyel.
I:18363;15;What matters most about this movie is that it is based upon a real.
I:18363;16;I am a college professor, and one of the greatest lessons that my students can learn is the lesson of resilience in the face of adversity.
I:18363;17;We are Marshall is a study in resilence and the healing that takes place over time.
I:18363;18;A true story and a powerful film.
I:18363;19;Matthew Fox and Matthew McConaughey are outstanding, they can do no wrong!
I:18363;20;The cinematography is striking and the story will just move you from scene to scene.
I:18363;21;I am not a huge fan of sports films but this one is quite good.
I:18363;22;We Are Marshall is uplifting even the tone of the film is generally meloncoholy.
I:18363;23;There are a lot of times when great leadership has mattered.
I:18363;24;It's funny how much she's shown us really in her sports.
I:18363;25;enacted, laughing at the mistake of that after a few moments of great family teasing.
I:18363;26;The game shown is symbolic of them putting things back together and finding a way to go on through the leadership of this good coach that went into this and tried.
I:18363;27;but I did just finish the game.
I:18363;28;That place, Marshall has real heart.
I:18363;29;It is a good school, and this is a winner film about the rebuilding of their team after a catastrophic loss.
I:18363;30;It was acted, filmed, made as a tribute and it captures the people and the times.
I:18363;31;I remembered hearing years ago about the plane with Marshall football players where on it when it went down.
I:18363;32;This movie is good for adults.
I:18363;33;I went and saw this movie 3 times and I still cryed all 3 times.
I:18363;34;and we did rise from the ashes and make a great football team!!
I:18363;35;so please watch this movie and honor those who parished on that faithful night in November.
I:18363;36;The restaurant scenes capture the essence of Wiggins' 16th Street altho' it is gone as well.
I:18363;37;Most folks, including us, just sat quietly in their seats while the credits rolled and then very quietly got up and left the theatre.
I:18363;38;Good inspirational movie for all ages.
I:18363;39;Would recommend it to a friend.
I:18363;40;Great movie, well acted, and very moving.
I:18363;41;Matthew McConaughey and Matthew Fox brought their characters to life.
I:18363;42;warmer that makes you want to visit the Marshall campus.
I:18363;43;My boyfriend and I bought it for my Dad for Christmas because he is from WV and he loved it too.
I:18363;44;Its great for people of all ages to see!
I:18363;45;This was a great movie based on real life.
I:18363;46;Fantastic movie to see as a family with children.
I:18363;47;Teaches that you can overcome if you put your heart into it.
I:18363;48;True story with a message for life today.
I:18363;49;Life is full of struggles and we can win in life.
I:18363;50;To be a winner in life, we must be committed to the fight and to what is right.
I:18363;51;Matthew Fox, and most memorably, Nate Ruffin, turn in very strong performances.
I:18363;52;Otherwise, this is an OK movie to watch with your sports.
I:18363;53;The ending, (one that even Hollywood couldn't improve on) will bring tears to your eyes.
I:18363;54;Great movie of triumphant in a hard time.
I:18363;55;It is amazing the tragedy they overcame and the heartaches they overcame to get here they are today.
I:18363;56;"All football fans will love this true story: ""We Are Marshall."""
I:18363;57;It is captivating, dramatic, motivating and cinematically well done.
I:18363;58;It is a classic movie that will be enjoyed by people of all ages for years to come.
I:18363;59;Grab your tissues and enjoy the feeling of people coming together and overcoming this tragedy.
I:18363;60;There is absolutely nothing special and or new to separate this film from the rest of the pack, and honestly it is no where near as good as most other sports related dramas.
I:18363;61;In all honestly I found `Friday Night Lights' to have a much stronger emotional connection to the audience than this film.
I:18363;62;fianc of one of the deceased is rather touching and heartbreaking, but overall the film cannot reach the heights it is so desperately trying to grasp.
I:18363;63;charming performance in each film yet never manages to make his performance `mean' anything.
I:18363;64;i won't say that `We Are Marshall' is a bad film, but I must declare it is far from a great one.
I:18363;65;"If you want to watch a film about the town of Marshall and the tragedy that befell them then by all means, watch this film
I:18363;66;Great movie and a touching story.
I:18363;67;What a strong bond this school had and still has today.
I:18363;68;since everyone knows what is in store, the first part of the movie is especially poignant as you meet the players and know their lives are destined to end far too early.
I:18363;69;Matthew McMcConaughey gives a stirring performance as Coach Lengyel as does Matthew Fox as Red Dawson, the assistant coach who gives up his seat at the last minute to another person.
I:18363;70;this movie manages to honor those who died and those who picked up the pieces and restored pride to Marshall.
I:18363;71;that said, my husband and children thoroughly enjoyed this film (with me sniffling the entire time).
I:18363;72;"He used composite characters to reflect the experiences of hundreds of people in the community, but there are several ""true"" characters in the film."
I:18363;73;The film is a story of perserverence and redemption, ideas to which anyone can relate.
I:18363;74;its ending is honest and genuine.
I:18363;75;But the program did finally overcome the adversity and produced great football and great football players.
I:18363;76;And that's the best ending we could have.
I:18363;77;this is a great movie that is based on a true events and it is tear jerking and unbelievable .
I:18363;78;The music score is on of the best in movie history.
I:18363;79;This story based on true events will bring you to tears, but also inspire the humor bug in you, as you follow the path of the quirky coach who brought Marshall out of post.
I:18363;80;Good solid movie with a great stoy, never give up when things are down for the worst in a small town.
I:18363;81;this movie is about trying to bring back the football team with new players, and make them a solid team.
I:18363;82;They play a really nice part in the movie, and their emotions are believable.
I:18363;83;in fact, the emotions of the coach, the new set of players, and everyone else is very real, honest, and believable.
I:18363;84;It was very difficult, and through plenty of emotional scenes, they'll eventually make moving on a reality.
I:18363;85;they also did a spectacular job with the choice of rock songs from that time period, such as Cat Stevens, Black Sabbath and Crosby Stills and Nash.
I:18363;86;just a really incredible film that will move you on several occasions.
I:18363;87;Great movie to see, also sad.
I:18363;88;This was a great and uplifting movie filled with hope despite the tragedy.
I:18363;89;Marshall football made the biggest comeback in sports history.
I:18363;90;and its respectful to share both the hardship and the tremendous heart of those who were able to carry on and take the field the next season.
I:18363;91;Players, coaches and a whole town had to come together to save this program and honor those who perished.
I:18363;92;Imagine a story about a athlete program, a town, a university.
I:18363;93;It's a great story and a powerful movie.
I:18363;94;It's one of the most inspiring movies you will ever see.
I:18363;95;is a great movie that captures the incredible tragedy of the plain that, in 1970, killed so many members of the Marshall football community.
I:18363;96;I truly believe the creators of this movie tried their best to create a factual yet entertaining movie about the Marshall tragedy.
I:18363;97;The film can't follow all of the sad stories, so it chooses a few characters to focus on and has them be representative of the entire town.
I:18363;98;Coach Red Dawson (played by Lost's Matthew Shepard) tells another coach to take his seat on the plane so he can get home to see his daughter's piano recital.
I:18363;99;The film sets up a group of characters quickly and they all connect with the audience.
I:18363;100;The crash is close enough that people in the town can see the site.
I:18363;101;They finally make it to the season and the movie concludes with the team's first home game.
I:18363;102;But WE ARE MARSHALL does a great job of portraying the sadness of the entire community and the incredible spirit that it took to embrace the new football team and honor those who lost their lives.
I:18363;103;The acting in this movie is solid, especially Fox and McConaughey.
I:18363;104;I recommend this movie to all sports fans and those interested in the history of the tragedy at Marshall.
I:18363;105;This movie honors the victims as well is the spirit of the school.
I:18363;106;What's to argue with a true sad story brought to life in an uplifting way .
I:18363;107;It is a great movie that moves you emotionally up and down throughout.
I:18363;108;The casting and performances are top notch.
I:18363;109;The story shows that true life events can be far more riviting than those made up in Hollywood.
I:18363;110;From the opening scene until the narative of Marshall's success in 90's at the end, this movie held my interest.
I:18363;111;My wife has never been to a college football game in her life but she loved this movie too.
I:18363;112;It is about overcoming extreme adversity and going on with life.
I:18363;113;Matthew McConaughey nailed it so much I spent the entire movie thinking of the funniest coach I ever had.
I:18363;114;Everyone associated with this film absolutely nailed it.
I:18363;115;This was both the biggest and most profound thing I had ever read about, and it was born in the thing I loved the most, football.
I:18363;116;There was A LOT of spontaneous applause when it was over, and you and I both know that is a rare thing.
I:18363;117;i'll own this as soon as it comes out, and I'll watch it over and over.
I:18363;118;Loss is a part of life, and how each person deals with their loss, and then decides to get on with their life, is the ultimate theme of the movie.
I:18363;119;very well done, and an entertaining (but not sappy or maudlin) movie.
I:18363;120;This movie does a very good job of explaining what goes into forming a society.
I:18363;121;The story line is straight forward and the story type is familiar but this film turns these things into a powerful script.
I:18363;122;The first part of the film covers the days before the accident and puts the main characters in connection with the town's residents.
I:18363;123;the rest of the film covers the search for a new coach and settled on one man who started from scratch with a couple of players and a few staff members.
I:18363;124;It also dealt with the surviving friends and families showing one young woman who left town with her fiancees engagement ring.
I:18363;125;Whether the story told is accurate to the actual event I couldn't say, but it is definitely successful as an enjoyable and inspirational movie ala the beloved `Rudy'.
I:18363;126;matthew McConaughey does a superb job at playing the unorthodox, off.
I:18363;127;Memorable performances abound in this film making it one that will stand up to many repeat viewings.
I:18363;128;Good clean movie shows good character and morals.
I:18363;129;In my opinion Hoosiers is an exceptional movie.
I:18363;130;That film set the bar very high.
I:18363;131;Knowing that, the Marshall film also is well done with a good case and excellent plots.
I:18363;132;You will enjoy viewing this one too!
I:18363;133;One of my favorite football movies of all time.
I:18363;134;This is a very heart.
I:18363;135;This is a type of movie that I can watch over and over.
I:18363;136;Great Great Movie well worth owning.
I:18363;137;It is one of my all time favorites now.
I:18363;138;As for the Movie, it is a well written and acurate account of the plane crash.
I:18363;139;It is a great movie, funny, very sad, and most importantly it will help us remember a group of people who unexpectedly left us all.
I:18363;140;the acting is very well done.
I:18363;141;as for the accuracy of the events, i don't know how accurate this movie is, but it looks great.
I:18363;142;The 24 hour usage was excellent.
I:18363;143;Positive way of overcoming odds to bring forth a positive outlook for a community that was devastated by tragedy.
I:18363;144;A great true story that speaks volumes about the will of mankind in the face of adversity !
I:18363;145;Another football movie based on a true story.
I:18363;146;It is brought to life by powerful performances by Matthew McConaughey who plays the brave coach Jack Lengyel that is brought in to revitalize a destroyed program, Matthew Fox who plays returning coach Red Dawson who wasn't on the plane that tragic night, and Anthony Mackie who plays Nate Ruffin, an injured player who didn't travel with the team that fateful night.
I:18363;147;mostly though, WE ARE MARSHALL, is brought to life by great decisions by the films director McG.
I:18363;148;He also captures the emotion behind the 3 returning players, mostly in an extremely powerful locker room scene between Ruffin and Fox, as Ruffin pleads to be able to play through his injury, feeling he owes it to his perished teammates.
I:18363;149;wE ARE MARSHALL is a tremendous achievement and a tremendous tribute to those players who perished and a team that struggled through grief in order to eventually lift its chin and keeping trudging through, paying the ultimate tribute to those players.
I:18363;150;Awesome movie telling the story of a tragic event.
I:18363;151;And in case you were wondering, The funerals end today!
I:18363;152;The movie is flawed but the sincerity of the performances and the material itself give it a certain attraction .
I:18363;153;the makers of this movie so much want you to like it that I did to an extent.
I:18363;154;"the ones that did not go on the away trip
I:18363;155;but yet there is a gritty realism to the movie and this is part and parcel of its appeal as well as its weakness.
I:18363;156;This move is without a doubt the very best movie I have ever seen.
I:18363;157;Being a true story and how the whole town faced adversity and moved forward with their broken hearts.
I:18363;158;There's more to the movie than the story of football.
I:18363;159;It tells the story of life.
I:18363;160;Will preserved rom them again,and again,and again!!!!
I:18363;161;Wonderful movie, a story about a terrible tragedy made into a heart warming story.
I:18363;162;i believe the movie has value for both fans of football or for those who are interested in people overcoming adversity.
I:18363;163;This is one of those movies you just have to see once to realize that life can move on after tragedy.
I:18363;164;In 1971, with the bravery of the few remaining players, an incredible school president/dean, and one caring coach, the town was able to reserect the spirit of the town and the nation and in a leave a legacy for those who were left behind.
I:18363;165;Just think, since then they have won two 1.
I:18363;166;this is based on a true story .
I:18363;167;rising from the ashes like the phoenix .
I:18363;168;This was a nice movie, interesting all the way, a combination sports film and melodrama and based on a tragic real.
I:18363;169;life event: a 1970 plane crash that killed 75 people including all but a couple of players and coaches on the Marshall University football team.
I:18363;170;That's a good endorsement right there.
I:18363;171;a lot of fun to watch.
I:18363;172;The one football game featured is a little hokey, too, but I didn't say the movie is great, just entertaining and inspiring, which is good enough for me.
I:18363;173;dozen famous coaches in America give their philosophies on coaching and some of the segments are very interesting with some profound statements in them
I:18363;174;This story is a must for anyone overcoming adversity both in sports and in life.
I:18363;175;A true story that takes the time in the end to connect the dots with the actors portrayal and the real characters.
I:18363;176;Mcconaughey is at his best in this one.
I:18363;177;Convincing portrayals, just the right amount of bromance bonding, sympathetic without pathos, Matt Mc plays a good ole boy the best
I:18363;178;This is a thriller even though you sort of know how it comes out in the end, ie., that the school and the football program survive, otherwise they would not have made the movie.
I:18363;179;spun, yet highly intense, never.
I:18363;180;He is a study in contradictions and an inspiration to boot.
I:18363;181;The story of We are Marshall is filled with emotional highs and lows, incredible sadness, and incredible resilience.
I:18363;182;I highly recommend it to all, whether you are a football fan or not.
I:18363;183;Matthew Mcconaughey give his best movie performance ever.
I:18363;184;enjoy it but be ready to shed a few tears as it goes along.
I:18363;185;I really like the way Mathew took his roll and made it his own.
I:18363;186;And true stories make for good watching.
I:18363;187;This is an excelent movie sad but still a great movie.
I:18363;188;"McConaughey is funny, a tad odd, and wonderfully inspiring
I:18363;189;I've seen several films featuring this actor, and this is by far his best role.Yet WE ARE MARSHALL features several exceptional performances, including Anthony Mackie as cornerback and team captain Nate Ruffin.
I:18363;190;Also noteworthy is David Straithairn as humble, soft.
I:18363;191;this film brings back the Seventies in all its vibrant, gaudy colors, augmented by a slick musical score that restores an avalanche of memories.
I:18363;192;And finally, WE ARE MARSHALL boasts one of the most moving cinematic scenes ever.
I:18363;193;You will really feel chills racing up and down your spine, and a lump in your throat, yet compelled to stand up and cheer this inspirational, exceptional movie.
I:18363;194;This movie held our interest the whole time.
I:18363;195;Acting was good and storyline was pensive!
I:18363;196;I remember the event this movie was taken from, so it was something I had wanted to see since the movie came out.
I:18363;197;This was a well made story about a true event.
I:18363;198;It has tragedy and triumph.
I:18363;199;I've watched it many times and still enjoy it.
I:18363;200;McConnaughey played a slick Southern lawyer to perfection and the film was a true story just like We Are Marshall.
I:18363;201;It's just that Bernie was very well portrayed and flowed.
I:18363;202;The price, however, of this film was right and I do not regret seeing it.
I:18363;203;But I will give it to one of the kids as they love the boring sports.
I:18363;204;This movie is based on a true story.
I:18363;205;Enter an eccentric coach (played brilliantly by Matthew McConaughey) who finds that he must literally rebuild a football program.
I:18363;206;even more importantly, the new coach is tasked with lifting the spirits of the team, the students of the university and the entire town of Huntington, West Virginia.
I:18363;207;In this way, this is one of those films in which sports can transcend the travails of life and become a metaphor.
I:18363;208;this is one of the more powerful sports movies I've ever seen.
I:18363;209;What makes it more poignant than a great many sports flicks is the fact that it actually happened .
I:18363;210;Loved this true story, it is filled with compassion, heart and soul.
I:18363;211;A great movie about life and how it effects people.
I:18363;212;This is a deeply moving movie.
I:18363;213;They do manage to win one game, and that is where the movie ends.
I:18363;214;sentimental people should have a full box of kleenex handy.
I:18363;215;Just when you think the sad part is over, something happens to tear your heart open all over again, just the way it happens in life.
I:18363;216;It will open scars that you had forgotten you had, but it will expose them to the fresh air of hope and the healing power of time.
I:18363;217;The setting was done real well and a lot of the supporting acting was great.
I:18363;218;Then, the team is reformed due to the enthusiasm of a replacement coach.
I:18363;219;Up to this point, the movie is very good.
I:18363;220;The eventual team win just fizzles too.
I:18363;221;it's a well made and well acted movie.
I:18363;222;Being based on a true story makes this movie all the more compelling.
I:18363;223;I also remember that Marshall decided to rebuild the program and have a team playing the regular schedule the following 1971 season.
I:18363;224;Well, I knew nothing of the details, but they did it and even managed to win a couple games.
I:18363;225;It's a good movie, without question!
I:18363;226;It's a very tragic story, but is very uplifting at the same time.
I:18363;227;The story is well done.
I:18363;228;This is a true classic, although not as well not as some of McConaughey's other big budget movies, this is better in my opinion.
I:18363;229;This is a true story and he is surrounded by a fantastic supporting cast.
I:18363;230;Great price, great movie, very happy with the shipping and price.
I:18363;231;A great football movie for football fans of all ages.
I:18363;232;This is a movie I could watch again and again.
I:18363;233;As a Virginia Tech fan, I was aware of the connection with Marshall's tragedy.
I:18363;234;Frank Loria, who was lost in the plane crash disaster, and who starred at Virginia Tech, was an outstanding athlete and human being.
I:18363;235;This movie was well done and a tribute to those who were lost and those who carried on.
I:18363;236;Good movie fast service, Thanks a bunch,I enjoyed it very much,. . . . . . . . .
I:18363;237;I was impressed with how the new team was formed and how they showed respect to the players who had been killed.
I:18363;238;Football unified the community, gave sense of purpose, a team too believe in, an escape from the drudger of steel production, and a wholesome sense of value.
I:18363;239;The President finds a coach willing to rebuild the team.
I:18363;240;The WV football team was below average in stats and win/loss, but big on heart, courage, and determination.
I:18363;241;The story is about determination, dreaming of greatness, compassion during loss, and the desire too raise a family.
I:18363;242;This was one of the most uplifting movies I have seen.
I:18363;243;Great movie about how a town over came the lose of there team.
I:18363;244;Speaks great about the ones lost and the school which over came and continued the football program.
I:18363;245;We Are Marshall is a great movie with fine performances all around.
I:18363;246;"Matthew McConaughey does a fine job playing Jack Lengyel
I:18363;247;The football scenes are very well.
I:18363;248;done and the movie is emotionally stirring.
I:18363;249;matthew McConaughey plays the role of the couch that will make the best he can in order to reestablish the vanished glory and the passion for winning.
I:18363;250;a true lesson of life and epic resistance against the odds.
I:18363;251;This movie is just outstanding and I am glad to own own it.
I:18363;252;Sad story but great movie.
I:18363;253;A heart felt and touching story, the movie captured what it must have been like to be in West Virginia during that unbelievable tragedy
I:18363;254;Both of us are Marshall alumni, Class of 1974.
I:18363;255;"As much as I can remember, it was very accurate not only in the details but the ""spirit"" of the community ."
I:18363;256;Football is and has always been a sport that the Huntington community gets behind.
I:18363;257;there were a few items that were expanded or not fully accurate but for the whole I believe it was accurate in capturing the spirit and emitions of the time.
I:18363;258;that is one of the small inaccuracies) and he believes it was fairly accurate as well.
I:18363;259;It will make you cry, laugh, and go through all the emotions that the people all went through.
I:18363;260;Thoroughly enjoyable, but be prepared to be moved to tears at times.
I:18363;261;This movie is a good portrayal of how one sad event can change so many lives.
I:18363;262;The acting is good and evenly matched.
I:18363;263;The football games are well choreographed.
I:18363;264;There are many remarkable special effects.
I:18363;265;This is a movie for sports lovers and one that has never seen a game.
I:18363;266;Great movie, good movie for children to see!
I:18363;267;very powerful and educational at same time.
I:18363;268;I recall this being a very riveting movie the first time I watched!
I:18363;269;On second time around, it lost its luster, but definitely worth that first watch.
I:18363;270;emotionally gripping at the start, and so exciting at the end .
I:18363;271;this was such a great movie and tribute to Marshall!
I:18363;272;five people, including the entire football team, coaching staff, and some fans were killed.
I:18363;273;This fine film describes the rebirth of the Marshall football program after this terrible tragedy.
I:18363;274;Jack contacts the University himself and expresses interest in the job.
I:18363;275;First, a winning season was accomplished in the early 80s.
I:18363;276;Two National Titles rounded out Marshall's resurgence.
I:18363;277;simply put, this is a fantastic movie.
I:18363;278;David Strathairn, Matthew Fox, and Anthony Mackie are all very good in their roles, but this movie belongs to Matthew McConaughey.
I:18363;279;He does a masterful job of portraying a head coach who faced nearly insurmountable odds and yet put a group of young men together and made them a team.
I:18363;280;His performance is truly one of the best I've seen.
I:18363;281;i give this movie my highest recommendation.
I:18363;282;The story is poignant, yet uplifting at the same time.
I:18363;283;rate, and the game sequences are exciting to watch.
I:18363;284;You'll want to stand and cheer.
I:18363;285;It is worth the watch.
I:18363;286;This is a GREAT movie.
I:18363;287;"Add this to your collection of great football movies with ""Brian's Song"", ""Rudy"", ""We are the Titans"", ""The Longest Yard"", and ""Radio""."
I:18363;288;Make some popcorn and enjoy!
I:18363;289;My question all this time has been What on Earth was Matthew McConnahay thinking of with his absolutely over the top, hammed up performance.
I:18363;290;The documentary, ASHES TO GLORY, is a better film in my opinion.
I:18363;291;And, of course, REMEMBER THE TITANS is a much better true football story film.
I:18363;292;Each time I am blown away by the power of this true story and the amazing performance of each of the main characters (Matthew Mc Conaughey, Matthew Fox, Anthony Mackie, and David Strathaim to name a few.
I:18363;293;I highly recommend this wonderful film.
I:18363;294;Our Family really enjoyed this movie, brings out all your emotions and Matthew Mcconaughey is excellent in it and everyone in themovie does a great job of acting
I:18363;295;"This movie has a ""rise from the ashes"" and keep going message all through it."
I:18363;296;This is truly an inspirational film.
I:18363;297;Features interviews with inspiring coaches talking about how they led their teams to victory.
I:18363;298;A look at the Marshall University campus today.
I:18363;299;It's a good family movie.
I:18363;300;A coach with a vision brings healing to a community suffering from the loss of their beloved football team.
I:18363;301;Time and perseverance of the coaches brings healing to many hearts as they rebuild the football program.
I:18363;302;Good casting, believable dialogue, and competent acting.
I:18363;303;Overall, I enjoyed the movie and would recommend it to the sports fan in particular.
I:18363;304;A father and the sweetheart of a player share their grief.
I:18363;305;These hit just the right mix.
I:18363;306;love this movie I'm a big football fan so of course i love it.
I:18363;307;love movies that are based on true stories.
I:18363;308;a magnificent piece that deals with coping with tragedy and rising above the ashes.
I:18363;309;perfect themes for this post 9/11 world, wouldn't you say?
I:18363;310;I can guarantee you will not be disapointed, especially with the fact that this has to be the best performances ever given by Matthew McCaughney.
I:18363;311;A great story of overcoming great tragedy and loss.
I:18363;312;Marshall proud to relate this movie I the school I go to.
I:18363;313;What takes place afterward is a story of rebuilding, healing, and inspiration, not only in terms of football but of life in general.
I:18363;314;Since the film came out we have traveled to Huntington annually to pay respects and see a game, and based upon our experiences in doing so we can attest to the fact that the good folks of that town are as warm and hospitable as they are depicted on the screen.
I:18363;315;I love movies with cheesy inspirational pep talks.
I:18363;316;A good story that will take you on a emotional roller coaster.
I:18363;317;The football action is quite well done, the acting especially by McConaughey is very convincing and while yes it is cliche and anyone who knows the story knows the team didn't do well, it is easily one of the most touching and inspiring sports flicks I've seen in quite some time.
I:18363;318;the opening scenes with the football game vs. East Carolina and those leading to and immediately after the crash do set the tone for the rest of the movie.
I:18363;319;"One of the other good performances in this flick is by David Strathairn (""Good Night and Good Luck"") who always shines with this type of material."
I:18363;320;The way they fought back to make their program whole again was inspiring.
I:18363;321;They played in a bowl game this year, how great is that.
I:18363;322;I cried through each viewing of the film.
I:18363;323;I remember the event as if it happened yesterday.
I:18363;324;A school, a city that is like family all lost loved ones that day.
I:18363;325;Today, both are closer and stronger for it.
I:18363;326;This movie is a must see for kids and adults alike because many of the feelings are of real life and how each is handled.
I:18363;327;McConaughey is outstanding and the movie is realistic in its portrayal of pain and moving forward.
I:18363;328;It's heartwarming to see what coming together in tragedy can do .
I:18363;329;in this case it changed a whole town!
I:18363;330;How appropriate to choose a positive approach to honor those who have passed instead of the alternative.
I:18363;331;And Hollywood honored those individuals and the survivors families through out the creation of the movie.
I:18363;332;The Director, McG will be a force in the movie industry for creating a powerful story that will make you feel good about the human spirit.
I:18363;333;The story revolves around football but it is a story of the human emotional journey to recovery.
I:18363;334;This is the type of story that you want to see again and again.
I:18363;335;I had seen this movie, loved it and chose it for a gift.
I:18363;336;My product arrived in wonderful shape,well.
I:18363;337;It was a good movie though.
I:18363;338;The loud, dramatic football scenes are well done in this movie, as are the more emotional one.
I:18363;339;This is an uplifting and inspiring movie.
I:18363;340;I enjoyed watching this movie about a school rebuilding a football team following a tragedy.
I:18363;341;Very enjoyable movie and will watch it again and again.
I:18363;342;This movie is beautifully played out.
I:18363;343;It's respectful and appropriate to the situation.
I:18363;344;It's an amazing, inspirational story and I truly believe it is one of the most underappreciated sports movies there is!
I:18363;345;Definitely one of my all time favorites!
I:18363;346;True Sports movies are our favorites.
I:18363;347;This movie was fantastically done.
I:18363;348;Really lets the viewers know the passion behind Marshall Football.
I:18363;349;Amazon delivered another awesome product.
I:18363;350;WE ARE MARSHALL's Director, McG, managed to portray the personality of Huntington, WV and its intimate relationship with Marshall Univeristy true to the time period of the event: 1970.
I:18363;351;as part of the Huntington Community working with Marshall University, I found the film captured the cultural context of Huntington's appalchian personality accurately.
I:18363;352;Coach Lengyel's movie character is an enjoyable, quirky departure from the more austere historical figure and legitimately nurtures the film's landscape to broaden audience appeal for those unfamiliar with history's greatest sport's tragedy.
I:18363;353;"For a historical documentary of the event, see ""Ashes to Glory."""
I:18363;354;"For a feel good experience see ""WE ARE."
I:18363;355;i hope you all enjoy it as much as I did!
I:18363;356;I really enjoyed that is was based on a true story.
I:18363;357;It had the feel good of The Blind Side.
I:18363;358;My 11 year old son also thought it was great.
I:18363;359;We are Marshall has all of the elements of an entertaining story.
I:18363;360;It also happens to be based on actual events that my husband, and many people of his generation, remember with great sadness.
I:18363;361;"I highly recommend ""We Are Marshall"" and will watch it with my children so they can understand how a town and a team emerged from ashes to reclaim their identity."
I:18363;362;The story is tragic and ultimately has an uplifting message, but I found myself drifting
I:18363;363;"While watching this true story play out it might occur to you that this inspirational story reaches its climax when Marshall played in its first game under Lengyel the week before, because just fielding a team again is a major achievement, but ""We Are Marshall"" stays faithful to the genre it represents and represents well."
I:18363;364;Inspirational movies of this sort are intended to provoke strong emotions if not tears, but rarely is the first act as emotionally powerful as it is in this 2006 film.
I:18363;365;the other main characters in this film are those touched hardest by the tragedy.
I:18363;366;His motivation seems unique, because Ruffin wants his team back, and it is Ruffin who is the heart of the Young Thundering Herd.
I:18363;367;I'm glad I bought it.
I:18363;368;another warm and fuzzy sports movie, yay!
I:18363;369;Lived in Huntington, WV for a couple of years and saw the love of the town for this school and their football team.
I:18363;370;This movie is great in showing that.
I:18363;371;I recommend this movie to everyone.
I:18363;372;I remember, first hand, what our town and community went through after the tragic loss of so many lives.
I:18363;373;When I first heard that the movie was going to be made, I was both thrilled and trepidatious.
I:18363;374;Could a big time Hollywood movie capture the real event with integrity, honesty and respect?
I:18363;375;The answer is a resounding Yes!McG, McConaughey, Fox and the rest of the cast and crew treated our story with all of that and more.
I:18363;376;The movie is historically accurate, (thanks to a great script by Jamie Linden) the acting is excellent, the soundtrack is fabulous, and McG .
I:18363;377;"thank you for filming a good portion of this movie in Huntington!This movie was not only ""necessary"" but a story that applies to so many other ""rise from the ashes"" events in our world today."
I:18363;378;They took a true story and made it into a movie that can touch the heart of anyone who sees it.
I:18363;379;It was intended to share an uplifting and heart.
I:18363;380;warming true story and to evoke understanding, empathy, courage and determination.
I:18363;381;If you have any humanity in you, you will like this movie!
I:18363;382;I remember clearly, as a high school junior, the shock and loss that the crash of the aircraft carrying the Marshall University football team invested on a nation.
I:18363;383;The town, the college, and those left behind must have suffered so.
I:18363;384;Unlike Ruffin, the school's administration and its president Donald Dedmon (the always excellent David Strathairn)are more realistic.
I:18363;385;They will suspend the program for a few years to give everyone a chance to recover.
I:18363;386;the remainder of the film deals with both the practical matter of building the team, the difficulty in winning, and the way those in the town and at the school deal with the grief of what might have been.
I:18363;387;director McG, not a favorite of mine (he brought us BOTH Charlie's Angel's films) surprises with his light touch with the story and his ability to let the film find its own legs.
I:18363;388;It is a poignant tale.
I:18363;389;The game sequences have an authentic feel, and the score moves well with the film.
I:18363;390;The film feels like authentic West Virginia and authentic 70's.
I:18363;391;"It never attempts to be something it isn't
I:18363;392;It deeply affected the crowd in the theater on the day I saw it.
I:18363;393;mcConaughey is goofy, offbeat and believable as Lengyel.
I:18363;394;There's no cliche here, just a simple story that will make you both sad and hopeful.
I:18363;395;This movie portrayed the actual events very closely and accurately.
I:18363;396;Top notch actors and actresses did an excellent job.
I:18363;397;True story about a grat team.
I:18363;398;I had seen this movie on TV and knew that I had to own it.
I:18363;399;It's one you will want to watch over and over.
I:18363;400;Matthew Mcconaughey is fantastic is this film.
I:18363;401;It's right up there with Remember the Titans, another favorite of mine.
I:18363;402;Lots of football and no bad language so younger kids can enjoy it also.
I:18363;403;Outstanding story of survival and a coach who literally saved the town by making football alive again.
I:18363;404;joyous journey from tragedy to success.
I:18363;405;My grandfather, Dave Smith played on the young Herd's team after the plane crash.
I:18363;406;He is the one that was recruited from the basketball team.
I:18363;407;I do recommend it to all who like football, college ball, Marshall University, West Virginia, or overcomers or any sort!
I:18363;408;There were a lot of moments in this film that were very moving.
I:18363;409;He was a wonderful young man and my family I learned the next day that unfortunately he was among those on the team plane.
I:18363;410;If you like to be moved when watching a film, by all means, watch this one.
I:18363;411;The three of us cried our way through this movie.
I:18363;412;Also recommend Remember the Titans and The Blind Side which we also loved.
I:18363;413;teens that hold their attention and are appropriate.
I:18363;414;We are not football fans but loved these three football movies.
I:18363;415;I enjoyed this movie, it was well acted and well done.
I:18363;416;I highly recommend watching this beautiful, inspiring and incredibly sad film about a town in West Virginia that lost its college football team and most of the coaches in a horrific plane crash and how an outsider helped them rebuild and keep the spirits of the lost players alive.
I:18363;417;Regardless it is still highly charged with emotion and you are sure to be cheering from within: We are, Marshall!This film is about hope, grieving, rebuilding and the unity of a town brought together by the sport of football.
I:18363;418;I had great fortune to see it first time in Huntington while home for Xmas with my Father.
I:18363;419;somehow we survived and so slowly put our lives back together but we always understood that life is precious, not to be taken for granted.
I:18363;420;The movie does a good job of acknowledging the deep pain we felt and how we all struggled with the loss.
I:18363;421;that is all that really matters!
I:18363;422;Matthew McConaughey was perfect in this role as the coach that tried to heal an entire town after the real life tragedy Marshall University experienced.
I:18363;423;The story and writing were so perfectly done.
I:18363;424;All I can say is Wow!
I:18363;425;Viewing this movie is definately worth your time and both men and women will love this one.
I:18363;426;this film, which is a tribute to the football team that died in 1970, the students of Mashall University, Jack Lengyel, Nate Ruffin and the new freshmen football team of 1971, is an emotional, engaging and well.
I:18363;427;"With wonderful cinematography, a gripping story and moving characters, ""We Are Marshall"" deserves a rating of 4 out of 5 stars."
I:18363;428;The story of Marshall's comeback from tragedy is inspiring.
I:18363;429;It was truly a horrific event that tore a community apart and through the vision of a few put the town back on its feet.
I:18363;430;This emotional film follows the aftermath in the city of Huntington, WV, and how a new courageous coach and dedicated players helped pull the team and the town back together.
I:18363;431;the film is boosted by solid performances by Matthew McConaughey as the new coach in a performance that eschews his usual macho comeon and focuses on his sincerity.
I:18363;432;David Strathairn as the President of the University is fine in a smaller but impressive role.
I:18363;433;as sports movies go, this is a very good one and you should experience the elation of the team's comeback.
I:18363;434;Great uplifting story, stellar cast.
I:18363;435;Just good all the way around for cast.
I:18363;436;presentation, and the message to carry on .
I:18363;437;the students get behind him when the faculty doesn't want to do a first season and he does a great job at pulling that first season, after the crash, together.
I:18363;438;It certainly captures the don't give up spirit.
I:18363;439;I would certainly recommend this as a great family movie
I:18363;440;The movie is a very touching and exciting story.
I:18363;441;Being from the Huntington area myself and alive during the devestating plane crash that killed our football players, coaches and fans, it was very meaningful, and I must say, a long time coming, to see our story on the big screen.
I:18363;442;The movie is very accurate to the facts of the actual event.
I:18363;443;Many scenes of the movie were filmed locally, seeing the city transformed back into the 60's was exciting, and also brought back many, many memories.
I:18363;444;"If you loved the movie ""Rudy"" then you'll love ""We Are Marshall""."
I:18363;445;i love this movie it has a good story line.
I:18363;446;I really enjoyed it made me tear up.
I:18363;447;The movie kept our interest throughout and provided many good opportunities to discuss tough issues and positive values.
I:18363;448;I love Matthew Mcconaughey, he is exactly what this town needed.
I:18363;449;This is such a great movie.
I:18363;450;Now, 36 years later, I've been able to catch up on this piece of history.
I:18363;451;wE ARE MARSHALL is a poignant story of the tragedy and how it affected so many lives.
I:18363;452;the movie itself is very well cast and historically accurate.
I:18363;453;I believe the profound, underlying message here, as displayed over and over in life, is that humanity is at it's best when situations are at their worst.
I:18363;454;coaster, but is definitely worth the ride.
I:18363;455;The acting is good, the soundtrack is good, the script is good, even the wardrobe is good, although McConaughey and Fox should have shaved.
I:18363;456;Otherwise the movie uses its artistic licence well.
I:18363;457;"This movie is a must for anyone who enjoys other sports feel good movies such as ""Remember the Titans"" or ""Invincible""."
I:18363;458;I've seen many better sports films that are heartfelt and leave you feeling inspired.
I:18363;459;remember the event like it was yesterday.
I:18363;460;actors did very excellent jobs.
I:18363;461;It's hard to believe the incredible courage that the young men and coaches had.
I:18363;462;Fox is absolutely great as the assistant coach.
I:18363;463;This movie is inspirational, emotional and uplifting.
I:18363;464;But, Marshall of 1971 was a true winning team in every respect.
I:18363;465;The beauty of American college football is how it can lift a community from the ashes.
I:18363;466;We Are Marshall, starring Matthew McConaughey, Mathew Fox, and David Strathairn, is very well.
I:18363;467;done, and the story is inspiring.
I:18363;468;after many fruitless phone calls, the university president (Strathairn) finds a new coach .
I:18363;469;this movie is based on a true story, and I became misty.
I:18363;470;"Performances are very good, and though the cast boasts several ""stars,"" I thought the best depiction in the film was given by Anthony Mackie."
I:18363;471;It is his determination to keep the football program going that makes it a reality.
I:18363;472;, this movie is right on target.
I:18363;473;Such a great movie and at such a great price, very pleased and satisfied that I bought it :) :)
I:18363;474;I just love movies about overcoming adversity and achieving your dream!
I:18363;475;A truly inspiring story overall that made me a Marshall fan for life!
I:18363;476;I have seen this movie a long time ago and wanted to see it again.
I:18363;477;It is still good good!
I:18363;478;What works is the director's ability to capture this town's deep loss and incredible heart.
I:18363;479;It is heart wrenching to watch, but the producers have captured the spirit of the team and of the town.
I:18363;480;It was a true story and it was wonderful.
I:18363;481;I loved the way the town and team came back to life after the loss of the entire team and family traveling with the team on the plane.
I:18363;482;the kids in my fifth grade class thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
I:18363;483;The entire Marshall University community and the nation was in shock after this tragedy.
I:18363;484;McG is commended for directing this true life story.
I:18363;485;Well worth your time to watch this movie!!
I:18363;486;One of the best film's I've in quite awhile.
I:18363;487;however, I have some good friends that were students at Marshall and their son and mine are best buds, and he came and lived with awhile, for reasons I don't need to go into here except they are not bad ones.
I:18363;488;They did finally see the movie and it was quite emotional for them especially having been students there at the time this took place.
I:18363;489;A great movie about FB and the human spirit.
I:18363;490;Enough has already been commented on about the excellent casting for the film and I completely agree.
I:18363;491;The point is folks, this is a human story.
I:18363;492;a story that reaches deep inside you and grabs at your heart.
I:18363;493;It shows you their pain, which those individuals still bear today, and yet it shows their courage and spirit to continue despite adversity.
I:18363;494;I've no doubt it is true to life.
I:18363;495;I know it brought tears to my eyes, as I'm sure it will to yours.
I:18363;496;And you will admire them as I do.
I:18363;497;gift for my son and although it's an old movie I was very happy to find it and got it very quickly
I:18363;498;To those wise enough to recogize what is happening though, the movie is about how a town, a university, and many individuals experienced the five stages of grief as a result of the true event that killed a university football team and many community leaders.
I:18363;499;I thought the film makers did an incredible job of showing how each stage was dealt with both individually and communally.
I:18363;500;His belief, effort, and result is truly inspirational.
I:18363;501;Watch the movie and discover their lessons.
I:18363;502;matthew McConaughey is very good.
I:18363;503;my ten year old loved it.
I:18363;504;I love true stories, so this was a winner right there.
I:18363;505;This movie was well written and very well played.
I:18363;506;LOVE, Love, loved this movie
I:18363;507;I highly recommend this flick.
I:18363;508;The full grievous effects were still felt by the viewer due to the touching introduction of the players, the fans, and the overall small town U. s. a. atmosphere that this college, this town, and the players shared.
I:18363;509;"one of the most touching scenes of human decency in the film, is when the new head coach, Jack Lengyel and Red, were having a tough time getting the new team's ""veer"" offense running the following year, so Jack came up with the unheard of idea, of going to see their in."
I:18363;510;The impact of that stunning scene brings tears to your eyes and a pang in your heart.
I:18363;511;"And that's the best thing I can say about this movie
I:18363;512;This is very well done and it shows how they rose from tragedy together, they define spirit, dedication and team.
I:18363;513;One of the best movies ever!!
I:18363;514;I have seen it a dozen times on tv and it just doesnt come on often enough so I bought it!
I:18363;515;Excellent movie about how to deal with grief.
I:18363;516;You will cry but also love the movie.
I:18363;517;Its a feel good movie, a teensy bit over long, but stillVERY entertaining Movie .
I:18363;518;I highly recommend people to get this movie and havea good time watching it!
I:18363;519;Needed it for a report, very good movie and we got it in two days.
I:18363;520;This is one of the very best movies I have seen.
I:18363;521;we were teenagers and kids when the crash happened, and I was interested in seeing how they handled it.
I:18363;522;goers for the story and the loss as well as the resurrection of a whole generation.
I:18363;523;The other reviews will tell you so.
I:18363;524;All the music is great!
I:18363;525;I have a growing sports movie collection and this is one of my favorites.
I:18363;526;This movie puts a fire under you and inspires one to keep on pushing.
I:18363;527;I don't rate many movies.
I:18363;528;But after I saw this one, I felt compelled to say thank you for telling this story.
I:18363;529;It is by far one of the most important of our time.
I:18363;530;Excellent film for the whole family.
I:18363;531;Young boys especially love it.
I:18363;532;I gave it as a gift.
I:18363;533;but the movie is great.
I:18363;534;for some reason the Movie would never load, this is the first time I have had this happen with Amazon as I have streamed multiple movies I rated the Movie 5 stars because the movie itself is wonderful and this would have been a re watch
I:18363;535;Let me first make clear, I usually am no fan of Matthew McConaughey, the guy drives me nuts, but in this he really fits.
I:18363;536;I highly recommend this uplifting film, I really cant imagine anyone not being moved by its narative.
I:18363;537;The casting is excellent and the acting captivating.
I:18363;538;Matthew McConaughey is really good in this movie.
I:18363;539;It's true, it's inspirational, and it is a GREAT movie about life in general.
I:18363;540;You will love this story and want to watch it over and over.
I:18363;541;The film is a inspiration to all who believe in overcoming obstacles.
I:18363;542;An especially poignant movie that shows a determination to recovery from tragedy and adversity.
I:18363;543;Good acting and a movie that will keep you interested.
I:18363;544;Moving emotional uplifting entertaining powerful inspirational sometimes funny movie for the whole family about a true story would watch again
I:18363;545;Great movie for any sports fan to see to appreciate how far the Marshall University football program has come.
I:18363;546;"This movie is a really great movie
I:18363;547;I liked the movie because it's a true story.
I:18363;548;'s acting, and he is one of my favorites.
I:18363;549;Anyway, I would recommend it because it is a true story of triumphing over tragedy.
I:18363;550;It was a gift as far as I know the product was good.
I:18363;551;This is my favorite sports movie, Mcconaughy did an amazing job in this movie along with the rest of the cast and I really felt like I had been a part of those events.
I:18363;552;Good acting, good script, good music, blah.
I:18363;553;It has been a long time since a movie has touched me this deeply.
I:18363;554;matthew McConaughey plays an excellent role here .
I:18363;555;The entire cast gives a powerful performance.
I:18363;556;It was used, but good as new.
I:18363;557;The movie is very touching and inspirational.
I:18363;558;It's a heartfelt movie that can make you cry.
I:18363;559;A true story makes this an especially touching, though typically exhilariting and sad tear jerky sports movie.
I:18363;560;The theme blared throughout the movie .
I:18363;561;Still, a good effort that keep me watching and crying at the end.
I:18363;562;If you liked The Replacements, you'll like this .
I:18363;563;the first part is tough, but their rise from a destroyed football program is amazing!
I:18363;564;but this move captured that feeling and in a dignified manner.
I:18363;565;And it captures the long slow struggle back to getting a football team with coach Dawson.
I:18363;566;it is a story of the triumph of the human spirit.
I:18363;567;matthew McConaighey has said that it is a movie that he took pride in making.
I:18363;568;The team unites their town and gives a sense of worth to a community in the Appalachian coalfields where so many feel swallowed up by the outside world.
I:18363;569;But more than the loss of the people, the town lost its shining star, the football team.
I:18363;570;The film's more poignant moments really happened, including a great scene with then West Virginia head coach Bobby Bowden helping the Marshall coaches learn their offense and a sobering moment where two funeral processions actually meet at an intersection in the days after the crash.
I:18363;571;had the film remained true to the story and stayed away from the manufactured drama, this could have been one of the finest sports films ever made.
I:18363;572;But even with its flaws, the heart of this film is in the right place.
I:18363;573;It gets right the most important points concerning the ripple effects of the tragedy in the small town.
I:18363;574;The people of Huntington are honestly displayed, as is their pain, hope and belief.
I:18363;575;The story is very appealing.
I:18363;576;But it's still well worth watching.
I:18363;577;I think that the movie is awsome and very well done, I also believe that it is a must own movie.
I:18363;578;the greatest bouyancy factor in this film is Matthew McConaughey himself, and is the perfect candidate for the coach who revives the team.
I:18363;579;The college president, David Straitharn, also pulls through and adds immensely, as does Anthony Mackey as Nate.
I:18363;580;All the new players that are recruited are so one.
I:18363;581;In other films of this ilk(Mighty Ducks comes to mind) the characters are given greater depth and add to the movie by their presence.
I:18363;582;Adding to the irony is the ending itself, which despite being a powerful clincher, proves that this film would have been even more powerful as a documentary, given the heart.
I:18363;583;wrenching course of events it's based upon.
I:18363;584;McConaughey nails this role, bringing the enigmatic coach to life.
I:18363;585;It has been a long time since I have seen an actor be so good at playing emotionally conflicted characters.
