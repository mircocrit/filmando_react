9;rate copy of it, or possibly a pirated copy.
10;some really great, others very blah.
11;I found both these items to be very good.
12;the book well that my family history been a BERGOFF.
13;The second one well that took me back to my younger days
14;This film was a deserved success and a revolutionary approach in film making.
15;It integrated songs into the story and created a product that was greater than the sum of its parts.
16;It observed the classical unity of time, place, and action.
17;Some will go on to college and have a bright future possible in those times.
18;Others will remain and work in middle.
19;The 1960s represented the best years of their lives for most people, as measured by the wealth of ordinary people.
20;Its a Wonderful Life compressed people's lives into one film.
21;The MovieHe had real promise.
22;American Graffiti is the finest high school hang out movie of them all.
23;There are several career making, and even career defining performances from the broad ensemble.
24;"Charles Martin Smith's ""Toad"" is my favorite."
25;There is something truly authentic about the experience here that, even though it is peppered with classic detroit iron from days long past, it feels timeless to me.
26;What could have been George?E Tu Jar Jar?The Blu RayOverall, it's a pretty clean presentation, with some soft shots with the opening credit opticals and some of the longer lens shots.
27;This movie brings back so many memories.
28;such a simpler life in those times.
29;Excellent blending of teens all across America in the early 60's.
30;the music was all choreographed perfectly with the scene/drama.
31;Great REAL CARS that I can relate to and still enjoy today!And what a cast.
32;richard D, Ron H, Candy (I still see her at car shows autographing white '58 Impalas.
33;the enduring success of this film is largely owed to the writers' letting the 6 protagonists' own lives suggest what was to follow by the decade's end.
34;Fresno was the ideal choice for AG's mise.
35;it was also the right touch to have disc jockey Wolfman Jack as a sort of Greek chorus .
36;This reach projected the new youth culture across the continent, challenging local traditions.
37;This movie is a masterpiece that perfectly and nostalgically recreates 1962!
38;This movie has it all, superb acting, an incredible soundtrack, a perfect balance of humor and drama, and a whole lot more.
39;ins, and the most memorable rock 'n' roll hits of the era in this must.
40;American Graffiti is a classic for any age, and we highly recommend it for all to enjoy.
41;almost a documentary style, that just worked well together.
42;i'm happy to say that after over 30 years the movie still holds up.
43;There's just something magical about it.
44;The dialogue is well written.
45;The movie is tightly edited.
46;It propels you along, despite its very episodic structure.
47;And even though it's set in the late fifties it resonates as a really good representation of youth.
48;When you look around at the world of 2012 it truly reminds you of a time when life was simpler and maybe a little more real and present.
49;highly recommended for old and young viewers.
50;I do love the way the movie was directed.
51;I really loved that idea and found it unique.
52;The characters were likable for the most part .
53;This is the first and last time I watch this movie.
54;I was born in `63, as a matter of fact, and I was 10 when George Lucas' American Graffiti was released.
55;I did not go to the movies much in 1973, but I saw this wonderful film when it was broadcast by ABC some years later.
56;Happy Days starred Ron Howard, who (as Ronny Howard) had second billing in Graffiti, while Laverne and Shirley costar Cindy Williams was the female lead.
57;the other two subplots of this wonderful film center on Toad (Charlie Martin Smith) and John (Paul Le Mat).
58;His attempts to impress the lovely Debbie (Candy Clark) are hilarious .
59;all these stories will converge in a climactic, winner take all race, and several Lucas touchstones will resurface in his later Star Wars series .
60;lucas uses music here very effectively.
61;This film is fun to watch and definitely deserves having been votes as one of the American Film Institute's top 100 Films of All Time.
62;"Watch it with a friend or alone, and if you were of age in the 1960s, answer the movie's famous log line: ""Where were you in `62?"""
63;after I moved to California and went into the Marine Corps to fight in Vietnam.
64;There must be so many of us with similar stories.
65;give this movie a watch.
66;ray version, give it a try.
67;the opening scene sets the whole film up.
68;mannered (mostly), middle class crew of 1962.
69;Come on now, this is wide open.
70;Jesus, do I have to tell you everything.
71;they come in one and twos, mainly, in some of the best.
72;"And besides that, many of them, the cars that is, are ""souped."
73;"up"" (look that one up yourself), especially valley hot."
74;king of the hill, John (played by Paul LeMat), and his yellow (mustard yellow, wow, can you believe that?)
75;a. day world intrudes, even on sanctified teen life.
76;This is a marvelous story about hitting life at that exact moment when its possibilities seem endless.
77;Curt's ambition is to shake President Kennedy's hand.
78;Big John wants to stay king of the highways.
79;Their plots and destinities collide in funny and heartbreaking ways.
80;American Graffiti was an important movie, too.
81;It made stars of Richard Dreyfuss, Cindy Williams and Mackenzie Phillips, and introduced Wolfman Jack to a new generation of fans.
82;Graffiti is best seen and enjoyed in widescreen.
83;This is a great movie for rodders and street rodders it will take you back to the good times as teenagers and thier rods and the time fun that it was cruisin main street down town.
84;Its funny and just all around awesome!
85;This is one of my favorite movies of all times.
86;It is such a fun movie to watch I can watch it over and over.
87;I recommend it to everyone.
88;Great film to transport you back to the good times!
89;So many things in the movie were true to life for me!
90;great movie and it was enjoyed by all that previewed it for our annual Halloween motorcycle costume ride at the end of the month
91;I will start off by saying I really love this movie.
92;i give it 4 stars because the film is great, having a digital copy is awesome, and the price is amazingly reasonable.
93;a great movie but a bit exaggerated for those of us who lived thru this.
94;younger people prob would enjoy it too.
95;ray version of this classic iconic movie is a must have for any collector.
96;The image transfer is impressive especially considering this movie was shot mostly at night.
97;You want to stop the film and admire the cinematography.
98;American Graffitti is now better than ever if that is even possible.
99;ray in and your spirits willl go up.
100;So many laughing out loud moments.
101;I LOVE American Graffiti and was so excited about watching it.
102;I realize this is mostly set at night, but I had previously watched this on Direct TV, and remember it to be much brighter, crisp and clear.
103;Brings back a lot of memories.
104;This is just a fun movie .
105;`American Graffiti' is one of those films I had yet to see it and had very little desire to.
106;i have to say, maybe it is the nostalgic fact that I grew up on `Happy Days' reruns but the minute I saw Opie I was kind of smitten with this movie.
107;`American Graffiti' sets its sights on an era and uses the lens to expose the passions, joys, pains and ultimate maturing of a time and space and all the people caught within it.
108;This feeling is really aided immensely by the glorious soundtrack that accompanies each frame.
109;i must admit, I was kind of in love with Richard Dreyfuss's face here.
110;He just dripped charm and charisma all over the place, and his performance really anchors this film.
111;the central themes and life lessons contained in the film are beautifully captured by a few moments of subtle obviousness.
112;Great start for those now very famous and talented stars, i. e. Harrison Ford, Richard Dreyfuss, Ron Howard etc.
113;Grew up watching this movie.
114;Its a classic and has alot of good actors who went on to greatness.
115;"George Lucas's harking back to the days of his own youthful years in small town America remains a fascinating look at ""cruising"" and the American teen ""Rock'n'Roll"" lifestyles of the late 50's/early 60's."
116;Set in the 1960's, 'American Graffiti' is as much about the end of the 50's as it is about the end of the teenagers school days and their excitement, trepidation and anticipation of the immediate future that awaits them.
117;the story, like all of Lucas's stories, is very simple.
118;But, it's handled with great care and allows the viewer (even those who have never experienced 50's America, like me) to become engrossed in the accounts of the young men and how they deal with the evening's events.
119;It's also helped by the fact that 50's vehicles and buildings are included in the film too.
120;opened just for the film (and demolished after it wrapped) and the charming 50's cars on offer make all the difference.
121;Great shipping and handling perfect shape it was a good movie to watch and brought back lots of memories watching as a child
122;I love it, everybody should watch this movie, this is a super awesome move that you need to watch now!
123;Viewed: 5/05, 7/12Rate: 95/05: It is easy to see how American Graffiti spawned The Breakfast Club, Dazed and Confused, Can't Hardly Wait, Pretty In Pink, and Lord's of Flatbush among high school films.
124;A few characters, not all, sparked appeal for me.
125;I enjoyed the film in some ways.
126;John Milner, played by Paul Le Mat, was a great character, a real Fonz.
127;The others were fair but likable at the same.
128;Harrison Ford played himself very cool, especially with the cowboy hat.
129;Somehow, American Graffiti didn't really hold together, considering some great laugh.
130;out aloud moments, a few terrific characters, and the wonderful mood.
131;Of course, it showcased a very sensational idea of being taken along car rides and to various happen.
132;Overall, American Graffiti, in many ways weak, was watchable in an enjoyable manner.7/12: There is something nostalgic about American Graffiti whether it's the cars, the cruising around, the drive.
133;ins, the rock `n roll, the 50's feel of the 60's, the innocence, or the characters.
134;One thing is undeniable about the film is it is a timeless classic.
135;It has a great cast of characters engaged in random events.
136;I'm undecided who is my favorite character: John Milner or Joe, the leader of the Pharaohs gang.
137;Both are cute for what they portray as.
138;But Joe was pretty good.
139;One favorite tandem will be Paul Le Mat and Mackenzie Phillips.
140;All in all, of all films, George Lucas should consider American Graffiti the best work of his career.
141;American Graffiti is really the sort of film that can be regarded as a classic, without its actually being particularly great.
142;It's entertaining, and it makes you laugh, but it's very corny at times, none of the elements are particularly well done, in fact the only reason it's so famous is that it's a clear sign of the times both in which it was made and in which it is set.
143;the various stories it tells about four friends at life's crossroads in the sixties, and the events that befall them on one particular night, are all really quite good.
144;so overall, despite occasional hammy acting or corny line, American Graffiti is definitely worth a look.
145;A sign of the times though it is, it still gives you a good time and a good feeling all these years later
146;Item was new in original package.
147;Price was the best I could find.
148;dawn marathon, the guys face their respective rites of passage .
149;Wolfman Jack's part is truly moving and makes this a classic.
150;Richard Dreyfuss' first major role is truly incredible.
151;The rest of the cast is just as believable.
152;This classic timepiece spurred the entire 50s retro movement in the 1970s.
153;My favorite movie of all time .
154;i grew up in the 60's, and relate to this wonderful movie.
155;I love everyone in it, and sometimes play it just to have the music playing while I'm doing housework.
156;Great plot, great acting, and love Modesto for the small town set.
157;I have to say that this movie is truly one of the best nostalgia stirring movies I have ever seen.
158;This is where George Lucas' brilliant Hollywood career really got started.
159;This is a magical film that is still fresh today as it was many years ago.
160;The storyline is pretty much about a bunch of California teens in the summer of 1962 who are on the verge of impending adulthood.
161;Everybody can relate to that story in some form or another.
162;The greatest thing this film has going for it is the incredible cast : Ron Howard, Richard Dreyfuss, Harrison Ford, Cindy Williams, Paul LeMat, Mckenzie Phillips, Candy Clark, and, of course, the hilarious Charles Martin Smith.
163;This is a feel good and very nostalgic film that can be viewed over and over again.
164;Absolute classic about young peoples' hi.
165;The soundtrack is great as well.
166;Sweet life in California in the Fifties and Sixties, future stars in action with their first roles, and beautiful cars
167;What are the consequences of your intent and then final action on friends and loved ones.Yep everyone sees themselves in this movie.
168;This is one of the closest depictions of life with out me having to pull out the 8mm and filming.
169;i am more surprised that George Locus could capture this so well.
170;Most of them went off to do bigger and better parts and it is fun to watch this film in hind sight.
171;getting away from memory lane, the film is so smooth that you forgot that you are watching a movie and the actors do not overwhelm the characters that they play.
172;Having Wolfman Jack there added a touch of reality.
173;This is true of any group in any era.
174;I love the movie but even though I could hear and enjoy the music the speaking parts were hard to impossible to hear at times.
175;Hubby asked for this for Father's Day and found it on Amazon!
176;This film shows the potentially great artist that we lost to capitalistic greed.
177;"It certainly adds to the poignancy of this film's nostalgia for ""simpler"" times."
178;feature including also More American Gaffiti!
179;This sophomore film project from director George Lucas is a testament to the world of cinema being the first film to pretty much feature simultaneous stories going on at one time (nowadays, they have this setup on sitcoms all the time), the first film to have an entire soundtrack of classic rock n roll and pop music in the background, and the first film to technically have a popular TV sitcom spin.
180;To put it in the simplest of terms, this film is a pure rock n rollin' good time!
181;Bought this years ago for my husband who was and still is a huge fan of this movie .
182;I was 17 during the summer of '62, and this excellent movie seems more like a dream than an actual film.
183;It captures the feelings, the personalities, the innocence better than any film of this type.
184;George Lucas' lighting and pacing throughout this wonderful film casts a surreal, dreamlike feeling.
185;The characters are believable, despite a cast of future all.
186;There's the common guys like Ron Howard and Richard Dreyfuss, the nerds, the hoods, and the local hot.
187;The music soundtrack features many of the 50's and 60's great hits with a hint of reverb adding to the dreamlike atmosphere.
188;A poignant film, that leaves you emotionally drained at the end.
189;The cars and the atmosphere are something to behold.
190;The bonus materials are also a pleasure with a surprisingly long making of the film.
191;Love the cars and the music.
192;This film boasts a cast.
193;The most important character is John(Paul Le Mat)Milner.
194;He remarks in one scene I ain't goin' off to some GD fancy college!I'm stayin' right here!Havin' fun as usual!
195;What makes this film work is the way it is done.
196;End captions before ending credits roll is a chilling sequence.
197;an excellent sequel follows(MORE AMERICAN GRAFFITTI).
198;American Graffiti is probably one of my favorite movies.
199;It is also one of my mom's which brings me to my point.
200;This movie is an enduring classic that will carry on through the 21st century.
201;Not only is the acting brilliant, it also tells a compelling teenage story.
202;The nostalgic city life in the 60's and the killer soundtrack.
203;It also hs some sweet looking cars in it as well.
204;great movie toad is the best actor great cARs and aactors love it best movie of all time for ever
205;I had to count songs in this movie to find about ten songs that are still really great, and some of those songs are used in 2004 for exercise classes at the YMCA in Saint Paul, Minnesota, if you really want to know what little old ladies listen to before they do can.
206;the best thing about this movie is that everything happens all at once.
207;i have often complained that entertainment values have become the main economic motivator of changes in American society.
208;While this movie is a nostalgia boom that won't let go of a teen culture still unaware of the changes that were going to hit American society after 1962, the success of the movie started a drive to reproduce elements of youth culture in forms that millions of people could relate to on a personal level, as a form of entertainment that is superior to the extreme themes and clear villains of myths that have an obvious message.
209;George Lucas, despite his recent Phantom Menace woes, is truly an artist of amazing sensitivity and accomplishment, as can be seen in this nostalgic look back at the summer of 62.
210;Unlike most films of this genre, Graffiti is much more than a sentimental look back at the happy days past.
211;the acting is brilliant and personally I have not seen a movie more believable.
212;The documentary style filming that Lucas uses with great skill contributes to this effect.
213;The interviews with Lucas and the cast members about the making of Graffiti is a movie in itself.
214;The recorded screentests of the cast members is a great bonus.
215;It is so easy to see why each actor/actress was perfect for his/her role.
216;"There is also an improvement in the color saturation
217;Just a fun nostalgic film.
218;fun to watch them when they were first getting their start.
219;This is just a good fun, feel good movie.
220;great careers: Richard Dreyfuss, Ron Howard, Cindy Williams, etc.
221;I'll have to admit, I wasn't much of a fan of her work in """"One Day at a Time,"""" but I thought she was perfect here."""
222;But his gravelly voice seems to grind on and on, especially towards the end, and I thought that George Lucas should have perhaps edited some of that out.
223;but still, a fun movie about surely a better time.
224;Great movie, came on time and obviously enjoyed it.
225;Delightful and insightful perspective on the beginnings of rock and roll.
226;If you were around then and enjoyed the culuture, or would like to get a glimpse into that era, I would highly recommend this film.
227;It was a very special time of innocence in our culture but also highlights the importance of standing up for what you believe in.
228;If you are a movie buff, this one's for you!
229;This movie never gets old and a lot of fun to watch.
230;Brings back a lot of good highschool memories.
231;Also, I had a lot of family that lived in the Valley.
232;I visited that area a lot growing up.
233;Just going back in time to those wonderful days that looking back now were so carefree and happy.
234;If you grew up watching happy days and leverne and Shirley you will love this movie.
235;Lots of old cars to check out as well.
236;My husband really likes this movie and the wonderful songs it contains.
237;the casting is spot on .
238;the music is nostalgic and wonderful .
239;brings back high school memories.
240;It was a time of extreme innocence, no better illustrated than when some girls trick the ace mechanic into letting a very young girl ride with him.
241;Girls hop in a car with strange guys without a second thought.
242;What makes this movie so appealing and why all of my friends went to see it several times is that all teens can relate to it, as we all went through those moments of anxiety during and after high school.
243;Watching it decades after I left high school, it brought back many memories of that time.
244;This movie very special for(Tom)me!
245;Love the movie every time I see it.
246;the music, the styles, the values.
247;Everything was perfect with this transaction.
248;This film is packed with wonderful moments that reveal a yearning for a time gone by and innocent metaphors.
249;richard Dreyfus is the soul of the film as events seem to revolve around his character.
250;with comedy, hi jinx and regret.
251;If you lived during the time this all happened you will love this.
252;I look on this movie as a part of history I lived thru and it is great fun to watch over and over.
253;Priced great, shipping and handling and received in perfect condition.
254;The cast is great, the script is great, and the music is great if you are a fan of early rock and roll.
255;Young MacKenzie Phillips is fabulous.
256;I rate this movie 5 out of 5 because it still relates to teenagers even after all these years, I believe this movie can bring generations together.
257;The most people of our generation love America and adomire american life and culture.
258;for us, this movie is real dazzling and until now, it charmed.
259;Very fast delevery on time.
260;This is a very funny movie.
261;I remember watching it @ the movie theater.
262;directed by George Lucas (Star Wars) has made an entertaining coming of age film.
263;Terrific Performances by Richard Dreyfuss, Ron Howard, Paul Le Mat, Cindy Williams, Charles Martin Smith, Candy Clark in a Oscar Nominated role and Mackenzie Phillips.
264;Watch quick for Suzanne Sommers cast as a extra.
265;This film was also Oscar Nominated for Best Director, Best Film Editing and Best Picture.
266;This is a lighthearted, likable film has become a instant classic.
267;This is a very good and funny movie.
268;Great fun movie with great music of the 50's, brings back lots of memories from my youth, you must watch it.
269;If you were a teenager in the '60's you will relive the best of those years watching this movie.
270;Film critics say this is one of the all time best movies and they are right.
271;This is one of the greatest movies ever.
272;It catches the true era of the early 60's in southern California.
273;My favorite Ron Howard movie.
274;A practice unthinkable for most of us now thanks to gas prices.
275;One of the films funniest plots revolves around Terry (Charles Martin Smith) who is usually carless being lent a car by a friend and jumping into a world that he is wholly unprepared for.
276;At first very antagonist John reveals himself to be full of empathy and seems to understand that no matter what she says Carol worships the ground he walks on.
277;The music really is the heartbeat of the film and gives the whole story a rhythm.
278;american Graffitti on the surface is just a teen comedy but the portrayl of adolescence is so blindingly accurate that it touches a cord with many people that see it over the years despite not sharing some of the cultural trappings.
279;For me it inspires a personal longing for days gone by.
280;The ending is bittersweet and the epilogue brings home the feeling that we all have when we learn that friends are mortal and that all things come to an end.
281;an excellent film and George Lucas's best outing as a director.
282;live the old days and give you inspiration for a new day.
283;A classic comedy for the whole family (grandma.
284;Would share this movie with anybody!
285;Some of the scenes should have been cut but it was cool to see the cast and how young they looked.
286;This was a gift for my friends 40th wedding anniversary.
287;A mixture of both, I presume.
288;His town is a dream come true: colourful, reassuring and without a single trace of dust.
289;anyway, the musical score is one of the trademark of this movie and adds to the nostalgia George Lucas wants us to feel.
290;warming to believe for two hours that yesterday was so nice and polished.
291;It was a good price and good product.
292;'American Graffiti' is easily George Lucas' best film.
293;'American Graffiti' is George Lucas' best film because it is 11 minutes shorter than 'Star Wars'.
294;John, the rebel, has to usher around an underage girl.
295;"Lucas has crafted a dream world here that is every much as wonderous as that of ""Star Wars""."
296;It was great to watch this classic again.
297;There are so many stars to be in this movie it was great to see them again when they were so young.

328;as a plane carries Curt to a new life, George Lucas gives the film what was an innovative twist for its time by revealing the fates of the main characters at the end.
329;flick about teens riding around in the dark has become a classic, and in honor of the 40th anniversary of its release, I pay all due homage to a cinematic piece which, although it takes place mostly in darkness, will continue to ride on and shine on for for many years to come!
330;Thanks for the memories and an excellent movie.
331;It was more or less about rich kids from the 50's, but it was still entertaining.
332;I am a senior citizen and love to delve back into my days of the 60's.
333;I love the Beach Boys and the rest of the past hits.
334;Ron Howard does a great job in this movie.
335;A great story line and it really brings you back in time, the way it was with hot cars etc.
336;age film by George Lucas is definitely a hallmark classic during the time of its release as it captures playfully what American culture was all about particularly in 1962 as portrayed by the many stories it tells.
337;aside from that,it also manages to effectively deals on the theme that many films have tried to tell which is that of change and that of where the country as well as the youth were in '62.
338;while people viewing this at present may find it ordinary as the film may not hold to present times while this review is being written,this film will always provide nostalgia and bittersweet memories for the youth of that era.
339;One of my favorite movies and have watched it a dozen times and will see it many more.
340;Watch this movie in the theater years ago.
341;Laughter is good for US all
342;"American Graffiti has always been one of my favorite movies
343;I would rate the movie itself with 5 stars.
344;There was a huge cultural confusion in the mid 1970s.
345;A great many people thought we were still in the 1950s.
346;were also responsible for Grease, Happy Days, and American Graffiti.
347;Despite this film containing a couple of great set pieces with hot rods and chicks, attention is never diverted from the good performances, particularly of Richard Dreyfuss and Ron Howard.
348;the other major star here is the Soundtrack album, which sold very well at the time, being one sure way of getting hold of those difficult to come by Rock 'N' Roll hits.
349;Despite being set nearly twenty years before it was made, American Graffiti still holds up well nearly thirty years after it was made, and is an invaluable document of what we were all doing in the 1970s!
350;GRAFITTI ALSO REKINDLED A LOST INTEREST IN THE 1950's AND 60's ERA.
351;One of my husbands favorite movies, so I bought it for him as an gift and he loves it!
352;The music in the film is superb!
353;It is the music I grew up with, even though I was born in 1991.
354;Watching this movie was like going to heaven!
355;Hearing the music of the 1950's/Early 1960's, seeing the cars driving around, and seeing a real high school dance, was a dream come true.
356;It was also cool to see Wolfman Jack.
357;The Disc Jockey use to be special and the Wolfman was terrific.
358;He played all the great Rockin' Roll and Doo Wop music.
359;If you lived during the time or you wished you lived during that time, this is the movie for you.
360;You will want to watch it again and again for the rest of your life!
361;This is the Soundtrack of our lives!
362;It is just like I remembered it to be!
363;Loved the extras at the end.
364;Everyone involved in this film is either a cult or superstar heavyweight status and have memorable careers and many shooting and character developement ideas have borrowed and owe this movie thier careers!
365;Goodnight my sweet darling and tell em' the Wolfman sent you!
366;Rock and roll beautiful cars and chicks forever.
367;Ah, life was good in the day.
368;if you want to show your kids how good life was before the Internet and cell phones then this is the movie to see with them.
369;This was and is a great,great, movie the way it was """"originally"""" conceived!"""
370;"Because of it's popularity, Lucas had to ""improve"" the already wonderful soundtrack inorder to ""repackage"" his wonderful creation."
371;"Yes, the visuals are improved but the ""new and improved audio track"" is barely acceptable which is a shame as there is so much wonderful music in this film."
372;This is one of our all time favorite movies.
373;It represents my teenage years perfectly.
374;"It's fun to see how young the ""new comers"" were, all now well established actors."
375;When I watched this movie at the theater for the first time many years ago I remembered that I loved it.
376;I love the pop music of the late 50s and early 60s.
377;But this is still a great movie especially if you appreciate this era of time in the American pop scene.
378;An all time classic story.
379;The music is amazing and it's great fun to see all the name actors that were so young and just starting there careers
380;From my generation so I felt right at home.
381;That was a wonderful time for us who can look back on it and remember all those things.
382;I have enjoyed this movie since it first aired on the big screen.
383;It takes the viewer back to a simpler time.
384;Fantastic cars, awesome sound track and a good story line.
385;Now Happy Days had it's share of stupidity, but it also grabbed our cultural attention for many years.
386;It made a lot of money because it captured the way we want to feel about a certain part of our history.
387;the movie is a classic because it lets six distinct stereotypes be fleshed out as living human beings: the intellectual, the class president, the greaser, the nerd, the good girl, the not.
388;this is a movie that has respect for it's young characters.
389;This is such a great movie to watch.
390;It is so funny and such a wonderful trip down memory lane, to see it again.
391;I loved seeing the actors again that I grew up watching on Happy Days, One Day at a Time, and Star Wars.
392;The music is upbeat and nostalgic too.
393;My teenagers enjoyed watching the movie too, and my husband and I were able to share about the good old days when as teenagers we cruised the avenue with our friends.
394;very very good movie about the teen lives from the early 60 s
395;The first movie to have an ambient musical soundtrack (there is perhaps a word for that), much like the sound that would later announce the arrival of the storm troopers in Star Wars, Lucas makes a very funny film.
396;Either way, the working class greaser gets magical powers in his Happy Days afterlife: he can snap his fingers and the girls come running, or turn on the jukebox by hitting it just right.
397;Things seemed so simple and care free in those days.
398;I loved it when I saw it in the theater when I was a teenager, oh so many years ago.
399;Dreyfuss on the other hand finds himself out in the town talking with girls and proving himself to a group of thugs.
400;A tough speedster (Paul Le Mat) finds himself driving around a 12 year.
401;Toad the nerdy one (Charles Martin Smith), finds himself spending a wild night with a nice but peculiar girl.
402;With its classic music accompanied by Wolfman Jack and the vintage cars, American Graffiti is a blast from the past.
403;I grew up during this time and to me it is a true American classic of that time period.
404;Just like the some of the actors, I headed to Vietnam after high school and grew up to the real world.
405;What a great movie to bring back fond moments.
406;George Lucas and his genius at work.
407;i grew up around this time and this moviebrings back great memories for me of cars, pretty girls and racing.
408;i suggest the dual American Graffitti movie, Both are equally enjoyable.
409;order this movie if you are a true lover on the 50's and cars this is a classic movie everyone should see
410;Now that I've seen it again after a few years, I've actually come to like this a lot as I realise that this is a very unique film with a very good storyline and good acting as well as it describes the lives of High School graduates/dropouts and their very real sense of loss having to leave the safe/secure comfort zone of school to face the real world with all its uncertainty and callousness.
411;one character actually manages to take the leap albeit with great reluctance and after great difficulty soul.
412;"I can actually see myself returning to this film again in the future as I get the feeling as with any classic that I'll pick up something again which I didn't at the previous viewing to make me enjoy this even more
413;This film is also responsible or at least very influential for """"Grease"""" and the """"Sha."""
414;"For an 80's version of this type of film check out ""Fast Times At Ridgemont High"" which is also similarly themed."
415;a redeeming factor is the Special Features section which has about an 80 minute making of documentary which I found very entertaining.
416;It nails it right on the head.
417;All of these things were captured in a fun but very capable and accurate way by the director, producers and and actors.
418;Richard Dreyfuss, Cindy Williams, Ron Howard and the rest were great.
419;What a cast of characters and what a time in history.
420;I loved it and have watched this movie more times than I can count.
421;"I highly recommend it to anyone that grew up in that era and to the young who want to see how the ""older"" generation had fun and enjoyed life."
422;Give me a car, a girl friend, friends and a few hundred cruises around the circuit on a Friday and Saturday night and there you have it.
423;This movie was created well before my time, but still held up when I was in my last semester of high school.
424;Best movie ever made about the era of the early 60s.
425;It's worth watching the movie for just the sound track and Wolfman Jack.
426;It is a blast from the 60s and it is a classic.
427;It's an American favorite among car guys, plus I have a 1955 Chevy street/strip car.
428;"American Graffiti is a classic film that in some ways, can relate to another classic: ""Rebel Without a Cause,"" both were about teenagers."
429;"In ""American Graffiti,"" within a day, all characters mature and grow up."
430;over all, both movies were superb, realistic, memorable, and will share a long lasting place in movie history.
431;The movie is as great as I remembered.
432;Service was great, recieved product in timely manner, would order again from this site
433;"George Lucas's ""American Graffiti"", more than any other film, captures what its like to be teetering on the brink of adulthood after school is over."
434;All of this is observed in a funny, heart.
435;George Lucas captured it all nicely with a top notch soundtrack of early rock and roll classics in the background, which enhances the period detail.
436;Lucas and producer Francis Coppola are interviewed as well.
437;The documentary runs about 80 minutes, and everyone involved has an interesting story to tell.
438;"Before Happy Days and Star Wars and Jaws, there was this great fun movie with Harrison Ford, Ron Howard, and Richard Dreyfuss, and cast of hundreds, not to mention ""Wolfman Jack."
439;This is a slice of the 50's when boys would be boys and girls would be the gender the boys went after, not to mention all the nonsense the teenagers were up to, like drinking, and trying to make a score, and chasing after girls in fast cars.
440;Harrison Ford has an interesting role as an arrogant, cowboy.
441;if you like the oldies, this is it.
442;If you like to laugh and giggle, this is it.
443;If you like to take a trip down memory lane, this is definitely it.
444;Get the popcorn and the drinks, and snuggle up for a nice time of entertainment!!!
445;I chose this rating on account I loved the movie since I first saw it aways back.
446;But it's still George Lucas' triumphant depiction of Teen.
447;thow only born in 61, when i started listening to my moms 45's she had in the 50's, by the early 70's, sometime i used to imagine th@ i was there in those late 50's early 60's times of Car Hops Rock N Roll and Cruisin the great cars.
448;thank You, and Happy viewing.
449;There are blue halos around the lightposts, can you believe it.
450;When it came out in theatre I think I saw it about 7 times, loved the movie and soundtrack.
451;And a yearbook is actually used in the trailer featuring the voice of Wolfman Jack).
452;In this case it's the mysterious and almost mystical Wolfman Jack.
453;Actually she did a fine bit of acting.
454;american Graffiti can so immerse you in the millieu of postwar pre.
455;radio that you'll feel a part of it even when watching it for the 45th time.
456;And today it is still a Great movie .
457;I don't know if our children born a generation ago will enjoy it, but for this 69yo man, it was a trip down Memory Lane :.)
458;This movie was before my time but I live with a man who grew.
459;I loved the characters and the story and found myself wishing badly that I could have experienced that generation.
460;I do not know why it took my better half six years to have me watch this, but I am extremely happy that he did.
461;It was a great movie then and it still is today.
462;If you like hot rods this is a good movie to enjoy.
463;ray has the best looking picture, yet!
464;I remember seeing this movie shortly after I was discharged from the military in 1974 and I remembered how great the soundtract was, blaring out at appropriate times and becoming a surrounding echo on the occasions when the cruise scenes were shot and everyone on the strip had their car radios tuned to the exact same channel that the Wolfman Jack Show was on.
465;This was a small movie in 1973, but it's charm and influence will carry it through whatever future media it is presented in.
466;So much film and television today is made with the taste of American Graffiti.
467;a classic, and always worth another watch.
468;Saw this for the first time after I bought I here, and I loved it in the first watch!
469;This is a movie that I can watch over and over!
470;The soundtrack is full of great music from the time period and tons of beautiful cars.
471;Looks like I'm the only one who didn't think this disc was so great.
472;A phenomenal movie with spin.
473;He is chasing a dream.
474;as far as the movie, I saw it in theaters when it was first released, great actors, great directing, and great story.
475;A terrific movie about teen relationships in the late fifties and early sixties.
476;Great cast, amazing music and, in general, a blast to watch.
477;If you are in your fifties or sixties, you will especially enjoy this movie.
478;I'll love and protect this movie until death do us part.
479;time favorite movies, if not most favorite.
480;It's just so great that it's incredible, it's just about perfect.
481;It's one of the most honest unpretentious depictions of youth in the history of the movies or of any other art form.
482;George Lucas really is a genius without a doubt, even if he had never done Star Wars .
483;I love this movie so much that I have to see it at least once or twice a week.
484;It's filled with fun, confusion, conflict, cars, girls, hamburger joints, high school, dancing, music, etc.
485;The soundtrack is also incredible and revolutionized the way sound and music is used in the movies, sound supervisor Walter Murch, using more than 40 rock'n roll songs to guide the movie instead of a conventional composed score.
486;The picture and sound could have been a bit better, but, overall it's very good especially since it's presented in it's original aspect ratio in widescreen so you can see the entire picture.
487;Also, it has a great making of documentary that includes a wealth of information on all aspects of the movie's production, as well as interviews with George Lucas, Francis Ford Coppola, Walter Murch, and all of the stars of the movie, and more great stuff.
488;More importantly its success gave George the money to make the greatest movie of all times, and I don't mean Apocalypse Now.
489;Now that's something to be proud of, huh?
490;In all seriousness, this movie is a true classic for a variety of reasons.
491;It looks new and therefore I assume it is decent.
492;I bought it so I can play in some of my vintage VCRs.
493;Candy Clarke should have won an Oscar.
494;A period piece for all time.
495;It captures the innocence of the 60's and youth for all time.
496;This 1973 film was directed and written by George Lucas.
497;"john Milner is the ""cool"" character in the film."
498;His adventure begins when Steve gives him the keys to his car and asks that he take care of it while he is away at college.
499;This pair creates quite a venture in their endeavor to score liquor.
500;this is a brief explanation of the characters in the film.
501;It is very entertaining and regardless of the time period when you were a teen anyone will enjoy reliving the evening with the cast of this film.
502;The film is also equipped with an excellent sound track of music from the 1950's and 1960's.
503;This movie makes you feel as though you were present with the characters throughout their life.
504;"It was my first ""R"" rated movie and the sold out theater erupted with laughter over and over."
505;The sweet promise of youth: a happy highway where I went and cannot come again.
506;That something is called growing up.
507;It is the last great American night.
508;and now they've done it again with AMERICAN GRAFFITI.
509;but AMERICAN GRAFFITI has been absolutely wrecked .
510;"It's one of the great movies, too
511;Richard Dreyfuss does a marvelous job as the nastolgic Curt Henderson.
512;He single handedly makes this film perfect.
513;in this film, Curt and his bud, played by Ronnie Howard, are finally done with school and both contemplating their futures.
514;the boys make their """"last night"""" in their hometown enjoyable by hanging with friends at the food hop, revisiting their old lockers, racing other kids up and down the strip, all while knowing fully well that they are done with highschool and the reality that comes with knowing that they can't go back to their old school days."""
515;i never lived in the sixties, having been born in 1980, but I can see what life might have been life for those of you who did by watching this film.
516;It's funny, heart warming, well acted, and extremely well written.
517;this is perhaps the most delightful movie for the look.
518;I highly recommend this film to all of you.
519;In other words, we're transported back to discover our uniquely American humanity.
520;that's the message of American Graffiti , and the reason for its success.
521;"winning author of ""Delta 7"""
522;This is a classic movie and my review in no way should detract from that fact.
523;The telling of this story is so realistic and I just loved it.
524;So true to life as I remember how it was as a young man.
525;We really enjoyed this movie.
526;Arrived on time and packed well.
527;This movie is a classic, and still entertaining today.
528;i have always loved this period.
529;perfect nostalgia piece and having experienced this era for myself I can attest to its general veracity.
530;This movie will take you back to the fun times of the early 1960s.
531;if you were a teenager or young adult during the late 1950s and early 1960s, then you're sure to remember the kind of fun that teenagers and young adults had back then .
532;In this era society was cleaner and safer.
533;Generally speaking, most people were decent people with morals and values.
534;She always used to talk at great length about all the fun times she had as a teenager cruising Woodward Ave. near Detroit, going to drive.
535;She always said that she met guys as a result of cruising.
536;She was a fan of American Graffiti and used to mention it quite frequently and said it is an accurate depiction of what cruising was like in the '50s and early '60s.
537;Even if you weren't alive back then, you can appreciate this movie.
538;There are actually four stories that are all happening simultaneously (classic George Lucas style .
539;There are a total of 41 songs that can be heard throughout the movie, and all are big hits from the '50s and early '60s.
540;The stories are very interesting, particularly the stories about the mistakes that were made in the movie, but were kept in the movie by George Lucas.
541;It's a huge event that easily attracts over a million people and is even televised locally.
542;so, if you're somebody who lived what is portrayed in American Graffiti, this movie should bring a smile to your face.
543;If you're a younger person, you need to see this movie, and I'll bet you'll like it.
544;ok, i was 19 when i first saw this in the movies so it had a special impact.
545;seeing it now in middle age it is not as powerful, but can still be appreciated on its own terms: well written, well acted, well directed, andof course that score makes one think (incorrectly) that the early days of rock.
546;Its got to be one of my favorite movies
547;American Graffiti is great inspirational classic that can really grab your attention.
548;looking cars great, and the top soundtrack is, too, but the storyline is great.
549;John gets an unexpected surprise from a Studebaker when a 15.
550;These are crazy and funny, and I love that maroon '51 Mercury.
551;This and more all leads up to the race between John and Bob Falfa.
552;This moment is stunning and a keep.you.
553;Curt meanwhile gets in touch with the blonde, but her identity is still mysterious.
554;Curt decides to go, bidding his friends and family good.
555;see coming of age story that everyone should see.
556;I saw this movie 5 times, and I got the picture how it was.
557;I loved the hot cars (especially John Milner's cute deuce coupe), and the sizzling soundtrack.
558;This movie was nominated 5 Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Director (George Lucas), and Best Screenplay (Story), If you loved living in the glory days of rock 'n' roll, get this movie!
559;I know you'll love it!
560;Great movie about my teenage years.
561;It was like a documentary!
562;American Graffiti is an absolutely wonderful movie.
563;It is a movie that you can watch time and time again.
564;They are cruising the strip, going back to their high school for the hop, meeting new people etc.
565;It is fun to see how many people from this movie became big stars.
566;You need to watch closely and you will be surprised how many stars actually make appearances in this film.
567;Get a bowl of popcorn and sit back and enjoy.
568;It sure it a good movie.
569;Bought for my Pap, but such a classic.
570;Fun way to see some now.
571;The acting is great .
572;The cars are fantastic and the soundtrack is practically unbeatable.
573;often funny, sometimes sad, but always very watchable.
574;"If you love class acting, the film's a must
575;All of the classic characters are there.
576;the popular class president, played by Ron Howard"
577;Half of the fun is the classic rock 'n roll music played in the background, along with the clothes and hairdos which are defintive early 60's.
578;"Come cruisin' with the great cast of ""American Graffiti"" and see what life was really like back then."
579;thanks for the fast delivery of this movie.
580;sure beats going to look for it.
581;American Graffiti is so great because it is a movie that doesnt age.
582;Teens of today can relate to this motion picture just as well as they could 27 years ago when this movie was released.
583;American Graffiti is a nostalgic movie that will bring viewers back to the happy days of America, even if you weren't even alive yet.
584;Another great thing about this movie is that it was the start independent film in America.
585;This movie introduced to the world a bold new un.
586;orthodoxed style in film making.
587;Even before this wonderful movie came out I wanted a T bird.
588;Sweet memories it brings back every time I view it.
589;I saw this movie when I was a teen and after all these years, it's still a feel good movie.
590;masters and transfers to Blu.
591;the commentary with Lucas is excellent.
592;This is an American treasure, now looking and sounding as good as you could ever hope.
593;A must for any movie buff.
594;This is one I watch from time to time and enjoy it every time I watch it
595;Etiher way, its a necessity in my movie collection.
596;1973 saw the release of American Graffiti, and luckily I saw it in the theatre.
597;The cast has many stars, my favorite is Suzanne Somers, memorable as the blonde in the Thunderbird.
598;A real time capsule of the 1960's/
599;I like the characters, the music, everything.
600;It was funny to watch Harrison Ford so young.
601;George Lucas' nostalgic look at the last innocent years of America is a great film, loved by critics and audiences alike.
602;It's the flubs and mumbled lines that make the classic films like this one what they are.
603;Happy Days star Ron Howard and Richard Dreyfuss and Harrison Ford (all pre.
604;famous) are all excellent in their cavellier roles, cruising around the streets while listening toWolfman Jack.
605;the endless line of great songs from the early 60s like Rock around the Clock , 16 Candles and Surfin' Safari are as memorable as the film itself.
606;time favourite films, this is a must.
607;The movie is of course a classic and always fun to watch.
608;American Graffiti is not only an American Classic, it may be George Lucas best film.
609;A very young Ricky Dreyfus and Ron Howard are the two real focal points who are bound for the East coast and college the next day.
610;Between the unbelievable Rock and Roll soundtrack and the Bravo performances this is a movie that will be just as good in 50 years as it was when it came out in 1972.
611;Also the picture looks very sharp on this new Blu Ray disc.
612;We got this from Netflix so we could see it again.
613;At our age, it brought back memories and is great to watch again and again.
614;I bought it because I love the movie, but was expecting the documentary to be only 10 minutes (which is what it is on the VHS version).
615;That's my two cents: a great movie, and an excellent supplemental documentary.
616;enjoy that as much as the movie
617;Good movie, good comedy, good story.
618;This movie launched the careers of many top line celebrities.
619;time classic film depicting the cruising era of the early 1960s in Modesto, California!
620;American Graffiti is a classic and represented a time well remembered from my high school days.
621;A wonderful and nostalgic movie.
622;I cant believe this was a hit movie.
623;Watch Happy Days, it's better.
624;Bought it for my 18 year old daughter to view, because I always liked it.
625;He managed to bring together a collection of excellent actors to show what being a teenager in 1962 was like.
626;It offers a great mix of characters.
627;college guy who is eager to experience the world.
628;It's interesting that for the guys it's about who is going or not going to college.
629;the movie interweaves a number of character's stories over their one last night before some of the guys are slated to head off to college.
630;They merge and diverge as they pass each other on the cruising strip, listen to great rock music, and have relationships form and break up.
631;As a teen watching the movie everything makes perfect sense, and as an adult watching it one sees where the logic wasn't quite all there.
632;The changes in perspective make this a fascinating film to re.
633;watch every few years and see how one's point of view about it changes.
634;the movie gets great kudos for having a wealth of strong female characters .
635;But, even so, it is amazing that throughout the entire movie the women never talk with each other.
636;i enjoy watching this movie as a view into a snapshot of time.
637;Making mistakes, lying, and finally admitting the truth.
638;This piece of nostalgia is both entertaining and sentimental.
639;Humor and emotion play an equal roll in this movie, making it heart touching to all audiences.
640;for those of us who are too young to have experienced the early 60s this film is the next best thing.
641;We get to see the styles of cars, clothing, and hair as well as hear the music of the era.
642;It's also fun to chuckle at how very little teenage life has actually changed.
643;george Lucas is a fabulous director,and the actors all deliver convincing performances.
644;regardless of your generation, watching this movie is sure to bring back a flood of memories of first loves and old friends.
645;This is great to have in your collection of oldies but goodies.
646;I have enjoyed watching it with my family.
647;I wasn't around during the 60s or 70s but I can definitely appreciate the music and cultural aspects of this time.
648;The characters could have been built up just a little more but what made the film enjoyable (for me) was the music and the cruising scenes.
649;There's no huge plot here but its a good movie to watch while eating popcorn and with friends who wish they were around in this timeframe.
650;Budget 1 MillionUS B. o. 115 MillionA fresh and innocent approach to telling a story of one night but really the story of life.
651;Great almost hauntingly real comedy atmosphere produced on a shoestring budget with a bunch of struggling unknown actors who are about to breakthrough.
652;The extras of the screen test and interviews from before the movie came out are fantastic.
653;I think this movie is one the all greatest movies in history, it is funny, and serious at times but it is always good.
654;The music is superb, and the acting is great.
655;I think Mackenzie Phillips does a really good job in this film, she is funny and kinda cute in it too.
656;The plot involves a series of vignettes, following several of the main characters whose lives are loosely intertwined, an approach rare at the time but has since become more popular with directors.
657;The sound track and music selections really support the story and action, and on a personal trivia note I have to mention I met DJ Wolfman Jack in San Francisco once.
658;I have watched this movie 25 years apart and it held up very well.
659;It is truly a blast from the past and a true American classic that has stood the test of time.
660;My husband was born in 1947 so this is his musical era.
661;The beginning of happy days.
662;Cast of great young actors and lots of cars for a story only Lucas could pull of so well.
663;Just the commentary and behind the scenes is worth watching let alone the movie.
664;star masterpiece that's almost unique in its vision of growing up in 1962 America listening to music on the radio in your car, getting up to no good and generally enjoying the sheer blast of a 'boss' Saturday night on the town.
665;It also has one of the most atmospheric and brilliantly woven.
666;much to the delight of music fans.
667;full of colour and depth .
668;grainy to a point where the fuzzy picture is 'all' you see.
669;nor does it have the beautifully cleaned.
670;as far as the BD transfer itself, it's very good.
671;Graffitti must hold the record as the movie with the most night shots ever.
672;The film is best viewed in the evening hours with light sources kept to a minimum to avoid washing out the picture.
673;During the 1970s there was a tremendous interest in '50s nostalgia, and American Graffiti hit the target dead.
674;It has been stated many times, but this film's soundtrack is without a doubt the finest collection of '50s/early '60s songs.
675;Those who were immersed in the '70s muscle car scene simply salivated at the romantic portrayal of cruising and street racing.
676;stars, it is much more than that.
677;The key story element centers around high school friends going their separate ways, leaving the lifestyle they love behind.
678;This is a truly great film by any measure.
679;Now I can share with my grandchildren what my teenage years were like, and how I meet their grand father.
680;American Graffiti is a fun movie.
681;A blast from the past.
682;Interesting to see how fantastic George Lucas was even then.
683;I like the music and the whole movie.
684;I enjoy seeing all the stars in it.
685;It is a great movie and I love the time period that it represents.
686;The movie is a classic and it is one of my favorites.
687;The soundtrack to me is one of the most important parts of this movie but on the Blu.
688;star cast, many of whom were first starting their movie careers.
689;Richard Dreyfuss was great and reminded me of several people I went to high school with.
690;wolfman Jack gives a great cameo appearance, and his voice is heard DJing on the radio throughout, giving us a medley of great 50s music.
691;classic movie, but my player (Sony BDP.
692;Love the cars and the music.
693;Very good movie that the whole family can watch and enjoy.
694;The music is exceptional movie is a must see for anyone that was in high school in the 60s.
695;The movie is great and really enjoyed it.
696;Always enjoyed it and the music of that era.
697;Lucas does an incredible job piecing these teenager's stories together, with everything taking place from the dusk of one day to the dawn of the next.
698;All the music is great, not a bad song in the bunch.
699;It truly deserves to be seen and heard.
700;Image may not be perfect but it is fairly good.
701;It's interesting to hear what George Lucas had to say in his video commentaries (= GLvc) on this.
702;create this marvelous '62 time bubble .
703;co. uk'It will provide you with expert tests+reviews and settings that can make the best of your tv set and help reduce power consumption too!
704;The songs thoughout this are excellent and tie in very well with what is going on with this movie
705;This is a great movie.
706;The music was wonderful, and it was like going back in time.
707;My pop was a baby boomer, so I grew up watching this film.
708;Even though I was born in '78, I treasure everything about this amazing movie.
709;Line for line, song for song, nothing is better crafted.
710;I've see it hundrends of times and even wrote George Lucas about it's significance, back when I was a teen.
711;American Graffiti is a tribute to the 50's and 60's.
712;All the music, the cars, and the people are exactly the way I experienced those years.
713;It's interesting to see Ron Howard and Harrison Ford in their early years.
714;This is a fun film, full of great music and actors just getting their start in the business.
715;Its a great coming of age movie done with humor and touches of seriousness.
716;Very nostalgic, reminds us of a more innocent time when kids had fun and were happy.
717;American Graffiti is one of the best 70's movies ever made!
718;The film deals with the Californian high school graduates having fun one late summer night in 1962.
719;If you have not seen American Graffiti , I suggest you see it right away!
720;I loved it because of that movie we own a 1932 Ford the movie is a classic that's for sure
721;I first saw this movie in the early 70's, loved it, but haven't seen it since.
722;This is a great classic movie and one that we wanted to have in our movie collection at home.
723;It was delivered promptly and in perfect condition.
724;This has got to be the all time best Teen Life in the 60's movie .
725;star cast, a must see, for sure.
726;It still seems fresh today.
727;the joy of being a teenager on a night out.
728;American GraffitiIf like me, you where into girls, cars and staying out on Saturday nights with your friends, this great movie will take you back to those glorious weekend nights of our youth
729;Believe me, it was fun being a teenager in the late '50's and early 60's, and this movie captures that relatively innocent fun.
730;The sound of the music, the activities, the joy of cruising, all were part of teenage life.
731;lucas did a terrific job of capturing the mood and spirit of the times.
732;He had a great cast of young actors to work with, great oldies for the musical background, and the movie shows that considerable work was done to bring it all together.
733;This is one truly enjoyable movie.
734;And that ending helps give this extremely entertaining movie a little more meaning.
735;It misses that plateau, but it still is prime movie making and well worth seeing.
736;this is a awsome movie that makes you feel right in the 50's and 60's.
737;Bought this to share with my grandkids, so they could see how it was during Gran Ma's time.
738;They thought it was good and had fun seeing the stars when they were young.
739;This is George Lucas keeping it real.
740;This film hallmarks a time period where choices have great value.
741;Enjoy the movie and savor the cars!
742;Love this movie and ensemble cast.
743;enough nostalgia piece, American Graffiti has an entirely undeserved reputation as a classic but it's sweet and enjoyable enough to be worth recommending even if it feels somewhat slow due to its unplotted, episodic nature.
744;This movie was a favorite and after seeing it again recently decided to order a Blu.
745;It was delivered in a timely manner, new as advertised, and at good price.
746;Best money I spent for a vid yet.
747;Its worth the whole price tag just to see the documentary, and see the picture of the Modesto Newspaper where George Lucas ran his old drag car into a tree.
748;I remember watching it in the theatre when it came out.
749;Copolla and Lucas got their start w this one.
750;Our favorite movie depicting the time that we were teenagers.
751;This movie brings back some special memories and is good for a million laughs.
752;Reall fun to see some great actors in their early years.
753;Ron Howard, Candy Clark, Richard Dreyfuss, Cindy Williams,and up and coming actor named Harrison Ford and a few others certainly made us go back into a time of innocence.
754;Well worth enjoying again and again!!
755;It makes the time fly.
756;and the Wolfman Jack stuff is great as well.
757;If there is anyone who was into cars back in the early 60's, this is for you.
758;George Lucas served up some really good memories with this one.
759;Most anyone you talk to, who was alive and kicking in this time frame, will recall some of the events shown in this movie.
760;"Simply good fun to watch, and some fairly ""harmless"" gags too."
761;This was as good as I had remembered it to be!
762;unknowns have gone on to stupendously successful careers.
763;it's so true to small town life in the early 60s, teenagers just having graduated from high school and about to take their first step into adulthood.
764;The whole movie takes place during one hot summer night and manages to capture the look, cars, feel, morals, music, and hopes of that era.
765;and watch it again with your kids when they ask you what it was like back in the olden days.
766;Great classic movie for car lovers and 50.60's music.
767;ray transfer of this film.
768;the image and sound are both greatly improved imo.
769;of course this is the best film Lucas has ever done.
770;From a film geek point of view I think it has the greatest sound design ever surpassing Touch of Evil and Stagecoach.
771;5 enthusiastic stars for the movie and the blu.
772;American Graffiti is one of the most touching and funny films to come out of the 1970s New Hollywood movement.
773;the film looks surprisingly good, considering the age and low budget.
774;extras are satisfying for the most part, despite the fact that the only significant new feature, a video commentary by George Lucas, covers most of the same ground as the making.
775;hey, it's American Graffiti, one of the greatest movies ever made, so it gets my recommendation based on that, but a movie like this deserves a much better release.
776;this is the kind of story you remember and go back to over and over again.
777;The movie is based on his teenage days growing up in the early 60's in a small Northern California town.
778;The movie is spiced up by its soundtrack which helped bring back the 50's nostalgia that permeated the 70's.
779;The film is an unapologetic feel good, warm movie and its major success allowed Mr. Lucas to make another little movie by the name of Star Wars.
780;This film and the Last Picture show capture the feeling of being ateenager in the late 50's in the right way.
781;And therein lies the difference betweenus and the kids who grew up in Europe in the same era.
782;Loved that movie since it first came out.
783;It's one of my favorites
784;Before George Lucas took us all to a galaxy far, far away, he made this comedy classic, which is still by far his greatest film.
785;Good story, great script, fine performances from the entire cast and of course one of the greatest soundtracks in film history.
786;A true classic in every sense and a MUST SEE!!!
787;I also hear it's funny and sad at the same time.
788;I'll have to be the judge of that,I'd imagine.
789;American Graffiti is a landmark film that marks George Lucas' debut as a major film director.
790;American Graffiti marks Ron Howard's debut as an adult film star, and his association with George Lucas inspired Ron Howard in his own director's career.
791;American Graffiti features an array of young, up.
792;"But most important, ""American Graffiti"" document's America's love affair with cars."
793;American Graffiti describes the teen lifestyle that most males want and never achieve.
794;The young men are 'good kids', but their lives are about to change permanently and their heads are whirling with the challenge.
795;American Graffiti revolves around cars.
796;Characters' cars reflect their personalities and their status .
797;cars are passports to freedom.
798;The airwaves are full of rock n' roll artists singing about cars.
799;"I love the memories that ""American Graffiti"" recalls."
800;Forget Star Wars, this could be the best movie George Lucas ever made.
801;I remember seeing it in the movie theater.
802;a lot of the themes went over my head but I still laughed and loved the characters, especially seeing Ron Howard all grown up.
803;I always remembered certain scenes.
804;The commentary track by Lucas is superb, he brings you along his struggle to make the movie and shares a lot of memories about the film.
805;The documentary is also great, more than an hour about how the film was conceived, financed, produced and released.
806;You see all the key players as they are today.
807;It was such a huge hit when released and I remember everyone in my family loved it.
808;Nearly every actor cast in this movie went on to bigger and better things: Richard Dreyfuss, Ron Howard, Harrison Ford, Paul Le Mat, Charles Martin Smith, Candy Clark, Cindy Williams and more.
809;I highly recommend the movie and this blu ray edition.
810;I have always loved this movie since I grew up in that era could relate to every part of this movie, especially those cruising scenes since I use do that in my Low Rider 1966 Chevy Impala.
811;Classic 1950's music, classic cars.
812;Loved this movie when it first came out, was great to see it again.
813;One of the true gems of the 70's.
814;It is hard to imagine the making of a movie that would combine music, cars and the sweet innocence of this time in america.
815;This is really a wonderful film, full of imaginative touches that strummed my heartstrings.
816;With the music and our knowledge of what came later, the emotional impact is quite powerful.You get a solid cast of characters, many of whom later became major stars.
817;Dreyfus is a dreamy, talented youth, unsure of what he is going to do the next day .
818;step on the airplane to collge in the East or settle down in the hometown he loves and yet has the nagging feeling he's outgrown.
819;Ron Howard, the dependable guy who is egging Dreyfus on to accompany him, faces his own dilemma with a high school sweetheart who is strong willed, manipulative, and narrow.
820;There is also a young Harrison Ford and an early effort by George Lucas.
821;The chemistry of the characters as they interact is realistic and fun.
822;There are also the themes of growing up and pulling away for greater possibilities, young romance, and looming adult choices.
823;nonetheless, I warmly recommend this film.
824;The music score plays some of the greatest pre.
825;Wow, I never knew how much changing a favorite movie into Blu.
826;Separated by nine years, the two films offer informative as well as entertaining perspectives on their respective youth cultures.
827;The screenplay and cinematography are seamlessly integrated with 4l popular tunes which comprise the soundtrack.
828;I enjoyed the humor, some of it poignant, and could identify with many of the situations which closely resemble those of my own teenage years in Chicago.
829;Of course, I have no idea how appealing American Graffiti will be to those born since (let's say) 1985 but it is still great fun for many of us born before then and will perhaps be of greatest interest to cultural anthropologists who study the teenage culture in the U. s. in the 1960s.
830;But it's still a very funny movie, and as much a period piece as Sense and Sensibility.
831;it's also a landmark in several ways.
832;The third key player is Paul Le Mat, who is outstanding as the reigning drag.
833;together with all the hijinks there is a very winning wistfulness to this movie.
834;I was looking foward to seeing this in widescreen and it was great, the picture so clear.
835;It is a blast from the 50's, simple times, a great time to grow up.
836;the director perfectly captures a rite.
837;This is one of those films where disbelief is immediately suspended and the viewer is drawn in .
838;What makes it work particularly well is the music.
839;Its a perfect backdrop and perhaps for those of us who remember sounds more than many other things its the critical factor in involving us.
840;its also a hoot seeing young Ron Howard, Richard Dreyfuss, McKenzie Phillips, Harrison Ford, and others.
841;Like Grease, this is a generational classic captured in the wild by George Lucas.
842;rock and Roll will always be deep in our hearts.
843;the past is gone: we have to face the present, but I still loved this movie.
844;The sound track alone makes this movie worth having, if you like the oldies.
845;Seeing Wolf Man Jack and all of the others who star in this movie, bring my childhood back to life for me.
846;If you are old enough it is a great trip down memory lane.
847;This was, is and always will be a great movie.
848;The characters, story, and pace make it enjoyable again and again.
849;Great movie about us teenagers that grew up in the 60's.
850;What a glorious, nostalgic, and ultimately melancholy movie this is.
851;It ranks in my top five, maybe top three films of all time.
852;I saw this meditation on early '60s California again the other night on the big screen, and realized from the other men in the audience, and from my wife's ho.
853;hum reaction, that American Graffiti appeals mostly to and is about men.
854;You can't help but feel the exciting tug of the unknown in one direction and yet understand the comfort of the routine and the familiar in wanting to stay home.
855;Anyone who left home for the big world as a teenager will understand very well what's going on in these guys' minds.
856;"Curt gets into and out of trouble with the local toughs the ""Pharaohs,"" while the characters of the outstanding ensemble cast go through their own little triumphs and failures in the night."
857;In a piece of inspired casting Wolfman Jack is a running background theme throughout the movie, except for the part when he takes center stage when Curt asks him to broadcast a message for a beautiful woman (Suzanne Somers) who's been cruising around town.
858;George Lucas captures the sentiment precisely, especially at the end after sunrise when Curt on the plane sees her one last time, driving way below him in her white T. bird.
859;The great '50s music, Toad's (Charles Martin Smith) fumbling escapades with Debbie (Candy Clark), the showdown that caps the escalating encounters between Milner and the new hot rodder in town, Bob Falfa (Harrison Ford), the warm California night, the splits and reconciliations, Carol's (Mackenzie Phillips) funny and argumentative night riding with Milner, the end and beginning of an era individually and collectively.
860;Being impermanent, one has to record it to save it.
861;The teenagers in this movie are coming of age in a fairly carefree era, one on the cusp of revolution in society and morals, an era that will end suddenly and pretty much completely in a brief time.
862;"Rolling the credits with the Beach Boys's ""All Summer Long"" was perfect."
863;I can't think of the song now without that mix of nostalgia, melancholy, and humor this movie inspires.
864;Entertaining, uplifting, funny and the cast is outstanding.
865;Time has proved that this is a great addition to your video library.
866;This is a great movie one of my all time favorites who wouldn't love this ,movie great drama and good story line
867;George Lucas, who later dazzled us with a science fiction opus worthy of the ages, first dazzled us with this intimate movie about a generation of Americans at the end of the innocent 50s.
868;Though the soundtrack, performances, set design and art direction are perfectly realized, it is the tender.
869;hearted direction and superb script of this movie that make it so lasting.
870;"Each time I see it I found it more powerful
871;But again the movie was very good.
872;My wife and I just love this movie.
873;It is quite a wonderful piece of work.
874;Lucas is able to incredibly recreate the feeling of being a 1950's kid with American Graffiti.
875;A wonderful peice reminiscent of another critical film that receives entirely too much backlash,Forrest Gump (Two.
876;disc Special Collector's Edition), both of which recreate the sense of time's past by taking a lighthearted approach to the subject.
877;ron Howard, Richard Dreyfuss, Cindy Williams, and Suzanne Somers star in Lucas's ode to the 50's.
878;it's also one of the first stories to use, what is now being called hyperlink.
879;Great film to transport you back to the good times!
880;This is the kind of movie we watch over and over, and It had really interesting facts about the movie too.
881;Carol and John are maybe the best part of the movie.
882;It's funny right from the get.
883;i definitely recommend this to anyone with a sense of humor.
884;I haven't seen this movie in many years so it was nice watching it again.
885;Despite having been told about most of the best scenes in advance by my friends, it was still a lot of fun.
886;seasons of """"Happy Days,"""" among others."""
887;a few years ago, I saw the movie again on TV.
888;I realized that, even though I was much more mature (at least physically), this movie still seemed very very good.
889;every aspect of this movie is impressive, but I'm particularly struck by the genius of George Lucas and associates when it comes to casting.
890;Every actor in this movie seems perfect for the role they play.
891;Many, particularly Harrison Ford and Richard Dreyfuss, went on to long, successful careers.
892;"depth ""extra"" on the story behind the making of the film ."
893;His success in making this movie under such tough circumstances makes the end product even more impressive.
894;"It's also very impressive to me that George Lucas went from writing/directing/creating a movie like ""THX 1138"" to this and then to ""Star Wars"" ."
895;But the fact that a movie can make you relate deeply to characters from a realistic time and place you've never been says something significant.
896;simply one of the greatest movies ever made.
897;One of my favorite movies that I can watch over and over and would liked to have lived in a time to have seen these beautiful cars
898;Hard to believe this movie is 40 years old but I'll tell you something,it's held up quite well.
899;"everything about ""AG"" is perfect."
900;"thanks to a killer soundtrack and the presence of Wolfman Jack,""American Graffiti"" remains an undisputed cinematic classic."
901;Seen the movie several times loved it and now my son wanted to see it so I passed along to him and he loved it too.
902;I bought this movie because it had been years since I saw it and my son had never seen it.
903;Reminds me a lot of the TV show, Happy Days.
904;I love to watch it over and over.
905;It is innovative story telling that tells three stories at the same time.
906;The music alone is worth watching the movie for.
907;it is a teenage coming of age show set in a small California town in the early 1960s.
908;It is really a fun show to watch.
909;in addition to the storyline, there is a lot of great classic music and some future big stars getting a start besides Dreyfuss (Ron Howard was already well known from his childhood series work).
910;Others who are in this include Suzanne Somers and Harrison Ford.
911;The legendary disk jockey Wolfman Jack also fills a cameo role.
912;It is really a good time.
913;I enjoyed this movie when it came out many years ago.
914;ray player I reccomend picking up this classic on Blu.
915;the good part about this version is that the music, which is what really makes this film along with all the nostalgia of the early 60s, is clearly recorded and without the obnoxious bass over.
916;boost that is so prevalent in so many re.
917;I donated it to my local library.
918;this flick is really great not only for it's nostalgia, but the humor and awesome cars in it.
919;This is also an early Harrison Ford appearance, if you care about that.
920;Set it up in 5.1 and you are in heaven.
921;American Graffiti is a piece of art that symbolizes a very special time in San Francisco Bay Area and American pop culture.
922;Rock roll was newly born and running strong, and Wolf Man Jack, possibly Americas greatest DJ ever ruled the Northern California airwaves.
923;Instead of leaving friends for college, most of us were on our way to basic and Vietnam.
924;Still, flick is a great rep of the day, the highjinx and pranks, parking at the lake, sock hops, drag racing, and chasing girls.
925;"I saw this ages ago, and we all grew up with ghosts of Happy Days flitting past us making us nostalgic to a California era (and its music) that occurred ten years before we were born, so it was interesting to see it again now that I too am going through a phase of listening to ""golden oldie"" bands, although in my case it's the feedback."
926;American Grafitti is a great film, full of funny characters and good dialogue, fantastic editing, and great tunes .
927;so good, in fact, that it's hard to believe that it came from the mind that produced the screenplay for The Phantom Menace.
928;"Lots of nuances, which is a word you don't often use when describing George Lucas, such as the scene when Richard Dreyfuss has a talk with his teacher, and a girl comes up at the end of the conversation and says ""teach, can I talk with you for a minute?"""
929;about it and drops the story and moves on.
930;There's also good fun when Dreyfuss (he seems to get all the best scenes) gets initiated into the local gang, the Pharaohs.
931;To inject a bit of colour, though, Wolfman Jack has a great cameo.
932;There should have been more early sixties model cars in the flick to add to the realism.
933;"I heard only a couple of songs on the soundtrack that were actually recorded during the years of 1961.1962
934;American Graffiti doesn't belong on ANY """"top 100"""" list of great films."""
935;Received the product on time and in excellent condition.
936;Very good movie, and I would do business with this seller again.
937;George Lucas is better known for his Star Wars film series but this film is far more precious.
938;It is a realistic portrayal of California teens in 1962 with their cars, radio, friendships, and relationships.
939;i believe the film's popularity is the nostalgia and memories in the film audiences of the day.
940;A lot has happened after 1962.
941;The film is about growing up, change, and life changing decisions.
942;The making of the film reunites cast and crew members.
943;It is noteworthy to learn about how the film was made.
944;I wished he made more films like this today.
945;From director George Lucas (Star Wars) and producer Francis Ford Coppola (The Godfather), American Graffiti is a classic coming.
946;nominated* for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, American Graffiti features the howling sounds of Wolfman Jack and an unforgettable soundtrack with songs by Buddy Holly, Chuck Berry, The Beach Boys and Bill Haley and His Comets.
947;hippie day with such flare and good time Friday night fun.
948;Candy Clark truly deserved her Oscar for her role.
949;Great film debut for Macinzine Phillps.
950;TV Shows like Happy Days, Laverne and Shirley, Sons And Daughters and a hill of other movies based in the era never to outdo the popularity of this movie.
951;It's all for fun anyways.
952;The happy music, the pranks, the gorgeous cars.you just get that feeling that you are there having a good time with the cast.
953;There is nothing bad to say about the movie and you will definately end the movie with spirits up.
954;well until the end credits.you'll see.
955;American Graffitti is and likely always will be one of the greatest Americana movies ever made.
956;It simply gives a a dialogue box telling me it is copywrited material.
957;I now own two copies of the same great movie, niether of which will play on the computer.
958;This is a great movie and have always wanted to own it.
959;It's in perfect condition and I've already watched it three times!
960;I was a teenager at the same time and can relate to all the characters.
961;A great introduction to Harrison Ford.
962;It left a lasting impression.
963;I believe there is a bit of American Graffiti in all of us.
964;Nostalgic, fun to watch and still holds up after all these years.
965;Check out Richard Dreyfus and Harrison Ford, among many other now well known stars, younger than young!
966;in my opinion, the best feature of this film was the soundtrack.
967;AMERICAN GRAFFITI is a classic from George Lucas, made before STAR WARS it's a warm tale of a group of friends on their last night before they go their separate ways: to University, work, etc. this movie was a roaring success, and it's not hard to see why.
968;The characters are richly acted and written, providing for some memorable comic moments.
969;By contrast, the serious moments of thinking about the future are handled well with believability making them all the more powerful.
970;the ending (I'm giving nothing away) also manages to pack a punch.
971;The American Graffiti, Fantastic movie and on Blu.
972;I just love all the oldies played in the movie.
973;I forgot how much I loved this film!
974;I needed to watch it for an assignment in Adolescent Psychology, and enjoyed every minute of it!!
975;Of course excitement for the project was reivigorated by the success of American Graffiti, but in no way owes inspiration to it.
976;as for the movie, it is nearly perfect.
977;generation before my own, it still evokes a sense of nostalgia.
978;This movie captures this concept magnificently.
979;the acting is superior, the editing great, the direction pitch perfect (why Star Wars I. vI are inhabited by wooden cut.
980;The movie is a treat and you just want it to be even bigger.
981;it's nice on a another level as it has Ron Howard and Richard Dreyfus before they became RON HOWARD and RICHARD DREYFUS.
982;With relative unknowns the performances are generally free from pretensions.
983;all around a must see movie and in my top 10.
984;i wanted to give him a good gift and get him his favorite movie.
985;I automatically thought of this movie and bought it instantly.
986;well, I decided to watch it.
987;now that i understand the lines and plot, it has become my favorite movie.
988;The story/plot hits home to just about everyone.
989;If you had friends in highschool, this movie is for you.
990;You can certainly see the seeds of that galaxy far, far away in this ensemble piece about a night a long time ago in a small town not so far, far away, but it's still got an original trilogy vibe.
991;It could almost be the Tattoine Years, with Ron Howard an embryonic Luke Skywalker, Paul Le Mat Han Solo, Richard Dreyfuss C3PO, Charles Martin Smith R2D2, Bo Hopkins Chewbacca, Wolfman Jack Obi Wan Kenobi and Harrison Ford Greedo.
992;ing between them as the night gradually turns into day, all linked by the simple but brilliant device of having all the characters have the same radio station on in the background with Wolfman Jack as a half.
993;heard Greek Chorus, binding the stories together like the Force .
994;okay, enough with the Star Wars analogies already.
995;American Graffiti is a masterpiece of innocence of a time past.
996;The cast of characters and the wonderful script along with superb acting by its cast has helped make this film a classic for future generations.
997;The eventful night when freshly graduated high school friends contemplated their futures while immersed in small town America's car.
998;wop music (the soundtrack is one of the best featured in ANY film!)
999;richard Dreyfuss is perfect as the smart kid, ready to drive off to college the next morning, but wondering if he's doing the right thing.
1000;Ron Howard and Cindy Williams get some practice for their soon to follow Happy Days , while Charles Martin Smith and Candy Clark are wonderful as the goofus who wants to show a pretty girl a good time.
1001;This film is a big winner in my book!
1002;So many big stars had bit parts or got their starts in this movie.
1003;"Before Lucas' world wide phemoneon was seen by millions, a box office classic hit he directed was seen in 1973, a film that read ""where were you in 62"" ""American Graffiti"" a fun drama showcasing the rock 'n' rollin and wild teen scene of 1962."
1004;a triumphfant classic that teens in 62 should be proud of.
1005;If you loved Star Wars then see Lucas' early american classic.
1006;The story line, the nostalgia, the stars at the beginning of their careers and the fabulous music.
1007;I do love the look of this transfer.
1008;Disconcerting, to say the least.
1009;But, in this day and age of hi.
1010;Everyone seems to love it but me.
1011;STOP tinkering with these classic films!)
1012;is this Classic film worth an upgrade?
1013;If you love this flick like I do, the BD is a must own.
1014;terry The Toad still makes the best screen entrance in film history.
1015;fun than what lot of the kids now have.
1016;I watch every winter, it helps me get through it!
1017;It manages to be both a bittersweet and quirky dose of how things were idealistically and the kind of concerns that would spiral into an 18 year old's mind.
1018;By far, it is the perfect teen film or comedy there is under a critic's viewpoint but under mine too with its moments of emotional gravity, humour, believable yet corny performances (esp.
1019;A great movie, It's defenatly my favorite,ive seen it about 10 times so far.
1020;My favorite charachter is John Milner(Paul Lemat), he is the best.
1021;The music is great, it's The old time of rock and roll.
1022;It was probaly Paul Lemats best.
1023;I think another great part of the movie is that some famous stars today were just starting out, like Harrison Ford or Richard Dreyfuss,and Ron Howard.
1024;The plot is basicly teenagers after graduation just staying out and having a fun time, like all night.
1025;Fighting ,fast cars, custum hotrods,dancing, true love, drag racing, freindship, hold ups.
1026;A lot of good stuff.
1027;I thank every one who made it or helped make it.
1028;Great music, a great story, and terrific acting.
1029;It really puts you right into the late 50's.
1030;He was one of the best.
1031;This movie is a classic and changed the way movies were edited.
1032;Still enjoy watching it though.
1033;Great music from my past, enjoyed the movie also.
1034;funny to see some of the actors as uyoung kids.
1035;The film encases many of things that we thought was important when we were young.
1036;And then took a girl to see it.
1037;All in all, I paid eight times to see this on the big screen in about eight weeks.
1038;It made a few careers, not the least being Mr. Lucas himself, and introduced some important entertainers to the screen.
1039;The music score of pioneering rock numbers is as good on its own terms as the movie is.
1040;I still enjoy it when it shows up on cable television.
1041;Having lived as a teenager in the 50's, I can definitely relate to this movie.
1042;It's a great depiction of what life was really like back in those days.
1043;The movie stirs up a lot of happy memories for me of the good ole days when you enjoyed the simpler things in life and friends really meant something to you.
1044;The choice of cast members is great, the music is great and the story.
1045;This is the start of so many things that made the 70's and 80's movies special and started George Lucas in the film industry.
1046;It showed the talent the creator of Star Wars had in it's depth and reality of emotion and life in the 50's of America.
1047;It is the regular full length movie with additional features at the end explaining how, where and when the movie was filmed.
1048;There were funny stories about the process you wouldn't have known without this.
1049;What can I say: a blast from my past that is always fun to watch, and doesn't have a lot of what Hollywood considers 'entertaining' today.
1050;Made in the 70's but set in the 60's, this film still entertains.
1051;i first saw it at age 13 (about 5 times) when it first came out and now watching it again it reminded me how I was introduced to some incredible music at a young age and how much I wanted to be just like those 16 year olds in the movie!
1052;The soundtrack in particular has stayed me with ever since as one of the best collections of music from the late 50's and early 60's.
1053;most memorable moments with the perfect matches with music include: At The Hop, Green Onions, Smoke Gets In Your Eyes.
1054;Wow, how huge were they then!
1055;A Smart Car would have fitted in the boot of one.Yes, It feels like a Hollywood movie with the Hollywood ending, but the journey is a great revisit of a long gone innocent era.
1056;this film will always be in the top 5 movies ever for me and mainly because of the soundtrack.
1057;a thoroughly wonderful trip down memory lane for anyone who wanted to rollerskate as a waitress or drive a hot rod while listening to Wolf Man Jack play awesome tunes.
1058;office success and after several rejections, he managed to impress Universal studios enough to finally get his next project off the ground.
1059;at it's core, American Graffiti is perhaps George Lucas' most personal film to date .
1060;making it the most profitable film in Hollywood history.
1061;Perhaps most important of all: after seeing a screening of American Graffiti Alan Ladd Jnr, a development executive at 20th Century Fox, was impressed enough to give Lucas the money to develop the script for Star Wars.
1062;a mythic time of pre.
1063;vietnam innocence, Graffiti is an incredibly simple film, dealing with a group of teenagers' coming of age in a small town.
1064;The music used perfectly underscored all of the major events in the film, each moment having an appropriate soundtrack.
1065;"Along the way Lucas managed to capture the arcane rituals and obsessions of American youth
1066;even after an enthusiastic response from a test audiences.
1067;Today, it's with a great deal of satisfaction that he declares: """"those mutilated versions don't exist anymore."""
1068;THE STORYThe film opens at Mel's Drive.
1069;As the night's cruising gets underway, we learn that there is a new hot.
1070;he also manages to get Steve's car stolen.
1071;the two cars pulling up to the start.
1072;tHE CAR'S THE STARAs you might expect, the real stars of American Graffiti are the gorgeous cars that fill nearly every frame.
1073;This film is quite simply a car.
1074;The end result is that, watching American Graffiti you can't help but be drawn into it's colourful world of fast.
1075;The real strength of any film is in making you feel close with to the characters in it, and Graffiti does this in spades.
1076;This movie helped George Lucas move onto bigger and better things (like the Star Wars saga) and helped make stars out of Paul LeMat, Mackensie Philips, Harrison Ford, Candy Clark, and Richard Dreyfuss (I didn't include Ron Howard since he was already well.
1077;This edition also features interviews with Howard, LeMat, Philips, Williams, Smith, and Lucas, explaining the making of this classic movie.
1078;The basic theme of this film is .
1079;It was the end of cruising, a very popular American mating ritual.
1080;And although it is a comedy, it is also a drama and its the best kind of drama.
1081;This film perfectly showcases the end of the GOlden days in AMerica.
1082;Superb acting, directing, and the ammount of classic cars and classic rock n roll tunes from the 50's and 60's alone is worth 3 stars.
1083;You will want to see it over and over again.
1084;It is truly an American classic from one of America's Greatest Filmakers!
1085;American Graffiti brilliantly portrays that brief moment of innocence in American history.
1086;Every viewing of the film is a revelation.
1087;Many acting careers began with this movie, including those of Richard Dreyfuss, Ronny Howard and Harrison Ford.
1088;this American classic is worth another viewing, but don't miss The Making of American Graffiti, which is the model for how bonus features should be made.
1089;It features interviews of the filmmakers and actors in the film and reveals Lucas's unorthodox casting and directing style.
