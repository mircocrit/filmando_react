I:20958;1;This new version comes with quite a few extras that adds to the film, including the trailers which are awesome.
I:20958;2;a great movie for the James Bond purist.
I:20958;3;Bond arranges a golf match, flashes a gold bar, and out.
I:20958;4;Discovery leads to action, and a car chase, then capture.
I:20958;5;Normal prosaic life forms a background to villainy, as in a Hitchcock movie.
I:20958;6;The criminals who help in this scheme are paid off then their job is done.
I:20958;7;Of course, this scheme is foiled by the superhuman action of James Bond.
I:20958;8;"henry A. Zeiger's book ""Ian Fleming The Spy Who Came in With the Gold"" provides a literary analysis in the last chapter."
I:20958;9;Read it to understand Fleming's novels.
I:20958;10;How incredible in those days!
I:20958;11;It's a legendary movie and highly recommended.
I:20958;12;First, the theme song is amazing.
I:20958;13;Great plot, superb cast, and what can you say about a Bond girl whose name is Pussy Galore?
I:20958;14;Sean Connery is the best.
I:20958;15;This film is probably the most famous and popular of all bond films.
I:20958;16;No doubt a good movie, but not nearly as good as Thunderball.
I:20958;17;Pussy Galore is awsome, one of the best bond girls.
I:20958;18;Still an enjoyable bond film, but not the best.
I:20958;19;This is one of the old Bond classics.
I:20958;20;The cars, the women, the gadgets and who could forget the plot!
I:20958;21;The hallmark film that really propelled James Bond into the movie industry stratosphere.
I:20958;22;Sean Connery is at his most witty best and teamed up with the strikingly attractive Honor Blackman,probibly shows the best sexual tension moments that have ever been scene in the whole franchise.
I:20958;23;The ultimate star of this epic has to be the Aston Martin DB9, a fighter plane on wheels.
I:20958;24;Americans just fell for it and with Guy Hamilton directing, they really got it right.
I:20958;25;This is his best outing.
I:20958;26;GOLDFINGER has a great script, villain, girls, location, gadgets, music and action.
I:20958;27;well Goldfinger does the business and creates the structure that still survives almost 40 years on.
I:20958;28;The plot fairly flys along allowing us to enjoy the fast pace that this super.
I:20958;29;spy copes well and keeps us constantly entertained.
I:20958;30;a movie you can watch with real acting!
I:20958;31;conary is brilliant as usual.
I:20958;32;he was the best bond ever!watch it again
I:20958;33;This was a creative approach at the time it was produced.
I:20958;34;Sean Connery was a really great 007.
I:20958;35;If you are a 007 fan and haven't seen this in years, give it a viewing.
I:20958;36;the video is a pretty good print considering the era making for good watching.
I:20958;37;Fun to watch all the characters 30+ years younger.
I:20958;38;Connery's best Bond film, and possibly the best of all of them.
I:20958;39;, featuring the ideal villan (or villans, if you include Odd Job) and the best actor ever to play James Bond.
I:20958;40;50 years later and it's still watchable .
I:20958;41;The best line ever in a James Bond movie is spoken here, of course, in response to Ms. Galore revealing her full name to Bond .
I:20958;42;I love all of them but Sean Connery ones the best.
I:20958;43;My husband loves almost all of the James Bond Movies.
I:20958;44;The movie showed very well.
I:20958;45;sean Connery wasn't so much acting as playing himself as Bond, and throughout his career, and it works well.
I:20958;46;This is THE James Bond movie.
I:20958;47;Best Bond, best villian, Top 5 Bond girl, and a fantastic plot.
I:20958;48;The music goes along with the action incredibly.
I:20958;49;GOLDFINGER is THE James Bond film!
I:20958;50;"Everything that is needed to create the perfect thriller is here
I:20958;51;Goldfinger performed by Shirley Bassey is wonderful.
I:20958;52;The best of the series!
I:20958;53;This and Diamonds are Forever have to be some of the funniest films of the whole series, but anyways to the plot.
I:20958;54;This is a great cover for the price.
I:20958;55;The color is also very true and very nice looking.
I:20958;56;Would recommend this to others!
I:20958;57;It's the third in the series, but this is *the* definitive Bond movie.
I:20958;58;This was the first movie to establish many of the things we associate with Bond, like the car, the theme song, the crazed villain, and an out.
I:20958;59;As such, this movie sets the template for all the rest of the movies in the series.
I:20958;60;Shirley Bassey's theme for the movie is a classic and one of the best from all the movies.
I:20958;61;And this is the best Bond picture most people claim to be?
I:20958;62;Probably the best part of the film was when the girl got covered up in gold paint.
I:20958;63;That was a classic moment of a Bond film.
I:20958;64;Oh yes, the car, 1963 Aston Martin DB5, was a real beauty and a can't miss.
I:20958;65;"A lot of people thought Oddjob was the most memorable Bond villain and the best one too
I:20958;66;Move on and do the job.
I:20958;67;All in all, Goldfinger is an overrated Bond flick.
I:20958;68;This is my favorite of the Bond franchise.
I:20958;69;Sean Connery was so slick, charming, smart, and dashing.
I:20958;70;He is absolutely my favorite Bond character.
I:20958;71;He did this all in the duty of his Country, England.
I:20958;72;Good luck with that one in real life, ha, ha.
I:20958;73;I think the main characters did a fine job acting in this film.
I:20958;74;tech thrills and chills such as some of the other Bond movies, but for that time period, this one is a keeper.
I:20958;75;GoldfingerSean Connery returns to play the super.
I:20958;76;He is, a great Sean Connery Fan and has all the Connery films in his collection.
I:20958;77;Bernard Lee returns as M and Lois Maxwell as Miss Moneypenny.
I:20958;78;The script by Paul Dehn and Richard Maibaum is well plotted and entertaining.
I:20958;79;But the best part is still the titles.
I:20958;80;John Barry wrote the great music.
I:20958;81;Dashing spies, beautiful women, criminal masterminds, gadget cars, and unforgettable one.
I:20958;82;Bond flicks of this age were less about action and special effects and more about solid plots, classic lines, memorable (if sometimes unbelievable) characters, and they had much more clever humor.
I:20958;83;The story can get pretty silly at times but it has the spark and charm of the characters and plot to make you completely forget the silliness.
I:20958;84;a classic opening with Bond blowing up a criminal HQ with plastic explosives, exchanging clever lines with contact, making out with a beautiful girl, and killing a villian in a dramatic fashion is what your treated to in the first five minutes of the film.
I:20958;85;Then the opening credits playing the sexy and classy movie theme and then beautiful overhead shots of a Florida beach resort.
I:20958;86;Au Goldfinger is a classic villian who set the standards for movie villians in the following decades.
I:20958;87;In any other movie that would seem to absurd to be credible but for some reason in a James Bond movie it works just fineClassic scenes include the famous laser heading for the groin with its famous dialogue and tense atmosphere.
I:20958;88;Sean Connery displays one of his best Bond performences ever as well as one of his best performences period.
I:20958;89;Nobody has been able to bring the character to life like he did and nobody has carried on and passed on a legacy as well as he has done.
I:20958;90;This is a classic movie.
I:20958;91;one of if not the best James Bond Movie of all time.
I:20958;92;It looks incredible in blu ray.
I:20958;93;And Bond squares off against Odd Job, one of if not the greatest secondary villain in a Bond movie.
I:20958;94;And, this movie tries too hard, now I'm sure back in the 60's this was a great movie.
I:20958;95;The third in the Bond series is also the best.
I:20958;96;"All the elements are here
I:20958;97;Connery was in peak form and had it down cold, he 'was' Bond and everybody knows he is the best and his first three Bond films are the best in the series.
I:20958;98;"Also with memorable gadgets
I:20958;99;martin ranks among the series best and most memorable gadgets.
I:20958;100;one of the best of all the Bond girls.
I:20958;101;A wonderfully playful score accompanies all the action and a little bit of cold.
I:20958;102;A towering achievement that ranks among the best action films of all time.
I:20958;103;From a scale of 1.10 I give this film a 9!
I:20958;104;This is a classic, hands down.
I:20958;105;It pretty much goes without saying but this is probably one of the best 007 movies ever made.
I:20958;106;It shows its age, but in a great way.
I:20958;107;A good plot, good acting, and some very interesting characters.
I:20958;108;This film has it all.
I:20958;109;Action, humour, romance, exotic locals, espionage, a fabulous script, a great villain.
I:20958;110;I like bond movies since I was a boy,,this was one of the good ones, hope you enjoy.
I:20958;111;you see all the picture that the director intended.
I:20958;112;one of the best, if not the best, Bond films.
I:20958;113;If you're a cinematographer or other such expert, please correct/comment on the aspect.
I:20958;114;This is a really good Sean Connerey James Bond film.
I:20958;115;the villians in this are prittey cool.
I:20958;116;Here's to operation grand slam!
I:20958;117;I love the old classic Bond movies cause it has something that the new Bond movies don't, imagination.
I:20958;118;Still not sure how they got away with the character name of the female lead
I:20958;119;My husband is a big fan of all the Bond movies and this is a biggie for sure!
I:20958;120;This is my favorite film featuring Sean Connery as Bond, and also a big favorite among us die.
I:20958;121;auric Goldfinger is one of the best Bond villians and that role was superbly played by Gert Frobe.
I:20958;122;my favorite of the 60's bonds.
I:20958;123;The third installment of Bond was again quite close to the book, and more of a pure spy story than the action flicks the series later became.
I:20958;124;Made in the 'good old days', when they could film a Bond movie each year and have a hit every time!
I:20958;125;the manner of death of some of the villains is a bit altered from the book, but for a film adaptation of a novel Goldfinger stays very true to the original story.
I:20958;126;very enjoyable, Bond is still more of a spy than a commando, sit back and appreciate it.
I:20958;127;Good consistent communication and updates.
I:20958;128;Suits that James Bond nut in my family perfectly.
I:20958;129;"the film shows its age with 007's reference to the Fab Four (telling ""Golden Girl"" Shirley Eaton that one should only listen to the moptops while wearing earmuffs), but otherwise remains a sturdy Bond thriller, one that saw the Bond formula more finely tuned than in the previous films (the formula would be perfected in the next film, ""Thunderball"")."
I:20958;130;cheek humor that softens the somewhat sadistic violence, and a hero as elegant as he is deadly.
I:20958;131;the villains are arguably Bond's best: Auric Goldfinger whose love of gold leads to his outlandish plan to knock.
I:20958;132;hand man, Oddjob, as silent as he is deadly, an assassin with a surprise more lethal than a rabbit in his hat.
I:20958;133;"When it comes to Bond babes, Honor Blackman of the original version of TV's ""The Avengers,"" is one of the best."
I:20958;134;A woman rather than a girl, her Pussy Galore is as smart as she is sexy, and she's one of the few Bondbabes who you believe could teach 007 a thing or two about self.
I:20958;135;"acted (along with ""Thunderball,"" this is Sean Connery's best performance as Bond) and brilliantly scored by John Barry whose title song, co. written by Leslie Bricusse and belted out by Shirley Bassey, rocked the top 40 and made the Bond films as notable for their music as for the gadgets and thrills."
I:20958;136;This is classic Sean Connery at his best.
I:20958;137;His awesome classic Aston Martin is introduced here in Goldfinger.
I:20958;138;Generally considered the best Bond ever made, this hi.
I:20958;139;ray iteration makes it even better.
I:20958;140;Painstakingly remastered from the original negatives, GOLDFINGER is an absolute beauty.
I:20958;141;It has the nostalgic look of '60s film stock, but that just makes it more fun.
I:20958;142;There were many iconic set pieces and moments with memorable and quirky names.
I:20958;143;Connery remains Connery, always good.
I:20958;144;My big brother took me to see it and I was fascinated.
I:20958;145;Bond is everything that a man secretly wants to be.
I:20958;146;Sean Connery was the best bond ever.
I:20958;147;This is my favorite of all the 007 movies.
I:20958;148;Arguably the best Bond film.
I:20958;149;Great sound especially for fifty year old movie.
I:20958;150;well, they remind me of my mother's friends.
I:20958;151;this movie is great fun with and is the first one that used the odd names to provoke some humor.
I:20958;152;One of the main characters who as you are watching you are unsure of what side she is on is called Miss Pussy Galore, brilliant aint it.
I:20958;153;This also has a much more energetic and funny Q then the one the audience saw in the previous film.
I:20958;154;This movie features the famous, Aston Martin, DB5, the one with the ejector seat.
I:20958;155;This car is used in a very fun car chase.
I:20958;156;It sounds corny but man this guy is really cool.
I:20958;157;But who cares it is still fun.
I:20958;158;so if you want to see true Bond Check out the great movie Goldfinger,And the next one you will want to see is (You Only Live Twice).
I:20958;159;IMHO this is still the best of the Bond movies.
I:20958;160;And you got odd job in this one.
I:20958;161;Sean does a good Bond!
I:20958;162;This is the greatest Bond movie in my opinion.
I:20958;163;Sean Connery is at his finest.
I:20958;164;Goldfinger himself is the great, even though they had to do a voiceover because his accent was so thick.
I:20958;165;I think Sean Connery was one of the best to play James Bond in the theatre.
I:20958;166;If you're a Bond fan and you have Blu.
I:20958;167;ray, this is a must own.
I:20958;168;It's considered by many to be not only the best of Connery's Bond films, but the best out of the entire series.
I:20958;169;(Oh, and the Steelbook case is really neat, too.)
I:20958;170;This one has the best of everything.
I:20958;171;villain (Oddjob), best name for a sub.
I:20958;172;villain (Oddjob), best gadgets, best Bond car and best scenery.
I:20958;173;It's interesting to see shots of the USA in Bond films, especially if they fall into the early ones.
I:20958;174;This film represents the best in what a Bond film should be.
I:20958;175;This one rocks because it basically became the standard of every following Bond movie.
I:20958;176;A lot of unknown behind the scenes pictures and the two very good documentaries make this quite a complete 007.
I:20958;177;it still lays down the ground rules for most of the entries in the series that followed and ALSO lays them out perfectly, like a painting you have to admire for hours on end.
I:20958;178;Ok let's steer away from the art world comparisons and onto the film itself.
I:20958;179;Connery does his third most relaxed outing as Bond, and walks cooley through the plot.
I:20958;180;Clearly enjoying himself and oozing charisma, virility and charm and even concern when faced with an overwhelming opponent in the form of Goldfinger's massive manservant Oddjob and no that's not a euphemism.
I:20958;181;I Must be dreaming, Goldfinger's pilot played by ex Avengers girl Honor Blackman .
I:20958;182;The fan mail actress Shirley Eaton must have got after doing that scene.
I:20958;183;Both her and her ineffectual revenge.
I:20958;184;guy Hamilton takes over the directing on this one and keeps original director Terence Young's style but makes everything seem bigger and bolder and the pace never let's up from the pre.
I:20958;185;Credit to designer Ken Adam for making up the interior of Fort Knox from his pure imagination.
I:20958;186;The dark parts look damn good too, black as black.
I:20958;187;plus the usual wealth of extra's from the making of Goldfinger to an extra documentary, `The Goldfinger Phenomenon' which features how Bond's popularity on screen was matching that of the Beatles in music charts for `twas this picture that transformed the Bond series into a worldwide box office action blockbuster series and the star into a household name all the way back in 1964.
I:20958;188;I would rate it as one of the top Bond movies ever made.
I:20958;189;I have always loved this movie.
I:20958;190;That probably tells you something about my age.
I:20958;191;Sean Connery is an absolutely suave and debonair spy in this movie.
I:20958;192;Gert Frobe was one of the best Bond villains and Honor Blackman was a refreshing contrast to the typical one.
I:20958;193;She possessed real intelligence and a strong personality.
I:20958;194;The plot, while improbable captures your attention and keeps you tuned in throughout the entire movie.
I:20958;195;Sean Connery is in peak form, the villains and henchmen are amazing, it is John Barry's best score, and the story is practically flawless.
I:20958;196;Goldfinger is an absolute masterpiece, not only in terms of James Bond, but also in terms of classic films.
I:20958;197;Sean Connery is James Bond 007 in arguably the best James Bond film ever made.
I:20958;198;With action, suspense, romance, and a heart stopping storyline, Goldfinger makes for an unforgettable experience.
I:20958;199;This was the second greatest Bond film (my favorite one being FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE).
I:20958;200;The Bond theme song is great, and we have yet another Bond girl with a sexually.
I:20958;201;The gadgets were great, and even believable to some extent.
I:20958;202;Oh yeah, and there's a naked lady painted gold.
I:20958;203;this was a refreshing turn from other Cold War spy movies, where they're just going after the Russians.
I:20958;204;Something like that would be dated today, for obvious political reasons, but Goldfinger is the perfect, timeless villain who could fit into any evil situation.
I:20958;205;Odd Job is a funny character and it's great the way he dies, especially when he deserves it.
I:20958;206;all in all one of the best of the Bond films.
I:20958;207;Great movie with Sean Connery who is the best actor in my opinion who has played the role, comparable only to Jeremy Brett's role as Sherlock Holmes.
I:20958;208;The first bond movie, in my option, is a work of art, sean connery is truly the man in this james bond classic,the style and manner this man portrays is great, this movie tells you what the spy game is all about.
I:20958;209;I will tell you this, if you to see a good bond movie, then goldfinger is it.
I:20958;210;Everyone loved From Russia w/ Love (1963).
I:20958;211;If you haven't seen it (don't say that in public either) just barrow it from somewhere, pop some popcorn and watch it!
I:20958;212;Whether it's my nostalgia talking or a plain fact, I've always looked at this as the best James Bond film ever produced.
I:20958;213;It had the most memorable characters and scenes I can remember over these four decades of Bond films.
I:20958;214;Yes, it's dated by now and not as exciting as when it came out, but it's a treasure among the films of the 1960s.
I:20958;215;it has a winning combination of good action, drama, romance and comedy.
I:20958;216;"Best of all, it has great characters that all of us who first saw it years ago still remember: ""Auric Goldfinger,"" Oddjob,."""
I:20958;217;time great names in the history of film!The story moves fast without overdoing the action.
I:20958;218;looks contrived and corny, but that's part of the fun and charm of the film.
I:20958;219;is of suitably armageddonic proportion.
I:20958;220;Several of the images in the film are classic .
I:20958;221;Connery's wit and charm cannot be used by the filmmakers.
I:20958;222;Having said that, the special effects hold up very well, and the giant Fort Knox set is still impressive.
I:20958;223;The other extras, such as theatrical trailers and radio interviews, are welcome, but most fans will wonder why there isn't more on this disc.
I:20958;224;Goldfinger is among the most admired of the Bond films.
I:20958;225;It has all of the elements that make Bond such a wonderful hero without any of them getting too far out of balance.
I:20958;226;There is the usual Bond cool, a certain amount of violence and danger, a great villain and his henchmen, some cool gadgets, and some beautiful girls with outrageous names.
I:20958;227;And Honor Blackman's Pussy Galore is still strong and up to competing with Bond rather than simply being there to fall in love with him and to be rescued by him.
I:20958;228;She has more to do with the plot than that.
I:20958;229;And the Bond films are full of continuity errors that are a hoot to try and pick up.
I:20958;230;we enjoy the opening bit before the titles and are off to the races.
I:20958;231;The first collision between Bond, Goldfinger, and Oddjob in Miami is classic, as well as the round of golf outside of London.
I:20958;232;The scenes in Switzerland have a classic three level shot that really is quite amazing even today.
I:20958;233;And the scenes back in America where the big plan is finally revealed along with Bond's interactions with Pussy Galore build to the big climactic fight.
I:20958;234;sean Connery was the great Bond and this performance is one of the best.
I:20958;235;Gert Froebe was physically perfect for the role.
I:20958;236;Skyfall definitely drew inspiration from this classic.
I:20958;237;Easily one of the most memorable of all the Bond films for several.
I:20958;238;sPECTRE takes a back seat for the 3rd Bond adventure.
I:20958;239;goldfinger had many classic scenes and lines that impacted pop culture and helped inspire Mike Myers' 1997 parody Austin Powers.
I:20958;240;The film was also famous for its gadgets, specifically Bond's Aston Martin DB5.
I:20958;241;His car was equipped with all sorts of cool stuff including a smoke screen, built in machine.
I:20958;242;style tracking system, and the famous ejector seat.
I:20958;243;It is still regarded as one of the classic must.
I:20958;244;I gave it to a James Bond fan.
I:20958;245;I had watched this movie many times before but still enjoyed it.
I:20958;246;"I have a grandson who's 10 and very much into the ""original"" Bond."
I:20958;247;This movie stars the best Bond, Sean Connery, at his apex in the role with one of the best villains, Goldfinger, one of the most challenging women in the series, Pussy Galore, and the most classic Bond vehicle of them all, the original Aston Martin.
I:20958;248;Along with its predecessor FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE, GOLDFINGER is widely considered to be the greatest Bond film of all time.
I:20958;249;"That formula is perhaps best expressed by its director, Guy Hamilton, for what would turn out to be his first of four Bond films: ""We're going to take you to wonderful places, we're going to show you beautiful girls, we're going to have some suspense and some laughs."
I:20958;250;GOLDFINGER lives up to this vision.
I:20958;251;It is much larger than the previous two films.
I:20958;252;Furthermore, Bond seems to have a much larger sense of humor, stylishly making his way through the film with unerring confidence in his own abilities to succeed.
I:20958;253;Thanks to the success of both DR. NO and FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE, not to mention a marvelous advertising campaign, GOLDINGER became the first Bond blockbuster, solidifying the success of the series.
I:20958;254;"after the ""gun barrel"" sequence at the top of the film, we are treated to the second pre."
I:20958;255;This time, the teaser establishes a well.
I:20958;256;defying and charismatic hero in a spectacular way, drawing us into the rest of the film.
I:20958;257;At this point, the opening credits roll and they are spectacular.
I:20958;258;Improving upon the credits of FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE, we once again see the body of a beautiful woman.
I:20958;259;The title song is bold and brassy and would later become the first true Bond hit song.
I:20958;260;This has caused quite a nuisance to the Bank of England, for the price of gold affects the price of the US dollar the British pound.
I:20958;261;bond, naturally, has reasons of his own for getting involved.
I:20958;262;In a surprising show of affection, Bond seems to be quietly seeking revenge for the death of his first conquest in the film: Jill Masterson (Shirley Eaton).
I:20958;263;It is an eerie image and certainly the most memorable one of the entire film.
I:20958;264;connery's performance seems to get more and more confident as the films progress.
I:20958;265;"Even during the film's famous ""laser"" scene, in which Bond is threatened with a modern castration, Connery manages to handle the scene with composure and style."
I:20958;266;His performance in this film proves why Connery is considered the best Bond.
I:20958;267;Gert Frbe's performance as Auric Goldfinger is also superb.
I:20958;268;In fact, Goldfinger is often listed as one of the greatest Bond villains.
I:20958;269;Whenever there is a close.
I:20958;270;Oddjob is one of the most famous henchmen in the entire series, known for his brute strength and flying hat, capable of decapitating any foe.
I:20958;271;Bond really has to force himself onto Pussy Galore which is a bit surprising, but I suppose it works with the play.
I:20958;272;Honor Blackman's performance is well.
I:20958;273;done and she holds herself up as Bond's equal.
I:20958;274;smart, sophisticated, athletic, and in control.
I:20958;275;Q (Desmond Llewelyn) once again makes an appearance, this time given an entire laboratory for developing new weapon technology.
I:20958;276;Unlike their two previous encounters in the first two films, Q and Bond now have a genuine chemistry together, one largely based on Bond's lack of respect for Q's work and Q's disgust for Bond's disrespect.
I:20958;277;It is here that we are introduced to the Aston Martin.
I:20958;278;with such a memorable cast of characters and images, GOLDFINGER became one of the most popular Bond films of all time.
I:20958;279;In addition to being one of the best of the series, it is a good action film in its own right.
I:20958;280;True to Hamilton's promise, the film is ultimately a joy.
I:20958;281;ride and quite fun to watch.
I:20958;282;The quintessential blueprint for all spy films to come.
I:20958;283;"Harold Sakata is the classic superhuman henchman with the ""cutting edge"" bowler hat."
I:20958;284;Richard Maibaum writes classic lines aplenty!
I:20958;285;John Barry's music score and title song (sung with bold gusto by Shirley Bassey) ranks with his best work.
I:20958;286;This is where the whole James Bond Movie Phenomenon finally took off!
I:20958;287;The fighting is a little corny and staged (Much more realistic now it seems).
I:20958;288;overall a good movie that I would watch again.
I:20958;289;We have the suave and sophisticated British agent defeating a larger than life villain among an exotic land populated by beautiful, exotic women, some good and some bad, and signature sets designed by the legendary designer Ken Adam.
I:20958;290;based on the 1959 book by Ian Fleming, the main attraction in this movie is the villain, who utters some of the most memorable lines in film history.
I:20958;291;in a quite ingenious manner Goldfinger is cheating at cards.
I:20958;292;This image proved so enticing that it became a trademark image associated with the film and the series for years to, come.
I:20958;293;In what is one of my favorite sequences in the 40.
I:20958;294;plus years of the Bond franchise Goldfinger is at it again .
I:20958;295;It's the understated game of cat and mouse set on the lush green golf course that really set the magic for me in this scene.
I:20958;296;"The first section of the book is titled ""Happenstance"" in that one meeting can be a matter of timing and focuses mainly on the meeting between 007 and Goldfinger in Miami."
I:20958;297;Pushing the envelope and taking its cue from the briefcase in the previous movie here we have a car that includes among its special features an oil slick, homing system, guns behind the lights and revolving number plates.
I:20958;298;truly this is the seminal entry in the franchise and we are treated here to a nice collection of special features the most impressive of which is a scene specific commentary from director Guy Hamilton.
I:20958;299;This causes us Bond fans to grin from ear to ear.
I:20958;300;By the time the credit sequence starts, with the credits super.
I:20958;301;imposed on a girl dipped in gold, and with the smutty.
I:20958;302;, Bond fans' toes are curling in ecstasy.
I:20958;303;"my personal favorite was the preceding adventure, ""From Russia with Love"", but I can't blame those, inside or outside the 007 fan club, who give ""Goldfinger"" pride of place as the best Bond film."
I:20958;304;"It's certainly the quintessential one, the one that added the finishing touches to the blueprint already drawn in the inaugural film of the franchise, ""Dr. No""."
I:20958;305;and secretly envied Bond's cool.
I:20958;306;Goldfinger is, nonetheless, the most iconic.
I:20958;307;John Barry uses variations of the theme song throughout the film.
I:20958;308;"The Monty Norman ""Bond Theme"", and Barry's own ""Second Bond Theme"", is scarcely heard."
I:20958;309;bond Girls: I count three, though I realize not every fan does.
I:20958;310;It is one of cinema's all.
I:20958;311;Oh, and she knows judo, too.
I:20958;312;You can turn off the charm, it won't work with me, she tells Bond early on in their acquaintance.
I:20958;313;She's able to flip Bond over in a barn .
I:20958;314;female physical prowess has traditionally been a sign of lesbianism in older literature and movies.
I:20958;315;Here, that tide is unusually high, unusually early.
I:20958;316;Because of it, production designer Ken Adams' stunning room at Goldfinger's stud.
I:20958;317;Goldfinger is the funniest, and simply the most fun, of all Bond films.
I:20958;318;This is the film that did it for the Bond series.
I:20958;319;"oriented ""From Russia with Love"" polished the Bond formula to a high gloss, while still keeping 007 a believable detective."
I:20958;320;Goldfinger added a big injection of humor and fantasy to the 007 concept.
I:20958;321;while there is greater emphasis on technology .
I:20958;322;Connery still holds his own very well as the British spy.
I:20958;323;"And Honor Blackman of ""The Avengers"" turns in the unquestionably best performance of any Bond Girl as Pussy Galore ."
I:20958;324;feisty, independent, fearless and every bit 007's match.
I:20958;325;"slicing in half at the hands of a laser beam, and the ""Operation Grand Slam"" raid on Fort Knox pack some of the biggest punches in the series, aided by John Barry's brilliant orchestral music."
I:20958;326;"still, ""Goldfinger"" clicks on a great many levels."
I:20958;327;It's a riveting, breezy, entertaining movie that set the style for many of the Bond films to follow.
I:20958;328;This is not just the best James Bond Film but this is a great film.
I:20958;329;This film is a classic.
I:20958;330;This film has a great story, great villains in Goldfinger(Gert Frobe) and Oddjob(Harold Sakata).
I:20958;331;The title song performed by Shirley Bassey is classic.
I:20958;332;tech as the modern Bond gadgets have become the Aston.
I:20958;333;martin equipped with ejector seats, oil slicks, and machine gun terrets still ranks as the best.
I:20958;334;My favorite James Bond movie.
I:20958;335;Goldfinger is such an amazing movie.
I:20958;336;Every scene is worth watching.
I:20958;337;The actors are top notch, as well as everything else.
I:20958;338;We also have the best Bond girl, Pussy Galore.
I:20958;339;Goldfinger , the third installment in James Bond series and the second I've ever seen, certainly lives up to it's commendable reputation.
I:20958;340;When you add in the incredible interactive menu, you've got a package sure to please.
I:20958;341;auric Goldfinger, the top bad guy in the film, is supposedly one of the best James Bond villains, and I can believe it.
I:20958;342;His gang of dangerous henchmen and co. villains certainly give an impressive feeling.
I:20958;343;As always, there are countless new gadgets, including the Aston Martin DB5, one of the most famous cars ever made.
I:20958;344;Many action sequences make the pace of the movie fast and entertaining, while still adding in a few scenes of explanation for good measure.
I:20958;345;Connery is much better as the suave secret agent than Roger Moore from Moonraker .
I:20958;346;He seems calmer and more sophisticated than the man who would later replace him as special agent 007.
I:20958;347;Goldfinger is a classic, not only for Bond fans, but for the genre of action films itself.
I:20958;348;My faith has been restored in the series, and I hope the next film I plan to view, On Her Majesty's Secret Service , will be just as good as this one.
I:20958;349;I've like two of the three Craig Bond films very much, but this is still superior film with the best incarnation of Ian Fleming's roguish spy hero.
I:20958;350;goldfinger is filled with memorable scenes which many films,including the Austin Powers series pays homage to.
I:20958;351;filled with high adventure,wit, and a style like no movie before,Goldfinger still stands as the ultimate Bond adventure.
I:20958;352;Still one of the best Bond flicks.
I:20958;353;Gorgeous girls, neat gadgets what else do you need?
I:20958;354;Goldfinger is most definitly the most popular James Bond movie ever!
I:20958;355;It has the perfect style of Sean Connery, extremely strong leads in Auric Goldfinger and Pussy Galore.
I:20958;356;The exciting Aston Martin DB5, an arresting title song by Shirley Bassey, visually stunning sets by Ken Adam and much more.
I:20958;357;It has one of the best plots and real gripping excitment.
I:20958;358;Bond awakes again, this time on a plane, where he meets the personal pilot of Goldfinger, Miss Pussy Galore.
I:20958;359;Bond and Pussy Galore safely parachute out and take a well needed vacation on an island somewhere.
I:20958;360;goldfinger is enhanced with some of the best characters in the entire series and a powerful performance by Sean Connery.
I:20958;361;My favorite Bond movie and where they introduced the austin martin and the ejector seat, too.
I:20958;362;IMHO, if you like Sean Connery's James Bond, this is one of the movies you gotta have in your library!
I:20958;363;Always great to see again.
I:20958;364;has humor, sex, aviation, drama, excitement.
I:20958;365;Sexy stars, great villainsMust have seen it more than 100 times
I:20958;366;Fifteen years later, I bought the hardcover books which reflected some effects of the movie, butGoldfinger (James Bond Novels)in the Ian Flemming version, Pussy Galore has a romantic affection with women and it disgusted Bond.
I:20958;367;"Sitting in the balcony, the movie was breathtaking and dazzeling and made me closet the special ""007 Suitcase"" (From Russia with Love (Two."
I:20958;368;but I played it over and over and enjoyed the picture stills from the movie.
I:20958;369;Dr. No was a wonderful start to the Bond franchise.
I:20958;370;Now, Goldfinger has brought the series to the peak.
I:20958;371;Goldfinger is packed with memorable moments that places this film in the category of ultimate classic Bond.
I:20958;372;Oddjob's business is to take care of 007, and takes great pleasure in attempting so, armed with a hat sharp as a knife and martial art skills that are no match for the double 0.
I:20958;373;goldfinger is a great feel good movie, highly entertainig .
I:20958;374;Every scene is wonderful, whether it is action, brilliant lines and moves by the villains, chemistry between Bond and Pussy Galore, or sneaky and intellgient games such as the Goldfinger/Bond scene on the golf course.
I:20958;375;Oddjob and Bond have a final showdown inside that is a terrific matchup that was accompanied without music, and worked out quite well.
I:20958;376;the story to Goldfinger is smart and fun, but maybe not as in.
I:20958;377;But overall, this Bond film has it all and is possibly the most balanced Bond film ever made, giving us a complete film of entertainment that is unforgettable.
I:20958;378;It's one of the best bond films ever.
I:20958;379;Just love it I guess.
I:20958;380;Midas is the inspiration for Auric Goldfinger.
I:20958;381;Sean Connery is at his very best here in the 3rd James Bond movie.
I:20958;382;His potrayal of 007, licenced to kill for Queen, Caviar, Champagne and Country is superb.
I:20958;383;No other actor has his charm, his innocent facial expression when the bad guy's heroin complex blows up, his wit and timing as he delivers his lines, tongue in cheek.
I:20958;384;Just the correct balance of charm, wit, humour and deadly ruthlessness.
I:20958;385;"In this movie is the classic, immortal line, full of devil may care sadism and sardonic wit and just a wisp of a smile, ""Shocking, positively shocking."""
I:20958;386;Bond, of course is extremely resourceful and throws a electrical appliance into the bath tub which is the coup de grace for the baddie.
I:20958;387;Lots of beautiful blondes add interest including the one who dies of gold paint.
I:20958;388;Shirley Bassey sings the theme song as only she can, with savoir faire and sheer power in her magic voice.
I:20958;389;The lyrics are beautiful, so poetic, yet sardonic and ironic too.
I:20958;390;M is splendid too as the chief of MI6 or SIS.
I:20958;391;He is obviously a veteran of many secret and clandestine operations but has earned his spot as Director of the service.
I:20958;392;At the end, all's well that ends well.
I:20958;393;Gentlemen like Bond and M exist and they are just as charming in real life as in the movies.
I:20958;394;I, Dr. Michael Lim, The Travelling Gourmet hope you enjoy this movie as much as I always do.
I:20958;395;life characters, silly overindulgence and skilled espionage work .
I:20958;396;There's definitely a healthy dose of the 1960s at play here, from the fashions on display to the attitudes of those wearing them, but in almost every single instance that results in a stronger, more vibrant cast.
I:20958;397;Despite their appallingly silly names, Oddjob, Pussy Galore and even Goldfinger himself are thoroughly deep, interesting, remarkable characters with a lot going on beneath the surface.
I:20958;398;The exploration of each villain's unique nooks and crannies, paired with an intensely curvy, unpredictable plot and the unmistakable presence of Bond himself, provides more fuel than any film could reasonably require.
I:20958;399;Quick in wit and in pace, it covers a lot of ground with admirable efficiency, leaves us with two fistfuls of memorable moments, and raises the stakes to staggering heights.
I:20958;400;"Sean Connery's third outing as James Bond in 1964's superb ""Goldfinger"" has the 007 franchise solidifying its primary thematic elements."
I:20958;401;Connerly is smoothly witty and deadly as the British Secret Service assassin.
I:20958;402;Bond and Goldfinger will play an exciting game of cate and mouse, with Bond repeatedly surviving close calls to stay close to Goldfinger.
I:20958;403;this movie is highly recommended as one of the best of the original Bond movies based on Ian Fleming's novels.
I:20958;404;Although some people listed above believe Goldfinger is the best Bond film ever filmed, there are features that in today's standards which are questionable and it is important to examine the film through the critical lens of when it was actually released in 1964.
I:20958;405;"then there's Shirley Bassey's memorable rendition of ""Goldfinger"" which follows the unforgettable trademark gun."
I:20958;406;"if you are a connosieur of the 007 films, Goldfinger does take you on a journey back to when directors cast women as voyeuristic delights (targeted sex objects)(i. e. Psycho), as unsatisfied ""Girl Friday's"" (i. e. Money Penny), dutiful housewives/mothers, or women who've lost their mind (i. e. Rosemary's Baby)."
I:20958;407;Released after the classic From Russia With Love, Goldfinger is considered by many to be the best Bond film.
I:20958;408;It has the best scene in a Bond film (The laser scene, which keeps me on the edge of my seat no matter how many times I see it) and the Classic one.
I:20958;409;Plus two great fight scenes (the Fort Knox raid and the fight between Bond and Oddjob).
I:20958;410;All in all, a great movie.
I:20958;411;I highly recommend this movie to anyone.
I:20958;412;The action in the movie is excellent and keeps you on your toes till the end.
I:20958;413;One of the best James Bond films ever.
I:20958;414;Sean Connery is the best.
I:20958;415;I love all of his Bond movies.
I:20958;416;Finally, the picture looks great .
I:20958;417;Too old and really not as good as the new Bond.
I:20958;418;I have always loved this movie.
I:20958;419;I love Gert Frobe in the title role.
I:20958;420;With so many movies of today that rely on super heroes, high tech gadgets, super cars, huge explosions and mayhem, its nice to go back to a simpler time.
I:20958;421;This is my favorite James bond movie.
I:20958;422;Starring the best of the Bonds Sean Connery.
I:20958;423;I love this movie the great villian, an awesome henchman, the Aston Martin DB5 with the ejecter seat and the oil slick.
I:20958;424;It got me started into the whole Bond series.
I:20958;425;For other great Bond films see From Russia with Love, Goldeneye, and Dr. No.
I:20958;426;Even 50 years later, Sean Connery is so smooth and elegant.
I:20958;427;We all know Goldfinger is a classic.
I:20958;428;However watching it again after all these years with such clarity is priceless.
I:20958;429;GoldfingerThe third movie featuring James Bond, Agent 007 of her Majesty's Secret Intelligence Service continues to marvel audiences the world over.
I:20958;430;the James Bond movies capture the action and romance found in the books by the author and surfaced a world of espionage, gadgets, secret weapons, beautiful women and amazing cars.
I:20958;431;The success of Sean Connery created an image so powerful that still to today, it is thought as that of the best Bond character.
I:20958;432;Without a doubt, this is one of the best Bond movies.
I:20958;433;Jill Masterson, played by Shirley Eaton, has the role of the assistant who gets killed by skin asphyxiation [body is covered with gold paint] because she helps and allows herself to be seduced by Bond.
I:20958;434;Oddjob has a steel rimmed hat that is a lethal weapon and he soon demonstrates his powerful skills to Bond by decapitating a statue on the golf course they are visiting.
I:20958;435;The scenes are smart, the plot is fascinating, the technology used in cars, airplanes, and weapons.
I:20958;436;Sean Connery is absolutely the best actor to play James Bond and this movie is the best Bond film yet.
I:20958;437;This is just one scene in a film with many such actions and lines.
I:20958;438;After seeing this video, you won't feel like you've been given some incredible insight, but you will have been greatly entertained.
I:20958;439;I thought it would be fun to see a Bond movie.
I:20958;440;The movie started out pretty well, with modest intrigue and pacing as it presented the Bond gadgets and women.
I:20958;441;With the third entry in the 007 series, the gold standard for a rollicking James Bond escapade has been forged!
I:20958;442;This movie works on so many levels, it makes the previous two films look like simple warm.
I:20958;443;if you've seen Skyfall, you will appreciate the latter films nod to this classic.
I:20958;444;That fantastic car gets a big role here, with its oil slicks, machine guns and of course the ejection seat.
I:20958;445;to break down why the movie works so well, I would cite the brisk flow of the film, the masterful technique, and Connery's pitch.
I:20958;446;perfect gambol which invites us along for an unforgettable ride.
I:20958;447;The story flows easily from one scene to the next, punctuated by buxom Bond babes and clever quips that appear just when they should.
I:20958;448;the cinematography of this movie is about as good as it gets.
I:20958;449;The man watching on the other side of the glass is Felix, who we follow to his meeting with a relaxing Bond.
I:20958;450;The movie itself is as slick as the super spies who populate it.
I:20958;451;bond fan in order to explain the phenomenon.
I:20958;452;I am sure these were excellent fight scenes for a simpler time, however, so I don't penalize it much for that.
I:20958;453;"He is and international ""businessman"" who simply loves gold."
I:20958;454;Generally acknowledged as one of the best bond movies of all time, you won't be dissapointed!
I:20958;455;As a side note my pick for best bond movie #2, casino royale.
I:20958;456;It's great if you haven't watched it in the past and okay if you have.
I:20958;457;i personally think this one and Thunderball are Sean Connery's best performances.
I:20958;458;my favorite actors as James Bond are Sean Connery and Roger Moore, they are the only Bonds who make astounding performances.
I:20958;459;Highly one of the best, most action.
I:20958;460;"packed adventurous James Bond movies like ""The Man With The Golden Gun"" or don't forget ""Moonraker"" and did I mention ""Dr. no""?"
I:20958;461;all of the James Bond movies at really good,It started out with Sean Connery.
I:20958;462;his series was the best followed by Roger Moore and so forth,as being an old timer the early movies where the best BUT the latter one are very good to watch and enjoy a movie
I:20958;463;suit in a tux, to the great fight with Odd Job near the end, this is the greatest of the Bonds.
I:20958;464;Sean Connery's Bond is at once menacing and charming, lethal and civilized.
I:20958;465;And Pussy Galore is the most interesting of the Bond femme fatales.
I:20958;466;I first saw this in 1964 when I was fifteen and absolutely loved it.
I:20958;467;A great, great adventure film with drama, humor, and excitement .
I:20958;468;and a stunning theme song.
I:20958;469;This is the quintessential escapist film.
I:20958;470;fan,you simly have to think that this is the best Bond.
I:20958;471;i like it,and think it`s quite good(I love Harold Sakata!)
I:20958;472;It is also quite a funny film, and it would set a sly tone, almost parody, for the numerous Bond films to come.
I:20958;473;based on the novel by Flemming, GOLDFINGER gets underway with an entertaining set up followed by a knockout title sequence and Shirley Bassey's legendary recording of the title song.
I:20958;474;nails pilot in Goldfinger's employ, the woman memorably named Pussy Galore (Honor Blackman.)
I:20958;475;Add in the amazing car with its various devices, a deadly laser, a lethal Charlie Chan.
I:20958;476;like assassin (Harold Sakata), and a plot to take over Fort Knox and you have a stylish and thoroughly entertaining production.
I:20958;477;"Shirley Eaton and Honor Blackman are easily the two most memorable ""Bond Girls"" in the entire series, Sakata is tremendously lethal, and Frobe is oddly likeable as the dangerous Goldfinger."
I:20958;478;But it is Connery who pulls all the elements together and makes it work.
I:20958;479;The special edition of GOLDFINGER has a number of entertaining extras, including two documentaries on the film and two audio commentaries.
I:20958;480;"I can remember clearly when ""Goldfinger"" premiered in December 1964."
I:20958;481;Can you imagine: 2 Connery/Bond classics premiered in the same year.
I:20958;482;"anyway ""Goldfinger"" is probably the most popular and famous 007 film."
I:20958;483;It is great, but I don't think it has aged as well as some of the others.
I:20958;484;"I still enjoy some of the other Connerys more: ""You Only Live Twice,"" ""From Russia With Love"" and ""Thunderball."""
I:20958;485;"Still don't forget that this was still only the 3rd Bond and they were still being played straight at this time, ""Moonraker"" was still 15 years away."
I:20958;486;Goldfinger is still a great Bond film and Connery is still the best Bond (Sorry, Daniel.)
I:20958;487;"He is absolutely at his best in ""From Russia With Love,"" ""Thunderball"" and this film."
I:20958;488;ray is terrific, beautifully clear.
I:20958;489;in conclusion, if you are a Bond fan or a film fan in general and you have not seen this film, I'm quite surprised.
I:20958;490;ray is certainly the way to go.
I:20958;491;the plot unfolds slowly but steadily, with witty repartee, and 60's style action.
I:20958;492;and of course the gorgeous girls bond romances.
I:20958;493;There is the lovely Jill Masterson (Shirley Eaton) , who is cruelly murdered by Goldfinger by being coated in gold paint.
I:20958;494;The only parts of the Bond movies that I never enjoy is when one of the beautiful girls die.
I:20958;495;each of the Bond girls has their own special charm, and Pussy not only knows how to be a smooth operator, she has a body that makes any clothes looks stunning, with a backside that stops conversation.
I:20958;496;This is the all time best of the Bond films.
I:20958;497;Many of the Bond films are also great.
I:20958;498;the Daniel Craig films are some of the best.
I:20958;499;But still, nothing to touch the pure entertainment of Goldfinger.
I:20958;500;Easily the best of the Bond films.
I:20958;501;Stylish and well written, the movie moves quickly from Miami Florida to England, to Switzerland and back to the USA (Fort Knox KT).
I:20958;502;The cinema replica of the gold depository is especially believable.
I:20958;503;Gert Frobe is a great Bond villain and the arch.
I:20958;504;job's hat for example), but this film is just pure entertainment.
I:20958;505;Lots of great spy scenes with Bond sneaking about here and there, a couple of great car chase scenes (with the coolest and most comical additions.
I:20958;506;ejector seat anyone), and a nice twist in the finale.
I:20958;507;This film probably has the most classic and memorable lines in the series and movie history for that matter.
I:20958;508;The film may look a bit dated, the dialogue is a cartoonish at times, and the effects are a bit lackluster, but honestly that is what has made 007 films from this period so charming.
I:20958;509;For that, this film is a a true cinematic artifact.
I:20958;510;It's not my personal favorite as a Bond enthusiast, but as a film that any viewer, Bond fan or not can access, this is the best.
I:20958;511;How can so many brilliant scenes be compacted in one film, Goldfinger is the best James Bond film (the last three are very poor).
I:20958;512;Connery is the best Bond ever, Goldfinger is the best baddie ever and Oddjob is the best right.
I:20958;513;the video starts off rather grainy in the first night scene, but seconds after that, the 1.66:1 picture is a revelation in restored video, with crisp, vibrant colors and high.
I:20958;514;One of the best of the Bond films.
I:20958;515;balanced level of depth and action leaving one emotionally charged.
I:20958;516;This is arguably Sean Connery's finest James Bond film.
I:20958;517;Sean Connery's performance is indeed that of Britain's dedicated civil servant as established in DR. NO but with a more broader and captivating ironic sense of humor.
I:20958;518;many elements that distinguish and embellish a James Bond film are present in GOLDFINGER.
I:20958;519;All these elements add to the mystique of the cinematic world of James Bond.
I:20958;520;director Guy Hamilton, screen writers Richard Maibaum and Paul Dehn and editor Peter Hunt were able to produce a solid, well balanced, entertaining film that does not rely totally on the spectacle and whimsy that would weaken the subsequent entries in the series.
I:20958;521;Bond has a job to do.
I:20958;522;"Connery's outer cool detachment of that job as seen through the eyes of ""Q"" is a pretense to his inner determination to see Goldfinger and company get their comeuppance."
I:20958;523;Yes, Bond has fun along the way but relishes in the moment of vengeance over the vanquished villains.
I:20958;524;production designer Ken Adam and art director Peter Murton gave the production a stunning and lavish distinction.
I:20958;525;The Fort Knox set and Goldfinger's playroom at his stud ranch was a testament to imagination and achievement.
I:20958;526;John Barry finally honed his distinctive style to perfection with this memorable score.
I:20958;527;GOLDFINGER is the best of the 007 series.
I:20958;528;This outing is flawless, with Sean in great form.
I:20958;529;From Connery's witty, opening remarks to the first real appearance of agent Q (RIP Desmond Llewelyn), to the girl painted in solid gold, to the classic theme song, this is the best Bond in existence.
I:20958;530;This also shows how far the times have changed.
I:20958;531;most Bond fans already know the story.
I:20958;532;It's got a really nice transfer despite the age of the movie (original release .
I:20958;533;MGM really took a lot of care in restoring this movie, and it shows.
I:20958;534;I was really surprised at how well the transfer came out.
I:20958;535;if you have even seen one Bond movie, this will change your mind about all the other Bond movies.
I:20958;536;Bond fans should have this one in their collection, as should all movie buffs.
I:20958;537;This is the classic Bond, and one that'll continue to be a classic for a long time.
I:20958;538;ray is outstanding, and it is great to see this like I never have before.
I:20958;539;Connery returns in this third installment of Bond films and puts in a masterful performance as James Bond.
I:20958;540;from beginning to end it is magnificent, seeing Bond blow, drive, smooch, charm and slap his way though what is arguably the best ever Bond film.
I:20958;541;gert Frobe is splendid as the evil, twisted Auric Goldfinger the international gold smuggler who wants it all .
I:20958;542;after all is said and done, this is a classic, and should not under any circumstances be missed.
I:20958;543;This is the origin of the film series and cultural phenomenon that is James Bond.
I:20958;544;It's fun to start at the beginning and watch the series tone and sensibility change slowly over time.
I:20958;545;We have girls, gadgets, Q, M, Goldfinger, and Oddjob as the ultimate nemesis for 007, plus that incredible Aston Martin DB.5!
I:20958;546;Terrific and exciting entertainment that seems real without any possibility of actually being real.
I:20958;547;Commentary by: director Guy Hamilton, the cast and crew.
I:20958;548;I love Sean Connery as 007 and this is about as good as it gets!
I:20958;549;I saw this as a teen and it still holds up for me.
I:20958;550;GOLDFINGER is a very good movie.
I:20958;551;Perhaps it is the best James Bond film of he entire series.
I:20958;552;This one film contains many definitive aspects of all the James Bond films in the series.
I:20958;553;The level of sophistication is much higher.
I:20958;554;Visually it is more stunning and is lavishly produced establishing a high standard for many of the cinematic elements associated with a James Bond film.
I:20958;555;Sean Connery gives his most sophisticated and distinguished performance as James Bond in GOLDFINGER.
I:20958;556;His friendly and easygoing approach in this film combined with his look of determination and confidence, wit, charm and a physical dexterity all add to his arsenal for self.
I:20958;557;Gert Frobe's performance and visual presence as Goldfinger is one of the highlights of this film and the series.
I:20958;558;The intriguing golf game is a highlight of their confrontation.
I:20958;559;Returning to Richard Maibaum and Paul Dehn, it can be seen that the script of GOLDFINGER is perhaps the best structured and balanced giving the plot elements, action sequences and the familiar Bond gadgets integrated treatment producing a solid story.
I:20958;560;Their script is also rich with character development meticulously incorporated into the story, which is never intrusive to the film's flow but is part of the cohesiveness of all the visuals skillfully directed by Guy Hamilton and expertly edited together by Peter Hunt.
I:20958;561;"Of those visuals it is Production Designer Ken Adam's distinctive set designs that also help define the film's ""Bond look"" where he creates a unique look of functionally modern almost futuristic sets that dominate the screen with his iconic style."
I:20958;562;Cinematographer Ted Moore did some of his best work on this film utilizing photographic techniques to produce a dynamic and lavish look to this film.
I:20958;563;This melody used and often referred to throughout the score integrates the James Bond Theme along with John Barry's own distinctive musical motifs and style once again lending credence that this is the definitive Bond film when combined with all the other superlative elements presented in GOLDFINGER.
I:20958;564;"The ""Bond Girls"" and their specific role in the Bond formula are best represented yet uniquely presented in GOLDFINGER seeing that the formula in this film is tweaked a bit."
I:20958;565;GOLDFINGER as a film stands on its own.
I:20958;566;As a James Bond film it could easily be considered the best of the series.
I:20958;567;In the the third film of this Bond series this may well be his favorite : (for me it's the best) there are enough reasons to hold this statement.
I:20958;568;And please beware of any other hat in the head of someone like Odd Job.
I:20958;569;I think this is the very best Bond film out.
I:20958;570;This is the Bond film with the laser about to hit Bond.
I:20958;571;The newer Bond films are great, but there's something about these Connery ones.
I:20958;572;The Best Bond Movie Ever Made.
I:20958;573;Seen all Bond movies several times if not more, including Roger.
I:20958;574;Sean Connery In my opinion is the number one Bond with Daniel Craig right behind Mr. connery without a doubt.
I:20958;575;The soundtrack Goldfinger an absolute classic.
I:20958;576;If you never ever Sean Connery or seen a Bond movie this is a good place to start.
I:20958;577;A classic Bond movie .
I:20958;578;Goldfinger is by far one of the best James Bond movies in the collection.
I:20958;579;I thought every actor did a very great job with the characters they were doing, inculding one of my favorite characters in the movie oddjob.
I:20958;580;The scenes with him in it amazing, inculding the end fight scene between Bond and him truly great.
I:20958;581;Plus the plotline is very good and added to the drama of the movie plus pressure for Bond to figure out the master plan as fast as he could.
I:20958;582;I love the classic James Bond films and this may be the best.
I:20958;583;The third Bond film, Goldfinger is the film that rocketed the Bond phenomena.
I:20958;584;What makes this film is the character of Goldfinger (Gert Frobe who mouthed the role), the Aston Martin's gadgetry, the witty script and lines, the 'golden girl', 'Mr. Oddjob,' and Connery's stylish performance.
I:20958;585;Guy Hamilton, a stylish British director brings his panache to this film and adds to the persona of Bond by making him more brash, physical and boyish, when necessary.
I:20958;586;The new characters are well.
I:20958;587;This is the Bond film that set the pattern of big sets, elaborate car chases, more gadgetry, a bigger.
I:20958;588;life villain, pushing the envelop (Pussy galore is an example) and the sexual energy of Bond.
I:20958;589;I remember seeing this movie as a Saturday matinee back in the seventies.
I:20958;590;It is still one of my favorite Bond movies.
I:20958;591;The movie sets still take me back to memories of the sixties.
I:20958;592;What a great movie to bring back those memories.
I:20958;593;"bernard Lee returns as ""M""."
I:20958;594;"Lois Maxwell returns as ""Miss Moneypenny"", Desmond Llewelyn returns as ""Q""."
I:20958;595;Miss Eaton is still very much alive.
I:20958;596;james Bond returns inThunderball (Special Edition)(1965).
I:20958;597;Item was shipped and received in an expediant manner.
I:20958;598;Packaged in near perfect condition as promised.
I:20958;599;"Connery is the ""best Bond ever""."
I:20958;600;Classic Bond , good performance for a day inside no matter if it's snow wet or rain, Carolina steamy heat.
I:20958;601;Get Sind and cool off
I:20958;602;But I found the sound and picture to be excellent.
I:20958;603;It stands up very well for an action movie, which generally become less exciting as they age.
I:20958;604;While some of GOLDFINGER is dated it contains genre defining plot, characters, effects, and stunts, that are still enjoyable over 40 years later.
I:20958;605;Even though we're accustomed to some of these elements this is still a creative take on the genre, especially considering that the hero is captive for most of the movie, and the villain goes from being powerless to formidable in one famous scene.
I:20958;606;The best are one on the making of the film and one on the pop culture impact of the film.
I:20958;607;The case still works fine so if this actually reduces the environmental impact I'm all for it.
I:20958;608;"Bondmania spread throughout the world and the classic title track belted out by Shirley Bassey topped the charts in both the U. s. and U. k. No doubt about it ""Goldfinger"" was a surefire hit film destined for greatness and since 1964 it seems that none of the other Bond films have surpassed it."
I:20958;609;Goldfinger has everything the first two Bond adventures had.
I:20958;610;Awesome settings, colourful characters, an exciting plot, and several action sequences.
I:20958;611;"Like ""From Russia With Love"", ""Goldfinger"" also has exciting creative gadgets such as Oddjob's deadly hat, Goldfinger's powerful laser, and Bonds high tech Aston Martin."
I:20958;612;connery's portrayal of Bond in this film is as witty and as fresh as ever.
I:20958;613;of course Bernard Lee returns as M and Lois Maxwell as Ms. moneypenny and Desmond Llewelyn returns as Q, only in this film he is called Q for the first time.
I:20958;614;goldfinger's plot is very exciting.
I:20958;615;overall I think Goldfinger is the best Bond film ever made the plot is exciting, the characters are interesting and the action scenes are some of the best in any Bond film.
I:20958;616;Bottom line: Best Bond Film ever!
I:20958;617;Oh, to have lived in the 1960s, when a great Bond film came out Every.
I:20958;618;Goldfinger has an interesting two.
I:20958;619;The first, produced years ago for the laserdisc, features edited sound bites from director Guy Hamilton and other cast members.
I:20958;620;"Indeed from this track you learn a lot more about the original ""Goldfinger"" novel, and you'll hear opinions as to why the story works better as a movie."
I:20958;621;These are worthy points and they set the commentary track above the cut.
I:20958;622;"the two ""documentaries"" are also above."
I:20958;623;And the real great moment here is Connery's well.
I:20958;624;Final proof that the Bond movies are, in fact, still as relevant as ever.
I:20958;625;this is the best Goldfinger has ever looked or sounded(thanks to Lowry Digital's awesome restoration!)
I:20958;626;,the Blu Ray is simply amazing!
I:20958;627;It's also loaded with a vault if great extras,if you're a Bond fan and have Blu Ray player,get it!
I:20958;628;,you wont be dissapointed!Very recommended!
I:20958;629;And all of this happens in the first five minutes of Goldfinger, the film that turned agent 007 into a worldwide phenomenon, and is considered by most to be the quintessential Bond adventure.
I:20958;630;The truth is that after almost 40 years, it's still pretty darn good!
I:20958;631;Because the film set the template that most would follow, every Bond element you can think of can be found in Goldfinger.
I:20958;632;, John Barry's unforgettable music, including Shirley Bassey's legendary title song, and the list just goes on!
I:20958;633;great screenplay, good action even today and of course, Sean Connery!
I:20958;634;Once again we have a bench mark for the Bond Movies.
I:20958;635;he was the best bond of all time.
I:20958;636;This is always a great Bond movie to watch.
I:20958;637;This is definitely theeeeeee best James Bond thriller!Made in 1964, director Guy Hamilton has assembled atop notch cast around him, which performed each ofhis character with abundance.
I:20958;638;Second, the leadinglady Honor Blackmann is a stunning entry in the007 series.
I:20958;639;of course, the most interesting item in Goldfingeris the Aston Martin DB5 with modifications.
I:20958;640;and of course the man who made it all happen,the always grouchy weapon expert Q .
I:20958;641;goldfinger is the very best 007 movie who setthe tone for all other Bond films to follow,it is a remarkable, outstanding, no.
I:20958;642;For me, it is the best of the Bond movies.
I:20958;643;The story is great and I love the cars, especially the Astin Martin.
I:20958;644;One of my favorite scenes is when Bond schools M on the brandy being served at a briefing.
I:20958;645;This movie is the best.
I:20958;646;It has the my favorite James Bond Sean Connery and oddjob is really cool.
I:20958;647;This movie is a true classic and is a must have for any James Bond fan.
I:20958;648;Goldfinger is one of the most recognized and celebrated Bond films, starring the charming, confident, brilliant, and suave Connery as 007, a man every male viewer wants to be and every female viewer wants to be with.
I:20958;649;top villians in the form of the filthy rich, despicable, and card.
I:20958;650;We've got the alluring female (not a pawn, but a powerful woman) played by Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore.
I:20958;651;martin with an ejection seat (and more) to Goldfinger's plane to Oddjob's lethal black hat.
I:20958;652;Goldfinger has some great tricks, of course, but also excellent dialogue and a well.
I:20958;653;has extraordinary sharpness and color .
I:20958;654;faithfully recreating the original movie experience .
I:20958;655;Sorry but GOLDFINGER is the essence of James Bond.
I:20958;656;is the breakaway hit that made the James Bond Series a world wide phenomenon.
I:20958;657;extraordinary entertainment and just plain fun.
I:20958;658;The first Bond movie was Dr. no, starting the popular franchise, but it was Goldfinger in 1964 that is still the finest of the films.
I:20958;659;Sean Connery, the finest James Bond, is determined to stop Auric Goldfinger a man who is determined to get what he wants.
I:20958;660;but of course, James has his gadgets, but most of them are within the best Bond car to date, his Aston Martin, with machine guns, an ejector seat, [there's a very nice car scene involving this one and one guy stupid enough to let Bond drive] and a smoke screen.
I:20958;661;Not the complete success of its predecessor,Dr. No,but aided by terrific photography and one of the best movie theme songs of all time, this film can certainly hold its head up in polite society.
I:20958;662;Bourne is almost always the master of his fate,Bond relies too much on luck, fate, and the adage that good will triumph over evil.
I:20958;663;What was great entertainment in 1964, is still a good view today.
I:20958;664;He goes into a bar and meets up with a beautiful dancer.
I:20958;665;Bond distracts the beautiful assistant, Jill Masterson (Shirley Eaton) by having his way with her.
I:20958;666;This film involves one of the most suspenseful and intriguing plots of all of the 007 movies.
I:20958;667;This is a high action movie and the fight between Bond and Oddjob is just a classic battle royal.
I:20958;668;This movie also involves one of the best Bond Girls who is Pussy Galore (Honor Blackman).
I:20958;669;this movie and plot are simply spectacular.
I:20958;670;I have read all of Ian Fleming's books when I was very young and this is one of the best adaptions to movie that was made.
I:20958;671;It is a great story and features wonderful acting that makes the movie one of the best 007 films.
I:20958;672;It is outstanding and I recommend it to you.
I:20958;673;"While GOLDFINGER is the third James Bond movie produced, it is, in a way, the first ""Bond movie""."
I:20958;674;driven movies with a relatively realistic protagonist.
I:20958;675;life villain with an extravagantly ambitious scheme, and the beautifully gadget.
I:20958;676;filled Aston Martin DB5, modern viewers will recognize all of the key elements of a true Bond film.
I:20958;677;More importantly, it is James Bond who makes a Bond film, and it is the fact that we know James Bond will win against overwhelming odds because he is so unstoppably cool that makes James Bond who he is.
I:20958;678;Sean Connery is at the top of his game in GOLDFINGER, completely owning the role.
I:20958;679;"gOLDFINGER is a fan favourite
I:20958;680;It has a couple of elements to recommend it to that honour.
I:20958;681;It does introduce two of Bond's most memorable characters.
I:20958;682;cliched dialogue with flawless timing, making a line everyone has heard a hundred times still seem fresh and menacing.
I:20958;683;Along with a number of other goodies, it features a radio interview with Sean Connery.
I:20958;684;"this GOLDFINGER ""Special Edition"" package is sure to please Bond fans new and old."
I:20958;685;Great scenery, great special effects, and James Bond, well you know its going to be full of action and drama mixed in with typical Bond humor.
I:20958;686;I thought this single and cheaper blu.
I:20958;687;Goldfinger is one of my favorite movies.
I:20958;688;See my reviews of From Russia With Love and Dr. No.
I:20958;689;This rounds out the perfect three.
I:20958;690;Give yourself a treat with a Martini, on the side?
I:20958;691;packed movie, with a funny cast as well as suitable settings.
I:20958;692;So, with this wonderful plot revealed, the movie has taken form and gets into the good part, where it proves it's a movie worth seeing.
I:20958;693;This movie is a classic and has everything a true Bond fan can want.
I:20958;694;This is my favorite Bond movie.
I:20958;695;Armed with clever gadgets, good looks, and considerable wit, could Connery's martini.
I:20958;696;(Still, his most iconic image has to be actress Shirley Eaton.
I:20958;697;Goldfinger also introduces Bond's tricked.
I:20958;698;"out Aston Martin and his inventive helpmate, Q, played by the wonderful Desmond Llewelyn, while Frobe, Sakata, and ""Avengers"" alum Blackman prove to be among the most formidable nemeses in the Bond franchise."
I:20958;699;This in my mind the best Bond ever.
I:20958;700;The lines and actors were the best representation of Bond.
I:20958;701;James bond or Sean Connery is a very good actor,It was good and pussey galore was good.
I:20958;702;but hey,that was to make the story and the characters more believable.
I:20958;703;this is in the first act,mind you.
I:20958;704;but what humor and suspense it generates.
I:20958;705;will Goldfinger discover the ball switch?It still puts me on the edge of my seat,and I've seen it two dozen times.
I:20958;706;the greatness of this movie lies in the powerful visual images it so casually presents.
I:20958;707;chances are it will lead to a happy Bond.
I:20958;708;ing experience with someone you love.
I:20958;709;This is the movie that really got Bond going.
I:20958;710;The film, made against considerable constraints of budget, accomplishes a sustained mood which is hard to match.
I:20958;711;"Yes, it is a great movie, all right, but some comments assert that ""in all cinema history."""
I:20958;712;just something like the truth.
I:20958;713;One of the first and one of the best.
I:20958;714;No one walked the fine line between machismo and wit like the Connery James Bond.
I:20958;715;I enjoy the Pierce Brosnan Bond and Daniel Craig Bond, but Connery set the standard very high and no one else has met it yet.
I:20958;716;Sit back, enjoy and let your self be entertained.
I:20958;717;This has to be by far Lowry's finest achievement.
I:20958;718;But the results are what counts and In this case Lowry' has made a remarkable step forward and has raised the bar for film restoration to a new standard.
I:20958;719;Again, the box sets are great, but what we're finding out Is that consumers are willing to pay more for what they want and that's the bottom line.
I:20958;720;Nostalgic, but the action, the fight scenes, etc. are campy at best.
I:20958;721;great action, beautiful women, and even a surprise or two.
I:20958;722;sean connery is my favorite james bond.
I:20958;723;watch if you're a bond fan.
I:20958;724;With one of the best villains ever.
I:20958;725;But it works, mostly because of the presence of Sean Connery.
I:20958;726;like Oddjob (Harold Sakata) with his lethal hat is one of the most engaging thugs ever to toss 007 into a heap.
I:20958;727;Connery has the voice, physical stature, and rakish glint in his eyes to pull it off.
I:20958;728;i'm giving GOLDFINGER 5 stars not because it's a great film, but because it's perhaps the best of several with Connery as Bond, and the one that could well immortalize Sean to human history in that role.
I:20958;729;the movie itself is above average.
I:20958;730;Oddjob is a great henchman, Goldfinger is one of the most intelligent and menacing villains ever.
I:20958;731;He may not have had that big of a part in the action, but his maniacal genius certainly makes up for that.
I:20958;732;while she's not my favorite she's certainly right up there.
I:20958;733;I felt she was a great addition to this movie because she added a certain independence to the role of a woman.
I:20958;734;overall it's a great entry but a bit overtalked.
I:20958;735;I had heard of Goldfinger and Sean Connery though I think I have not seen this movie but James says he loved it so that is good enough for him.
I:20958;736;Goldfinger is the quintessential Bond flick.
I:20958;737;Goldfinger has all of the elements that make a Bond movie great.
I:20958;738;Lots of action, good looking women and a great villian and sidekick.
I:20958;739;One of the very fine early Connery Bond roles, so artfully directed and visually appealing.
I:20958;740;Shirley B's theme is magnificent.
I:20958;741;The Blu Ray edition looks and sounds tremendous on our plasma.
I:20958;742;The 3rd film in the franchise is definitely a momentum builder.
I:20958;743;This is the first in a set of original Bond films released in their correct release.
I:20958;744;That said, this was a very enjoyable movie, with clever dialogue, memorable villains and unpredictable plot turns.
I:20958;745;What I found most refreshing having seen a few of the more recent Pierce Brosnin Bond films was the lack of frenetic editing and pounding music during the action/fight scenes.
I:20958;746;It just tells an exciting story and does it very well.
I:20958;747;I first viewed this movie at the cinema, over 40 years ago.
I:20958;748;It was my first James Bond movie, and I was thoroughly entertained!
I:20958;749;ray edition through Amazon, and enjoyed watching it equally as much.
I:20958;750;a must for James Bond fans, and if you've not seen a James Bond movie, I think you will totally enjoy this movie.
I:20958;751;That honor goes to From Russia with Love.
I:20958;752;Get the movie, enjoy the movie, but get the other connery Bond films to complement it.
I:20958;753;"What a delight to see ""Goldfinger"" again."
I:20958;754;For me, the movie holds up very well.
I:20958;755;Each Bond character has their unique approach.
I:20958;756;The ultimate entry in the series through its unique combination of inspiration and confidence.
I:20958;757;Goldfinger is easily the best of the classic James Bond.
I:20958;758;There is hardly a thing in here to critique, Sean Connery is at the top of his game, gadgets are ton of fun, writing is excellent, nothing in here detracts from a good 2 hour movie.
I:20958;759;007 goes edgy and comes out of the ocean Real well.
I:20958;760;Seeing Sean again in his James Bond prime .
I:20958;761;Suspend our women's rights for a couple hours and just enjoy it.
I:20958;762;Takes me back to being a kid and watching this with my family.
I:20958;763;I found this to be very invigorating.
I:20958;764;I found it interesting how James Bond went about getting to his goal.
I:20958;765;Goldfinger is one of the best Bond movies.
I:20958;766;Great music and opening scenes as well.
I:20958;767;This Bond script writing is superior and the film has interesting leading and supporting performances (stereotyped, of course).
I:20958;768;Viewers who enjoy the genre will enjoy this film.
I:20958;769;Galore is the best character in all Bond films!
I:20958;770;The video restoration is marvelous, with great detail and color.
I:20958;771;all,though,a worthy restoration of the best.
I:20958;772;What can you say, Sean Connery at his best, Honor Blackman, one of the sexiest bond girls ever, the killer Odd Job and the wonderfully evil Gert Frobe as Goldfinger.
I:20958;773;One of the best Bond flics ever made,
I:20958;774;This is without a doubt the ultimate definitive James Bond movie.
I:20958;775;sean connery out does himself proving he is the best 007.
I:20958;776;m,Q,and Miss Moneypenny are all in fine form with bond having classic scenes with all of them.
I:20958;777;on the villains side you have the best and most classic villains of the entire series.
I:20958;778;gert Frobe is superbly fiendish as Auric Goldfinger.
I:20958;779;as for the women,honor black as pussy galore is one of the most beautiful and confident of the bond women.
I:20958;780;rather than follow bond around like a love sick puppy pussy tells bond shes immune to his charms and she even uses her judo on him to keep him in line.
I:20958;781;this image caused a rage in the sixties and even today her horrible death remains one of the most memorable images in any movie.
I:20958;782;the exciting climax in fort knox is truely fantastic,here we see bond battle ferociosly with oddjob and save the countrys gold supply within seconds of the bomb detonation.
I:20958;783;in conclusion GOLDFINGER is the best James Bond movie which ranks as the finest in the series and there is no competition.
I:20958;784;Lets face it, Goldfinger is the best James Bond movie ever.
I:20958;785;This is the spy classic by which, all others are measured.
I:20958;786;In my opinion one of the best bonds ever made.
I:20958;787;This is one of the first bond movies I ever saw and I still enjoy watching it to this day.
I:20958;788;One of the best of the series.
I:20958;789;Is GOLDFINGER the best of all the James Bond movies?
I:20958;790;Honor Blackman, as Pussy Galore, has the best one.
I:20958;791;"gOLDFINGER achieves a perfect mix of all the ""Bond elements"" of action, adventure, style, girls, gadgets, and camp, to be the most memorable of the series."
I:20958;792;You might chuckle at the repartee, but in the end you cheer when Goldfinger gets his.
I:20958;793;"Rightfully so, this picture is considered an early peak"" in the Bond canon."
I:20958;794;"this is the first great Bond ""gadget"" movie."
I:20958;795;Like the camp humor, the gadgets add to the movie.
I:20958;796;In the third Bond outing, the ante (and the budget) was upped to produce one of the best in the franchise.
I:20958;797;With incredible locations, great casting, particuarly with Gert Frobe as the title character and Pussy Galore (Honor Blackman).
I:20958;798;"ray]""Goldfinger"" was the third James Bond film, and now, 45 years later it remains one of the best of the series."
I:20958;799;Great villains (including the almost.
I:20958;800;lovable Oddjob), great action sequences and a girl named Pussy Galore.
I:20958;801;Like the rest of the recent remasters, this edition benefits from a sterling remastering job by Lowery Digital.
I:20958;802;The image is sharp, sporting eye.
I:20958;803;This is the best the film has looked since its release to theaters in 1964.
I:20958;804;My father and i enjoyed this one since i was little.
I:20958;805;i still enjoy it watching it.
I:20958;806;Goldfinger was a good movie.
I:20958;807;After almost fifty years, this film is still a benchmark for the genre with iconic villains, gadgets galore, beautiful women, the coolest car ever, and, of course, JB.
I:20958;808;So load it up, grab some popcorn, settle in, press play and enjoy a true classic!
I:20958;809;Great story line, action, scenes,bad guys and beautiful women.
I:20958;810;The most famous Bond movie ever made.
I:20958;811;It really is a classic.
I:20958;812;If you have not seen this movie then you need to because it's a classic and you will love it.
I:20958;813;Blu ray looks great and sounds great.
I:20958;814;Having seen other Bond films in the course of 50 years, this is still my favorite!
I:20958;815;Yes, it was sold on it's high points when it came out, namely the ejector seat, tire destroying wheel hub, a naked girl painted in gold, and Odd Job's hat trick.
I:20958;816;I'm giving it three stars for effort and because it is a James Bond movie.
I:20958;817;Goldfinger destroys them all, one in a particularly colorful way.
I:20958;818;this is by far the best James Bond movie.
I:20958;819;"After ""Dr. No"" and ""From Russia With Love"", the James Bond character has been honed to the expectations of a growing audiences."
I:20958;820;Budgeting looks bigger, everything is broader, more elaborate.
I:20958;821;Best of all is that the James Bond character remains a very realistic portrayal of a secret service agent.
I:20958;822;a great movie and good entertainment for the whole family.
I:20958;823;the best Bonds generally are .
I:20958;824;probably the best female lead in any 007 film.
I:20958;825;A great John Barry score and Robert Brownjohn's last title sequence .
I:20958;826;It streamed really well and everyone enjoyed the movie.
I:20958;827;This James Bond movie features loads of gadgets, cool cars, and great villains.
I:20958;828;This is what a Bond movie should be about!
I:20958;829;Still, Goldfinger is definitely one of the best bond movies!
I:20958;830;This is classic adventure at it's best.
I:20958;831;I could just say its classic james Bond, but Goldfinger has such well written dialog it's one 007 I'll always remember and hold dear, now if we could just update the special effects lol.
I:20958;832;Nice sound for a movie it's age though.
I:20958;833;What I'm saying is if I watch this movie made with today's tech and style it would be 5 stars for sure.
I:20958;834;Great film, classic movie acting.
I:20958;835;And of course one of the best bonds ever, Sean Connery.
I:20958;836;Watch it and you won't be disappointed.
I:20958;837;Not the best, but it was good.
I:20958;838;This movie set the standard for the Bond genre, and is generally regarded as one of the best Bond films, if not the best.
I:20958;839;"tech in this movie and will stay with Bond in every film from this point forward (with the exception of ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service)."
I:20958;840;"In this movie we have a cutting laser
I:20958;841;A lot of poetic license was used for this special effect since even visible light lasers can barely be seen under most circumstances, and high power cutting lasers can not be seen at all.
I:20958;842;sean Connery appears very confident in this film.
I:20958;843;His style of Bond is well developed by this point and remains the standard by which all other actors playing Bond are measured.
I:20958;844;there are very cool gadgets in this movie.
I:20958;845;martin DB.5 has to be the best.
I:20958;846;The cargo plane with the Boeing 747 style front end was very interesting.
I:20958;847;Goldfinger's model of Fort Knox was very good.
I:20958;848;Goldfinger also provided the best way to get rid of a body in the 60's.
I:20958;849;the locales become more exotic with each Bond movie.
I:20958;850;This time we get to go to Switzerland, England, and exotic Kentucky (well, Fort Knox is pretty exotic).
I:20958;851;Being on location adds a lot of realism to these films.
I:20958;852;the biggest advantage to the Ultimate Edition of Goldfinger is the cleaned picture.
I:20958;853;There is also an open ended interview with Honor Blackman.
I:20958;854;this movie is a lot of fun.
I:20958;855;I guess it's because the decade was perfect for the character with its look, feel, and music of the times.
I:20958;856;And GOLDFINGER was arguably the definitive representation of all this:*Shirley Bassey's great rendition of the title song.
I:20958;857;martin DB5 with all the gadgets.
I:20958;858;*the strong female lead with that name: Pussy Galore!
I:20958;859;*one of the coolest and most beloved henchmen in the series: Odd Job.
I:20958;860;*and great character interaction(love the scene where 007 is figuring out the plot and Goldfinger seems genuinely pleased that someone recognizes his 'genius')All great stuff.
I:20958;861;There was so much style and a special aura that defined what Bond/spy/adventure films should be during that 3.
I:20958;862;Sean Connery's third outing as James Bond is one of the best in the series.
I:20958;863;There are tons of Bond landmarks including Oddjob, the Aston Martin DB5, a cool theme song, and one heckuva car chase!
I:20958;864;Plus, Connery is the personification of cool as James Bond.
I:20958;865;Only Pierce Brosnan can measure up to Connery, but even then he's just as good, not better.
I:20958;866;Connery is the man and this movie (as well as From Russia With Love ) proves it.
I:20958;867;The film has tons of memorable moments that lead up to a fantastic final battle with Bond squaring off against Oddjob in Fort Knox.
I:20958;868;This scene is one of the best in the series and possibly one of the best fight scenes ever filmed.
I:20958;869;This is truly a great movie.
I:20958;870;Sean is the best bond ever.
I:20958;871;has just given you your new assignment.
I:20958;872;It is bloody simple .
I:20958;873;"You observe him cheating a man at cards and decide to have a little fun with him
I:20958;874;When you wake, you find you are spreadeagled on a moving metal platform.
I:20958;875;Goldfinger is possibly the best of the Bond movies.
I:20958;876;This vintage film deserves a high rating for the wonderful Sean Connery style of James Bond.
I:20958;877;The famous painted girl portion of the film was well deserved, as it's played very well.
I:20958;878;Goldfinger and his henchman are great actors in their own right.
I:20958;879;I would recommend this to all James Bond fans, and particularly Sean Connery fans.
I:20958;880;Overall a fantastic Bond movie.
I:20958;881;all that being said, a fantastic movie.
I:20958;882;Dr. No was rough around the edges and not very interesting, but From Russia with Love was an excellent follow.
I:20958;883;the film is surprising in that it takes the original novel and improves on it rather than butchering it for the big screen (maybe the folks who do the Tom Clancy movies can learn a lesson from this.)
I:20958;884;You have a short but exciting scene that features explosions and a battle to the death, followed by one of the most powerful and unforgettable songs ever sung for a movie.
I:20958;885;This movie is all fun.
I:20958;886;Gert Frobe puts on a great performance as the over.
I:20958;887;top villain, and Sean Connery is at his best.
I:20958;888;Harold Sakai is impressive as the villainous Odd Job, making for a formidable foe that could not be matched until the introduction of Jaws in The Spy Who Loved Me.
I:20958;889;simply spectacular to look at.
I:20958;890;And each was bolstered up with spiffy new 007 menus and period special features that were informative and actually worth seeing.
I:20958;891;up elements and extras .
I:20958;892;and is an awesome thing to behold.
I:20958;893;her golden blonde hair slowly coming into focus in dazzling sexy clarity.
I:20958;894;and you're on a winner.
I:20958;895;He'll kill you, smile afterwards and then flick the bits off of his immaculately groomed Saville Row suit.You also forget about the great one.
I:20958;896;It's all so bloody good .
I:20958;897;and it still makes you tingle.
I:20958;898;set interview with a suited.
I:20958;899;"booted Connery, the ""Declassified: M16 Vault"" feature which is just so enjoyable."
I:20958;900;it would be such a sweet touch.
I:20958;901;you can't help but feel that the dapper British agent has a point.
I:20958;902;bond 3 on BLU RAY is surely up there with the very best restorations ever done .
I:20958;903;watches is a testament to its durability.
I:20958;904;Still my favorite of all the Bonds.
I:20958;905;I personally think this is one of the best Bond films.
I:20958;906;It is a bit dated in special effects and such, but it is great fun to watch.
I:20958;907;Sean Connery is the only James Bond for me and this was the best .
I:20958;908;i love watching james bond movies and its a good pass time when im at homevat nite and wanting to relax
I:20958;909;Just let me say that I am a huge James Bond fan and this movie is the reason why.
I:20958;910;It has all the elements of a great Bond movie and has some of the best moments of this franchise that has now spanned four decades.
I:20958;911;the plot to Goldfinger is simple enough.
I:20958;912;this might not be the best description of the plot ever but it's short sweet and accurate.
I:20958;913;He carries a swagger in Goldfinger that you just absolutely love.
I:20958;914;His performance alone is worth the movie.
I:20958;915;Most Bond movies are as good as the bad guys in them and Goldfinger is one of the best ever.
I:20958;916;Gert just took this role and ran with it.
I:20958;917;He's easily the best bad guy ever in a Bond film.
I:20958;918;It's well worth the price.
I:20958;919;The Aston Martin Db5 is excellent in this movie.
I:20958;920;The car fight is great and is one of the most memorable scenes in the movie.
I:20958;921;goldfinger is the best Bond movie ever.
I:20958;922;It has the best Bond performance and the best bad guy in any of the films.
I:20958;923;It's the reason the Bond franchise is where it's at today and is a must for all Bond fans.
I:20958;924;"The film:""Dr. No"" and ""From Russia With Love"" are classics in their own rights, but ""Goldfinger"" really has it all."
I:20958;925;babes galore, lush locales, and Sean Connery at his best.
I:20958;926;"And it's all done at a brisk, entertaining pace which never feels bloated in the way ""Thunderball"" did."
I:20958;927;it's all pulled off with such panache and style, it doesn't feel cliched at all (plus, it pays to remember that it was all fresh and new when it premiered.)
I:20958;928;Goldfinger has the perfect mix of humor, violence, style, and cool.
I:20958;929;Anyway, it's pretty nearly a perfect Bond movie.
I:20958;930;Relentlessly entertaining, fun, exciting, and just darn good.
I:20958;931;ray:This transfer really shines at times, with impressive detail on facial close.
I:20958;932;ups, mountain vistas, and clothing.
I:20958;933;Overall, the detail is very impressive, and tops that of the previous two films on Blu.
I:20958;934;Black levels are rock solid, color is very naturalistic and stable.
I:20958;935;Overall it's just a tremendous job by the MGM studio and Lowry Digital to not overdo it and let the natural film elements stand on their own merits.
I:20958;936;special features also shine .
I:20958;937;"This is pretty much the best Bond film of its era (although I am quite partial to ""From Russia With Love,"" as well)."
I:20958;938;These three films will give you pure 60's Bond without any of the silliness of the later stuff.
I:20958;939;Best of the Bond flicks?
I:20958;940;I haven't seen any Sean Connery Bond movies and a few people say he's the best Bond.
I:20958;941;For starters, the cinema was really hot, which severely affected my viewing.
I:20958;942;He's sexy with a Scottish accent!
I:20958;943;I'll stick to Daniel Craig in his blue shorts.
I:20958;944;Sean Connery may be white haired and an old man, but he's good, just not as Bond I'm afraid.
I:20958;945;I had been waiting for the release(s) of the early Sean Connery Bond films and I am truly impressed!
I:20958;946;The sound and picture on my home system is simply awesome!
I:20958;947;"The (2) commentaries
I:20958;948;At $$$$ each, MGM/UA have given Bond fans their money's worth.
I:20958;949;watch it since my teen.
I:20958;950;The acting was good, the evil man looked evil and of course his girls were, well James Bond hotties.
I:20958;951;This was fun, entertaining and though I knew how it finished, still had an edge of seat feel to it.
I:20958;952;Even the music is great.
I:20958;953;i give it Storytellers 5 stars, which means you can't go wrong
I:20958;954;"Sean Connery is a spy/lover legend
I:20958;955;both to see and own.
I:20958;956;a fun and memorable film.
I:20958;957;But the master criminal pulls a perfect switcheroo and escapes, in time to confront James and Galore one final time onboard a private jet bound for Washington.
I:20958;958;"the film brims with memorable scenes, including a terrifically funny ""what kept you?"""
I:20958;959;I have been a Bond fan since I was young.
I:20958;960;I recently got a blu.
I:20958;961;This was an excellent edition.
I:20958;962;I love the remastery of this film.
I:20958;963;the ad line for every Bond film makes that statement.
I:20958;964;"The films has the best of just about everything of the series: the best heroine (Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore)
I:20958;965;This is one of the few films in the series that actually improved upon the original Ian Fleming novel.
I:20958;966;Goldfinger has transcended the series and become one of the classic cult films of the 1960's.
I:20958;967;In every way possible, Goldfinger is a true classic.
I:20958;968;Wow factor 1.10 #8Can't compare this disc toDr No # 10 orFrom Russia with love # 10But still the best i've ever seen this Bold look .
I:20958;969;this is my favorite of all Bonds so I've seen it many times.
I:20958;970;One of the best of the classic Bond films.
I:20958;971;well, two out of three ain't bad.
I:20958;972;Probably one of the best classic bond films.
I:20958;973;Goldfinger is my all time favorite bond movie!
I:20958;974;I could watch it a million times!
I:20958;975;Sean Connery is the best Bond ever!
I:20958;976;There are enough 'bonus' features on this disc to keep you entertained for weeks.
I:20958;977;The commentary track featuring the director Guy Hamilton, and Honor Blackman (among others) is extremely interesting.
I:20958;978;scenes photos, nostalgic radio and TV ads, interviews and TWO full.
I:20958;979;Of course 'Goldfinger' is probably the most entertaining Bond movie of them all .
I:20958;980;and the widescreen master presented here looks fantastic.
I:20958;981;One of my all time favorites.
I:20958;982;It was nice to re.
I:20958;983;The old Bond is the best!
I:20958;984;Arguably the best Bond movie ever.
I:20958;985;Lot's of fun and Sean works and plays well with others.
I:20958;986;Guy Hamilton took over directing duties, and recognised the whole tongue in cheek potential of the franchise, as exemplified by the opening sequence, and ran with that.
I:20958;987;Suave, funny, action packed, and of course just a little bit over the top.
I:20958;988;the Aston Martin is introduced in spectacular form, and the women are both beautiful and played by talented actresses.
I:20958;989;John Barry has also crafted a fully realised score for the movie far superior to his earlier work on Bond movies.
I:20958;990;His comfort in the role without yet being tired of it adds immeasurably to the charm of the movie.
I:20958;991;Secondly, the true measure of a Bond movie is in how good the villain is .
I:20958;992;and Gert Frobe makes a fantastic megalomaniac.
I:20958;993;The character, as well as key movie plotlines, rely on his bombastic enthusiasm for boasting, and Frobe makes this a believable trait.
I:20958;994;whether you like the comedic elements or not, the fact is that Guy Hamilton clearly got the balance right to appeal to the widest possible audience.
I:20958;995;Despite these additions, the best of all is still the entertaining and thorough half hour documentary and movie commentary from the Special Edition.
I:20958;996;And as the most defining iconic movie of a 20th Century hero, this movie has more than enough entertainment value to override the quibbles and make this a 5 star success.
I:20958;997;Love all the James Bond movies, Goldfinger is great!
I:20958;998;one of the best classic Bonds made.
I:20958;999;I love the cheesiness of the time period.
I:20958;1000;It's a good kind of cheese though.
I:20958;1001;Unarguably the best Bond film ever.
I:20958;1002;stop action, and Connery at his best.
I:20958;1003;this one is a classic.
I:20958;1004;I own all 3 sets and it is the most enthralling of the series to date.
I:20958;1005;Goldfinger plays a great villian and Connery is sexy.
I:20958;1006;"There is also ""Pussy Galore"" for the guys."
I:20958;1007;Odd Job is introduced as Goldfingers bodygaurd, and golf caddy, and a great standoff between he and Bond in the end.
I:20958;1008;"the classic line ""Lets have a little fun with Mr Goldfinger""Bond tricks Goldfinger by switching golf balls."
I:20958;1009;"Connery will always be associated with James Bond and ""Goldfinger"" will always be considers his best film."
I:20958;1010;Honor Blackman is the ultimate Bond girl, Gert Frobe, the ultimate Bond villian and Bond's Astin Martin, the ultimate vehicle.
I:20958;1011;the plus side: MGM's menu page, its jam packed extra features and an intelligent audio commentary are all sparkling additions to compliment this classic spy thriller.
I:20958;1012;It really is that good.
I:20958;1013;The suave, unflappable super spy in his baby blue terrycloth robe, the cartoonish villains, the absurd dastardly plan, the Bond girls with smart mouths, the outrageous action, the amazing scenery, and all the little Bond signifiers we've come to love and expect.
I:20958;1014;A beautiful retrospective of the 60's mindset Sex, booze, stronger, faster, smarter and lets not forget gold.
I:20958;1015;i loved it when it came out and I love it 50yrs latter.
I:20958;1016;This 1964 release is probably one of the most memorable Bonds ever.
I:20958;1017;A great screenplay that has one of the most sinister and memorable villains in the franchise, Auric Goldfinger.
I:20958;1018;"The film also contains a Bond Bunny with the most memorable name, Pussy Galore: a name that would become a parody in Mike Meyer's later ""Austin Powers"" spoofs."
I:20958;1019;The film also includes perhaps the most memorable gadget car: an Astin.
I:20958;1020;this is probably one of the best Bonds of all time with dastardly villains, memorable Bond Bunnies, and a great overall plot.
I:20958;1021;I understand this was an awesome movie at the time.
I:20958;1022;New ideas, cutting edge technologies, and great actions created the future of the movie when it was released.
I:20958;1023;Still is a great movie.
I:20958;1024;For starters, you get a pair of entertaining audio commentaries, two very informative documentaries .
I:20958;1025;of course, the film stars the invincible Sean Connery, who was absolutely born to portray the World's Greatest Spy.
I:20958;1026;Gert Frobe nearly steals the show with his over the top portrayal of the title character.
I:20958;1027;Harold Sakata's Oddjob, with his deadly bowler hat, is the series' greatest henchman.
I:20958;1028;Honor Blackman is truly mesmerizing in the role of Pussy Galore.
I:20958;1029;Ironically, Shirley Eaton, who had less than 10 minutes of screen time, provides one of the most everlasting images in film history.
I:20958;1030;And last, but not least, is Shirley Bassey who belts out the most memorable of all Bond songs.
I:20958;1031;Bassey doesn't merely sing, she growls with passion.
I:20958;1032;Goldfinger has aged remarkably well.
I:20958;1033;Younger fans, who have grown up with the Brosnan films, will probably be satisfied with Goldfinger's generous action quotient.
I:20958;1034;I have always been a fan of the Bond Movies and this is one of my favorites.
I:20958;1035;Here we see Sean Connery at his undoubted best.
I:20958;1036;Goldfinger has a solid plot devised by gold.
I:20958;1037;obsessed industrialist Auric Goldfinger, one of cinema's most enduring villains, the fantastic Aston Martin DB5, one of cinema's most enduring cars, and Oddjob, quite possibly the best henchman in the series.
I:20958;1038;Anyway, Goldfinger ranks as one of the best Bonds ever made and if you want a Bond film to add to your video collection, don't hesitate to pick this one.
I:20958;1039;Though the 3rd of the series, this film launched James Bond into pop culture outer space.
I:20958;1040;happy villian,a hat throwing karate chopping henchman,a gold painted dead Bond girl, and another girl with a name that people whispered and giggled about in '65.
I:20958;1041;This is the film that made me a Bond fan forever, thought OHMSS became my favorite.
I:20958;1042;I think this is one of the greatest Bonds ever!
I:20958;1043;As I said, it's a great movie overall.
I:20958;1044;One of the bezst opening scenes from a bond movie in my opinion, and very sexy bond girls to boot.
I:20958;1045;This was, and still is, the very best of the Bond series, the moment where everything came together and the formula for all the subsequent Bond films was set.
I:20958;1046;Though a product of its time (meaning it's not always particularly PC), it's the greatest and most legendary of the Bonds with one classic scene after another.
I:20958;1047;The ultimate Bond in this fantastic re.
I:20958;1048;master of Goldfinger sizzles the screen!
I:20958;1049;Trevor Young steps down and Guy Hamilton takes us on a new Bond trip!
I:20958;1050;Hamilton modernizes the series and gives it panache with great twists and turns!
I:20958;1051;There's an involving main villain played brilliantly by the lead actor.
I:20958;1052;The Bond babe 'Pussy Galore' is a mature woman with character and the scenes between the sexy Connery and this sexy woman are classic!
I:20958;1053;The scenes are well edited and the rhythm of the film set a standard for the fans and for future Bond films!
I:20958;1054;One of the best in the series!
I:20958;1055;Goldfinger , released in 1964 is the third film of the James Bond series and like the two preceding film in the series, Goldfinger is based on Ian Fleming's novel of the same name.
I:20958;1056;Shirley Bassey sets the mood in the opening credits with her award winning redition of the Goldfinger theme song and the mood is continued with the film score.
I:20958;1057;The armorer Q's character is established fully for the first time, displaying his genius for developing the tools of spycraft and displaying his disdain for Bond and his antics.
I:20958;1058;the cast, interesting enough, contains several actors from familiar British TV series.
I:20958;1059;the original Bond formula created by Terence Young and the new elements from Guy Hamiltion combined with a suspenseful plot, lots of action and a fine cast made Goldfinger the strongest Bond effort to date and the results paid off quite handsomely at the box office.
I:20958;1060;I mean, tapes have the usual bugaboos, yes, (wrinkles, the occasional dropouts, the VERY rare occurence of breakage,) but the picture is usually beautifully saturated, full and well defined.
I:20958;1061;are nice, with extensive behind.
I:20958;1062;scenes info on the production of the film and trivia about Gert Frobe's reading of the title role and that great car.
I:20958;1063;"Goldfinger offers us the best of everything: the best Bond (Sean Connery, in his best performance as 007)
I:20958;1064;Oddjob (Harold Sakata) is the best of the villain henchmen seen in the series, with his deadly derby hat.
I:20958;1065;Bond's Aston Martin DB.5 ( With modifications, as Q so eloquently understates) is the best of all the Bond cars to date, as well as the most stylish.
I:20958;1066;Along with Dr. No and From Russia, with Love, Goldfinger completes the pantheon of the three best films in the series.
I:20958;1067;This is the first movie I can remember going to and now I own it on Blu.
I:20958;1068;What can you say about the quintessential Bond movie.
I:20958;1069;Love Sean as Bond and he's at his best in this movie.
I:20958;1070;Classic bond with lots of fun extras and a pristine blu ray restoration.
I:20958;1071;the best of the Connery bond flicks IMHO.
I:20958;1072;I'll make this short and sweet .
I:20958;1073;Excellent work by Connery and the rest of the cast.
I:20958;1074;great color and acting and stars and all that but even so it's just a movie and I think the staff did their job well to put out a product that satisfies the curious.
I:20958;1075;Goldfingerdeserves better and with the blue.
I:20958;1076;ray I can enjoy the wholepackage .
I:20958;1077;This one has my favorite all.
I:20958;1078;time line in a Bond movie.
I:20958;1079;Starring the real James Bond , Sean Connery, Goldfinger is one of the classics in this series of adventure and escape movies.
I:20958;1080;While not a movie to see over and over again, it provides lots of entertainment, a few twitters, and a pleasant evening of viewing.
I:20958;1081;Color fidelity is exceptional throughout the film and remains stable from start to finish.
I:20958;1082;"This Blu Ray edition of Goldfinger is a ""must have"" for the serious Bond fan."
I:20958;1083;The Blu Ray transfer is so good that you'll feel like you're watching the movie for the first time.
I:20958;1084;really nice visual detail in comparison to earlier editions.
I:20958;1085;The script holds up well, even 40+ years after the initial release.
I:20958;1086;Honor Blackman (formerly of British TV's 'The Avengers' series), is an excellent love interest for Mr. Bond.
I:20958;1087;And don't forget, this is the Bond flick that introduces the legendary Aston Martin, and plenty of other memorable Bond gadgetry.
I:20958;1088;Connery's Bond personna is well developed by this time . . . I could go on, but the bottom line is that the Blu Ray edition of this movie really rocks.
I:20958;1089;gOLDFINGER showcases Connery in his third outing, and perhaps, in his most complete.
I:20958;1090;He not only seamlessly integrates action, comedy, and super.
I:20958;1091;tech and gets you in the Bond mood.
I:20958;1092;all in all, GOLDFINGER ranks among the top.5 Bond films, while enduring as a ground.
I:20958;1093;good movie i jus got it for my mother really but she loved it .
I:20958;1094;its old school but still good one
I:20958;1095;I think this is the best of Sean Connery as being Bond.
I:20958;1096;The action, the music, the acting, everything was superb.
I:20958;1097;I was hooked the entire ride.
I:20958;1098;check it out if you're into the Bond universe!
I:20958;1099;One of classic, all time favorite James Bond movies.
I:20958;1100;Connery is masterful, Gert Frobe is great as Auric Goldfinger (althrough he had such a horrendous German accent, they had to dub in his voice for the entire movie).
I:20958;1101;Honor Blackman is absolutely terrible as Pussy Galore, but she's nice to look at.
I:20958;1102;It's the most romantic of all James Bond films, the most well acted of all James Bond films and has the BEST music score of all James Bond films.
I:20958;1103;Each scene is more trilling then the next, the bitter/sweet romance between Pussy Galore and Bond is the most sexy of all the 007 movies and Sean Connery proves that HE is the best James Bond of them all.
I:20958;1104;No other James Bond movie has had the impact that this one great story does and out of all his movies is the most believable.
I:20958;1105;Could you imagine hearing that music being played on a THX sound system in full stereo sound.
I:20958;1106;"roger Moore who i respect and love as an actor especially in the role of Michael Stewart in ""The Miracle"", my very first review and my all time BEST PICTURE will never have the ""class"" that Sean Connery has in just this one film."
I:20958;1107;ray succeeds again with Goldfinger.
I:20958;1108;I would recommend this to anyone who is a James Bond fan who doesn't have the Blu.
I:20958;1109;My brother and I, along with two neighbor friends traveled to this early strip mall movie house in my old Chevy (I was the only one old enough to drive).
I:20958;1110;Later Bond movies hae tried to maintain this fun aspect, with mixed result.
I:20958;1111;I keep coming back, starting with doubling back to the first two the very next week.
I:20958;1112;"The old Stoneridge knew their audience, me and the guys attended a double feature of ""Dr. No"" and ""From Russia With Love"" that they ran for guys like us."
I:20958;1113;otherwise the clarity was good.
I:20958;1114;Goldfinger opened to huge box office business in 1964,hyped like never before by United Artists.
I:20958;1115;it is one of the most unique in movie history.
I:20958;1116;he opens a panel and sneaks inside,wary of the various guards walking about.
I:20958;1117;he removes his wetsuit to reveal a fine tuxedo beneath.
I:20958;1118;he walks into a nearby bar and very soon after the refinery blows up in spectacular fashion.
I:20958;1119;the movies' theme music plays,sung wonderfully and most fittingly by Shirley Bassey.
I:20958;1120;if these Connery Bond movies had nothing else they had fantastic and endearing theme songs accompanying them,with top singers of the day to do the honours.
I:20958;1121;the opening credits shows us more and more flesh than ever before and each beauty is painted in gold,in keeping with the theme.
I:20958;1122;there he spies beautiful Shirley Eaton,Goldfingers' assistant,lying face forward on a recliner looking through binocs at Goldfingers' opponents' hand and radioing it to him.
I:20958;1123;bond puts a quick stop to this and puts the squeeze on Shirley.
I:20958;1124;before you can say 007 he has bedded the fair maiden and they are enjoying the after glow.
I:20958;1125;james returns to London to be debriefed and to have a meeting with some top European bankers.
I:20958;1126;"we are also introduced to another famous ""toy"",James' famous Aston Martin,fully equipped and then some."
I:20958;1127;sommes is killed and Bond captured.
I:20958;1128;this will enable Goldfinger and friends to enter and steal the gold.
I:20958;1129;it will detonate and make the gold unusable for many years to come.
I:20958;1130;bond works his way down to the bowels of the facility,killing Oddjob along the way.
I:20958;1131;But for the rest of the answers you'll have to watch for yourself!So ended another thrill ride of a picture in the now three year series.
I:20958;1132;they loved the film and especially the star who was making it all happen.
I:20958;1133;they were smart sticking to formula and Connery by now had the character down inside and out.
I:20958;1134;it added a new toy to Bonds' stable,the Aston Martin spy car,the music was top notch and its' sung nuances by Bassey were a perfect fit to the film.
I:20958;1135;also that powerful iconic image created in a short but powerful scene early on in the film,the girl with the gold paint.
I:20958;1136;all in all a good movie and with the new remastering done by MGM it is a wonder to see and hear.
I:20958;1137;It brought back memories of seeing my first James Bond movie and it still has the James Bond flair and magic.
I:20958;1138;This is the quintessential James Bond film.
I:20958;1139;Probably the best opening song of any Bond film, probably the best Bond villain and villain name, one of the best love interests and names, the definitive car (in the books Bond is attached to a Bentley, but in the films we primarily associate him with his Aston Martin), and best evil henchman (Odd Job).
I:20958;1140;And possibly the best throwaway line in all the Bond films.
I:20958;1141;This movie has permeated popular culture to a degree matched by few films.
I:20958;1142;"the superb Aston Martin DB5 entrusted to him on the ""Goldfinger"" mission."
I:20958;1143;"Armed with a bar of gold as bait, Bond is assigned to uncover the truth about the man with the ""Midas touch."
I:20958;1144;is perfectly cast in the role.
I:20958;1145;He's an overweight man, but he's dressed smartly and expensively, and he has a certain lightness and grace to him.
I:20958;1146;He's also supremely confident, self.
I:20958;1147;honor Blackman is the first of a long line of James Bond females with patently sexual names.
I:20958;1148;the Swiss location shots add an international dimension to the fun with the chase along the overwhelming Swiss highways with the Alps in the background.
I:20958;1149;", and with a fairy tense plot between a large number of highlights, and an expected spread of gadgetry, great women, and a menacing heavy with a deadly weapon, ""Goldfinger"" is probably the liveliest and most amusing of the Bond spy spoofs."
I:20958;1150;This is arguably the best James Bond movie.
I:20958;1151;The casting is impeccable, and Sean Connery is at his best in this one.
I:20958;1152;He is a fallible human being with a weakness for gorgeous women which, admittedly, he seems to luck into more than is probably humanly possible, but then again why not?
I:20958;1153;I trust that a re.
I:20958;1154;if you can get passed the special affects.
I:20958;1155;I've got to get an Austin Martin.
I:20958;1156;Sean Connery is best James Bond to date and Goldfinger has been one of the best Bond movies of all time and hold up so well to date.
I:20958;1157;The women in the movie are of great beauty to the eyes.
I:20958;1158;The story in so well told and moves very good into what is James Bond, from the USA to the world and back to USA and Fort Knox and gold.
I:20958;1159;Sean Connery is the only James Bond worth watching!
I:20958;1160;Bond first meets Goldfinger when he catches the super.
I:20958;1161;Then he challenges Goldfinger to a friendly game of golf (friendly because Bond allows the cheating to go on), which leads to a break.
I:20958;1162;"fated decision to spare Bond caps a scene in which 007 and Foe share the most memorable dialog of any bond flick ""You expect me to talk?"""
I:20958;1163;The biggest thrill of all is how the film is like an attempt to film Bond as if it were directed by Hitchkock .
I:20958;1164;The villain's rotund shape, suggestive of Hitchkock's famous profile, is probably the strongest sign.
I:20958;1165;edge Derby do his talking for him.
I:20958;1166;After all these years Goldfinger still thrills, despite the inept Fort Knox scenario, Bond and Oddjob give it a jolt.
I:20958;1167;It's plot was good, but the great US Army battle scene steered away from traditional Bond action.
I:20958;1168;now, if you're a Bond fan, you know that this is one of the best in the series.
I:20958;1169;And I actually bought it for the letter box format and better sound.
I:20958;1170;Well put together and very informative, with great interviews.
I:20958;1171;The movie that all Bonds, Including Die Another Day and the bond to follow will forever be juged.
I:20958;1172;The birth of the classic bond car.
I:20958;1173;Goldfinger is a film that will always portrait Bond in the best light possible.
I:20958;1174;The plot flows very nicely unlike most of the early bond films and therefore makes understanding it a whole lot easier.
I:20958;1175;I couldnt believe how clear it was and how real life the color was.
I:20958;1176;Sound is superb as well.
I:20958;1177;Must see for all Bond Fanatics!Overall, Goldfinger is my third favorite bond.
I:20958;1178;Thank you Amazon for making 007 available.
I:20958;1179;I am a James Bond fan and love to watch them over and over :)Thanks again.
I:20958;1180;the many reviewers are right on target about Goldfinger being the best of the 007 films by its classiness and style.
I:20958;1181;first, while Dr. No has the closest feel to Ian Fleming's Jamaica environment and From Russia with Love is the most realistic vis a vis the Russians with dark realistim, Goldfinger captures the JFK/Cuba mood the best with its opening teaser of 007 in scuba gear blowing up an installation and then getting into a fight in a cabana over a girl.
I:20958;1182;the powerful, haunting score of the modern.
I:20958;1183;day Midas propels you throughout the movie reminding you again and again that you are in an epic encounter between good/evil and there are dangerous girls to be had every step of the way!I'm surprised that a lot of the reviewers refer to the Fort Knox battle as the finale .
I:20958;1184;The film sets you up with 007 about to be rewarded by a trip to the White House in the president's personal jet for saving the West, when UHHO!
I:20958;1185;Goldfinger has by this time had enough of Bond and his mouth!
I:20958;1186;is what I relish most about the film.
I:20958;1187;Goldfinger is one of the best Bond movies because the story, hero and hottie, and villain with power and big bad guy with a razor sharp hat.
I:20958;1188;The whole screenplay and film are tight to the story line.
I:20958;1189;though I don't think it's the best in the series or it's Connery's best, it is still great.
I:20958;1190;sean Connery delivres a great acting performance as do Honor Blackman and Gert Frobe.
I:20958;1191;the climax in Fort Knox was excellent.
I:20958;1192;shirley Bassey's title song was one of the best in the series.
I:20958;1193;the score by John Barry was great too.
I:20958;1194;though Thunderball, The Spy who Loved Me, and GoldenEye are better, I heavily recommend Goldfinger too.
I:20958;1195;As an expert on james bond I think this flim is great it is one of my favoute bond flims it has the best bond vehical and charachters and its my favoute sean connery bond film.
I:20958;1196;Terrific edition of the Bond classic with documentaries and other extras.
I:20958;1197;James Bond was the ultimate male fantasy, (irresistible to women) and even though his character would be deemed sexist, he would protect whomever he bedded with his life.
I:20958;1198;So, he was also a woman's fantasy as well.
I:20958;1199;"His Japanese henchman, ""Odd Job"" likes destroying things and people with his steel rimmed hat!"
I:20958;1200;"Honor Blackman plays ""Pussy Galore"" and is one of the most memorable Bond women ever."
I:20958;1201;Connery's delivery of her first name still is a crack up and reminds the viewer not to take the proceedings all that seriously.
I:20958;1202;This is where the script comes in, there are so many fun characters and mini plot lines going on that the viewer never really realizes just how simple the idea for this film is!
I:20958;1203;"With the exception of ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" (1969), it's hard to top the excitement and inventiveness of ""Goldfinger."""
I:20958;1204;The villains, gadgets and locales are top notch, with Connery in splendid form.
I:20958;1205;Many will argue over which is the best bond movie in the franchise .
I:20958;1206;"If you like gadgets, cars with impressive arsenals and catchy names with double entendre than more than likely you're favorite Bond movie might be ""Goldfinger""."
I:20958;1207;the movie begins with an unforgettable entrance, a pre.
I:20958;1208;honestly really had nothing to do with the rest of the movie, but hey it works fabulously.
I:20958;1209;while the plot is a bit fantasy, newcomer to the franchise Guy Hamilton, he brings a magnificent touch of believable fantasy.
I:20958;1210;It didn't work, Goldfinger is a timeless classic that works perfect and is in my opinion the best of the extravaganza entries.
I:20958;1211;the best of the best james bond movies, fun to watch and a classic.
I:20958;1212;Goldfinger just may be the most exciting Bond adventure.
I:20958;1213;It has its full of heart pounding action and humor.
I:20958;1214;It also has some very good music in it.
I:20958;1215;Sean Connery is excellent in it as 007.
I:20958;1216;Also it has one the very best of the Bond enemies in it Oddjob.
I:20958;1217;He is a great character in this film.
I:20958;1218;After 'From Russia With Love' comes probably the most famous and best Connery and best James Bond film ever.
I:20958;1219;One of my favorite Bond films, a classic.
I:20958;1220;The cinematography is first rate.
I:20958;1221;It's fitting that the best Bond film would receive the best blu.
I:20958;1222;Outside of some FX shots, which are unavoidably soft because of the source material, this film is sharp and looks like it was filmed yesterday.
I:20958;1223;The level of detail is astounding.
I:20958;1224;When you see the stunning Jill Masterson covered in gold, you'll swear you never saw the shot before.
I:20958;1225;It has honestly improved that much.
I:20958;1226;For a movie that's half a century old, the soundtrack is truly something to behold.
I:20958;1227;But we still get a couple of great commentary tracks and a plethora of SD content created for previous releases.
I:20958;1228;goldfinger is the classic Bond to own.
I:20958;1229;Only the two most recent Bond films, starring Daniel Craig, look better.
I:20958;1230;I was happy with the price and the delivery time on this movie.
I:20958;1231;I love James Bond movies, and this is a favorite for me.
I:20958;1232;Amazon is the spot to find vintage films.
I:20958;1233;My Dad loves James Bond movies, so having this available at anytime is helpful cause he will watch over again and again
I:20958;1234;Taken in context of when Goldfinger was made, it's understandable why it's so widely considered as the best Bond.
I:20958;1235;The title is classic and well publicized, as well as the name of the lead female role, Pussy Galore.
I:20958;1236;There's even a nice little tid.
I:20958;1237;boy in the movie Trainspotting, another excellent film.
I:20958;1238;The plot is solid, intriguing and was transferred onto the screen with believability.
I:20958;1239;I have been hooked ever since.
I:20958;1240;Pretty women, fast cars, and one very cool character.
I:20958;1241;You just gotta love it!
I:20958;1242;It's interesting to see a plot that's still somewhat relevant today, and even cooler to know that it's the first use of a laser and it's no less effective now.
I:20958;1243;Sean Connery was always THE James Bond, but he really shows it in the second Bond film, Goldfinger.
I:20958;1244;The plot is fantastic, Oddjob makes the perfect assistant to a very clumsy villian.
I:20958;1245;The beginning scene of the girl covered in gold paint was a brilliant idea on Ian Flemings part, and I really enjoyed the part when Sean was in the prison cell.
I:20958;1246;Goldfinger is classic Bond and demonstrates the best of the series.
I:20958;1247;Sean Connery is suave and cool as 007 and launches the franchise to new heights with this installment.
I:20958;1248;Great music along with original Sean Connery .

I:20958;1251;Connery brings his characteristic savoir fare to the role.
I:20958;1252;Gert Frobe gives an excellent performance as Goldfinger.
I:20958;1253;M, Q, Miss Moneypenny, and Felix all appear in this movie.

I:20958;1255;The picture has been digitally restored and I'm sure the picture is just as good (if not better!!)
I:20958;1256;As well, there is one extra in the form of an audio commentary.
I:20958;1257;"disc Ultimate Edition since the second disc has ""the best collection of special features ever assembled for Bond."""
I:20958;1258;In conclusion, this movie is the first official Bond blockbuster thus making it a must.
I:20958;1259;This is a must have for Bond enthusiasts.
I:20958;1260;This movie put Bond over the top.
I:20958;1261;up gadget car (hailed by many as still the best).
I:20958;1262;"It introduced us to the first ""larger."

I:20958;1264;Gert Frobe left a memorable impression as the titular nemesis, and is also a fan.
I:20958;1265;Finale, it features the first of many double.
I:20958;1266;"For the first time, Bond is placed in an elaborate ""machine."
I:20958;1267;Yeah, it's a lasting image no doubt .
I:20958;1268;And yes, it provides us with the first classic Bond line .
I:20958;1269;however, it is a really silly moment compared to the series up to that point, and begins to take us into the more fantastic and out of the more believable.
I:20958;1270;In the above mentioned scene, all Bond has to do is suggest he knows more than Goldfinger thinks he does about his fiendish plot, and Goldfinger gives in and allows him to live.
I:20958;1271;That being said, there is still plenty of charm in this film .
I:20958;1272;and it is still a Bond classic, if only for its score, villain, and Connery's most relaxed and comfortable performance in the role.
I:20958;1273;This is probably the best James Bond movie.
I:20958;1274;Everything works right in this film.
I:20958;1275;Best name for a female.
I:20958;1276;Goldfinger is one of the greatest Bond movies ever made.
I:20958;1277;It is full of action and suspense.
I:20958;1278;Sean Connery does a great job as James Bond, Gert Frobe plays Goldfinger perfectly, and Harold Sakata is great in the chilling role of Oddjob (Who has a steel.
I:20958;1279;The action sequences are spectacular, and are perfectly blended in with the rest of the movie.
I:20958;1280;From an explosive teaser to a car chase in the mountains of Switzerland, and from a climatic battle in Fort Knox to a suspenseful fight to the death aboard an airplane, Goldfinger comes out to be one of the best and smartest movies in the James Bond series, filled with action, suspense, and elaborate set.
I:20958;1281;A must for James Bond fans or fans of any kind of action and suspense movies.
I:20958;1282;For those who haven't seen Goldfinger, please treat yourself.
I:20958;1283;I love how easy women just submitto James.
I:20958;1284;It's a really good movie, easy to follow premise, and filled with iconic James bond characters.
I:20958;1285;Another classic bond that anyone who admires the bond series wound love to have in their collection.
I:20958;1286;ray, this is the one I wanted to get.
I:20958;1287;One of the great Bond flicks.
I:20958;1288;It is still a great movie in the 21st century.
I:20958;1289;I enjoyed seeing Sean Connery in his prime.
I:20958;1290;In Miami, Bond seduces Goldfinger's gorgeous confederate Jill Masterson, who helps 007 humiliate her boss by exposing him as a cheat at cards.
I:20958;1291;stakes golf game, Bond .
I:20958;1292;from The Essential Bond by Lee Pfeiffer and Dave WorrallThe first Bond film to be classified as a box.
I:20958;1293;Goldfinger and Oddjob are two of the series' best villains.
I:20958;1294;We really enjoyed this movie, even tho it is an old one.
I:20958;1295;Full of action and suspense.
I:20958;1296;loved watching it even though I've seen it before.
I:20958;1297;Goldfinger is the first James Bond film to become a true blockbuster.
I:20958;1298;After the first two 007 films, this third Bond adventure cemented forever the style and fun of the series.
I:20958;1299;Sean Connery is the classic action hero this time.
I:20958;1300;He gives Bond an invulnerable twinkle this time and gives the character many comic touches which lets the audience know that he's having fun.
I:20958;1301;what makes this Bond effort much more fun than the previous two films and the many after it, is the producers' effort to focus on a very inventive plot rather than the cold war espionage which was so effective in From Russia With Love , and a memorable villian.
I:20958;1302;Much of the success of a particular Bond film has a lot to do with the villian in that installment.
I:20958;1303;Goldfinger is the best villian of the Bond series.
I:20958;1304;He's incredibly inventive, rich beyond our wildest imaginations, greedy, intent on world dominance, a sore loser, and a cheater at golf.
I:20958;1305;Much of the success of this film has to do with this character, so much in fact that many Bond films afterward have had a villian very close to Goldfinger's describtion, especially in the Roger Moore era.
I:20958;1306;Bond's quips and amusement with the events in the film make the film more entertaining than it would be if he were playing it completely straight.
I:20958;1307;Goldfinger has the best villian in the series and has been the blueprint for many Bond films since but the fun and humor here is genuine.
I:20958;1308;This is truely THE definitive Bond movie ever produced thus far.
I:20958;1309;sean Connery, truly the only actor to ever emulate every aspect of the James Bond persona, gives a effortless performance as the master spy James Bond.
I:20958;1310;Connery's ease to go from wetsuit to tuxedo without blinking is a testament to the James Bond appeal and desire that is within the majority of men.
I:20958;1311;goldfinger, in my opinion, always sets the standard.
I:20958;1312;I won't repeat what just about everyone else says here: GOLDFINGER is probably the best James Bond movie ever made.
I:20958;1313;that's a great movie, no matter how you slice (or laser) it.
I:20958;1314;I have seen ALL the 007, Bond movies, this one has to be the best of all.
I:20958;1315;Its got the perfect mix of everything and is so well acted.
I:20958;1316;I've seen every bond film made, more than once.
I:20958;1317;And this one still remains his best.
I:20958;1318;And than you have Shirley Eaton in that Black Bikini.
I:20958;1319;But the Car steals the movie.
I:20958;1320;Even today, that is the Best movie car of all time.
I:20958;1321;And Sean Connery , the Best Bond.
I:20958;1322;The best of the best Bonds.
I:20958;1323;i got the first four Bonds in steel cases.
I:20958;1324;Sean Connery in his greatest role and the prime of his acting career.
I:20958;1325;Classic bond characters and a riveting plot.
I:20958;1326;It is the quintessential Bond film.
I:20958;1327;I love the cars and gadgets, Sean Connery is my favorite bond aside from Pierce Brosnan, and this is a classic, always willing to re.
I:20958;1328;watch the bond movies from this era.
I:20958;1329;I enjoyed watching this classic again after all these years.
I:20958;1330;Blu Ray makes it look great.
I:20958;1331;Sean Connery one of the best Bonds ever.
I:20958;1332;60s 70s 80s 90s 2000s always great action but in the 60s you get Connery a great believable tough guy.
I:20958;1333;Goldfinger is the greatest of all the James Bond series and the third one starring Sean Connery.
I:20958;1334;This is pure Bond throughout with several gorgeous leading ladies and plenty of the usual wittisisms.
I:20958;1335;Everything is here in this classic.
I:20958;1336;Great villain, exciting action, awesome theme song, beautiful Bond girl, and the famous Aston Martin.
I:20958;1337;He is and always will be the perfect James Bond.
I:20958;1338;With GOLDFINGER, the Bond series rose to new heights.
I:20958;1339;In my personal opinion, GOLDFINGER is the best of the Bond films and certainly my favorite.
I:20958;1340;Rarely does a film so entertaining and funny as GOLDFINGER come around .
I:20958;1341;"It has everything, firmly establishing the Bond formula: explosive beginning (""Shocking"")
I:20958;1342;"Connery is at his greatest as the British super spy
I:20958;1343;The score, by John Barry, is one of the finest of the original few films.
I:20958;1344;Of course, Guy Hamilton's directing is superb as well.
I:20958;1345;GOLDFINGER has been firmly established as one of the most entertaining films of our time.
I:20958;1346;Brings me back when I was young, with his car and when woman was turned to gold, and No Mr. bond you will Die!
I:20958;1347;"Gadgets, girls, attitude and a really great plot
I:20958;1348;It's a classic 1960s spy thriller.
I:20958;1349;Appropriately enough the first of the series to have a really imaginative use of colour, Goldfinger is in many ways the most visually sensual of the films, the unforgettable image of Shirley Eaton's golden girl reflected in a golden glow to much of Ted Moore's cinematography.
I:20958;1350;Ken Adam's production design is his possibly his finest hour, genuine architecture of the imagination that is at once both fantastic and strangely credible, maintaining a sense of scale and verisimilitude by his use of ceilings on the smaller sets.
I:20958;1351;"Even Blackman's villainy seems inextricably linked to her lesbianism (""You can turn off the charm, I'm immune"") but one good one from Bond and she's on the side of the angels."
I:20958;1352;Regardless, his Auric Goldfinger is easily the best of the Bond super.
I:20958;1353;Incredibly enjoyable and one of the best.
I:20958;1354;Plus the sound tack to goldfinger is cool!
I:20958;1355;most Bond fans claim that GOLDFINGER is the best Bond picture ever made.
I:20958;1356;"The movie has great villians, Goldfinger and his henchman sidekick Oddjob who wears a deadly derby
I:20958;1357;'Goldfinger' is the best James Bond movie, and one of the best spy movies.
I:20958;1358;It has an excellent story, very good direction, a very good soundtrack, and the best actor to every play Bond.
I:20958;1359;ray, and looks the best I've ever seen it.
I:20958;1360;The picture looks new and fresh, and the Bond girls look very curvaceous.
I:20958;1361;He would certainly have won the election if 6.18 year old boys had been able to vote!The movie has a simple but engaging plot that a twelve year old boy can appreciate.
I:20958;1362;This insightful observation comes from that fact that Bond is always being found out and captured by the bad guys (despite his fully.
I:20958;1363;This movie is still fun for me to watch, though.
I:20958;1364;Perhaps teething just a tad over the top, Goldfinger, unlike its two predecessors brought to the screen a polished, gourmet spy in James Bond.
I:20958;1365;This movie has everything, beautiful and sexy women, cool cars, villainous villains, gadgets.
I:20958;1366;gadgets, surprises, and Sean Connery.
I:20958;1367;This is easily the best secret.
I:20958;1368;The music is incredibly on target and set the stage for all Bond movies to follow.
I:20958;1369;The level of acting is top notch, from all performers.
I:20958;1370;I hadn't seen Goldfinger in quite some time, but I've been a Bond fan, and a Connery Bond fan in particular, since I was a kid, so I was especially anticipating the Blu.
I:20958;1371;This is due in no small part, of course, to the amazing film restoration process employed by Lowry Digital.
I:20958;1372;ray is capable, this is the disc to own .
I:20958;1373;Color saturation is rich, while still maintaining life.
I:20958;1374;"like realism (especially with respect to flesh tones)
I:20958;1375;especially with respect to the score.
I:20958;1376;i don't often focus on a disc's special features, but they are plentiful and interesting on this disc.
I:20958;1377;"I particularly enjoyed the ""making of"" featurette."
I:20958;1378;set interview during the Goldfinger shoot is also worth watching.
I:20958;1379;Occult classic Sean Connery the true bond forever.
I:20958;1380;first bond movie i saw ,was hooked since.
I:20958;1381;Always liked Connery as bond he was killer classy.
I:20958;1382;Goldfinger is the 2nd best in the bond series a little behind from russia with love.
I:20958;1383;The first to use American settings being Miami and Kentucky is a great memorial of the time period.
I:20958;1384;The films teaser with the belly dancer is to be rememberd, a beautifull lady from from russia with love in another role here.
I:20958;1385;Connery is more comical and more daring with the beautifull ladies most of all Shirley Eaton in her bathing suit, such a sexy lady and sexy voice, love her facial reactions and grin.
I:20958;1386;The lady pilots are beautifull and Guy Hamilton directs his first and best bond film.
I:20958;1387;The golf scene is one of the best of the series and the recording on this scene with nature and sounds on the golf course, listen to the birds, is perfect in its display.
I:20958;1388;Any fan of James Bond will love this movie.
I:20958;1389;I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
I:20958;1390;One of my favorite bond movies.
I:20958;1391;I received it in a timely fashion and the product itself was in excellent condition.
I:20958;1392;A lot of relived experiences to see the world as it was 50 years ago and still be James Bond interesting.
I:20958;1393;This classic James Bond film, which introduced 007 to the movie.
I:20958;1394;watching world, cleverly uses the reticence required by film.
I:20958;1395;Of course, James, handsome and irresistible as always, goes to bed with all the beautiful ladies he meets: Jill Masterson and her lovely sister Tillie, and later the inimitable Pussy Galore (whose name Sean Connery pronounces with delicate and lascivious irony).
I:20958;1396;Thus, modesty is transformed to suspense.
I:20958;1397;"James also dresses up so well
I:20958;1398;the commentary track featuring director Guy Hamilton and members of the crew(if my memory serves here I kept skipping around between regular audio and the commentary) is quite good and filled with some wonderful bits of trivia about shooting the movie.
I:20958;1399;Oh well I guess we can't have it all.
I:20958;1400;If you just want the film, this is a fine release.
I:20958;1401;And of all the Connery Bond films Goldfinger is the best.
I:20958;1402;Dr No and From Russia With Love were great and all, but Goldfinger really is THE bond film.
I:20958;1403;Easily in my top 5 of the series, and my favorite Connery bond film.
I:20958;1404;Jill Masterson and Oddjob are iconic, Goldfinger is a fantastic villain, and Pussy Galore is probably my favorite bond girl, along with Vesper from Casino Royale.
I:20958;1405;Truly a classic peice of cinema.
I:20958;1406;top and is rightly considered a classic.
I:20958;1407;It's very iconic of mid.60's cinema .
I:20958;1408;Despite this, the next two films in the series are actually better .
I:20958;1409;"Thunderball made more at the box office than any other Bond flick from the Connery era and ""You Only Live Twice"" upped the ante with the action and spy stuff and is just more all."
I:20958;1410;In fact, one clash in the film is a simple game of golf between James and Goldfinger.
I:20958;1411;"bOTTOM LINE: ""Goldfinger"" is a James Bond classic, full of iconic imagery and scenes."
I:20958;1412;Regardless, it's definitely a worthy Bond flick and has it's own unique charm.
I:20958;1413;i love james bond movies.
I:20958;1414;The James Bond movie franchise is often characterized by wild shifts in tone.
I:20958;1415;"The best films are the ones that combine the ""best of both worlds""."
I:20958;1416;Goldfinger walks that fine line and turns in one of the better installments of the series.
I:20958;1417;this movie works so well because it does all the intangible things perfectly.
I:20958;1418;"james Bond"" line is used to perfection, the opening title music is some of the best ever, and the soundtrack throughout punctuates the action perfectly."
I:20958;1419;top, but still crazy enough to produce some romping adventure.
I:20958;1420;"The Bond movies have always lent themselves to being easily improved by better movie technology, so the earlier efforts like this one sometimes feel a bit ""slow"" compared to nowadays."
I:20958;1421;"overall, though, ""Goldfinger"" is a fun Bond effort that holds up better than most of the older Bond efforts."
I:20958;1422;"It does all the ""little Bond stuff"" right, and even throws in a decent plot and endearing characters."
