I:15899;1;A towering achievement, 'Babel,' provides a great alchemy.
I:15899;2;Last year's best films often had twisty, interlocking plots that came together from fragmented lives.
I:15899;3;Not only that but the beautiful cinematography (courtesy Rodrigo Prieto) and the wonderfully placed soundtrack from Gustavo Santanella (both of 'Brokeback Mountain' fame) are just a few of the nuances in this brilliant movie.
I:15899;4;Both movies are grand and comprehensive with a theme: 'Babel' does for communication gaps what 'Syriana' did for the world oil industry and all its consuming problems.
I:15899;5;If movies are to give us escapist fare or illuminating transcendence, then 'Babel' succeeds in both by offering absorbing protagonists in a tight and ingenious story.
I:15899;6;'Babel' is a magnificent and brilliant film that never stops fermenting resources.
I:15899;7;The result is that Susan is shot, barely discerning its impact at first.
I:15899;8;Ties are made to the Japanese hunter with the gun found at the boys' home.
I:15899;9;But one development is a testament to the movie's marvelousness.
I:15899;10;Effective to every detail, the acting, editing, writing, and directing (Guillermo Arriaga and Alejandro Ina'rrita, respectively for the latter two) make 'Babel' a masterpiece.
I:15899;11;And a world of misunderstandings can take place with language barriers.
I:15899;12;Babel , the name of the molvie tells the story!
I:15899;13;Very interesting and unusually captivating movie on how we are all intertwined in our actions no matter where in the world we live.
I:15899;14;The story had me riveted from the beginning.
I:15899;15;The cinematography is wonderful and the grittiness is so very real.
I:15899;16;This movie is so much bigger than just Brad Pitt.
I:15899;17;The wonderful acting almost had me feeling the warm air of the desert as I began to feel if I was there.
I:15899;18;I will save the story for you the viewer but please be ready from an emotional joyride.
I:15899;19;It was real, incredibely real.
I:15899;20;It's almost hard to imagine the magnitude of such a film bringing so many cultures together.
I:15899;21;Yet it did and it did very well.
I:15899;22;Everyone played a part that you could imagine would be real.
I:15899;23;overall this movie is a must see.
I:15899;24;Even when there is a joyful scene a serious touch of reality comes.
I:15899;25;Generally this movie is worth many awards and hopefully it gets it's place in cinematic history.
I:15899;26;game (do they have any in Morocco) and leaves the rifle behind as a gift to his guide precipitating the events that bring all the families together.
I:15899;27;"If you want a movie that makes a statement, see ""Thank You For Smoking""."
I:15899;28;I was captivated by the depth and reality of this film.
I:15899;29;This movie is greatness the stories intertwine.
I:15899;30;Movie is great a must see.
I:15899;31;I looked forward to this movie as the reviews spoke of a great movie.
I:15899;32;One of the oddest movies I have seen.
I:15899;33;This gut wrenching film demonstrates both the necessity and impossibility of human communication, as well as the tragedies that can happen due to accidental or unintended mistakes.
I:15899;34;The acting was superb, the camera work excellent, transitioning from country to country and event to event with a seamless, understandable movement.
I:15899;35;The film won a Golden Globe for Best Drama, which I consider well deserved.
I:15899;36;This is riveting story telling that doesn't talk down to its audience.
I:15899;37;But that's often how real life works.
I:15899;38;Our stories are rarely told in isolation, and, ala the butterfly effect, our best.
I:15899;39;When Richard tells the nanny she can't have the day off, she makes the life.
I:15899;40;When the younger brother takes a pot shot at a passing tour bus, Susan (Blanchett) is shot and the complex plot is set in motion.
I:15899;41;The most tangential, yet in some ways the most provocative, thread is provided by the Japanese story, which centers on a deaf.
I:15899;42;mute young woman (played by charismatic newcomer Rinko Kikuchi), whose mother has committed suicide.
I:15899;43;"This approach to film making can come off as forced (think ""Crash""), but when it works (think the best films of Robert Altman), it can provide a singularly satisfying viewing experience, the sort of thing that both challenges and provokes audiences, and that keeps them coming back to the cinema."
I:15899;44;Indeed, Inarritu is such a masterful film.
I:15899;45;Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, is turning into quite the filmmaker.
I:15899;46;"His new film ""Babel"" is equally deserving of such praise."
I:15899;47;It is one of the year's best films.
I:15899;48;"given that the film's title is ""Babel"" the movie becomes a religious epic."
I:15899;49;It is a story of love, tolerance and forgiveness.
I:15899;50;The film makes us believe in these people.
I:15899;51;I was genuinely interested in what would happen to them.
I:15899;52;inarritu is proving himself to be one of the most gifted directors working today.
I:15899;53;He expresses the human condition in a lyrical and poetic way that hasn't been done since Ingmar Bergman.
I:15899;54;brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett star as Richard and Susan an American couple visiting Morocco.
I:15899;55;Susan gets into an accident.
I:15899;56;While travelling on a tour bus, she is hit by a bullet.
I:15899;57;how any of these stories connect I will leave up to you to go and see the movie but the connection are done in a masterful way.
I:15899;58;He become more and more involved in these characters and their situations.
I:15899;59;it's hard to say who gives the best performance in the film.
I:15899;60;This is a true ensemble piece.
I:15899;61;inarritu and company weave a story that will touch many people's hearts and challenge their minds.
I:15899;62;line: One of the year's best films.
I:15899;63;But it was a good movie.
I:15899;64;wrenching thriller has a recurring theme of loss that underpins the absolutely horrifying events that tie 3 continents together .
I:15899;65;It simply provides a voyeur's view of lives intertwined by the most coincidental of events.
I:15899;66;This movie is so overrated!
I:15899;67;Unlike most American flicks, this is a very moving and memorable picture.
I:15899;68;If you look for action or speed or spectacular explosions or sex, this is not the film for you, but if you want to see something deeply moving, some awesome sites (across 4 countries and 3 continents) and some amazing cinematography, this is the film for you!
I:15899;69;One of the best, cannot believe this got 3 stars and other trash here gets 4.
I:15899;70;An excellent movie worth watching.
I:15899;71;I read where this was Pitt's best performance but I disagree.
I:15899;72;It is merely a smartly put together piece of near.
I:15899;73;I thought the acting was good overall, but nothing outstanding.
I:15899;74;"Others have given it high acclaim
I:15899;75;For the first half I keep waiting for the real story to start.
I:15899;76;western vibe of how the West mistreats those who are less fortunate.
I:15899;77;it's a challenging work of art.
I:15899;78;driven, and for the most part, formulaic in the ways they meet our expectations.
I:15899;79;There are common threads running through its stories .
I:15899;80;Having watched both movies a second time since, I still feel that way.
I:15899;81;I think he's a great actor, love almost all of his other movies, but this one???
I:15899;82;This Mexican or Arabian fellow bought an illegal rifle and let his sons use it.
I:15899;83;I think that scene is what the whole movie was about and definitely worth the one star I gave it.
I:15899;84;Babel is a complex and stunning movie.
I:15899;85;The stories move slowly, and interconnect eventually, but they each stand on their own as well.
I:15899;86;I felt their emotions as I watched, and I think that is truly what makes this such an excellent film.
I:15899;87;The filmography was amazing and I loved how they played with the timeline, piecing the stories together through interconnected moments.
I:15899;88;It is definately worth it.
I:15899;89;You can certainly just take it for what you see in it.
I:15899;90;I have to say, one of my favorite movies I've seen in the past year or two.
I:15899;91;It captures well the lottery of violence and its consequences in our modern world.
I:15899;92;First I want to start with the trailers.
I:15899;93;the father discovers what the sons have done, and he beats them, thenthe kids take him to where they have hidden the gun.
I:15899;94;She finds a patrol officer finally, and tries to tellhim about the kids in the desert.
I:15899;95;Honestly, I believe you should go see it for yourself to truly judge.
I:15899;96;The previews for this movie were exciting, as the movie was not thatexciting, but still a good movie for what if offered.
I:15899;97;In other words, this is a well.
I:15899;98;"acted movie on the theme of the ""butterfly effect."""
I:15899;99;herd rural life and Japanese neon city life jolted the senses.
I:15899;100;The cast is excellent and the concept intriguing.
I:15899;101;the concept is undoubtedly interesting.
I:15899;102;The world is truly interconnected.
I:15899;103;"I suspect that I had the film ""Crash"" in mind when I saw ""Babel""."
I:15899;104;I thus had very high expectations.
I:15899;105;It is certainly worth seeing.
I:15899;106;A Japanese hunter gives a riffle to a Moroccan tour guide in thanks of a pleasurable hunting trip.
I:15899;107;`Babel' is an extremely well done film that, while never as a whole reaching levels of miraculous greatness, has moments of truly tender and emotional brilliance.
I:15899;108;Surprisingly it took me a while to actually get to this film, but I finally did and I'm happy the time had come.
I:15899;109;While it is probably my least favorite film but Inarritu (collectively) it actually has some of my favorite scenes he's ever directed (especially when involving the character of Chieko).
I:15899;110;"There are a few strands missing from this film in my opinion, a few loose ends that could have been tightened up
I:15899;111;the film centers around a stray bullet that hits an American tourist named Susan.
I:15899;112;Before they have a chance to manage anything more than a handhold Susan's life is put in danger.
I:15899;113;This storyline is probably the most rewarding yet the most damaging to the film.
I:15899;114;Chieko's story is the most fascinating and overall the most emotionally resonant of the entire film but it doesn't fit.
I:15899;115;the performances within this film are all beautiful to witness.
I:15899;116;Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett are touching and so brutally honest with their characters.
I:15899;117;The scene where he breaks down on the hospital phone is memorable and gripping.
I:15899;118;Adriana Barraza is marvelous as Amelia, especially as the film draws to a close.
I:15899;119;Her final scene with immigration is heartbreaking and so gritty and real.
I:15899;120;The standout here though is the marvelous Rinko Kikuchi who is utterly flawless as Chieko.
I:15899;121;Her character is so well fleshed out to where you feel her inner struggle and become one with her pain.
I:15899;122;`Babel' teaches us a powerful lesson about relationships with others and the responsibility we have as family, friends and in general human beings to take the time to truly listen to others.
I:15899;123;I enjoyed three of the plotlines, especially the Japanese stuff.
I:15899;124;Rinko Kikuchi is spectacular as a deaf mute teenager, and it's a treat to see Kji Yakusho.
I:15899;125;Director Alejandro Gonz lez I rritu does his best work in those scenes I think.
I:15899;126;As spectacular as the Moroccan mountainside scenes are, the passages from Kikuchi's viewpoint are fabulous.
I:15899;127;I've enjoyed him in many things.
I:15899;128;one of the best pictures of the century.
I:15899;129;everyone that travels should see this flick.
I:15899;130;Babel is such a fitting title for this movie that focuses on the theme of universal pain and hope.
I:15899;131;I sat there with my tear.
I:15899;132;smeared face and was surprised at my outburst of emotions.
I:15899;133;It was just so powerful and wonderfully moving.
I:15899;134;The acting was superb and overall the complete story arc was very interesting.
I:15899;135;Maybe Im just a sucker for a movie that has more of a happy ending.
I:15899;136;Babel is good, not great.
I:15899;137;The main purpose of the movie seems to stress the just how far and deep ripple effects can become.
I:15899;138;The link for all is a Winchester rifle that once belonged to a Japanese businessman.
I:15899;139;Perhaps the most compelling of these situations involves that man's teen daughter, a chronically depressed deaf mute who's obsessed with a police detective.
I:15899;140;director Alejandro Gonz lez I rritu gives us enough information along the way to hold our interest, revealing facts when necessary or timely.
I:15899;141;A mostly unknown cast give naturalistic performances, some of which will haunt you long after the credits start to roll.
I:15899;142;highest recommendation for a brilliant motion picture.
I:15899;143;It took until the end before I connected the dots and it started to make sense.
I:15899;144;"I loved Inarritu's ""Amores Perros"", I wasn't fond of ""21 Grams"", but ""Babel"" is Inarritu's best achievement as a filmmaker."
I:15899;145;"The tagline well fits the theme in the movie to ""Listen""."
I:15899;146;Yet humanity still tries and sometimes finds deep connection through compassion.
I:15899;147;This movie made me ponder this among other things.
I:15899;148;"Some people may think of this movie as similar to the Academy award winning ""Crash"", but ""Babel"" felt more heartfelt to me."
I:15899;149;"Also ""Babel"" was more aesthetically appealing (cinematography and score), and not as forceful in giving a message."
I:15899;150;"I was pleasantly surprised when ""Babel"" received the most nominations at the Golden Globes."
I:15899;151;"I hope that ""Babel"" is as well received at the Academy Awards, because it's definitely one of the strongest films I've seen in years, let alone 2006."
I:15899;152;It is a good movie but I feel it was not as good as Crash!
I:15899;153;It was a great movie.
I:15899;154;This film, since it won some Academy Awards and getting positive fame around the globe, giving me great enthusiasm.
I:15899;155;i really liked the theme or shall I say concept of the film, but it is no denying that the film was advertised more like a exciting spectacular film.
I:15899;156;Their fascion was like that of more than 5 years ago!Last but not least, I really liked the score of this film.
I:15899;157;it was a good movie.
I:15899;158;First of all the acting was wonderful.
I:15899;159;I enjoy movies where the plot jumps a great deal but this was a little out there.
I:15899;160;Dad finds daughter and what makes for a very touching father daughter moment???
I:15899;161;I know not all movies tie up all the loose ends and I even enjoy that in most movies.
I:15899;162;I liked Babel and the nanny goes to Mexico I can deal with.
I:15899;163;But the whole Japanese portion of the movie not only does not tie up any loose ends but just unraveled a movie that I otherwise enjoyed.
I:15899;164;At first it seems as though it will be excellent.
I:15899;165;I found BABEL to be hypnotic to the point that I wanted to see much more, and more.
I:15899;166;"Delicate elements of cinema are used harshly and sensibly
I:15899;167;The story is universal and timely.
I:15899;168;We the people of this wonderful global community need each other.
I:15899;169;Every single one of us matters and are responsible for what is going on across the earth.
I:15899;170;Slowly we are melting into ONE, regardless of space or culture .
I:15899;171;i loved how I rritu touched upon power and authority.
I:15899;172;Amazing what you will discover, and it is up to you how will you interpret it.
I:15899;173;BABEL holds up a large mirror for all of us to gaze in and understand who we really are.
I:15899;174;babel is a hymn to humanity, it is an elegy to our ONEness and interdependency.
I:15899;175;I am surprised at all the positive reviews.
I:15899;176;This movie has a great cast who seemed genuinely concerned about getting their message across.
I:15899;177;Babel's story line is a sermon/rant against a couple of important US policies .
I:15899;178;But she also is drawn into a casual clandestine encounter.
I:15899;179;Suspenseful and captivating, with a splash of love story!
I:15899;180;I Highly recommend this movie to everyone!
I:15899;181;This movie takes a very unique look at the cultural and linguistic barriers that exist in our world.
I:15899;182;Others have criticized the self.
I:15899;183;drum is elevated to cosmic self.
I:15899;184;"Brad Pitt is still searching for the BIG ROLE, the breakout movie in which he finally proves he is a ""serious"" actor (lol)."
I:15899;185;Alas, Richard comes across as, well, Brad Pitt playing Richard, which is fine for most of the viewing audience.
I:15899;186;One can admire the intricacies of the film, the attention to detail, the thematic relationships (a little heavy at times) and the subtlety but in the end the sum of the parts is less than the whole.
I:15899;187;The Moroccan story was the best of the movie.
I:15899;188;"much more effective than the big ""stars""."
I:15899;189;This was an interesting movie.
I:15899;190;Quite simply, a Korean man gifted a rifle to a fellow Moroccan hunter, who allowed his young children to use it, unsupervised.
I:15899;191;She should have told them why she took them to Mexico.
I:15899;192;She knew her nephew was drunk and stupidly took a chance, with two young children who were not hers.
I:15899;193;The other actors gave great performances.
I:15899;194;I've enjoyed many Brad Pitt movies and was looking forward to watching this one, but the story.
I:15899;195;And, since that is my reason for watching movies and spending my valuable time in front of a screen, well, you can see why I rated it a 2 star.
I:15899;196;It may have been lame but I liked it better when they used accents.
I:15899;197;I just want to enjoy a good story.
I:15899;198;A little confusing to see how it all relates together, but entertaining to watch.
I:15899;199;It leaves you feeling unresolved at the end.
I:15899;200;"I thought ""Babel"" was a story done exceptionally well."
I:15899;201;it is actually three stories in one.
I:15899;202;They appear to be nonrelated, but come together neatly as the story progresses.
I:15899;203;all seem a lifetime and a world apart, yet they all connect in an extraordinary way.
I:15899;204;sometimes painful, sometimes very touching.
I:15899;205;in my opinion, this movie speaks volumes of how alike we all really are.
I:15899;206;well written, directed, and acted, I thought it to be very entertaining, and give it 5 stars plus.
I:15899;207;A serious drama, very well done.
I:15899;208;And then, the connections, and the resolve.
I:15899;209;Alot of food for thought here.
I:15899;210;According to Alejandro Inarritu`s masterful creation, `Babel,` the answer is yes.
I:15899;211;few plots are as labyrinthine as `Babel`s,` and even fewer manage to remain as comprehensible and engaging as this one.
I:15899;212;An American shot in an Islamic backwater.
I:15899;213;mute daughter (Rinko Kikuchi in a truly heart.
I:15899;214;As the housekeeper returns from Mexico with her American charges, her nephew (the fiery Gael Garcia Bernal) engages in a verbal cat.
I:15899;215;Innaritu does offer hope that understanding is still possible.
I:15899;216;The children of this film carry its redemption.
I:15899;217;Throughout the film, they knowingly and unknowingly set right the confusions adults sow.
I:15899;218;The best we can hope for is support from those closest to us, namely our own flesh and blood.
I:15899;219;, don`t let that scare you away from a provocative, thoughtful and emotionally enriching experience.
I:15899;220;While the big names (Pitt and Blanchett) fill the film`s minor roles, it is the unknowns and child actors who deliver `Babel`s` masterful performances.
I:15899;221;`Babel` celebrates those outside the Hollywood pale.
I:15899;222;The beginning story line was very good.
I:15899;223;Loved the Brad Pitt part.
I:15899;224;Some of the individual stories were touching.
I:15899;225;I particularly liked the Moroccan boys story.
I:15899;226;the acting is above average.
I:15899;227;Not surprising as it has some good actors.
I:15899;228;I bought this movie because of a college design project.
I:15899;229;The project was to create a symbolic poster for the movie Babel.
I:15899;230;This movie is pretty intense, but is amazing when you pay attention to all of the detail put into it.
I:15899;231;So much of it is symbolic.
I:15899;232;It also really makes you think about our world and our place in it.
I:15899;233;There are some good performances in this, mostly of the child actors, and the dialogue sounds realistic which is a refreshing change for Hollywood.
I:15899;234;This was a good movie with an interesting story line.
I:15899;235;This is a perfect example of what happens when a decent idea is poorly developed.
I:15899;236;it being the plot, and characters worth caring about.
I:15899;237;The man behind the camera (Gonzalez) did two great movies before this one.
I:15899;238;"The other people at the crew give us another great work (i. e
I:15899;239;(The opposite is Little Miss Sunshine, a totally honest movie).
I:15899;240;at least I have to say the title of the movie it is just perfect, brilliant.
I:15899;241;"Anyone who has read ""The Emperor's New Clothes"" knows it takes a little courage to disclose what we actually see and hear."
I:15899;242;while the director is masterful at evoking tension, it tends to be unremitting, and the events depicted .
I:15899;243;She's been cast to play a corpse!Except for the thoughtful musical score, this film was physically revolting.
I:15899;244;I didnt realize it had subtitles the entire time.
I:15899;245;"Communication is vital to human survival
I:15899;246;And this is the premise for BABEL, a film winning (and probably destined to win) many movie awards.
I:15899;247;up for Best Picture, I was expecting a righteously perfect film.
I:15899;248;I did get a good film, an enjoyable one.
I:15899;249;stories are about people, and Babel has that and a bit more.
I:15899;250;Similar to CRASH in composition, Babel tells its story via a triad.
I:15899;251;Once in Mexico, everything goes fine.
I:15899;252;The wedding is beautiful and original in appearance.
I:15899;253;"Her father was also a great big game hunter and once gave a nice, new rifle to one of his guides as thanks for a successful hunt
I:15899;254;Babel was about alot of things, and it was certainly thought provoking on many levels.
I:15899;255;i agree with most of the previous reviewers who found beauty in the directing, acting, camera work, and audio.
I:15899;256;Particularly memorable were the scenes with the brilliant young actress playing the deaf/mute.
I:15899;257;i appreciate movies like this where the objective is to create art and tell a story as honestly as possible, where doing so the best way you know how, will inevitably preclude commercial success.
I:15899;258;Okay, everything's top notch (acting, production values etc).
I:15899;259;intense and interesting story line, although it seemed a bit lengthy.
I:15899;260;Babel, trying to imitate the wonderful style of Academy Award.
I:15899;261;winningCrash (Widescreen Edition), is a touching, thought provoking story of the world and its peoples.
I:15899;262;the movie itself has an amazing premise.
I:15899;263;From there, a Moroccan family's role in the crime is unraveled, and the story of a Japanese deaf.
I:15899;264;this movie is truly touching, as all of the subplots intertwine and a feeling of bittersweet catharsis is felt.
I:15899;265;There's a profound sense of dread throughout this that makes the viewer fear what is coming next.
I:15899;266;The message: a feel good theme about home and family.
I:15899;267;Others in the film make much more of a splash, such as the Latinos and the Japanese.
I:15899;268;'Babel' does explore a rather fascinating subject matter which in and of itself makes for an interesting watch.
I:15899;269;This imbalance damages the film, but it's still well worth the watch nevertheless.
I:15899;270;Babel is worth watching as the director does a great job of interweaving the three storylines.
I:15899;271;Always have a doctor onboard a tour bus.3.
I:15899;272;other than that, this movie makes perfect sense.
I:15899;273;Also, having lived in Tokyo for decades it captures Tokyo life quite well but in over 20 years of living there I've yet to find an apartment building with a 24.
I:15899;274;Babel was so complex yet mindbendingly deep.
I:15899;275;Thought it was incredibly well done throughout.
I:15899;276;I love all Brad Pitt movies, this one was decent, very sad but good.
I:15899;277;It is not my favorite of his flicks but him and Cate Blanchett have great chemistry together and I am excited to see the next picture they star in together.
I:15899;278;The scenery was good in this movie as well.
I:15899;279;I saw it in the theaters and it was decent on the big screen.
I:15899;280;It should have been a really good movie.
I:15899;281;Great cast, but something was lost along the way.
I:15899;282;This is a very good movie in some ways and not so good in others.
I:15899;283;The cinematography and acting are top notch.
I:15899;284;The scenery and acting really make you feel the emotion in the characters.
I:15899;285;That may, in fact, be a very realistic ending to the plot, but it did not provide any dramatic punch.
I:15899;286;to close, this is a good movie that is very well acted and filmed.
I:15899;287;"the links are pretty tenuous, and once they were revealed, I thought, ""So what?"""
I:15899;288;the entire movie was very well acted, and the healthy number of novices gave the picture an authentic feel.
I:15899;289;There is a lot of pain in this film, and the actors in Babel sold me every ounce with their performances.
I:15899;290;the landscapes were beautiful, too, and help to convey the desolation and helplessness that pervades the entire film.
I:15899;291;National Geographic might as well have provided the footage, it was so gorgeously shot.
I:15899;292;I don't know what film they saw, but please see Babel.
I:15899;293;His forte is as a character actor and he more than proves it in this ensemble production.
I:15899;294;He is terrific in Babel.
I:15899;295;I think Brad Pitt would be very successful with such a career move.
I:15899;296;What a powerful and moving film.
I:15899;297;Very few movies have captured human essence as this one did and fewer still in such a razor.
I:15899;298;A special thank you to all of the actors as each of them performed flawlessly.
I:15899;299;directing, production, lighting, scores .
I:15899;300;this one is worth (and will get) an award.
I:15899;301;I was in suspense the entire time.
I:15899;302;Well written, acted, and directed.
I:15899;303;Really gritty, lots of action.
I:15899;304;I saw BABEL last night and I was deeply moved to tears by the end of the movie.
I:15899;305;Everyone in the cast is fantastic, the acting is great as is the writing and directing.
I:15899;306;Gael Garcia Bernal as a small time punk with his share of an evil streak is very good although he's hardly in the movie is always good to watch.
I:15899;307;The kids nanny mexican actress Adriana Barraza and the Japanese girl (her name escapes me) are both fantastic in their roles.
I:15899;308;BABEL is a movie that one must see with an open mind, eyes and ears.
I:15899;309;It is a story about humans that experience highly complex situations in their lives and somehow it involves and touches more than one family.
I:15899;310;Highly recommended for those who appreciate movies that pick at their brains and forces them to take a deep, hard look at the world in which they live in and examine their lives.
I:15899;311;What a movie, what a movie!
I:15899;312;Brilliance, excellence, laughs and tears, suspans, great actors!
I:15899;313;One of my top ten favorites!
I:15899;314;Maybe it is the whole Brangelina thing, who knows.
I:15899;315;He is a second rate actor at best and I think that the likes of Adrien Brody would have done a much better job.
I:15899;316;if you like it great, give it a chance.
I:15899;317;It was not a fun movie but it certainly demonstrated how far reaching ones actions can be across the planet.
I:15899;318;that is how real they are!
I:15899;319;The story is equally compelling and thought provoking.
I:15899;320;The acting is very good.
I:15899;321;This is a good movie with comments to make on many levels.
I:15899;322;There is a certain poetic justice about the stupidity of a nanny putting herself in jeopardy, a pleasant, caring woman who has been breaking the law for 16 years.
I:15899;323;And, attached to the film's plot by a very slender thread, the Japanese girl has pain that can be felt by everyone watching her, including the audience.
I:15899;324;i wouldn't necessarily call this film enjoyable, but it is an enlightening and mesmerizing film.
I:15899;325;It also has probably the best role that Brad Pitt has ever had or played.
I:15899;326;BABEL is a great movie.
I:15899;327;Alejandro Gonz lez I rritu is a great director.
I:15899;328;Actually, they do a good job, acting.
I:15899;329;brad Pitt's character is a real jerk, and perhaps was meant as a metaphor for our foreign policy.
I:15899;330;Brad Pitt did a good job, acting.
I:15899;331;wise, but the writing didn't give him much to work with.
I:15899;332;Rinko Kikuchi was nominated for an Oscar for best supporting actress (along with Adriana Barraza), and she really deserved it.
I:15899;333;Tokyo looks like an amazing place.
I:15899;334;this film was really a good effort, with great cinematography, an Oscar winning score, and fabulous locations.
I:15899;335;And the scenes from Babel in Mexico were great, but if you want to see the vibrancy and energy of Mexico portrayed, I recommend Et Tu Mama, Tambien.
I:15899;336;It is good to see in this age of TRANSFORMERS and X. mEN and Bruce Willis action pieces that we can still have movies that are about ideas, not just escapism.
I:15899;337;the reviewer for Amazon, Sam Graham, is spot.
I:15899;338;It is gritty and real, and all of the characters are shown as having clay feet.
I:15899;339;At any moment, something can happen which can throw what we think are our self.
I:15899;340;absorbed and ordered existences into a tail spin .
I:15899;341;are still human and, more importantly, humane.
I:15899;342;"This humble native of Morocco is not like Pitt's fellow tourists who want to get on with their trip
I:15899;343;mute girl standing nude on the terrace with her father is perfect because it exemplifies the theme of the entire, skillfully woven tapestry.
I:15899;344;It was easier to accept a film full of pretty boys and the scene.
I:15899;345;I love the way this movie showed that one incident can connect and affect so many other people and most of the time we do not even know anything about the other connections and never will
I:15899;346;It is a good movie for people who loves to learn about other countries cultures.
I:15899;347;Wow, that's all I can say.
I:15899;348;I enjoyed this film for the most part, just not sure its Brad Pitt's best film performance as the cover states.
I:15899;349;Four stories interconnected very well.
I:15899;350;The cover of this film states Brad Pitt's Best.
I:15899;351;The Japanese story was the best and I would have preferred to see the director make a feature length film of this rather than try to interconnect the four separate plots.
I:15899;352;Futhermore, the stories are written with pretense and without humor, subtlety or even a sense of hope.
I:15899;353;"several years ago Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu directed an outstanding movie called ""Amores Perros"" about three sets of characters living in Mexico City."
I:15899;354;Amores Perros, full of both hope and tragedy, was a great film and heralded Gonzalez Inarritu as a major new figure in the emerging world of Mexican cinema.
I:15899;355;"At the time, ""Amores Perros"" seemd original and unique with it's use of interlinked stories."
I:15899;356;Truly great filmmakers are always striving for originality and new styles of expression.
I:15899;357;If it was to inform the audience, to show that miscommunication can lead to a series of ill.
I:15899;358;This film only manages to depress us by depicting people in unfortunate circumstances, and not in a way that's fascinating, enlightening, or even entertaining.
I:15899;359;Reconciliation is hinted at on their tour bus, when she reaches for his hand.
I:15899;360;Amelia had planned on returning home to Mexico for her son's wedding, but Richard tells her that she has to stay with his children a little longer.
I:15899;361;She meets with her nephew, Santiago (Gael Garcia Bernal), and they all cross the border.
I:15899;362;Initially, everything goes well: the kids have fun (mostly), the wedding was lively and eventful, and everyone came away happy.
I:15899;363;When the Boarder Patrol demands Santiago to pull over under suspicion of intoxication, he speeds away.
I:15899;364;She exposes her genitals to a group of teenage boys.
I:15899;365;Babel was awful, pure and simple.
I:15899;366;Once you get the character's lives straight and how they are all connected, the story is intriguing and has great emotional depth.
I:15899;367;Each culture is unique, yet the realistic portrait of human failures connects them as human.
I:15899;368;acted, compelling work which weaves together 4 disparate story.
I:15899;369;If you've seen 21 Grams, or Crash for that matter, and enjoyed them, you will enjoy this one.
I:15899;370;"crash"" and it works about as well as that one did within the confines of LA."
I:15899;371;In Morocco, the gun is sold to another family.
I:15899;372;In Japan, a young attractive policeman comes to talk to the Japanese businessman about the gun he gave away as it has now been used in an international incident.
I:15899;373;babel is an amazing movie.
I:15899;374;The acting is tremendous from everyone involved.
I:15899;375;It is a beautiful movie to look at and incredibly well written, edited and directed.
I:15899;376;This should have won the Best Picture Oscar.
I:15899;377;"this is basically a movie that kids will enjoy, akin to ""The Last Unicorn,"" ""The Last Starfighter,"" and perhaps ""The Last Tango in Paris,"" although I must admit I never saw the latter."
I:15899;378;"the moral of Babel is that if you are going to get shot by a stray bullet, try to do it in a more populated area, like Seattle, where the fabulously dreamy cast of ""Grey's Anatomy"" can fix you up like magic, make fun of your McSexuality, and then have affairs with each other."
I:15899;379;It was a very compelling drama and kept me glued to the screen for 2 1/2 hours.
I:15899;380;"Maybe more, maybe fewer
I:15899;381;Maybe it gets really good and maybe I'll come back to it.
I:15899;382;Babel is bound to be one of the most devisive films this year.
I:15899;383;Its a really made film with excellent performances from the actors involved in it and a complex storyline that didn't feel too melodramatic to hamper its impact.
I:15899;384;I will admit there are several times in this film that my attention was riveted by great filmmaking.
I:15899;385;Inarittu is an excellent director who gives even the smaller moments of the film power.
I:15899;386;He's helped by four excellent performances from Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchett, Adrianna Barza and Rinko Kikuchi who adds the most ammount of weight as the deaf girl.
I:15899;387;She's the powerhouse of the film who definitely deserves the acclaim and accolades she's reaping.
I:15899;388;But the film is worth seeing.
I:15899;389;"So we get Babel which many people love while others say it's ""overrated"" and never reaches the heights it thinks it's at."
I:15899;390;I wouldn't say it's the best film ever but it certainly was a worthy watch.
I:15899;391;out of all the storylines, the Japan segments are the least directly connected to the shooting but oddly, it's the most engaging.
I:15899;392;I sincerely hope Rinko Kikuchi wins the award because she's flat.
I:15899;393;The rest are equally great too, even the Moroccan kids.
I:15899;394;The main storyline, Richard and Susan, will depend on how much you can look past the faces of Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett.
I:15899;395;"Yeah they act well yet there's always that feeling of ""wow, one half of Brangelina can act""."
I:15899;396;should it win Best Picture?
I:15899;397;The best thing that can be said about this movie is: NOTHING!
I:15899;398;If you think of it (provided you have seen this movie), you will realize that the Japanese portion of the story is actually central to all the events, which originate in the Japanese executive.
I:15899;399;as for the actors, one of the best roles for Brad Pitt, which he performed perfectly.
I:15899;400;All of the actors did a superb job.
I:15899;401;I was excited to watch this, as I am a big fan of Cate Blanchett.
I:15899;402;Given those two big names, I figured it had to be good.
I:15899;403;(This had NOTHING to do with the actual story of how they accidentally shot the tourist!)
I:15899;404;With seemingly unrelated characters and storylines that gradually merge, it is as ambitious as a narrative can get, and the filmmakers pull it off with great aplomb.
I:15899;405;the final moments of the film are memorable as each storyline becomes clearer and potent in their revelations and truths.
I:15899;406;Time slips back and forth and certain events catch up to the others (Christopher Nolan's Momento comes to mind).
I:15899;407;What is so remarkable is how a seemingly innocent prank sets off a chain reaction of angst and responsibility.
I:15899;408;You experience life and its effects on other events and people.
I:15899;409;With a setting that reaches the far.
I:15899;410;This is a film that could easily play anywhere in the world and still be affecting.
I:15899;411;the international cast melds amateurs with seasoned veterans and the honest performances are completely captivating and affecting.
I:15899;412;This use of unknowns adds to the believability of the whole storyline.
I:15899;413;This film presents characters with all their strengths and weaknesses and it does so unsparingly.
I:15899;414;There are Richard and Susan who are at the center or eye of a growing hurricane of life's cruel randomness and must depend on strangers for survival.
I:15899;415;The imagery is powerful despite the handheld documentary feel.
I:15899;416;The scenes of Japanese nightlife are vivid and disturbing in their portrayal of urban youth.
I:15899;417;Babel is a film that this reviewer has no desire to sit through again, but having gone through it once, it is a unique, remarkable experience.
I:15899;418;On one hand it was an interesting look into humanity and how human character knows no borders.
I:15899;419;overall it was a decent movie, and it kept me thinking on several levels about the nature of human kind and how we tend to react and respond to things.
I:15899;420;I feel this film is a slick attempt to manipulate these concepts.
I:15899;421;when it was over,my son and I agreed it kind of reminded us ofThe Departed in one detail.
I:15899;422;Lots,and lots of scenes jumping back and forthand some scenes could have been cut and others more in depth added.
I:15899;423;the whole Japanese segment was good for one thing only.
I:15899;424;the best part of the whole movie ?
I:15899;425;that could have gone on for another hour and I would have loved it.
I:15899;426;soundtrack was very good !
I:15899;427;that would help out a great deal.
I:15899;428;And Brad?He is starting to look his age finally.
I:15899;429;I went and saw it with some friends of mine and then best part of the movie was when we got to leave.
I:15899;430;This is a good film, not a great film, or one you will remember forever.
I:15899;431;Brad Pitt's performance is one of his best.
I:15899;432;Still, better then most films out there today.
I:15899;433;This production is a work of art, a rainbow of cultures that crisscross languages including Morrocan, Japanese, English, Spanish, and Sign Language with one basic human trait, the need to love and be loved, which is the message of this film.
I:15899;434;"This is a movie that any human being alive can understand perfectly without understanding the language
I:15899;435;This film is a real mind opener about life on this planet and the things we often take for granted.
I:15899;436;Babel is a decent film but after viewing it I was surprised it received the critical acclaim it did.
I:15899;437;I am guessing the star.
I:15899;438;power presence of Cate Blanchett and Brad Pitt had a lot to do with that.
I:15899;439;The most interesting segments of the movie were those that concerned the gentle.
I:15899;440;hearted Mexican woman who traveled across an international boundary with the young American children she watched for a living, and also that with the deaf.
I:15899;441;I liked it so much that if there had been a sequel availablie I would have watched it the next night.
I:15899;442;It is also way too suspenseful.
I:15899;443;Brad Pitt's best performance since Fight Club.
I:15899;444;It all comes together in the end.
I:15899;445;With Babel director Alejando Gonzalez I rritu completes his trilogy begun with Amores Perros and 21 Grams, and demonstrates just how powerful movie.
I:15899;446;making can be in the hands of an artistic genius.
I:15899;447;babel (the title comes from Genesis 11 in the Bible) is a cinematic metaphor for our post.
I:15899;448;modern, global age, ambitious in scope and layered with multiple themes.
I:15899;449;sound track (including an unforgettable scene in a Tokyo disco when the pounding music goes silent in order to simulate Chieko's deafness), scenery, narrative, and cinematography.
I:15899;450;Give your heart and mind to this film and its characters, and you will leave the theater on mental, spiritual, and emotional overload.
I:15899;451;Three stories linked by common themes told by the Mexican director who's definitely a first.
I:15899;452;it looked like it was going to be a good movie.
I:15899;453;'Babel' is a great film because it uses a broad canvas to make a sweeping statement about the entirety of human experience.
I:15899;454;The filmmaker is saying that our all.
I:15899;455;real failures to communicate with one another .
I:15899;456;cultural cast itself represents a stunning achievement, one deserving of recognition.
I:15899;457;It is one of the most emotionally powerful films you will ever see.
I:15899;458;"With ""Babel"" and ""21 Grams"" he has delivered some of the more compelling cinema of the new Millenium."
I:15899;459;Both films are connected by a similar theme that despite the distances between people there are also things in this world that bind us together.
I:15899;460;"In ""21 Grams"" the device was the human heart."
I:15899;461;The International cast is uniformly excellent.
I:15899;462;A challenging film but one worth your while.
I:15899;463;this is a very good movie.
I:15899;464;it's a good Drama and brad pit plays an awesome role.
I:15899;465;the camera and its perspectives give the film a sense of universal truths.
I:15899;466;It is definitely a drama so very far from light hearted.
I:15899;467;It is an intoxicating and powerful tour de force that gets close and personal leaving you stunned by its universal and truthful wisdom.
I:15899;468;it's interesting to look up the meaning of 'Babel' and it where it has come from.
I:15899;469;This story couldn't reign any truer in our modern times and has spoke simple brilliance in the tone of a pebble dropped and rippled in a quiet pond.
I:15899;470;I think the messages conveyed are subtle yet powerful, heart.
I:15899;471;felt, universal and true in each stroke of its brilliant editing, writing, cinematography and soundtrack.
I:15899;472;I think it is a message of passion for understanding of other cultures or other circumstance.
I:15899;473;next in line, we have an American couple on a tour.
I:15899;474;girl and her father take on a very powerful depth of intoxicating layers.
I:15899;475;Perhaps the most powerful scene in the movie being her cling to strangers where she takes drugs and enters a rave.
I:15899;476;taker of their children since their birth.
I:15899;477;The wedding scene is heart.
I:15899;478;It is utterly fun and amusing.
I:15899;479;A true encounter of a mexican family in celebration of such a wonderful event.
I:15899;480;The dark recluse and cold of police officers and govt caring more about their job and policies then the compassion and real justice of human.
I:15899;481;this film is exceptionally binding and powerful, a modern tale ofBabel towers being built and then torn down.
I:15899;482;I want to enjoy a movie.
I:15899;483;My rating is 4.5 stars .
I:15899;484;Great Movie, I recommend it!
I:15899;485;Great movie, interesting storyline and great cast.
I:15899;486;Not sure I really understood what the significance of the deaf girl was since it had more to do with her dad,but the rest of it was very good.
I:15899;487;I would recommend this movie.
I:15899;488;I stopped it twice, then went back later.
I:15899;489;There are 3 movies in one in various locations around the world that have a connection.
I:15899;490;Proudly, latin, deserving oscar Winner, Santaolalla, creates the illusion of rich meaning for this children puzzle, where there is not.
I:15899;491;Assuming this audience believes he's a master that has said little, but hints to a well of wisdom, not said, but in front of you.
I:15899;492;just check the stretch of meaning he pulls to join the history of the rifle, which is really about the americans and the daughter of the japanese owner of the rifle that once traveled east (no explanation there) and gives the rifle as a gift .
I:15899;493;This movie is done quite well.
I:15899;494;The acting is excellent, and you really feel what the characters are facing with the huge challenges they are presented with.
I:15899;495;I particularly enjoyed the subplot of the nanny that goes to the wedding in Mexico.
I:15899;496;The camera shots make you feel like you are right there with them.
I:15899;497;The colors and lighting are beautiful and realistic.
I:15899;498;He did a good job, but not any better than the other lead actors in the other subplots of the movie did.
I:15899;499;They were all very good.
I:15899;500;There are some problems with this widely acclaimed film by Mexican director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, who previously gave us Amores perros (2000) and 21 Grams (2003), but they really don't matter because the film is so interesting and so very well acted and directed.
I:15899;501;The younger son shot at a tour bus in which the very well.
I:15899;502;"while most people admired this movie, and it received many awards and nominations for awards, some viewers did not like it
I:15899;503;Usually it is some kind of sexuality depicted that offends.
I:15899;504;She is offering her entire self to him and he does want her.
I:15899;505;Regardless of how one might feel about the ideas of Inarritu and Arriaga, they are very much worth viewing in an artistic, a psychological, and a political sense.
I:15899;506;With my glasses, I have 20/20 vision.
I:15899;507;For your clarification, I will include the ASIN # of the one I received from Amazon: B000MCH5TK.
I:15899;508;My goal here is to inform, contribute reviews, and save you guys time and $.
I:15899;509;And where is a decent ending.
I:15899;510;This film is basically 4 interconnected stories that are suppose to make us walk out of the theatre and think about our social values concerning immigration, sex and gun control, i doubt many people will walk out thinking about anything other than the fact they are glad the movie ended and that they can go and do something more fun with their time.
I:15899;511;the acting is fine but i cant see how 2 of the people in this film got nominated for best supporting actress unless this was a really weak year for that category.
I:15899;512;It's a cool concept I've seen done before, and it sort of reminded me of Traffic without the annoying filters and Catherine Zeta Jones play acting.
I:15899;513;ever see those films that make you really really hope everything turns out ok?
I:15899;514;Barraza, who plays the nanny, probably did the best acting in the film especially as she hobbled across the desert in her groom.
I:15899;515;This film is one of the most nominated with seven nods this year (I do NOT count Dreamgirls since the damn thing was nominated three times in the same category!)
I:15899;516;Should it be the Best Picture?
I:15899;517;The film editing was brilliant (I didn't see Blood Diamond yet, so no comparison comments here) and the Score was wonderful.
I:15899;518;Although the scenes when we hear (or don't hear) the film from Chieko's (Kikuchi) point of view are done very well!
I:15899;519;This movie is beautiful by connecting the storylines in a tactical manner, which keeps the audience entertained and hopeful!!!
I:15899;520;And the child actors were great!
I:15899;521;The reason I gave this film two stars is because of the effort needed on behalf of the viewer to enjoy this film.
I:15899;522;Tried to watch this movie the first time .
I:15899;523;Tried to watch it the second time .
I:15899;524;The acting was superb, and the locations and cultures were intriguing.
I:15899;525;It seemed so disparate at first, but as the film progressed, the pieces started coming together, wrapped up rather neatly at the end, and that's what made it very good.
I:15899;526;I don't think it was a great movie, hence the four stars, but it was definitely a good movie.
I:15899;527;This is an artistically and technically brilliant movie.
I:15899;528;But this is the point of the art form of tragedy: the insight that comes with emotional catharsis.
I:15899;529;Taking a trip to Morocco their life intersects with a family of a simple mountain shepherd trying to survive.
I:15899;530;A Japanese Widower and his teenage daughter try to come to grips with each other, the daughter's sexual maturity and the suicide of the mother.
I:15899;531;Amazingly enough it does but only if you too can persevere!
I:15899;532;And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them throughly.

I:15899;537;"i rritu's ""Babel"" is a powerful film."
I:15899;538;It is also, evidentely, a film about mankind being scattered on the surface of the earth (and as close as San Diego to Tijuana can be as far as Morocco from Tokyo), about borders and crossing them.
I:15899;539;His actors are so real .
I:15899;540;this is a real director, and this is real cinema, not entertainment.
I:15899;541;Brad Pitt is always great, must pay attention as it moves around.
I:15899;542;Overall very good and we enjoyed watching it.
I:15899;543;Interesting how a single rifle shot can start a staggering chain of events with international ramifications.
I:15899;544;Using the Tower of Babel as rich allegory, director Alejandro Gonzales Inarritu (try saying that three times in a row) tells a powerful story of confusion and cultural conflict in his compelling film BABEL.
I:15899;545;inarritu (with the astute help of writer Guillermo Arriago) weaves these stories together until the viewer understands the confusion, the miscommunication.
I:15899;546;And his cast is superb: Pitt and Blanchett are outstanding, while the young Kikuchi appears in one of the film's most eye.
I:15899;547;"BABEL is anything but a ""feel good"" movie, but for viewers looking for a complex story compelling them to think, this is it."
I:15899;548;The two young boys were excellent.

I:15899;551;And, at that time, man decided to build a great city and a great Tower that could reach on to Heaven, itself.
I:15899;552;babel is, in part, an exploration of how good a job God did.
I:15899;553;each of the four stories of Babel (a family of Moroccan goat.
I:15899;554;"that such communication and superficial differences might be our only *real* barriers is presented subtly, yet well, by providing us with scenes and themes in each locale which are universally human: the two Moroccan brothers tussling for dominance
I:15899;555;These people are all human, and their struggles and triumphs are familiar.
I:15899;556;In showing us these scenes, we learn to see past the subtitles and languages to the people behind them.
I:15899;557;this movie strikes one blow against God's project, in helping us to better understand each other, and in that (and several other aspects others will touch on, such as direction, acting, excitement, etc.), the movie is a great success.
I:15899;558;this is a movie that will keep you close to your seat till the end, as it is not a monotonous movie at all, it makes you feel good about yourself your life and how everything is connectedIts one of the best movies I have seen in the last 12 months.
I:15899;559;The youngest son is quite the marksman and without real intention hits Kate Blanchett's character in the shoulder area.
I:15899;560;Brad Pitt's character communicates, through raw emotion, his desire to save the life of his bleeding wife.
I:15899;561;In the biblical story of Babel, God gives man many languages, but takes away an easy way to communicate because of these multiple languages.

I:15899;565;there are quite a few excellent reviews, so I wanted to focus on the symbolism of the rifle.
I:15899;566;Oh Pulp Fiction was a gem when it came out in 1994.
I:15899;567;It seems like not all the components are present to make a good film.
I:15899;568;At the least, I think the title works quite well for the film.
I:15899;569;Another classic example of screenwriters/directors taking advantage of their creative liberties, waisting the our time, hoping at some point there is going to be a profound point to their message .
I:15899;570;a very well directed film with the best acting of Brad Pitt's career.

I:15899;575;There's a feeling of powerful emotion even in small scenes, such as Pitt starting to crumble as he makes a phone call.
I:15899;576;blanchett and Pitt are at the center of the movie (in that order), and both are excellent.
I:15899;577;Blanchett gives a stunning performance as the critically wounded wife, and Pitt acquits himself well as her anguished husband, as they rediscover their love under duress.
I:15899;578;Blanchett's performance should definitely garner her an Oscar next year .
I:15899;579;And Barraza gives a solid performance as the nanny, in a nightmarish situation that is particularly haunting because it really happens.
I:15899;580;admittedly, a good movie deserves a pretty good special edition, but this two.
I:15899;581;"The primary extra on this is a long ""making of"" featurette."
I:15899;582;It's nice, but a bit more would have been expected.
I:15899;583;"it may comment on the lack of communication between cultures and people, but ""Babel"" is so compelling in its acting and visuals that it could easily have been a silent film."
I:15899;584;provoking movie, and one that deserves to be seen.
I:15899;585;The way the three stories come together is handled in such a way that it holds your attention throughout the movie.
I:15899;586;My wife and I really enjoyed it
I:15899;587;It is all about grandiose intentions, gorgeous cinematography and soundtrack, a mediocre mega.
I:15899;588;The only truly interesting, authentic, and emotionally involving characters were the Moroccans, in particular the Berber goatherding family whose two young sons initiate the whole movie's plot development through a series of stupid actions that have totally unforseen consequences.
I:15899;589;"it's still not as tedious as ""Crash"" though, thanks to the cinematography and score."
I:15899;590;"There are clear flashes of Inarritu's considerable directorial talents here and there
I:15899;591;"From my perspective, Paul Haggis' ""Crash"" is a prime example of this hit."
I:15899;592;It's simply startling how they are able to avert the potential contrivance of the running theme through the creative dexterity of the storytelling.
I:15899;593;It also helps that the acting is so uniformly strong in light of the various languages spoken and the cultural and socioeconomic differences presented.
I:15899;594;None get a huge amount of screen time, but they make lasting impressions.
I:15899;595;nightmare dimensions of their story feel so authentically heartbreaking.
I:15899;596;Nevertheless, the most surprisingly powerful work comes from Rinko Kikuchi as Chieko.
I:15899;597;Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is superb considering the variety of locales he had to shoot and still stay in tune with a uniform visual look, and Gustavo Santaolalla contributes another exceptional music score.

I:15899;599;class work full of cathartic moments and complex emotions.
I:15899;600;This was a really great movie.
I:15899;601;People make this movie sound horrible but it was really really good.
I:15899;602;The movie felt like crash but an international version of it.
I:15899;603;I highly recommend you watch
I:15899;604;36 years ago I saw a movie so bad that I've waited all this time for something to top it.
I:15899;605;Each story takes place in a separate part of the world.
I:15899;606;hearted romp or an adventure movie.
I:15899;607;I like this type of storytelling because it's more real to me.
I:15899;608;It's the way human character is revealed naturally through conversation and events.
I:15899;609;I had listened, and loved the soundtrack by the way, but I didn't completely understand the movie.
I:15899;610;It's the kind of movie that gives you a tiny glimpse into someone else's life, a sort of superficial understanding.
I:15899;611;The interconnectedness of the all the lives of over a dozen prime characters and superb acting.
I:15899;612;A Japanese widower gives a Moroccan game hunting guide as gratitude for a great hunt.
I:15899;613;this simple common exchange of basic human goodness and compassion sets the stage for this powerfully driven film that interweaves Brad Pitt and his wife (Cate Blanchette), their 2 children and their full time Mexican nanny.
I:15899;614;This film fabulous in its intellectual breath and the depth of its characters whom are all played out by the best actors in each ethnic group.
I:15899;615;This film is great for anyone who enjoys the deeply moving messages revealed in common human interaction and the ripple of them through so many lives.
I:15899;616;The film makes deep statements about the fragility of life and the need for love to survive.
I:15899;617;Well worth the time for the intense and moving ending.
I:15899;618;The plot is mildly interesting.
I:15899;619;The farmer gives the rifle to his two sons that take care of the goats.
I:15899;620;One of the boys shoots at a tourist bus and actually shoots a lady that is riding in the bus.
I:15899;621;Since the nanny can't find someone to take care of the children, she brings them along to the wedding.
I:15899;622;The story then jumps to Japan and introduces a Japanese teenager that is deaf.
I:15899;623;the movie was pretty good.
I:15899;624;I usually do not watch movies like these but I enjoyed this one.
I:15899;625;I also felt like the music was well done.
I:15899;626;There were moments that captured my heart and I recommend this movie for everyone that likes to watch movies that are in the drama genre.
I:15899;627;Fabulous, crazy, a feast for the eyes.
I:15899;628;I liked the story in the middle east, I enjoyed the story in Mexico, But the Japanese part was pointless.
I:15899;629;If you like movies like 21 Grams, and Crash you'll enjoy this film.
I:15899;630;i liked it a lot.
I:15899;631;i loved to see Paris again and places around the world.
I:15899;632;This movie is SO over.
I:15899;633;the cast was absolutely phenomenol.
I:15899;634;class talent, each person is able to show their abilities.
I:15899;635;Adriana Bazzara shines as Amelia the maid.
I:15899;636;She was the most sympathetic out of all the characters, and her portrayal of an insanity set in by not being able to make it back to the life she left behind in America is absolutely incredible.
I:15899;637;i will give a lot of notification to writer Guillermo Arriaga and Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu for their bold and straightforward displays of the story that Babel puts forth.
I:15899;638;Though I can see a lot that could've been left out of the graphicness in the story of the deaf and blind Chieko, such as the full frontal nudity (which could've been done just as well with just implied nudity), the rest of her story, and the others are perfect in their complications.
I:15899;639;Babel touched home with me on that aspect.
I:15899;640;I'm sure with a lot of people Babel touched home, but I hope it picks up at the box office soon.
I:15899;641;on the $25,000,000 budget, which the producers spent thoughtfully and and worthfully, the fruits of their passion on a six month shoot has brought us this amazing work of art to the world which should be noted to all kinds as a message that needs to be heard.
I:15899;642;If you are a person who takes the time to experience reality daily as I did, you will feel for these people.
I:15899;643;Go in with a skeptical mind and come out feeling refreshed and waiting for life to meet you.
I:15899;644;I guarantee you that you will get something back.
I:15899;645;Good performances by the actors tho.
I:15899;646;And, 'full frontal' from that Japanese chick!
I:15899;647;Superbly acted, beautifully executed stinker of a film.
I:15899;648;It's got some really good messages.
I:15899;649;cate Blanchett was supremely magnificent as Susan Jones.
I:15899;650;Brad Pitt gives the best (and most emotional) performance of his career.
I:15899;651;again, the individual stories were very good.
I:15899;652;A more intelligent film than your average box office draw and more demanding of its audience.
I:15899;653;personal stay we make in each of those places, is rare in Hollywood movies.
I:15899;654;What's engrossing about this film is that the characters who engage in such folly are so lovingly drawn and portrayed, reminding us that perfectly well.
I:15899;655;"Gael Garcia Bernal and Adriana Barraza are terrific
I:15899;656;Such a well done film.
I:15899;657;i was on the edge of my seat the whole movie.
I:15899;658;obvious gun violence and immigration messages, but a very realistic portrayal.
I:15899;659;"This should have won the ""Best Movie"" Oscar 2006, rather than ""The Departed""."
I:15899;660;The actors are so good, so natural, that they don't seem like they're acting.
I:15899;661;There is constant suspense, but it is the suspense of real life.
I:15899;662;In many ways, the film is so realistic it feels like a documentary.
I:15899;663;It is a profound look into the drama of real life , in which people with the best of intentions get entagled in nasty events, and may even die because of that.
I:15899;664;"It reminds one of ""Crash"", which also told parallel stories, but ""Babel"" feels so real that ""Crash"" looks like a teen movie by comparison."
I:15899;665;"a great movie I saw just before this one was ""The Lives of Others"" which has a really good non predictable ending that leaves you really feeling satisfied."
I:15899;666;"i would highly recommend ""The Lives of Others"" over ""Babel"""
I:15899;667;A couple in L. a. go on a trip to Morocco leaving their two young kids in the care of a Mexican nanny.
I:15899;668;"She flashes ""The Hairy Monster"" at various men in hopes they will be moved to have sex with her."
I:15899;669;the movie was interesting and well acted and there is suspense in waiting for the disaster that you know will happen to happen.
I:15899;670;this film was created as a piece of art: the director had something he wanted to say, so he made a film to say it.
I:15899;671;I am glad that this movie held my attention long enough for me to figure out that this is really a great movie.
I:15899;672;The beautiful cinematography of three countries and the tremendous talent of a stellar cast turn out a fine drama of cause.
I:15899;673;Babel takes over two hours to finally reveal the connection between the characters and it got a bit wearing.
I:15899;674;Was not sure the second time that I had seen this movie a couple of years ago but I enjoyed it more the second time.
I:15899;675;narrative style and told three intertwined stories abut lives, loves, passions, and losses of people whom we come to know through their relationship with dogs and that were connected by one fateful incident in the streets of Mexico City was a remarkable compassionate movie, a very successful debut that left me waiting for the next I rritu's film.
I:15899;676;It is IMO, the best I rritu's film, with three finest performances from most gripping actors working now, with three stories that take their heroes to such emotional, mental, and physical depths of despair, revenge, and promise of redemption that it is difficult to think of another such powerful film.
I:15899;677;For instance, the story of Amelia, a kind and nice Mexican nanny who had to take two American children in Mexico with her to attend her son's wedding.
I:15899;678;"Even with some good performances, moody cinematography, and impressive Oscar winning musical score, it fells victim to its creator's ""global"" ambitions."
I:15899;679;Perhaps good acting, but did not enjoy this lengthy movie even with Brad Pitt, a traditional favorite actor to watch
I:15899;680;with multiple stories taking place in Morocco, Japan, Mexico and the U. s. a. the film travels in several interesting but unexpected forms.
I:15899;681;All ending in a tragic story for some of the family involved to the story,.
I:15899;682;It wasn't hard to determine where this movie was going (6 degrees of separation) but after watching the moving I concluded the best part of the journey was the anticipation of what might happen to the characters.
I:15899;683;There was something about this movie which grabs the viewer's attention right from the beginning.
I:15899;684;There are four intertwined stories.
I:15899;685;An American couple is visiting Morocco and their children are in the care of a Mexican nanny in the U. s.
I:15899;686;the acting by everyone is great.
I:15899;687;A lot of the movie is in Arabic, Japanese and in Spanish.
I:15899;688;It is interesting when they turn of the volume sometimes during her scenes to show us how she sees the world.
I:15899;689;The movie has great acting, and a great storyline.
I:15899;690;The scenery in Mexico, Morocco and Japan is nice and it really gives you a feel for those countries.
I:15899;691;But maybe there was no message, maybe the director simply wanted to make a good movie.
I:15899;692;The resultant collapse of the Arab family as a unit was touching.
I:15899;693;I really enjoyed this movie and the suspense.
I:15899;694;The acting was done very well (a lot of the foreigners were recruited into the movie a few days before filming).
I:15899;695;this is a deep story about how miscommunication and misunderstanding can create profound impact that is undesired.
I:15899;696;Brad Pitt's best film performance?
I:15899;697;good acting job by Pitt.
I:15899;698;Great acting all around, even from the Morrocan extras who weren't professional actors.
I:15899;699;She got an oscar nomination for this?
I:15899;700;She's showing her hooch and boobs, give her an oscar nomination.
I:15899;701;Why not?Cate and Brad did great as usual, and Cate did an exceptionally good job being the annoying wife.
I:15899;702;At best a well filmed moving canvas.
I:15899;703;Babel hooked me right from the begining.
I:15899;704;The scenes in morroco were very realistic.
I:15899;705;The director Alejandro Inarritu is vey skilled at drawing you into other cultures.
I:15899;706;The film deserved all the oscar nods it received.
I:15899;707;"This is his best performance since ""Fight Club""( a much unappreciated film)."
I:15899;708;The main actor in the movie is a high powered rifle.
I:15899;709;Very educating how this gun influences and changes all these people's lives, their families, their employers, and their marriages.
I:15899;710;A very simple thing, a grateful client thanks his guide by giving him a rifle he admired.
I:15899;711;Best Brad Pitt movie, fantastic tear jerking plot.
I:15899;712;The actors were wonderful great job by all.
I:15899;713;The two men, writer/director and writer, seem to maintain an almost theatrical company around them: many of the same actors appear, the same crews, etc and the result is ensemble filmmaking whose final impact rests solely on the message of the film itself.
I:15899;714;Though this is one of the finest casts assembled yet this year, it would be difficult to select one or two as Oscar contenders, but it is certain the film and its director will gather awards wherever they are wisely and thoughtfully given.
I:15899;715;the story seems complex, spread as it is from Morocco, San Diego, Tokyo, and Mexico, but the unifying element is so simple that it makes the audience shudder.
I:15899;716;the cinematographer is Rodrigo Prieto, the incredibly important film editors are Douglas Crise and Stephen Mirrione, and the astonishing music score is the product of the gifted Gustavo Santaolalla.
I:15899;717;stomach ache that this superb film produces.
I:15899;718;This is a tough movie to watch, but one we should all see and see again.
I:15899;719;It is as fine as any film to be released this year.
I:15899;720;If you're into the emotions you experience watching footage of suicide bombers blowing up people, you will enjoy this movie.
I:15899;721;At least you'll feel good when you leave.
I:15899;722;Because it's more dramatic that way.
I:15899;723;what makes 'Babel' better than 'Crash' is that it actually has a pretty solid first hour before the story gets overtaken by melodrama and self.
I:15899;724;But even the great performances, such as Adriana Barraza's, get bogged down by the disparate vignette format that the film takes on.
I:15899;725;cate Blanchett one that takes center stage .
I:15899;726;nominated actress gives as a deaf.
I:15899;727;"So is the nanny ""connection""."
I:15899;728;The most probable scenario:Director: I've finished it!
I:15899;729;Critics like something that seems profound.
I:15899;730;"Now all we need is a ""deep"" title, you know ."
I:15899;731;director: Yes, an alien nation.
I:15899;732;"This movie is a feast for all the senses and another masterpiece from Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, whose debut film ""Amores Perros"" established him and his writing partner, Guillermo Arriaga, as talents that simply would be ignored."
I:15899;733;"while ""Amores"" had a similar narrative style, it was much more consistently visceral and in your face than ""Babel,"" which is also a tough film but one which demands a slower pace and shows a story."
I:15899;734;teller and a director at the peak of their respective talents.
I:15899;735;This sequence is as alive as anything that you will ever see in a single frame in any movie made to date.
I:15899;736;pressed to find an ensemble in any movie in any year that is as strong as this one.
I:15899;737;I am glad that she received a nomination as it will hopefully lead to more work by this talented actress.
I:15899;738;line:If you don't mind long movies and want to be moved by stories the are universal and timely, you'll be hard.
I:15899;739;That synopsis is right on the money.
I:15899;740;"I for one loved it and think that it's too easy to call it this year's ""Crash,"" which in my opinion was not as ""good"" as ""Brokeback Mountain"" but was not the piece of junk that some have wanted to reduce it to."
I:15899;741;It is supposed to be Brad Pitt's best performance.
I:15899;742;He has done better in almost any of the film he was involved.
I:15899;743;"If you watch it and you think, ""I get it,"" you probably do, and if you still think it sucks, that's fine, but at least, when you derrive upon an issue that you think you understand, doubt yourself and try to get a little more out of it than you are used to."
I:15899;744;Babel manifests a solid storyline without much rabbling.
I:15899;745;I must give credit to whoever did the direction and screenplay.
I:15899;746;"Though ""Departed"" is the best film I've seen this year and that film deserves an Oscar, Babel deserves more respect in my consciense."
I:15899;747;It makes you feel like you're watching not just an American film but a discipline based on a world.
I:15899;748;When Yussef cries out to the police, I. babel is unique.
I:15899;749;I saw this film with two other people: one liked it very much, one sort of liked it, and I didn't like it at all.
I:15899;750;So if nothing else, it's a good movie for discussion.
I:15899;751;And while it may be the most moving part of the film, the Mexico segment is completely extraneous.
I:15899;752;This movie wasn't what I expected it to be like BUT it was very good.
I:15899;753;Brad Pitt was in it so that is always a great thing to me in any movie.
I:15899;754;I don't know if you need to own a copy but it is worth it to watch.
I:15899;755;Let me start by saying that I really like this movie a lot.
I:15899;756;cate Blanchett is a phenomenal actress, and does an outstanding job here, as the wife of Brad Pitt who gets shot in Morocco while riding on a bus.
I:15899;757;She is shot by two young boys, playing with a gun, and terroristic sirens sound off throughout the world.
I:15899;758;There are some other events happening in the movie too, with their children, and the original owner of the gun who is in China.
I:15899;759;Somehow they are all intertwined which makes for a compelling story.
I:15899;760;Very well done, except one major complaint.
I:15899;761;there are some very sexually explicit scenes involving children that were pretty much unessecary in making this a great movie.
I:15899;762;But, otherwise, the storyline is great, and very interesting.
I:15899;763;I like movies that have a lot of moving parts, and stories happening in many places.
I:15899;764;I would recommend this movie to anyone.
I:15899;765;I was able to attend a pre.
I:15899;766;screening and it is one of the best films this year.
I:15899;767;the movie has great acting, and most of the actors in the movie are new.
I:15899;768;the movie conveys many levels of human reflection and existence.
I:15899;769;It examines the behaviour of humand and cross cultural interaction and separation.
I:15899;770;this movie is entertaining from beginning to end you will be intrigued with the story.
I:15899;771;the desert to my mind, is the key to find important references in this sense.
I:15899;772;Eighth: the desert of the affective silence who is beautifully depicted in the last shot of the film.
I:15899;773;a true thousand carats film, that should be win the Academy Award the next 25.
I:15899;774;But regardless, it will remain as one of the most ambitious films ever made that has achieved an important place in the Cinema from its instantaneous release.
I:15899;775;But the camera works and editing worked great for its purpose.
I:15899;776;It is, quite simply, a film about miscommunication at all levels and the ways in which we can, and do, become isolated from each other.
I:15899;777;i found it incredibly moving and sad.
I:15899;778;It's like finding something that you can do little about other than to be aware that it's there.
I:15899;779;The message, I think, is that we should each try to make an extra special effort with each other.
I:15899;780;I recommend this to everyone .
I:15899;781;it tells much about the human condition.
I:15899;782;Instead of shock and awe, I was shocked and sickened.
I:15899;783;"It's not even a very good story: ""How a rifle affected lives in 4 countries""."
I:15899;784;I'd return the movie if I could.
I:15899;785;Brad Pitt is very good, but this is DEFINITELY not his best acting role as the promo states.
I:15899;786;other then that interesting movie.
I:15899;787;The deaf Japanese girl story was the most interesting.
I:15899;788;Sympathetic characters including Brad Pitt as a most tender and disillusioned husband.
I:15899;789;The Mexican wedding and the heart.
I:15899;790;The association of this act to incestuous voyeurism and sexual onanism shows that it is the context we create that makes kids become what we call terrorists, though they are only kids space.
I:15899;791;It was sort of fascinating.
I:15899;792;It does take some concentration.
I:15899;793;I don't think it is worthy of a five star, but it is ahead of average, so I've given it four stars.
I:15899;794;all one sees from kate (great actor) well, not much.
I:15899;795;Production, Directing and Acting keeps the viewer riveted to the screen.
I:15899;796;It's movies like Babel that makes being an Amazon Prime Customer well worth the investment.
I:15899;797;we start with a Moroccan family, two young brothers who love each other, despite their constant and common sibling bickering.
I:15899;798;The younger son is a natural shot, as is proven early on during their target practice.
I:15899;799;Trying to both prove to each other their manliness, and the power of the rifle, the two brothers stand on top of a mountain hilltop, and take a potshot at a bus, rather nonchalantly.
I:15899;800;Meanwhile, their two surviving children are staying with their live.
I:15899;801;in nanny, a second mother really, who desires to go to their son's wedding in Mexico.
I:15899;802;A fourth story comes in with a deaf.
I:15899;803;Alejandro Gonz lez I rritu's deft handling of what could be a confusing conundrum of a plot makes the film both entertaining, heartbreaking, and suspenseful.
I:15899;804;A proven master of such story telling (yes, he made the brilliant Amores Perros!)
I:15899;805;Nope, the two standout performances were THANKFULLY acknowledge by AMPAS.
I:15899;806;First, Rinko Kikuchi's stunning performance as Cheiko, the deaf mute Japanese girl, is breathless, stunning, amazing.
I:15899;807;Whenever she appeared on the screen, her sadness and confusion was so real.
I:15899;808;She nearly steals this movie.
I:15899;809;One the other hand, at the end of the movie my husband and I found ourselves saying 'really, that was it?'
I:15899;810;If you have seen everything else and just want something to watch, this movie is worth watching.
I:15899;811;This movie has amazing performances, an intricate story line and most human events.
I:15899;812;It was realistic of what could happen when you decide to visit a country and need medical care.
I:15899;813;I felt all actors did a fine job in their roles.
I:15899;814;He gives the rifle to his guide as a gift.
I:15899;815;A good hour could have been cut from the run.
I:15899;816;It is amazing what these guys can get money to makie.
I:15899;817;Phenomenal movie, in story, acting, and production.
I:15899;818;Easily in my top 3 of last year.
I:15899;819;It's nice to see Innaritu return to the excellence that he had in Amores Perros.
I:15899;820;This film is rated R. I enjoyed the film.
I:15899;821;It was very thought provoking.
I:15899;822;aside the controversial footage, the film delivers intense suspense and challenges the viewer to think about how hard some decisions can be under the most difficult of circumstances.
I:15899;823;If you are cerebral you will enjoy the film for its ability to deliver an ethically challenging script.
I:15899;824;This is a film that will challenge your senses.
I:15899;825;he is a very capable director.
I:15899;826;One star alone for the cast, yet acting is nothing memorable either.
I:15899;827;babel is a stunning cinematic masterpiece.
I:15899;828;It came out quite clearly that language is culture, and culture is language.
I:15899;829;i loved this movie because 1/3 of it was filmed in Morocco, and even takes place there, at a place I've been to, the area around Erfoud and Ait Benhaddou.
I:15899;830;Something important to understand the subtext of the movie is how rare this is and how illegal it is to even own a gun.
I:15899;831;the theme of cultural difference comes through the clearest perhaps in Morocco.
I:15899;832;Throughout we are treated to the importance of privilege, simply because of birth.
I:15899;833;The country you're born into determines who you steal from.
I:15899;834;I actually watch plenty of movies and enjoy pretty much all genres.
I:15899;835;This movie is a classic example of an overhyped movie with a good cast that was exremely overrated.
I:15899;836;It is difficult to make one good film, but director I rritu manages to make three good short movies.
I:15899;837;Instead, I was treated with an interesting and emotionally satisfying production that succeeds in making a point that the world is a very small place.
I:15899;838;Blanchett has less of a role to play as the wounded wife, but she effortlessly conveys the layers of her relationship with her husband behind the pain and anguish of her suffering.
I:15899;839;name actors here, and they are not particularly stunning, but their story is touching.
I:15899;840;Another storyline, possibly the least memorable of the four, involves the children of Pitt and Blanchett and their Mexican nanny who takes them across the border.
I:15899;841;The lengths to which she goes to fulfill her desires are pitiful and moving, and her character is the most nuanced in the movie.
I:15899;842;this film does show a global class system where Americans are treated with more respect than those from third world countries.
I:15899;843;The film wants us to sympathize with the underdogs.
I:15899;844;The adaptation of each segment of this film has a respective regional style.
I:15899;845;The plots twist and curl around each other to form an amazing vine, a vine with an important message.
I:15899;846;this is a well acted, well written movie that was in a much higher league than Little Miss Sunshine, a film I liked, but was a pretty good little movie.
I:15899;847;Departed, nice movie, Leo was great.
I:15899;848;Again, I liked it, but it wasn't great.
I:15899;849;The three stories intertwine and come together at the end.
I:15899;850;i loved this movie, and I thought I would hate it!
I:15899;851;See Crash it does this concept a whole lot better.
I:15899;852;I enjoy the three stories in one flim.
I:15899;853;All three were damn good.
I:15899;854;The circular aspect of the Morrocan/Mexican/American story is unexpected and beautifully done.
I:15899;855;The fact that the characters survive their ordeals is surprising given the severity of what happens to them in the course of the story.
I:15899;856;[Not recommended for a first date!]
I:15899;857;I loved the mixed sequencing of the events and the flashbacks.
I:15899;858;I also loved how they linked all they linked all family events and stories to the one major incidence.
I:15899;859;This is an excellent movie, Brad Pitt as usual was outstanding.
I:15899;860;Amazon's Prime movies are very good.
I:15899;861;perhaps they're just into it more, their passion, their beards and long sleeve T. shirts flapping in the wind.
I:15899;862;Then I would have loved this movie, now, well.1.
I:15899;863;The children don't object and of course have the time of their lives as all Mexicans are just great people.
I:15899;864;And of course multiple stories with threads attaching 'em .
I:15899;865;The movie moved along without developing any solid plot that captivated the audience.
I:15899;866;and if this so. called Movie wins ANY award.
I:15899;867;In giving my best effort to take every bit of good out of this movie, i'll offer the following: Excellent cinematography, great acting, and interesting plot.
I:15899;868;minute effort to fit all three stories together.
I:15899;869;to address previous comments regarding the inappropriate scenes regarding the underaged actors, it was done for shock value and that's all.
I:15899;870;The fact that it succeeded these films put it at a great dissadvantage with extremely high standards.
I:15899;871;If you want to watch a movie that integrates several stories and ties them together in a well.
I:15899;872;balanced, intruiging, intricate fashion, then watch Traffic or Crash.
I:15899;873;This Academy award nominated film is certainly one of the most serious films of 2006.
I:15899;874;Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett head the credits, but surprisingly share the real leads with Adriana Barranza, who plays a loving Mexican housekeeper, and the extraordinary Rinko Kikuchi, a deaf Japanese teenager struggling with the demons of disability, adolescence, and the death of her mother.
I:15899;875;I thought the most compelling themes of the film were about responsibility, fault and guilt.
I:15899;876;His prominence on the cover of People magazine every week masks what a fine actor he really is.
I:15899;877;"provoking ""Babel,"" he really has an extraordinary range."
I:15899;878;I've become a big fan.
I:15899;879;Not worth the time it took to watch it.
I:15899;880;Awesome movie second time I've seen it.
I:15899;881;Better the second time around guess cause I was able to enjoy a little bit more didn't have to study it so hard second time around to understand it.
I:15899;882;Barely entertaining, moderately dramatic, requires full attention throughout.
I:15899;883;Left too many loose ends and moved very slowly.
I:15899;884;"I am a purveyor of all nominated, acclaimed , movies, etc. babel, as is the style and ""fad"" today with modern directors, has many storylines going on simultaneously, of which we are waiting to see just what their connection actually is: well, forget about it in this film!"
I:15899;885;What an incredible narrative about the barriers we hide behind when confronted in less.
I:15899;886;Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu is a wonderfully talented filmmaker.
I:15899;887;I watched this movie with much anticipation.
I:15899;888;I wasn't quite sure when I started to watch the movie whether I would like it, but it turned out to be riveting drama.
I:15899;889;I DID NOT WANT A SNUFF FILM!
I:15899;890;If the point was life sucks then that was accomplished.
I:15899;891;A Mexican nanny, in charge of watching two American children, takes them across the border so that she can attend her son's wedding.
I:15899;892;His illustration certainly made sense to me.
I:15899;893;That, perhaps, is even more surprising.
I:15899;894;The manner in which every teenager responds is unique.
I:15899;895;And it passes the test: it's a believable reaction.
I:15899;896;the film speaks to us of the domino effect, how one small, seemingly innocent gesture can cause tremors that are felt around the world, and demonstrates that such things can come full circle.
I:15899;897;a solid cast of characters put in good performances.
I:15899;898;"this is better than most of the ""sophisticated"" multi."
I:15899;899;destined, and that constitutes a sore point for me.
I:15899;900;if you like this kind of writing, this is a good example.
I:15899;901;strong performances all roud, but so help me, id have preferred to see just one of these plot lines more fully developed.
I:15899;902;a special kudo to gustavo santolaella for his perfect musical score.
I:15899;903;overrated, but still worth seeing.
I:15899;904;"Alejandro Gonzalez Inarittu, the director of ""Babel"", has stitched together several fine stories into one film."
I:15899;905;With not one mediocre performance in this lengthy cast, Inarritu manages to take four separate cultures.
I:15899;906;american, Mexican, Japanese and Moroccan to remind us not only of our shrinking world's great connections with each other but that we are all, in a sense, the same under the skin.
I:15899;907;"expansive and colorful, ""Babel"" is often breathless."
I:15899;908;Brad Pitt, sharing the bill with so many other fine actors is convincing as an often tormented American husband trying to save the life of his wounded wife.
I:15899;909;All of this works together with such clarity and force that to see it just once would hardly give it justice.
I:15899;910;His scope is broad, the timing is well.
I:15899;911;"paced and everything about ""Babel"" rings true."
I:15899;912;It is a masterful movie and one I highly recommend.
I:15899;913;Babel is easily the best fim released in 2006.
I:15899;914;It combines scenery, drama, chance, tragedy and in any case the best soundtrack produced in many years.
I:15899;915;If you do get the message however it is brilliant.
I:15899;916;Solid performances across the board and of course great story weaving by Alejandro Gonz lez I rritu.
I:15899;917;"Each is superbly acted
I:15899;918;It's not an easy film to watch, but it is among the best of the year.
I:15899;919;It was interesting to picture the time when all the events occurred at the end of the movie.
I:15899;920;Babel is a film that involved 4 interwoven stories that have effects on each life involved.
I:15899;921;And this leads to some intense scenes, some heartbreaking revelations, and soul.
I:15899;922;Her story is completely disassociated from the rest of the film, but in the context of viewing the film as a anthology of personal problems and discoveries, then I think it works well.
I:15899;923;Babel was nominated for several Academy Awards including Best Picture and had previously won the Best Picture Golden Globe.
I:15899;924;I'm usually pretty good at predicting the Best Picture winner at the Oscars, but this year was difficult.
I:15899;925;up between The Departed, Little Miss Sunshine, and Babel.
I:15899;926;Well, The Departed won 4 Oscars and Babel won one (Best Original Score).
I:15899;927;"never the less, ""Babel"" is one of the best films of 2006."
I:15899;928;"I thought ""21 Grams"" was the fourth best film of the year, the year it came out."
I:15899;929;Babel is just as good, if not better.
I:15899;930;Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett play Richard and Susan, a rich couple touring Morocco.
I:15899;931;This movie presented a truly surprising year at the Academy Awards.
I:15899;932;Watching the film, it's easy to see why.
I:15899;933;"Barraza is probably the actress that most deserved the Oscar this year (although I haven't seen ""Dreamgirls"" so my opinion is a bit unfounded)."
I:15899;934;Kikuechi doesn't say a word in the film and yet delivers one of the best performances of the year.
I:15899;935;Brad Pitt delivers his best performance ever and I'm surprised after watching it he didn't get an Oscar nomination.
I:15899;936;Babel was an Oscar front.
I:15899;937;It ended up on a lot of top ten lists, but a lot of critics (namely A. o. Scott and Michael Phillips) shut the film out.
I:15899;938;It is a film that won't appeal to the average American audience, because Americans don't like to read movies but this is a great film that I think some people would benefit from seeing.
I:15899;939;winning score is terrific and, even, at times, haunting.
I:15899;940;Babel is a unique piece that explores the differences between various cultures and ethnicities.
I:15899;941;It aims to expand people's world views all while entertaining and captivating the audience.
I:15899;942;It's filled with some great acting.
I:15899;943;The actors and actresses are superb, and they display such visceral emotions.
I:15899;944;Babel is a little more serious and intense (intellectually), but it seems to strike the same chord.
I:15899;945;Amazon offers a great variety of movies!
I:15899;946;I would totally recommend this to everyone who wants to great movies.
I:15899;947;"It took me a while to place them but Rinko Kikuchi was also in ""69"" and Koji Yakusho, who played the father, has actually been in a number of famous Japanese movies, including the main part in ""The Choice of Hercules"" and the American movie ""Memoirs of a Geisha""."
I:15899;948;Worked to hard to make the individual's stories tie together.
I:15899;949;This movie is film making at it's finest.
I:15899;950;It's amazing how they were able to intertwine all of these stories beautifully.
I:15899;951;Some of the most emotional, deep, purpose driven acting from every character.
I:15899;952;The cinematography and film score was also fantastic.
I:15899;953;This film is a masterpiece!!
I:15899;954;Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett were amazing actors in this powerful and deep movie.
I:15899;955;It reminded me of the movie Crash and was a great experience.
I:15899;956;Nice to watch when you just want to hang at home with a adult friend with a good glass of wine and not think about anything else.
I:15899;957;MOVIE: Alejandro Gonz lez I rritu has established himself as a raw and powerful filmmaker.
I:15899;958;Inarritu's friend and screenwriter, Guillermo Arriaga, has also established himself as a great writer.
I:15899;959;Arriaga is a great storyteller who does his best work when he writes in a non.
I:15899;960;The two match up perfectly and deliver us a raw, powerful, and emotional experience with Babel.
I:15899;961;a Japanese hunter travels to Morocco and gives his rifle to his hunting guide as a present and a token of thanks.
I:15899;962;An American couple on vacation (played by Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett) are now in peril after the wife is shot during the incident.
I:15899;963;The Japanese storyline has the least to do with the central storyline, but is important nonetheless.
I:15899;964;We will see a section of one storyline and then jump back a bit to see the other one.
I:15899;965;This film is incredibly easy to follow, and thankfully that allows the emotional impact to be so much greater.
I:15899;966;They know that film is a visual medium and that's how they tell the story.
I:15899;967;"The film is shot in the documentary ""shakey"" camera style, shot mostly or even all on digital from what I could tell."
I:15899;968;Anyway, the style works to captivate the audience completely.
I:15899;969;Some moments are so full of emotion that it will bring you to cry and tremble.
I:15899;970;The film is also enhanced greatly by Gustavo Santaolalla's subtle and powerful score.
I:15899;971;However, I absolutely loved this score, it was truly phenomenal.
I:15899;972;Usually scores in films like these are not thematic, but this score was incredibly thematic and does wonders to enhance the visuals.
I:15899;973;In a powerful scene we see the Japanese girl walk into a pulse pounding night club where the music is blasting and people are dancing.
I:15899;974;The main storyline back in Morocco is also harrowing.
I:15899;975;There are some points in the film where you will be truly shaken to your core.
I:15899;976;Brad Pitt was stunning in the film, and Cate Blanchett was amazing as well.
I:15899;977;Adriana Barraza plays the Mexican housekeeper and I think she gives the best performance in the entire film.
I:15899;978;For those who think the little girl who plays the daughter of Brad Pitt's and Cate Blanchett's characters looks familiar, she should look familiar.
I:15899;979;This young actress also gives a stunning and magnificent performance that should be recognized at the Oscars.
I:15899;980;This is what a great film is.
I:15899;981;This film needs to be experienced, so do yourself a favor and see it.
I:15899;982;Hands down, this is Pitt's best work, not only because he veers away from his handsome image, actually looking aged and allowing his performance to ADD to the movie, rather than showcase his looks.
I:15899;983;As a result, he delivers a standout performance .
I:15899;984;and the rest of the cast is equally strong.
I:15899;985;the film does jump back and forth in time but this all makes sense and I think it is an effective approach.
I:15899;986;I guarantee you'll be surprised at some point because the director doesn't follow stereotypes.
I:15899;987;but if you're ready to tackle a film that will have you thinking about our place in the world, how people can resolve conflict and understand one another better and (perhaps) reach a point of greater understanding and develop new ways of relating and handling terrible situations, this is a great film for fueling THOSE thoughts.
I:15899;988;I am a huge Brad Pitt fan, and will certainly watch most things he has stared in and we all know Cate Blanchett is one of the best actresses of our time.
I:15899;989;This movie was powerful, in that it focused on how human kind can be all connected and how our actions can inadvertently effect another without knowing it.
I:15899;990;I think it is worth the watch.
I:15899;991;how seemingly unconnected events can bring people from all walks of life and cultures togeather is perfectly staged in this intriguing show.
I:15899;992;I had high hopes for this movie before seeing it.
I:15899;993;This movie was good at building to the climax.
I:15899;994;It revolves around four storylines in three countries: Mexico, Morocco, and Japan.
I:15899;995;All these stories connect to one main thread.
I:15899;996;How they all connect is what makes it interesting.
I:15899;997;Rinko Kikuchi's storyline is the most heartbreaking of the four.
I:15899;998;It's the most difficult role to play, and it's conclusion is very bittersweet.
I:15899;999;the fact that the most emotional storyline is easy expendable shows that this movie could have used more heart.
I:15899;1000;The caretakers trip through the dessert is emotionally involving, yet one wonders whether or not the movie could have survived without it.
I:15899;1001;It's an interesting question to be sure, and one wonders whether or not the film maker would have been better off making a film trilogy instead of forcing three movies into one.
I:15899;1002;It's a good movie, but I can certainly live if I never see it again.
I:15899;1003;Very enjoyable movie with some great character development within all the intertwined stories.
I:15899;1004;Babel is the latest narratively and chronologically twisted epic from director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu.
I:15899;1005;"It brought him wide acclaim for his breakthrough ""Amores Perros"" a funny and thrilling ride for man and dog!"
I:15899;1006;But now he takes his skill and technical prowess to his biggest canvas yet.
I:15899;1007;Babel is set in Morocco, Mexico, Japan and the United States.
I:15899;1008;One bullet brings all the stories together.
I:15899;1009;this is an ambitious picture, and I do believe the narrative framing and structure enhance the overall experience.
I:15899;1010;this is an awesome achievement.
I:15899;1011;From editing, score, screenplay, cinematography and art direction.
I:15899;1012;Babel is propelled to the short list of great studio films this year.
I:15899;1013;The acting is uniformly excellent.
I:15899;1014;but the payoff is worth it.
I:15899;1015;It is harrowing and unpleasant at times, but riveting and emotional throughout.
I:15899;1016;Babel is clearly a film made with serious intentions.
I:15899;1017;"There are certainly individual moments within ""Babel"" that will strike a chord, and it's definitely an intelligently made film, I just don't necessarily think that it is as ""significant"" as some make it out to be."
I:15899;1018;"Ultimately, though, I must embrace ""Babel"" as great adult filmmaking and powerful drama."
I:15899;1019;About 4 1/2 stars from me, I'm rounding up for the sheer scope and ambition present.
I:15899;1020;This movie was great it brought such a barrage of various emotions to me.
I:15899;1021;I loved the combination of story lines and their minute connections to one another.
I:15899;1022;Highly recommended and highly entertaining.
I:15899;1023;This film explores them all.
I:15899;1024;Although this movie is hard to watch there is a feeling that for all of our horribleness we can be quite remarkable in our human range of emotions.
I:15899;1025;There is no happy ending here,no win + win situation, just a feeling that life is hard but, we move on and live the best way we can.
I:15899;1026;Overall I thought this film was very beautiful and raw, an interconnected puzzle of human lives and decisions.
I:15899;1027;Perhaps a call to treat our selves a bit more gentle.
I:15899;1028;Everyone will pick up something for himself or herself from this movie!
I:15899;1029;The story line was good Andy the acting excellent.
I:15899;1030;"seat intense
I:15899;1031;All of the actors are excellent as is the location photography.
I:15899;1032;There's an odd theme occuring in films of late.
I:15899;1033;Babel is one such film.
I:15899;1034;The hunter uses the rifle on a trip, then gives it to a Morrocian who was his guide.
I:15899;1035;The younger of the two is the better shot.
I:15899;1036;He proves it by making a tourist bus his target for practice.
I:15899;1037;She's placed under arrest simply because she's an alien who has been working in America for 16 years.
I:15899;1038;She put the kids in danger, and then got caught herself.
I:15899;1039;Everything is miles away from everything else.
I:15899;1040;But also because of all the subtitles I had to read.
I:15899;1041;each of the stories involved in Babel are fascinating, if not emotionally draining.
I:15899;1042;Each of the stories would have made an excellent film on their own.
I:15899;1043;my feeling is this: Crash, best picture winner of 2005 did the coincidence story better.
I:15899;1044;"I really liked this movie
I:15899;1045;I truly enjoyed *Babel* as it was similar to *Crash* and *Traffic*.
I:15899;1046;While on a tour bus, Susan is suddenly shot and is bleeding.
I:15899;1047;Richard and Susan have issues to address in order to save their marriage.
I:15899;1048;the movie was just wonderful.
I:15899;1049;Like *Crash* and *Traffic*, I liked this movie because it sparks dialogue with friends and loved ones after viewing.
I:15899;1050;If it sells for .25 cents, I will be satisfied.
I:15899;1051;I have traveled the world and visited and fought in Third.
I:15899;1052;Started off really good and had really great potential and then the ending SUCKED!!
I:15899;1053;"While much of ""Babel"" made me squirm uncomfortably, it had a powerful cumulative impact."
I:15899;1054;Nominated for the Best Picture Oscar and winning Best Picture awards from the American Film Institute and the Golden Globes, it is a film with credentials.
I:15899;1055;The last shot as the camera draws away from the top floor Tokyo skyscraper was breathtaking to me.
I:15899;1056;Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu won the Best Director award @ Cannes and was nominated for the Oscar.
I:15899;1057;"His film ""Amores Perros,"" loosely translated as ""Love's A B*tch,"" previously won the best foreign language award in Britain."
I:15899;1058;The emotional territory he traverses in the film is impressive, particularly the phone conversation he has with his son as he tries to pretend that everything's okay while worried that his wife will die on the surgical table.
I:15899;1059;It's one of his best performances.
I:15899;1060;"Playing his wife Susan is Australian actress Cate Blanchett who won her Best Supporting Actress Oscar in 2004 for ""The Aviator"" and was nominated again this year for ""Notes on A Scandal."""
I:15899;1061;She does a good job as the wounded wife in a foreign land who through this crisis overcomes her grief for her lost child and rediscovers her love for her husband.
I:15899;1062;"Movies about husbands and wives who fall in love with each other always play well with me
I:15899;1063;"Rinko Kikuchi who played in the Japanese film ""Ikitai,"" translated as ""Will to Live,"" is stunning as the deaf mute adolescent whose grief for her mother's suicide leads her to act out improperly."
I:15899;1064;I'm not sure of the name of the Japanese policeman who comes to her apartment to interview her, but it is an excellent, tender scene.
I:15899;1065;As Chieko, Kikuchi was also nominated for the Oscar from this film.
I:15899;1066;Gael Garcia Bernal as Santiago gives a good performance as he goes crazy while questioned by a border patrol.
I:15899;1067;The international scope of the picture is breathtaking as we travel from a Middle Eastern country to Southern California and Mexico to Japan.
I:15899;1068;While my squirm factor was raised high with some of the blood and gore as well as the adolescent nudity, I came away appreciating this film as one that calls for greater understanding among people.
I:15899;1069;That universal theme plays well in these troubled times.
I:15899;1070;In a related, but separate story, the American couple (portrayed with great sincerity and passion by Pitt and Blanchett) struggle in a life.
I:15899;1071;"There's obviously some masterful storytelling and moving performances in ""Babel,"" but overall, it's not extremely enjoyable to watch."
I:15899;1072;And I'm convinced that this film is a very special kind of art form.
I:15899;1073;It's just like the real world .
I:15899;1074;Yes, Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchard did bring the star power to this film, and they were indeed excellent as the American tourist couple who are stranded in a small Moroccan village after a stray bullet hits their tour bus and the wife is seriously wounded.
I:15899;1075;There are other police actions that made me shudder as well, as mistakes add up and a car driven by the Mexican woman's nephew is detained by the U. s. Boarder Patrol.
I:15899;1076;All this seems complex, but that is the point of the film.
I:15899;1077;Life is complex and disturbing and an action by one person can impact many others on the other side of the world.
I:15899;1078;i highly recommend this film, but it's certainly not light entertainment.
I:15899;1079;The drama begins, the part I loved the best was at the end.
I:15899;1080;He was a kind soul.
I:15899;1081;I cried and was very touched.
I:15899;1082;they missed what makes a really good movie.
I:15899;1083;I'm still trying to figure out how the Mexican nanny fits in and she was the most sympathetic character.
I:15899;1084;"Leave this one alone and watch ""Happy Feet"" ."
I:15899;1085;fast moving penguins make more sense with their flippers than this movie does!
I:15899;1086;the mood was very tense, which did keep my attention.
I:15899;1087;I don't usually write reviews but the fact that this film continues to get one star reviews absolutely baffles me, this film provides the audience with such strong connections with each protagonist in each story of the film that it seems people found it hard to deal with.
I:15899;1088;A film about the true nature of humankind and the factors that bind us across cultures, for those of you that enjoy a deep drama with an amazing soundtrack and amazing acting.
I:15899;1089;Wow great film and I liked how they all tie up together.
I:15899;1090;Whoever came up with this idea was great.
I:15899;1091;This is an excellent movie.
I:15899;1092;Very touching and learned a lot about traveling to third world country.
I:15899;1093;I found it provocative and sobering.
I:15899;1094;Brad Pitt did give a good performance.
I:15899;1095;The suspense builds in Morocco and you think you will get to see what happens next and then .
I:15899;1096;eventually as the plots thicken again and again you are surprised by each turn.
I:15899;1097;It's debatable, however, if this movie is his best film performance.
I:15899;1098;If you enjoy suspense, you will like this movie.
I:15899;1099;Loved the Arab police's reaction to the child's admission.
I:15899;1100;"I've read other reviews about how some people say it's about ""human psychology and behavior"", and we all can relate to this movie."
I:15899;1101;Unlike so many modern movies, Babel is a story with real depth.
I:15899;1102;The violence in the movie is necessary to the story rather than an added special effect.
I:15899;1103;the situations of these individuals are very moving.
I:15899;1104;Would highly recommend this movie for adults who are tired of car chases, explosions, machine gun fights and loud noises substituting for an actual plot.
I:15899;1105;This is trilogy of stories that slowly evolve into a common theme and connections.
I:15899;1106;Susan has been irritable and upset most of the trip.
I:15899;1107;Finally they find a small town nearby, but still need competent medical care.
I:15899;1108;Amelia is upset as she was planning on attending her son's wedding in Mexico.
I:15899;1109;She makes a decision to go anyway and take Richard and Susan's children with her.
I:15899;1110;She says she has to return with the children .
I:15899;1111;then the film zips to Tokyo and a rich widower (Koji Yakusho) who is tied to the rifle that shot Susan.
I:15899;1112;She is upset when boys back away from her when they realize she cannot hear.
I:15899;1113;She wants to be loved and have a life of fun and boyfriends like other young girls.
I:15899;1114;She is bold, promiscuous, determined and angry.
I:15899;1115;this is a very intimate peek into each life.
I:15899;1116;It is deeply, darkly emotional and yet very thoughtful on the love of families as well as cultural misunderstandings.
I:15899;1117;bing brings you health info from trusted sources.
I:15899;1118;It was an interesting movie to say the least.
I:15899;1119;I forgot I had seen this before in the movie theater but it was nice to be able to watch it from the comfort on your own home.
I:15899;1120;i was at the edge of my pool watching in on my iPad and enjoying the cool water on a very hot day in Arizona.
I:15899;1121;I would recommend this movie but it is something that you really need to keep your full attention on it.
I:15899;1122;Don't you love movies where you can't figure out where it's going to go, but it keeps you on the edge of the seat?
I:15899;1123;Babel hits you like that and blows your mind away.
I:15899;1124;I loved how the story was written and really felt the pain that Brad Pitt's character was going through.
I:15899;1125;Cate Blanchett played his wife and she delivered a wonderful performance as well.
I:15899;1126;Like I said, check it out!
I:15899;1127;shots and then the full frontal nudity shocked me.
I:15899;1128;Every action and every word held my fascinated attention.
I:15899;1129;High drama in its very best sense!Drama, I say again.
I:15899;1130;The plot veers off into interesting directions and unexpected twists.
I:15899;1131;It's a definite keeper and one I'll enjoy watching again and again.
I:15899;1132;I will have to watch it again.
I:15899;1133;This riveting movie tells the story of several families who are linked through a set of challenging circumstances.
I:15899;1134;The characters are multidimensional and interesting, more like real people than typical movie characters.
I:15899;1135;An excellent movie dealing with globalization, elaborating on the effect of one incident innocently performed by a person, and how such incident would effect so many around the world.
I:15899;1136;All actors have performed perfectly in a well directed movie that is freshly objective.
I:15899;1137;A Shepard in Morocco barters for a rifle and gives it to his two boys to guard the sheep.
I:15899;1138;Blanchett gives a stunning performance as the critically wounded wife, and Pitt is her anguished husband, as they rediscover their love under duress.
I:15899;1139;That language is still a barrier and our frame of reference is formed by our cultures where we are raised.
I:15899;1140;Let me count the storylines.
I:15899;1141;Brad and Cate's children and their Nanny : Back in the US, their children's nanny comes up with this amazing idea to take the kids across the border for her daughters' wedding (which is probably the most boring Hispanic wedding I've ever seen .
I:15899;1142;they are far more vibrant than this one, in real life).
I:15899;1143;The Moroccan Kids : Two Moroccan kids get a hold of a rifle and they're the ones that shot Cate from a distance.
I:15899;1144;All these stories converge into one point at the end.
I:15899;1145;I have had it with films that set you up for a payoff and then suddenly the end credits roll.
I:15899;1146;And that is so evident.
I:15899;1147;There are so many great movies about cultural integration around us .
I:15899;1148;it's a fine movie and well played.
I:15899;1149;it's also about the very wide spectrum of human experience, and the similarities of each to the other.
I:15899;1150;"pitt holds his own
I:15899;1151;Brad Pitt is the best .
I:15899;1152;he brings reality to each piece of work he does and this is another great example!
I:15899;1153;This film will make you think about how anything you do, could affect people you don't know, and the consequences that follow.
I:15899;1154;ins were a bit out there to hold the movie together, yet this was a good movie.
I:15899;1155;Amelia will therefore have to cancel going to her son's wedding that day in Mexico to look after the kids.
I:15899;1156;But this is an even more accomplished round.
I:15899;1157;He also clearly believes that kindness and faith are not merely rationed to the West.
I:15899;1158;"but what gives ""Babel"" its extraordinary humanity and personal punch are the faces you don't recognize and the worlds you're allowed to peer in on ."
I:15899;1159;but full of family and heart nonetheless.
I:15899;1160;There is an old lady who stays with Cate Blanchett's Susan as she writhes in pain .
I:15899;1161;happy police as the 'American Killed By Terrorists' storyline filling the news gets out of hand.
I:15899;1162;"filled gritty realism of ""21 Grams"" on the new format ."
I:15899;1163;"it's fabulous to see that ""Babel"" is a proper looker on BLU RAY and a quantum leap ahead in terms of visuals."
I:15899;1164;it fills the full screen and the effect is powerful.
I:15899;1165;it was hailed in certain circles as 'a genuine masterpiece'.
I:15899;1166;I'm new to the director's work BUT I have to say he did good at his job.
I:15899;1167;Not even entertaining, though very well acted.
I:15899;1168;i likes the five intertwining stories and also really felt the pain of each families scenario.
I:15899;1169;I enjoyed this dark film.
I:15899;1170;The concept for this film was a good one.
I:15899;1171;It was a challenge to see how all the stories were going to tie together, but the writers did a good job of folding it all together.
I:15899;1172;Overall, a fantastic movie about humanity in its many shades and tongues as well as the common struggles across cultural lines.
I:15899;1173;As for those other parts, its your typical interconnected stories sort of come together to create an overall feel type movie, the type of film Robert Altman made so well, and the type of film that has been way overdone in the past few years.
I:15899;1174;A superb and gripping drama for intellectually minded individuals only.
I:15899;1175;I did give this 4 stars due to the good acting but I would not recommend it to anyone.
I:15899;1176;This was a great contrast between the first and third worlds.
I:15899;1177;Brad Pitt did a phenomenal job acting.
I:15899;1178;the first time I have seen him in an outstanding serious role.
I:15899;1179;it is then with a single gun fire that all these people connect with one another and how it all acumilates in an ending that will be happy for some, tragic for others.
I:15899;1180;the true driving force of the film is the performences.
I:15899;1181;Pitt brings his best performence since 12 Monkeys and it surprises me that he didn't get nominated.
I:15899;1182;Barraza is supremly moving as the loving nanny but i feel the standout of the film is Rinko Kikuchi's fierce turn as the deaf teen Chieko.
I:15899;1183;everytime she is on screen, she blares like a silent siren with such raw force and power that her performence joins the likes of other great none speakign roles like Marlee Matlin and Holly Hunter.
I:15899;1184;the music also brings some depth to the film, Santaoalalla really blends in the music to make it all seem more real.
I:15899;1185;a truley epic film, Babel is definently one of 2006 most outstanding films.
I:15899;1186;The movie revolves around four stories, all but one with an immediate link to each other, and the same heavy.
I:15899;1187;telling that last year's Academy Award winner gave us.
I:15899;1188;Brad Pitt's performance was great but this movie is getting more credit than it deserves.
I:15899;1189;Simple themes told exceedingly well here.
I:15899;1190;They live in a glacial glass high.
I:15899;1191;the two other parts of the film deal with the stars (a very good Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett) in Morocco on vacation (!?)
I:15899;1192;and a supposed terrorist attack and the third, a very real and scary sequence involving the Pitt/Blanchett children and their caretaker, Amelia (a terrific Adriana Barraza) and their harrowing journey into Baja California.
I:15899;1193;"wrenching, emotional and transcendentally beautiful scene: the dog fight in ""Amores Perros,"" the Naomi Watts scene with Sean Penn in which she explains how it is to lose a family in a random accident in ""21 Grams"" and here in Babel: Chieko at a Shinto dance club, the soundtrack stopping and starting to approximate Chieko's experience, Chieko: wide."
I:15899;1194;experiencing a world in which feeling and touching is paramount and hearing isn't.
I:15899;1195;"With nobody else to care for the kids and not wanting to miss the wedding, she takes the kids with her and her ""shady"" nephew to Mexico for the wedding."
I:15899;1196;the director jumps back and forth from story to story, always at key parts that leave you eager to find out what was going to happen next.
I:15899;1197;It is a very successful formula here and one can understand all the positive critical reviews that this movie has received.
I:15899;1198;I felt it actually better than Crash which was last year's best picture.
I:15899;1199;It is excellent nonetheless and should not be missed!
I:15899;1200;If you can take its pace, this movie is worth it.
I:15899;1201;The story arcs are great, the characters are built well, and the direction is almost flawless.
I:15899;1202;Acting and suspense were very well done.
I:15899;1203;will keep you engaged and interested during the entire movie.
I:15899;1204;That said, BABEL is an entertaining if starkly realistic and gritty film with fine acting turns by all involved.
I:15899;1205;Rinko Kikuchi is excellent as the Japanese girl and stole the film in my opinion.
I:15899;1206;CRASH did a better job with that approach to story telling.
I:15899;1207;But BABEL is worth seeing and listening to.
I:15899;1208;She brings the children across the border into Mexico to attend her son's wedding, and problems arise when they attempt to re.
I:15899;1209;"like ""21 Grams"" before it, in ""Babel"" director Alejandro Gonz lez I rritu masterfully entwines multiple stories into a compelling film."
I:15899;1210;Packed with solid performances all around.
I:15899;1211;This is not a fun movie, but it is thought provoking and solid.
I:15899;1212;I highly recommend this film.
I:15899;1213;I love several of the actors, but I felt that the movie itself could have been more detailed.
I:15899;1214;It was a little long and some scenes didn't need to be so long (ie someone walking down the street) but overall was worth watching.
I:15899;1215;Plan for the 2 1/2 hrs and you'll enjoy it.
I:15899;1216;The film is long, but good.
I:15899;1217;This movie is definitely a memorable one, although it does not deal with happy scenarios.
I:15899;1218;Tragedy strikes in one family, and we get to see how that carries over into the lives of 2 other families.
I:15899;1219;Brad Pitt does an amazing acting job, as does the young man who plays the youngest brother in Morocco.
I:15899;1220;This is the best I have seen in many many years!
I:15899;1221;If you find the present state of humankind increasingly worrying then you'll unquestionably enjoy and relate to this movie.
I:15899;1222;The actors were brilliant, starting with the children (both Moroccan and American children) and the Moroccan interpreter (he was so natural and convincing) through to Brad Pit.
I:15899;1223;The movie diligently succeeded in conveying a strong cultural flavour of the above three corners of the story.
I:15899;1224;This is done is so cleverly a number of times in the movie which manipulates viewers' emotions in a way that further serves the overall message.
I:15899;1225;all in all, Babel is an excellent movie with a timely message!
I:15899;1226;This is an exception, since it is an intricate mixture of stories.
I:15899;1227;Babel is an important film.
I:15899;1228;I liked it the first time I saw it at a theatre, but the second time really grabbed me.
I:15899;1229;I would absolutely recommend this for anyone who has never seen it, especially if you enjoyed Traffic and/or Crash.
I:15899;1230;Especially nice work from Hispanic woman, Japanese girl, Middle east family.
I:15899;1231;There is the old saying that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.
I:15899;1232;He sends his two boys to tend the flock.
I:15899;1233;He gives the rifle to the oldest son.
I:15899;1234;The younger boy takes the rifle and shoots at a passing bus.
I:15899;1235;The local government reacting to the finding the shooter and the treating of the wounded woman.
I:15899;1236;The first part is more interesting than the second.
I:15899;1237;If developed further, this would have made a fine film on it's own.
I:15899;1238;This story is connected to the main story by the children belonging to the woman who was shot.
I:15899;1239;the film takes place over five days and this also created a credibility issue with the first two stories.
I:15899;1240;This is an excellent film made and directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu.
I:15899;1241;other reviewers have done an excellent job of describing the story, so I won't repeat that here.
I:15899;1242;"This disparity of the view of human value and worth is definitely a consequence of the ""Babel"" story in Genesis 11.2) The snow."
I:15899;1243;Each of these decisions have very dramatic and significant consequences, as you'll see.
I:15899;1244;Genuine love and understanding care speaks a common language that is understood beyond all cultures and ethnicities.
I:15899;1245;b) The caring understanding of one of the Japanese detectives makes a very big difference upon the Japanese girl ChiekoThe love and care of these individuals are the bright spots in this movie, which otherwise is filled with sadness and tragedy.
I:15899;1246;i give a big thumbs up to the great acting in this movie: Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchett, Adriana Barraza, and Rinko Kikuchi all give outstanding performances.
I:15899;1247;Writer/director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu has made a very substantial drama with biting social commentary.
I:15899;1248;Otherwise, I enjoyed this movie a lot.
I:15899;1249;Babel, at it's heart, is the story about a japanese girl that just really, really needs to get laid.
I:15899;1250;This is a visceral movie.
I:15899;1251;This is a fine display of acting, but that's simply all there is.
I:15899;1252;overall, Bable is a good film.
I:15899;1253;The dirctor's point was an excellent one.
I:15899;1254;Of course, I love the movie!
I:15899;1255;If you are REALLY interested in the desert area of Portugal, this is the film for you.
I:15899;1256;Love how the three stories are connected into one.
I:15899;1257;one of Brad Pitt's great performance.
I:15899;1258;That's the advantage of making a movie with this kind of tone to it: at worst, the reception by the public will be maybe just slightly above average, and at best, be received exactly how this movie was: as a great movie.
I:15899;1259;when they cut between the 4 separate story lines going on, taken by themselves they are pretty good scenes that are well acted and leads to those characters' individual story arcs.
I:15899;1260;There was 0 drama, 0 tension, and the number one important thing, 0 empathy for ANY of the characters, and without that, why even watch it?
I:15899;1261;The deaf Japanese student should have won the Oscar.
I:15899;1262;I really enjoyed this movie.
I:15899;1263;It is an original work of art and makes some great social observations.
I:15899;1264;She should have got top billing.
I:15899;1265;Wow, so many people, so many lives across the world linked to one random incident.
I:15899;1266;I thoroughly enjoyed watching it on Blu.
I:15899;1267;"ray but will be ""almost"" equally good on other formats."
I:15899;1268;As each person has an opinion, felt that there was a lot of subliminal political themes of one form or another.
I:15899;1269;Good actors and a very good story wrapped in wonderful cinematography make this movie a must see .
I:15899;1270;the parts were very well played though.
I:15899;1271;i hope, the other actors did get as much money for the movie as these two did, for they for sure deserved it more.You can follow the story well, that's one good thing, I guess and I love the part that plays in Marocco.
I:15899;1272;These guys make astounding films.
I:15899;1273;It is amazing how everything links and is not forced at all.
I:15899;1274;Hopefully they resolve their differences because they mae such incredible films.
I:15899;1275;It shows that great films can be made in Hollywood.
I:15899;1276;"I love movies like ""Babel""."
I:15899;1277;I love movies that make me think, that objectively portray the world we live in, both its good and bad sides.
I:15899;1278;Babel is a movie that features four parallel stories .
I:15899;1279;defining moment, a bombastic, yet silent portrayal of humanity that these people are desperately trying to embrace.
I:15899;1280;And art it is, as it perfectly blends fantastic and diverse soundtracks, acting.
I:15899;1281;Babel is undoubtedly a movie to add to your collection.
I:15899;1282;And it is this cultural divide that the director so eloquently brings out in the story.
I:15899;1283;the acting by Brad Pitt is great .
I:15899;1284;a great movie for the thoughtful mind.
I:15899;1285;I found the the story that revolved around Morocco and Mexico very interesting, but they could have excluded the whole Japanese story completely as far as I'm concerned.
I:15899;1286;Just when things got interesting in Morocco it cut to Japan and I kept thinking come on get on with it.
I:15899;1287;I give it two stars because two out of the three stories were interesting.
I:15899;1288;It reminded me of Thin Red Line, a bit too bold for its own good and yet parts did manage to impress me.
I:15899;1289;A great movie brilliantly directed and written.
I:15899;1290;One of the great modern movies to be released in the last few years.
I:15899;1291;Babel moved 4 generations of our family equally.
I:15899;1292;This is a love story.
I:15899;1293;Utterly believable, utterly gripping, fascinating and inspiring.
I:15899;1294;This is one of the four best movies I've ever seen.
I:15899;1295;The Bottom Line:I still don't think that the Japanese plotline fits in with the rest of the film, but Babel is a consistently.
I:15899;1296;I thoroughly enjoyed it, but it may be a good idea to watch it twice.
I:15899;1297;Best thing about it was the Moroccan dessert scenery.
I:15899;1298;Lots of goats and goat women.
I:15899;1299;It was great for a Sunday nap.
I:15899;1300;Difficult and complex plot line but the acting is amazing.
I:15899;1301;that horrendous events anywhere have the effect of stripping back the layers of falseness and irrelevance we build into our lives, leaving us with what is true and real.
I:15899;1302;national backgrounds and thought the acting and direction were superb.
I:15899;1303;I dont necessarily think that this is Brad Pitts best work.
I:15899;1304;It is a pretty good movie.
I:15899;1305;Babel is one of the best movies I've ever seen.
I:15899;1306;Beautifully written, filmed, characters portrayed by fine acting, beautiful message.
I:15899;1307;Way, way up there in my forever Top 10 best films.
I:15899;1308;Suspenseful intertwined and sometimes heartbreaking storylines, with great acting all around.
I:15899;1309;A compelling, important film you have to judge for yourself.
I:15899;1310;who cares the film tells us.
I:15899;1311;Its other subtext is that as human beings we all share the same human concerns .
I:15899;1312;love, loss, importances of family.
I:15899;1313;the performances are all excellent including Brad Pitt as a troubled husband.
I:15899;1314;the last half hour of the film is excruciating as some plot threads come together but the film resolves in a satisfying conclusion.
I:15899;1315;Babel is a thoughtful commentary on an increasingly troubled world.
I:15899;1316;But that also means you need to pay attention
I:15899;1317;star cast and a renowned director don't equal a good movie.
I:15899;1318;I must admit, the best parts of this movie were in the trailer.
I:15899;1319;I didn't expect to enjoy the movie all that much but, it is very good.
I:15899;1320;I recommend it highly to anyone, it presents very real universal human experiences.
I:15899;1321;I never got to the part with Brad Pitt.
I:15899;1322;"This movie is intense and it uses up every grains of your concentration and energy in deciphering the sum of the parts of ""Babel""."
I:15899;1323;For Mexico's segment of the story, the babysitter of the American couple would take their children to Mexico for a wedding.
I:15899;1324;The beauty of this movie is that towards the end, everyone is linked directly and indirectly.
I:15899;1325;Babel is an intelligent movie that raises questions about barriers and applaud it for its capacity to have us evaluating upon the topic even when the final credit rolls.
I:15899;1326;Highly recommended and an experience not to be missed.
I:15899;1327;I watched this masterpiece last night and it is the best i have ever seen since crash and brokeback mountain.
I:15899;1328;This is movie with an intriguing plot that kept me on the edge of my seat.
I:15899;1329;"'Babel' is yet another incarnation of the whole tried and true ""east meets west,"" ""we're all really the same,"" international thriller imbued with social commentary genre."
I:15899;1330;"I did find the stories of the deaf Japanese girl and the two little Morroccan kids to be very touching but even in some parts of that I found myself asking out loud, ""what the hell is going on?"""
I:15899;1331;"Besides for a few momentary ""flashes of brilliance,"" the acting was good and the cinematography was also exceptional."
I:15899;1332;Brad Pitt should have been nominated and should have won the Oscar for his performance in Babel.
I:15899;1333;The movie is far better than Crash.
I:15899;1334;A Moroccan family gets a rifle to protect their goats.
I:15899;1335;"By the time the press gets a hold of the story they label the incident as a ""terrorist attack""."
I:15899;1336;The caretaker decides to take the kids to Mexico to attend her son's wedding.
I:15899;1337;Brad Pitt and Rinko Kikuchi who plays the Japanese girl give great performances.
I:15899;1338;Brad Pitt and Rinko Kikuchi who plays the Japanese girl give great performances.
I:15899;1339;BRAD PITT gives his best performance only after FIGHT CLUB.
I:15899;1340;Babel is a entertaining, yet sad movie that is worth taking a look at.
I:15899;1341;Babel is up against The Departed for this years Best Picture Awards at the Oscars.
I:15899;1342;I enjoyed this film but to me The Departed was a better movie and will most likely take home Best Picture Oscar.
I:15899;1343;The acting is excellent, the locales exotic and the cinematography is beautiful.
I:15899;1344;Requires attention to follow the plot.
I:15899;1345;And I thought I had ADD.
I:15899;1346;***SLIGHT SPOILER*** What are the odds of one family finding themselves in life.
I:15899;1347;Another Hollywood gem condemning guns and sympathizing with the plight of illegal aliens.
I:15899;1348;Watch this if you want to see a beautifully filmed, channel.
I:15899;1349;I'd have liked the whole movie to be about the deaf teenager feeling isolated following her mother's death.
I:15899;1350;By far, my favorite thing about this movie is the description here on the amazon.
I:15899;1351;"the enormous metropolis of Tokyo, Japan that is literally the size of the state of California."""
I:15899;1352;Like I said, you'll have to be willing to accept a lot of big stretches to get through this one.
I:15899;1353;The American couple forces the housekeeper has to make a series of choices.
I:15899;1354;"the acting in this film is superb
I:15899;1355;Every bit as good are the performances of the two brothers' and their father.
I:15899;1356;Great story, good editing, superb performances.
I:15899;1357;A masterpiece to be treasured for years to come.
I:15899;1358;The exotic shooting locales in this movie are impressive.
I:15899;1359;a good movie should make people think and take something back from the time spent watching it.
I:15899;1360;I think the movie could have made a great travel documentary.
I:15899;1361;The acting was fine from everyone, but it's Adriana Barazza who shines the most, in a sincere and heartbreaking performance.
I:15899;1362;"I wish the great Robert Altman could've seen this film
I:15899;1363;Inarritu's first film, Amores Perros, and it was better.
I:15899;1364;"Those other ""small"" films were superior."
I:15899;1365;I remember hearing about it a few years ago.
I:15899;1366;this was a good story that has many intertwining story lines.
I:15899;1367;"One of the Great Films of 2006 along with ""Sicko""."
I:15899;1368;"I give this film one more star than I gave ""Crash"" because Cate Blanchett was in it and the story involving the Japanese teenager was interesting."
I:15899;1369;The final moments when it is revealed how all the stories are connected was well can you say STRETCH.
I:15899;1370;Oh well at least the Academy had the good sense not to repeat last years debacle.
I:15899;1371;I went to see it because Im a big fan of Brad Pitt's but the movie is brilliant!The way its put together and the way it is so intense is so artisic and briliant!I don't think I've ever seen a movie quite like this before.
I:15899;1372;If you like wonderfully crafted art movies check it out!!
I:15899;1373;He presents a series of misfortunes which befall his victims.
I:15899;1374;"we wait to see if they survive
I:15899;1375;"As powerful and brilliant Inarritu's first two films were (""Amores Perros"" and ""21 Grams""), they seem to have naturally led to this quintessential masterpiece, ""Babel"", a tour."
I:15899;1376;force of cinematic poetry and complexity of emotion.
I:15899;1377;placing what seems disconnected stories in four locations of the world, the film gradually comes together like a wonderful jigsaw which succeeds at emphasizing how much all the people of the world depend of each other as well as the difficulty of human communication between us.
I:15899;1378;and Inirratu's sure directorial hand .
I:15899;1379;moves the viewer through pain and redemption like a journey through a perfect diamond.
I:15899;1380;Ultimately, the film becomes a great celebration of the human spirit and a testament of precisely what a high art the cinema can be at its best.
I:15899;1381;don't miss this one, the best film the millennium has given us to date.
I:15899;1382;A riveting sequences of events will keep you guessing until the end how all the stories conclude and are all based on one act of gratitude.
I:15899;1383;This movie is definitely one of the stranger ones that I have seen.
I:15899;1384;It has a lot of good scenes (especially in Morocco, with the 2 boys and the tour bus shooting).
I:15899;1385;The whole Mexico situation was a little disturbing, to put it nicely.
I:15899;1386;The biggest surprise for me is that Brad Pitt gave such an excellent performance, I am not one of his fans and find his acting rather flat, but in this one he comes alive and really shines.
I:15899;1387;The story is an excellent self.
I:15899;1388;Love the actors and and plot.
I:15899;1389;I definately watch it agin.
I:15899;1390;the acting of the Japanese scene seems best, but the Moroccan boys are good.
I:15899;1391;the second story involves the couple's young children back home in California, who are taken on an unauthorized trip to Mexico by their illegal.
I:15899;1392;at times feeling it was a work of genius, at others, feeling like it was not working at all .
I:15899;1393;but, eventually, the movie won me over entirely as the meanings came more into focus and as each story moved inexorably towards its emotionally wrenching conclusion.
I:15899;1394;Much of the credit in this regard goes to the powerful musical score by Gustavo Santaollala, which starts off slowly then builds in intensity as the movie draws to a close.
I:15899;1395;The film is replete with many such moments.
I:15899;1396;inarritu has drawn riveting performances out of his large cast, primarily from Pitt, Blanchett, Adriana Barraza and Rinko Kikuchi.
I:15899;1397;story film, these performers all make the most of the scenes they are in.
I:15899;1398;important, for pretending to be more insightful and profound about the state of the world than, perhaps, it really is.
I:15899;1399;"This may be true to a certain degree, but I don't think that's what ""Babel"" is essentially about."
I:15899;1400;Babel contains more Christian themes than you may think.
I:15899;1401;Excellent to watch the interconnectedness between cultures and actions.
I:15899;1402;Interesting how one rifle negatively influenced so many people.
I:15899;1403;"This is by far the best movie of 2006, much better than ""The Departed"" which won the Oscar."
I:15899;1404;The story is intelligently written done and quite thought provoking with a minimum of violence.
I:15899;1405;The Japanese actress and the Mexican actress were excellent in their supporting roles.
I:15899;1406;Babel is about the start of a small change in initial conditions.
I:15899;1407;i still enjoyed the movie, and it seemed particularly appropriate on a theater.
I:15899;1408;If you can, see Babel at your local art cinema.
I:15899;1409;I got more enjoyment from watching the grass grow in my yard while drinking a cool glass of ice tea.
I:15899;1410;I like the diversity of the story, and i love movies that gives me a thrill of anticipation.
I:15899;1411;Babel looks like the best of independent films.
I:15899;1412;Unknown actors make this film feel REAL.
I:15899;1413;I rritu has created a cross.
I:15899;1414;Babel is poetry, building on its humble, multi.
I:15899;1415;layered opening act into a remarkable, crushing peak of emotion before closing on a cathartic shot of such visual power that the camera pulls back into eternity and drags memories of the total experience along with it.
I:15899;1416;written by Guillermo Arriaga and directed by Alejandro Gonz lez Inarritu, this is the final in their trilogy of complex, literate films exploring the human condition.
I:15899;1417;"Babel is the best of them
I:15899;1418;ups that we finally see Pitt's age around his eyes.
I:15899;1419;We see the tears developing in the corners of Chieko's eyes.
I:15899;1420;"Chieko pretends to understand her sexuality, but is in fact so shy and sweet and hungry for contact that she cozies up to a new friend and says ""You smell good!"
I:15899;1421;In the Moroccan family, there are two brothers.
I:15899;1422;He likes to watch his sister take off her clothes then find a nook in the mountainside to think about her.
I:15899;1423;what emerges, really, is a portrait of human frailty and brokenness.
I:15899;1424;but emotional and spiritual emptiness.
I:15899;1425;"Some of the characters in ""Babel"" find redemption
I:15899;1426;"from the third row of the theater, which is where ""Babel"" ought to be watched, Kikuchi is unforgettable."
I:15899;1427;"i thought ""Crash"" was pretty effective, although it went off the rails in its final scenes."
I:15899;1428;"But ""Babel,"" while surreal, is more organic and believable."
I:15899;1429;It's one of the best movies of the year.
I:15899;1430;this one however was worth it.
I:15899;1431;brad Pitt is often just something nice to look at but not all that interesting in terms of the characters he plays, this was pretty good.
I:15899;1432;This is a very good movie .
I:15899;1433;this a true ensemble piece, and even though big.
I:15899;1434;The friend has two young boys who tend the flock, and thanks to boys being boys, they end up taking shots at a tour bus as it drives by .
I:15899;1435;aid is the high water mark of medical care.
I:15899;1436;whom she loves and has raised as her own .
I:15899;1437;She has begged for someone to watch the kids, but nobody helps her.
I:15899;1438;Syriana is a political tale.
I:15899;1439;Director Alejandro Gonz lez I rritu's well.
I:15899;1440;"Despite strong performances and stunning cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto, ""Babel"" never connects as a satisfying whole."
I:15899;1441;Though he captures some powerful moments, I rritu's overreaching ambition gets the best of him.
I:15899;1442;I was both excited and hesitant to start watching this movie.
I:15899;1443;Excited because from what I'd heard of the movie and from the cover alone, I sensed the potential for learning something deep and profound about life and humanity.
I:15899;1444;If the director was trying to demonstrate the stupidity of people, he almost succeeds.
I:15899;1445;The Japanese girl had the best characterization.
I:15899;1446;I wish that the entire movie had been about the Japanese girl since her story was the most compelling, but there was still not enough of it.
I:15899;1447;The meaning behind the title is clear from the beginning, since the difficulty in communicating is palpable and has some serious consequences.
I:15899;1448;The director I rritu, delivers a production that belongs to the highest echelon in terms of its artistic value, but has some elements that make it less than perfect.
I:15899;1449;Meanwhile, back in the United States Amelia is taking care of Richard's kids and needs to go to the wedding of her son.
I:15899;1450;The continuous jumping from one story to the next keeps the plot interesting and the slight time shifts are easy to follow.
I:15899;1451;I do not want to give away the scene I am referring to, but I am pretty confident you will spot it right away if you watch the movie.
I:15899;1452;one of the biggest pluses I found in this film was the performances of all of the participants in the cast.
I:15899;1453;Brad Pitt really surprised me, with a vivid and emotional portrayal of Richard.
I:15899;1454;As usual, Cate Blanchett delivers a top notch performance, but her role requires limited screen time and renlinquishes her role almost to a secondary spot.
I:15899;1455;He displays his usual charm and intensity in portraying a character that allows him to show his strengths as an actor.
I:15899;1456;I hope that the review provides you with a basis to determine in which category you fall and whether you are likely to like this film.
I:15899;1457;back in America, a Mexican nanny wants to go to her son's wedding in Mexico.
I:15899;1458;This is by far the best narrative in this film.
I:15899;1459;The narrative is slow at times, but I liked the way the film took its time to tell its story.
I:15899;1460;There is rarely a dull moment in Babel and the emotional punch strikes you right in the gut and steals your breath away.
I:15899;1461;I highly recommended this film to anyone who enjoyed the director's previous efforts.
I:15899;1462;This movie kept us on the edge of our seats.
I:15899;1463;"The cover says, ""Brad Pitt's best film performance,"" but that's an outright lie."
I:15899;1464;His acting is fine, but far from his best, plus he's only in about 20 minutes of the movie anyway.
I:15899;1465;This is a complex and interesting tale with interwoven stories.
I:15899;1466;then everyone said, Yeah, that works!
I:15899;1467;Babel is a good movie, and one I would probably give 4 stars to, if it wasn't for the oh.
I:15899;1468;On the good side, just as in 21 Grams, he really brings out the best in his actors.
I:15899;1469;"There is an early scene Pitt has with Cate Blanchett at a table in a blasted landscape that I swear was influenced by Hemingway's short story ""Hills Like White Elephants."""
I:15899;1470;Clearly, Inarritu is one literate guy, and one who can frame that literacy in one remarkable scene after another.
I:15899;1471;As dazzling as all this back and forth non.
I:15899;1472;As stand alone stories, I thought each could easily have been expanded into their own films.
I:15899;1473;Still, Inarritu is a great director who is going to make a lot of great films, and I welcome the risk taking going on in Babel, even if I'm not totally satisfied with the result.
I:15899;1474;This was a good film.
I:15899;1475;gael Garcia Bernal is one of my favorites.
I:15899;1476;This movie was well acted by all.
I:15899;1477;pitt's performance was indeed very good.
I:15899;1478;the movie was fantastically entertaining.
I:15899;1479;And let me tell you that Babel surprised me.
I:15899;1480;I thought that I was in for a Kate Blanchett/Brad Pitt fest, but what I got was a story that was much more compelling, complex and expertly told by a director with a very short resume.
I:15899;1481;a director that now will have surely earned the status of making people attracted to a movie just because his name is attached to it.
I:15899;1482;But I rritu does an excellent job of keeping the unreal real.
I:15899;1483;away is that this is a relatively long movie that keeps you in your seat without the desire for a break.
I:15899;1484;superb acting on all parts, interweaving of a complex story shows masterful directing and fine production values.
I:15899;1485;I rarely find movies I enjoy.
I:15899;1486;Great acting, storyline interesting and gripping.
I:15899;1487;The writer did a great job of writing a story of lanquages, countries, possesions, and people's emotions.
I:15899;1488;after watching the film I absolutely disagree.
I:15899;1489;It is an amazing work of creativity, especially in how it slowly reveals the interconnections that span the globe.
I:15899;1490;i must say that the storyline involving the Japanese girl was the most intriguing and eye.
I:15899;1491;opening, and the actress playing the girl is perhaps one of the most brave I have seen.
I:15899;1492;The scene in the disco near the end of her story thread was just amazing and emotionally engaging.
I:15899;1493;on the topic of Brad Pitt, I thoroughly enjoy his performances .
I:15899;1494;and I think he's one of the best actors working today.
I:15899;1495;There are probably a lot of people who will disagree with me and say that he's just there for his looks, but ever since I saw him years ago in Legends of the Fall I have been impressed by his performances.
I:15899;1496;overall, my strong recommendation to see this movie is only extended to those who are not distracted or put.
I:15899;1497;You must be able to keep an open mind when you see events being portrayed in an anti.
I:15899;1498;myself, when I watch a movie I tend to immerse myself in the story without weighing each point against my own belief system, so I can experience it the way the director intended, even though I may have strong disagreements with Hollywood writers and their social agendas.
I:15899;1499;But I guess life is like that, you have events that have a major impact and then you keep on going, plus we are a lot more connected than we first realise.
I:15899;1500;The performances were excellent, especially Chieko, the japanese deaf.
I:15899;1501;The ending piece of music was especially moving and added perfectly to the final scene.
I:15899;1502;This is a good film and worth a watch, it has no definite beginning, middle and end, but that in no way detracts from the various stories and their impact, although I feel that may have disappointed other reviewers here.
I:15899;1503;Our natural ability as humans is to try and make things better for ourselves and for our families.
I:15899;1504;We look for positivity in every day life and sometimes come to the movies to escape every day reality and to dream and to look for hope and for overall solace.
I:15899;1505;Go figure, I honestly thought the best performance was done by the deaf.
I:15899;1506;Unless you're a viewer with similar experiences, it is a comforting thought that you are not alone, but I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone with a general overall positive outlook on life that seeks redemption after every imaginable struggle.
I:15899;1507;the seperate threads also contain themes which link the stories together to make a larger statement.
I:15899;1508;'Babel' is probably Innaritu's best work since 'Ammores Perros' took the international movie scene by storm.
I:15899;1509;It is a rich beautiful movie .
I:15899;1510;intense, emotional, and visually gorgeous.
I:15899;1511;Its implications are enormous .
I:15899;1512;it tells us a lot about how delicate our relations with the rest of the world can be.
I:15899;1513;This along with 'the departed' were the two best films of the year in my opinion.
I:15899;1514;Nominated for six Academy Awards (and winner for Music Score), producer.
I:15899;1515;director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's BABEL is a complex and challenging treat for adult moviegoers.
I:15899;1516;A nomad family has received a powerful rifle as a survival present.
I:15899;1517;Using it for fun, one child seriously wounds Blanchett in a distant tour bus.
I:15899;1518;The guests include the kids of Blanchett and Pitt, plus their loyal long.
I:15899;1519;Cut to Tokyo, all bright lights and neon signs at night.
I:15899;1520;Most troubling of all, Barraza's illegal alien nanny character has a powerful pre.
I:15899;1521;dawn confrontation with a Mexico.
I:15899;1522;cuts these three beautifully written and acted subplots faster and faster as we pass the two hour running time mark, with twenty minutes or so to go.
I:15899;1523;BABEL is a masterpiece of filmmaking with a lingering power for me.
I:15899;1524;It is the crowning achievement for Inarritu,.
I:15899;1525;This is definitely his best film.
I:15899;1526;I will only say that the stories are satisfyingly and optimistically wrapped up for me, and that the final shot in nighttime Tokyo is haunting.
I:15899;1527;in for Best Picture!Its politically correct themes are delivered with the subtlety of a steam roller.
I:15899;1528;If I want to see teenage girls flashing their underparts, the internet is full of it.
I:15899;1529;"The movie ""crash"" has a similar plot, and in each story it has to do with difficulty due to miscommunication."
I:15899;1530;Worth one watch, but can't say I plan to watch it again any time soon.
I:15899;1531;"I enjoyed Babel, but not on the level of ""best picture of the year."""
I:15899;1532;I found last year's Crash to be a much better drama of this sort (multiple stories intermingling).
I:15899;1533;The acting is stellar, the story is well told, and the scenery and imagery were breathtaking.
I:15899;1534;mexico and Japan, and I enjoyed watching those scenes.
I:15899;1535;I thought this movie was probably a good thirty to forty.
I:15899;1536;all, though, you could watch dozens of bigger wastes of time than Babel and it is a solid, thought provoking, and somewhat provocative movie.
I:15899;1537;Better to live in your dream world than to face reality, I guess.
I:15899;1538;I'm sure a good soaking in the bathtub of their home in the cul.
I:15899;1539;mart made everything all better.
I:15899;1540;Pitt and Blanchett are the focus of one of the stories, but the other three are probably more compelling.
I:15899;1541;the film will take you to Morocco, the US, Mexico and Japan.
I:15899;1542;It deals with themes such as love, loneliness, adolescence, the law, and kindness.
I:15899;1543;the appeal of Babel for me is the way in which Inarritu weaves the complex threads together to create a believable and enthralling story.
I:15899;1544;The gun itself starts a chain of events that are indeed connected, so that's 3 stories: Gun to shepard/sons who shoots American couple that prevented their relatives from reliefing the Mexican nanny so she took their kids to Mexico so she could attend her son's wedding and getting caught at the border, etc.
I:15899;1545;A powerful story and a great performance lead by Brad Pit.
I:15899;1546;The move explores a few stereotypes while interweaving of stories from lives across continents, making for an interesting movie.
I:15899;1547;Babel is a film that asks us to rise above our cultural preconceptions because the director is not an American.
I:15899;1548;He has not created a movie on the customary template of an action film (like Crash) that has a generous measure of high.
I:15899;1549;Many reviewers were absolutely scandalized by a couple of brief scenes involving teenage sexuality.
I:15899;1550;subtle slams against American foreign policy and the American (and wealthy White) temperament and sense of entitlement.
I:15899;1551;reaching, compelling, brilliantly conceived and masterfully portrayed.
I:15899;1552;"All the main actors were fantastic (and minor roles as well)
I:15899;1553;In defense of Brad Pitt, I thought he was solid, very moving and emotionally authentic in this dramatic role, if not the most sympathetic character.
I:15899;1554;It is art reflecting life, but choreographed and illuminated in such a way that we can bear the pain and see the beauty.
I:15899;1555;Someone is so threatened by my opinions that they are compelled to keep you from reading this.
I:15899;1556;It's so complex, has so much to say, and works on so many levels.
I:15899;1557;rendering their ability to communicate null.
I:15899;1558;i also find it very interesting that the over.
I:15899;1559;This basic idea is rendered in a heartfelt, poignant manner through Rinko Kikuchi's performance of a deaf teenager, and reiterated in many scenes.
I:15899;1560;The separation and isolation from others is driven home through the dance club sequence, and Rinko's sobering exit.
I:15899;1561;This single stage of communication is on the intimate, personal level with another person.
I:15899;1562;And it's through this that discrimination is born.
I:15899;1563;What better way to show how discrimination caused by separation caused by lack of communication can effect not only ourselves but future generations?It has been noted many times that the cinematic merits of this film are impeccable, and nearly impossible to dispute.
I:15899;1564;Editing, cinematography, score, sound, etc. are all handled with a true level of directorial mastery.
I:15899;1565;The acting is equally superb.
I:15899;1566;"The two ""big names"" of Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett turn in terrific and (surprisingly) understated performances."
I:15899;1567;The demands on her in this film are higher than any one else.
I:15899;1568;Throughout all of her scenes she runs the gamut of emotions, and she handles them with a level of genuine emotion and a delicate touch.
I:15899;1569;Even in a film with great all.
I:15899;1570;around performances, she steals the show.
I:15899;1571;Finally, Mustapha Rachidi as the Moroccan farmer is only of lesser note in light of the other extraordinary performances, but is excellent as well.
I:15899;1572;But is it so simple?
I:15899;1573;In the case of the Mexican nanny, she makes one seemingly harmless decision to take the children she's watching to a marriage in Mexico.
I:15899;1574;It really says something that this film has been a huge hit throughout the world, but grossed relatively little here.
I:15899;1575;Films like Crash, Syriana, and the like have garnered much more attention, yet Babel has out.
I:15899;1576;If you're willing to look deeper and try to understand each individual story within its context and what's being said, this is a film that will likely really hit home with you.
I:15899;1577;The American family is purely innocent in this entire escapade, and are completely victimized by the stupid decisions made by people from foreign countries.
I:15899;1578;if you are wondering whether or not to watch this movie, please pass this one by.
I:15899;1579;I've seen this movie numerous times and each time I get a new message from it.
I:15899;1580;It contains wonderful and deep performances.
I:15899;1581;i like this move because it shows that our actions have a ripple affect.
I:15899;1582;We may do something and it affects more than just us in this case all the way across the world.
I:15899;1583;The resolution on a large screen is superb, especially the mountain shots.
I:15899;1584;Seen it in the theatre .
I:15899;1585;that are friends of course.
I:15899;1586;and it seems that they are in competition with each otherThe audience is the winner.
I:15899;1587;Babel may not be the perfect movie, but it is riveting, intelligent, inventive, superbly acted, directed, and filmed.
I:15899;1588;And it really sticks in your mind.
I:15899;1589;Any serious fan of film has to have this film in their repertory.
I:15899;1590;His latest is an intense, depressing, and brilliant look into the way which we as humans perform miscommunication.
I:15899;1591;the film is blessed with exceptional acting all around from actors and actresses of whom you probably have never heard.
I:15899;1592;Their miscommunication with each other has created a break in their relationship.
I:15899;1593;Irresponsibly, she takes the kids with her to Mexico for the wedding and plans on bringing them back across the border into the States.
I:15899;1594;It's funny how going into Mexico sure is easier than coming back.
I:15899;1595;Simply put, Rinko Kikuchi's character Chieko is the most fascinating and best part of the film.
I:15899;1596;the film may feel slow to some and yet engaging to others.
I:15899;1597;listen to this film, you will be rewarded.
I:15899;1598;Great color and scenery around the world.
I:15899;1599;Gee, what a great topic for a movie.
I:15899;1600;It is hard to understand the connection among these stories.
I:15899;1601;even though the actors and actress have good performance in this drama.
I:15899;1602;Multiple stories going on at the same time .
I:15899;1603;I liked the acting .
I:15899;1604;Some what complex plot but everything comes together as the movie goes along.
I:15899;1605;It came together beautifully but at the end it left me down.
I:15899;1606;Need to have more uplifting movies to take us away from reality.
I:15899;1607;This is probably the dumbest movie ever made.
I:15899;1608;(All good movies but the same techniques and photo effects.)
I:15899;1609;If you are far left and hate America this is your favorite film or close to it.
I:15899;1610;so if it is please go live in a communist/socialist country.
I:15899;1611;Our preconceptions often veil our reality, in turn keeping us from making human connections with one another.
I:15899;1612;It is incredibly acted by a cast of mainly unknowns, with the exception of Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett.
I:15899;1613;Pitt turns in one of his most gritty performances and cinematographer Rodrigo Pietro is amazing in capturing the ambience and various tones of each location exquisitely.
I:15899;1614;There may be many heartbreaking moments in Babel, but they are certainly worth the payoff.
I:15899;1615;Acting performances make this a memorable experience.
I:15899;1616;I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.
I:15899;1617;Excellent movie, good story plot and the sub.
I:15899;1618;plots were a good twistand how they were tied together was good.
I:15899;1619;And why do I have have a specific number of words???
I:15899;1620;After watching the film, this makes sense.
I:15899;1621;"The film is being positioned to be one of those ""conversation starter"" films, films that create buzz and then earn some Oscar nominations."
I:15899;1622;The smaller it looks, the better its chances.
I:15899;1623;Babel is a very good film.
I:15899;1624;He gives the gun to his two sons, who take the goat herd out every day.
I:15899;1625;She decides to take the children with her.
I:15899;1626;She is also very anxious to have sex and many of the boys treat her as a freak when they find out she is a deaf mute.
I:15899;1627;So she teases them and other men, in an effort for some release.
I:15899;1628;For a film like this to work, a film containing elaborate, multifaceted stories, everything has to be connected and work well together, like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle.
I:15899;1629;Everything else fits into place nicely and works together, which makes the Japanese story stand out all the more.
I:15899;1630;that said, the story is interesting, unusual and worth watching.
I:15899;1631;Babel is a little of both.
I:15899;1632;Because Inarritu is taking us in many directions, he has to create a compelling and interesting story.
I:15899;1633;A local brings them a plate of flatbread, because they must be hungry, yet they avoid her.
I:15899;1634;She decides to take them along and because they have grown up with her, they are completely at ease.
I:15899;1635;Once they arrive at the wedding, these shy children have a great time, meeting new people, learning new things.
I:15899;1636;She and her friend are introduced to another friend's cousin, a handsome boy who doesn't seem to mind they are deaf because he has grown up with his cousin and he even understands some sign language.
I:15899;1637;As she moves in, she finds the boy kissing her friend.
I:15899;1638;because each of these stories has many layers, the filmmaker holds our attention to the very end.
I:15899;1639;It makes them seem more real, more life like, because life isn't neat and tidy.
I:15899;1640;if you have seen either of Inarritu's previous films, you will recognize this film as his own.
I:15899;1641;For instance, we first meet the Moroccan man and his family, learn about their life and watch as the neighbor trades them a gun and bullets.
I:15899;1642;The film cuts to a home in California.
I:15899;1643;Later, she is shot by a stray bullet.
I:15899;1644;The next day, the nanny's nephew comes to pick them up and take them to the wedding.
I:15899;1645;Because of this, some of the stories are the consequence of other actions in other parts of the film.
I:15899;1646;He acts as a facilitator, getting the children acclimated to their new surroundings, but then he has a good time, along with everyone else, during the festive ceremony.
I:15899;1647;I keep coming back to that.
I:15899;1648;"The story is interesting and unusual
I:15899;1649;We are immediately drawn in and the character is interesting, perhaps the most fully developed.
I:15899;1650;It is interesting, thought provoking and well.
I:15899;1651;I loved this film, it was not hard to follow at all and was very emotional.
I:15899;1652;Definitely one of the better films on Prime at the moment.
I:15899;1653;Should be able to sort to only english from all devices.
I:15899;1654;I gotta say I really enjoyed it.
I:15899;1655;The whole theme is about misunderstanding .
I:15899;1656;i recommend this movie if you are looking for something deeper, not mere entertainment.
I:15899;1657;WOW, it shocks me that so many people write glowing reviews of this film!
I:15899;1658;Loved the directors methods and how he brought all the stories together.
I:15899;1659;Very good film and I would recommend it to most adults.
I:15899;1660;There is raw humanity in this one that's for sure.
I:15899;1661;This movie is a compelling tale, one that delineates how small mistakes and lapses in judgment can have tragic consequences.
I:15899;1662;When you sit down to watch a film, you're essentially investing your time with the expectation of entertainment or fulfillment.
I:15899;1663;If you like senseless movies, or suspense that goes nowhere, you'll love it.
I:15899;1664;And it takes 2 hours to take you there.
I:15899;1665;"for me the most impressive part of ""Babel"" is the story about the family living in the Moroccan desert."
I:15899;1666;These two child actors are amazing with natural and compelling performances, better than Brad Pitt and Cate Banchett as the stranded travelers, and their actions, not wise but credible, well.
I:15899;1667;"Actually with their stories alone ""Babel"" could be a great film with its message ""Tower of Babel"" intact."
I:15899;1668;Though each story is well acted, American and Japanese sections are weaker than those about the Moroccan family.
I:15899;1669;i know the director's flair for interlocked narrative, and he uses it quite tactfully here, but I think a simpler approach would be as effective as that.
I:15899;1670;It's the perfect title considering how crazy confusing it is.
I:15899;1671;Personally, I like a movie that gives you an actual ending.
I:15899;1672;This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat wondering what will happen next and what will the outcome be for all the diverse characters.
I:15899;1673;Then MAYBE I'll like it and understand it.
I:15899;1674;The black hole vacuum he creates on the screen is so great it even sucks in the usually brilliant Kate Blanchett.
I:15899;1675;kudos to one solitary brilliant moment when a deaf.
I:15899;1676;He did an incredible job portraying a man in distress.
I:15899;1677;There was nothing in this film that I truly found to be interesting.
I:15899;1678;Otherwise, the story line and the photography was great.
I:15899;1679;A Really good representation of Latin Directors, Beatifull Photograpy and amazing Actors.
I:15899;1680;I enjoy movies that take me places.
I:15899;1681;the acting in this movie is intense even if the story lags a bit and exhibits some disturbing scenes that I would have rather not viewed.
I:15899;1682;I always tend to look for the message and what speaks to me and this movie spoke to me as a relevant lesson in the need for individual and cultural understanding.
I:15899;1683;"Okay, the positives first: great soundtrack and scenery
I:15899;1684;Keeps you wondering how it all fits together.
I:15899;1685;Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett did well pulling out of The Fountain and winding up in this production.
I:15899;1686;The supporting actors carry their segments admirably as well.
I:15899;1687;Though reminding quite a bit of the movie, Crash, this film proved to be a powerful drama with compelling performances by all of its actors.
I:15899;1688;The director of the movie, Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, manages to capture the true humanity in each of the characters and how we're all interconnected in today's world.
I:15899;1689;films that expose American audiences to the complex interconnections of the modern world.
I:15899;1690;all the acting is good.
I:15899;1691;It's nice seeing Brad Pitt showing his age a bit, looking older.
I:15899;1692;Gael Garc a Bernal is always good, even though the character he plays in the one makes all the wrong choices.
I:15899;1693;And Rinko Kikuchi is great too.
I:15899;1694;I find her character tragic, sympathetic, and very believable.
I:15899;1695;Thankfully, with the director's success with this and other films, we're going to get them.
I:15899;1696;This could have been a great film, but I can't recommend the final product.
I:15899;1697;The world we live in is indeed complex, and inter.
I:15899;1698;It reminds me of young kids telling stories.
I:15899;1699;often forgot something and go back and forth, and digress to whateverland interests them at the moment.
I:15899;1700;you can finish the whole thing in 200 words.
I:15899;1701;Must have something to do with industry politics.
I:15899;1702;Let me tell you something this movie will take you through every emotion that a human is possible of having.
I:15899;1703;Brad Pitt gives the performance of his career.
I:15899;1704;A fascinating story woven by the surprising and unexpected relationships in people around the world in a single event.
I:15899;1705;Performance is superb on all counts.
I:15899;1706;"It is R. rated for good reason
I:15899;1707;I'll be honest, this movie is just not a kind of movie I care for, but I give it credit, many other people are right to like it.
I:15899;1708;An interesting weave of timelines and segments of a tale.
I:15899;1709;Ad a japaneese school girl and her father into the mix, and you think, how the heck can you tie these together?
I:15899;1710;Well, it the movie does, and dramatically.
I:15899;1711;It is catching, and most should find this film moving.
I:15899;1712;The outcomes are all driven by cultural context in surprising ways.
I:15899;1713;up, return home, find each other or reconnect with those they love.
I:15899;1714;i personally found the depictions of American and Japanese culture entertaining and enlightening.
I:15899;1715;brad Pitt is only a member of a talented international cast of actors otherwise unknown to this amateur film lover.
I:15899;1716;I thought this was a riveting movie of several interconnected emotional stories.
I:15899;1717;5 more words are required by Amazon for this review: What a cool movie, I.
I:15899;1718;The sweeping shots of mountains are at first awe.
I:15899;1719;inspiring, then soon start to resemble something from a National Geographic special.
I:15899;1720;"There's nothing really memorable here
I:15899;1721;The Constant Gardener is a much better film.
I:15899;1722;i kept wanting to fast.
I:15899;1723;i will say one positive thing about this film and that is the performance by Adriana Barraza.
I:15899;1724;This is a surprising movie.
I:15899;1725;Also, the way it describes culture difference is really amazing.
I:15899;1726;Excellent script (4 stories looking strange at first and connecting together at the end) ,excellent director and actors.
I:15899;1727;movie making at its best.
I:15899;1728;This movie builds you up for a VERY big let down!
I:15899;1729;The story is riveting and the plot keeps you glued to the story until the end when it runs into the let down brick wall!
I:15899;1730;The story is very interesting, the price for the movie was great, the ending Huge Let Down!
I:15899;1731;Director Inarritu masterfully interweaves four stories (each fully capable of standing on its own as a feature) into a series of connected experiences and shows how events in each person's life effects others.
I:15899;1732;And for creative storytelling and remarkable acting, look no further than this continent.
I:15899;1733;spanning epic on the minutiae of communication.
I:15899;1734;the story is the thing, and it is woven together beautifully full of damaged characters who go through their own little part of life, connected by coincidence at one point in time.
I:15899;1735;but for a global slice of life and how when senseless tragedy strikes we are all affected in the same way, this film fits the bill.
I:15899;1736;Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett always seem to pick top notch movies to work in.
I:15899;1737;Ironically the two best performances are with the supporting roles by the Japanese woman and the mexican actress.
I:15899;1738;Babel is a humanitarian film that focuses on the human heart on how fragile we all are.
