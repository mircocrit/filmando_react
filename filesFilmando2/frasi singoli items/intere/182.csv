1;I love this movie because of Ed Norton's performance.
2;He is one of my favorit actors.
3;The 25th Hour, directed by Spike Lee is kind of one of those movies that is liked by some but not all.
4;He spends the day with his friends, girlfriend and visits many New York spots.
5;I would say this movie has alot of truths to it and as in many of Spike Lee's movies it has lasting power.
6;If you want to see a great drama and one of Edward Norton's finest movies, definetly give 25th Hour a shot.
7;I thought the ending was nice and it leaves on a sad/good father.
8;It is so subtle but so amazing and meaningful.
9;This is an emotion film relying on the intelligence of the watcher to bring it together.
10;The film is not constructed as a yepee for drug dealers flick, but you feel for him in that he knows that he messed up, and the show of regret in his face is very powerful.
11;Anyone who has ever done anything they regreted (everyone) will really feel this.
12;He rubbed it in our faces with Summer Of Sam and he's doing it again.
13;Mr. Lee's female characters end up more one.
14;Oh, but I forgot, it's an art film.
15;Go ahead and watch 25th Hour and see how powerful Spike is.
16;Very well acted and well shot.
17;Lots has been said about this movie.
18;what struck me is how Spike's knowledge of New York and New Yorkers comes through in this production.
19;ed Norton is perfectly cast as Monty.
20;The story is compelling, yet this is not a feel good movie.
21;And that is the sign of a good movie.
22;Spike Lee masterfully delivers to us `25th Hour', a film so rich with character development and emotion that we are drawn in to each passing frame.
23;`25th Hour' is such a richly fulfilled film, a feature so complete in every category that it's hard to believe it was snubbed so extremely.
24;The night beautifully captures the feeling of panic, the feeling of impending disaster but never lets loose of his relaxed pace and delivery.
25;The lighting, the mood, the atmosphere is all magnificently captured by Spike Lee and company.
26;and what an impressive company he has.
27;Edward Norton
28;Yet another Oscar caliber performance (how is it that he is nominated for everything he does?)
29;As Monty he fleshes out the very soul of this man, the rough exterior that melts away to reveal the vulnerable and frail fear within his heart.
30;You have two aspects to this man and he breathes life to each side.
31;You have his breathtaking monologue in the mirror and his heartbreaking final scene with co. star Barry Pepper.
32;Philip Seymour Hoffman has always been a great supporting player but this is one of his finest performances in my opinion.
33;He is reserved and subtle and thus endearing and memorable.
34;Anna Paquin is also effortlessly captivating here as Mary, the flirtatious student for whom Jacob pines.
35;spike Lee though is the star of this film.
36;Taking Benioff's script (which he adapted from his novel of the same name) and turning it loose on us in such a visually stimulating form Spike was able to pulverize me with one of the most effortlessly mesmerizing films I've seen in a long time.
37;The writing gives you great character studies, the actors are superb, and the camera work of the city is spectacular.
38;One of the best Spike Lee's movie that I've ever seen for sure!
39;the characters in the story are the best part of the movie, as each actor/actress handles their roles with true abandon.
40;around Guys (mainly because of pace), this movie finally depicted the true talents and lead.
41;Philip Seymour Hoffman was great as well, although I felt that Spike Lee forgot to continue on with his development about two.
42;the middle of the movie is normal.
43;and the end of the movie starts with the discontinuity again.
44;this movie was overall enjoyable.
45;to get a flavor of his style and modes of expression.
46;The cast in this film is great and it is a FANTASTIC New York Movie.
47;I'm not a fan of Spike Lee's, but I found this movie to be very good.
48;The whole cast did an excellent job telling the story, especially Norton.
49;Spike Lee's ecelectic and artistic shots were fascinating to watch for that it alone the movie is worth seeing.
50;I also liked how Lee did not shy away from talking about September 11 as other movies taking place in NYC have.
51;Although maybe there isn't much to learn from the characters in The 25th Hour, it still is a trip worth taking.
52;Edward Norton proves himself to be more than an actor a man who acts but acts as if he isnt acting he acts so straight forward that it instantly draws you into his story.
53;this movie brings everything that a spike.
54;lee film should have) good cast, and a suspenseful storyline this is two thumbs up great film watch it todayBen N.
55;Rosario Dawson as Naturelle gives an stellar performance as well as Brian Cox as Monty's (Edward Norton) father.
56;The last 20.30 minutes of the film is great cinema that 'will' make you choke a bit.
57;Edward Norton also redeems himself from Death to Smoochy .
58;The irony was pretty striking.
59;in parts of the movie, you are reminded of the post 9.11 climate and the sacrifices others have made for our freedom.
60;I enjoyed Lee's films Do the Right Thing and Bamboozled much more.
61;this is a movie, for intellagent real smart wise people, who don't really need to know a lot about people to know who they are.
62;she's hot, just to see her alone in this film makes it worth it.
63;all the acting by everyone in this movie is great.
64;and also what's cool is it will mislead you.
65;it's great and everything, nothing wrong with it, speaks some very good truths, and some very sweet dreams, it just made it not quite for my owning pleasure, you might like it, so that's cool.
66;As if he's not the one who's going to go in the jail the next morning, he behaves perfectly calm until the last hours of his freedom.
67;What happens at the '25th hour' is a seemingly surprise, but actually a natural thing that real Montgomery would do.
68;this movie reveals some of the nice aspects of the life, as it's value is immeasurable for a man who is about to lose it.
69;It's a good movie, indeed.
70;Edward Norton delivers a shining performance.
71;This is one of Spike Lee's best.
72;This movie invokes conversation and leaves the audience guessing what happens next even after the end of the movie.
73;This is an unusual movie for Spike Lee.
74;Its one of the few movies that he has maed that really holds your attention from start to finish and does not feature some snarky slam on white people.
75;before he makes his decision, Norton's felon wants to see 3 people: His retired fireman father, his best friend and his second best friend.
76;if you want to see a great movie by Spike Lee, then the 25th Hour is a great choice.
77;There are definitely things I liked about the movie, the acting being the main part.
78;Ed Norton gives a great performance as Monty, a drug dealer who has only 24 hours of freedom before going to prison, and is easily the best thing in this movie.
79;Most of the supporting cast give good performances as well, especially Anna Paquin whose role is unlike any other one she has done.
80;I loved Spike Lee's The 25th Hour and consider it to be one of his finest films .
81;But it's still a brilliant, at times innovative, work blessed with superb protrayals, an electric eye for NY locale and heartbreaking angst.
82;i doubt Spike Lee will ever make a true box office hit .
83;norton's rap during the bathroom scene has been done before in previous Lee films, but in the wake of 9.11, it's perhaps more relevant than ever.
84;The multiple scenes of improvisation also ring a familiar chord, but as a viewer we are witnessing the creative process on screen.
85;the performances are uniformly superb.
86;These moments ring with emotional truth, equally haunting and heartbreaking.
87;He spends his last night of freedom with his two best buddies .
88;the film is right on the money in its exploration of powerlessness.
89;A pair of soliloquys express the dual nature of this feeling .
90;mouthed rant, while looking in a mirror, against pretty much everyone in New York and, ultimately, himself, and 2) Monty's father (Cox) daydreaming about how easy it would be for Monty to escape and begin a new life.
91;The characters aren't sure what to feel, what to do, or what to say to their convicted felon of a friend.25th Hour is some of Spike Lee's best work .
92;smoothly filmed, deliberately paced, seamless in it's transitions from past to present, and the bursts of anger, violence, and pure emotion in the film nearly leap off the screen.
93;Good performances all around, particularly Norton's Monty .
94;spirited guy who's going down nonetheless .
95;And Terrence Blanchard's score is as good as any I've heard in a film in years.
96;25th Hour is a beautiful, complicated, emotional, sometimes scary love letter to a post 9/11 New York City.
97;I have liked Spike Lee's other films with a few reservations but am grateful that he likes to make us think.
98;This movie takes his direction to another more sophisticated league entirely.
99;It is seamless and supported by memorable performances by a great cast.
100;I waited for the right emotional moment to watch this.
101;It is a wonderful and powerful movie that validates not selling yourself short or taking a vibrant and diverse home like the Big Apple for granted.
102;For a major North American release this is a modern master piece!
103;I got it in a orderly fashion and it was so.
104;so, very deep and great performances.
105;Spike Lee's latest, 25th Hour, is his best movie in years, but like every movie he's ever made, it's a mixed bag that's often brilliant but occasionally frustrating.
106;While the clock ticks, Monty gets together with his friends and family and tries to brace himself.
107;These and many of the movie's other ingredients are further proof of Lee's genius as a filmmaker.
108;norton, as always, turns in a smart performance and there are inspired supporting turns by Anna Paquin, Barry Pepper, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Brian Cox and a fine debut by former Baltimore Ravens defensive nose tackle Tony Siragusa as Norton's Ukranian sidekick.
109;but mostly, 25th Hour succeeds as a New Yorker's portrait of his wounded hometown not long after it suffered unspeakable hardships.
110;which captures faces and flags and rubble and skylines and shrines to fallen firefighters with heartbreaking precision .
111;particularly Sway are quite good and would've added to the final cut.
112;I realize from the outset that Spike Lee did not in fact write this film, but, this is easily his smartest and most watchable films since Mo' Better or School Daze (Do The Right Thing was too heavy handed IMHO).
113;A true character study, this film is smart and doesnt pander, while allowing you, the viewer, to simply learn and enjoy on your own.
114;Edward Norton, as usual, shines in his role, bringing a depth of feeling to the role that few could, while Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Barry Papper add to the film by showing their own characters depth.
115;This movie, Spike Lee's latest offering, is essentially his offering to New York as a parting gift.
116;The colours, the characters, the story, the pace, the music .
117;all are brilliantly balanced by the director to make this one of the best movies to come out of 2002.
118;cut, everyone has greater depths than are first seen and it's hard to determine who you sympathize with and who to blame.
119;The performances are all, without exception, excellent.
120;it's a really worthwhile movie and one that, if you enjoy it, you'll want to watch again in a month or two as there are definitely scenes that stand out more once you're not obliged to follow the plot too closely.
121;highly recommended
122;Kudos to Spike Lee whose deft directorial touch and aided by stellar acting performances created a poignant ode to a criminal Monty Brogan possessed with a large measure of sensitivity.
123;Accompanied by his best friends Frank played by Barry Pepper and Jacob played by Philip Seymour Hoffman and his gorgeous and caring girlfriend Naturelle played by the alluring Rosario Dawson, they spend one last night together.
124;He reconnects with his father played by Brian Cox, who although distant throughout Monty's life demonstrates his love for his son.
125;spike Lee concludes his film with a really brilliant ending that leaves you wondering.
126;Great acting, but not what I was expecting.
127;`25th Hour' is truly one of the greatest films to surface in 2002, a year that up until this week I rendered as the year the movies died.
128;That's for another discussion, maybe I'll make a So you'd like to know list to discuss that one.
129;speak, still reeling off of the energy produced with each passing frame.
130;Supported strongly by powerful performances by the entire cast, `25th Hour' delivers a unique premise and a thought provoking script glossed up nicely by Spike Lee's brilliant direction.
131;the brilliant Edward Norton delivers yet another award worthy performance as drug dealer Monty Brogan.
132;Among the few he suspects is his stunning girlfriend Naturelle (Rosario Dawson), one of the only people who knew where he hid his drugs.
133;What makes this film so brilliant is its rich character development.
134;Lastly, and most effective, comes Barry's defining moment, a scene towards the end of the film where he reluctantly carries out Monty's last request of him.
135;flawlessly orchestrated, `25th Hour' is a prime example of how a movie can be done right.
136;From the moment Monty stumbles upon the `Bull Pitt' to the scene where he's driving towards the prison with his father James (Brian Cox) we are completely intoxicated with this well spun and brilliantly crafted drama.
137;Adapted the screenplay from his own novel, David Benioff breathes life into his characters, giving them rich dialog to work with and delivering a fantastic script that these actors take and execute magnificently.
138;Edward Norton has always been one of my favorite actors, a an who can take any role and make it memorable, and Monty Brogan is no exception.
139;Spike Lee is a true New Yorker and this is the first movie to deal with the after effects of 9/11.
140;New Yorkers will appreciate and empathize with the fatalism and sense of hopelessness.
141;This is an invaluable and moving document of an unforgettable period.
142;The 25th Hour has all the elements of an excellent film, and it doesn't let them go to waste.
143;I thought that director Spike Lee did a good jod of giving the attention to this subject that it deserved (particularly in the scene in Franks apartment that overlooks ground zero), but without allowing it to over shadow the story.
144;this film features excellent performances from all cast members, especially Norton.
145;His portrayal of Monty is absolutely stunning.
146;philip Seymour Hoffman also gives a stellar performance as Monty's friend Jacob.
147;Jacob is a high school English teacher who has an interest in one of his students (Anna Paquin) that is slightly more than educational.
148;Hoffman does a wonderful job at showing Jacob's inner conflict.
149;On one hand, Jacob has this attraction to his student, while on the other he has his career and his reputation for being relatively straight laced.
150;rosario Dawson also turns in a great performance as Monty's girlfriend Naturelle.
151;I thought that the film did an excellent job at showing this without glorifying drug dealing.
152;the direction from Lee is also remarkable.
153;He seems to understand Monty's inner conflict and shows it very well.
154;The editing is also very good in this film.
155;all things considered, this is a very interesting movie.
156;spike Lee fan after being alienated by 2 of his films, Mo Better blues and Jungle Fever but this film was recommended to me by my cousin and also star Edward Norton spoke highly of his relationship with Lee during the making of this film.
157;Norton together with a fine cast (Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Brian Cox, Barry Pepper and the luscious Rosario Dawson)plus a very good screenplay by David Benihoff (Troy) help to make this one of Spike's best films.
158;lee fan like I was, you may change your opinion after seeing this fine film.
159;It's a funny thing about Spike Lee, but he often seems to do a better job directing white actors, rather than people of color.
160;That's certainly true of Edward Norton's character, a mid.
161;Monty recently got busted, though, and today's his last day in New York before he has to turn himself in for a mandatory seven.year prison sentence.
162;The movie unfolds slowly, unhurried, and taken as a whole, may be Spike Lee's best.
163;He is the best director working in America right now, and he's the best filmmaker of his generation.
164;take, for example, 25th Hour.
165;Instead, it's a carefully woven tale of one man's life and friendships dissolving in a post.9/11 New York that is coming apart itself.
166;It's a fascinating sequence, and worth seeing 25th Hour for by itself.
167;perfect performance as a hardened young man who's not as indestructible as he thinks he is, even when he's assaulting another man in a gut.
168;As we see Pepper's shell erode, he becomes more recognizable, more human.
169;lee also films New York City better than anyone in the movies today.
170;This is a New York movie .
171;exploring every nuance in the city with 9/11 still, sometimes literally, in the backdrop.
172;Even when the story meanders, Lee always gives you something to look at.
173;But even in that moment there is a glimmer of hope that Lee wants to take away from the bleakness of both Monty's life and New York City.
174;As Jimmy Breslin said in Summer of Sam, New York City is a town that you both love and hate equally.
175;that makes 25th Hour so compelling.
176;Rosaria Dawson is beautiful and talented .
177;the best thing about the flick .
178;and truly, the only things worth watching .
179;While watching 25th Hour I was treated to one of the most incredable and emotional monolouges that I have yet to see.
180;It was so powerfully moving, and it uses the f word a strong number of times.
181;He decides to spend his last night of freedom with his two best friends Jacob and Frank, as well as his girlfriend Naturelle Riviera.
182;He then goes to a nightclub with his friends, and he also meets his drug lord boss Uncle Nikolai.
183;I saw 25th Hour about a year ago, and I loved it so much, that I remembered it to include it on my Top 10 List of 2003.
184;See 25th Hour and just listen to what the character's say.
185;It's a brilliant film that I recommend.
186;also see this movie for the preformances.
187;I love Edward Norton as an actor, and thought his preformance in Death to Smoochy, showed that he could do comedy as well as hard drama like this.
188;Phillip Seymour Hoffman is great in this as he is in everything.
189;He is a brilliant actor that should get more respect, especially in this movie.
190;Edward Norton should have won Best Actor during the Oscars last year for this.
191;The is a classic film.
192;I myself had some trouble with it for the first 15 minutes, it seemed to ramble, but I stayed with it because I admire Spike Lee's work.
193;And it proved to be worth the hang.
194;First consider that it was adapted from a pre.9/11 novel that is New York City to its core.
195;Benioff has written some sequences that made me hold my breath .
196;the man is one of the best writers and slam poets out there.
197;The cinematography is all New York, both gritty and gorgeous, light and more light, and the key characters are all well.
198;Edward Norton gives an underrated award.
199;winning performance, and Brian Cox's supporting work was just as good.
200;Then Spike Lee takes all of this, with his some very good editors, and makes this joint unforgettable.
201;era classic, and one of the finest memorials to a wounded and healing city that any movie director could make.
202;i love Spike Lee's Joints, and this is my favorite so far.
203;I was expecting something a bit more action, a bit more suspense, a bit more convaluted
204;a fine movie, just not what either of us expected .
205;Not to ruin it but the best scene of the entire movie, and that moved me to tears, is a key moment between Ed Norton and Barry Pepper towards the end.
206;Barry Pepper does an absolutley amazing job in this movie.
207;I think Ed Norton is a superb actor but I didn't think he was right for this role.
208;But his dad was great, that was another touching story line.
209;If you're an Ed Norton fan, this is a must.
210;Philip Seymour Hoffman and Barry Pepper were perfectly cast for their roles and Rosario Dawson did a superb job as supporting actress.
211;I was disappointed that Brian Cox didn't have a bigger role, but he played the father part well as usual.
212;There are a lot of underlying issues in the film that you are caught during a second viewing.
213;Everything that he knows in life has become disdainful to him (including religion).
214;The cinematography was quintessential Spike Lee, with some of his trademark shots (such as what is ostensibly a still shot of an individual with a fading background, indicating that this person is moving forward).
215;If you are a Spike Lee fan (which I am) or interested in New York culture, you will find this movie enjoyable.
216;Get it and watch it.
217;At his best, Spike Lee is a great director (Unfortunately, he has a tendecy to shoot himself in the foot with some of his comments and actions.)
218;A great story about the last day of freedom for a guy who wasted his potential with his self.
219;This is Edward Norton's best role and he is supported with a great cast with Rosario Dawson, Brian Cox, Barry Pepper, and the late Philip Seymour Hoffman (I still have a hard time saying that).
220;Probably the best movie about post 9/11 New York.
221;Edward norton is an incredible actor, incredile who also played as the incredible hulk lol no pun intended.
222;this movie takes you on the heavy decesion that edward's character monty has ta take.
223;if you ever lived through any hardships and need inspiration this to me is a great depiction on that.
224;Once I finally got a chance to watch it, I was blown away by how amazing this movie is.
225;It's a new twist on the time.
226;honored man vs. himself theme.
227;Frank's character, as played by Pepper, in particular has a lot of depth and provokes both thought and emotion.
228;You can love your friends without loving their choices, and when their bad choices catch up to them, it's more important to stand by them and offer strength than to say I told you so.
229;The enduring nature of friendship was one of the themes of the movie that I felt was more compelling than the romantic subplot between Monty and Naturelle, or Monty's conflict with the Russian drug dealers.
230;this is a brilliantly understated movie about the ties that bind people together .
231;father/son, friendship, romance, trust, teacher.
232;I don't usually enjoy Spike Lee movies, but I loved this one.
233;For such a simple premise, there's a power in this movie that is undeniable.
234;Spike Lee's self concious stylishness always seems at cross purposes with his subject matter.
235;this was a very good movie!
236;Spike likes his movies to be character driven (a la Do the Right Thing) and this flick certainly fits the bill.
237;Certainly one of Spike Lee`s best movies, 25th Hour focuses the last day of freedom of a condemned drug dealer (Edward Norton).
238;Facing an unpredictable yet decisive moment in his life, Monty decides to spend his last day with his girlfriend and closest friends, and manages to think about the path he is taking.
239;key pace, this movie is a strong and compelling character study that focuses issues like friendship, love, trust, choices in a subtle, poignant and complex way.
240;Lee`s direction is solid as always, and he even approaches the post.11/9 NY events in a memorable and fascinating manner, creating a somber, deep and captivating atmosphere.
241;The acting is stellar, since it combines the talents of Rosario Dawson, Brian Cox, Philip Semour Hoffman, Barry Pepper and Anna Paquin.
242;Add an excellent score (Terence Blanchard), ace photography (Rodrigo Prieto) and you`ve got one of the best movies of 2003.
243;A thoughtful and enticing cinematic experience, 25th Hour avoids easy sappiness and presents a mature and well.
244;All of the things Lee is criticized and raked over the coals for is precisely what makes The 25th Hour such a masterful film.
245;the entire cast felt as though they'd been performing their roles onstage 8 shows a week, so perfect was the ensemble unity.
246;the penultimate scene is visionary, all dressed in white, and bathed in dreamlike light leading into the sobering reality of the finale.
247;a beautiful movie filled with hope.
248;Glorious filmmaking by an American master.
249;Easily the best actor of his generation.
250;he's picking some great parts, and this film is no exception.
251;political film (by his standards), it's still powerful.
252;it also helps that the writer, David Benioff, has worked wonders with the script.
253;Gives an interesting look of a post 9/11 drug dealer in New York on his last day of freedom before going to prison.
254;Edward Norton is supported by some really good character actors like Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Barry Pepper and Rosario Dawson.
255;based with some great scenes with philip seymour hoffman.
256;i felt right there next to him.
257;It's a simple plot but frankly it's a very well made film that addresses 9/11 in a wonderful way .
258;The characters are easy to believe and understand.
259;The shots are well composed with a great score.
260;It's worth watching I think if you don't live in NY and want to understand what life is like for them.
261;all in all, another solid film for Norton you need to add to your Ed Norton library.
262;Ok Spike, you show us they're gone, we've now established when the movies set, after 9/11, great, end it there.
263;There is something about the genuineness of the dialogues which are very compelling.
264;This is true of all of his films, but particularly this one where Edward Norton's character is distressed about being sent to prison.
265;The conversations he has with others, himself and the side conversations about his situation is very moving and thought provoking.
266;Well, Spike Lee did a very nice job in this movie.
267;but the effort is there to boost it.
268;the cast is definitely a positive sign in this movie with Edward Norton and Philip Seymour Hoffman playing their roles perfectly.
269;the movie's about Monty, a guy living in New York with a beautiful girlfriend, nice friends and a sweet dog.
270;The opening sequence shows Monty saving this dog's life in a touching moment.
271;It's all about that but unlike most movies, this movie only shows what's necessary and that is something very rare and I trully appreciate it.
272;The audience is one of his friends too.
273;It's a very sad movie and very powerful movie.
274;The part where he talks to himself in the mirror is one of the most powerful sequences that I have ever seen.
275;everyone plays their role perfectly and the realism of the movie is stunning.
276;The visuals are perfect and the story development is continuous.
277;The ending is touching and this movie remains as one of the most powerful of the last 20 or so years.
278;it's a movie that everyone should see because it has an inner message and is a wonderful critique of our society.
279;edward Norton once again takes a rough role and is stunning.
280;He trully is one of the best actors to watch.25th hour is a success.
281;a powerful, geniously conceived movie that is one tough but true 2 hours.
282;This film is a brief account about the last freedom moments about a dealer who will be sent to prison the next day .
283;He meets with his friends and decides to celebrate his last traces as a free man .
284;lee is very smart director but his approach to tell us a story employing skillyfully all the european taste and sublime expressiveness meant for him one of his most recognized works .
285;bravo for Lee and Edward Norton who gave a top knotch performance.
286;The book was great, and because the movie remained fairly true to the novel, it is of just as high a caliber.
287;Great actors (some pretty famous ones) and a plot that kept me interested from start to finish.
288;Worth the time and the money, especially if you were a fan of the novel.
289;He has one last day to enjoy his freedom.
290;really, the ONLY good things in this movie are the ending and Norton's scene where he rants to himself while looking in the mirror.
291;Spike Lee is yet to make a bad movie, but this is quite possibly the most impressive.
292;This is not only a technically superb movie but also a compelling human story.
293;minute or so part of this movie is the most beautiful and memorable sequence I have seen in years.
294;This is a real gem.
295;This is probably Spike Lee's best movie, and that is saying something.
296;The acting in this movie defies description, it is that good.
297;Hey, I even agreed with the preaching in Spike Lee's earlier movies, but I just felt that with this movie he had made a huge leap, this movie is deep, it will haunt you long after you finish watching it.
298;No one holds the moral highground in this movie, deeply flawed but lovable characters interact in scenes that are so realistic it is scary.
299;Everything you are in you are great, the sniper in Saving Private Ryan, etc.
300;He is likeable but arrogant.
301;He has a mean streak but he also has a big heart that hides under his shark persona, like Monty he is complex, but unlike Monty he never sold death.
302;Hoffman is a bumbling clutz, but he is also intelligent and insightful, with a more balanced view of life than either Monty or Pepper's character has.
303;That is the set up of the characters, on to the plot.
304;The focus of this film is on the relationships between Monty and his two childhood friends, Pepper and Hoffman.
305;They spend Monty's last day of freedom together waiting for the ax to fall.
306;This movie is very, very, very, intense.
307;This is the most powerful movie I have seen in a while, it takes a serious emotional toll on the viewer.
308;This is one of the best movies of recent years, although if you are depressed or get depressed easily I would not recomend it.
309;If the presentation of brooding and anguish is the film's goal, the film is very successful.
310;and both are fantastic and original films, among my favorites.
311;it's true that there is very little going on in `25th Hour', but a lot is happening beneath the surface
312;Lee's approach to this difficult and provocative subject is very real and very personal, and it's clearly from the viewpoint of a real New.Yorker.
313;And even though Norton is supported by a fantastic, first rate cast .
314;it's clearly his show, and he makes the most of it.
315;Norton brings Monty to life as a classic anti.
316;hero, and he's as fascinating a protagonist as the characters he played in Fight Club and American History X. 25th Hour is an atmospheric and intense character study, and Norton's performance makes it perfect.
317;It's a powerful and difficult scene, one of the boldest made in recent years, and by itself it makes the film memorable.25th Hour is poetry
318;It's probably the most atmospheric piece Lee has pulled, but it's a beautiful work, and is well recommended for fans of Lee's and Norton's both.
319;It's an unnerving and unsettling experience, but well worth the admission.
320;An excellent cast led by Edward Norton included Phillip Seymour Hoffman, a perverted high school English teacher, his brother Barry Pepper, a Wall Street hothead, Rosario Dawson, a sympothizing girlfriend, Brian Cox, a proud father, and Anna Paquin, a seductive teenage English student.
321;All of the characters in this film were round and believable.
322;A strange and disquieting film more than an interesting one.
323;So the whole film is a dream, the dream about the last day before going to prison during which the ex.
324;Plus the father who is summoned into the film before that big event.
325;up hero in the passenger's seat of his father's car being driven by his own father to his prison, the dream of an escape, like in The Last Temptation of Christ: go west, disappear, change identity, bring your girl friend and raise a family.
326;i highly recommend this reflective movie to all.
327;Edward Norton plays a thoroughly decent, likable fellow who makes his living on the wrong side of the tracks dealing drugs.
328;It explores how his going up affects the lives of his two best friends, his father, and his girlfriend.
329;The movie reminded me a great deal of Meet Joe Black.
330;The audio however is among the best I have ever heard.
331;Spike Lee is a director that it took me a while to watch.
332;Call it the prejudices of growing up in a southern right wing Christian family, but I always got the impression that he was a racist black man blaming all the black race's social ailments on the white man.
333;Finally, I decided to educate myself on Lee's films, and started with the amazing social commentary of Do the Right Thing.
334;Lee does a great job at presenting the struggles of life in a big city, and as always in a Lee movie the big city is a living breathing character in and of itself.
335;Featuring Golden Globe and Oscar nominated talent such as Philip Seymour Hoffman, Anna Paquin, and Brian Cox, as well as other notable actors like Rosario Dawson and Barry Pepper you expect nothing but the best.
336;For the most part the movie flows perfectly, but the flashbacks, while serving to build up the characters, don't help the narrative flow properly.
337;Does she really love me?
338;all the characters are so rich.
339;Through Monty's memories we see detail of characters.
340;And through their dialogue with each other we see their own internal conflicts.
341;Even the few minutes spent on the top Russian Mobster shows him with a history and understanding on the world and prison.
342;Own up to what you've done.
343;these are the natural thoughts anybody would have in this situation and I commend Benioff for being this real.
344;i must commend Spike Lee for presenting this so beautifully, and the remarkable, tasteful use of Ground Zero as a backdrop done in a way that only a New Yorker could.
345;This really might be the best film Lee has made.
346;Its beautiful the way it is.
347;This film does take place in just one day, and it's a perfect snapshot of the lead protagonist Monty Brogan's thoughts and actions in that final day before he begins a 7 year jail sentence for dealing heroin, expertly put together by David Benioff and Spike Lee.
348;And so do Monty's friends, not preventing him from his choice to deal drugs.
349;He's easy to relate to, and it's a reminder of how anyone can turn out depending on what choices they make.
350;Benioff and Lee were keen to show his actions like this.
351;the film is skillfully made, from the very tasteful opening credit scene acknowledging 9/11 (another honest feature about the film, which is an important theme throughout), where we see the lights at ground zero dropping from the sky, to the fantasy scene with Monty and his father in the car near the end, where they think about the family he could have had, all surreally dressed in while.
352;Terence Blanchard's score too is one of the most beautiful I've heard in a recent film along with Michael Andrews score forDonnie Darko .
353;The film tells it like it is.
354;It's about decision making, it's about responsibility and it's about real friendship.
355;It's realistic on an emotional level and is now one of my favorite Spike Lee Joints.
356;We see how he relates to his girlfriend on his last day of freedom, as well as what his relationships are like with his best friends, and what they think of him.
357;Throughout the movie, Monty is re.
358;this movie also is the first one that I have seen that addresses a post.
359;The opening credit montage has some fairly mournful music that both sets the tone for the movie as well as touching upon the terrorist attacks.
360;The blue lights that we see are the spotlights that shine in the New York skyline in place of the towers.
361;There are also small touches throughout the movie about post 9/11 New York.
362;It is a beautifully written, if vulgar, speech.
363;this is an excellent movie (excellence in filmmaking), but it is not a great one.
364;I would recommend this movie to fans of Spike Lee and drama, in general, but I would not recommend this movie without reservations.
365;The 25th Hour is the best movie I've seen all year.
366;I'm sure you're at least familiar with the plot, so I'll talk about the performances.
367;Edward Norton, one of the most talented young actors of our day, gives a performance that should be remembered as one of his two best to date (the other being American History X).
368;The movie is his last day of freedom.
369;It shows his fruitless attempts to relax and enjoy his last night of freedom with his friends.
370;He is one of the most tragic characters in recent years.
371;every character plays their part to perfection, Philip Seymour Hoffman in particular.
372;He is fast becoming one of my favorites, and is perfect as the very socially inept high school teacher.
373;Barry Pepper, another favorite actor of mine since 'Saving Private Ryan', is amazing.
374;But the true star here is Edward Norton.
375;You can see, in every moment Monty has to himself, the internal debate as to whether he should go willingly to jail or run.
376;Movie jumps from scene to scene.
377;So take my review for what it is worth.
378;But I'm left with the reality that this is the best film I've ever seen.
379;better than Casablanca 
380;The script itself may lose out to China Town , but it is the story that serves as the foundation, the enabler, for such a wonderful film.
381;Granted, the acting is extraordinary.
382;But it is the whole package here that will not let this film leave your mind.
383;That's what I keep saying to myself.
384;In the interest of full disclosure, I'm a big Spike Lee fan.
385;But this is his best BY FAR.
386;It vastly exceeds his other two best .
387;This could have been a great movie about a drug dealer who gets caught and has to find out who set him up.
388;existent, and it should be that way.
389;on top of that, Spike Lee created an open movie, instead of his previous and most famous movies dealing with close subjects, which, for me, was a great development.
390;All characters have lots of time on screen, creating very well.
391;Now maybe I haven't acquired a taste for Spike Lee and you have to understand him in order to enjoy this movie.
392;I believe that directing style is an art, and everyone will just not see something through the artist's eyes.
393;there were touching moments in the movie.
394;Edward Norton's connection to his best friends is strong, and the last moments that they share together prove not to be moments where your friend can fill you with thoughtful speeches, but moments of pain, where friends honestly don't know what more they can do for you.
395;I was actually very excited about watching this movie.
396;The cast was perfect for his character's support.
397;A fine job was done by all.
398;25th hour was an excellent movie.
399;The acting was tremendous (as with most Edward Norton films).
400;It had every feature a good movie requires.
401;There is a girl involved who is the leading question of who ratted on Monty.
402;The whole movie is suspensful and entertaining, not a dull moment.
403;Shot a couple of months after 9/11, Spike Lee's 25th Hour focuses on Montgomery Brogan's last night of freedom before he goes to jail for 7 years for dealing drugs.
404;25th Hour has an intriguing premise, and is executed in an expert, evocative fashion by Lee.
405;This is actually two strong movies in one .
406;a person's last night of freedom before going to jail, but also, a study of a community living with the aftermath of having their home attacked by terrorists.
407;The score by Terrance Blanchard is one of the best I've ever heard in a movie .
408;simply beautiful and brutally powerful.
409;This is an emotionally charged movie that is suspenseful, humorous, and beautiful .
410;qualities that rarely come together quite as well as they do in Spike Lee movies.
411;I recommend it to everyone I know.
412;Lee does it in such a way that anxiety and stress is unavoidable, which certainly gets the audience's attention on what is at stake and why it is at stake.
413;At the end, Lee will make the audience see what he wants them to see while leaving everything to our imagination with brilliant touch.
414;I was excited to watch this movie.
415;I love Ed Norton and there was a great cast, all with fine acting creds.
416;Spike Lee always puts pushing an ideological agenda ahead of filming a good story.
417;But it's only effective if the film itself is good and the ideology actually fits in with the plot.
418;When the movie first started I was very emotional to see the two lights replacing the Twin Towers .
419;What I liked the most about the movie was when Monty had the dialogue with himself in front of the mirror.
420;It's true there were FU's but there is a powerful message in those swearings I believe.
421;When in Rome do as Romans do (and I'll add this myself) and love Romans too .
422;th hour Romans are Americans!
423;appreciation, that's what is needed from people Monty is mad at.
424;it hits you that the movie is just simply great.
425;The other character's stories are briefly told and it works out beautifully because the movie spends just the right amount of time on each one.
426;All characters pretty much played their part to the max.
427;Its not incredibly unique but it has some good elements.
428;What makes this movie great is its ending.
429;Also, the relationship Monty has with everyone surrounding him is excellent.
430;It deeply shows the feelings he has for each.
431;overall, its a pretty good movie.
432;The plot of 25th Hour is simple and wonderful.
433;He's sorry he got caught.
434;He's sorry he has to give up a life he likes.
435;The argument is there, and it is poignant.
436;the performances and the diection of this film are teriffic.
437;Norton, always strong, is even stronger.
438;Barry Pepper and Phillip Seymor Hoffman are both outstanding in their roles.
439;Lee's always made strong films, but this film didn't remind me of his other work.
440;one last note, the opening credit sequence of this film is one of the most haunting images I have ever seen.
441;Honestly, I'm not sure what it has to do with the rest of the film, but it is the first time I have seen a filmmaker make it a point.
442;David Benioff delivered a great script and Spike Lee and crew delivered a great film.
443;Poignant, warm, serious, absorbing, plus the eye popping visual shots Spike Lee brings to the screen, simply put, was brilliant.
444;Ed Norton, is certainly spectacular.
445;very much enjoyed because this is one movie, I couldn't figure out right to the end.
446;norton does a great job of portraying this character as a nice guy with some flaws.
447;He clearly loves his girlfriend, and he wants to start a family with her.
448;He also loves his father, and he'd do anything to help him.
449;he is who he is, and this is how he's spending his last 24 hours of freedom.
450;rosario Dawson is also great as Monty's girlfriend, Naturel.
451;She's worried about how Monty's acting, yet still ambiguous enough that we suspect she might have something to do with his arrest.
452;He's very friendly toward Naturel, yet he blames her for taking advantage of the money Monty's lifestyle provided even though they all knew it was dangerous for him.
453;It's always unclear which of these people is the true Francis.
454;he knows that these 24 hours are important.
455;but what is more important is that the rest of his life will be determined by what happens in that 25th hour.
456;The first impression that he makes in prison will determine whether he will survive his sentance.
457;looking guy, and good looking guys often have a hard time in prison.
458;One small moment between Hoffman's character and his student will affect the future of his entire career.
459;Monty's good looks could endanger the rest of his life.
460;He says saving the dog is one of the best things I've ever done.
461;every day he has for the rest of his life is because of me.
462;Chance and choice work together to determine destiny, and how you act and react even in small situations will affect the rest of your life.
463;That is the genius of this film, and why it is well worth seeing.
464;Edward Norton stars in this role and brings all his excellent acting talents to the task of taking a long last look at the New York City he loves as well as the important people in his life.
465;There's his girlfriend, played by Rosario Dawson, who just might be the person who betrayed him to the cops.
466;There are his two best friends, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Barry Pepper, who know that their friend will never be the same again.
467;Add a couple of Russian gangsters to this mix, as well as a precocious teenager, played by Anna Paquin, whose seductiveness tempts Philip Seymour Hoffman into making an unwise decision, and the scene is set for an intriguing, fast.
468;i liked the theme, which was about being responsible for the consequences of your actions, and I liked Spike Lee's interpretation of it.
469;I especially liked some of his film techniques.
470;This adds to the interest and the edginess of the film.
471;the story is easy to relate to.
472;The acting is the finest that the film industry has to offer.
473;And there's a director who has his own personal style of bringing it all to life.
474;Again, the acting was very good.
475;Edward Norton gives a fine performance as Monty, a drug dealer planning to serve a seven year sentence.
476;There is, for example, a scene in which two of Monty's friends (played by Barry Pepper and Philip Seymour Hoffman, who are also excellent) look down from a high rise apartment at an eerie nighttime scene of the Trade Center site.
477;This is very similar to a scene in Spike Lee's earlier (and probably best) film, Do The Right Thing.
478;That said, 25th Hour works very well on some levels.
479;He is sympathetic, but also clearly responsible for his own predicament.
480;The relationship he has with his two best friends, one a cocky stockbroker (Pepper), the other a nerdy teacher (Hoffman) with a crush on one of his students is interesting and complex.
481;The film also maintains a compelling tone and we are kept wondering until the very end what Monty's fate will be.
482;25th Hour showcases both Lee's considerable talents and foibles as a director.
483;25th Hour is a film that gives a poignant reality of the What might have beens of a drug dealer's life.
484;the stars all carry strong parts and do it well under Spike Lee's exquisite direction.
485;Monty was once king of Manhattan, and now he has to say good.
486;Monty is basically a good man, has a good heart, he saves an injured dog and names him Doyle, he is kind to his father, and helps others.
487;He is constantly mumbling how drugs hurt other people's lives, but never confronted Monty as they are growing up and making life's decisions.
488;monty's last day is capped by a good.
489;the movie is full of life, yet haunting and sad.
490;It grabs your attention from the first scenes and keeps pace with beautiful cinematography and a fantastic ensemble cast.
491;Spike Lee's film of Michael Benioff's novel 25th Hour is one of the strongest of the neo.
492;Monty's life until this point has been a dream
493;I'd love to see him and Johnny Depp in a film .
494;making Monty a rich character who understands his own self.
495;Barry Pepper and the ever wonderful Phillip Hoffman play Monty's more conventional friends, Slattery and Alinsky, the former a Wall.
496;Rosanna Dawson plays Monty's woman with understated power and sorrow.
497;the rant that Monty gives to his reflection is right out of David Benioff's book, nearly word.
498;word, so stop blaming Spike Lee, and besides it's a great set piece, expressing Monty's self.
499;force with all the people Monty cursed waving good.
500;bye to him as he leaves New York, one of the most wonderful cinematic poems I've seen.
501;again, the flight of fantasy at the end of the film is right out of Benioff's book and not something Spike Lee made up, although Lee often extends the ends of his films (see Mo' Better Blues and Clockers), so Benioff's novel was right in keeping with Lee's style.
502;this is one of Spike Lee's best films, and it was totally disregarded at the box office, probably people want to pigeonhole Lee.
503;But like all great artists, Spike Lee can transcend himself.
504;I believe 25th Hour will be remembered as a great American film in the years to come.
505;emphasizing 9/11, making Monty's father a fireman .
506;A superb cast (and brilliant performances) greatly benefit 25th Hour, Spike Lee's latest directorial effort.
507;There's peace to be made with his father (Brian Cox), who runs a fine Irish bar catering to firefighters.
508;in girlfriend, Naturelle, whose street smarts and supple beauty hint at betrayal?Adapted by screenwriter David Benioff from his novel that was written before 9/11, the film brilliantly uses this transition in Monty's life as a powerful metaphor for the changes we all went through after that terrible Tuesday in September.
509;Shades of September 11 are everywhere, including the memorable scene in Frank's apartment where we get a clear view of the trgedy's aftermath.
510;There is also the brilliant sequence where Monty looks in the mirror of a restroom and spits out a litany of hate for every group he can think of in New York.
511;Perhaps the film's main flaw is that it goes on a good 20 minutes too long, but it manages to pack a wallop nonetheless, for a truly memorable experience.
512;The 25th Hour is really two movies awkwardly pasted together: one is a gritty street fable about trust and loyalty, the other is a sensitive portrait of post.9/11 New York.
513;luckily, everyone in the cast has enough skill to make up for the aspects that Lee abandoned.
514;His girlfriend Naturelle, played by Rosario Dawson, is a sweet Puerto Rican girl whom Monty's friends blame for his arrest.
515;This is a potentially interesting storyline that doesn't really go anywhere.
516;this is the first Spike Lee film I have ever seen, but already I feel like he gives his agenda more screen time than his characters.
517;25th Hour is probably Spike Lee's best film since Do The Right Thing.
518;key, letting the power of the story speak for itself until the inevitable Spike Lee Moment.
519;and largely avoiding his favorite themes.
520;norton is one of the strongest conflicted.
521;wimp leads out there right now, and he manages to hold our attention in every frame in the same mysterious way that he usually does.
522;compatible best friends, and lovely Rosario Dawson breaks our hearts several times over as the did.
523;the ending, taken almost directly from the book, is especially powerful and will be on your mind for days.
524;This is a very effective film, and easily one of the best of 2002.
525;I love this movie, it has great acting and great story line.
526;But this Ed Norton is unique, and he chooses scripts that tell an important story.
527;He is, in my view, one of the finest young actors to come along since Sidney Portier.
528;His lovely lady (the seductive Rosario Dawson)loves him and so do his buddies.
529;Norton knows how to use facial expressions to fill up entire scenes, and has the smarts to know when to pull back from a scene and let the environment do the talking.
530;great movies are difficult to describe because they transcend words.
531;seeing spike lee's name associated with this film gave me reservation, but with so many talented actors i had to give it a try.
532;the rich good looking playboy whose life is miserably empty and the dumpy, geeky intellectual who lusts after an underage student of his.
533;this should have been a really good movie, but spike lee directed it.
534;his friends, critical of Monty, imperfect themselves but rich characters anyway gives the whole last night a tone of debate and self.
535;as a movie lover, I must tell you I left the theater enchanted by the fresh view of life this film builds to offer, I even saw a bit of Capra in it.
536;with a great cast of actors and people telling me how great this movie was, I think I just came in expecting to much.
537;Intelligent and superbly acted film.
538;Edward Norton is fantastic as usual.
539;This film is highly recommended to those who love a really good movie that lingers in your memory for years.
540;Keeps you on the edge of your seat!
541;25th Hour, his newest film is in the former category.
542;nice touch) mind as well what is actually happening in his physical world: his relationship with his girlfriend, Naturelle (Rosario Dawson), his father (Brian Cox) and his two close friends Frank (Barry Pepper) and Jakob (Phillip Seymour Hoffman).
543;edward Norton tries his best to make us care and in a way we do, for Norton can, like almost no other actor working today, elicit a positive response: he is stalwart and tough and yet extremely sensitive but ultimately self.
544;absorbed as Monty and we can't help but empathize with him.
545;the physical production is gorgeous, though from Rodrigo Prieto's images of NYC and Brooklyn to Terence Blanchard's evocative music.
546;spike Lee has given us several of the most accomplished and wonderful films ever committed to celluloid: think Malcolm X or Do the Right Thing.
547;Being a fan of Spike, I can honestly say that 25th hour is one of his best films in his career and is an underrated piece of cinema that deserves more notice.
548;this movie is good on so many levels and it leaves you in suspense all the way threw it.
549;so hes going to prison and he has to make amends and bond with friends for the remaining time.
550;It's just a great spike lee movie and you have to apprecaite the way he does this, bringing in the footage of ground zero in new york.
551;Norton and Barry Pepper give the best performances in here, especially when Norton wants Pepper to beat him up before he goes into the prison for 7 years, and that scene is filled with so much power and emotion I thought it was the powerfulest moment in the picture.
552;Watchable, even enjoyable film from Spike Lee if you don't mind another sympathetic portrayal of a drug.
553;So the heroin dealer theme both attracted and repulsed.
554;Barry Pepper, in a role that brings some much.
555;The lovely Rosario Dawson is his girlfriend.
556;What happens doesn't much matter, it's the performances that make it worthwhile.
557;After hearing all the rave reviews and finding that a lot of great actors appeared in this film, I had some high hopes.
558;I was expecting a great movie.
559;I thought it was a decent movie, but it had the chance to be much more than it was.
560;The basic storyline behind 25th Hour centers around a man named Monty.
561;now, that all sounds like a great idea and a great concept for a movie.
562;Edward Norton does a great job in the movie, although it is nothing we haven't seen in the past.
563;And there are other players in the film you will also recognize as well.
564;All pretty good for the most part.
565;And the movie has some interesting moments as well.
566;Some of the extras included are commentaries, a tribute to Ground Zero, and a featurette on Spike Lee.
567;25th Hour is a good movie
568;This is my first Spike Lee film, but I'm willing to bet that he has better films than this one.
569;however, the surprising ending that the viewer suddenly faces after the feelings and emotion prior to the moment creates an amazing contrast which can only be describes as beautiful film making.
570;He spends his last free day with his friends and family, examining his past and the reasons that he took the path that he did, trying not to think too deeply about his impending fate.
571;25th Hour is based on a book by David Benioff, who also wrote the film's screenplay.
572;The story and characters are interesting.
573;some fine actors give admirable performances in 25th Hour.
574;Philip Seymour Hoffman is a great talent.
575;Former Baltimore Raven Tony Siragusa is thoroughly convincing in a small role as a Russian mobster.
576;i give 25th Hour a marginal recommendation because there is some interesting and thought.
577;provoking material in it, if you can get past its self.
578;The story line was really good though and I enjoyed it.
579;it is a Spike Lee film.
580;The basic premise was intriguing and there were interesting moments throughout.
581;The basic premise seems simple enough .
582;but it's the small nuances in the plot, the performances, direction and look of the film that make it so worthwhile.
583;happy movie where Monty merely realises his wrongs and accepts his punishment
584;edward Norton gives his best performance since his tour de force in American History X, which will surely come as a relief to fans who saw him so underused in box office success Red Dragon.
585;He really makes you believe that he is a man with emotional scars, a dealer whose life has caught up with him and he realises it instinctively before it's there.
586;This is a much more exuberant role than her restrained yet still equally impressive performance as Rogue in the X. men movies.
587;a lot has been made of the fact that The 25th Hour is the first movie to really deal with a New York post.
588;This worried me significantly prior to seeing it mainly due to a concern that it may handle a sensitive subject in a fashion that may offend it audience.
589;In many ways this is a hauntingly beautiful look at an America that seems all but broken, where any glimmers of hope seem unrealistic and fragile.
590;The 25th Hour always has anger bubbling under its surface, that explodes fairly early in the movie with Monty's diatribe against minority groups, an assault that is actually aimed at himself and something that deserves a piece of classic movie history.
591;Understandably this is a controversial movie and it's easy to see why given its subject, but it's also dazzlingly brilliant in places and even now remains my favourite film of the year.
592;I felt as though I lived through it with each one of the characters.
593;Shortly: 25th hour hit me.
594;It is a beautiful, dark but same time hopeful drama.
595;Terence Blanchard's music makes it even better.
596;even after seeing it five times the movie gives me sense of good feeling and surely a lots of thinking.
597;I recommend this movie everybody but for any person who hear beats a beat of Manhattan .
598;the script itself is fine, and in the hands of a competent director, probably would've been an above average movie, if not great.
599;25th Hour is a true poem about America and New York after the Sept. 11 attacks of 2001.
600;Throw all of that aside, and this is a great movie.
601;Every performance, minus that of the wasted Rosario Dawson, is incredible.
602;Brian Cox cemented himself in my mind as one of the finest actors in the world.
603;spike Lee is up to his usual camera tricks, and its great when you recognize them.
604;On a side note, you should check out bamboozled, another fabulous societal movie, which recieved about the same welcome as this film.
605;the score is awesome, the camera phenomenal.
606;the top movie with City of God for this year.
607;it's also a hoot to watch the film with director commentary.
608;spike Lee and his inimitable self.
609;the great rodrigo lopez, the excellent so.
610;I saw 25th Hour, starring Edward Norton, last week, and I sooooo enjoyed it.
611;visits his old school, has dinner with his father (a wonderful turn by Brian Cox), and goes out one last time with his two best friends (played beautifully by Philip Seymour Hoffman and Barry Pepper) and his girlfriend (Rosario Dawson).
612;it seems ordinary enough, but every interaction is imbued with meaning because all involved realize what's on the other side of the evening .
613;Norton is marvelous in this.
614;But for a movie about a drug dealer, I can understand it.
615;Watch this movie for the performances.
616;getting way) and just tells a story.
617;Norton and Pepper are superb, Hoffman and Dawson great and everyone else very good as well.
618;Maybe, but it's riveting just the same.
619;Worth checking out more than once!
620;I've introduced many of my friends to this movie who enjoyed it as much as I do.
621;It seems like no one has heard of this movie but it's my personal favorite from Spike Lee.
622;I had never heard of the movie, but I like Edward Norton, so I bought it.
623;I was very happy with the movie.
624;All of Spike Lees movies are worth seeing.
625;I think this is, in many respects, a beautiful movie.
626;The things I do like are really good.
627;And I think it's worth watching.
628;Norton is good in it.
629;He's got a lot of other actors in there who do a good job.
630;On the edge of my seat from beginning to closing credits.
631;the characterization, narrative arc and music all come together in this wonderful multi.
632;layered film directed by Spike Lee.
633;It is one of the most incredible films Ive ever seen, regardless of how you think it ends.
634;Spike Lee's latest, 25th Hour is a 5.
635;Focusing on drug dealer Monty's last day of freedom before going to prison, the film carefully weaves in background stories from his past and that of his girlfriend and two best guy friends from childhood.
636;There's a beautifully acted bathroom scene, a soliloquy in which Monty pours out his heart to his own image in the mirror .
637;For me, the mark of a good movie is one in which every character undergoes some significant, if small, change .
638;You'd never imagined feeling sorry for a drug dealer, but Ed Norton does such an excellent job.
639;The whole cast was amazing.
640;It is one you just have to see.
641;The music in the movie was also amazing.
642;Definatley a must see movie.
643;Spike Lee has some great gifts as a film maker.
644;One is his ability to create chracters the audience can identify with and the other is to make the setting a character unto itself.
645;Lee makes full use of this, showing how one city can play a big role in people's lives.
646;The film takes place on the final day before he is to serve his sentence and flashes back to the moments that led to his fate.
647;There is a brilliantly directed, much discussed scene where Norton is cursing the people of NYC, his friends, then finally himself as he stares at a reflection in a mirror.
648;This is one of the single greatest scenes that define a character within a film.
649;this film has a brilliant script that focuses heavily not only on Norton, but two of his contrasting friends, played brilliantly by Barry Pepper and Phillip Seymour Hoffman.
650;Pepper is a sly Wall Street man who tries to be slick and even has an equation for his likelihood of success with women.
651;He serves as a counterbalance to Pepper.
652;The way these two characters discuss themselves and their friend help define 25th Hour as a beautiful character piece.
653;old male, like myself, I found this movie to have all the right elements.
654;He spends his last day of freedom talking to his father (Brian Cox) and setting up a shindig so that he can see his girlfriend Naturelle (the very sexy Rosario Dawson), and his two best friends Jacob and Frank (Philip Seymour Hoffman, Barry Pepper) one last time.
655;As a celebration he has all of them meet at a nightclub that he used to regularly attend so that they can enjoy his final night as a free man.
656;the movie is at it's best when these two are on.
657;Not only are their characters both hilarious, but I love how their personalities offset each other.
658;The character Monty is much more believable thanks to these two.
659;especially the gliding effect Spike Lee uses with Anna Paquin and Philip Seymour Hoffman and the surreal, psychedelic feeling that it creates.
660;Seriously, this is probably one of my favorite scenes of any movie.
661;i bought this movie after only one viewing and enjoyed it even more the second time around.
662;Be sure to check it out!
663;25th hour is a fantastic meld of a fictional but realistic story set amidst a background of factual events.
664;the cast here is fantastic.
665;Edward Norton is his usual brilliant self, with Brian Cox, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Anna Paquin, Rosario Dawson and Berry Pepper filling out supporting roles of people close to Montgomery.
666;There's a fantastic chemistry here that helps to propel the story forward without feeling like the characters are forcing it along.
667;The music is another great accompaniment, telling of the sadness of the characters and city at this time without being too forceful of a presence.
668;Nothing is overdone here, but wonderfully realistic and absorbing.25th Hour gets a high recommendation from me.
669;Director Spike Lee turned out a powerful story that simultaneously deals with the sorrow of a city and the troubles of a small group of friends.
670;I was literally stunned by this movie and strongly recommend it.
671;this is the work of a master film maker.
672;And there's nothing left really to keep you entertained.
673;25th Hour, directed by Spike Lee (2002), is a poignant and engaging drama.
674;He is young and handsome.
675;but the story line lets the principal villain off the hook, in my view.
676;Montgomery is a good citizen, in my assessment.
677;He is loved by his family and friends.
678;He has mostly warm and positive relations with all with whom he deals, including both suppliers and customers from his drug trading days.
679;Norton is a brilliant actor, turning everything he touches at least to fool's gold
680;This is easily Spike Lee's best film since 1989.
681;The other main subplot going through the film is Jakob's obsession with one of his students, Mary d'Annunzio (Anna Paquin, sporting some of the most finely.
682;Other characters move through the film at times, including Brogan's wife (Men in Black II's Rosario Dawson) and father (Brian Cox, the finest casting move made in the film.
683;the film is chock full of beautiful scenes.
684;Those with Norton and Cox are probably the best in the film
685;Other great pieces of dialogue float throughout.
686;And very well should have been.
687;Terence Blanchard's haunting score may be his finest since 1994's The Inkwell, and those who loved Do the Right Thing will have fond memories raised by a certain hate.
688;(One of the final scenes in the film recalls this rant, and it is a powerful piece of filmmaking, to be sure.)
689;inspiring talent on a fairly regular basis
690;This movie is perfection in so far as acting, camera work, sound track use and directing go.
691;If your life has ever taken you to places many don't go, you'll probably love (and get)it.
692;Best NEW movie I've seen this year.25th Hour
693;I saw this film yesterday on Encore and I will say this was a pretty decent film and Edward Norton showed a great Performance as a Drug Dealer who should have stopped along time ago(doing what he does I mean.
694;Spike Lee's 25th Hour is a monumental accomplishment that catapults the filmmaker right back into the pantheon of outstanding American directors.
695;With his past few films, Lee .
696;who seemed so cutting edge and promising a filmmaker a decade or so back .
697;But with 25th Hour, the master has returned to form, fashioning a brilliant and thought.
698;montgomery Brogan is a good looking, generally pleasant.
699;Monty's offense is, indeed, a serious one .
700;The fourth member of the party is Monty's girlfriend, Naturelle, a woman deeply in love with the condemned man, who wishes he had gone straight before all this happened, yet who, during all the time she was with him, was not averse to enjoying what Monty's ill.
701;As the most noble person of the group, even Jakob, the schoolteacher, is confronted with having to make that choice and take that stand.
702;It is a remarkably melancholy film, sad to the core, and Lee's beautifully controlled direction brings out that sadness.
703;His style perfectly complements the mood he is endeavoring to create.
704;The dialogue is so rich and evocative that Lee doesn't feel the need to intervene at every moment to remind us he is there.
705;In fact, 25th Hour is one of the most honest films to have come down the pike in a long long time.
706;There is a particularly remarkable scene in which Jakob and Frank discuss Monty's fate while sitting in front of Frank's apartment window .
707;It is a stunning moment in a film filled with stunning moments.
708;adding to the elegiac tone are Terence Blanchard's moody score and Rodrigo Prieto and Joe Williams' marvelously rich and beautiful cinematography, both of which reflect the contemplative nature of the characters on screen.
709;That is, however, a minor quibble in a film as towering in effect and achievement as this one.
710;lee has gathered a brilliant ensemble cast to help flesh out his very real, very complex characters.
711;The superb Edward Norton demonstrates once again why he is in the forefront of the world's great film actors.
712;Norton conveys the innate goodness and charm of a man who is about to embark on a phase of his life for which he alone bears responsibility.
713;up work as Monty's faithful pals, and Rosario Dawson shines with confident dignity as Monty's stalwart true love.
714;All four contribute immensely to the verisimilitude of the piece.
715;25 Hours shows Spike Lee at the very peak of his form, a true master of his medium.
716;This latest work is not merely one of the very best films of 2002, but one of the very best works this gifted artist has yet provided us.
717;And his close friends are a bit on the weird side as well.
718;25th Hour is one of the best films of 2002 yet it was somewhat underrated and overlooked.
719;It is moody, powerful, and thoughtful.
720;As the first film made in New York after September 11, the destruction and mourning caused by the attacks is very present in the film.
721;25th Hour has a powerful voice that speaks to everyone.
722;The cast gives great performances with characters the audience can relate to.
723;Rosario Dawson gives a mature and believable performance as Norton's girlfriend.
724;This film will make you reflect on your own life and the world we live in.
725;Though often branded and criticized for outrageuously stupid reasons, Spike Lee has once again demonstrated that he is top notch director, sort of the African American version of Standley Kubrick in that it perhaps takes more than what the standard moviegoer is willing to do to understand what he or she is seeing, the story that is unfolding and be interested in the characters enough to keep on watching that screen.
726;There are some points in which the film tends to lag, however the dialog is crisp and smartly written.
727;edward Norton is entrenched in this kind of character .
728;He rubs his pretty boy face, pretty certain he'll be raped or killed.
729;Monty gathers two old friends, one a Jewish literature teacher, Jacob, (Phillip Seymour Hoffman), the other a hopped.
730;up stockbroker, Francis, (Barry Pepper) for a night of reconciliation, celebration.
731;Jacob, the English teacher, is more intrigued by a student (Anna Paquin) who joins Monty's party at the club.
732;The 25th Hour is, then, a jack.
733;the centerpiece of the film, it's a angry treatise on the disgust of New York that also doubles as its charms
734;Bottle this scene up and you've got a perfect movie.
735;but The 25th Hour ends on a provocative note that explores a choice that has been in front of Monty all along.
736;And Norton sells it, in one of his best performances.
737;In 25TH HOUR Spike Lee presents a masterpiece starring Edward Norton.
738;Scenes of the World Trade Towers light tribute appears at the beginning and the political voyage continues from there.
739;The audience can feel how this one moment in history has been engrained into the consciousness of the people living in New York City.
740;edward Norton provides another spectular performance in 25TH HOUR and is quickly proving himself in Hollywood.
741;This is a very enjoyable film that leaves you hanging at the end.
742;Go see the movie and come up with your own opinion.
743;great acting by all actors, great story, lovely cinematography.
744;despite the few sops made from the book to Hollywood story lines (an over emphasis on did the girlfriend betray the lead character now destined for 7 years in jail and the resultant conversion of the ending), there is much to admire in the movie especially in tracking the story mix of the course of the lead actor Ed Norton's last day of freedom and the flashbacks needed to explain why matters have turned out as they have.
745;The film makes great use of long set up fixed shots where the book's core themes of friendships and personal loyalties under pressure are endlesssly explored, with most dramatic effect in two scenes from an apartment overlooking the cleared World Trade Centre site and in a bar scene before the party moves on to a dance club.
746;The film is set in a very short space of time and it wraps you up in the plot and makes you feel sorry for someone who ultimately dealt drugs.
747;The cast is amazing and very realistic I thought.
748;The best film I've seen in a long time.
749;This spike lee joint is one of the first films to confront 9/11 without beating it to death.
750;The writing is brilliant and edward norton's casting was supperb.
751;By the time Spike Lee made this film he really knew a lot about how to make a film.
752;shame then, because this film offers some truly great performances, namely, Edward Norton delivering in his usual superb style, and everybody else in the film following that suit in close distance.
753;The 25th hour is a must see, set in New York the 25th hour has taboos that will tug at naughty preverse of ones own mind.
754;No other shows Rosario Dawson like Spike Lee and his directing is superb.
755;Allthough many may find this movie unsettling, I feel if you watch it with an open mind you will see that its probably one of the greatest movies from 1990 on.
756;A perfect cast, a simple story bringing out complex emotions, both in the characters and the viewers, originality, creativity, a gem of a scenario and the right tone throughout.
757;Such simple, crafted work deserves Oscar attention.
758;I am an Edward Norton fan anyway, but this movie is easily one of my favorites.
759;If you like Edward Norton, love,suspense and action you will appreciate this movie.
760;It's entertaining, and has a message which becomes clear at the end like most films Lee has made.
761;Edward Norton, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, and Barry Pepper are all very good.
762;If you think you're that kind of person, sit through it, try it out, and enjoy.
763;Poignant, realistic and highly dramatic, 25th Hour ranks with the best films ever shot in Manhattan.
764;handed style to the fore, complimenting stellar performances by Norton, Pepper, Hoffman and Cox.
765;The fact that Lee delivers such compelling drama with so little plot is a testament to the director's prowess and the actors' talents.
766;The final 25th Hour sequence is breathtaking.
767;25th Hour is compelling and cathartic.
768;Spike Lee's films have always been very hit or miss for me, I loved Do the Right Thing and He Got Game, but found Summer of Sam absolutely abysmal.
769;The result is a surprisingly touching and sympathetic view of the mistakes of one life.
770;the ensemble cast do a great job showing the ways, both large and small, directly and indirectly, that they are affected by the events in Monty's life, and how we are all in some way or another interconnected, whether we realize it or not.25th Hour also features a very noticeable and moody musical score which really conveys the themes and feelings that are presented throughout.
771;This movie is a great hidden gem
772;He's a charming young man who had always dreamed of being a fireman, following in the working.
773;Frank Slattery is a bond trader, one of the best and most successful risk takers in a very risky business.
774;The three young men enjoy the night into the early morning as they eat, drink, and visit the hottest spots in town.
775;A shocking ending, brilliant and disturbing story.
776;This movie about real people and real life.
777;it is NY as it is.
778;Edward Norton is so good in this film.
779;I found it hard to care about Norton's character, and at times I even forgot about him.
780;There are seperate story lines which portray the immoral acts of some of the characters.
781;25th Hour has some enjoyable elements, and works in a special way.
782;Naturally he reflects on what might have been, and also questions his friendships.
783;worth seeing, even if it is rather depressing at times.
784;For a drama, it never really gets slow, and the message is delivered full force through superb acting and directing.
785;The acting is superb with Norton and cast running with the script and to his credit Spike Lee helping to get these three dimensional performances.
786;There are a few moments of United States nationalism which may not play well to some but it's heartfelt, not manipulative.
787;Perhaps a fair critisim but within this story in this film the critisim speaks more of some viewer's dislike for the director.
788;As a character study 25th Hour is a success.
789;It is a nice coda to the film's story and a excellent ending as well.
790;This movie is amazing, and what's more amazing is that Spike Lee got Disney to make it.
791;The movie is really an allegory for the choice America must face: return to its idealistic roots, or enter a police state of violence and retribution.
792;The vocabulary of film does not employ allegory often, but in this instance, the allegory works precisely as a one.
793;It was a great movie that exceeded my expectations.
794;It also played tribute to New York City.
795;It is a very refreshing movie compared to what is out in the theaters, with great actors and great direction.
796;because it is a great movie.
