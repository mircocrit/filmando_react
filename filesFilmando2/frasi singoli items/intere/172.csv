1;Loved the old cars and amazing scenery.
2;She plays a neuvo rich woman that gets in the way of Grants retirement as the Cat.
3;Grant and Kelly are wonderful.
4;The ending for a first time viewer is great fun!
5;Just when you had it all figured out, Hitchcock goes and changes everything up on you.
6;Great cast filled with great locations.
7;We found this to be an absolute classic.
8;Not just the cinematography along the glorious Mediterranean, the ever debonair Grant or the spectacular Grace Kelly (has there ever been a more beautiful leading lady), but how nicely the story weaves with crisp dialogue and suspense.
9;It is impressive to see a master tell a taut edge of the seat story without excessive violence, crude language and non.
10;value adding sex, yet still deliver sex appeal that leaps off the screen even 60 years later!
11;One word only describes: brilliant.
12;Grace Kelly's beauty, Cary Grant's moxy and humor, and Hitchcock's film genius create a classic film for all time.
13;A library 'must have' if you are a film buff at any level!
14;It is beautiful, interesting and very enjoyable.
15;This great movie was filmed with VistaVision, having a 1:85:1 aspect ratio.
16;It's a worthwhile romantic thriller with plenty of light moments, and certainly one of the most colorful films of his career.
17;hard Hitchcock fans is a brief but fascinating featurette, narrated by the director's daughter and granddaughter, which (much like the movie itself) shows a lighter side of Hitchcock.
18;Home movies of Hitch playing with his kids, horsing around on sets, etc. provide a unique glimpse into his family life.
19;If you love the film as I have for nearly sixty years .
20;was it this good in 1955 in a cinema?
21;I wonder!For me the enjoyment of the stars and the Hitchcock direction and the John Michael Hayes script is enhanced once more.
22;i look forward with pleasurable anticipation to more Hitchcock blu ray treats.
23;On the surface, it is easy to see why.
24;The film's plot is simple, the tone is light and the suspense sequences are sporadic.
25;But nonetheless, there is plenty here to enjoy.
26;The film benefits from Hitchcock's usual visual meticulousness and style as he utilizes the french backdrop to produce some truly elegant and picturesque compositions.
27;Hitchcock also imbues the film with an undertone of social commentary about class conflicts and their effects, while the climactic set.
28;piece that takes place on the roof tops at night, is pure Hitchcock suspense ingenuity.
29;Although the film may be a bit leisurely paced for some, it does pay off at the end to sit through it, as it is a very enjoyable and compelling film experience.
30;gRACE had charm,beauty,humour and class.
31;tO CATCH A THIEF is really a recreation for a great director in the middle of his creative peak.
32;A wonderful film by Hitchcock,King Of Mysteries.
33;it'll forever be a classic.
34;it draws through a virgin land of a French maritime in the 50's.
35;apart from the blue beauty of the overlooking Mediterranean sea,we can contemplate the beauty of Princess Grace Kelly too.
36;how many times have i visited Monaco,this time this twist.
37;ending story of Hitchcock has caught me delightfully with this never.
38;ending beauty of this place.
39;It's such a beautiful movie, andit's even better in Blu.
40;Take an unknown cat thief who is using all of the Cary's old tricks to loot the rich and famous.
41;Put that plot in the hands of Alfred Hitchcock and you have the basis for a sophisticated suspense thriller a la the 1950's.
42;Cary must defend his honor and retire that new thief on the block.
43;A little romance and other high jinxes along the way move the film along but in the end you know justice (and love) will be served.
44;This has always been a favorite, with Cary Grant at his most suave and Grace Kelly just perfect.
45;Hard to believe the movie is 60 years old.
46;This is one of my favorite movies.
47;A great who dun it by that classic director, Alfred Hitchcock.
48;It has glamor, suspense,beautiful locations and more!
49;Cary Grant and Grace Kelly were stars .
50;and it shows in this entertaining classic.
51;Cary Grant, in his 50's in this movie, is as handsome as ever with a trim body he was not afraid to show off .
52;Only a handful of actors have ever been as debonair as Grant and as graceful and elegant as Ms. Kelly.
53;They are a joy to watch.
54;definitely a movie to be enjoyed whether you are a Hitchcock fan or not!
55;Grace Kelly is absolutely divine in this classic movie.
56;ness like no other, and the rich scenery harks us back to the golden era of the 50's when values and morals such as integrity, honesty, and class counted for something.
57;Once again Cray Grant brings his sex appeal and charm to the film.
58;I am not a huge Grace Kelly fan but in this she is great!
59;This film is one of my top five favorite films of all time.
60;Hitchcock brings all you could hope for and want in a film!
61;Grace Kelley is funny, playful, and of course, beautiful.
62;Cary Grant is his charming self.
63;"classic hitchcock
64;and see how sexy grace kelly can be while keeping all her cloths on.
65;This is a fun movie.
66;I turn the closed caption on because there is some French spoken in it, and I can read it better than I can comprehend it spoken.
67;But if you have no French, it is still easy to understand the plot, directed by the great Alfred Hitchcock.
68;This movie proves his sense of humor!
69;Perhaps it's Cary Grant's robot like charm.
70;Grace Kelly is beautiful in a classic, albeit unexotic way, but her acting is nonexistent, as is the chemistry she generates with Cary Grant.
71;It's a wonder things work out he way they do.
72;Cary Grant banked on his remarkable charming screen presence, while Grace Kelly serves as window dressing with no personality.
73;kudos to the beautiful setting.
74;the story, as a classic Hitchcock, is tightly knit (and as such you need to keep your eye on the story or you may get lost).
75;Grace Kelly and Cary Grant are great, as usual, and the story is a compelling Hitchcock tale.
76;Being a Cary Grant fan, I've always liked this one, not as much as North By Northwest but still a great movie.
77;If you love Cary Grant, you'll love this film.
78;Combine his charm, acting with Hitchcock's directing genius along with Grace Kelly .
79;Two talented and beautiful actors.
80;Great locations, elegant gowns, and talented cast.
81;Hitchcock and Cary Grant bring their customary magic to this stylish and frothy thriller.
82;While this film may certainly be more to the taste of the female half of the population than the male, Grant's debonair ease and the suspense involved in cat.
83;mouse game between police, suspect, and real thief is enough to keep anyone interested, and the snappy dialogue between the main leads anchors this well.
84;to be a light and very fun theft/romance film with a touch of Hitchcockian darkness.
85;This is one of they best classic old movies out there!
86;I watch it multiple times a year!
87;This one holds up to the Ages, still engaging and does not have a dated feel at all.
88;nowadays there are so many remakes , but for this one they absolutely should leave the original alone, forever!
89;Great movie with a lot of suspense.
90;Cary Grant and Grace Kelly were superb!!!
91;Cary Grant and Grace Kelly make for a beautiful (despite his overly tanned physic) and engaging on.
92;Along the way he finds himself romantically involved with the beautiful (and wealthy) Frances Stevens, a young woman who happens to have an inkling as to who John `really' is.
93;As he gets closer and closer to the truth he finds that the truth may very well be the end (literally) of `The Cat'.
94;Cary Grant was used a lot by Hitchcock, but for me this is one of his less creative and interesting performances.
95;For me, this film is elevated because Grace Kelly is so deliciously charming here.
96;She really carries the film, and her natural giddy almost childish infatuation with Robie's true identity is appealing and engaging.
97;the final rooftop chase scene is brilliant (leave it to Hitchcock to capture some suspense), I just wish that the rest of the film had had that crafty intensity.
98;It is lightweight Hitch, but it's still Hitch, and it contains some of his signature director touches that make this a worthy viewing, even if it is only once.
99;This movie is an american classic, and an excellent piece of cinematic history.
100;I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys the hollywood classics.
101;A really nice movie, full of comedy and sparks betwen Grant and Kelly.
102;The film restoration is neat and clean on the close shots and midrange takes, the audio is perfect.
103;Charming elegance on every detail of the script.
104;have always enjoyed Cary Grant and Grace Kelly.
105;This is a 60 year old movie and Cary Grant is excellent as the main character.
106;the color in this movie is also excellent!
107;excellent plot, great movie, great acting.
108;Some of these old movies are my favorites.
109;Awesome scenery, no need for special effects.
110;Loved this movie when I was a kid and loved it even more many years later.
111;Grace Kelly was a beautiful women who was perfect for this part.
112;He naturally becomes the prime suspect when a fresh string of jewel thefts occurs.
113;In order to prove his innocence, he must catch the real thief.
114;Grant is superb as the handsome and charming John Robie, and Kelly also shines as the smart and alluring Frances.
115;in addition to breathtaking scenery, this movie has all the usual characteristics you expect from Alfred Hitchcock: a fine cast, clever and sophisticated story, and outstanding production work.
116;Still, it has been referred to as one of Hitchcock's lighter films.
117;And, in a sense, that's true.
118;There are some tense moments before this movie is over.
119;though To Catch A Thief isn't quite the thriller that some of Hitchcock's other great films are, it is an excellent flick in it's own right.
120;Grant and Kelly are great together, the story moves smoothly from light moments to suspense, and the location footage from the French Riviera is gorgeous.
121;Put it all together and you have a very entertaining and satisfying movie.
122;Beautiful, seductive and thrilling move you will want to watch over end over again.
123;Grace Kelly was one of the most beautiful women.
124;Wonderful scenery and the great Alfred Hitchock, but I think I must have outgrown these kind of plots!
125;Having said that I enjoyed watching it through to the end.
126;And the setting is gorgeous too!
127;Grace is elegant, Cary is a clever rogue, what else do you want?
128;alfred Hitchcock's thrilling direction keeps us entertained and in awe of the beautiful film locations.
129;the acting by Grant, Kelly and the young French girl was up to task.
130;Must see for all Cary Grant fans.
131;Must watch North by Northwest also which is another Grant classic.
132;This is a wonderful movie from start to finish.
133;If you prefer movies that entertain, rather shock, horrify or outrage, you'll enjoy this one.
134;Look up the definition of the word """"handsome,"""" and you will find a picture of Cary Grant."""
135;His expertise is manifested through the well.
136;written screenplay, exotic locales, perfect chemistry between Cary Grant and Grace Kelly, wonderful fashion designs by Edith Head, and resplendent cinematography of France and Monaco.
137;"To know what makes a master director is see in a film how perfectly choreographed all of the elements together are
138;All in all, To Catch a Thief is an enjoyment of a viewing.
139;So sit back and bring the popcorn and enjoy the show!
140;Watched again two of the most beautiful people of their entertainment generation.
141;Still as good as when I first saw it.
142;Amazon is a great source of movies like this and access is so easy.
143;Beautiful location and beautiful people.
144;combine that with the mastery of Alfred Hitchcock's directing and you have a classic movie not to be missed!
145;The magnificent location on the French Riviera, stunning color, brilliant plot, gorgeous costuming, and superb acting make this one of my all.
146;Cary Grant and Grace Kelly are perfect in their roles, but just as perfect are the supporting cast, especially Jessie Royce Landis as Kelly's mother and John Williams' as the insurance inspector.
147;Great looking and polished acting meet a good script and great directing!
148;This is one of Alfred Hitchcock's most amusing films.
149;It's not humorous throughout, and there is a mystery there, but it is truly a fun film.
150;One historical note: this was the last film Grace Kelly did before she married the handsome Prince Charming . . . er, Rainier.
151;Grace Kelly plays a wealthy American beauty (type casting all the way) who decides she's going to catch the thief (figuring it's Robie) by baiting him with her mother's beautiful diamonds.
152;And her beautiful self, playing at seducing him.
153;jessie Landis is great as the mother who acquired wealth suddenly when oil was discovered on her property not long after she was widowed, and is determined to find a """"real man"""" for her son."""
154;Naturally, Cary Grant seems the type to her.
155;robie was also active in aiding the French Resistance during the war, and so he knows a lot of people who were also involved in the Resistance.
156;keep your eye on those Resistance fighters.
157;good fun, pretty scenery, a terrific costume ball, and a nicely complex plot.
158;Hitchcock is a master story teller.
159;An unusual story with many a twist and turn.
160;Light a fire, heat up some hot chocolate, sit back, relax and enjoy.
161;Gary Grant is appealing, Grace Kelly can't act but her beauty and costumes make her compelling.
162;One of Hitchcock's lighter films.
163;Not only are the actors especially well.
164;suited to the roles they play, but the plot is riveting.
165;I love the subtle humor
166;To Catch a Thief, is an outstanding move and has great performances by both Gary Grant and Grace Kelley.
167;It is a perfect move to watch with your wife
168;I have always enjoyed watching older films because of the clean language.
169;This movie has great acting and the plot is excellent.
170;This is a must watch for people that like a movie with a twist.
171;This classic film of Hitchcock is much lighter fare than his usual, yet it still has the mark of the master story.
172;Delightful to watch, with beautiful scenes and clever dialogue, To Catch a Thief will be welcome by those who like good, enduring classics.
173;While I never have been the biggest fan of Cary Grant (heresy, I know), this was an enjoyable, nicely.
174;cary Grant at his best.
175;Grace Kelly is a beauty.
176;Fun to try to find Hitchcock in the movie.
177;pretty easy to spot him.
178;The new blu ray of this classic movie is breathtaking but that is really just the icing on the cake.
179;Of the hundreds of classic romance movies made this one has it all and more.
180;Beautiful people, locations, clothes, and great dialogue.
181;It's a throwback to a simpler time when sex was implied and not front and center.
182;Enlisting the help of a British insurance agent,Grace Kelley and her mom as rich American tourists, this unlikely Scooby Gang manages to foil the thief and save the day.
183;Do yourself a favor and take this movie out for a spin.
184;Second, it reteamed Hitchcock with not only his favorite actor, but also with Kelly, his favorite actress, and the archetype for all the other blonde actresses in his other great films of the 50s and 60s.
185;hearted romp, full of beautiful scenery, bawdy double.
186;, and a plot as light as a French souffle, which was a welcome change for Hitch, after a series of much darker films.
187;some of the supporting cast were French, which required some less than successful redubbing of dialogue, but great comic turns were provided by British character actor John Williams, and the redoubtable Jessie Royce Landis, who was so delightful as Kelly's mother that Hitchcock cast her as Cary Grant's mother in 'North by Northwest'!
188;of' featurette, a Remembrance, featuring recollections of Hitchcock's daughter and granddaughter, an instructive look at how the story came to the screen, and a great piece about Hitchcock's favorite costume designer, Edith Head.
189;He was pretty good at his trade.
190;"well it looks like ""The Cat"" has stuck again."
191;This movie was great to watch and see areas in Europe that we had been to in the past, as well as following the mystery the two stars were trying to solve.
192;This is a wonderful film because Grace Kelly and Cary Grant star in it.
193;It is a true classic.
194;and the outfits in it are beautiful.
195;Keep in mind its an older film but still a great one.
196;When jewel thievery goes on the rise in his city, he finds himself blamed for all of it and must clear his name.
197;Grace Kelly is a visiting American heiress who gets turned on at the thought of his criminal activity, so naturally the two of them find a lot to do when they're alone in the dark.
198;Gorgeously shot in bright Technicolour, it's exciting and daring, a film you'll enjoy thoroughly if you don't expect the kind of suspense you get from Rear Window or Shadow of a Doubt.
199;Well Done Thriller and Grace Kelly looks gorgeous !
200;Highly recommend and think you will enjoy it if you have never seen the movie.
201;The color is so vivid love this movie.
202;Cary Grant is the best, and how ironic that Grace Kelly had a car wreck that took her life on the same road that is in this movie:(.
203;Irreplaceable Grace Grant and Cary Kelly, saturated with ineffable style and charisma.
204;Beautiful, poised, elegant, brittle, delectable beyond compare, with a sly, sparkling, witty script, concealing an intriguing sub.
205;Good movie, kind of a light hearted suspense movie directed by Alfred Hitchcock and starring Cary Grant and Grace Kelly.
206;generally implausible, but such a wonderful ride to the happy ending with Hitchcock at his best in steering the superb cast around the obstacles.
207;Lovely scenery and a foretaste of Grace Kelly's driving.
208;As such it was enjoyable.
209;Several other actors, like the Lloyd's guy and her mother, are great fun, too.
210;Suspend disbelief and enjoy watching the actors.
211;Great scenery in the movie.
212;Very good blend of suspense and light comedy.
213;Grace Kelly is probably one of the best looking women ever.
214;This travel brochure to adventure and romance is one of Alfred Hitchcock's most entertaining films.
215;The gorgeous vistas of the French Riviera are matched perfectly by the stunning duo of Cary Grant and Grace Kelly.
216;Robert Burks' cinematography was nominated for an Academy Award and Edith Head gives Grace Kelly the look of an American princess.
217;A fine screenplay from Michael Hayes based on a novel by David Dodge, and a light romantic score from Lyn Murray combine with all the other elements to make this a true film classic.
218;american John Robie (Cary Grant) has been living well in a beautiful villa on the French Riviera for the past 15 years.
219;He chose to stay and fight with the French Resistance upon his escape, and became a legend.
220;Since the only way to clear himself is to catch the thief himself, he hooks up with an insurance agent whose company is paying out the claims on all the robberies and begins a game of cat and mouse with the thief.
221;The cheese in the trap is the delicious Grace Kelly.
222;that evening together is framed beautifully by Hitchcock, cutting back and forth between the fireworks outside on the Riviera and the fireworks going on inside.
223;Kelly is like a playful kitten with a gleam in her eye, and Grant the older cat, who's seen her kind of kitten before and isn't sure he wants to play.
224;There is a wonderful chemistry between the two, who seemed to be made for each other on the screen.
225;A wild ride in her sports car along the coast that has Robie a little worried and a picnic in elegant dress are a treat to watch.
226;complicating matters is another sexy kitten, Danielle Foussard (Brigitte Auber).
227;By this time, Francie's wise mom has set her straight about Robie, and together they set a trap for the real thief at a posh costume ball.
228;it will lead to an exciting and entertaining chase on the rooftops as Robie unmasks the imposter.
229;There is a terrific conclusion as everyone gets what they want, especially the viewer.
230;This is elegant escapist entertainment that you can't help but fall in love with.
231;A marvelous film to get lost in on any weekend.
232;This story has lots of action, lots of close calls and ultimately a pulling it all together to Catch A Thief.
233;Good entertainment that I recommend.
234;A must see movie, Kelly Grace is stunning in this movie, fun and light plot, a true classic and beautiful scenery
235;Along the way he meets Grace Kelly, and a romance blossoms.
236;hitchcock goes more for sophisticated fun than suspense here, and succeeds quite well.
237;Grant is eloquent and droll, and Kelly is livelier than usual .
238;and quite lovely to look at, too.
239;The photography along the Riviera is beautiful.
240;I love Hitchcock and Cary Grant who could want more .
241;Look for Hitchcock it's fun .
242;Grace Kelly is beautiful .
243;Harrison Ford's movies are always worth seeing again!
244;I wish they still made movies with class like this one.
245;I'd recommend this film to anyone.
246;Fun movie with an unexpected twist.
247;Nice and clean something you don't see anymore.
248;Would recommend this movie to anyone.
249;I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
250;virile older man (Cary Grant), it is still an enjoyable film.
251;Grace Kelly does a good job as the young love interest attracted to still.
252;Good performance by whoever played the mother of Grace Kelly.
253;A classic romance, with thrill and excitement, what you expect from Hitchcock, cute and sweet.
254;Although Kelly is lovely she has trouble acting the part in my opinion.
255;Classic Hitchcock with great dialogue between Cary Grant and Grace Kelly .
256;This is one of my favorites if you like this one I would also recomend charade and north by northwest
257;lavish production, setting in south of France, suberb performances by entire cast.
258;Grace Kelly and her outfits are worth the viewing.
259;a tanned and much older Cary Grant is a bit tight .
260;Cary Grant is typically cool and witty.
261;Grace Kelly is beautiful and is always dressed amazingly.
262;The plot is clever with twists and has clever dialogue.
263;This is one of my favorites!
264;Carry Grant at his most charming screen self.
265;Grace Kelly purrs her way into your very soul.
266;The setting is grand: the French Riviera.
267;The writing and plot is brilliant.
268;This is one of many Hitchcock directed films that are worth seeing time and time again.
269;The cat reveals its character from beginning to end of this delightful film.
270;Alfred Hitchcock weaves a fine tale of Suspense and intrigue.
271;Cary Grant stars in another Hitchcock thriller.
272;It ages well and is just as good today as it was when it first came out.
273;Hitchcock's 1955 charmer TO CATCH A THIEF sits squarely in the middle of his most polished, prolific decade in Hollywood.
274;It's also his most unusual film, as the crime caper element of the story constantly takes a backseat to the romantic comedy interplay of it's two stars, Cary Grant and Grace Kelly.
275;it's a delicious holiday on the Riviera coast when you join Grace Kelly and Cary Grant in TO CATCH A THIEF.
276;", ""Alfred Hitchcock: An Appreciation"", and ""Edith Head: The Paramount Years"")
277;The transfer is quite good.
278;This is a great entertaining movie.
279;Grace Kelly, Cary Grant, all the supporting cast and the views from Monaco's High Corniche road and beach are what you need for an afternoon delight.
280;The excitement, the drama, the lighting and cinematography and just brilliant.
281;The total production values are of a kind that one rarely encounters now days.
282;One of the Greatest love mysteries in the history of filmdom.
283;Cary Grant and Grace Kelly were perfectly cast and I can't imagine how they could have done a more perfect job of acting.
284;For her beauty and his charisma are among the ALL time greatest Ever.
285;one of my all time favorite movies indeed.
286;Cary Grant, is very good in this.
287;I wish they made more solid movies like this that all can see.
288;This is a must see.
289;And Princess Grace is so beautiful in this.
290;This is a fine Hitchcock film, with Cary Grant and Grace Kelly at their best.
291;Story is exciting and has humor as well as adventure.
292;Fabulous scenes and views of southern France would make this worth watching, even without the suspense, which is Hitchcock at his comic best.
293;To Catch A Thief is a very unconventional Hitchcock film, in that it is a romantic comedy, and much like his other romantic comedy Mr Mrs Smith, it is well worth a look.
294;And not just for curiousity sake, for the film has many great touches: wonderful acting, glamourous location photography and most interesting story that elevates the story from it's romantic comedy underpinings.
295;as a Hitchcock fan, you have to ask yourself: do want to be entertained?
296;Grace Kelly is most rapturous in this role, and a little more sneaky than her role in Rear Window"
297;the sexual overtones play out very well.
298;"One of the few good points about the old Hollywood Production Code was the creative dialogue it caused writers to come up with in order to get their points across about sex
299;Nevertheless the Master still employs his dazzling tricks to engage us in the film, but more subtly than usual.
300;The end finale packs a suspense we love from Hitchcock, and the various police chases are fun as well as suspenseful.
301;all in all this film is well worth it .
302;winning cinematography in a widescreen, properly.
303;This is a great movie, famous director and famous actors.
304;Pretty locations to look at, Cool old cars.
305;Story that keeps you guessing.
306;What more do you need.
307;Another Paramount classic, given the lavish """"Centennial Collection"""" treatment ."""
308;is to catch the real thief.
309;So he strikes a deal with a representative of the insurance company .
310;And so it goes, the two of them striking provocative sparks off each other, as the plot turns and twists upon itself, just as one of those twisting roads along the coastal cliffs twists and turns, climbing higher.
311;the movie itself has aged very well .
312;the Riviera locations and the palette of colors are still striking, although the use of rear.
313;Of the extra features included, the stand.
314;I see this all the time in Amazon listings.
315;I know this is probably considered a classic and it was probably good for its time, but the acting is so wooden!
316;First, two of the most beautiful people ever in a delightful movie escapade of fun and escape from the ordinary.
317;Another great classic movie from a time when movies had scripts and real acting.
318;Of course anything Alfred Hitchcock directs is going to be good.
319;It's a classic, has a good story line, features great actors, and has a slight twist at the end to titillate the amateur.
320;Grace Kelly amazing and always liked Grant in anything.
321;Seeing this now proves it.
322;I have always loved Cary Grant, but this is one of my all time favorite movies.
323;I loved the suspense and romance.
324;I thought that it was very well written and the acting was spectacular.
325;Still good even after all this time.
326;Considering that the movie is old, the colors and the photography were amazing.
327;I love Cary Grant and think that he is the epitome of an actors, actor .
328;To catch a thief is a wonderful movie filled with intrigue.
329;It is high on my movie classic list and it is so worth seeing over and over again!
330;Hello, huge Hitchcock fan here.
331;I might be in the minority, but despite enjoying both films, I think this is the better of the two.
332;Definitely among Hitch's best (Lady Vanishes, Vertigo, NxNW, Rebecca).
333;It's quite suspenseful and the viewer is never really given a clear picture of who it could be.
334;It is up the viewer and in the end all will be revealed.
335;We enjoy the comic interactions of Grant and Kelly as well as between her mother and Grant's character.
336;Most of the actors turn in wonderful performances, and I think that this is among Grace Kelly's best roles.
337;the digital transfer is lovely, especially considering the gorgeous outdoor scenes filmed on location in Southern France.
338;The use of color works well in this film, the Vitavision or whatever it was that Paramount premiered for use in this film was cutting edge technology at the time and it shows.
339;the special features are on the second disc, and include some pretty interesting little extras.
340;More interesting was the casting and the making of documentaries, as well as the documentary about Hitchcock and the Hayes code.
341;Interesting to note all of the innuendo he got past Hayes, and how he was able to achieve this.
342;so to sum up: spectacular film, great digital transfer, some good extra features (though nothing compared to some of Hitch's Criterion Collection releases).
343;One of Grace Kelly's best performances.
344;Cary Grant's performance was also spectacular.
345;His cool sense of humor was a great match with Grace's seduction.
346;Thanks to those who do this.
347;ray movies I have seen.
348;I give it a 9.9 on a 10.0 scale.
349;It is better than most modern day movies which are shot digitally.
350;the image was very sharp and detailed, except for some close up skin shots.
351;The reason I say this video is better than most modern day movies shot digitally, is because even the background seems to be sharp and focused.
352;ray movies should look this good.
353;I love Hitchcock, I love Cary Grant and I love Grace Kelly.
354;The material is light and fast.
355;it is a fun, swiftly paced romantic adventure that displays Hollywood (and the French Riviera) in all its grandeur and glory.
356;She's watched it several times since then.
357;screen chemistry that Cary Grant brings to the screen with Grace Kelly.
358;Was impressed with the prompt processing of my order and in its fast delivery.
359;I really like most of Cary Grant's movies, and this one's no exception.
360;The package was in great condition.
361;I would recommend it for all agesHollywood needs more like this one giving good suspense without overdone action to be most realistic as related to.
362;Still interested to see some of the movie stars of the past.
363;This movie has all the classic elements of dialog and structure of post.
364;cary Grant delivers a strong performance, and Grace Kelly is the absolute embodiment of a classic, classy beauty.
365;an added treat is that the picture was filmed on location in the south of France, and it thus provides an interesting look at post.
366;This classic movie was made when glamour and mystery were necessary for a hit.
367;I have watched it over and over and always see something new.
368;The beautiful people and locations are even better on our new TV.
369;Lacking any real suspense, the movie was held together by the excellent cinematography offered by the picturesque French Rivera locale.
370;grace Kelly, whose acting ability does not rival her beauty, plays a perfectly typecasted role for her.
371;Edith Head provides a high point with her fantastic wardrobes created for the costume ball scene.
372;cary and Grace are pure joy in roles they were born to live.
373;A great story line, well written.
374;Actors of course are fabulous especially in an era that can't rely on CG.
375;Picture was clear and sharp when viewed through Amazon Fire.
376;Double, triple entendres packed with intrigue, romantic suggestion and comic irony all drawn together by Hitchcock's balanced direction and set in the south of France.
377;One of my favorite Hitchcock movies!
378;Classic Cary Grant and Grace Kelly, both very elegant intelligence and it holds your interest until the very end.
379;This is one of the great films.
380;Cary Grant is at his best and the setting and time warp is great to watch for the nostalgia.
381;One of my favorite movies.
382;Great cast in an awesome Hitchcock who.
383;Great movie with great scenery and a fun story.
384;This one is a classic.
385;Cary Grant and Grace Kelly were great, and take you back 60 years.
386;any movie with Cary Grant and Grace Kelly is going to be watchable.
387;But it's all about the dialogue, the acting and the dynamic tension between the two stars.
388;While the picnic in the convertible scene is no where near as good as the dining car scene with Eva Marie Saint in North By Northwest, it's still enjoyable.
389;And Jessie Royce Landis was once again hilarious, but again, not as funny as her role as Grant's mother in NBN.
390;Well worth the time if you're a classic movie fan.
391;It is nice to know that there are classical movies that have a real trama, and hook you for the length of the movie.
392;The section with the additional material is fantastic.
393;I did enjoy it, while I watched it several times.
394;features a cat burgular and beautiful Grace Kelly and Cary Grant.
395;screen pairing and directed by the master of suspense .
396;must see movie and a great addition to any Hitchcock collection.
397;Beautiful movie in all aspects.
398;Makes you long for the glamour days on the riviera.
399;Grace Kelley was gorgeous, smooth, and believable in her character.
400;More importantly, she displayed a subtle playfulness.
401;All of his many and formidable gifts were on full display.
402;The suave and charming manner, the grace and athleticism of movement, and the self.
403;Beautiful scenery and Grace Kelly is gorgeous.
404;Great chemistry between Kelly and Grant.
405;Movie was both full of action, romance and comedy.
406;Perfect role for the type of role that Cary Grant did so well.
407;in doing so he discovers a beautiful, spoiled American heiress, Grace Kelly, who both helps and hinders him in his quest.
408;I have always enjoyed Grant's movies but have usually been underwhelmed by Grace Kelly.
409;In this movie though she did a great job and was splendid visually.
410;"This is one of the real ""classics"", one of the finest tales I've ever seen."
411;Fun movie to watch and own.
412;Great for the whole family.
413;When movies had style and grace.
414;Unflappable Cary Grant and irresitable Grace Kelly.
415;The movie is a classic, and a review of the movie is redundant.
416;Both Grant and Kelly are magnificent actors.
417;This is probably the best of the Cary Grant movies and with an excellent cast starring the beautiful and gracious Grace Kelly it embodies the enjoyment of watching two actors that are believable together.
418;I recommend this as a classic
419;I think it was worth the cost to upgrade.
420;Everyone should see this excellent movie.
421;My husband and I were in the mood for a good classic, and this one was.
422;It was fun seeing Cary Grant in action again and experiencing Grace Kelly's beauty and talent.
423;casted and a classic romantic, suspenseful thriller from Alfred Hitchcock.
424;One thing that Hitchcock really utilized on this film is color.
425;Everything was well done and vibrant.
426;The film looks beautiful and is featured in Widescreen enhanced for 16:9 TV's.
427;Casper is passionate about the filming and his commentary is just informative and well.
428;The Hitchcock class is one of the most popular classes at the university and the family has come to these events for several years answering questions from students in regards to Alfred Hitchcock as a director and also insight of his family life.
429;Very informative and enjoyable to learn about the family life of Alfred Hitchcock.
430;Interview with Hitchcock's daughter Mary Stone who gives insight of the film, especially the challenges of filming the kissing and beach scenes which the censorship code wanted eliminated from the film but how Hitchcock created the film to ensure that the scenes stayed in the film.
431;Interviews with production manager Dock Erickson who provides technical insight and using VistaVision.
432;An original feature used on the 2007 release.
433;This seven minute featurette is about the humor of Alfred Hitchcock and how Grace Kelly and Hitchcock were good friends.
434;Mary Stone (Hitchcock's granddaughter) discussing her personal experiences with her grandfather including working with him on a college paper about a film they both enjoyed and getting a C and more.
435;"minute featurette featuring Edith Head known for her costumes for ""Columbia Pictures"" and the many memorable films that she took part in."
436;A segment that allows people to see a map of the French Riviera.
437;The new features are just great, especially the interviews with his daughter Pat and granddaughter Mary who give us this personal side of Alfred Hitchcock.
438;In fact, the film is quite beautiful with the amount of cinema work done in France and thus you really get beautiful cinematography during the outdoor scenes.
439;the chemistry between Cary Grant and Grace Kelly was just well done.
440;Knowing that before Grant took the part, he was set on retirement and felt his career was pretty much done but it was that keen eye of Alfred Hitchcock that wanted these two together and he did what he could to get him to accept the role of John Robie.
441;Grace Kelly, a favorite actress that Hitchcock would have in several of his film (and this film would be her last for him before comitting to her duties as Princess of Monaco) was just absolutely dashing and charming.
442;of course, part of the beauty of the film is that it utilized the Technicolor technology, VistaVision for its widescreen shots (Hitchcock's first utilization of the technology in his films) and utilized stereophonic for audio.
443;"The film won an Academy Award for ""Best Cinematography"" and the film is quite deserving."
444;In fact, watching it again, I'm just amazed at the beautiful shots in the film.
445;If the three extra special features and the new commentary are worth it.
446;Personally, I found the added footage and commentary to be well worth it.
447;Dr. Drew Casper's knowledge of Hitchcock is just incredible and his commentary is absolutely well.
448;"done and again, ""A Night With the Hitchcock's"" was just a pleasure to watch."
449;this film is, to me, is Hitchcock's most passionate and strikingly beautiful looking films that he has ever done so far.
450;the film is elegant, beautiful and memorable and the many special features included really does give tribute to one of the world's most prolific director's ever.
451;"alfred Hitchcock fans, ""TO CATCH A THIEF ."
452;"CENTENNIAL COLLECTION"" is highly recommended!"
453;This is probably Hitchcock's most beautiful movie.
454;Grace Kelly is well (but of course decorously) displayed in delicate and perfectly fitted summer dresses and evening gowns (designed by Edith Head) that show off her exquisite arms and shoulders while accentuating her elegant neck and jaw line.
455;Opposite her is one of Hollywood's most dashing leading men, the incomparable Cary Grant.
456;time Hitchcock collaborator Robert Burks was shot on location in the French Riviera.
457;The style is daylight clear and sparkling, bright as the dream of a princess to be, always focused without a hint of darkness anywhere.
458;lying stone walls suggest a refined and elegant lifestyle to come.
459;She is used to having men fall all over themselves trying to court her, but Robie seems uninterested, and this excites her fancy and she goes after him.
460;"It is interesting to note that by this time Cary Grant (51 when the film was released) had become such a heart throb that directors liked to have the women (who were always noticeably younger
461;Here it is nicely done as the previously demure Frances takes a surprising initiative at the door of her hotel suite.
462;see this for Grace Kelly whose cool and playful demeanor and statuesque beauty form the heart of this somewhat languid romantic thriller.
463;I love Hitchcock and I think Cary Grant is great.
464;I found myself watching the clock.
465;I love Cary Grant movies and this is one you must have in your collection if you like Cary Grant.
466;Grants subtle humor, quick wit and debonair style, coupled with Kelly's on screen beauty grace, elegance and may I say fine acting, make this Hitchcock Classic and all time great!
467;Great acting and fun to watch.
468;Excellent directing from Alfred Hitchcock!
469;It was fun to look at all the scenery of France of so long ago.
470;A great movie for all ages.
471;a great combination, filmed in sunny France.
472;Great show from the past.
473;Item arrived in a timely manner and was well packaged.
474;This is a great movie with wonderful performances by a handsome Cary Grant and a stunning Grace Kelly, who plays a witty young American (she's not playing!)
475;The cut to fireworks over the water outside the window as Grace wears fake diamonds but makes real love may have laid the way for the greatest cinematic cliche, but here it is far more than that: the shimmering water, shining eyes, crackling fireworks, and sparkling theme of beauty's temporary nature contrasted with desire's undying love come together perfectly.
476;Like Shakespeare, Hitchcock's works seem infinitely rich and nuanced.
477;A great, subtly deep romance from the master (watch for him on the bus early on) of film.
478;I love Cary Grant and most of his films, and this is one of my favorites.
479;They are so good together and you really believe they love each other.
480;If you haven't seen this movie, please pop some corn, get your favorite drink, a nice blanket to wrap up in and turn off the phone.
481;I am a Cary Grant fan and it is a favorite.
482;Great to see two beautiful people in the same movie .
483;Alfred Hitchcock had a cameo appearance as well.
484;The movie was well worth watching just for the cinematic landscape views.
485;Just good old fashioned classical Hollywood entertainment.
486;I am a major Grant fan and I collect his work as best I can.
487;All caregfully designed to entertain.
488;He enlists the help of a restauranteur who was a friend of his in the French Resistance movement.
489;This is an entertaining movie with a fair measure of Hitchcock's renowned suspense, but with many lighter moments too.
490;This is a wonderful movie.
491;Grace Kelly is so beautiful and elegant in this movie.
492;It has a great plot and a Hitchcock suprise ending.
493;Cary Grant is also wondeful and the photography along the beatiful French Riviera is outstanding.
494;I highly recommend this film.
495;Alfred Hitchcock made two kinds of movies: bone.
496;chilling thrillers that looked into the dark side of human nature, and witty adventure stories.
497;To Catch A Thief is a sterling example of the latter kind of movie .
498;tinted caper, full of witty dialogue and solid acting from legendary actors.
499;are popping up all over Cannes, and he's the immediate suspect.
500;Narrowly escaping the police, he enlists a friend to help him clear his name by capturing this new Cat.
501;hitchcock was in fine form with """"To Catch a Thief,"""" especially since he had two great actors in the mix."""
502;Granted this isn't one of his more insightful or suspenseful movies, but it captures a sense of sly wit and fun instead.
503;"if ""To Catch A Thief"" has a problem, it's that astute viewers will be able to guess who the Cat is after about a half hour, maximum."
504;"sharp dialogue (""What do you say?"""
505;it's also gorgeous to behold .
506;But Hitchcock winds it up with a genuinely tense rooftop chase, complete with wrestling and gunshots.
507;grant is a bit grizzled (and VERY overtanned) here, but still dapper and charming enough for Robie, a thief with principles and a taste for the good life.
508;"Kelly is also quite good as an heiress who is less prim than she appears
509;disc Centennial edition has featurettes on film censorship, stars of the 1950s, """"making."""
510;"of,"" ""appreciation of,"" travelogue, galleries, something about somebody named Edith Head, and even a commentary by a Hitchcock film scholar."
511;"a commentary by a Hitchcock historian, feat""To Catch A Thief"" is a warm, sumptuous piece of classic film, with great dialogue and even better acting."
512;This film with Carey Grant and Grace Kelly will make you want to travel to the French Rivera.
513;I was a child when I first saw this film and thought it was awesome and kept my attention.
514;Hitchcock was at his best and he used the right cast and characters to perfection.
515;This is a good Saturday night film for a married or a couple getting ready to get married.
516;One of Hitchcok's best of the best!Anyone not yet in love with Grace Kelly will probably be.
517;plenty of wit, humor, and the famous Cary Grant style.
518;The very best romance with a touch of who knows what is he really the CAT or is it someone we least suspect?A super movie.
519;Although not one of Hitchcock's best films, To Catch is Thief is still a very entertaining comedy/thriller.
520;I really enjoyed watching it (and have actually seen it several times).
521;Its features include a clever plot, great acting, several comic moments, and wonderful chemistry between Cary Grant and Grace Kelly.
522;As he sets out to prove his innocence by catching the real thief, he comes across several intriguing characters .
523;including a cool, sexy young American (Grace Kelly), her mother, and a beautiful French girl.
524;so, even though, as I said earlier, this is not one of Hitchcock's best (compare it with North by Northwest, for instance), it is still a very enjoyable and exciting film, greatly because of the wonderful performances and nice scenery.
525;Cary Grant and Grace Kelly are real movie stars.
526;A lot of action and great romantic scenes.
527;A great mystery with a romantic twist.
528;beautiful views on the Mediterranean coast and fantastic wardrobe design, combine to enhance the witty dialogue.
529;Hitchcock movies are among my favorites and this is certainly up there.
530;The chemistry between Grant and Kelly is wonderful.
531;It's Cary Grant at his best, Grace Kelly at her most beautiful, Alfred Hitchcock at his most suspenseful, and the lovely setting of the French Riviera.
532;Grace Kelly and Cary Grant are to elegant and well acted.
533;Let's see, a Hitchcock movie starring Cary Grant and Grace Kelly that won an Oscar for cinematography, set in the French Riviera.
534;It has some great old cars, including a '53 Sunbeam.
535;My teenage boys also enjoyed this movie.
536;"To Catch A Thief is one of my favorite Hitchcock movies of all time (yes, I know it's not ""Vertigo"", ""Rear Window"" or ""North By Northwest"" ."
537;"but ""To Catch A Thief"" wasn't supposed to be serious, it was simply Hitch and some friends having fun!)"
538;imagine my happy surprise when the colors leaped off the screen at me, when the crispness of the pictures knocked my socks off!!
539;I'm frankly thrilled with it!!
540;Cary Grant is wonderful, Grace Kelly is divine, the supporting cast (especially John Williams and Jessie Royce Landis) get their chops in, and a good time is had by one and all.
541;And even beyond the stunning visuals, the scintillating dialogue and clever wordplay are easily worth the price of the movie!
542;I enjoyed the plot Sound was a little old but considering when the movie was made it was good
543;Saw this years ago and it is still good after all these years.
544;Would recommend this to anyone wanting some light watching.
545;this is one of my favorite movies of all time.
546;i'm very glad i did, i love it.
547;this is fine by me, the movie is the only thing i'm interested in.
548;i'm so very happy to have this with me.
549;This is a timeless Hitchcock classic.
550;Grace Kelly has such dominion over her role and Cary Grant is as charming as ever.
551;Great acting and I really like old movies, but this one did not keep my interest very well.
552;I give it a C+
553;Copy of this movie was good and clear.
554;Nice to watch again Grace Kelly and Cary Grant.
555;What a great experience it has been to watch this long.
556;On top of this, you get excellent bonuses: excellent documentaries, comments, still galleries,.
557;Paramount is doing its best with their classics!

559;being one the most sensual, elegant and beautiful women of all time.
560;world, excellent timing, top actor and comedian.
561;great support by the wonderful character actor John Williams and by everybody's favorite sophisticated mother: Jessie Royce Landis (although here she plays a woman of humble origins who became rich because of Oil being found in her Oklahoma Ranch.
562;anyway she looks and behaves like a Queen) and by French grand actor Charles Vanel.
563;This is a wonderful Blu.
564;ray of a perfect film, it's top notch, the colors pop.
565;The details are sharpand it only enhances the already wonderful performances and flawless directing.
566;One of my favorite films, if you love style and romance, excess, wit, charm and drama To Catch A Thief is what it's all about.
567;the Brosnan version of The Thomas Crown Affair and Before The Sunset all pay tribute to To Catch A Thief, the original stylish thriller.
568;For me Pierce Brosnan will always be today's generation Carry Grant.
569;this film with Carry Grant and Grace Kelly can never be replaced but it can be enjoyed by a new generation.
570;Like The Great Gatsby with DiCaprio sometimes a new version must be made for people to discover how great the original is.
571;What I love about this movie beyond the style, sophistication and great actors/characters is the irreverence.
572;It's a classic far above and beyond most films made today and the Blu.
573;ray is a flawless image of a flawless classic film.
574;Greatest atmosphere ever to be captured on film.
575;Highly recommend watching this movie on a regular basis.
576;Alfred Hitchcock brings the beautiful and talented Grace Kelly back for a third time in a starring role in his great movie run of the 1950's.
577;(Later Grant stars in another Hitchcock thriller .
578;North by North West (voted into the American Film Institutes top 100 American Films of the last 100 years .1998)).
579;"this proved to be a very wise choice because their(Grant's as ""The Cat"" burgular and Kelly's as a rich socialite)chemistry are electrifying."
580;Having Jessie Royce Landis as Kelly's heiress mother was also a perfect choice.
581;John Williams, the moustachio Englishman Insurance agent closes out this outstanding cast.
582;summary: Wealthy retired cat burgular (Grant) is accused of again stealing precious jewels from all the rich French Riveria millionairess'.
583;Grant befriends Williams, the rich Kelly and her heiress mother Royce.
584;Along this winding road of mystery Grant and Kelly light up the silver screen with a steamy (for the 50's) romance.
585;What a delightful TECHNOCOLOR movie.
586;Grace Kelly's beauty and her colorful gowns are vibrant and elegeant.
587;"lots of Extra Features
588;The Paramount Years Featurette (see really knows how to compliment the stars!)
589;this is a very enjoyable mystery and the ending presents a nice surprise.
590;This was one of Hitchcocks favorite movies and sadly his last with the beautiful Grace Kelly.
591;(Hitchcock had a great 4th movie for her (MARNIE) which see wanted to do but because of her future family obligation reluctantly refused Hitch.
592;grace Kelly and Cary Grant are gone now but they are immortalized through their great films forever.
593;This product came on time and in great condition.
594;Thanks for the great service!
595;A true classic movie that everyone should watch.
596;This is how you make love on the screen without all the nudity and smut of today's movies.
597;Wonderful color and sharpness for an old flick.
598;Great style and story in beautiful Monaco in the 50's.
599;Its a story with good dramatic bones, and Grant and kelly flesh it out nicely.
600;There is much to like about Hitchcock's TO CATCH A THIEF: Cary Grant and Grace Kelly at the height of their appeal, a witty script that offers Jessie Royce Landis one of the funniest roles ever seen in any Hitchcock film, and excellent cinematography designed to show off the beauties of Monte Carlo.
601;all packaged in a lightweight tale that is two parts romance, two parts travelogue, one part comedy, and just enough classic Hitchcock suspense to keep this lighter.
602;In the process he encounters an icy beauty (Kelly) who takes considerable pleasure in tantalizing him with her charms, her jewels, and her knowledge of his criminal past, and her mother (Landis), who is perhaps the best of the clever matrons to appear in any Hitchcock film.
603;While it will never compete with the more famous VERTIGO and REAR WINDOW of the same period, it is extremely well done and quite a bit of fun to watch.
604;Viewers seeking a pleasant film with a romantic touch will enjoy it a great deal.
605;Interesting plot with excellent actors who tell a story that is enjoyable without a crass approach to life or the subject matter.
606;A true classic that remains great through each repeated viewing.
607;To Catch A Thief has always been one of my favorite movies"
608;Maybe it helped that I was watching it on a brand.
609;ray transfers of classic films are as successful as this one, more's the pity, but within my experience, this one sets the standard.
610;If you love this movie, I highly recommend purchasing the Blu.
611;I actually bought this movie as a gift for my Aunt she loved it!!
612;I seen it before and I knew she would like it because she likes the classics.
613;To Catch A ThiefAlfred Hitchcock's To Catch A Thief is a light hearted romp on the French Rivera.
614;The French Rivera was one of Hitchcock's favorite locales and setting this movie there was like coming home.
615;of course, you have the suave Cary Grant, aging but still on top of his game, and the beautiful Grace Kelly.
616;with car chases along cliffs and a mysterious thief depriving the rich women of their precious jewels, you have a great film filled with humor and suspense.
617;The ending is a bit of Hitchcock's mischief.
618;edith Head's costumes are in the grand European tradition.
619;She was nominated for an Oscar.
620;Roger Burks's beautiful cinematography won the only Oscar.
621;This is a great film in the old tradition of comedy and suspense with a tidy mystery tossed in for good measure.
622;This is one of the best classics out there.
623;what a great movie to watch.
624;Outstanding mystery and suspence movie.
625;Cary Grant was one of the best actors of his time.
626;A nice respite from the formulaic movies and shows on TV.
627;Great performances by the ever charming Cary Grant and the beautiful and elusive Grace Kelly.
628;Hitchcock is such a genius writer and brilliant storyteller I can't begin to enumerate why.
629;Cary Grant is fantastic and Grace Kelly steals the show!

632;But this one may just be the most real, you.
633;there and lifelike disc I have ever seen.
634;Kudos to the nameless engineers who made it happen.
635;one gripe: most of the extra features again consist of random blathering by members of the Hitchcock clan.
636;I enjoyed this along with my wife.
637;No matter if you haven't seen it in awhile and you know the plot, it's always good to see it once more.
638;Cary Grant and Grace Kelly star in the 1955 Alfred Hitchcock film.
639;This version is almost technically perfect and the surround sound is excellent on a home theater system.
640;The breathtaking views of the French Riviera make the film even more enjoyable.
641;There's a great car chase scene through the mountains of southern France with Grace Kelly at the wheel.
642;this is one Alfred Hitchcock movie that you should not miss.
643;This is the third and final of Hitchcock's romantic suspense entities featuring the pulchritudinous Grace Kelly and the ever so suave and urbane Cary Grant.
644;It has a perfect mix of suspense and romance along with the buena vista of Monaco.
645;A fine addition to anyones collection.
646;Hitchcock at his best: suspense, humor, style, and charisma.
647;The versatile Cary Grant, the beautiful Grace Kelly, and a wonderful supporting cast.
648;TO CATCH A THIEF is a very entertaining film.
649;Cary Grant is brilliantly charming as John Robie the infamous and former jewel thief.
650;John Williams as the amusing Lloyds of London insurance agent is called in to catch a thief, the real thief.
651;Someone is copying John Robie's style as the famous cat burglar and there it is.
652;TO CATCH A THIEF was filmed in the French Riviera and it is filled with lush photography by Robert Burks and there is a certain holiday atmosphere that abounds throughout the entire film.
653;It is Alfred Hitchcock's most watchable films.
654;Absolutely love this intrigueing movie.
655;The story line, scenery, the romance and the actors, Cary Grant and Grace Kelly aresuperb.
656;Cary Grant and Grace Kelly are an awesome combination.
657;It has a nice twist at the end.
658;The beauty of Grace Kelly, the coolness of Cary Grant, directed by Alfred Hitchcock, and set in Monte Carlo.
659;All of this in one of the most stunning transfers from film to video (digital) format.

661;The Mystery, Intrigue and Romance makes this a GREAT Movie ane we really enjoyed it.
662;Cary Grant and Grace Kelly are great together.
663;I always like Alfred Hitchcock's movies.
664;My preference is for Hitchcock's grittier suspense movies, but """"To Catch a Thief"""" has so many things going for it, I can't give it less than 5 stars!It's the early 50's and in an introduction, we see the arms only of a black."""
665;Robie, once a hero of the French Resistance Army, was said to have reformed .

668;Hughson manages an introduction to a likely future burglary victim, the redoubtable Mrs. Stevens and her cool calm and exceedingly beautiful daughter, Frances.
669;And Grant has his humor on in several more scenes, such as when he's trying to escape through a flower market and a diminutive gray.
670;Bogdanovich knew both Hitchcock and Grant, and Bouzereau co. wrote a book about Hitchcock with the director's daughter, Pat Hitchcock.
671;"In his own words, Hitchcock could rely on the charm of two leading actors ""who were beyond charming""."
672;"grant was 50 years old when he filmed ""To Catch a Thief"", and he looks great."
673;One of the things they touch on is how Hitchcock got the innuendo.
674;style was more modern and American, at that.
675;Her grandfather liked happy endings, she says, but he liked to have a last little twist at the end.
676;"In this case, the very last scene has Grant and Kelly embracing on his villa's porch and Kelly murmers, ""So this is where you live."
677;I hadn't seen this documentary before, however, and I really enjoyed it.
678;I watch it for the humor .

681;"reforming, and Kelly is a rich American travelling with her mother (Jessie Royce Landis, Grant's mother in ""North by Northwest"") who catches the eye of Grant."
682;the movie has one of unintentionally funniest moments in movie history.
683;This movie isn't one of Hitchcock's great films, but it is the assured work of a master (with a cast to die for), so it's nice to see it looking better.
684;Long, lots of lovely drives through the extraordinary beauty of southern France.
685;Watching performances by some of the great actors/actresses of post WW II moviedom is a real treat.
686;Everything happens that one would expect, all done with great style.
687;What was the greatest kiss ever committed to the silver screen?
688;For me it comes from the Alfred Hitchcock thriller, To Catch a Thief.
689;That is movie magic and so is this wonderful, light.
690;lush cinematography, beautiful costumes, breathtaking vistas, and delightful performances by Kelly, Grant, and Jessie Royce Landis make this an extremely enjoyable film outing.
691;One of my all time favorite movies.
692;The beautiful American woman falling for the dashing thief.
693;I discovered my love for older movies while viewing To Catch a Thief .
694;Grace Kelly is beautiful and the French Riviera is also visually stunning.
695;Hitchcock the genius brings together the two most beautiful stars on the planet, Cary and Grace, in a mystery about a copy.
696;cat cat burglar who has stolen the retired Cary Grant's style.
697;Great movie, Hitchcock at his best in regards to mystery and intrigue.
698;The actor in this movie is not over done, it is a great movie just because of that.
699;Great movie, but the subtitles weren't in English for the words that were spoken in another language.
700;Great scenery of Cary Grant, oh and the towns and landscape scenery were lovely, too.
701;beautiful scenery and a fun special effects car chase top it off
702;I really liked this movie.
703;Some of the scenes and the picture is breathtaking.
704;A classic film of the 1950's .
705;The ice queen, Grace Kelly proves to be smokin' hot in this witty, sexy thriller.
706;Cary Grant is at his best, charming, self.
707;deprecating and the perfect leading man.
708;The dialogue is reasonably witty, and yes, Mr Grant and Ms Kelly, look good in that lacquered, phoney, fifties Hollywood style.
709;There's no question that the film, rich in colour, crystal clear, and glossy is well made.
710;One of my favorite Hitchcock movies.
711;Kelly's costumes and to die for, the actress who plays her mother is a riot, and Grant is at his best.
712;It is indeed a good.
713;This movie is a must.
714;have for fans of Hitchcock and both glittering stars.
715;Grace Kelly was so beautiful and elegant, such a great actress.
716;This is a true classic, great drama, wonderful acting, incredible sets, locations and wardrobe.
717;The chemistry in this movie between Cary Grant and Grace Kelly is great.
718;This is a love story but with enough action and adventure to keep the guys watching too.
719;Excellent movie very classic definitely worth watching Cary Grant is one hell of an actor to grace Kelly's easy on the eyes .
720;This classic Cary Grant movie is sensational!!
721;To Catch a Thief is the ultimate classic for this storyline.
722;"looking John Robie (Cary Grant), southern France ""cat burglar"" with an adorable British accent, sets the incredibly high standard for the thief."
723;We have this classic in VHS.
724;ray and it was worth the wait.
725;Amazon had a great price for it so picked it up along with some other movies.
726;In the Hitchcock tradition of lush backgrounds, devious clues that can lead the viewer to unexpected conclusions.
727;Easy to get distracted by the beauty of the scenery and, yes, the characters .
728;but that's part of the movie's charm.
729;Grace Kelly the French Riviera absolutely captivating, Cary Grant was not too bad either.
730;The plot is a little thin, but visually the film keeps your interest.
731;Cary Grant was one of Hollywoods greatest leading actors of the past 50 years.
732;A very good film staring Cary Grant and Grace Kelly.
733;The film then covers how Cary Grants finds the people who have copied his MO. a fun romp through the French country side.
734;A must see if you are a Cary Grant or Grace Kelly fan.
735;my 60+ husband hadn't seen it, he thoroughly enjoyed the movie.
736;watch film for all movie fans.
737;Grace Kelly is one of my favorite actresses and she is wonderful in this.
738;This is a classic suspense thriller, great movie!
739;A Cary Grant classic movie.
740;It was great watching it again.
741;I recommend this movie to those who love the old classics.
742;This is just a wonderful classic.
743;The way the shots are framed, Grace Kelly, Cary Grant, the young French lady and the fantastic location are all beautiful and a delight to watch.
744;Cary grant is a fav of mine and grace Kelly is such a class act.
745;"This is Hitch's least ""heady"" film ."
746;the sheer physical beauty of Grace Kelly in her prime, Cary Grant in his, and the French Mediterranean in its, they all conspire to confound intellectualization.
747;The screen seems slick with the vapors of the stars' physical luminosity.
748;even the simplest props, like garments, echo this celebration of stylized cinematic glamor and beauty.
749;Grace's whispy gowns and Grant's bespoke casual attire seem to animate the screen with enough energy to be characters themselves!
750;Watching Grant slip his hand into his trouser pockets or stride across the street is equally mesmerizing.
751;the tale combines suspense with comedy in a way that is utterly unique in all of Hitchcock's American work.
752;But it offers a telling sidelight .
753;the shimmering splendor of pure sensuous beauty.
754;This movie is the perfect classic movie!
755;As a Cary Grant movie, it's his usual GREAT.
756;Not a sit on the edge of your seat movie, like some of his are.
757;A good mystery story that keeps you guessing.
758;Also a nice love story.
759;Top acting by super stars.
760;The magic between Grace Kelly and Cary Grant sizzles.
761;The film is a classic.
762;Grace Kelly is a joy to watch.
763;I love Lyn Murray's music too.
764;Great actors, good script, fun adult movie the kids would love.
765;Another of those oldies that gives a great deal of pleasure to watch.
766;This is one of my most favorite Cary Grant movies.
767;If you're looking to see what Cary Grant movies are all about, one movie won't begin to show the wide variety of this actor, but you will love this one!!
768;He is fantastic in this film.
769;Watch it and pay close attention to all the details.
770;This movie is one of the classics.
771;Well acted, well filmed, well done.
772;Anything with Cary Grant and Grace Kelly is worth your time and this movie does not disappoint.
773;The witty banter between Cary and Grace and the supporting characters makes this movie a must see.
774;The cat and mouse game will keep you guessing too.
775;To Catch A Thief is great.
776;its target was a broader commercial appeal.
777;But I'm a big Cary Grant and Grace Kelly fan, and the chemistry between them was terrific.
778;Also, an excellent Hitchcock blend of humor and story line twist.
779;box spaces at the top and bottom of the screen, but fits those of us with older TV's.
780;Amazon, by showing pictures of the box cover greatly helps the search.
781;the puchase was smooth, and delivery fast.
782;I love the way they filmed back then.
783;And of course Cary Grant and Grace Kelly are beautiful people.
784;What is meaningful is that a beautifully photographed film, with a good backup score, was ruined by an inferior script, loaded with drivel, short on substance.
785;This is good for all ages.
786;Entertaining and the video/audio was very good too.
787;Watched this with my 24 year old daughter and she enjoyed it as much as I did.
788;Grace Kelly's beauty is mesmerizing and her energy leaps off the screen.
789;The movie is saved by her performance and the cineamatography.
790;She and Cary make such a great couple in this movie.
791;Just wish I could afford to go see it for real!
792;Suspense takes a back seat to romance as former cat burglar Grant turns detective to track down the culprit behind a recent string of jewel robberies, becoming involved with beautiful heiress Kelly during the course of his investigation.
793;"Proof that lesser Hitchcock is still far above average, with Grant at his most suave and debonair
794;earth mother"
795;Add in some truly beautiful costumes by Edith Head and breathtaking, Oscar.
796;winning color cinematography by Robert Burks .
797;There are three unique mini.
798;All in all a quite nice package that's definitely worth a look.
799;I just love Cary Grant and love this movie.
800;One of the top 3 of his career.
801;Full of beautiful scenery and beautiful people.
802;Full of suspense, charm, and even wit.
803;Worth every moment spent watching it.
804;Even though technology has brought amazing special effects to the screen, there is no substitute for an old gem like this.
805;Cary Grant at one of his best moments!
806;Interesting script and fun to see the old actors, but as with many of these old movies, the music is overpowering.
807;grant and Kelly are in perfect form.
808;The supporting cast is spot on!
809;Filmed in VistaVision by Oscar winner Robert Burks, Hitchcock's swanky, breezy suspense film takes a simple idea.
810;one cat burglar on the tail of another.
811;and spins it into cinematic gold.
812;"Beautiful scenery of the French Riviera in the 1950's
813;This is a visual treat.
814;The elegance and beauty of Grace Kelly is worth every second.
815;This is perhaps Hitchcock's nest work.
816;It is most definitely the perfect pairing of hero/heroine.
817;as always the perfect blend of suspense and romance as only Hitchcock can compose, against a breathtaking backdrop of European locales.
818;Nobody has surpassed the sheer watch.
819;This movie has the grace and elegance of a Russian ballet"
820;and a nice ending too.
821;except, if you are young and have never seen it, enjoy your first viewing.
822;An older movie, but a very good movie, full of suspense and thrilling moments.
823;A good movie for the whole family.
824;His plan backfires , however , but Frances , who believes him guilty , proves her love by helping hi escape .
825;A wonderful movie with breataking view of Nice and sorrounding places .
826;to Catch A Thief (1955) is a very classy and lighthearted Alfred Hitchcock romantic thriller.
827;This is one of those movies where I care less about the story and more about what I see on the screen.
828;Her presence lures me in.
829;"The beginning and end of the movie have the most Hitchcock ""feel"" of suspense."
830;The slower middle part, in my opinion, is a fancy and often lighthearted show .
831;a romance between John Robie (Cary Grant) and Frances Stevens (Grace Kelly), with fabulous wardrobes, fireworks, and the scenery of the French Riviera.
832;It's kind of spooky to see this.
833;the musical score by Lyn Murray is good.
834;overall, I give this movie 4 1/4 stars, rounded down to 4.
835;It's a good movie that I recommend.
836;This is a legit movie classic, Cary Grant is excellent as always and Grace Kelly is Grace Kelly.
837;A must have for your collection if you are into classic movies like I am.
838;grace kelly was beautiful and cary grant was masterful.
839;some great action, a beautiful setting, and a story that moves nicely .
840;This is as good as it gets .
841;in the unlikely event that you have not seen this film, I don't wish to spoil it for you, so I'll not divulge any more of the plot, but it is HItchcock's usual masterful job, superbly played by a couple of Hollywood's top superstars when they were at the height of their careers.
842;A true classic representing a time when actors and actresses actually had character, and were identifiable as real professionals.
843;just good stories and good acting.
844;Not my favorite Alfred Hitchcock or Cary Grant movies but I enjoyed To Catch A Thief very much.
845;Grant and Kelly were great together.
846;this is a great movie for everyone.
847;notch efforts, but worth a look for the glamour, scenery, and some good lines.
848;"Extra points for the sharp new widescreen image, though, which at least restores ""To Catch a Thief"" to its former visual glory, always one of its strong suits."
849;While I am not, in general, a big classic movie buff, I do have my favorites and I do love me some Hitchcock.
850;so, how good of a job has the studio done with this classic?
851;They have done an outstanding job and I don't say that very often.
852;Color and contrast look remarkable for a film of this age (nearly 60 years!)
853;You've never seen Cary Grant and Grace Kelly look quite this good before folks.
854;"If you want a real visual treat, go straight to the ""party scene"" near the end of the film."
855;To be sure, it has a lot of wonderful touches, beginning with the two leads, Cary Grant and Grace Kelly.
856;To clear himself, he teams up with an insurance representative to capture the real thief, finding romance along the way.
857;Segments linger on, seemingly to simply showcase the stars in elegant clothes or to give us a taste of leisurely pursuits along the Riviera.
858;Still, the cast manage to keep this one afloat, so I'm going to be generous: 4 stars.
859;My family loves Cary Grant and he doesn't disappoint in TO CATCH A THIEF.
860;To catch a thief has many elements that will grip all kinds of viewers to the screen.
861;"The scenario is the great french Riviera, and you have to add to the incredible landscape the fact that this movie was made in 1954, so there's that glamorous, ""antique"" touch."
862;"Cary Grant is what women call ""good."
863;"looking"" and besides he has a tremendous comic vein that shows in his face."
864;"His kind of comedy is subtle and many times he doesn't have to say a word, just using his facial expressions to be funny (watch also Hitchcock's ""North by northwest"" to see how funny Cary Grant can be)."
865;Grace Kelly has the highest beauty and glamour possible in an actress in the fifties (similar to Nicole Kidman in the 2000s).
866;Also, she's a very talented and expressfull actress, being alternately cute and hard.
867;"with all these elements, ""To catch a thief"" has to be an interesting and entertaining movie."
868;during 100 minutes, Hitchcock and his cast give us thrilling chasing scenes along narrow, drop.
869;paced and intelligent dialogue between the main characters.
870;To catch a thief may not be Hitchcock's finest and most thrilling movie, but it's a good example that he could make non.
871;regular movies and still be very good.
872;But it is required viewing nevertheless.
873;True classic of class, grace respect and good acting.
874;Cary Grant is charm and man rolled into one.
875;Grace Kelly is charm, guile, and woman rolled in to one.
876;Together the pairing makes for a classic movie.
877;And the mother helped make the movie.
878;The movie on a whole was very good.
879;Amazing cast, talent and director!
880;Cary Grant and Grace Kelly are talented, beautiful and will always be cherished in this film.
881;It is an excellent movie performed by great actors I enjoy it immensely!
882;I do enjoy the classics with the great actors I would recommend this movie to anyone
883;Even my 18 year old nephew loved it!
884;My two favorite actors together were very good.
885;Great chemistry, I could feel the tension between them.
886;Lovely scenery, fun characters, good actors, beautiful clothes, Very good plot.
887;This is movie making when it was fun, and glamorous.
888;I really enjoy To Catch A Thief .
889;What a beautiful couple they make, lol.
890;One of my favorites of all times.
891;Thanks for the prompt and courteous service.
892;Cary Grant is wonderful as always and the story was very interesting.
893;If you are a Cary Grant fan you will love this movie
894;I like oldies but goodies and I really liked seeing this movie again.
895;Although an old movie, this one is still outstanding!
896;Not many movies today can beat the acting of these two artists !
897;Excellent movie for all ages!
898;The plot and suspense were captivating!
899;So refreshing to find a movie that is clean and fun to watch!!
900;Grace Kelly plays a very attractive and wealthy American socialite (talk about a stretch).
901;A series of robberies occur and Grant's John Robie character is suspected and he must go into action to clear his name.
902;Hitchcock knew how to present Kelly in her best light in this and the other 2 films he did with her.
903;is great and Grant has a role that is custom fit for him.
904;John Williams is also excellent as the insurance agent who brings them together.
905;My favourite Cary grant movie .
906;and now in widescreen format so you can actually see what's going on!
907;Amazing scenes (flower market, costume ball, etc.) Best Hitchcock in my opinion.
908;They have such a great chemistry!
909;Burks won the Academy Award for Cinematography.
910;To Catch a Thief is a stimulating film that won Oscars for best cinematography.
911;The end result is a thriller that delivers suspense and drama while offering a first.
912;This is a pretty good movie if you are looking for the run of the mill catch me if you can type movies.
913;Back in his burglar days, Grant was known as the Cat and during Grant's attempt to clear his name, there are a lot of good suspenseful cat burglar type scenes across the roof tops.
914;Superb acting and great scenery.
915;Grace Kelly was amazingly elegant.
916;They are charming and have interesting stories.
917;I don't like to be frightened but I like a good mystery.
918;This definitely fit the bill.
919;I enjoyed the interplay between the two main characters and the wondering if the cat was still the cat and.
920;Another thing I loved about the movie was all the comedy .
921;It made for a fun and stimulate movie.
922;trying to discern the thief isn't all that hard, however, to see Cary Grant and possibly the most beautiful woman of all time (Grace Kelly, if you weren't sure) in a Hitchcock thriller set in the South of France is enthralling.
923;"this film is wonderful
924;many Hitchcock fans wouldn't consider this in as high esteem as his other Cary Grant picture of the 1950's or perhaps even `Notorious' which is also a fine film, and possibly they are right.
925;Even so, this film is from a director in his most creative era, Grant being as charming as ever and Kelly as resplendent as always.
926;Hitchcock, Grant, Kelly, how could it not be excellent?
927;I've been wanting to get some of the Alfred Hitchcock classics.
928;I just got stuck in the airport and found this delightful movie to take me away.
929;It is a must for all romantacists.
930;Classic film, and one of my all time favorites.
931;One of our favorites, this is a great restoration of a classic movie.
932;If you haven't seen it, definitely do.
933;Grace Kelly and Cary Grant are wonderful.
934;Alfred Hitchcock would be thrilled to see how beautiful and vibrant his film appears on Blu ray!
935;The picture is crisp and the colors are vibrant!
936;North By Northwest had already been released and is an exceptional transfer.
937;As was Psycho, in rich black and white tones that make it a joy to watch!I am so happy to see the wonderful films of Alfred Hitchcock receiving this treatment.
938;location shots on the French Riviera make this also a lovely look back at the height of postwar continental chic.
939;Grace epitomizes graceful, and Cary was rarely more charming.
940;The script is light and breezy, the laughs pleasant and frequent, and the cinematography is Hitchcock all the way, ie splendid.
941;Wish that movie makers today would realize what it takes to make a great movie.
942;This one is surely timeless.
943;This is one of Hitchcock's most treasured romantic suspense stories.
944;This includes the French police, Cary Grant, some beautiful women, and Lloyds of London.
945;Everyone on this breathtaking Paris hunt has his or her own plans for the captured Cat burglar .
946;TO CATCH A THIEF launches a charming race for all possible outcomes.
947;discovering the ending is only garnish on the main course that is certain to be enjoyed multiple times.
948;I eventually replaced the well.
949;Grace Kelly plays a seductive game of cat and mouse.
950;that's all folks, enjoy it when you want nostalgia
951;I enjoyed the movie, but have enjoyed other movies more, would recommend it.
952;This was a great movie, for the time this movie was made, this movie was great, It has a great plot and a sense of humor to it as well.
953;It is nice to watch the older movies, it is nice to see or get a sense of what things were like back then compared to now.
954;Cary Grant is still his great charming self, and you can tell Princess Grace was a perfectionist in her work.
955;She comes across very serious in her roll.
956;Monaco with it`s ageless beauty.
957;Cary Grant, the iconic star,looks old to play such an atheletic part but he was his usual good.
958;His old friends are after him and so are the police, but he nevertheless manages to collaborate with an insurance man (played by John Williams) long enough to obtain a list of all insured jewelery on the French Riviera.
959;This gives Cary Grant a chance to get ahead of the actual thief and also to meet the beautiful Grace Kelley.You've got to love it"
960;One of our favorites, we actually watched with our 12 year old who also loved it.
961;This movie is all that a movie should be.
962;A terrific story line, beautiful settings, perfect casting, beautiful people andclothes.
963;What else can you possibly say,other then pure CLASS.
964;the true elegance of these two stars are not to be compared to anyone in the industry today.
965;A truly great and wonderful movie.
966;Cary Grant and Grace Kelly are both great in this movie.
967;I love seeing the old movies of my day, the ones that I can hear the dialogue, no mumbling by actors, and I understand the movie.
968;I especially enjoy the way the camera stays focused on an actor for several minutes, unlike todays' movies where the camera jumps back and forth every few seconds because young people of today have a short concentration and attention span.
969;the hair and fabric rendering are incredible.
970;I will watch this movie just to see the visual quailty.
971;Good acting and beautiful people.
972;They were excellent and sharp as a whip, what a pair.
973;I have always been a fan of Cary Grant and I love his accent.
974;The scenery was splendid and the little car she drove.
975;One of Alfred's best movies.
976;good to see it again and again.
977;Good price for this too and it was a special gift for my husband.
978;Two great stars, a fantastic supporting cast, and the wit that is not written today.
979;Grant is at his debonair best and Kelly is one of Hitch's greatest cool blondes.
980;TO CATCH A THIEF is a light, frothy confection, full of beautifully shot location scenery, a mystery whose resolution is not rushed to conclusion, (though it should be obvious early on) wonderful verbal repartee between the brilliant Cary Grant and the never.
981;lovlier Grace Kelly, with perhaps a dollop of comic frosting on the top to make it all go down quite nicely.
982;Absolutely love the future mother in law and thoroughly enjoy this Hitchcock classic with such smart writing and two outstanding actors.
983;As always, has Cary Grant 's quirky sense of humor.
984;Fun, beauty, exciting, Good plot.
985;The mother and odd characters make this great oldie help support this timeless winner worth seeing again.
986;This is a classic film by Alfred Hitchcock the master of suspense and drama.
987;He also worked for the resistance during the war years.
988;Having visited the French Riviera many years ago I can relate to many of the scenes and places depicted in the film.
989;"Grace Kelly is Cary Grant's love interest in the film but not by design
990;I gave it five stars because it was a most enjoyable film.
991;It is a film you see from time.
992;time to reminisce as well as to see a great movie with exceptional great actors and actress that tell you that these performers were heads above many we see today with all the gore and mayhem!
993;Also being a fan of Alfred Hitchcock I always look to see his cameo shot in each film he directs.
994;In closing I would say the film is a must see for all Cary Grant and Grace Kelly movie fans!
995;Everything you'd want in a movie, wonderful cinematography, great acting, exotic settings, and Alfred Hitchcock directing.
996;This and The Transporter are my favorite escapist adventure films set in France.
997;This movie has humor, tension, beautiful scenery, and very sharp dialogue between Grant and Kelly.
998;The costume ball and scenes at the end of the movie are just wonderful.
999;Grant and Kelly definately have sparks flying between them, and the give.
1000;take between them is both funny and very sexy (for that time).
1001;ray without that dazzling shot of Grace Kelly.
1002;Everybody knows the plot of this movie.
1003;This is a light Hitchcock movie, probably not one of his greatest, but pretty close!
1004;The acting is superlative and funny.
1005;It is not made in a serious manner and that is great.
1006;I enjoy the older films.
1007;After visiting Nice, I really enjoyed watching this film because of the scenery.
1008;It brought back great memories.
1009;I'm a fan of Cary Grant.
1010;A very enjoyable and entertaining movie well worth the time to watch it.
1011;Another winner starring Cary Grant.
1012;This is another movie I absolutely adore.
1013;A simple story with a stellar cast.
1014;Some may find it dated, but the story and the acting are great.
1015;This is my favorite Hitchcock film.
1016;It has a great cast, great scenery, great costumes, and a charming story.
1017;a light to medium blue.
1018;This darkness takes something important from the Riviera scenes.
1019;I was very happy with this video.
1020;It is one of the best.
1021;I was pleased with the service I received.
1022;It may be a bit dated, but it's still a classic.
1023;So grab the popcorn or glass of wine or both and enjoy an evening with Cary and Grace.
1024;Every movie that I saw with Cary Grant is just perfect.
1025;He is a great actor, and Grace Kelly is lovely!
1026;This a great old classic.
1027;We enjoyed watching it again.
1028;I am sure this movie was good in its day but I figured it out in the first 10 minutes.
1029;Yes, there's a bit of a mystery here, but it is pretty light.
1030;And it is a complete hoot.
1031;And they got away with some pretty suggestion comments, too.
1032;I'm ready to hop the next plane to see the French Riviera myself.
1033;this may be lighter then Hitchcock's normal fair, but it is plenty fun.
1034;Sit back and get ready to enjoy a good film.
1035;Like """"North By Northwest"""" (that other great Hitchcock/Grant collaboration cleaned up by the same much."""
1036;beautifully clean vibrant colour .
1037;and it came with a nice slew of new complimentary extras.
1038;a truly gorgeous looking film finally given the format it deserves.
1039;the clean up seeing Robert Burks' original colour cinematography shine like a diamond.
1040;"Burks and his team (who had framed ""Rear Window"" for Hitch the year before) pulled an Oscar for their work on ""To Catch A Thief"" ."
1041;cODED so it'll play in all players.
1042;the film itself is the stuff of legend .
1043;a testament to clever scriptwriting, Director grit, meticulous planning and sheer leading man and woman starpower.
1044;"So we get lines like ""What you need is two weeks with a good man in Niagara Falls."""
1045;Cary smirks and gives the perfect double.
1046;And yet precisely because both the writer and Hitch had to be so devious .
1047;the film is so much better for it.
1048;Alfred Hitchcock knew that suggestion was more potent than showing .
1049;hitchcock also loved his leading ladies .
1050;Beautiful, sophisticated and (like her name) graceful in every way .
1051;So combined with the legendary Hollywood costumer Edith Head .
1052;you got the gorgeous Grace Kelly both looking and sounding ravishing.
1053;And on the story goes.
1054;Hitch was keen to ally this rising female star with a suitable male match and game material that would enhance both .
1055;he got Cary on board.
1056;And it worked a treat.
1057;The film was a huge hit with the public (and still is) .
1058;largely due to the great script and their explosive onscreen chemistry.
1059;the young wilful Danielle with a soft spot for the suave John Robie.
1060;And all of it leads to a rooftop finale in the dark with a clever twist in its rather elegant tail.
1061;Even the opening sequence that focuses on the window of a travel agent is gorgeous.
1062;"if you're a fan and your soft machine flutters at the thought of ""To Catch A Thief"" and its delicious naughtiness ."
1063;or are you just pleased to see me.
1064;Alfred Hitchcock and To Catch A Thief: An Appreciation (Home movies of Hitch and family .
1065;"GalleriesPS: Hitchcock's ""The Birds"" is due later in 2012 ."
1066;"see also my reviews for:""The Italian Job"", ""Saturday Night, Sunday Morning"", ""The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner"", ""North By Northwest"", ""Cool Hand Luke"", ""The Dambusters"", ""The Prisoner ."
1067;Great performance with some great supporting cast.
1068;An interesting plot with a surprising ending.
1069;time favorites: a perfect match of story, cast, director and location.
1070;There's more grain in the BD, so more detail.
1071;The colors pop nicely as well.
1072;TO CATCH A THIEF, directed by Alfred Hitchcock, is a lush and entertaining comedy/thriller concerning a jewel thief on the French Riviera.
1073;accused former cat burglar, has to find and catch the real cat burglar before he is caught himself, while the heroine, Frances Stevens, is on a quest to catch him.
1074;"sides of a chess game
1075;They come fast and furious throughout most of the film.
1076;one of the few good points about the old Hollywood Production Code was the creative dialogue it caused writers to come up with in order to get their points across"
1077;Its a wonder the dialogue passed through the censors without a murmur.
1078;albeit in a friendly, comedic manner.
1079;Lucky for us, it did.
1080;Alfred Hitchcock is the master of suspense!
1081;The music helps create the tension and, of course, there's a nice chase scene along the French coastline.
1082;He always adds a bit of humor, too.
1083;This film has just about everything going for it and is a personal favorite of mine, one which I have viewed many times over many years now.
1084;Shot in VistaVision back in 1955 (the year I was born) we are treated here to a visual FEAST.
1085;The visuals truly POP with both excellent resolution and vibrant color and much of the time it is so good that a three dimensional effect occurs while watching.
1086;color timing is spot on.
1087;In motion the transfer shines as well.
1088;They did a SUPER job!The best way for me to describe the picture is to say it bests the very best James Bond 'Lowry' restorations from the 60's.
1089;"Granted by only a few notches, but this transfer bests ""From Russia With Love"" which is an achievement in itself!Ok, the picture totally rocks, how about the sound?"
1090;It worked perfectly and sounded great.
1091;You can hear everything that is said with ease.
1092;With the enhanced resolution you can also notice every time an actor has been dubbed by someone else or by themselves in post production.
1093;The music is full of life and more vibrant than I have ever heard it.
1094;Lyn Murray's score sounds very much Bernard Herrmann and I had to keep reminding myself it wasn't, but that is a good thing as it fits Hitchcock to a tee!While not being as noticeably great as the video, the sound on this disc is as good as it could possibly be and I was more than satisfied with it.
1095;Kudos go to the audio engineers for a great job on the soundtrack!Bonus features abound on this disc and frankly I am surprised they could fit them in with so much space already used by the high bit rate transfer.
1096;Saw this eons ago, and was pleased to realize how good it really is.
1097;Carry Grand is perfect for the role, Grace Kelly is really beautiful, and you can't beat Alfred Hitchcock as Director.
1098;This is truly a great movie, and I highly recommend it.
1099;I love this movie and the scenery and beauty of the countryside is awesome .
1100;Of course, a Hitchkock film is a wonderful lazy day film.
1101;Nothing better than Cary grant and grace kelly
1102;The casting was great and Cary Grant and Grace Kelly were amazing.
1103;The banter between the two is wonderful.
1104;A good suspense film, even if you figure it out you still want to be sure.
1105;A good who done it film.
1106;Some old films are better than the new ones.
1107;also starring Cary Grant in one of his more athletically challenging roles.
1108;Not one of the masters best efforts but a fun movie all the same.
1109;I ordered this lovely movie for its classicly known actors and actresses, Cary Grant being one of my faves.
1110;Wowee!Lovely cinematography, a fairly good plot (another whereby a younger woman makes her moves for an older man), wonderful costuming, and beautiful people all make for some good entertaining for an afternoon or evening.
1111;Grace Kelly plays the beautiful daughter of a rich American woman who is high on the list of possible victims of the new cat burglar.
1112;Shot in the French Riviera, Hitchcock allows his camera to take all of the beauty in.
1113;There are simply lovely traveling shots of the location.
1114;cary Grant is playing Cary Grant at this point, but that's perfectly fine since their are few actors I enjoy more.
1115;Grace Kelly is simply gorgeous.
1116;Hitchcocks camera is as admiring as a new suitor.
1117;Their interply is fun, witty and sensuous.
1118;A famous scene between them intercuts their developing romance with fireworks and is pure sizzle.
1119;But for a beautifully shot, light hearted romance for a Saturday night it would be difficult to find a better picture.
1120;He is able to make woman swoon from 127 yards out.
1121;and to this day, that power will work on the loved.
1122;one that you watch this film with.
1123;This film is beautiful and clever in every way, in that it's a romance and a mystery.
1124;Few films are capable of doing so, but a great script(featuring that oh.
1125;famous love scene with the fireworks) and wonderful acting pull it off rather nicely.
1126;a lot of Hitchcock's stylish visuals are here.
1127;wonderful addition to any Hitchcock fan's library.
1128;Good movie, I have seen a several times over the years.
1129;for me to watch a move move than one time it has to be good.
1130;But the colors ARE nevertheless nice and rich, Grant is full of panache and Grace Kelly is simply scrumptious.
1131;The supporting cast is great, but to me the real stars are the post.
1132;Interior scenes benefit from the detail as the richness of the Rivera hotel and restaurant locations can be savored.
1133;"Come to think of it, this may be one of Mr. Hitchcock's most sensual movies, emphasizing the tactile: you see the patient fondling of the jewels, the enjoyment of the food (""."
1134;"and wine and, by implication, the treat represented by the lovely Miss Kelly (""."
1135;This movie is soooo great!
1136;It's Grant and Kelly at their coolest.
1137;The scenery is beautiful,the people are beautiful and the comedy is tongue.
1138;Well written, superb acting and a reminder of two handsome, intelligent actors in their prime.
1139;In addition to the beautiful scenery of Monaco, it has beautiful Grace Kelly for the men and Cary Grant for the women.
1140;The lovely blond supporting player is good on the eyes too!The script has great jokes, a little snide about Texas oil widows and thrill seeking heiresses.
1141;It has the characteristic Hichcock practices of adding humor to otherwise serious situations and attractive characters who are less than top drawer (a cat burglar, a spoiled heiress).
1142;A thoroughly romantic story in every aspect.
1143;I love the scenery in this movie.
1144;It was the most beautiful place to see in person and you can see that in this movie.
1145;The story line is fun to watch as well.
1146;Cary Grant is great in this film.
1147;Plus, great scenery and great character actors in supporting roles.
1148;Kept us guessing until the end.
1149;I'm sure the restoration will be clean, sharp and colorful.
1150;They've been good with their classics so far.
1151;This film won an Academy Award for best color cinematography.
1152;Two great stars on the French riviera.
1153;Master director, great actors and wonderful script.
1154;Great acting, beautiful photography and a wonderful script all in one.
1155;Would recommend it to anyone who loves movies.
1156;"What may be considered a minor work for Hitchcock, ""To Catch A Thief"" would be considered a great film if directed by anyone else."
1157;"This little jewel from Monaco is in fact a great film, which has been overshadowed by its less glamorous siblings such as ""North By Northwest""."
1158;"as retired jewel thief John Robie ""The Cat"" Cary Grant is every inch a study in grace, strength and agility in all areas of his life, be it eluding the French police to escaping the finely set trap of Pacific Northwest Heiress Grace Kelly."
1159;He is as always the perfect image of a movie star and brings with him all the charm and style we expect from Cary Grant, but just beneath the surface there is something else.
1160;This makes his performance all the more complex and compelling to watch.
1161;But she two is hiding something in her performance in this film as she did all of her films.
1162;It is all in her voice, that beautiful upper mid Atlantic accent that no one else in her Philadelphia background shares.
1163;thus in the high and rarefied atmosphere of Cannes, Nice and Monte Carlo, these two imposters meet and are drawn by mutual understanding and attraction into a perfect little Hitchcock mystery.
1164;To watch these two unearthly beautiful actors as they move through the hotels, beaches and villas of the area is to watch perfection in every sense of divine fakery and double sided joy of their beauty and talent.
1165;She is the only person in the story who is not hiding who she really is and in so doing is the comic center of not only the jewel thief's attentions but the pictures as well.
1166;"the screenplay by John Michael Hayes who also wrote such varied fair as ""Butterfield.8"", ""Peyton Place"" and ""Rear Window"" here in this work comes up with some of the most clever lines and double entendre in the genre:John Robie: Say something nice to her, Danielle."
1167;danielle: She looks a lot older up close.
1168;the dialog is funny and full of delirious wit and a little wisdom as well.
1169;Very entertaining and enjoyable movie.
1170;"If you've owned a copy of ""To Catch a Thief"" in any format over the years I can tell you right now that you might want to donate them to your local library or just throw them out."
1171;ray restoration of this Hitchcock classic is what all others will be measured against in years to come.
1172;"This is one of the most pristine picture transfers I've ever seen and certainly merits early consideration for ""Blu ray of the Year""."
1173;The restoration team at Paramount deserves the highest praise possible for bringing back all the brilliance of this Hitchcock classic.
1174;The film won a 1955 Oscar for Cinematography(Robert Burks)and this blu.
1175;ray edition brings those beautiful colors back and then some.
1176;And the French Riviera never looked more beautiful in this blu.
1177;"Hitchcock made eleven films in the decade of the Fifties starting with ""Stage Fright""(1950) and ending with ""North by Northwest""(1959)."
1178;The same goes for Cary Grant, one of the greatest actors in film history.
1179;"ray: ""Notorious"",""An Affair to Remember"",""North by Northwest"" and now ""To Catch a Thief""."
1180;The detail on this release is eye popping.
1181;Trim and fit with not an ounce of fat with a deep tan to go with his good looks.
1182;There is a scene on the beach after he goes for a swim and you can almost see every hair on his chest, that's how pristine this blu.
1183;She had a lot of freckles.
1184;up, but you can clearly see the ones on her chest in the scene she has with Grant when she wants him to look at the necklace she's wearing.
1185;That's the brilliance of this blu.
1186;She was a beautiful woman and a very good actress.
1187;She made eleven films between 1951 and 1956 before retiring to become a real life Princess.
1188;And many thanks to the great restoration team at Paramount Home Video.
1189;another great classic film to watch, i enjoy it very dearly.
1190;and such a great price.
1191;i'll advise everyone to watch it
1192;This blu ray version of this classic movie is eye candy all the way through.
1193;The scenery is absolutely incredible.
1194;I have been there and that is a lot of the pleasure at seeing this beautiful place again.
1195;The movie is spectacular and one wishes to have been there at the time.
1196;They look like they are having a very good time shooting it and I certainly did have one watching it.
1197;John Williams is a suitably whimsical insurance agent willing to go along with Robie's plan to catch the thief in the act.
1198;Grace Kelly is gorgeous as the daughter of a rich women who is an obvious target for the thief.
1199;The scenery is still the star and the chief reason to see the movie.
1200;Sir Alfred Hitchcock made a suspenseful, funny and romantic crime movie, that lives by excellent actors.
1201;Excellent actors, great location shots, weak plot, some good dialogue but not enough, pedestrian directing by Hitchcock who I think is vastly overrated.
1202;If you like Hitchcock and Grant you'll love this movie!
1203;Sit down, relax and enjoy the scenery of France.
1204;Alfred's greatness shows in this movie.
1205;A great classic I love these two actors and really enjoyed watching them on screen together good memories!
1206;I would recommend this movie to all those who love classics!
1207;Everything a movie should be to entertain and not embarrass one.
1208;I love nearly all of Hitchcock films, but this one is his best for sheer viewing pleasure.
1209;Think about it, in this film you have beautiful scenes of the French Riviera, Grace Kelly looking absolutely stunning in some amazing outfits and Cary Grant as well.
1210;What can I say about an Alfred Hitchcock film starring Cary Grant and Grace Kelly, set in the south of France, that hasn't been said before?Marvelous, it's one of my favorite films of all times, great comedy.
1211;Jessie Royce Landis as Grace Kelly's nouveau rich, great.
1212;hearted mother is funny and fabulous!
1213;The stars are superb and the background, both the Cote d'Azur as background to the story and the real.
1214;life background of Grace Kelly's meeting Prince Rainier during filming, make it all the more enjoyable.
1215;If you have never seen it, you should!
1216;This is a good Cary Grant movie.
1217;It's good to watch when you're home sick and don't have anything else to do.
1218;I've been watching Hitchcock's films in chronological order, and had just seen the wonderfully and carefully restored Rear Window from the Alfred Hitchcock Masterpiece Collection.
1219;As they showed the difference between what they started with and the final product, it was truly significant.
1220;this version of To Catch a Thief is similar to the unrestored version of Rear Window, and this film with so many stunning on.
1221;location views and vistas of the Riviera and its elegant hotels and chateaus .
1222;which contributed to its color staff winning an Oscar .
1223;deserves the full restoration treatment.
1224;Very fun and beautiful to watch Grace Kelly is so elegant.
1225;Cary Grant is so classy.
1226;Definitely a favorite that wil be watched over and over again.
1227;there is a lot of chemistry between Cary Grant and Grace Kelly.
1228;it keeps you in suspense till the end when it is discovered who the real cat burglar is.
1229;The stars shine bright in this one.
1230;I really enjoyed the movie.
1231;Some of the older movies are the best.
1232;Hitchcock did wonders with the lighting in some of the scenes.
1233;I have always enjoyed Alfred Hitchcock films and this movie is no exception.
1234;I've seen it many times and really looked forward to adding it to my movie collection.
1235;It had 2 BIG things going for it, the suspense (at which Hitchcock is an expert) and it stars Cary Grant and I love to watch him!
1236;It seemed to me it moved very slowly, that there was much too much time and emphasis put on Cary Grants characters' past and how much a great number of people disliked him.
1237;This was touched on in the movie for about 3 seconds.
1238;It is a real CLASSIC!!
1239;Excellent, would recommend to anyone to at least watch once.
1240;thank You Amazon for offering it.
1241;Excellent old fashioned movie with a good story line!
1242;It is pleasant to watch these movies, they do not rely on all of the high tech gadgetry of today's movies.
1243;Grace Kelley is incredibly seductive.
1244;One of my favorite Cary Grant movies.
1245;Good story, well acted, beautiful scenery.
1246;Of course, Grace Kelly is beautiful as well.
1247;The whole movie is easy on the eyes!
1248;There is no denying that Hitchcock captures Grant's and Kelly's performances and the south of France so eloquently.
1249;Furthermore it was enjoyable hearing the French speak French.
1250;"Hitchcock, Cary Grant, fantastic color, beautiful scenery (including Grace Kelly)
1251;This is one of those timeless movies that captivates you again each time you watch it.
1252;From the superb directing of Alfred Hitchcock, the graceful acting of the stars, Cary Grant and Grace Kelly, to the dramatic twists and turns of the plot, this movie is thoroughly relaxing and enjoyable.
1253;It's also a great New Year's Eve movie with its romance and fireworks.
1254;Actors in other movies can be seen watching it like in Sleepless in Seattle , another great movie for New Year's Eve.
1255;Looks great in home theater.
1256;This film has it all : great acting, humor, witty dialogue, beautiful scenery, great plot, action, and romance.
1257;It's my favorite Hitchcock movie by far.
1258;Two of Hollywood's most beautiful and talented people of all time make this a definite classic.
1259;The story line is interesting and the humor is dry and appreciated, a classy Pink Panther .
1260;A fascinating twist and turn Hitchcock mystery, and breathtaking photography!!!!
1261;This is a wonderful movie.
1262;Cary Grant is a compelling former thief who stumbles upon the lovely, rich Grace Kelly.
1263;There is a delicious mystery involved, but no murder or mayhem.
1264;I have always liked Alfred Hitchcock and love Cary Grant and Grace Kelly.
1265;Great movie for people who love classics.
1266;I really enjoyed this film.
1267;It showed good character development between the two main characters in the film, Grace Kelly's and Cary Grant's.
1268;The film brought intrigue and good tempo, it wasn't slow and boring in trying to develop its plot.
1269;I enjoyed it for its sense of style, its cinematography, and its attempt to show the world's most wealthiest region that it too can have some excitement!
1270;One of the very best films of all times!!!
1271;Clever romantic comedy with truths that stay true at all times.
1272;Anyone can watch this movie.
1273;Hitchcock's outstanding chase flick is blessed with sharp dialogue, marvelous locations, stellar casting and a really solid screenplay.
1274;Bottom line: The movie is worth its weight in gold.
1275;This isn't the best of the Hitchcock films as their isn't much suspense, but Grant and Kelly are terrific, and terrific together, and the film is great fun.
1276;I HIGHLY recommend this timeless Hitchcok classic, in it's all NEWLY RESTORED version!!!!
1277;Scenery was beautiful as is Grace Kelly.
1278;One of the (many) iconic Cary Grant romantic mystery comedy/dramas.
1279;This flick is delightful without being predictable: a chick.
1280;flick that guys can also appreciate .
1281;Excellent supporting actors make the story believable and charming.
1282;This a really good movie!
1283;The glamour of Grace Kelly combined with the undeniable leading man, Cary Grant makes for original eye candy.
1284;Add in Hitchock's twists and humorous turns and you have a treat the whole family will love.
1285;get the popcorn out and enjoy.
1286;We enjoy Europe and the French Riveria is a great place to see in the background throughout the story.
1287;Two great stars and beautiful people.
1288;The costumes and the settings are wonderful.
1289;This movie has always has been one of my all time favorites and glad to see that Amazon has it available.
1290;Classic romance, beautiful people, great acting terrific direction, engaging story.
1291;starring the legendary Cary Grant and the lovely princess Grace Kelly in dazzling outfits and set in the French Rivera.
1292;Probably fits the expectations during the time frame of the original movie.
1293;And, Hitchcock always knew how to bring humor and suspense to the screen.
1294;These are the timeless classics.
1295;Cary Grant is as dapper as ever in this somewhat more light.
1296;biter like """"Psycho"""", but engrossing nonetheless."""
1297;If you've seen and like North by Northwest you will also enjoy this movie.
1298;Great movies without all the crazy stuff we have to endure in movies now.
1299;"Wonderful photography of the French Riveria, tiled rooftops, medieval towns hunched together on mountaintops
1300;I was amazed at how sharp and colorful the picture is on this edition, better than some bluerays out there.
1301;Also this is a great movie, in a series of great movies Hitchcock made in the 50's beginning with Dial M For Murder and ending,imo, with North By Northwest.
1302;This movie is much lighter than the rest, and while some dislike it for that reason, that's why it's a favorite to me.
1303;Gary Grant was great as usual.
1304;Grace Kelly definitely the classic beauty but overplayed slightly.
1305;Her mom was the best character though.
1306;full of fun, danger, and suspence, this suspenceful thriller shows how Hollywood used to make a romantic movie.
1307;Let us be glad we have means of saving these classics for our future entertainment!!!!
1308;LOVE, love, love this movie.
1309;What a great price for a hard to find movie.
1310;this classic thriller filmed in Monaco has suspense, beauty and wit.
1311;i loved the gorgeous dresses of Grace Kelly.
1312;A must see, good family entertainment.
1313;thief(Grant)and the lovely American girl(Kelly) who falls in love with him.
1314;grant at 50 is at his debonair best playing John Robie, The Cat.
1315;Thanks to a French professor of mine who encourages our class to watch classics, such as those of Hitchcock, I have been exploring what there is to watch with my Amazon Prime membership.
1316;Beautiful setting"
1317;Truly a classic and one of my favorite Hitchcock movies.
1318;Grace Kelly was a gorgeous woman.
1319;"Thank goodness they remade this Hitchcock film
1320;Wonderful pairing of two of the glossiest stars of the 50s when Hollywood excelled at just this kind of movie.
1321;Of course there must be a love interest: Grace Kelly, perfectly cast, the quintessential blonde actress who spawned an entire genre of look.
1322;timers offering their memories, and more.You get more than your money's worth on this one.
1323;Two of the most beautiful people on the planet ever.
1324;The scenery and the storyline are pretty good too.
1325;Cary Grant as a retired cat burglar romances Grace Kelly in this whodunnit tale set in Monte Carlo and on the French Riviera.
1326;While not one of Hitchcock's finest, it still merits a number of viewings for the beautiful people and scenery.
1327;Wonderful picture and color clarity.
1328;A classic movie that is timeless.
1329;The fireworks that explode as Grant and Kelly make sparks .
1330;:) They special effects fireworks have always grated .
1331;a good movie for a lazy weekend.
1332;I love the old classics!
1333;It is very well acted.
1334;it is fun to watch the """"oldies"""" with all the great stars of yesteryear."""
1335;Love the cool and elegant Cary Grant, and the rest of the cast is fine.
1336;It's the witty banter that always make a great rom.
1337;This movie is pure entertainment.
1338;Hitchcock loved Grace Kelly, Cary Grant, food and the south of France, and it all shows here.
1339;They must have had a wonderful time making this terrific film and we are lucky to have this record of it.
1340;grace Kelly must have been about 25, pristinely lovely as a white gardenia in full bloom.
1341;She's more than just a beautiful blond though and brings something of charm and intelligence of the mature woman she is on the verge of becoming.
1342;Cary Grant, ultra tan as was the fashion at that time, is still very handsome and, at 50, is almost mesmerizingly charming.
1343;The chemistry between the two, despite the age difference, is terrific.
1344;At first Grant holds back, being a gentleman, but Kelly pursues and at the end, she catches her thief.
1345;to me this is more of a love story than a mystery and I didn't care in the least who the real cat burglar was.
1346;the censorship of the 50's was much more strict than in our times, which, I think, heightened the charm of the romance.
1347;Alone together in her hotel room, with Kelly looking like a goddess from the moon in her white chiffon dress, one wonders how Grant can keep his cool for as long as he does.
1348;It may sound corny but it is tremendously effective and very sweet.
1349;Bring back Romance!The visuals are splendid.
1350;there's plenty of beauty to fill up every screen, whether it's shots of the blue blue sea, French chefs in mile.
1351;"In the opening credits, a travel poster brags, ""If you love life, you'll love France!"""
1352;I think that pretty much sums up this picture.
1353;It's a great addition to my collection.
1354;When will we ever see stars of this caliber again .
1355;this is classic Hitchcock Hollywood, with dialogue and a plot to boot.
1356;Thank you for migrating this film to Blue Ray .
1357;I love the fact that they made this movie together, both of them being so talented and beautiful.
1358;The plot was absolutely awesome.
1359;To Catch a Thief is another wonderful Hitchcock film.
1360;All of his old French underground friends now suspect him as well as the police and the public in general.
1361;Grace Kelly plays the beautiful and sophisticated Frances Stevens, a rich daughter of a very down to earth mother who has a large amount of jewelry that would be a prime target for 'the cat', Cary Grant's character.
1362;Some fine performances by the supporting characters, especially the mother and the insurance investigator, make for a well done and enjoyable movie experience.
1363;i would highly recommend this movie to any old movie or mystery fans!
1364;I was absolutely unfamiliar with Grace Kelly's activities as an actor.
1365;Now I have avery good chance of it.
1366;I liked this particular movie very much.
1367;She is one of the most beautiful women in the entire world.
1368;Kelly and Grant at the pinnacle of their careers.
1369;One of my favorite movies, with tactile and lush technicolor scenes and landscapes you don't find today.
1370;This was my favorite, next to Arsenic and Old Lace, and continues to be so.
1371;A good story, redone several times, all without the elan that Grant brings to it.
1372;I also got why Prince Ranier thought she would make a wonderful princess, as she did.
1373;ray is a real treat.
1374;great chemistry between kelly and grant
1375;Cary Grant is super cool.
1376;beautiful movie, witty, perfectly acted.
1377;one of my favorite movies of all time.
1378;even my boyfriend liked it.
1379;Lightweight Hitch with fun views of Provence.
1380;Great to see a still nimble Grant on the rooftops.
1381;Cary Grant and Grace Kelly really make this movie great.
1382;I put this up there with Rear Window, Vertigo and North By Northwest.
1383;I have loved this movie for years.
1384;This is Cary Grant at his best and is my favorite role that Grace Kelly ever did.
1385;A nice plot that keeps you interested with its twists.
1386;One of my favorite classics.
1387;This is one of my favorite films.
1388;It is beautifully photographed film.
1389;On top of all of that Cary Grant, one of the truly great comedic actors and Grace Kelly, one of the most beautiful and talented actresses, are both in superb form.
1390;Alfred Hitchcock did his usual excellent job of weaving a suspenseful story with a good humored slant.
1391;"Director Alfred Hitchcock was worthy of the title of ""Master of Suspense."""
1392;"while ""To Catch a Thief"" does have the ""wronged man"" scenario, in the guise of Cary Grant's cat burglar trying to prove his innocence, the film is more a showcase for the classy pairing of Grant and co. star Grace Kelly, along with the magnificent allure of The French Riviera, playground of the rich and famous."
1393;featuring luscious scenery and dazzling costumes by the legendary Edith Head, the movie is a feast for the senses and a testament to a time when there were MOVIE STARS.
1394;"the shared scenes of Grant and Kelly together are sheer heaven while John Williams and Jessye Royce Landis put the capital ""C"" and ""A"" in the term character actor."
1395;"the ""extra"" featurettes on the disc are equally as appealing, complete with interviews with Hitch's daughter Patricia and a fascinating profile of Head."
1396;and the restoration of the film makes the French countryside look picture perfect.
1397;Good acting, fun plot, suspenseful, great scenery , they just don't have acting like this anymore.
1398;My teens love his movies.
1399;I enjoyed the movie very much as Gary Grant is an actor I like very much.
1400;The story was good and I would recommend it .
1401;Cary Grant and Grace Kelly have great acting in this film.
1402;I like how easy they make it look to catch a thief.
1403;Thieves who get caught, as we see in this movie.
1404;Cary Grant and Grace Kelly are amazing.
1405;I enjoy the Prime service and one reason is being able to watch classic movies like this one when I want.
1406;The movie is well paced, well presented, and has a great cast.
1407;I would recommend this film to young and old alike.
1408;pop the corn and enjoy.
1409;ray Disc has several great bonuses.
1410;My favorite being, the ability to watch the film as it would be presented in theaters in 1955 (previews, a news reel, one short and two cartoons, before the main feature).
1411;the film itself is presented well, with good PQ and AQ.
1412;This was one to rememberd the color and picture was clear and sharp.
1413;Would recommend for any classic film fan.
1414;Good acting and interesting plot.
1415;I would recommend this movie.
1416;Excellent story telling, a fun story to watch, and Cary Grant/Grace Kelly .
1417;Good old fashioned movie .
1418;the movie filmed in Vistavision(Hitchcock's first in this format)stars the suave,debonair and very much tanned Cary Grant and the soon to be real Princess of Monaco,looking stunning I might add,Grace Kelly.
1419;all outside footage was shot on the French Riviera in and around the Nice area.
1420;and beautiful is the scenery we see throughout.
1421;during the war he was part of the Maquis and became quite famous for his heroic exploits with them.
1422;the local constabulary of course suspect him right away.
1423;robie meets up with a rich American widower Jessie Stevens(Jessie Landis)and her daughter Francie(Kelly).
1424;she gets him invited to a masquerade ball and it is at that event that Grant finally manages to get his man,er crook.
1425;through a lonely vigil on the roof,while the police think he's on the grounds dancing with Francie(it is really the Lloyd's of London man in disguise),he finally comes face to face with the real thief and in the end catches and exonerates himself.
1426;the film ends with Grant and Kelly in a passionate embrace.
1427;ahh,viva la romance!The film,though not a great film,is still very enjoyable throughout and typical Hitchcock.
1428;it has a lot of plot twists and visual turns that keep you guessing throughout.
1429;the scenery in the film is just wonderful and is almost a travelogue in itself.
1430;i would give the film itself four stars but in the technical department and with the features supplied in this set,I have added another star to give it full marks.
1431;the picture has been remastered wonderfully(as have all the films in this series)and the colours are crisp and rich looking.
1432;the second disc of this set contains a real bonanza of riches.
1433;i think you will agree this is a stunning array of extras which makes overall for an even more enjoyable experience.
1434;in conclusion,the film gets a solid four stars and the extras contained therein push it all the way to the max.
1435;an intriguing and interesting plot keeps one guessing throughout the films run.
1436;with this restored print the scenery is shown at its' magnificent best,as are its' cast and two main stars Cary Grant and Grace Kelly.
1437;This is positively one of the most delightful movies ever produced anywhere!
1438;I have enjoyed this film so many times (countless) since it first premiered in the summer of 1955 (I was 14 at the time) that's it's almost unimaginable.
1439;It's like a piece of artwork, there always to be appreciated and enjoyed.
1440;It's like visiting an old friend or even better,a trip back in time to a great period in American Culture and movie making.
1441;A decent old flick if you're looking for one.
1442;Very fine copy of an all time classic.
1443;The lead actors are stunning and the writing is outstanding.
1444;While there are some formula elements to it, such as Hitchcock's obligatory blond, this movie feels fresh and fun after a full 50 years.
1445;It is rightfully viewed as a classic.
1446;sharp script and a charismatic cast.
1447;ray finally does the film justice, rendering its lush, elegant visual landscape with striking vibrancy and detail.
1448;This has to be regarded as something less than a completely successful film.
1449;There are many reasons to watch and enjoy this movie, including the extraordinary location shots and seeing the surreally gorgeous romantic lovers Cary Grant and Grace Kelly.
1450;The helicopter shots of the car chase at the beginning remain among the most breathtaking of the fifties and anticipate some of the visual aspects of the James Bond films.
1451;Many of the suspense scenes in the Bond films utilized many of the narrative techniques that Hitchcock pioneered, but they also utilized the exotic locales utilized in both NOTORIOUS (which was a film, after all, about espionage) and TO CATCH A THIEF.
1452;There is actually a quote of a Hitchcock film in the way that Sean Connery's Bond makes his first appearance.
1453;strip process that provides an unbelievable degree of clarity and detail.
1454;The colors are remarkably vivid and it was made in true stereo.
1455;Some regard it as one of his masterpieces.
1456;I'm definitely in the latter class.
1457;I find the film interesting at times, the location shots mesmerizing, and the two leads delightful, but I find the overall story weak.
1458;A film definitely worth seeing and then seeing again, but not quite up to the level of his greatest films.
1459;on a personal sidenote, I rewatched this with Shirley, one of my two solid black cats .
1460;She bears a striking resemblance to the black cat used in repeated shots in the film.
1461;robie is seen upset, bothered,, and worried because the 'Cat' prowls again.
1462;Surely someone is imitating his old style, using his ability and skill, almost his cleverness and talent.
1463;robie is worried how to catch the real thief being himself subject to harass!
1464;four scenes, depicted by the master of suspense, catch our attention:.
1465;up for clear identification of the police and gendarme who are ready to capture, to hit, to surprise the famous thief.
1466;"top chase sequence between Roby and the thief seen before in ""Saboteur,"" and much later in ""Vertigo,"" and ""North By Northwest."
1467;With meticulous coiffure and fancy clothes, Grace Kelly plays her role with elegance and fashion.
1468;She is gracefully refined and polite showing good taste and style.
1469;the film captures the aerial shooting of the automobile chases on the Riviera Corniche, the Cote D'Azur, the flower market, the grandeur of the rugged coastal scenery, the sea with much sunshine sparkling flashes of wit and gaiety.
1470;It is a pleasant entertainment, a 'Hitchcock Champagne' indeed!Grace Kelly.
1471;contributing with our ideal romantic hero in catching his thief, was in fact scheming to catch him.
1472;so classy and well done.
1473;A mix between romance and suspense as only Hitchcock can do this movie is just so amazing and a worthwhile watch for any old movie buff.
1474;Grant, Kelly and Hitchcock in a classic story set in Monaco.
1475;Just wish all movies were done with this class!
1476;sound is very good for its time.
1477;Excellent film with a great cast who are all dead now.
1478;Enjoyacting when it was so engaging.
1479;there are plenty of scenes in the movie where I experienced, how can I describe it, the illusion of depth and/or three.
1480;To Catch a Thief is just a fun movie to watch time after time!
1481;One can scarcely grow tired of Grants masterful performance of a reformed thief out to defend his now honesty status.
1482;Cary Grant and Grace Kelly are beautifully paired in this film.
1483;It's exciting, mysterious, romantic, and overall entertaining.
1484;The wardrobe is very good and it holds one's interest.
1485;Love this movie, a true classic film.
1486;"Grace Kelly is a natural ""princess."""
1487;Cinematography and location are superb.
1488;All Hitchcock movies are great.
1489;This is one of my most favorite movies and I've seen the older, unrestored version many times.
1490;The new restored version is brighter so you can see more, without losing the classic movie feel.
1491;This shows the film in the vibrant colors the South of France was meant to be seen in and no doubt how Hitchcock hoped to portray the film.
1492;Cary Grant and Grace Kelley are a perfect match and Jessie Royce Landis who plays the mother of Grace's character is hilarious.
1493;"John Williams plays a very worried and doubtful insurance agent for the jewels in danger of being stolen, a perfect foil to Cary's ""Cat Burglar"" character."
1494;It's full of unexpected plot twists and turns and comedy the fashions of Edith Head add that touch of class to a very classy film.
1495;The locations are breathtaking and the high speed chase on those twisty roads with the steep drop.
1496;"offs are suspenseful, aided by the helicopter shots that were the earliest used in the filming
1497;This set comes with such extras as an interview with his daughter who was present during the filming, some background on Edith Head, and background on the making of this highly enjoyable film.
1498;The best that Hitchcock directed.
1499;Great stars and a timeless story.
1500;Cary Grant and Grace Kelly make a great romantic combination and when coupled with Alfred Hitchcock what could be better?
1501;He always inserts himself somewhere in his movies, sometimes more obvious than others.
1502;This is definitely a """"Must Have"""" for those Cary Grant collectors!!!"""
1503;And the Collector's Edition has some nice Extra Features.
1504;"This has always been my favorite movie, as I look at movies as an escape in most cases, and this is really the epitome of an ""escapist"" movie!"
1505;"Brilliant scenery (how can you beat the South of France in the late 50's), beautiful people (Grace Kelley, Cary Grant
1506;The cinematography, location, sets and actors are what really make this such a splendid movie, and the BR version presents all of these in a picture perfect format.
1507;Many reviewers are calling this the best production of any Blu.
1508;ray disc released to date(which is very high praise indeed!)
1509;Great movie beautiful backdrop for the film as well in the French Rivera.
1510;Nice twist at the end as well.
1511;witty dialogue and lines, great chemistry between Grace Kelly and Cary Grant.
1512;brings you back to the mid.
1513;Love the witty conversation, romance and the setting.
1514;This is truly a classic and I would recommend it to everyone.
1515;What I had been most anticipating was viewing the delicious technicolor cinematography which garnered an Academy Award for Robert Burks.
1516;Consider this one great by any measurement.
1517;if you like Cary Grant you will love this movie .
1518;This is one of my favorite movies
1519;Love the easy banter between the characters.
1520;cary Grant is one of my all time favorites.
1521;he is so talented, and it doesn't hurt that he is so easy on the eyes.
1522;This is one of my all time favorite movies!
1523;Our children were introduced to the wonder of Alfred Hitchcock with this movie, and they love it still!
1524;Watch it, you will love it!
1525;Cary Grant and Grace Kelly were beautiful together, even with the large age difference.
1526;The scenery alone makes this movie worth having.
1527;I love anything Hitchcock, and this film is no exception.
1528;A little more frothy and visually enjoyable than most of his films"
1529;if you want a movie that will leave you feeling lighter after you watch it, rather than feeling slightly disturbed, as some of his movies do (although I admit that I enjoy being disturbed quite often), this is the one to do it.
1530;The dialogue between the characters is priceless.
1531;clever, witty, and dated enough to make it new again.
1532;A must for any good movie collection.
1533;A terrific showcase for two Hollywood icons in their prime executing a Hitchcock production!
1534;She saw it on AMC and thought it was funny, and OMG is it funny.
1535;I love these older movies, and Cary Grant is hilarious.
1536;"This 1955 film is Hitchcock's adventure into romantic comedy, or as one critic called it, ""romantic thriller."""
1537;The other thief is so good that many people, even his own comrades and the police, think he is doing it.
1538;It's actually about John Robie (Cary Grant) and Francie (Grace Kelly, in her final movie before moving to Monaco), their exploration of romance and expressions of their love.
1539;the film has all the requisite items in a Hitchcock stew: take a man with a mistaken identity, put in a dash of rich blondes driving fancy cars (very fast, actually) and stir in the atmosphere of the French Riviera.
1540;I mean, it is intriguing to watch Grant as he tries to clear his name and how he tries to pick up on Kelly's character at the same time.
1541;but at the same time is an awesome showcase of Edith Head's costuming, the famous movie costumer working at Paramount at the time.
1542;"i did enjoy the double entendre (""Would you prefer a leg or a breast?"")"
1543;A pretty funny story was told where Mary was studying film and one of Hitchcock's films was one of the subjects (I forget which one, Stranger on a Train I think) and Hitch helped her write a paper on what the director was trying to say in the film.
1544;"Hitchcock saw this and said, ""Well, I did my best!"
1545;Family photos of the Hitchcock family, trailers, interviews with the cast and crew from To Catch a Thief, and a very interesting bio of Edith Head gave awesome film history to anyone interested in the men and women behind the camera.
1546;"He says to Grant, ""here I have something for you""."
1547;And he puts a box on the table.
1548;Great movie, with suspense, romance, and intrigue.
1549;Another excellent addition to the movie collection.
1550;Special features are almost as good as the movie.
1551;Hitchcock made the picture in 1954 during one of his most prolific periods.
1552;The filmmaker's energy is evident in the vividness of the Riviera cinematography (by Oscar winner Robert Burks) and imaginative use of the newly developed VistaVision process.
1553;Cary Grant and Grace Kelly deliver stunningly cool performances .
1554;the carnal nature of their characters' romance (as well as the unmentioned difference in age) adds to the overall lasciviousness.
1555;It's great to watch a movie with a character who was involved in the WWII French Resistance and have it hold up so well, even now.
1556;The acting is wonderful and the plot is engaging and surprising.
1557;Cary Grant and Grace Kelly are funny and witty and they keep you involved in the story.
1558;Nice movie, elegantly shot on Location in Monocco.
1559;Grace Kelly is breathtaking, Cary Grant perfectly cast as the suave former jewel thief.
1560;Great chemistry, beautiful photography, romantic dialogue and costumes to boot!
1561;It also has Cary Grant in a swimsuit on the beach and he wasn't bad for the times and his age.
1562;"While known as ""The Master of Suspense"", director, Alfred Hitchcock stepped into a whole new arena with To Catch A Thief."
1563;This film has mystery, intrigue and romance all set in the exquisite background of the French Riviera.
1564;When his plan backfires, Frances, who believes him guilty, proves her love by helping him escape.
1565;the scenery is breathtaking, the costuming (by the legendary Edith Head) is spectacular and the cinematography garnered the 1955 Academy Award for Best Cinematography.
1566;It also received Oscar nominations for Best Costume Design and Best Art Direction/Set Decoration.
1567;the romantic chemistry between Grant and Kelly is palpable.
1568;The extra featurettes are also worthy of checking out and includes an interview with Mr. Hitchcock's daughter Patricia, a wonderful profile of Edith Head.
1569;I love everything by Alfred Hitchcock!
1570;This is a marvelously suspenseful tale in a beautiful location!
1571;I never knew what to expect from one moment to the next, including Mr. Hitchcock's appearance on the back of the bus!
1572;Women are complex, they are bold drivers of cars and boats and they climb roofs to be jewel thieves!
1573;Grace Kelly is gorgeous as well as talented and Edith Head's magnificient wardrobe still inspires me.
1574;This film is a great and fun classic!
1575;Cary Grant was as good as he gets in this.
1576;Good story with good cinematography.
1577;A wonderful show directed by Hitchcock.
1578;This is one of my favorite old time movies.
1579;This film has it all.
1580;Great stars, great director and a witty and entertaining script.
1581;I love CG so I love all his movies.
1582;they make me smile, make me think of good things, and just happy
1583;I'm a huge Hitchcock fan and I like Grace Kelly and Cary Grant.
1584;Grace Kelly is as always lovely to look at, and the French riviera is stunning.
1585;But the story and acting certainly don't linger in the mind.
1586;I give it 3 stars for the leads and scenery.
1587;This is a classic Cary Grant with the suspense and romantic tension that he is known for.
1588;This film shows Hitchcock in a playful rather than macabre mood and calls to mind the screwball comedies of the 1930's.
1589;the two stars exchange a considerable amount of witty repartee.
1590;Kelly, for instance, at her verbal best, rejects Grant's lie that he's a wealthy lumberman from Oregon.
1591;Such a combination of brains and beauty sweep Grant pretty quickly off his feet.
1592;A classic ensuing scene of romance, punctuated by exploding fireworks, says it subtly and says it all.
1593;the supporting cast includes many veteran scene stealers.
1594;In a memorable bit of Hitchcock business, she closes in on a room service breakfast tray, surprisingly and hilariously extinguishing her cigarette, of all places, in the yolk of a sunny side up egg.
1595;Presumably, to this clever, wealthy American abroad, the world is her ashtray.
1596;If you watch a movie to be entertained, and see beautiful scenes continuously, this is the movie for you.
1597;Nothing heavy or challenging, just unvarnished natural beauty, this is the one for you!
1598;This is my all time favorite movie.
1599;I just saw this movie for the first time and loved it!
1600;you will also if you give it 2 hours of your time
1601;winning color photography by the renowned Robert Burks on location on the French Riviera, the movie is like a relaxing travelogue.
1602;The screenplay is by the great John Michael Hayes, who had just done REAR WINDOW (1954) for Hitchcock.
1603;"In a romantic mystery vein, THIEF is the perfect Hitchcock movie for viewers who like romantic mysteries with picturesque settings, but can't deal with graphic violence
1604;we have Hitchcock's favorite leading man and leading lady here, Cary Grant and Grace Kelly, at their most glamorous.
1605;Jessie Royce Landis, always fun in Hitchcock films, plays Kelly's mother.
1606;Her jewels are stolen, and Grace is positive Grant took them.
1607;And the incredible love scene in a darkened room with kisses on a couch while spectacular fireworks go off outside the window like an epic orgasm.
1608;new one in VistaVision and with several informative documentary bonuses.
1609;Not a Hitchcock masterpiece, this is delightful, suspenseful, and scenic romantic mystery escapism that is still better than most lesser filmmakers' best work.
1610;Highly recommended for fans of the genre and this greatest of all directors.
1611;Definitely a period piece with Cary Grant and Grace Kelly at their best.
1612;I return to this film every few years to get the vibe all over again.
1613;however, the style of this new crime wave is certainly his.
1614;The above is a close.
1615;In order to do this, he """"unofficially"""" enlists the aid of an insurance agent (John Williams) and a rich, widower (Jessie Royce Landis) and her daughter (Grace Kelly)."""
1616;"this movie (a romantic thriller) is based on the novel ""To Catch a Thief"" (1952) by David Dodge."
1617;"It was directed by the ""master of suspense,"" Alfred Hitchcock."
1618;this movie is filled with witty dialogue.
1619;"Here's an example just after some jewels have again been stolen on the French Riviera and the thief is again thought to be John Robie by a French woman Robie is talking to:French woman: ""Last night you steal a small fortune, and today you lie on the beach with an American beauty [the rich widower`s daughter]."
1620;The acting is fantastic with Grant Cary (whose birth name was Archie Leach) being debonair, charismatic, and charming.
1621;Grace Kelly (being 25 years younger than Grant) holds her own with Grant.
1622;I also liked the performances by John Williams and Jessie Royce Landis.
1623;There are also some French actors that appear in this movie.
1624;The French actress (Brigitte Auber), whose character (she's the French woman alluded to in the witty dialogue above) is integral to the plot, gives a good performance.
1625;the cinematography is in a word.
1626;The colour of this movie is beautiful.
1627;If you have a large widescreen television to view this movie, then you're in for an incredible experience, (I also envy you.)
1628;There is some French spoken in the movie.
1629;Now the French actors do a good job through their movements and expressions of conveying what is said.
1630;(Note that the first words Cary Grant speaks are in French.)
1631;Watch this movie to see for yourself why it is a true classic!!
1632;"Hitchcock's next film after Rear Window is a breezy light comedy about a former jewel thief John Robie (Cary Grant) and a rich young American woman Frances ""Francie"" Stevens (Grace Kelly) traveling the Riviera with her mother Mrs. Stevens (Jessie Royce Landis)."
1633;At first Francie is attracted to Robie because she gets a sexual thrill out of the idea of romancing and then catching a thief, especially a thief as handsome and sophisticated as embodied by Mr. Grant.
1634;"This picture has all the great Hitchcock touches that have become his trademarks: the beautiful playgrounds of the very rich, a handsome cast all dressed to perfection by Edith Head, enough action and plot twists to keep things moving along at a nice clip, and the ""surprise"" ending when the real thief is revealed."
1635;Add all that with screenwriter John Michael Hayes's witty and sexually charged dialogue (filled with double entendres) and you have a movie movie that is tough to beat.
1636;If Rear Window elevated Kelly to superstar status, To Catch A Thief helped solidify and perfect her image as the hot and cold running blond of the 1950s.
1637;The cast is in top form, with Landis turning in a great comic performance that is both witty and profound.
1638;The color cinematography won an Academy Award for capturing the beauty of the Riviera (and it is picture.
1639;This film is a must for Hitchcock, Grant, and Kelly fans, and for anyone else who enjoys a movie for which popcorn was invented.
1640;I love this movie and being in blu.
1641;Now I can watch it in had making the experience even better.
1642;Grant and Kelly shine with beautiful visuals and clever dialogue.
1643;A great choice for fans of classic films.
1644;This is a movie at its best!
1645;Lovely and handsome actors/actresses in it, so pleasing to the eye.
1646;Iwouldn't recommend it to anyone, as my opinion is not the general one as this movie is quite old and well respected.
1647;It has some beautiful scenery (south of France), great actors and an interesting plot.
1648;A classic Hitchcock film, To Catch A Thief is a sexy movie that sizzles with adventures and chemistry between its two leads.
1649;Grant once said Grace Kelly was his favorite co. star he ever worked with in films.
1650;paced, filled with Grant's trademark wit and banter, and Grace Kelly is absolutely gorgeous as the woman who falls for Grant's irresistable charm.
1651;fire classic that's guaranteed to entertain!
1652;Lighthearted crime caper, stunning visuals of the French Riviera, a very natural and polished performance by Cary Grant.
1653;Any one who is a Cary Grant Fan, will love this movie.
1654;With Grace Kelly, who is also super actress, you will enjoy this wonderful movie.
1655;If you love Alfred Hitchcock, you will LOVE this movie!
1656;A classic from the word go.
1657;I love Alfred Hitchcock films and I love Cary Grant so this was just another addition to my collection!
1658;We watched it recently with the wind blowing, snow falling, a little wine, a nice warm blanket to keeps us warm and even though we have seen it several times it was a great evening.
1659;I highly recommend the movie, the wine, the blanket and someone you love.
1660;Cary Grant is at his best.
1661;Beautifully filmed, good acting, marvelous sets, great direction, and above all Grace Kelly, just watching her I feel great . . . I love just keeping the movie going, on and on . . .
1662;This film offers a romantically indulging escape to Cannes.
1663;Cary Grant and Grace Kelly are a great team in this film as well.
1664;I had to watch it twice!
1665;WONDERFUL movie and it was fun trying to figure out who the bad guy was!
1666;There is a great scene when Grace Kelly was racing a gorgeous sports car down a mountain road coming close to going of the side several times.
1667;Great scenery, interesting storyline, Hitchcock classic, Cary Grant and Grace Kelly were superb.
1668;A true Hitchcock gem that makes you want to go back to the 1950s French Riviera.
1669;Cary Grant was wonderful as always and Grace Kelly lives up to her name.
1670;Hichcock is the master of suspence, watch for his scene, it is rather comic.
1671;[He always puts himself breifly in his movies.]
1672;Well THAT was a bit off But I really liked this movie and think you will too.
1673;clear picture, start to finish.
1674;as for the color, see for yourself.
1675;Well, the two most beautiful people who ever lived look even more beautiful.
1676;If you're as nuts about Hitchcock as I am, it really is worth the upgrade.
1677;Pretty light stuf, half comedy and half suspense but mostly the former.
1678;Hitchcock always places himself in all his movies in subtle ways but this time he does so in a blatant and hilarious way.
1679;Handsome, smooth and cool all the time .
1680;I like him in comedies but his dramatic roles are good too.
1681;This film has the royalty of Hollywood in it.
1682;, Grace Kelly at her most beautiful, and Alfred Hitchcock(ok, he appears for a few seconds and he is not beautiful) appear in one of the most famous films in history.
1683;Simple elegance, fineness, style and Grace (Kelly.
1684;what appears to be a simple story evolves into the kind of intrigue and suspense that we expect from Alfred Hitchcock.
1685;so well done that I didn't get it .
1686;right up until 'Hitch' was ready to give it away.
1687;When writers and directors had a high regard for the intelligence of their audience.
1688;I highly recommended that anyone looking for older movies to use this distributor.
1689;The outside scenes, like them swimming out to the dock, feel like you're right there with them in the water.
1690;The blu ray is certainly an improvement and I'm glad I stepped up and bought this excellent classic.
1691;Original story, casting and acting were very strong.
1692;end thrill and excitement throughout.
1693;"Stars 2 of the world's most famous actors for the silver screen
1694;I honestly think this is Princess Grace's best film, and never was she more beautiful and stunning.
1695;They both should have won Oscar's for this movie.
1696;Now, this film met all of Hitchcock's usual standards, and, in my opinion, was just as good as the other 1959 Masterpiece, North By Northwest, which you will absolutely LOVE if you loved this one.
1697;I love classic movies, the fashion, dialogue and the exotic scenery.
1698;My favorite all time movie!
1699;The French Riviera, an Alfred Hitchcock movie!
1700;This movie has both of these great motion picture giants at the peak of their powers.
1701;I remember seeing this movie in the theaters when it first came out and it was glorious.
1702;There was beautiful Riviera scenery,gorgeous gowns on graceful Grace Kelly, and (swoon) Cary Grant .
1703;There was a bit of mystery to carry the characters to an eventual happy ending.
1704;After all, he was still technically on parole.
1705;Grace Kelly provides the romantic interest.
1706;one classic movie that everyone has to watch
1707;It was very exciting plot.
1708;The fact that you can put subtitles to understand every word makes the movie even better.
1709;It is still a great movie.
1710;This is a fun movie.
1711;It has humor, romance, intrigue and an interesting story.
1712;Wrap all this up and film it on the French Rivera with two classic old time movie stars and you have a film that is just a joy to watch.
1713;The colors are incredile and the images are sharp This movie is a classic.
1714;The srevice was also great.
1715;Nevertheless, it's an essential, if minor, Hitchcock classic.
1716;cary Grant and Grace Kelly give marvelous, witty performances and capture the light touch of screenwriter John Michael Hayes.
1717;His script is a great deal of fun and Hitch's usual targets are skewered well.
1718;the direction is nimble and the film fairly well paced.
1719;Really, this is a romantic thriller with the emphasis on romantic.
1720;The chases sequences are well designed and shot.
1721;One of my favorite movies.
1722;It's always a treat to see where Hitch will appear.
1723;It is one of the best.
1724;ray has made this pure beauty to see.
1725;The scenery is absolutely FANTASTIC.
1726;I highly recommend this movie.
1727;A movie everyone should have in their library.
1728;The scenery of the Riviera beautiful, one of Alfred Hitchcock's best efforts.
1729;classic movie, Got to be one of the best ever.
1730;Grace Kelly is one of the most beautiful women ever
1731;This is particularly noticeable in the ball sequence, where VistaVision's brilliant detail displays the jewelry and costumes in their opulent glory.
1732;the Lyn Murray score is //the best// of any of Hitch's non.
1733;ray edition shows why it's the best of his comic films.
1734;classy, saucy and a refined lady.
1735;I can see why the Prince wanted her for his bride.
1736;I love Hitchcock but I NEVER want to watch this film again.
1737;I visited Monaco and remembered the lovely scenes from this movie so decided to watch it again, The acting of both Grace Kelly and Cary Grant is outstanding.
1738;Of course this is a classic.
1739;but the best scene is at Grace Kelly's door, when Cary Grant says good night to her.
1740;How can anyone not love the beautiful scenery of the riviera, two great stars, an intriguing story, and so many memories of Princess Grace?
1741;I loved it then and I love it now!
1742;With Hitchcock directing Cary Grant and Grace Kelly, you already know it's going to be a stylish and suspenseful story.
1743;If she can just find where to put a quarter in the slot, he'll put on his amusing show for her.
1744;grant, Kelly, and Hitchcock (including his famous cameo, out of the way early so people will just watch the movie) make this a classic.
1745;Part of it takes place in a bistro where the staff's backgrounds are as checkered as the tablecloths, but their shady pasts (like Grant's) are forgivable because they were heroes in the French resistance.
1746;When Grant's supposed relapse into crime threatens their paroles, it adds one more force to the dramatic convergence.
1747;other points identify this movie as a product of its time, including the effects.
1748;Still the style is true to its time, and a lot more true to what un.
1749;it's a good movie from another age .
1750;but it really is of another age.
1751;Modern viewers will see it as retro or nostalgic, when it was meant to be immediate and thrilling.
1752;But mostly, it's still a good movie.
1753;Such a great movie of its time.
1754;Interesting to see Grace Kelly in the movie shot in Monaco, when she met her Prince!
1755;Cary Grant is of course, Cary Grant.
1756;Solid Hitchcock film worth checking out if you like the other two I mentioned.
1757;unless it is to be in the hands of a master so confident of his abilties that he stops pushing, lets up on the throtle and just lets tumble out of him the instinctively great within him.
1758;in to catch a thief you have a hitchcock at the hieght of his carreer, in between cinematic triumphs, and endowed with stars, and settings to compliment his impecable style.
1759;In thier roles of support in hitchcock movies actors and settings can easily be thought of as the orchestra undergirding the soloist in a brilliant violin concerto.
1760;his use of camera, music, economy of dialogue, veiled eccentricity of character really take the engine of the exotic romantic comedy and lifts it far beyond where had ever been before or is likely ever to go again.
1761;then of course there is, grace kelley.
1762;there are many things about this movie to enjoy.
1763;Kelly and Grant both play the exact same persona they are known for, but do so perfectly.
1764;There is romance, humor, and a whole lot of tuxedos/gowns.
1765;overall, this is very much more of a light.
1766;It has a bit of decent plot, but this one is all about the actors and their high.
1767;If you like that kind of filmmaking, then this one will be a real treat for you.
1768;Cary Grant and Grace Kelley make a fine couple and the scenery is beautiful.
1769;Nothing very interesting happens, but I won't complain.
1770;The views of the French Riviera are wonderful and the actors are fine.
1771;Enjoy this good looking film.
1772;Lots of flowers and lots of French.
