I:13849;1;"a ""once in a lifetime job."
I:13849;2;The plot is great, the Spanish is also really easy to pick up since the actors speaker exceptionally clearly.
I:13849;3;"That Argentinian ""jsho"" for ""yo"" is really audible :)The movie is an all around great film for most everyone."
I:13849;4;I received this for Christmas and we watched it Christmas night.
I:13849;5;It was compelling enough to keep us watching until 2:00AM.
I:13849;6;it is a solid con game picture.
I:13849;7;There were some good twists, but overall I had a feeling of having seen similar deceptions in other movies.
I:13849;8;as others here have pointed out, the acting was impeccable .
I:13849;9;"all actors unknown to this American and all rather ""real"" looking ."
I:13849;10;finally, the filming on location in Argentina (presumably Buenos Aires) was exciting and pleasing.
I:13849;11;The movie is full of those tricky situations and turnarounds most people enjoy, you get the feel that you don't know what's gonna happen next and that's what makes it so entertaining: it makes you want to see what's gonna happen next.
I:13849;12;It's extremely ingenious and fun, totally worth a try.
I:13849;13;Thought I'd give that a try as well.
I:13849;14;'Nine Queens' gives you the intrigue and twists and cons of Mamet, stripped away of the irritation.
I:13849;15;the movie itself is a finely crafted, guilty pleasure.
I:13849;16;a perfect blend of arrogance, confidence and bluff.
I:13849;17;Action movie, full of great paradoxes that you will love !
I:13849;18;Also Ricardo Darin'sgreat executed character will leave you enjoying every minute of it !
I:13849;19;I ordered2 other movies with him, great actor in great films !
I:13849;20;I'm not sure what the budget of this film was, andI'm sure the very professional and excellent actors and crew werewell.
I:13849;21;line and direction are whatmake this film, and the actors are so well.
I:13849;22;ricardo Darin and Gaston Pauls are fascinating and marvelous.
I:13849;23;I'll letyou decide for yourselves whether there's any transcendent message inthis film, but even without, it's some serious fun.
I:13849;24;"But the story in ""Nine Queens"", written and directed by Fabian Bielinsky as the winner of a Project Greenlight."
I:13849;25;One is a seasoned pro, the other a small.
I:13849;26;And each is very talented at getting what he wants.
I:13849;27;Crooks carry guns and use means other than their wit and mental agility to score.
I:13849;28;There are plenty, and much of the fun of this movie is watching it unfold.
I:13849;29;the movie even works on a level if you don't care about the mystery what is really going on.
I:13849;30;Toward the beginning, each sequence exposes you to a series of one.
I:13849;31;the final enjoyable aspect of this film is the acting performances.
I:13849;32;Strong performances by the three leads, as they're able to glide through this movie with slick moves and even slicker tongues.
I:13849;33;While it's tried in most Hollywood films, it works in this one due to the strong script.
I:13849;34;The words match the characters.
I:13849;35;all in all, this is a comedy about trust.
I:13849;36;But most of all, for the director, it's about trust in your audience.
I:13849;37;Just after you feel that you're supposed to get a twist, the film will let you revel in it for a beat, then expose it to all its glory.
I:13849;38;In no movie I've seen has this worked so satisfyingly well.
I:13849;39;And the audience is richly rewarded.
I:13849;40;This Argentine film has to be one of the great con movies.
I:13849;41;intricate, funny, difficult to see where it's going, and satisfying.
I:13849;42;He's willing to show Juan the ropes.
I:13849;43;It involves the nine queens, a sheet of stamps from the Weimar Republic, defective, rare and extremely valuable.
I:13849;44;Marcos and Juan need a set of forged stamps, which they can get, and the real stamps, which they can get but only for a high price.
I:13849;45;First, to really follow the intricate plot.
I:13849;46;Marcos' lecture to Juan about all those scammers has a point that you'll look back on with a smile.
I:13849;47;hand remark or bit of background history later becomes important to a piece of action.
I:13849;48;Why this movie is so good is that the first time you watch it you're taken off guard by the scams within scams.
I:13849;49;But the second time, it's sheer pleasure in seeing how these scams are being set up.
I:13849;50;the actors do a fine job.
I:13849;51;Pauls brings a combination of innocence, likeability and shrewdness to the role.
I:13849;52;You might find the final con a stretch, but it's satisfying.
I:13849;53;This is the type of movie that represents life in Latin America.
I:13849;54;"It's the living example of the ""survival of the fittest"" in a human context."
I:13849;55;Original and good in capturing the attention of the viewer.
I:13849;56;I watched this movie some years ago and after ten times of it I still enjoy the vocabulary, camera movements and actor/actresses performances.
I:13849;57;It's not the best movie at all, but it's a very good option if you want to have humor, intelligence and intrigue on your screen for a couple of hours.
I:13849;58;hey, we like our independent films.
I:13849;59;jean plays the innocent street urchin brilliantly, while marcos is even better as the man who always tries to screw everybody.
I:13849;60;while i call it brilliant, there weren't too many surprises in this double.
I:13849;61;pretty much just guess at the opposite of what is happening and you're right.
I:13849;62;but it was still a brilliant piece of filmmaking.
I:13849;63;An incredible opportunity seems to fall into their laps out of nowhere.
I:13849;64;Marcos (Ricardo Darin), jaded and experienced, and Juan (Gaston Pauls), with his open, friendly manner, are fascinating characters, constantly jockeying for advantage and looking for an angle.
I:13849;65;A delightful piece of entertainment.
I:13849;66;An outstanding movie about a couple of Argentinean cons who are out to swindle everyone they encounter.
I:13849;67;The lead actors portray Juan and Marcos as a couple of loveable bad guys that will amaze you with the tricks they pull to get money.
I:13849;68;A friendship develops and soon they are showing each other their best tricks and plan a major scam involving a forged copy of a valuable stamp set, the nine queens.
I:13849;69;The film is brilliant, extremely well written and moves at a fast pace that keeps you guessing throughout the movie.
I:13849;70;Part of the beauty of this film is the bright script(it was a winner in a national script writting contest) that keeps you wondering what the heck is going on.
I:13849;71;If you like movies where you play mind games with the movie trying to figure it out than you will love this movie.
I:13849;72;It is a delightful , witty caper movie that is fresh and totally entertaining.
I:13849;73;Highly recommended cinema from Argentina that is equal or better than the best from Hollywood.
I:13849;74;It is well crafted, well interpreted and well produced.
I:13849;75;The characters are quite believable.
I:13849;76;If you shake hands with these scam artists count your fingers before leaving the meeting :.)
I:13849;77;"A series of events leads to them working together to sell a set of forged postage stamps, the ""nine queens"" of the title, to a collector, but things become complicated when it turns out that the collector is staying at the same hotel where Marcos's sister works."
I:13849;78;NUEVA REINAS comes to us from Argentina as a highly polished jewel of a film.
I:13849;79;Based on a script that is as nuanced as any written for suspense films today, this caper (or serires of capers) is riveting and holds your attention from the beginning to the end (or is it an end?)
I:13849;80;"The fun of this movie is the quirky twists and turns that are not only part of the ""play it as it lays"" language of these men, they are also outside alternative hapenstances that propel the convoluted plot along."
I:13849;81;Movies that leave you with a feeling that you need to see it again in order to figure out where you lost track of the plot succession are a true joy: they make us an integral part of the grifter's scam.
I:13849;82;The cast is uniformly superb, the cinematography and direction and editing are all excellent.
I:13849;83;Hop on for the ride!
I:13849;84;this is a great film.
I:13849;85;see it if you like caper movies.
I:13849;86;Quite simply stupendous with constant tension and superb acting.
I:13849;87;inside this world of thieves, gangsters, pimps, liars, corrupts and fakers we realize this is a real urban jungle, where every one of us has to survive at any price.
I:13849;88;black humor, existential hopeless shake hands around their lives.
I:13849;89;a dynamic and agile script will involve the spectator until the clever finale.
I:13849;90;Ever since I began studying the Influence methods, I truly enjoy seeing and reseeing con movies, because you can really tell how well documented the movie is in this aspect.
I:13849;91;nine Queens is not only an encyclopedia in con techniques, but is also so well acted.
I:13849;92;This is a brilliant film.
I:13849;93;It is about an ultimate con, one that comes along once in a lifetime, to paraphrase one of the characters.
I:13849;94;The ending (even if you get a part of it earlier on) will still make you want to see the movie again and again, just to see where the clues were.
I:13849;95;It is so much better.
I:13849;96;The idea of the clever heist intrigues me.
I:13849;97;What this film has, that many others don't, is the appropriate characterization to understand the deal in play.
I:13849;98;"I found Nine Queens to be a very enjoyable and intelligent effort
I:13849;99;"as someone who has lived in Buenos Aires twice, I found this film to be an enjoyable ride through a city known for its ""vivenza criolla"" (creole cunning), where a guiding philosophy for some is ""do what you have to do to get ahead""."
I:13849;100;While every big city in every country has its own vivenza criolla, Buenos Aires is the perfect setting because of the decadent feel of a Latin Paris whose best days are behind it.
I:13849;101;The scams involved in this movie are brilliant and even humorous to a point.
I:13849;102;Needless to say, they are believable.
I:13849;103;i highly recommend this movie to anyone who happens to be reading these reviews and is still undecided.
I:13849;104;A great addition to anyone's library, and *POSSIBLE SPOILER* I must say it has a conclusion that rivals that of The Usual Suspects.
I:13849;105;To clarify I haven't seen the film but my friend Josh really liked it.
I:13849;106;And Josh watches a lot of movies so it's got to be good.
I:13849;107;I really liked the movie.
I:13849;108;It kept your attention throughout.
I:13849;109;It also had many surprises to keep you entertained.
I:13849;110;One of the best films I ever seen.
I:13849;111;The drama and story of this film keeps you into it through out but is not until the end that you fall in love with it.
I:13849;112;a very talented director who died too soon to be internationally recognized.
I:13849;113;i certainly will try to locate it, and after that, i might have to re.
I:13849;114;Gotta see it, gotta have it.
I:13849;115;This movie holds your interest throughout the entire film and keeps you guessing.
I:13849;116;this movie was made in Argentina, complete with beautiful scenery and photography.
I:13849;117;there is also a lot of humor, action and suspense, which you seldom find in one movie.
I:13849;118;He is one sexy man.
I:13849;119;How it turns out is the substance of a very fine film.
I:13849;120;This is a tense and satisfying thriller.
I:13849;121;But if you have a decent command of the Spanish language, then Nine Queens is a very entertaining film about a world of con men, each trying to outsmart the other.
I:13849;122;Though now the game seems at an end, the real ending is quite a surprise.
I:13849;123;Watch it and find out!In addition to the fine performances of Darin and Pauls, Leticia Bredice performs well in the role of Marcos' somewhat attractive but somewhat severe sister.
I:13849;124;The sights and sounds of life in Buenos Aires are an added bonus.
I:13849;125;This 2000 Argentine import is a caper film that kept my eyes glued to the screen.
I:13849;126;i think the script was wonderful.
I:13849;127;The pacing is excellent too.
I:13849;128;And everything moved along swiftly.
I:13849;129;And everything is revealed just a little at a time.
I:13849;130;This movie is clever, quick and keeps you guessing.
I:13849;131;Definitely worth the price of admission.
I:13849;132;"Easily as clever and challenging as any David Mamet piece (including ""The Spanish Prisoner,"" to which this movie offers some discreet homage), ""Nueva Reinas"" or ""Nine Queens"" is the most delightful, intricate, warm."
I:13849;133;Watch the movie, and get involved .
I:13849;134;only to crack up laughing and LOVING the ending, which you could not possibly have anticipated!This movie is so delicious, so evil and clever and deceitful, you'll enjoy every moment .
I:13849;135;"Nine Queens, or ""Nueve Reinas"" in its original Spanish title, is one of the more entertaining Argentinian movies I've watched so far."
I:13849;136;The dialogue is witty, the action doesn't stop, and the acting is flawless.
I:13849;137;But what makes this movie interesting is how that idea is developed, managing to surprise the spectator until the very end.
I:13849;138;The director (Fabi n Bielinsky) also wrote the script, that won a National Prize in Argentina.
I:13849;139;The story and the acting are great, and so is the beautiful setting, the city of Buenos Aires.
I:13849;140;Watch it, and enjoy :)Belen Alcat
I:13849;141;this movie is simply great.
I:13849;142;"Fabian Bielinsky's ""Nine Queens"" is what David Mamet wanted ""The Heist"" to be: jazzy, non."
I:13849;143;"Nine Queens stars Ricardo Darin fresh off the success of ""Son of the Bride"" and Gaston Pauls as two petty crooks after the big score who stumble upon a scheme to make many thousands of dollars involving a rare print of a Weimar Republic stamp called the ""9 Queens."
I:13849;144;Marco hooks up with Juan while Juan is in the process of a low.
I:13849;145;At this point Marco takes Juan under his wing and into his confidence for a day to see if the the chemistry is right between the two so as continue as partners.
I:13849;146;indulgent and amoral yet he is able to make Marco appealing and positive.
I:13849;147;He is a true beacon of the South American Cinema along with Norma Aleandro.
I:13849;148;Gaston Pauls matches Darin's feverish, naked portrayal with his own style of boyish intelligence and chutzpah.
I:13849;149;9 Queensis another example of the South American Cinema's resurgence as a major force in World Cinema.
I:13849;150;It's a taut, expertly directed (by Fabian Bielinsky), intelligent caper movie that ranks up there with the best of Mamet and Frankenheimer: a must see for all those concerned with World Cinema and the emrerging third world.
I:13849;151;Nine Queens is a pretty good Argentinean movie full of cons and twists that you are never really sure who is cunning who.
I:13849;152;"In the course of the day they come across what may well be the job of a lifetime
I:13849;153;The job has a lot of risks, not to mention the fact that the two men don't trust each other, but the stakes are high.
I:13849;154;The characters are believable, and one epathizes with them.
I:13849;155;Smart, witty, entertaining with a twist of an ending.
I:13849;156;Ricardo Darin and Gaston Pauls are amazing!!!
I:13849;157;One of the best Argentinean movies of all times.
I:13849;158;I show this to my Spanish class and they always get a kick out of it.
I:13849;159;Nine Queens will test your imagination and observation powers, lest you the viewer be tricked.
I:13849;160;It is a wickedly clever film written by a genius and acted by absolutely top talent.
I:13849;161;A perfect movie: thrilling, warm, criminal, shocking, slick and funny.
I:13849;162;There's a quite a bit of surprise in the Argentine film Nine Queens, but the biggest surprise of all is how perfect it is.
I:13849;163;Everything about the film is perfect, especially all the clever plot twists.
I:13849;164;This is one that definitely transcends cultures and is purely a great ride of a film that just about anyone would love.
I:13849;165;I highly recommend this film.
I:13849;166;Excellent, full of surprises, great acting, much better than the later Hollywood version, keeps you guessing until the very end
I:13849;167;and that's part of what's great about this movie.
I:13849;168;The acting, while not extraordinary, is successful in presenting these two criminals as they perform a variety of cons.
I:13849;169;"The real gem here is the writing
I:13849;170;I found this movie about two con artists wonderfully unpredictable.
I:13849;171;The script is nicely complex, the characters are cleverly duplicitous, and the plot .
I:13849;172;is full of twists, turns, and red herrings that kept me guessing from beginning to end.
I:13849;173;director Fabi n Bielinsky has very skillfully woven together a cast of believable characters, playing out their roles in the streets and public places of what seems to be Buenos Aires.
I:13849;174;couple buddy film, its pairing of Gastn Pauls and Ricardo Dar n is continually fascinating as the high.
I:13849;175;stakes alliance between them keeps evolving.
I:13849;176;hour film is just fast enough to keep one step ahead of us, and while a Hollywood version would surely find ways to trim, simplify and accelerate it, I was happy that I had time to take in the visuals and read the subtitles, too.
I:13849;177;Great fun from beginning to end.
I:13849;178;Best film about con artists since The Sting and every bit as fun.
I:13849;179;taking time out for this film is time well spent.
I:13849;180;There exists a certain magic between the two main characters, everything from their facial expressions, conversations, their ideas.
I:13849;181;it's a very entertaining movie from the get.
I:13849;182;one of the best con.
I:13849;183;this movie take you to the real world of a con.
I:13849;184;It is a great story about 2 con.
I:13849;185;men and their interactions with others set in the great city of Buenos Aires!
I:13849;186;There are numerous other characters and even the bit players lend color to this movie.
I:13849;187;plot twists abound in this cleverly plotted comedy thriller.
I:13849;188;To provide more detail on the plot will spoil all the fun.
I:13849;189;The dialog is crisp and genuinely funny and, in places, touching.
I:13849;190;Pauls also plays a good character, who engages in the criminal life with arguably noble motives.
I:13849;191;No one can claim that this movie is profound, but it is really entertaining and a great introduction to Argentine cinema.
I:13849;192;One knows that in the last scene all will be explained.
I:13849;193;What's good about this is that the actors are solid, interesting, charismatic.
I:13849;194;It's lovely to see actors other than the Hollywood few doing their thing.
I:13849;195;A film like this is less cute, but more entertaining than any Ocean's Eleven.
I:13849;196;It's an interesting reminder that a story can be exciting, intriguing, crime.
