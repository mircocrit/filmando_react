id;spiegazione
1;"Season 7did brilliant comedy about ""nothing,"" 'Annie Hall' said a great deal about a lot of things of varying magnitude in this funny Woody Allen movie masterpiece."
2;Episodic for sure, Allen's directing and co. writing take everything bothersome and makes it into an honest labor of love.
3;'Annie Hall' is exceptionally funny.
4;"He talks about the meal and tells of a companion who said, ""I had salad."
5;Similarly, he's great at showing what it's like to be scrutinized as a dinner guest.
6;Pet peeves are also confronted to provide creator and audience with plenty of therapeutic laughs.
7;'Annie Hall' is just delightful fun.
8;Chockful of wit and candor, it is a sustaining comedic classic.
9;this movie sets the tone for Woody Allen's entire career.
10;Diane Keaton is great, Paul Simon is perfect in his role, If you've liked any Woody Allen movie or enjoy Rom.
11;my love affair with woody allen films came with Annie Hall.
12;it was the greatest thing i have ever seen.
13;the universal sentiments on relationships, jealousy, infidelty, insecurty are universal and truth full.
14;this movie trancendes race and income because we have all loved and broken at some point.
15;Worth owning and lendign out
16;Annie Hall directed and starring Woody Allen is his best and most funniest film of all.
17;But the person I admire the most is Diane Keaton who won an Oscar for Best Actress and she much deserved it.
18;I highly recommend this entertaining and somewhat serious look at relationships at any age.
19;Definitely on my desert island list!
20;"I've only seen this movie 17 times, and I am still ""peeling the onion one layer at a time"" of this deceptively simple adult romance."
21;"Incredible blend of joy and pain and ""laugh."
22;One of Woody Allen's best films.
23;two years after it's initial release, ANNIE HALL remains one of the best romantic comedies of all time.
24;While standing on the balcony talking to each other, their personal thoughts are shared with us via sub.
25;there is a wonderful supporting cast.
26;Tony Roberts is Alvy's macho best friend who prefers Los Angeles to New York and Woody tells him the only cultural advantage to living in L. a. is the ability to make a right turn on a red light (this is still illegal in New York City).
27;He tells Woody he moved to L. a. because New York has gotten so dirty .
28;aNNIE HALL is a wonderful film to add to your collection.
29;But the point is this it is the same subject that Woody addressed there even though chronologically Annie Hall came first by a couple of years and received the lion's share of kudos and awards.
30;Here he adds a flourish by contrasting old New York (in the 1970's) to up and coming California as the cultural mecca of the American empire.
31;add to that the perennial issue of Woody's struggle with `interpersonal' relationships and his angst.
32;driven desire to understand the modern world and you have a very fine social commentary of the times.
33;Needless to say Woody's love interest Annie Hall (as played by his then paramour Diane Keaton) keeps him hopping.
34;As does an ensemble cast that works well together as foils for his ironic and savage humor.
35;The only surprise in revisiting this film recently is how well Keaton played her role as an up and coming torch singer.
36;phrases from this movie are part of our lives.
37;It has aged very well, as the realities of relationships that it depicts are pretty timeless.
38;Next best thing to Breakfast at Tiffany's.
39;Diane Keaton is fantastic and Woody Allen tells a great story that remains true today, Classic!
40;But, it was really nice to see a young Diane Keaton be a hippie and that relationship and social dynamics haven't really changed.
41;The flashback scene to Woody's childhood, with an adult Woody and Diane watching comes to mind.
42;In my opinion, Woody's humor only works well in light comedies.
43;This movie is a classic and never gets old.
44;She has such a sweet voice and should record.
45;Come on Diane, you can do it!!
46;Oddly funny as all Woody Allen movies are.
47;This is definitely and absolutely an Oscar winner!
48;Diane Keaton was more than perfect for this role!!!
49;Hope she makes a lot more movies.
50;It took little longer than stated to arrive to me, but it was in great condition.
51;Hailed as Woody Allen's finest film, `Annie Hall' has some pretty weighty expectations to live up to, and what amazes me is that each and every time I watch it I am reminded of why Allen is loved to much among the cinemaphiles like myself.
52;i can't for the life of me decide which film I truly prefer (`Annie Hall' or `Hannah and Her Sisters') but fact remains that both films are cinematic gems.
53;"Sure, the delivery is sporadic and spontaneous and at times it throws you off, but that's the kind of friend Woody Allen is
54;what I think is so poignant about `Annie Hall' is that it depicts a relationship that is as average as they come and so any and everyone can relate and draw from this film.
55;The audience can immediately place themselves in the film and understand both Singer and Hall and this helps the audience make a personal and emotional connection to the material"
56;The film beautifully captures the strains that insecurities and difference can cause on a relationship and approaches the subjects of independence and desire with precision and grace.
57;the film is only elevated by the brilliant performances by the two leads.
58;Keaton, who rightfully won the Oscar for her performance, is exciting and mysterious, intriguing and complex.
59;Her character is desirous from the very beginning and she builds on her intricacies magnificently.
60;Allen is a revelation, and in all honesty my favorite part of the film.
61;His neurotic shtick can get a little tiresome (as was seen in `Scoop') but here he is genuine and passionate with his delivery, to the point where he is not only tolerable but wholly enjoyable.
62;`Annie Hall' has already received classic status and will always be regarded as one of the finest films of all time.
63;Coming from a man who was once put off by the auteur that is Woody Allen, this is truly an astounding film.
64;For us that like a good laugh, this is a wonderful romance.
65;one of my favorite scenes must be the spider in her bathroom scene,makes me laugh just thinking about it.
66;"another scene that's great is Woody's meeting with her very ""New England Type"" family."
67;This movie is a true delight, with subtle balance between comedy and drama.
68;It's done with such a great taste and in my opinion, it's one of the few that can be a pride of American cinema, at least in its genre.
69;It will probably remain a perennial favorite of certain audiences, and there will never go out of fashion.
70;It's a kind of a movie that one can watch when the mood is not too great, somehow it's uplifting.
71;I'm a late bloomer to seeing Annie Hall, but it was worth the wait.
72;I'm also not a Woody Allen fan, but he was the perfect foil.
73;Diane Keaton just added the topping on the cake.
74;"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie
75;Great movie for its genre"
76;Now I know why Woody Allen is such a comedic master.
77;Rocky was a big winner in 1976.
78;I love that I was able to instantly watch it and see it for a fill 24 hrs.
79;I knew this was the film that won the Oscar in 1977, the year of Star Wars .
80;since that day I am a real Woody.
81;fan and I have seen nearly every film of him.
82;His pictures are among the most witty, funny and sophisticated out there and Annie Hall shows him in peak form.
83;Individual scenes, like the one involving Marshal McLuhan, are real gems.
84;If you watch it once, you will watch it over and over again.
85;A real pleasure from Woody Allen, about the beginnings, and the end of a trying relationship.
86;He really shows how people grow and change in the course of being together.
87;Diane Keaton gives a great, Oscar winning performance of a young singer trying to make her big break in NYC.
88;Woody Allen is a terrific director when he leaves himself out as an actor.
89;The best example I can think of is Midnight In Paris, one of my all.
90;Allen directs Annie Hall with himself as the male star.
91;His love intrest is Annie Hall, an adventurous, independent woman, played by Diane Keaton.
92;His family is a classic Jewish movie family.
93;Annie on the other hand grew up in a nice midwestern town with her nice midwestern family.
94;comically philosophical character, is so frustratingly realistic.
95;And at the same time he manages to write characters and direct in such a way that you have to laugh!
96;Because it is all about the small things in life, though in this case put into an academicized environment.
97;annie Hall remains the best of all Woody Allen's genius movies.
98;see for anyone who's interested in movies!
99;the single most famous scene from the movie is the encounter between Allen's character, Alvy Singer and Annie Hall, played brilliantly by Diane Keaton, after their tennis match with Annie dressed in her classic layered look with vest, men's tie, and balloonish trousers.
100;From this one scene came a whole late 1970's fashion trend, the `Annie Hall' look of layered, mannish clothes.
101;This scene also sets the stage for my latest insight into the movie, which is the progression of Annie, with a lot of help from Alvy, from an unserious girl with a decent singing voice to a serious woman with a few good ideas and a connection to a serious Hollywood music personality, played convincingly by Paul Simon with an eye to having her performances commercially recorded.
102;There are excellent little parts for Colleen Dewhurst and Christopher Walken.
103;Some of Allen's jokes from this movie are some of his best known.
104;As unrealistic as the many cinematic gimmicks are, the characters are intensely real.
105;Try that with your usual Ben Stiller character.
106;highly recommended classic among both Allen movies and all movies in general.
107;All the Allen trademarks are here: Allen's sexual hangups, his Jewish upbringing, NY vs. LA (very funny), the snobby intellectualisms.
108;Woody Allen is a genius.
109;it's definately worth adding to a collection.
110;and enjoyed every minute of it.
111;Diane Keaton can best be described as fetchingly perfect as his girlfriend.
112;What a wonderful, funny, smart, entertaining film.
113;So many clever gags, so much great smart New York dialog.
114;Woody manages to weave together a story that jumps from coast to coast, from live action to animated, from serious to hilarious, and keeps it all flowing and fun.
115;Truly one of the most enjoyable films ever.
116;I can watch a couple of times in the U. s. but that's it.
117;Every time I watch this classic, I appreciate it more by picking up another subtle comment, gesture or look.
118;Allen is one of this generations most talented directors and this movie sets the bar very high.
119;I will continue to view this romantic comedy until I have every line memorized.
120;analytical persona was perfect for the growingly narcissistic American public and the way he introduced the audience into the storyline of his films by intermittently turning towards the screen as though it were a person and engaging the viewer with questions and comments was nothing short of pure genius (The legendary Bob Hope made use of this active audience participation technique years earlier but not to the extent and effectiveness as Woody).
121;large the film most people will point to as his apex in filmmaking.
122;That's what makes it so hilarious.
123;Woody Allen is a genius!
124;Diane Keaton did a great acting job here also.
125;I will watch this movie a few times a year.
126;As good as the movie Manhattan and Interiors.
127;The movie is quirky and while it is ostensibly about Annie, it is more about Woody Allen.
128;Still funny after all these years.
129;I recommend watching it when you need a good laugh.
130;Woody Allen's Annie Hall has nmet the test of time and it is still a great film 32 years after its first release in 1977.
131;This is truly Allen's breakthrough film and is quite possibly the model for all romantic comedies to follow.
132;It is Allen's first film to actually concentrate on dialogue and presents some of film's most memorable lines.
133;diane Keaton scored an Oscar for her portrayal of the title character and she is spot on perfect with Allen as the neurotic Alvy Singer.
134;The film is also unique in that it makes the city of New York a primary character in the story.
135;the film could use some restoration but the standard definition disc by MGM does quite well.
136;The sound is dialogue driven and is in mono but there are no real problems with clarity which is nice on a film of this age.
137;Interesting dynamic between the characters discussing love, independence, co. dependence, and friendship.
138;As a woman who only recently recovered from what was, at the time, an extremely crushing and crippling breakup, Annie Hall was an interesting, funny, and surprisingly therapeutic film.
139;This is a great film not only as entertainment for a Friday night, but if you're feeling lost in (or out) of a relationship, it's a pretty magnificent foil for self.
140;it was as fresh today as when i saw it when it first came out in the 1970s.
141;her real life name is Diane Hall and friends and family have always called her annie, not diane.
142;this film establishes the basis for all of his best work in the ensuing decades.
143;this film won a bunch of oscars including best film and best actress for diane keaton.
144;Annie Hall is Allen's best film in my opinion.
145;Keaton is the perfect counterpart to the Woodman's neurotic whining.
146;the film is full of poignant beautiful dialouge like Love Fades .
147;it rings true to life.
148;the montage at the end is one of the best I have ever seen done, and is listed in a film book I had to read for film criticism class.
149;There is everything to love about this film.
150;Watch for Jeff Goldblum, Paul Simon, and one of the funniest sequences has Christopher Walken.
151;This is Woody Allen at his best.
152;From the opening scene to the hilarious ending, you will have tears of laughter rolling down your face.
153;What really makes this movie a classic however is the great supporting cast.
154;This is well worth your time and money.
155;This is a great movie.
156;It's hilarious yet devastating at the same time.
157;Somehow, he gets several women and has already been through two lovely and intelligent wives when he meets Annie Hall when he plays tennis against her.
158;But eventually, their romance blossoms and they live together.
159;Annie has a great love for life.
160;She's a singer and photographer, young and vibrant.
161;I'll let you see the movie to find out exactly how THAT goes.
162;Still a memorable exploration of female/male relationships and the culture clash of Midwestern/Manhattan sensibilities.
163;It's Diane Keaton at her absolute best.
164;It's Woody Allen when his neurotic revelations were fresh and still entertaining.
165;"In my mind, it's a member of the ""Classics Hall of Fame."""
166;Sally knows what she's going after and was never in any way needing Harry's moral support in her career choice.
167;It remains his most popular film and won 4 Accademy Awards.
168;the way Allen combined his New York characters with sharp satirical comments on everything from intellectual phoniness, racism and sexual angst to shared experiences like standing in line at the movies was new, fresh and original.
169;invented the modern romantic comedy and his style has been much imitated ever since.
170;And he's certainly not a charismatic or even charming leading man.
171;line throughout the film is toyed with in the style of Fellini's 8 1/2).
172;That's the key joke of my adult life, in terms of my relationships with women.
173;a stand up comic and Allen's quintessential New York character.
174;including himself and has to whine about everything that bothers him.
175;A women who is utterly vulnerable, yet extremely tough.
176;Maybe Alvy is perfect for her.
177;Annie is smart, but not as intellectual or well read as Alvy.
178;She doesn't believe in herself, but she knows she should and really wants to.
179;She knows she needs to grow and change and she knows Alvy might help her do that.
180;and so we have the bittersweet romance.
181;And it's because the film is first about the romance and then about Allen's obsessions and interests that made the film his most popular.
182;nearly all of the film's scenes are laugh out loud funny.
183;Some are full brilliant comic inventiveness.
184;annie Hall may be full of sharp observance but it keeps its distance from the audience with it's almost too clever gimmicks.
185;He uses surrealistic gags, and even a brief animated sequence in the film.
186;We also get the funny subtitle scene.
187;and let's not forget the film also had an amazing fashion influence.
188;The Annie Hall look is still with us.
189;oF INTEREST:The relationship between Alvy and Annie is full of easy to make real life parallels.
190;The film's title incorporates Diane Keaton's real name.
191;He is on the phone and says: I forgot my mantra.
192;This is Woody Allen's best movie and I couldn't stay awake.
193;This movie represents all of the best of Woody Allen.
194;Allen's onscreen persona is better suited to this particular story than any other, and Diane Keaton is one of the most joyous personalities onscreen.
195;In addition to the wonderfully funny dialogue between the two leads, an abundance of walk.
196;on performances, filled by a remarkable number of future stars (Jeff Goldblum, Sigourney Weaver, Christopher Walken) as well as unknowns, leave us with some of the most enduringly funny scenarios and one.
197;His renditions of New York, Los Angeles, the dating scene, and popular culture are still relevant and comedic.
198;And kudos to Allen for having the freshness to ask candid questions to people on the street, pull a real.
199;life personality from offscreen, and bicker with the Evil Queen from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
200;Woody Allen's professional integrity has held fast for over a quarter century.
201;It is well known that over the many years of filmmaking, he created an insular production company and connected himself to people (producers) who would accept any film proposal on face value .
202;this is not just a good film but a great film.
203;Allen's wit runs hot and fast in this film and one has to pay close attention to catch all the great lines.
204;In comedies particularly, the chemistry between the actors is essential for the joke and scene to work.
205;The chemistry between Keaton and Allen has now become legendary.
206;"In the hilarious ""Lobster"" scene, you can tell they really like each other and have a lot of fun, on and off screen."
207;They were of course once a couple, but they continue to be great friends and attribute their professional and creative successes to each other.
208;One can see this relationship blossoming in ~Annie Hall~.
209;This is the classic Woody Allen picture and one of his better films, that should be a part of every film lover's collection.
210;Annie Hall had a very interesting production.
211;Woody first set out to make a surrealistic exploration called Anhedonia, a film chronicling the inner working of Alvy's mind.
212;Taking this into account, it's a miracle that the film works (and is considered a masterpiece).
213;This makes for a very interesting combination of sarcastic observational humor and innovative storytelling.
214;indulgence, essentially Woody Allen psychoanalyzing himself for the public, but he's fully aware of it, we're fully aware of it, he gets to keep making movies and his audience is rewarded with entertaining and smart comedy.
215;Nevertheless, it does have a number of his most memorable scenes, a fantastic cast, great photography, and a fast style.
216;This is a smart, funny and well.
217;Everyone else's reviews are college essays and reports, which means you have to watch it.
218;Classic love story (girl meets boy, they fall in love, they break up) but told in a unique way with great humor along with the pathos.
219;I have found some real gems while watching these films.
220;All About Eve, The Apartment, and The Treasure of the Sierra Madre are all marvelous films that I've watched recently.
221;I guess I've always resisted watching this movie because it was awarded the Oscar for Best Picture over Star Wars.
222;I'd seen Sleeper several years ago, and I thought it was mildly amusing.
223;this movie is brilliant .
224;quick, smart, and funny .
225;got me to laugh out loud many times, which is rare for a movie, especially one created over thirty years ago.
226;i used to think this was a great movie overall .
227;my stomach now knows what's good for it!
228;I felt it was great film in the way it presented Annie and Alvy as a mismatched, but lovable couple.
229;I thought that Woody Allenaccomplished this by his innovative use of narrative.
230;He broke thestandards in order to bring me closer to both main characters.
231;And I responded right back, You're right .
232;The last voice in the film is Annie.
233;'Annie Hall' has been called the first modern romantic comedy, but it is actually the ultimate anti.
234;com is the union of two mismatched lovers, the kiss, marriage .
235;up, and proceeds with a vignette narrative structure, in which time and space are fragmented: far from gathering any momentum, the film, with is modest highs and lows, kind of peters out, just like romance in real.
236;'Annie Hall' is, as everyone knows, the first truly great Woody Allen movie.
237;The opening monologue sets the tone .
238;the movements through time and space, the documentary feel for real locations, the recognition of the emotional import of seemingly trivial events, all combine to create a complex picture of people alive and in love in a particular place and time.
239;the film is the closest American film every came to the spontaneity of the French New Wave, without being cripplingly self.
240;"the inventive chopping between visual registers and narrative moods
241;all creating a film as fresh, funny and poignant as the day it was made, one done a great disservice by its sappy imitators.
242;Diane Keaton has rarely been more enchanting, the fluidity between herself and her character so evident, she seems to be laughing with us at the film she's in.
243;but his warmest, his most approachable, his most inventive, and probably my favorite.
244;what's most amazing about Allen's most creative period is the realism of his characters.
245;dimensional characters you find in most Hollywood productions, who stay the same from beginning to end.
246;Allen's characters actually learn something from their experiences, actually grow and mature by the end of a film.
247;With this 1977 picture, Allen perfectly combined his earlier goofball antics with his later more introspective philosophical style.
248;And perhaps in 'Annie Hall', he succeeded in a playing his message most clearly.
249;This was one of his best movies.
250;It's a romantic comedy, with the comedy being more in the dialog rather than antics.
251;It is Woody Allens masterpiece.
252;It is sweet and funny at the same time.
253;Diane Keaton and him have wonderful chemistry in the movie as unlikely as that seems.
254;It has some of the richest and most thoughtful humor you can find.
255;This quote is a perfect summary of Allen's views on elitist intellectual society:Robin: There's Henry Drucker.
256;He has a chair in history at Princeton.
257;He has a chair in philosophy at Cornell.
258;I still laugh all the way through this movie.
259;If you were alive in the 70's, or are just curious about the era, you'll love it too.
260;This is one of the best movies ever.
261;The writing was top notch, the acting was incrediable, and I have yet to see a movie that is directed better than this (trust me I see a lot of movies.)
262;And if you are upset that it beat STAR WARS for best picture at the oscars, get over it!
263;This was a much better film.
264;Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) is a comedian with an obsession with death who has a chance encounter with the adorably ditzy Annie Hall (Diane Keaton), an aspiring singer.
265;verbal conversations between the two characters (including a great scene where Alvy and Annie are talking to each other, with subtitles under them, projecting the subtext in their exchange) and quirky scenes, we have an interesting view into the lives of these two very quirky characters.
266;this film has been deemed one of the best Woody Allen films, as well as one of the funnies comedies in film.
267;the dialogue is funny and engaging, the characters are delightfully neurotic and I guarantee you will enjoy it.
268;Annie Hall, his seventh film, introduces themes that would be featured in his later films, including Manhattan.
269;wikipediaI save you all the rest, the prizes won, the profit made, the favorable comments made: I just recommend that you see the film.
270;with Annie Hall, the proportions seem right, it is simply and consistently funny, even today.
271;Plus camerawork, which is brilliant.245 .
272;this movie is a classic!
273;it is funny, clever, and well directed.
274;The flashbacks are a great addition.
275;Diane Keaton is great here.
276;For all of his many skills, as director, actor and comedian, Woody Allen started as a writer, and it is as a film writer that he may ultimately best be remembered.
277;Yes he's funny here, and the film is well directed, but its the writing that's the best.
278;An exceptional script that goes back and forth in time to examine a relationship with the fictional Annie, made by a man co. staring with his ex.
279;It's great to see how timeless this 1977 movie still is after nearly thirty years especially after seeing Woody Allen's more challenging later work in the interim.
280;But nothing beats a perfectly written script (courtesy of Allen and frequent collaborator Marshall Brickman) and the undeniable chemistry between Allen and Diane Keaton in the title role.
281;Scene for scene, it represents the most consistently engaging comedy Allen ever directed, and his wonderfully creative stream.
282;It all blends into a movie that remains emotionally resonant and even bittersweet behind all the laughs.
283;up comedian, and Annie Hall, an aspiring singer.
284;It is really the contrast in their approach to life that brings them together and provides the impetus for their dissolution.
285;Allen is himself or at least his public persona and even manages a sense of unexpected pathos toward the end, especially when he desperately proposes marriage at the health food restaurant.
286;Marshall McLuhan at the movies, the lobsters, the sneeze into the cocaine, Christopher Walken's bit as Annie's headlight.
287;The movie itself is of course, a Woody Allen classic in all of the expected ways.
288;It's smart, funny, intellectual and like many (not all) of his other films, I love it.
289;I love listening to him.
290;Also of note is Allen's intelligent sense of humour.
291;Allen is a master in portraying human nature.
292;It's the first Woody Allen movie I have seen, but I have heard they all tend to be similar.
293;Diane Keaton so young and fresh"
294;I probably won't watch it again, but the experience was worth watching once.
295;I would recommend this movie for anyone who enjoys witty, charming, and deeply intellectual comedies.
296;Alvy realizes his love and goes to see her again.
297;This comedy romance is a quirky Allen movie that uses sight gags, breaks the fourth wall, utilizes voice over, and has lengthy camera shots.
298;This film is a lot about simply talking and it certainly has its moments of brilliance.
299;"I do like many other Jewish films very well, especially ""Enemies, A Love Story"" and ""The Chosen."
300;some of the bits are very funny: the most famous visual gags, and his opening line at a political meeting.
301;diane Keaton is still appealing.
302;She proved herself after she broke from Allen, and she proved herself in this role.
303;A true pearl in a slimy oyster!
304;It is the quintessential movie of the 70s.
305;"After watching a few of Woody Allen's films this is the one I found the most accomplished, interesting and funny other than ""Take The Money and Run""."
306;sabotager role very well and watching his attempts at getting the ultimate chalk and cheese relationship to work was amusing for the most part and hilarious in a few of the scenes that actually managed to age pretty well over the last 30 years.
307;I have been a huge fan of Allen's works for years and I've seen every movie he's made.
308;Strangely, Annie Hall, the most celebrated and universally considered THE Best Woody Allen's movie ever, did not belong to the top list of my favorite Allen's films.
309;It took me three times to watch it and finally I can say yes, it is indeed a marvelous film, one of the best romantic stories told from the screen, the love story that could've only been made by Woody Allen.
310;This is a story of two people who truly loved each their but could not stay together and moved on with their lives.
311;Simple like that but it was told by Woody Allen, what made it not so simple and very enjoyable.
312;This is the film where Diane Keaton had proved a perfect actress for Allen's movies.
313;She brought to the film a lot of herself, her natural nervousness and insecure attitude to the role, even her dressing style that became hugely popular, and she was able to look at herself from the distance.
314;She played Annie with such elegance, bemusement, perfect timing, and sense of humor, that for the whole time I kept asking myself how she did it.
315;The part of the answer is that Allen understood her completely and masterfully used the originality of her persona to write and direct the character of Annie.
316;For Annie Hall, Allen received his first and only nomination for acting, and he deserved it.
317;You may say that you've seen all his tricks many times but Annie Hall was the first movie where he mixed physical comedy, anxiety, and neurosis with the genuine feelings of love and nostalgia so touchingly and funny.
318;Engaging the audience to the film by talking directly to them may not be used for the first time ever by Allen but it worked perfectly in Annie Hall.
319;The flashbacks are smart and funny, the split screen Allen uses, really added to the characters' understanding by comparison two parallel streams of thought.
320;Both, NYC and its antitheses, LA look gorgeous.
321;Even the smallest cameos are memorable (Christopher Walken and Jeff Goldblum, for example).
322;"I still believe that Allen has made films better than Annie Hall, at least I love 'Manhattan"", ""Hanna and Her Sisters', ""Zelig"", and especially ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" more and place them above Annie Hall."
323;But as the first Allen's romantic dramedy, the one that had started the whole genre of independent and sophisticated urban love stories with an unusual, over self.
324;obsessed and not always likable lead hero who nevertheless is always ready to be the first to laugh at himself and to look at himself from the distance, Annie Hall has found the high place in the film history.
325;The members of the academy did not think so, and rewarded the film with 5 Oscar nominations, of which it won four, making Annie Hall one of very few comedies to have won Best Picture of the year Oscar and the shortest ever Oscar winner .
326;93 precious minutes of Woody Allen's genius and Diane Keaton's charm.
327;my all time favorite Woody Allen film, favorite comedy/drama, wow!
328;But Diane Keaton's Annie is a classic.
329;Woody Allen's script is filled with absolutely great moments.
330;And the ending still grabs me.
331;This is a comedy classic that should be seen by everyone who has experienced the emotional swings of navigating a complicated new intimate relationship.
332;Diane Keaton steals the movie in this one.
333;"Someone told me a few years ago that I'd love ""Annie Hall,"" and I held off seeing it because that person was an ex."
334;and it is a great movie about a maddeningly wonderful and neurotic ex.
335;done relationship with Annie Hall.
336;Diane Keaton and the supporting cast all work well together.
337;i laughed a whole lot through it and it is honest in its depiction of how a relationship doesn't necessarily need some major drama to end .
338;In that sense, I found this movie surprisingly realistic, and wish more movies would explore this less exciting, but equally interesting dimension of human relationships.
339;Watch it with someone you can talk about it with.
340;I first saw this a while back and loved it, and just saw it recently and it's timeless!Woody is so brilliant, I love his comedies, but you have to understand him, no I'm not saying understand his love for his way.
341;daughter, but his comedic mind.
342;this movie won the Academy for Best Picture in 1977.
343;about 1 1/2 hours, but packed full of laughs.
344;The movie is full of scenes depicting his times with Annie.
345;maybe I was too young then) so personally I found this scene, very amusing!This film is cute and funny it is definitely a must see!
346;Delivered in timely manner, and In good condition.
347;"This movie is for people who remember how funny a movie can be without someone being blown up, shot at, or dazzled away from a movie with really no story
348;Woody Allen has a gift that is no longer respected.
349;he can tell a entertaining, thoughtful, funny story.
350;It is one of the top movies of all time for a reason.
351;I first caught it a few years ago.
352;anyway, I've seen some of Woody Allen's other movies and, though I like some of them, """"Annie Hall"""" is my favorite."""
353;Annie Hall touches on a lot of elements.
354;It is serious in a way with regard to relationships.
355;allen has done a wonderful job directing this movie with a light touch.
356;diane Keaton was just adorable and I think it was the very best role she has ever gotten.
357;the cinematography by Gordon Willis is superb
358;This is a good movie that details the trails and tribulations of a New York intellectual that just doesn't get it.
359;Woody Allen has managed to combine true belly laughs with heartfelt emotional conflicts in this modern movie classic which remains as satisfying today as it was when it won the Best Picture Oscar in 1977.
360;Annie Hall is a classic!
361;This is a classic Woody Allen film.
362;No wonder it won four Oscars!
363;Annie Hall is one of the best Woody Allen movies out there.
364;It features Dianne Keaton in one of her best performances, and is a thoroughly enjoyable movie with great wit and humor.
365;Some great fun and the New York v. Los Angeles debate that is often a basis of Woody' humor, is in great form here.
366;'Favourite' is a term not to be thrown about lightly, but in my case, after much thought, I have to apply it to this wonderful film.
367;It's the one I know I can return to time after time and always enjoy.
368;linear narrative is one of the great charms of a movie which features asides to camera, flashes back and forward, and even a short cartoon interlude.
369;time classic which addresses universal truths about love and life.
370;Thin on plot but filled with heart and laughter.
371;But if youre looking for a wonderful, comic, and strangely heartwarming movie, this is it.
372;As a comedy, its brilliant.
373;"This film is so caleidoscopic 
374;Allen smelt the bitter times and decided to create a gentle and sincere work about the unability of getting the whole happiness .
375;He suggests us the concept so many times repeated : the happiness is just a lovely , funny and poetic vignettes colection , but beware about to reach this utopic state for a long time .
376;we must laugh before being happy "
377;"They meet and feel that invisible chemistry 
378;new York is once more a monumental and changing background to express the greatness and the unability to vibrate to the same frenetic rhtym this city beats .
379;nevertheless Allen knew to avoid to fall in the so well known clich and builds a brilliant ending for both of them .
380;at last Allen will reveal as a guy filled with new hopes , recognizing his inner weakness and wishing her the best .
381;but the form in which this romantic drama will develop its own flight is so original and well done that you can not forget it at all and like the good books this cult movie lives with you , and your memories .
382;In particular I must confess I watch it once or twice every year .
383;a timeless artistic winner !
384;This is one of the best films of the 1970s, in some ways it defined them.
385;Woody outdid himself, and yet it really was just the first of his real movies.
386;This is often rated as one of the best American movies ever made.
387;It's just a good film.
388;A true delight from start to end this isn't a laugh out loud comedy.
389;It's a subtle, charming and smart look in the lives of two strange lovers.
390;That's a great thing about his comedies.
391;He lets all of the one liners, philosophical comments and observations of life lie there unconnected, not forcing them to melt together to reveal an universal truth.
392;He eventually manages to draw a perfect portrait of the way people is and after all is said and done he reaches a conclusion as simple as it is powerfully true.
393;annie Hall is maybe the most moving film to achieve this, since it concentrates in love and the way each relationship changes our lives, even if it doesn't work out you can always take the best of the other person with you.
394;Annie manages to brighten obssessed.
395;alvyn's life while he gives her the confidence she needs by encouraging her to educate herself and being there to never let her feel like she has failed.
396;it was great seeing Annie again, right?
397;I realized what a terrific person she was and.
398;and how much fun it was just knowing her""""."""
399;With that line he closes a chapter of his life in a sweet and happy way.
400;annie Hall is a terrific film, full of smart one.
401;annie Hall is probably the greatest romantic comedy you'll find today and just as any movie should it leaves you the feeling that you've seen something beautiful and special.
402;A great line from the movie is when Jeff Goldblum .
403;another gem is Christopher Walken's small role as Annie's brother, which will have you howling once Alvy is riding in his car.
404;"like it's twin, ""Manhattan,"" ""Annie Hall"" is a love."
405;letter to New York City (not just Manhattan, but to Brooklyn as well, where we visit Alvy's unique childhood home on Coney Island).
406;Cute, funny, quirky, everything a good story about romance and relationships in the city should be.
407;I viewed it in one room while my husband worked in another.
408;Love or hate Woody, this film is often respected as one of his best.
409;i think it still holds up well, some 40 years later.
410;If you have the taste for his humor, Annie Hall is an amazing choice to watch.
411;In it, Woody Allen showcases his ability to be funny while being serious, and in many ways inventing what we now see as the modern comedy.
412;A lot of his techniques (subtitles for humorous effect, breaking the fourth wall) are now common place in modern comedies.
413;The chronicle of the relationship on the screen is also believable, working like all of our memories do, one triggers another, good or bad.
414;The comedy in many parts is very subtle, sometimes it's obvious and laugh out loud.
415;But the entire film is enjoyable and truly a masterpiece, and a guiding light for modern film making.
416;I especially enjoyed Alvy's experience while waiting in line at the movie theater.
417;Just confusion, laughter, love, and depression.
418;Part of the joy in this film is seeing some brief cameos from the soon to be famous (Sigourney Weaver, Jeff Goldblum, etc).
419;I'm sure it will remind you of someone in your life.
420;Annie Hall finds Woody Allen in top form in probably his finest turn as writer and director.
421;It is real humor out of everyday situations we all find ourselves in.
422;The wide aclaim for this film is richly deserved.
423;Certainly for me it was worth the price.
424;Woody does it again, His dry humor keeps the movie going.
425;The way he plays the troubled and misunderstood lover is a very true to life[Inmost case's] example.
426;Diane Keaton is also very good in the part ofWoody's somewhat confused lover.
427;This movie is a must see and one ofWoody's best.
428;I drove into Nashville to see the film and parked along the river.
429;"Woody Allen transitioned from a very funny writer/actor/director, to a truly brilliant filmmaker with ""Annie Hall."""
430;Like Allen's earlier works, this is hilariously funny, but beneath the humor lies a poignant love story of two mismatched, neurotic people.
431;It is a focused film that takes a mature look at modern urban relationships.
432;The witty, clever screenplay is one of the reasons for its enduring popularity, regardless of the audience's demographics.
433;Singer has a spurt of good luck, however, when he meets ditsy, charming Annie Hall, originally from Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin.
434;Diane Keaton is outstanding in the role .
435;she won an Academy Award for Best Actress, and began a funky clothes trend with her wardrobe that lasted for a few years.
436;It's a wonder that when the two have their first conversation they don't go into instant culture shock.
437;One of the more brilliant scenes occurs when Singer goes to Annie's apartment, for the first time, right after they meet, for a drink and some getting.
438;There is also an outrageous split screen sequence of Annie and Alvie in therapy sessions, with their respective shrinks, discussing their relationship.
439;Also fantastic are the wacky sequences with Annie's Midwestern family, (Colleen Dewhurst is wonderful as Annie's mother, and Christopher Walken, her spooky brother, is beyond weird).
440;Then the screen splits and we see Annie's family talking quietly over dinner, while Alvy's boisterous family, bicker over their Passover meal.
441;When he pushes her to go back to college and take some classes, she gains new confidence .
442;The plot thickens when Annie meets a hit record producer who offers her a job in Los Angeles.
443;One of Woody Allen's pet peeves is California, and life on the left coast, as compared to life in NYC, so you can bet there is plenty of scathing commentary about Hollywood.
444;linear form, and Allen's use of split screens techniques, animated characters, direct.
445;camera narration, and occasional subtitles, are extremely effective, creative and innovative.
446;"Allen won Oscars for Best Director and Best Screenplay, and was nominated for Best Actor for ""Annie Hall."""
447;There are cameos by: Christopher Walken, Shelley Duvall, Carol Kane, Janet Margolin, Marshall MacLuhan, Dick Cavet, John Glover, Jeff Goldblum, Beverly D'Angelo and Sigourney Weaver.
448;so what is the point of this fabulous movie, besides lots of laughs and terrific acting?
449;The primary message here is that to be loved, one has to love oneself first.
450;One of the landmark movies of the 70's,this truly made Allen a star he is today.
451;lots of memorable scenes and lines that somehow became a part of us(who does'nt know about the spiders the size of buicks?)
452;warm,witty and very very funny but like other Woody Allen romantic comedies,it wouldnt inspire you nor make you feel fuzzy inside.
453;Annie HallIt is interesting that they can take an old flick like Casablanca and up grade it to a beautiful, sharp Blu ray version (albeit still a B/W standard screen), and then take another, so popular classic like Annie Hall, put it in a fancy package and even provide both the widescreen and full screen versions on the same disc, and yet both having such a grainy picture!
454;Quick witted and often times hilarious, I give Allen and Keaton both 5 stars for their performances in this film, which I consider to be the greatest romantic comedy of all time.
455;A thoroughly entertaining film, done in a style that will keep you amused from start to finish, will make you laugh and maybe even cry, ANNIE HALL is by far Woody Allen's best film and a modern day classic.
456;Woody Allen is definitely an inspiration for many of today's comedians, particularly Jerry Seinfeld for sure.
457;This is one of the best romantic comedies I've seen in a while.
458;Woody Allen breaks many cliche barriers and has created an excellent film.
459;I recommend this one to anybody who likes comedy.
460;We both knew we had experienced something special, something that would hold us together like a bond through time.
461;I love this move more with every viewing.
462;The Blu ray transfer is good and brings new life to an old, but great film.
463;Love any movie that Diane Keaton is , and it was fun seeing her so young.
464;The movie was a little wacky at times, but still entertaining.
465;There were a handful of really funny moments in this.
466;You probably could have squeezed it into a tight, funny 15.
467;It deserves three stars for that.
468;The first time I saw this absolutely wonderful film, I had mixed feelings, because I was not expecting Woody Allen's innovative camera works, dialogue, and references to literary works, since very few films use those kind of assets.
469;It's so bittersweet and tangible, that it's nearly impossible not to relate.
470;good film, and one feels happy and sad while watching it.
471;The dialogue is clever, hilarious, and at times sad and poignant, if not unbelievably relevant to the everyday routine of people's lives.
472;God, what a wonderful line.
473;This film takes a close look at every aspect of people's lives.
474;aLL IN ALL, Annie Hall is truly one of the most beautiful, poignant works of the era.
475;It is IMPOSSIBLE to emulate this piece of perfection.
476;I will never ever let go of this piece of heaven as long as I live!
477;Recently, 'to Rome with love' and 'midnight in Paris'.
478;It has some interesting dialogue, asides to the audience, some laughs.
479;just never got into his movies but i watched this and i loved it.
480;Woody Allen will always crack me up with his odd sense of humor.
481;Diane Keaton plays Annie, who despite the forced concept that she's articulate, intelligent and well.
482;rounded she presents herself as often aloof and simple.
483;the premise I suppose is that Woody Allen is cute in some way, and attractive too.
484;Its also fun to note that in the movie poster Allen appears taller than his girl, but in the film he walks quite shorter.
485;olds in the year 2009, and the story is about a forty.
486;something guy in the year 1975 (I believe), so we weren't quite born when this film was considered Best Movie Of The Year.
487;Woody's self searching and unique form of humor make this a brilliant movie.
488;Diane Keaton is the perfect co. star.
489;still just as fresh and wonderful.
490;I just wish my wife liked Woody Allen humor as much as I do.
491;I understand that reference, so I must be smart too!
492;This is the first Woody Allen movie I've ever seen, and I think it will be the last.
493;Lots of fun, sad ending.
494;Allen managed to win the Best Picture Oscar for this comedy, and deservedly so.
495;I still remember seeing it in a packed theater, and the whole place rocked with laughter.
496;Brilliantly written and edited, with some great performances.
497;see, all you youngsters who think you know movies but haven't seen this one.
498;"One of the great modern love stories, the charming ""Annie Hall"" has Allen essentially playing himself, with Keaton's sweet, spacy Annie providing an inspired foil."
499;Aside from its examination of contemporary relationships, the movie hilariously contrasts the flavor and essence of New York with sunny, hip Los Angeles, that sprawl on the West Coast which, to Allen's mind, is definitely alien territory.
500;Touching, true, and extremely funny, this is Woody's peak.
501;Annie Hall is a pure comic gem.
502;My VHS tape of Annie Hall looked like Garbage and this is a big improvement.
503;one day I hope that Mr. Woody Allen would do a commentery.
504;I saw this movie in the theatre, in New Jersey, some 35 years ago and thought it was wonderful.
505;The plot line, the numerous funny Woody Allen witty comments, even the ending now seem rather silly.
506;Annie Hall is one of the most acclaimed romantic comedies of all time.
507;"The film took home 4 Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director
508;It really nails that awkwardness of romance.
509;I think few of us are like the neurotic Woody Allen and I don't so much mean the way the characters act, but the way they think and stuff like that is totally realistic.
510;Then his friend Rob (Tony Roberts) introduces him to Annie Hall (the wonderful Diane Keaton).
511;Annie is a little bit ditzy and not quite as smart as Alvy, but the two click and begin a relationship that (to say the least) has it's share of ups and downs.
512;life but this film is also absolutely hilarious.
513;But anyway, Annie Hall actually is very funny.
514;In an era where romantic comedies run rampant into movie theatres, it's nice to go back and see the films that really made the genre what it is.
515;This is a great film, a great romantic.
516;comedy, a Woody Allen masterpiece.
517;his writing may well have the sophistication for which it is reknown, but alas, it takes more than that to make it pleasant.
518;Allen's whining is the most supremely self.
519;and i might as well admit it: i also have some hostility based on the fact that ANNIE HALL, by winning Best Picture, finds itself at the nexus of one of the all.
520;time great miscarrages of Oscar justice.
521;Sometimes it's good to watch the events of the lives of other people to see how they handle things.
522;I was thrilled at the quick response I received.
523;I had my movie within just a few days and it was in outstanding condition.
524;What a great movie this is!
525;Annie Hall is one of those movies that make a lasting impression on you.
526;starring Woody Allen , And Diane Keaton both great performances this is a romantic comedy that's sweeter than maple syrup.
527;I loved every minute of it.
528;flagellating Jewish comedian meets a juicy self.
529;There is always an aura of sadness about Allen's films .
530;annie Hall is a genuinely funny and profound film.
531;both Keaton and Allen do a fantastic acting job basically playing themselves.
532;While Allen never surpasses the quirkines, the bittersweet lightness of the Annie Hall's Alvyn character, Keaton's best moments come in """"Looking for Mr. Goodbar"""" made in the same year."""
533;Have always seen it every chance I got.
534;"her driving (see ""My Best Friend's Wedding"") ."
535;ANNIE HALL is often considered Woody Allen's masterpiece.
536;Certainly, it is one of his most personal and touching films, a seriocomic meditation on.
537;Love and the search for relationships.
538;let me say right off that I thought this film was often fun to watch.
539;on (Allen's especially), and the filmmaking style is fascinating and sometimes exhilarating.
540;"And perhaps Allen could have developed Annie Hall's character a little more than he did
541;still, ANNIE HALL is overall a good film, one that is a lot more mature and perceptive about love and relationships than a lot of the romantic comedies I've seen in recent times (as entertaining as some of them may be).
542;For its laughs as well as its depth, it is worth seeing, and maybe even worth reflecting after the humor of Woody Allen's neuroses has worn off and the bittersweet poignancy of its ending remains.
543;I watch this film with any girl I am beginning to think could be datable, and its a good one for that, because no film about relationships is better.
544;This tremondous film is first, hilarious, with plenty of high brow humor to keep anyone going, but especially bright people who are tired of flatuence as the norm for gags in film.
545;Secondly, it is simply well done, in a string of seamless flashbacks and interestingly shot scences and techniques.
546;THATS what makes Woody the best (please accept my apology David Lynch, you're great too).
547;Probably one of the funniest,smartest comedies I've ever seen.
548;Allen takes the modern romantic comedy format and flips it over on its head to make a masterpiece of cinema.
549;The memorable scenes are too numerous to count.
550;I recommend this movie to anyone who like witty, smart comedies that go against the grain of your normal feel.
551;Just to add my voice to the choir: Quite simply one of the best filmsabout romantic relationships ever made.
552;Diane Keaton is tremendous, the supporting cast isfull of gems and Allen himself takes the leap to present himself as areal (if funny) human being and not a walking joke.
553;And brilliantlyphotographed by the great Gordon Willis of 'The Godfather' and many ofmost important films of the 70s and 80s.
554;wildly funny and ultimately heartbreaking.
555;up relationshipsNOT identifying with a lot of this film.
556;I loved it in my late teenswhen it first came out, and I love it even more 32 years later.
557;A film of enormous wit, humor, invention, andunderstanding of the human heart.
558;Its completely unique, playful andidiosyncratic in style and approach, but that experimentation somehowonly makes it more accessible and universal.
559;But the gains in depth, clarity, richnessgive the film more immediacy, and certainly make the blu.
560;rayworthwhile if you love the film.
561;I Always loved this movie, and this version is the best looking yet.
562;The picture is nicely restored, without to much sacrifice on it's original look.
563;hollywood like script, and charming Diane Keaton, help make this one of the best motion pictures of all time.
564;but he does it so well!Tony Roberts, Carol Kane, Shelley Duval, Christopher Walken and even Paul Simon, are all terrific in this story about two people growing apart.
565;flawless editing by Ralph Rosenblum.
566;This genius really helped create the structure of the film to make it the polished gem that it is.
567;I was so happy when it won all the Oscars that it did, despite what a lot of other folks thought.
568;anamorphic Best PictureQuintessential Woody Allen.
569;It's a good movie otherwise and I can see why it is known as one of Woody Allen's best.
570;The video came on time and in great condition.
571;I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys Woody Allen
572;i went through the usual, should I go say hi to her and tell her what an inspiration she is to our female generation?
573;Instead, I opted to leave her alone and enjoy her day of shopping.
574;but I hope that she understands what an influence she has had on young women, and part of it is because of Annie Hall.
575;this movie is funny and sweet and is a good start in watching any Keaton/Allen movie!
576;annie Hall, made in 1977, is a classic.
577;It pokes fun at many social mores that we take for granted and I found myself laughing throughout.
578;And, to make it even better, there are some wonderful film techniques.
579;Annie Hall has really truly stood the test of time.
580;There are movies known for their intense war scenes and eardrum.
581;into the ups and downs of a real life relationship.
582;Annie Hall is subtle in its investigations, and you have to close up the laptop, put away the distractions, and really allow yourself to get swept away by this one to catch the numerous little things that are so true to life.
583;allen and Keaton are both, in many ways, playing themselves.
584;The subtitles are great, helping show the oh.
585;They have the first kiss, the walks along the water, the break.
586;ups, the fear of spiders, the meeting of the families.
587;The way they change is part of the joy here.
588;We get to see them mature and broaden their horizons, sometimes with good results, sometimes with a step back.
589;There are just so many little touches like that, things that resonate with people who have lived and loved New York.
590;There are brilliant angles on the LA culture .
591;And that's for about 2 seconds, when Annie's family is sharing the screen with Allen's family.
592;It goes to show how fully we as an audience have come to expect that women are the supporting cast to the men.
593;still, a lot of great insights here, and a love story not only to Annie, but also to New York City.
594;Well I more than liked it!
595;It is so realistic of what happens with romances.
596;It has since become my favorite.
597;I love how Allen combines humor and drama in this movie.
598;diane Keaton gives a *wonderful* performance in this movie as Annie Hall.
599;She is both strong and weak at the same time.
600;When she wants to do something, she does it.
601;If you are a Woody Allen fan, you'll most likely love the movie.
602;It was sweet, funny, cute and endearing.
603;In this movie, Woody Allens best, you can see where others later borrowed freely from Annie Hall .
604;The whole New York bit, inside the apartments, in line at the movies, the humor and the timing you can see where Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld also borrowed from Woody Allens masterpiece.
605;Now you see where even great ideas get recycled.
606;This is one of the few comedy films to win the 'Best Picture of the Year' Oscar (in 1977).
607;Simply put, it is the funniest film i have ever seen!
608;Woody Allen wrote a fantastic script, full of riotious one.
609;And the insights into the interpersonal relationships that we all go through with the opposite sex are very touching and revealing.
610;Annie Hall is arguably Woody Allen's best film ever.
611;portrait of his affair with the luminous Diane Keaton, Allen paints a love affair in his beloved New York City, full of all the neurosis, eccentricities and oddball humor associated with Woody Allen.
612;There are too many hilarious scenes to mention, other than they are non.
613;This is also one of Allen's most inventive films, using split frame scenes for discussions between opposed families, inter.
614;it should also be noted that many stars got a big start from this film.
615;Carole Kane is featured as one of Alvy's good.
616;Diane Keaton's brother is played by a typically creepy Christopher Walken and her mother by the noble Colleen Dewhurst.
617;academy Award winner for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Actress, this film is timeless.
618;it makes it MUCH more enjoyable to open the mind and watch it cold ).
619;Annie Hall is a wonderful and hysterical representation of Allen's neurotic New York Jew self.
620;Allen and Keaton perform best together in this film"
621;Annie Hall is Woody Allen's best film.
622;This is Allen at his best: We get flawless, meaningful performances from a great cast and the plot moves along at a very good pace.
623;What's more, there's so much comedy in this film it stands out as one of the best comedies I've ever seen.
624;The cinematography is very well done and the choreography works best in crowd scenes and the scenes on the streets of Manhattan.
625;One day Alvy, Rob and a couple of women gather to play indoor tennis.
626;Annie and Alvy also enjoy a pretty good romantic life.
627;Watch and find out!I must say that Woody Allen uses some pretty incredible techniques to show how people can see others.
628;"At another point, Allen has Alvy, Annie and Rob looking on at a party given many years prior for a family member back in Brooklyn
629;annie Hall will always be a timeless love story with so much comedy you'll practically roll over on the floor with laughter.
630;Obviously, this film is a """"must."""
631;This film is highly recommended!
632;I tried watching this movie because everybody says that it is one of the greatest movies of all time, it's been on all the lists, and people say it was really groundbreaking for it's time and all that.
633;This is film is high on film aficionado lists as one of the great American films.
634;Wonderful film, solid transfer but as usual for Woody not much in the way of special features.
635;This was the best movie Woody made from the time when he was still making great movies!
636;Probably the movie that Seinfied got the humor for his show from!
637;He tells Woody that he fantasizes about wrecking his car when he is driving.
638;there are so many more of these types of hilarious scenes!
639;This is a great film to own so you could memorize the lines.
640;i first saw this picture a few years later, with my first real girlfriend (hi, Lisa!)
641;I found it witty and intelligent, as I have with most of Woody Allen's films.
642;annie Hall is, to me, Woody Allen's greatest triumph as a filmmaker and a storyteller.
643;It's a bittersweet, often hilarious recounting of a relationship from its start to its inevitable end.
644;All the angst, the neuroses, and manic phobias that at first seem so idiosyncratic and charming, eventually become tiring and sad.
645;slapping hilarity of many of the scenes help draw us into his world and the relationship he has with Annie (Diane Keaton, marvelous as always), his friends, his family, and the world around him.
646;"The themes are familiar and universal
647;This film will never lose its place in my heart as one of the best films I've ever seen.
648;More words than most of Hollywood could actually pronounce.
649;I just received a brand new Annie Hall Blu Ray Movie.
650;My wife and I both retired just saw this on t. v. and it looked great!!
651;I am a fanatic with comedy movies.
652;This Woody Allen film brings back fine memories of days past back to the 70's.
653;you could argue that this is the best Woody Allen film ever.
654;so many films and other comedians directors have been greatly influenced by it.
655;i feel this is one of the greatest films released in the last 25 years.
656;MINI REVIEW: I have a love/hate relationship with Woody Allen pictures so take this with a grain of salt.
657;Emotional angst galore in the true Woody Allen style.
658;It won four Oscars at the 1978 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, though Allen was disappointed with its plotting as well as other factors.
659;It is an amazing film.
660;Full of creativity and special ways to tell a story.
661;i thing that this movie is a piece of art, very well done with humor and romance.
662;i really enjoy myself watching it.
663;It's not quite as funny as Woody Allen's more slapstick earlier films (such as Bananas, Sleeper, and Take the Money and Run), but this film won Best Picture for a reason.
664;This is a special interest movie, and there can only be lovers or haters of the same.
665;So, let me acknowledge Woody's intelligence, and appreciate the many that worship this product.
666;By this stage of Allen's career he had become more sophisticated in his comedy and less reliant of the slapstick, as good as it was, of his earlier films.
667;Diane Keaton returns as a romantic foil for Allen once again.
668;woody Allen and Diane Keaton are great together.
669;Keaton also started a whole new trend in women's clothing that lasted years.
670;Allen is at the top of his game as a director and actor and Diane Keaton shows what a great actress she is.
671;as well as a pretty good singer.
672;Keep your eyes peeled for small roles for Christopher Walken, Shelley Duvall, Sigourney Weaver, Truman Capote and Jeff Goldblum.
673;As noted above in """"Sleeper"""" the film has plenty of course grain, even during daylight scenes."""
674;As for the movie itself, it's one of Allen's best, thanks to Diane Keaton.
675;It's hard to believe the movie is now over 30 years old, but Keaton is as charming as ever.
676;I always liked Woody Allen's ensemble films better than the ones in which he is the main star.
677;Annie Hall which has a large cast but essentially lingers on Allen's relationship with Annie(Diane Keaton) till the very end is a sweet if structureless film.
678;Through many episodic stretches we are treated to many hilarious jokes and innovative techniques, such as consulting people on the street for their opinion etc., but the movie also has a real heart, especially in the final scenes, we see Woody being rejcted after having flown thousands of miles from N.Y.(beloved) to L. a.(detested)to ask Annie back.
679;But eventually I did see Annie Hall and I loved it right away.
680;woody is absolutely brilliant in this film.
681;"This is the one that took off and began a whole series of ""relationship"" films that in my opinion have all been excellent."
682;"i highly recommend this film and all the others including ""Deconstructing Harry"", ""Manhatten"", ""Manhatten Murder Mystery"", and ""Hannah and her sisters""."
683;Diane Keaton is a treasure!
684;My husband and I watch this movie every year!
685;It's part of our Top.25 best movies of all time.
686;and makes me laugh every time!
687;First time I have seen it and I am 70.
688;I love Diane Keaton and she is a treat then and now.
689;She's eccentric, pert, obnoxiously funny and genuinely human.
690;This role won Diane Keaton her Best Actress Oscar.
691;Woody is of course his usually brilliant depricating self.
692;The film also took home the Best Picture Oscar.
693;Colors are dated but nicely balanced.
694;Bottom line: An engaging romantic comedy with a twist of neurotic frenzy that is really irresistable to watch.
695;It's pretty much the life and times of a short.
696;There's very little doubt that Woody is a talented writer and there are plenty of classic scenes in this movie.
697;This was my first time seeing this movie and after thirty years it still has something relevant to say about relationships.
698;I got a kick of seeing so many (now) veteran actors.
699;The Bottom Line:A delightful, original film starring a very funny Woody Allen and perfectly.
700;cast Diane Keaton, Annie Hall is one of the best movies Allen has ever made and one of the best romantic comedies ever made by anyone.
701;Keaton and Woody are at their best.
702;This is a multilayered film that is funny, romantic and beautifully shot.
703;I love the Woody from the seventies.
704;A really true true classic not to miss, like Manhattan!
705;Annie Hall is a light and whimsical journey through the New York dating game.
706;As usual, Woody Allen pokes plenty of fun at himself and Diane Keaton turns in a great performance.
707;What follows is good old fashioned fun.
708;It is laugh out loud funny at points, and generally just a feel good movie.
709;this is one that everyone should see.
710;This is Allen's best, funniest, most honest movie and for me, the high.
711;The earlier films such as Bananas, Take the Money and Run and Sleeper, were really funny movies and can be enjoyed for exactly what they are .
712;Despite the title, Woody is the main character and Annie, played to air.
713;"head perfection by Diane Keaton, shares the second spot with the greatest ""extra"" in the world ."
714;"NYC
715;a love story about mis.
716;But the wonderful acting and sharp dialogue turn what could have been a nice little movie into a memorable classic.
717;The interplay among the characters, the dripping New York sarcasm (LA takes a well.
718;deserved beating at the hands of Allen's character) and the shots he takes at a few of his fellow New Yorkers (the scene at the movie theater is priceless) require that you listen to the dialogue.
719;Again, this is Allen at his best, which is saying a lot.
720;And there is no better way to escape, for me, than by watching a smart, well written comedy.
721;Anne Hall is a great movie all movie lovers should see.
722;A good movie, but I felt some other Allen's movies are better, like husbands and wife's or Hanna and her sisters .
723;Woody Allen directed this classic romantic comedy, but the great Ralph Rosenbloom turned it into an Oscar winner.
724;Sometimes sweet and affectionate, sometimes acidly satirical, and sometimes laugh.
725;pleasing blockbusters as Star Wars and Close Encounters of the Third Kind.
726;Keaton, who won the Best Actress Oscar, is marvelously appealing.
727;This is a great, classic movie!
728;The film travels back and forth in time through Alvy's life and we gets glimpses of his childhood, his first marriage and other benchmarks in his life.
729;Ms. Keaton is delightful as the majorly quirky Annie and Tony Roberts is great as Alvy's best friend.
730;The film was a major triumph and actually beat out Star Wars for the 1977 Best Picture Oscar with Mr. Allen taking home the Best Director and Screenwriter Awards and Ms. Keaton winning the Best Actress statuette.
731;Although it is considered to be one of his best and my kids really enjoyed it, I liked it but didn't love it.
732;Still worth a watch if your a Woody Allen fan!
733;Woody Allen's Best Picture Winner is one of the funniest films I have seen in some time.
734;I cant say this is his best, for I have not seen them all (or nearly enough) to compare.
735;Played off really well with superb dialogue, shot in a somewhat discontinuous style.
736;Truly and deservedly a classic by every standard.
737;Nonetheless, a great film for the whole family (excluding young children).
738;We thought it was so funny back in the 60's and 70's.
739;don't we all and there's the appeal.
740;She's a single woman that sleeps with her boyfriends.
741;allen is the first nerd to make it big in the Post.
742;For that reason, Allen is an important, pivotal figure culturally.
743;He has solidified Borst Belt comedy with pseudo.
744;Walla, Jew and hot chicksa, yeah!
745;I collect the winners of the """"Best Picture"""" category and was surprised to see this as a winner."""
746;If you are a Woody Allen fan, you will enjoy this transfer onto Blu.
747;A classic movie by a truly talented actor and writer.
748;He's an inspiration, at least professionally.
749;So I figured I'd give it a shot and see if I've just been missing something all these years.
750;If you insist, documentaries are better.
751;One of my favorites finally went Blu.
752;ray just seems to make a mega classic even more enjoyable and give it a facelift of sorts.
753;In my perception, the film looks and feels newer and the poignant performances just POP!!
754;This film is so full of one on one exchanges and closeups that 1080 just enhances the experience.
755;Before it, he was primarily known as the crafter of a series of very, very funny films.
756;This film belongs in both worlds, as funny as his earlier films, and as serious as any of his later.
757;He was able to strike a perfect balance here that he was never able to strike again.
758;I would prefer the balance he struck in this, his masterpiece.
759;although this is a serious film at heart, it is also a comic masterpiece.
760;The structure of the entire film is something unique to Woody.
761;At points he addresses the audience directly.
762;At the same time, he seamlessly injects the kind of self.
763;deprecating humor that was the mainstay of both his stand up routines and earlier movies.
764;It is one of the most virtuosic comedy films ever made.
765;She had, after all, played an important role in THE GODFATHER films.
766;She had appeared in two previous Woody Allen films, and had become famous as the person in HAIR who would not remove her clothes.
767;"She created a great character, and the ""Annie Hall"" look had considerable influence on fashion for some time after the film was released, and anyone hearing ""la."
768;"dah"" knows exactly where it came from."
769;one thing that isn't sufficiently noted is the incredible eye for talent that Woody Allen's casting directors have displayed over the years.
770;The number of major stars to appear in Woody Allen films very early in their careers is eye popping.
771;Christopher Walken has a small but memorable role as Annie's insane brother, Beverly D'Angelo has a small role as an actress, and Woody's tall, attractive date at the end of the film when running into Annie on the sidewalk is none other than Sigourney Weaver.
772;This film and Hannah and Her Sisters are my two favorites among Allen's many films.
773;The supporting cast is among the strongest in Allen's films thus far.
774;I especially enjoy the performances by Tony Roberts (Rob), Carol Kane (Allison), Christopher Walken (Duane Hall) and Colleen Dewhurst (Mom Hall).
775;One of the most memorable scenes involves Marshall McLuhan (as himself) who corrects a pseudo.
776;"Annie Hall received an Academy Award as best film and Allen received two (for directing and co. writing best original screenplay with Marshall Brickman)
777;The film is still refreshing and entertaining after more than 25 years.
778;One other highly subjective opinion: unlike so many (perhaps even most) of Allen's other films, Annie Hall has many moments of tenderness and even poignancy amidst the always clever conversations.
779;Its charm as well as candor are wholly authentic and sustained until the inevitable conclusion.
780;Simply Allen's best film .
781;Annie Hall is probably one of my favorite 2 or 3 movies ever.
782;It is almost like seeing an entirely new film.
783;The picture and widescreen are spectacular.
784;wing conservative but I love Woody Allen and I especially love Annie Hall.
785;It is, no doubt, a generational thing.
786;I loved her and I love Annie Hall.
787;ANNIE HALL, Woody Allen's finest, continues to define Manhattan for me in indescribably moving ways: the way people interact"
788;This movie brims to overflow with biting wit, trait.
789;specific characterizations, and so much truth it is impossible to resist.
790;Diane Keaton, in an autobiographical role, exudes so much raw talent she invades your every pore, and makes you laugh and cry along the way.
791;Really a series of perfectly realized moments, with a plot that reveals itself only as a sum of its considerable parts, ANNIE HALL does it all.
792;You will be moved by the sweetness and genuine affection between the two infinitely neurotic lead players (Allen and Keaton), and you will laugh without fail at nearly every one of many jokes, sight gags and delectable bit characters.
793;It is thoroughly satisfying and completely entertaining.
794;Alan played himself once again in this movie, but it was still refreshing and interesting.
795;And, of course Diane Keaton was outstanding.
796;One of Woody Allen's best comedies.
797;It won best picture the year it came out, 1977.
798;(Which is nice, but upsetting as a Star Wars fan!)
799;Loved the early Woody Allen movies.
800;In 1977, Woody Allen abandoned slapstick comedy for something greater and more personal.
801;It won four Oscars: Best Actress for Diane Keaton, Best Director for Allen, Best Picture for Charles Joffe, and Best Screenplay for Allen and Marshall Brickman.
802;"dah"" line) and for a short time they are blissfully happy."
803;Annie Hall proves Allen's creative genius.
804;He uses animation (Snow White!)
805;"exposure (the famous scene where Annie's ""ghost"" leaves her body during sex), subtitles (to show the characters' unspoken thoughts), and other clever cinematic devices to great effect."
806;Annie Hall also clicks as a comedy even though it was originally a murder mystery.
807;Annie Hall might be my favorite movie, and the Blu Ray transfer is terrific, keeping the film grain while the picture looks sharper than ever.
808;One of the funniest and saddest movies about relationships ever made, Annie Hall is a timeless and endlessly inventive classic.
809;It is still worth watching again.
810;You don't need me to tell you it's a classic.
811;If you haven't seen it, see it.
812;If you have, see it again.
813;It would take much more than a 1000 words to decribe how good this movie is.
814;It is without question, i believe the funniest comedy ever made.
815;In my opinion i think it's the greatest work of art in this century(i'm not kidding) I'm still in awe of the film every time i see it, which is well over 250 times.
816;The directing is absolutely brilliant.
817;Annie hall not only belongs in that category, i think it was the greatest film ever made.
818;It's so creative, it's frightening.
819;Plenty of reviews here claim this is Woody's best and I'm hard.
820;winning role), the Waspy flibbertigibbet who wants more out of life but she's not sure what.
821;a superb and passionately funny film between the hot cold relationship between two people.
822;This film captures the best of both worlds.
823;As a result, I think it is Woody Allen's finest.
824;and that sums up my view on life'.
825;Annie Hall is Woody Allen's finest diagnosis on love and life.
826;Annie is an endearing character in her men's shirts and ties, the grass smoking temptress who unwittingly draws the intellectually fraught Alvie Singer (Allen )into her seemingly innocent web .
827;The couple poke fun at New York Intellectuals: 'Samuel Beckett .
828;And the transient curve of modern sexual relationships.
829;It is a fine movie, packed with many jokes and superb life observations.
830;This is the first Woody Allen film (1977) to be more than just an outright wacky comedy, because although this has great comedy moments throughout, it also has a lot to say about relationships.
831;allen plays a successful stand.
832;up scenes are great, because ten years earlier Woody Allen was a stand.
833;We hear them talk but see what they are think in subtitles:Alvy: Photography's interesting, 'cause, you know, it's.
834;In many ways this is Woody Allens perfect film.
835;It still has a huge comedic element to it, but under the comedy there are some serious points made.
836;Woody Allen is definitely a love him or hate him kind of guy.
837;For those that don't know much about him or his work, this movie is a wonderful place to start.
838;Fantasy, nostalgia, tenderness, and some of the funniest dialogue in movie history make this one of the best movies ever.
839;i've seen it several times now (I own it), and I love it more with each viewing.
840;What can be said of Woody Allen's 1977 masterpiece and comedic gem Annie Hall?!
841;stop laugh riot, Annie Hall is poignant and forever relevant thanks to the severity of these relationships quips and their seemingly 'straight.
842;viewing after viewing, after viewing.
843;So, Annie Hall is an excellent movie, that won 4 Oscars in '77, including Best Picture Award.
844;The Amazon service makes it easy also.
845;A true work of genius.
846;Even by Allen's own standards, this movie is a classic.
847;while Annie Hall certainly bears considerable repeated viewing, it is simply stunning first time through.
848;Apart from the brilliant dialogue and character depth, it contains so many all.
849;I loved the part on the first date when he asks Annie if he can kiss her before they start, just to take away the tension of will.
850;they kiss, so that they may more easily relax and enjoy their first time out.
851;woody Allen shoehorned so many brilliant and original ideas into Annie Hall that it is staggering to recall that they were all from the same movie.
852;"hating grandmother to the kids in his class telling the camera what they ended up as in adult life, serve to keep you off balance, so that you never slide into a ""well I can see what's coming up next"" state of complacency."
853;allen is a master when it comes to relationships and human failings (and strengths) and his hilarious handling of sexual interactions .
854;"makes this one of those rare movies in which virtually everybody can find something to make you squirm and say, ""Oh man, he's right""."
855;annie Hall is classy, it's beautiful, it is full of love, wisdom and compassion, and above all it is utterly hilarious.
856;"A breathtaking work of genius (repetition on ""genius"", there) from a man who has no equal in the film industry."
857;"Watching ""Annie Hall"" is to see the director."
858;He wonders if his efforts to expand Annie's horizons really was a worthwhile endeavor.
859;Annie Hall is the one film Allen has made that audiences can most relate to.
860;Anyone who has even been in a relationship can see the universal truths he relates through his characters.
861;Watching Alvy fruitlessly try to intellectualize his feelings for Annie not only proves to be a fertile source of laughs but also puts forth the notion that happy endings in life are dishearteningly elusive.
862;"If they thouroughly enjoyed the film and also laughed at all the right moments, they ""passed"" the test."
863;in my opinion, the film is pure brilliance.
864;It is witty and a wonderful characature of neurosis, men and women relationships, New York City, California, and the time it took place in.
865;I love that Woody always has his character being with these very beautiful young women.
866;And Allen tells his story with such intelligence and supreme humor.
867;An added joy in watching this film is seeing several now very famous personalities in small roles and who knew Paul Simon could act?
868;Highly recommended to anyone but diehard Woody Allen haters.
869;This is one of my favorite Woody movie.
870;As usual, the dialogue is excellent and the actors are terrific.
871;I have read and critics have felt that this film is by far Woody's best, it isn't.
872;Winning the best picture award is beyond me!
873;after seeing the movie I caught a glimpse of what Woody Allen's personality is really like.
874;This is a timeless movie.
875;I liked this movie when I didn't like NR and I like this movie now that I like NR.
876;It took me a few years to finally watch this movie after hearing a lot of my favorite comedians and actors proclaim this to be one of their favorites.
877;I loved the characters and the format.
878;This is one of those times when I can appreciate how much others might like a movie and yet realize its just not for me.
879;I tell you this as an artist,I think you'll understand.
880;a laugh out loud classic.
881;Annie Hall is a classic movie and I love it and have loved it for many years.
882;In the original film there are clever subtitles stating what the two characters are actually thinking and feeling while spouting their nonsense.
883;I still really enjoyed the movie I only wish that such a classic scene wouldn't have been overlooked.
884;Everyone has their own favourites .
885;I think that Annie Hall is a total classic.
886;"I have always wanted my kids to see it
887;I mean they usually are in any movie, after a while, but I was hoping that the movie would survive that, as the themes of love and dating and breakup are of course universal.
888;As an avid Woody Allen fan, I consider it his masterpiece.
889;Even the final line, """"most of us needs the eggs"""", is brilliant."""
890;the perfect Darwinian ponto final to an postmodern pastiche of Fellini, Bergman and Welles that questions the nature of gender, relationships and existence itself.
891;It's one of the few films composed almost entirely of flashbacks that works, free from the usual side order of corn.
892;Outstanding performances are turned in by Diane Keaton, Tony Roberts, Carol Kane, Shelley Duvall, Colleen Dewhurst, Woody Allen himself and a newcomer named Christopher Walken.
893;"What ""Citizen Kane"" started, ""Annie Hall"" completes."
894;in terms of scope, range of emotions, philosophical integrity, cinematography, etc.
895;I am sure that it will go down as one of his all time greatest.
896;"This movie is rated # 31 on Newsweek Magazine's ""Best 100 movies of the last century""."
897;Star Wars got gipped when this nonsense won best pic and the last time I checked George Lucas remains a fine upstanding honorable decent human being.
898;I know Allen has his fans, but they must all be people with an ability to listen to actors talk.
899;stop banter, seasoned with a lot of complaining and angst.
900;"It's about time someone brings the ""genius"" back from his piedestal."
901;This is certainly Woody's greatest film to date.
902;it is common to read Woody Allen's films in self.
903;Plus Woody makes it so tempting to view his main characters not as Alvie Singer (his name in this picture), but as Woody Allen .
904;in other words, the person who emerges from Woody Allen's pictures is the real.
905;In Annie Hall, Woody reflects on past relationships, in particular his relationship with the girl of the title (played by Diane Keaton).
906;It is dramatic and funny throughout, and ends on a surprisingly touching note.
907;I am aware that this movie won an Oscar but truly, I have not a slightest idea why.
908;I don't know, I didn't really enjoy it, but I was able to finish watching it and for that I gave it 2 stars.
909;Annie Hall is a great film for the ages.
910;Woody Allen does a great job portraying a man who questions modern relationships and struggles through life, so I think most people can relate to this film.
911;With hilarious scenes like when Woody pulls out the author of the book to make one guy look like a schmuck is very funny, it's no wonder why this film won best picture.
912;The film will have you on an emotional roller coaster ride that'll leave you speechless.
913;You'll be laughing, crying, and even cheering for Woody through the film.
914;Although the film is a bit paced, it's still a great movie.
915;This means, if you have a widescreen television, you will have black bars on all four sides of the picture.
916;Full of neuroses and classic comedy bits, Woody Allen's Annie Hall is that rare breed of movie: a romantic comedy that's actually funny, moving, and original.
917;spirited Annie Hall (played with superb wit and energy by a young Diane Keaton).
918;Paul Simon also makes an extended appearance as musician Tony Lacey.
919;annie Hall is the first Woody Allen movie I've seen, and now I can't believe I waited this long.
