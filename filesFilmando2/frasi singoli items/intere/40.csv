1;If you have seen neither, then I recommend viewing Before Sunset first.
2;I know this is out of sequence, but the actors have improved over time, and filmmaking craftsmanship is more natural.
3;The bottom line is that this film is all about its characters and the dialogue they share between eachother.
4;You immediately discover the anxiety and connection still exists without a pause.
5;But I am definitely pleased with story.
6;Celine and Jessie definitely create magice in the space they occupy together.
7;Celine (Julie Delpy) still has the quirkiness, beauty, and naive honesty of nine years before as well as the non.
8;Though the ending is technically open, you can easily guess the rest.
9;julie Delpy is stunning as Celine and full of very human contradictions.
10;She is both graceful and awkward, idealistic and jaded, anti.
11;Many of the qualities we loved about her in Before Sunrise are still there
12;She laughs about all Parisians being unhappy, yet we get a sense that there is an allure in a romantic, intelligent brooding.
13;She takes action by working for an organization similar to Greenpeace removing her from the category of whiner.
14;It's not as romantic as Before Sunrise and has fewer distractions like the drunken poet and old fortune teller (except for the barbecue party in Celine's courtyard towards the end which was very enchanting), but still is full of Parisian charms and beautiful scenes.
15;they are constantly on the move, turning corners, the clock also moving forward as they try and go back.
16;Towards the end when they are walking up Celine's large and tall spiral stairway we get a sense of them rising above time, and they are both quiet as if aware that something big is about to happen.
17;like other reviewers have written, you can feel as though you are witnessing something real.
18;It's a place on screen that takes you to a beautiful place inside and leaves you aching for more, from them, and in your own life.
19;They seemed more passionate, more powerful, and especially more human.
20;From their first meeting in the bookstore until the finale in Celine's apartment, I was fully immersed in their conversation.
21;I wanted to know everything I could about both of them, and I did.
22;I loved hearing about Celine's passion for the environment, and Jesse's distraught marriage.
23;It brought these two characters out of the screen and into our lives.
24;what made this film work on such a higher level than the first were the actors.
25;This is probably Hawke's greatest performance in years.
26;His relaxed actions made us feel relaxed around him, yet quietly pushing for him to be closer to Celine.
27;He looked and felt like a man that has been dreaming of this encounter all his life, and it finally happened.
28;You could see the excitement in his eyes to see Delpy again.
29;It was more than just acting, he put so much heart into this performance that it was clearly displayed for all to see.
30;I loved Celine much more in the sequel because she kept us guessing.
31;finally, I would like to say that Linklater is growing with his films, and this was a crowning achievement for him.
32;He powerfully and delicately built a sequel that was for superior than the original.
33;He continued with a similar format as the first, but gave us stronger characters and another beautiful city.
34;The language in this film is intense.
35;Listen to the words that come from Ethan and Julie, they embody so much of our culture and our lives.
36;overall, this was a brilliant film.
37;This is one of the ultimate love stories that will remain on your minds far after the film is over.
38;The intimate final lines will continually reverberate as the best ever in a movie.
39;This was a huge step up from the original, and is one of the best films of the year.
40;It is a mature film that explores the power of love in a way that no other Hollywood film could.
41;Check out this film to hear social commentary of our lives, fall in love, and especially to see the beauty of Paris.
42;I tried to enjoy this movie, and kept hoping for it to get better.
43;Released in 1995, Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise became a Generation X romantic masterpiece.
44;at the end of the movie, they promise to meet up in Vienna six months later.
45;He has written a novel based on their time in Vienna, and although at first speechless, soon both have a lot to talk about.
46;The streetscapes are pretty, and they make the time go faster.
47;Building the suspense of the story.
48;Hawke has been the occasional success like Training Day.
49;Delpy's career has crashed and burned.
50;That regret is wasteful, and passion is always compromised by real life.
51;With seductive ease, they navigate the new terrain of each other's heart.
52;Feeling they're rhythmic beat, you hope for them time will stand still.
53;Very disappointed after seeing Before Sunrise and enjoying it so much.
54;I love the way Celine's outlook on life and things changes so much over the years they are apart, but meeting Jesse again in France I think really centers her back to her true self.
55;i love both of these movies and they are in my hall of fame.
56;It was like having a,good long stimulating conversation with a friend, and I actually felt better for having watched it.
57;but mostly just great dialogue.
58;Very short compared to first and last, but still great dialogue between Hawke and Delpy who are, in this one, as in the other two, fabulous in their roles.
59;It was a great movie about being young and in love.
60;Two people have a magical night together, and plan to meet again in six months time.
61;Before Sunrise ended on that note, and being something of a romantic, I always liked to think they both came back as they promised, and got together.
62;A rarity among sequels, it manages to equal its predecessor.
63;What makes it work is that the characters really do act like people who have aged a decade.
64;This is a great touch of realism.
65;I've found my wayFor love came just in time.
66;since Jesse and Celine do get their happy ending .
67;or rather, happy beginning .
68;in this film, I really hope they don't make another sequel.
69;Better to leave the characters on a high note.
70;Even though the entire movie just involves two people talking to each other, it draws you into their magical world and leaves you wanting more.
71;hollywood today is about glorifying the magnificent
72;And yet, somewhere during the film (during the car ride home for me), this small story of an anonymous passion still managed to become magnificent.
73;So as they go through these stages of conversation it becomes brilliantly easy for viewers to relate and remember such moments they themselves have had.
74;Coupled with that tiny fiction of meeting a dazzling foreigner on a train and spending a night together in Vienna, this movie was heaven
75;I was lucky to catch a screening Before Sunset on June 26th.
76;If you are a fan of the first movie, you will love this one as well.
77;One of the brilliant things about the movie is to see how the characters have changed over time, they are the same people with nine years of life experience under their belts.
78;One of the things I loved about the first film was the ambiguous ending.
79;The ending of this one is even better.
80;It doesn't cop out with the typical hollywood happy ending and manages to be completely satisfying while retaining the same ambiguity as the first one.
81;In short, this is the rare film that isn't dumbed down for the masses and stays true to itself and it's characters.
82;Its a charming, romantic movie with mainly dialogue.
83;never making a lasting connection with another human being.
84;the prose and the characters are beautiful in this film, and also the first film.
85;They touched my heart and made me feel things that I haven't felt in a while .
86;I love the ambiguity at the end of the film .
87;Love this trilogy, and these two are really well paired.
88;Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke are really comfortable together and it makes for an excellent story.
89;Love the conversational style, real content and timeframe .
90;this movie is the most perfect romantic film I have ever seen .
91;Great acting, very touching moments, you can feel the growing tension between the two lovers.
92;But before watch this movie it is very important that you have seen Before Sunrise.
93;this first movie holds a great bunch of dreams of me.
94;i've found myself in the role of Ethan Hawke,as it was my favorite dream,to travel all over Europe,all by myself.
95;this movie carried this dream of me until today as well (you guessed it right.
96;first of all it starts real fast
97;in the first one all the things were more natural,more sincere,more innocent.
98;i realy couldn't find any of the naturalism i loved in the first one.
99;paris is one of the most wonderful cities in Europe and i expected to see some great places as well,as the first one.
100;it's a very touching and romantic movie and i would recommend it to anyone.
101;after all, love is innocent and honest itself.
102;that one creates dreams and strong feelings.
103;I loved Before Sunrise and my expectations for Before Sunset were high.
104;and they were definitely met!Before Sunset actually gives the audience credit for having enough imagination to figure out what is or isn't happening in this movie.
105;It is one of the most mature romances I have seen yet.
106;You should go see Star Wars III instead and you may be more satisfied.
107;They express ideas that they hold to about love, the environment, and religious experience.
108;It's really an enchanting movie.
109;In my honest opinion Before Sunrise(maybe because it carried the energetic youthful spirit of the characters) was better but this movie is still wonderful and definitely more mature.
110;I must add that Julie Delpy was totally realistic and engaging in this.
111;I found myself like Ethan Hawke's character, who just observes how incredible this woman is.
112;Celine is one of the better written female characters of movie history(IMO).
113;I'm hoping that Julie Delpy gets a Best Actress nomination because she gave a very beautiful performance (especially the last scene.
114;In fact, I love US, both the country and the people.
115;the two movies are meshed together very well.
116;It's interesting to see how the old lovers have changed yet are still the same, and how their chance meeting 9 years earlier in Vienna impacted their lives .
117;in my opinion Before Sunrise is still the better of the two movies , but Before Sunset stirs up many of the same memories, and emotions .
118;This is a fantastic little movie about a woman and a man in love with each other after one night together nine years ago.
119;I'd rate it in my top ten best.
120;Love the conversation between the two of them.
121;Will be watching it again and again.
122;I was recommended to see this movie by a woman with whom we have a story that is much like this one, even better.
123;The dialogue is strong and offers a glimpse to the eternal question of when and why we fall in love.
124;Watch Before Sunrise the first film of this wonderful trilogy to see how it all started.
125;Excellent actors, great script and beautiful cinematography.
126;Don't think I've ever been this moved by a movie.
127;it's really surprising how 80 minutes of conversation can be so engrossing.
128;The dialogue is extremely well done, I must say.
129;the staircase shot is really one of the most amazing things I've ever seen on film.
130;i think this is the most heartfelt 5 stars I've ever given.
131;Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk.
132;and more talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk.
133;and more talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk.
134;and more talk, talk, talk, talk.
135;and more talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk.
136;and more talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk.
137;and more talk, talk, talk, talk.
138;One of the most charming films in many years, Before Sunset gives love a second chance with two enormously believable actors in their original roles.
139;the notion of a second chance with the one who got away is every middle age and older individual's daydream, yet so few adults get an opportunity to have their dream come back in their life.
140;with an abandonment of youthful pretext, the mature Celine and Jesse admit how the other was the innocent and most intriguing moment for them.
141;that of meeting again with the lost love.
142;Richard Linklater creates an enjoyable and mature film of resolution and renewal as the story of Celine and Jesse begins and ends at the exact right moment to leave audiences satisfied.
143;using both the on screen chemistry of his actors and the perfect timing of their storyline to resume the characters next move, Before Sunset is perhaps one of those rare films that is a better film than the first installment.
144;Hawke is not a boyish student, and Delpy is seductive with a French confidence that exudes sexiness.
145;The film's locations, dialogue, and music by Delpy as well is just right for anyone who wants to step in the shoes of Jesse and Celine, and perhaps, take the next step along their crossed new path to happiness?
146;if you didn't it is required viewing .
147;if you did you need to see it again to remind yourself how good these two are together!
148;This is a perfect light romantic comedy for date night.
149;Though now that I've seen it, I have to say I am really happy that they made one.
150;The dialogue, written by Hawke, Delpy and director Richard Linklater, has a realistic tone, and is full of humor that helps the more sour parts of the movie go down easier.
151;the movie offers up another ambigious ending that once again asks us whether we are jaded or a romantic.
152;i really, really liked Before Sunset on every level.
153;that said, Before Sunset is an excellent, stand.
154;Before Sunset is absolutely beautiful, so lovely it will make your heart ache.
155;Seemingly effortless dialogue between two young actors on mature subjects.
156;I didn't feel it was quite as good as the other two but it was worth seeing.
157;A chance meeting after a number of years brings the two characters back together to continue a talking relationship.
158;They make it seem so relaxed and yet fraught with tension and hope.
159;The ending leaves the viewer wondering and the temptation to supply the next scene.
160;I was prepared to give this nice movie 5 stars.
161;Other than that, this is a wonderful film.
162;I hope they make another one!
163;Interesting story about the human condition.
164;Knowledge of the first movie's subject matter is essential to watching this second part.
165;The actors are wonderful and the script writing is spot on for the characters!The characters meet years after their first encounter .
166;I should have bought it!
167;Close your eyes and you won't miss anything, except Ethan Hawke's constant smirking.
168;Julie Delpy's face is great to look at.
169;Again, characterised by solid dialogue throughout, it draws the viewer in as we become almost voyeurs .
170;The best part of this movie is learning about how they made it.
171;It was really neat to see Julie sing the song at the end, too.
172;Great to know what happened after they left each other at the train station.
173;And if you want to know what happens after this movie ends, you've got to go see Before Midnight.
174;The dialogue in each of the movies is so intelligent and authentic.
175;This is a good film with a good storyline.
176;I wanted to like this movie as the original was so fascinating.
177;But I've gotten older and wiser, and fantasy no longer captures my attention so easily.
178;Their rediscovery of each other and the scenery of back street Paris worked beautifully.
179;Their candid and witty conversation kept my interest through the whole movie.
180;The chemistry that they bring, and the moments of truth, makes the two seem so real.
181;truly a pleasure to watch
182;Very good dialogue and wittiness.
183;If you can appreciate the art of natural dialogue and quirky romance then you'd love this movie as much as I did.
184;But Before Sunset was so much more real and mature.
185;the ending is so pure and well.
186;I previously had seen and enjoyed Before Sunrise.
187;generation sequel Before Midnight, it seemed logical to first watch the immediate sequel.
188;Sunset in fact could be enjoyed on its own without viewing the first entry and would still demand a sequel of its own.
189;Something finally triggered last night, and I finally decided to start up Before Sunrise.
190;Before Sunset answers those questions, and poses a few more (one significant question) is asked about Jesse and Seline's relationship.
191;the dialogue in Before Sunset is even better than Before Sunrise.
192;the ending is ambiguous, but completely in character and consistent with the first film and the observation that Jesse points out about the three journalists: romanticist, the pessimist, and the hopeful realist.
193;In the van ride to Seline's apartment, Jesse vents frustration about his loveless marriage and Seline reaches out with her right hand to touch his head.
194;And, Jesse's very last line I know along with his subtle, tugging of the wedding ring shows that time will not constrain their relationship.
195;That's why I'm more than just hopeful, I believe they re.
196;I'd love to see a third film that confirms that possibility.
197;Completely consistent with Before Sunrise, it is shot in real.
198;Fewer eccentric characters than in the first film.
199;Seline has such amazing charm and her dance at the end of the film just can't help but make you smile.
200;but is compacted with such emotion, sexual tension, and character development and exploration that it just feels so satisfying.
201;Again, like the first film, it's refreshing to see a movie that doesn't need to resort to showing nudity or gratuitous sex or imagery to attract an audience.
202;Stop right there and first watch Before SUNRISE.
203;Doing this will irrevocably cement the bond between the two and legitimize the effect.
204;before SUNRISE is perfect, with great acting.
205;if you can, then Before Sunset is practically perfect in every way.
206;Before sunset is a beautiful film, because it does what few films do.
207;it actually captures the experience of rekindling romantic love.
208;every generation has a contribution to the canon of great films.
209;Future filmgoers will see this as a classic that is gen x's contribution to great screen romances.
210;a film that both expands upon and surpasses the original.
211;If you are tired of American movies where the only attraction are the bullets, this movie is a good option.
212;funny movie (like the American movies that are not all about gunshots).
213;This is more real life.
214;the dialogue is so natural and full of meaning, the scenery is wonderful, and the actors are superb.
215;I believe Linklater/Hawke/Delpy deliberately left the ending up to the audience's interpretation, which I think is always an interesting technique.
216;alone film, this is entertaining and a wonderful display of acting with long dialogues that describe life as we know it.
217;But I highly recommend seeing all 3 films, which then approach 5 stars as a group.
218;In addition to terrific acting, each shows areas of Europe as a background.
219;An amazing expression of life, aging and the change in priorities and meanings.
220;Credit to the actors who can have you totally absorbed just by having a conversation with each other.
221;I remember watching the first one when I was a teenager and I loved it then.
222;All the conversations where real and intimate.
223;In Before Sunset you see how their words really effected the other person.
224;I love the way they captured the realistic discomfort and timidness of meeting a lost love and through time seeing the longing of what could have been.
225;Very realistic in its conversations and feelings.
226;Bought this movie as a gift for my wife.
227;But if you love to hear really creative, interesting conversations that sound like genuine conversations between two people, this is for you.
228;The more I watch this series (yes, I've watched the first two several times), the more I like it.
229;experience the great love of their lives, all within the constraints of an afternoon.
230;This is the one that got me hooked on this series.
231;This is a fantastic sequel to the incredible Romantic masterpiece Before Sunrise.
232;It's chatty, but the dialogue is wonderful and it pulls you through.
233;Still, I loved the ending with her singing her waltz and the ambiguous final scene.
234;I absolutely enjoyed this movie.
235;The intelligent and candid dialogue makes the movie so intriguing and realistic.
236;Before Sunrise/Sunset/Midnight is a great idea.
237;I've immensely enjoyed seeing the relationship develop.
238;kind of boring, but enjoyed the traverlogue.
239;before Midnight trailer looks more interesting.
240;I enjoyed it more maybe because I'm older.
241;The movie is simple, and just relies on banter.
242;It was a good movie.
243;A perfect sequel, and one that actually surpasses the original.
244;I love this movie and it was in brand new condition when I received it.
245;It moves at a slow pace, and there's lots of conversation, but it's all good, like an afternoon spent catching up with an old friend.
246;And I want her apartment!
247;Have seen all three in this trilogy and I think this is the best one.
248;Ethan and Julia are both great.
249;a great follow up to Linklater's Before Sunrise and i would recommend both to anyone!
250;See the first one also.
251;Superb work from Linklater, Delpy and Hawke.
252;the movie is very interesting .
253;In Before Sunrise several topics they discussed actually came to pass in Before Sunset.
254;Loved seeing how they had both matured but that chemistry was still there.
255;let's see a 3rd and maybe 4th and 5th installments of this wonderful journey.
256;and it looks so real and natural.
257;You start with the best of your life and superficial till you get deeper and deeper.
258;And also about the police talk and bureaucracy I confirm as well.
259;Given that the movie overall is a so good that you can see it more than once and not get tired of it.
260;Before Sunset has the same fantastic actors as Before Sunrise and is equally as good.
261;I would recommend this movie to both young and old adults.
262;This was actually a very interesting movie.
263;Don't get me wrong: the dialogue is very good.
264;Ethan Hawke tends to pick very poetic touching movies.
265;:) Best part of the movie: when Delpy sings the pretty waltz toward the end.
266;the ending, okay i need help with it.
267;she turns to the side and keeps dancing and then the credits roll.
268;I thought this was going to be a romance story about two people who belonged together and had found one another again.
269;All they seemed to be able to talk about was their one.
270;encourage one another to become a better human being.
271;encourage one another to follow their (unselfish) dreams.
272;Does anybody truly believe that those are extraordinary measures that a spouse should not have to take in order to preserve his family and keep his wedding vows for life????
273;I had to wait many years for this part 2 , It was worth the wait, Great work.
274;part 1 and 2 are works of art.
275;written and acted with fantastic skill.
276;keeps you wanting to watch the movie forever.
277;Watched it again recently (as a mid.30something) and while it didn't have the same feel as an adult, it was still charming and I found myself wanting to know what happens next.
278;I will give it credit for being like the first movie in that they get the story going right away without a lot of fuss or non.
279;important scenes, and like the first, it's all pretty much dialogue.
280;The dialogue in Sunrise is charming, youthful and interesting, and the chemistry between Hawke and Delpy grows and is believable.
281;life rants) they drop it on you that Hawke is married and has a child.
282;Skip this one and keep the good memories of Sunrise intact.
283;It does end quite well .
284;One of my all time favorites!
285;I recommend this movie to anyone who still believes that soul mates actually exist
286;Besides being crystal clear, it was also a memorable end to one of the best romance movies I have ever seen, where romance is intellectually intimate, feverishly passionate, somewhat platonic and totally unavoidable like any true love should be.
287;I recommend watching Before Sunrise first though.
288;It's been nine years since Richard Linklater's thoughtful and touching romance, Before Sunrise graced screens.
289;the good news for fans of Before Sunrise is that Linklater, Hawke and Delpy are able to recreate the chemistry that their two characters had in the first movie.
290;driven movie, effortlessly picking up where the other left off.
291;Hawke and Delpy brought a lot of their own ideas and stories to the film.
292;This was clearly a labour of love for all three as they figured that it would only appeal to the small following who intensely loved the first movie.
293;This movie is exceptionally good to me because the actors ad libbed much of the movie.
294;Because of that, it comes across as very natural and unscripted.
295;The concepts explored give one lots to ponder on and the scenery and setting are amazing.
296;I did not see the first movie but this one is good and you can watch them out of order.
297;The acting was superb and the plot was realistic.
298;Before Sunset is one of the most unabashedly romantic films I have ever seen.
299;Before Sunset captures some of those moments.
300;Watching them, you wonder .
301;before you realize that you've been swept off your feet, the conversation has become as intimate as the best sexual act could be.
302;except during magical moments such as those dramatized in this film.
303;Its charms and power are almost all verbal, all in the script.
304;Before Sunset swept this viewer off her feet.
305;Days after viewing it, I'm still under its spell.
306;It's appropriate that we understand spells as being cast, primarily, with words, with language.
307;What language does here is truly magic.
308;It was without a doubt the best one of them all, just a terrific movie.
309;it is quite clear from the background information available on the making of Before Sunset that an enormous amount of the screenplay was taken from the real lives of Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy.
310;Celine stays single, having many male friends/lovers, but never marrying .
311;this is also true of Julie Delpy.
312;The fact that they are playing characters so close to who they really are is what makes Before Sunset feel so completely effortless and free flowing, more like a documentary that is evesdropping on a long, sweetly poignant conversation between two real.
313;I loved this movie, but after watching Before Sunset, I loved it even more!!
314;I'm on the edge of my seat waiting to see Before Midnight.
315;This movie received fantastic ratings and I cant figure out why.
316;Along with Before Sunrise, it is an outstanding film and probably the stronger of the two for the genuine honesty that is expressed throughout.
317;You really can believe that two people would actually talk and feel the way these characters do.
318;She appeared the most eager, until Jesse's short speech at the end of the first film, to actually connect again.
319;That would have added some great dialogue to the script and given Jesse at least the knowledge that she had tried, as he had.
320;other than that this is a great film.
321;It's just that when a movie comes across as so realistic and honest, the one major detail on which the whole story hinges could have been made more believable without taking anything away from the rest of the story just as it is.
322;One of my favorite movies.
323;i thoroughly enjoyed it from beginning to end.
324;told all my friends it was a must see movie.
325;I love both this film and the original Before Sunrise.
326;If you like intelligent conversation filled movies, this is fantastic.
327;Captures something essential about that phase of life just as Before Sunrise explored the psyche of the twenty.
328;The conversation between the couple is inviting and invigorating.You just can not wait to see what happens in their furture,yet it brings you to the present moment.your watching a movie with some great thought provoking diaologe
329;Seeing the previous movies will set you up much better for this one.
330;What is so great about all three movies is that they start Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy.
331;I loved all three movies and this final one was the icing on the cake.
332;But we found it captivating .
333;can't imagine the challenge of 2 actors having to deliver that much dialog, and they do it quite well.
334;And the writing makes it so relatable.
335;If you're going to watch this though, you HAVE to start with Before Sunrise so you'll understand and appreciate what's going on.
336;Very interesting that anyone could produce a series of movies like this coming out 8.9 yrs apart continuing the plot .
337;'Before Sunset' is a joy to watch from beginning to end because it shows the art and beauty of conversation.
338;Two lovers meet for the first time in 10 years and recall the best night of their lives
339;This film is a rare gem and is unlike anyone of the modern movies
340;I thoroughly enjoyed the main characters.
341;I highly recommend both movies and, if possible, be sure to see Before Sunrise first!
342;I watched all three (Before Sunrise, Before Sunset and After Midnight and loved them all.
343;They are very talky movies and if you enjoy that, you will love these.
344;I love this movie: the acting is superb
345;I have recommended this to friends.
346;I have some personal experience in this films subject, I experienced it at the young age of 18, traveling from Washington to California.
347;It's amazing how romantic meeting someone on a train can be, laying in their lap, while they watch you sleep.
348;jesse and Celine met 9 years ago on a train in Europe.
349;Obviously, that shapes the way the story will end.
350;In this one, I thought the characters were great.
351;I realize how perfect it was.
352;They came to a more honest place in their early thirties, which made the characters more likeable.
353;It's something to dream and hope for, and if it comes true, it would be wonderful.
354;A brilliant sequel to the quiet 1994 masterpiece, Before Sunrise.
355;Richard Linklatter is a really clever, soulful filmmaker.
356;If you liked (or loved) the first film, this followup is no disappointment.
357;After that, this film is an excellent continuation with all the fantastic acting nuance and phenomenal chemistry that Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy still have.
358;Richard Linklater even used these two actors for an scene in the animated film Waking Life to great effect.
359;Ultimately, this is a very realistic look at intimacy, all the while hoping these two do end up together.
360;Both are worth owning, especially if you believe in love.
361;This drama has a truth to it, in its unfolding of a love affair of the past which becomes the present.
362;this may be the most optimistic movie you will see in your lifetime that is not an animated cartoon.
363;This film takes place in the most beautiful romantic city in the world, Paris, and stars a French person and an American person, both of whom take fairly predictable positions on the state of the world and its chances for survival.
364;allow a broader palette of colors, [and who have already enjoyed BEFORE SUNRISE] this is an exquisite pleasure to be savored and viewed again and again.
365;well, it's a jewel, and harkens back to many of the more enjoyable French films of the Nouvelle Vague and will remind you of what it was like in your youth to have an intelligent conversation to boot!!!!!!
366;The simple reason is that this has to be one of the best movies of this year.
367;the movie depended very much on Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy and their compelling chemistry is unmistakable.
368;From the time they left the book store till the time they ended in Celine's apartment, it's 90 minutes of witty conversation that covered a wide range of topics from books to environmental issues to politics to love and life.
369;julie Delpy puts up a good job as Celine whose love life had never been smooth but still held deep love for her one night companion 9 years ago from which her memory could never erase.
370;Her display of emotions are spectacular, culminating in the scene where she emulates the late Nina Simone's moves while Ethan Hawke was watching her.
371;Her heartfelt rendition of the original song Waltz for a Night must have been the highlight of the entire movie.
372;It's that look that transcends time and space.
373;It doesn't matter how long one might have known someone but it's really the power of the being connected to someone wherever the person is that makes the difference.
374;capturing that moment that will potentially fulfill an unended desire, knowing that without this person, your life will never be whole.
375;That's what love should really be, perhaps.
376;do yourself a favor and watch this movie.
377;If you like listening to endless dribble, this movie is for you!
378;A few funny parts and great scenery, if you like European Cities, but this chick flick on steroids is too slow and dry to have much entertainment value.
379;I *loved* Before Sunrise and was cautiously optimistic that the sequel would be as excellent.
380;Before Sunset is a lovely film, as beautiful as the first and ends on a suitably ambiguous and equally optimistic note.
381;Filmed in real time, and taking place 9 years after the first film, it shows the pair meeting again, this time in Paris, the City of Love.
382;They have one lovely summer afternoon together before he has to fly back to America.
383;The dialogue is witty and always engaging and you never want it to end.
384;The chemistry between the pair is as palpable and electric as it was 9 years ago.
385;That would be a treat indeed.
386;Both actors have aged visibly but they wear the years well and it's nice to see actors who don't try to disguise their age onscreen.
387;It adds immeasurably to the realism of these characters.
388;the film is presented in a modified form to perfectly fit the new 16:9 (1.78:1) widescreen TV.
389;The picture looks fine and I couldn't detect any major composition problems.
390;Colours are fairly strong and natural.
391;Black levels are accurately set with good detail in the darker scenes.
392;Let's keep our fingers crossed.
393;The characters were well defined and the scenery was great.
394;I would recommend it to my friends and maybe even my book club
395;Great in tune writing, love the two companion movies, looking forward to the next edition.
396;Hawke and Delpy are both attractive people.
397;reaching, funny, touching, filled with longing, and very human.
398;One remarkable aspect of the film is the unusually long single.
399;force performance by both actors, who also were heavily involved in the making of the script.
400;mark, leaving us wondering where they are going to take this remarkable encounter.
401;Like so much of life, we are with them in mid.
402;stream, and denoument will have to unfold rather than being formulaic and predictable.
403;I thoroughly enjoyed Before Sunrise and had my doubts that Before Sunset could be as good.
404;The complexities of our changing relationships and the bumps along the way were captured well.
405;Wonderful surprises and connections between all three movies.
406;Before Midnight is tough to watch at times, but having the first two immediately in my mind really facilitated my enjoyment!
407;I like movies with some excitement and fantasy in them.
408;The storyline just didn't seem to have any positive direction and they just kept filling the storyboard with wonderful scenic shots.
409;Nice but can only hold your interest for so long.
410;How rare it is to get the answer to that question in a worthy sequel.
411;Before Sunset is that rare movie.
412;Celene, the girl who got away.
413;But this time the stakes are higher.
414;Now in their thirties, they both suspect the sort of love they felt comes, if you're extremely lucky, once in a lifetime.
415;And if this is true love, as rare as it is to find that in life, how much rarer to be given a second chance.
416;This is a woman with more than a few emotional dings.
417;It's fascinating to note how from movie to movie the two characters' personalities have interchanged.
418;Nine years later, the loss of each other has worked profound alterations in them both.
419;Jesse's felt the lack of love in his life but it hasn't made him bitter, he's come to the conclusion the world just might be a pretty good place, he's much more ready to believe in true love.
420;The cynic has become the romantic and vice.
421;good ol' US of A sentiments, among them calling the US an imperialist country and saying the only reason to be proud of being an American is the sexual staying power of its men.
422;filled rant shows he finds her performance charming had me doubting both characters' sanity.
423;It was going to take an absolutely killer movie from that point on .
424;great acting, dialogue, direction .
425;to win me back over to its side.
426;Shall we make a statement about the possibility of finding true love, or the nobility of self.
427;Watch this alone, for a girls night, or with your loved one and you will not be disappointed.
428;Before Sunset is the most beautiful movie I have ever watched.
429;I love every second of it and wished that it would go on forever.
430;It's really just about two people talking and talking and talking and you can never believe how powerful talking really can be.
431;This movie awakened me to the lyricism of life and made me feel a lot more human after each viewing.
432;Time has probably mellowed me, as I find director Richard Linklater's 2004 sequel an entertaining talkfest that pierces with certain life truths.
433;Celine is now an environmental activist, and their conversation continues for nearly an hour and a half in real time, before Jesse is scheduled to catch a plane home to his wife and son.
434;from cafe to park to boat to an intense car ride to Celine's apartment.
435;But it's Julie Delpy who more dexterously shows the subtle impact of her diminished expectations against her luminous former self, peaking with her visceral emotional breakdown in the car.
436;She also shows herself to be a fine singer as she performs a plaintive waltz for Jesse at the end.
437;indulgent pretension to some of their bantering, though I have come to accept the fact that this is a truthful aspect of their respective characters and the basis of their chemistry together.
438;of featurette that helps provide the context of the story relative to the previous movie.
439;and this wonderful movie leaves me wanting to spend more time with them.
440;I found this to be the perfect sequel to a near perfect movie.
441;the writing, acting and direction are an amazing collaboration.
442;Yet the conversation flows so naturally, as if this wasn't scripted.
443;I hope the editor was correct.
444;If you you liked Before Sunrise, then you'll like befofe Sunset.
445;Wonderful part two of a terrific trilogy .
446;the chemistry between the actors is palpable.
447;i loved every minute of it.
448;Jesse ( the American) has written a book about their encounter, which has become a modest best.
449;As the time unfolds, the magic of their first meeting returns, even though their lives as older adults are now more complicated with responsibilities.
450;Great chemistry in this movie and very believable!
451;Loved it almost as much as the first one!!!
452;Very romantic and beautiful city for background!
453;Set in the beautiful backdrop of Paris, Before Sunset is a gorgeously real story of two people, once lovers for only one night, reunited, again, for only one night.
454;with optimism and wit, Linklater creates characters with whom you can't help but fall madly in love.
455;Amongst comic book schlock and inane comedies, Before Sunset is a step in the right direction for film.
456;if you have ever been in love, are in love, or are just looking for a film that renews a realistic sensibility in cinema, Before Sunset will touch you as movies so rarely do.
457;The entire movie is made with the two characters conversing with each other, and, other than the few extras.
458;A rhapsody of love, once ecstatic with newness, now deeper and more authentic after facing the harsh realities of life.
459;Linklater's Before Sunset is a brilliant film on its own, but best if viewed after watching Before Sunrise, where the story begins.
460;up to Before Sunrise finds Jesse and Celine meeting again, this time in Paris.
461;realistic and a joy to watch.
462;This is the third (please say final ) installment of these movies which were started eighteen years ago.
463;It's truly a stage play on the big screen, with a Greek background.
464;Entertaining up to a point .
465;She sits close by the young American and after a few looks of interest, they engage in conversation, candidly sharing ideas, intimate views on life, and past experiences.
466;For the next 14 hours, Vienna provides a marvelous setting for their relationship and viewers take part on what is a wonderful tour of this historic city.
467;now, Before Sunset brings these two together again, after a 10 year span.
468;they have just a few hours to spend together and this time, the setting is in beautiful Paris.
469;but a certainty that the spark of love ignited 10 years ago has endured the test of time and is now an ardent fire of unrequited love.
470;the conversations are intelligent, up.
471;dated
472;It is wonderful to be part of the lives of two individuals, now for over 10 years, and hopefully with a third installment in the future, for the movie leaves us again not sure of where these two will take their love relationship.
473;jesse [Ethan Hawke] and Celine [Julie Delpy] are simply magnificent.
474;The special features are great for we learned that the actors are allowed to write most of their own lines, their discussions now, as then, are centered around deep subjects we all confront at one point or another, and when Celine plays her guitar for Jesse.
475;Again, the script is so naturally written that viewers eagerly follow their romantic reunion.
476;I love, love, love this movie.
477;ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are both wonderful and really seem to be playing themselves rather than fictional characters and their chemistry together is great.
478;One reason that I loved the film is that I really, honestly cared about the characters and I was very interested in where they had been and where they were going.
479;the fascinating thing about the two films Before Sunrise and Before Sunset is that they are a portrait of an entire relationship.
480;Two chance meetings, one over the course of a day and one over the course of an hour and fifteen minutes.
481;I would love to see a whole series of films starring them.
482;I think this is one of the year's best films and I hope to see it get some Oscar nominations next spring.
483;Superb acting, superb setting, sublime love story.
484;A superior sequel by far.
485;One of the best indepent films ever done.
486;Before Sunset is the third one, all of which I liked very much.
487;The acting is very fine because it is very natural!
488;This is a simple movie that packs a pleasant punch.
489;This movie captures love growing and gaining momentum.
490;I feel certain about what happens in the end.
491;Watch it and I'm sure you'll agree with me.
492;by the way, I loved this installment just as much or more than the first installment.
493;As an Austinite, I can't say that this film sprung up on me, but I nonetheless left the theatre emotionally cleansed and refreshed.
494;This near perfect little film flows easily and among many other things truly shows people, especially Americans, once again why Paris is the most romantic city in the world.
495;the high praise I wish to lavish on this film isn't enough
496;life, etc. etc. this movie is like a wonderful hug from that old friend you haven't seen in years but you often think about.
497;That's how good this movie is.
498;The second effort in the Before Trilogy provides a nice bridge between Before Sunrise and Before Midnight 
499;I made it a goal to watch the Trilogy in their correct order and that made the entire series much more enjoyable .
500;My wife and I also made it a goal to watch the series together which, in my mind, is the best way to immerse oneself into the story and to gain the most out of it.
501;Is it just a coincidence that three best films of the year all deal with ability to connect with other people, with meeting one's true love and losing it, with memories that will not go away, and with possibilities of second chances?
502;Before Sunset is one of the best sequels ever made but it stays on its own.
503;It is so perfect, so simple, so sublime, so clever, so romantic, and so moving that it makes me happy to know that the films like that exist and there is hope that as characters get older we may witness their next meeting and conversations.
504;That's what the power of great dialog does.
505;As much as I loved dialogs in Before Sunrise, in this film they are even better .
506;Ten years is a long period in a human life .
507;It is privilege of the young age to hope that there'll be many people with whom you'll connect with.
508;julie Delpy gives one of the best performances of the year as Celine.
509;She is amazing in showing mystery, charm, disappointments, dreams, and the dark sides of this woman.
510;Her singing and Nina Simone's impersonation in the last scenes of Before Sunset are among the most charming and seductive ever .
511;The storyline is clever as to how they meet again.
512;It genuinely reflects the nuances of a mature and authentic relationship.
513;is what this film makes most visits to the cinema seem like.
514;maybe it's my age, or the history of my own relationships, but I found this film deeply affecting.
515;other reviewers have identified that the central themes in this film are ones we can all relate to, and they are portrayed in such a passionate, real, way, you cannot help but be moved.
516;when I 1st saw this film at the cinema earlier this year, I emailed all my friends, and told everyone I knew, to see it.
517;I'm passionate about good films, but I've never done that before.
518;I think this is a superb piece of filmmaking.
519;It takes you for a walk around Paris.
520;The script is beautifully written.
521;So if you haven't seen this film and you wonder what the smart kids in movie making can do they give yourself a treat.
522;So enjoyable to get away to a foreign country and re.
523;Ten years later and the actors have matured and the acting is fabulous.
524;character conversation that speaks to the durability of ephemeral liaisons: moments of relationships no matter the length can impact lives in amazing ways.
525;It is to the credit of Writers Richard Linklater, Julie Delpy, and Ethan Hawke that the impressions of the film BEFORE SUNRISE made nine years ago made such a lasting impact on these fine artists that they were able to create this 'sequel' in a way that speaks to each of us about events and memorable past moments.
526;Unforced, unfettered by traditional love story telling methods, this film relies wholly upon the interaction of two very fine actors.
527;The cinematography is seamless giving the feeling that the afternoon stroll and conversation was filmed in one sustained shoot.
528;It is as rare a treasure as, say, 'My Dinner with Andre'.
529;A nice, long, conversation between two people who clearly have deep affections for each other and official ties to two other people, lives that have become encumbered in the absence of a real connection between the two erstwhile lovers, and now they've met up again.
530;Something will probably happen in the third film, and if it doesn't wipe out the franchise, I can see watching this concept go on until both actors are old.
531;again, not a film for everybody, but if you like this sort of slow moving river of a movie, you should enjoy this one (and you might want to check out Catherine Deneuve in A Christmas Tale which is a somewhat more energetic and spicy version of the same idea.
532;The story portrayed is simple but mostly credible.
533;Rich in dialogue with sprinkles of landscapes and interesting sites.
534;It makes you want to see the sequel.
535;If you like 'day in the life' movies, it's good.
536;This movie broke my heart in such a sweet and delicate way.
537;It is the perfect resolution for a movie with characters that shaped so much of my romantic sensibilities growing up.
538;Jesse and Celine are made real (flesh and blood) by these two wonderful actors.
539;Because this movie takes place in real time (and even the time between the two movies take place in real time) you genuinely feel as if this is a wonderful story that you are hearing about from a dear old friend.
540;This was a great sequel to the orignial.
541;It just captures everyday life and human relationships perfectly.
542;The soundtrack is great too .
543;Overall, great acting, dialog, scenery, and music.
544;Before Sunset is a lovely piece of film making that feels like an 80.
545;The movie is a rarity in this age of fifty.
546;This sentiment of realism holds particularly true toward the end of the film, when Celine angrily shouts at Jesse that he ruined things for her, that their night together nine years ago was as good as it'll ever be, and now she's forced to unfavorably compare everything to that.
547;But the cafes, shops, cobblestone streets, and River Seine are all present in their authentic glory.
548;i thought the ending, in fitting with the rest of the film, was perfect.
549;Isn't it nice to be able to decide the outcome instead of being force.
550;It will be a long time before I see another movie I enjoyed as much as Before Sunset.
551;ethan hawke and julie delpy are superb, they have such wonderful chemistry together and the dialogues so spontaneous, it almost feels as if they are living in the real world and we are living in a movie.
552;the sheer number of reviews for these films gives an indication of how they reach people.
553;but the extraordinary qualities of this film totally outweigh such criticisms.
554;For example, just wonder at her face in the car when he talks about his dreams.
555;If Before Sunrise is as much a valentine to Vienna as it is a story about a youthful romance that only lasts one night, then its sucessor is a valentine to Paris, and what a wonderful Parisian evening it is to reconnect with an old lover.
556;Jesse, now in his 30s and a successful novelist on the last leg of his first European book tour, has never quite gotten over that fact, nor over the beautiful French girl who captivated him over all those hours all those years ago.
557;she is the heroine, fictionalized, he claims, of his novel.
558;And, of course, there is the small matter of Jesse's wife and son back home.
559;after a coffee, a stroll, a ride on the Seine and a tense conversation in a town car, our boy and girl arrive at Celine's door.
560;Jesse and Celine's rocky romance just may be the last one of its kind put to screen
561;Tell them exactly what is on your mind (and how they can reach you).
562;A love affair in Vienna between teenagers don ` t necessarily mean a forgotten love.
563;The ashes which still can return to fire permeated the soul and memories of both lovers.
564;They will have a very fruitful conversation.
565;And the film deals with it.
566;paris has always been the perfect stage for reencounters and rejoin.
567;Julie Delpi and Ethan Hawke make a perfect couple
568;There are some links with When Harry met Sally and Annie Hall , but the film possesses personality and narrative audacious.
569;Richard Linklater does an amazing job creating a riveting story out of dialogue between just two characters.
570;The dialogue, written by Linklater and co. star Julie Delpy, is rich with insight, depth, compassion, wit and sensitivity.
571;The chemistry between Hawke and Delpy is fascinating enough to keep even the most jittery action movie junkies riveted.
572;I was a HUGE Before Sunrise fan since the movie came out and so I really didn't want to see this because I was worried that it was going to ruin the ambiance of the 'series', but being a true fan I watched and loved it!
573;poetic, straining for profundity, posturing, whiny, self.
574;Sunset is definitely a bit more my speed, as it focused on dialogue and not scenes.
575;It was great to hear Jesse and Celine's chance encounter didn't have the storybook ending the average viewer would have desired.
576;While you might not like the viewpoints of the characters, the movie is not trying to communicate a political message
577;what makes this movie good is the acting, the story, the dialogue, and the scenery.
578;The plot is original as far as I know.
579;I am not a romance genre fan, yet I really enjoyed this movie and its prequel.
580;It is a very fitting sequel to Before Sunrise and it captures an intimate moment in two people's lives.
581;I think the nature of the dialogue and the progression of its intimacy seems natural which makes it believable to me.
582;These are what makes the movie great.
583;Here we find the same qualities that made Before Sunrise a masterpiece: the acting, the chemistry between the stars, the glorious scenery, and the quick but authentic dialogue, much of which feels improvised (but was actually written collectively by Hawke, Delpy, and the director).
584;But what makes it more compelling is the fact that the story takes place in a world many of us are more familiar with, when youthful idealism has faded and the droll of life has begun.
585;This film does an amazing job of injecting honesty and the potential for fulfillment and love back into these almost middle.
586;This is a lovely, gentle movie that reflects love in such a realistic way.
587;I love the very rich dialogue, the dry sense of humor, the beauty of the scenery.
588;I love the movie and recommend it wholeheartedly.
589;The prequel Before Sunrise tells the story of a young man and woman in their early twenties meeting each other on the train, and their spontaneities leads to spending the day and night together, talking in depth about the world, life, love and things that interest a person of their age.
590;This chance encounter also adds to the drama, and is something we all, at some point in our life, have fantasized about: meeting the person of your dream, except, however, this is not the typical cliche that the couple fall in love on the first sight and made love after getting drunk.
591;You feel that they bonded via talking a lot and exchanging thoughts, despite these thoughts can be crazy at times.
592;They met again, in paris, and once again it's a chance encounter.
593;After nine years, they had both experienced the coldness and cruelty of life which are reflected in their conversations.
594;i find these two films very special love stories.
595;And therefore, while projecting your life onto the characters, you slowly become one of them.
596;This is the magic of this flim.
597;Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy acted naturally, which makes it almost feel like a documentary.
598;Sunset is more intense than Sunrise, and there is more dynamics within their conversations, and more emotional ups.
599;Julie Delpy's preformance is much better in the sequel than in the prequel, featuring an intense release of frustration of her love life.
600;From then on, you feel that it's the begining of another journey between these two.
601;And hopefully, it won't take another 9 years or anything near to that!For me, this film is one to watch and keep.
602;It's a wonderful continuing love story told by articulate characters who communicate deeply.
603;Perhaps the best of the trilogy, this engaging film develops the ways in which relationships become more complex, and more challenging, with time.
604;I just saw this movie twice yesterday and I couldnt believe how good it was.
605;ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy contributed to the screenplay so the acting is very natural and spontaneous (Julie Delpy even composed and sung some of the songs in the soundtrack) and its remarkable that they still have great chemistry even Before Sunrise was filmed almost a decade ago.
606;its only an hour and twenty minutes but you cant help but be enriched and inspired.
607;did he get on the plane or what?I highly recommend this movie.
608;Watched the second film as well and Before Midnight twice.
609;Was good to see how they had grown over 9 years.
610;Really looking forward to seeing the third movie when it comes out.
611;See my review for Before Sunrise.
612;Before Sunset is a perfect sequel to before Sunrise.
613;had a tremendous impact on me.
614;i was mesmerized and captivated almost immediately, proving the movie to be a work of art, as it is less than an hour and a half.
615;there are some desperate, frantic moments regarding their possible separation but the movie to me is a masterpiece with its romantic humor and especially for its fabulous, honest, and realistic dialogue.
616;I liked the first movie a lot (before sunrise).
617;Julie should also stick to acting, and singing, in my opinion.
618;She really has a lovely voice and gift for playing the guitar.
619;That was the most pleasant part of the movie (and of course the sights and sounds of France.)
620;sees and genius work by Richard Linklater.
621;It's impressive enough that the entire 3 hours of screenplay between the two is pure dialogue between 2 people.
622;everything is just so real.
623;That last quote really hit home for me.
624;I watched them in order, Sunrise first, and enjoyed them both.
625;the acting was superb and I thought both roles were cast quite well.
626;The dialog is rich and gives strong hints about the things unspoken between the lines.
627;i especially liked the Paris scenes in Sunset because I lived in Paris between 1978 and 1981.
628;There is something quite special about Paris.
629;Loved seeing this second episode in the lives of these interesting characters.
630;Oh, yeah, a love affair.
631;The dialogue in this movie is just amazingly honest, and so perfect!
632;I love the quaint, beautiful walks through Paris too.
633;It's the sequel to Before Sunrise, and it was a sweet follow up on their story.
634;The ending is so perfect, I'm still smiling!
635;This has long been one of my all time favorite movies, since I first saw it in 1995.
636;Now that I've watched it again and seen the other two films in the series, Before Sunset and Before Midnight, I think it is a wonderful, independent film series.
637;I'm very excited for the next sequel!
638;Now I want to see the original.
639;if this is supposed to be romantic, it is something that highlights love as a feeling, a connection to another person, etc. and while that is part of love, it is only a small part.
640;The much greater, much deeper love, is when you commit your life to caring about someone, their wants and desires, above your own.
641;in these movies, both of them are just selfishly pursuing what makes them feel good.
642;This is easy to do in a short movie, but far far from reality.
643;stunned out how great this was.
644;In all honesty even though its so soon after having seen it this could easily be on my top 10 films of all time.
645;I loved this movie so much.
646;The first film was great, but this film is on a completely higher plane.
647;I loved it, even if I didn't completely understand the implications of the conversations between the 23 year old college students.
648;It's about two people meeting, making a connection, and in one night, falling in love.
649;I hated and loved the open ending of the two of them promising to meet each other on December 16 six months later.
650;Although Jesse and Celine are the stars of the movie, I feel that Paris was a silent cast member as well, quietly there in the background so you got a hint of her beauty.
651;It's a heartbreakingly beautiful movie.
652;If you do love Before Sunrise and haven't seen Sunset yet, I recommend re.
653;READ AT YOUR OWN RISK:***Ok, so for those of you who have watched the movie, I loved the ending.
654;Insightful, real, romantic, thought provoking, I could go on forever with adjectives.
655;A must see movie with its companion film Before Sunrise.
656;Before Sunset may quite possibly be one of the greatest films of the last 10 years.
657;I think that to truly enjoy Before Sunset, one must have experienced a similar moment in their lives such as these two characters.
658;I believe that Before Sunset is the kind of film that gives the viewer a moment in their personal history back to them.
659;In a sense, the film has the ability to stir up a longing for such a moment in ones life, while at the same time satisfying the reunion of these two fictional characters.
660;Tempo and flow acts as an asset to the subtleties that make this film truly enjoyable.
661;Before Sunset has the ability to captivate and engage the viewer and satisfies 9 years of waiting.
662;Gives one a realistic view of how relationships change, how complex feelings are and how each one of us struggles to live an ideal life, falling far short.
663;It's talking throughout the whole film, and very philosophical too.
664;Fascinating dialogue from two very gifted actors.
665;This movie and the prequel, Before Sunrise, must truly be enjoyed together.
666;When I saw the first movie as a high.
667;schooler nine years ago, I was amazed at the concept of a truly profound connection developed in a short time with a stranger.
668;I see so much of myself in their conversations and appreciate the gravity of re.
669;As time moves forward, the best part of being in relationships, whether romantic, familial or friendships, is to see people grow.
670;Seeing these two characters and their growth over the 9 years is like seeing myself and my friends grow as well.
671;this movie and its prequel appeal to me because I feel like like I personally relate to the characters.
672;I recommend watching the first and second movies together (if you haven't seen the first) and reflecting on your own views and choices nine years ago versus the present.
673;Before Sunrise was my favorite in the series but this is a good one also.
674;It helped that Amazon Instant Video offers it for free.
675;And so I watched the two in order.
676;That sped up the whole process to my liking.
677;I thought the acting was superb as was the writing .
678;An absolutly must see trilogy this being the final instalment.
679;From the first to the last, the conversations acting and filming is outstanding.
680;Maybe one of the best movies I ever saw.
681;I noted the film critics gave this film very good reviews but learned that it is one of a trilogy that I believe must be watched from the beginning (Before Sunrise) to enjoy, understand and appreciate the full effects of the character's development over a span of years.
682;Before Sunset is a beautiful, well.
683;crafted sequel to Before Sunrise, that holds well on its own even if you didn't see the original film chronicling the romantic adventure undertaken by Jesse and Celine.
684;Much to his amazement he sees Celine, and realizes that he still has a deep romantic feeling for the beautiful French girl that he had won, and then lost.
685;With only a little more than an hour to spare before Jesse heads to the airport for his flight bound for home, he joins Celine in remembering their adventure and warm, intense feelings which each still has for the other.
686;has wrought yet another cinematic gem that is a romantic version of My Dinner With Andre, showing in real.
687;This builds up into a surprising, unexpected climax which is truly a perfect, elegant ending for this sweet cinematic ode to love.
688;The film is accompanied by several stirring love songs in French and English composed and sung by Julie Delpy herself.
689;Without question, this is the most romantic film of the year I have seen so far, and coupled with its fine script, beautiful cinematography and excellent acting, it ranks first on my Top Ten list of best films of 2004.
690;The script makes you relate to the characters as does the fine acting.
691;When you finish the movie you have something to think about that resembles the world we live in.
692;Sexy, Funny, Classy, and lightly intellectual.
693;these actors are absolute perfection for this script.
694;and I have to say, this is one of the best movies I've ever seen.
695;i'll put this up on my favorite movies for life mantel and guard it like a warrior guards its loved ones.
696;It was every bit as good as I had hoped.
697;Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are reunited after nine years apart and through wonderful dialogue.
698;on a walk, in a cafe, on a boat ride, a private car and a visit to her apartment, the two connect again.
699;The difference with Before Sunset is that a more mature character development takes place.
700;Both actors are in fine form and the depth of their love with each other just barely crosses the surface.
701;Hawke and Delpy were actors in the prime of their adulthood both in looks, charisma, intelligence and most of all soul during the production and release of this film half a decade ago.
702;Their acting is so realistic that I yearned for them to get married.
703;Real life and fiction collide here, cos you know both have their own separate lives, and will move on to other projects, possibly lives.
704;there's so much philosophy, comedy and looser Zeitgeist commentary/language (urban.
705;the sincere boyish unabashed look on 'hero' Ethan Hawke's (who did manage to write a bestseller to enable their reunion .
706;about one German soldier not destroying beautiful monuments/buildings of Paris in WWII (with an unpressed explosive trigger) made history sound so poetic and graceful.
707;Before Sunset, having the same director and actors, is an 80 minute movie in real time capturing the second meeting of this magical soul mate.
708;destined couple played beautifully by Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke.
709;I was hoping for a bit more frequent subtle action and silence, as we see as they climb the walk.
710;other than that, I have nothing but praise for this wonderful film that engages sensitive viewers.
711;The subject matter and acting felt so real to me, as if we weren't watching a movie at all, but, in fact, Ethan and Julie as real people in Paris.
712;There are a lot of films which have more aspects to them.
713;plus, I see a parallel between a couple building such a bond in a short time, but are questioning whether it will last, and my reaction to the films right after seeing them.
714;My appreciation of the films just seems to grow.
715;I believe if there's any kind of God it wouldn't be in any of us, not you or me but just this little space in between, well maybe some of you already have heard that (is a quote in Before Sunrise), well I think that is that quote is true, this movie is the closest I ever saw to get, to describe, that space that exist between two people.
716;Amazing directing and dialogue and my kind of characters.
717;A must see if you want to see the others in the trilogy.
718;time favorite shows!For those of you who can't stand ambiguity(though not as bad as BEFORE SUNRISE), STAY AWAY.
719;droppingly breathtaking, is nonetheless very pretty.
720;The dialogue is beautifully scripted, and I suppose it helps that Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy have amazing chemistry.
721;It's a beautiful movie, and a must watch!
722;Nonetheless, it is worth seeing.
723;I truly looked forward to this second installment from the moment I heard about it.
724;I found myself being put.
725;This movie is very much in the same spirit as the other one: these two characters talk and talk and talk.
726;This film also ends on an enigmatic but upbeat note.
727;If you enjoyed the first one, you will enjoy the second.
728;This film hit me right in the heart.
729;My lost love (K.) and I had reconnected by then, and she pointed me to Sunrise as a remarkably close representation of our own relationship.
730;Granted, K. and I lasted longer as a couple than Jesse and Celine, but we traveled together in Paris, at about the same ages as the two onscreen lovers, and everywhere we looked, there was another reminder, another example, another coincidence, that made each of us, separately, feel that we were watching ourselves on the screen.
731;Their introspective, heartfelt, sometimes playful, sometimes poignant dialogue perfectly matched our own .
732;a dialogue that fortunately continues to this day.
733;married and have a wonderful child and a successful career, while K. has a great career and life of her own, not unlike the situation with Jesse and Celine.
734;Yet, the connection between us remains as vibrant and tangible as ever, just as it does for the Before Sunset characters.
735;the chemistry between Jesse and Celine in Before Sunset remains palpable and intense, as it does for K. and me.
736;A remarkable captivating, excellent scripted and sensitively acted film.
737;But they are captivate by each other in an unexpected meeting.
738;for such a simple and central plot it is remarkable that the film has subtle sub.
739;Pay careful attention to the opening.
740;It sets the scene and raises questions, not only about the plot but also about the structure used to tell the story.
741;Listen to the music and appreciate its significance as part of the story.
742;A very skillful and intelligent film.
743;the film is all the more delightful by the obvious personal collaboration between three people who together wrote, acted and directed the film.
744;For that reason the film comes across as real life with real but not excessive emotions portrayed by endearing and enduring characters.
745;before Sunset shows when and how to make a sequel.
746;It builds on the original.
747;It is a film to watch again and again for what it helps us to understand about our lives may never have the opportunity to put into words let alone live out.
748;pleasant experiences you watch and feel mildly moved by, especially the what are they gonna do ending.
749;The acting is good, the scenery is nice, the movie itself is relaxing and ethereal at times.
750;It makes you think back to that one true love of your youth .
751;I like the opening song, but loved the closing song.
752;Watched all three of these and loved them.
753;Loved where they were filmed, loved the acting and loved the topic.
754;I was captivated with every moment of this film.
755;I loved it so much that when I saw it for the first time in the theatre, I went back to see it again a few nights later.
756;The acceleration of both their lives was perfect, believable and exactly how I would have imagined them, that many years later.
757;It is such a feelgood film for me.
758;a beacon of hope, a quiet love poem, a spark of light in a dark world.
759;it is so real it almost makes one feel voyeuristic watching it.
760;There will never be an ending to a movie that will compare to this one.
761;thank you for this beautiful film.
762;Linklater has created a true masterpiece with this trilogy.
763;Finally saw Before Sunset which is as wonderful as the other two.
764;She was excited to get this one!
765;I came late to this movies series and absolutely love it.
766;I love the building relationship between Jesse and Celeste along with the incredible European scenery in the background.
767;a really nice, interesting show.
768;The first time I saw Before Sunset I didn't like it b/c of the ending but I must have fealt or noticed something b/c about 6 months later I watched it again and loved it.
769;They're older and more mature compared to impulsive and dreamy in Before Sunrise
770;I love all of (3) of these films by Julie Deply!
771;Highly recommend watching them in order, and within a short time period.
772;Before SunriseThese 2 movies are absolutely great.
773;I really hope a 3rd movie will follow.
774;Almost impossible to outshine these 2 outstanding movies.
775;I first watched Before Sunset without having seen Before Sunrise and it took my breath away.
776;An emotional distillation of verbal expression concentrates on what is important, yet they repress any emotional outburst, as they lean on their social and personal values.
777;delpy and Hawke perform in a brilliant manner, as they depict a delicate balancing act between what they desire and fear of loosing .
778;The director Richard Linklater depicts the meeting with intense verbal outlet and touching delicacy where the honesty of words are covered in a jumble of emotion that confuses and bewilders both.
779;This is where the true brilliance of the film rests, as Linklater captures the essence of the reunion.
780;These moments depict the subconscious ability to surprise where repressed honest feelings infiltrate the anxious consciousness.
781;This constant movement provides a visual unrest that enhances the lovelorn anxiety within the story, which also transfers genuine empathy for the characters.
782;Yet, they hold onto the moment while learning more about each other's pain and suffering.
783;The friendly atmosphere between Celine and Jesse combined with the easy flow of the camera from location to location without any sudden movement helps to induce this tranquility.
784;It merely continues, as the clock keep ticking pressuring them about the expiring time.
785;before Sunset is a wonderful film about moments and opportunities in the light of signs and symbols that offer a chance to see the truth.
786;An inner voice whispers, carpe diem, while logic tells one to ponder the long term effects.
787;All of this is shrewdly tailored in a cinematic experience that takes brilliant consideration to script, cinematography, performances, and mise.
788;scene, which in the end presents truly great cinematic experience.
789;But this is such a beautiful and touching movie, I had to tell others how wonderful it was.
790;Both films are cinematic masterpiecesI believe.
791;The reason is that both films are so real that you feel like you are eavedropping on this cute couple,who could be anyone.
792;who would think a movie where people are mostly just talking could be so riveting, but believe me it is.
793;It really makes you think about how life is so short and true love is so special,& shouldn't be taken for granted.
794;the chemistry between Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy is electric, so I believe that is one reason the movie is sogood and the acting is flawless.
795;I loved the ending of this movie, but please make a sequel, don't leave us hanging.
796;The writing and acting inthis movie are so brilliant that you can make a sequel interesting, PLEASE!!!
797;I have seen many, many romantic movies, foreign and domestic, and this oneand Before Sunrise are easily two of my favorites.
798;I enjoyed this laid back, walk through Paris, movie.
799;That should be a must for all viewers.
800;and must admit I was quite surprised!
801;There are so many gems, so much depth and so much truth to their conversation.
802;Very rich and moving in a beautiful way.
803;and the acting is superb.
804;So glad I stumbled across this one.
805;It is about how Celine and Jesse have matured and become more realistic about the world, including love.
806;Jesse is even more interesting and inspiring this time.
807;This movie didn't seem like it was high budget but it added to the connection with the characters.
808;It was a movie of great emotion, romantic excitement, and just going through life and how everyday choices shape our lives.
809;I have recommended this series of movies to many people!
810;Although I loved the movie, and I see it as a realistic sequel to Before Sunrise, I don't see it as an optimistic ending as everyone else seems to.
811;Finally, in the end, I see it as unralistic that Jessie will simply stay in Paris with Celine, and give up his son, who he says is the most important thing to him.
812;The physical appearance of the 2 actors, and the difference in the conversation will strike you.
813;This movie really hits home with me.
814;I love talky movies, and this is about as talky as it gets.
815;I saw the first movie and loved it.
816;It is full of romance, and tragedy.
817;It is fascinating and thought provoking, and leaves you wanting more, mostly because like the first movie it leaves you wondering what is going to happen to them.
818;I love all three of these movies.
819;They're just real, natural and timeless.
820;There's a lot of talking in this movie, FYI.
821;Overall, I thought it was cute.
822;This is, without doubt the best romantic movie I have ever seen.
823;I do recommend watching Before Sunrise first, not because you really need it, but because if you do and you like it, you will enjoy Before Sunset even more.
824;i'm sure everyone pretty much knows what this film is about.
825;This is a film for those who like to listen.
826;And they do talk about pretty interesting things.
827;After hearing such great reviews, I finally watched it.
828;I am so happy that I did.
829;This movie was as touching as the first, as wonderfully acted and as naturally fulfilling.
830;It puts life and love in a refreshing perspective.
831;Yet, it's so simple and so beautifully played out.
832;Also, it was refreshing to see that the characters had developed and matured since the last movie
833;I thought the ending was perfect and its ambiguity was the best route Linklater could've taken.
834;There was a feeling of are they or aren't they throughout the movie (in regards to rekindling their love, ending up together, etc.) and I felt that the ending fit just right for that scenario.
835;if you enjoyed Before Sunrise, you will love this movie.
836;It's touching, smart, funny and thought.
837;But Jesse has written a best.
838;Of course, they have to talk, and while they have a lot to say to each other the catch is that he has a flight back to America that night.
839;Memories is a good thing if you don't have to deal with the past, she says at a particularly insightful moment, but Jesse and Celine have to deal with both.
840;But because Before Sunrise was such an intimate film, Before Sunset is not burdened by the overwhelming expectations faced by Alexandra Ripley when she wrote Scarlett, the sequel to Gone With the Wind, that had to find a convincing way of getting Rhett and Scarlett back together on another day.
841;Fortunately, Jesse and Celine are life size, which is why their story has captivated so many of those who managed to actually see Before Sunrise.
842;charged dialogue exchanged at the backseat of the cab).
843;I loved the natural way that Paris was the setting here and it was great to see how the actors have aged a little over the intervening 9 years.
844;Clearly Julie Delpy's character is deeper, more introspective.
845;She challenge's Ethan Hawke's character several times, and all he can do is stammer and leer.
846;Mostly Julie Delpy's character blathering on and on and on and on about life and wicked imperialistic nations like.
847;the film makes it look like Paris is a haven, a cosmopositan but quaint world.
848;I really loved Before Sunrise, the first in this trilogy.
849;I could relate with Celine and Jessie's immediate connection, possibly because I had a similar experience a long time ago.
850;There was spontaneity, chemistry, friendship and honesty, all in the lovely setting of Vienna.
851;oK, we all know that Jessie will run into Celine and they will walk around another beautiful city, Paris this time, talking and talking, yada yada.
852;the idea of making three movies over eighteen years is, in principle, great.
853;The actors are genuinely older, not pretending to be.
854;Towards the end, it felt more fitting just to say : Great seeing you, have a wonderful life .
855;Watching this movie helped to understand next move in this sequel .
856;I read some of the 4 and 5 star reviews, but the one star reviews were the most accurate.
857;They are pretty spot on for this film.
858;Turned it off and chalked it up to chance, and moved it to the bottom shelf.
859;but it does make me look forward to the final installment: Before Midnight.
860;Life has gotten more complicated for our couple, but their story continues.
861;The movie is as well.
862;crafted as the first and worth watching.
863;And do stick with the story for the last film, Before Midnight.
864;With a refreshing honesty I have yet to see an ANY movie, the characters make you believe that you are being allowed to follow them for a few hours, glimpsing more into their souls than just their conversations.
865;I love the whole concept of seeing their relationship in 'real time', (over the span of 18 years.
866;It's fascinating and made even more so when you know that much of the dialogue was adlibbed by Hawke and Delpy.
867;Richard Linklater's films contain some of the best dialogue I've ever heard on screen (e. g. Dazed and Confused, Waking Life), and this is one of his best.
868;Unlike most sequels, this one is actually as good as the original, Before Sunrise, which is an accomplishment in itself.
869;Both of these films capture an intense connection between two people that is romantic, intellectual and life.
870;After spending one very intense day together, they part and promise to meet later in Vienna.
871;Jesse has written a book based on their encounter, and Celine shows up at his book signing in Paris.
872;They walk around the city and discuss everything from politics to religion to their love lives.
873;in most romantic movies, the dialogue consists of clever or funny words that the characters use to seduce each other and the audience.
874;More importantly, the actors do a superb job in building emotional tension as the conversation slips gradually from general topics into the characters' intense feelings for each another, which they are at first reluctant to reveal.
875;Before Sunset has a focus that is very specific regarding two people but also very insightful about universal concerns.
876;Both Hawke and Delpy give extremely natural performances
877;I especially liked the ending, which is both perfect and avoids being a cliche, no small feat in a romance.
878;Love this ongoing story with great dialogue about an American (Ethan Hawke) and a Parisian (Julie Delpy).
879;Great movie for those following the trilogy.
880;A lovely complementary followup to the first film.
881;Great performances, same gentle focus on the intellectual, the intimate, and the fatefulness of two lives.
882;This film is that extremely rare thing .
883;a sequel even better than the original.
884;And finally a sexy, romantic movie for someone with a mind.
885;It is hard to believe that such films are made and it makes me very happy to see it succeeding out there.
886;I loved every minute of this movie.
887;This movie contains one of the most gut.
888;wrenching and achingly romantic exhanges that I have ever seen.
889;The movie is absolutely beautiful and the ending is frustrating and annoyingly perfect.
890;wrapped hollywood ending, but a question of faith.
891;Julie Delpy's Celine has matured into an even more amazingly beautiful woman.
892;The kind of woman many of us hope to be.
893;those of you who haven't seen the first film will still be able to enjoy this film.
894;This movie was truly made for the fans of the first film.
895;Acting and scripting were very good, especially acting by Julie Delpy.
896;Realistic in its treatment of topic.
897;l liked it better than Before Sunrise.
898;But Before Sunrise was very good.
899;next time I want to see Paris, I'll simply fly there.
900;How do you top the most amazing, wonderful, romantic, spontaneous night of your life?
901;This is the first movie that I felt grew with me.
902;And I have to say, I loved it even more than the original.
903;a truly seminal movie in my teens, you finally really get to see who he's become as an adult.
904;It was very sweet to watch this couple just pick up where they left off 9 years ago.
905;this movie is close to perfection in many ways.
906;The dialogs are fascinating: far from conventional, very deep and still romantic in many ways.
907;time (having been shot in a little over two weeks, after another two weeks of rehearsal), which makes some scenes admirable from all points of view: some approach the demands of theatrical work.
908;The music, a bit more inconspicuous than in the first one, is still fantastic.
909;overall, this one, with its 1995 counterpart, are bound to become all.
910;It's great to watch them rekindle their friendship, get to know each other, and realize they're completely infatuated with each other.
911;It's shot in a similar style to the first film, two people walking and talking.
912;Continuation of the first film with captivating cinematography.
913;You still feel the connection between the 2 characters as they wander Paris and explore the possibilities if they had met after 6 months.
914;like somehow it's more romantic to experience a few hours of happiness with a complete stranger every 15.20 years while you marry and spend your life with someone you don't really love.
915;This is the best movie of the year.
916;I really liked this movie.
917;I is ma good love story, and a good story about life.
918;This is a very minor movie, but it benefits from its Parisian setting and will resonate with anyone who has met up after a long time with someone who was important to them and finds the conversation flowing as if their relationship had continued during that time.
919;No matter how brave or fascinating the conversation may be, and like I said it was sharp and refreshing most of the time, somewhere, sometime they have to shut up and kiss each other, or something!The premise was fantastic.
920;Assuming the viewer saw and enjoyed ?
921;Slowly and mysteriously they finally begin to warm up to each other, but not in a mystical magical romantic sort of way.
922;tongued and intellectual they had become?Happily, there were a lot of insightful, reflective and even funny moments during this film.
923;And usually for me that's a good thing.
924;I really enjoyed the movie because they actually had a real conversation which was enlightening.
925;This is probably one of the best love stories I've ever watched, the chemistry between the two actors are amazing and the fact that it is a trilogy makes it even better
926;Nice performances by lead actors.
927;Great setting and story line.
928;For those who enjoy a good story and conversation I recommend Before Sunset.
929;It had a believable story line, great dialogue, and the actors did a great job, I felt I could totally relate to the characters played by both main characters as well as the supporting actors.
930;before Sunset picks up nine years after the end of Before Sunrise, its pleasant, conversation.
931;and yet demonstrate the same kind of youthful romantic attraction evident in the first movie.
932;It's intimate, romantic, and perhaps friendlier and more familiar than you'd expect.
933;Better than the first film, Before Sunrise but the actors are more mature now.
934;The ability to portray regret, hope and doubt was outstanding by both
935;Except for the fact the script writer found it relevant to incorporate liberal philosophy and agenda into an otherwise decent movie.
936;In the future i should hope the script writer and director appreciate the fact that good movies don't need to feel like a commercial, albeit 80 minutes at that.
937;'Before Sunset' is one very notable exception.
938;The interaction between them is filled with deep philosophical reflections on love, death, life, unhappiness and just about everything important in between.
939;This little art imitating life and then reimitating art is a clever touch.
940;the acting by both Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy is intelligent, intense and most of all incredibly real!
941;The ending is wisely kept open to the viewer's own interpretation of events.
942;While seeing 'Before Sunrise' is not necessary to enjoy this movie, I would still recommend doing so first.
943;this movie is food for the heart and soul.
944;The romantics have fought the realists for God.
945;Does love triumph above all things or do we, in the immortal words of Ms. Krabappel, marry out of fear of dying alone?
946;up to Before Sunrise) has arrived, and it's enough to make both camps shut up for a while.
947;Here is a movie so intensely romantic yet so heartbreakingly pragmatic, I went from smiling to sadness and back without missing a beat.

954;the ongoing conversation is still as insightful and funny as Before Sunrise, and they still bring up intriguing notions about the real, philosophical, and sexual worlds.
955;I especially loved an early moment when a secret about their proposed 6.
956;then again, so is the whole movie, right up to it's brilliantly ambiguous finale that had me clapping for the first time in a long time (Do me a favor and bring back the clap when a movie deserves it).
957;The great films make us want to follow the characters off the screen and into their lives
958;It sounded like a really romantic film, one that I might identify with, as I've always wondered what would happen if I met my first love again, if I would have the same feelings.
959;He felt it added to the reality of the film, and often relied on the actors to get perfect takes at the right time, and it shows, as it was shot in a mere 15 days.
960;There is basically 2 reasons why this movie is the perfect sequel.
961;Before Sunrise was not a success, it was an outstanding indie film that captured a rare moment between two persons.
962;The maturity and the desillusionment of both gives a depth to those discussions that were held 9 years before.
963;The first movie add to the second, but the second also add to the first.
964;They talk about pertinent subjects.
965;What can I say these two are adorable!
966;This is a love story about two people meant for each other, an honest to goodness written in the stars kind of love, but who are thwarted by modern life.
967;It's a simple, sad story told with a refreshingly unique and seamless style.
968;It moves so fluidly and naturally it's literally like reconnecting with old friends and spending a few hours with them.
969;the acting is completely natural, often disarmingly and remarkably so, there is nothing to suggest that they are acting as they are so lifelike and realistic.
970;The presence of a fate and destiny thwarted haunts us and them.
971;Julie Delpy is delightful, but I think it is Ethan Hawke who is really transcendent in this.
972;I loved his performance immensely.
973;It's just beautifully done all around and is often a heck of a lot of fun to watch.
974;i'd highly recommend it (and I hope it gets a Best Original Screenplay nomination).
975;Worst romance movie I've ever seen in my life.
976;I watched # 2 and # 3 last night and would love more.

978;love, have run into each other again in Paris.
979;Jesse (Ethan Hawke) is now a published novelist, his book being a fictional account of that amazing night a decade before.
980;but the dialogue is extremely human and therefore very affecting.
981;Is Jesse happy with his life?
982;A lovely and romantic film.
983;I thought the first movie, Before Sunrise, was terrific.
984;This is a good sequel to it.
985;The characters are just as engaging, and I still want to see what happens on their new continuing adventure.
986;Reminds me of my own youthful romantic overseas encounters.
987;The wonderful backdrop of Vienna set the mood perfectly.
988;The dialog was quirky and realistic.
989;Julie Delphy is wonderful, as is Ethan Hawk.

991;interrupted conversation about love and life, filling each other in about what they've been doing since they saw each other last.
992;Linklater, Hawke and Delpy keep the movie flowing gracefully, and Lee Daniel's glowing photography of Paris provides the perfect touch for a movie that appeals to the romantic in us all.
993;The second in the series was as engaging as the first and the two actors must have had an incredible personal connection in order to project their on screen chemistry
994;A little short, but I loved the first movie and this is a great addition.
995;love the diaolgue,and this time we get Paris as a backdrop.
996;I have always loved Before Sunrise and watched it many times.
997;Thank you Julie and Ethan, you are OUTSTANDING actors and the movie is truly beautiful.
998;I'm a big fan of both Before Sunrise and Sunset.
999;It was a nice poem and i want to know if she kept that paper or not?
1000;This has to be the most universal romance of all time.
1001;Unless you married your childhood sweetheart, some line will hit you on a deep level.
1002;An excellent movie, even more compelling than Before Sunrise.
1003;I got caught up in the relationship, and I think it demonstrated what true love might look like.
1004;Enduring romance and beautiful location shots.
1005;The chemistry between Hawke and Delpey is enchanting and touching.

1010;This allows the dialog to ebb and flow, to continue easily for the 80 minute duration of this real.
1011;BEFORE SUNSET is 80 minutes of two very intelligent, articulate people reacquainting themselves with each other, reawakening to youthful aspirations and romantic hopes that they assumed were withering.
1012;It's a paean to French ideals and American excesses, to Paris and to music and to architecture and literature, all conveyed in the expressions and words of two hopeless romantics and in the passion their director has for the noble idea, so rarely practiced, of the importance and power of each day, each hour, each minute of life.
1013;along with it's predecessor, one of the very greatest films about falling in love .
1014;This is simply the best movie you are ever likely to see if you have ever decided to take one path and not another in life.
1015;the fact that a movie that consists of two people talking for a few hours can bring tears to your eyes (it did to mine) and can make you think about your life is amazing.
1016;Couple that with excellent acting and with a Julie Delpy that you cannot help to fall in love with, and you have a movie that should have won 100 Oscars.
1017;could quite possibly be, the best ending to a movie i have ever seen.
1018;Very good really enjoyed them.
1019;I loved this movie for its honesty and intimacy.
1020;This is an enchanting story of two people separated by time and a continent, who essentially don't give up hope.
1021;A must for those enchanted and faithful to a dream.
1022;But if you listen carefully their conversation and focus on their acting, you will see that very interesting chemistries are flowing between two actors.
1023;The scripts are never boring and the performances of the actors were really great !
1024;The rest of the time on the clock of course represents the times romance films have been maybe close but not spot on .
1025;there have been a few other worthy romantic films in the recent past.
1026;After a singular night of intellectual and passionate connections, Before Sunrise ends with the two main characters .
1027;you should just see the film to answer those questions.
1028;In doing so, the film thoughtfully explores where these characters were situationally and emotionally, where they now are, and where they may be headed.
1029;the bottom line is that Before Sunset is a master work.
1030;There are other romantic films that have good things to offer, but none come to mind that approach the same level of psychological intimacy that these characters (and the audience) share, nor the same gratifying mix of character relatability, heartfelt longing, hope for the future, or romantic chemistry that this film has in spades.
1031;I loved the characters of Jesse and Celine .
1032;powerful, up close and personal stuff.
1033;fi films, thrillers, and actioners tend to be my go.
1034;Having viewed each of these films several times, I really look forward to the day when we revisit these characters once again in a definitive third film.
1035;The couple enjoy a wonderful evening, and they make plans to meet each other again.
1036;She had a very natural style of delivery in this film.
1037;It was a short movie, which I also thought was a good choice.
1038;I loved this movie so much.
1039;A movie that throws you through the full spectrum of emotions.
1040;I saw it before the first one, and I must say I love it much more after seeing Before Sunrise.
1041;I'm so happy I finally own it.
1042;Clean wholesome movie and a pleasure to watch.
1043;We would recommend it to anyoneinterested in having a nice quiet evening at home watching a movie.
1044;I loved it better than the other two in the Before trilogy.
1045;A good follow up to Before Sunrise.
1046;Keeps ones attention throughout and leaves you with wanting more.
1047;I wanted to see the new movie, and read a review that it was important to watch the two previous movies.
1048;To see them together within the same weekend, was SO enjoyable.
1049;It's a great love affair.
1050;Each of them is important to see how the story unfolds.
1051;but these second one is essential before seeing the new movie.
1052;They could've done so much more with it.
1053;it started out awkward but got better into the middle and in the end.
1054;The Bottom Line:Before Sunset does what sequels should do but often don't: it stays true to the nature of the original while also taking the story to a new place
1055;See these three movies in order with someone you love.
1056;The characters and actors are gripping.
1057;fascinating to watch and listen to.
1058;It's the most romantic escape ever .
1059;Wonderful Love story about the longevity of true love no matter what the obstacles may be!
1060;A young writer publishes a book about his amazing evening with the love of his life.
1061;Great movie, great dialogues, great acting.
1062;Love story, romantic, but no clich s. Love the trilogy.
1063;Before Sunset is a great movie for those who are always refering back to old lovers or special connections from their past.
1064;The interaction between the two main characters in Paris is moving and very realistic.
1065;I sugguest watching it with a close friend so you can have dialog over wine after the movie because it does bring out some universal themes of love, relationships and how over a period of passing years people can still have a basic and very moving connection with one another.
1066;In ancitipation of going to see Before Midnight in the next day or so, I wanted to watch Before Sunset again.
1067;several comments: this movie has held up very well.
1068;I liked it better than Before Sunrise when I first saw it, and I still feel that way today.
1069;But aside that, the script is pretty much perfect.
1070;The movie shines in the last 20 min.
1071;One of the best scenes in the movie is when Celine finally gives in to Jessie's request to sing a song.
1072;She picks up her guitar and brings Let Me Sing You a Walz.
1073;This movie holds up to the test of time, like the first it is an good paced movie that isn't to long and has a lot of good scenes and dialog.
1074;crossed romance is the subject of this brave little film, and although it should be commended for its honest attempt to recreate a slice of life.
1075;interestingly documented in the 1995 film Before Sunrise.
1076;This film takes place nine years after and the fellow, played by Ethan Hawke, has written a best.
1077;selling tour in lovely Paris, his old flame.
1078;shows up, and the two reacquaint themselves with one another.
1079;Undoubtedly, this worked well in the first film, but again, the first film took place literally and fictionally nine years earlier.
1080;Remember, he is an author, a best.
1081;in contrast, Julie Delpy is superb.
1082;Not beautiful, not unattractive, she comes across as vulnerable, and real.
1083;Her persona is that of an idealist.
1084;Though occasionally emotional, the last scene of the film shows us that she will get through this, and is in fact well on her way to achieving a sense of serenity.
1085;It is a fine, nuanced performance
1086;Its been billed as the favorite and most unlikely trilogy of our time.
1087;Amazing chemistry between these two and obviously the director, as well.
1088;Interesting story with a nice job done by the actors.
1089;It flows nicely and and brings you beyond the every day of life into all its possibilities.
1090;This is the second of three movies (the third now in theaters, June 2013) by the very original director Linklater and all three are a total treat.
1091;It is all talk, but of a calibre of conversation and banter seldom caught in any but the best of novels.
1092;Both of them were obviously in the zone and they got the scene nailed.
1093;In accordance with the Director, with consensus from both actor and actress, this Before.
1094;franchise shall become a work.
1095;progress, a journal about love, of love that transcends time and place.
1096;An honest and bittersweet love story that is beautifully crafted.
1097;And with that, it gives us hope and with hope, we can look forward towards a brighter future.
1098;I have not seen the third Before Midnight yet but loved the first 2.
1099;It's hard to explain what makes this movie so great.
1100;Would watch again in a heart beat.
1101;What counts is actually the amount of love you have inside your heart.
1102;this film deeply ilustrates the power of love in a special angle.
1103;The angle of basing the power of love on one fine memory.
1104;And the effect the memory and assumptions may have on our physical life.
1105;While I loved the movie and Julie Delpy is truly a vision
1106;But far more significant is that the burden of experience now replaces joy of innocence.
1107;This sequel was really welcome and it was just magnificent!
1108;it was worth waiting for it.
1109;the dialogues are profound, especially in Before Sunset, and they are what gives the sense of regaining connection after nine years with Celine and Jesse and how life has turned out wrong for the both of them.
1110;the notion of a romantic love on that December 16.
1111;But it is so poignant watching these two people grasping the moment (and the chance) to fulfill their most cherished dreams.
1112;Most of the time they do not even touch each other, but you can see the connection between them in subtle gestures, looks exchanged, and the conversation.
1113;and the most beautiful scene, in my opinion, is when Jesse is talking about the dreams he has and how he wakes up sobbing and Celine tries to touch him.
1114;this movie is worth seeing but to really appreciate it, you must forget about the fast paced action that are good only for the eyes.
1115;Examples from this year extend to Bridget Jones' Diary: The Edge of Reason, Shrek 2, and other such excuses for entertainment, but this mandate has managed to surpass a precious few: Toy Story 2 and Before Sunset.
1116;the thought of a sequel to such a benignly lovely story may have instilled fear in the hearts of cult fans of Before Sunrise, but the sequel was not only a breath of fresh air for those of us holding our figurative breaths, but an equally well done masterpiece as its' forefather that explored in depth all of the potential mistakes the movie could have made before casting them away in favor of a lovely, realistic conclusion(?)
1117;You could have guessed it anyways by one glance at the cover) but nothing is hokey or surreal about Before Sunset, and it is just as beautiful and well done a film as Before Sunrise.
1118;I know that women may value this movie, which is natural, but I found an extraordinary number of guys falling for this romance.
1119;Jesse finally comes to the realization that he must by fate drop everything he had planned and start then and there with Celine, and for more than just one night.
1120;their generation is well know for angst and hyper analytical approaches to life.
1121;At last I, being a baby boomer, can say that I finally understand and appreciate Generation.
1122;x, to a small degree.
1123;i was happy to see that that first night of love endured and nine years later culminated at her apartment fulfilled.
1124;Amazing how a simple movie with 2 actors can be so powerful.
1125;I would highly recommend this movie.
1126;I am now an Ethan Hawke fun.
1127;After the first movie I was more prepared for the mesmerizing experience.
1128;with pomegranate in hand (a good substitute for popcorn), I watched with a sense of anticipatory wonder.
1129;the playful banter reaches some humorous high points that are beyond witty.
1130;Celine and Jesse seem to share a natural chemistry, which allows them to speak honestly without fear of rejection.
1131;Together they find a delicate balance of revelation and anticipation.
1132;The entire plot truly happens more in the characters minds than onscreen.
1133;The casual natural sets are still magical, but I think the best scene is in the first movie when Celine and Jesse are kissing under the stars.
1134;The ending of this movie has to be in my top 10 of inspiring movie endings.
1135;There is a taste of the future and enough uncertainty to intrigue long after this movie has ended.
1136;I just created a my list best
1137;A pure beauty for those who appreciate a movie that is pure art.
1138;It hits you 20 minutes in to the movie.
1139;These two are incredible
1140;A pure enjoyment for those who know a beautiful movie.
1141;I was a huge fan of Before Sunrise and was a bit apprehensive when I heard a sequel was in the works.
1142;That perfect night between Jessie and Celine was, in my opinion, the epitomy of what makes being young and in love wonderful.
1143;When they both realize that a perfect connection was the true connection .
1144;Nine years is a long time after which to rekindle a brief romance, but these two are definitely good for each other.
1145;Julie Delpy carries this movie.
1146;An excellent date night show, but don't have too much wine .
1147;Good entertainment with great dialogue.
1148;This is a unique series filmed 10 years apart.
1149;Great story and meeting (not by chance)!
1150;The original film was released in 1995, and told the tale of an American college boy (Jesse, played by Ethan Hawke) and a French college girl (Celine, played by Julie Delpy), who meet on a train in Europe and spend a romantic night together in Vienna.
1151;Hawke and Delpy pull their roles off perfectly: a little more jaded, but still thoughtful and conversation.
1152;the film is shot as if it were really in real.
1153;So, instead, we can take pleasure of observing the 80.
1154;Now, with this film, I see things nicely book.
1155;ended, and I see a mirror of the type of relationship I actually have.
1156;one in which thoughtful conversation is important.
1157;and, it was nice to see Paris again.
1158;so, check it out if you have a chance!
1159;revisiting the characters from Before Sunrise 9 years later was a masterful stroke by Linklater, Delpy and Hawke .
1160;it is true that over the course of the movie, you discover a lot about both Jesse and Celine, and that you see their love blooming again.
1161;but it is also true that you discover they both held a torch for each other for years, and it damaged their ability to get close to others.
1162;when they meet again, they both have immense walls in place.
1163;they say things and interact with each other from behind those walls.
1164;they begin share the more honest aspects of their lives.
1165;i found this to be the best movie of 2004 .
1166;quite a beautiful thing to watch.
1167;Loved that they both moved on, but still savored the things they had years before.
1168;Would definitely recommend this movie .
1169;This movie is a phenomenal collection to your movie library.
1170;It stars Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy who make the perfect match on screen.
1171;I won't spill anything, but this is definitely a delightful, funny, and intellectual watch.
1172;And it's a rare treat to be able to revisit characters you got to know in one film ten years later.
1173;In my opinion, that's the way to go.
1174;it helps enjoy the movie to remember those little moments yourself.
1175;From there, they wander the scenic streets of Vienna, mostly talking, and falling in love.
1176;We see how the intellectual connection is made almost simultaneously with the physical attraction.
1177;and it's almost palpable how convincing the film is.
1178;What's cool is that as the two reunite, we can see the age lifting from them.
1179;Anyway, in these little gems, he is terrific.
1180;The conversational, improvised tone fits him very well, and he's convincing.
1181;Delpy, whom I haven't seen in much else, is very good.
1182;It's fun to watch smart people making a connection.
1183;They're both quick witted and funny, especially Delpy.
1184;the first film was mostly upbeat.
1185;even though we knew they had to part ways, there was so much fun in watching them connect so convincingly.
1186;The movie captured the ebullience of young love.
1187;All of that reads as very convincing and believable.
1188;the final ten minutes or so of the film are about as quiet and tiny as any you'll see.
1189;The ending is the ultimate in bittersweet.
1190;i admire the films because they dialogue, while probably more intelligent and witty then any of us could muster up, FEELS real.
1191;And there's a lot of it, and it's fun to listen to.
1192;The actors also listen to each other very avidly.
1193;It all feels authentic, and makes you realize how many movies really don't.
1194;Director Richard Linklater knows what the strengths are and doesn't tamper with them.
1195;They are a bit full of themselves.
1196;But on the other hand, it's a strength that they aren't afraid to have some significant warts too.
1197;i recommend both movies to adults.
1198;Loved this one from beginning to end!
1199;Most people would recommend that you view BEFORE SUNRISE first.
1200;These films are wonderful entertainment for the middle.
1201;That is what this film meant to me, looking at the kaleidiscope of life as it passes by, so sweet, so unsatisfying at times yet so perfect when the right person is there.
1202;this film is a poem to Paris and the passing of youth, with the hope of recapturing that one love, which when found engraves itself so deeply that it is like a hinge in the mind, always present, always remembered, always desired.
1203;this is a genuinely beautiful film, more mature than the last one, much sadder and in many ways better and more realistic.
1204;It opened that sense of mystery that I have known, in life and its surprises and potential in the luck of finding true intimacy.
1205;julie Delphy is one of those rare women who gets more beautiful as she ages.
1206;Their relationship, so brief, rings totally true, in its humor, commitment, and occasional awkwardness.
1207;perhaps this is sentimental, but I think I have known love like this.
1208;It is an image more in my mind than the person perhaps, but our friendship is as deep as it was when we met nearly 35 years ago.
1209;It is an extraordinary sympathy for one another that is beyond sex (well, maybe not too far beyond.)
1210;This succeeds brilliantly at a snapshot in time, with an entire history implied behind it, like the greatest art.
1211;I wanted to see this movie since Before Midnight got such good reviews.
1212;I first watched Before Sunrise and enjoyed both movies.
1213;What is it about these two movies that has touched my heart strings so much.
1214;Both movies are highly recommended and Julie Delpy if you are reading this,I want to be the father of your children!
1215;perfect pair of real people portrayed here.
1216;And the last two lines are the best I've heard in years and years of seeing movies.
1217;A MUST SEE for people with brains, intellect, and love of film.
1218;the film itself: Before Sunset is the sequel to Before Sunrise, a wonderful little film from 1995.
1219;You don't have to see that film first, but I'd recommend doing so anyway, because it's very good, and because it increases the emotional impact of Before Sunset.
1220;if you have seen Before Sunrise and liked it, you will almost certainly like Before Sunset.
1221;The two films share a lot in common: an overwhelming focus on the two main characters, lots of good dialog, and a very sweet love story.
1222;there are a few differences:The acting is better in Before Sunset.
1223;There's also more at stake: it's so rare in life to find someone with whom you truly connect, and if you let them go, it's even more rare to get a second chance with them later.
1224;Simone is famous for singing very moving, haunting, sad songs.
1225;But Just in Time is quite happy: Just in time/I found you just in time/before you came, my time was running low/I was lost/the losing dice were tossed/my bridges all crossed/nowhere to go/Now you're here and now I know just where I'm going/no more doubt or fear/I've found my way/For love came just in time/you found me just in time/and changed my lonely life.
1226;In that final scene, Celine is dancing and playfully singing along with Nina Simone, while Jesse is smiling and enjoying her performance.
1227;Just as good and possibly a little better.
1228;I loved the music and especially Nina Simone at the end of the movie.
1229;I thought it was well written and well acted.
1230;Absolutely great acting and a wonderful, enticing script.
1231;i absolutely recommend this movie.
1232;it was subtle and genuine.
1233;sequel to an infinitely great film is truly the best film (so far) of 2004.
1234;The screenplay, co. written by director Richard Linklater and stars Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke, is probably one of the most refreshing of this decade.
1235;It succeeds on so many levels because of the development of this relationship and the fact that Delpy and Hawke have such a three dimensional knowledge of these complex characters.
1236;Fictional of course, but they are still the most humanistic screen couple I've ever seen.
1237;the screenplay and direction are flawless.
1238;Delpy and Hawke take this dialogue and make it into their own.
1239;Some of the best acting this year can be found in Sunset.
1240;the city of Paris serves as a fluid and dreamlike backdrop to the graceful and powerful, bittersweet and engrossing talk.
1241;Sunset is well filmed, and embraces just enough of Paris, which in fact would be more noticeable upon the inevitable second viewing.
1242;This city has never looked better on the screen!I liked the fact that both Jesse and Celine expressed their true feelings through an art form, he with a book, and she with a song.
1243;Although they never once said a word along the lines of I love you, you know throughout the entire film that they are still in love with each other.
1244;by the time the ending came around, I held back tears in my eyes.
1245;out of happiness for these characters.
1246;If a film can do that, it's a winner in my mind.
1247;Those last words of the film leave you wanting more, but they are also brilliant and have stuck out in my mind amidst the philosophy and deep discussions.
1248;I won't ruin it, but the ending is just so amazing because you know that something good is going to happen.
1249;This story is so life like that it seems events are moving without a script.
1250;It is a recording of a very human experience and not a drama played out by a set of writers, actors, and a director.
1251;This was a great sequel to Before Sunrise.
1252;The locations, from narrow Parisian sidestreets, cruising under ponts (bridges) on the Seine, to landmarks such as Notre Dame, are stunning, and seem much more alive than did Vienna in the first film.
1253;good romance from Before Sunrise.
1254;ended and positive than its predecessor, and Ethan Hawke mentions in the behind.
1255;(For someone from Qu bec, there's poetic justice in hearing Parisians speak with a (loathed) Qu b cois accent!)
1256;I loved Before Sunrise and couldn't wait to see the sequel.
1257;Good actor dialog and scenery.
1258;I vaguely remember the first movie titled Before Sunrise and enjoyed it for what it was.
1259;a brief encounter of 2 strangers in an interesting environment with lots to see.
1260;Ethan stares at her with puppy dog eyes and a goofy grin and just vacuosly agrees with her anti.
1261;Their dialogue often drifts from displays of serious emotions to more frivolous topics, but there is an element that keeps the audience continually interested.
1262;all in all, BEFORE SUNSET is a touching film filled with romance and wonder.
1263;The film is set on a gorgeous afternoon in Paris where golden light spills onto every rooftop and alleyway.
1264;What makes this film work so amazingly is its simplicity
1265;From that is borne the film's main strength.
1266;we care so much about these people that their pending seperation creates an overwhelming amount of tension, making the film consistently entertaining and a joy to watch.
1267;They meet, get coffee, talk, wander around, and all the while chance and fate continue to work, until the ending arrives on a note of beauty and complete grace.
1268;It's often the little movies that hit you the hardest.
1269;Before Sunrise, the first collaboration between Ethan Hawke, Julie Delpy, and Richard Linkater (now of School of Rock fame) was a classic 90's indie film.
1270;After one of the most romantic 24 hours in cinema history, Jesse departs for America, but they plan to meet at the same train platform in 6 months.
1271;Before Sunset takes place 9 years later, and Jesse and Celine meet by chance in Paris.
1272;what makes Before Sunset so poignant is how well Delpy and Hawke inhabit Celine and Jesse .
1273;defining roles for both of them.
1274;It's important to note that Delpy and Hawke share screenwriting credits on this movie with Linklater.
1275;a fantastically written and wonderfully acted little movie (clocking in at a mere 80 minutes, counting final credits), Before Sunset is a perfect bookend to Before Sunrise.
1276;As wonderful as Before Sunset is, you absolutely must see Before Sunrise first.
1277;This is easily the best movie I've seen all year.
1278;After all those years, there's still such chemistry and connection between them, and in the end, that's what the film is about.
1279;i found Before Sunset to be just as romantic as Before Sunrise and they don't even share one kiss.
1280;The ending was wonderful, to me.
1281;I was a huge fan of Before Sunrise when it came out.
1282;I loved the simplicity and realism of two young people, who just met, walking around a beautiful European city like Vienna, and getting to know each other.You might wonder what they have left to talk about in this film since they tackled so many subjects in the previous one.
1283;This is a film where the thrill is in the journey, not the goal.
1284;i recall telling friends about the first film and what it was about.
1285;But just like that first film, their conversations are so real and enthralling.
1286;I think part of the reason that it's so compelling is that when these two characters are together, they are themselves.
1287;There is a powerful scene in this film that is a recognition and a tribute to that genuiness and why they feel more comfortable with each other than with anyone else they've ever been with.
1288;i've always said that sometimes the best stories are the simple ones.
1289;And this one is simple, yet again.
1290;These two simple, yet real characters, captivate the audience again with their genuine conversation that holds nothing back, and invites the audience to try and do the same.
1291;That's why it's so refreshing to see such a sweet, touching, realistic and simple movie like Before Sunset.
1292;the film offers a surprise ending that is actually quite fitting for this film.
1293;Hawke and Delpy deliver the strongest performances of their careers
1294;linklater knows how to develop characters and plot, and Before Sunset just comes to show the kind of magician that he is
1295;The whole movie just gets to you in the best of ways.
1296;I was again so moved by this film, I think it's perfect.
1297;It's just that beautiful and important to me.
1298;I really do hope they make these films until Celine and Jesse are in there 80's.
1299;I reviewed Before Sunrise , the prequel to this film and said how surprised I was that the premise, two attractive people, walking around in a beautiful European city talking, could be an engaging film.
1300;I would recommend this movie.
1301;Like its prequel, Before Sunset is an hour and a half of delicious colloquy and a chemistry so effortless you'd probably find this film in the organic section of your local store.
1302;surface conversation that seems determined to breathe in its own space and spew pearls of wisdom such as Memory is a wonderful thing if you don't have to deal with the past.
1303;facile, heady, sexy as Lycra .
1304;avoids a conventionally neat conclusion, instead tantalizing us with yet more questions.
1305;if you ask me, it works superbly.
1306;Though the film has much more going for it.
1307;There're some stunning acting sequences with uninterrupted takes for minutes on end.
1308;There's that familiar, delectable brand of wit that'll keep you glued.
1309;There's even an acoustic guitar performance at the end by Delphie herself, and my, what a breathtaking moment that is.
1310;Plus I'm addicted to this rare glimpse of intelligent, non.
1311;I loved finding out what happened to each of them and seeing them reconnect.
1312;There are very very few movies that can keep you engaged with only two actors talking, Richard Linklater triology are definitely one of those.
1313;Excellent conversations enacted by superb acting.
1314;Haven't enjoyed a movie this much for a while.
1315;Those who are not getting it, are probably the ones mentioned in the movie who move on very easily.
1316;He's a writer
1317;My husband saw this movie once on TV and he had been wanting to see it again, so I looked this up and lo and behold I found it on Amazon!!
1318;And I also bought the other series of this movie.
1319;What more can you do to take a sequel and screw it up completely.
1320;Watched this entire series with my girlfriend.
1321;Well written, well made movies about a normal modern romance.
1322;Before Sunset is a wonderful continuation of Jesse and Celine's chance meeting 9 years earlier.
1323;The characters are witty and spontaneous and flirtateous.
1324;These days, it's rare to find movies that are candid and raw.
1325;you're hopeful for them, you're sad for them.
1326;Leaving you with that wondering what if and what now.
1327;Thank you so much for allowing me to see this wonderful movie on the convenience of my computer!!!!!
1328;The whole concept between these three films (one couple, filmed over a 20.
1329;Add to that, smart, often surprising dialogue, attractive actors, and wonderful locations and it earns the stars.
1330;It was great fun to see some of the references in the last film emerge in the earlier ones, and even more engaging to see the actors age and mature.
1331;I found Ethan Hawke, while likable, not the most interesting male lead.
1332;Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are simply amazing in this.
1333;they poignantly tell many important emotional truths.
1334;Watch the entire Before trilogy .
1335;Richard Linklater is a genius.
1336;It is a beautiful bookend film that intensifies the emotional impact of its predecessor.
1337;Skipping the first film will dilute much of the magic of the second.
1338;Perhaps the most impressive aspect of Before Sunset is that it proves beyond all doubt that a minimalist work can be just as entertaining as a Hollywood blockbuster.
1339;This film is driven mainly by its dialogue which is so well.
1340;Hawke and Delpy have a wonderful chemistry that is even more enchanting the second time around.
1341;They create such appealing characters and we become so immersed in their conversations that we find ourselves wishing that we too could pass our time hanging out with them.
1342;I can relate to this: having a special time with another person, keeping every image fresh in your mind, and then being inspired to write a book.
1343;The characters were again very appealing.
1344;I loved the way she kept reminding him of his flight and he kept replying.
1345;The ending was adorable in a very soulful way.
1346;I felt like saying, Shut up and kiss the girl!
1347;But there remained a natural flow between these two that was very appealing.
1348;It is not often that a sequel surpasses the original, especially when the original is as magnificent as Before Sunrise.
1349;Before Sunset is one such sequel.
1350;It expounds and improves upon the first movie in every way.
1351;As its title subtley suggests, Before Sunset is more seasoned than its predecessor
1352;It shows in the writing, directing, and performances, particularly that of Julie Delpy who is just fantastic in this picture.
1353;The ending is letter and picture perfect.
1354;I greatly enjoyed the prequel to this film.
1355;But it is the sequel, Before Sunset, that I absolutely love.
1356;Fortune in a way that I actually believe could happen in real life brings them back together again.
1357;They've both matured, he's a successful writer, she works for a charitable organization.
1358;This time, they exchange addresses and phone numbers, and promise to stay in touch.
1359;many years ago, in a job.
1360;We experienced that amazing connection that two people can have, and were inseparable while the class was going on.
1361;This is how mature people handle this kind of thing .
1362;You have to be responsible to the people around you, with whom you share your life.
1363;i keep watching it and watching it, alone and with friends.
1364;is amazing watching the sunset.
1365;Even without knowing the story behind these former lovers the film's brilliant director Richard Linklater gives you just enough background to enjoy the interplay between these wonderfully written characters anyway.
1366;The best part, however, is the brilliant dialogue.
1367;In the first film the actors were performing a well written script by Linklater and Kim Krizan and it worked very well.
1368;The beautiful thing is that the film.
1369;long conversation is something you could imagine overhearing in a neighborhood coffee shop.
1370;Unlike the majority of films these people actually talk like people.
1371;At one point in the film while describing his failing marriage Jesse says I feel like I'm running a small nursery with someone I used to date, this line describes Jesse's feeling that something is missing in his life beautifully.
1372;It's also incredibly realistic and a line that I could imagine coming out of someone's mouth in a real conversation.
1373;So few films are able to achieve this realism in dialogue and it serves to represent these characters as ordinary people.
1374;the romance in the film is also true to life.
1375;Most films take the easy way out and present us with an idealized version of romance, lots of flowers, romantic tactics, and dreamy kisses.
1376;the bottom line here is that if you liked the first film you will enjoy this one.
1377;In many ways it is a better written film with a grittier realism to it.
1378;This movie is an unexpected sequence for the lovely Before Sunrise and a great surprise for its fans!
1379;The characters reunite in another incredible setting: a beautiful Paris in summertime!
1380;it is a beautiful view of how few moments can be so strong and present in our lives!
1381;And that we should strive to make these moments last forever.
1382;Would they be able to move on with their lives after their one incredible evening together?
1383;Their dialogue with one another is as though they never left each other, which in a way is very satisfying to see.
1384;The conversation relates to things they have talked about before, venturing into the philosophical issues of life, and the half written, half improvised script is very realistic, and very satisfying.
1385;What Before Sunset is is a brilliantly romantic movie about holding on to one's past, trying to keep heading for the future, and wondering what could have been.
1386;Everything here is perfect, and this needs to be considered one of the best movies of the year, without question.
1387;It is simple, quick and it gets to all the things we have wanted to know about for the last nine years.
1388;I also found that this movie had a very good ending, revealing just enough and leaving enough to the imagination to appease all viewers.
1389;This truly is a great film.
1390;For those fans of Before Sunrise , this is an absolute must see, and Jesse and Celine should be considered some of the great romantic characters of all time.
1391;absorbed and less capable of real love.
1392;Photographed in real time in Paris (like the Shakespeare and Co.
1393;Atomosphere gets A+, Conversation between these two star.
1394;crossed lovers A., Ending perfect A+.
1395;That's is what made this motion picture an emotional experience to remember.
1396;The most intelligent movie dialogue I have ever seen/heard.
1397;Thought provoking, smart, humorous, and romantic!
1398;Julie Delpy's acting is unforgettable.
1399;can the director made another sequal please?
1400;I loved this movie I thought the actors had so much chemistry, it may just be them walking and talking, but its a story about life, love and so much more.
1401;It tells alot of what is really inside people, its a movie you can really relate too.
1402;everytime I watch it, I come away with so much more, it's inspiring and most of all insightful.
1403;This movie was better than the first one.
1404;Still a lot of dialog but you got a deeper understanding of the characters and their lives in this film.
1405;The past, in Proust's work, is always in a dialectic relationship with the present.
1406;that is, it never leaves us and it is always filtered through the now.
1407;And yet, at the same time I would genuinely feel sorry for someone who hasn't read The Great Gatsby, Catch.22, The Sound and the Fury, Slaughterhouse Five, Moby Dick, The Sun Also Rises, along with a whole host of other classics before his or her time is up.
1408;i bring all of this up because the movie Before Sunset is all about the passage of time and how the choices we make preclude certain avenues in our lives.
1409;Celine works in an environmental non.
1410;profit, but she has never fully committed to any single relationship over the years.
1411;In many ways these two characters are immensely successful for their age.
1412;Celine might still worry about the state of the world, but she works for a company that makes real changes.
1413;Jessie has published a book that is potentially successful enough to warrant a promotional engagement at Shakespeare and Company.
1414;There's a sense throughout the film that both Jessie and Celine have romanticized their night together as a means of avoiding their present day problems.
1415;In fact, over the years the characters have become more romantic.
1416;Sunset only touches upon some of these issues (which they will hopefully get to in the third chapter), but it does present us with something that's incredibly rare in American cinema: two likable, engaging people genuinely dealing with growing older and understanding the impact of life's choices.
1417;for all these reasons and more Sunset is the better film.
1418;It's more tightly woven than the first and we know pretty early on what our number one question is .
1419;The film dances around the edges of intimacy at the beginning .
1420;Only when time ticks away and both realize what they are about to lose, once again, do they begin to turn to their inner most thoughts and desires.
1421;Still, the French government is no better and have committed horrendous acts of their own.
1422;It's romantic, thought provoking and ground breaking.
1423;Along with Before Sunrise this film is of the most intelligent, organic, and realistic of the genre.
1424;I have to agree to with the blockbuster.
1425;All you see is two people talking to each other.
1426;The lady has slept around with who knows how many men.
1427;Many reviewers seem to have already said what I wanted to say, but still I want to add my words about hits enchanting little film about love and life.
1428;charming, sweet, poignant and beautiful .
1429;in other words, the film is very realistic in showing how people meet and love each other.
1430;the premise is simple, but the resonant story is honest and becomes deeply emotional as it goes on, much deeper if you fondly remember the original film Before Sunrise made in 1994.
1431;Its sequel Before Sunset reflects the lapse of nine years, and how these two likable characters have grown up.
1432;up to Before Sunrise: Enjoyed the movie.
1433;I enjoy the premise of the trilogy and the screenwriting of R. Linklater as well as the performances of Ethan Hawke and Julie Delphy.
1434;I went in with high expectations, and all of them were met, then some.
1435;first of all I've always been a huge fan of Before Sunrise, considering it to be the best romantic movie in history.
1436;That said, I'm delighted to announce that Before Sunset is a sequel completely worthy of its matchless predecessor.
1437;I think I speak for all fans of Before Sunrise that we never expected to see a sequel, and that this movie is a dream come true.
1438;everything that made the first movie so great is duplicated here, but in a fresh and engaging way.
1439;Director Linklater knows his stuff
1440;It's perhaps a big artistic gamble, but it works, just as it did for the first movie.
1441;chatty, but it only adds to the realism, and gradually builds in crescendo as Jesse and Celine slowly reveal to each other what they REALLY want to say, yet are afraid to.
1442;Yet all this is skilfully and subtly conveyed, and we are not beaten over the head with it, as a lesser director may have been tempted to do.
1443;ride scene towards the end when Celine reveals her sadness and misery that Jesse is now married with kids was done brilliantly and with heart.
1444;Equally poignant was Jesse's retort, revealing his recurring dream of the French girl he could never forget.
1445;both Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy make wonderful performances in this movie and have rich, kinetic chemistry with each other.
1446;We really believe that they are in love.
1447;Smart, funny, insecure yet independent, and genuinely adorable.
1448;Her beauty is a down.
1449;Plus there's the light but irresistible French accent thing going.
1450;Hawke does a fine job too, creating a character I truly like and identify with.
1451;We see the difference between Jesse's idealistic romanticism and Celine's cautious cynacism, yet we also see the undeniable link between them that is the source of their love.
1452;Once again, everything is done with minimalist, artful grace.
1453;But we see and understand nevertheless with crystal clarity what is going on in Jesse's mind as he desperately attempts to squeeze out every possible extra precious second he can with Celine.
1454;the ending of Before Sunrise was brilliant and unforgettable, but ultimately poignant and ended on a downer tone.
1455;That said, the ending of Before Sunset was utterly sublime and genius, one of the most satisfying conclusions to a movie I have ever seen.
1456;Yes, even if you've never seen Before Sunrise, you will enjoy this movie.
1457;This film is the perfect love story adding to Before Sunrise filmed in 1994 it takes us through the awkwardness of a love so passionately unrequited.
1458;The original movie took us on a visual journey through Europe starting on a Eurorail and ending with the sunrise in Vienna.
1459;The couple agreed to meet in the same place and we were left to wonder what ever happened to this engaging couple and their great banter.
1460;Well finally the answer can be found in this updated conversation between Jesse and Celine in of all places, the most romantic city in the world, Paris!
1461;Jesse, now a writer, is surprised by Celine during his book signing in Paris.
1462;Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy maintain a fantastic rhythm throughout this film walking through Paris while having a most interesting conversation.
1463;Despite its simplicity in actuality the writing is quite sophisticated and now very grown.
1464;All of the passion and chemistry from the first film remains between the characters here and I imagine a third film will be on the back burner.
1465;Director Richard Linklater has filmed pure poetry against a perfect romantic backdrop and he will leave you begging for more with or without the sun.
1466;So I am thankful that I saw this film, and so thankful that Linklater, Delpy and Hawke made it and gave it such a uniquely personal light.
1467;A great companion piece to My Dinner with Andre.
1468;It IS a good ending, and it IS well executed.
1469;Though you must absolutely be familiar with the prequel and the former love story, I felt this sequel took the story to new level.
1470;The dialogue was absolutely beautiful and intimate and Julie Delphy was more captivating than the first movie.
1471;I remember catching Before Sunrise on tv a while ago and thinking what an incredible movie it was.
1472;I loved how things were drawn out and how it never cut to a specific scene.
1473;It didn't really seem so much like a movie but a beautiful piece of life.
1474;The ending was easily one of the best endings I've ever seen, if you like romantic movies, or even if you don't, I'm sure you will love Before Sunset
1475;It is awesome to see the characters evolve yet basically stay the same at the core over time .
1476;just like in real life.
1477;It's adult talk about their relationships, life since the first one.
1478;day meeting in Vienna, and it demands full attention.
1479;But for the most part it works and his earnestness and her quirkiness keep our interest.
1480;Nice way to spend part of an evening.
1481;I'd enjoyed Sunrise very much, because it was a trully original romantic movie without the formulas and big sets used by Julia Roberts, Meg Ryan, and Reese Witherspoon.
1482;It was a beautiful story about love at first sight.
1483;there were many funny and touching moments filled with introspective dialogues that worked perfectly for this documentary.
1484;Before Sunrise was the perfect vehicle for her to play a young French woman who is sexy, naive, and vulnerable.
1485;She carried through the film with a flawless performance.
1486;day experience with a French girl in Vienna 9 years ago.
1487;It was amazing to see Hawke and Delpy delivering intense dialogues that was 5.10 minutes long in one take.
1488;Before Sunset manages to capture the same feeling amd mood of Before Sunrise as Jesse and Celine travel around beautiful Paris talking about life.
1489;The characters remain true to their Before Sunrise selves in a very engaging 80 minutes.
1490;talking not much action or education type of movie but somehow I totally enjoyed this.
1491;this is good stuff when it comes to movies.
1492;well produced and really great acting.
1493;creative in its motive and has lots of feeling
1494;I would highly recommend this movie to anyone with a romantic side.
1495;My husband even dared to watch it with me and liked it.
1496;Well made, well written, and well acted as always.
1497;This movie got my wife and I hooked on the 10 year interval series.
1498;It is so realistic and subtle, not too grandiose, but still quietly dramatic.
1499;The woman was centered, smart, willing, and could hold her own in conservation even of an very intimate and personal nature.
1500;This is a real treat.
1501;This is a highly entertaining, thought.
1502;Great performances by Hawke and Delpy.
1503;Great Acting and a beautiful ending.
1504;The actors have such good chemistry.
