1;My absolute favorite Christmas Movie.
2;This has been one of our favorite X. mas movies and has now become my daughter in law's top rated X. mas movie.
3;This is a favorite movie we always enjoy.
4;"It's a cute enough idea
I:11001;5;The Movie """"A Christmas Story"""" came out in the early 1980's and has remained a prominent Christmas classic to present time."""
6;"A simpler time in America History when people enjoyed Christmas, said ""Merry Christmas"", and could possibly even leave their door unlocked."
7;This is a movie every family should watch over and over again during the Christmas season.
8;A rare treasure by modern day standards.
9;Jean Shepherd's 'A Christmas Story' deserves to be the classic it is.
10;It is a likable reminiscence of a Christmas past when the author's near self, Ralphie, yearns to get an airrifle for Christmas.
11;"He makes every hint possible, but is always rebuffed with the counsel, ""You'll shoot your eye out."""
12;much of the movie is episodic with fun scenes that thread loosely with the main plot.
13;Narrated by Shepherd, himself, the memoir is a fun and funny trek through holidays past.
14;Some of the best scenes include his inner imaginative takes on life, like his soap blindness scene and his teacher's transformation into the wicked witch of school themes.
15;This is a basic disk with no menu or additional options, but that is kind of nice for a classic like this one.
16;A Christmas Story easily ranks as one of the top 5 Christmas themed movies of all time.
17;The acting is fantastic, the storyline is typical of almost every child that desparately want tSanta to bring them hat one important present.
18;I even watch this movie during the non.
19;holiday months as it just reminds me of my childhood when my worries were few.
20;this story is abselutely precious and is very well written.
21;everything thay happens is adorable!its good from end to end!the fun never stops.
22;the kids will like it as the writer has a keen insight into a childs mind.
23;the funniest thing i think anyone said was when ralphie was trying to help his dad change the tire by holding the lugs for him.
24;ralphies mom is pretty in a girl on the side mid class kinda way.
25;the message is dreamers can prevail,if tactful.
26;this movie is a classic!
27;a fun time for all.
28;Definitely the best Christmas movie.
29;A Christmas without A Christmas Story is unheard of around these parts.
30;This story is probably one of the best Christmas tales to come around the past 25 years.
31;Every time I watch this movie I realize how much things are the same when it comes to Christmas in middle class America.
32;This story seems to tell it better and more realistically than most movies made.
33;Although despite that this is a great movie.
34;This is our family's favorite Christmas movie.
35;It's perfect for all ages!
36;The narrator does a great job throughout the movie helping us all to recall fond memories of our childhood Christmases.
37;You'll be giggling throughout the movie!
38;Ralphie sees the one toy he wants: a Red Ryder BB gun.
39;Mother knows there is danger with such a toy.
40;[Ralphie's fantasies reflect the cowboy movies of the 1930s.]
41;We see an elaborate Christmas parade from that era.
42;Aunt Clara sent a special gift for Ralphie.
43;They'll always remember that day.
44;I wanted to own this movie as it is a classic with lots of laughs and it brings back memories of days gone by.
45;A Christmas Story is still one of the most endearing and hilarious christmas films of all.
46;disc special edition every December and it's defintely worth the money.
47;I love, love, love this film and if you have been living under a rock since 1983, you will love it too, it's a guarantee.
48;This movie reminds me so much of my childhood, including the snowsuits!
49;Everyone has to watch this movie at least once in their life.
50;One of the movies that define the holiday season.
51;The amazing point is that it reached this pinnacle in the modern era.
52;classic story got it for a gift exchange it was a hit everyone loves this story.
53;This movie is a true classic and it is the most watched chrismas movie of all times.
54;this is a must watch for kids and adults.
55;It is approiate for all ages of children.
56;i grew up with this movie and as many times as iv seen it I always find something to laugh at.
57;and the fact that it was based on the guys childhood makes it all the more enjoyable.
58;This is an awesome movie!
59;I watch it every Christmas and now that I bought it, I can watch it all the time.
60;C'mon, this movie is a classic.
61;This movie has captured, with great accuracy, the Spirit of Christmas in America.
62;Much of the humor is crafted by the smaller details, I, a babyboomer, had completely forgot
63;I think it is one of the greatest and best, especially at Christmas time of the year.
64;This is a great Christmas movie.
65;It's nice to have when the 24hr Christmas special is over, a nice thing to relive over and over.
66;Terrific story for all ages.
67;the string of lights it came with are cool!
68;brow humor, nor am I easily amused, so this movie is one helluva an achievement: every time I see it, no matter how many times I see it, it makes me laugh.
69;This is a great film.
70;A Christmas Story, along with It's a Wonderful Life, are my two Christmas Classics.
71;This is a classic funny film.
72;The actors are great and the kids' interactions are really entertaining.
73;Not being a big Christmas person, it's fun to revisit this movie year after year.
74;Well worth it even if you aren't a Christmas person.
75;A must see every year
76;Shipped and received within 3 days.
77;This is the best xmas movie I have ever watched.
78;A Christmas Story is one of my favorite Christmas movies ever.
79;My sister and I watch it every year on the day before Thanksgiving, and at least two more times at Christmas.
80;I always tune in to at least three viewings of it on TNT's 24 Hours of A Christmas Story.
81;Everyone who wants to see a wonderfully funny, adorable Christmas movie, should watch A Christmas Story.
82;One of a kind comedy encapsulating numerous classic American Christmas traditions .
83;I am surprised at the number of poor reviews this movie has received.
84;If, on the other hand, you are in the mood for a witty, well written holiday film then this is for you.
85;:) I would have to say A Christmas Story is definitely a favorite of my entire family.
86;I triple dog dare you to watch this great classic!!!
87;It starts the season every year!
88;Absolutely love it have to watch it every year.
89;Good price, came quickly, the best story told EVER.
90;I saw it for the first time in 1985 and it gets better and better.
91;Great movie at a great price, with some nice extras.
92;The price was very good also for this Blu.
93;Following little Ralphie in his endeavor to get the greatest Christmas gift of all time is a classic that my family must watch at least three times every year.
94;My boys are finally to the age that they can appreciate the movie, and they want to watch it more than ever.
95;Still one of the best ones out there!!
96;Lots of laughs and the narrative style is great.
97;My wife and I sit back and just try to guess how much fun the actors had making that film.
98;Very funny with an old fashion sense of humor.
99;Brings back a lot of memories.
100;My four year old twin grandsons really enjoyed it.
101;Obviously one of the best Christmas movies of all time!
102;Our kids now love it and it is part of our Christmas tradition.
103;Of course I love it!
104;Come to find out, my great.
105;the movie is a classic and the leg lamp lights look great hanging from the fireplace mantel amid the xmas stockings.
106;This is a family favorite.
107;It's a tradition in our family to watch it every Christmas Eve.
108;The movie was cute, but not as memorable as we expected.
109;Better than the edited for time TV version, a must see every Christmas for the entire family.
110;This is a fun movie about a boy's wish for Christmas.
111;"Of course other annual Christmas movie traditons in our home include the classic ""Charlie Brown Christmas"", and one dear to my heart, ""Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer""."
112;I enjoy them immensely of course .
113;It was an instant classic for us, and we watched it every year.
114;introducing it to my husband and then my kids (the younger two don't quite get it yet, but my almost 10 year old loves it!)
115;this movie has all the great nostalgic touches .
116;the perfect example of a 40's.
117;more than the touches of yester.year warmth, however, the absolute hilarity of this Christmas movie is simply unparallelled.
118;i love funny movies .
119;loud ones are as rare as a snowstorm in Texas.
120;This one is the real deal.
121;if you haven't seen it, please .
122;The childhood antics and dreams of Ralphie will win your heart forever, and several lines and scenes from the movie will stay with you always.
123;This is a classic we watch every year with our kids.
124;"So many of the actors turn in understated, wry performances, including the children, who don't resort to ""the cutesys"" in order to keep audience interest high, and come off as true to life, rather than ""movie"" kids."
125;Along with Ralphie's fun fantasies and excitement over his decoder ring, there's magic in small moments .
126;The overall message is one of gruff love and wonder in the face of life's little disappointments.
127;Scut Farkus actually steals the show here, upbeat, energetic and mock.
128;Definitely worth paying a little extra and getting the Blu.
129;I love christmas and nothing is better than snow, presents and spending time with loved ones.
130;But the one thing I anticipate the most is seeing the movie A Christmas Story on TV, a charming tale of a 9 year old boy named Ralphie, his wacky friends and family, and his quest for the ultimate christmas gift, a red rider bee bee gun.
131;It immediately stole my heart.
132;I loved when TNT ran 24 hours of A Christmas Story on Christmas Eve.
133;I recommend this movie to anyone who loves the holidays and who's young at heart.
134;It's a wonderful way to kick off a wonderful holiday.
135;I watched it with my family around the holidays when I was a kid an I have to watch it now with my family.
136;I don't have cable so watching it nonstop on TBS isn't an option but I was very happy to be able to stream it through Amazon.
137;Now, MY kids are enjoying it too.
138;"Nothing uplifting or even sardonic ""this was the Christmas we learned about Chinese Turkey"" ."
139;Don't get me wrong, I thought this was a very cute and funny movie, but I feel like it goes in the category of slightly overrated.
140;I've had many people recommend this movie and said it was one of the best movies of all time.
141;a great movie for the whole family!
142;I was so happy to share it with my son.
143;This is a must see holiday classic!
144;I really appreciate the ability to order on line and have it directly ship to another address.
145;This is, by far, the best Christmas movie ever made!
146;If you are looking to get into the Christmas spirit, watch this movie!
147;This great film deserves better treatment than this.
148;Simply a classic and brings me back to my childhood.
149;Traditional holiday favorite for years to come with my own children :)
150;A Christmas Story is a loved movie for me.
151;I felt the price was great and shipping time/cost was great too.
152;I bought this movie cause its an old christmas movie which I love and recomend italso love the actors in this movie
153;I love this movie and rate the movie, itself, 5 stars.
154;"Great movie
I:11001;155;I watch it every year.
I:11001;156;This was a Christmas gift that I bought for our family to enjoy year after year.
I:11001;157;The performances (even the bit ones) are almost all brilliant, and the stories and situations are very relatable.
I:11001;158;I love this movie from the 1st time I saw it (over 20 yrs ago).
I:11001;159;great laughs many viewings later with so many memorable moments.
I:11001;160;non stop laughs, a tradition to watch this on Thanksgiving with my family for years
I:11001;161;The lamp scene gets my family every time.
I:11001;162;A Christmas Story is a trip back to Christmas with all its imperfect incidents.
I:11001;163;Ralfie's family celebrate the season and each other!
I:11001;164;Its one of the best xmas movies from my childhood and every year I cant wait to c it.
I:11001;165;great memories from the past present and hopefully for my granddaughter too
I:11001;166;We watch this classic every year at Christmas time and it's still our favorite.
I:11001;167;Kids and adults alike will find the humor of the days before Christmas for a boy named Ralphie.
I:11001;168;This movie is entertaining and appropriate for all family members.
I:11001;169;A keeper for generations to come!
I:11001;170;actors were better, and it had added dialogue/action that made it funnier.
I:11001;171;But I have enjoyed it even more since it has been reproduced on a blu.
I:11001;172;The shipment came in a very timely manner and the packaging was perfect.
I:11001;173;It's a Christmas classic and I love to watch it every year.
I:11001;174;It is so funny and even though I know what's going to happen, it still makes me laugh.
I:11001;175;This is one of our favorite Christmas movies we watch it with family every Christmas and have done so for over 20 years.
I:11001;176;She was so excited when I told her I would be able to get it within two business days.
I:11001;177;Takes me back to my childhood.
I:11001;178;Everyone can relate to this timeless Christmas classic.
I:11001;179;It's one of those films you can watch over and over and still laugh at it.
I:11001;180;It's a great film for the entire family since it isn't raunchy or violent.
I:11001;181;It's a classic holiday film that isn't too sweet!
I:11001;182;It came out just before I was born yet my friends always quoted it growing up.
I:11001;183;Great movie for all ages.
I:11001;184;It's still a favorite in our family especially when the holidays are here.
I:11001;185;If you have never seen A Christmas Story you must watch it right away.
I:11001;186;It is one of the best and funniest Christmas movies out there.
I:11001;187;Well finally for the 20th anniversary our wish has come true, kind of.
I:11001;188;if you've never seen this movie before, (considering TNT plays it 24 hours straight every Xmas, I find that hard to believe) this is a true classic.
I:11001;189;This is a movie that can be enjoyed by the whole family, kids and adults.
I:11001;190;Plus there's a lot of heart in this movie.
I:11001;191;Even technically though it's a period piece, in a way it's timeless.
I:11001;192;Very nice, although I think it would have been better with the other 'kids' reminiscing as well.
I:11001;193;You can tell everyone had fun making this film, although at the time no one knew of the future it held.
I:11001;194;A nice addition, but some visuals other than a picture of a radio would have been better.4) Documentary.
I:11001;195;It's great to see some of the other 'kids' today.
I:11001;196;They all have good things to say about being in the film.5) Leg Lamp and Red Ryder gun featurettes.
I:11001;197;Just 2, real easy to find and definitely not worth the effort.
I:11001;198;It's truly a great holiday movie.
I:11001;199;Watched with 7 people from 2 families and no one liked it.
I:11001;200;This is one of my favorite Christmas movies.
I:11001;201;One of the reasons that I like it is that it is so funny.
I:11001;202;And it is always interesting to watch a movie or read a book that involves a child's point of view.
I:11001;203;The whole movie is great, but my two favorite scenes are the scene with the lamp and the bunny costume.
I:11001;204;The scenes between the mother and father are priceless.
I:11001;205;I would recommend this film to anyone.
I:11001;206;Kids will love it, and it will bring back fun memories for the adults.
I:11001;207;There are so many lines in this movie that we quote regularly, that I can't begin to put them all down here, all I can say is if you have never seen this movie, I'm guessing you have been in another country or on the space station, and you need to drop everything and watch it now, it is heartwarming without being smultzy, and full of laughs, and it may very well become a tradition in your home too!
I:11001;208;This is a great classic movie, it will always be a classic very funny and very entertaining I would recommend
I:11001;209;A family favorite for years!
I:11001;210;Don't miss out on this film, you'll treasure it!
I:11001;211;We always watch A Christmas Story every Christmas Day nin our household.
I:11001;212;The two disc set offers some fun extras.
I:11001;213;Shipping time was excellent and product is excellent.
I:11001;214;For those of us who were children in the 60s it is nostalgic.
I:11001;215;This movie is great for the whole family.
I:11001;216;Anyone can watch this and laugh the whole movie through!
I:11001;217;I watched the movie and found it good entertainment, almost nostalgic as it brought back memories of my youth so many years ago.
I:11001;218;I need to be honsest and confess I bought the movie because I'm a Red Ryder fan.
I:11001;219;Thanks for your service, and accept my apology for bending your ear.
I:11001;220;Every one in the family will get a kick out of this movie, particularly the Baby Boomer generation that grew up in the 50's and 60's.
I:11001;221;Ralphie speaks for all those that had to negotiate the complex course of those pre.
I:11001;222;Years later it all seems innocent and humorous but, at the time, we thought otherwise.
I:11001;223;A great movie for any willing to be transported to their youth.
I:11001;224;It is fabulous, funny and nostalgic.
I:11001;225;This set is great with all of the little extras.
I:11001;226;All in all, a great set and I am SO glad I bought it.
I:11001;227;a truly sweet comedy which realistically portrays a real family Christmas.
I:11001;228;This movie has the makings of a classic!
I:11001;229;Best movie ever and so happy to have it i blue ray!
I:11001;230;A timeless classic that all generations should watch!
I:11001;231;This year, I had my oldest son (11) watch it with me and he also enjoyed it very much!
I:11001;232;I have been watching this since I was a child and I plan to watch it multiple times every year.

242;It's good to be able to have a site where I can find both old and new movies.
243;This is a Christmas classic and a must for any holiday collection.
244;The nostalgia is an awesome feeling.

I:11001;310;Knew this would be a classic the first time I saw it!We sitll love to watch it every Christmas!
I:11001;311;I really believe the univeral appeal of this movie is that just about everyone can relate to it in some way or another.

I:11001;326;Ralphie's adventures win my heart everytime.
I:11001;327;Darren McGavin plays Ralphie's dad and his Tim the Tool Man escapades are all hilarious.
I:11001;328;this movie gives me a warm fuzzy feeling no matter how many times I watch it and it deserves five stars.
I:11001;329;We've been viewing it elsewhere for years and finally decided it was time to call it our own so we could see it whenever the spirit moved us.
I:11001;330;It truly never gets old with us as the characters are authentic and full of good humor.
I:11001;331;It is hysterically funny at times, especially when the father receives the leg lamp in the mail and pronounces the word stamped on the box """"fragile"""" as """"fra."""
332;Ralphie and his family make my family's holiday a lot brighter and we all look forward to watching this movie every year.
333;No wonder it's a Christmas classic.
334;Over the years this movie has become a tradition in my family.
335;I love breaking it out every year and watching it over again.
336;this film MUST be owned and viewed every holiday season!
337;Enjoy and share with all those you love.
338;What a wonderful collectors item, my family loves the Christmas story, and with the addition of a cook book plus apron, well beyond what I expected.
339;"A Christmas Story belongs right up there with ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" ""Miracle on 34th Street"" and ""A Christmas Carol"" (choose your favorite version) in the canon of great, indispensable Christmas movies."
340;Though set in the 1940s, its story is timeless, taking us back to when we were kids and so desperately wanted that one special gift under the tree on Christmas morning.
341;The movie brilliantly captures the obsession of young Ralphie and his quest for a Red Ryder BB gun, relaying perfectly the magic and thrill of Christmas through a child's eyes.
342;"But what sets A Christmas Story"" apart from most other holiday movies it its honesty."
343;it's all about the toys!This is one of those rare movies that I can watch again and again.
344;If you haven't seen this I highly recommend.
345;Hopefully it will be released in a wide screen version soon.
346;There is a moment in A CHRISTMAS STORY that you don't hear much about in movie reviews, but it's one of the many scenes that demonstrate how funny the film really is.
347;My own father completely came apart with laughter at that explanation.
348;And every time I see the movie it always gets a laugh out of me and my friends.
349;that's one of the laughs to come out of A CHRISTMAS STORY.
350;He grew up in Southern California in the 1940's and recognized a lot of the elements depicted in the movie.
351;there are other really funny scenes in A CHRISTMAS STORY.
352;The Old Man (Darren McGavin) wins a contest and it's a lamp in the shape of a leg.
353;He puts it right in the front window.
354;Another great scene is what happens when Ralphie tries to plead with Santa after his mother and teacher told him the same thing.
355;This is one really terrifying Santa Clause, and what he does to Ralphie is funny and not surprising.
356;a CHRISTMAS STORY got very good reviews in the winter of 1983, and did okay at the box office.
357;It deserves to be called an American classic today.
358;This is not only the best Christmas movie ever, it's one of the best movies ever!
359;What other movie can completely take you into the movie like this one?
360;If you haven't seen this movie, see it now!
361;It'll get you right into the Christmas spirit.
362;My family loves to watch this every year.
363;A true classic that everyone needs to watch at least once.
364;A holiday must have very funny for the whole family keeps you laughing.
365;Always loved this movie glad I can share with my children
366;He knows it's coming and is tickled pink!
367;He has to watch it every Christmas season.
368;This is a wonderful movie that paints a picture of a far simpler world and Christmas season as it should be.
369;This is my favorite movie.
370;A big Christmas window display of a huge train set.
371;When I was over at my nieces house for Christmas she and her husband put this movie in for us to whach and I loved it, so I just had to have it!
372;I know my husband and I will enjoy it again come Christmas this year and many more to come!
373;I received the movie in good condition and in fine time.
374;"My mom really loves this movie
I:11001;375;Loaded with bizarre situations and colorful dreams of a youth bent on the ultimate Christmas present, A Christmas Story is definately one of the better comedies I've seen.
I:11001;376;This is a great, classic Christmas movie.
I:11001;377;This is a nice set for the 20th anniversary.
I:11001;378;Definitely add it to your collection!
I:11001;379;I took a carload of kids to see this movie at our local art theater, and it was sold out!
I:11001;380;The movie is a classic, and essential for kids to understand what it was like when we were kids.
I:11001;381;We make sure that this movie along with """"It's A Wonderful Life"""" are watched every Christmas Eve."""
382;You can't best this movie for comedy and Christmas Tradition.
383;"Santa may have returned to the North Pole, but in the heart of the city, Christmas was extended as Hollywood came to town to make a modestly budgeted comedy titled ""A Christmas Story."
384;As exciting as it was to have a movie made in one's own backyard, there was little to suggest this film would attract much attention beyond the city limits.
385;The film's biggest star, Darren McGavin, was a superb actor but not a box.
386;"The director, Bob Clark, won admirers for his 1975 holiday themed thriller ""Black Christmas,"" but probably lost most of them after he directed ""Porky's,"" the teenage sex comedy that was a big hit with youthful audiences but widely reviled by almost everyone else."
387;A Christmas Story succeeds because it's sweet but never cloying.
388;The cast, especially McGavin, is superb, and so is the direction.
389;sized protagonist is wholly believable.
390;This has definitely become a classic Christmas movie, and is watched yearly in my home.
391;My kids were so into this movie this year, we went out and bought them Red Ryder's!
392;It's a must own Christmas movie.
393;It is one of my all time favorites.
394;I love all of the characters.
395;It's loads of fun to watch any time of the year!
396;A Christmas Story is filled with memorable scenes and highlights that have helped built a cult following around the life of a young boy obsessed with Christmas and surrounding by eccentric family members.
397;Meanwhile, Ralphie dreams of saving the whole family with his Red.
398;one of the best sequences in the film involves a family trip to the local department store, where Ralphie and his little brother Randy meet with the store Santa Clause near closing time.
399;Following a long, extended wait to reach the front of the line to see Santa, Ralphie is so brimming with anticipation to tell Santa what he wants that he can't speak.
400;One of the best Christmas comedies ever made (few come close to Christmas Vacation), A Christmas Story is a memorable holiday classic that the whole family can enjoy.
401;"The timeless nature of its subject matter lends itself well to annual holiday viewing, and it remains one of the few ""must see"" films of the season."
402;Period!This is the best Christmas movie of my generation.
403;And many more to come.
404;So give the movie a shot and you'll love it.
405;I triple dog dare you!
406;A wonderful Christmas story that anyone that was a child will love.

417;All of that aside, it holds up as a classic Christmas film to be enjoyed by most.
418;Always fun to see again and again.
419;I never saw this movie growing up and every Christmas everyone talks about it so I decided we'd give it a whirl and perhaps start a new Christmas family tradition.
420;It looks like it was made for television and fits comfortably there.
421;This is one of the funniest movies you will ever see.
422;If you watch it at Christmas it will seem all the more appropriate.
423;Kids of all ages like it.
424;It is a early 1940s period piece that will appeal very strongly to those that grew up in the 40s or 50s.

439;It is warm, funny, and nostalgic.

I:11001;510;Of course, a fantastic movie that is played throughout the holidays in our home.

I:11001;629;It reminds me of seeing the movie as a kid for the first time on TV at Christmas time.
I:11001;630;as for the film itself, this movie is quite easily the best Christmas movie ever made.
I:11001;631;Besides telling a funny story, this movie portrays not only how most families are, but how they should be.
I:11001;632;we have a mother constantly making sure her kids are safe and happy.
I:11001;633;When the Father is watching his overjoyed child unwrap and prepare his new treasure, I still smile everytime.
I:11001;634;In a world filled with politically correct super fuzzy Christmas movies, it's great to sit down and watch a classic Christmas movie.
I:11001;635;This 1983 film is based on the short stories by Jean Shepherd (who also does the film's narration) and is played for twenty.
I:11001;636;My dad didn't care for it, but mom thought it was funny.
I:11001;637;every year for the 18 years that I've been a high school English teacher, I have shared this movie with my students on the last day of break.
I:11001;638;It is a wonderful story of the spirit of Christmas .
I:11001;639;love, giving, tradition, and family.
I:11001;640;My students and I laugh together throughout, and the final scene leaves them with a warm feeling of family love as I send them off on vacation.
I:11001;641;A truly special experience for all of us!
I:11001;642;A gem of a movie.
I:11001;643;loved it when I first saw it in the theater.
I:11001;644;It can be a little over the top at times, but that is what makes it funny, and who could ever forget the lovely lamp or the young boy's desire for a gun for Christmas.
I:11001;645;The narration adds to the movie (that's what makes it so cool!)
I:11001;646;If you like Christmas movies, this is the one for you!
I:11001;647;it's still easy to see who is who!
I:11001;648;One does need a break from the sentimental and musical ones now and again.
I:11001;649;It's just one funny scene after another, with hilarious sides running through, like Dad and the Bumpus dogs and his bouts with the furnace.
I:11001;650;Ah, Mom was a good one, covering for the guys, but strict when it counts!
I:11001;651;And it was the best.
I:11001;652;wrapped gift, no doubt store done.
I:11001;653;all for me was the absolutely side.
I:11001;654;life common events and has a touching side as well.
I:11001;655;ho's with absolutely NO ho.
I:11001;656;What an amazing child actor!
I:11001;657;this has always been one one the greatest christmas movie .
I:11001;658;i still enjoy watching it.
I:11001;659;it always puts a smile on my face and brings back some great memories.
I:11001;660;i got it so i can watch it anytime i want to.
I:11001;661;Every home should have their own copy of this classic comedy yet true to life version of how growing up in the forties really was.
I:11001;662;This is my most favorite movie of all times.
I:11001;663;I grew up in Cleveland and Ralphie's day to day life just takes me back so many years.
I:11001;664;One of the funniest Christmas movies out there!
I:11001;665;Ralphie is such a delight and his quirky family all interact so well together.
I:11001;666;A very well done movie!
I:11001;667;classic tale, of a young boys quest for a Red Rider BB.
I:11001;668;what was so amazing about the movie was how so many of those things happened to my family during one Christmas or another.
I:11001;669;seeing Santa at the large department store, was always a big deal.
I:11001;670;the rest of the family in this movie was just as genuine"
671;one of the main things that keep this movie genuine, is that it's an ordinary family, and a personal Christmas.
672;We have a normal, intimate, family ceremony of opening the gifts, and then enjoying the presents.
673;When this movie played for the first time in the 80's, those great times as a kid, all came back to me with some degree of fondness.
674;I love it when they give you both the Wide screen, and Full screen versions.
675;I watch this movie every year at Christmas time.
676;funny story that makes me smile every time I see it.
677;hundred shot range model air rifle with a compass in the stock and the thing which tells time!

683;It is the best of family old time but relatable to now movies.
684;we have to watch it each year!
685;good deal for the price.
686;It's okay is all I have to say.
687;has a great story line and you have to love the scene at the Chinese Restaurant.
688;One of my favorite scenes (other than Christmas morning where Ralphie gets what he wanted) is the very end of the movie.
689;That's a big deal in our household.
690;She was honest that she did not like the movie but her family did, and she said you love it or hate it.
691;to everyone this is a very cute movie that will make a good portion of you laugh and smile.
692;We always watch this every year.
693;It reminds us of our childhoods and the way Christmas used to be celebrated.
694;Great price and I love that it was available on Blue Ray!So awesome to enjoy it without commercials!
695;A great tale of growing up too.
696;Not one of my favorite Christmas movies, my husband loves it.
697;Wonderful family movie, great for all.
698;i ordered this as a gift because it is a great christmas classic and can be watched over and over
699;This movie is a christmas classic in our house.
700;We watch it every year while decorating the christmas tree and putting up lights.
701;I thought it was great the first time and have steadily appreciated it more and more each year.
702;This year I introduced it to my 8.
703;It holds up pretty well, although there was more swearing in the movie than I remembered.
704;The kids enjoyed it, and while I was worried it might be a little slow for them they didn't think so.
705;Was excited and relieved to find this on amazon!
706;This is always a great movie, especially around Christmas.
707;This movie is hysterical and can be viewed and enjoyed by the entire family.
708;This is the funniest christmas movie I've seen.
709;To anticipation of the gift and childhood dreams.
710;Kids are so wonderful and hard to figure out.
711;This is a funny quirky family movie that will be enjoyed by adults as well as children.
712;Sure to be a classic.
713;This gift was greatly enjoyed by the reciever.
714;He is a great fan of this movie and must watch it, I swear, at least every other day during the holidays!!
715;The whole idea of the apron and cookie cutters was great!
716;A Christmas Story is the sort of movie you'll love to see again and again.
717;visitation into America's sentimental past that is a delight.
718;There's a bit of nostalgia with this one.
719;I remember liking it more than I actually do, but I loved it then I like it now.
720;Watch it and have lots of laughs!
721;Just full of good old fashioned laughs.
722;A lot of the commentary info afterwards was great to hear and learn bits and pieces about the movie.
723;My kids and I enjoyed it but my wife who never watched it as a kid didn't care for it so much.
724;Luckily the recipient was happy to get it because they had misplaced their copy.
725;We watch this movie every year and for me it helps bring in the Christmas spirit.
726;My wife and her family *love* this movie, which is why I give it more than one star.
727;A great and funny Christmas classic.
728;I always enjoy watching this every year and never get tired of enjoying it.
729;The setting takes place in the early 1940s in a middle class, midwestern small town.
730;The movie does a wonderful job of telling the story from a child's point of view all the way down to his daydreaming and scemes.
731;if you are looking for a funny and charming trip down memory lane then this movie is a must see.
732;It will take you back to the innocence of your childhood when you and all of your friends still believed in Santa Claus and the true magic of Christmas.
733;This movie was written primarily for adult viewers because of the nostalgic feel, but can be enjoyed by people of all ages.
734;This is by far the best Christmas movie to watch.
735;wonderful movie full od charm and humor .
736;but you already knew that it is shown so often amazed it is actually still available .
737;It captures the joy and fear and exhilaration and disillusionment of what it was like growing up in an America of a by.
738;The movie is touching and hilarious at the same time.
739;One of the best Christmas classics I've ever seen.
740;Now that I own it I can watch any time I want.
741;This and A Wonderful Life are our two favorite Christmas movies .
742;one, a bit more through a adults eyes, and the other, through childrens eyes.
743;This is one of my favorite movies.
744;We enjoyed it as a family, and it played without any glitches.
745;It's the greatest Christmas movie ever made.
746;This film is one of the best Christmas films for anyone whose always wanted that special something for Christmas.
747;Ralphie is a boy whose hoping for the ultimate gift.
748;Though this movie has little swearing, the storyline and screenplay, along with the outrageous humoor make this a very good movie.
749;I know everyone else likes it, but I don't think it's funny or heartwarming.
750;I could watch this story 100 times and still enjoy it.
751;now i thought the movie was great and everything else was perfect i think that jean shepard was a brilliant man (thats why we just built this recreation center and named it after him) I just wish he would have did the littles things that would, for me, make the movie even better.
752;It reminds me of how I grew up!
753;It brings you back to your childhood days of Christmas.
754;This is a very good Christmas movie, but not the best.
755;This 1983 film, which takes place in the 1940's, is great!
756;This hilarious movie is a GREAT Christmas classic, and is fun for all ages.
757;Thank you for your time, and Merry Christmas!
758;This film has become a beloved holiday classic, but somehow I seem to be immune to its charms.
759;Well last night we watched it and were totally drawn into its charm.
760;"the movie does a grand job of picturing the life of a boy in that era
I:11001;761;These things made life worth living for the boy of that time.
I:11001;762;The serious turn that life would take on December 7th of the next year was still future and unknown"
763;the movie faithfully captures pictures of products that were popular during that time in the kitchen and laundry.
764;Both of these movies were major accomplishments that still have a huge following today.
765;the movie does a good job of placing the viewer in the mind of the young boy in 1940 with his dreams and fantasies about what might be awaiting him in life.
766;This movie is a fairly authentic trip down memory lane for those of us who lived our lives at that time and a glimpse of life from a boy's perspective in 1940 for those who were to be born later.
767;"i recommend the movie highly for the entire family
I:11001;768;for genuine Christmas Video Movie Classics, I recommend the Alastair Sim version of Scrooge done in the 1950's and A Wonderful Life
I:11001;769;This is a great Christmas classic.
I:11001;770;Was great to expose a little one to such a great movie.
I:11001;771;Heart warming and hilarious at the same time.
I:11001;772;As funny as I remember in the early 1980's, but digitally remastered and restored.
I:11001;773;The extra disc and the features it contains are a must for any fan.
I:11001;774;This is one of the funniest and heartwarming Christmas movies ever made!
I:11001;775;It's become a classic and a must watch during the holidays.
I:11001;776;It's as funny now many years later as when first released.
I:11001;777;It was such a wonderful step back in time to a simpler age that those of us who lived it will readily relate too and those who missed this wonderful era can come to know and appreciate it.
I:11001;778;If you have seen this then you will understand about The Lamp It is also going to broadway just gotta love it.
I:11001;779;if you don't understand about the lamp watch it and you will.
I:11001;780;Great scenes shot in Cleveland remind me of home.
I:11001;781;they made it into a musical on Broadway .
I:11001;782;This is a Christmas classic that is hilarious and great to watch during the holiday season, or any other occasion, for that matter!
I:11001;783;This movie is the best Christmas comedy ever.
I:11001;784;Excellent cast too, a classic!!
I:11001;785;Watching this movie is an annual tradition in our home.
I:11001;786;It is the most heartwarming movie and very comical.
I:11001;787;The characters are perfect and it brings back memories of more wholesome times and how things used to be.
I:11001;788;An all around excellent movie!
I:11001;789;But then got stuck watching a marathon with a friend who loved it.
I:11001;790;Now it's one of my favorite Christmas movies!
I:11001;791;This is one of the greatest Christmas movies ever made.
I:11001;792;It is funny and nostalgic and so entertaining.
I:11001;793;I recommend this for all families.
I:11001;794;I was looking forward to more insight as to the production citing humorous retake scenes, etc.
I:11001;795;A Christmas Story is my #1 favorite Christmas movie.
I:11001;796;shot Carbine Action Air Rifle BB Gun which is very popular to children.
I:11001;797;Ralphie had many hilarious situations to get his wish granted.
I:11001;798;I love this movie and I promise whenever you want to watch a Christmas film with your family, this film is perfect and a recommend.
I:11001;799;this seasonal favorite is great!
I:11001;800;If you have this edition, compare the sides with the red and black hats on the store displays and the tops of the heads on the cutomers looking in.
I:11001;801;Save your $$$ and watch it on TNT or TBS!
I:11001;802;Thank God I bought this used for far less!
I:11001;803;Jean Shepard has always been one of my favorite story tellers.
I:11001;804;This film is a Christmas Classic for all ages!
I:11001;805;Great movie for the whole family to enjoy and an interesting window into the lives of people in the late 1950s
I:11001;806;Our christmas video is one more add to our collection , the family really likes the message it portrays in it.
I:11001;807;It's a Christmas time favorite.
I:11001;808;Great movie for young and old alike.
I:11001;809;This a very funny movie.
I:11001;810;It is really good and anyone that is looking for a Christmas movie should watch.
I:11001;811;I love this movie, my kids and grandkids love this movie.
I:11001;812;It's the comfort food of holiday films.
I:11001;813;(Okay, okay, sometimes I watch it in Spring and Summer just because it lifts my spirits!)
I:11001;814;A classic tale that can be enjoyed by all generations.
I:11001;815;Saw the musicial play a days ago it was wonderful.
I:11001;816;The best Christmas tale ever .
I:11001;817;the cast is superb, the tale one all babyboomers will feel is a lot like their childhood.
I:11001;818;The kids are real, the emotions are real and funny and the late Jean Sheppard's wit ( and narration) shine in this perfect tale of a boy and his desire for a Red Rider Beebee gun and the lengths he will go to to 'help' Santa remember.
I:11001;819;i love books, and often when one is made into a movie, I prefer the book.
I:11001;820;To Kill a Mockingbird is one that I loved in both book form and movie form, and this is the other.
I:11001;821;Based on several of Sheppard's books, this is a true gem.
I:11001;822;The condition and shipping were perfect.
I:11001;823;He loved it as a gift.
I:11001;824;Have loved this movie since I first saw it on TBS when I was probably 6 or 7.
I:11001;825;It's one of those movies I'll watch anytime of the year to give me a good laugh and put me in a good mood.
I:11001;826;Sit back and remember, laugh and enjoy this one.
I:11001;827;This is great movie for just silly fun.
I:11001;828;Good for the whole family.
I:11001;829;I loved this movie from the first time I saw it.
I:11001;830;It has now become a tradition to watch each Christmas season.
I:11001;831;Loved the full screen edition.
I:11001;832;A Christmas Story is one of those classics that you feel, needs to be watched every Holiday season.
I:11001;833;I can remember watching this film a jillion times as a child and now having the opportunity to share the film with my kids.
I:11001;834;budget film at that time, what made this film become a classic is that, it's a Christmas story of an American family in the 1940's.
I:11001;835;but the magical part of this film are its characters.
I:11001;836;Every character from Ralphie's family to his friends, everything comes together quite well.
I:11001;837;But it still looks good.
I:11001;838;This commentary was actually quite fun to listen to.
I:11001;839;His relationship with working with Jean Shepard and much more.
I:11001;840;* 20th Anniversary Documentary """"Another Christmas Story"""" ."""
841;create some of those snow scenes.
842;This was an interesting featurette on the actual Daisy Red Ryder Air Rifle.
843;"for me, ""A CHRISTMAS STORY"" is like ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and even ""Home Alone""."
844;Films that are Christmas classics that you just want to watch with the family during the holidays.
845;"A CHRISTMAS STORY has been a part of so many families holiday's within the last 20 years and remains one of the classics next to ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and ""Charlie Brown Christmas"" (and other classics) shown every year and watched by many."
846;ray is a great decision.
847;overall, it's a Christmas classic worth owning.
848;He was a Ford man, and would defend his choice of car like Mc Gavin loved his Oldsmobile's.
849;Classic Christmas comedy, my kids asked if it was really that funny when we were growing up.
850;This is an excellent film.
851;The storyline and the acting is superb.
852;I recommend this movie to anyone who likes nostalgic Christmas.
853;Still brings me a smile every time I watch it.
854;It is very much hyped as one of the best Christmas films of all time and amazingly funny.
855;This is the absolute best Christmas movie.
856;You can't help but laugh, especially if you were brought up during this time frame.
857;A timeless Classic directed to survive the ages.
858;It includes a metal tin, some other goodies, and costs about $15 more.
859;The movie gets 5 stars for being a Christmas classic.
860;Bought it as a gift for my grandson.
861;He received it in good viewing shape, and loved watching it now as much as he did when he was little
862;It is a marvelous movie for children, but it is also a film that adults can enjoy and remember when.
863;It also allows a look at a time in American history that eveyone thinks of as the good old days.
864;Love the narrative aspect of the film as well.
865;I've watched this movie for so many years, it's a great movie.
866;I brought my kids up on this movie we all used to watch it together.
867;i'm going to try and watch this movie again because I really do love the movie.
868;This Christmas classic is something our family has watched for years.
869;It's just good clean family fun, sometimes hard to find that on TV.
870;One classic everyone must see at christmas at least one time a year.
871;Everyone in my family loves this movie except me.
872;Funny, Heartwarming, and a bit mischievous.
873;Reminded me of my years growing up.
874;This is the best christmas movie since other christmas movies.
875;This is a classic that everyone should see!!!
876;Wanted my grand children to see this movie.
877;I saw it when I was a little girl, great movie, did not remember a lot of what happened.
878;But all in all this is a pretty great video transfer.
879;This is a good thing.
880;It's asinine to present a widescreen image in 4:3 letterbox!
881;This movie is funny, quirky, and warm like hot chocolate.
882;A family favorite for years and years.
883;This copy was a gift for friends.
884;This has always been a Christmas tradition movie to watch for our family.
885;I've always enjoyed this movie each Christmas.
886;So many people cited this as their very favorite Christmas movie, and I'd never seen it, so I figured I should watch it.
887;it's also got the first.
888;It's almost as entertaining as listening to someone tell you about their dreams.
889;there were some amusing scenes, of course, and I even laughed aloud several times.
890;And I really enjoyed the end.
891;well, the boys did, at least.
892;A Christmas Story is a warm holiday movie filled with memorable moments and genuinely funny circumstances set in a time that has ceased to exist in America.
893;It's a simple child's tale of the all.
894;american Christmas, capturing a picture.
895;perfect portrait of holiday warmth and zest through its delectable combination of laughter and touching moments.
896;Most importantly, the film recalls the pleasures of childhood during the Christmas season, and that can provide as much joy as any other film.
897;of course, there are obstacles, made whimsical and witty by director Bob Clark's wonderful knack for situational humor.
898;be alibi, Santa Claus, who is seen in a most frightening light by the children who line up to sit on his lap.
899;the film is a very warm and inviting Christmas story, capturing the holiday season of yesteryear in an authentic and gleeful manner.
900;His father, a stern yet gentle man, is the ideal working.
901;class family man who sits at the table, reads his paper, but still exudes a great deal of caring for his family.
902;Darren McGavin's performance as Mr. Parker deserves high praise, especially in his childlike glee over winning a table lamp in the shape of a woman's leg.
903;billingsley is the most notable of these actors, instilling Ralphie with all the emotions and thoughts a normal child experiences.
904;ins with neighborhood bully Scut Farcus provides a truly satisfying scene of turning the tables, while his daydreams of getting an A+ on his English paper and his going blind from soap poisoning are filled wit merriment and humor.
905;Here is a movie that is guaranteed to bring back wonderful memories of childhood, with something that everyone from all generations can relate to, whether it be the joys of the long.
906;awaited Christmas morning, or the shared pleasure of reliving the time and place, and the painstaking accuracy with which it is portrayed.
907;It's kind of a classic.
908;A great Christmas classic that never gets old.
909;New generations of people will see this for all times and I certainly have.
910;This NEVER ages into a ho.
911;It will still be entertaining 'newcomers' seventy.
912;Mom packed my lunch and I carried it to school in a tin Superman lunch box, or a brown paper bag from the Kroger store on the corner of the block.

915;merry Christmas and Happy New Year.
916;This movie is great it reminds me when I was young, Ralphies age, and I wanted a Red Ryder BB gun.
917;I enjoy watching this classic Christmas movie every year during the holidays.
918;It always makes me laugh.
919;I read about the history of it, which makes the movie more enjoyable.
920;Kids and adults alike watch this and for adults the trip down memory lane can be just as fun as the movie!!!
921;A must see if you haven't, and a great movie to add to the holiday movie.
922;I watch it any time that it is showing on TV at Christmas time.
923;Now, I can watch it anytime, all year round!
924;my daughter loves this movie.
925;We as a family loved this movie.
926;This is a great movie to watch with your family around the Holidays.
927;It will bring back some of your own childhood memories.
928;I saw it years ago when it first came out and enjoyed it again on Blu.
929;ray,I will watch it every Christmas.
930;"there is a considerable amount of ""wobble"" in the image, as if watching a well."
931;The cast is excellent and the story is delightful.
932;It's a classic and I have loved it for years.
933;So I updated to Blu Ray, took it to their house for Christmas and introduced them to a classic.
934;Definitely something to pass on to others.
935;So often Hollywood tends to treat Christmas with such idealism that the holiday movies all begin to look the same.
936;"That's why ""A Christmas Story"" stands out so wonderfully."
937;A Chirstmas Story is fun throughout, and the characters are people we know and people we just might be.
938;This is one movie which is a standard in my household and is definitely worth adding to your Christmas movie collection.
939;I have grown up with this film, along with Willy Wonka and Home Alone.
940;If you listen closely, you'll notice the repetition.
941;Listen more closely and you can also discover some dub.
942;It's about celebrating the joy of our Lord, and loving one another.
943;Watching this movie on Blu ray is just a fantastic experience.
944;The detail is much better than what I watched on TV every year.
945;This offering is far superior than the previous release!I love this movie because it refuses to take the fun out of Christmas by being sappy.
946;I recommend that you make this part of your Christmas tradition as well, if you haven't already.
947;It brings back many of our favorite childhood memories.
948;My son now has a new favorite Christmas movie and I look forward to being able to watch it with him every year!
949;A CHRISTMAS MISSIONHere we have the ideal young boys Christmas yarn, adapted from a memoir by humorist Jean Shepherd, who narrates throughout the film.
950;We have really cool narration.
951;"there is very nice mood music mostly by Brass Ensemble, when its Christmas, and more fully orchestrated for ""The Grand Canyon Suite"" and other familiar tunes that are appropriate to the period [late 1940s in Northern urban Indiana]BOTTOM LINE:Super."
952;duper entertainment that you can enjoy with the whole family.
953;in in 1983, and I have looked forward to seeing it, dozens of times, since.
954;A Christmas Story tends to touch people's hearts like few films do.
955;and this film brings back the nostalgia of their 1950's childhood, and it strikes a nerve.
956;no matter, it will touch you (but even more if you are over 50).
957;though it seems like lifetimes ago:New and beautiful toys displayed in department store windows.
958;An unwanted gift from a well.
959;It's warm, funny, poignant and relatable without stretching itself thin and effortlessly captures the dueling heartaches and wonders that embodied the holiday season for many generations of American children.
960;paced plot delivers both rose sniffing and speed racing with grand efficiency.
961;It is one of the most hilarious portrayals of Christmas on film, and will have you laughing at every turn.
962;watch it with the family.
963;Celebrate our strange traditions in the best fashion.
964;This is my all time favorite Christmas movie.
965;I know the entire thing by heart and make my family mad by reciting all the lines everytime i watch it.
966;Even the book (In God We Trust: All Others Pay Cash) is great!
967;I highly recomend this movie to all ages, for all times of the year.
968;Let's watch A Christmas Story!
969;An endearing Christmas Classic that will appeal to baby boomers and all ages alike.
970;The performances (one of Darrin McGavin's best), costumes, set docorations and the dialog (mostly narrated from POV of a young boy) are superb for such a low budget movie.
971;Watch it with your children, friends and relatives regardless of age, and have a very MERRY Christmas!!!
972;It was nice to watch it during the holidays when I had time instead of trying to catch it on TV.
973;The special features that have the cast commenting on the movie are almost as good as the movie itself.
974;This is a movie you can watch dozens of times and still laugh.
975;This is a Christmas movie that can be viewed repeatedly.
976;We watched it with our childen and now watch with our granchild.
977;The story is funny and keeps you interested.
978;Give his movie a try.
979;See if you laugh and recognise yourself in it.
980;Yea, you will probably be able to catch it on TV around Christmas, but me .
981;especially since I will be deployed at Christmas this year.
982;Chock full of hilarious scenes with an occasional voice over that takes me back to old TV classics.
983;It is a classic movie for Xmas
984;This 1983 classic is not just a heartwarming little story about a loving (if bickery) family in the dour America of the late 1940s, but a hysterical comedy about what it's like to be a kid at Christmas.
985;ralphie Parker's (Peter Billingsley) Christmas wishes are simple: a official Red Ryder, carbine action, two.
986;"hundred shot range model air rifle with a compass and a ""thing that tells time."""
987;So Ralphie begins a quiet crusade to get it as a present .
988;But there are surprises in store for the Parker family on Christmas morning .
989;and some of them involve smelly bloodhounds.Yes, the plot is pretty simple .
990;it's the delivery that makes it special.
991;And it's completely tuned in to how kids think, and how a toy can seem like the most important thing in the world.
992;deserves especial credit for bringing this movie to life.
993;He covers the movie with a snowstorm of one.
994;billingsley is a little stiff as Ralphie, but gives the portrayal of this everykid his charming, slightly frenetic best.
995;But now it's one of the quintessential holiday movies, and a must.
996;One of the best Holidays movies ever made.
997;The casting for this movie was spot on and the acting was superb along with the storyline.
998;I received it in a timely order and in one piece.
999;I am very happy with the Christmas story!
1000;at that age and he does NOT like to be reminded of the fact!
1001;A major part of the charm of the film is the fact that it takes place in the 1940's, when charm was still in vogue and simplicity dominated the times.
1002;My favorite scene involved him and Ralphie changing the tire.
1003;on all counts, this is a gem of a picture, with marvelous performances, directing and writing.
1004;Almost every scene is memorable and can be bantered about over the holiday table.
1005;Even if you don't laugh out loud after the 100th viewing, it is still as entertaining and fresh as it is with the 1st.
1006;Classic movie that will be around for decades and decades and decades and decades and decades and decades and decades.
1007;We always laugh so much while watching it.
1008;It is such a wonderful story for the family to watch together.
1009;I showed it to a class of English language learners.
1010;It is very American, and my classes liked it despite having to stop occasionally for explanations.
1011;It was a good intro to American holidays
1012;I love the Christmas Story silver anniversary box set.
1013;I feel the content of the discs should be the same, as a measure to preserve this holiday classic.
1014;other than that, I love the new content provided.
1015;The canister the box set comes in is awesome.
1016;The red apron and cookie cutter set are truly great.
1017;The book that lists the cast and crew is very informative.
1018;One for enjoyment, and the other for future value.
1019;All these changes in the world, but the old saying is true.
1020;when a memory is so powerfully branded onto a person's soul, it makes for a timeless retelling.
1021;This story provides just such a gift.
1022;Not only a great Christmas movie but a great movie.
1023;great writing and narration by the late great writer,commentator and comic genius Jean Sheperd.
1024;I never get tired of watching it and it looks great on blu ray.
1025;One of the best Christmas movies ever made.
1026;Brings you back to a simpler time when the biggest discipline problems in schools were running in the hallways and chewing gum in class.
1027;this movie inspires and makes you feel as though you're home.
1028;have loved for over 20 years now.
1029;If you haven't seen it, this movie may bring back memories of your own childhood and that one special gift you wanted Santa to bring you.
1030;It takes place in a time before my own, but is still relevant even today.
1031;I remember going to see this movie in the theater when I was small.
1032;I loved it and still do!!
1033;It's hilarious and really a true classic.
1034;My sons (10, 8, 4) love it as well.
1035;A Christmas Story (1983) is as perfect a holiday movie as was ever produced in Hollywood.
1036;I applaud this Special Edition to be released, which provides the first.
1037;If ever a Christmas movie deserved special treatment, it is this film.
1038;the movie is absolutely unique: a non.
1039;rate holiday movie, but a classic first.
1040;deserved kudos should go to Director Robert Clark III.
1041;This year, Ralph has been waging a campaign to receive the greatest Christmas present in the history of Christmas presents: a Red Ryder BB gun, with a compass in the stock.
1042;it is against this backdrop that we meet Ralph's family, his mother and father (whose first names we never learn), and younger brother Randy, along with a host of Ralph's friends and his school teacher.
1043;through the Parker family, we are privy to the weeks leading up to Christmas, and the grand day itself.
1044;The movie has the power to change the way you look at Christmas, and Christmas films forever.
1045;"For me, it has become a yearly mainstay, as moving and memorable as ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" or any other holiday film."
1046;"It is my Red Ryder BB gun, ""the best Christmas present I ever received, or would ever receive."""
1047;"First of all, this is, aside from Dickens' classic ""A Christmas Carol,"" the best Christmas movie ever made."
1048;It is the kind of movie that will be immortalized throughout time.
1049;The interviews are pretty decent on the 2nd disc, and the interactive games are fun.
1050;"I said ""okay, well at least it's in 2."
1051;Great Christmas movie and gift.
1052;A enjoyable trip back into the past.
1053;A new Christmas entertainment trip in the future with family and friends.
1054;It is a family classic and makes us laugh throughout the movie.
1055;My husband and I grew up during the time Ralphie did so it is even more real for us.
1056;This is a wonderful gift to give to Christmas Story fans.
1057;I should have bought myself one.
1058;And delivery was prompt and packaged great.
1059;Classic christmas movie in beautiful blu ray picture.
1060;Bought to play at work and everyone loves it.
1061;This (and National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation) is *the* classic Christmas movie.
1062;It perfectly captures the anticipation leading up to getting the right gift as well as all normal craziness ocurring in a family.
1063;It's a classic Christmas movie that continues to make people laugh for generations to come.
1064;We ordered it and received it quickly and we love Amazon for all our movies they have great prices.
1065;Classic, funny, and all around great movie.
1066;This has to be the best Christmas comedy filmed so far.
1067;a classic christmas gift for sure!
1068;I watch it at least twice a year.
1069;ti will bring back many memories.
1070;it is great i can just point and click and have a movie ready for me.
1071;This is a great family film to watch with my family, friends and grand children, and I'm sure to enjoy it in many years to come.
1072;This is one of the best movies ever made but this is a rip off.
1073;I really believe when the history of the movie industry is finally completed, four movies will be tied for best Christmas movie.
1074;"They will be
I:11001;1075;Christmas Story is my personal favorite of the four.
I:11001;1076;The true wonder of this movie is how vividly it brings back memories of early youth, no matter when you were born.
I:11001;1077;give full credit to Jean Shepherd.
I:11001;1078;The measure of the success of this movie is the faithfulness in which it brings his characters and stories to life.
I:11001;1079;His narrative in voice over is one of the highlights of the film.
I:11001;1080;The wonderful combination of sentiment and satire sparkles through the show like bubbles in a glass of ginger ale.
I:11001;1081;It's a classic and you need it in your collection.
I:11001;1082;this version, the twentieth anniversary, double disc special edition is exceptionally good.
I:11001;1083;After viewing the movie, go back and view it with the commentary by Bob Clarke and Peter Billingsley.
I:11001;1084;That alone is worth the price of the set.
I:11001;1085;There's also a whole extra special feature disk with goodies for the whole family.
I:11001;1086;There are also some nice interactive games for the kids, but the biggest treat on the second disk is the audio readings by Jean Shepherd of two of the stories from which the movies were made.
I:11001;1087;He will hold you spellbound in front of the image of an old radio.
I:11001;1088;I always enjoyed this movie from the very first time I watched it as a teenager.
I:11001;1089;The value of the story and the impression that this movie made on me at that time have stayed with me since.
I:11001;1090;I love the movie, love the story and recommend this to anyone who might be on the fence.
I:11001;1091;We love this crazy Christmas movie.
I:11001;1092;It was so much easier to view and enjoy in the blu ray version.
I:11001;1093;Another great Christmas movie, one of my favorites.
I:11001;1094;Shipped the same day ordered and arrrived before Christmas.
I:11001;1095;A wonderful and fun tale for the whole family.
I:11001;1096;It was good, not spectacular, but good.
I:11001;1097;The actors were good and it was interesting to get a glimpse into life in the 40s.
I:11001;1098;Well, by now everyone has at least heard of this movie, but to sum up why it's such a classic: it's timeless.
I:11001;1099;Sure, the setting and the props could change to modernize it, but in the end this is a kids' eye view of life, particularly the Christmas season.
I:11001;1100;A great film for any age!
I:11001;1101;It's great fun with lots of laughs and moments of looking back to my own childhood and the anticipation of a particular christmas gift from santa claus.
I:11001;1102;All of them range from the greatest to the worst, and A Christmas Story is one of the greatest.
I:11001;1103;It's both hilarious and touching at the same time.
I:11001;1104;Along with It's a Wonderful Life and Home Alone, every single minute of this film is almost flawless.
I:11001;1105;I think my favorite scenes are the ones involving soap and lamps . . . I won't give out any spoilers for those who haven't seen it yet.
I:11001;1106;Speaking of which, if you haven't seen this Christmas classic just yet, give it a shot, especially on Christmas Eve.
I:11001;1107;You'll quickly understand why it's considered one of the greatest Christmas films of all time.
I:11001;1108;This is fun for all ages but I think those a little older will really get it.
I:11001;1109;thank you Darren McGavin for giving us the best Christmas Present ever!
I:11001;1110;A must watch during the Christmas season.
I:11001;1111;I love """"A Christmas Story,"""" and I would give the film a 5."""
1112;This has so much of what we want our kids and young adults to see and learn about.
1113;A Christmas Story is such a classic Christmas Story.
1114;It is funny, silly, and an All.
1115;It is definitely a keeper!
1116;You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll want Chinese food .
1117;This movie is a classic, although people play it too much on TBS, but anyway it is a great film and I love it.
1118;You will laugh at some points and other points you will be saying to yourself, What the.
1119;It's good, so take a look at it.
1120;He must somehow get his teacher to sympathise with his plot too, with a theme for homework, and maybe a little bribe here and there.
1121;All these things may lead to Mayhem, but they sure do make a funny story when it comes to getting gifts.
1122;I recommend this movie to anyone, but I also recommend the book, In God We Trust, All others pay cash by Jean Shepard.
1123;This movie is one of my favorite Christmas movies ever.
1124;I ordered the package in December and was happy to get it in time and in great conditon.
1125;One of our family's great traditions on a cold December night.
1126;Fills the house with laughter and warmth.
1127;Watching this every year is a great Christmas tradition.
1128;Though sometimes a bit quaint and sometimes requiring some patience, this movie is at times hilarious!
1129;natured schemer, while the dad is an eccentric buffoon!
1130;A Christmas Story is not only the greatest Christmas film ever made, it is one of the greatest films ever made, period!
1131;This is a perfect film!
1132;"Darren McGavin as ""the old man"" gives of the greatest performances not to be nominated for an Oscar."
1133;Melinda Dillon is just great as the mom.
1134;Peter Billingsley is perfect as Ralphie.
1135;Every single character is memorable, how often is that.
1136;fact the whole film is quotable!
1137;The film looks just right and feels just right!
1138;An essential film that everyone sould see!
1139;I love this movie and all the cool geeky stuff that came with it as a great bonus.
1140;The time line may have been set before I was born, but the story line holds true for all people no matter what they ever wanted for Christmas.
1141;This movie is good natured, sweet and funny all the way though.
1142;I bought this for my wife.
1143;This her favorite Christmas movie.
1144;I am happy it is now offered on Blu ray.

I:11001;1152;one for the whole family that can be watched many times.

I:11001;1154;Great great, great, great, great movie, needs to buffer more so not so choppy.
I:11001;1155;While not politically correct in this day of sexual harassment awareness, it brought back great memories of watching this movie for the first time.

I:11001;1157;wWII America still in their humor innocence with perfection.

I:11001;1167;This is such a fun story.
I:11001;1168;Always a huge family favorite.
I:11001;1169;Every Christmas this film always played non.
I:11001;1170;But Jean Shepard delightfully narrates the story during the 40's and it's about a boy named Ralphie(Peter Billingsley) who desperatly wants a Red Ryder BB gun for Christmas.
I:11001;1171;I like the characters very much including Ralphie's dad who loves his prize from a radio contest: a sexy leg lamp.
I:11001;1172;One of my favorite scenes is during Ralphie and his brother visit a department store Santa and bawks the same mantra: """"You'll shoot your eye out"""" and hits Ralphie's head and says, """"Ho, Ho, Ho."""""""
1173;He does and it's hilarious!
1174;This film is sweet in alot of ways, it gives us a sense of realiom as well as warm humanity.
1175;Billingsley is great by the way who presents us with fun skill.
1176;So everyone drink egg nog, open your presents and watch this hoilday classic with your family on Christmas day.

1181;For those that grew up anywhere near this time this movie always brings back memories!
1182;Glad I finally added it to my collection.
1183;super 35 is used in titles like American Beauty, 8 Mile, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, The Matrix and the Lord of the Rings trilogy.
1184;true letterbox movies use an anamorphic process that compresses the image by using a special lens on the camera to compress the image as it strikes the unexposed film.
1185;com, which gives great information on probably any title you are curious about.
1186;I watch this movie each and every Christmas on TV, and love it the past few years when a station has it on for the 24 hours started mid.
1187;the acting and storylines are superb.
1188;I love the part where the boy gets his tounge stuck and when Ralphie's little brother keeps hiding under the sink.

1191;All generations will love this movie.

1196;I watched this again this Christmas with my kids and it was better than ever.
1197;There is NOTHING appealing about this movie and I strongly recommend you watch a blank screen instead.
1198;This movie takes you back to old time memories of the Christmas Season.
1199;This is an iconic Christmas film.
1200;I love to introduce it to someone who has never seen it at Christmastime.

I:11001;1215;This is easily, hands down, one of my all time favorite Christmas movies.
I:11001;1216;Watch it every year for Christmas.
I:11001;1217;Its a story about a family from a kids perspective when all he really wanted was 1 simple gift, and his quest to get there.
I:11001;1218;The writing is great, and its just a fun movie to watch.
I:11001;1219;Even if you did not grow up in the era, you will find yourself remembering """"that one"""" Christmas gift you had to have."""
1220;For me it was a toy sewing machine.
1221;I rarely give anything 5 stars, but this movie deserves it.
1222;This is one of the exceptionally rare timeless classics that you can watch year after year and still laugh yourself to tears every time.
1223;I laugh when I'm an adult because.
1224;The acting is so good that I sometimes have to remind myself that the kids in the movie haven't died of old age yet because the plot takes place in the 1940s.
1225;Its just a great family movie, its funny and it just one of those to do movies for the season, like White Christmas and Its a Wonderful life.
1226;I love this move one of My most watched special Christmas movie and should be on every Christmas shelf.
1227;ray transfer is spectacular and looks great for such a old movie.
1228;The next day I went to work and one of my fellow workers comes up and asks if I saw it.
1229;Reminded me of when I was a kid!
1230;And the guy who played the father looks just like my Dad!
1231;A real tank of a car!
1232;Very simliar to the car in the film.
1233;And to top it off Ralphie looks like me when I was eight!
1234;My kids liked it too.
1235;Charming movie with lots of memories of how things used to be, for someone born in 60's like me.
1236;My family and I ordered A Christmas Story because it's a tradition to watch it Christmas Eve and Day each year.
1237;I watch this movie over and over between Thanksgiving and Christmas and it gets me in the holiday spirit.
1238;A Christmas classic that everyone should own.
1239;I love this movie it's a great holiday classic that I look forward to watching every Christmas and if I simply can't wait that long (which is every year) I just pop in the movie and watch it any time I want.
1240;They love it as much as I do.
1241;Its a great movie, I know it's not It's a Wonderful Life, or Miracle on 34th ST, but it's a great Christmas movie just the same.
1242;It's a great movie for the whole family to watch together.
1243;"i love the funny little scenes like the ""Triple Dog Dare"" and when the icecicle knocks Ralphie's glasses off and he thinks he really did shoot his eye out like everone told him he would do."
1244;yet he still has his heart set on getting one that he does everything he can to get one.
1245;Like some kids, he just had to learn the hard way and gave us a good laugh in the process.
1246;i would recomend this movie to anyone that likes a good humerous, yet sweet Christmas movie.
1247;Definitely took me back to the time of my childhood memories during Christmas time.
1248;Good addition to your collection of Christmas movies.
1249;This movie has become a classic and it deserves to be .
1250;especially for those of us who grew up in the 40's and 50's and remember a simpler time.
1251;Great laughs and great memories.

1257;It is still a very funny movie!!
1258;Along with National Lampoons Christmas vacation, this movie is a holiday classic we watch every year.
1259;it's a flight of fancy, incredibly funny, and a movie with which anyone who was ever a little boy can identify.
1260;Definitely one of those movies that needs to be pulled out and viewed every Christmas along with classics like It's a Wonderful Life .
1261;A great show that unlike most of its era only get better over the years.
1262;A very good Christmas story through the eyes of a child living in 1940's Indiana.
1263;cutesy adult voice narrating most of the movie.
1264;This movie speaks for itself and is always a movie to look forward in watching at Christmas.
1265;"Read on:This is ""liquid literature"", i. e., literature on film."
1266;overs are not only used properly, but are motivated by the film's style, disposition, and character.
1267;This film is worthy of a complete digital remastering, both visually and aurally, and released in widescreen.
1268;I'd gladly pay a special price for such a classic edition of this timeless treat.
1269;"Let's see a ""Special Edition"" that remasters this genius in widescreen with all the special features and goodies and technical consideraions properly implemented!"
1270;This is really a wonderful work, one that actually grows funnier every time you see it.
1271;It's just an extraordinarily well made film.
1272;Every performance is wonderful, from Peter Billingsley to Darren McGavin to Melinda Dillon.
1273;it's hard to believe that Bob Clark, the man responsible for the raunchy, sleazy Porky's films and the wretched Baby Geniuses film, directed this film, but he did a wonderful job.
1274;And, of course, the source material by Jean Sheperd is so wonderful, which always help immensely.
1275;This is a wonderful film that can be seen at any time.
1276;It's definitely an all time classic.
1277;I've seen it a million times and yet it still makes me laugh.
1278;Every Christmas I look forward to seeing it on tv.
1279;ralphie (Peter Billingsley) wants, more than anything, to own an official Red Rider BB gun.
1280;Alas, our movie has a happy ending and it is a Christmas Ralphie will never forget.
1281;this is a great family movie.
1282;It's a really great movie for all ages.
1283;So if you haven't seen A Christmas Story, may I suggest you check it out and I'm sure it will be a Christmas family tradition for a long time to come.
1284;Story is great with some funny moments, and hidden messages about behavior of people during holiday season.
1285;best memories of the innocence of youth, family and traditions.
1286;"A Christmas Story recounts the various misadventures of a young boy on a quest for Santa to bring him the best Christmas present ever, while trying to stay out of trouble, staying out of the way of the neighborhood bully, and avoiding the consequences of ""triple dog dares."
1287;Shepherd's vivid narration is one of the defining elements of this movie.
1288;This movie will entertain the kids and remind adults of their own childhood Christmas stories.
1289;Overall, A Christmas Story is a great movie to share with the family.
1290;"Not ours
I:11001;1291;Throughout, Ralphie is plotting ways to still get the gift of his dreams, the Red Ryder.
I:11001;1292;part of the charm of this film is the narration of Ralphie as an adult looking back on part of his childhood, but it also has many universal themes that are so common to kids, no matter what era.
I:11001;1293;all these are presented in an entertaining fashion that still causes us to think, Yeah, I remember that.
I:11001;1294;This is a wonderful piece of silly escapist nonsense that all members of the family can truly enjoy.
I:11001;1295;Ordered Friday morning, and had it by Saturday morning!
I:11001;1296;It is now a tradition we will watch """"A Christmas Story"""" and """"It's A Wonderful Life"""" every holiday season."""
1297;These are the best holiday movies :)
1298;enjoy this good flick with your family, it doesn't have any double meaning jokes and is truly a G movie
1299;how can you possibly recommend that our children watch and subsequently enjoy the R. rated Roger and Me but thoroughly trash this wonderful movie?
1300;CHILL OUT!Now, on to the main attraction: this is one gem of a Christmas.
1301;Perfectly cast and acted, beautifully filmed and expertly representing the 1940's of the Midwest, Jean Shepherd's wonderfully comedic remembrances of his early Christmas experiences really come to life on the big screen.
1302;Darren McGavin and Melinda Dillon are absolutely perfectly cast as the typical 40's Mom and Dad.
1303;They're spousal jousting is hilarious and a wonder to behold, yet may ring very true with our own memories of dear old Mom and Dad, while Peter Billingsly and Ian Petrella fit together really nicely as the combative/frustrated/competitive siblings.
1304;"It's all here, told in funny, touching and often hilarious ways
I:11001;1305;This fine film will conjure up those wonderful memories of Christmas when we were kids, no matter what the generation or the decade.
I:11001;1306;The cheerful, hopeful glee that all children have when it comes to Christmas.
I:11001;1307;time is so beautifully and hilariously represented here that you will still be enjoying your favorite moments long after the final credits have run.
I:11001;1308;Watch it with your kids later this year as Christmas 2000 draws near, and as with so many other families, you'll have a new family tradition by next Christmas.
I:11001;1309;watching this glorious film once again!
I:11001;1310;There is the Christmas depicted in those gorgeously photographed magazines and books.
I:11001;1311;And there is the Christmas depicted in A Christmas Story.
I:11001;1312;This is the Christmas that went awry that will always live in your heart as the one with the grin attached.
I:11001;1313;You'll love it, you'll watch it every year.
I:11001;1314;The cast is perfect, the story is real.
I:11001;1315;I can always count on finding items I want on Amazon.
I:11001;1316;Thanks to them for making an older couple's shopping easier.
I:11001;1317;I relate to the older brother, the star, in this movie.
I:11001;1318;This movie brings back happy moments from my childhood and it just makes me laugh and laugh.
I:11001;1319;My family loves the movie also.
I:11001;1320;this wonderful film so reminds me of our family's Christmas long since past.
I:11001;1321;This movie is great and I love watching it over and over again.
I:11001;1322;actors Melinda Dillon, Darren McGavin and Peter Billingsley are great for this story of what a boy wants for Christmas.
I:11001;1323;A great family film and I highly recommend.
I:11001;1324;This is a great movie, the whole family watched it Christmas Eve.
I:11001;1325;I have always liked this film since I saw it when I was in 6th grade.
I:11001;1326;sENSE!IN A NUTSHELL:Here we have the ideal young boys Christmas yarn, adapted from a memoir by humorist Jean Shepherd, who narrates throughout the film.
I:11001;1327;We have really cool narration.
I:11001;1328;there is very nice mood music mostly by Brass Ensemble, when its Christmas, and more fully orchestrated for """"The Grand Canyon Suite"""" and other familiar tunes that are appropriate to the period [late 1940s in Northern urban Indiana]BOTTOM LINE:Super."""
1329;duper entertainment that you can enjoy with the whole family.
1330;in in 1983, and I have looked forward to seeing it, dozens of times, since.
1331;She loves it and will watch it even in the middle of summer.
1332;This movie is one of the best of all time.
1333;It is a Christmas tradition in our family, and brings back all the nostalgia of childhood in every aspect.
1334;I challenge you to make it to the end without laughing or crying!
1335;Great movie and a must have for your holiday movie collection.
1336;It's right up there with Miracle on 34th Street and National Lampoons Christmas Vacation .
1337;She thought my fanatic insistance that everyone on earth had seen the movie and loved it was a mild exaggeration .
1338;So don't imagine your duty is finished once you've seen the movie and enjoyed it.
1339;There will not be peace on earth until everyone has experienced this masterpiece of Holiday cinema.
1340;What a great deal on this modern classic!
1341;Showed to the kids for the first time and they loved it.
1342;Thought it might be too dated for them but they still appreciated the story and the humor.
1343;With respect to those who adore this movie and speaking as a mom who picked it for little kids .
1344;it was a nice movie, but not one I'd put on the list with It's a Wonderful Life.
1345;TBS has pretty much made a Christmas Eve tradition of watching A Christmas Story.
1346;Now that we are strictly streamers, we can still keep the tradition alive.
1347;For less than 2 bucks, we were able to stream the movie, not for 24 hours, but 48!
1348;Bought this movie as a gift for a family.
1349;Timeless movie that can be shared with generations to come.
1350;A great story about a kid who wants something very specific.
1351;As a result viewing this classic is more of a pleasure and delight than ever.
1352;I am very grateful for the fine technical job that Warner Brothers did on this release.
1353;This movie is funny no matter how many times I watch it.
1354;Every time I watch it as well, I always discover something new.
1355;This is such a classic.
1356;SO I got it as a gag gift.
1357;The film does a fabulous job of capturing Indiana life in that era .
1358;I enjoy it now, as an adult because, when I watch it, I can hear my dad laughing at some of the scenarios presented in the film.
1359;Although the movie was not filmed in Hammond the houses and look of the film is very authentic.
1360;One of Toronto's trademark red trolleys can be seen driving by the shot of the outside of the tree lot.
1361;ray format and it is amazingly clear!
1362;There is also some nice footage of what the main characters look like as adults and the impact that being in this film has had on their lives.
1363;Fun movie and one that brings back all the memories.
1364;A family tradition to watch this film every year.
1365;This movie is great for baby boomers or just about anyone.
1366;It deals with universal themes such as growing up, sibling positioning, bullies and dealing with them, belief in Santa, coming of age, honesty, responding to dares .
1367;I is becoming traditional for us to view this movie every Christmas.
1368;Love the fact that I can now stream it.
1369;think again, this movie is able to go compare to the classics and it is indeed one of them.
1370;The translation in spanish is so perfect that it helps me put some of the description in a proper context when I see it in english.
1371;the setting, the acting, the production and the story is mastefully orchestrated creating indeleble scenes that will always live in our memories.
1372;My son and I have always a good time remembering the scenes and the expressions from this movie, that I sure it will stregthen your codes and memories with your loved ones as well.
1373;west we can appreciate how well this scene fits in the overall setting of the movie.
1374;i will give anything away, for many reviewers have done that and each of us have a favorite scene.
1375;if your kids are too small I am not sure it will be appreciated, this is a tale told by the narrator (who is remebering his childhood) in a very erudite manner, which is also part of what makes it enjoyable since it constrast with the simplicity of the kid, we can appreciate that but a small kid.
1376;i have laughed very much reading other reviewers comments that this forum has indeed made the movie more enjoyable, specially the comments made to that reviewer who only gave it a 1 star!!
1377;the BB gun theme was perfect to hang all the excitement of the season on.
1378;i know because i had the same wish over 60 years ago when my family moved from the city to a dairy farm in wisconsin and got a Red Ryder that first christmas.
1379;sure to please during the holiday season.
1380;Fun facts and interviews from the cast in the second disc were worth while.
1381;I have an earlier version of the movie and received this one as a stocking stuffer this year.
1382;If you already have the movie without the extras, you will still need this two.
1383;it is one of our holiday traditions.
1384;For a Christmas treat, my seventh grade teacher played this for our class and it was the fist time I ever watched it.
1385;It's basically about this little boy with glasses, imaginative scenarios, funny commentary, and the hope of a new BB gun for Christmas.
1386;I thought the story was pretty good, and the family and the mini.
1387;adventures they get into are hilarious.
1388;This is a great movie for people of all ages, even though this movie took place many years ago, 1940's setting, I think kids will enjoy this.
1389;The tale of any child's Christmas dreams is universal.
1390;What a clever little tale!
1391;The narration is really comical, and al the actors do a terrific job.
1392;What can you say, it's a classic.
1393;Summary: This is the story of Ralphie Parker and his season.
1394;Although it is realistically a generational movie for the children of the baby boomers, its charm carries on through the generations.
1395;but it's a nice group of holiday memories, and through the casting and directing of this movie,we are brought into a wonderful film of nostalgia that the whole family can enjoy.
1396;This is one of the nicest and funniest Christmas movies I have every seen.
1397;With all of the fondness I've read for this movie I was surprised that it's mainly an American thing.
1398;It made me laugh quite a lot, but mainly in the second half.
1399;The cosy Xmas atmosphere is lovely, and there's not a shred of anything unwholesome.
1400;There are plenty of decent extras too.
1401;This is a classic, Everyone should see I watch it every Christmas with my family, it is always a fun time.
1402;Good for the whole family.
1403;It's a good laugh which is what we need this hectic time of year.
1404;Since I was a boy about the time this movie takes place, I can really relate to this kid.
1405;It is a fun Christmas movie!
1406;The box is made of metal and the art work on it is nice, in a goofy sort of way.
1407;"It is to me one of the best Christmas stories of the 20th century, rivaling ""White Christmas"", ""The Miracle on 34th Street"" and even ""It's a Wonderful Life""."
1408;It is in a class all to itself and is worth watching over and over.
1409;McGavin has been a favorite actor of mine since the KOLCHAK TV series.
1410;the Parker family is a quirky but loveable bunch.
1411;"Ralphie is the older son and Randy is the ""baby"" of the family."
1412;this Christmas season, Ralphie is obsessed with getting a Red Ryder B. b. gun from Santa and it is his goal to make it happen.
1413;here is a very sweet return to a kinder and gentler time when Christmas was a magical event filled with Santa Claus and holiday cheer.
1414;"60's might relate to these special Christmases involving Santa at the Department Store and finding the ""perfect"" live Christmas tree."
1415;The old man comes across as a bit of a curmudgeon but underneath he is a softie who loves his wife and sons.
1416;Mother was the glue that held everyone together and she could soothe both husband and sons.
1417;The Parkers were a more realistic version of the perfect family.
1418;this film is filled with so many memorable moments.
1419;Maybe the Chinese staff trying to sing FLA LA LA LA LA becoming fra ra ra ra ra would be politically incorrect today but there is a sweetness to the scene.
1420;a CHRISTMAS STORY is so sweet and so gentle on so many levels.
1421;Haven't seen it in years, but loved watching it on the widescreen.
1422;I was afraid it would be really grainy, but it's pretty good.
1423;The disk includes some special features too.
1424;Everyone has probably seen it and most everyone loves it.
1425;it's lots of fun and so much of it rings true with anyone who has gone through all the twists and turns of childhood.
1426;I watch A Christmas Story on X. mas Eve and X. mas day.
1427;Ralphie was my favorite in a X. mas Story.
1428;A classic movie that shows Christmas in a Golden Age.
1429;Such a great Christmas classic.
1430;A new family tradition is watching this movie.
1431;This is excellent, glad I bought it.
1432;A great addition to our holiday library.
1433;I have really enjoyed watching this many times this season.
1434;It is great for the whole family and arrived in good condtion.
1435;ray disc is a real treat that preserves this holiday gem in all its nostalgic glory.
1436;I always loved the movie and I'm so happy to now have it on Blue Ray where my family can have a more vivid viewing.
1437;The story is great in every way!!
1438;My whole family from 82 to 9 years of age agree.
1439;the mom and dad roles are as I remember much of my childhood, as well.
1440;and I love every moment of it and never tire of watching it.
1441;Ordered it and it arrived in a timely fashion.
1442;The BB gun as would be expected was his favorite gift.
1443;The family gets together each Christmas to watch this classic film.
1444;The comedy gets better each year!
1445;A Christmas Story is the BEST Christmas comedy with a message to tell EVER made Second only to National Lampon's Christmas Vacation !!
1446;Crazy very funny movie for those enjoying their memories of a more secular Christmas!
1447;The whole family gets to enjoy this every year.
1448;I have always fhought about my own childhood while viewing this movie.
1449;I did what what I thought best to those masked muraders and Black Bart.
1450;Good thing I had Old Blue to help with that chore.
1451;great movie a classic everybody should own a copie of movie and watch it with their family around christmas time .
1452;A great cast, all thechildren did brilliant acting.
1453;spirited and after awhile pretty bland.
1454;Stick with It's a Wonderful Life for your Christmas viewing pleasures.
1455;So funny and I love it!!!
1456;Gene Shepherd was a sublimely funny story teller and his talent lives on in the movie version of his wonderful musings.
1457;I'd give this movie a hundred stars if I could!
1458;not the beaver cleaver perfect family.
1459;"They are real
I:11001;1460;This is one of our favorite videos.
I:11001;1461;Told by a master story teller.
I:11001;1462;Just good clean fun for all the family.
I:11001;1463;We have loved this movie for years.
I:11001;1464;We now own it and will be able to watch it any time we want.
I:11001;1465;It is a great addition to our Christmas movie collection.
I:11001;1466;It's a heartwarming story for all ages.
I:11001;1467;I liked this movie because it reminds me of when I was at that age and wanting a special present (Chrisy Doll) for Christmas.
I:11001;1468;One of the best Christmas Films of all time.
I:11001;1469;This classic makes for memories.
I:11001;1470;leg lamp, and the neighborhood spectacle it created?
I:11001;1471;see movie for any Christmas fan.
I:11001;1472;A cult classic for sure, seeing this film was a rite of passage for me and my friends when we were younger.
I:11001;1473;Great movie for a family holiday movie night.
I:11001;1474;Full of laughs and life lessons, good for all ages to see.
I:11001;1475;One of the best Christmas films ever and a greaft film in its own right.
I:11001;1476;There is no doubt that this is the best Christmas movie to ever make it to the big screen.
I:11001;1477;All of te nostalgic elements combine to make a truly wonderful experience.
I:11001;1478;This one has all the classic nostalgia around Christmas accompanied by clever narration.
I:11001;1479;A must see for a old time holiday feel with some great laughs.
I:11001;1480;my sister and I were delighted to share it with her children (ages 12, 14 and 15).
I:11001;1481;A lot of holiday fun.
I:11001;1482;I should have carefully reviewed the movie before watching it with kids, kudos to you for doing just that!
I:11001;1483;It just has such a wholesome yet hilarious quailty surrounding it.
I:11001;1484;The characters fit their roles so well.
I:11001;1485;I think Darren Mcgavin plays one of the funniest most memorable characters in the history of cinema.
I:11001;1486;Aside from """"A Christmas Carol,"""" this is probably the best and well."""
1487;liked Christmas movie out there.
1488;An enjoyable treat for young and old!
1489;It is the best of the best for Christmas and great all through the entire year.
1490;Would recommend it to anyone.
1491;not home watching movies while putting up tree with the family.
1492;I have to watch it every year, if I can.
1493;I first saw this film with a friend at the age of 14.
1494;All of us enjoyed this movie.
1495;Every year we catch part of it on television and we all laugh like we've never seen it before.
1496;It's right up there with all of the other Christmas classics!
1497;Melinda Dillon plays a great mother and Darren McGavin does a wonderful job as the dad.
1498;Watching this has become a tradition for my family.
1499;Fun movie to watch (the Old Man is still dealing with the blasted furnace) and has a great surprise ending, but as usual, the original is better than the first.
1500;It's set after the original 'A Christmas Story' and can be a fun diversion.
1501;"I recommend this double edition set, plus ""My Summer Story."""
1502;For all Peter Billingsley fans, he is also a producer and director as well as an actor now.
1503;He played the elf checking on how many Etch.
1504;It brings back happy memories of the first year I saw it when my son was 8 years old.
1505;Good, wholesome entertainment for the entire family.
1506;Ralphie's quest for a shotgun is hilarious and his father is a hoot.
1507;It is a fun Christmastime favorite!
1508;The film actually has a lot of satire.
1509;The extra features are nice, but not the focus.
1510;For anyone looking for some classic holiday enjoyment, A Christmas Story is the epitomy of the traditional Christmas.
1511;anytime one is in the mood for some good family entertainment A Christmas Story delivers the humor, realism, and trials of a classic Xmas tale.
1512;This is a timeless depiction of a kid's ultimately fulfilled wish for that special gift at Christmas.
1513;Several of the scenes such as the unplanned Christmas dinner at the Chinese restaurant are belly aching, tear producing fun.
1514;Come on Jamie, loosen up and enjoy!
1515;I have always loved this movie and I just ordered one from Amazon to replaced a lost copy so I don't have to wait for it to come on TV.
1516;Still, that's how real life is.
1517;ralphie represents the childhood experiences most of us have had.
1518;What a great teaching tool for the typical american boy.
1519;Thank you mom and dad!
1520;A must see for the holiday season.
1521;The wonderful Jean Shepherd perfectly captures the kind of irrational working.
1522;class American adult world in which many my age (60) grew up.
1523;Of course, the movie also provides wonderful insights into how kids dealt with that world and its assumptions.
1524;Shooting your eye out was never so much fun.
1525;Amazon made this a memorable Christmas for our family.
1526;The picture is lumpy and slightly wavy.
1527;i would recommend this to my friends.
1528;Well acted and accurately captured many themes for those of us who are baby boomers.
1529;Thoroughly enjoyed the Christmas themes.
1530;This video is a classic family film to watch at Christmas time.
1531;This movie is the type that should become a Christmas tradition, it is unforgetable.
1532;Christmas Story is a movie that always gives me the warm fuzzies.
1533;What could have been just another story of childhood is enhanced by Ralphie's vivid imagination (the dream sequences are hilarious) and Jean Shepherd's amusing narration.
1534;A classic to be treasured.
1535;It's so good and always puts me in the Christmas spirit.
1536;Movie came quickly and it's a great movie to watch during the holiday season!
1537;Ralphie and his family will win your heart time after time.
1538;Take a trip down this nostalgic memory lane again and again.
1539;This is by far a new Christmas classic!
1540;So many classic lines from this movie and I love to repeat them all!
1541;This movie is one of my favorites.
1542;I laugh a lot as I remember my own childhood Christmases.
1543;"I enjoy the slower pace of the film
I:11001;1544;Just a good, fun movie.
I:11001;1545;There are very few movies which I can honestly say qualify as my """"favorites."""""""
1546;Because I laughed as much watching it the 23rd time as I did the first.
1547;the genius of this movie is its simple, heartfelt story and loveable characters.
1548;And how exciting it was to open it up and see that you *actually* got it?!
1549;This movie is superb in that it appeals to all audiences.
1550;There is no violence, no blood.
1551;Every moment of A Christmas Story is Packed with great comedy.
1552;It is also sweet and heartwarming at times.
1553;It's a Christmas classic that we watch every year.
1554;And yes I watch it on TBS at least once during the 24.
1555;I just convinced my fiance to watch it and he even he liked it!
1556;bought because my husband loves this movie.
1557;The first time I watched this movie was at the age of ten and I love it ever since.
1558;Ralphie and his obsession with a Red Ryder BB gun is an annual classic.
1559;Randy the little brother is adorable too.
1560;I watch this movie every year during the holidays.
1561;I laugh ever time I watch it.
1562;I think that everybody should have this movie it makes a very good Christmas present.
1563;"set in the 40s, for those who grow up in the 60s could easily identify with the themes of ""A Christmas Story""."
1564;You will laugh yourself senseless.
1565;It's a classic and we're glad we own it so now we can watch it every year.
1566;This is a classic movie and I love it.
1567;Its really funny and the disk was bwtter then i expected over all i give this a solid 4 stars
1568;This is by far the best family Christmas movie ever made.
1569;There are plenty of fine holiday movies, and I like most of them, but this one has a special place in my heart.
1570;It is fun, and really quite humorous.

1581;That's classic and so hysterical.
1582;I also love the part when Ralphie is forced to wear that hideous pink rabbit costume that his aunt sent him for Christmas.
1583;disc 2003 special edition set.
1584;Because it didn't cost much (that's most important and yes these are used but I couldn't care less) and because the packaging is great, it's looks like a Christmas gift (see the scans that I took the time to label and post) and it includes lots of bonuses and interviews.
1585;"disc set includes ""A Christmas Story"" in both pan and scan and letterbox, and the movie is remastered

1615;shaped animated lamp complete with a black mesh stocking!In his eyes the leg of lamp (I coudn't resist) is absolutely beautiful and,much to the dismay of his wife, he proudly displays it for all to see in their front window.
1616;the lamp is a major source of contention between them as each one attempts to move it.
1617;with his face firmly in the plate he eats like one much to the disgust of his father!Although based on the Red Ryder BB gun, there are many other storylines highlighted in this wonderful movie.

1619;to those of us who grew up in the forties and early fifties it brings back fond memories of our past Christmases.

1856;"Somebody write Hollywood and tell them to give that ""storytelling"" technique a rest."

1860;This is a classic Christmas movie for me, watch it every year!
1861;Everyone should see at least once in their life!
1862;thank you, would order from them again.
1863;This is one of the best movies as well as a great Christmas movie.
1864;It will remind all of us some point in our childhood.
1865;One of my fondest memories of Christmas as a child is watching this wonderful classic with my family every year.
1866;And unlike most movies you see over and over as a kid, I found myself loving this movie the older I got.
1867;"I recently had the inauspicious pleasure of viewing ""The Polar Express"" for the first time, and it made me think about some of my favorite holiday films."
1868;"(And I apologize if you loved ""Express"" as most do, it's just not for me.)"
1869;the phenomena of a regular film evolving into a classic is rather indefinable, but very exciting in hindsight.
1870;A wistful and nostalgic look at the childhood of humorist Jean Shepherd, the film recounts, in hilarious detail, one child's quest for the ultimate Christmas gift.
1871;top comic portrayals, this film still manages to be grounded in reality.
1872;the screenplay is so rich and funny, I know people who can quote whole passages from this film.
1873;And there's lots of great material to work with!
1874;The performances are spot on.
1875;Peter Billingsly is fantastic as Ralphie.
1876;and even today, he is identified with this iconic role.
1877;Melinda Dillon is perfect as the sweet, put.
1878;It is a perfectly nuanced performance.
1879;"A Christmas Story is sweet without being cloying, carries a message without being obvious, and is suitable for the whole family without ""dumbing itself down"" for children."
1880;I reserved it for a movie that has earned my love and respect, not one that demanded it.
1881;I watch it every year and figured it would be nice to have my own copy.
1882;I LOVE this Christmas movie and in my opinon it's probably one of the best movies ever made in the United States.
1883;this will remain to be a classic in American homes for generations to come.
1884;"Kids will love the movie for they can relate to that ""gotta have toy"" feeling and adults will remember what it was like."
1885;written very well this smart witted comedy gets laughs no matter how many times you watch it.
1886;Every time I watch it I come away with having learned something new.
1887;Great fun for the entire family, a video you'll treasure well into the next millenium.
1888;would recommend it to all it is heartwarming and wholesome .

1901;Every year me and my daughter watch this movie around the Holidays and it is just as funny as the year before.
1902;the things Ralphie goes through to get the Rifle of his dreams for Christmas is hilarious.

1945;It's has plenty of humor too.
1946;Our Christmas is now complete!
1947;I always crack up when I see this film!I like when the kid sticks his toungh to the flag pole and when Ralphie finally has enough of the bully Scott Fargas and teaches him a lesson!I have a question however.
1948;this movie relates to the way things were in a lot of our childhood memories with a humorous twist.
1949;i find it very entertaining.
1950;This iconic story is timeless.
1951;If you don't already have this in your Christmas collection, it is great!!

1955;I didn't like it, but my kids enjoyed it.

1957;One of the best, if not the best, Christmas movies ever made!
1958;We love our Christmas movies!

1962;it is a classic and I watch it every year and once in awhile during the year!
1963;This is a timeless classic.
1964;The movie is relevant today with it's humorous reflection of life, seen through the eyes of a boy, and especial those of us who grew up in late 50's.
1965;Our family and friends have weaved some of the universally appropriate lines into the daily fabric of our social circle.
1966;The story is is brilliantly told with charming and heartwarming skill.
1967;she grew up in the 1940s and can surely relate to ralphie and randy's home life.

I:11001;1975;I bought the movie so I can watch it whenever I want.
I:11001;1976;It is a real pick.
I:11001;1977;up kind of a movie.
I:11001;1978;One you can laugh to yourself through the whole show.
I:11001;1979;One can't beat this delightful story for a trip back in time.
I:11001;1980;It is refreshing each time we watch it.
I:11001;1981;This movie is brilliantly funny!
I:11001;1982;, I feel like it captures a kid's view of life in the 1960s and early 70s as well.
I:11001;1983;A great film for an awesome price.
I:11001;1984;It's the classic American Christmas tale when Santa did bring dreams, and all was right with the world.
I:11001;1985;This is a Classic Amercian movie/book and a happy story for all ages to watch together and make memories!
I:11001;1986;I watch it every year.
I:11001;1987;It takes us back to the simpler life we knew
I:11001;1988;One of my favorite Christmas movies of all time.
I:11001;1989;Bought a few of these for gifts, and added some good cocoa and popcorn for a nice evening in this busy season.
I:11001;1990;Not as good as the Press gave us to believe, It's a Wonderful Life is a much better movie.
I:11001;1991;For those of us that remember christmas as a kid, it reminds us of the anticipation of wanting a specific toy knowing that it was far from our reach.
I:11001;1992;For those that are the later generations the story shows that even a simple gift can be so rewarding.
I:11001;1993;It's a great christmas movie from a kids point of view.
I:11001;1994;Bought as a gift for my husband.
I:11001;1995;I've finally ensured that this title will be available in a widescreen special edition.
I:11001;1996;Sound is fine, although monaural.
I:11001;1997;I would like to see it widescreen, fully restored, with commentary or retrospective interviews.
I:11001;1998;A must see every Christmas season.
I:11001;1999;Funny, witty, great for the whole family.
I:11001;2000;This movie will become a family tradition.
I:11001;2001;Especially meaningful for those of us that grew up in the 50's.
I:11001;2002;Wonderful movie with wonderful character portrayals of an American Christmas in the 50's.
I:11001;2003;This is truly a holiday classic and favorite.
I:11001;2004;WOW, is the first word that comes to mind after seeing this movie.
I:11001;2005;A christmas story is about, surprise, surprise, a christmas for your all.
I:11001;2006;One of the members of the family, a golden.
I:11001;2007;and the results are hilarious!
I:11001;2008;There are some strengths to this movie.
I:11001;2009;The marriage we get to witness is a terrific one.
I:11001;2010;The father and mother love each other and the children.
I:11001;2011;That is one of the few strengths of this film, that the family is ordinary rather than wealthy and proper.
I:11001;2012;my favorite moment of the movie is when Santa Claus gives the little boy a kick.
I:11001;2013;as for the rest of it, it's a children's film, and if you like that sort of thing, you will like this.
I:11001;2014;This is one of my favorite movies.
I:11001;2015;We watch the movie at least twice during the holiday season.
I:11001;2016;I would recommend this movie to anybody, young or old.
I:11001;2017;This is so hilarious and a timeless classic to watch for the holidays.
I:11001;2018;What a great bargain too!
I:11001;2019;Still my favorite movie and in Blu.
I:11001;2020;I bought it for my dad it reminds him of his childhood.
I:11001;2021;It is in perfect condition and came in time for watching this Christmas season.
I:11001;2022;This is a funny movie for the entire family to enjoy.
I:11001;2023;My seventh grade class watched it and loved it.
I:11001;2024;love it, brings back such memories from the good old days.
I:11001;2025;Never gets old and it is entertaining enough to watch it over and over again
I:11001;2026;So we are very happy to have our own copy for the holiday season.
I:11001;2027;great classic I really enjoyed it.
I:11001;2028;I love this movie, watch it with my family every year!
I:11001;2029;you'll shoot your eye out kid best line ever!
I:11001;2030;I bought this movie for my son as a Christmas gift.
I:11001;2031;He loves this movie and so do I. It's a classic.
I:11001;2032;It reminds me of a kid's point of view, and that I can laugh when things don't go as planned.
I:11001;2033;A true holiday classic and tradition in our family.
I:11001;2034;Warms my heart and makes me laugh every time!
I:11001;2035;Funny, well acted and so true to the time period!
I:11001;2036;This is a Christmas classic that will never grow old.
I:11001;2037;This movie, of course, is a classic, timeless piece, and will get your spirit up, through out the year or, if you dare, during the Festive season.
I:11001;2038;A tongue in cheek look at a family Christmas journey.
I:11001;2039;EVERYONE can identify with something in this film.
I:11001;2040;This is a great movie!
I:11001;2041;My daughter and I love this movie.
I:11001;2042;It is a funny and a classic holiday movie.
I:11001;2043;I make my family watch this all day long on Christmas Day(yes, they tolerate me well), 'tis the season to be merry!
I:11001;2044;friendly, while still appealing to adult humor.
I:11001;2045;I have found it important to make sure my kids don't forget some of the classic movies and this is one of them.
I:11001;2046;My little girl loved it and I got a kick out of watching it again myself.
I:11001;2047;Another one of the Christmas Must Own movies!
I:11001;2048;I love this movie and it wouldn't be Christmas if I couldn't watch it at least A HUNDRED times!
I:11001;2049;I haven't seen this in a few years and was pleasantly surprised at how much I still really enjoy it.
I:11001;2050;It is a beautifully done ole fashioned Christmas movie.
I:11001;2051;very enjoyable and took me back to yesterday.
I:11001;2052;My family and I watch this every year.
I:11001;2053;His father is a hoot, and his friends always good for a laugh.
I:11001;2054;A classic that every family should watch at Christmas time.
I:11001;2055;Peter Billingsley as Ralphie gives a sterling performance, a perfect combination of childhood naivete' and more mature observation.
I:11001;2056;Darrin McGavin is wonderful as Ralphie's dad, the old man, exuding boyish joy while at the same time trying to act like a father.
I:11001;2057;she does a fine job, though, and in the end is a nice match for Darrin McGavin.
I:11001;2058;It works beautifully, lending a sort of sepia.
I:11001;2059;toned nostalgic tone to the story.
I:11001;2060;if you're looking for a replacement (or addition) to It's a Wonderful Life, this is a good candidate.
I:11001;2061;something the entire family can enjoy!
I:11001;2062;I grew up 20 years later than Ralphie and Randy, yet still remember all those wonderful things at Christmastime: a big department store with Santaland and an expanded toy department, a downtown Christmas parade, going out to get the tree from a tree lot, Bing Crosby playing on the phonograph, plus Dad being gruff and a bit contentious, Mom a worrier but understanding just when you needed her.
I:11001;2063;This is particularly meaningful for those of us who were actually kids during that time.
I:11001;2064;It's a family favorite ever since our boys went to the movie theater and saw it with their dad, who had a red rider bb gun.
I:11001;2065;Jean Shepherd also narrates this marvelous movie, as well as appearing in the film.
I:11001;2066;Jean's narration is wonderful and really helps to make this movie successful.
I:11001;2067;The story is inspired by real life events (even if they did not happen to Jean, they happened to others .
I:11001;2068;Jean managed to capture the feel of Christmas in the Midwest in the post.
I:11001;2069;the bully was nicely played in this movie.
I:11001;2070;ralphie and the broken glasses is also classic.
I:11001;2071;Jean Shepherd did a phenomenal job of capturing the essence of a region and an era.
I:11001;2072;A Christmas Story may only be a great family Christmas movie for a while.
I:11001;2073;It's funny, sweet, surprising and just down.
I:11001;2074;right an all American classic.
I:11001;2075;The concept of the movie and story line was a good idea.
I:11001;2076;and it was nice to watch.
I:11001;2077;Because of the media hype on the movie I had higher expectations of it.
I:11001;2078;In the end I did laugh and I will keep it for time's when I want to watch something slow moving with humor in it.
I:11001;2079;My Grandchildren love to watch this very year.
I:11001;2080;I kept wondering why everyone liked it so much.
I:11001;2081;It made me remember those days and I laughed a lot.
I:11001;2082;I would reccomend this movie for the family it is very funny.
I:11001;2083;A story for all ages.
I:11001;2084;I probably paid more but watched it early afternoon with my grandaughters and such belly laughs.
I:11001;2085;For a low dollar production it was well worth it and the extra disc about the characters 20 years later was great.
I:11001;2086;We decorate the tree with A Christmas story playing on the TV.
I:11001;2087;We enjoyed watching this every year, but this year it was as if we were watching a new and better version!
I:11001;2088;we watch this movie every christmas my family loves it it wouldn't be christmas if we didn't watch this great movie.
I:11001;2089;This story of Ralphie and his longing for a specific Christmas present is one of the best movies ever in my book.
I:11001;2090;watch A Christmas Story at least once a year.
I:11001;2091;I loved the story when i first viewed it in 1986 and I STILL do.
I:11001;2092;it is one of the best holiday comedies ever written.
I:11001;2093;those that didn't , will still find this moe full of many laughs.
I:11001;2094;My grand children wanted this film and they rated it .
I:11001;2095;They say it's funny, very,very funny, and they plan 2 watch again today
I:11001;2096;It was so nice to get out from under TNT's monopoly on this film!
I:11001;2097;I bought this movie as a gift.
I:11001;2098;The movie is a classic and we enjoyed adding it to our collection
I:11001;2099;My children grew up watching this movie at Christmas and it has become a part of our family's holiday traditions!
I:11001;2100;and it has become a family tradition.
I:11001;2101;Even though we can say the lines it still makes you crack up laughing!
I:11001;2102;If you enjoy Christmas then you must have this in your Christmas move collection.
I:11001;2103;This is a timeless family movie that is just a must have.
I:11001;2104;And THAT'S what makes this movie so doggone special!!!
I:11001;2105;I love the whole thing.
I:11001;2106;well, it takes me back to my OWN childhood, which I feel blessed was very special and endearing (yet far from perfect).
I:11001;2107;loving dads and the magic of Santa, too.
I:11001;2108;a Christmas Story is a wonderful film for the WHOLE family.
I:11001;2109;People, life is NOT perfect.
I:11001;2110;especially if this is the first time you've seen this Christmas gem that will forever be my favorite holiday film.
I:11001;2111;So funny and it brings back memories of my own childhood, although I'm only 45.
I:11001;2112;Seems to be that way ever year, which helps to keep it fresh and entertaining.
I:11001;2113;Movie is not a small child movie, but definitely made for teens and adults.
I:11001;2114;the product was tightly closed with a good presentation.
I:11001;2115;my dad wanted a copy of this classic and i found the best price right here.
I:11001;2116;well done and i will look here again when shopping for movies.
I:11001;2117;A great trip down memory lane.
I:11001;2118;My family and I enjoy watching this movie a lot, eve when is not Christmas.
I:11001;2119;Unsentimental Christmas story is quite unusual and enjoyable.
I:11001;2120;I watched through this movie before allowing my kids to see it, and I decided this was not a movie to let them see at their age.
I:11001;2121;I enjoyed these movies because there was so much feeling, giving and love to others.
I:11001;2122;Tis is one you can show year after year.
I:11001;2123;My family has enjoyed this movie for years.
I:11001;2124;It has become a family tradition to watch A Christmas Story on Thanksgiving day.
I:11001;2125;It's one of the best Christmas movies for bringing back childhood memories.
I:11001;2126;Now they're all gone and my husband have continued watching it and enjoy it every year.
I:11001;2127;We love the story and looked forward to watching this with our family during the Thanksgiving holiday
I:11001;2128;A Christmas Story is fun to watch.
I:11001;2129;I always enjoy watching it every year on tv.
I:11001;2130;I loved it as a kid and my kids love it now.
I:11001;2131;This movie is a classic!
I:11001;2132;The first time I watched in TV and was able to see at small part.
I:11001;2133;Was happy to see the whole STORY from beginning to end
I:11001;2134;And Ralphie finally gets his Little Orphan Annie decoder.
I:11001;2135;Will it be under the tree Christmas morning?This movie is based on a collection of short stories, and it shows.
I:11001;2136;While the multiple stories weave in and out of each other much like real life, they never truly form a cohesive whole.
I:11001;2137;There were several laughs along the way, and the acting was good.
I:11001;2138;One of the best classics out there!!!
I:11001;2139;I highly recommend this one if you want a movie to watch around the holiday season!
I:11001;2140;The BD came up great on this classic Xmas film, a film that I have pretty much memorized at this point.
I:11001;2141;I prefer the widescreen myself (though you can watch the full screen version just to see the trampoline that Black Bart uses to jump the fence and mount his horse as he flees the imagined wrath of Ralphie's blue.
I:11001;2142;This movie will make you laugh until you cry!!!
I:11001;2143;A Christmas Story is a wonderful movie for you and your family to sit together and watch on Christmas day.
I:11001;2144;Brought back memories of growing up.
I:11001;2145;the cookie cutters and apron are a great edition as well as the story book that comes with.
I:11001;2146;This movie has it all and is fulling of surprises, no matter how many times u watch it!
I:11001;2147;This warm and charming movie saves our increasingly short breath by telling everybody how it was with remarkable clarity and emotional authenticity.
I:11001;2148;A perfect Christmas story about an imperfect Christmas.
I:11001;2149;Stays a fresh story year after year.
I:11001;2150;Fun movie to watch every Christmas.
I:11001;2151;I love watching this movie as it is good for several hardy laughs.
I:11001;2152;Got great service and shipping time from this vendor.
I:11001;2153;We watch it as a family every year at Christmas.
I:11001;2154;A excellent vendor who will get my business again!
I:11001;2155;The wish of every boy, a red rider special.
I:11001;2156;If you want to teach your kids to be real brats, this movie is for you!
I:11001;2157;I prefer movies that model good behavior.
I:11001;2158;This movie has a cult following that is well deserved.
I:11001;2159;I don't know how I missed seeing this movie sooner, it is now one of my Christmas favorites!
I:11001;2160;It really tickles my funny one.
I:11001;2161;It doesn't get any better than this comedy from a kids point of view that takes those of us that were raised in the 40s and 50s back to our childhood including bullies and favorite radio shows whether we grew up in upstate Indiana or not.
I:11001;2162;It's our favorite Christmas movie by far.
I:11001;2163;One of the new Christmas classics!!
I:11001;2164;four hour marathon right along side It's a Wonderful Life!
I:11001;2165;I love this little movie.
I:11001;2166;so cute and so much fun to watch.
I:11001;2167;I actually bought this Christmas present for myself and I just loved it.
I:11001;2168;The film and story is beautiful.
I:11001;2169;To be played in a 24 hour marathon on TBS is a little excessive but it gives us a chance to watch the movie as a backdrop to Christmas parties.
I:11001;2170;The special features are fun.
I:11001;2171;i like this movie because it's a family theme story.
I:11001;2172;Ralphie and his family's ups and downs during Christmas kind of reminds of my family.
I:11001;2173;Ralphie's friends are familiar to the kids I knew at that age.
I:11001;2174;The """"profanity"""" is both funny and reminder to all the names my sister and I said (""""ass."""
2175;this is a true classic Christmas movie that will always be a tradition to be watched in my family.
2176;This is a Christmas movie we watch every year, I grew up in this generation and can so relate to everything Ralphy goes through.
2177;Love seeing the small parts that were edited out of the TV version.
2178;/we watched it an laughed.
2179;It is the best Xmas movie ever made, appeals to all ages.
2180;It's a Christmas morningtradition at our home,
2181;I've watched many Christmas specials over the years and this has to be one of the very best!
2182;What a typically dysfunctional American family working out the kinks of its Christmas confusion is ironically a delightful story!
2183;Bought several for family memories and they loved it overall.
2184;Very funny movie for my entire family to watch together.
2185;I love this movie because it is not all sticky sweet.
2186;To me, it is entertaining because it is more real than most Christmas Movies.
2187;Great story and a must to add to your collection of Christmas movies unless you feel like watching it on repeat Christmas morning on your local TV channel.
2188;This is such a great addition to any Christmas movie collection.
2189;It's such a classic and I love this movie!
2190;The original, still the best Christmas movie of all time.
2191;I watch this once a year.
2192;Somehow I'm always surprised by the number of hysterical lines in the movie.
2193;The photography was very nice.
2194;actually, the photography in this film is quite nice as well.
2195;leg lamp that Dad won in a contents and insists on displaying in the front window.
2196;The film is also helped by the pitch.
2197;"perfect casting
I:11001;2198;a marvelous combination of unaffected youthfulness and shrewd comic timing (you can believe that this kid would grow up to be somebody smart like Jean Shepherd).
I:11001;2199;and best of all, despite the wonderful period details in the sets and costumes, this isn't a nostalgic film"
2200;This movie remains so fresh with each viewing, it is easy to forget that it is almost twenty years old.

2208;"I saw this as a teenager in the theaters on a whim and was very pleasantly surprised
I:11001;2209;even if some of the stories are not originally related to Christmas (the Bumpkiss hounds actually eat the Easter ham in Shepard's book) but as a whole the collected stories are believable, poignant, and funny.
I:11001;2210;If you're one of the 15 or so people in America who haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and correct that as soon as you can.
I:11001;2211;also highly enjoyable and recommended.
I:11001;2212;this movie is truly an american classic.
I:11001;2213;this movie is, in my opinion, the best Christmas movie there is out there today, and probably ever will be.

I:11001;2215;Glad I will be able to watch it anytime I want and not just when the 24 hour marathons run.

I:11001;2222;Brings back the spirit of Christmas and is heart warming and funny.
I:11001;2223;the top and bottom parts of the film are cut out on the laserdisc version.
I:11001;2224;A handful of film directors do this (James Cameron has done this with """"The Abyss"""") because they are aware the film will eventually end up on television, so they will shoot the film as if shooting for a television release."""
2225;Rank it right up there with Miracle on 34th Street and It's a Wonderful Life .

2241;this movie is entertaining because of its well.
2242;written story, but it's also awesome for nostalgia.

2245;We all had a good laugh.

2247;Watched it a million times, still laughing!
2248;Love this movie and it was the perfect gift for my husband.
2249;I'm very happy I was able to share this movie with my children.

2253;The kids (and now grandkids) love it!

2265;"Magical and nostalgic
I:11001;2266;The best Christmas Story film ever.
I:11001;2267;Even with the sensitive times we are experiencing, it still manages to entertain.
I:11001;2268;This is as funny as a Lampoon Christmas.
I:11001;2269;I love this movie and laugh so hard each time I see it!
I:11001;2270;My children in their late 30's still remember seeing this as kids and can still quote the main lines.
I:11001;2271;This is a great movie to remind of us all the things in our lives and to look at them with a great sense of humor.
I:11001;2272;The video came in perfect condition.
I:11001;2273;The movie kept pausing throughout.
I:11001;2274;A very hysterical family holiday and just about anytime tradition.
I:11001;2275;So many aspects of this movie are hilarious.
I:11001;2276;*** Edited 2003.12.18: ***I love this movie.
I:11001;2277;And being from a child's point of view, why it is precious!
I:11001;2278;My mother told me I'd love it and anytime she tells me that, I usually squirm away in horror.
I:11001;2279;This movie makes me belly laugh about so many things!
I:11001;2280;at school, Ralphie's teacher, Miss Shields, (Tedde Moore) assigns his class to write a Christmas theme.
I:11001;2281;be gun as the ideal Christmas gift.
I:11001;2282;He writes what he believes will be regarded a masterpiece, but when Miss Shields returns his theme, Ralphie is shocked to see a grade of """"C+""""."""
2283;"ralphie's father is a fascinating character in the film with several great subplots: his unintelligible expressions of frustration with the neighbor's uncontrolled pack of dogs and struggles with their failing furnace, and his winning of a ""major prize""."
2284;This is a film that can be enjoyed at any time of the year, but especially during the holidays.
2285;Watch and see whether Ralphie will ever get his beloved, official, Red Ryder, Carbine.
2286;A Great Movie for Christmas for the Family.
2287;One of the best movie's ever made.
2288;If you have never seen this one it is a hoot, it's just good clean fun for the entire family.
2289;I watch this every Christmas and even sometimes in between the holiday's too.
2290;Easily my favorite Christmas movie.
2291;Twenty years after its initial release, A Christmas Story remains one of the most heartwarming, human and enjoyable Yuletide tales ever.
2292;The casting of Peter Billingsley, Melinda Dillon and Darren McGavin was truly inspired and are at the heart of this classic.
2293;Billingsley's unabashed imagination, his wide.
2294;eyed awe of all that goes on around him, his desire to get that beebee gun, and his joyous love of life is one of the best children's performances on celluloid.
2295;Melinda Dillon's Mom is a joy to behold.
2296;what a marvelous performance she gives.
2297;her love and admiration for her husband and children is evidenced in so many sublte ways and Dillon captures and embodies the wonder of motherhood.
2298;mouthed, but the biggest kid in the movie.
2299;This movie alone shows what an underappreciated and fine actor Mr. McGavin is.
2300;christmas' true meaning and its simplicity and joy have not been captured any more effectively in this Christmas gem.
2301;It brings something to the table for all ages.
2302;This is one of the great films, and cannot be missed.
2303;I double checked my Internet connections and all was working well.
2304;A wonderful companion to the new Broadway musical.
2305;A Great Movie to watch each Christmas or anytime you need to Laugh.
2306;Those of us over 60 can certainly identify with life as depicted in the movie.
2307;This is my favorite Christmas movie.
2308;I Love this Movie, it is one of my Very favs.
2309;It is both funny and warm and takes me back to a kinder simpler time.
2310;Of course we get to watch it for 24 consecutive hours at Christmas time and it has become a wonderful Holiday tradition but every now and then it would be so nice have it available to experience during the year.
2311;Well now I can and recently did with my Grandson who seemed also to be touched by the magic of this movie.
2312;By far the funniest Christmas movie ever.
2313;Totally captures the childhood joys of Christmas along with all the inner workings of a childs mind.
2314;Easily one of the best movies ever made.
2315;especially that the entire family can watch.
2316;This movie is truly wonderful in its truth and simplicity.
2317;period wise, parallel with Ralphie, the central character and 1st person narrator of the movie.
2318;And, I remember well what it was like to be nine years old then and there.
2319;i recommend this movie to anyone who ever was a young boy or who knows a young boy.
2320;We love the characters and the story and the setting.
2321;It's got some great bits, and classic stuff like the lamp and the bunny suit and the Red Ryder BB gun.
2322;The funny scenes are numerous and still tickled my ribs, particularly:1.
2323;the movie is a great story about Christmas time in the Midwest in a simpler era (I guess the 1950s or so) and the small town values that many today yearn for.
2324;The movie still entertains and teaches good values without demeaning the true meaning of Christmas without being politically correct (i. e. .
2325;complaint aside, I do recommend the movie as a Christmas classic.
2326;A favorite of mine for the holidays!
2327;This has become a holiday tradition througout my extended family.
2328;This is one of those movies that gets better every time you watch it.
2329;I have loved this movie ever since I first saw it.
2330;It's one of the first videos I ever bought.
2331;This movie has captured how it feels to be a kid.
2332;I think that is a good lesson for everyone.
2333;It's just as cute as can be.
2334;See it with your family.
2335;I think just about everyone will enjoy it.
2336;I love, love, love this movie.
2337;I watch it year round and non stop on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.
2338;My 4 and 5 year old autistic grandchildren are enthralled with this movie.
2339;i can identify with the time period, so it's nostalgia seeing how my Christmases were back in the day.
2340;ralph is a junior Walter Mitty with all his daydreams/fantasies.
2341;Ralphie's big blue eyes filling with tears and then .
2342;I used all those soaps mentioned and had a couple put into my mouth as well.
2343;This movie is classic, we watch it every year, it's hilarious and clean
2344;This is a wonderful, funny and in my opinion very warm family film.
2345;The look of joy and delight on the fathers face when Ralphie opens his much hoped for gift often brings tears to my eyes.
2346;The film and story is beautiful.
2347;To be played in a 24 hour marathon on TBS is a little excessive but it gives us a chance to watch the movie as a backdrop to Christmas parties.
2348;The special features are fun.
2349;i like this movie because it's a family theme story.
2350;Ralphie and his family's ups and downs during Christmas kind of reminds of my family.
2351;Ralphie's friends are familiar to the kids I knew at that age.
2352;"The ""profanity"" is both funny and reminder to all the names my sister and I said (""ass."
2353;this is a true classic Christmas movie that will always be a tradition to be watched in my family.
2354;happy happy happy happy happy happy happy holiday holiday holiday holiday Christmas time classic
2355;As popular as this feature is today, this did not take hold until quite recently.
2356;Now A Christmas Story has joined the ranks of such other yuletide treasures as It's a Wonderful Life and A Charlie Brown Christmas as a true staple of this special time of year.
2357;the story fellows the adventures of a young boy set against the Christmas holiday in the 1940's as he dreams of the perfect holiday gift.
2358;shot Range Model Air Rifle, the one item that he believes to be the perfect Christmas present.
2359;The plot for A Christmas Story is one of the most wonderful concepts ever attempted in a holiday feature film and what makes it so memorable is the fact that many elements, no matter how elaborated, can be related by one family or another in some point in their lives.
2360;the biggest highlight of the comedy has to be how each character is cast perfectly.
2361;Peter Billingsley, who takes on the role of Ralph Parker, showcases a delightful performance despite his relatively young age.
2362;Many of the funniest moments of the feature come from his reactions alone to certain situations.
2363;Melinda Dillion gives a wonderful if not eerily familiar performance of Ralphie's typical 1940's mother.
2364;She works perfectly opposite Darren McGavin especially over the battle of the broken leg lamp.
2365;top performance as Ralphie's Old Man.
2366;will likely stand the test of theatrical comedic time but it is his overall good fatherly nature that makes every audience member feel as if they are witness a part of their own familiar past.
2367;Though he is not remembered by his name, Jeff Gillen does a hilarious take on the mall.
2368;And Jean Shepard, who wrote the book on which this film is based on, gives a perfect off.
2369;beat narration of the film with perfect tones and comments for each situation as it happens in the feature.
2370;The narration works almost as well alone as the actions performed in A Christmas Story.
2371;There are so many wonderful things going for this film that it is hard to pick out the flaws.
2372;In a way like Christmas Vacation, many of the elements within A Christmas Story connect with someone at one point or another based on their own Christmas experiences with their family.
2373;Though some would not like to admit some of the more embarrassing memories (aka looking like a pink nightmare on Christmas morning), we can all relate to young Ralphie's blight of getting the perfect Christmas gift when we were his age.
2374;But in the end, we realize that family, no matter how embarrassing or bumbling they may be, is what is the most important during the holidays.
2375;That is one memory that we should always keep close to our hearts no matter what time of the year.
2376;Charming, funny, and entertaining film about a boys memory of his favorite Christmas.
2377;Daren McGavin gives a great performance as the contest entry obsessed father.
2378;This is a true American Christmas classic.
2379;I watched it every Christmas season for years and now own my own copy so I can enjoy it at other times too!
2380;For every season, there is a classic movie.
2381;"In our house, ""A Christmas Story"" tops the list when Christmas rolls around."
2382;Without a doubt this movie is a classic!
2383;I do love this movie.
2384;Its a timeless Christmas movie that should be played every holiday at everyone's house.
2385;Great movie and a must own!
2386;It had been a while since I saw this movie, now I remember why it is a Christmas classic.
2387;A Christmas Story brings back the memories of being home for Christmas as a kid.
2388;With Amazon, I was able to share it with my family as well.
2389;Loved this movie as a kid nowMy kids do as well.
2390;the high jinx never stops all the way up to a hilarious ending~A MUST SEE!!!
2391;i love all the characters especially Ralphie and Mr. Parker.
2392;its a great family friendly movie.
2393;I have bought this for gifts many times in the past.
2394;A great movie that my family adores!
2395;I love this movie it makes you laugh and cry.
2396;I know many people might not agree with me on this but I can't help it, I love this movie.
2397;"There are many memorable scenes to this movie but my favorite is when Ralphie says the ""F"" word."
2398;I thought that this scene along with others just made this the funniest Christmas movie.
2399;If you have a heart for the old days of the forties and fifties, this film will entrance you from the moment you hear Shepherd's voice.
2400;It's a timeless tale of simple lives at Christmas time and a family that could live on any block on Main Street, USA, only funnier.
2401;This is definitely a story for grown ups.
2402;bringing you back to the innocence of BB.
2403;guns and practical jokes and schoolyard bullies, this warm tale of Christmas past will make you long for the days when everyone wasn't so politically.
2404;sensitive and folks took responsibility for their own actions.
2405;A CHRISTMAS STORY is a timeless holiday movie classic, right next to THE GRINCH WHO STOLE CHRISTMAS (cartoon version, movie version still good).
2406;This splendid holiday tale is about nine.year.
2407;it's all crucial to how great this movie really is.
2408;Jean Shepherd's commentary during parts of the movie also adds to the comic splendor you'll laugh with.
2409;All the actors in this movie are terrific, especially Darren McGavin, Peter Billingsley, Melinda Dillon, and the teacher and Ralphie's brother.
2410;and it's easy to love this timeless classic again and again.You and your family will love this splendid tale, and may it bring warmest wishes for your holiday seasons to come!
2411;This is one Christmas classic you'll want to own.
2412;Some of us have watched it since it first showed up thirty years ago and now the grandchildren are enjoying it too.
2413;I remember growing up watching this movie during the holidays when it first reached TV in 1985.
2414;Some of the most memorable quotes and funniest scenes of any holiday movie came from this flick (and I don't mean Scotty Schwartz).
2415;You'll shoot your eye out , is the most well known line, but many are much funnier.
2416;are just a few of the hilarious quotes and scenes in this great Christmas masterpiece.
2417;Since Christmas is that day in which the entire kid year revolves, this would make a great present under the tree, or an even better early Christmas Eve surprise to watch with your family.
2418;My fiance and I watch this movie every year and laugh out loud every time.
2419;This is the best Christmas movie or program that exists.
2420;A Charlie Brown Christmas, Rudolph, and Garfield come close, but nothing beats Ralphie's Christmas adventure in his quest for a Red Ryder 200.
2421;(check out my other reviews of great Christmas videos and music)
2422;From the leg lamp to the soap in the mouth, it is hilarious.
2423;I'd probably recommend it for 10+ year olds though.
2424;The language has a touch of color.
2425;If you're 4 to 104, it is totally enjoyable!
2426;Every year for the past 17 years, I have sat down with my family to enjoy this film.
2427;Every year, this movie gets better and better.
2428;It really makes you remember how Christmas was when you were a kid,and despite all the quirks and discrepancies, how wonderful it is to have a family around during that time of year.
2429;A great film that has become a great family tradition.
2430;It's better than I remember.
2431;It was also shipped out very fast!
2432;I can watch this movie with my family 100's of times.
2433;It ever gets old nor stops being hilariously funny.
2434;I love this movie and was happy with this price, but when I watch about 2/3 of the movie, it stops.
2435;warm fuzzy funny disFUNctional family in the 40's.
2436;if you have seen this movie before you know that you can watch it 100 * over again for Christmas Story is a classic story about Ralphie a young boy who likes adventures.
2437;I laughed my hind parts off.
2438;One of the all time best Christmas movies.
2439;If you grew up between the 50's and the 70's it will raise many funny memories.
2440;It's not a complicated plot and is full of episodic little incidents, but every moment is thoroughly enjoyable.
2441;The combination of nostalgic, relatable situations and characters and a perfectly selected cast of talents (including Kolchak the Nightstaker himself, Darren McGavin, as the Old Man), not to mention Jean Shepherd's pure brilliance (including his genius as a narrator, which he does for all the Ralphie films), make this film a true cinematic treasure.
2442;budget (you could hardly tell), 1983 masterpiece has become a true classic and genuine phenomenon resulting in a flood of merchandise in recent years (yes, I have the action figures) as well as making the Parker family home a legitimate tourist attraction.
2443;"What we do have here is a ""documentary"" that is quite enjoyable, though it is no ""making."
2444;That's a practice I'll never understand!
2445;ray is okay, but the movie itself is a must own.
2446;now, before I end this, I want to recommend all those who find they love this film to look into the other 5 Ralphie films.
2447;"Then, in 1978, ""The Great American 4th of July and Other Disasters"", which is a true favorite of mine and stars a young Matt Damon as Ralph, again a teenager in a real Ralphie."
2448;The blind date bit is priceless!
2449;Again, we see Ralph as a teen in this one, when he finds his first love in the Polish girl who moves in next door after the hillbilly Bumpuses move out.
2450;Technically, this is Ralphie's Thanksgiving story, and it's very fun and funny .
2451;"Bottom line, if you love ""A Christmas Story"" for all of it's great qualities beyond the Christmas stuff, then you will likely enjoy all the other Ralphie films too."
2452;All are fine films with great, nostalgic stories and casts, and all are narrated by the late, great Jean Shepherd.
2453;Though, you'll have to be net savvy to get the PBS films.
2454;Incidentally, I first saw all these films on the Disney Channel back when that channel was seriously good.
2455;Amazingly, they have done a great job capturing the look of the first (better than My Summer Story did, sadly).
2456;Shepherd and Clark are deceased (who in the world is narrating this, I wonder?)
2457;"Still, when I see the production values and the way they managed to capture the look of ""A Christmas Story"" in the trailer, I do wish they had somehow found a great writer and great actors for it."
2458;We shall see how it goes.
2459;A Christmas Story is a great holiday film.
2460;I always love this moive.
2461;We've watched Christmas Story for the past 20 years or so and found it to be a great Christmas tradition for the family.
2462;This movie is filled with nostalgic moments that will remind you of your childhood if you were born in the 50's!
2463;Good price and fast delivery.
2464;This has become a Christmas classic righ from the first year it was made.
2465;Few films can stand to be seen as many times as 'A Christmas Story'.
2466;If you grew up in the 50's or 60's this film will really bring back memories of being a kid at Christmas time, but anyone should be able to relate to this film.
2467;I avoided this film for a few years because TNT played this film continually for 24 hours every Christmas.
2468;I finally was ready for a viewing and what better day to do it?The film is a timeless classic brimming with the excitement of the holiday.
2469;"the two disc set is very nice with full and widescreen versions of the film included, There is also a fair amount of extras including commentary, trivia game, ""making of"" feature."
2470;I would have loved more depth in the making of feature.
2471;ette and not just the actors remarking on how much they liked making the film.
2472;merry Christmas everyone, from yours truly Dr Shock!
2473;What a fun, LOL Christmas movie.
2474;Christmas Story was hilarious back when I saw it in the theatre years ago, and also each of the many Christmas' since.
2475;My father loved it, I love it and my students on high school love it.
2476;Good clean humor that everyone can relate to.
2477;The humor is so insane and yet so funny because it's true.
2478;It's a great little investment.
2479;It was so highly recommended by MN Public Radio, et al.
2480;This movie is guaranteed to put you in the Christmas spirit, even if you do shoot your eye out with that brand.
2481;The story and filmography will make you think that this was a classic you grew up with as a kid.
2482;I remember thatIt is a good film, funny.
2483;How the status of the film has grownGood to have the film wide screen hereMy complaint is the extras are old.
2484;The absolute best of any of the Christmas movies.
2485;A heartwarming story of a family in the midwest several decades ago, covering much material that is not Christmas material.
2486;Terrific script and acting and camera work.
2487;"A real delight that deserves to overtake ""It's a Wonderful Life""."
2488;One of the best Holiday movie and it's fun to watch and I double dog dare ya to watch this movie.
2489;One of the best Christmas movies ever made.
2490;time favorite movie so there is absolutely nothing bad I can say about it!Set in the 1940's, the story revolves around Ralphie, a nine.year.
2491;The movie follows Ralphie, his friends, and family through hilarious adventures, most of them revolving around the bb gun.
2492;laughs abound in this movie and you can't help but cheer for Ralphie when he finally receives his coveted Christmas gift.

I:11001;2509;I'm so glad that I bought it.
I:11001;2510;It's a wonderful Christmas story that makes me feel warm and toasty about Christmas.
I:11001;2511;This movie captures the entire Christmas spirit in a comedic slice.
I:11001;2512;The dynamics of Ralph's family are universally understood, and the genuine nature of the story shone through the Christmas themes.
I:11001;2513;on perfect, including Darrin McGavin as the cantankerous Old Man and Peter Billingsley as the fearless hero Ralphie.
I:11001;2514;And best of all, it captures the highs and lows of the best holiday around.
I:11001;2515;This is one of the best comedies ever and a holiday staple.
I:11001;2516;This is my family's favorite Christmas movie every year.
I:11001;2517;I gave this to my son as a gift.
I:11001;2518;He loved it and watched it on Christmas Day with our family.
I:11001;2519;My grandsons and enjoyed watching it.
I:11001;2520;we'll watch it each year at Christmas time.
I:11001;2521;A Christmas Story is one of the funniest if not the funniest stories I've ever heard.
I:11001;2522;I am SO happy to oqn rhia two.
I:11001;2523;The movie captured perfectly all of the nuances of a midwestern, middle class childhood!
I:11001;2524;Best Christmas movie ever, bar none!
I:11001;2525;You must see this incredibly funny movie of the American Christmas tradition!
I:11001;2526;It was brilliant to set this movie in a time other than 1983.
I:11001;2527;the result is it feels fresher and without fad, just good old Christmas traditions intermixed with childhood angst, wonder, and surprise.
I:11001;2528;My family makes sure to watch this movie every year at Christmas time.
I:11001;2529;It makes us laugh and never gets old.
I:11001;2530;A truly hilarious and heart.
I:11001;2531;I had never seen it the whole way through, and thought no better way to experience it than on the big hidef screen.
I:11001;2532;Very good remastering, nice and clean"
2533;(My favorite Christmas movie is Die Hard.
2534;this is our all time favorite classic christmas movie.
2535;also to get the apron and cookie cutters in the collectors tin was great as well.
2536;we collect christmas story items and this was a wonderful addition.
2537;Definately a classic Christmas movie.
2538;This is the most favorite Christmas movie of all times because you usually end up watching it over and over and over!
2539;A classic for boomers that lusted after BB guns when they were youngsters.
2540;The acting was superb and story line works for any era.
2541;I am in love with this movie and am so excited about this collectors edition!
2542;A true must for A christmas story fans!
2543;One of the Best Christmas Movie ever.
2544;I watch it every year.
2545;This is a great Christmas movie.
2546;The movie is a classic.
2547;A Christmas Story is the brilliant spoof and satire of 'traditional' family life, set during the depression.
2548;A slew of calamities ensue that perfectly and poignantly capture all of the clich?
2549;a diligent waiter produces a cleaver and promptly decapitates the bird right in front of the whole family.
2550;Pixelization, aliasing and edge enhancement exist throughout.
2551;The audio is mono and nicely balanced.
2552;Quite enjoyable, and surprisingly funny.
2553;The service was good and it came quickly .
2554;We loved it then, and we love it now !
2555;it is one of our Christmas traditions.
2556;Just a good old Christmas comedy!
2557;The movie is pleasant enough, if a bit slow and outdated.
2558;It is a clean movie that you don't have to worry about with the children watching with you.
2559;this is a classic, and one of the best, christmas classics.
2560;"It is about a happy childhood, not a perfect family, so it is true to life
I:11001;2561;This is the funniest movie ever made period.
I:11001;2562;I dont see how anyone could not laugh at the hilarious exploits of nine.year.
I:11001;2563;If you wanna see the funniest movie ever made, you gotta get this one, because you will truly laugh your pants off.
I:11001;2564;A CHRISTMAS STORY is the only classic Christmas movie to be made since SCROOGE in 1970 and it deserves five stars or more for its humor, honest sentiment, satire and brilliant recreation of a past era in American history.
I:11001;2565;A promised """"documentary"""" which is really an 18 minute featurette, two five minute """"documentaries"""" on BB guns and leg lamps."""
2566;I'm out there with my buddy to celebrate Thanksgiving with his mother.
2567;Seldom have I enjoyed a movie so much.
2568;Now I can watch this movie anytime I want.
2569;A warm and funny family classic that is sure to get you into the holiday mood!
2570;I look forward to seeing this movie every Christmas.
2571;The collection with the stringing christmas lights are cute as well.
2572;I can rate the movie 5 stars, but the high def part is what this review is about.
2573;I absolutely Love this movie, esp during Holiday Seasons!!
2574;And even though it takes place in the 30's or 40's, it sure brings back wonderful memories of my own childhood Christmases!!
2575;Probably as timeless of an American Christmas story for little boys as there could ever be.
2576;I considered this movie a must see modern Christmas season tradition since early and frequent childhood exposure.
2577;My kids loved it and my wife offers no objections to bar A Christmas Story from becoming a family tradition.
2578;I ordered this item thinking it was a 2.
2579;I will be sending this back.
2580;Takes you back to that time.
2581;I watch it every year.
2582;It is a cute movie but a bit overhyped.
2583;Parts of it are very funny but the funniest scenes are the ones you have seen in reviews .
2584;It is always a favorite in our house!
2585;I absolutely love this movie and they only play it on Christmas eve.

2613;good remake of the movie
2614;Hard to believe that this year marks 25 years we were introduced to young Ralphie and the quest for his air power rifle.
2615;It is still a fun filled movie for the entire family.
2616;A Christmas Story is delightful all the way.
2617;Fast forward 25 years later to 2008, Peter Billingsley is the man behind another successful Christmas movie.
2618;I've read In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash, which the movie is taken from, and it was good, but the movie is one you'll watch every year.
2619;It is hilarious with a few heart.
2620;Two thumbs way way up!
2621;This movie is a True classic and a timeless piece of absolute perfection that EVERYONE should own.

2627;That's how good it is!
2628;My older brother, who is 79, even sets up a Christmas Story display of the movie set with houses and everything during the holiday season.
2629;It is as much a part of the holidays as A Christmas Carol by Dickens.
2630;Myself and my daughters love it, while my wife hates it.
2631;This movies is the best!
2632;It is a family classic and will forever be in your heart when you watch it for the first time or the hundredth time!
2633;got this for grandchildren and sat and watched it with them it brought back so many memories of my youth.
2634;One of the few holiday classics that just seems to get better every time I watch it.
2635;A true Christmas classic, offbeat as it is, gets better with every viewing.
2636;A definite must for your holiday viewing library.
2637;The all time most favorite movie ever!
2638;It's iconic in the Christmas season and the catch phrase you'll shoot your eye out is one of the best known phrases ever!
2639;i love this movie and watch it as often as I can!
2640;to bring in the holiday season with this movie.
2641;always was 5 stars, always will be.
2642;This is great family entertainment.
2643;ups alike will want to make this movie a Christmas tradition.
2644;This is the absolute best Xmas movie, especially if you can watch it uncut with no commercial breaks.
2645;If you've never seen this (hard to believe) do yourself a favor and watch it this year and it'll become an annual tradition.
2646;"Narrated brilliantly by Jean Shepherd and based on his childhood memoirs, In God We Trust: All Others Pay Cash, A Christmas Story (1983) has truly become a splendid holiday favorite classic rivaling in its popularity Frank Capra's masterwork ""It's a Wonderful Life""."
2647;set in the 1940's, director Bob Clark managed to capture the essence of childhood Christmas through the eyes of Ralphie, an unwittingly comical child whose imaginative character is both endearing and enduring.
2648;like awe and obsession of a tacky woman's leg lamp he had won in a contest.
2649;"aside from ""you'll shoot your eye out"", the film is filled with memorable lines including Ralphie's major swear words ""Oh, fudge ."
2650;The film appeals to all ages, but adults may find it especially amusing since it lets us look back and laugh at our own childhood.
2651;This movie is a Christmas tradition for my family, we watch every year!
2652;Appropriate for kids and has humor for all ages.
2653;This movie story by Jean Shepherd is a must.
2654;He speaks of life as it was in the 1940's and 50's.
2655;"I recommend ""A Christmas Story"" as the one to see every Christmastime."
2656;I love the house also.
2657;Growing up I used to love this movie so much, they used to put it on a 24 hour marathon on the TNT Channel, and I'd keep it going all day.
2658;It really is one of the best holiday films ever, if you have yet to see it I'd definitely give it a go.
2659;It's become a tradition in my home that I watch this movie every Christmas Season.
2660;A Christmas Story is one of the greatest 'seasonal' movies ever made.
2661;western kid with cowboy dreams and real life ho.
2662;More than just children will love this movie as I myself 'feel like a kid again' every year watching this great classic.
2663;This is a great movie!
2664;Funny, witty, coming of age and just pure fun to watch and laugh.
2665;This movie will take you back to those happy Christmas memories of your childhood.
2666;We watch this movie every year at Christmas and it puts us in the Christmas spirit.
2667;we can all relate to someone in this witty flick, and the kid with an inner voice sharing his every thought
2668;tnx fer bringing back good memories.
2669;you'll laugh, you'll cry, and you'll hug those around you as you watch the crazy christmas comedy.
2670;It's about that time again!
2671;America's most beloved Christmas tale is back and BETTER than ever!
2672;For the first time, A Christmas Story is getting the full treatment in an all new 20th Anniversary 2 Disc Special Edition!
2673;For the first time, fans young and old will get a chance to see the film in WIDESCREEN along with it's standard Full.
2674;For our family this movie has become a tradition to watch during the holidays.
2675;There are so many great and funny scenes in it that we love to see over and over.
2676;This movie is a classic.
2677;i thought that it was good to see Peter Billingsly as he is now.
2678;I could see that he and his fellow co stars had a great time doing the film.
2679;i even thought that it was great to see how that outrageous leg lamp was made.
2680;There is always a next time.
2681;i thought that the film looked sharp and crisp.
2682;The commentary was really cool, and I thought that the 20th Anniversery release of this film was better then expected.
2683;I hope that some of you will give this new release a chance and Just injoy it.
2684;A Christmas Story is more than funny, however, it is also touching, a true slice of post.
2685;wWII America, and a touchstone for the season.
2686;Will he die of Lifeboy poisoning before the holiday?The film has great timing more than anything else, and the fade.
2687;it will be a seasonal regular.
2688;All other streaming works fine with the PS3.
2689;This holiday flick definitely ranks in the Top Ten Christmas films of all time, but it caters to a unique audience.
2690;The sense of humor is succinct (not subtle) and the acting definitely outlines the minds and thoughts of many during the Christmas season.
2691;and the excitement of opening presents early on Christmas morn, will love this film.
2692;I believe the best acting performance is turned in by Melinda Dillion (Mom).
2693;She is the most believable.
2694;Child star Peter Billingsley is cute as a blonde, blue.
2695;but Melinda wins the show.
2696;A must during the Christmas season, this film is funny and will warm your heart.
2697;I'm surprised I waited so long to watch this gem.
2698;The most perfect imperfect Christmas movie.
2699;This year, we introduced a new generation to it.
2700;My daughter discovered this movie this year and wants to watch it and talk about it over and over.
2701;What a fun family film.
2702;It is a classic and I love it.
2703;For me, this is a childhood favorite!
2704;I love how it has the classic look of the 40's!
2705;"In case you are new, I'll give you a brief synopsis
I:11001;2706;If you love Christmas, comedies, and classics, you'll love A CHRISTMAS STORY!!!
I:11001;2707;I did snicker at two lines in the movie, and it was interesting to go back to the times when kids sat around the radio with decoder pins as their form of entertainment.
I:11001;2708;But those three times I just mentioned, well that took up about 1 minute of the whole movie.
I:11001;2709;Now THAT was a funny movie!!
I:11001;2710;This was a good movie.
I:11001;2711;This is a great movie and it was delivered really fast.
I:11001;2712;I definitely would recommend it to anyone and all.
I:11001;2713;The price is fair, and if a souped.
I:11001;2714;It is now a family tradition to watch A Christmas Story every year.
I:11001;2715;A timeless classic that I had to have.
I:11001;2716;Hilarious every year since I first saw it almost 30 years ago.
I:11001;2717;Best Christmas story on film, well written, well acted.
I:11001;2718;And it is very realistic .
I:11001;2719;great movie to watch year round!
I:11001;2720;kids will love it and watch it all day!
I:11001;2721;its a christmas classicnothingeverybody should watch a christmas story and yes i did tell people about how great this movie is
I:11001;2722;This is a movie must see for our family each Christmas season, a cute movie about a kid and his family in the 50's and how they spend their Christmas.
I:11001;2723;nevertheless, it is a charming story about average people, having average exeriences, in an often hilarious way.
I:11001;2724;There are even several good life.
I:11001;2725;watch it with your kids, and make sure your moral teaching isn't undermined.
I:11001;2726;It will be much more enjoyable together, anyway.
I:11001;2727;This was a gift to myself.
I:11001;2728;I have loved this movie for years.
I:11001;2729;It is for all ages.
I:11001;2730;The cookbook inside is wonderful.
I:11001;2731;Is has great pictures and also sayings from the movie and great pictures.
I:11001;2732;I love the apron that came with the set also.
I:11001;2733;My whole family loves this movie .
I:11001;2734;it has become for us a classic right up with A Wonderful Life, and one we enjoy watching together every year at Christmas time.
I:11001;2735;This is movie that can be watched and enjoyed for years.
I:11001;2736;Nice remaster, and we enjoy watching it every year.
I:11001;2737;Ralphie's dad is definitely my father and I believe that is why I love this movie.
I:11001;2738;This one is a Christmas favorite at our house.
I:11001;2739;Now we won't have to wait for it to come on the TV channels, we can watch it all through the Christmas season!
I:11001;2740;A family classic full of humor and fun about the realities of Christmas.
I:11001;2741;Still true today and never outdates itself.
I:11001;2742;Takes me back to when I was young.
I:11001;2743;Would recommend to everyone !
I:11001;2744;I have seen this movie so many times and I still laugh at certain parts every single time I see it.
I:11001;2745;I just love that it's now one of my kids favorites, too!!
I:11001;2746;Great way to snuggle up and watch this Christmas classic!
I:11001;2747;The whole ensemble was a big hit !!
I:11001;2748;Glad she did because now it's one of my favorite Xmas movies.
I:11001;2749;A fun movie about about Christmas and life before battery powered toys and mass merchandising.
I:11001;2750;The story is based on a very memorable family.
I:11001;2751;If you ever wondered where the idea for the leg lamps for sale at Christmas time came from, this movie will give you the answer.
I:11001;2752;One memorable Christmas in the life of a nine.year.
I:11001;2753;old in 1940's Indiana makes for a memorable movie and reflections on the innocence of youth in """"A Christmas Story,"""" directed by Bob Clark and starring young Peter Billingsley, Darren McGavin and Melinda Dillon."""
2754;"To young Ralphie Parker (Billingsley), it's simple
I:11001;2755;Reasoning and wisdom to which there is simply no argument.
I:11001;2756;We also discover how Ralphie learned a valuable lesson about how the journey is often the best part of the goal finally realized (courtesy of a """"Little Orphan Annie"""" secret decoder ring), and the real meaning of a """"Major Award."""""""
2757;"McGavin is perfectly cast as Ralphie's dad, ""The Old Man,"" as he is referred to affectionately, and he gives just the right touch to all of the small ironies of life that seem to surround him, while Dillon gives a winning performance as his mom, whose TLC nurtured the warm memories from which this story was born."
2758;There is an engaging naturalness about him that makes an instant connection with the audience, for he personifies the child in all of us, and it's a character you'll remember for as long as you retain any memories of your own childhood.
2759;"A heartwarming, funny film, ""A Christmas Story"" is a true classic that can be enjoyed again and again and will most likely become an annual event once you've experienced it."
2760;I am glad it finally got the special edition treatment.
2761;This is an American film classic.
2762;It certainly is not a perfect film, but it is endearing.
2763;The settings are great, and it truly feels like you are transported back in time.
2764;The acting is first rate all the way around.
2765;This is a new classic.
2766;Not many movies in the past 30 years can compete with this wonderful Christmas movie.
2767;If you were born before 1965 you will probably be able to relate.
2768;Very funny and well done.
2769;No, this is not an AWARD winning movie, but it is definitely a tradition in my family.
2770;So many funny scenes to be watched year after year.
2771;It is truly a movie that males and females of every age can enjoy.
2772;Having 48 hours in which to view the movie is also a great feature.
2773;This is a classic Christmas story, and because it is told from a young boys point of view it will always be one.
2774;This is a classic must have Christmas movie in your Christmas collection.
2775;This movie is filled with laughs.
2776;This is a classic and we watch it every year.
2777;Would recommend this for every family.
2778;"For most of my adult life my favorite Christmas story has been Charles Dickens classic scenario ""A Christmas Carol"" written in 1843 and which still remains as one of my favorite Christmas classics."
2779;up front, I must confess that this classic movie was indeed shot and is deeply ensconced into the very fabric of Cleveland culture.
2780;the story itself remains a classic in American culture.
2781;world War II America presents itself.
2782;The actual beginning of life in America as it should be.
2783;In fact Ralphie experienced life on the upswing.
2784;"The Christmas morning scene in which the ""Old Man"" stated that he got a BB gun at Ralphie's age shows the end of the depression and the start of the ""good times""."
2785;However as we watch this movie we can see that discipline 7 decades ago was very real.
2786;Life was simple and fraught with troubles but in the end, life had meaning and purpose.
2787;this story shows us a piece of Americana never to be seen again.
2788;This is a favorite at our house every holiday season.
2789;My wife LOVES this movie.
2790;He faces bullies and his family dynamics in a comical, yet sensitive way.
2791;Not even the added features were very good, useful, or entertaining.
2792;You do get to see the actors twenty years later, and a bit of commentary on the making of the movie is mildly interesting.
2793;It is a great story especially for an old guy that grew up in the forties.
2794;But the best part of the story was the leg lamp, and the Chineese Christmas dinner.
2795;This is sure to be a much watched classic for the Christmas season
2796;It is a blend of humor and pathos, taking us back to those wonder years when all we wanted was to be a part of EVERYTHING!
2797;It's all about reliving those golden years of childhood, with the highs and lows that often followed one another quite closely.
2798;This film captures the essence of family and friends, the magic of Christmas and our association with the gifts it brings, and the things that we remember (both good and bad) about our early days.
2799;A true classic!Made to enjoy while sitting in your favorite recliner with the safety belt fastened .
2800;or you'll roll on the floor laughing!
2801;hopefully the movie will come before next Christmas.
2802;They Say it's The Number 1 Movie on The block.
2803;This is a classic for any fan of Holiday films.
2804;Well worththe time to see, any season of the year.
2805;I watch it at least twice every Christmas.
2806;My receiver does a pretty good job of post mixing this to 7.2, but I'm sure the studio could have done a better job with the track.
2807;it is a family tradition at our house.
2808;Own it for your own!
2809;Few other Christmas movies have so little to do with Christmas, but so much to do with the joys and pains of childhood.
2810;"Most people will find instant connections, and hours of laughter with the bizarrely unique characters of ""A Christmas Story."""
2811;What an amazingly funny family story.
2812;Revisiting the movie annually at Christmas time with my children will help reinforce some of my family values.
2813;Each year, during the holiday season, I so look forward to once again settling down to enjoy this wonderful Christmas classic!
2814;It's funny how this little made.
2815;We've all pretty much memorized but still laugh at it every year when it comes time to see it again.
2816;It brings back memories of Christmas for anyone that grew up in the 1940's or the 1950's.
2817;This is easily my favorite christmas movie ever.
2818;This is a must for anybody who likes funny movies.
2819;A Christmas Story is another must watch movie at Christmas time.
2820;Such a classic, and it's wonderful that it comes from a child's perspective.
2821;But nooooo, the wife, the kids, and the grandkids have to see this one a few times every Christmas season.
2822;I still enjoy watching this movie.
2823;How can one enjoy the Christmas season without viewing this outstanding movie.
2824;Nostalgic, good clean family fun.
2825;This movie is so well done it will go down in history as one of the top ten Christmas movies.
2826;I'm not a Lifetime Channel kind of guy and this is not that type of movie, but it is heartwarming, funny, nostalgic, clean, and entertaining for young and old alike.
2827;The raves that dominate among the customer reviews here tend to go too far, but still this is a wonderful little movie, brimming with wit, insight, rich characterization and period detail.
2828;(There are heartwarming moments as well, applaudably noncloying.)
2829;What you get is a wry look at the (more or less) real life of a little middle.
2830;This is my all time favorite Christmas movie.
2831;I watched it Christmas Eve with my grandson and he loved it.
2832;The joy of Christmas should be experienced all year.
2833;And I like Christmas movies, well most, except for this one.
2834;A true classic, in the best sense of the word.
2835;I have seen this movie nearly every year since it first came out on the big screen 20 years ago.
2836;All the classic comic moments remain hilarious even now.
2837;The movie had a beautiful feel of nostalgia when it came out, and it has the same feel today.
2838;Innocent in all the best ways.
2839;I can mention it to people who think high.
2840;"titles, and they ""ooooh"" with misty eyes at their favorite memories."
2841;It's one of the leanest, meanest movies you'll ever see.
2842;peter Billingsley as Ralphie is perfect in the role.
2843;This kid is almost as big an icon of Christmas entertainment as the Grinch!
2844;Darren McGavin, a favorite of mine, is just terrific as the crusty father with the flair for expletives.
2845;Try to watch this every Christmas season.
2846;Further, it is a delightful journey.
2847;I would recommend it to anyone .
2848;This movie is truly timeless.
2849;"I would recommend it for a night of warm feelings and lots of laughter
I:11001;2850;We watch it every year at christmas time with the grand kids and they get a kick out of it as much as we do
I:11001;2851;What I like most about this film is the way it brings me back to the childhood days of Christmas.
I:11001;2852;If you still remember the awe and magic of getting that special gift, you'll enjoy watching this movie bring it to life.
I:11001;2853;billingsley is wonderful and will have you rolling .
I:11001;2854;And to me, that's what makes this movie a classic .
I:11001;2855;It's a classic Christmas story from a kids point of view.
I:11001;2856;The kids and the adults are totally natural.
I:11001;2857;It puts you in a good mood, makes you laugh out loud.
I:11001;2858;It captures real life situations and memories of days gone by.
I:11001;2859;Recommend this movie to all, very enjoyable for all ages.
I:11001;2860;A Christmas Story is one of the true classics of American Cinema.
I:11001;2861;A brilliant cast is directed by veteran director Bob Clark.
I:11001;2862;In the end Dad turns out to be way more of a softy than we would have ever taken him for, and Ralphie has the best Christmas ever, despite the 'Bumpus hounds' devouring their Christmas dinner.
I:11001;2863;Also included is a fun trivia game (I got one question wrong), and the mini documentaries A History of the Daisy Red Ryder, and Get a Leg Up, which irrevocably demonstrates that humor is alive and well in America.
I:11001;2864;It reminds us of our childhood Christmas!
I:11001;2865;And so it happens that the media moguls have conspired once again to recreate yet another of our national traditions: the annual reprise of a motion picture that has been blessed and certified by the entertainment industry as a classic.
I:11001;2866;But this time, the moguls got it right.
I:11001;2867;A Christmas Story is fast becoming a Christmas tradition, where families gather around the television to enjoy the warm sentiments and precise humor that decorate this film much as they would gather around the Christmas tree to open presents.
I:11001;2868;And the reason is simple.
I:11001;2869;A Christmas Story brings us back in touch with our youth and the time of our life when we could daydream, feel carefree and unbridled.
I:11001;2870;I have never seen another film that so perfectly captures the unassuming, innocent imagination of a child and portray it on screen.
I:11001;2871;And the scene with Ralphie and Santa Claus in the shopping mall is so side.
I:11001;2872;But if we should ever need a quick reminder, we can always look to Linus in A Charlie Brown Christmas.
I:11001;2873;This was the perfect gift for family fun this year and hopefully years to come.
I:11001;2874;The timeless telling of Christmas time through the eyes of a child with a little Walter Mitty in him.
I:11001;2875;A must see every year.
I:11001;2876;I live in Cleveland and this is one of the sites we visited!!
I:11001;2877;You can go on a tour and even take your own pics!
I:11001;2878;A Christmas Story is a lovely movie sure to boost up one's holiday spirit.
I:11001;2879;It's an excellent movie for families to watch together in their living rooms on Christmas Day.
I:11001;2880;the movie takes place during the holiday season of the 1940s and is about a nine.year.
I:11001;2881;a Christmas Story is the movie I would definitely recommend for people to watch whenever the holiday season comes.
I:11001;2882;i did'nt think the movie industry could produce a movie with such simple charm.
I:11001;2883;for me it was so special.
I:11001;2884;old classic that I had to show my kids.
I:11001;2885;They loved it and my wife and I enjoy it like it's the first time we are seeing it every time.
I:11001;2886;I would recommend this movie to anyone and I think it should be considered as a must.
I:11001;2887;see in modern holiday movie libraries.
I:11001;2888;This is by far my favorite holiday movie.
I:11001;2889;Ralphie is an All American kid in search of an official Red Ryder, carbine action, two.
I:11001;2890;hundred shot range model air rifle .
I:11001;2891;One of the best all time Christmas movies.
I:11001;2892;Good gut busting adventures of a young boy and quest for the ultimate Christmas prize.
I:11001;2893;Great movie, but come on Amazon really, $2.99 for a movie this old?
I:11001;2894;Appropriate for the whole family.
I:11001;2895;This has to be one of the best christmas movie I've ever seen.
I:11001;2896;it's nice to see this classic in semi.
I:11001;2897;To see it being considered a classic and have such a high rating is beyond me.
I:11001;2898;i love comedy but please.
I:11001;2899;Enjoyed watching the movie with our grandchildren.
I:11001;2900;We live in Cleveland, Ohio so the connection with Cleveland added to our interest.
I:11001;2901;TMC often have it as a marathon on Christmas.
I:11001;2902;This is my favorite comedy movie.
I:11001;2903;I'll keep the VHS version for now.
I:11001;2904;I hate to say anything bad about this film because it is a great film.
I:11001;2905;I watch it every year for Christmas.
I:11001;2906;I'll rate the product, but I won't provide a testimony for it.
I:11001;2907;The family enjoys it every year and it never gets old.
I:11001;2908;Watched this with our kids and now watching it with the grandchildren.
I:11001;2909;Lots of fun to enjoy as a family tradition!!
I:11001;2910;Great movie that we watch every Christmas along with A Child's Christmas in Wales and It's a Wonderful Life.
I:11001;2911;I agree with a prior poster who said A Christmas Story may be the funniest movie they've ever seen.
I:11001;2912;our fam watches this each year at Christmas and we laugh until we turn colors and roll off the couch.
I:11001;2913;stop adjustments to the coal furnace damper is a classic.
I:11001;2914;That alone is worth the price of the movie.
I:11001;2915;That man has a gift.
I:11001;2916;from Dad, but instead, he gives up a friend as the culprit and the scene that follows is so very funny.
I:11001;2917;It is satire at its best but on the cutting edge of truth.
I:11001;2918;this Christmas, I gave The Christmas STory away as a gift to several friends and family.
I:11001;2919;It is a classic unlike any other.
I:11001;2920;It has some really good one liners, but other than that it's kind of slow and pointless.
I:11001;2921;This was a gift for a friend, they loved it.
I:11001;2922;Any age group would enjoy it.
I:11001;2923;and for a great price.
I:11001;2924;What can be said, an instant xmas classic, my 5 year old loves it, it's a must see every year!
I:11001;2925;My favorite part is when they have Christmas dinner at the Chinese restaurant.
I:11001;2926;star rating, but it's still enjoyable.
I:11001;2927;No holiday season is perfect without at least one viewing of A Christmas Story.
I:11001;2928;This is my very favorite movie and a must see during the Holidays!
I:11001;2929;Fun to see the olden days!
I:11001;2930;Our family makes it a point to watch this movie every Christmas.
I:11001;2931;A family tradition in our house to watch.
I:11001;2932;Basing my review on a love for the movie as a whole.

I:11001;2938;It's a great, funny, nostalgic movie.
I:11001;2939;Every year we laugh at the precious leg lamp in the window.
I:11001;2940;Even though we older ones can relate better to the movie, I think people of all ages, including children, can enjoy the humor in it.
I:11001;2941;Comparable to The sound of music .
I:11001;2942;My kids ask to watch it year round (age 4 and 6) I remember this movie when I was a child and I still love it!

2964;I watched this with great reluctance, and found myself absolutely loving it!
2965;A Christmas Story is a 1983 movie that has become a Christmas classic.
2966;This wonderful movie that takes place in the 1940's is about 9 year Ralphie, played by Peter Billingsley, and his dream of receiving a genuine Red Ryder 200.
2967;this movie is funny and very entertaining.
2968;It reminds you of your past Christmas' and those special memories that you'll cherish forever.
2969;The acting and directing of this film is superb.

2974;I can see why it has become a classic.
2975;I just love this movie!

2979;24 hours straight of this incredibly realistic and comic view of a boys' life at the age of 9 during (what I'm guessing is) the early 50s.
2980;A hallarious movie for everyone!
2981;He only likes very, very creative kid's films.
2982;It's a family favorite and this company sent it so speedy.
2983;I wanted our son moved to Seattle to get by Christmas and I think it will arrive by then.
2984;Mom, Dad and all the kids in it are great but Ralphie is top.
2985;Was a gift for my daughter and family.
2986;the movie is excellent, a Christmas classic (see below).

2993;A History of the Daisy Red Ryder featurette, on the object of great desire's actual history.
2994;now, about the really good stuff, the movie.
2995;A Christmas Story is that odd film that appeals to a cross.
2996;Fans of sweet Christmas cheer are happily joined by people with a more jaundiced eye to the holiday.
2997;To be sure, the movie leans more to the sweet than the sour, but it has enough edge and good.
2998;It conveys a genuinely warm nostalgia and some sharp, sometimes pretense.
2999;deflating observations about human nature.
3000;(That is, a BB gun, a very particular one.)
3001;"He plans carefully well in advance how to lay the groundwork for this while avoiding the dreaded rebuff, but almost everyone says it anyway: ""You'll put your eye out!"""
3002;The relentless struggle for the one true gift develops alongside several other small stories and amusing details, a tongue.
3003;this movie, made in 1983, has gradually become a favorite Christmas classic, now shown in an annual 24.
3004;If you've never seen it, give it a try, even if you have a little Scrooge in you, and you'll probably enjoy it.
3005;I have loved watching this movie every year since I first saw it.
3006;I finally got around to seeing ACS2 and actually felt they did a good job.
3007;Love to see it every year for the holidays go it this year.
3008;This movie puts me in the Christmas spirit year.
3009;Throw in some school bullies, a wild imagination, and plenty of Christmas spirit, and you end up with the wonderful mix that is A Christmas Story.
3010;This is a gentle, heartwarming, humorous tale of Christmas.
3011;Lighten up the holiday season with this hilarious and heartwarming holiday classic.
3012;An almost magical story based on narrator Jean Sheapard's childhood adventures, this one is a classic in my family and should definately be one in yours.
3013;If you don't know the fear of a triple dog dare or the embarrassment of a young boy in a bunny suit you are MISSING OUT!
3014;This film features great performances from Peter Billingsly as young cynic Ralphie, who only wants one thing for Christmas: A Red Rider BB Gun and Melinda Dillon as the American mom not to mention the father and Ralphie's hysterical little brother ( Show Mommy how the piggies eat! )
3015;It also makes great use of the 'Peter and the Wolf' symphony.
3016;The film just stands out as a holiday classic because it's nostalgic air is so realisticly dreamy.
3017;There are charming and understanding moments (when the Mom sticks the soap in her mouth comes to mind) and all of Ralphie's daydreams are whimsical childhood fantasies.

3028;His memoirs take place in my home town.
3029;Seeing this movie is wonderful because I know these people and these places.
3030;They have been modified, of course, to make this wonderful film, but I still go to Flick's Tap on Hohman Avenue!
3031;It was a great film that brought my town into light.
3032;This is a must see timeless tradition!
3033;This movie makes me laugh.
3034;This is a MUST SEE family movie!
3035;I watched this film growing up, and to this day I LOVE it!

3037;It brings back memories, makes me feel at home, and brings a smile to my face.
3038;What a fantastic, all American, classic Christmas movie.
3039;My family and I originally viewed the film because we were from Cleveland, Ohio, where part of the picture was filmed.
3040;Darren McGavin is one of my favorite actors, and he does a wonderful job as the father of the young lad who wants a Red Ryder rifle.
3041;This production is a heart.

3043;It is delightful to watch and I highly recommend it for a look back at Christmas in a time past.
3044;This is a good family movie.
3045;It is great to watch when the weather outside keeps you in the house.
3046;Being born in 1948,this movie brings back many fond memories of that time and how we lived back in the 40's and 50's and how special Christmas was for us during this time period.
3047;this movie is a great escape from the sick world we now have to live in.
3048;hope other's can do that,too.
3049;"I especially enjoyed the part when Ralph's father won the ""Leg Lamp""."
3050;This is a fun great story!

3052;disc special for the widescreen version.
3053;There are two kinds of people in this world.
3054;This is one of our family's Christmas favorites.
3055;How believable and true can a movie get .

3108;It think it's very cute.
3109;I enjoy watching it all the time.
3110;I think the kids did great in the movie.
3111;This is one of the funniest family films I have ever seen.
3112;don't be misled by the director (famous for Porky's ), this is a family film.
3113;There is one expletive used, which quite frankly could have been snipped in my opinion, but the overall feel of this film is one of innocence, adventure and fond Christmas memories.
3114;I watch this film every year and laugh myself sick everytime I do.
3115;darren McGavin's performance provides some of the most hilarious laughs.
3116;This movie will be enjoyed by all ages for years to come.
3117;let's hope Warner Bros. is listening and they put together a definitive edition.
3118;The item is even more beautiful than anticipated.
3119;The movie is a sweet look at a Christmas in the past.
3120;The movie is funny and has a great ending!
3121;I would recommend it to my family and friends.
3122;"It a A tradition in our house to watch it as many times as possible between Thanksgiving and C. mas
I:11001;3123;Holiday classic in our home!
I:11001;3124;live and share so many childhood memories.
I:11001;3125;hand with It's A Wonderful Life, the other 'chestnut' that everyone has seen at least a million times.
I:11001;3126;the gift that keeps on giving.
I:11001;3127;For those of you who can't read, Amazon has even included pretty pictures and a video showing this.
I:11001;3128;The green tin can was in perfect condition, as well were the lights.
I:11001;3129;All lights work and the leg lamps look great, they'll go nicely on my desktop Christmas tree at work this year.
I:11001;3130;This is a great family movie for young and old and with me, my children, and now grandchildren it will most likely always be a part of our Christmas tradition.
I:11001;3131;I call """"A Christmas Story"""" the 2nd greatest Christmas movie of all time because in my opinion """"National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"""" is the greatest Christmas movie of all time."""
3132;now that I've gotten that out of the way, let's start the review!
3133;This is a movie that unlike others, actually captures the true spirit of Christmas in every way possible.
3134;What makes this film really stand out is how it is told through the eyes and mind of a child.
3135;You'll notice right off the bat, that the film does have a narrator, an older Ralphie.
3136;But unlike other films, the narrator fits perfectly into the Christmas formula.
3137;There are extremely popular films that I have resisted watching for one reason or another.

3142;The Christmas Story is THE best Christmas film EVER made.
3143;right next to Christmas Vacation is my opinion.
3144;this is great to watch around Christmas time,or any ol time of the year.
3145;This indy flick from the 80's quickly made it as one of the Christmas classics.
3146;I first saw this movie as a child, and i have been scarred ever since.
3147;I have also developed an aversion to full.
3148;i have since found a new therapist.

3170;There are moments that are funny like the scene where the kid sticks his tongue on the lamp post in below freezing teperatures or the lead kid getting sent down the chute by Santa Claus.
3171;Other than that, it's at best, an average movie that serves it's purpose for the holiday.
3172;Best Christmas classic, hands down.
3173;Could watch it 10 times during the holiday season, so many great scenes keep me laughing

3190;My father loved this movie so I bought for him to enjoy anytime he wanted to watch it!

3200;As many times as I've watched this movie, I still laughed aloud!
3201;This is a classic movie for Christmas the whole family can share and love.
3202;I just love it and so do my children, grandchildren, great grandchildren and all other little ones that come my way.

3212;each time Xmas season comes around!
3213;By far, my favorite Christmas movie.
3214;Very nostalgic, and my family loves it.
3215;It's one of the funniest Christmas movies I've seen!
3216;This movie is so hilarious and it arrived in perfect condition on time for the holidays so the family could watch it together.
3217;Technicians have to cut off the sides of the film and enlarge it to give it that square, full.
3218;I am sharing it as a gift with another family that has never seen this wonderful holiday movie!!
3219;What's to say, this movie has become a tradition at our house.
3220;A simpler time in life!
3221;So, for me it is a nostalgic experience.
3222;For laughs, love and a particular Christmas spirit this movie cannot be beat.
3223;This is a classic Christmas story movie.
3224;Fun for us to watch over and over again.
3225;Bought this to keep in our classic movie sections on our shelves.
3226;I bought this for my wife, who loves this movie.
3227;She loved the cookie cutters and apron.
3228;A vivid portrayal of the thoughts and dreams of a young boy at Christmas growing up in the backdrop of classic Americana.
3229;Good Christmas movies have universal appeal.
3230;One thoughtful critic argued, correctly, that my review lacked specificity and perspective.
3231;of course, each of us brings to a movie his personal experience.
3232;Just the hint of such a relationship makes me recoil.
3233;by contrast, the children are endearing.
3234;But this is less a credit to the movie than a tribute to the general sweetness of youth.
3235;(A child's wish for a gift and his joy in receiving it are natural.
3236;The hallmark of a great Christmas story .
3237;From this emanates the hope and magic of Christmas.
3238;His comedies are as funny today (in Indiana and India) as they were centuries ago.
3239;A Christmas Story, by contrast, is parochial.
3240;The vignettes are amusing only to those with similar experiences.
3241;For me this is right up there with Its a Wonderful Life for Christmas viewing.
3242;I watched it for years before I learned about the writer/narrator Jean Shepherd, who was a remarkable talk radio host in the 50's.70's and spun stories about his youth and daily observations on life and distilled a lot of that into this masterpiece.
3243;This movie is just as rich and charming, great family viewing and like a great cartoon, plenty of subtlety for the grown ups to laugh over.
3244;If Roger gives it a high rating I usually do too.
3245;This is true for most films on his Great Movies list.
3246;I watched A Christmas Story for the first time this week and really enjoyed it.
3247;I will be watching it again.
3248;This film is now rightly one of the Christmas classics.
3249;I remember when I was a kid how much I loved this movie.
3250;Watching this movie brought back some very happy memories from my childhood!!!
3251;Brew up a cup of hot cocoa and enjoy the show!
3252;I bought the VHS for them to enjoy this holiday season!
3253;My wife and I love this movie.
3254;i even bought my wife the leg lamp.
3255;This movie probably appeals to the baby boomers more than anything, but it's a great movie for the holiday time of the year.
3256;moving but the actors really make the characters in the film.
3257;It definitely was a simpler time, things weren't as complicated and it's nice to have that gentle reminder.
3258;See this with your family, it's a delight!
3259;Watch it with a bunch of people and remember.
3260;We watch this movie several times each season and we love it.
3261;I got my son a BB gun for Christmas and the first time I shot it, the BB bounced straight back and hit the post about 3 inches from my eye.
3262;The movie, the lamp and a few uttered stinklefifers are a Christmas tradition with my family.
3263;this leads us into the magical world of MGM's A Christmas Story.
3264;a very strong cast keeps this fast paced action comedy adventure true to the written word.
3265;a all time holiday classic worth the watch.
3266;So good a feature one station plays the film non.
3267;Bob Clark's A Christmas Story is a cinematic slice of Americana.
3268;A Christmas Story does a wonderful job of recreating a certain place and time.
3269;screen Christmas features, A Christmas Story places somewhere in the middle of the pack.
3270;You can't but laugh your head off as you fallow along as Little Ralphie counts down until that big morning to see if his beloved Red.
3271;This is one move I can highly recommend for a good laugh and a good time.
3272;Wonderful movie for the entire family.
3273;It's definitely a Must see and a Must have for All Ages.
3274;Must see every year during the Christmas holiday season.
3275;But A Christmas Story has always retained its charm.
3276;"Like most ""holiday classics,"" it's about the Christmas that we always hope that we will have."
3277;"It probably goes without saying that this is a ""sweet"" movie."
3278;this film has become a holiday classic.
3279;I recommend it to anyone who has not seen it.
3280;This classic Christmas story will bring out the little kid in you.
3281;The childhood memories will flood back and you will not be able to control your giddy anticipation of what Christmas might bring this year.
3282;It is by far one of the best movies I have ever seen.
3283;Very funny, sweet and great for the entire family.
3284;This is the best Christmas movie ever (imho).
3285;You can have It's A Wonderful Life.
3286;I have a full size leg lamp that is in my window the day after Halloween and through New Years, every year.
3287;A Christmas Story, It's a Wonderful Life, A Christmas Carol (George C. Scott version), and The Nativity Story.
3288;They're all favorites but this one is the most fun.
3289;I did enjoy the lamp though.
3290;It is a great movie for anyone from 4 to 104 or more to enjoy every season.
3291;I really enjoy this movie and sometimes during our Thanksgiving and Christmas rush I somehow miss the showing of the CHRISTMAS STORY on TV.
3292;Our children watched it and loved every minute of it.
3293;This is one of the gifts we give to our friends for Christmas!
3294;So I bought this blu ray for my husband, he was extremely excited to still have this classic movie to watch around Christmas time.
3295;This movie is a classic, but we just watched it.
3296;The boy who plays the main character is delightful, as is the rest of the cast.
3297;Its one of those movies that we watch every year, even though TBS does a marathon of it near Christmas.
3298;Both are a lot better than the VHS version.
3299;I have yet to watch it, its not close enough to Christmas yet!
3300;we were very pleased with the price.
3301;It was the perfect gift for a Christmas Story fan!
3302;This movie embodies almost every family in one way or so and I always look forward to the 24 hours marathon of it on Christmas day.
3303;I will show this movie to my future children and hope they show it to their children and so on and so forth.
3304;For all of you who think this movies horrible, please do the world a favor and step off your high horse of your panties being all in a bunch and lighten up!
3305;For me, A Christmas Story, Scrooged, National Lampoons Christmas, and a Christmas Carol are my top go.
3306;the boys imagination is just wonderful.
3307;The characters are exceptionally well played.
3308;Guaranteed to infuse you with the joy of the season.
3309;As far as I know, he liked it.
3310;This movie is one of the all time great ones.
3311;Thanks so much for offering it for sale.
3312;All young at heart will appreciate and relate.
3313;My family and I always enjoy watching this movie.
3314;It brings back a lot of childhood memories.
3315;good movie!Would recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it!
3316;this is just flat out funny and warm and lovely.
3317;Should be required Christmas viewing.
3318;Myself and my family rate this 5 stars because it is hilarious, family oriented holiday film with a lovely message delivered before you even know it!
3319;A Classic Gene Shepherd Story done beautifully!
3320;Great for kids and adults.
3321;A Christmas Story continues to be the highlight of Christmas Season viewing.
3322;Tough to beat this film for Christmas enjoyment.
3323;Narration by one of the best.
3324;Now I can enjoy it in greater detail than ever before.
3325;Still one of the most enjoyable seasonal movies of all time and it just got better.
3326;This is his favorite Christmas movie and I wanted him to have it for always.
3327;We will watch it tonite and enjoy it together.
3328;One of our favorite Christmas movies to watch during the Christmas season!
3329;The price was good, and I received the product within the time specified.
3330;This is the quintessential Christmas movie.
3331;Even ELF, one of my other favorite Christmas films, did not get played this year, but A CHRISTMAS STORY got played all day long in the background while doing our holiday, family stuff.
3332;I just love this movie.
3333;It is far and away my favorite holiday film.
3334;It's simply a slice of nostalgic Americana that I can watch over and over.
3335;The kids are, in a sense, locked in time and forever young in this movie, and that's how I prefer to view them.
3336;the commentary reel had some great behind the scenes tidbits, and it was great hearing this group of talented people reminisce on scene after scene as it played out.
3337;I'd also like to see them do a true re.
3338;This is something of a national treasure, and it deserves to be preserved for generations to come.
3339;Whether it's December or July, it's a cool bit of entertainment for the whole family.
3340;"This one is a winner and you ""won't shoot your eye out!"""
3341;A Christmas classic that we watch with the Grinch and A Christmas Carol,(B&W and color versions).
3342;Great movie for the whole family!!
3343;Not sure why this is a classic.
3344;Always brings a smile and laugh to our family.
3345;If not already, it's sure to be a favorite of yours too!
3346;By far our family's favorite holiday movie!
3347;Ralphie has always been the lead, but in recent year's we've come to love little Randy too.
3348;now we can watch it anytime!Great classic, love itwas the perfect gift
3349;Worth the time and money.
3350;As old a movie the Christmas Story may be, it will continue to have its twenty.
3351;four hour special every Christmas Eve because it's such a great movie.
3352;Not only is it hilarious, but it's also a great movie for the whole family to relax, lay around a warm fire, make some popcorn and all watch together.
3353;If you're looking for a funny, real.
3354;life, all together classic movie, The Christmas Story is the way to go.
3355;Finally the big Christmas day arrives and the family opens up all the presents.
3356;the Christmas dinner is a disaster, but Christmas as a whole was the best Christmas ever.

3358;It's so funny and fun to watch that there's no way anyone could possibly NOT like it.
3359;It's got great characters, an awesome theme, and a lot of humor.
3360;all in all, The Christmas Story is a must see.
3361;The Christmas Story has beenone of my all time favorite movies since I was little, and it will continue to be, because no matter how long it's been around, this is a movie that will never grow old.
3362;It's one of those cult films that people like because it's quirky, nostalgic throwback to an earlier time.
3363;An engrossing and nostalgic feel.
3364;My 30+ year olds have been watching this for over 20 years and it is as mandatory at Christmas time as Bing Crosby's Christmas songs, Scrooged, a real Christmas tree and the family present.
3365;The story is so well crafted with the interior monologue blending seamlessly with the action in the movie.
3366;Great acting, direction, cinematography and the capturing of a time of innocence and family caring and love.
3367;What a great movie for the holidays!
3368;I love this movie, it makes me remember being a kid again.
3369;it is a warm, loving Christmas movie that is enjoyed every year.
3370;it is Christmas classic every home should have a copy of to enjoy for the Holiday's.
3371;Recommend to anyone who loved this christmas classic!
3372;Not a critical hit either upon its release, the movie has now become the most touching and heartfelt Christmas motion picture of all.
3373;"Given a modest budget, ""A Christmas Story"" tells the simple story of a young boy named Ralphie who wants only one thing for Christmas: a bee bee gun."
3374;The film is set around the 1930's or 1940's and features an excellent cast of adult actors, but it's the young child stars that steals the film, most notably Peter Billingsley who plays Ralphie.
3375;What person wouldn't love Ralphie, what with his cute smile and big round glasses.
3376;One neat tidbit from the commentary is when Clark states that Jack Nicholson was his original choice to play the dad.
3377;"Upon viewing this treasure ""A Christmas Story"" will become a part of your Holiday viewing pleasure for years to come."
3378;Great funny movie to watch with your family and friends.
3379;This is a classic everyone should see.

3387;it was a awesome copy my husband loved it i got it for him for christmas and its his favorite movie
3388;I watch it every year.
3389;I loved the father's character.
3390;A very good (not excellent, unfortunately) adaptation of Shep's story, he makes an appearance, starring Darin McGavin and Melinda Dillon.
3391;It's the best of the holiday for a late boomer like me!
3392;This is hands down the best Christmas movie made!
3393;Share it with your friends, your kids, your friends kids, and anyone else you know!
3394;It is a yearly family tradition.
3395;We will see how we all enjoy that one.

3398;I smile through the whole thing.

3400;It's focus on the Christmas experience through the eyes of a kid who covets a particular toy is timeless.
3401;Just a wonderful, quotable, family classic.
3402;It's a film with with a very special meaning to it, it made me feel when I was a child excited and thrilled to wake up Christmas Morning and find my favorite Christmas present.
3403;If you've watched this film as much as I have, you begin to appreciate it's plot and happy ending, you feel happy and emotional for Ralpy and you begin to think of yourself and your own family, and when you've watched it as many times as I have, you understand why it's a classic and why you cannot go through one Christmas without seeing it.

3406;The movie is one of the Great Christmas Classics from when I was kid.
3407;I was happy to share it with my wife who somehow grew up isolated and was unable to watch it.
3408;But I'm happy to Report she enjoyed it too.
3409;I look forward to the day when my kids are old enough to enjoy it with us.
3410;I remember seeing the poster for A CHRISTMAS STORY at a theatre in Phoenix in the summer of 1983 and I wondered why in the world would anybody release a Christmas movie then.
3411;Now it's a holiday tradition to see it every Christmas.
3412;I admire it for capturing the 1940's look while at the same time tapping into the universal thoughts and feelings of Kid.
3413;It's Christmas Eve, I've just watched it, and I laughed out loud all over again.
3414;I adored them both in their roles.)

3424;There is a touch of sentimentality at the end, and it is tastefully done.
3425;A true ensemble cast, they all contribute significantly.
3426;The movie is sheer fun, and it is tradition in our hosuehold to watch it before Christmas and on Christmas Eve.
3427;This classic movie is timeless and was well done.
3428;This is still a great movie and just a classic for the holidays.

3431;This really brings you inside Ralphie's world.
3432;No frills, just a classic movie in the new format.
3433;Probably better for those who can remember 50's and 60's era.
3434;One of the best Christmas movies of all time.
3435;For those of us who grew up in the 1940s this movie takes us back to our childhood.

3473;For those of you living under a rock and unfamiliar with this film, it's about a little boy named Ralphie and what he wants for Christmas.
3474;The cast is fantastic and it's hilarious without being raunchy.
