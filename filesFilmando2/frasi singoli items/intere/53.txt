I:8403;1;Fine writing, laugh out loud funny situational comedy, many supporting actors and actresses who I recognized from elsewhere, funny hair, clever satire, solid content, garishly colorful clothes you have to love laughing at.
I:8403;2;Anne Bancroft immediately became every schoolboy's fantasy, and Dustin Hoffman was brilliant in the starring role.
I:8403;3;A little bit dated, but overall, you gotta love this movie.
I:8403;4;establishment, pretty radical especially considering when it came out in the late 1960's.
I:8403;5;Great plot, acting and music!!
I:8403;6;I would recommend it to everyone.
I:8403;7;my 14 year old son watched it with me and loved it.
I:8403;8;A great addition to my library.
I:8403;9;I have loved this film for over 40 years.
I:8403;10;It is funny, deep, moving, wild!
I:8403;11;I happened to see it the other night after having not seen it for years, and it really holds up.
I:8403;12;This is just a great movie and is a perfect blend of comedy and drama.
I:8403;13;There's so much wonderfully subtle humor in this movie without making it a comedy and at the same time it serves as a very good drama.
I:8403;14;Mrs. Robinson is one of the greatest villains of all.
I:8403;15;time, Dustin Hoffman is great, and this movie just never gets old.
I:8403;16;I love movies with a happy ending even though this is not always the case in real life.
I:8403;17;A great investment for my movie collection.
I:8403;18;It's got a great sound track too.
I:8403;19;The best things about this film were the quirkly one.
I:8403;20;"liners of Dustin Hoffman and the camera angles and cinematography of the director, which during this time period had to be ""ground."
I:8403;21;Dustin Hoffman and Anne Baxter were terrific, and the supporting cast is awesome!
I:8403;22;A classic for all time.
I:8403;23;Great performances by all and fantastic period piece.
I:8403;24;I love this movie for the hilarious deadpan performance of Dustin Hoffman.
I:8403;25;It's a crazy story, of course with a great soundtrack, that I love over and over.
I:8403;26;While this may be an American movie classic, I felt it had charm here and there.
I:8403;27;"`The Graduate' is by far one of my favorite movies ever made
I:8403;28;Director Mike Nichols takes Calder Willingham's screenplay (based off of Charles Webb's novel of the same name) and delivers it to us with a delicate yet subtle brazenness that adds layers of emotional weight and clarity to the film.
I:8403;29;Couple that with a slew of fantastic performances by just about everyone in the cast and you have a film that is legendary, classic and frankly `important' in the catalogue of cinematic achievements.
I:8403;30;what make this movie so iconic are the marvelous performances by the entire cast, Hoffman and Bancroft especially.
I:8403;31;"Anne Bancroft is marvelous as the seductive and manipulative Mrs. Robinson
I:8403;32;She very comfortable slides into character and single handedly created a character that will go down in history as one of the most recognizable and memorable screen vixens.
I:8403;33;Dustin Hoffman is marvelous here, truly outstanding.
I:8403;34;Benjamin Braddock was his breakthrough and garnered him his first Oscar nomination, which should have been his first win.
I:8403;35;the rest of the cast excels as well, especially Katherine Ross, who plays Elaine.
I:8403;36;She is welcoming and vivacious and everything a man could want, thus adding to the believability that Benjamin would chose her over her aggressive mother.
I:8403;37;`The Graduate' is one of those films that defined a generation.
I:8403;38;It's a film that captured everything that made the 60's what it was and created a standard for all other films approaching this genre to live up to.
I:8403;39;"The feeling of the film, the fluidity, the casting
I:8403;40;in the end I must declare that everyone should see this iconic film.
I:8403;41;There are so few true gems in this world, so few films that are undeniably splendid.
I:8403;42;"Even when compiling my list of favorite films I come to realize that many of them are purely of my own opinion
I:8403;43;A must see for all generations.
I:8403;44;This is a movie that everyone must watch, a feel good movie and a fantastic soundtrack.Younger people can learn a lot about human emotions and interactions that is devoid from the movies of today which seem to focus on computer animation, and trick photography.
I:8403;45;A classic timeless for all the ages!
I:8403;46;This one is fantastic and very relevant even now a days.
I:8403;47;Dustin Huffman's breakout film has wonderful performances by all of the actors, a great story, beautiful filmography and a fantastic sound track by Simon and Garfunkle.
I:8403;48;That this is a universal dilemma of young adulthood is why The Graduate still speaks to us.
I:8403;49;but, on seeing it now, it is so obviously of a very special time and place.
I:8403;50;forget about that and just enjoy a tremendously funny and insightful film.
I:8403;51;Ann Bancroft is wonderful, Katherine Ross delicious, Murray Hamilton very funny, and the rest of the cast perfect.
I:8403;52;That's it, but what fun and great laughs are mined from this material.
I:8403;53;Just great classic scenes and dialogue, and emotions and situations that are timeless.
I:8403;54;And, of course, there was the brilliant idea to use Simon Garfunkel's music.
I:8403;55;hollywood ending is saved by the last shot.
I:8403;56;Then he honestly thought that he could live happily ever after with her despite all the lies, and the fact that he was sleeping with her mother?!
I:8403;57;It was not romantic, cute, funny, none of the above!
I:8403;58;Horrible movie, and I do NOT recommend it to anyone.
I:8403;59;This movie is, and will always be a classic.
I:8403;60;Everything about it seems perfect.
I:8403;61;It's a marvelously original movie.
I:8403;62;The plot is wonderful as well.
I:8403;63;"The inevitable happens
I:8403;64;Neurotic Passionate obsession with strangers.
I:8403;65;I loved it when it was first released.
I:8403;66;and I loved it more when I watched it again recently.
I:8403;67;I have nearly all the top 100 AFI movies that have been transferred to blu ray in my collection and found this blu ray transfer good but not great.
I:8403;68;Great movie, with such a great actor.
I:8403;69;The Movie does dive into inner thought , human instincts and attractions .
I:8403;70;It was Fun and Serious at the same time , to see it again was a good use of My time .
I:8403;71;Since the first time I saw The Graduate, I loved everything about it: the comedy mixed with drama, the unique characters, the clever filming style, and the hilarious dialogue.
I:8403;72;It's definitely one of my favorites.
I:8403;73;as far as the disc goes, I found the Special Edition satisfying for my needs.
I:8403;74;Ben finally goes to Berkeley, where Elaine is attending college, and convinces her to marry him on the spot.
I:8403;75;I took note especially of the cinematography in this movie.
I:8403;76;The effect takes hold of you and makes you feel what he's feeling.
I:8403;77;I had to watch it for film class.
I:8403;78;I would recommend it, it is a classic.
I:8403;79;Needless to say this was a wonderful video.
I:8403;80;A witty, stylish, sexy satire.
I:8403;81;"Maybe you have not seen ""The Graduate"" with a very young Dennis Hoffman, but you should look into making time to see it."
I:8403;82;i loved this movie and it will remain one of my favorites.
I:8403;83;It's worth watching, so don't judge it by when it was made, but by it's content.
I:8403;84;Watch it again in a few years.
I:8403;85;The Graduate is such an iconic part of the American psyche and I honestly could remember if I'd seen it all the way through in one sitting, only bits and pieces.
I:8403;86;One reason was to see that incredibly sexy night club stripper (Lainie Miller) perform again.
I:8403;87;I had to see it again just to catch all the subtle jokes and comic nuances.
I:8403;88;Dustin Hoffman is still delightful as the nave and somewhat awkward Benjamin Braddock, while Katherine Ross remains as lovely as ever.
I:8403;89;I would still consider it to be one of the most memorable films of the sixties.
I:8403;90;Fairly good movie all in all with very interesting camera shots, shot from inside of his scuba suit and also the underwater shots added an interesting perspective.
I:8403;91;Captures an era yet is eternal.
I:8403;92;Dustin Hoffman and Ann Bancroft are amazing.
I:8403;93;Great make up for Ann, both actors are close in age.
I:8403;94;The Graduate is a classic.
I:8403;95;This is probably Dustin Hoffman's greatest performance.
I:8403;96;The cinetamography and directing is amazing.
I:8403;97;"I was very excited to finally watch ""The Graduate,"" and indeed I found it engaging, well."
I:8403;98;Implausibly, this actually works on Elaine, and she starts showing interest in him.
I:8403;99;"And do we really need to hear ""Sound of Silence"" three times?There are some great things about ""The Graduate"": the directing and editing are excellent, Bancroft is amazing (the film needs her in the third act!)"
I:8403;100;, Hoffman is also very good, and their scenes together are the best parts of the film.
I:8403;101;It's also very funny in a dry, British.
I:8403;102;"A comparably cherished film from my generation might be ""The Breakfast Club."""
I:8403;103;"Perhaps in 20 years, my kid will watch that film and have the same reaction that I had to ""The Graduate""!"
I:8403;104;many years went by I watched the film periodically and enjoyed it every time.
I:8403;105;The Graduate is an all time classic.
I:8403;106;This film pretty much defined the 60's in many ways .
I:8403;107;Although a time capsule in many ways, there is much going on from a psychological point of view that still makes it interesting.
I:8403;108;Audio commentaries by Dustin Hoffman, Katherine Ross, Mike Nichols, and Steven Soderbergh.2.
I:8403;109;Coming of Age: The Making of THE GRADUATE4.
I:8403;110;Every word and frame carefully builds upon one another in a comedic drama that stains the bounds of reason.
I:8403;111;Yet, in the world of the film, have a place due to effort leading to the moment and the way in which they're captured.
I:8403;112;as to it's place as the greatest of all films is yet to be determined.
I:8403;113;This is just one the massive number of symbolic and cultural criticism that can be found in the film: whether its the world of the fish tank, the cage, the mind, or just another person.
I:8403;114;a well rounded film which truly stands as a testament to what can be accomplished with cinema.
I:8403;115;One of the best movies ever.
I:8403;116;A second time around for us and enjoyed it just as much.
I:8403;117;A classic I wanted to see again.
I:8403;118;Although this movie is old, the theme is cute and it takes us back to the era when cinematography was simple.
I:8403;119;The Graduate is one of those films one can watch any time and truly enjoy.
I:8403;120;Both extremely funny and extremely sad (sometimes in the same scene, a rare thing to achieve without succumbing to campy irony), it is also an instance of outstanding acting.
I:8403;121;Also great is Katherine Ross.
I:8403;122;The baby boomers should feel lucky to have this as one of their generation's finest.
I:8403;123;time great movie, it just left me wondering what all of the accolades were about.
I:8403;124;Enter Mrs. Robinson (Bancroft) and the comedy becomes a display of Ben's intense discomfort with their illicit relationship.
I:8403;125;Up to this point, I was really impressed.
I:8403;126;versed in film history), but I can say that, in spite all that Simon and Garfunkel, The Graduate still comes across as very fresh and interesting.
I:8403;127;I thought it did an excellent job of capturing the post.
I:8403;128;I thought the camera work was interesting.
I:8403;129;"In particular, there are several impressive shots involving ""Mrs. Robinson."""
I:8403;130;I think the flashes of her chest and sharp tan.
I:8403;131;I found this quite effective.
I:8403;132;The last thing I will mention about the Graduate is the final scene .
I:8403;133;I think this brings the story back to reality, in a way .
I:8403;134;Anyway, I thought it was great.
I:8403;135;I mean, it's a classic, and millions of people have loved it.
I:8403;136;with Simon and Garfunkel's excellent music.
I:8403;137;The perfect depiction of a quarter life crisis marks the beginning of a great career for Dustin Hoffman
I:8403;138;An old classic that has still stood the test of time.
I:8403;139;Dustin Hoffman is amazing in it!
I:8403;140;dustin Hoffman is charming, and superb in his role of Benjamin Braddock.
I:8403;141;Anne Bancroft is also superb as the sexy, sedusive wife.
I:8403;142;Kathrine Ross, William Daniels, Murray Hamilton, and Elizabeth Wilson are also wonderful in their co. starring roles.
I:8403;143;The Graduate is hilarious and poignant at the same time.
I:8403;144;The Simon and Garfunkel soundtrack only makes the film more enjoyable and fits in just right with the story.
I:8403;145;The directing by Mike Nichols is awesome and the storyline and dialouge are great.
I:8403;146;"i highly recommend ""The Graduate""."
I:8403;147;Well directed and well acted drama, although somewhat predictable.
I:8403;148;"One of the best of its class
I:8403;149;I loved the music though.
I:8403;150;See again, or for the first time, the movie that launched Dustin Hoffman's career.
I:8403;151;This is my favorite movie.
I:8403;152;Anyone who has ever reached a confusing time or crossroads in their life should be able to relate to its message.
I:8403;153;Much of what is communicated through characters is subtle and even abstract.
I:8403;154;From a wonderful novel by Charles Webb, to a fantastic screenplay by Calder Willingham and Buck Henry and then beautifully etched on the screen by director, Mike Nichols, The Graduate, to me, stands out as a an American classic.
I:8403;155;I saw it again last night and it still held up.
I:8403;156;dustin Hoffman is wonderful as the graduate.
I:8403;157;He is funny in an off.
I:8403;158;beat way, and he is always real.
I:8403;159;Though cynical and kind of tough, she is honest and vulnerable.
I:8403;160;A classic 60`s romantic comedy, which I have seen loads of times still find it as amusing endearing as the 1st time I watched it at the pictures in 1970.
I:8403;161;There is a brilliant soundtrack from Simon Garfunkel with songs such as, of course, Mrs Robinson, Sound Of Silence, Scarborough Fair more.
I:8403;162;So definately a film worth watching, for Its sheer light hearted escapism, that over the years has stood the test of time.
I:8403;163;So go on treat yourself.
I:8403;164;I even caught it at the beginning one night and said, Finally!
I:8403;165;I'll get to see the whole thing!
I:8403;166;Two days ago I went on a pilgrimage to find it and finally conquer this darn movie once and for all.
I:8403;167;And I must say, I love it from top to bottom.
I:8403;168;of course, the first thing that everyone mentions is the amazing soundtrack.
I:8403;169;I honestly don't think this movie would be the same without it.
I:8403;170;I have a newfound appreciation for Simon and Garfunkel.
I:8403;171;the cinematography is really what caught my eye.
I:8403;172;it's a small detail, but it's outstanding.
I:8403;173;the acting is superb and the dialogue is wonderful.
I:8403;174;This is a theme that has been relived many times since this movies inception.
I:8403;175;Ben is a fresh graduate from college home for R&R prior to finding out where he is going in life.
I:8403;176;The acting is relativly good, especially Anne Bancroft as Mrs. Robinson.
I:8403;177;ray version of this film is masterpiece of remastering for the hi.
I:8403;178;The colours are glorious, the blacks are true and the detail and depth are at times overwhelming.
I:8403;179;it is also an excellent example of taking what was probably a mono soundtrack (at best stereo) and artificially producing a 5.1 surround environment.
I:8403;180;For a film of this type, there is a lot going on in the sound field, most of it subtle but switch the stereo for a while and compare .
I:8403;181;It's making fun of both sides of the 1960's generation gap: the rebellious teens and the controlling authority figures.
I:8403;182;Hoffman at his best and his first film.
I:8403;183;THis film is on my top ten for best films ever made.
I:8403;184;Best line, Plastics, think Plastics.
I:8403;185;I listened to the soundtrack and I loved it.
I:8403;186;This is a great film.
I:8403;187;Some do cause they just want to and it's nice.
I:8403;188;i definitely recommend this to others, maybe college students can relate to it in some way.
I:8403;189;Soon he becomes acustomed to the idea and actually quite comfortable with it.
I:8403;190;But being with Mrs Robinson gives him the courage and confidence he was lacking and makes it easier for him to relax and take it easy.
I:8403;191;This is a cult classic, a film that resulted in many other staple films of today.
I:8403;192;With brilliant performances across the board, notably by Hoffman and Bancroft, this is a staple film that should be seen by all.
I:8403;193;Dustin Hoffman does such a good job in this film, his voice is just so perfect for the part.
I:8403;194;it's sort of fun just listening to it.
I:8403;195;There are a few of holes left in the plot and some of the characters, but overall this was a very well made movie.
I:8403;196;Anne Bancroft does a great job as the seductress/cougar/jealous, over.
I:8403;197;The emotional and moral flip.
I:8403;198;flopping is a real draw back in the film, but also can be seen as a small realization of the fickle human heart and psyche.
I:8403;199;In fact, right after watching it, I had a desire to watch the whole thing again.
I:8403;200;He is seduced by the wife of his father's business partner.
I:8403;201;They include a documentary, an interview with Dustin Hoffmann, and the movie trailer.
I:8403;202;Nevertheless, I do recommend it.
I:8403;203;I know that a few months later that I brought it up to my aunt who's a committed Christian, and she paled, which led up to the sermon, and to be honest I felt like I couldn't win.
I:8403;204;I got the tape finally when I was 25 years old, and watched it once, and since then I lost the appeal.
I:8403;205;The music is great, the sets and clothing are good.
I:8403;206;All positive characteristics end there.
I:8403;207;in THE GRADUATE, there are a lot more of these 5 minutes of grace when the conjunction of music, image, dialogs and acting transforms a simple scene in a sheer artistic moment.
I:8403;208;i think that THE GRADUATE could be considered as one of the movies representing in the best possible way the sixties.
I:8403;209;Behind this sentimental comedy, you capture the heart of that period.
I:8403;210;the features are very interesting.
I:8403;211;I'd always heard what a great movie this was, but I had never seen it before .
I:8403;212;Bancroft was good, as ever.
I:8403;213;"Some of the themes of ""The Graduate"" are dated by today's standards but it remains a very funny film."
I:8403;214;"When ""The Graduate"" was released in 1967 it was considered to be a landmark in American film."
I:8403;215;What remains are some very funny bits mostly involving Benjamin's awkward encounters with the worldly, seductive Mrs. Robinson.
I:8403;216;There's also some funny moments involving Benjamin's frantic pursuit of Elaine, particularly after she finds out about his affair with her mother.
I:8403;217;Hoffman makes a terrific debut as Benjamin.
I:8403;218;Ross is pretty and adequate as Elaine.
I:8403;219;"There are alot of great scenes involving character actors including Murray Hamilton (""I think you're scum!"")"
I:8403;220;The screenplay by Buck Henry is great, Mike Nichols did an outstanding job directing, and all the key parts were cast and acted perfectly.
I:8403;221;The great Simon Garfunkel music helped to make the film what it became.
I:8403;222;I think it is that good.
I:8403;223;It has always been one of my favorite films.
I:8403;224;nichols' commentary track some years ago for the Laser Disc edition is, to my mind, the very best audio commentary ever made.
I:8403;225;It is worth the time to watch it once more and see the issues of the day.
I:8403;226;adult themes but well worth the view
I:8403;227;"Let me see if I get this right about this ""classic"" film of the 60's."
I:8403;228;but on the plus side it has a great musical score.
I:8403;229;Dustin Hoffman, Ann Bancroft, Katherine Ross and many others.
I:8403;230;This is a 60s classic with a killer soundtrack by Simon and Garfunkle.
I:8403;231;Watching it takes me back.
I:8403;232;With the advent of cable TV, I viewed it in it's original cinematic form as a young adult.
I:8403;233;One of the more poignant scenes is when Benjamin is asking Mrs. Robinson about her marriage and how she came to be with Mr. Robinson.
I:8403;234;The Graduate is one of the best movies ever made and it is my favorite Dustin Hoffman movie.
I:8403;235;This is one of the defining films of my generation, and of course I saw it when it came out in 1967.
I:8403;236;Seeing it again after all these years I was struck by both how funny it is and by the brittle, cynical and brilliant performance by Anne Bancroft as Mrs. Robinson.
I:8403;237;She is flawless in a part that might easily lend itself to overacting.
I:8403;238;Instead she is subtle, controlled, focused, and authentic in a way that is both sexy and chilling with just a hint of ironic humor.
I:8403;239;Nichols's films typically feature talented and charismatic actors and actresses who explore in a deceptively humorous manner the dark side of human nature.
I:8403;240;Nichols likes to work with material from another medium and make it his own.
I:8403;241;Nichols also likes to feature cutting edge popular music in the score.
I:8403;242;"What we hear in the background and played over the opening credits is Simon and Garfunkel's ""Sounds of Silence."""
I:8403;243;panned, literal delivery of one.
I:8403;244;"I especially loved Ben's answer when his father, enquiring about his Quixotic plan to marry Mrs. Robinson's daughter Elaine (Katharine Ross), asks, ""Isn't this a half."
I:8403;245;"liners
I:8403;246;One of the funniest bits in the movie is when the camera catches his face as Elaine's father comes out of Ben's room spewing obscenities and insults at Ben.
I:8403;247;"what we loved about this movie was the youthful point of view
I:8403;248;but see this for Anne Bancroft, a brilliant and perhaps underrated actress in one of her most memorable roles.
I:8403;249;The Graduate is one of those life changing films which works quite well for most everyone.
I:8403;250;I give this film 4 stars instead of 3 for its impact and social relevance at the time.
I:8403;251;Just a good film that doesn't hold up quite as well by today's standards.
I:8403;252;Great performance by the main actor and the main actres.
I:8403;253;A classic movie that show things that can happen in the real world, and at the same time show us how the things were in the 60's
I:8403;254;I discover in it a lot of tenderness and affection.
I:8403;255;and sex of course, but a beauty sex, the seduction of an older women to a young boy just like I want it for me at that age.
I:8403;256;anne Bancroft is a Venus de Milo and Dustin Hoffman the perfect encarnation of innocence.
I:8403;257;This is on everyone's list of must see top ten movies of all time.
I:8403;258;Gets better every time I watch it!!
I:8403;259;Often very funny.yet always poignant.
I:8403;260;this is a film that identified the turbulent Sixties.
I:8403;261;hoffman and Bancroft are superb in their respective roles.
I:8403;262;The supporting cast is worthy, the musical score (again) is exceptional, and the dynamics of this film defined a generation.
I:8403;263;Nothing about this movie is good.
I:8403;264;Surprising that this movie is still relevant re: the search for meaning for a young man.
I:8403;265;Dustin Hoffman is hilarious in this comedy.
I:8403;266;I would definitely recommend this, as it is worth watching
I:8403;267;This movie will have movie lovers watching it tor years.
I:8403;268;Being a widescreen presentation also means black bars on the top and bottom.
I:8403;269;postScript: Thanks for the clarification.
I:8403;270;Hopefully its new owners will get things right.
I:8403;271;Surely it's high time to give this classic the treatment it deserves.
I:8403;272;This is the brilliant tale about a man who has just graduated college.
I:8403;273;Matters are complicated once again when he finally does go out with Elaine and now is in love with her.
I:8403;274;She is married to Ben's father's business partner, and has known Ben for his whole life.
I:8403;275;Eventually he gives into her, and they have affairs for many months.
I:8403;276;After they calm down, the movie with sincere expressions on their faces.
I:8403;277;The Graduate was a very tasteful film.
I:8403;278;I found it to be quite funny and that the story could basically fit our time period, not just the 60's.
I:8403;279;It also had a very complicated story.
I:8403;280;The acting was quite superb.
I:8403;281;Dustin Hoffman and Anne Boncroft (Ben and Mrs. Robinson) acted remarkably well especially when I heard that they were around the same age.
I:8403;282;All the characters in this movie did very well in getting into their roles.
I:8403;283;The feelings and moods of the film were portrayed quite well.
I:8403;284;The music was also very important to showing the mood of the story, and the soundtrack is quite amazing if I do say so myself.
I:8403;285;If you just looked at the characters at the beginning of the movie and the end you can see that they all have changed a lot.
I:8403;286;In short, I really enjoy this movie and I will recommend it many people that I know.
I:8403;287;I have to say I think this is my favorite film from the 60's.
I:8403;288;The item came really fast the condition of the item was great.
I:8403;289;"Good, though improbable story of college graduate, Benjamin, seduced by his father's law partner's wife, Mrs, Robinson, Some memorable songs, including "" Mrs. Robinson""'"
I:8403;290;"The picture is still grainy and the ""widescreen"" is still a full."
I:8403;291;This is an accomplished film for someone directing only his second film.
I:8403;292;The Graduate is one of those films that gravitates effortlessly to its audience even now, the aging Vietnam War.
I:8403;293;proclaimed alcoholic and about as sympathetic as Lady Macbeth.
I:8403;294;It's hard to imagine what the original choice, Doris Day, would have done with this role, as it takes Anne Bancroft's formidable arsenal of skills to bring this vituperative woman to life.
I:8403;295;She gives a masterful performance.
I:8403;296;"make indelible marks here)
I:8403;297;She almost succeeds but not before a series of revelations and dramatic encounters that lead to the classic ending aboard the public bus.
I:8403;298;"But these lapses are forgivable in light of Nichols' expert direction
I:8403;299;Strongly recommended after all these years.
I:8403;300;This is one of the few movies that made an impression on me as a young adult.
I:8403;301;Always good to see Ann Bancroft and amazing to see a real young Dustin Hoffman.
I:8403;302;It is also good to look back to movie making in the 60s.
I:8403;303;Dustin Hoffman played this part awkwardly wonderful.
I:8403;304;Anne Bancroft was a perfect Mrs Robinson.
I:8403;305;Katharine Ross was beautiful as the daughter.
I:8403;306;Not so easy to watch, but good camera work.
I:8403;307;Wanted to see this after many years.
I:8403;308;It was a bit dated but still a classic.
I:8403;309;It was a nice light movie.
I:8403;310;Revisiting this 70's era classic was a delightful journey into the morals and attitudes of that time.
I:8403;311;It earns its place in the best 100 films of the American Films Institute list.
I:8403;312;the movie is also an excercise in style and technique, although according to Henry, some came by accident as the actors and the director sort of fumbled around when they didn't know quite how to create a certain scene.
I:8403;313;I love the part when Dustin Hoffman eagerly kisses Anne Bancroft with smoke still in her mouth.
I:8403;314;this movie will last and will appeal to any generation.
I:8403;315;I first saw this movie in junior high back in the early 80's and I thought what a neat movie it was.
I:8403;316;Dustin Hoffman and Anne Bancroft are perfect together, and Katharine Ross isn't bad either.
I:8403;317;I loved that all the music was done by one band (and a great one, at that).
I:8403;318;Representative of attitudes of the 60's but themes are true for all succeeding generations as well.
I:8403;319;This is probably my very favorite movie.
I:8403;320;"And if you've read any of my other reviews, you're saying, ""Oh, yeah, cuz she's obsessed with Simon and Garfunkel."""
I:8403;321;It's perfect: unconventional, darkly funny, honest, odd, with the perfect music and about a million lines that are regularly quoted at my home.
I:8403;322;Darn it, you could even say it's touching.
I:8403;323;But it's awesome, the best movie ending ever.
I:8403;324;The element of humor is indescribable, being somewhat unconventional, but in the end is probably the funniest (and saddest even) movie I have ever seen.
I:8403;325;i must, I fear, discuss the music for a moment.
I:8403;326;"The S&G
I:8403;327;"The music really embodies the movie, and especially ""The Sound of Silence"" and ""Mrs. Robinson."""
I:8403;328;and so everything in this movie adds up.
I:8403;329;It's entertaning, somewhat groundbreaking for its time, moving, balanced, serious and at the same time absolutely hilarious.
I:8403;330;It's so original, and the perfect performances of Hoffman and Bancroft really carry the whole film.
I:8403;331;A 70's view of graduation in more ways than one.
I:8403;332;Even if you don't appreciate the theme, you will love the music of Simon and Garfunkel.
I:8403;333;the movie made great use of Simon and Garfunkel songs for the soundtrack!
I:8403;334;It really becomes part of the film and tells the story.
I:8403;335;Frankly, it's probably the best part of the movie.
I:8403;336;"In my opinion, the best film of that year was Mike Nichols' ""The Graduate""."
I:8403;337;It was the most unique film of its time and is now considered a timeless classic.
I:8403;338;the acting and cinematography make this film a masterful work of art.
I:8403;339;Director of photography Robert Surtees added to the uncertainty with inventive cinematography, always placing Ben to the left or right.
I:8403;340;"Not too mention, the always memorable ""leg"" shot."
I:8403;341;The Graduate is a must have movie for all film buffs.
I:8403;342;I don't want to anyhow, but I guess I can just add my stamp of approval to a film that is timeless.
I:8403;343;The film is remembered for its original story, its brilliant performances, and for launching the career of Dustin Hoffman and Katherine Ross.
I:8403;344;Simply an unforgettable film with unforgettable images.
I:8403;345;in real life, anne bancroft is only 6 years older than dustin hoffman and yet she has a very mature look, pretty much playing dustin like a piano for most of the movie.
I:8403;346;"this movie came out the year i was born
I:8403;347;it was also the summer of love and the sexual revolution was in full swing.
I:8403;348;it was interesting to see the scenes shot at UC Berkeley( one scenes is shot on telegraph avenue ) and the Oakland Zoo, places i have been to many times.
I:8403;349;of course, this is one of the most quotable movies ever.
I:8403;350;the wedding finale ( elaine!!!
I:8403;351;caused a lump in my throat.
I:8403;352;"and oh yeah, simon and garfunkel's songs, put the movie soundtrack on the map."""
I:8403;353;One of the few older movies I like.
I:8403;354;Dustin is so funny and mrs Robinson is hot.
I:8403;355;Having seen The Graduate several times and enjoying it thoroughly, I happened to view it again recently.
I:8403;356;Let's be clear, this film was groundbreaking and has many excellent qualities (including story, directing, creative editing, symbolism, humor, irony, etc.).
I:8403;357;2) Because the love between Ben and Elaine is, let's face it,contrived.
I:8403;358;The editing,film making, music, and humor that permeate the first halfare still first rate.
I:8403;359;overall, of course, this movie is still a clear classic, because of it's strong message and style at the time,and the overall strength of the film.
I:8403;360;The Graduate is a great film and I grow to love it more with each viewing.
I:8403;361;Everything is nearly perfect about it.
I:8403;362;The script, Mike Nichols' direction, the performances of Dustin Hoffman, Anne Bancroft and Katherine Ross, the music of Simon and Garfunkel.
I:8403;363;It's funny yet dramatic, moving and profound all at the same time.
I:8403;364;A very enjoyable film all around.
I:8403;365;also worth noting in particular is the direction of Mike Nichols.
I:8403;366;He truly gives the film a unique visual style to make it an experience rather than just a comedy/drama.
I:8403;367;He also uses zooms to great effect throughout the film.
I:8403;368;Nichols' Best Director Oscar for this film was well.
I:8403;369;Mike Nichols makes wonderful use of the 2.35:1 frame, so the film will be absolutely botched in pan and scan.
I:8403;370;It's really stunning what difference a brand new remastered 16:9 transfer can make for an older film like this.
I:8403;371;A better documentary and a commentary by the filmmakers would be great.
I:8403;372;The Graduate is not only one of the best films to come out of the 1960s, it's a timeless American classic and clearly one of the best films ever made (#17 on AFI's Top 100 films).
I:8403;373;Every time I watch it, I discover something new.
I:8403;374;Besides Nichols' superb direction, it unfolds with a great script (Buck Henry, Calder Willingham, Charles Webb), great score by Simon and Garfunkel, and absolutely superb acting by all.
I:8403;375;The Graduate is a love story.
I:8403;376;Except that suddenly he has a purpose, possibly the first in his twenty.
I:8403;377;one years: to win Elaine.
I:8403;378;every actor in this film is incredibly fabulous.
I:8403;379;To rival the acting is the cinematography, which is imaginative, pleasing, and original.
I:8403;380;The Graduate, a 1967 classic, gives us a view of Dustin Hoffman's prowess at acting.
I:8403;381;Mrs. Robinson, played by Anne Bancroft, provides Ben with an outlet and something to do with his summer other than apply to graduate school or anything else.
I:8403;382;Pleasant additions to the movie, to say the least, but the movie alone stands well by itself if you aren't interested in watching such additives or listening to Simon and Garfunkel.
I:8403;383;"i'll be revisiting the film for Hoffman's sonic boom of a breakout performance
I:8403;384;Along with its good writing this film was one of the forerunners in using popular music in its soundtrack.
I:8403;385;Benjamin who is ultimately in love with Elaine crashes the wedding and takes her away to face an unknown life ahead.
I:8403;386;With the help of a memorable Simon and Garfunkel soundtrack, this film ushered in a new age geared toward the younger generations.
I:8403;387;It was a classic even then .
I:8403;388;"Hoffman's genius for becoming his character was showcased here for the first time
I:8403;389;I'd recommend it to everyone, though most everybody even vaguely interested in movies has already seen it, and loved it.
I:8403;390;This is as good as black comedies come and Dustin Hoffman shows us just how great an actor he is even all those years ago.
I:8403;391;"I was impressed also with the great direction and especially the way the scenes transition from one to the next
I:8403;392;In some ways the film is also touching as it reveals that behind the facade of prosperity and family wholesomeness lies some very unhappy and unfulfilled lives.
I:8403;393;Hoffman and Ross' characters having the courage to go against the mainstream, to rebel and to live life rather than to be a slave to the mainstream view of what it should be.
I:8403;394;I was wondering what this was about, wow was I surprised.
I:8403;395;It was a good show and funny too.
I:8403;396;Not sure what everybody liked about this movie.
I:8403;397;It was a wonderful movie and one of the first for Mike Nichols and Dustin Hoffman.
I:8403;398;Plus, it had the wonderful musical contribution of Simon and Garfunkle.
I:8403;399;My wife had never heard of it, but she was willing to go along with my word that she'd enjoy it.
I:8403;400;We both watched it last night and enjoyed it immensely.
I:8403;401;It's an exceptionally well done movie.
I:8403;402;A fun (and authentic) look back at the early 60s.
I:8403;403;If i like a movie, i watch it twice.
I:8403;404;I loved the music, still do, and the subtle humor of the Movie are two of the many things that make this a favorite.
I:8403;405;One of the all time favorites.
I:8403;406;It's funny, these type of relationships happen all the time these days.
I:8403;407;so I decided to view it again and really enjoyed it.
I:8403;408;I received the product earlier than was waiting for (international delivery#.
I:8403;409;"Yes, the film is a ""classic""."
I:8403;410;"It also fixated a lot of them on ""material success"" at the expense of what earlier generations considered ""character development"", ""morality"" or ""spirituality""."
I:8403;411;"diving equipment in front of his friends (""see."
I:8403;412;Boy, super listening to the simon and garfinkel music again.
I:8403;413;All the good feelings come back.
I:8403;414;The picture in blue ray is sharp and the music delightful.
I:8403;415;Very interesting ideas and the music is just great!
I:8403;416;Hoffman was young and just getting started but he hit the mark here.
I:8403;417;The story is great, the performances are great and it's touching and real and real and real.
I:8403;418;It was so acclaimed that I thought it would be a decent movie.
I:8403;419;The theme is still relevant today!
I:8403;420;dustin Hoffman is better in this film than I've ever seen him.
I:8403;421;He's great in most films anyway.
I:8403;422;Anne Bancroft is very sexy as the older woman who seduces him, and she delivers a knockout acting performance.
I:8403;423;Katherine Ross and Willaim Daniels are also very good.
I:8403;424;based on the novel by Charles Webb, the screenplay, written by Calder Willingham and Buck Henry is funny and touching.
I:8403;425;director Mike Nichols creates a sophisticated and humorous take on this for a completely entertaining and interesting movie.
I:8403;426;This is one of Dustin's best and thisanniversary edition has nice picture and sound plusneat extras and the soundtrack.
I:8403;427;It is an excellent satire on the Generation Gap at the time.
I:8403;428;highly recommended for fans of Dustin Hoffman and people who grew up in the 1960's and 1970's.
I:8403;429;This was a great movie when it first came out and it has held up over the decades.
I:8403;430;Hoffman's character's reactions to Bancroft's Mrs Robinson's advances is priceless.
I:8403;431;The more I see it the more detail I pick up.
I:8403;432;And it is shot so well.
I:8403;433;This movie is not quite as exciting as it was when many of us first saw it in 1967, but it's still well worth seeing again and again.
I:8403;434;Anne Bancroft is perfect as the seducing older married woman, and Dustin Hoffman in his first staring role is every bit the hesitant, mumbling seductee.
I:8403;435;it's easy to see that the director Mike Nichols came to movies from the stage.
I:8403;436;One final thing: while I love the music of Paul Simon, with the exception of Mrs. Robinson, I didn't understand what those other great songs had to do with the theme of this movie in 1967 and I don't know now.
I:8403;437;While this movie is about a seedy topic, adultery, it is done so well!
I:8403;438;The dialogue, the camera angles, the music, it's just so good!
I:8403;439;This is one of the defining films of my generation, and of course I saw it when it came out in 1967.
I:8403;440;Seeing it again after all these years I was struck by both how funny it is and by the brittle, cynical and brilliant performance by Anne Bancroft as Mrs. Robinson.
I:8403;441;She really is flawless in a part that might easily lend itself to overacting.
I:8403;442;Instead she is subtle, controlled, focused, and authentic in a way that is both sexy and chilling with just a hint of ironic humor.
I:8403;443;Nichols's films typically feature talented and charismatic actors and actresses who explore in a deceptively humorous manner the dark side of our human nature.
I:8403;444;Nichols likes to work with material from another medium and make it his own.
I:8403;445;Nichols also likes to feature cutting edge popular music in the score.
I:8403;446;"What we hear in the background and played over the opening credits is Simon and Garfunkel's ""Sounds of Silence."""
I:8403;447;panned, literal delivery of one.
I:8403;448;"I especially loved Ben's answer when his father, enquiring about his Quixotic plan to marry Mrs. Robinson's daughter Elaine (Katharine Ross), asks, ""Isn't this a half."
I:8403;449;"liners
I:8403;450;One of the funniest bits in the movie is when the camera catches his face as Elaine's father comes out of Ben's room spewing obscenities and insults at Ben.
I:8403;451;"What we loved about this movie was the youthful point of view
I:8403;452;But see this for Anne Bancroft, a brilliant and perhaps underrated actress in one of her most memorable roles.
I:8403;453;Many movies have come along but The Graduate is still one of my favorites.
I:8403;454;Im a huge fan of films, and I find unique aspects in films that make me enjoy a film much more than possibly the average viewer.
I:8403;455;Most of the reviews I've read here focus on the technical aspects of the film itself, and that's fine.
I:8403;456;It's about social pressure and the devestating effects it can have on the young .
I:8403;457;old myself, and at the time just saw it as an hilarious comedy.
I:8403;458;Indeed, in the beginning he is a basically sincere and honorable young man.
I:8403;459;The potential, if not the promise, of a happy ending resolves the story about as well as it could have.
I:8403;460;the Graduate is worth watching every few years for a lifetime . . .
I:8403;461;I enjoyed the Dustin Hoffman interview extra.
I:8403;462;It's also an example of courageous young talent in film directing, acting and music.
I:8403;463;What's funny,outrageous, and touching was that once upon a time, a year before I was born, people actually thought this was a good movie.
I:8403;464;For good laughs, watch the movie and then read all the reviews of this movie on.
I:8403;465;I will hold off on purchasing until this is confirmed and I would recommend to others that they do the same.
I:8403;466;this is a great movie that deserves 5 stars and a first class transfer.
I:8403;467;The plot was unique and the acting was great throughout the entire film.
I:8403;468;This masterpiece, with its themes of alienation, idealism, social consciousness, cultural and generation gaps, and the extraordinary music of Simon and Garfunkel, brings back strong and poignant memories of life in the late 1960s and early '70s.
I:8403;469;benjamin Braddock, (superbly portrayed by Dustin Hoffman), has just graduated from college.
I:8403;470;As the film begins, the Braddocks are throwing a party for their son, the successful new grad.
I:8403;471;He returns to his room as if it were the womb, and watches the aquarium.
I:8403;472;Enter the famous Mrs. Robinson, and may I say BRAVO Anne Bancroft!
I:8403;473;elaine Robinson, (Katherine Ross), daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Robinson, is about to come home from college.
I:8403;474;Benjamin is forbidden to date her, by his lover, who happens to be her mother.
I:8403;475;Of course the now jaded Benjamin and the fresh, lovely Elaine will go out, fall in love, and you'll have to see the movie for the rest.
I:8403;476;anne Bancroft, in her gorgeous prime, is perfect as Mrs. Robinson.
I:8403;477;She is also sad, sarcastic, manipulative, at times really b*tchy, brittle in her beauty, and vulnerable in the role.
I:8403;478;Nichols won the Best Director award for this movie.
I:8403;479;His pacing is fluid, and his imagery metaphorical, at times chillingly so.
I:8403;480;Writers Buck Henry and Calder Willingham, (working from Charles Webb's novel), did a remarkable job with their satirical, off.
I:8403;481;"Simon and Garfunkel songs, including ""Scarborough Fair"" and ""The Sounds of Silence,"" give the film a wonderful lyrical tone."
I:8403;482;Great cast and great sound track.
I:8403;483;Dustin Hoffman was so good and a Simon and Garfunkel sound track reminds me being young.
I:8403;484;I enjoyed it much more this time of watching it.
I:8403;485;A trip down nostalgia's lane as we are treated to a young Dustin Hoffman and an older woman,Ann Bancroft with some twists and turns thrown in.
I:8403;486;Cameo appearance by some that you will immediately recognize are great.
I:8403;487;The cars,hair and lifestyles documented from the 60 s are a fun trip.
I:8403;488;I just watch this movie again and again.
I:8403;489;and then I like the movie as well.
I:8403;490;And then I love the way the movie reflect the times.
I:8403;491;and technically this is a good movie.
I:8403;492;and then Dustin :) Few things come out perfect in life.
I:8403;493;this is one such movie.
I:8403;494;All film students should see this film!
I:8403;495;This is a lovely film portraying a young Dustin Hoffman as a college graduate (Ben) who comes home to find that he has no direction in life.
I:8403;496;In regards to the cinematography, there are lovely camera shots and angles with the scenes filmed at Barkley.
I:8403;497;"Of course ""The Graduate"" is an iconic film."
I:8403;498;The casting and the performances are dead.
I:8403;499;Buck Henry did a very good job with the screenplay.
I:8403;500;They (and the actors) are gifted translators of Webb's work, but that's all.
I:8403;501;I'm going through the list of AFI Top 100 movies, and for the most part it has been very enjoyable.
I:8403;502;"I was pleasantly surprised with titles like ""All About Eve"", ""A Clockwork Orange"", and ""On the Waterfront""."
I:8403;503;Mrs. Robinson also had the added bonus of being especially hateful without any specific motivation.
I:8403;504;A vindictive bat and a jellyfish.
I:8403;505;Katherine Ross looks lovely as Elaine, but she's barely one.
I:8403;506;well, I was so glad the movie was over, I kinda liked it.
I:8403;507;The Graduate of course is in my top 5 favorite films.
I:8403;508;like most rich people, the Braddocks and the Robinsons seem to have absolutely everything that human beings could possibly want, as long as you view them from the sidewalks that edge their front yards.
I:8403;509;Still one of the very best movies of all time.
I:8403;510;It is worth watching just to see Ann Bancroft at her very best.
I:8403;511;director, Nichols, won the Academy Award for Best Director.
I:8403;512;The film was also nominated for 6 other Awards, Best Picture, Best Actor and Actress, and Best Supporting Actress.
I:8403;513;i give this film 4 stars because I thought Dustin Hoffman did a good job.
I:8403;514;I thought that the music complimented the movie nicely as well.
I:8403;515;It was a good film.
I:8403;516;This classic film from director Mike Nichols, his second movie after the great 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf', may have lost its strength in some scenes but other great moments make up for that.
I:8403;517;This leads up to the best known scene with the most memorable line from this film.
I:8403;518;His must show his present which gives us a hilarious scene.
I:8403;519;The strong acting from both Hoffman and Bancroft also help.
I:8403;520;Especially the early scenes from Bancroft are terrific.
I:8403;521;They make us understand why Ben just has to do what he does, also telling us that Ben is not the strongest person in the world.
I:8403;522;the music from Simon and Garfunkel is good, although it does not add something to the film really.
I:8403;523;I liked the songs enough to not have that problem.
I:8403;524;Even if it has flaws, even if it is a little dated at times, it feels fresh and is more entertaining than most films today.
I:8403;525;I remember studying this film in a film appreciation course my freshman year in college.
I:8403;526;I SO enjoyed watching it again after all these years.
I:8403;527;It stands as a brilliant representation of the turning of our American societal consciousness toward the need for greater meaning in life.
I:8403;528;It is at the top of the heap in terms of greatest American films of all time
I:8403;529;This one of the top ten best movies ever made and the Simon and Garfunkel sound track is one of the best ever written.
I:8403;530;Dustin Hoffman and Ann Bancroft are wonderful but do is everyone else including Kathryn Ross and William Daniels Look for the late great Norman Fell and quick on screen appearances by Mike Farrell, Buck Henry and Richard Dryfuss.
I:8403;531;It was put out by Criterion, which continues to do a wonderful job re.
I:8403;532;And, yes, I have listened to the informative, witty and incisive audio commentary a numbe of times.
I:8403;533;THE GRADUATE is worth seeing (for free, on TV) once, I guess, because it takes you somewhere (an affair with your girlfriend's mother) the movies rarely go.
I:8403;534;Also, the late Norman Fell does a superb job playing the kid's landlord.
I:8403;535;Director Francis Ford Coppola uses symbolism well in pictures such as THE OUTSIDERS because his imagery relates to the story.
I:8403;536;ok i see why this is nominated as one of the best films ever.
I:8403;537;im 17 and i still enjoyed it.
I:8403;538;my favorite part was the seduction.
I:8403;539;i practically think its the best movie ever made.
I:8403;540;I saw this movie many years ago and can honestly say that I enjoyed it a lot more now than I did the first time.
I:8403;541;Dustin Hoffman did a great job of acting.
I:8403;542;i ordered the graduate and it arrived in perfect condition and well before the initial due date.
I:8403;543;Mike Nichols did a great job.
I:8403;544;Finally saw this terrific movie.
I:8403;545;Truly a classic worth seeing
I:8403;546;You don't what love is until you see this movie!
I:8403;547;He accomplished what society deems as a success but ponders the point of living.
I:8403;548;He finds meaning and direction in life through sex and love.
I:8403;549;The women in the movie perfectly exemplify the one night stand girl and the one you'd want to marry.
I:8403;550;This inspiring story is what every man needs to get a beautiful girl.
I:8403;551;The Graduate is one of the greatest stories ever told, the music by Simon and Garfunkle is excellent, and the reply value can't be beat.
I:8403;552;i really enjoyed this movie.
I:8403;553;told me i should watch this but it was great.
I:8403;554;"Dustin Hoffman is hilarious and This provides interesting background to Rumor Has it(with JENNIFER ANNISTON 
I:8403;555;"This is one of those rare ""classics"", a film that towers above the rest."
I:8403;556;we see Dustin Hoffman, a newly graduated kid on his way to college, moping around the house in the summer.
I:8403;557;"Anne Bancroft(perfect for the role) plays the older woman who is, in fact, ""trying to seduce"" Hoffman."
I:8403;558;things get downright comedic when Katherine Ross, portrayed as Elaine Robinson, daughter of Mrs. Robinson, shows up and decides she wants to date Hoffman's character, Ben Braddock.
I:8403;559;this is a funny, sassy, witty, and tremendous film.
I:8403;560;After all, Amazon does tell us to 'make it fun'!
I:8403;561;How does that woman even remotely take you seriously (we are talking about a beautiful, well.
I:8403;562;social to everyone he meets.Yet, despite the contrived love story and illicit romance, this film does work and is quite entertaining, mainly because of the great cinematography, writing, music, directing and acting.
I:8403;563;And Katherine Ross not only possesses the prettiest brown eyes you'll ever see, but by the end of the film we all can't help but to fall in love w/ her winsome, wholesome ways.
I:8403;564;Classic Simon and Garfunkel songs fit in perfectly, and the story is ageless.
I:8403;565;One of the signature films of the 1960s, this feature introduced the world to Hoffman and gave Bancroft a racy role she played with marvelous feline cunning.
I:8403;566;This sublime black comedy transcends its period, speaking to new generations of alienated youth beginning to navigate a discordant, dysfunctional adult world.
I:8403;567;The supporting cast, including deft character players William Daniels and Murray Hamilton, are note.
I:8403;568;perfect, and that Simon and Garfunkel score still stirs the soul.
I:8403;569;it is simple enough to watch, but unique enough to be memorable!
I:8403;570;For this fine movieThat shows youth's pain and perilsI've one word: plastics
I:8403;571;The movie made during the Vietnam War, and agitators are mentioned a couple of times during the film.
I:8403;572;"this ""Free love"" might be able to possibly extend to Mrs. Robinson, the women whom seduced Ben."
I:8403;573;Firstly that Mr's Robinson was the key to what he wanted and the freedom he so much thought he deserved.
I:8403;574;all in this entire movie is about a transitional change from a more conservative culture to a more liberal one.
I:8403;575;It plays upon the fact that love can be used for ill or for gain.
I:8403;576;Mike Nichols went from a successful career as a comedian to a successful career as a filmmaker.
I:8403;577;He was smart, funny and pointed in his view of American life.
I:8403;578;This collaboration was magical and influenced a generation of movies.
I:8403;579;"Its greatest irony, though, is that ""the counterculture"" embraced the film as an anti."
I:8403;580;"viewing it today can be seen as ""dated,"" but it also allows us to separate the social themes of 1967 (especially Viet Nam) from the appeal to the universal."
I:8403;581;As Ross Perot, used to say, look, it's simple:1.
I:8403;582;The literary impulse to romance proposed can seal the illusion.
I:8403;583;elaine remains a lovely cypher thoughout this movie.
I:8403;584;Katharine Ross is interviewed as well and she still looks great.
I:8403;585;I'm sure you know the plotline by now.
I:8403;586;time greatest endings to ANY movie ever filmed.
I:8403;587;I rewind and watch this ending over and over again, it's so freakin' cool.
I:8403;588;This is a great, vital, classic film.
I:8403;589;The Graduate: 40th Anniversary Edition is presented 16:9 enhanced for widescreen TVs.
I:8403;590;Colors, skin tones, contrast, it's a thing of beauty.
I:8403;591;Very well made movie, interesting story, great casting, good humor, and quite famous in pop culture.
I:8403;592;Bancroft and Hoffman displayed their rich talents through the portrayal of their characters in a highly impressive manner.
I:8403;593;There was a good balance between comedy and drama.
I:8403;594;The main characters are individuals who, in their own way, are seeking happiness.
I:8403;595;A great character study is truly contained in this motion picture in a way that is not quite equalled forty years after the fact.
I:8403;596;Good movie, Although What would you do if it happen to you?
I:8403;597;one of best comedies of all time.
I:8403;598;the best movie of 1969 dustin hoffman is the best must see movie i recommend what else you can see many times
I:8403;599;This film tells a terrific story of a young fellow who was a loser from the word go.
I:8403;600;Everything was simply given to this spoiled rich kid, and when the time came for him to be on his own.
I:8403;601;oh certainly he messed and played around, propagating The Graduate's utterly enjoyable character.
I:8403;602;It is a terrific film, and everyone should see it.
I:8403;603;what a great performance Hoffman gives us.
I:8403;604;well it is unbelievable really, unlike anything I have seen.
I:8403;605;There are so many good ideas in this movie.
I:8403;606;the more you watch the movie you will see that everything, no matter how small, will lead to something.
I:8403;607;EVERYTHING in this movie is important and will lead to the next scene or situation.
I:8403;608;notch, from the performances to the creative yet unintrusive photography to the insightful and amusing script to the wonderful Simon Garfunkel score.
I:8403;609;There are countless memorable scenes.
I:8403;610;Hard to remember how cutting edge this was when it came out.
I:8403;611;Worth it for film buffs!
I:8403;612;A delightfully wry comedy and possibly the first and last time Dustin Hoffman was cast as an attractive man.
I:8403;613;He is wonderfully droll as Benjamin Braddock, the 21.
I:8403;614;The music by Simon and Garfunkle is great and almost on it's own make the filom worthwhile.
I:8403;615;But it is the wonderful script, acting, and direction that allowed this film to be voted number seven on the American Film Institute's top 100 films of all time.
I:8403;616;The Graduate is undoubtedly a monumental work that has revolutionized cinema forever.
I:8403;617;assured, unprepared acting of a young Dustin Hoffman perfectly characterized the cultural icon Benjamin Braddock.
I:8403;618;The simply profound, sexy but cruel, seductive personality of Mrs. Robinson, illustrated by the late Anne Bancroft embodied the whole decade.
I:8403;619;The Graduate was a wonderful film when first released, and even though it is now rather dated it still is wonderful.
I:8403;620;An all around great movie that's message has not been lost, even after 35 years.
I:8403;621;This is an amazing movie, and is best seen by high school/collage aged people, as they begin to question the ethics of the adult world.
I:8403;622;Her surprising motive is revealed later.
I:8403;623;All in all, it's a strong movie, and a classic for good reason.
I:8403;624;even Simon and Garfunkel's beautiful soundtrack accurately coincide with the film's central character and his general outlook on life as a graduate.
I:8403;625;for those who haven't seen it, The Graduate has it all: drama, humor, great music, and wonderful camera techniques.
I:8403;626;But most importantly, it provides a voice for all those like myself, who are trying to disturb the sounds of silence.
I:8403;627;a revolutionary film for any generation.
I:8403;628;Needless to say I did not get to watch it then and now that I have viewed it I enjoyed the memories of that night at the drive in.
I:8403;629;One of the best films ever made.
I:8403;630;This film is still relevant after almost 50 years!
I:8403;631;Give yourself a treat and watch it again!
I:8403;632;Great movie, an essential watch for any cinema fan.
I:8403;633;"Dustin Hoffman's casting is often described as ""perfect"" ."
I:8403;634;but it is actually a distraction.
I:8403;635;His physical appeal is the only reason Mrs. Robinson dallies with him .
I:8403;636;it is true that the film's fancy camerawork and the sophomoric, pseudo.
I:8403;637;which are so valuable to today's Hollywood director.
I:8403;638;The film deserved to be a commercial success.
I:8403;639;Even after all these years, it may even worth the time needed to see it .
I:8403;640;"grope of your girlfriend's breasts in the neighbor's basement a ""great romance."""
I:8403;641;The Graduate is a funny and important film.
I:8403;642;The performance of Bancroft and Hoffman and Mike Nichol's direction helped the film.
I:8403;643;The originality of the script and the performance helped boost the comedy level.
I:8403;644;The interview with Dustin Hoffman and the making of the movie documentary was interesting and resourceful.
I:8403;645;I bought this movie at a price of 17.00(new).
I:8403;646;I recommend this movie to everybody who loves comedy and great movies.
I:8403;647;It is said that she came to resent the way she was remembered by the mass public only for her role in THE GRADUATE, bemoaning the fact that even her best screen work (playing Annie Sullivan in Arthur Penn's film of THE MIRACLE WORKER, for which she won the Oscar) was in its shadow.
I:8403;648;no matter what the part, big or small, Bancroft was always amazing, and always classy, and that's what made her such a good screen partner (and life partner) to the unapologetically vulgar Mel Brooks.
I:8403;649;Tonight we will look up towards the heavens and we'll see a new star burning in the sky with a fierce intensity.
I:8403;650;Goodnight, Anne Bancroft, shine on, shine on.
I:8403;651;In my junior year in high school, I finally decided to take the film study class.
I:8403;652;I was most impressed with the selection of films for the quarter.
I:8403;653;From the very first scene when Ben is on the airplane to the last scene on the bus, I could finally pick my favorite movie of all time.
I:8403;654;Ben continues to worry about his future, so he decides to engage in the opportunity.
I:8403;655;An excellent plot and the timing is just right on.
I:8403;656;"Simon and Garfunkel helped with the hit song ""Mrs. Robinson"" that was specifically for the movie."
I:8403;657;Although I am usually not a fan of zooming, Nichols using this effect masterfully.
I:8403;658;It was fun to see how young Dustin Hoffman was when he made this movie.
I:8403;659;The Graduate, an all time favorite.
I:8403;660;Truly, enjoyed this story, and Dustin Hoffman with Anne Bancoft.
I:8403;661;price was right and delivered in time
I:8403;662;Brilliant acting, by both Hoffman and Bancroft, make this easily my favorite movie.
I:8403;663;Acting aside, the script is excellent, and the ending is one of the best I've ever seen.
I:8403;664;Either way, the movie is incredible.
I:8403;665;True, the acting is impressive, but in the final analysis can't really carry the premises or the overwrought pretentions to serious social commentary.
I:8403;666;In the end, The Graduate is a film about the search for true happiness and the stress that comes along with it.
I:8403;667;She's a friend of the families and asks Benjamin if she could get a ride home in his new car.
I:8403;668;this is a wonderful film with superb performances from all the players.
I:8403;669;Mike Nichols, a wonderful comic director, does some great camera angels.
I:8403;670;He's an actors director and it defiently shows.
I:8403;671;It's fits perfecty with the movie and Benjamin's state of mind.
I:8403;672;It's a film I can go back to many times and still enjoy.
I:8403;673;release this major classic (one in my personal top.5 list.)
I:8403;674;In addition, the color rendition of the Reg 2 version is far superior to this one (and all previous Reg 1 versions).
I:8403;675;Like J. d. Salinger's The Catcher In The Rye, The Graduate is an offbeat, tenderly funny and ultimately poignant tale of alienation and youthful angst.
I:8403;676;age story that manages to avoid the pitfalls and platitudes that tend to plague the genre, and winds up saying something truly original about growing up in the modern world, about coming to terms with our futures and confusions, about understanding the people around us, about finding our way and falling in love.
I:8403;677;It does so with a quiet sense of humor, a perennially wistful tone, and a really cool Simon and Garfunkel soundtrack.
I:8403;678;the people behind the film are wonderful.
I:8403;679;eyed introspection and sly wit, earning our sympathies before the opening credits are over and keeping us on his side through the cathartic finale.
I:8403;680;legendary Mrs. Robinson with smoldering sexuality and a sharp sociopathic edge.
I:8403;681;The script is a mixture of stinging satire and tender, clich .
I:8403;682;free romance, with plenty of memorable lines and iconic images.
I:8403;683;the result is a classic movie, and one that every human being with a pulse should see (preferably before they turn 25).
I:8403;684;"Now let this movie find a place in your heart (""Plastics!"")"
I:8403;685;Funny and just as good as it was the day it was released.
I:8403;686;Dustin was so cute back then, so was Katherine Ross, with those big, beautiful blue eyes of hers, and Anne Bancroft wasn't too shabby, either!
I:8403;687;A must see, anyway, was a great movie!
I:8403;688;Dustin Hoffman in the title role is splendid in his portrayal of the neophyte male college graduate who is expected to take his place in corporate society.
I:8403;689;What a great movie, one that someone of any age can get something out of.
I:8403;690;Dustin is superb as the college grad that has always done well, but is now sort of aimless and confused about what to do next.
I:8403;691;and he finally has to take a stand and figure out what he really does want.
I:8403;692;the acting is great, the dialogue is great, and even the cinematography is excellent in conveying the mood of the various scenes.
I:8403;693;The soundtrack works extremely well with the atmosphere.
I:8403;694;It seems to be a very strong 'Jesus' symbolism .
I:8403;695;It's amazing that the whole dynamic of that scene changes when you realize he was simply pounding to get her attention, and that the 'shape' was a necessity and not a choice.
I:8403;696;definitely a movie that gives you more with each watching.
I:8403;697;The cast is an awesome line up.
I:8403;698;It really is a true classic.
I:8403;699;it is so brilliant, that I could watch it over and over again.
I:8403;700;Dustin Hoffman (Benjamin Braddock) is great in this, and the late Anne Bancroft (Mrs Robinson) is classic.
I:8403;701;It's hilarious and everyone who wants a laugh should see this.
I:8403;702;The director won Best Director for this (Mike Nichols).
I:8403;703;It's an excellent film that I love a lot and still laugh in.
I:8403;704;A bit dated for today's audience, this film still retains the art that made it more than entertainment.
I:8403;705;back in the days when it was more common for students to skip grades, Benjamin was set up as the brilliant prodigal son, graduating from college early and ready to conquer the world.
I:8403;706;The world of hippies, flower power and the generational yearning to change the world was happening all around Benjamin, and he was caught in the molasses of upper.
I:8403;707;Elaine Robinson, who Benjamin finds he is in love with and wants to marry, is played by the beautiful Katharine Ross.
I:8403;708;the cast includes numerous other names that are very recognizable today, including a very young Richard Dreyfuss.
I:8403;709;Adding the artistic beauty of the cinematography, the incredible acting by not only the lead actors but all the supporting actors, and the score by Simon and Garfunkel, this movie was virtually an instant classic that has served as an example for dozens of artistic movies through the present day.
I:8403;710;At least one copy of this movie is a must.
I:8403;711;Groundbreaking film that once again shatters the trappings of a previous decade.
I:8403;712;"Bravo to Hoffman in his finest role of tortured, lost innocence
I:8403;713;Characters are well developed and well portrayed.
I:8403;714;It is the type of movie that stays with one long after watching it.
I:8403;715;One of the best movies of all times and, of course, a great sound track.
I:8403;716;Watch it with the next generation.
I:8403;717;So thanks for the viewing first!
I:8403;718;But the movie is about more than this one young man, and it's about more than just the 60s.
I:8403;719;This movie captures the chaos that is change.
I:8403;720;In the end, every thing has a place in this movie.
I:8403;721;Many of the elements seem more suitable for an avant.
I:8403;722;garde film project than a major motion picture release.
I:8403;723;the acting performances by Dustin Hoffman, Anne Bancroft and Katherine Ross are all stellar, and the music of Simon and Garfunkel is molded to fit every scene perfectly.
I:8403;724;True, a lot has been said about these things.
I:8403;725;Still, they are so good that one cannot say enough about them.
I:8403;726;Hoffman and Bancroft in particular truly do give performances of their lifetimes.
I:8403;727;On both fronts, mission accomplished.
I:8403;728;And the music is one of the best scores written for a film ever.
I:8403;729;the cinematography is some of the most interesting ever.
I:8403;730;It's hard to describe the power of scenes like after Hoffman reveals to his girlfriend that her mother was the woman he was with.
I:8403;731;It's just one example of truly pivotal work in the history of film.
I:8403;732;This movie will give any film lover hours of viewing pleasure and plenty of things to reflect on.
I:8403;733;which is clear and intelligible throughout.
I:8403;734;as for the movie itself, the performance by Dustin Hoffman is superb.
I:8403;735;"i feel he perfectly captured all the mannerisms
I:8403;736;in a way that is so subtle but still hilariously funny at the same time.
I:8403;737;that it deserves some major credit (this was after all his first major role.)
I:8403;738;which just shows what a great performance it really is (not that this reviewer thought so, but I can see how it can be interpreted that way)The directing is also flawless, and a Mike Nichols movie through and through.
I:8403;739;All in all, a true gem that can be highly recommended.
I:8403;740;Nearly everyone who has seen THE GRADUATE hails it as a major masterpiece of American cinema.
I:8403;741;THE GRADUATE is alternatingly hilarious, serious, undecided, and sexual, exactly the mix that appeals across the board to any generation.
I:8403;742;Much of the power of the film lies in a series of vignettes that illustrate this gap between the earnest callowness of youth and the foolish, sometimes vindictive ingrained attitudes of Ben's family and of the vicious Queen Bee herself, Mrs. Robinson.
I:8403;743;The seduction scenes between Ben and Mrs. robinson are both funny and pathetic.
I:8403;744;Funny in that she has a world of sophistication that constantly exposes his lack of it.
I:8403;745;Elaine shouts back, while her mother slaps her face.
I:8403;746;Yet, one of the least analyzed moments comes at the very end when Ben and Elaine dash out of the church, she in a wedding gown, he in a jogging suit, to seek refuge in a passing bus.
I:8403;747;Their expressions are at first ecstatically happy.
I:8403;748;They may in fact love one another, but each has been rudely yanked out of their comfortable Southern California affluent life to live in the real world where maturity is but one asset needed to enjoy that love.
I:8403;749;THE GRADUATE is a magnificent ensemble of sight, sound, mood, and acting, but it is this subtle call to the need to reach out for a mature perspective about why we do things the way that we do that makes this movie as timeless now as it was back in 1967.
I:8403;750;i am a child of the 60's and enjoy almost all the popular culture from that era with just a few exceptions.
I:8403;751;The 2nd film appearance by Dustin Hoffman and 2nd directing job for Mike Nichols plus a stellar supporting cast and superior writing by Buck Henry and Calder Willingham make The Graduate a must see for mature movie lovers and a must own on Blu Ray if you are a collector of classic films.
I:8403;752;The colors are good and strong and except for one moment where a horizontal white streak flashes across the screen for less than 1 second the image is stable.
I:8403;753;A good remastering job would work wonders for this title as the original elements appear to be in very good shape and most likely a nice 4k rescanning job would work wonders all by itself.
I:8403;754;Oh well, we have what we have and it is more than watchable.
I:8403;755;For a film released back in 1967 this is a VERY good sounding audio mix, especially with the low budget they had to work with back then.
I:8403;756;the Graduate is a true classic and as such deserves to be in your film library.
I:8403;757;I really enjoyed this movie.
I:8403;758;Ive always wanted to see it.
I:8403;759;Its a classic and a must see!
I:8403;760;What great fun to see award winning movies for my younger years.
I:8403;761;This was 1 of the best movies ever made for me.
I:8403;762;One of the best, no special effects just great acting from all of the actors, and actresses.
I:8403;763;One of the movies that shaped a generation.
I:8403;764;A dramatic triumph in the form of Dustin Hoffman's debut performance as the feckless Benjamin.
I:8403;765;Fresh out of college, he has a promising life ahead of him.
I:8403;766;A powerful film, whose final shot speaks to today's generation of young graduates, just as it did to the generation 30 years ago.
I:8403;767;The Graduate is a perfect mix of comedy and drama.
I:8403;768;I would really like to give this movie infinite stars!
I:8403;769;The writing is both hilarious and wrenching and the cinematography, while wildly creative, is not at all distracting or self.
I:8403;770;The perfect pairing of these components with the incredible Simon and Garfunkle soundtrack make for the most nuanced, subtle, and serendipitous film I have ever seen.
I:8403;771;The flawless artistry of its production has produced an immortal story that transcends the medium of film.
I:8403;772;This movie changed my life and I recommend it to absolutely everyone.
I:8403;773;With one of the best wedding scenes and soundtrack the movie is great on every level.
I:8403;774;Thanks for a riotous evening and a great flick!
I:8403;775;This is a must see movie.
I:8403;776;It has great camera work for its time and a great story line, A Must see!
I:8403;777;High on the list of the best movies I've ever seen.
I:8403;778;Very entertaining movie, well acted.
I:8403;779;"Being a huge fan of Anderson and Wilson's work, I figured I'd give ""The Graduate"" another try."
I:8403;780;The film is damn near perfect.
I:8403;781;benjamin and Mrs. Robinson's seduction scene is a wonder of comic awkwardness.
I:8403;782;Hoffman relaxes around Ross, putting on a cloak of easy charisma and charm, allowing the honest emotions of his love to shine through.
I:8403;783;Ross, for her part, is always open and receptive to Ben, and even gives back as much as she gets.
I:8403;784;"The act is scored, again paradoxically perfectly, by another S&G
I:8403;785;"With its constant wish of ""then she'll be a true love of mine"", it too captures the mood of the sequence perfectly."
I:8403;786;And thanks to the care the filmmakers took in setting him up, you can't help but feel for Ben as he runs through the streets of Santa Barbara looking for Elaine's wedding.
I:8403;787;"Just follow the bouncy beat, hum ""coo coo ca."
I:8403;788;"choo"", and long for the innocent days when Joe DiMaggio held the gaze of a nation's lonely eyes."
I:8403;789;down fiancee, and their future together appears to be filled with laughter.
I:8403;790;"i didn't expect it to be, but ""The Graduate"" is still fresh today, more than thirty years after its first release."
I:8403;791;And it's also about a lot more than adultery, post.
I:8403;792;It has much critical to say about the generation from whence it sprang.
I:8403;793;I suspect Mike Nichols, whose direction is whimsical and witty without ever being overbearing, and Buck Henry/Calder Willingham, whose screenplay abounds with sharp jokes and sharper observations about human nature, deserve a lot of the credit.
I:8403;794;"Regardless, ""The Graduate"" is one of those rare films whose appeal and importance hasn't lessened over time
I:8403;795;Dustin Hoffman was hilarious as a 20 year old Benjamin Bradock.
I:8403;796;dustin Hoffman is in one of his many great films.
I:8403;797;anne Bancroft does a great job.
I:8403;798;the music is also a perfect match to the film.
I:8403;799;it has aged very well.
I:8403;800;it captures the time period really well.
I:8403;801;My 21 year old grand daughter has never seen it, so we both watched it .
I:8403;802;This movie is a classic example of how good films were even as recent as the 1960's.
I:8403;803;The backdrop (Southern and Northern California), the wonderful musical score (Simon and Garfunkel) and great cast made this movie very worthwhile to see as well.
I:8403;804;If you enjoy movies made with thought and care behind it, you should definitely check this one out!
I:8403;805;DTS sound is soo superior to Dolby, and this movie has the great Simon and Garfunkel soundtrack to make you appreciate it.
I:8403;806;it is soo superior to pan.
I:8403;807;It has a truly great list of special extras too.
I:8403;808;"Try ""Students of the Graduate,"" where other famous directors critique one of the greatest films of all time."
I:8403;809;I am in love with this film, and this edition.
I:8403;810;One of the best movies of the 1960s.
I:8403;811;Mike Nichols won the Oscar for Best Director.
I:8403;812;At last, an anamorphic transfer of this classic.
I:8403;813;The acting and the intelligent writing stand the test of time in this wonderful film.
I:8403;814;It is a real treasure
I:8403;815;The Graduate has become a classic film, one that makes all those `top 100 film' lists.
I:8403;816;simon and Garfunkle provide the music in their inimitable style and the title song, Mrs Robinson, was a huge hit for them.
I:8403;817;Director Mike Nichols managed, in this film, to capture the feel and mood of the 60's flawlessly and he deservedly won an Oscar for his work.
I:8403;818;This is a film that has stood the test of time and is still worth watching today.
I:8403;819;seeing it years later I think it is a great film.
I:8403;820;Where?Would have liked to have read it.
I:8403;821;But I am judging it because I liked the film and I can also appreciate fact that this film was groundbreaking at the time I am giving it four instead of three stars.
I:8403;822;And so this is the perfect opportunity for Mrs. Robinson a bored alcoholic housewife who despises her husband to pounce on him.
I:8403;823;hoffman is terrific as the confused Benjamin adding wonderful comic timing and making this film throroughly entertaining.
I:8403;824;i liked the fact that Elaine was not written as a sickly sweet young thing and you can fully believe in them as a couple and you can see what they see in eachother.
I:8403;825;"but the ending is best on film
I:8403;826;Great acting, great directing, great cinematography, and great music (Simon and Garfunkel).
I:8403;827;The Graduate is truly a classic work of filmmaking.
I:8403;828;The acting by all is top.
I:8403;829;The chemistry/tension between Benjamin and Mrs. robinson is absolutely amazing.
I:8403;830;I also like the fact that the end is not a pretty, happy.
I:8403;831;I found that to be very realistic.
I:8403;832;It is rarely 100% good.
I:8403;833;An astounding piece of work.
I:8403;834;I love Dustin Hoffman's acting, and this being his first movie has always bee a favorite of mine.
I:8403;835;So in that sense I can understand why it is considered a classic.
I:8403;836;"stylistically, ""The Graduate"" scored big."
I:8403;837;And the film has many other interesting shots throughout.
I:8403;838;i found this movie interesting and entertaining enough, but I didn't fall in love with it.
I:8403;839;good film it is about more than several trucs i love this america!
I:8403;840;Somehow I forgot the romance between the Dustin Hoffman character and the daughter of Anne Bancroft character's (Mrs. Robinson, of course).
I:8403;841;She introduced so many famous actors, including Dustin Hoffman and John Voight.
I:8403;842;The Graduate is portrays the era very well and stands up over time.
I:8403;843;I loved the movie back in the 60's, but nowadays would have fallen for Anne Bancroft's character!
I:8403;844;A wonderful movie well acted and directed.
I:8403;845;And the extras are excellent, too.
I:8403;846;The camera work and blocking of scenes is utterly spectacular.
I:8403;847;Get out the church key and crack open a can of Olympia beer.
I:8403;848;mastered in the anamorphic splendor that it deserves.
I:8403;849;It has a all star cast and you will love it!
I:8403;850;Loved it as it is the classic.
I:8403;851;I may not have found any direction, but I did find a witty, smart comedy about a recent college graduate.
I:8403;852;as Benjamin Braddock, Dustin Hoffman was brilliant.
I:8403;853;I could sympathize with his search for something worthwhile in the days following his graduation from college.
I:8403;854;The party scene at his house where all of the adults are asking Benjamin what he is going to do and offering their advice is particularly amusing.
I:8403;855;mrs. Robinson, his friend's attractive mother was also played very well.
I:8403;856;In his relationship with Mrs. Robinson, we see Benjamin go from a shy, unconfident boy to a man confident in his sexuality and with his affair with Mrs. Robinson.
I:8403;857;The Sounds of Silence was a perfect choice for this movie and it may be a bit over used, but it is nevertheless effective.
I:8403;858;there is a reason that The American Film Institute ranked this film as the 8th best ever made.
I:8403;859;release and was stunned by the story, acting and directing.
I:8403;860;But what a great job he did with casting, camera, music and even the supporting players whom will be familiar to most TV viewers.
I:8403;861;This movie captured the era so perfectly!
I:8403;862;Dialogue was minimalist but brilliant.
I:8403;863;Directed masterfully, great casting and performances.
I:8403;864;Now, 20 years later, I relate to other themes besides the often mentioned 'societal expectations' of young people.
I:8403;865;The most successful stories are ones which people can identify with, and The Graduate hits a home run.
I:8403;866;There's a character here for everyone.
I:8403;867;Paul Simon's best writing 'makes' the movie, providing a score that is second to none.
I:8403;868;Heaven loves you more than you can say, hey, hey, hey.
I:8403;869;Some of the best music of the 60s, by Simon and Garfunkle, makes up the sound track for this iconic movie with Dustin Hoffman (looking impossibly young), Ann Bancroft (looking incredibly wicked and sexy), and Katherine Ross (looking incredibly innocent).
I:8403;870;Coerce your teenage kids into re.
I:8403;871;watching this film with you.
I:8403;872;This movie explores the complicated duality of the post graduate mind and the search for ones place in society.
I:8403;873;It all starts with the casting.
I:8403;874;Pairing Anne Bancroft with Dustin Hoffman is Hollywood heaven.
I:8403;875;Then he makes the miraculous comeback, finding true love, incomprehensilbly, with the very daughter of the woman he's been suducing.
I:8403;876;Bancroft is witty, manipulative, and incredibly seductive as the older woman.
I:8403;877;Hoffman has the vulnerablility and the heart to make us care deeply about his fate.
I:8403;878;Katherine Ross is a babe in full bloom which alone is worth the watch.
I:8403;879;things that bothered me:they played the same 3 songs throughout the entire movie.
I:8403;880;a memorable classic from the sixties.
I:8403;881;Actually it has enough elements of both to keep you interested until the climax which is quite creative and guaranteed to leave the viewer feeling satisfied.
I:8403;882;Mike Nicholls, however, did manage to win an Oscar for Best Director and nominations were received for Best Actor (Dustin Hoffman), Best Actress (Anne Bancroft), Best Supporting Actress (Katherine Ross), Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Cinematography.
I:8403;883;This movie was considered daring in content in its time, might be today by some.
I:8403;884;It has a great story line for the wishful thinking young man seeking love with an older women.
I:8403;885;It is full of many complications surrounding the affair, but the outcome is somewhat of a live happy every after for this young man and his future bride.
I:8403;886;Watch it you will like it and if you have seen it before , then watch it again as I did and you will enjoyed it.
I:8403;887;It's offbeat, out there and hilarious.
I:8403;888;It's quite a genre buster, comedy, tragedy, revolution, tons of stuff.
I:8403;889;Ben Braddock is just out of college, an award winning scholar and a track star.
I:8403;890;The premise is that a brilliant young man questions the direction of his career and the expectations of his family and family friends.
I:8403;891;Definitely the movie that made Dustin Hoffman's movie acting career, and features many other famous actors.
I:8403;892;Pretty much everybody agrres that this movie is a classic.
I:8403;893;Anne Bancroft is not the perfect looking woman, but she does have the capability and, in a certain way, the charm to seduce the young graduate.
I:8403;894;The photography, the music and the perfomance of the cast is superb.
I:8403;895;The Graduate is a touchstone film.
I:8403;896;The movie portrays the coming of age, sexual freedom and wayward view of the young adults of the 60's, the almost plastic existence of their future.
I:8403;897;He was thirty years old when he filmed the picture, but he perfectly captures the youthful, nave essence of the part.
I:8403;898;Ms. Bancroft brings a sexy and sultry flair to the film and her role as a sexual predator was stunning at the time.
I:8403;899;"Of course the movie produced the number one hit ""Mrs. Robinson"" which won a Grammy as Record of the Year in 1968."
I:8403;900;The Graduate is closer to his comedy roots, but he perfectly balances out the humor with dramatic moments.
I:8403;901;He won the Oscar for Best Director in 1967 and The Graduate still remains his crowning moment.
I:8403;902;dustin Hoffman's breakout role is perfectly backed up by the story of a young, 21 year old man who falls in love with a young girl after having an affair with her mother.
I:8403;903;the performances are powerful and affecting, even Mike Nichols'.
I:8403;904;very existential, it's a film that presents a hero who finds himself constantly alone in the world, and even his convictions seem unable to pull him together.
I:8403;905;now that I'm done with the review proper, I thought I'd point out something interesting I discovered during my recent reviewing of this film.
I:8403;906;"modern day ""Indie"" music is like this throwback to the acoustic folksy rock of the 60s, so of course sounds a lot like our friends Mssrs Simon and Garfunkel, who of course play the music for this wonderful movie."
I:8403;907;It's just something really interesting about how this film looks considering contemporary culture.
I:8403;908;The narrative takes you through evolutions in his life.
I:8403;909;He does this mainly because Mrs. Robinson tells him what to do and how to do it.
I:8403;910;She returns to Berkeley and after being pursued by Ben tells him that he mother told her that Ben had raped her.
I:8403;911;Ben has just graduated from college and he gets into a relationship with a woman 20.30 yrs his senior.
I:8403;912;the movie was very well done, however.
I:8403;913;The lighting and film shots add a certain feeling to the film.
I:8403;914;Also the music brought you in deeper.
I:8403;915;They give you a sense of hope and a strange sense of despair all at the same time.
I:8403;916;The songs fit wonderfully with the narrative.
I:8403;917;I recommend it to anyone.
I:8403;918;The film is most famous for the scene in which Mrs. Robinson seduces the young Hoffman (Mrs. Robinson, I think you are trying to seduce me).
I:8403;919;Including also in the film is the symbolic, melancholy Sounds Of Silence .
I:8403;920;written screenplay, powerful and impressive performances by all the actors, great music, some comedy, irony, realism.
I:8403;921;perfect fusion of dialogue, cinematography, music, acting, editing, direction to produce unforgettable scenes and images.
I:8403;922;What a grate movie, always wanted to see it and this blu.
I:8403;923;Takes me back a few years, but enjoyed watching The Graduate again.
I:8403;924;Great acting by a very young Dustin Hoffman.
I:8403;925;Everything is nearly perfect about it.
I:8403;926;"The ""Graduate"" is a great film and I grow to love it more with each viewing."
I:8403;927;The script, Mike Nichols' direction, the performances of Dustin Hoffman, Anne Bancroft and Katherine Ross, the music of Simon and Garfunkel.
I:8403;928;"The movie starts with the ultimate young man's fantasy
I:8403;929;The film then gravitates to just what is this young man fresh out of college going to do with his life?
I:8403;930;"This was Dustin Hoffman's first major role and Anne Bancroft is amazing as the ""older woman."
I:8403;931;Interspersed throughout the movie is the songs and stylings of Simon and Garfunkle.
I:8403;932;"Our nation turns its lonely eyes to you:"" have become a part of our national lexicon."
I:8403;933;The film is an American classic and well worth the view.
I:8403;934;It was great when I was young, After 30 years I did not like it so much.
I:8403;935;It's been years since I saw this movie and it was a pleasure to revisit it.
I:8403;936;I has it's moments and a memorable soundtrack, but it just didn't make sense for a college graduate of his social class to experience such existential anguish about his future.
I:8403;937;The Graduate is one of those films that you think about after you have seen it.
I:8403;938;may alienate some, but I loved it.
I:8403;939;But other than that, the picture is fine.
I:8403;940;my only reservations about this disc are the lack of the mono track and lack of 16:9 enhancement to the video, but this is an otherwise fine disc.
I:8403;941;This movie added a new (at the time) bit of terminology to the societal lexicon.
I:8403;942;the role that made him a star) has just got his Bachelor's degree and a new Alfa Romeo as a graduation present (must be nice to be an attorney's kid).
I:8403;943;There's a paradox in that.
I:8403;944;subtle sign of the Generation Gap right there.
I:8403;945;toy with her baby girl.
I:8403;946;Like the way Simon and Garfunkel's music gets used.
I:8403;947;The tendency of the adults to yammer nonstop at the younger people as if so much as pausing to draw a breath means defeat of some sort.
I:8403;948;A great classic that must be watched.
I:8403;949;This music from Simon and Garfunkel was great.
I:8403;950;Elaine is perfectly portrayed by Katherine Ross, in stunning contrast to Brenda Patimkin played by Ali MacGraw two years later in Goodbye, Columbus.
I:8403;951;Nichols' brilliant work in his film earned for him an Academy Award as best director.
I:8403;952;the comic moments are memorable (some indelible) but the humor is essentially bittersweet, as is the humor Nichols created with his former associate Elaine May.
I:8403;953;As indicated previously, I think so highly of this film because Nichols has brilliantly combined and integrated just about everything a great film requires: a compelling story, great acting and cinematography, memorable (and appropriate) music, and effective use of humor.
I:8403;954;"Many people believe that this film offers a ""window"" to upper."
I:8403;955;The first movie I saw Hoffman in and one of his best.
I:8403;956;All performances are spot on and the stir very interesting.
I:8403;957;This film features an amazing performance by Richard Dreyfuss!
I:8403;958;Fell's performance sets the tone for his entire later career.
I:8403;959;that's what liberals call a 'happy ending.'
I:8403;960;What is at first a racy romp of a movie turns shrill at the end, when the movie takes its focus off Ben and Mrs. Robinson's dalliance and focuses more on a hero's quest for the heart of the woman he loves, with much screaming and nastiness abounding.
I:8403;961;Dustin Hoffman is a brilliant comic actor, playing the nervous, puzzled Ben, and Mike Nichols' directing is fun and very much the product of an era.
I:8403;962;Oh, great Simon and Garfunkel soundtrack too.
I:8403;963;This was a good movie when it came out and is still good after all these years.
I:8403;964;I enjoyed it then and I enjoyed it again this year
I:8403;965;This movie has become a classic.
I:8403;966;Those of us who lived through this period can relate.
I:8403;967;This movie is still a classic of the hedonism of 60s America.
I:8403;968;The 5 stars come from my wife who really likes this film.
I:8403;969;done in places, but still a good movie.
I:8403;970;I also have hardcover version the novel written by Charles Webb!Gotta love the characters Benjamin (Dustin Hoffman, my all time favorite actor ever!
I:8403;971;I love this movie, always loved it, even in Lo.
I:8403;972;"at the top of his lungs as Katherine Ross stands at the alter about to say ""I do,"" more riveting and dramatic in Hi."
I:8403;973;Bancroft's Mrs. Robinson is the consumate cougar, and her performance is iconic.
I:8403;974;And she IS hot, as well as deliciously, stalkerishly creepy in this role!
I:8403;975;dustin Hoffman's portrayal of the confused and obsessed Benjamin Braddock is pitch perfect.
I:8403;976;This story never gets old, it's classic, timeless, and set to a sweet Simon and Garfunkel soundtrack.
I:8403;977;It's an important movie, whatever definition you've got.
I:8403;978;Everyone should see this movie.
I:8403;979;The supporting cast is believable and deliver outstanding performances.
I:8403;980;It is a slice of life which is as poignant today as it was in 1967.
I:8403;981;The Simon Garfunkle sound track is a perfect match and serves to evoke all the emotions that the characters are feeling.
I:8403;982;Ben's mom dad are hilarious in their efforts to be part of, but not intrusive in, his life.
I:8403;983;The older movies are sometimes better than modern ones.
I:8403;984;I would recommend it for others to watch.
I:8403;985;A landmark film that's still just as pungent .
I:8403;986;Anne Bancroft is tremendously fun at first.
I:8403;987;She's the amusingly voracious middle.
I:8403;988;Benjamin is in love with Mrs. Robinson's fresh, wide.
I:8403;989;Dustin Hoffman is excellent, I love Anne Bancroft in the film, Kathren Ross shimmers, and Mike Nichols shares his visions.
I:8403;990;love stuff, but the storyline was excellent and difficult to turn away.
I:8403;991;first and foremost, this is a classic morality play.
I:8403;992;it speaks volumes about the choices we make and their conseqences.
I:8403;993;it is endlessly fascinating thatmrs robinson chooses to confront benjamin with her sexual desiresas he stands in front of elaine's portrait.
I:8403;994;water is the essence of life.
I:8403;995;it sustains us and we cant livewithout it.
I:8403;996;mike nichols then shoots the most poignant rack focus shot i have everseen.
I:8403;997;mr and mrs robinson are divorcing and who knows where life will take them.
I:8403;998;This movie is truly a classic and will be for all time.
I:8403;999;Hoffman improves with every movie he has made since.
I:8403;1000;The reviews across the years caused me to want to see it.
I:8403;1001;"Keep the ""old ones"" coming!"
I:8403;1002;I love movies, particularly the classics and this movie is one of the few that lives up to all the hype.
I:8403;1003;The entire cast was perfect and the acting as well as the script were phenomenal.
I:8403;1004;Well directed by Mike Nichols, great job by Dustin Hoffman early in his career and very nice songs from Simon and Garfunkel
I:8403;1005;This is the movie that brought Simon and Garfunkel's music to the forefront and changed the lives of Mrs. Robin sons forever!
I:8403;1006;So, going into the movie, I knew I was going to see a great film.
I:8403;1007;As I watched the film, I was aware certainly that I was watching a cinema classic, but I was taken by surprise at just how hilarious the movie is.
I:8403;1008;Calder Willingham and Buck Henry's script makes it obvious that they have been paying close attention to the way people behave in middle class, academic society, and when they get it just right, it proves to be amazing how funny we naturally are.
I:8403;1009;Mike Nichols' choice to stick closely to the script pays off, and he is still more than able to insert his own style into the film.
I:8403;1010;The film has almost has many unforgettable images as it does quotes.
I:8403;1011;Perhaps most importantly to the film's success is the brilliant cast, particularly Hoffman.
I:8403;1012;His comic timing in this film earned him his well.
I:8403;1013;"deserved shot to stardom
I:8403;1014;You will come for the hype, which it certainly deserves, but you'll stay for the laughs, and they will keep you coming back.
I:8403;1015;They are not my favorite music group of that time, but their music is fine in this movie.
I:8403;1016;Just watch it for the simple fact that it's a classic.
I:8403;1017;Great acting on everyone's part and solid writing.
I:8403;1018;I gave a high credit to this movie.
I:8403;1019;and this is the beauty of a movie isnt it?
I:8403;1020;The actors and actresses in this film were well cast and the story line well developed.
I:8403;1021;A classic that everyone should see.
I:8403;1022;Really takes one back to the 60's.
I:8403;1023;There are so many hysterical scenes in this movie.
I:8403;1024;Listening to Hoffman's commentary is very interesting.
I:8403;1025;Most refreshing and rare among celebrities.
I:8403;1026;Anytime you want it, come and get it.
I:8403;1027;This is really a good movie.
I:8403;1028;Mike Nichols' THE GRADUATE (1967), brilliantly written by Buck Henry and Calder Willingham, is a timeless film masterpiece that speaks profoundly to me.
I:8403;1029;All three actors got Oscar nominations, the script was also nominated, and Nichols won Best Director.
I:8403;1030;This is an amazing work of art that speaks to an entire generation, just as REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE (1955) spoke to an earlier generation.
I:8403;1031;what is amazing about THE GRADUATE is that it is totally free of things that might date it, like sex and drug love.
I:8403;1032;ins, love beads, and hippies.
I:8403;1033;Surtees and Nichols constantly do interesting things with the Panavision canvas, like beautiful soft lighting and backgrounds in focus while foregrounds are fuzzy.
I:8403;1034;the dazzling editing is by Sam O'Steen, who later worked with Polanski on CHINATOWN (1974).
I:8403;1035;He has fun with the big seduction scene and quick cutting, as well as the legendary cut from swimming pool mattress to Mrs. Robinson's bed.
I:8403;1036;Surtees, O'Steen, and Nichols are a dream team to match the dazzling performances.
I:8403;1037;For those who care, the movie is NOT in anamorphic widescreen, but looks great in regular 2.35 widescreen with beautiful color and matchless compositions.
I:8403;1038;I saw 2013's Gravity and 1967's The Graduate in the same weekend and there is no comparison to what film is better and will continue to stand the test of time.
I:8403;1039;Every shot in this movie is perfect, all of the performances are wonderful, and the Simon and Garfunkel.
I:8403;1040;fueled soundtrack is solemnly beautiful.
I:8403;1041;as for how important this film is, let's just say it defined a generation in the 1970s.
I:8403;1042;"And nearly anyone in either high school or college (or a recent ""graduate"" entering the working world) when the film was released can quote verbatim important lines and whole scenes."
I:8403;1043;Of course I remember many of the great moments (the finale at the church, for one) and the Simon and Garfunkel soundtrack.
I:8403;1044;(Dave Grusin wrote the incidental music.)
I:8403;1045;first off the transfer is great!
I:8403;1046;I watched this on an 25 year old 26 in TV and it was still perfect.
I:8403;1047;okay, now the bonus features.
I:8403;1048;, That's fine with me, but most of us have the music in our collection.
I:8403;1049;The second commentary is with Director Mike Nichols and Director Stephen Soderburgh.
I:8403;1050;And Nichols is very outgoing here.
I:8403;1051;"minute documentary: ""Students of the Graduate"" which has interviews with young directors who learned techniques from Nichols direction."
I:8403;1052;"what I found MOST interesting was a ""One on One"" featurette with Dustin Hoffman which runs 22 minutes."
I:8403;1053;so there is lots to watch here and moments to remember.
I:8403;1054;I, for one, loved this set and the special featurettes .
I:8403;1055;A defining movie of the 1960's, THE GRADUATE remains a unique movie that stands up extremely well today.
I:8403;1056;Mike Nichols displays his extraordinary talent for extracting terrific performances from his talented cast as well as providing a unique cinematic experience.
I:8403;1057;The use of unusual camera shots to create mood and heighten emotion without special effects is a standard that today's film makers would do well to emulate.
I:8403;1058;dustin Hoffman gives an inspired performance as Benjamin Braddock .
I:8403;1059;His portrayal is subtle in so many respects.
I:8403;1060;The full range of her acting abilities shines through in one of the key bedroom scenes where she seamlessly transitions from hard.
I:8403;1061;other fine performances (large and small) from a noted supporting cast include Katherine Ross, Murry Hamilton, William Daniels, Elizabeth Wilson and Buck Henry.
I:8403;1062;I wanted a family move and thought that PG would be safe.
I:8403;1063;Dustin Hoffman is so incredible and Kathryn Ross is beautiful and timeless.
I:8403;1064;It's a classic and the acting is superb!
I:8403;1065;The Graduate is one of the best movies ever made.
I:8403;1066;The cinematography is ahead of its time and you can't beat the music.
I:8403;1067;Funny, sexy and serious you won't be dissappointed.
I:8403;1068;Dustin Hoffman is amazing in this film.
I:8403;1069;And the music still charms.
I:8403;1070;This is my favorite movie of all time.
I:8403;1071;It is absolutely wonderful, both hilarious and touching.
I:8403;1072;Hoffman's performance is first rate.
I:8403;1073;subtle symbolism pervades the movie.
I:8403;1074;Ben is drowning, and the director often shoots him in water, or looking through water.
I:8403;1075;She is engaged to be married to someone else.
I:8403;1076;the Simon and Garfunkle soundtrack is flawless, many of the songs written specifically for this movie.
I:8403;1077;The finest American movie ever made.
I:8403;1078;Beyond being a remarkable film, it is a movie which, unlike plenty of its peers, still holds up extremely well today.
I:8403;1079;Mike Nichol's best film, in my opinion.
I:8403;1080;Mrs Mel Brooks is outstanding.
I:8403;1081;an interesting look at it's time period.
I:8403;1082;Although I am younger, I have seen many classic movies, and this is definitely one of the best ever.
I:8403;1083;Dustin Hoffman and Anne Bancroft were magnificent.
I:8403;1084;His work behind the camera is evident in this 1967 winner of five Academy Awards, including best director.
I:8403;1085;Mike Nichols is an excellent director, and this is one of his best movies.
I:8403;1086;i recommend this movie to one and all.
I:8403;1087;It is a classic and I knew he would enjoy it!
I:8403;1088;The Graduate to me is a perfect film from the performances (especially Bancroft's deep dark voice.
I:8403;1089;to the amazing soundtrack by Simon and Garfunkel which really epitomizes late sixties America to Mike Nichol's superb direction for which he received the Oscar.
I:8403;1090;The movie would receive a total of seven Oscar nominations and go on to become one of the most critically acclaimed films ever.
I:8403;1091;I skipped church to see this movie back in 1973 when I was I junior in high school.
I:8403;1092;Great script, acting, directing, cinematography, music.
I:8403;1093;A treat to watch through and through.
I:8403;1094;Life never looked so stylish and funny.
I:8403;1095;Wether you're a film aficionado or a pup culture junky, this is a definite must see as an american cinematic classic.
I:8403;1096;This movie is classic and worth the watch.
I:8403;1097;It is amazing to watch Dustin Hoffman as a youngster.
I:8403;1098;Act I constitutes Ben finding that there is a way out of this plastic world .
I:8403;1099;"act Two constitutes the montage sequence, so masterfully done by Nichols with Simon and Garfunkel's ""Scarborough Fair"" background."
I:8403;1100;The film is a classic: timeless, relevant, and naked in its message.
I:8403;1101;Dustin Hoffman and Anne Bancroft still shine in this true classic.
I:8403;1102;In the top 25 all time.
I:8403;1103;A great story with great music.
I:8403;1104;Upon viewing the movie, it is easy to see why it is so endearing.
I:8403;1105;the Graduate is a great blend of comic timing and drama.
I:8403;1106;Hoffman and Bancroft are irreplaceable in their respective roles, with many people still claiming to relate to Hoffman's character even though they've never been in a similar situation.
I:8403;1107;This is truly a classic film that I believe will still be brought up 50 years from now.
I:8403;1108;The music in this movie really makes is moving and emotional.
I:8403;1109;I recommend it to everyone.
I:8403;1110;This is a classic movie!
I:8403;1111;Great cast and great music.
I:8403;1112;This is a very good movie made in a time where movies were just starting to broach *unseemly* topics.
I:8403;1113;or the topic which is timeless as well.
I:8403;1114;Even Mrs Robinson who has, perhaps the best opportunity wants no part of the whole package.
I:8403;1115;"From the classic line ""PLASTICS!"""
I:8403;1116;looking all but crusified this is an important and at times very entertaining film.
I:8403;1117;If you are over 50, you'll appreciate being transported back in time.
I:8403;1118;The Graduate is still prime Boomer comfort and soul food.
I:8403;1119;Yet again , great to watch.
I:8403;1120;This is a classic movie and is indeed a movie I can watch again ever so often .
I:8403;1121;This was a movie I'd been meaning to see for quite a while and it was a good watch, very interesting.
I:8403;1122;I loved the musical score the first time I saw it, and I loved it this time, too.
I:8403;1123;This movie launched the careers of music icons Simon and Garfunkel, with such songs as Bridge Over Troubled Waters.
I:8403;1124;The movie established a new genre in films.
I:8403;1125;I so love this movie.
I:8403;1126;And also a great soundtrack with Simon and Garfunkel.
I:8403;1127;Very enjoyable time capsule of upper.
I:8403;1128;class WASP existence in the mid.
I:8403;1129;sixties, just before everything hit the fan.
I:8403;1130;Anne Bancroft is superb and mesmerizing as the self.
I:8403;1131;Dustin Hoffman is great too, as is the screenplay and direction.
I:8403;1132;Still fun but not as much.
I:8403;1133;Perhaps, this movie is in top three of all time favorites.
I:8403;1134;Great play, great music, great characters, and yeah, plastics!!
I:8403;1135;watched The Graduate recently, and wow, it is still as relevant and poignant as ever.
I:8403;1136;It is such a great movie.
I:8403;1137;I forgot how great it was.
I:8403;1138;the unique camera angles and imagery.
I:8403;1139;It generates such emotion and empathy for each character by the viewer, and it is a classic statement about the generation gap.
I:8403;1140;The subject matter was a little iffy but overall I think it was a good movie.
I:8403;1141;"Ben perfectly captures the zeitgeist of the late 1960s
I:8403;1142;fashion respect for elders .
I:8403;1143;He sees in her daughter the dreams and desires he so needs.
I:8403;1144;"watching ""The Graduate"" for the first time creates in a viewer a series of ""oh, that's where that came from"" moments, similar to reading ""Hamlet"" or watching ""The Wizard of Oz"" or ""The Godfather""."
I:8403;1145;I finally got around to seeing The Graduate after many years of wanting to.
I:8403;1146;Mrs Robinson is a family friend with an attractive daughter (katherine Ross) whom Hoffman eventually goes after, much to the disapproval of Mrs Robinson.
I:8403;1147;blessed with a beautiful Simon and Garfunkel soundtrack, this film is basically fun to watch from start to finish.
I:8403;1148;"Some reviewers have called it ""dated"", but that's actually what makes it so special."
I:8403;1149;"There are some great lines in the film, and some of them were used in a George Michael song ""Too Funky""."
I:8403;1150;out movie and it features an excellent performance by Anne Bancroft.
I:8403;1151;It's held up very well.
I:8403;1152;This movie has aged incredibly well.
I:8403;1153;While it is a film of its time, it is also timeless.
I:8403;1154;The soundtrack, the performances, the salacious affair between Ben and Mrs. Robinson .
I:8403;1155;The movie is just as funny and engaging as it must have been 45 years ago.
I:8403;1156;If you are any sort of a movie buff and haven't seen The Graduate, it is a must see.
I:8403;1157;An iconic American movie about alienation, with excellent Simon and Garfunkel soundtrack.
I:8403;1158;The Graduate is a must.
I:8403;1159;see for anyone who wants to be knowledgeable about movies.
I:8403;1160;this show is a good show.
I:8403;1161;Ann Bancroft was at one of her best in this show.
I:8403;1162;I watch this show many times.
I:8403;1163;This movie gets better with age.
I:8403;1164;The music is of my era and reflects the mood of the 60's.
I:8403;1165;An all around good WATCH.
I:8403;1166;Bancroft and Hoffman are pitch perfect.
I:8403;1167;"release from 2005 with ""Best Sellers"" slapped onto the cover."
I:8403;1168;For a nearly 30 year old movie, the transfer is amazing.
