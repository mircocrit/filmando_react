1;If you don't mind the language then you will most likely like the movie.
2;Everyone kept telling me how great this film was and that I HAD to see it.
3;Robin Williams was brilliant, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck had moments of brilliance.
4;There are some moments where real emotion is shown and it draws us in.
5;this movie is good, but it could have been great.
6;Praise was universal on this first writing effort from Damon and Affleck, which is just that, a first time effort.
7;A more interesting story is between Williams and former roommate Skarsgard.
8;This is a good film, nothing more.
9;Has anyone ever met a genius janitor.
10;Ohhh let's have a fight and see who can say the most clever line.
11;Robin Williams steals the movie, he won an Oscar best supporting actor.
12;Damon and Affleck's screenplay is pretty good but not spectacular.
13;Robin Williams role is amazing.
14;This movie actually provides a good example of unconditional positive regard from a therapist.
15;Script and acting are well done.
16;Another great film which is one my favorites.
17;It's a got a great cast.
18;With a very inspiring story.
19;A movie that's got a little bit of everything from comedy, romance, drama and action.
20;I was actually more interested in seeing about a girl who went to the movie with me.
21;Good Will Hunting is a movie that touches on a number of particularly interesting themes in education and learning, and makes a profound statement about what it means to be accomplished.

24;affirming movie leaves us with a new understanding of the difference between being academically trained, and the perspectives that can only be gained from authentic experience.
25;I am so glad I bought it .
26;The therapeutic relationship between Damon and Williams is what won Affleck and Damon the oscar for best screenplay.

30;charges at the public library.
31;the title of the movie itself, 'Good Will Hunting', gives us a paradox in the form of a question, What's so good about Will?
32;of course, one could also see the title 'Good Will Hunting' as the search for goodwill in people's lives and our own.
33;in one clever scene, Hunting takes his best friend Chuckie (Ben Affleck) and two other Southie sidekicks to a Cambridge bar.
34;As Hunting and friends depart, Skylar approaches and hands him her number.
35;as another reviewer notes, Good Will Hunting is good and original.
36;I'd agree that the film nicely portrays lower class Boston Irish life, and the strange match between a high class orphan (and upper.
37;class) Harvard woman and a brilliant street tough, whose early life was marred by constant physical abuse.
38;The acting in general is very strong, with Robin Williams (as always) at the head of the class.
39;but the Matt Damon and Ben Affleck screenplay, while often fine and riveting, is also at times completely nave.
40;Everyone even slightly familiar with psychological therapy knows this is genuinely incredible (as in not believable).

42;Robin Williams continues to amaze with his ability to mesmerize in any role.

55;This movie is one of the most incredible films I have ever seen.

58;He is helped along by a psychiatrist
59;Gritty, realistic, and captivating, this is well worth the money.
60;True stories will always be the best.

63;recommend for family with teens
64;This movie is fantstic!It was well written and acted.
65;this was the first movie I saw Ben Affleck and Matt Damon in and I think they give great preformances here and just keep on giving them.
66;They also wrote a wonderful movie.
67;I'm so gracious that they finally gave Robin Williams an Oscar.
68;He finds change and perhaps that is why I like this movie so much.
69;matt Damon and Robin Williams played two of the best roles I have ever seen.
70;The outer boundaries of the realm of human emotion are experienced each time I view this movie.
71;It is the film that established Ben Affleck and Matt Damon as the mega stars they would one day become.
72;He came up hard in Boston and has to struggle to make it in life.
73;A local professor sees Hunting's potential and intercedes with the judge who grudgingly allows for Hunting's parole.
74;This was his Oscar winning role.
75;star review and it is the 536th overall.
76;A very good movie to watch with the family.
77;Good performances by Robin Williams, Matt Damon, Ben and Casey Affleck and Skaarsgard.
78;What takes this script to another level though are the marvelous performances that embody the film.
79;I was really taken aback by everyone in the cast
80;to me, this film is above all else an acting showcase and I will review it as such.
81;For a long time I considered Matt to be just another pretty face
82;This performance was probably the first real confirmation of his talent.
83;Damon's performance on the other hand is one of the strongest.
84;We see the breakdown of his soul and understand who he is on the inside
85;This is such a marvelous performance, one that is truly deserving of the praise and accolades it garnered (bravo to the Oscar nomination) and one that you truly won't forget.
86;I loved his calm and restrained insanity demonstrated in `One Hour Photo' and `Insomnia'.
87;I thought that Williams' performance was touching and sincere, yet it is not outstanding, thus I feel that his Oscar win was a bit of a stretch (personally I felt both Kinnear and Reynolds were more deserving).
88;As Doctor Sean Maguire he does what he can to make his clich d character real and understandable, and there are moments where he really grabs me (one such moment is his adlibbed spiel about his wife's flatulence which I found hilarious yet emotionally resonant to his characters warmth) yet his performance to me is not nearly as memorable as those provided by the remaining cast members.
89;His character was so natural and believable and even moving.
90;Maybe that's because he wrote the character for himself, I don't know, but he really nailed this one.
91;Throughout the film his character takes a backseat to Damon, but he never allows himself to drift into the background completely, and there are moments where he really steals the limelight and shines the brightest.
92;One scene in particular comes near the end of the film, when he character Chuckie is having his `heart to heart' with Will.
93;Affleck expresses so much emotional depth here, so much natural and heartfelt warmth and understanding that it serves as one of the most fundamental scenes in the film.
94;Affleck may never be this good again, but at least he was this good once.
95;now I am a huge fan of Stellan Skarsgard.
96;I just love the majority of his work.
97;His performances in the films of Lars von Treir are what initially grabbed me (I just adored his devilish qualities in both `Dogville' and `Breaking the Waves') but time and time again he manages to grip me completely.
98;i'll make a quick note before moving forward that both Casey Affleck and Cole Hauser are effective in their small roles as friends of Will and Chuckie.
99;Give him a decent movie already.
100;Her performance, for me at least, is best in show.
101;I think that she is an extremely talented actress who just soars in both charm and beauty and charisma and natural grace.
102;As Skylar, Will's love interest, she is a dynamic force, a joyous and lovable portrayal of honest emotion.
103;I love the way that her character feels real
104;Her final scene with Will breaks my heart into a million pieces every time I see it.
105;Every time I watch this movie, especially during that climatic scene, I am compelled to utter those words aloud.
106;So there you have it
107;As a film itself (that is script wise) it is nothing spectacular, but the many moving performances make this a must see film.
108;I can somewhat agree with the sentiments that this is an overrated film for it is not as impressive as many films released that same year, but acting wise it is close to the front of the pack (it's hard because 1997 also brought us `L. a. Confidential' which sports some of the best performances of the year as well).
109;I'm still amazed that these two guys, relatively young, wrote such an excellent, mature, funny and touching movie script.
110;Well acted, great story, and Robin Williams is a treat.
111;highly recommended for family viewing.
112;GWH is a great story from the internal struggles of a young man to a college professor and how their lives affect their friends and colleagues.
113;this must be one of the greatest movies in recent Hollywood history.
114;Like all truly great movies, this one is built multi.
115;dimensionally, with an intelligent large.
116;scale development (global movie structure, several parallel stories between main characters, excellent dialogs in major scenes), while at the same time realizing that beauty lies in the detail (shading of supporting characters and interactions between them, witty dialogs in 'smaller' scenes which are not directly related to the main plot, music which beautifully underlines the plot and the characters).
117;On the highest level there are relationships between Will and his girlfriend, between Will and his best buddy, and Will and his tutor No. 1 (Sean).
118;what I absolutely love about this movie are the dialogs.
119;And then there are those beautiful 'side.
120;this is a very, very good movie.
121;And that's a good thing.
122;and that makes it perfect.
123;And that's exactly why we're perfect for each other.
124;And that's probably why this movie is perfect for myself.
125;One of the best movies of all time about a janitor who is secretly a genius at MIT.
126;There were few films in 1997 that enjoyed more publicity than Good Will Hunting.
127;What started out as a rather average comedy, soon evolved into a sophisticated drama.
128;In my opinion, the motion picture academy was correct in awarding the Oscar for best screenplay to Good Will Hunting.
129;Everything about the script suggested writers with a profound understanding of the human condition
130;It offers a unique insight into the background of the writing and filming of Good Will Hunting.
131;Surprisingly, one of the best support performances was produced by Casey Affleck, who is Ben's cousin, (I think).
132;After all, the tall poppy syndrome is strongest when it comes to intellect.
133;will Hunting was undeniably bright.
134;Will also manages to win our sympathy despite his I. q. Not so much because he acts like one of the boys but because we discover early on that for every blessing he received in the brain department, he was given a matching curse in his life.
135;He is an award winning mathematician and professor at MIT where Will works as a janitor.
136;He shares a common background with Will, and if anything, he has had more pain in his life than Will may ever see.
137;the film is rich with detail and is a wonderful medium for the support actors.
138;Ben Affleck's role as Will's best friend is not as visible as Matt Damon's but he carries it off with just the right amount of fatalism and aggression.
139;Will's Lady friend Skylar, is also worth special mention.
140;Minnie Driver takes a seemingly token love interest role and breaths real depth into it.
141;good Will Hunting is a tribute to the dreams of American youth.
142;Both because two young men managed to reach the pinnacle of their craft on their first outing but more importantly, because it deals with one young man's struggle to overcome his troublesome past while reaching out to grasp life, love and happiness.
143;It's touching, entertaining and at the same time inspirational.
144;Anyone who enjoys a good movie will like this movie.
145;It is an excellent movie overall and everyone I know who's watched it has liked it.
146;Good story and well directed.
147;You can count on Robin to portray his characters well.
148;Viewed: 8/03, 4/04, 12/06, 2/12Rate: 1012/06: No doubt, Good Will Hunting is a brilliant film.
149;The acting is uniformly excellent.
150;Because of his experience in making juvenile delinquent films, Gus Van Sant is perfect for Good Will Hunting.
151;Much of what Will Hunting, played exceptionally by Matt Damon, represents is found through me.
152;I lived my life exactly what was said through the dialogues in Good Will Hunting, and it's completely well.
153;What makes Will Hunting so unique is his complex characterization.
154;The psychological side of Good Will Hunting is right on the money.
155;Robin Williams proves once again that he is one of the best actors when it comes to dramas.
156;Don't forget what he did in Awakenings, one of the most beautifully acted and underrated performance of his career, and The Fisher King.
157;Ben Affleck and Minnie Driver did a wonderful job in terms of complementing along with the storyline of Good Will Hunting, and a lot of credit also goes to Stellan Skarsgard.
158;All in all, Good Will Hunting is a phenomenally made film and earns the best picture of 1997 from me.
159;Good Will Hunting is one of the best films I've seen in my life.2/12: When I saw Good Will Hunting the first time, it felt like I was seeing myself in it.
160;Since then, I've seen the movie repeatedly, and it has held up very well to this day.
161;written screenplay, and captivating issues make Good Will Hunting a pleasurable film to watch.
162;Last night I saw another recent American movie that has been enjoying the reputation of a masterpiece here in Europe: Tony Kaye's _American History X_.
163;It IS a masterpiece .
164;gripping, affecting from the first minute to the last.
165;(The cast, including Hollywood legends in supporting roles, is uniformly superb, but Edward Norton tops them all.)
166;I'm no Robin Williams fan, but I thought he was considered to be one of the greatest American actors of his generation.
167;The commentary with Ben Affleck, Matt Damon and the Director was great.
168;It gave great insight into the movie and was actually enjoyable to watch all the way through (watching the movie with all commentary).
169;This one was great because it gave great insight to what the actors, writers (with this one, the main characters were the writers), and the director explained a lot about what they wanted, what they were thinking, and even why they did what they did in some scenes.
170;Plus Matt Damon and Ben Affleck made the commentary fun to watch with side jokes.
171;This movie was widely applauded when it came out, replete with Oscar Nominations and awards as well.
172;My favorite scene is in the college bar where Will puts a cocky, know.
173;Robin Williams does indeed deliver an Oscar.
174;thanks, R. w, for the clarification.
175;i highly recommend this movie!
176;Matt and Ben do a great job of showing what friendships are about.
177;This movie was received in timely manner.
178;Nobody in the professor's classroom claims credit for it, so he puts another one on the board and Will solves that one, too.
179;The professor tracks him down and manages to get him released in exchange for two promises: he will do some high.
180;level math work with the professor, and he will see a therapist.
181;will is a genuine genius, but he tends to see it as more of a burden than a blessing.
182;And after all, he does have the terrific face and body of Matt Damon.
183;Good Will Hunting is a classic.
184;ray simply offers a better view of a perfect movie.
185;Arrived in a timely manner and in excellent condition.
186;Good story, great casting,and superb acting.
187;add to this superb screenplay the support of wonderful actors like Robin Williams, who won a best supporting actor oscar for his role as the psychiatrist who unlocks the secrets to the protagonist (Will Hunting)and allows him to grow and mature.
188;Minnie Driver is also excellent as the love interest drawing Will Hunting toward his beckoning adulthood.
189;She is also the occasion for the single best line in the film
190;This film works so well on so many levels that it is really a shame that it lost the Oscar for best picture to Shakespeare In Love, for this is a far more powerful, enduring, and worthwhile film experience.
191;This just means the insides of the book in this case Will Hunting are smart and beautiful.
192;See a young adult orphaned young use a system to get what he wants.
193;An outstanding movie with Oscar Performances.
194;The acting and writing do an outstanding job of connecting with the viewer emotionally.
195;The characters are real and identifiable to the audience.
196;This is one of the best movies of all time.
197;The dialogue is absolutely great!
198;The cast is top notch!
199;What a way to launch a movie career, write your own fantastic script.
200;Back in '98 the storyline,script and new young actors made for an interesting film.
201;It's one of those classics (and will maintain classic status) for years to come.
202;I've seen it maybe 8 or 10 times and still love it every time.
203;A touching movie that helped me heal when Williams' character tells Will, It's not your fault.
204;Really good acting in this movie.
205;(In real life, Affleck and Damon are good friends and co. wrote the screenplay, which won an Oscar and a Golden Globe
206;med student (well played by Minnie Driver) he meets in a bar.
207;There's a good scene .
208;Still, the movie's heart is in the right place and the ending worked for me.
209;This has to be one of the best movies ever.
210;Robin Williams plays a psychiatrist with a big heart and a passion for his field.
211;I had never seen this movie, and a friend told me I should watch it.
212;I bought it and was very pleased with the time it took to get this movie.
213;I really enjoyed it and thank you for your professionalism.
214;It looks into emotions stuffed in the closet and achievement in spite of one's own resistance to moving forward in life.
215;Certainly causes you to look at the value of friends and your own potential.
216;Every now and then, a movie comes along that absolutely blows your world apart.
217;It gives you a perspective on life that you never had before.
218;It weasels its way into your psyche, unbeknownst to you, and takes root.
219;becoming a major part of your inner workings.
220;ston would be one of my favorite films of all time.
221;these two guys, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, are my contemporaries and I was 24 when this movie touched my heart and soul.
222;That's pretty incredible writing from two young guys in their 20s, which won them both Oscars for Best Original Screenplay.
223;Especially because the film is as fresh and critical today as it ever was.
224;hand with life's greatest successes and achievements.
225;The human condition, especially the condition of being a man, is flopped onto the operating table in Good Will Hunting and surgically dissected into all the psychological bits and quirks that somehow magically come together to create each of our lives.
226;Director Gus Van Sant has never been better in his cinematic craftsmanship, then with his work on Good Will Hunting.
227;He brings his artistic flare and unique storytelling techniques to a more mainstream presentation than his typical indie fare.
228;It's films like this that make someone's career, or bring it back to life.
229;It brought the incredible filmmaking talents of Matt Damon and Ben Affleck to the attention of Hollywood, both for acting and writing.
230;It really introduced us to Stellan Skarsgrd, Minnie Driver, Casey Affleck, and Cole Hauser, all of whom are well known actors now, who got there talents showcased in this film.
231;And it finally gave Robin Williams his much deserved Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, after being nominated for his incredible work in Good Morning Vietnam (1987) and Dead Poets Society (1989).
232;it's hard for me to write about Good Will Hunting because its the kind of complex, intelligent, yet very emotional story that is really best told through film, not writing.
233;I love reading good prose like anyone, but film has a way of bringing that prose to life through its visuals, emotions, and music that our brains just don't create for us in our imaginations quite so viscerally.
234;That being said, I'll do the best I can here!
235;Matt Damon stars as Will Hunting, a mathematical genius in the form of a young man who was an abused orphan.
236;Hunting has struggled all of his life, moving from foster home to foster home, job to job, and brawl to brawl.
237;But living in South Boston, he's made some extremely close friends.
238;played ironically and fortuitously by real life brothers Ben and Casey Affleck and Cole Hauser.
239;It absolutely helps sell the realism of the relationship between these actors that 3 out of 4 of them grew up in Boston together in real life.
240;But before being arrested, he catches the attention of a math professor at Harvard, played brilliantly by Stellan Skarsgrd.
241;Robin Williams plays Maguire with absolute brilliance, creating a character that challenges, helps and befriends Will.
242;The rest of the movie follows this journey through Will's therapy sessions, his new love relationship with Minnie Driver's Skylar, his weekly hang outs with his best friends, and his work with Professor Lambeau solving complex math problems.
243;The journey is really all about Will completing his past and starting to discover who he is and what gifts he has.
244;i think the main reason Good Will Hunting has such a strong place in my heart as a film is because of the story of Will.
245;and continue to experience over and over again throughout life.
246;While I'm no math genius, never been to Boston, or been an orphan, I still strongly relate to the emotional and psychological struggles that Will has.
247;Damon and Affleck clearly wrote this story pulling from their own lives to some degree, their own journeys into male adulthood, and brought a realism to the details of the story that makes this relatable to just about anyone.
248;The jokes and stories in Good Will Hunting are absolutely hilarious and still give me a great laugh now, dozens of times later.
249;And the verbal banter between Skarsgrd and Williams, Williams and Damon, Damon and Driver, and amongst the 4 friends/brothers, is simply some of the best dialog ever written and acted.
250;I laugh, I cry, and I escape in to the world of Will Hunting every single time I watch this movie.
251;i've said before that part of how I judge a movie to be a 4 or 5 star film is because of it's longevity and appeal over time.
252;But over the years, I've connected with Good Will Hunting time and time again.
253;It's one of those movies that I watch once a year, not so much as entertainment but as a heartfelt psychological escape that puts me in touch with the universe as I like to call it.
254;It reconnects me, when I need it to, to the universal energy and truths that we are all continually seeking comfort in.
255;It reminds me that I'm here to live the life I've been given, and not someone else's.
256;But Will has talents and genius that don't really fit into that world.
257;And he's pulled in these two opposite directions, one with his head and one with his heart.
258;Good Will Hunting reminds me to connect my head and my heart and create a path that wins for both.
259;Williams, as the Psychologist, represents our heart, our soul, our gut instincts, our feelings.
260;and.yang characters play out so well when separated into these distinct characters, giving us an external view into our own internal battles.
261;Amazing how this film keeps giving me little kernels of insight into myself and into the universe each time I watch it and internalize it.
262;in terms of filmmaking, Good Will Hunting has excellent production design, Oscar level acting by nearly the entire cast, brilliant writing, subtle but incredible cinematography, and masterful directing.
263;The music and score for Good Will Hunting, while subtle like the photography, are perfectly fitted for the mood, emotion, and story of this film.
264;Music Composer Danny Elfman did his best work here, still to this day.
265;What strikes me most about Director of Photography Jean.Yves Escoffier's work here is the stillness he brings to the shots.
266;He lets the actors, the sets, and the locations do the work, instead of the handheld photography doing the work.
267;But my point is that Good Will Hunting, which pre.
268;i look forward to the eventual release of this cinematic masterpiece on Blu.
269;team someday to bring us another film of this caliber.
270;As far as I'm concerned, they both have yet to top their performances in Good Will Hunting.
271;But they've come really close with their recent work.
272;Damon with the Bourne Trilogy, and Affleck with The Town (2010).
273;and finally good things start happening to him.
274;free school, great job offers, and one of the most beautiful women(Minnie Driver) in the world falls in love with him!
275;Some movies that are worthy of an Academy Award.
276;And, he wins a best suppoting actor award?
277;If you're interested in trying to poduce a movie, you should watch this one if you need a good, hell, i can do that kind of encouragement.
278;There is certainly hunting taking place.
279;He's the genius who cannot be genius because his inner world needs more basic and primitive securities than this before that aspect of his life can be put into perspective.
280;Robin Williams (the psychoanalyst), Ben Affleck (his South Boston best friend) and Minnie Driver (true love.
281;We must start with the given: that we are all looking for happiness.
282;is judged on the basis of whether it can provide us with what we believe or demand happiness to be.
283;The body seems to be a kind of warehouse in which all our experiences.
284;Everything entering into the world that makes survival and security, affection and esteem, and power and control our chief pursuits of happiness has to be judged on the basis of one question: Is it good for me?
285;We must be able to comprehend Will's universe, how it got constructed, and why.
286;What keeps this universe together, working, and why?
287;If unrecognizable, try to grasp Keating's sketch above as something incredibly real that paralyzes the lives of countless individuals.
288;To see this come alive in a screenplay is quite remarkable.
289;No doubt, Gus Van Sant must be given the credit for his directing the incredible performances we see by the cast.
290;It might take several viewings to achieve the full impact.
291;See it as part of that for which Will is hunting.
292;So very happy to see this movie on Blu.
293;And a couple others well worth a look.
294;If this is one of your favorite movies I highly recommend this release.
295;A top 20 film of all.
296;Have seen it 100 times and will see it 100 more!
297;The acting was superb in this film, and that combined with amazing writing made this film truly remarkable.
298;A brilliant screenplay, great performances from everyone, especially from Damon and Williams, and very good directing.
299;it's the story and the performances from Damon and Williams that comes alive in this film.
300;This is a must for everyone.you will be moved by this film.
301;One of the best screenplays I've seen.
302;This movie is a must see.
303;Ben is nothing to write home about in this movie but Damon is excellent.
304;I ordered this great movie for my husband for x mas, and a few days later it is here!
305;The price for this new movie is awesome!!
306;Matt Damon and robin Williams steal the show.
307;This film shows one of the best reasons for a society .
308;This has good acting and good producer realism.
309;This struggle of a janitor to get out of his humble Boston circumstances to the top of the educationational centers of our nation by his supreme knowledge acquired at a library is astounding.
310;It has excellent dialogue, is character driven and has realistic background.
311;It's a bit too word raunchy for smaller kids, and is best for adult audiences.
312;Great price for an even greater movie!
313;The performance by Robin Williams was masterful.
314;The movie was well written and can keep a casual movie fan interested and still stimulate a serious movie watcher.
315;The story was emotional and you feel for the characters.
316;A well deserved oscar for Matt Damon and Ben Afflec.
317;I didn't know if I would like it because Ben Affleck has a large role in the movie and I'm not always his biggest fan, but he did great, everyone acted fantastically, and I was immersed in the story from the very beginning!
318;Sean points out that while Will may be able to talk all about art, war, love, grief, and other aspects of life, he's never actually experienced any of it.
319;This revelation has the effect of instilling in Will a respect for Sean's intelligence and character, allowing him to finally start opening up to someone, and marking a turning point in the movie.
320;robin William's monologue in this scene is probably one of the best pieces of writing Hollywood has come up with in recent years, not for its sappiness, but for its depth, truth, and honesty, and for the clever way that it turns Will's own thoughts against him.
321;so, for these two scenes alone I give this movie 5 stars.
322;There are plenty of other funny and clever scenes that fill the gaps and complete the movie, but these are the most important two, and the ones that make it a must.
323;This movie is the best.
324;Good Will Hunting has the kind of story plot that teaches you something new each and every time you watch it.
325;This movie is very good.
326;The actors are good, especially Minnie Driver and Robin Williams.
327;The screenplay by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck is very good and they certainly deserved their Oscars.
328;The movie describes in a good way how Will Hunting (Damon) tries to find out what's most important, his friends, his girlfriend Skylar (Driver) or a great career.
329;The therapist Sean (Williams), who has a similar background, manages to reach out to him and their one hour conversations turn out to be a very valuable experience to both of them.
330;the movie is great and all the actors are good, it's great to see Robin Williams is a more serious role again.
331;He's made some great roles before but also many odd ones in not so very good movies.
332;He is a very skillful actor and I think he really deserves his Oscar for this one.
333;I like that this story was insightful about Will's life.
334;I also enjoyed performance by Robin Williams.
335;It was just a really nice story and gave me a happy feeling.
336;I want to watch a movie and be left with a good feeling .
337;Product was in excellent condition on arrival.
338;the movie has been and still is a favorite of mine.
339;the actors, especially the main characters, performed well, making the movie interestingand entertaining.
340;I really loved this movie its about a janitor who's grown up in fo foster home and foster home, but hes so smart hes working at a college where he is a janitor, He ends up solving a mathematical formula that no one else can solve, Any way the professor traks him down, you'll have to see the movie, it
341;I've always been a fan of the film, but what I really enjoyed here was the commentary with Damon, Affleck, and Van Sant.
342;You really hear what a labor of love this was (naturally) and I found myself so impressed with the truly genuine (and now famous) relationship between the filmmakers and the city.
343;From the names of each extra or actor to say one line in the film, they knew everyone and came across as really passionate and gracious and intelligent.
344;Excellent movie with brilliant performances by both Matt Damon Robin Williams.
345;Damon deserved an oscar for his performance.
346;Whilst the story line was predictable these two made it surprising, moving and rememberable.
347;My husband and I really enjoy this movie.
348;It's very well done, and a lot of good actors.
349;Lots of heart which is what we like in a movie.
350;As a professional mathematician, I can appreciate the appearance of the mathematical prodigy Will Hunting in the most unusual of places.
351;robin Williams plays a rather unusual psychology professor named Sean Maguire and turned in the best performance in the movie.
352;Despite early setbacks in the counseling relationship between Will and Maguire, Will is able to come to grips with his prodigious talents and troubled past and embarks on what is hopefully a brilliant career.
353;The movie is also about the role of friendship, Ben Affleck plays Will Hunting's boyhood friend that still plays a major role in his life yet understands that the best thing for Will would be for them to part.
354;This realism on the part of the Affleck character and Sean Maguire helps Will to reach an understanding with himself and embark on what should be his true path.
355;written by the stars Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, that itself is one of the wonderful true stories of life.
356;This movie deserved all of the accolades it received.
357;Damon and Affleck are at their best in this classic film.
358;highly recommended to all movie lovers!
359;I really liked Good Will Hunting.
360;It IS a feel good movie, but along the way you get treated to great acting from Robin Williams, good acting from Matt Damon, Minnie Driver and Ben Afflect, and a genuinely funny script.
361;But this is ,after all, the movies and I contend that a little artistic liscence should be granted in such matters.
362;Kudos to Affleck and Damon for beating the odds.
363;One of the best movies ever created.
364;The fact is people are sometimes gifted like that.
365;wizzes As for the relationships between the charactes they're exceedingly believable.
366;They all have a heart of gold you know .
367;A complex character, this Will Hunting.
368;Great performance by Matt Damon.
369;I loved the movie when I saw it years and years ago in a small theater in NYC before all of the press.
370;It is funny to think about Matt Damon and Ben Affleck NOT being the stars they are today.
371;This movie is a great look into their talent not only on the screen, but behind the words.
372;This is a favorite of mine.
373;spoken young man, who others think won't amount to anything other than 'one of the neighborhood gang' surprises everyone, including himself.
374;The dynamic between Matt and Robin very well cast.
375;If you enjoy the 'Bourne' movies, you will enjoy seeing how this builds to them.
376;I was expecting to see Will Hunting go on and get a really good job where he would use his mathematical abilities, become successful and perhaps invent something.
377;One of the best movies for both Damon and the most serious for Robin Williams.
378;wonderful acting, lovely direction and screenplay.
379;Just to watch those scenes again.
380;5 on 5, an excellent movie!
381;someone with a common man's touch who is able to communicate and convince people that his position is the right one
382;This movie sets the audience up to mind things and to build walls between people.
383;The fantastic aspects were not particularly well crafted, and felt a bit clunky at times.
384;I was an interesting movie with very good actors, both actors.
385;A nice feel good and inspiring motion picture.
386;A mutual friend still see him once in a while on the street.
387;I watch it at least once a year and I love it every time.
388;If you have not seen it drop everything and watch it now.
389;Great performances by Matt Damon and Robin Williams.
390;This is a great story and it was told very well.
391;Good Will Hunting is my #1 favorite movie.
392;I have seen it 20+ times over the years.
393;The trailer and back of the box describe what the story is about on the surface, but the real genius of the film, that most people miss, is how it dares you to define what comes naturally to you.
394;What you can do with absolutely no effort.
395;This film actually helped me answer it.
396;The only thing more beautiful than her question is his answer.
397;Good Will Hunting is a wonderful moving that conveys a message that it is never to late to hope for good things for yourself and you don't need a lot of money to be successful, you just need to apply yourself.
398;I love watching this movie.
399;Great when you feel down and wanting to push forward.
400;the film should be an unquestionable success.
401;We have THREE wonderful major supporting actors (Robin Williams stands out, but also Minnie Driver and Stellan Skarsgard)
402;In all, the auguries are good .
403;Damon is best where little is asked for him (Will sweeping floors, Will on the building site)
404;by all means, see what van Sant can do at his best.
405;By all means, glory in Robin Williams' most winning performance.
406;Treat yourself to some really good cinematography.
407;a brilliant masterpiece that will stand the test of time, and rank with the greatest movies of recent memory.
408;Like my favorite quilt on a chilly day, Good Will Hunting has become one of my top go.
409;One of Damon's gate film that I've seen long time ago.
410;very happy with product brand new in the plastic no flaws or blemish.
411;one of the best movies well worth the money.
412;i first saw it in 1998 or so, when I was 11, and loved it.
413;needless to say, there's a good bit more of it that I actually understand.
414;,he came off as quite smart.
415;To be sure he's no genius, but he was plenty intelligent.
416;Robin Williams, as always, a great actor.
417;It is great seeing talented actors when they were younger.
418;Absolutely one of the best films I've seen.
419;Good WillHunting debunks a commonly held myth of the link of formal education with intelligence.
420;Will is a mathematical genius who does not need to pursue it publicly.
421;Will, on the other hand, really could care less!He exhibits his passionate loyalty to his blue collar roots, and no degree of academic prestige is going to diminish this deeply ingrained part of Will.
422;this brings us back to identity studies, and following a vocation and/or lifestyle based on inner self, as Neo.
423;freudian, Erik Erikson, and further identity researchers of the20th century, honed in on.
424;Robin Williams, who ultimately counsels Will, once again, is excellent, as he emphasizes the important things in life.
425;And this experience has powerfully affected the counselor as well.
426;and he then opens Will up to some of the finest pursuits in life.
427;He brought him to see a part of himself he didn't know he had, and knowing it came from this counselor, who has also been through so much pain, Will can himself trust and validate his words.
428;This movie got everything right .
429;superb screenplay and acting, inspiring story, fitting soundtrack, and amazing performances by Robin Williams and Matt Damon to boot.
430;Some of the scenes are incredibly powerful.
431;this is probably my favorite Robin Williams movie.
432;Anyone who appreciates good movies and storytelling shouldn't miss this.
433;It came quickly and in great condition.
434;Good Will Hunting , starring Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Robin Williams, and Minnie Driver, is one of the top ten greatest films of 1997.
435;It was nominated for nine Oscars, including Best Picture, going on to win two: Best Original Screenplay and Best Supporting Actor (Williams).
436;The plot, written by Damon and Affleck, is brilliant.
437;It wonderfully despicts the dramatic side of recovery while adding some interesting wit in the perfect scenes.
438;Director Gus Van Zant leads the cast and crew to accomplish this masterpiece beautifully.
439;The chain of events always contain the perfect emotional background that keeps audiences watching closely.
440;The other plots combined with it offers a deeper understanding behind the main plots, namely the therapist's reflecting his wife's death and Will Hunting falling in love.
441;Such level of drama keeps the intensity intact in the raging scenes.
442;matt Damon and Minnie Driver earned an Oscar nomination for their performances (Best Actor/ Best Supporting Actress).
443;As with Robin Williams, they desplict their character's emotions and turbulances to the fullest, offering audiences a more emotional feel.
444;Williams proves that he's capable of performing dramatic films as well as his signature comedy.
445;All other actors also desplict their presence wonderfully.
446;Good Will Hunting is a great film for most audiences for enjoyment.
447;This is not a great movie, but it has a place in my heart for the characters played by Rodin and Matt, as well as Ben.
448;Good Will Hunting is a great character study.
449;will is a math genius, like Mozart on the piano or Bobby Fischer in chess.
450;This opening scene at the university lets us see this side of Will before we see his other side.
451;He spends his free time drinking with his friends (including real life best friend Ben Affleck, with whom he wrote this script) and getting into fights.
452;He has made many trips to the local courtrooms.
453;Robin Williams as a psychiatrist and Minnie Driver who may become a love interest.
454;this is a great performance by Damon, who gives us a complex character full of flaws and tough as nails.
455;He allows us to watch him soften up as he learns a lot of life's lessons from people who truly care about him.
456;It was included in my prime membership one day and the next nope!
457;watching the film, I still think it is good.
458;Matt Damon does an outstanding job, as do Robin Williams, Stellan Skarsgard, Ben Affleck and Minnie Driver.
459;the film presents the classic troubled protagonist.
460;Finally, his own brethren lay it on the line, and Damon finally realizes his potential.
461;that aside, the film is still quite good.
462;It is deep, meaningful and attempts to make a statement on our society.
463;For that I give it credit, and I say it is an excellent film.
464;but the story is excellent and well told.
465;by far Robin Williams' best work in my opinion.
466;This is a great movie, worthy of 4 or 5 stars.
467;This quiet drama about what genius means was the surprise hit of 1997, with friends Matt Damon and Ben Affleck both collaborating on the screenplay and acting.
468;When Will lands in jail, however, and the professor manages to obtain his release with the stipulation that Will work on mathematics with him and see a counselor, Will's whole life begins to open up.
469;As a patient of psychologist Sean Maguire (Robin Williams), Will forges a relationship that acts as a catalyst for a new future.
470;matt Damon does a wonderful job with the title role, although at times he seems a little wooden.
471;Minnie Driver is charming and believable as Will's new girlfriend Skylar.
472;the screenplay is intelligent and skillfully developed despite some unbelievable facets of the premise, most notably that such a wounded individual, no matter how bright, would have the discipline to teach himself as much as Will knows.
473;The relationship between Will and his therapist is dynamic, poignant, and meaningful.
474;this is a good film to own, as it uncovers additional subtleties on second viewing, as long as you don't mind revisiting emotional angst.
475;Good Will Hunting is one of the best movie I've ever seen and I just can't forget how terrific it is.
476;The story of this movie is extremely well.
477;written and the movie itself is very well.
478;acted by great actors such as Robin William, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck and many more.
479;I can really feel the emotions when I was watching the movie because the actors, especially William and Damon have shown remarkable efforts to make their character more appealing through their outstanding performence in the role each of them played.
480;bUT, he's very gifted in academic.
481;Lambeau wishes to lead Will to the correct path and brighter future of his life and so, he brings Will to meet a few shrinks to give him counselling sessions.
482;Although Will is wild, but Sean be very patient with him because he knows that he will eventually reaches Will's heart of hearts.
483;Because both of them have quite a similar childhood experience, they managed to communicate with each other and get to talk about their own feeling.
484;He then realized what's important for his life.
485;The ending is very nice and complete for such a movie.
486;The other elements in this movie such as sounds, musics, cinematography and a few more are also very wonderful.
487;I bet this magnificent movie could've won a few more Oscars back then if it's not released in the same year as the luminious Oscars winning movie, Titanic.
488;Watch it yourself to realize how magnificent it is!
489;Edgy enough to keep you interested, and dramatic enough to truly move you.
490;He is also a master psychologist, he can figure out people's psychological dispositions just by having one converstion with them.
491;He is also a expert historian.
492;I have just enjoyed this movie for the second time, and found it just as intriguing and enjoyable as the first time I saw it at the theatre.
493;Matt Damon's portrayal as Will Hunting is one of his best performances.
494;The twisting emotions he has to deal with towards the conclusion of the movie make for riveting viewing.
495;Minnie Driver (the girlfriend) and Ben Affleck (the best friend) deliver magnificent back.
496;This movie is thought provoking and sometimes disturbing, but very real.
497;I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
498;Can a movie still be a phenomenal experience with no special effects, no sex.
499;The script of this movie should go down in history as one of the best ever written.
500;Every line is perfect, every plot twist at once surprising and poetically inevitable.
501;Greatest movie of all time.
502;This is one great movie indeed.
503;Well done movie and great story line.
504;Good Will Hunting is driven by its both warm and cold moments.
505;maybe that's why it's so fresh.
506;Also it helps if you love movies with great acting (Williams especially shines), humor, drama, and the ability to prove that young, aspiring screenwriters have something to offer to the film industry.
507;The lead, Matt Damon is superb in a role he co. wrote with Ben Affleck (acting in a smaller part) and brings home a lot of the irony of being extremely gifted.
508;Well you will be pleased to know he only goes over the top once or twice here and the rest is a fine performance.
509;Yes, GOOD WILL HUNTING is a beloved film very much ingrained in our cinematic lexicon.
510;deserved Oscar for best original screenplay).
511;Yet as familiar as I am with this incredible movie, I always look forward to watching it again
512;(He's also one hairy beast, but I digress.)
513;The breakthrough moment is spellbinding, culminating in Will's final decision about what to do with his life that will leave a warm smile on your face.
514;Yes, we're all familiar with the story, yet GOOD WILL HUNTING is so good it deserves to be savored, over and over.
515;i Will Watch Again And Probably A Third Time.
516;Williams And Damon Are Great Together.
517;i think for anyone who ever had dreams but never knew them, this is for them, it was one heck of a good movie, and i recommend it to all of my friends, very few haven't seen it yet.
518;one of the best movies back before Matt was famous and Robin Williams is Stellar as always!
519;I have seen this movie about 50 times and I am still intrigued by its storyline.
520;Damon and Affleck put together one of the greatest story's of all time and both proved well in their respective roles.
521;I would recommend this flick to anyone.
522;Its a great tribute to friendship and falling in love, and all the turmoil in between.
523;I enjoyed this film very much, a powerful see again and again film.
524;my favorite scene is when Robin Williams.
525;And he was!Great acting!Damon and Affleck are great actors in it.
526;Minnie Driver was charming, all good roles in this filmA must see film.
527;i would recommend it to anyone.
528;I am going to school to be a counselor myself,and this was really something to see the patient.
529;It's a great movieA must have for your collection.
530;This is a great movie featuring a young up.
531;Damon is one of those very few good.
532;looking, youthful male actors who has a credible screen presence and can actually act!
533;Here is a brilliant, accomplished pedagogue who teaches at one of the most prestigious academic institutions on the planet.
534;And I mean a classic of ALL movie history.
535;It is especially hilarious poignant as all of us have known people like the Harvard snob.
536;Although the rest of the movie is well.
537;if you want to see a truly profound movie of a genius learning that there is more to life than smarts, then this is the movie for you.
538;and he was writing till the word dx @0340) then he moved it down, as all as quadruple board.
539;Matt Damon gets to play working class nobility and so does Ben Affleck.
540;This is a great movie.
541;A great script, great dialogue, delivered intelligently with care.
542;My favorite movie of the year.
543;The real beauty in this is the introduction of two new script writers with great talent for dialogue and story.
544;i can't help but feel slightly dated when I watch this movie but it I love the filming, writing, and directing.
545;The casting of Robin Williams, Ben Affleck and Matt Damon was positively spot on.
546;written, brilliantly directed and expertly produced.
547;The storyline was fanciful but believable enough to allow the viewer to suspend whatever reality they might be clinging to.
548;the love story of Minnie Driver/Matt Damon complicated by the sessions with Robin Williams was supurbly portrayed.
549;You could almost feel Robin Williams' character truly drawing from real life experiences.
550;the dialog was fresh and I have to tell you that the story really touched me.
551;Good Will Hunting may be the best movie I have ever seen.
552;I have said that for years, and I mean it.
553;It has a great script, brilliant acting (even though Ben Affleck is in it), and great direction.
554;He was a producer on this movie, by the way.
555;But, most movies that make 100 million are special effects flicks that cost almost that much to make.
556;He knows more about math than most people can imagine.
557;Will has to work with him on math he wants will to be his prodigy, in a way.
558;By court order, Will also has to see a pychology professor.
559;He and Will don't really get along at first, but Will likes him.
560;They eventually end up trusting each other and form a very good friendship.
561;The dialogue between the two is amazing.
562;They bounce play of each other perfectly.
563;He evetually meets a nice girl (Minnie Driver), but he pushes her away eventually, as well.
564;i was shocked when I watched this and then thought about the fact that Damon Affleck wrote this movie.
565;And it's clear who is the better actor of the two, as well.
566;Damon shines in his first lead role this is the movie that got him noticed.
567;Robin Williams recieved a much deserved 'Best Supporting Actor' award for this.
568;This is an amazing movie that everyone should take the time to see.
569;the special features are pretty decent.
570;Where do you start with such a wonderfully crafted story with an amazing cast.
571;i loved to watch him.
572;And Minnie Driver as his girlfriend is captivating.
573;it's refreshing to see the very talented Robin Williams in a more serious role.
574;For many years this has been one of my all.
575;I saw it many years ago in a very special moment in my life, so it left a mark on me.
576;ray version comes with many nice features, including subtitles.
577;There are some nice extras, including the audio commentary and deleted scenes.
578;On the good side, the image is crisp and clean.
579;You can see this specially in the aerial shots of the city.
580;I'm thankful I bought this edition.
581;I recommend using this provider.
582;I think this is a great movie.
583;It truly was inspiring, and I'm glad I finally got around to ordering it.
584;Yes, it was a touching story, but at the end of the day, viewers can't fully take the lesson to heart because nobody will ever be faced with his problem of aging backwards.
585;At the end of the day, this is still a great movie with incredible acting and dialogue.
586;all good works of art should prompt discussion.
587;I finally got to see this wonderful touching movies.
588;and of course the acting is excellent and moving.
589;Damon and Affleck really hit the big time with this one, didn't they?
590;This movie was extremely well written and the acting was also superb.
591;Robin Williams finally receives his Oscar and it was well deserved.
592;It had a great balance of character development with a romantic twist.
593;Watching this movie made you smile .
594;screen firendship translated marvelously to their on.
595;Will balances his fear of his own self.
596;worth with the relationships around him.
597;Great stuff that stands the test of time.
598;best line:How do you like them apples!This movie rocks!
599;Gus van Sant does a very nice job keeping this movie moving along briskly, something that might not be especially easy given the subject matter.
600;the chemistry between Williams and Damon *works* .
601;the various power plays and tests seem very real, and felt deeply by both actors.
602;The friendship between Ben Afleck and Damon is easy and familiar, which isn't surprising given that they grew up together.
603;Damon and Minnie Driver don't have quite the right electricity between them, but Driver does an excellent job of portraying the slightly eccentric Skylar.
604;van Sant's direction is outstanding, and resembles his work in My Own Private Idaho in bits, but has a maturity not as well.
605;overall, a very good movie with powerful performances given unflinchingly.
606;it is one of those films that you learn something new every time you see it.
607;cambridge area alot
608;the story is universal and timeless.
609;his acceptance speech was a classic.
610;Robin Williams, who plays his shrink, is beautiful in this role.
611;With the death of his wife and rivalry with the college mate, he has done well to create a much more challenging role.
612;Going hand in hand with Matt in writing this was his best decision.
613;He has a moment, lets admit it, when he puts Matt in his place over the job opportunities he is given.
614;the script is well written and they have produced a nice piece of work.
615;Every bit as good as everyone says it is.
616;This is a very intelligent film about Will Hunting (Matt Damon) a young genius, who because of his disadvantaged and abusive childhood, ends up as a janitor at MIT when he could easily be the head of the Mathematics department.
617;Though the story is a bit far fetched (it is hard to believe a kid this bright wouldn't have been noticed by someone who would have guided him towards higher education), once you put that aside, it is a fascinating character study of a very complex and dynamic young man.
618;The effect this has on him, and his relationship with his friends is powerful and makes for an engrossing tale.
619;Both were considered promising young actors before this film, but this tied a rocket pack to their backs and lit the fuse.
620;Damon was outstanding in the lead.
621;He had a very complex character to play and his emotional range was phenomenal.
622;He was able to switch emotions with ease and was always intense and believable.
623;Robin Williams also gave one of his better performances and received a best supporting Oscar.
624;Most of the challenges that Will faced were inside him, and watching him struggle to overcome the limitations from his past was very uplifting.
625;I rated this film a 9/10.
626;Perhaps if we are lucky, Damon and Affleck will take time from their successful acting careers and collaborate again.
627;I was pulled into the story with the complexity of the characters.
628;I've wished to be very intelligent and never considered that it might be a burden.
629;I like movies that leave a good message at the end.
630;I highly recommend it, you will not be dissapointed
631;by the way this is a great movie!
632;This is a really good movie and my only complaint is it does have A LOT of profanity.
633;Matt Dillon wrote the script and does a good job in the lead.
634;It's a film about a bright kid (Matt Damon) who is fairly well adjusted, has a winning personality, who is a math wizard.
635;It is a great story with some great acting!
636;One of the best movies ever !!
637;Great cast and the acting is superb !
638;This movie was very good and we bought it to replace the VHS tape.
639;A great film, the one that started it all for Ben Afleck and Matt Damon .
640;it gave Robin Williams the Oscar he deserved.
641;Robin Williams and Matt Damon do a terrific job in GWH.
642;Ben Affleck brings a lot of character to the story (one goofy scene could have been left out) He and Damon do a great job of portraying long.
643;I will continue to watch this movie over and over.
644;Definitely one of my 5 favorite movies.
645;A rare, telling video of Oscar.
646;nominated songwriter, Elliot Smith, singing Miss Misery was worth the extra money for the edition.
647;this Oscar winning film deserved more on its disc.
648;This is a good enough film which you can easily tell yourself it is worth the extra cash, but don't expect to be too fulfilled by the extras.
649;That is why it troubles me to see so many good reviews.
650;Zinn admits to its one sidedness and gives his reasons.
651;The development of the relationships in this movie is best described as being 'convenient'.
652;Will is a smart boy, but he's a baaad boy.
653;An exciting 'dangerous' man but can fill her curiousity about Boltzmann's statistical mechanics.
654;I don't see this movie as an accurate portrayal of Boston.
655;Will goes out with a girl for a few dates and now she is in love with him.
656;'Finally, I came to an answer that I could accept.
657;I loved the story and normally I give great films five stars but the devastating bombardment of the f. word so many times (over 150) made it lose a star.
658;The song at the end credits is great also.
659;inspiring movie that the Oscar Academy loves so much.
660;It has most of its elements, indeed, still director Gus Van Sant is able to make it work without falling into some easy traps and melodramatic common.
661;Yet, as he soon discovers, Will is in fact a bright, highly gifted youngster with an uncommon talent to maths.
662;The plot is rich enough to showcase his growing process and further development, even if occasional predictable scenes unfold.
663;van Sant suceeds in delivering an enticing and poignant story about self.
664;the acting also helps a little to make the effort work, since besides Damon it includes convincing performances from Robbin Williams, Minnie Driver and Ben and Casey Affleck.
665;Good Will Hunting is a solid, consistent movie worth watching, yet it is far from being a milestone or a work of genius.
666;It`s basically a good, well.
667;told story with engaging elements.
668;was a really good movie.
669;trip,could somone please explain it to me!They write the script so they get to star in it!
670;This is a great movie, excellent subject matter.
671;I love the part where Damon is talking to the NSA fools.
672;The best drama of the ninties is good will hunting.
673;It won three oscars including best picture.
674;The tale is fluent and brethtaking.
675;Movies like these are a definite classic.
676;The movie is unique and heart warming.
677;Great cast
678;It one of those movies that you can watch over and over again.
679;Ben Affleck and M. Damon getting an Oscar for this movie, has got to be a Classic.
680;The Town, Argo, those are good movies that got started with this.
681;This was one of the best movie's I've seen in a while.
682;The acting is superb and the Actors, WOW!
683;The picture and sound are magnificent.
684;Good Will Hunting is a good classic movie, one you can watch over and over.
685;I really thought this was a good movie would watch it a second time very easily.
686;Hope you enjoy it as much as I did
687;Good Will Hunting is certainly one that deserved all 9 nominations.
688;Well, if you haven't seen the film, it was a combination of superb writing, top notch acting, and a story line that took you on Will's journey.
689;a great engaging story, like this one, gets you engaged, helps develop an attachment to the protagonist, and inserts you as a caring observer of the story.
690;I can say that at moments during the film you can laugh as heartily as Will's friends in the bar, or share your tears of pain from Will's unfortunate past.
691;This is what films should do, encourage an emotional response, and this one surely delivers.
692;There is some crude language(they're in Boston, after all), so be prepared for that(send the young ones to the other room) but you should watch and own this, as you'll watch it time and time again, I know I do.
693;ray with Digital copy is just a great bonus, as well.
694;Good Will Hunting is one of the most moving and intellectual movies I've seen in a while, while still having plenty of comedy and some romance.
695;It definately deserved more awards than it received.
696;This is by far one of the best movies I have ever seen.
697;Definitely one of my all time favorites.
698;One of the most affecting movies in my life I've ever seen.
699;This movie is an example of why movies can be good, why they can change you're life.
700;One of my favorite quote's from the movie is: You're sitting on the winning lottery ticket and your too afraid to cash it in.
701;Do yourself a favor and see this film.
702;This movie is one of the best movies ever.
703;I make all my friends watch it because it's that good.
704;I highly recommend you watch this movie.
705;There have been several great films that focused on the life of one boy genius.
706;First, each one looked at the child genius with sensitivity, doing an excellent job of focusing on the tenuous aspects of childhood, while attempting to fathom and apprehend the child's genius.
707;the need for love, contact, undertanding, friendship, and intimacy.
708;And three, they show that ultimately, what makes a human being special is not how smart, talented, or exceptional he is, but how he conducts his life in relation to his fellow human beings and how compassionate and caring he is.
709;Needless to say, these films are exemplars of their genre.
710;will Hunting is a genius, not on the order of an MIT student, but on the order of Einstein, Mozart, Shakespeare.
711;He is good looking, fast.
712;talking, and seemingly brimming with confidence.
713;Underneath the outward manifestation of his genius, underneath his rebellious nature and irreverence is a scared kid in need of compassion and human connection.
714;the genius aspect of Will is almost ancillary, but is important because it allows another important message to be sent.
715;This message is sent home in many ways throughout the movie, but is most aptly illustrated when Will embarrasses a pompous Harvard boy in a debate.
716;This scene was definitely one of the most gratifying scenes on film.
717;in sum, Goodwill Hunting is a very good film.
718;It is funny, humane, uplifting, and touching.
719;The acting is very strong, the writing is very good, and the character of Will is complex, smart, snide, vulnerable, and highly likable.
720;If you like films that make you feel excited about being human, then watch this film.
721;When you pair two of the worst actors in the history of Hollywood what good can come from it.
722;Very pleased with the whole transaction.
723;Good Will Hunting is a great movie with amazing preformances by great actors showing us that the main character once he learns to trust can overcome past issues and let out his feelings.
724;I personally enjoy the movie from start to finish because of the storyline, the good acting by Damon, and Williams.
725;The supporting cast added to the emtions of the film and characters, but even as smart of the charcter Damon did for the movie, the character realize and learned even in life you don't know everything and there are things worth going after, and he choose to go after the woman he loves but was afraid to say it to her.
726;So for the fans out there if you want a good story, great acting, and tons of great one liners, and good speeches pick this movie up and enjoy an amazing movie that has lots to offer the viewer.
727;robin Williams plays, masterfully, in his Oscar winning performance as the psychiatrist who is more like Will then he would admit.
728;a true gem of a film.
729;This is a wonderful film that very thoughtfully explores the life of a young genius who hides his light due to childhood abuse.
730;Matt Damon and Robin Williams are especially good, but all the other actors come through exactly when needed.
731;Director Gus Van Sant did a fine job directing the excellent actors in this film.
732;Robin Williams was fantastic, and earned an Academy Award as well.
733;He really got into his role, as well as the rest of them.
734;Good Will Hunting is a very memorable film about a troubled young man with recognizable great potential, with strong friendships that inspire him to be better.
735;This was a great role for all characters.
736;Its R rating was well deserved, due to pervasive strong language, some sexual dialogue, and a scene of violence.
737;Good Will Hunting was an amazing and memorable film.
738;It was well worth my time.
739;Good Will Hunting is a great movie delving into the past, present and future states of a person showing how important it is to move from and through your past.
740;The movie did not disappoint and after not seeing it for awhile it was refreshing to see good actors play real people.
741;this is a great movie for the family, someone having trouble moving through life or just dealing with personal issues.
742;It could also serve as a great Men's Bible Study of how, eventually you have to deal with the issues of life.
743;An absolutely great film with wonderful actors and the blu.
744;One of the quintessential films of the 90's.
745;At least the fight, and subsequent winning of the fight, has a point to it.
746;Good to see intellectualism winning.
747;it's good to see a suppressed genius angst, letting out his rage and flourishing as a result.
748;This movie is a true classic.
749;I loved this movie because Ben Affleck and Robin Williams do such a great job!
750;Good Will Hunting is funny, sad and a great movie for men and women!
751;Excellent acting from Robin Williams and Matt Damon.
752;Robin Williams was especially moving.
753;The story is moving and inspiring.
754;How great it is to have a friend (Ben Affleck) who understands your potential and expects you to become the person you were meant to be.
755;The rating of 5 stars is most worthy.
756;Oh wow, this has gought to be Matt Damons best movie I have ever seen.
757;I thoroughly enjoyed this movie from begining to end.
758;I also enjoyed Robin Williams being a shrink in this movie.
759;It has it's funny moments but, I would still classify it in the drama section.
760;But surprisingly this young duo was able to write a sophisticated script that, with the direction of Gus Van Sant, became an Academy Award winner.
761;Those awards, Best Supporting Actor and Best Original Screenplay definitely show the movies strong points.
762;When searching for intellectual success and humanistic relationships between life and career, there is a simple formula which works for a few people.
763;Such is the story of Will Hunting, superbly played by Matt Damon.
764;Consequencly, when he finds either, he attacks one and embraces the other.
765;As a result, he lives in a world of turmoil and volatile possibilities.
766;Robin Williams who portrays Dr. Sean Maguire give one of his most stirring performances as a sensitive and compassionate psychiatrist.
767;The creation of a truly remarkable film.
768;It is a great movie and in my opinion very worthy of 5 starts.
769;intelligent WHITE kid, working as a janitor until his intellect is discovered by a benevolent professor.
770;It's depth surprised me, and I'm really impressed at how well thought.
771;I give it 3.5/5 stars.
772;one can have extremely high IQ and yet EQ makes the person flourish.
773;i like it and would recommend it for all mature audiences (due to explicit language in the film).
774;I laughed, cried and was touched by warmth.
775;It was a great movie and very touching, excitement and much more.
776;This film takes on coming of age and pursuing ones destiny in a very clever and authentic way.
777;I promise, you will enjoy this journey !!!
778;I love this movie and got it today on Blu Ray.
779;GWH is one of my favorite films of all time and having it in Blu Ray is awesome!
780;After seeing many shrinks, Will finally meets with Sean, played by Robin Williams, who eventually guides and befriends the reluctant Will.
781;good Will Hunting is by far one of the most intelligent, well written films I've seen in a long time and it's quite deserving of its Oscar for Best Original Screenplay.
782;Moreover, Robin Williams shines as the psychologist who is struggling to battle his own feelings of loneliness and worthlessness after the passing of his wife, and Damon is incredible as the hard.
783;edged genius at the core of the film.
784;Minnie Driver is also very likable as Will's girlfriend who constantly tries to get him to open up without angering him in the process.
785;Still, overall Good Will Hunting is a thoroughly enjoyable film.
786;I completely enjoyed this movie though vulgar languauge did leasen my comfort range Two excellent actors playing moving rolesGood
787;One of my top 5 favorite movies of all.
788;Matt Damon great, and I forget how great an actor Robin Williams is!
789;A classic movie with great performances, always an enjoyable experience, all of the actors do a great job.
790;Great for a rainy day and you are stuck indoors
791;great writing with a good message.
792;In fact, for what it's worth, the film was not a major blockbuster by anyone's standards.
793;screen chemistry that rivaled Leo's and Kate's, and the screenplay (written by Damon and Affleck in college) was.
794;well, brilliant (it eventually won an oscar).
795;Damon eventually begins seeing Williams, a therapist, and the story goes from there.
796;The tone and theme are very academic and carpe.
797;diem, similar to another Robin Williams film, Dead Poets Society, but with a more gritty edge.
798;the film has achieved somewhat legendary status among college students over the years as THE inspiring story about love, friendship, loyalty, and plunging into the real world.
799;It was the oscar that they received that truly made Hollywood open its eyes to the duo.
800;So I decided to check out Good will Hunting, and it's the best movie I've seen since Chasing Amy.
801;I was amazed at the writing, the directing, and the realism of the characters.
802;Robin Williams and Ben Affleck are great supporting roles, and Minnie Driver is amazing as Damon's squeeze.
803;Anybody who likes movies should see this.
804;Just take my word for it, you'll love it.
805;The extras are informative and interesting.
806;Listening to the commentary track is almost as much fun as watching the normal movie.
807;To top it all off the behind the scenes feature and the music video by Elliott Smith are both EXCELLENT!
808;Highly believeable story of underdog genius Damon being counseled by underdog counselor Williams(who won Oscar for his effort).
809;williams,an intelligent psychologist who's no lover of the intelligentia, refuses to allow his client to be used by the educational elite,prefering to allow Damon to come to make his own decisions over time, especially in his dealings with love, trust, and commitment.
810;Ben Affleck and Damon also won Oscars for Best Original Screenplay.
811;One of the all time classic movies.
812;Great performances from all the cast.
813;Would highly recommend to watch.
814;Robin Williams and cast do a great job in this one!!
815;The characters are always interesting and you are always trying to guess what they will do next.
816;robin Williams is one of the most interesting actors and comedians in the world, and almost anything he is involved in is worth taking a serious look at.
817;Nothing about this movie was less than excellent.
818;Great storyline, acting, the deepness of the relationships between stars, Damon, Affleck, Driver.
819;It was very deep and extremely touching .
820;not to mention, full of BEAUTIFUL actors who are excellent at their trade.
821;this is a good movie if you want to learn about Math.
822;The main character has a brilliant mind which allows him to solve math problems that very few are able to do.
823;It gives the viewer much to think about.
824;I would recommend this to all mature audiences.
825;Matt and Robin were amazing in this movie, definitely my favorite.
826;Movie was in great condition.
827;Definitely one of the best movies out there.
828;It draws audiences to see it and big name talent to be in it.
829;Good Will Hunting was a fresh and impressive writing/acting debut for Hollywood unknowns Damon and Affleck, but it's Williams's Oscar.
830;winning performance, as the mentor who helps Will face his past and future, that really hits home.
831;The acting, writing, directing .
832;In my mind, the psychologist, played by Robin Williams manages to get him thinking for himself.
833;The best seen along time.
834;One of my favorite movies .
835;He gave his best performance ever in this film, a long with Robin Williams, and Minni Driver.
836;with incredible performances by this wonderful cast, a great script, and a well done score.you cannot go wrong with this film.
837;good Will Hunting deserved the Best Picture award, instead of Titanic.
838;The story takes a serious turn when this well.
839;secret of a genius is discovered by one of the top professors in the university.
840;This is a genuine film about release from our personal demons.
841;In the end, Dr. Maguire and Mr. Hunting help each other tear the other's walls of fear.
842;Take it from me folks, there is nothing more refreshing than seeing a film about battle.
843;This is a penetrating and lighthearted film which surprises the viewer with its hilariously touching humor around every corner.
844;With its buffoonery, sensitivity and healing of the mind, Good Will Hunting reinforces the idea that an uncommon story about an everyday hero is the best way to evoke an audience response.
845;This film is not only one of the most effective I have ever seen, but it is one that should let us all know that the things that are most common among the educated and uneducated classes is, we are all people with great capacities and with geniuses hidden in both of our societies.
846;Robin Williams delivers his greatest serious role since Awakenings.
847;It was a pleasure to watch it, uninterrupted, when the tape arrived a couple of days later.
848;Robin Williams did a fantastic job.
849;It's a great story, well acted, and worth having to keep and see again.
850;A brilliant movie about a genius kid growing up and finding his way in life.
851;Robin Williams in one of his best performance.
852;The story is wonderful and the characters are very memorable.
853;Matt Damon and Robin Williams are excellent.
854;I'm very surprised it did not win more awards.
855;Film looks and sounds great when enjoyed via blu.
856;This is the movie that stars of Damon and Affleck, paving the way for them to make better movies like Dogma.
857;This is the movie that finally gave Robin Williams a well.
858;This movie also introduced American audiences to the beautiful and talented Minnie Driver.
859;ok, the plot of a genius janitor at one of the most prestigious universities in America but who doesn't truly have the ambition is most definitely unique.
860;All this movie is is Damon getting mad at people for pushing his intellect, Damon and Affleck fighting everyone they run into, and Damon and Driver fighting before they realize they're in love.
861;I dislike both Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, but I was willing to give it a shot regardless.
862;I remember liking it ok.
863;Now after just rewatching it, I can see many weaknessess.
864;I liked Robin Williams in this role.
865;But people grow, and this was a decent effort.
866;Good Will Hunting is both good and original.
867;The depiction of lower class life and the depiction of the lower class kid's and upper class woman's relationship are good.
868;Ben Affleck and Matt Damon wrote a fantastic screenplay for this film and supported it with immaculate performances.
869;Robin Williams gives a good performance as a sort of father figure to Damon and also his psychiatrist.
870;Affleck gives a terriffic performance as Damon's best friend and fellow hard.
871;This film joins my top five.
872;That is what makes it a five star film.
873;Man, life and the essential details that make it great.
874;This conception of a relationship poured into Williams inspiring acting, couldn't of been less rewarding than by giving him the Oscar for Supporting Actor.
875;although life can beat the hell out of you (even with a wrench) you just have to keep positive with it and prove back that you can make anything of it nonetheless.
876;Good story, good actors, not particularly a Robin Williams fan, but i did like his character in this movie.
877;This movie has been around for a long time, but I've always wanted to own it because it's one I can watch several times a year.
878;Like Little Man Tate , it's about a highly gifted young man who needs access to resources that challenge and inspire him and guidance in making good decisions on how to best use those resources.
879;This film combines harsh reality with a slight essence of fairy tale.
880;It is also one of Robin Williams' best serious roles, as impressive as his performance in Awakenings.
881;As a native of the Boston area, I can assure the viewers that the South Boston accents are genuine, not surprising since Damon and Affleck both grew up in South Boston.
882;But one must wrap up a story somehow, and the ending is satisfying.
883;This is a classic film, nominated for several Academy Awards and winning Best Original Screenplay and Best Supporting Actor (for Williams).
884;I love this film because Will (Matt Damon) really opens his heart to Sean (Robin Williams).
885;Ben Affleck plays Will's best friend Chuckie.
886;She loves Will's inner self more than his looks and she finally helps Will to find ultimate fulfillment.
887;One detail here or there can send us in opposite directions.
888;the first time I saw it I thought I loved it because of Minnie Driver, I've always had a warm crush on her.
889;And her character is so appealing, so likable, lovable, the kind of woman you hope to meet in college and start the second chapter of your life with and you hope it'll be a long, lush chapter two.
890;the second time I watched it was several years later and I watched it just before I moved to San Francisco and I thought, A. ha!
891;well, they work, they are real and good and right and any flaws this film has don't much matter to me, I can take that moment and tuck it away in me for later and it burns as hot and strong as the first time I felt it.
892;With Good Will Hunting, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck (Oscar, best writing, best screenplay) assert that their knowledge and maturity as filmmakers may even supersede their acting skills.
893;The co. written 1997 character study hits the viewer's heart and mind more fervently than the fists of its pugnacious main character.
894;Hunting, who was abused as a child, spends the majority of his time carousing at bars, picking fights, and charming women with his wit and charisma.
895;Affleck balances Damon's role fittingly as his simple minded best friend Chuckie, who also works construction and sees his fair share of courtrooms.
896;taught genius, a mathematical savant capable of using his photographic memory to solve the academic world's most complex problems.
897;good Will Hunting could easily have been your typical intellectual prodigy, overcome odds to rise to the top inspirational story .
898;But the character development provided by the careful writing and exceptional directing by Gus Van Sant, along with an extraordinary cast and occasionally brilliant monologues by Damon and Williams .
899;give the south Boston flick an edge and individuality that helped it earn nine Oscar nominations and two wins.
900;williams (Oscar, best supporting actor) gives a typically impressive performance in a less characteristic fashion.
901;Though McGuire is introduced as a clever and dryly.
902;humorous professor of psychology, his role as a troubled widower and passionate teacher is as intricate a character as he has ever played.
903;The attractiveness of the film comes from the development and dialogue of the characters, and from the personal, human characteristics that they possess.
904;Matt Damen is in love with himself.
905;If you look closely on the picture you can see the French translation.
906;It is a wonderful movie that shows an aspect of things not always discussed.
907;I love it and recommend it everyone!
908;First of all,I have to say This is one of my favorite films.
909;especially,Robin Williams and Matt Damon's act is so miracle.
910;matt damon,he is brilliant working class young man who retains evrything he read.
911;professor is very curious about him and he realize how genius he is.
912;I enjoyed this movie a great deal.
913;I found the complex characters and story line to be most engaging and revealing of issues, we don't often choose to explore.
914;Robin Williams is great in this role, he and Matt Damon make the movie.
915;Saw it many years ago and recently watched it again, same great movie.
916;My dad loves this movie and was glad I got it for him for Christmas!
917;Got it for my teenage boys to watch.
918;Writing is superb, acting very good.
919;A fantastic story about a guy with amazing gifts but who also has deep seeded fears because of the abuse he received growing up.
920;All aspects of Good Will Hunting are brought together in a brilliant cinematic experience that will leave the audience in awe.
921;Excellent actors, great story which could be real life story, showing how hurts of the past impact behaviors of today .
922;but healing can take place!
923;Characters were well developed and the acting by Matt Damon and Robin Williams was award worthy.
924;Excellent movie, a fair amount of extras placed on the blu ray as well.
925;In Good Will Hunting, MIT janitor Will Hunting is a reluctant math genius, discovered by a distinguished professor who is surpassed in intellect and potential by the young math whiz.
926;But Will has a dark, well concealed past and it inhibits his ability to fulfill his potential without professional help.
927;Great chemistry between Williams and Damon.
928;accented character is endearing and believable.
929;This movie is still relevant.
930;Fun to Damon and Aflec as youngins!
931;:) Great on liners .
932;Everything about this movie was great .
933;the storyline, the acting, the way it pulls you in.
934;I would recommend this movie to anyone.
935;with out a doubt, my favorite!
936;One of my all time favorite movies.
937;All I knew was that Robin Williams was in it, so I expected to be entertained.
938;I also got fed up with nearly every second word of the dialogue being the f word and started to wonder just how brilliant this young man really was when he clearly had a vocabulary every bit as narrow as that of his best friend.
939;I've given the movie two stars simply because of the excellent acting.
940;matt damon and robin williams are great together.
941;I happen to love both of these main actors in the movie.
942;Well, this is a very good movie and it seemed to me then and now that a lot of it is because of the script.
943;It is tight, farly seamless and flows nicely.
944;I really got into Robert Ludlum and the wonderful tales he wrote in the 70's and 80's.
945;Parsifal Mosaic has got to be the all.
946;The calculus scene just rocks.
947;I really enjoyed every minute of this movie.
948;Ben and Matt are brilliant!
949;This movie is either perfect, or as close as it's possible for a movie to be.
950;The script is heartfelt and real.
951;The soundtrack, featuring Elliot Smith, is perfectly suited to the movie.
952;All in all, it's one of the greatest movies I've ever seen, and it's my personal favorite.
953;however, that's fine, because it's meant to be more of a character study and it's a great one.
954;yet it holds the viewer's interest because the characters are so captivating.
955;Sean and Will's scenes in particular are terrific.
956;Damon and Minnie Driver are also great together (of course, as it's widely known, the two dated during the filming of the movie) and it's my opinion that both were robbed of their Oscars.
957;ben Affleck shows that spark in this movie which he showed in most of his '90s movies, and he's great in his role .
958;but even better is his brother Casey.
959;Watch the movie with the audio commentary, and you'll gain so much more appreciation for both the role of Morgan and the actor Casey.
960;Cole Hauser is good with the few lines he has.
961;all in all, this is a great movie .
962;written . . . well, I've said it all before.
963;If you're not offended by excessive use of the word f*** (and yes, some people really do talk like that) you should love it.
964;Good Will Hunting is one of the most heartfelt, poignant movies in recent history.
965;it gave us a great evening of true entertainmen
966;It has great actors, drama and some humor as well!
967;Good movie for unwinding after a long weekend.
968;Storyline is Excellent, acting is superb.
969;One of Matt Damon's better performances, and a movie I think everyone should watch at least once in their lives.
970;could not have been a better time to begin a career than this film excellent screen writing and performances by all gets better each time i watch this movie.
971;I was really impressed by this movie.
972;I especially liked the interaction between Damon and Robin Williams.
973;Now I know why Williams won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, why Damon and Ben Affleck won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay, and, of course, the award for Best Picture.
974;For my money, Williams stole the movie!
975;Thought provoking and socially concious as well as a lot of fun.
976;So many people I respect loved this film that I just had to see it.
977;This film is a lot more than the plot.
978;It is the story of a brilliant rough working class young man in from South Boston (Matt Damon) who retains everything he reads.
979;What follows is a original, tight, and deeply moving movie.
980;There is more wisdom in this one movie than I have ever seen on the screen before, and it is totally involving.
981;The story haunted him, however, and with his friend, fellow actor Ben Affleck, they created the screenplay by improvising each scene together.
982;I needed this for a class assignment and it came packaged nicely, and in perfectly new condition just like I was promised.
983;Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, and Minnie Driver shine in this touching story of a misunderstood youth in the working class section of Boston, Massachusettes.
984;Damon stars as the genius Will, a Harvard janitor, who represses childhood memories of abuse, and settles for stagnating in his working class life, when he could put his talents to use and make a life for himself and girlfriend, Driver.
985;Matt and Minnie hooked up during this film before a public break.
986;but they simmer in Good Will Hunting.
987;It's brilliant and if you love Boston and scenes of Harvard, dodn't miss Matt and Minnie in this Academy.
988;We had seen it in the past but was a good movie to see again.
989;The actors are good and it can make you think about life and what can be thrown your way.
990;it's a movie that is worth to watch and you can do it with the family.
991;Fascinating story of a math genius (Matt Damon) who is satisfied with being a janitor by day, and carousing with friends at night.
992;eventually it is one of Will's buddies (Ben Affleck) who motivates Will to give up his carousing, and the psychiatrist's (Robin Williams) early life choices that drive Will to follow his heart and win the girl.
993;One of my favorite movies of all time.
994;This is the type of movie that you can watch a couple of times a year and still enjoy each time.
995;Some of the greatest lines I've heard in a movie.
996;And even though it won best original screenplay, it still doesn't get the credit it deserves.
997;This belongs among the greatest of all time.
998;The kind of movie that is worth watching many times, and from which one can learn life.
999;I really enjoyed the movie.
1000;Powerful performances by two actors (Williams and Damon) as they forge a productive and meaningful relationship that impacts them BOTH.
1001;There are so many things that just went so right about this movie: The great screenplay written by the film's stars Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, the recruitment of Gus van Sant as the film's director, and most of all Robin Williams in a role that one him the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role.
1002;perfect film about believing in yourself and forgiving yourself.
1003;what's so great about this movie is that it ignores a lot of the conventions of American filmmaking at the time and focuses more on its characters, who are more introspective and thoughtful than they initially appear, in particular Affleck's Chucky, who's friendship with the title character is both loyal and unquestionable.
1004;What's also so wonderful about this film is that it isn't afraid to go where most movies don't, often having its characters say and do things that we all think yet don't act on.
1005;It's the smallest details that make this film so much fun to watch.
1006;The picture is focused and crisp, and does a great job of representing the beautiful cinematography of the van Sant's film.
1007;overall, a great package suitable for an incredible and inspiring film.
1008;Eventually, though, with Robin Williams's help, he comes to the realization that he wants to pursue the relationship with the girl, and leaves town to find her.
1009;we don't get to see how this relationship ultimately works out, but the movie ends on a positive note when he and the girl get back together.
1010;i thought Damon and Williams were both excellent in their roles, and that overall it was an interesting concept for a movie that worked out pretty well despite the Matt Damon character basically being an almost completely unsympathetic one.
1011;The most amazing part for me was that the script was produced by two people who were at the time rank amateurs .
1012;and they starred in the movie .
1013;in a good way I mught add.
1014;This is Robin Williams at his best!
1015;Oscar worthy writing by two stars that have stood the test of time.
1016;This is a movie we saw quite a few years ago.
1017;On seeing it again, it was as good as we remembered.
1018;Robin Williams was just outstanding.
1019;Although the language was rough for us old ladies, it was still very enjoyable and we can see why Damon and Afflec won Oscars for their writing.
1020;We will watch it again at some future time.
1021;I have watched this movie several times and enjoyed it very much.
1022;All of the actors are great.
1023;I've seen this movie many times and it's just so great, I wanted to own it.
1024;It's quite remarkable that Matt Damon and Ben Allleck could write such a great script at such a young age.
1025;This is a magnificent movie.
1026;streaming qualify is great for a 1997 movie.
1027;i recommend this to anyone and everyone.
1028;It's beautifully clean and a revelation after all these years of so.
1029;the colour is beautiful .
1030;There's English and German 5.1 DTS.
1031;a really great script by the boys full of life observations from the real Boston (won for best original screenplay), Stellan Skarsgard as the snotty obsessed Maths teacher and Robin Williams as the hurt but earthy shrink (both shining like diamonds .
1032;especially Williams who is a wow and rightly won his Oscar for Best Supporting Actor) and the lovely Minnie Driver with such a lightness of touch.
1033;Younger brother Casey Affleck as one of the boys while Matt and Ben took the world by storm .
1034;so brilliant for such a young age.
1035;the EXTRAS are shockingly substantial: alsoA 4.
1036;scenes FootageTheatrical TrailerIntimate, funny and wise (in a good way) .
1037;Good Will Hunting still stands up.
1038;a great 'US' BLU RAY we can enjoy .
1039;Had a friend once who snickered at my enthusiasm for this movie.
1040;Goodwill Hunting is a classic guy movie about guys who do guy things.
1041;Above all other story elements, this is a movie about boyhood friends and the uncompromising loyalty of those friendships.
1042;will Hunting is a genius and that becomes the crux of the film.
1043;He is a genius, yes.
1044;The story of the young punk with a criminal record outshining the rest of mathematical minds is compelling from the start.
1045;the relationship between Damon and Affleck is powerful.
1046;The latter knows his childhood friend is bound for great things and prods him to achieve in that silent, macho way good friends have.
1047;Because that is how good friends talk to each other when crucial matters are at hand.
1048;Each character that comes into Hunting's world is rich and dynamic, and somehow vital to the decisions the young genius needs to make.
1049;This movie is genius .
1050;Acting, story, script are great.
1051;Robin Williams, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck are great in it.
1052;one of the best of the 20th century.
1053;Of course he was supported by a fine cast .
1054;Robin Williams, Ben Affleck, and the loveable Minnie Driver, whose onscreen chemistry with Damon was sizzling.
1055;Good Will Hunting has the best story that I have ever seen!
1056;It was just a very good movie!
1057;Even though it should of won Best Picture I still love it!
1058;I can watch this movie any time, anywhere.
1059;Its a great great movie that i highly recommend.
1060;The class warfare as played out in this movie is completely thrilling to me, as blue collar Boston finds it's champion in Will Hunting, a super.
1061;Lots of funny scenes involving Will and his brickworking buddies, and some excellent dramatic moments as well.
1062;This movie was good ten years ago and its still good .
1063;i love robin williams in this and to say ben affleck was good well you know that it was a good movie.
1064;You can't borrow mine, so you have to order your own!
1065;After all, two young actor punks won Oscars for their screenplay .
1066;but try to watch it and you'll see how strong it really is.
1067;Affleck and Damon have written an intelligent and engaging movie with some exceptionally moving and real moments.
1068;few actors could deliver his key lines (and key silences) with the understated conviction he brings.
1069;Damon and Affleck, and their buddies, transcend the vanity project tag and really embody their characters.
1070;And so when the movie completes its rather conventional arc, you're happy that everything went pretty much the way you thought it would.
1071;It's an effective, simple, engaging character study with sharp performances.
1072;Ben Affleck (before all of this Bennifer nonsense) is good as his buddy, who really wants him to use his gift .
1073;With an outstanding performance by Robin Williams (who deserved his award) and Minnie Driver, the lads have put together a funny, poignant, movie
1074;A better film than I thought it would be.
1075;Had a pretty decent soundtrack too.
1076;It did well and garnered critical praise but it's still a (relatively) art house film handled well by Van Sant who has constructed good, small, location and lifestyle specific American movies.
1077;it was too well done, well acted by all three of my nemesis and genuinely funny and emotional.
1078;in addition, the features here are definately good for a couple of days watching and paint a vivid picture of how this film came to be.
1079;The very fact that Affleck and Damon were so young when they wrote the screenplay is extraordinary and Robin Williams is awesome in this film.
1080;Good Will Hunting was one of the best films in 1997 thanks to a combination of excellent direction, brilliant writing and superb acting to create an engaging drama for the audience to embrace.
1081;He eventually finds Will, but Will was arrested and jailed for his involvement in a beating while on a night out with his best friend Chuckie Sullivan (Ben Affleck), who is a true manual laborer.
1082;The initial therapy sessions between Will and Sean are very intense (more so for Sean than for Will, as Will uses his genius to tear into Sean's core and has had a lot of previous psychotherapy experience), but Sean finds ways to work with him.
1083;Other well acted supporting characters in the film include Morgan O'Mally (played by Casey Affleck, Ben Affleck's younger brother) and Billy McBride (played by Cole Hauser).
1084;Ben Affleck did a good job with his portrayal of Will's friend Chuckie.
1085;Good Will Hunting earned Matt Damon and Ben Affleck the Oscar for Best Writing for a Screenplay and Robin Williams won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.
1086;Other Oscar nominations received include Best Picture, Best Editing, Best Original Music, Best Song, Matt Damon for Best Actor, Minnie Driver for Best Supporting Actress and Gus Van Sant for Best Director.
1087;Overall, I give Good Will Hunting a rating of 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it to anyone that enjoys a well.
1088;It is extraordinary that Matt Damon and Ben Affleck could write this when they were so young and relatively unknown!
1089;The acting was superb especially with Damon and Williams.
1090;Will Hunting is a super genious who comes along maybe a few times in a century.
1091;He is surprised that it is immediately solved by an unknown student.
1092;this movie reminded me a lot about Salieri and Mozart in Amadeus and John Nash in A Beautiful Mind.
1093;Matt Damon is great as the super genious, in a role better than the one he had in Rounders.
1094;Ben Affleck is great as his best friend whose one wish is that when he goes to pick Will up at his house is that Will will not be home but instead he will have left to make something of his incredible talent.
1095;minnie Driver is excellent as Will's girlfriend, who loves Will but can never seem to get close enough to him because the main flaw in Will that causes him to be a failure in life is that he fears rejection so he avoids any type of situation that could cause this.
1096;A very intense movie of a person trying to find his inner self and being in life.
1097;Great scenery shots, actors, story, coming of age movie to last for decades.
1098;I enjoy it every time I watch it.
1099;The actors and actresses are excellent.
1100;I give it a five plus star rating.
1101;Good Will Hunting is my favourite film of all time.
1102;After seeing this movie while in my final year of high school I was amazed how well it captured adolescencse life.
1103;It captures the struggles that all young men go through.
1104;The commentary by Damon and Affleck is quite intersting to hear.
1105;Everyone involved really played their parts well it was just one of those movies where everything was put into place and it was gold.
1106;Just those words can/will set a soul FREE!
1107;Very interesting therapeutic relationship, but very moving.
1108;Robin Williams portrayed a great character and was very likable.
1109;This is a carefully constructed film which has received extensive critical acclaim.
1110;We join Goodwill as a young man and a member of loyal, courageous and jokey all.
1111;Working as a janitor in a prestigious University , Goodwill is talent spotted by an ambitious mathematics professor and soars to preeminence with the assistance of a therapist played by Robin Williams.
1112;Indeed, the film's artificial social landscape is consistently white and male, the only way in which women are inserted is through the cipher of a confident middle.
1113;upper class English medical student who is impressed by Goodwill`s display of rugged combativity combined with a razor sharp intellect.
1114;A more probable explanation is that this film is yet another manifestation of the great New Right lie, namely that there is nothing fundamentally wrong with society other than a dependency creating nanny state and man.
1115;This ideological offensive is given theoretical underpinning by the rehabilitation of genetic explanations for criminality, deviant behaviour and, of course, genius, which brings us back to the film.
1116;Beethoven and Mozart were brought up in families of professional musicians.
1117;But this therapist is special in the American way
1118;This is a much more ambitious project than would appear at first glance.
1119;But coming from two unknown commodities, it really is a startling achievement.
1120;Affleck, his brother Casey, Cole Hauser, and Damon have wonderful and believable chemistry together as a bunch of South Boston wiseguys.
1121;First, the script takes great pains in its authenticity.
1122;Rather, his Sean is reserved, anguished, and powerful, but always in very subtle ways.
1123;Williams does his best work portraying Sean's grief, calling it up in a matter.
1124;Their relationship ends up strengthening over time, culminating in one final scene of catharsis that if portrayed by lesser actors with a lesser script, would come across as schmaltzy, but here is very real and very moving.
1125;On looking at the movie again, it is astounding to me that this act of courage could be criticized so.
1126;Driver does a wonderful job at portraying her joie de vivre, as well as her self.
1127;And yet she loves him, and repeatedly tells him so, knowing full well that he's not going to say it back.
1128;these four items, combined with its flair for solid and sometimes flashy dialogue (How do you like them apples?)
1129;, make up a wonderful film.
1130;It makes good on all its promises, and manages to be entertaining, emotional, and assuredly worthwhile.
1131;Good Will Hunting is a film that can be watched over and over again and still be found to be enjoyable.
1132;With a fantastic cast including Robin Williams, Minnie Driver, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, together they make this movie such a joy to watch.
1133;if you want a good film to while away a couple of hours, then Good Will Hunting is sure to be worth it.
1134;class genius who has run.
1135;Although this movie is recommended for everyone, people that use mathematics or psychology as part of their regular life will strongly benefit from the content of this movie.
1136;Also, those that live in the Boston area will really enjoy the movie.
1137;somehow convincing millions that this is a great movie.
1138;My cats could roll better film in their litterbox!
1139;Good Will Hunting is a non.
1140;The difference is that in Amadeus you can hear the genius of Mozart, but in Good Will Hunting Matt Damon projects intelligence and there are suggestions, but no demonstrations, of Will's genius.
1141;It is an excellent movie, expecially when cleaned up for TV.
1142;It is probably Robin Williams' best role.
1143;there are comic moments that bring out the absence of demonstration of Will's genius.
1144;One is when he goes to the girl's dorm and she tells him she has to get the proton spectrum of ebolamine.
1145;Good Will Hunting was a good story about a boy genius, named Will hunting.
1146;Will, played by Matt Damon, knows he's smarter than almost anyone, book smart that is.
1147;Although the math aspect of the movie is the binding aspect, it is Will's volatile personality that is the true core of the film.
1148;Robin Williams' character, for which he won an Oscar, is one of many psychiatrists.
1149;Yet his tough love helps us see the deeper side of Will Hunting.
1150;this entire beautiful tale is part of the superb screenplay.
1151;Matt Damon and Ben Affleck wrote it, and because of it they won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay.
1152;This is because the story, along with the richness of the acting, truly enables us to understand Will's character.
1153;The movie is very good, with only the seeming question as when does Robin William's come in, because his part is fairly late in the film.
1154;The story line is great and the acting is phenomenol!
1155;The way they depict the interaction between the characters and there need for understanding and compassion is heart felt.
1156;Also the New England setting was an awesome dynamic.
1157;This story was pretty good, about a genius who hides his talents under a tough guy exterior.
1158;In many ways you can see it from both sides.
1159;admitedly the story may make fans of Van Sant's more original work cringe, but there really is something uplifting here.
1160;Matt Damon is perfectly cast as Will Hunting, proving as he did in The Talented Mr. Ripley, that he's much more than just a pretty face.
1161;Robin Williams is good also, being much better in serious roles such as this than in something like Patch Adams.
1162;Minnie Driver is fine, although it's the obvious chemistry between her and her co. star that really interests.
1163;what's most surprising about the movie though is that aside from it's sweet and sickly message of 'follow your heart' there is more to it.
1164;On top of this, the romance between Damon and Driver is sparky and believable (for obvious reasons), ensuring that you really care when Will's personal demons start impinging on the relationship.
1165;Of course, this is the kind of movie that a lot of people will feel compelled to say that they don't like because on many levels it is a little obvious.
1166;In this way maybe we should view Good Will Hunting as his last standout film.
1167;To anyone who has ever felt down, left out, or that they don't belong, this movie is ideal.
1168;their quest for self, for love and for life.
1169;what a cool choice of music for such a violent scene!
1170;The original version with the song playing straight through is by far the best and it should be corrected.
1171;Excellent picture, sound and superior extras compared to the UK version.
1172;Do you like apples?Well how about these apples that's right Oscar's for best original screen play for Matt Damon and Ben Affleck who stars in the film and Best supporting actor for Robin Williams.
1173;helping each other to find there way and what they have to do in life,which will move you in a way that will leave you felling happy inside.
1174;so get ready for a good one and Enjoy.
1175;I love everything about this movie.
1176;It is written so well.
1177;I would recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it yet.
1178;I think this is the best work for both Matt Damon and Ben Aflack.
1179;This movie Has always been a great movie to watch, just to snuggled up on the couch on a rainy Sunday.
1180;Moving, intelligent, realistic, not overly acted (as could quite easily have been the case).
1181;a story about hope, in a world with little.
1182;I remember seeing this movie in a theater in December of 1997 with a group of friends.
1183;It is one of my favorites.
1184;sound: Great, nothing to report.
1185;wise it only has a music video as an added extra.
1186;movie: The movie itself is a great movie.
1187;Robbin Willias is always great and in this movies he plays the role of a psychologist who deals with Matt damon who is a genious.
1188;All the other Blue Ray disks that I ordered work great.
1189;The most overrated movie in years.
1190;The perfect example as to why you should take Amazon.
1191;com's Essential label with a grain of salt.
1192;This movie crosses all the t's and dots all the i's.
1193;No wonder it got so much acclaim when it came out.
1194;It moves me every time I watch it.
1195;Great opening sequence and music introduces you into Will's world.
1196;Its a lot easier than being his shrink, which Robin Williams artfully played.
1197;The ending leaves you with a good feeling, and there is always an interesting part to the movie .
1198;Good take on what its like to grow up in south Boston .
1199;One of the best movies of all time.
1200;Robin Williams is strikingly serious and Matt Damon is very pure.
1201;If its the reviw of the film, I think is very good exept for the sexual relationship that shows, really it's not need to bring the message forward.
1202;Damon and Affleck deserve all the credit they got for this script, as well as their acting.
1203;That's the fun of this.
1204;They become, well, teamsters and the like.
1205;Stellan Skarsgaard is good as the professor, even though nobody with that eurotrash accent of his would be named Jerry.
1206;The leap to stardom for Damon and Afleck, plus Robin Williams gives a great performance.
1207;I'll watch it again down the road.
1208;I wont explain the whole story here as many others have done so already.
1209;But I will say that I think it's incredible how the two best friends in this movie, and the two best friends in real life wrote the script for this movie!
1210;It's a very good story with great acting, particularly by Robin Williams who needs just as much credit for his acting ability as he has for his comedic sense.
1211;This is one of my favorite movies and I recommend it whole heartedly!
1212;You'll laugh, you'll cry, you might relate to it, and even though you're not a New Yorker, you'll start saying how do you like them apples?
1213;A great movie that shows things can be accomplished no matter what the circumstances are.
1214;A timeless movie with wonderfully played characters especially Robin Williams.
1215;My copy is in excellent condition and arrived sooner than I expected.
1216;Would recommend it wholeheartedly to anyone.
1217;I saw it at the movie theater many years ago and to be honest I love it ever since.
1218;This is just the best movie.
1219;Even my son (in his 20's) loved this movie!
1220;Robin Williams at his best, combined with breakout performances by Damon and the Afflecks.
1221;This is genuine acting by great actors.
1222;If you want to see a real movie see this!
1223;Very good movie that I enjoyed from the beginning to the end.
1224;No longer is the word associated with just academics prowess but also a human touch of hardship, love, despair, passion, friendship and what can be of the future.
1225;The film tells that of a story of very relatable characters (though I'm not a genius) with the right mix of relief and drama with very capable actors.
1226;I highly recommend the film to anyone looking for something with a little more substance than your typical movie.
1227;And I think it's Robin Williams best, non comic films, as well (agreeing with many reviewers).
1228;So the use of profanity by an intelligent punk is nothing sort of reality.
1229;I like better in straight roles than his comedy, He's play in that role!
1230;So versatile sure to stand as one of the great forever And may I thank you for the work and entertainment you've given us all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1231;This production invites the viewer to enter the heart of a genius.
1232;There are some genius's that slip through the cracks.
1233;Also, it is more important to fulfill one's personal goals and aspirations than to fulfill someone else's goals for you.
1234;It's just that a Classic , great movie would recommend it , like you would say it's a keeper You won't soon forget it .
1235;Matt Damon and Ben Afleck shot to stardom after writing and also starring in this moving tale of two working.
1236;class friends in south Boston.
1237;Damon plays a math genius working as a janitor.
1238;The best role, however, in every sense of the word, is Robin Williams' star turn as the psychologist (he won an Oscar for it) who tries to get through Damon's tough.
1239;This is a great free prime movie to watch.
1240;I first saw this movie on T. v. a while ago, and thought that it was a very good movie.
1241;Matt Damon is good as Will Hunting, a mathematical.
1242;genius janitor, but Robin Williams gives the all.
1243;star performance as Sean McGuire, the psychologist who helps him.
1244;While there is a lot of bad language and sexual dialogue, the meat of the plot is absolutely superb, shown by the Academy Award given to Matt Damon and Ben Affleck for writing the screenplay.
1245;This movie hooks the watcher and makes him/her really care about what happens to the characters.
1246;There are funny parts, dramatic parts, and emotional scenes that can push one over the edge.
1247;Overall, one of the best movies I have ever seen.
1248;As you can probably guess, Robin Williams's performance as Matt Daman's therapist is my personal highlight of this great film.
1249;Well, you'd be right about that.
1250;Well, some brilliant Hollywood type told Matt Daman and Ben Affleck to rework the story so that it focuses on the character of Will Hunting and his life in South Boston.
1251;This idea is what made this movie great.
1252;mouthed attitudes, I give it two thumbs up and it makes my Top 10 list at #4.
1253;So, go out and get it and enjoy it over and over again.
1254;I enjoyed this movie ten years ago and decided to add it to my collection.
1255;It is one movie that I will watch again.
1256;The acting talent in this one film is astounding.
1257;Performances by Williams, and Damon are sensational.
1258;One of the best movies of our day.
1259;Matt Damon Ben Affleck have been friends since they were kids and after they both got into the movie business, they decided to write a movie together.
1260;The movie they wrote is one of the most original to come along in a while.
1261;The movie takes place in Boston and focuses on relationships in the life of Will Hunting (Matt Damon).
1262;Will is actually a math genius.
1263;He has a prior record and is facing time, but Lambeau offers him a chance out if he works with him on math theories.
1264;Will reluctantly agrees, but as part of his probation, he must see a psychiatrist.
1265;Will eventually confronts his demons and the movie ends on an interesting note.
1266;All the actors in the film give first rate performances.
1267;Mr. Williams gives the performance of his career and he won the 1997 Best Supporting Actor Oscar.
1268;Director Gus Van Zant does a great job of capturing the atmosphere of South Boston.
1269;Mr. Damon Mr. Affleck took home the Oscar for best original screenplay.
1270;Good Will Hunting is original, funny, heartwarming and a great film.
1271;the acting is superb and the overall feeling by the time the movie is over is just amazing.
1272;I do not love this film, but I like it.
1273;GWH is one of these films.
1274;But the last meeting between Williams and Damon found relevance within me.
1275;You can say they were rubbed the wrong way, and now have to resolve whatever inside them that bristled against this movie, or allow it to fester and continuously cloud objectivity necessary to really enjoy any art.
1276;GWH redeems itself by ending predictably by way of a very interesting screenplay associating memorable interpersonal communications that anyone able to finish the movie should find enlightening.
1277;Williams telling Damon It's not your fault, is appropriate as the key that unlocks the pain that has come to the surface.
1278;Dare to look inside you.
1279;Excellent movie, service and a great story line.
1280;What I like most about this film is its characters.
1281;But the right thing to do doesn't seem to be crystal clear.
1282;moving story of a genius hooligan janitor living in boston who is discovered when he solves an unsolvable math problem posted on a white board at MIT.
1283;gus van sant's direction is subtle and moving.
1284;matt damon is superb
1285;captures boston blue collar spirit accurately and the brilliant soundtrack caps it off.
1286;You won't regret it and since my review is short you can start right away even today!
1287;I really enjoyed watching it again even though I probably saw in theater and have a videotape or laserdisc of the film from that time period.
1288;I really enjoyed watching it on Amazon Prime.
1289;They list Ben affleck as lead in the credits but he was OK and the other two stars I mentioned along with Minnie Driver gave far better performances and surprised that Amazon singled out Ben for mention on the only credit listed!
1290;Great film supposed to be in Boston and on MIT campus.
1291;The acting is superb and it is a wonderful script.
1292;it is funny in some parts and deep in others
1293;Three great actors.,Robin Williams ,Ben Affleck,& Matt Damon play very believable parts.
1294;It is a great film
1295;I'm a grandmother now, so I won't be recommending it to the grandchildren anytime soon, but it is a good film for high school age and older.
1296;Humorous and entertaining but not serious.
1297;I was really surprised to find out the background of the writers, which made me watch their performances even closer.
1298;This was a good a movie as I have seen in a very long time.
1299;Good Will Hunting along with Shawshank Redemption are the best Guy movies ever.
1300;I liked the acting by the two stars.
1301;The story was also entertaining,.
1302;That was true of this film as well as of two others, My Big Fat Greek Wedding and Bend It Like Beckham.
1303;The most dramatic moments in the film occur when baggage from Hunting's or McGuire's past is opened up in the present as decisions must be made about the future.
1304;The exteriors in and around Boston are lovely, an area in which I lived for many years.
1305;There is also a great deal of humor in the script, co. authored by Damon and Ben Affleck who plays Will's closest friend, Chuckie.
1306;(They received an Academy Award for best original screenplay.)
1307;This film offers several feel better benefits but for me, its ultimate appeal is based on Damon's performance as a troubled young man who, with a little help from his friends, can eventually chart a new course for his life.
1308;He received the Academy Award for best actor in a supporting role.
1309;Good performances by robin Williams and Matt Damon .
1310;The story and characters in Good Will Hunting.
1311;kind of A Beautiful Mind meets Breaking Free.
1312;are too much of a cliche to rate five stars, but otherwise this is as good as it gets: a solid performance from everyone involved.
1313;I'm not a big fan of Damon and Affleck, but they're (not surprisingly) completely believable as buddies here
1314;This is probably Matt Damon's best movie.
1315;The interaction between Damon and Robin Williams was extremely compelling.
1316;I highly recommend this movie!
1317;great story, great script, great directing, and great actors.
1318;robin Williams makes you feel that anything is possible.
1319;well I got her number .
1320;It really captured the essence of what it is to be a human being, something that many films that followed its formula did not quite get.
1321;Williams, free from the comic constraints, gives a memorable performance of a learning mentor, who does not have all the answers, but sincerely tries.
1322;there's so much talent assembled in this movie, it leaves one with a feeling that there's still hope for Hollywood.
1323;An interesting premise and some talented actors get lost in the morbid facination with cursing and shallowness of character.
1324;Another good movie with Matt Damon.
1325;After seeing this movie in the theater in 1997 I really liked it.
1326;The director Gus Van Zant and Miramax Home Entertainment absolutely came through together in making a very enjoyable film that still has not lost its luster, even after 7 years.
1327;Robin Williams won Best Supporting Actor, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck won Best Original Screenplay, which was quite an honor for them being as young and underexperienced as they were at the time.
1328;Sean and Will battle it out several times, but Will stays with Sean because he knows he grew up the same way he did and he respects that.
1329;this is by far one of my favorite movies and the best part about this drama is that there was comedy in and out of it that allowed you to be closer with the actors.
1330;This is a story of a very very smart young man (17 years old I think) who works as a janitor at MIT.
1331;He is able to do work that none of the professors can even do.
1332;He has a natural ability to learn.
1333;It is so motivational that it makes you want to study something and learn something.
1334;I would recommend it to anyone.
1335;Robin Williams is amazing as well.
1336;Every actor does a great job in telling their part of the story.
1337;Every character is done very well.
1338;adding in a few comments why I thought the film was valuable.
1339;That includes all Will Huntings hoodlum friends.
1340;It amounts to good exposure, and implied that you can be cool, but still be smart.
1341;All Will's friends knew it.
1342;There are alot of very smart people in this world who end up being janitors for a living.
1343;For me this is such a great movie.
1344;Yes, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck did a wonderful job making it and won an Oscar for it but the whole movie is so memorable.
1345;It's great movie written by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck.
1346;Great story, great actors, great performances, great direction, great screenplay and photography, good ending and Oscars.
1347;Tender, hard core but very good!
1348;It's one of the best movies I own!
1349;I highly recommend it if you are a Matt Damon fan!
1350;It makes you wonder how many people are actually like Will Hunting.
1351;The movie started out good.
1352;very good for the first half.
1353;And I would anticipate very,very,very good for the second half.
1354;So, unfair to rate 1.
1355;Right off the bat, this is my favorite movie of all time.
1356;I think it is written beautifully.
1357;The way they portray Matt Damon's character is great, they make him believe that what he has isnt that special, and the way they make you think that his problems are not that deep is just great.
1358;If you haven't seen it, go see it.
1359;Definitely one of the greatest movies of all time.
1360;I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good movie
1361;Ben Affleck and Matt Damon won Oscars for Best Original Screenplay,and Robin Williams for Best Supporting Actor.
1362;a rare event it must be,when all are truly deserved,especially Williams who shines through in his role as a Psychology Professor.
1363;eventually,Will lands himself behind bars.
1364;excellent performances,script,and Direction,and a truly memorable scene in which the Hard exterior of Will Hunting crumbles down.
1365;This is one of the best films I have ever seen.
1366;Matt Damon does full justice to his 'troubled genius' character, with Robin Williams giving him excellent support.
1367;Ben Afflect is good too, as Damon's friend.
1368;Gus Van Sant's direction is flawless, as he builds up Damon's character.
1369;The movie is touching and meaningful, with the ending being the icing on the cake.
1370;If you want to see a truly inspiring film, this one is for you!
1371;The acting is perfect and there is not a false note in the film.
1372;Robin Williams won a well deserved Oscar, he is the heart of the film.
1373;This movie stays with you and the score is amazing, it's haunting and hopeful at the same time, I loved it.
1374;As close as a film comes to thrilling, moving, complete entertainment.
1375;the taut screenplay keeps you riveted as events unfold.
1376;Despite it's straightforward thematic backbone, Good Will Hunting does an impressive job playing out complex emotional negotiations between lover and friend, eager professional mentor and unwilling father figure, with the bitterness any hardworking career academic like the professor must inevitably feel in the face of a genetic miracle who'd rather chase girls than gunk around with theorems and formulas.
1377;choice psychologist who turns out to be The Most Effective
1378;special mention for the fabulous cameos from Robin Williams in a rare subdued but effective performance sans his usual comedic histrionics, and Minnie Driver, who is simply stunning in her role as Mr. Precocious' love interest.
1379;I love anything with Damon, Williams and Afleck and all 3 are great in this movie.
1380;The screenplay,direction and performances form the essence of any movie.
1381;And surely this essence is present in this movie in form of a beautiful screenplay by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, the precise and very sensitive direction by Gus Van Sant.
1382;And last but not the least to mention the heartfelt performances by Matt Damon and Robin Williams.
1383;Best friend Chuckie(Ben Affleck) and lover Skylar(Minnie Driver) also play a major role in pushing Will to realise something he already knows and which is well deserved by him.
1384;the therapy sessions shown are humorous as well as very touching.
1385;Damon and Afflack are amazing!
1386;If you haven't just do it!
1387;The acting was wonderful and powerful.
1388;Good Will Hunting is basically a story that is wrapped around one big huge anti NSA message.
1389;It's part of Hollywood's enormous campaign to brainwash the American people to agree with their line of thought, which is liberalism.
1390;They play it over and over and over again, like it was one of the greatest movies ever or something.
1391;It works well on the I pad with no car chases or explosions.
1392;ultimately very well done, and definitely NOT A CHICK.
1393;One of my all time favorite movies.
1394;Williams' performance, and the plot of the movie make up for it though.
1395;One of mine and my husbands favorite movies.
1396;What a great movie from the acting to the writing, it's one of those movies I can watch over and over.
1397;Thought the actors captured the characters they played with excellent skills.
1398;the ending was expected, but then I like movies that end with a feeling of hope.
1399;Thought Robin Williams did a great job with his character
1400;That is what helped his client to grow.
1401;He's a genius, but he's had a tough childhood.
1402;Einstein started somewhere, where did Hunting start?Overall, it's a good concept for a film and a great personal story of perseverance through several hardships and society around you.
1403;An excellent work, 4 stars in all respects.
1404;Fascinating, entertaining
1405;This is a great movie.
1406;The performances by Matt Damon, Robin Williams and Ed Burns are amazing.
1407;They did a great job with the music as well: tying it to the story.
1408;This movie is real and very believable.
1409;The acting was attrocious with the exception of Robin Williams, who put forth one of his most believable performances ever.
1410;Well, I got her number how do you like those apples.
1411;Misunderstood, sexy young badboy genius with a heart of gold?
1412;As Gus Van Sant's Good Will Hunting shows, one can dedicate his entire life to mastering an academic discipline . . . only to be one.
1413;Good Will Hunting basically came out of nowhere in 1997 and captured the imagination of the viewing public.
1414;It was a reminder that solid films could still be made without $100 million budgets.
1415;It was also the film that made both Damon and Affleck household names, won Robin Williams his first Oscar, and gave director Gus Van Sant (of Drugstore Cowboy and To Die For fame) his first major commercial success.
1416;It was a straightforward character study fueled by strong individual performances and clever dialogue which emulated films of an earlier era that reveled in its simplicity and not its bombast.
1417;Good Will Hunting will never be mistaken for a Hollywood epic but it still endears as a little cinematic gem from the 1990's.
1418;One of those movies that notches greatness in a number of categories: acting, writing, pace, casting, setting.
1419;i can watch this one over every couple years and still love it.
1420;Naturally it deserves 5 stars .
1421;Another great performance by Robin Williams!
1422;Rewarding to see the changes made in the major characters.
1423;It was exciting to watch the boy finally mentored by the right person who also gained from the relationship.
1424;And, it won the Oscar for screenwriting for Matt Damon and Ben Affleck.
1425;Good Will Hunting is a movie I first watched just a year ago and it immediately moved to the top of my list of movies I enjoy well enough to watch over and over.
1426;The performances by Matt Damon and Robin Williams are touching, and very human.
1427;This is probably one of the only movies that is so good that it gives me chills.
1428;The performances are flawless and there's one scene in particular that sets it apart: Oh, I don't know that?
1429;Every day I come by to pick you up, we have a few drinks, and a few laughs and it's great.
1430;But you know what the best part of my day is?
1431;Because I think maybe I'll get up there and I'll knock on the door and you won't be there.
1432;seen it many times, and heres another time to add to the list.
1433;and i gotta say, altho i love the boys, ben and matt, im also a huge fan of robin williams and i feel he did the best psychologist.
1434;loved everything about this movie.
1435;it was fun, endearing, deep, and triumphant.
1436;meaningful movie and it makes ya think about it for a while after its over.
1437;showed what a great team of writer can come up with.
1438;original story with a great ending.
1439;To be enjoyed by all over 27.
1440;Story about a genius with a lot of emotional issues to overcome.
1441;Matt Damon and Robin Williams are the most believable characters I have ever seen on film.
1442;It's as good as it gets.
1443;will, the genius that he is, knows how to push the buttons of the therapists assigned to him.
1444;chuckie (Ben Affleck) is Will's loyal friend, the only person whom he can share at least a little part of what he feels.
1445;Skylar (Minnie Driver) is the love interest significant to Will's emotional opening up.
1446;Will's relationship with the two characters was resonant and poignant.
1447;Will and Sean's relationship was the heart of the movie, but the soul lies in the relationship of Will to those two characters.
1448;the movie's got an involving and affecting story that is beautifully put into screen by Damon and Affleck's screenplay.
1449;It is beautifully paced and shot and all the characters were able to assert their significance in the movie by allowing them to have character defining scenes.
1450;Robin Williams in an understated performance was effective in capturing the quiet spunk of the character.
1451;Minnie Driver was heartbreaking and transcended the `love interest label.
1452;Stellan Skarsgard also struck some chord as he trains a genius who was intellectually ahead of him.
1453;Ben Affleck also provides an effective support that is both showy and honest.
1454;Last but not the least, Matt Damon in a career making performance, solidified his way into major star status.
1455;He gave the right combination of charm, humor, restrained emoting, and ultimately allowing himself to be vulnerable.
1456;Good Will Hunting to Matt Damon is what The Fabulous Baker Boys is to Michelle Pfeiffer and Saturday Night Fever is to John TravoltaTwo beautiful scenes were instrumental to the ending.
1457;The sentiments of those two scenes were used beautifully in the ending.
1458;The movie wraps up as the end credits rolls with the shot of Will's car in the free way heading somewhere.
1459;The ending was understated, powerful, classy, and memorable.
1460;A perfect ending to one gem of a movie.
1461;Now I know better
1462;anyway, I wasn't sure whether to see this film when it came out, but having come from a broken home myself, I loved the film once I saw it.
1463;Both Damon and Williams carry the plot line well while using their own natural charisma to draw you into their characters.
1464;The camera work in this is also well done.
1465;Jean Escoffier did a marvelous job with all the shots.
1466;it's a simple plot of a young man, orphaned
1467;He's a master wiz with math and is in need of a brilliant intercessor, played by Robin Williams, to help him find his place in the world: Enter in Robin Williams as the psychiatrist.
1468;It's a great film dedicated to character development which I've always been big on, even when I was in my teens and twenties
1469;So if you love good character development and a good delivery of the human condition
1470;both Matt Damon and Robin Williams do a great job with the acting in this.
1471;Great film: Not boring at all.
1472;The power of the vulnerability of a human life is starkly evident!
1473;To open oneself up to another life is a dangerous and spiritual experience.
1474;the most beautiful portrayal of brokeness.
1475;this is my favourite film!
1476;It is one of my favorite dramas of all time.
1477;ray transfer is good as well.
1478;I can see the lines in people's faces.
1479;Director: Gus Van SantCast: Robin Williams, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Minnie Driver, Stellan Skarsgard, Casey Affleck, Cole Hauser, John Mighton, Rachel Majorowski.
1480;running Time: 126 minutesRated R for strong language, including some sex.
1481;the script for Good Will Hunting is the antithesis to the Hollywood system as we know it: two talented young actors (Matt Damon and Ben Affleck), yet to make their big break, come up with a polished, original, and personal script, rather than the screenplay.
1482;Every scene, the characters relate to each other believably, while remaining completely engaging.
1483;Sean's unique approach finally touches the deep inside of Will's complex and it gradually dilutes Will's insecurity and distrust of people.
1484;In the end, Sean and Will helps each other to deal with their own issues.
1485;robin Williams gives the performance of his career here, even topping his great work in Dead Poets Society.
1486;Similarly, Matt Damon did a great job giving us the outwardly cocky genius.
1487;Ben Affleck is amusing and honest as his friend Chuckie, and Stellan Skarsgard and Minnie Driver do great jobs in their respective roles as well.
1488;Director Gus Van Sant, who derailed his career with the unwarranted remake of Psycho, uses all the outstanding members of the cast to create an extremely heartwarming, effective drama.
1489;Take the life of Kurt Godel, the Austrian logician.
1490;One of the best movies I've seen and it arrived quickly.
1491;Robin Williams at his best with the Oscar winning screenplay.
1492;Also note in one of the last scenes.
1493;Got this as a gift for my fiance after he had mentioned randomly that he loved it but didn't own it.
1494;This movie has always moved me.
1495;Excellent writing, terrific acting, and very well done overall.
1496;If you have not seen it, I recommend it!!
1497;Good Will Hunting is, by far, one of the best films that I have ever had the pleasure of watching.
1498;Damon and Affleck are a great duo, not to mention Robin Williams!
1499;I grew up in South Boston, and also fell in love once but would let the the girl into my heart.
1500;Every piece of this film, from the directing to the acting was marvelous.
1501;If you have not seen it yet, SEE IT, you will not forget this film and it's powerful message.
1502;This movie was just a really good film.
1503;i enjoyed it, 2 hours well spent.
1504;Well written and well acted.
1505;Damon and Affleck wrote a remarkable screenplay that greatly deserved the Academy Award.
1506;In fact, it was pretty near great.
1507;Along with his best friend Chuckie (Ben Affleck), Will embarks on a journey that will change his life forever.
1508;damon and Affleck, at the time relatively new to filmmaking, grabbed an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for writing the tale of Good Will Hunting.
1509;Williams also received an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, and the film was nominated for seven other awards including Best Picture.
1510;The cast is terrific here .
1511;even Affleck isn't horrible .
1512;His unique directing style gets moving performances from the entire cast and really brings to life Damon and Affleck's otherwise ordinary script.
1513;remarkable score by Danny Elfman.
1514;If you give it a small chance, it will really have an effect on you.
1515;Good Will Hunting is one of the best films of the year, a shlock flick turned into a touching wonder.
1516;This movie really deserves more credit than it gets.
1517;This movie was very touching and thought provoking.
1518;Maybe today you can be the one to bless someone with the chance to succeed , and to help them to love and be loved.
1519;This movie was great twenty years ago, and it still a movie I would show to my kids and grandkids.
1520;Good Will Hunting was not only a movie that provided you with a well.
1521;Like a good book that always seemed to be better than the movie, in this case, seeing the movie was like reading a book.
1522;so that you can go about your business, and socialize with a peer group that you can truly enjoy .
1523;establish your friendship with these people.
1524;How many times have you gone into great discussions about art, philosophy, mathematics, and even organic chemistry, and have it turn in to a disorganized quarrel over who can sound more intellectual than the others.
1525;stimulated, can a mind truly grow, regardless of tuition, age, or any other social status.
1526;In all walks of life, you could employ great things about you, and choose a positive or negative outcome
1527;(I hope this gives him something to think about on his way to the ski trip.)
1528;Good Will Hunting truly reiterated the fact that two friends sitting at a park bench, one with no education, and another with various degrees and achievement, can have a conversation and enjoy any kind of that with each other, without having to show each others' resumes.
1529;are just as enjoyable and fulfilling.
1530;Everybody has their favorite fruit, whether it be a mango, orange, or apple, and they have their reasons why that's their favorite fruit
1531;A great movie starring the very talented Matt Damon.
1532;Once again he shocks the world with his amazing talent as an actor and gives the movie a great appeal.
1533;I loved this movie and think all with a compassionate heart should deffinitly watch it.
1534;Its about the power an individual can have on another ones life.
1535;Robin Williams once again is the simpathetic good guy that saves the day.
1536;The movie also features Ben Affleck and is brother Kasey affleck.
1537;This movie captures your spirit and startles your soul.
1538;I enjoy ordering items that can and will be a blessing to others I am for sure that every person will enjoy a small gift of appreication.
1539;I truly enjoy all the movies that Robin William and Matt plays in, they both are such a great actors.
1540;I have many of both of there movies and are looking to see new movies they both will be playing in the furture.
1541;if you think that's all it'll take to give you the girl, a car, and a road out west, this is your film!
1542;of course people who judge films by the effect they have on their moods will disagree.
1543;actually contributed a great deal to this script).
1544;A janitor at MIT, Will Hunting has a gift for maths that can take him light.years beyond his blue.
1545;collar roots, but to achieve his dream he must turn his back on the neighborhood and his best friend.
1546;up shrink who starts to coach Will through his transformation, and a med student who shows him that there can be a pretty face along with his life of the mind.
1547;The performances are all first class.
1548;A movie that is beautiful in its own way.
1549;This is an A. production, without any obvious flaws, and is enjoyable.
1550;_Good Will Hunting_ has much to recommend it, not least of which is its redemptive story of renewal and growth.
1551;The notions that psychotherapy actually produces real results and that men have genuine emotions are antithetical to most Hollywood films.
1552;This film not only celebrates these unexplored realities, it manages to do so with style.
1553;This is made possible only by the control the director exercises over his actors, and the film's excellent script.
1554;and we are very much enriched by his performance.
1555;indulgent on the part of its writers, but the selves that are indulging are fascinating.
1556;For me, though, it is the story of exceeding to the full measure of one's potentials, both emotionally and professionally, that makes _Good Will Hunting_ a movie to own.
1557;No, you should definitely go for the Collector's Edition, as the bonus materials are significant and worthwhile.
1558;First among these is the absolutely first rate audio commentary, which is among the most useful ever recorded for any film.
1559;I actually ended up liking the movie more, after reading that Matt Damon and Ben Affleck wrote it.
1560;Obviously this movie is great.
1561;This movie is okay to watch the first time around.
1562;The disc was very clean, smooth looking and without marking.
1563;I've enjoyed the whole movie.
1564;Yes, i will order from this company again in the near future.
1565;I really enjoyed this movie and found it to be a very tender and wonderful film.
1566;Robin Williams and Matt Damon light up the screen.
1567;I really felt this was Williams break out role as a serious actor and he showed a lot of range (though he was also great in The World According to Garp early in his career).
1568;I guess they were a package deal back then (he and Damon)Mini Driver was also very good.
1569;Also Stellan Skarsgard was good as Williams childhood schoolmate who made it good.
1570;I guarantee you will find this a touching and beautiful drama.
1571;The screenplay is an award.
1572;winner and the acting is superb.
1573;The film is beautiful and I recommend it highly.
1574;matt Damon and Ben Affleck make an excellent debut, and now they are major stars thanks to Good Will Hunting.
1575;Minnie Driver is stunning as Will's new girlfriend.
1576;It is hard enough to master any one of these subjects, let alone all, as Hunting seemingly does.
1577;all with a chip on his shoulder who delights in showing up psychologists up for his own amusement.
1578;(For Pete's Sake buddy, what part of: You're going to jail if you don't humor the shrinks!
1579;williams, on the other hand, sucks eggs and is one.
1580;He's become a fixture as the lovable, sensitive and funny guy and it's getting old.
1581;weary academic and therapist is one of the most brilliant portrayals ever committed to film.
1582;Matt Damon is unbelievably effective as a math genius born to poverty in South Boston who is attempting to cope with his gift and maintain a normal life.
1583;Great script and great direction.
1584;You must see Good Will Hunting.
1585;This was a superb movie from every aspect, acting, screenplay, directing, etc.
1586;Even lesser roles, such as that of his friend, are done with great skill.
1587;everything is done with great sympathy and emotional realism, including the location scenes .
1588;its a drama with some laughs and sad parts as well.
1589;I am incredibly glad that it did win for Best Original Screenplay.
1590;A monologue performed by Robin Williams' character is probably the best monologues in a film ever written.
1591;It was so touching and so real.
1592;After watching this movie just once, it has already proved itself to be one of my favorite movies of all time.
1593;You know, movies that sort of have a theme like life is tough but somehow, you'll make it through.
1594;the acting in this movie is also superior, namely Matt Damon.
1595;He even received an Oscar nomination for his leading role, and deservadly so.
1596;It really amazed me how he seemed so perfect (he is a genius after all) but on the inside, he was struggling.
1597;And slowly, as these defense mechanisms start coming into play, he unravels and to have someone reveal their inner being like this so perfectly really establishes them as an amazing actor.
1598;Robin Williams was also in this film and he also did very well, receiving his first Oscar win for Best Supporting Actor.
1599;She had this arguement with Damon towards the end of the film and it allowed her to shine.
1600;She was so raw, so real.
1601;Generally, I enjoy Matt Damon's acting a great deal, but Good Will Hunting in my view is one of the most overrated films of the past 20 years.
1602;Matt Damon and Ben Affleck won an Oscar for Best Screenplay, and Robin Williams won another for Best Supporting Actor, for Good Will Hunting, and if you watch this film, it's really not hard to see why.
1603;Affleck plays his best friend, Chuck, an average working joe who, along with two other friends, accompanies Will in all his (mis)adventures in life.
1604;Their Boston accents are absolutely flawless in this film.
1605;he's a genius, possibly a super.
1606;genius, and we see him able to match wits even with arrogant Harvard students (as in one very amusing scene in a Cambridge bar/Harvard hangout spot) quite easily.
1607;he tears down each of the professor's suggested shrinks until Lambeau matches him up with Sean Kelly (Robin Williams, in the best piece of acting he's ever done), who turns out to be, in many ways, Will's soul.
1608;the story that unfolds, while it may be somewhat cliche, is also one we can all easily recognise, having some element of our lives.
1609;Will's story is that of a misunderstood soul trying to get through life the only way he knows how.
1610;it's a great movie, and if you have a soft spot for Boston, you'll have another reason to enjoy this gem.
1611;Good story that was quite moving at the end.
1612;I would recommend it to a wide audience based on my enjoyment
1613;This movie is classic entertainment at its finest.
1614;In my opinion it's Robin Williams at his best.
1615;He plays a serious role very well which is outside of his usual character.
1616;Classic film, one of Robbin Williams last best films.
1617;Such a great movie to watch.
1618;I'd pair it with A Beautiful Mind
1619;This movie is definitely among my favorites.
1620;Matt Damon and Robin Williams are great!
1621;Love it for the acting and the story line.
1622;Matt and Robin make a great team in front of the camera.
1623;I don't usually talk like that
1624;Good Will Hunting (1997) tells the story of a young genius, Will Hunting (Matt Damon), who comes from a tough neighborhood in South Boston and works as a janitor at MIT.
1625;the theme of a genius janitor is great and I thought I'd like the film more than I did, but a couple of things really bog it down.
1626;I have no problem with realistic cussing in films
1627;tough acting and dialog, Good Will Hunting is worth catching if you like dramas.
1628;For one, Robin Williams is great in an atypical role as a serious psycho.
1629;therapist who is able to handle Will and overcome his (genius) defense mechanisms.
1630;incidentally, Minnie and Matt hooked up after this movie, so the romantic sparks are real.
1631;matt damon and robin Williams are fantastic in this classic and it works as a great tool for teaching healthy masculinity to men who lack examples of wholistic examples of manhood in the face of a socio.
1632;In conclusion, the film's initial set.
1633;with 9 nomination oscar and winning 2 oscar highly recomended for colectors.
1634;to me, the most interesting scenes in this film revolved around Hunting's potential girlfriend (played by Minnie Driver).
1635;Matt Damon and Robin Williams do a great job.
1636;GOOD WILL HUNTING is a brilliant uplifting movie about a guy, Will Hunting(Matt Damon), who is smarter than anyone in the nearby college and could easily get a diploma.
1637;Will must have math sessions with the professer 2.
1638;After 3 or 4 sessions they become close and share thier pasts and thoughts.
1639;written, because in other movies, these scenes get to the point as fast as they, this movie is NOT slow, but it does an amazing job in taking its own sweet time.
