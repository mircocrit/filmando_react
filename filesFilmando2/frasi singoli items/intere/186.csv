id;spiegazione
1;i wanted to love this movie, but except for the incredible soundtrack and Foxx's eerie Ray.
2;Not surprisingly, my kids really enjoyed Ray
3;Even when Charles is cheating on his wife or shooting up, it's all fairly upbeat
4;text in just about every frame, and ultimate redemption is pretty much baked into the script.
5;If you've got kids in the 11 to 15 range, Ray probably provides as good a reason to just say no as they're likely to get from any of those preachy school programs.
6;I was impressed with Jamie Fox's acumen in his portrayal of Ray Charles.
7;I thought at many times throughout the move that I was watching Ray Charles.
8;Throughout the story the movie flashes back to the days when he was a young child and could see.
9;He was the first to own his master recordings and got to write the music that he wanted in every category.
10;He played a great character role.
11;Jamie Foxx did a very good job getting into full character of Ray Charles.
12;Jamie Foxx's performance was magnificent, deftly portraying the humble genius of his character.
13;Anyone who has ever hummed along with Georgia or rocked to I Got a Woman will enjoy this film.
14;Any movie about Ray Charles is guaranteed to have a fantastic soundtrack.
15;He was a pleasure to watch.
16;Next, since we have childhood flashbacks, we must have a credible young actor.
17;No sugar coating of the lows and an excellent job of sharing the highs.
18;It's a fine, fine movie.
19;possibly the funniest moment is this.
20;I hear Foxx is a talented musician himself, and that he showed this to the Grammy audience recently.
21;It was an amazing performance.
22;The performance was that powerful.
23;I agree with everyone who says that the music works in this movie better than in any musician's bio.
24;pic ever, and that includes even the best of them like Buddy Holly, The Doors, Richy Valens, Sweet Dreams, Coal Miner's Daughter, the Countless Elvis attempts, and even the Oscar.
25;if we focus on the drugs, there is a natural beginning, middle and end when Ray is introduced to heroin, becomes a junky, and finally kicks the habit (never mind that the addiction seems to have coincided with the BEST music he ever created
26;In other words, Ray's music, fueled by his addiction and lust, is the perfect background music for . . . the movie RAY.
27;For about two decades I have associated that song, NIGHTTIME, with a classic episode of THE COSBY SHOW.you know the one I'm talking about: Cosby and family lip.
28;it begins with Dave Fathead Newman's famous lazy bump.
29;For years when I heard the song, the Cosby scene played in my head.
30;Seeing it in the movie, with Marge Hendricks singing it to her lover Ray Charles, seeing the look of love and lust in her eyes, seeing her eyes wide open as she sings.
31;well, I'll say it again: Jamie Foxx is maddeningly good as Ray Charles.
32;Not only does Foxx share an uncanny resemblance to Charles, he gets so deep inside the real Ray Charles, that the two breathe as one.
33;It actually told me the story of this legened in an engrossing manner.
34;it was touching without being trite.
35;it is by turns humorous, tragic, and triumphant.
36;most of all, it successfully does what very few biopics are able to do.
37;it conveys a clear essence of who this man was.
38;more than that, all of the supporting characters in the film are believable and 3.
39;superb performances from the ENTIRE cast, and spine.
40;tingling music from the genius himself can't hurt.
41;but what truly raises Ray to the bar of excellence is Foxx's UNBELIEVABLE performance.
42;his acting alone makes this film worth seeing.
43;while Ray Charles lead an absolutely astounding life, full of trials and tribulations, heartbreaks, setbacks, and success, the movie itself wasn't that great.
44;however, I must commend Mr. Foxx and his outstanding performance.
45;He did an excellent job in his Ray Charles mimicry, and really relayed true emotion to the viewer.
46;Jamie Foxx is amazing in this music filled but somewhat two dimensional view of the life of Ray Charles.
47;This film runs a lot like Oliver Stone's 1991 The Doors, starring Val Kilmer.
48;Kilmer's transformation into Jim Morrison was considered to be one 1991's best performances, as well as one of the best musical dramas ever made.
49;Jamie Foxx's performance of Ray Charles is often times more interesting than what Taylor Hackford's conveys through his story, really making the script come to life.
50;But after seeing Ray, I've found a new found respect for him, and his character of Ray Charles.
51;I went into the theater knowing virtually nothing about Ray Charles, minus the old Pepsi commercials, and came out understanding and reflecting on the genius and legend of Ray Charles.
52;The fabulous music, and a performance by Jamie Foxx that captures the essence of the complex character that was Ray Charles, override the flaws that may be found in this film.
53;Ray was a musical genius who also had an astute instinct for business, and for what songs to add to his repertoire, which often broke new ground and went against the advice of the record industry experts.
54;Though the soundtrack uses the original recordings dating as far back as the 1953 Mess Around, Foxx is obviously an accomplished pianist
55;Ray also received an Oscar for Best Sound, and nominations for Best Picture, Director, Editing, and Costume Design.
56;The songs include: Mess Around, I Got a Woman, Night Time is the Right Time, What'd I Say, Georgia on My Mind, Hit the Road, Jack, Unchain My Heart, I Can't Stop Loving You, Born to Lose, and much more.
57;Right from the start you get very involved in this film.
58;That is because Jamie Foxx gives the performance of his life.
59;His mannerisms, voice, and even the way he plays the piano (which he acutally does in the movie) are perfect impersinations.
60;The movie takes you through most of Mr. Charles big life events, and surprisingly, the director does a good job of being honest.
61;The whole fiem does very well in giving the viewer a great idea of what his life was like.
62;Ths movie was both happy and sad, but very moving at all times.
63;The whole cast, especially Jamie Foxx and the young woman who played Ray's mom in the early part of the movie, were great.
64;I recommend it to any fan of good movies.
65;Ray, interested, understands that this girl isn't afraid to speak her mind.
66;Yet, the simplicity of Ray's thinking process does not detract, but in fact makes the film all the more enjoyable.
67;While this makes sense because Ray ends up pursuing a musical career, the film often overuses the devices, as he overcomes a serious heroin addiction by specifically remembering his mother's words, then has a dream in which he regains his vision and meets his brother and mother, who lovingly reinforces that George's death wasn't his fault.
68;similarly, the film allows Ray to create a connection between his addiction to efforts to deal with his own personal darkness and problems.
69;Yet, Jamie Foxx's performance truly shines, and the magnificence of Ray Charles himself leaves any docudrama on his achievements and troubles in my good books.
70;It's said Hollywood is the one place where they truly believe practice makes perfect.
71;pics like Walk The Line and Capote can be traced in part to the immense and deserved popularity of Ray.
72;The version I saw included extended director's cut scenes which could be viewed on demand.
73;Overall the movie is remarkably accurate and fair, and provides great insight into a larger than life genius and musical innovator.
74;ray's portrayal of the early days is particularly interesting, tiny clubs, being paid in ones, the splendid independence and confidence, so much the product of his mother's insistence he be prepared for blindness when it arrived.
75;Ray Charles was a universally loved icon.
76;All Foxx had to do was slip into his suit and immediately he became interesting, sympathetic, and talented .
77;the creative process involves delivering something that wasn't there before you arrived.
78;The triumph of Ray, as good as it is, is that it delivers something that was already there, the personal and musical legacy of Ray Charles, and doesn't injure it too badly in the process.
79;He came from nothing and overcame great adversity to become a Legend.
80;Great to see amazing, this talented man overcome his blindness and win love the world over.
81;It was good to get a more realistic idea of the story behind the music and what it actually took to live such an incredible life.
82;Jamie Foxx did a hell of a job playing Ray Charles and this is a wonderful movie.
83;I have a machine that removes offensive language and scenes from movies and Ray was enjoyable with this in play.
84;A well produced movie about the sad life of a genius musician/singer Ray Charles.
85;Great music throughout as one would expect and interesting drama that sheds light on the hard life of black folks in the last 50 years.
86;If you are a fan of Ray Charles you must see it!
87;This movie is worth it for the sound track alone.
88;Great story, great acting, excellent extras.
89;If you like the music of Ray Charles and true stories this is the movie for you.
90;We watch it many times and always learns one thing.
91;Our grandchildren have developed a keen interest in this musical era and recognize the songs and what stage in Ray's life they represent.
92;Several musicians were educated there and they are delighted to share their knowledge from this movie
93;I definitely felt its best picture nomination was uncalled for, especially since more worthy movies such as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind were ignored.
94;When I was finished and came back to resume viewing, I followed the story perfectly.
95;A good film, in my definition, will grip you until the very end where the emotion hits you like a cement wall.
96;He very much deserved that Oscar he received.
97;The movie centers on the 50's and 60's predominantly, and the period detail and recreation are excellent, as is the supporting cast.
98;Another review has mentioned how you forget that you are watching an actor, such is the strength of Foxx's portrayal, and that in itself is a mammoth task when dealing with any biopic, let alone a musical icon of Charles stature.
99;Well deserving of the Oscar for best actor, Foxx undoubtedly carries the film.
100;The music is great, and the selections chosen for the movie mirror perfectly the era shown before you.
101;I highly recommend this movie, not only to those who enjoy Ray's music, but to anyone with a love of great drama, and an interest in one of the great entertainers this country has produced.
102;From a pretty much unknown comic on In Living Colour, to an Academy Award winning actor who now is in the upper.
103;echelon of the best actors in Hollywood category after his outstanding performance in this flick.
104;I know about this film and how great it was but never got to the theater to see it this past summer.
105;Well not only does he do a brilliant job but everything from his walk,smile and dialog make one believe that Rya Charles is starring as himself!I expected a credible performance,just not a brilliant one.
106;ending with his 1979 recieving of a special acheivment award from the state of Georgia.
107;but for a movie of it's scope,INCREDIBLE directing and acting on the part of all and as the epitaph for the now passed living legend 'Ray' is the ideal portrait for a human being with a unique musical presence within him and how his humanity inhanced and/or got in the way of it.
108;i highly recommend this film to anyone with an interest in great cinema and great music alike!
109;A lot of love circulates around Jamie Foxx's Oscar winning performance here, and yes he did do a wonderful imitation of the real thing, but to me `Ray' has a lot more deserving areas to give consideration and appreciation.
110;For one, the set designs are brilliant, the lighting and mood of just about every scene is fantastic and the musical numbers, while all actual recordings, are choreographed in such a way that you could swear Foxx did all his own singing.
111;It's the little touches like that one that make this movie authentic, accurate and worth while.
112;that said, to me the real star of this film is the man behind the camera, Taylor Hackford.
113;His acute eye for detail is fantastic here, and is a huge step up from his previous work.
114;Technically `Ray' is far from my favorite biopic, even in the year of the biopic it falls short of perfection and or utter brilliance, but when `Ray' hits its mark it hits it with such beautiful depth and clarity that it makes up for its minor shortcomings.
115;another aspect of the film that shines like a diamond among pearls is the impressive female supporting cast, all of which deserved any and all recognition and praise for they all were essential in not only developing the man that was Ray into a full blown character study but they were also pertinent in making `Ray' the film a film entertaining and relatable from beginning to end.
116;Kerry Washington, an actress I've just fallen in love with over the years, gives such a brutally honest performance as Charles wife, the woman who stands by her man and supports him despite his addictions to drugs and loose women.
117;Regina King gives probably the most explosive performance of the bunch as Margie, one of Ray's backup singers and his obsessive secret lover.
118;Her brilliance on screen is matched only by her spunk and heart and it's a true pleasure to watch her chew each and every scene she encounters.
119;Sharon Warren also does a splendid job as Ray's mother and is sure to stand out as a remembered favorite.
120;If the ending had only added as much depth as the beginning and middle had then maybe this would have been a more deserving film to me, but in the end, even with my issue included, `Ray' is still a wonderful biopic, one that I'm happy to have seen and will most definitely see again.
121;star ensemble called USA For Africa(Richie and Jackson were part of the ensemble as well).
122;I dedicate this film to the memory of Charles.
123;I was hugely surprised when I finally had the chance to watch this movie.
124;He is one singer whose music will always be in style and he gave great interviews.
125;So what happened to this movie?The problem with the movie is the same with any characterization of a famous personality who is still so well known to the viewing public.
126;Was Fonda's portrayal of Lincoln perfect?
127;And that is how it usually fares for movies of more recent celebrities.
128;The one exception I know of is Denzell Washington's Malcolm X, who was both lauded for his similarity to his subject and for his acting.
129;But, impersonation does not equal great acting, or a great movie.
130;C. j. Sanders, who played Ray Charles as a youth was much more effective and provocative with his acting.
131;With Sanders, I felt something strong for Ray Charles.
132;Great acting is displayed by Jaime Foxx in the title role of this movie.
133;Jaime Foxx uses all of his gifts in the movie.
134;His talent for music, comedy and acting come together in this movie to bring to life his portrayal of Ray Charles.
135;If you haven't seen this movie do yourself a favor and go see it now.
136;This is a great movie.
137;Some of the things in the movie don't even take place in Ray Charles's real life!
138;I went to see Ray in the theaters last night because my sister suggested it and because I was in a mood to see something critically acclaimed.
139;What I saw made a deep impression in my mind and heart.
140;Eventually of course he rose to become one of the most recognized and beloved musical artists worldwide.
141;the man that this film showed me was an incredible example of determination, charm and simple human spirit.
142;I'll take their word for it that it was an accurate performance, but regardless, it was also a great performance!
143;yet he had a powerful gift and the ability to reach into the collective soul of a nation.
144;Over his long career as a musician and songwriter, Ray Charles Robinson created and performed some of the most memorable music to audiences across the country.
145;Your color, age and creed doesn't matter
146;Here are some powerful points on his acting:1.
147;So the camera goes from the quick jazz playing shot of Charles' hands to his face, on one shot, and you see it's Foxx.
148;Very well written and performed.
149;The music is strong, using Ray Charles' own tracks for both background and performance shots.
150;He eventually beats the drugs, holds onto his marriage, but these failures brought down my respect of him.
151;I found his comedy more off.
152;worthy, and watched the movie with the eyes of a skeptic.
153;jamie Foxx has a new fan.
154;I hope he gets roles that allow him to shine like he does in Ray.
155;He respected Charles and the difficulty of playing an icon, and earned Charles' respect in the process.
156;I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and Jamie's performance.
157;I know Ray blessed the movie and Jamie's performance.
158;I also commend the entire cast.
159;Regina King has certainly come into her own as well.
160;I've always known him with his music that I grew up with.
161;But after seeing the movie and at the end where Ray promised that he'll stay clean.
162;I always loved his smile and I always loved on how he would sometimes laugh at his own one.
163;Thank you for your sacrifice and talents you shared to so many millions here.
164;This movie is worth it and 10 times over that.
165;Making a biography on anyone can sometimes be a tricky thing.
166;But something even trickier is casting the right person in the role to really capture the subject they are documenting.
167;When I first saw the trailer in a sneak peek exlucisve on one of those entertianment shows, I knew right then and there that Jamie would win an Oscar.
168;The film chronicles the life of the legend from 1948 until the mid 60's.
169;The film showcases the amazing and sometimes out of control life of this music pioneer.
170;Ray worked in clubs, and was the piano man in bands, but always wanted to go slowly.
171;The film highlights his highs and lows, and puts together his genius as a performer/singer/musician alongside his problem areas as a philandering husband, and a man with a serious heroin addiction.
172;Foxx is so good in his role it's scary.
173;Ray has a distinct walk and a way he holds himself, and Jamie did it as if it were Ray himself.
174;Becuse that's who you see.
175;And I think that is as big a compliment as you can give.
176;The good news is that the good stuff doesn't end with Foxx.
177;He is surrounded by a strong cast who all put in noteworthy performances.
178;Kerry Washington as his first wife, who he affectionatley called B, is wonderful.
179;As is former 227 star Regina King as Margie, one of the Ray.
180;Clifton Powell is strong and steady as Jeff, Ray's good friend and partner thru many years.
181;Larenz Tate has a small role as a very young Quincy Jones.
182;Director Taylor Hackford directs the proceedings with a firm hand.
183;creates the years and decades with impeccable accuracy.
184;He really gets the right look, clothes, cars, mood, and music.
185;He brings Ray and his surroundings to life.
186;Ray's music was one of a kind, and the music you hear in the picture is the real deal.
187;But it is so painfully brave and truthful to get Ray and his story out there, that you have to stand up and salute Ray for telling it like it is.
188;And for Jamie Foxx, for bringing to life an extraordinary performance of an extraordinary man.
189;This was a good year for bio pic movies, and Ray is one of the best in a long time.
190;May Mr. Charles and his music live on in our minds, hearts, and souls, for eternity.
191;If you want to see good story with good music, you must see this.
192;crispy colors and very hi.
193;jamie Foxx at his best.
194;I truly felt like I was watching Ray Charles rather than an actor playing him!
195;Ray is definitely worth all the hype plus more!
196;Jamie Foxx deserves to win the Oscar!
197;For those who remember In Living Color, he has definitely come a long, long way!
198;Of course all the music is great because, hey, it is Ray Charles after all!
199;:)The bonus material is pretty good.
200;There's deleted scenes, a jam session between Ray Charles and Jamie Foxx, the ever popular commentary with the director, plus other good stuff.
201;I heard that Ray was a great production, but I thought it wasn't my kind of movie.
202;the story of Ray Charles Robinson is a personal account of a man's life as a creative artist, haunted by a childhood incident, and bolstered by the spirit of Ray's mother's efforts to help him stand on his own feet.
203;foxx was brilliant as Ray Charles, and the production was convincing throughout.
204;The story resonated in every scene, showing the ultimate triumph of the human spirit.
205;Ray, which I just caught in a sneak preview, is a grand film.
206;It's vastly entertaining, incredibly well.
207;Beyond that, the film gives a warts.
208;all portrayal of its talented and troubled subject, Ray Charles.
209;though it deals primarily with Charles's attempts to make it in the music business and his struggles with womanizing and drug addiction, the film's most touching moments come from jarring flashes to his troubled, rural childhood.
210;jamie Foxx, who was already brilliant this year in Collateral, gives his greatest performance to date as Charles.
211;He's able to give Charles a sympathetic edge necessary throughout the film, even when Charles does some despicable things to his business partners and the women in his life.
212;Foxx carries the movie, pays proper tribute to an American legend while keeping him human and injects the movie with enthusiasm and a sense of humor.
213;charles filled his life with intelligent, strong women.
214;Kerry Washington and Regina King, playing his wife Della and his mistress Margie Hendrix, give notable performances in the film.
215;though the film has some flaws, it's compelling and watchable.
216;And the touching story has an added impact because of Charles's recent death.
217;thankfully, the movie, done with Charles's approval before his death, is filled with his great music.
218;alotssss better acting and great movies out there beside this trash.
219;Fabulous acting, great story for a spectacular main character.
220;highly recommend this movie to anyone that is a movie or music buff.
221;This is a great movie to go and see.
222;Jamie Foxx did an outstanding job with his performance as the late RAY CHARLES!
223;His portrait of Charles is SO real that you tend to forget that this is an actor and not the man himself.
224;Like a lot of performances detailing the character of real people, the actor puts a lot of time into the physical details and the character begins to look a little one dimensional.
225;if you know nothing about Ray Charles, this film is really informative and quite touching.
226;It's touching given the fact that Ray Charles himself was closely involved in making sure that even the ugly truth was told.
227;It takes a certain courage to lay all that out in the cold light of public judgement.
228;it could have benefited immensely from more creative editing.
229;Balancing that out, though, is the wonderful music of the Master.
230;Ray Charles himself annointed this young talent and now Foxx has joined the ranks of Poitier, Denzel Washington and now Morgan Freeman, as one of the great African American actors of our time!
231;I am so godly proud of him tonite on his special nite of recognition and like Jamie said in his acceptance speech, his Grandmother is certainly looking down on him tonite, smiling a big smile of approval and blessing and indeed, they will have a great conversation and much to talk about in his dreams!
232;CONGRATULATIONS JAMIE~ you deserve this and you definitely earned it and we are all proud of you in Texas!
233;Spectacular acting and a tremendous soundtrack.
234;Jamie Foxx is so good in this role that you don't know where Ray ends and Jamie begins!
235;This is a must see.
236;First I would like to say what a terrific performance by Jamie Foxx.
237;The movie was well done to cover Mr. Ray Charles life.
238;mart, which at the time I thought there was only one version, then I came on here and see that there is a 2 disc version with more extra features.
239;Besides his resemblance to Ray Charles, Foxx embodies the man himself in essence.
240;with Foxx's potent portrayal, the supporting cast had riveting and convincing.
241;King and Washington had brilliant screen chemistry with Foxx, their performances had charm, wit and sheer power.
242;Sharon Warren, a newcomer, played Ray's mother, Aretha and proved what an exceptional acting talent she is.
243;it was undoubtedly going to be hard to squeeze a 40 year music career, a man's troubles, the pain and effect he had on others in 2 hours but this film works because it aims for the drama and the legend of the man, instead of a point by point narrative.
244;The cinema is the perfect platform to show the life and spirit of Ray Charles and through this, it will introduce more people to him .
245;When biopics are good, they are like `Ray': magnificent drama, engrossing characters, beautiful music, subtle but unforced direction that makes you think.
246;As good a performance as I have ever seen on a movie screen, bar none.
247;Taylor Hackford's straightforward and purposeful direction is right on target.
248;Simply put, this is a masterpiece of a film, in an age where film excellence in very much on the wane.
249;Ray Charles was a great musician, no doubt about that.
250;1949 got noticed, found heroin, slept around, did heroin, got married, did heroin, cheated with backup singer, heroin, made it big, heroin, etc.1965 quit heroin, end of movie, oh yeah 1979 Georgia did something.
251;Best movie of the year?
252;Not even top 10, best actor?
253;It wasn't horrible but I expect more out of best movie nominees and more of the great art that made this guy so interesting.
254;Ray is a bit tough to review, but only because I absolutely loved Jamie Foxx's performance.
255;It was worth the price of admission just to see how much he owned this role.
256;but one great actor does not a great movie make.
257;I will give credit to the filming, cinematography, and the other minor characters in the film.
258;He deserves the Best Actor award at the Oscars, and I'll bet dollars to donuts that he gets it, too.
259;The child actor who played Ray in the movies at a young age was magnificent in his performance.
260;Although the movie is long, it is quite entertaining.
261;I see Oscar written all this film.
262;Very Moving story, great music a big plus.
263;Arrived on time and in perfect condition
264;This movie does an excellent job of clarifying Ray Charles' business arrangements and partnerships.
265;The actress who portrayed Ray's mother did an amazing performance and if anybody deserved an award, it should have been her.
266;an alright movie portraying a very glossy depiction of Ray Charles' life, with special attention in setting the record straight with his business deals and associations, and little effort in revealing who Ray Charles the man is and anyone else in his life.
267;Starting with so much to work with (an amazing story and some of the best rock and roll ever created) you'd think it would be hard to go wrong.
268;They hit the mark with this one, though, layering superb acting on top of an excellent script and a can't live without it sound track.
269;Rush out and see this film.
270;I'm always into biography type movies and this one was pretty good.
271;it's actually worth 4 stars but I didn't give it to Ray because of the extra minutes of nothingness
272;the fact that a brilliant actor such as Cheadle could be passed over for this obvious piece of pure hype is enraging.
273;Ray is a beautifully made movie that flows from beginning to end, tying in his past to his life as he lived it.
274;His affairs and wommanizing, despite being married and having children, is right in front of the viewer.
275;The ability to show the beauty of Ray's music alongside his life, both good and bad, is why this movie is so good.
276;i must say as well that the music is key to making this movie so great, which isn't a surprise considering who Ray was.
277;The lyrics match perfectly with the scene and adds character and humor to a story that is already moving.
278;Nominated for six Academy Awards including Best Picture, Ray is a captivating and inspiring true story about a man beloved by millions around the world.
279;Based on the life and times of Ray Charles Robinson, the film follows the popular singer's life from the earliest days of his youth to the day of his triumph over a heroin addiction.
280;great characters blended together with an inspirational personal journey and an unforgettable musical score.
281;Actor Jamie Foxx gives an Oscar Award winning performance so lifelike that it's difficult to distinguish his character from the real Ray Charles.
282;In short, Ray is a film that appeals to a wide audience and one that literally transports its viewers into another era.
283;jamie Foxx plays the role of Ray Charles Robinson, a black youth growing up in Florida during the Great Depression.
284;ray's amazing talents are instantly recognized, and he's never short of a gig.
285;Having already accomplished more than most men, Ray Charles must now face the greatest challenge of his life .
286;jamie Foxx is simply astounding in his portrayal of the larger than life figure Ray Charles, and his effort was more than acknowledged by his Academy Award victory and widespread critical acclaim.
287;The role of the young Ray Robinson's mother, Aretha, is played by Sharon Warren with such passion that her character leaps off the screen and into one's memory as the second most influential character of the film.
288;Through the interaction of each character, the viewer sees a reflection of the passion and driving life forces that moved Ray Charles toward his musical destiny.
289;The astounding heights of success achieved by a blind man (and a black man in a segregated society) leave the impression that any individual can achieve any feat to which he puts his mind.
290;This is the true gift of Ray, a feel.
291;good film with a happy ending about a man who showed the world that anything is possible.
292;He was a simply amazing man with talent unheard of.
293;Ray Charles is an inspiration to me and should be for everyone in the world.
294;Jamie Foxx should win Best Performance with his amazing job of acting as Ray.
295;After watching the special features with the real Ray Charles, i realized how good of a job Foxx did.
296;just inspires me more than i have been ever before.
297;Ray Charles is a legend that lives on forever.
298;this is a once in a lifetime performance that definitely deserves recognition, both for the film and the acting.
299;from start to finish you will find yourself glued to the T. v. in amazement of this man's life, highs and lows.
300;Brought the wide screen version.
301;I have always loved Ray Charles's music.
302;When Ray sang, it came from deep within his heart.
303;Jamie Fox did a superb job of portraying Ray.
304;The laugh, motions, and walk were all perfect.
305;I would recommend this movie to everyone.
306;It was great from begining to end and I couldn't take my eyes off of it.
307;What a great musician and man !
308;This is a stellar performance by Jaime Foxx.
309;grabbing friends, and so on.
310;It is a worthwhile movie with which to spend your time . . .
311;pic Drama/MusicalGenre Grade: A+Final Grade: AThis was an excellent movie.
312;toned than I thought it would be, giving a strong glimpse into adultery and drug addiction and also gives a horrific glimpse into Ray's childhood.
313;The movie is also uplifting with the story of Ray finding his own sound, and just all the music in general.
314;Definitely worth seeing (and worth sitting nearly three hours for), and although the conclusion of the movie feels very rushed and unexpected, it has such a strong body and introduction that make it worth it.
315;Jaime Foxx was amazing in it, and I've got my bets on him for taking home the Oscar next year.
316;There were seriously a couple of moments in the movie where it almost seemed like they inserted some old footage with the real Ray Charles in it because he stepped into the role so well.
317;Great movie, I've watched it several times.
318;This is one of my favorite movies.
319;Happy to have added it to my collection.
320;Jamie Foxx does a good job of inhabiting the character of Ray Charles, but the film is just the stock standard Hollywood story of fame and excess we've seen a million times before.
321;what a clever plot twist.
322;Of course he rises above it, kicks the drugs (with perfunctory tough love from a doctor in the clinic).
323;This is one of my favortie movies.
324;Jamie Foxx was great in this movie from start to end!
325;Jamie Foxx's performance is stellar, sometimes an actor and opportunity just work out perfectly as in this one.
326;She had me crying more than once, and I hope to see more of this actress in the future.
327;all of the performances in this movie are exceptional.
328;do yourself a favor, watch this film with your honey and enjoy!
329;This movie is good because of the script and cinematography.
330;This movie is GREAT because of Jamie and the music.
331;The bottom line is this is a very good movie and would be even without the music.
332;The music makes it a great movie.
333;Jamie Foxx is a very good actor and channels Ray Charles very well.
334;Watch this movie and you won't be disappointed.
335;It understands the music and presents it in an absolutely riveting way
336;I'll say that he creates a spooky combination of magic and electricity.
337;Some complain that he's merely doing an impersonation, and there's a grain of truth to that, but what a tricky and idiosyncratic impersonation it is.
338;Somehow Foxx articulates a crucial by.
339;his performance is matched by, and married to, the music, which is fantastic.
340;That's one of my favorite moments of the past year
341;It was pretty much the talk of the town after the film came out.
342;That Jamie Foxx, the star of Ray, would win the Oscar.
343;And sure enough, he won it.
344;one thing that is quite a watch is seeing Jamie Foxx's portrayal of Ray Charles.
345;Kerry Washington is quite good as the wife but her character is a bit unbelievable: she knows her husband has an addiction and has strayed yet she stays with him and doesn't really have that commanding don't do that anymore that wives like to do with their husbands.
346;Regina King has one of his mistresses and backup singers, well I never did like her in any movies.
347;He deserves that Oscar although he's by no means a flawless actor(he did do Booty Call after all).
348;I had rated this once before .
349;I really like Ray Charles and I love his music.
350;This incredibly talented man led a hard and tragic life.
351;The acting is great and at the end you really have a good feel for this blind man's life.
352;O. k., not great, mediocre as far as a film goes, and the performance is mostly twitching and funny teeth action.
353;I saw this movie several months ago and I must say that I was very impressed by it, for many reasons.
354;All the actors and actresses delivered outstanding performances, but especially the one by Jamie Foxx who went above and beyond the call.
355;I can see what all the fuss is about in regards to his performance because he truly shines as one of the greatest legends in music history.
356;Ray Charles was blessed with his gift for music while Foxx was blessed with both acting and singing, talents which he pours his heart and soul into in this film, much like Ray did throughout his career.
357;the tale weaved in this biography was very moving and seemed rather authentic.
358;the setting, the cinematography, the costumes, the music and the people really helped bring this amazing tale to life, something which can be rather challenging given the long and tumultuous life that Ray Charles led.
359;Even though the movie did not cover his entire career, it portrayed the most significant parts in an enlightening way, effectively pointing out what made Ray what he was, a soulful, incredibly talented genious who had a passion for music, life and women.
360;i'd wager to say that Ray Charles' music can move me like no other musician can because it touches my soul, there's just something unique about his voice that brings out that emotion deep within a person, and that's what made Ray one of the greatest.
361;His music comes to life in this heartwarming tale.
362;i really like this movie because it manages to accomplish that rare feat of capturing a little bit of that magic that Ray was blessed with, and something that special doesn't come along every day.
363;Jamie Foxx was remarkable in his alarmingly accurate portrayal of legendary musical genius Ray Charles, deservedly lip.
364;syncing his way to an Oscar.
365;So powerful was his performance that is overshadowed some excellent acting performances.
366;Kerry Washington and Regina King playing respectively Charles' wife Della Bea and his girlfriend Margie were wonderful in their roles.
367;Clifton Powell playing his personal handler Jeff was excellent in a supporting role.
368;taylor Hackford used a good combination of story telling and flashbacks to give us insight into the tumultuous life that Charles lead.
369;Taken advantage of due to his disability, his talent ultimately propelled him to musical stardom.
370;With the help of his steadfast and loving wife Della Bea, he re.
371;established a solid family life.
372;this powerful flick was a honest look into the celebrated life of a musical phenom complete with warts.
373;Jamie Foxx does a fine job of impersonating the famous blues/soul/country singer Ray Charles.
374;To the film's credit, it shows both the good and the bad regarding Charles' character and the choices he made, both personally and professionally.
375;Not only does it look good, it sounds good.
376;A collection of some of the best actors in Hollywood.
377;I thought this was a great movie.
378;I really enjoyed doing business with amazon.
379;I recommend anyone who is interested in people overcoming personally problems and making a name for themselves.
380;Ray is my favorite film of 2004, and Jamie Foxx's performance as the late R&B
381;the film itself is very well.
382;done, but its Foxx's turn as Charles that elevates it from good to great.
383;His performance puts Jamie Foxx in an elite category of actors who literally transformed themselves into the characters they portray: Daniel Day.
384;There are many great ones (A Beautiful Mind, Cinderella Man and Finding Neverland) and then there are ones that fall short of the mark like 'Ray'.
385;Kerry Washington does a good job as the supporting wife (we've had an outstanding amount of supporting ladies lately) and I feel she too deserved the oscar nod for supporting actress and was yet robbed.
386;What I loved about movies like 'A Beautiful Mind' was that it showed how his problems effected those around him BUT it also showed us how he fought to overcome them, and how he succeded.
387;I give this movie a 3 1/2 stars because Foxx did outstanding.
388;So convincing, I thought it truly was Ray Charles that I was watching.
389;every actor was solid and convincing, and the music was wonderful (with Ray Charles providing the music, you couldn't go wrong).
390;the story was very powerful and endearing, capturing the essence of a true American Icon and legend.
391;Just about everything about in this movie was impressive.
392;And this story on film does a great job of trying to give us a glimpse of the struggles and roadblocks, some of them self.
393;jamie Foxx manages to portray Ray Charles with such a convincing performance that he deserves all the accolades being sent his way.
394;He, in fact, is so convincing that at times I wanted to look away during the scenes when Ray was becoming addicted to drugs.
395;He managed to add just the right amount of music, history, good dialogue, and extras to make this film a complete success.
396;all of the actors and actresses in this movie were very convincing in their roles.
397;Combine that fact with the incredible set designs and atmosphere and you have a film that will still be popular fifty years from now.
398;It really is that good.
399;Hands down The Best Movie of 2004!
400;It's superb and deserves an Oscar.
401;Jamie Foxx's portrayal of one of the world's greatest singers is marvelous (the soundtracks are Charles's originals).
402;In his fifty.year career Charles performed 10,000 concerts, won 12 Grammys, and charted 85 singles.
403;Charles himself was involved in the making of this film, and at the end of the day, despite the feel of an unoriginal soap opera script (music, drugs, philandering, and racism), it is well worth seeing.
404;it's an alright movie, has amazing preformances, and is a good remembrance piece.
405;At 70 years old, he was still just as captivating and electrifying as ever.
406;He was a brilliant musician, and a brilliant performer, and contributed more to the field of music than many people realize.
407;the casting of Jamie Foxx is either the luckiest act in the history of movies, or practically deserves an Oscar of its own.
408;Frankly it's rather eerie at times.
409;the look, the mannerisms, everything.
410;If this is truly the level of his ability, I look forward to more.
411;I loved how he played and sang his own parts, which added to the movie so much more than if he was lipsynching and not really playing the piano.
412;And I've never been a fan of Ray Charles' music but found myself liking it more as the movie went along because of all the emotion that was put into each song.
413;While at times the movie seemed to be repeating itself (girls, drugs, girls, drugs), its pace is excellent and the flashback scenes are extremely powerful.
414;I think Jamie Foxx had some strong emotional scenes that he tackled well, although I think that he didn't deserve to win best actor that year (Don Cheadle in Hotel Rwanda and Jim Caveizel in Passion of the Christ .
415;Great movie, small flaws, and it served its purpose .
416;it brought you an entertaining movie that held nothing back, taught us a lot about Ray Charles, and had great music.
417;Not nearly as good and powerful as Walk The Line (which dealt with similar themes .
418;brother's death, addictions, women that stood by their side, and music that lasted decades), but this movie is definitely worth checking out.
419;deserved, earning seven Oscar nomination including Best Picture and winning two (Best Sound Mixing and Best Actor).
420;This film portrays the life and times of legendary musician Ray Charles.
421;Through a grueling work schedule, heroin addiction, multiple sex partners, racism, and blindness, he overcomes every life obsticle wonderfully.
422;these scenes and events are written beautifully.
423;Between the two simultaneous timelines, the film flows smoothly.
424;It successfully distinguishes his music often played in whole and his personal life without any major distractions.
425;This film gives Ray Charles the recognition he deserves as a musician and a person.
426;Led by director Taylor Hackford, the series of events remain entertaining, yet heartfelt in certain scenes.
427;The emotional stance continually builds, leading to a powerful conclusion.
428;His mannerisms and appearance resemble exactly Charles's, ranging the performances style to the reaction of excitement to the speaking tone to the heroin reaction.
429;Occassionally does a film feature an actor portraying a real.
430;life figure maintain their preciseness.
431;Though the actual Charles sings in the film, he expresses his own musical passion through the film.
432;This truly was the performance of 2004 and of his career.
433;though Foxx's performance is the main showcase, the other actors also portray their roles beautifully.
434;up are accurate to the mid.1900's styles.
435;Great movie, way to long for delivery
436;He sits at the piano, playing and singing with a huge grin on his face.
437;A great contrast would be a competing actor for best picture.
438;Like Foxx, Leonardo DiCaprio also played a public figure, Howard Hughes.
439;This is one of the most convincing acting jobs I have ever seen.
440;Jaimee Foxx truly deserves his best actor Oscar.
441;jamie Foxx plays the part of Ray Charles Robinson, and pulls off an astonishing resemblance to the legend who died in late 2004.
442;His manager seems to be hiding something from Ray about the deal, so he decides to speak to the record label himself, and finds his manager has been lting to him about the deal.
443;In a moment of fury he leaves and travels the country with his new band and manager.
444;ray contyinues to become better and better as an artist, and because of this, his wealth grows and grows.
445;Ray is a hearwarming story, and his fears of blaming himself for his brothers death is put straight when he sees his mother and his brother in a dream, where his brother denies Ray is to blame.
446;This true life story is a dedication to Mr Ray Charles who died in 2004, and Jamie Foxx's representation of him is outstanding.
447;I would certainly urge everyone to watch the film, especially those with a musical interest.
448;I personally loved this film, and, if asked to rate it out of five, I would have to rate it 5 out of 5.
449;i hope you enjoy it.
450;ray is clearly one of the best movies ever made!!
451;it is an awesome feel.
452;good movie with an excellent performance by jamie fox as the lead.
453;ray charles was a genious and jamie fox's portrayment of ray is so outstanding and believable, ray is one of the greatest movies ever!
454;How much of Ray is historically accurate?
455;Jamie Foxx is unbelievable fantastic as the great singer who had to overcome both racial prejudice and blindness.
456;This makes the movie worth it on that level alone.
457;The man was truly a musical genius.
458;We are blessed that he shared his gift with us.
459;Talent and determination will out is the theme of this fun biopic.
460;Jamie Foxx has the look and the moves down as blues/country/soul and you.
461;a good lesson for all of us.
462;This is one of the best Movies that I ahve seen this year.
463;The writing, photography, actors, sound and all the rest again show what Hollywood could do if it wanted to.
464;Ray Charles' music was good once, and it will ALWAYS be good.
465;Ray did so much great music when he was with us, and he is missed.
466;jamie Foxx's portrayal of Ray is uncanny .
467;This is the first time I have seen Jamie in a movie, and he did a spectacular job.
468;if they did, I'll bet they had a lot to talk about.
469;it's a wonderful tribute to one of the best.
470;I just saw this movie again for the umpteenth time and Jamie Foxx's portrayal of Ray Charles is amazing.
471;Great enterntainment all the way around.
472;It's nice to see that his talent didn't stop at the TV.
473;The only thing I knew about him is that he invented a new kind of music, and that he was an inspiration to many music artists everywhere.
474;The movie name says it all, and says it with respect.
475;Ray is great with its effective use of time.
476;Each past scenario covers the inspirations on his life, and also, unfortunately for him, his tragedies, but all are just captivating to watch.
477;From then, he started to rely on his other senses, and he got up, and experimented the sound and touch, listening to the noise of a cricket and feeling the things surrounding him.
478;He noticed mom from the sound of her weeping, crying because he had a special gift.
479;The scene was so touching, I had trouble bottling in my emotions.
480;on the plus side, Ray is a interesting and funny fellow.
481;He has his way of getting attention and getting the respect he deserves.
482;It's funny how he also has his way with the ladies.
483;Improvisation is Ray's special niche, because when he gets into a bad situation or got a problem with someone, he just turns these annoyances into song, and he made a lot of great hits improvising.
484;for some reason, Jamie Foxx is having his best year.
485;He kicked A when he's in Collateral, and here, he's wonderful portraying as the recently.
486;I'm surprised how a comedian like him can do so well when transitioned into drama.
487;He capture the stature and functionally of the icon so tightly, and he's very involved within the character's role.
488;While I can remember their names, the remaining cast were all great too.
489;Like every biography of its type, Ray includes the original songs, and Ray Charles's songs, such as What`d I Say and Hit the Road Jack, really brought in some validity to this film.
490;This is possibly the best film I've seen in 2004, and I hope this movie deserves an Oscar nomination
491;This was a complex and interesting movie about a complex and interesting person.
492;Jaimie Fox does a great job of recreating a strong person who was never going to let his handicap define his life.
493;I thought, how could anyone play Ray Charles and truly sell the role and be believable?
494;When I finally saw the movie, I was very surprised.
495;Not only did I think the movie was very entertaining, but I thought (like many others) that Jamie Foxx did an excellent job as Ray Charles.
496;The music throughout the movie is the best part.
497;The music of Ray Charles is really something special.
498;The movie did a great job of showing the story of how a blind kid from the South rose to become on of the most prominent music figures in American history.
499;Truly a very inspirational story that deserves to be told.
500;Jamie Foxx made Ray Charles come alive in this film.
501;The life of Ray Charles is/was quite an interesting one.
502;jamie Foxx brought Ray Charles alive again from his walk,talk,and to the way he played the piano.
503;Job well done in the role of a lifetime.
504;This is truly a must see!
505;I know that term is used often, but this time it is real!
506;The entire cast gives stellar performances, and I can't say enough about Jamie Foxx!
507;One of the best movies to come out in years.
508;Jamie Fox was extraordinary in this story about one of our great African American performer genuises.
509;The support was great too.
510;This was a very good movie, it told me many things that I never realized about Ray, although disappointing I still love the man for his talents.
511;He was an amazing pianist and had among the most amazing talent that I have ever seen in my entire life.
512;the movie Ray is a brilliant and vivid intake into the first 30 to 40 years of his life from his childhood glaucoma that led to permanent blindness to the turbulent but ultimately triumphant rise to being the most beloved entertainer in the world up into the last days of his life.
513;i've always had a great respect for his music and how he played the piano so well without the use of his eyesight for the latter 66 years of his life (He was completely blind by age 7).
514;this is a highly recommended movie that you must pick up today ASAP.
515;The best parts of this film include Jamie Foxx in a tour.
516;force performance, the music itself (which is elegantly staged), but also the highly underrated direction from Taylor Hackford.
517;While it is true that the film does adhere to conventional storytelling techniques a little too often to make this film a seemless biopic, where the second half of Ray Charles life is basically hashed and fed to the audience in the final ten minutes of the film, what is shown here is often mesmerizing and enthralling.
518;Some of the cuts include a circle of the next scene gradually becoming larger until it fills the whole screen, or the classic peel.
519;One edit he uses is actually very effective, where the camera slowly goes dark before the next scene begins.
520;At those times I felt I was inside Ray's head.
521;The best parts of the film more than make up for the mistakes
522;nomination, the music is rendered beautifully, and Jamie Foxx is simply amazing.
523;I was shocked to hear some of his early songs .
524;That combined with Jamie Foxx's excellent portrayal made me love this movie and Ray Charles.
525;His independence was impressive, and he was a very smart business man.
526;If you're a fan of music, enjoy dramatic movies and like to pull for the underdog, this is the movie to see.
527;Great pacing, great casting and great acting.
528;Jamie Foxx should WIN best actor this year.
529;I just love this man!
530;Jamie Foxx can be added to the rare list of actors who has taken acting to the highest level of acheivement: actually becomming their characters.
531;i love this movie and i seen it two times and i will look at it again and again.
532;i will put this one up there with my other favorite movie Now Voyager with Bette Davis.
533;i wish you all the best and keep remembering what your Grandma says: stand up straight and act like you got some sense!

544;Jammie Foxx is absolutely convincing and possesses the essence of the man, Ray Charles, as much as is possible in a biopic.
545;However, no matter what is happening is his life, Ray's music just keeps getting better and better and more widely heard and appreciated.

563;IT WAS INSPIRATIONAL!The music video that Ray is steeped in alone, makes this film very well worth watching.
564;But there's more, much more to Ray, chiefly due to Jamie Foxx's inspired performance which lifted the entire cast, and thereby the film, to do it all better.
565;Jamie Foxx delivers the goods in this movie.
566;Five stars for the movie and Mr. Foxx!
567;Foxx's performance is outstanding, and his convincing portrayal pulls the viewer into the story and gives them the feeling that they are watching actual footage of Ray Charles as his life story unfolds on the big screen.
568;Touching, heart wrenching, warm and funny.
569;Jamie Foxx walked away with a well deserved Oscar for his performance in Ray.
570;Coming into his own as a talented and admired acter, we will no doubt see more great box office hits from Jamie Foxx.
571;The fact that Taylor Hackford chose not to sugarcoat a considerable portion of this attests to not just his respect for his craft, but also to his incredible respect for this legend that was and is Ray Charles.
572;with women was also magnificently captured, as well as the grief and angst it caused his long suffering but deeply loving.
573;his long standing friendship with the genius Quincy Jones was also well symbolized, as was their mutual evolutions as men and artists.
574;all of this is so important because, given the context of the breadth of his genius and his unimaginable level of courage, one would otherwise forget that Ray Charles was actually human.
575;partialy thanks to a performance by Jamie Foxx that at times leaves the level of brilliant and goes straight to downright eerie.
576;the cinematography for this movie was beautiful.
577;The ensemble cast of actors were incredible.
578;especially Ray's mother, who has this as her first movie role.
579;The screenplay was wonderfully dramatic without being preachy or documentary.
580;jamie is a great actor, and comedian, he diservesthe awards he received from this great film!
581;Ray, Taylor Hackford's new movie based on the life of the great Ray Charles, is a strange blend.
582;I liked some aspects of this film very much.
583;She is a formidable individual who rejects self.
584;CJ Sanders, as young Ray, has an incredibly expressive face that speaks volumes.
585;I also admired the beautiful Kerry Washington as Ray's long.
586;Foxx exhibits all of Charles's physical quirks and captures the nuances of his personality, including his unique musical genius, tremendous ambition, manipulative and predatory behavior towards the women in his life, and his self.
587;The glorious music of Ray Charles permeates the film and I still can't get Hit the Road Jack out of my head.
588;top sequences that seem to spring straight out of a forties movie.
589;moments when Charles suddenly gets an inspiration out of nowhere, and his producers all sit around grinning from ear to ear, agreeing that this is the sound that will make them all rich.
590;still, you should see Ray for the three or four very fine performances and for the superb music.
591;These alone are worth the price of admission.
592;Yet that is all the Oscar community could come up with to award a persons efforts.
593;i really loved Regina King in the movie she is an excellent actress and she plays the role of a girlfriend good in Ray.
594;jamie Foxx most certainly deserved his Oscar for this performance, and he's backed by a strong cast.
595;Of course the music is sensational, and it was usually very hard to tell when Foxx was lip.
596;It's startling to see Foxx perform at the piano in that idiosyncratic spasmodic style that Charles had, as the actor very often becomes indistinguishable from the legend.
597;In the private moments also depicted here, Foxx is amazingly perceptive about the troubled, hard.
598;In fact, director/writer Taylor Hackford and co. writer James L. White have written a literate, often powerful screenplay that makes us understand the complexity behind Charles' genius and the reasons for his inner demons.
599;Ironically, one of the most memorable has nothing to do with Foxx but depicts a moment in Charles' hardscrabble Georgia childhood when little Ray trips over a chair and screams for his mother.
600;top The Devil's Advocate among others), and unfortunately his exaggerated sense of melodrama creeps in now and then, in particular, the last section when he decides to go for a 1960's movie.
601;It's an oddly surreal Hollywood.
602;beyond Foxx, there is a gallery of superlative performances, especially by a trio of fine actresses.
603;Kerry Washington is superb as Charles' wife Della Bea providing strength and tolerance in the face of her husband's drug addiction and constant adultery.
604;Best of all is Sharon Warren, who portrays Charles' proud mother Aretha in flashbacks that make you understand where Charles got his courage and unbridled fury.
605;Also providing excellent support are C. j. Sanders as the young Ray, who witnesses his young brother's accidental drowning and faces his impending blindness, and Clifton Powell as Charles' right.
606;Regardless, the wondrous Foxx elevates this film biopic into something quite extraordinary.
607;The last, Ray Remembered, is a quick tribute to the spirit of Charles by those who loved and admired him.
608;This was a very touching and well performed movie about Ray Charles.
609;Jammie Foxx definitely deserves the oscar for his performance.
610;Foxx was able to become Ray Charles in every way, shape, and form.
611;A movie completely worth of watching should have this one key element .
612;A powerful performance, one where the actor(or actress) truly becomes that character, or in some cases like in Ray, a real person.
613;jamie Foxx took this project on with great gusto, and what an amazing achievement it is!
614;I often forgot i was watching a movie and really thought it was the Real Ray.
615;i want to make the movie loving public highly aware just how much RAY truly deserves viewing time.
616;be prepared for a truly amazing feat .
617;Ray Charles was a very hip, cool pioneer of music.
618;Drugs, sex, and Ray Charles' music .
619;Not sure how to classify it, very jazzy/bluesy feeling, and maybe a smidge of country.
620;Ray is the first of that kind.
621;Jamie Foxx was amazing, spell binding movie.
622;The movie itself was fine, good story.
623;jamie Foxx is absolutely outstanding.Yes,he has all the moves right,and lip.
624;he wasn't perfect as a man,but he was perfect as a singer.
625;if you love RC,then you will love the movie.
626;He is a very gifted young man,and deserves all the adulation he has received because of this movie.
627;Some movies spotlight great actors in weak stories.
628;Others use great cinematography with little substance.
629;Ray does what all deserving Best Picture nominees should: it blends the art of a fantastic director with the raw power of a dynamite actor, then paints the story in subtle hues of emotion and color.
630;i've always appreciated the music of Ray Charles, but this film took me behind the scenes to experience the heartache and courage that fueled his soul.
631;Using every nuance of voice and movement, Jamie Foxx takes us into the mind of this legendary man.
632;The movie never glorifies the drugs or womanizing of Ray Charles
633;I was moved to laughter, tears, and applause.
634;He succeeded and thrived against all odds, making state of the art deals for himself, forging his own way in the business, doing what he wanted to do.
635;the truly remarkable part of this film is not only that it tells a story of such a gifted man who had a sense of self and a sense of what he wanted to do (that led to great success) but that it was possible to make a film that so exactly captured the essence of this man.
636;Jamie Foxx was a revelation
637;nominated for their roles this year, Foxx unequivocally was the hands.
638;down winner with very tough competition.
639;The supporting cast was excellent too but this was really Foxx's show.
640;I loved this movie when it first came out.
641;I'm enjoying it even more now that it is on Blu Ray.
642;Seeing it again confirms the Oscar awarded to Jamie Foxx was well deserved.
643;The movie its great and so many way, specialy how the story is portray and how it develops.
644;I found that this movie was a really emotional movie.
645;i found that the movie was very emotional, and some of the sences were outstanding that it just made me think about things in life.
646;I think this movie would be a great movie for people who love drama, and who is very emotional.
647;I totally have to say that this has to have been the best movie I have seen in a while.
648;I still havent seen a movie that has been better than that.
649;This movie has true passion in it.
650;He actually plays the piano, actually keeps his eyes closed for the whole shoot.
651;this movie shows how one man, a blind man can have such an impact, more than most of us with all the faculties for normal life.
652;Focus and motivation can change your life, no matter who you are.
653;This is a great movie.
654;Jamie Foxx seems like the perfect choice to Charles.
655;First, he has the credibility right now.
656;Yes he's a comedian, but his powerful performance in this year's Collateral opposite Tom Cruise has told me he's also a serious, dramatic actor.
657;i believed if Charles was alive still, he'll be proud of it and smiling in heaven.
658;and the music alone would make this worth seeing.
659;but Taylor Hackford's direction and a splendid script, plus masterful performances by Foxx, more than do justice to the late great Ray Charles.
660;covering an interesting period in music as Ray Charles' career gets going, but soon degenerates into standard (and in some cases, substandard) Hollywood biopic fare.
661;jamie Foxx's performance is a really good imitation of Ray Charles.
662;It has the emotional depth of Tom Hanks' homage to the early 60's That Thing You Do .
663;Ray is an intelligent film that really does a great job at telling the story of the legendary singer/piano man Ray Charles.
664;What I found most interesting about this movie is the things he was doing when he was writing and performing his songs and where the inspiration behind some of his hits came from.
665;Jamie Foxx and every other actor on this film did very well.
666;This film is very touching and at some points very sad.
667;Again, I applaud Foxx in his excellent portrayal he is Ray in this film.
668;You feel his joys and also all of his pain.
669;I can see how this film won an Academy Award.

673;in any case, it's a very good movie and I watched the version that was shown in theaters.
674;Perhaps some day I'll also watch the extended version and the rest of the extra material that comes with the movie.
675;It's a little unusual, but works rather well.
676;It was the time of the birth of Rock and Roll and I just loved it!
677;But it was worth it.
678;ray Charles fit into this early R and R grouping and he became renowned for his wonderful songs such as Baby, What I'd Say and Hit The Road Jack and many others.
679;It was a wonderful period and living it helps a lot.
680;I liked Charles 50s music best.
681;i enjoyed the early part of the movie the most, the part that covered the fifties.
682;in any case, it was an excellent movie.
683;And the music is wonderful.
684;It's one of those kinds of movies, without question.
685;It was funny, but you would never know that he was such a good actor.
686;His portrayal was so brilliant that I hardly blinked.
687;All of the scenery, and costumes reflect the time period, and the acting is superb.
688;I learned a lot of things I didn't know about him, and he really became successful despite being blind, poor, an addict and a womanizer.
689;It is very compelling, and the music is excellent.
690;Jamie Fox is Ray Charles in Ray, a biographical picture covering the early career and early loves of Ray Charles, along with his struggle with heroin.
691;I'm not exactly a huge fan of Ray Charles.
692;Still, I thought this was a rather interesting insight into the man.
693;There are flashes back from Ray's early career to Ray's childhood, glimpses of bits and pieces that don't make sense until Ray comes to terms with them.
694;Jamie Fox played Ray really well, I thought, in his movements, his phrases and his personality.
695;They show some footage of the real Ray Charles toward the end, and I thought they were pretty similar.
696;The way the singing and music was handled was done really well too.
697;The sets are also really good, and really evoke the times.
698;worth a look for fans of Ray Charles, fans of biographical pictures and lovers of music.
699;It truly is a great movie!
700;the performance of Jamie Fox is excellent!
701;He truly showed how good an actor he can be.
702;Overall a must see film!
703;I was able to download this movie within seconds!
704;I downloaded it on my kindle fire H D and the color,graphics, and sound are fantastic!
705;But he knew I had seen Ray Charles in concert and loved him.
706;I have never seen a more pitch perfect performance of a legend.
707;For this film, despite Jamie Foxx's musical abilities, they used Ray Charles' voice and all the original, albeit remastered, recordings.
708;It did real well at the Golden Globes, and it is expected to do equally as well at the Oscars.
709;Some feel that it was a much larger number.
710;jamie Foxx is incredibly good as Ray Charles.
711;He played all the music, and all the close.
712;Foxx spend some time with the actual Ray Charles, but mostly he studied film of the younger version of the man.
713;but it is still an ode to the genius of Ray Charles.
714;but the film has Jamie Foxx, and this elevated it to some level of greatness.
715;Jamie Fox was so good in this movie.
716;I love the music and the acting was phenomenal!!
717;highly entertaining, and approved by Ray Charles before release, I can't help thinking that the subplot about the death of his younger brother is more Hollywood than reality.
718;hyped movies of the year with Oscar predictions all over the ads.
719;style biography and for this reviewer that hampers the story.
720;Still in all Foxx is in fine form lip.
721;which leads to what is the most sensitive aspect of this movie: the women.
722;surviving mother is radiant and gives a performance that is overwhelmingly beautiful.
723;suffering yet enduring wife shows us one of the finer supporting roles of the year to date.
724;And that leaves Regina King as Ray's lover Margie, another of the strong female supporting roles in the film.
725;but by far the 'star' of the film is the music of Ray Charles that is played intact and is simply wonderful on every level.
726;I became caught up in this dramatic tale of the life of Ray Charles.
727;Ray Charles is amazing, and Jamie Foxx put a great deal of effort into portraying him for this biographical film.
728;(He fires a trumpet player for turning up high.)
729;That was good enough for me and all the great music was icing.

734;It's always been segregated and that's the way it's always gonna be!
735;ray is a POWERFUL movie, extremely well plotted and well acted, with an awesome soundtrack.
736;Jamie Foxx earned every bit of his best actor Oscar.
737;And he did a chilling, very convincing portrayal of Ray Charles detoxing from heroin.
738;Foxx's portrayal really helped me understand Ray Charles, the complex and imperfect man behind the genius: a womanizer who loved his wife, a drug addict who had the strength to overcome his addiction, a savvy negotiator with street smarts, and more.
739;the supporting actors were also impressive including Sharon Warren in her debut performance, who played Ray Charles' mother a poor uneducated but very intelligent tough love woman who raised her son to become an educated, independent adult.
740;The child actors who played Ray and his brother George, C. j. Sanders and Terrone Bell did a great job as well.
741;Ray's childhood interweaves into his adult life via flashbacks, showing how both how his strengths and anxieties originated from those experiences.
742;This movie really helped me understand Ray Charles the imperfect man behind the musical genius who was able to overcome the hand that was dealt him: growing up poor, black and blind in the segregated south.
743;iMO, this movie is a must.
744;The music is superb and the recording sessions and live performances come alive with a fly.
745;I love Ray Charles though and I very much enjoyed this movie.
746;The movie Ray is simply one of the best biopics of the past 30 years.

748;The production values are excellent.
749;GREAT performances from the entire cast, especially Mr. Foxx.
750;At Twenty, I look back at my life and I see my life in pictures and more pictures.
751;please note, this film is not for short attention span dilletes.
752;It's one I'd recommend mostly to those who wish to look into another person's life.
753;Jamie Foxx has gained a mountain load of appreciation for this role and deservedly so.
754;cheers and a Ray Charle smile.
755;The Hurricane in my opinion was good, but American Beauty was better.
756;At this rate, every actor who impersonates someone who's made history deserves the Oscar.
757;Jammie Foxx is absolutely convincing and possesses the essence of the man, Ray Charles, as much as is possible in a biopic.
758;However, no matter what is happening is his life, Ray's music just keeps getting better and better and more widely heard and appreciated.
759;If this film is nothing else, it is a moving emotional music video of the great music.
760;Hpwever, the film is much more than that.
761;There was also the personal toll on himself, which was considerable and included some of his self.
762;Yet, he was able to have his music his own way, which of course was the root of his greatness.
763;In the end, he was winner in every way, and his music will live on forever as will the example he set.

773;I can just say that every feature is worthwhile and very concise, but I found myself wishing for more, especially in the area of the life of Ray himself.

775;IT WAS INSPIRATIONAL!The music video that Ray is steeped in alone, makes this film very well worth watching.
776;But there's more, much more to Ray, chiefly due to Jamie Foxx's inspired performance which lifted the entire cast, and thereby the film, to do it all better.
777;Jamie Foxx of course received an Oscar in 2004 for best male actor for his portrayal of Ray Charles.
778;The acting by practically everyone is flawless
779;born in poverty in rural Georgia, banned from the state for years and finally given the recognition there he deserved, Mr. Charles is a beautiful example of what people can overcome.
780;It was heartening to read on the screen, just before the final credits rolled, that Mr. Charles for the next forty years after the period of his life that this movie covers, had his act together and continued to record one beautiful song after another for a grateful public.
781;Ray is a great movie and Jamie Foxx's performance is spectacular.
782;Ray was a very good movie but I felt that it was overrated.
783;I preferred Hotel Rwanda a lot more and I felt that Don Cheadle should have won the best actor oscar.
784;Jamie Foxx did a very good job but I found Don Cheadle to have done better.
785;but, Ray is a good movie that everyone should see.
786;It portrays Ray Charles's life and showed his many dark secrets.
787;The movie is hard to watch at times and Jamie Foxx's performance is amazing.
788;It shows all of the downfalls of Ray Charles and his whole life.
789;The movie is also very informative as it informs you on everything in his life.
790;It's kind of like a documentary in a movie form.
791;Nevertheless, both are excellent movies, and the performances by Jamie Foxx and Don Cheadle are both remarquable.
792;Taylor Hackford is one of the most gifted and prominent directors of the American Cinema.
793;He has given us previously authentic film jewels as Dolores Clairburne, Proof of life and The devils's advocate.
794;Tastefully filmed the secure and masterful direction leads us through three decades.
795;The artistic direction and the set up are impeccable.
796;The film is told in documental stylish and thanks to the multiple flashback, the viewer ellaborates his own readings.
797;the supporting cast is simply superb.
798;Hackford knows to use it as the good conductor with the rubato figure.
799;In the other hand the script reflects to Ray multidimensionally , this a very remarkable aspect: Ray : the man and his whole circunstamce: many directors could havegiven us a tearful reading and a soap melodram but you fortunately are before a mature film crudely described.
800;jamie Fox,to my mind, makes an impressive acting and I suspect he will be the real winner the next Sunday in the Academy Award.
801;The movie is a treasure and consider from now an absolute classic film!
802;I didn't know what to expect when I first started watching this movie, but I came away with my spirit full.
803;Ray is outstandingly performed by Foxx, who commands attention and plays to role superbly throughout.
804;The directors have done a superb job on this film by grimly portraying Charles' administrative ruthlessness, his selfishness and his egotism.
805;What we get instead is realism, human triumph and disaster and genuine highs and lows.
806;the supporting cast are excellent although Ray's relationship with Fathead is left underdeveloped.
807;man very attractive to the opposite sex.
808;This is profound stuff, and by the standard of the usual eulogies to which this biopic will be compared, it is outstanding.
809;This film sets a new standard which will leave future producers of biopics of the great, the interesting and the glorious much to ponder.
810;this film, though, brings so much more to the viewer than what the media has presented.
811;Foxx played an incredible role, that of Ray Charles Robinson.
812;, and his breathtaking ability to move both white and black audiences was mesmorizing.
813;kudos to everyone who played a part in its production.
814;Featuring an Academy Award winning performance by Jamie Foxx, Ray details the life of Ray Charles from childhood to adulthood.
815;It tracks his success and his journey to becoming one of the greatest musical performers of all time.
816;It's amazing to see what someone who is blind can achieve.
817;My wife picked this movie, and I willingly watched it because I was in the mood for a musical biography.
818;I found this story to be very moving, perfectly and powerfully portraying many dimensions of the human condition.
819;It was uplifting to see how he was able to achieve so much success despite having to overcome so much adversity.
820;I don't need to watch this movie again, but it was well worth watching once.
821;Jamie Fox carries this movie.
822;I understand kicking this habit, and the whole metaphor of the heroin turning him into a cripple is important.
823;You WILL enjoy this movie.
824;The father of soul (or at least one of them) has lived life to the fullest, turning a disability into an asset and going to the extremes to nourish his talent.
825;ray has a great human story, addictive music, superb performances and exquisite production.
826;Yet the thing that makes this film so unique and special is the theme going on between Ray and his mother.
827;truly is a story to cherish in every aspect.
828;I do love Ray Charles.
829;I love him afore I knowed he was the blind and I love him now that I do honestly know he is the blind.
830;So magine if you will, if you can rather, what kind of shock I have in my own private idaho.
831;I pass on it, I truly do.
832;One of the best acting performances in a long time.
833;Ray Charles is a myth and here he becomes a friend, a familiar, a human being.
834;That's the first and best aspect of the film we have to emphasize.
835;The phenomenal mixing and blending of R&B
836;It shows how he got involved in many deep and fundamental social, cultural, musical and racial movements to change the world when necessary.
837;It shows how he was able to separate his family life from his professional life, and his wife was able to follow him along this line, so that these two lives never mixed, at least not entirely.
838;But he had an admirable wife.
839;It also shows the great changes that occurred in the USA over the last sixty years, the tremendous reduction of racism and segregation, even the important first steps on the road towards repentance and reparations.
840;Finally this film shows the absolute blend of the whole life of a man, and every single moment will remain alive for him forever, and his creativity, here Ray's music.
841;When a man creates something he has to invest every single fiber of his muscles and every single cell of his brain into it to make it his truest ever child.
842;That is what Ray was able to do and he did it over and over again in his long professional life.
843;That is the sign of a great man and a great mind.
844;Jamie Foxx gives a five star, award.
845;This film is well rounded with numerous familiar faces but one unknown face deserves just as much recognition as Foxx.
846;While not being the most glamorous portrayal of a legend it show how strong and utterly amazing the man really was.
847;Laced with the actual music of and by Ray Charles you get the feeling you are really watching the man himself.
848;It's certainly tough for anyone to tranform the 73 year life of the genius of Ray Charles into a two hour movie and make it work.
849;Still, a whole lot more of that great music and a whole lot less of his failings would have gone a long way toward fixing a movie more interested in the evil in the bottles than the beauty of their sound.
850;through a series of flashbacks, done in the vivid color of the then.
851;there are scenes of great courage and strength, especially those involving his mother, Aretha, played with amazing poise by actress Sharon Warren.
852;These scenes go a long way to helping the movie because we get a sense of where Ray got his inner voice, the voice that helped him become and play and sing and see.
853;Jamie Foxx is totally believable in his role as Ray Charles.
854;Curtis Armstrong gives a fine performance as Ahmet Ertegun of Atlantic Records, the man who saw the spark and encouraged the originality of the flame in Charles's music.
855;ray Charles had some remarkable people in his life.
856;The great songs are in there, of course, Hit the Road, Jack, What'd I say, It's All Right and some others.
857;taylor Hackford describes the movie he has made as an odyssey with certain events fictionalized and condensed.
858;And the last 40 years of his life, when some of his best work was produced?
859;While he overcame the potentially crippling effects of tragedy, blindness, racism, drug abuse, and infidelity, a proper life story of this man should focus on his real triumph.
860;What a wonderful uplifting film!!!
861;While these accolades aren't unjustified, the movie also benefits from a brilliant supporting cast and a laser sharp attention to detail.
862;Best of all there is an earnest attempt on the part of the late Ray Charles and of the director to tell the story with honesty
863;many viewers will appreciate that there are at least four great roles in the movie for women.
864;Kerry Washington also shines as Della Charles, the gospel singer who would become Ray's wife.
865;He uses heroin and numerous women to self.
866;an interesting aspect of the film concerns just how Ray Charles overcame his disability.
867;He gives clues along the way, such as the use of hard.
868;He also used a numbering system so that he would always wear the right colored socks with his shirts and trousers.
869;finally, for anyone who has studied the progression of popular musicians, the journey of Charles from a sound.
870;The lion's share of Charles' journey, of course, is due to his genius as a musician
871;It's a testament to this film's greatness that it can start us on that path, yet be so entertaining.
872;Like many other white teens growing up through the 70's and 80's and 90's .
873;This movie is amazing not because it tells the true story of a black musician on the rise .
874;it's amazing because it tells the story of a MAN who overcomes more than one obstical and does so without complaint.
875;Even if you hate music and don't even know who Mr. Charles was, the story is worth the time.
876;Best biopic I've seen in years
877;Jamie Fox is incredible as Ray Charles.
878;The direction is great as well as the pace of the film.
879;Shows you the highs and the lows of this fantastic human being.
880;No, Ray, we don't know you, but you give us a glimpse of yourself and your life in your music and in this remarkable film.
881;jamie Foxx gives the performance of a lifetime.
882;The story spans most of Ray Charles' life up to the point where the state of Georgia officially apologized to him for banning him from playing in their borders due to his cancellation of a huge concert because it was segregated.
883;He took interest in piano as a small boy and was taught by a man in his neighborhood.
884;Moving swiftly the plot and story shows how he traveled to Seattle and made a name for himself in the blues scene.
885;Emotions are displayed and expressed, giving real tangibility to the story.
886;I saw the Aviator and loved it because I didn't really know those people.
887;She grew up with the real people depicted and was bothered by seeing others pretending to be them.
888;jamie Foxx deserved the best actor Oscar more than any other winner.
889;These guys are real actors who have been in many good movies.
890;Jamie Foxx does like two good movies and people are throwing their panties at him and praising him like he's the best actor ever!
891;I personally think Leo DiCaprio should win the Oscar this year because his performance in 'The Aviator' was so good that it should not be passed up by some comedian.
892;I enjoyed this film immensely and was impressed by the entire production.
893;I was also impressed with director Taylor Hackford's choice to balance Ray's personal tragedies and personal life with his music careers.
894;I also liked how the film addressed the groundbreaking musical choices Ray made without being heavy handed.
895;jamie Foxx truly deserved that Oscar, congratulation.
896;The scene when she explains to Ray that their newborn son is not a gift from her to him and how his life on the road must not find its way in the home she is making for their family is powerful and the scene when Ray tells her of the death of Margie Hendrix is just as stunning.
897;Washington is an incredible actress and Ray lets her shine!Regina King was fantastic on this role.
898;Her Margie Hendrix is a blistering hybrid of passion, weakness, love and compassion, and every emotion is firmly etched on King's face.
899;The Hit the Road Jack scene is so raw and painful, and King matches Foxx's performance emotion for emotion, word for word, pain for pain, blues for blues.
900;Regina King is a miracle worker, and it is high time she is acknowledged for the incredible work she is contributing to American film.
901;It is one of the most striking scenes.
902;the story was very powerful and endearing.
903;It has captured the essence of a true American Icon and legend.
904;See the film and enjoy the music!
905;Where can I start here, there is so many great things about this wonderful film.
906;First of all, it hits all the right notes, pun intended, the music is all Ray's and it's great to have so much of it blasting through the speakers of a theater.
907;The film itself runs at what would normally be a bit too long for some, 2 hours and 33 minutes, but this film flows so smoothly that at no time did I get bored, in fact, by the end I wanted more, a lot more, but when you make a film on someone's life, you gotta end it somewhere, and I feel it covered enough to make it the great film it is.
908;This is one of the best bio pictures I've seen in a long time, probably since A Beautiful Mind.
909;Ray Charles Robinson, I love you, and so does many more, may this movie help you be remembered, you will be missed.
910;ray is one of the better movies Ive seen.
911;The acting was great in this movie, however it drug on and on.
912;Being twenty years old and not knowing enough about the musical genius of Ray Charles I decided to give this movie a try and I was very impressed with everything from the acting to all the great music.
913;We were all very impressed with the tremendous struggle that Charles had to maintain, with the discrimmination, especially in the south.
914;All an all, his life was success, because of the joy of music he brought to millions and millions around the globe.
915;how he could make me shed a tear every time he sang that great song.
916;i hope this film wins many awards.
917;It deserves a lot of praise!
918;The timing for this movie was perfect.
919;The supporting cast was awesome as well, full of extremely talented and highly underrated actors and actresses.
920;This film further immortalizes the genious as an American legend for many decades to come.
921;Thank you for approving this film and allowing us to take a peek into your life before you left us.
922;I wholeheartedly recommend this truly sensational and highly outstanding film!
923;Never in my entire life have I seen a portrayal this good!!
924;The story behind the musician is touching, memorable, delightful, entertaining!!
925;It chronicles how Ray got deeper and deeper into drug dependency and addiction and how he was constantly cheating on his wife when he was on the road.
926;Ray also gives the beautiful songs of Ray Charles a chance to shine.
927;Everybody else in the film also does an excellent job, but Foxx is the standout and rightfully so.
928;He carries Ray on his shoulders and he carries it well.
929;But when a film is made about real life, real life affects how the film is perceived.
930;The acting is beyond mimicry.
931;Thankfully Ray himself was deeply involved in the production, and knew the love and respect felt for him and his contributions.
932;His musical impact and genius will remain unmatched for a long time, but not unrecognized.
933;Thank goodness the decision was made to use Ray's original vocal tracks!
934;VERY moving, and hearing his development while watching it portrayed in the context of his life is what really tore me up.
935;VERY well done use of film to add impact to music that already is timeless.
936;'Best Soundtrack' would be a slight, it's such an understatement.
937;He did an excellent job, no doubt.
938;Very moving, and the story of Ray's development of his musical identity was stirring.
939;All the cast was excellent, certainly Oscar material.
940;certainly a MUST SEE for all lovers of GREAT R&B
941;There is a whole lot of story left in this topic.
942;Jamie Foxx does an amazing job of re.
943;enacting Ray Charles's life story.
944;This film is moving because it shows you the struggles he had to undergo when he turned blind and the struggles and turning points through out his career and his life.
945;This is a movie that can really make you respect and appreciate music that was done in the 50's and 60's.
946;I thought this was one of the best films I have ever seen.
947;This movie was well put together and all of the parts were merged together into one great life story.
948;I really think that they did a good job picking the important things out of his life and putting them together.
949;Jamie Foxx did an amazing job portraying Ray Charles, and I don't believe there could have been a better acting crew.
950;cons:There are noneOverall 10/10:I believe this was one of the best movies ever made.
951;And our knowledge of him as a man and as a creative genius is complete with this movie.
952;sort of like with Fog of War, it's amazing that Ray Charles approved the script and, derivately, the way it all ends up on screen.
953;But he expresses for all of us joy, love, sex, misery, longing, lonliness and just plain fun.
954;Ray does it up with a big band and sounds like a young man.
955;If a day goes by after I've seen a movie and I'm still thinking hard about it, it's made an impression.
956;This movie is still in my mind, every bit of it.
957;Jamie Foxx is amazing in channeling Ray.
958;The wonderful period feel of all the scenes drew me into this life and made it completely believable.
959;I lost all sense that Jamie Foxx was playing Ray Charles, and the music, supporting cast, and excellent direction drew me all the way in.
960;Who cares if this movie or Foxx's performance wins the Oscar.
961;Go see this right now!
962;What a singularly fabulous film.
963;worthy performance (and there were a number of others in this biopic), Jamie Foxx BECAME Ray Charles, much the same way Charlize Theron nailed her portrayal of serial killer Aileen Wournous in Monster.
964;Ray on the other hand, is a great movie that, despite being nearly 2 1/2 hours in length, simply breezes past.
965;She steals almost every scene she's in.
966;com reveals that this is her ONLY film (so far!)
967;I'm guessing we'll see her again.
968;kerry Washington does a superb job portraying Ray's wife, Della Bea Robinson.
969;Get out there and enjoy what will likely go down as one of, (if not THE) best films of 2004.
970;And take a careful look at Ahmet Ertegun, the Atlantic Records executive.
971;winning performance when I see one.
972;jamie Foxx is Ray Charles Robinson, the truly great American musician and composer, and RAY depicts his professional career and personal trials from 1948, when he left Florida at age 18 on a bus for Seattle, to the late 60s when he kicked a heroin habit.
973;there are at least two performances worthy of an Academy nod for Best Supporting Actress: Regina King as Margie Hendricks, Ray's on.
974;Also, the film's conclusion infers that Charles lived happily ever after with his long.
975;As portrayed, it brought forth laughter from the audience
976;rAY is arguably 2004's Best Picture.
977;see for any consumer of contemporary cinema, and an absolutely obligatory.
978;Anchored by some powerful performances but ultimately a middling and formulaic biopic, the filmmakers behind Ray should have learned a thing or two from their titular and innovative subject.
979;Ray features a GREAT performance in the middle of a GOOD movie.
980;So, the movie focuses on the broad arc of Ray's life.
981;The themes in the movie are Ray's constant infidelities, his addiction to heroine, and the question .
982;He is surrounded with talented actors and actresses whose performances are a perfect complement to his.
983;Throughout the movie we see flashbacks of his early life, from the wisdom of his poor but proud mother, to the tragic death of his little brother.
984;The music weaves in and out and reminds the viewer of the talent and versatility of Ray Charles.
985;It is a hugely entertaining film and is well.
986;So if I want a decent set of extras I have to pay, and I will fork over the cash, because it is the only way to get it.
987;Three powerhouse performances in one movie.
988;Rarely have I seen a film where nearly every actor gave a memorable performance.
989;What I found particularly interesting is that it shows what people can overcome when they make up their minds to do so.
990;My favorite lines: You're blind not stupid!
991;So many Americans could learn from this inspirational film.
992;I loved it!Jamie Foxx, who also gave an astonishing performance in Collateral opposite Tom Cruise earlier this year, was nothing short of brilliant in this career making film.
993;Foxx has come a long way since his years on the comedy show, In Living Color.
994;This is his best film to date!
995;The soundtrack is worth the price of admission.
996;other notable performances were given by Kerry Washington, who played Della Bea Robinson and new comer, Sharon Warren, who played Aretha Robinson, mother of the late great Ray Charles.
997;Hopefully, these two women will be nominated for best supporting Oscars along with Foxx and Hackford.
998;Having said that, I'll take mine whenever they give it to me!
999;LOL!Ray is a 5 star film.
1000;take your family to see this!
1001;The most heartfelt compliment I can give to Taylor Hackford's RAY is that it inspired me to seek out more of Ray Charles' music, and thus discover what a truly great and inspiring musician he was.
1002;from early original hits like I've Got a Woman and What I'd Say, he eventually put his brilliant interpretive stamp on country music, which is where his classic rendition of Georgia on my Mind comes from.
1003;But, above all, Ray Charles' soulful voice was his calling card
1004;the achievement of RAY is that both Hackford and its star, Jamie Foxx, do not shy away from Ray Charles' less savory characteristics, but nevertheless do a good job of depicting the man and the impact he had on music.
1005;Anyone who can pull off such a stunning portrayal of such a musical giant, and do it without a hint of vanity, deserves all the respect he gets.
1006;Foxx's performance is not so much an imitation as it is an inhabitation: he gets Ray's famous physical mannerisms right, but he also paints Ray as a flawed but spirited individual who, despite his attitude toward women and the business side of music, loved to perform and loved to live.
1007;He now has an Oscar to show for it, and one that is well.
1008;Such a seminal musician as Ray Charles deserves a movie that touches at the heart of why he was so special, and RAY, more often than not, does that admirably.
1009;Superb print of a great movie.
1010;Doing a music film biography can be a pretty tricky thing to pull off.
1011;bombs like Oliver Stone's The Doors (60's rocker, Jim Morrison).
1012;Thankfully, Taylor Hackford's Academy Award winning film, Ray, the story of legendary soul singer/musician, Ray Charles, belongs in the former catagory.
1013;In fact it's probably one of the best music biographies ever made.
1014;I think one of the reasons this film is so successful is because it presents us with the portrait of a truely conflicted man, who almost has a dual personality.
1015;On one hand it shows Ray Charles the musical genuis of both the stage and the studio.
1016;The film shows, that he was a musical innovator (meshing gospel and blues together to create his own unique R&B style) consumate professional, a perfectionist and a tough taskmaster, who had high expectations for the musicians, that worked for him.
1017;Director Taylor Hackford does a fantastic job of telling this story in a wonderfully dynamic fashion, that keeps the viewer wanting more.
1018;This truely was the best acting performance of 2004 and Foxx roundly deserved his 'Best Actor' Oscar.
1019;Other very good performances from the film included Kerry Washington as Charles' no.
1020;Finally, mention should be made of the wonderfully faithful recreations of Ray Charles' legendary live shows.
1021;My children, who were teens at the time didn't expect my emotion, but soon got hooked.
1022;The story is heartwarming, and shows what a strong person he was, through and through.
1023;Jamie Foxx does his greatest work yet.
1024;The supportingcast was great too.
1025;This change affects the person's morals, beliefs, and values, and as the person ventures through life there will be numerous characters with some input to the person.
1026;ray Charles had several interesting experiences and the audience is to visually experience a number of them through the wonderful performance of Jamie Foxx.
1027;the moments when Ray recollects his past and his mother's advice are initially happy with memories of his brother and his mom despite their poverty.
1028;Through his first job as a pianist for a small group he is introduced to pot, which helps him self.
1029;The music is an essential portion of the film
1030;through hit songs with new sounds such as Georgia on My Mind, Hit the Road Jack, and Unchain My Heart among many others Ray Charles' popularity grew.
1031;With the many experiences that Ray had he still reflected over what his mother once taught him, and trusted her life lessons to guide him on the right path.
1032;ray is a poignant film by Taylor Hackford who made films such as The Devil's Advocate (1997) and An Officer and a Gentleman (1982).
1033;Hackford brings a very authentic feel to the many places that Ray Charles played though the use of good mise.
1034;scene, an excellent cast, and vivid cinematography.
1035;In addition, the jumps between hallucinations, flashbacks, and reality offer the audience a genuine sense of how Ray must have felt, but this is also enhanced by Jamie Foxx's outstanding performance.
1036;Ultimately, Ray offers the audience a brilliant cinematic experience that should be reflected upon with closed eyes while pondering on our own experiences and those who have affected our life choices.
1037;lovely or Beyond on the Sea.
1038;Ray focuses on how Ray Charles came to be one of the greatest singers/song writers of all time.
1039;performed and unlike so many other music bio.
1040;picks fit well in with the story and pop up at approiate times.
1041;written true to the man it depicts.
1042;deserved Oscar for his performance and is quite a singer in the movie.
1043;pic stars Jamie Foxx as legendary singer Ray Charles.
1044;famous singer and song writer.
1045;Ray had a serious drug habit and was an unfaithful husband, yet his remarkable talent and determination helped him move from playing in smoky dives to elegant theatres, with numerous gold records and Grammy awards to his credit.
1046;i had heard so much talk about Jamie Foxx's amazing performance I didn't think he could possibly be that good, but his performance was indeed astonishing.
1047;Foxx absolutely deserved the Academy Award for Best Actor.
1048;The supporting cast is also excellent, the story is fascinating, and there are many exciting musical performances of Ray's hits that are sure to put a smile on your face.
1049;Jamie Foxx is brilliant as Ray Charles, in his best role to date and he deserved the Golden Globe award and he deserved the Oscar and the SAG award.
1050;Taylor Hackford's directing is brilliant, one of his best films to date, as well.
1051;Powerfully emotional and worth remembering.
1052;The rest of the cast was brilliant as well.
1053;Ray is one of last year's best films!
1054;Everyone knows the music of Ray Charles but very few people know his real life story.
1055;This is a wonderful if sad movie about the musician's life.
1056;Ican now understand why Jamie Foxx won best actor.
1057;jamie as Ray was excellent.
1058;I also liked how at the end they showed clips of the real Ray Charles and some photographs.
1059;All of the other actors gave very strong performances as well.
1060;For some reason I just thought that he was great to watch, although everyone was good.
1061;These scenes where very graphic and intense.
1062;This is a really good movie.
1063;Add a strong performance by Regina (227) King as a Raelette, another by Kerry Washington as Ray's long.
1064;upon wife, Sharon Warren as Ray Robinson's strong mother (Always remember your promise to me.
1065;'Cause that's how it is in the world), and wonderful music.yowza, it's no wonder Jamie won the Best Actor award.
1066;Thanks to the success of this movie indie movie fans in Palm Desert can Ohhh.
1067;But Ray offered the pursuit of a dream despite obstacles, and added music rather than boxing, with a terrific empowerment message for everyone but especially the African.
1068;I love this exchange between young Ray and his mother:Aretha Robinson: Somebody'll fetch you when the bus gets to St. Augustine.
1069;I'll keep up with the normal kids.
1070;I'll be good, just like George.
1071;aretha Robinson: This got nothin' to do with George.
1072;I wanna stay here with you!Aretha Robinson: Stop it, Ray!
1073;An' you will *always* stand on your own two feet.Young Ray Robinson: I promise.
1074;aretha Robinson: I love you baby.
1075;I'm so proud of you.
1076;this along with the superlative Coach Carter makes the Bill Cosby Daily Double for African.
1077;And Jamie Foxx pays homage to strong women in our lives both with his relationship with Ray's mother in the movie and Jamie's love for his deceased grandmother on Oscar night (We got a lot to talk about tonight.)
1078;I don't know how accurate this movie, but it's very good nonetheless.
1079;Definitely add this one to your collection, it's worth watching.
1080;Jamie Fox does a wonderful job as Ray Charles in thismovie.
1081;Incidentals: The packaging is classic, just black and white.
1082;the Movie: The movie itself is fantastic.
1083;I loved the early scenes of the rural South .
1084;for me, personally, it was a treat to actually see a bottle tree.
1085;known songs are woven throughout the narrative, along with occasional flashbacks to Charles's traumatic childhood.
1086;curtis Armstrong, who my generation knows as the sidekick from Risky Business and Better Off Dead and as Booger from Revenge of the Nerds, does an outstanding job of Atlantic Records exec Ahmet Ertegun.
1087;in fact, it seems to me that this is one of those perfect casts that happen when the stars align just so, and you get a Gone With the Wind or a Casablanca.
1088;The Extras: Here's where the special edition disappoints, surprisingly.
1089;each one talks about the women in Ray Charles's life and how they were muses for him and what a strong influence his mother was on him .
1090;You see how this was obviously a labor of love for many people involved in the project.
1091;Pluses for honesty and kick.
1092;the film by director Taylor Hackford and screenwriter James L. White basically tells the story of how Ray Charles came to two pivotal moments in his life.
1093;The first is when he took the emerging sound of Rhythm and Blues and added gospel powered vocals to basically create soul music when I Got a Woman was released in 1955.
1094;So the first part of the movie has to do with Ray Charles finding his voice.
1095;He was still very, very good, making any song he sang his own, as when he covered Yesterday, Eleanor Rigby, Look What They've Done to My Song, Ma, Living for the City and America.
1096;But the creative fire was gone.
1097;Ray is a reminder of the greatness of Ray Charles as a singer.
1098;The regular version of RAY has everything a fan of the movie would need.
1099;Jamie Foxx was excellent in his portrayal of Ray Charles.
1100;Now I can enjoy it at any time.
1101;He really did study the man and seemed to morph into him for the film.
1102;And he certainly did become self.
1103;Eventually, he wised up and his career soared.
1104;The director wisely focused on Ray's courage and conflicts.
1105;What an extraordinary life this man had.
1106;And what an extraordinary performance that Jamie Fox did.
1107;Good movie about Ray Charles.
1108;Product came in excellent condition.
1109;Like some who have reviewed this movie, I knew little about Ray Charles but after seeing this, I had to witness his incredible music.
1110;Though he was blind, Ray had the gift to make incredible music in his head and play it on the piano.
1111;ray Charles was a genius and still is, even through his death.
1112;This movie has grown a lot on me since I've seen it and I'd see it again and again.
1113;That's how powerful and touching this movie is.
1114;That's all that needs to be said about Ray, one of the best films of this year and of all time.
1115;I went into the film remembering Ray Charles as a musician my folks liked and came out with a greater respect and appreciation for the artist that he was.
1116;But to think of what this man accomplished as an artist is truly amazing.
1117;If you are surprised by his performance here, don't be.
1118;He has managed to make every film I've seen him in watchable and in this one, he is mesmerizing.
1119;And he is not alone in turning in a fine performance.
1120;Ray is loaded with them, from Sharon Warren's exceptional performance as Ray's mother Aretha, to Kerry Washington's fine performance as Della Bea, Ray's wife.
1121;Last but not least, Regina King's performance burns with an intensity that jumps off the screen as Margie, Ray's favorite Ray Lette.
1122;Ms. King has always been a presence, even in small roles and in this one, she goes for it and lets it all out.
1123;Taylor Hackford is a director who manages to get the best out of his actors and it is the acting and the music of Ray Charles that truly shines in this film.
1124;This is Academy Awarding acting at its finest.
1125;This film shows Ray as a vibrant young man and opens our eyes to a whole new world that many have never known, a world that includes segregation and the civil rights movement.
1126;The movie spans from Ray's childhood up until around 1963.
1127;Considering that Ray's career went on for forty years AFTER that is astounding.
1128;suffering wife (Regina King), stood by him all those years is an example of the kind of chemistry and love this man inspired.
1129;Foxx won Best Male Leading Actor for his sublime performance of a legend and an icon.
1130;Sharon Warren was so intense as Ray's mother.
1131;synched very well by Foxx and the backup girls.
1132;synched, I did not think I would enjoy it, but it works very well and was very entertaining.
1133;He managed to captured the physical behavior of Ray Charles without trying to mimic him.
1134;Foxx's performance is probably the best I have seen this year and definitely lightyears ahead of anyone else.
1135;The music and sound of the movie was also a winner.
1136;Foxx captured Ray Charles superbly well in all aspects.
1137;Take away Ray Charles' genius and talent for music and this is what you have: a drug addict, a bad and faithless husband, lousy father and fair.
1138;but its still a good film, Jaime Foxx's performance glued you to that theater seat.
1139;Even during the slow and dragging parts of the film of which there were quite a few, Foxx's performance was good enough to keep you from yawning.
1140;It should and a win to go with it!!
1141;Great movie about Ray Charles and how he changed the course of music.
1142;It was so interesting to hear his life story, there were so many things I did not know about him.
1143;He was an incredible man!
1144;As well as to people who have, and just want to know if it's worth re.
1145;This is one of those movies I watch on a regular basis, even though I know exactly what's going to happen.
1146;If.you have a TV that is capable of showing the difference.
1147;But the rest of the movie does benefit greatly.
1148;Like when Ray 'looks' at his watch by feeling it, I can read the tiny wording on the dial face.
1149;Aside from his amazing life, the movie itself gives a whole new spin on the sandard 'biopic' genre.
1150;Watch the movie, and then pick up the Soundtrack.
1151;jamie fox was so good playing ray.
1152;the entire story and the music were very good for the entire family.
1153;A great performance by Foxx, who is completely convincing as Charles, along with songs from Charles's original recordings for the soundtrack, make this movie both a dramatic and musical treat.
1154;Beginning with Charles's early childhood and continuing up through his later years, the movie shows Charles as a complex man who was not only blessed with amazing talent but was driven to succeed and overcome all obstacles even as a boy, despite his blindness.
1155;But overall, it's a beautifully done portrayal of a great musician and composer who single.
1156;handedly transformed the pop musical scene during his lifetime.
1157;Definitely worth your time and money to see if you're a fan (and even if you're not).
1158;What an outstanding movie about the life of the legendary Ray Charles!
1159;Jamie Fox pulled off an extraordinary Academy Award winning performance for his portrayal of the late Ray Charles.
1160;This excellent move spans Ray Charles life from the time he was a little boy growing up in Florida, through his rise to fame.
1161;The music is superb, and we get an opportunity to understand the challenges Ray Charles faced in his personal life, and as a musician and entertainer, who ultimately emerged as one of the most important figures in American music.
1162;I loved Jamie Foxx's performance as Ray Charles!
1163;He's a great comedian, sure, but as a dramatic actor he's even better (Ali, Collateral, this movie).
1164;on top of Foxx's performance, the movie serves as a very good view of a brilliant man (a genius, indeed) who faced the challenges of heroin dependency (much like most succesful jazz, blues and soul musicians in the bulk of the twentieth century).
1165;But most important, it presents him as he was able to overcome that.
1166;There is more than one scene that may be strong for some viewers.
1167;I enjoyed his music as a child and sorta grew up listening to him.
1168;I still enjoy listening to him play and sing.
1169;One of the best he has ever done!
1170;He vocalized it so well, it was almost him?
1171;Ray is a great film.
1172;I must say that the film does follow the standard formula of the Hollywood biography pic, but it is the performances that raise this move from simply very good to great.
1173;Jamie Foxx is a revelation as Ray Charles.
1174;It truly deserves to go down in history as one of the greatest screen achievements in film.
1175;It is true that you forget that you are even watching Jamie Foxx.
1176;The Oscar is as good as his!!
1177;Sharon Warren, in her film debut, is superb as Ray's mother.
1178;She and the little boy who plays Ray as a youngster, C. J. Samuels, are both heartbreakingly good!
1179;Clifton Powell is fantastic as Ray ever loyal assistant, and Bokeem Woodbine has never been better than he is as Fathead Newman.
1180;I wish we could have seen more of the youthful vigor and energy that Larenz Tate brings to the role of Quincy Jones.
1181;Aunjanue Ellis is also very effective as one of Ray's mistresses, Mary Ann Fisher.
1182;The scene when she explains to Ray that their newborn son is not a gift from her to him and how his life on the road must not find its way in the home she is making for their family is powerful and the scene when Ray tells her of the death of Margie Hendrix is just as stunning.
1183;Washington is an incredible actress and Ray lets her shine!Finally, there aren't enough words to champion the vastly underrated Regina King.
1184;Her name MUST be called with Jamie Foxx's the day Oscar nominations are announced in January.
1185;Her Margie Hendrix is a blistering hybrid of passion, weakness, love and compassion, and every emotion is firmly etched on King's face.
1186;The Hit the Road Jack scene is so raw and painful, and King matches Foxx's performance emotion for emotion, word for word, pain for pain, blues for blues.
1187;Regina King is a miracle worker, and it is high time she is acknowledged for the incredible work she is contributing to American film.
1188;They have truly thought enough of us, the film going public, to give their very, very, very best!!!
1189;So well shot and so packed with brilliant performances that you wonder why there's not a better ending to this film.
1190;dead great work over every inch of the film.
1191;His two Oscar nominations this year .
1192;Best Supporting Actor for Collateral and Best Actor for THIS movie .
1193;He is so successful at inhabiting a role here .
1194;ray Charles was also a stunning once.
1195;a. lifetime talent, and the combination of Foxx's ability working with the Charles' material is extremely pleasurable.
1196;We see young Ray growing up with a mother who wants more for her son than the poverty he is born into.
1197;we see the young musician Ray, winning the respect and adulation of fans and musicians alike while playing Country, then blending Blues and Gospel to make Soul music.
1198;an excellent introduction to Ray Charles' life and music, highlighted by an Oscar caliber performance by Jamie Foxx as the Man himself.
1199;This is my favorite movie about a musician (my 2nd favorite being Walk the Line).
1200;Jamie Foxx does an outstanding job playing the part of Ray Charles.
1201;It also covers very well how Ray's mother had a positive influence on his life and how she insisted he be strong and assertive in spite of his blindness.
1202;the music is of course great but you don't have to be a fan of Ray Charles to enjoy the movie.
1203;Its an interesting story on its own.
1204;He's got the awards to show it.
1205;The Blu Ray really kicks this movie up a notch!
1206;This move was absolutely fantastic.
1207;Ray is a remarkable biopic of legendary songwriter/musician Ray Charles.
1208;Ray does have its cliches and its pop psychology, but these are overwhelmed by a focus on Charles' music and by Jamie Foxx's portrayal of Ray, which is so good that there simply is not another choice for this year's Best Actor Oscar.
1209;nominated for 6 Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Actor and Best Director.
1210;This was a wonderful film.
1211;I was very moved by it and wasn't too familiar with who Ray Charles was prior.
1212;I was sympathetic to him and Foxx does such a good job, you just accept that he is Charles and you're watching him in real life.
1213;Jamie Foxx's portrayal of Ray Charles is one of the greatest performances in the history of film.
1214;while watching this movie I forgot it was a movie and that I was watching the past unfold before me.
1215;This film tells us the story of the first 40 years in the life of Ray Charles Robinson (1930.2004), a well.
1216;Well, in my opinion it is an excellent one, due to the fact that it entertains but also informs the spectator about another era, and a musician that lived in it.
1217;That is specially important in the case of young movie.
1218;You may have read about it in history books, but seeing it shown in a good film makes you understand segregation in its stark reality, and thank to God (and people like Ray, and many others) that times have changed.
1219;If that is the case, this movie is the right way to be introduced to this American music legend, because it pictures Ray as a person with lots of virtues, but also many defects.
1220;He is shown as brave enough to overcome the difficulties that arose from the fact that he was blind and black (in times when segregation was a reality in the south of USA), and to pursue his dream of becoming a well.
1221;absorbed, but he was a musical genius that created his own style and helped to develop soul music.
1222;on the whole, I can say that this is the kind of movie you must see.
1223;If you are already a Ray Charles' fan, you will love this movie about his life.
1224;Ray is a great movie about the life of legendary singer Ray Charles, who died in 2004 just after the movie was finished.
1225;But also his way with his family, his other women, the role of his mother, his love of music and also his drug addiction.
1226;the main reason to see this movie is the role that Jamie Foxx played, who got an oscar for this.
1227;i would advise everyone to read his autobiography Brother Ray because most of the things in that book are in the movie, he has always been very open about his drug use etc. and of course the music is amazing so for that alone worth seeing.
1228;Ray Charles, as portrayed brilliantly in this movie by Jaime Foxx, was incredibly talented, but he was kind of a jerk in some ways, particularly his womanizing.
1229;What the film doesn't mention is that he actually had 12 children, 1 from his first wife and 3 by his second wife, both marriages ending in divorce.
1230;a childhood so poor that it is miraculous that he survived and was able to accomplish so much, thanks to his strong as iron mother.
1231;i highly recommend this film .
1232;I could easily imagine watching it again and again.
1233;my wife made an interesting observation while watching Ray.
1234;It's amazing that Ray Charles never overdosed in all those years of shooting heroin, alone in a hotel room more often than not, probably.
1235;The story is inspirational, the music is sensational, Hackford gets all the period details right, and of course Jamie Foxx is f. n' uncanny.
1236;Watch it once, and if it bothers you, watch the theatrical version next time.
1237;I do not recommend the seller but it is a great movie.
1238;Kind of like an African American Walk the Line in tone.
1239;The movie retells a portion of Ray's life during the period when he was hooked on drugs.
1240;His struggle to attain stardom in the early years is portrayed well by Foxx.
1241;His wife put up with the affairs and the children born out of wedlock.
1242;A wise choice since even the best mimicks of the day have not been able to master Ray Charles voice.
1243;Harry Lennix (The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions) enters the film after Ray's success as his new manager.
1244;His performances are always on point.
1245;The cast in general does a good job of portraying Ray's little circle of bandmates.
1246;If you are a Ray Charles fan you should see this film.
1247;Foxx just may win the Oscar with this performance.
1248;A true test of Foxx's talents though, will be another role in which he has to act more than imitate.
1249;Then we'll see what kind of an actor he really is.
1250;Does anyone suspect that Helen Keller edited this film?Shame on the director for allowing the ruination of this great masterpiece in the extended form!GREAT FILM RUINED.
1251;I saw the movie a few days ago with a friend, because we heard so much good stuff about this movie.
1252;He was ok, but not that good to win an Oscar.
1253;If Ray does nothing else, it will show and inform the millions of people who eventually see it, that Ray Charles was a genius: not only in the music sense but in the financial and entrepreneurial arenas as well.
1254;But even if you discount 50% of Ray, Charles' life was still a grand, exciting trip for the old man of music.
1255;up job with the look and feel of the movie and the musical bits are raucous and fun to hear and see.
1256;Both Washington and King are able to get past the title of this film and show that they are fine, truthful actresses.
1257;And as such, it is a fine tribute to the mighty Ray.
1258;I had watched jamie fox in collatoral earlier this summer and enjoyed his performance enough to want to watch Ray.
1259;fox is excellent in his role as Ray Charles.
1260;the supporting cast is excellent and the sets work well with the period but the big thing is the music.
1261;I didnt realize that many of the songs that were sung by Ray Charles although I knew them, like hit the road jack and What you sayThe movie is about 2 and a half hours long but was well spent enjoying the life of one our musical legends.
1262;Foxx will without a doubt win Best Actor because he is just simply wonderful.
1263;The woman in this are all wonderful and man you cant beat this cast.
1264;A amazing journey and I think this is one of the best movies of 2004.
1265;It struck a nerve and I held on for the superb experience.
1266;Taylor Hackford and company did a wonderful job.
1267;RAY is an excellent biopic about Ray Charles's life.
1268;While it was over 2 1/2 hours in length, it was an enthralling 2 1/2 hours as you saw RAY go through psychological issues, inner demons, and relationships.
1269;Jamie Foxx did an exceptional job portraying RAY and I think that that is some of the best, most convincing acting 1) Jamie Foxx has ever done and 2) One of the best acting jobs any actor did in the year 2004.
1270;Seeing Ray perform in Jazz documentaries and on television, Foxx nailed Charles's mannerisms with incredible accuracy that stunned me.
1271;Excellent movie and it taught me so much that I didn't know about Ray Charles's life.
1272;This is definitely a classic for years to come and I hope that the Academy recognizes its greatness at the 2005 Academy Awards.
1273;one of the year's best!!!!
1274;for you are destined to win this year's Best Actor Oscar for this incredible performance.
1275;Foxx is so good that I too actually forgot I wasn't watching the real Ray Charles.
1276;Jamie inhabits the role so intensely one can't imagine anyone else playing the role.
1277;Under masterful direction from Taylor Hackford, RAY is an excellent biopic, whose only fault in my opinion is its length
1278;But during the time spent with the movie, you are treated to some of Ray Charles' most endearing songs
1279;The period detail is impeccable: costuming, vehicles, everything seems like it came right out of the fifties and sixties.
1280;I don't know the name of the actress who played Ray's mother, but she is wonderful in a fiercely determined performance.
1281;It is ironic that after he conquered this addiction, his stance in the recording industry lessened
1282;Congrats to Foxx for his uncanny embodiment of this musical giant.
1283;I really enjoyed watching Jamie Fox play Ray Charles simply because he did such a great job being Ray Charles.
1284;I enjoy his innovative R and B and Gospel Sound.
1285;One of the qualities the film promotes well, something I had known, is the excellent versatility and range of styles Charles could play.
1286;The film really did a great job in capturing the severe faults of the artist as well as capturing the ways he overcame his obstacles.
1287;All of the acting was superb, and Jamie Fox really really shines, showing his amazing talent.
1288;So much of film is pure junk but I no doubt feel this feature adds a lot to the life of Charles and the potential for films.
1289;the actress who played Charles wife and mother also did excellent jobs, as well as the fellow who played Quincy Jones.
1290;I liked the scene at the end with the Georgia State Legislators.
1291;As his star begins to rise, he finds love, drugs, and a mistress.
1292;I knew very little about Ray Charles, and I found the details of his life (although tweaked for the movie) to be fascinating.
1293;This is his second solid performance of the year (see also Collateral), and he is almost certainly guaranteed a Best Actor nomination.
1294;His performance is what makes this movie worth seeing.
1295;poppers to express their own voice in the world today.
1296;After the accidental death of his younger brother, Ray began to go blind starting at the age of seven and his mother, a fiercely independent and strong black woman, helped him develop his other abilities in order to better adapt to his changing environment.
1297;Ray's true gift lied with his ability to take ordinary gospel and jazz music and turn it into something spectacular, as was demonstrated by the unprecedented number of his hits he obtained in an astounding number of genres, practically unthinkable for a musician in his day.
1298;The winner for Best Actor at this year's Academy Awards will be Jamie Foxx.
1299;acclaimed comedy Booty Call but with this one practically in the bag, all is forgiven to be sure.
1300;This is one of those rare occasions in the history of cinema where witnessing a film is called for principally for the sake of one actor's astonishing performance and Foxx's take on the late.
1301;One can picture Kerry Washington's Della Bea Robinson, the wife of Ray Charles, in comparison to Jacqueline Kennedy, another spouse of a famous figure of American culture whose dabbling in the areas of drugs and women severely affected life back home.
1302;She quickly adapts her experience in life and embeds them in the young Ray in order to prevent others from treating him merely as a cripple.
1303;burdening sense of political correctness, and drastically alters the way we look at the biography genre.
1304;There are, ultimately, two distinct factors that should convince you to see this film .
1305;its rocking soundtrack and the astonishing performance of comedian Jamie Foxx.
1306;Despite some minor squabbles with particular methods used by the filmmakers, it is to be sure that Ray Charles is looking down on this film at this moment and giving it, as well as the talented cast and crew who worked diligently to make this as truthful and entertaining as possible, his blessing.
1307;The first time we watched this movie, we knew we were going to have to own it!
1308;Taylor Hackford's Ray is an often riveting, wonderfully acted biopic centered by Jamie Foxx's extraordinary turn as a great American original, Ray Charles.
1309;To play a public figure who is so idiosyncratic in appearance and manner, and so fresh in the public memory, is the thespian equivalent of taming lions: if you don't get eaten by the role, the performance is considered a success.
1310;He captures Charles' vocal and physical mannerisms perfectly, but even more, he shows us the complicated, tortured inner life of a man who battled tragedy from his earliest days.
1311;dimensional performance by a master actor.
1312;And Foxx enjoys one enormous advantage over Russell: whereas Carpenter's film was pretty much a whitewash of Elvis, Hackford's portrait of Charles is warts.
1313;all, allowing Foxx ample access to Charles' dark side.
1314;wall, as you would expect, and since it's Charles' own singing and playing mimed by Foxx, it's the best.
1315;in for an Oscar nomination, there are plenty of other Oscar.
1316;worthy performances in the film, particularly by the women: Sharon Watkins as Charles' mother
1317;I must also put in a good word for young C. j. Sanders, who gives a tremendously skillful and touching performance as the seven.year.
1318;Ray is the story of the life and career of singer/pianist Ray Charles, whose music crossed charts, cultures and generations of fans.
1319;This is a straightforward biopic, but it's a good one, driven by an impressive lead performance, bolstered by a talented supporting cast, and punctuated with great music.
1320;Ray follows Charles' professional progress and personal life from 1948, when he played with a jazz trio in Seattle that led to his first record contract, through his emerging career and success with Atlantic Records in the 1950s, to his move to ABC and international fame in the 1960s.
1321;But Ray Charles' mannerisms and voice are distinctive, and Foxx adopts them naturally.
1322;I found it interesting that being blind put him at a disadvantage, not so much because he couldn't see, but because it caused an inordinate number of people to try to take advantage of him.
1323;Ray Charles had great talent and a sharp business sense that served him well.
1324;He navigated using his extraordinary hearing instead of a cane or guide dog.
1325;He was that rare musician who could change genres, pursue his artistic impulses, and keep his audience.
1326;Ray is the story of his professional successes, personal failures, and how the man and his music embodied them all.
1327;this was the best gift that I could have given her.
1328;jamie Foxx did a wonderful job playing Mr. ray Charles.
1329;I finally got around to watching this film, and I must say that it was quite amazing.
1330;Ray made playing the piano and singing look so easy!
1331;i loved watching him just come up with lyrics off the top of his head.
1332;The man was a musical genius, no doubt.
1333;i found myself mesmerized by Jamie Foxx's ability to just become Ray.
1334;he did such a phenomenal job!
1335;He surely deserved the Oscar win.
1336;I loved the way the story flashed back and forth from the present to his childhood.
1337;The woman who played his mother was so believable, and the kids playing Ray and George were amazing.
1338;The scenes of his childhood were beautifully crafted.
1339;the brilliant colors of the red clay and the bottles hanging from the tree were just beautiful.
1340;overall I was very pleased with this movie.
1341;The music was wonderful, and all the actors and actresses involved did an amazing job.
1342;Jamie Foxx tore it up on the Big screen.
1343;the Book is a Must Read.
1344;the Acting on here is top notch.
1345;He is a Great Example of when you give a Black Man the chance to further enhance Himself His Craft you get huge rewards such as this film.
1346;so to forgetable roles&acted like that was all he could do,but the Brother proved all Wrong in this Film.
1347;all the Actors&Actress
1348;I saw this film the first day it was released and everything was perfect from the exceptional acting to the swinging music.
1349;Jamie Foxx turns in a career changing performance and maybe a few years from now he will be the new Denzel Washington.
1350;Jamie Foxx possibly gave the best acting performance I have ever seen.
1351;A deeply moving and emotional connection to the story.
1352;Comedians are often the best at turning to dramatic rolls.
1353;Possessing some kind of special human ability to imitate others to the core.
1354;He earned that Oscar with every ounce of his soul.
1355;A movie well worth owning.
1356;And, Ray Charles was an amazing person to seem so happy on the outside with such suffering boiling up from within.
1357;Jamie Foxx also gave the best Oscar acceptance speech I've ever heard as well.
1358;This movie is a must for your collection.
1359;It brings tears into my eyes everytime I remember his mom saying that!
1360;She should have been a heart.
1361;But she was a strong, couragious woman who helped her son and watched over him even long after she was gone!
1362;Sharon Warren, who played Aretha Robinson(Ray's mother) touched my heart, I guess she should have got an oscar too!Ofcourse, Jamie Foxx did a superb job with this movie.
1363;This movie is sooooo good, when a movie makes you cry and want to see it over and over again, to me that means that the movie is real good.
1364;I have revised my judgment of Jamie Foxx as an actor since his earlier work thought he was really convincing as the late Ray Charles.
1365;This movie opened my eyes to the possibilities that are available to people who are considered disabled.
1366;this is an inspirational story about a flawed man.
1367;heroine and women, and many times overlooked those who loved him the most.
1368;this might just be right for you.
1369;Definetely deserved the oscar it got.
1370;The wait was well worth it .
1371;this is a terrific biopic .
1372;He's made that big an impact.
1373;His mother is clearly the key character in his life, teaching him firmly but with love how to enhance his sense of hearing and touch in order to compensate for his blindness.
1374;This has the effect of really drawing you in.
1375;Instead of a whitewashed version of his life, you feel you are scratching the surface of a person just a little here, and it makes for fascinating viewing because it rings true.
1376;taylor Hackford the director has done an incredible job of creating striking visuals, from the dusty ochre coloured streets of his youth, through to smoky bars, and on to the over the top glitz of LA and swanky nightclubs .
1377;all the period settings ring true and are shot to perfection.
1378;You can tell this was a labour of love .
1379;much has been said of Jamie Foxx's acting here, and it's all true.
1380;he embodies the part in a way which is uncanny .
1381;However this is a performance made up of more than gimmics and prosthetics, this is the performance of a lifetime, giving the character real depth and depth of reality.
1382;i cant even name them, because every role in the movie rings ttrue, a credit to the casting and to the actors.
1383;all in all, sure there are bound to be more truths to be told about his life, but this will certainly be the best biopic made of his life, and comes at a most fitting time.
1384;terrific cast, script, cinematography and direction .
1385;the 2 disc version comes laden with extras on both the movie and ray .
1386;with delted scenes and extended musical scenes.
1387;Worth watching, when you think that Jamie Foxx did all the piano playing himself!
1388;Jamie Fox was excellent as Ray.
1389;The movie was deep and real.
1390;The movie shows us just how dynamic a mother this man had.
1391;We also get to just how much a genius this musican was.
1392;I absolutely love this movie!
1393;I watch it over and over and it always seems new each time I watch it
1394;I can't say that I've been such a big fan of Ray Charles and his music but this movie has placed the man squarely on the mind.
1395;There is a powerful story to be told in Ray Charles life but more than that this movie connects with audiences due to the essence of the music combined with one really powerful and believable performance by Foxx.
1396;The music drives the movie and you will find yourself impossibly moving along to the gospel R&B
1397;One of my favorite films received my copy within three days and its picture perfect and the price is reasonable too !
1398;this eye opening drama shows you Ray Charles strengths as a musical innovator, and also his weaknesses as a womanizer and a heroin addict.
1399;my heart ached, and rejoiced all through this movie.
1400;I cried, laughed, and cheered.
1401;The scenes were perfect to that period, the suits, the cars, and furniture.
1402;this story is so compelling, I just can't imagine people not feeling THE FULL EFFECT of Ray Charles!
1403;His music, his life, his battles.
1404;He's a legend in his own rights.
1405;All my friends think that this is fantastic.
1406;a good mix of storytelling acting and music.
1407;And the bonus features are terrific and plentiful.
1408;hackford's signature style is everywhere and it works.
1409;The music is stirring and the ensemble cast is truly amazing.
1410;One of the best examples of actors in perfect orchestration that I can name.
1411;all masterfully led by Jamie Foxx, who is certainly the breakout star of 2004.
1412;And I thought Johnny Depp could do anything!
1413;Foxx is uncanny, especially if you are already a fan of his diversity through his work in COLLATERAL and in stand.
1414;own for film fans and Ray Charles' admirers, as well.
1415;this was a great movie, played so well by jamie foxx.
1416;Jamie Foxx more than earned his recent Best Actor Oscar win with this brilliant portrayal of the one and only musical genius of Ray Charles.
1417;Watch Saturday Night Live for impersonations of famous people, but can any of those actors carry an entire film, causing the viewer to forget that its merely an impersonation and getting absorbed as though we are watching Ray Charles' life play out before our very eyes.
1418;pic pitfalls of what angle to present a famous person's life story and where to begin and end such a film.
1419;pic should be made and the creative license that convey a person's inner demons was well done in this film.
1420;The flashback sequences were well done and weren't confusing, and they helped the viewer understand the underlying motives of a childhood tragedy and how it helped create the person Ray Charles came to be.
1421;what I loved most was seeing just why Ray Charles was considered a genius, as he knew when to move on to bigger and greener pastures with an impeccable sense of timing and what he is owed.
1422;People might have thought they could pull things over a blind man's head, but he always got the last laugh.
1423;That Ray Charles kicked his habit cold turkey and never relapsed is another testament to his genius.
1424;Ray Charles' music is diverse enough for everyone to like at least some of his songs.
1425;Insightful view into the life of one of musics most influential artists.
1426;Jamie Foxx does an extraordinary job portray Ray Charles.
1427;Charles went blind from glaucoma when he was about seven years old, but the film illustrates how he overcame that obstacle, as well as many others, to forge a very successful career in show business.
1428;The movie also tells the story of Charles' triumph over drug addiction.
1429;the film makes liberal use of Charles' recordings, and I found myself dancing around my living room during some of the band scenes!
1430;The music is truly so intoxicating that it's difficult to sit still.
1431;I also especially loved the flashbacks to Charles' rural childhood, and how all of those scenes seemed to be shot in such bright contrasting colors .
1432;the red clay of the earth, the bright green of the grass, the multi.
1433;in addition, the period feel of the movie is carefully portrayed.
1434;All the visuals in this movie feel very authentic.
1435;jamie Foxx won an Oscar for his performance as Charles, and it was definitely well.
1436;I really enjoyed the fact that this movie did not sugar.
1437;But he did love his family, and he was a musical genius.
1438;Foxx (and the script) did a wonderful job of rendering him as a whole, and somewhat flawed, character.
1439;I've seen Regina King in several other films, and I've always thought she was one of the most talented actresses around.
1440;She proves it in this film.
1441;Jamie Foxx's performance in capturing Ray Charles bordered on supernatural.
1442;The movie is a great depiction of Ray Charles life.
1443;Jamie Foxx is absolutely brilliant, he makes you smile, cry, and just glow all at the same time.
1444;Jamie did a great job.
1445;Ray Charles was easily one of the greatest musicians who ever lived.
1446;His music and stylings put him at the top of anyone's lists of favorites.
1447;This movie was very well done and I hated for it to end.
1448;he will probably follow up this gift by showing up in catwoman part 2.
1449;I felt I was looking at Ray Charles himself throughout the film
1450;Anyway, the movie was great.
1451;I guarantee that Jaime Foxx will win at least the Oscar for this movie.
1452;And for people who say that the movie is bad because it just shows him womanizing and taking drugs, well, that was part of his life.
1453;I was always a fan of Ray Charles and always enjoyed watching him perform on television.
1454;I knew him only as an old man, a family man, and a music legend.
1455;worthy, I readily admit that it was a moving film .
1456;and as I said before, a VERY good biography that shares with us plenty of Ray's music to enjoy along the way.
1457;Jamie Foxx was fantastic .
1458;I never knew he could act that well!
1459;This movie was a very good showing of his capabilities as an actor.
1460;there is no action packed into it like there are in fictional movies.
1461;Jamie Foxx deserves the Oscar, and the movie proves there will never be another Ray Charles.
1462;Even if you are not a fan of Ray Charles' music, and I don't know how you couldn't be, the movie will make you a fan.
1463;It does a great job showing how there were no limits on Ray Charles talent, and the things that kept his music and his life going.
1464;I highly recommend this movie whether you are a Charles fan or not.
1465;Based on the 30 minutes or so we were able to watch, it looks like it's a really good movie.
1466;I am pretty smart when it comes to movies and great acting and this is it.
1467;Jammie Foxx gives the performance of his career in Ray.
1468;He walks, acts, and talks like him!
1469;HELLO This is one of the greatest performances in movie history because it stands so true and Mr. Foxx stays in character throughout.
1470;Last but certainly not least Regina King as his back up singer.
1471;Her performance SHOULD earn her a Best Supporting Actress Award at the Oscars.
1472;I love Ray Charles' music.
1473;I am very emotional when it comes to movies, which makes me love movies.
1474;What makes this movie special is the subject
1475;For this he won the Best Actor Oscar?
1476;What is the key to Ray is the music.
1477;It was well presented and I was singing to myself for days after.
1478;Enjoy the music and see if you can get subtitles.
1479;Ray is a compelling drama chock.
1480;full of some of the best performances of 2004.
1481;The film is a trip down the rabbit hole into the life of a legendary American icon whose career had a tremendous impact on musicians of all ages, races, and musical persuasions.
1482;Ray grew up strong and independent, and his passion for music, which was a strong influence in his life before the loss of his eyesight, never faded.
1483;I highly recommend this movie for all.
1484;This is truly a movie worth purchasing from Amazon for your movie library!
1485;Great credible acting performances from these three.
1486;Maybe Ray left Atlantic on the rosiest of terms, but it seemed like the movie went to great lengths to tout how wonderful and progressive Atlantic Records was.
1487;the soundtrack, obviously, rocks, and there is some good acting, but it cannot compensate for a lackluster script.
1488;Probably worth seeing for the music alone, though.
1489;The man's music still knocks me out, and the film does justice to it.
1490;His acting was just absolutely flawless.
1491;I was never a really big Ray Charles fan but I loved the music in the film.
1492;The special features on Disc 2 were excellent including the uncut performances that were cut short in the original film and the meeting of Foxx and Charles in a studio in 2002 to see if Foxx met Ray's approval (which it obviously did).
1493;Foxx is not only a talented actor, but an extremely gifted pianist come to find out.
1494;up comic and television star is a force of reckoning in the entertainment industry.
1495;Ray allows Foxx to showcase his superb gift of mimicry for he totally immerses himself in the role of the late musical legend.
1496;brilliantly supporting Foxx are Kerry Washington as long.
1497;up singers, and Sharon Warren is unforgettable as Ray's mother Aretha.
1498;Aunjanue Ellis is also superb as Mary Ann Fisher, another singer that had her designs on Charles.Young actors C. j. Sanders and Terrone Bell are most effective as young Ray and George, respectively.
1499;it is also refreshing to see Clifton Powell, an actor frequently cast as a heavy, in the role of Jeff Brown, a trusted friend and aide of the blind singer.
1500;director Taylor Hackford also deserves credit for bringing out the best in each performer, as well as having a good eye for the period.
1501;The costuming, the set pieces, and the tone of the flick capture the 50's and 60's marvelously.
1502;Jamie Foxx is extremely gifted and gives a masterful performance in this movie.
1503;I've watched it a few times since, it's a wonderfully made film, which FINALLY earned Taylor Hackford a nomination as Best Director.
1504;The acting is very fine
1505;Ms. King, in particular, will bring a tear to your eye, a short but powerful display of fine acting.
1506;The Oscars are next week, and all indications are that Foxx will win the Oscar.
1507;The great Ray Charles has been given a loving tribute, complete with fine music, acting and period detail, not to mention very loving direction by Hackford.
1508;this is essential viewing to any fan of the great Ray Charles Robinson.
1509;This movie is absolutely superb.
1510;I highly recommend this biopic of the legendary Ray Charles.
1511;It's up there with,'Amaedaus' with the added challenge of depicting a well.
1512;Foxx is totally convincing and his lip.
1513;syncing of his master's voice from 50s and 60s hits is nigh on perfect.
1514;But he is an actual musician and thus gives the director the benefit of being able to pan from keyboard shots to the musicians entranced face which enhances the sense of documentation rather than simulation.
1515;Foxx seems to have been born to this role His is a performance of supreme devotion and richly deserves the applaudits it's gathered.
1516;ray's hunger for success and dealing with the administrative moguls is crisp without being condescending.
1517;The lads at Atlantic are given very sympathetic portraits.
1518;The retrieved early childhood scenes glove well.
1519;That he survived and generated the music he did is the outstanding fact and the balance sheet, for all his considerable foibles, reads in positive ink.
1520;Making your performance mimic that of a real life person with as much vitality and genius as Ray Charles would almost be an Olympian endeavor.
1521;How he managed to imbue the role with the soul of the man, is comparable in acting to Charles' musical talent.
1522;no, the story isn't pretty.
1523;Charles moved from alcohol to heroin with almost the same rocket.
1524;He also had affairs with his backup singers.
1525;overseen by Mr. Charles before his death, the acting is superb.
1526;Overall, the movie's an inspiration and very worth having in your collection.
1527;In theory, I like the concept of the icon.
1528;life dramas can be put to film, yet without the perverse language and nudity.
1529;foxx is absolutely incredible, as is regina king and the entire cast.
1530;well worth the freezing cold!
1531;the film runs every gamut of emotions, and, of course the music is so triumphant.
1532;the digital transfer and ac.3 sound are both marvelous.
1533;jamie fox was fantastic .
1534;as far as ray charles, remarkable human being.
1535;Good item was in good conditon .
1536;I enjoyed the movie watched it a few times .
1537;overall:JF's performance makes the movie well worth watching.:)
1538;An emotionally rich story covers from his early childhood and the tragedies and dissapointments that cultivated a natural blues and soul voice and through his successful years.
1539;But you come away with an emotionally filled experience and realize that despite his imperfections, God gave him a truly unique voice that rose above all his handicaps to acheive legendary status as one of the major figures and forces in American music.
1540;Don't forget, it too is nominated for Best Picture as well.
1541;This movie is overpowering in its raw emotive force.
1542;Yet, with the help of a few powerful women, Ray Charles was able to shape his own destiny.
1543;You become privy to the full force behind each song and style.
1544;But Ray Charles was smart and picked up on things others couldn't.
1545;In the end, he made his own way, on his own terms with his own strength of character.
1546;let me also address the music.
1547;The songs were beautifully done.
1548;This movie is not only an epic story in history of one music genius but, like Ray Charles himself, is itself a national treasure.
1549;See this one and you will be sure to find inspiration in every phase of your life.
1550;To me this movie was truly inspirational.
1551;This is a wonderfully vital story of a man who made it to the top of his profession in a way that may be possible only in America: he was black from the Jim Crow South, blind, and poor, but he rose by talent and guile, with many injuries along the way.
1552;The portrait is completely believable and emotionally compelling, from his strong and wise mother to his devoted, yet long.
1553;i was utterly riveted by this story, got a splendid introduction to his music, and felt wonder at the maelstrom of opportunity and racial obstacles that is this United States.
1554;One of the best films I have seen in years.
1555;This is a very good movie that houses an exceptionally great performance by Jamie Fox as music legend Ray Charles.
1556;Ray Charles is presented as a musical genius who had managed to overcome physical disabilities that would have stopped most others, but it doesn't attempt to mute the serious and unflattering personal moral problems he had with drugs and his exploitative treatment of women.
1557;Though pleasant with others for the most part, Ray is shown as a proud, independent, and slightly self.
1558;As a result, Ray Charles emerges in the film as a believable human being, capable of unfortunate decisions, but also extraordinary music and the occasional powerful moral stand, such as when he refuses to perform in a racially segregated crowd in a venue in Georgia.
1559;corresponds to the end of the peak of his career as a creative musical performer.
1560;For the last forty years of his career, his sets consisted almost entirely of songs he made famous in the fifties and early sixties, with covers of songs by other musicians.
1561;jamie Fox will without any possible doubt receive an Oscar nomination for this performance.
1562;This is considerably more than a good impersonation of Charles: it is almost as if Fox channels him.
1563;Yes, he does a killer impersonation of Charles, but he manages that first on top of that provides an amazing dramatic performance.
1564;This is great acting, not merely a great impersonation.
1565;i also really loved the look of the film.
1566;I loved the cars, the clothes (especially the ties!
1567;The scenes in the shanty town where Charles was a child were very effective.
1568;the cast aside from Fox was quite strong, made up mainly of relatively unknown performers.
1569;There were many other things to enjoy about the film.
1570;Of course, the music is absolutely sensational, consisting either of remasters of original Ray Charles's recordings, or new recordings for which Charles provided the vocals.
1571;I also loved the relationship in the film between Charles and Ahmet Ertegun and Jerry Wexler of Atlantic Records.
1572;Ertegun is rightfully remembered as one of the truly great figures in the recording industry, someone who was in it more for the music than for the money, and who treated his artists with a degree of respect that was too frequently absent.
1573;The film does a good job of presenting Charles's dilemma: ABC.
1574;All in all, I loved this warts and all approach to the subject matter.
1575;There is absolutely no question that Ray Charles was one of the most astonishing performers of the fifties and sixties, and doing all he did despite his blindness is an amazing saga.
1576;He truly was a genius, even if he was a somewhat flawed person.
1577;But you have to love the way that he managed to overcome his personal shortcomings to become not merely one of the most successful but one of the most beloved musical performers of his age.
1578;great video, sound track is just awesome.
1579;Showing what he overcome and his talent for producing hit songs are amazing.
1580;The story is compelling no doubt.
1581;This is a blue ray that is worth watching over and over.
1582;Jamie Foxx gives a moving performance channeling the tortured soul of Ray Charles, who passed away in 2004.
1583;Foxx gives insight into the life of Ray Charles as he tours the country and becomes one of the most innovative voices ever heard in America.
1584;The genius of Ray is the performance given by Foxx.
1585;the rest of the supporting cast is good, with an excellent Regina Washington as Ray's wife.
1586;All in all, this movie gives viewers a deeper delve into the things that haunted Ray, and how he overcame them to become the great singing sensation who produced What'd I Say, Georgia on My Mind, and Hit the Road.
1587;Foxx deserves nothing less than an Oscar nomination, as this performance is the best I've seen in years.
1588;somehow, the makers of this movie found the right balance.
1589;i was surprised at what a wonderful job Jamie Foxx did.
1590;just never thought of him as a great actor.
1591;I noticed in the closing credits that most of the musical performances were dubbed by Ray Charles's own recordings, but some of the performances were sung by Jamie Foxx himself
1592;Foxx did a great job at making the character appealing despite his flaws.
1593;I'd like to see it again.
1594;powerful performances by some of the supporting cast: Sharon Warren (a beautiful woman), playing Ray's mother, created a beautiful portrait of a poor but proud woman who stood up for herself.
1595;Promise me you'll never let anyone make you a cripple!
1596;a strong and proud woman who rises above Ray's road romances.
1597;on a technical note, the production design of the movie was superb.
1598;I bought this movie a few weeks ago and finally got aroundto watching it.
1599;The acting was top notch.
1600;Anyway, I thought themovie was well done.
1601;Jaime Foxx gives a sensational performance during his portrayal of the musical legend Ray Charles.
1602;verbal communication, I was most impressed by Foxx's mannerisms.
1603;With Foxx's acting and musical talents (he went to college on a classical piano scholarship), he truly is by far and away the best actor for this role!
1604;The music is astounding and the supporting characters are memorable.
1605;Overall, this film is as enjoyable to watch on the 9th time as it is on the 1st.
1606;Jamie Dox did a super movie about Ray Charles and his life .
1607;Recommend to anyone and all to watch it.
1608;****1/2One of the top films of 2004, Ray is a stellar biopic that charts the life and career of one of the certified musical legends of the twentieth century.
1609;Armed with this sense of independence and determination, which helped him to out.
1610;maneuver those who would exploit him, Charles eventually made his way to the top, even though, as is often the case with artists and performers, his personal life was often at odds with his success.
1611;Writer James L White and director Taylor Hackford have a fine eye and ear for the period in which the film is set, as we see Charles struggling for recognition in a race.
1612;sensitive society, finally achieving crossover success in the 1960's, and even becoming the first major performer to defy Jim Crow laws in the segregated South.
1613;winning performance, Jamie Foxx literally inhabits the role of Charles, capturing each of the singer's trademark movements and inflections with utmost accuracy and precision.
1614;blood human being whose genius and talent often took a back seat to his misdirected obsessions and passions.
1615;The entire cast is excellent, but special kudos go to Kerry Washington, Regina King and Sharon Warren as the three key women in Charles' life.
1616;fashioned in the very best sense, Ray, which was released in the same year that Ray Charles himself passed away, serves as a fitting tribute to a man whose life and talent inspired generations of music lovers past and present.
1617;Jamie Foxx earn that oscar winning for this movie Ray.
1618;Him being blind he can tell which one is beautiful by feeling on their hand and arm.
1619;This is the best well.
1620;talented Jamie Foxx who does an oscar.
1621;worthy performance in the movie Ray.
1622;With an excellent supporting cast with the standouts being Kerry Washington and Regina King.
1623;this movie shows the triumph of the human spirit.
1624;Everyone has a favorite scene and I have two favorites.
1625;this wonderful young female actress shows, in body language and facial expression alone, the full range of emotion and pain and angst a mother would feel in similar circumstances.
1626;She loved him enough to force him to become independent.
1627;Ray's life was hard but he was richly blessed with a mother whose wisdom and sagacity far exceeded her youthful age.
1628;the really, really cool trivia and my second favorite scene: When Ray is escorting his new girlfriend home, they're walking along a tree.
1629;This is a very well done rendition of Ray Charles' life with an outstanding sound track.
1630;Saw this movie in the theater when it came out and knew I'd have to own it some day.
1631;The movie Ray, directed by Taylor Hackford, is a compelling drama about the journey of a man battling against poverty, racism, and of course, overcoming his blindness, in order to express his talent.
1632;It is based on a true story about the life of a black musician named Ray Charles.
1633;Ray grew up strong and independent, and his passion for music, which was a strong influence in his life before the loss of his eyesight, never faded.
1634;Soon after arriving in Seattle, Ray's real journey of making himself renowned began.
1635;jamie Foxx holds the challenging role of Ray Charles and greatly depicts the latter's life in this movie.
1636;Ray is an interpretation of the extraordinary life of Ray Charles who, in spite of his inability to see, became a wonderful musician and internationally renowned performer.
1637;As the movie unfolds, we discover a character so full of life and passion that it seems real.
1638;Indeed, the film features many of Ray Charles songs and it does a good job of tracing his music career.
1639;as a whole, I think that Ray is an excellent movie which reveals many of the problems our society faces today and shows the competitiveness present in the world, notably in the music realm.
1640;The long length of the movie is forgiven thanks to the outstanding acting of Jamie Foxx.
1641;I love this movie because they portrayed Ray as a normal human being with weaknesses just like all of us.
1642;I have been a Ray Charles fan for years.
1643;Jamie Foxx did an incredible job as Ray.
1644;I cant believe how long I waited to see this fine film.
1645;I am a great lover of Ray Charles' music.
1646;I guess it never occured to me that a film could be such a striking tribute to such a powerful force of music.
1647;The Cast, Direction, Music and everything else made this a memorable experience.
1648;Like saving a fine bottle of wine and enjoying it fully.
1649;Thanks, Jamie and Thanks, Ray.
1650;ray Charles(Jamie Foxx) is undeniebly one of the greatest music legonds of all time.
1651;And the supporting cast really added a backup punch as well.
1652;And he said d@mn right I wouldn't.
1653;If Ray Charles, God rest his soul, could see this, I'm sure he'd be very proud to see his life reinacted in souch a spectacular way.
1654;The film is so well done in every way, the whole 2 hours 33 minutes I was glued to watching this truly amazing story of Ray Charles.
1655;the storyline jumps back and forward showing how Ray Charles childhood went and how he has be.
1656;came this brilliant music legend.
1657;It really brings you through his life and how hard it was for a black.
1658;It shows how he raised above everything that got in his way.
1659;Ray is a decent prestige picture with a piece of excellent, Academy Award.
1660;winning mimicry at its center.
1661;Kerry Washington and Ragina King play the two most prominent women in Ray's life, wife Della and mistress Margie Hendricks .
1662;One survives the turmoil of Ray's life and the other commits suicide
1663;I really enjoyed this movie, I saw it on television months ago, but wanted to see it again.
1664;Very good movie, that is based on the life and struggles of a very talented man, who overcame very many obstacles.
1665;Well, it has pretty much all been said in the other reviews.
1666;but, Just wanted to say that this is an emotional, vibrant, dramatic, funny, totally moving, work of art, and I hope it sweeps the awards.
1667;it deserves it, and so does the memory of a legendary performer.
1668;The forerunner of soul music and one of the best artists the world will ever see.
1669;His amazing life of breaking through drug addiction and slowly integrating both whites and blacks in the community was accurately documented in Ray.
1670;despite the fact that Jamie Foxx, had to act blind, he performed it extremely well.
1671;Although the screenplay was very average, the performance by the actors was superb.
1672;The docudrama was thoroughly well done.
1673;I thought the music Ray Charlies composed was remarkable and it emphasized the scene harmoniously.
1674;Amidst all the Grammy's he won, he announced that his proudest moment was in fact becoming part of the Georgian community.
1675;ray was a wonderful movie to watch and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
1676;There were some parts of the movie that I was very shocked by.
1677;This was one of the best performances that Jamie Foxx has ever given.
1678;I love this movie too.
1679;But Jamie Foxx does a great job convincing me he is Ray Charles.
1680;The story covers Ray's life up to the 1970's and it feels like it does so in real.
1681;jamie Foxx's portrayal of Charles is outstanding.
1682;he nailed everything to perfection.
1683;time classics:Hit The Road Jack,Unchain My Heart and What'd I Say.
1684;foxx definitely earned his Best Actor award.
1685;Taylor Hackford's Ray is one of the best musical biopics, and its core strength comes not from its appreciation of Ray Charles' music or from its command of Ray's life and times (which are definitive strengths, but are common in biopics).
1686;Rather, the key strength of Ray is its willingness to show the gigantic flaws that haunted the beloved musical genius.
1687;Ray gives us the man who could be a beloved family man and husband when at home, but could be a womanizing heroin addict when on the road.
1688;It's refreshing to see a movie take such an unvarnished stance towards its hero.
1689;most revealing is Ray's first exposure to heroin.
1690;Ray is still a bit player in a two.
1691;This love of heroin follows Ray for several years.
1692;another strong point of Ray is its willingness to show how revolutionary Ray truly was.
1693;any fan of Ray Charles' music will be pleased with the selections from the soundtrack.
1694;While anyone could surely come up with some personal favorites that weren't part of the movie, the high points are definitely met.
1695;Ray brings to light one of the lesser known aspects of Ray Charles' career .
1696;he made a country music album while at the height of his career, risked career suicide to do it, and pulled off one of the best country albums ever made.
1697;In fact, his performance in Ray is so solid that his other Oscar.
1698;nominated performance of the year, as the cab driver in Collateral, is easily overshadowed.
1699;He won for the right performance.
1700;see movie for fans of American music.
1701;The first one is bringing the music by Ray Charles to the attention of the newer generations, allowing the genre to resurface in its popularity.
1702;The second is the outstanding performance of Jamie Foxx, who demonstrates that when you do something from your heart, things usually turn out right.
1703;the director Taylor Hackford was lucky to wait fifteen years for the right actor to come along, but he also shows that he played an important role in the success of this movie.
1704;helps the viewer understand better the motivations behind most of the artist's actions.
1705;Those that see him as a flawless man will have a tough time watching some of the scenes in this film.
1706;But if you understand that he was not perfect, but someone who learned to overcome adversity, you will likely be pleased with the final result.
1707;those that love the music of Ray Charles are in heaven with this movie, since it has a myriad of music segments (more than ninety), and one of the most amazing facts is that Foxx plays the piano himself in all of them!
1708;I think this helped a lot in achieving a more believable performance, and his ability to imitate the way in which others talk helped a lot too.
1709;One thing is undisputable: Jamie Foxx received one of the most deserved Academy Awards of the last few years.
1710;It is intriguing to watch the story of Ray Charles life as a father, a singer, a musician, a player, a dreamer, vulnerable, strong, determined, lonely, a junkie, a business man, and listen to the tunes I have learned so well.
1711;Jamie Foxx did a phenomenal job playing an extraordinary man.
1712;This is truly one of the most inspiring and amazing films I have seen in recent years.
1713;Ray is a stunning visual spectrum of the life of Ray Charles, the architect of soul.
1714;Impossible to take one brilliant man's life and squeeze it into a two and a half hour cinematic spectacle, director Taylor Hackford did an amazing job with what he could conjure into our hearts and minds.
1715;Foxx gets beneath Ray's skin and sinks inside a complicated, unpredictable but beautiful man and makes us feel Ray's joys, pains, angels, and demons.
1716;The same way she haunts Ray's subconscious, she haunts the audience with her emotional and tough.
1717;Regina King is a fireball as the soulful Margie Hendrix, Ray's long.
1718;time mistress and Kerry Washington is remarkable as Ray's incredibly loyal wife.
1719;Outstanding performances make this movie so truly captivating.
1720;It may sound cliche, but it is a movie that stays with you long after the credits have rolled.
1721;He is a great historical figure who provided a soundtrack to the black experience by taking gospel and rhythm and blues and creating soul music, which expressed the existential love and pain of the black experience and it was revolutionary at that time and still revolutionary when you think about it today.
1722;It's amazing how a gifted, blind man with a piano could change the world.
1723;very moving and insirational story of the legendary ray charles.
1724;it was quite a story and the movie came on time .
1725;the disc was clean and case in very good condition as was the artwork.
1726;The movie was good, Jamie Fox was great.
1727;The movie a tad long but interesting story with good direction and all around performances.
1728;Foxx's performance in the title role is moving, funny, vibrant, alive.
1729;there's music aplenty in RAY, filmed with energy and performed with spirit by the large cast.
1730;Regina King and Kerry Washington shine as the women in Ray's life.
1731;A celebration of an American original.
1732;I forgot it was Jamie Fox . . . thought it was Ray Charles!
1733;To overcome drugs and still be a gift to the world is phenomenal.
1734;As 2003's Charlize Theron was deserving for her Oscar, Jamie Foxx is deserving as well as for his outstanding portrayal of the musical genious.
1735;Director Taylor Hackford waited 15 years to make this film and it's a good thing he did.
1736;Not exactly for children because of the realistic and explicit documentation of drug addiction, it is definitely a must see for any adult who loves music and Ray Charles!
1737;Jamie Foxx does a perfect job portraying Ray Charles.
1738;The music he does is sang in his own voice and he sounds very close to Ray.
1739;Not sure how close it is to true.
1740;Ive heard they added some elements to make it more movie worthy but its still an amazing movie.
1741;Jamie Foxx does an excellent impersonation of Ray Charles, but that's only good for about 20 minutes worth of entertainment.
1742;Was he able to mend his relationships with his wife and kids?
1743;This movie shows thestruggles and triumphs of Ray Charles.
1744;ray starts as a young, African American boy growing up on a sharecroppingplantation.
1745;Throughout the movie Ray ages andprogresses in the music world and he ended up revolutionizing the industry.
1746;along with music Ray also fought segregation and combined the cause withthe music industry.
1747;After doing research on whatCharles was really like it has been discover that Foxx portrayed the characterof ray perfectly and he completely captured the charismatic character thatRay Charles is.
1748;Foxx also won an Academy Award for best actor.
1749;Some ofthe great supporting characters include Ray Charles' mother and his wifewho were played by Sharon Warren and Kerry Washington.
1750;These womenreally added to the movie and helped the viewer understand the characterof Ray Charles when they were with him.
1751;The director of this movie wasTaylor Hackford who did a great job on capturing the role of Ray Charles andeveryone who revolved around him.
1752;The storyline was very intriguing as they madethe life of a blind man intriguing.
1753;based on other reviews this movie is actually very accurate to the actuallife Ray lived.
1754;Also based on research this movie is quite accurate.
1755;Therehave been some names, places and event that had been slightly altered butoverall the movie is realistic.
1756;overall the unknown story of Ray Charles and his ability to overcome hisstruggles and rise to triumph make Ray the inspiring docudrama that it is.
1757;Ray is a brilliant film looking at the life of Ray Charles.
1758;Jamie Foxx does an excellent job of portraying the man and you get a real feeling for the times he performed in and what shaped his music.
1759;Of course the soundtrack is amazing.
1760;I found myself completely engrossed throughout and the direction style reminded me of Ali in places, which is no bad thing as that film is superb also!
1761;Overall a great film, which should both entertain and move.
1762;Well, they did and now Foxx has won the Golden Globe award for best actor in a musical/comedy for his performance as the late musician Ray Charles.
1763;The film successfully details these events, and does it with an eager enthusiasm.
1764;The major drive behind of the movie, however, and the true highlight of the entire story is the music.
1765;Remember, this is a movie about Ray Charles, the man who sang such classics as You Don't Know Me, Hit The Road Jack, Georgia On My Mind, and Unchain My Heart
1766;The movie Ray is fantastic.
1767;There is a good word for Jaime Fox in this movie and it is cool.
1768;Jaime Fox (Ray) is cool!
1769;I had never even cared about Ray Charles or his music until I saw this movie and now Ray Charles is one of my favorite singers.
1770;My least favorite parts of a movie with music is the music itself!
1771;I loved t. he music.
1772;I've always been a big fan of Ray Charles.
1773;It was an incredibly well written movie that did a great job of making us feel what Ray Charles must have been feeling.
1774;Looking at life through him was moving and beautiful.
1775;And on top of that the music was inspiring.
1776;an experience I never got to have.
1777;This is a must see movie that leaves you with the need to see it again.
1778;I, for one, will be going twice at least.
1779;So I just waited and bought it.
1780;I found this movie to be very good.
1781;I thought Jamie Foxx made a very convincing Ray Charles.
1782;overall, this movie was really good, I enjoyed it very much.
1783;A good movie, if a bit dark and depressing.
1784;Both my husband and I really enjoyed this film, crying several times and gaining new appreciation for the talents of both Ray Charles and Jamie Foxx.
1785;it really detracted from our overall enjoyment of the film.
1786;i'm surprised that it was released as a watchable version of Ray, an otherwise very impressive film.
1787;Jamie Foxx in his portrayal of the late Ray Charles is outstanding.
1788;This movie is a definete for a classic.
1789;An all around Oscar performance for Foxx a must see for both young and old.
1790;This film is exceptional, people.
1791;First of all, the film is cinematically breathtaking and well.
1792;The acting is nothing short of superb, with Jamie Foxx worthy of every ounce of the Oscar.
1793;crafted and unsparingly honest and unbiased in its protrayal of the imperfect title character.
1794;His musical icon status is not soiled upon and for me, I actually gained a greater appreciation for his contributions and his opening the door for all those that followed in his footsteps.
1795;I loved the movie and recommend it wholeheartedly to anyone and everyone.
1796;making at its best and worthy of an addition to any notable movie collection.
1797;ray is a perfect picture of humanity.
1798;This was a wonderful film.
1799;He began to be cast in dramatic roles in big.
1800;But he proves the nay.
1801;sayers wrong with his amazing and unforgettable performance in this movie.
1802;jamie, in his role as Charles, is remarkably like Brother Ray with his mannerisms, as if he had channeled the beloved legend's spirit and brought it to life on screen.
1803;The supporting cast is also very strong.
1804;I don't recommend it, though .
1805;the editing is poor), extended musical performances and interviews with Ray's friends and admirers, and footage of Ray and Jamie together.
1806;If he's good enough for Ray, then he's good enough for me.
1807;I'll be pulling for you to take home that Oscar.
1808;a beautifully crafted film that showed as much of the best and worst parts of Ray Charles.
1809;Jamie Foxx's performance is exceptional and has my vote for this year's oscar
1810;What alien took over Jamie Fox's body and turned him from a good actor into one of the world's best.
1811;It was the most amazing piece of acting work I have seen in years.
1812;I raise a glass to you Mr. Fox and the cast of Ray.
1813;Ray is the story of the legendary Ray Charles, a man who went blind at the age of 7 but still managed to become of the greatest music icons of jazz and others in the world.
1814;some people compared this to Jonny Cash's movie, Walk the Line.
1815;I think both are extremely well done movies, and this is one movie that needs to be seen in order to fully understand what one man had to go through to reach his goals in life.
1816;I went to see this movie last night, and I tell you I was awed by this man's life
1817;I thought Jamie Foxx's performance was overrated.
1818;They're more talented and resemble Ray Charles a lot better.
1819;One of the few movies that you can watch over and over again without it ever getting played out.
1820;Throughly entertaining from beginning to end.
1821;An actor's most important tool is the eyes, so for all of the hype Foxx has received, I expected him to be a genius with his body movement, being stripped of his eyes entirely.
1822;(Jim Carrey in Man on the Moon succeeded in the perfect balance of impression and humanity and yet was denied an oscar nom because he is white.
1823;Unlike Carrey, Fox never created a solid foundation in comedy from which he could venture.
1824;The entire movie he disregards those that love him and womanizes all over town.
1825;I was totally ready to love the movie, but drugs, sex, and rock and roll do not make a film.
1826;If Foxx was truly brilliant, then the film as a whole would follow suit.
1827;This movie has become one of my favorites to watch.
1828;There is great acting, casting, and visual.
1829;I enjoy this movie and will never get tired of watching it.
1830;Yes Jamie Foxx does a good job, yes Ray Charles was one of the giants of the second half of the twentieth century, and yes Ray is one of the better movies of 2004, but it does not live up to the hype.
1831;Oh there were fine acting by both the lead actor and some of the leading ladies including several unknowns.
1832;For instance, Regina King deserves huge kudos for her role as legendary Raelette Margie Hendricks.
1833;Another woman who gets my appreciation is Sharon Warren who played Aretha Robinson, Ray's beloved mother.
1834;And last but not least Kerry Washington who played a convincing Della Bee Robinson (Charles' second wife) to the hilt.
1835;old Ray moved to Seattle to continue his professional career as a musician.
1836;Nevertheless, he moved on to form his own band and toured with Lowell Fulson.
1837;also Ray played alto sax a few times.
1838;The amazing fact is that when he was stoned and doped, he was making some of the greatest music ever made and he never missed a gig .
1839;I'm sure he still performed in Georgia after 1961.
1840;good movie if you term out the actual reality of what Ray did and done after the fact.
1841;Here's the real truth about Ray Charles Robinson in summary terms:1.)
1842;Ray was still a teen when he moved to Seattle to make a living.4.)
1843;Ray had three kids with Della and nine children with other women (most notably Margie's son).8.)
1844;Ray Charles continued to be a top concert draw and superstar after 1966.10.)
1845;other than that, it does cover his musical talents, his great business savvy and his unique sense of himself walking and cavorting alone as a blind individual.
1846;that's how edgy he was and he was definitely cutting.
1847;He had a great sense of bringing people together.
1848;And somewhere in Heaven, the angels are singing I Can't Stop Loving You with him.
1849;Rest in peace, Brother Ray.
1850;As you watch this movie you can easily forget that this is not actually Ray Charles.
1851;I have never done any extensive research into his life so I can't vouch for the accuracy of all the events, but from an entertainment standpoint it is top.
1852;Director Taylor Hackman, who worked with Ray Charles and Ray Charles Jr. for the last 15 years on this project, proves to be a master to deliver such a touching and sometimes shocking history of a man who gave so much to the world through music and passion for life.
1853;This is truly a master piece.
1854;it personified Ray Charles's spirit.
1855;From Terrence Howard to Regina King ( who gives a searing performance as Charles's estranged mistress )everyone seemed to give their charactors a heartbeat and a presence, that moves the entire rhythm of the film.
1856;The editing is rather choppy , but the directing is top knotch.
1857;It's such an amazing story, that it's hard to imagine, anyone getting through Charles's turmoils and challenges , during that period of time.
1858;Ray , cleverly, seperates the musical genius from the problems and addictions that plagued him , for most of his life.
1859;I think the director did an excellent job of  keeping it real .
1860;as for the movie and the story ray is a superb movie
1861;The rest of the cast also were great and in the period.
1862;Ray is an excellent musical biography of the late, talented Ray Charles.
1863;I enjoyed this film immensely and was impressed by the entire production from the superb performances of Jamie Foxx, Kerry Washington and the underrated Regina King to the realistic costumes and art direction and beautiful cinematography.
1864;i was also impressed with director Taylor Hackford's choice to balance Ray's personal tragedies and personal life with his music careers.
1865;I also liked how the film addressed the groundbreaking musical choices Ray made without being heavy handed.
1866;jamie Foxx should win the Oscar.
1867;one of the most moving scenes in the film is when Ray's character is a child and learns to cope with being blind, while his mother observes.
1868;It is one of the most striking scenes in film this year.
1869;see the film and enjoy the music!
1870;Well worth your time to watch it.
1871;Ray Charles was an incredible musician and this was the best movie to come out last year.
1872;His good points as well as his failings are portrayed honestly and fairly.
1873;Ray Charles was quite a man
1874;Jamie Foxx gives a landmark performance in this movie.
1875;This wonderful man will never be forgotten.
1876;Despite the too familiar ways of showing the psychological aspects of his life, the film is skillfully edited, and shows his genius as musician and strong will for success, both of which are no surprising matters.
1877;Made with the artist's own saction, the film is fairly honest about the negative sides of his personality .
1878;[MUSIC] But the film's greatest strength lies in the interpretation of Ray Charles' music, or how his style came to be what it is.
1879;It is easy for anyone to portray him as genius, but the director knows rightly that his talent lies in innovation .
1880;And 'Ray' presents us the innovator's way of thinking, or inspiration, by cleverly putting his classic songs in the context of his own history.
1881;At that moment, the music gets irresistible.
1882;but all the actors, especially Jamie Foxx and Sharon Warren as Ray's mother are so memorable that you won't just stop watching it.
1883;but for all its small flaws, 'Ray' will remain in your mind as a great tribute to Ray Charles and his music.
1884;Watch and listen to it.
1885;I am so speechless after seeing this breathtaking masterpiece, I can only type.
1886;Ray has to be one of the greatest movies of all time, and should have won best picture over the almost as great boxing movie, Million Dollar Baby.
1887;Jamie Foxx gives an absolutely stunning performance as the legend of R&B himself.
1888;This movie inspires the heart and stirs the soul.
1889;While sometimes disturbing, this movie also touches the deepest part of your being, as you go through his life in his eyes.
1890;I recommend it to everyone, I mean EVERYONE.
1891;Jamie Foxx did a wonderful job playing this role.
1892;Joel Siegel from Good Morning America calls Ray One of the best films I ever saw.
1893;Ray is an attempt to present the life story of the musical genius, Ray Charles Robinson.
1894;The plot revolves how a black man was able to become a star in a segregated America.
1895;Blind since the age of seven, Ray shows how the musician was able to overcome this disability, and become one of the most influential musicians of the twentieth century.
1896;Ray eventually strengthens his sense of individuality through the style of his music over the course of the movie.
1897;If I can feel the music, that means it's real is his excuse for continuing the use of heroine.
1898;In addition, the biography is more from an objective point of view, as opposed to telling his story from one character's eyes.
1899;a notable component of the movie is the incorporation of flashbacks to Ray's childhood.
1900;The flashbacks are shot with a more mellow and warm light, indicating a more harmonious atmosphere and nostalgia every time Ray reminisces about his childhood.
1901;ray portrays Ray Charles as a bigger hero than he actually was.
1902;This guilty pleasure is not clearly portrayed by the movie, as scenes of Charles' performances are always cheerful and in good spirits.
1903;Without a doubt, Foxx is able to portray a Ray Charles very closely to the real individual.
1904;overall, Ray is a movie that was produced with great effort and good intentions.
1905;how could it be when Ray himself (and his son) helped with the project and approved the script.
1906;This is a movie that shows the damages of drugs, sex, and fame.
1907;Although it doesn't follow Ray's life as does his autobiography (there are some theatrical embellishments, but again, with Ray's approval) it still has the finesse and great acting to be a superb movie.
1908;This is an amazing movie, and I encourage anyone reading this to check it out!
1909;This is a truly wonderful film with great music and fantastic performances.
1910;The visuals are crisp and bold with amazing colors and detail.
1911;The sound is top notch and serves Ray's music well.
1912;Most films in the biopic genre follow the same conventional formula: modest beginnings and/or scarring experience, growing popularity, ultimate success, ultimate downfall, personal and public redemption, then a little piece about how the subject affected his or her society.
1913;In a year full of biopics about influential men .
1914;one would hope at least one or two of these films would transcend the genre and stand as one of 2004's better films.
1915;What we see is a montage of performances and recording sessions cataloging Charles' musical history.
1916;suffering wife (Kerry Washington, doing well with what she's given) waits at home alone with children, watching the man she loves transform into a burden.
1917;Of course, she stays home as it grows larger and larger as her husband's career does the same.
1918;Luckily, 'Ray' is full of strong performances to keep its audience awake during the trouble spots.
1919;jamie Foxx as Ray Charles gives the film's strongest performance.
1920;His acting is kinetic, moving with a force that both captures the real.
1921;life Charles' spirit and easily identifiable mannerisms while also exploring the inner being of the man and his struggles with being blind, an adulterer, and a heroin addict.
1922;road mistress, Margie (one of the Raelettes), also gives a stand.
1923;out performance that manages to be at once dimensional and enthralling.
1924;perhaps 'Ray's most underrated performance is Sharon Warren's as Ray's mother, Aretha Robinson.
1925;collectively, these performances, in addition to strikingly visceral music and a creative flash.
1926;While the film unevenly refers back to Charles' era and growing popularity, Hackford refrains from fully penetrating the psyche of Charles as a human being, and we never fully understand what drives him to create as passionately as he does.
1927;I believe it is an unwise decision that plagues the modern biopic, hindering any chance at breaking convention and exciting the masses the way the men and women the genre focuses on did in their time, discovering, creating, and uplifting
1928;iN the Year 2000 . . . in Akron OHIO, I finally gotto see .
1929;The Academy Awards should make an exception, and award Jamie Foxx with an Oscar at this time.
1930;This movie is destined to be a classic.
1931;I became a big fan.
1932;My two sons are fans.
1933;I saw Ray Charles in an excellent concert a few years ago, and I must say that Jamie Foxx really captured the essence of my most favorite singer of all time.
1934;Jamie Fox appeared to be possessed by Ray Charles' Spirit.
1935;jamie Foxx and the supporting cast have made the movie of a lifetime.
1936;What a quintessential performance by Jamie Foxx!!!
1937;Ray Charles has sung a lot of great songs, including Georgia on My Mind, which became the state of Georgia's state song.
1938;No matter which name they announce on Oscar night, Jamie Foxx will still be the winner.
1939;Foxx's performance towers above everyone else nominated this year.
1940;He channels Charles' energy, quirks, movements and personality in a performance that doesn't just mimic Charles but goes right to the heart of the man.
1941;director Taylor Hackford's love of music infuses this film as it has just about every other one he's directed.
1942;The difference here is that Hackford truly has found a larger.
1943;life but very mortal artist that changed the sound of R&B
1944;What makes Ray so powerful is its unflincing honesty about Charles' demons and infidelities.
1945;It also shows that, regardless of Charles' sins, his salvation always could be found in the emotional core of his music.
1946;The colors are rich with remarkable detail and the solid blacks are highlights of this transfer.
1947;The 5.1 soundtrack features a rich full bodied sound that immediately pulls you into the action.
1948;Charles' songs (featuring both original and new recordings) sound terrific in the 5.1 format.
1949;It's fun to watch and a worthwhile addition to the set.
1950;Ray Remembered features interviews with those that worked with him past and present both on his albums and those that observed him while working on the film.
1951;The two disc edition features a number of fascinating featurettes on the women in Charles' life, the Soulmates featurette, a documentary on Taylor Hackford's love of Charles' music and difficulty in getting the project made and an exceptionally good documentary on Charles entitled Ray: An American Journey.
1952;There's also a booklet on Charles and the making of the film.
1953;taylor Hackford's incisive commentary track tackles a wide range of topics from the challenges of shooting the film, recreating the past and the wonder and awe he felt working with both Foxx and Charles.
1954;It's one of the few solo commentary tracks worth listening to from beginning to end.
1955;Although the portrait it paints is frequently less than complimentary and unpleasant, it also allows us to understand the passion that drove this singular artist to help create a unique sound in music.
1956;The acting is incredible as Mr. Foxx IS Ray Charles.
1957;Showing his childhood in a series of flashbacks, as opposed to seeing it all at once at the beginning of the movie, was effective in keeping the viewer wanting more.
1958;Treat your loving wife better than your mistress?
1959;Any film adorned with the music of Ray Charles will fill audiences with excitement and awe, and any performance comparable to Jamie Foxx's depiction of Ray Charles warrants viewing.
1960;tV biopic of a man who broke conventions and genres and helped shape modern music.
1961;productive outlets, Charles also escaped with his music.
1962;maybe the virtuosity of his music and the strength of great acting performances is enough for a film, and if that is true, Ray works (because that's about all that is to be admired).
1963;the picture was sharp and the colors were good, Audio was very well done.
1964;Director Taylor Hackford parlayed a biography of one of the most uniquely talented singers of the post.
1965;world War Two era alongside a commanding performance by Jamie Foxx to propel Ray beyond the ranks of the traditional biopic into much more, a soul searching reflection of a great performer seeking to overcome the temptations of stardom and overcome an affliction that threatens to kill him.
1966;One of the film's most inspiring scenes unfolds when Charles's mother, at the time he is going blind, tells him that she will be his eyes and give him instructions, but only once.
1967;She reasons that this is the way life operates
1968;One city where he receives an opportunity to be heard is Seattle, where he meets a young Quincy Jones and they explore the local musical world together.
1969;another important element of the film is the exploration of how Charles fought back when those around him sought to take advantage of his blindness.
1970;the compelling performance of Foxx as a man under the influence of drugs is reminiscent of the brilliant effort of Ray Milland as a man addicted to alcohol in the sober and hard.
1971;hitting Billy Wilder 1945 drama, The Lost Weekend, for which the British actor, like Foxx six decades later, was rewarded with a Best Actor Oscar.
1972;While his loyal wife stays home and takes care of their son Charles engages in affairs with singers who perform with him, including one who has his child.
1973;charles's vital link to the rapidly developing civil rights movement of the sixties is also dramatically presented.
1974;One scene presents Charles at his most admirable when he refuses to cross a picket line and perform before a segregated audience.
1975;Ray is a film with heart and soul that, through Foxx's dominant performance, gives us a fascinating look into the life of a genuine performing genius.
1976;The strongest supporting role accolades go to the underrated Clifton Powell as longtime road manager/assistant Jeff, the man who keeps Ray grounded and in touch with his morals and obligations.
1977;As I stated before, the music is timeless and never goes out of style and a documentary about the man and his creative process would have served his legacy better than this fodder, but since audience expectations are so low and the Oscar race/hype machine has to start somewhere, RAY is as good a place as any.
1978;jamie Foxx was the right choice to play the legend.
1979;I had no idea that his life was so remarkably painful and inspirational.
1980;After seeing him in this entertaining and emotionally impacting film, I trully admire his performance that is definitely the top five of the year!
1981;Even though he's very deserving to win, I have a feeling they are going to give it to Leo.
1982;It also covered his marriage, the affairs with the singers in the band and his fans.
1983;He also learned to let go and forgive himself when his dead brother and mother came into his dreams during his recovery.
1984;we get to hear many of Ray's greatest hits throughout the film, and my favorites are Georgia On My Mind and Hit The Road Again.
1985;That's why his life is so inspirational.
1986;i thought the actress who played Ray's mother was very outstanding compared with the other female leads.
1987;She should've gotten a Best Supporting Actress nomination.
1988;i have watched the movie several times and i love it.
1989;the music, of course, but his 
1990;Fantastic movie, a must have.
1991;Jamie foxx does an incredible job.
1992;And the music, well, brought back some great memories of my youth.
1993;No wonder Jamie Foxx won the Academy Award in '04.
1994;To ANY fan of R&B, this is a must see.
1995;I think this movie will get best picture ans Jamie Foxx will win best actor.
1996;i thought they put very good songs i think this movie should be dedicated to famous man Ray Charles and if it weren't for him this movie wouldn't get made and we would not really be able to listen to top 10 jazz.
1997;also I would thank Jamie Foxx because his grandma died and he still was able and felt better to be in this movie and also Ray charles and Jamie's Grandma is looking down at him and he is a good actor.
1998;Ray is a fantastic tribute to a true genius.
1999;The entire cast is superb and we see Ray as he was, the good, the bad and the ugly.
2000;We get a good sense of the timeline of Ray's life and get a good idea of what the business of music was all about in that era.
2001;There are many good lessons to be learned here, Ray learned them well and this film will help generations to come to know those lessons.
2002;Besides ray being blind and all what makes his life so special that he needs a movie about him.
2003;Even without knowing about Ray Charles and his legacy left behind, Ray is a movie that tells his story with style and grace.
2004;It's a movie that's informative and entertaining, and for someone like me who did not grow up listening to Ray Charles, the generation gap was not an issue.
2005;I enjoyed the story and appreciated his music as told by Jamie Foxx.
