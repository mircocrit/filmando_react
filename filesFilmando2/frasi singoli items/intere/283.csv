1;Mr. Bale does a good job in this picture, and the eye candy doesn't hurt :)
2;First of all, the book is brilliant.
3;churning, it is haunting and it gets under your skin for a long time after.
4;It tells the story in first person of a person who sees women as sex objects, and wants what he can get out of them.
5;so, with that cleared up, on to the movie.
6;Christian Bale fleshes out the character brilliantly, and is by far the greatest asset of the film.
7;willem Dafoe is a solid actor who struggles with a role that doesn't really suit him, but does the best he can.
8;So should you see the movie?
9;If you have the stomach for it, it may well open your eyes.
10;Christian Bale is masterful in this early in his career movie.
11;The dark humor is simply unparalleled.
12;I have been a huge Genesis fan since their 1980 album, DUKE, states batemen.
13;christian Bale is absolutely brilliant as Patrick Batemen.
14;The movie showed just enough restraint to keep you guessing though.
15;sharp insight, you'd think Ellis speaks from firsthand experience and perhaps he does.
16;and it is, in many ways.
17;But it's also clever, insightful, smart.
18;and wickedly funny and true.
19;Ellis' novels are full of these amazingly detailed accounts of clothing and fashion.
20;Those who have the most social privilege and power will naturally have the greatest range of free actions with their inner raging demon.
21;tech voyeurism with Uncle Sam paying for $1 billion of gadgets.
22;This is a great movie!
23;Christian Bale plays the disaffected yuppie with astonishing and creepy ease, and he is just a ton of fun to watch.
24;I recommend it to others.
25;This is my favorite movie.
26;I was so happy to find this on blu.
27;ray on Amazon for such a great price.
28;the movie itself is a combination of a few genres.
29;There arew also elements of a black comedy, and a 'psychological' element .
30;but even with all these elements, I felt that most of all, this was a period piece .
31;Great plot and very relevant to the times then and now.
32;Christian Bale is absolutely superb.
33;Photography and music are excellent as well.
34;I thought I would enjoy this movie but it just wasn't my cup of tea.
35;I checked the imdb after viewing to have them explain it to me.
36;interesting movie, definitely a must.
37;I can't say I ever read the book, but Bale brings the character to life almost effortlessly.
38;Patrick Bateman is cynical, malicious and downright hilarious, all in one.
39;The supporting cast is rather impressive as well, with Willem Dafoe playing a detective suspicious of Bateman, Reese Witherspoon playing his plastic fiance and Jared Leto playing his unspoken rival.
40;One must wonder if he is the socially elite of the New York business world, the prime example of an obsessive compulsive, or the face of evil itself with an endless expense account and an unquenched need to kill .
41;The phenomenally understated Jared Leto delivers a mirror performance to Bale's as another suit in the business world.
42;yet, everyone continues to see Allen walking the streets and having lunch with him.
43;Questing everything from the mouth of Bateman, as well as his surroundings.
44;for anyone looking for that film that contains an amazing score, an ensemble of known actors giving us performances of a lifetime, and direction that both mimics and mocks the lifestyle in New York during the 80s .
45;"than ""American Psycho"" is the film for you."
46;"Batman Begins, ""The Prestige"", ""Velvet Goldmine"", and the ""Machinist"" are all within my top films of all time."
47;American Psycho ranks above them all.
48;Again, maybe not the best in history, but a scene that constantly makes me laugh, shiver in terror, and remain in awe of the skill known as Christian Bale.
49;I look at the overall value of the film, and this is a cult film, hands down.
50;"overall, ""American Psycho"" ranks among one of my favorite films of all time."
51;I loved his interpretation of a Phil Collins song.
52;It was these small elements that all came together perfectly for this film.
53;American Psycho is a look within the business soul.
54;The insanity of New York, the pressures of working in a constantly obliterating corporate world, the standards of humanity .
55;all blend together just far enough to make you question the existence of the man sitting next to you.
56;this is the film for you.
57;now, I gotta go return some videos.
58;bateman was a master of fitting in.
59;He possessed all of the qualities needed to succeed in 'society'.
60;The movie (and especially the book) decribres a society who has vanished morals in favor of surface.
61;PS:the movie has really funny moments, even if it's not a comedy, hasn't a cliche ending (damm morons)and stop comparing Patrick Bateman with Norman Bates fot the Love of Hitchcock!
62;I was quite satisfied with the movie and it made me want to read the book.
63;For its time and budget, American Psycho is a well.
64;I remember reading Ellis' American Psycho during the early 1990s.
65;The sleek and seductive surroundings and camera angles proved to be almost as descriptive as my own imagination during that first reading.
66;"Though, I've read countless reviews and analysis of this film, I feel compelled for the American audience to fully understand what its nature is
67;O. k., most reviewers mention the comic aspects of the film/book.
68;talk of the classic yuppie and is prone to manic breakdowns.
69;Viewed from this standpoint, the movie shall transcend its own platonic acetate, and the viewer can seemingly watch two movies simultaneously.
70;This movie is excellent and achieves brilliance in all ways.
71;It's funny, it's scary, it's thought provoking.
72;One the one hand, it's brilliantly made.
73;white furniture and spotless apartment is perfect) makes the movie work very well.
74;She gets the satire, and even (at times, anyway) manages to keep the movie itself from descending into to the misogynistic filth of its subject matter and protagonist.
75;acted (Christian Bale is astounding"
76;It really gives you insight into his mind and he really explains why he is so violent.
77;Christian Bale turns in a superb performance, in this well crafted thriller.
78;If you havent seen this and you like thrillers it is a must see!!
79;One of these rich Ceo's just so happens to be a mass murderer.
80;"Patrick Bateman, Christian Bale, takes you into his world
81;The film is brilliantly directed.
82;A story which displays a number of gruesome and well.
83;This movie had none of the above, which is what made it such a fantastic and original film.
84;Perhaps it is my dark humour, but I've always enjoyed this film.
85;If you're looking for a dark satire about Wall Street and corporate America in the '80s, you've got it.
86;Plus, Christian Bale is beyond excellent.
87;I love everything Christian Bale does!
88;He is an excellent actor who is very serious about his craft, and it shows.
89;You then realize that every scene portrays its characters as almost characters of themselves, polished and human.
90;When we see Bateman, a reflection of our ideals, carry out ritualistic acts of violence, it come across as both disgusting and hilarious.
91;I had previously watched this movie when it first came out and I loved it then.
92;I thought I'd watch it again and although I do like the acting and like the whole 80's theme it was too violent for me.
93;The only issue I have with it is that the case was busted when I got it, but the the disc was fine and it's a great movie, so it's not that big of a deal.
94;The show starts out kinda goofy but turns out pretty good.
95;This is a great movie.
96;Christian Bale's performance was superb.
97;A great balance of suspense, sex, and gore.
98;The soundtrack was great too.
99;There is a reason you can view this movie for free.
100;To call it an oscar performance might be a little over the top, but it was excellent.
101;The violents scenes are excellent, and the balance of horror and social commentary bring to mind a mix of Romero's Dead Trilogy (SOCIAL COMMENTARY) and History of Violence (Violence).
102;If you enjoyed any of the aforementioned films you might enjoy this.
103;the film is set in 1987 and patrick depicts everything about the rich yupies of that era.
104;id recomend this film to anyone who loves the 80s or a good suspense movie or black comedy.
105;he reaches out, continually, trying to find a human connection in a sea of flesh.
106;He is surrounded by shallow people, in high society, incapable of having any meaningful conversation, incapable of true empathy towards one another, inexorably constructed by the media around them.
107;The murdering and sex, are circumstantial to the true point of the film, which is social satire.
108;His character is astonishing and this film is not for the faint of heart.
109;A true dark comedy that brings wicked smiles and painful cringes.
110;The movie evokes the time period quite well, and brings us into the doubled edged world of Patrick Bateman.
111;I like original, and this is original.
112;Some may prefer the novel, I have yet found time to read it, but as the film goes, it takes you out of your living room into 1980's New York City and into the world of a madman.
113;In all honesty, the first three quarters of `American Psycho' is flawless.
114;I know that it has been noted that Ellis' enjoyed this movie adaptation, and maybe that should mean something for me, but I still can't help but gawk at its overly comical ending.
115;He's made fun of as apposed to being made fear.
116;this has nothing to do with the fantastic acting within this film, which I feel compelled to point out.
117;Christian Bale serves up one of the greatest performances of his career and certainly one of the best of that given year (can you say Oscar snub).
118;He truly gets inside Patrick Bateman, residing within his delusions and creating a truly terrifying as well as understandable character.
119;Chloe Sevigny also delivers as Bateman's secretary Jean.
120;Her scene within his apartment, the scene with the nail gun, is my favorite scene in the film.
121;Reese Witherspoon is great here, if not underused, and Jared Leto has one of the most memorable scenes here (the one scene in the film that really crawled beneath my skin).
122;The murder scene is graphic yet done in a mesmerizing satirical way that truly captures what Ellis' novel was all about.
123;It could have been such a fantastic film"
124;Mary Harron had a major opportunity here to build on greatness and deliver something the world has never seen.
125;It begins with such masterful potential and it builds on it with such fire only to freefall into stupidity and destroys everything it worked so hard to accomplish.
126;This is a great movie that few people like.
127;The main character, Patrick Bateman, is an ideal character because is able to get away with things that anyone would be arrested and locked up for.
128;It's a magnificent twist about the conscious and sub.
129;conscious, along with what's real and in someone's head.
130;Either you love this movie or you hate it, and I have to go with the seemingly small crowd that loves it.
131;ellis is one of the most underrated writers of the 20th century.
132;"If you enjoy a movie that makes you look below the surface and actually think, ""American Psycho"" is exactly that."
133;I love that I have watched this movie a few times, and there is so much to it that I look forward to the next many times I watch it, to notice and analyze much more symbolism and foreshadowing than what I did through my previous viewings.
134;I must admit that it is very violent, even grotesque at times, but Christian Bale's acting and Mary Harron's direction are terrific.
135;"ellis' novel some ten years ago, I finally got around to watching this (at least partly inspired by the positive reviews here)
136;I have enjoyed her other stuff eg.
137;'I Shot Andy Warhol', which is definitely a much better film than this one.
138;Mary Harron (director, co. writer) did a good job of making Ellis' book watchable, and the subtle pokes at the 80's Wall Street mentality were funny.
139;way scene which was cut for US audiences is actually very funny in a oh.
140;eventful, but that stems from the book.
141;If they don't, watch this movie, and look beyond it's graphic nature, and enjoy it for the social satire.
142;This is a great, cult classic movie.
143;It's definitely a must see!
144;This frigthtening movie is compelling.
145;Christian Bale makes a very convincing psychopath.
146;I Love all three of the American Psycho movies: American Psycho, American Psycho 2, and American Mary.
147;The acting is first rate, the storyline keeps you interested, the characters well developed so you can't help but related to some of the craziest things they come up with (stopping short of killing someone ofc).
148;Since most sociopaths are devoid of emotion, Christian Bale is perfect for this role.
149;Amazing how he can keep a straight face at times.
150;cat"""" message on the ATM."""
151;The depiction of yuppie rich materialistic life implicates a larger culture of unchecked consumption: corporations and their penchant for destruction.
152;either way, this film is a study of narcissism and moral vacuity (and perhaps something more), with Christian Bale giving a remarkable, hilarious performance.
153;I thought it was astonishingly raw and very good.
154;This movie manages to capture the important ideas and themes of the book, without the gratuitous violence.
155;But it has so many redeeming qualities, so don't judge it on that alone.
156;There's also a lot about mistaken identity.
157;i'm inclined to go with the latter, but there are some great, skillfully ambiguous scenes that allow you to make an argument either way.3.
158;The music/pop culture soliloqueysThese are in the book as well, and they're fantastic.
159;Bateman has some interesting music tastes.
160;Even if you hate the rest of the movie, you'll love these.
161;this is just a great movie.
162;American Psycho is a surprisingly funny movie.
163;It is an amusing caricature nonetheless.
164;He's an archetype of a narcissistic man.
165;here I was expecting a gory thriller, but it turned out to be a satire, and an amusing one at that.
166;on one level it is a film that simply plays with audience as good films with good plots tend to do.
167;This is my favorite movie of all time.
168;Every movie he is in, he always seems to be on top of his game.
169;I love the book as well, which is more explict then this.
170;This movie is incredible in all regards.
171;We get all of this in the form of Patrick Bateman, the successful Wall Street executive with chiseled abs and a model girlfriend.
172;He kills homeless men, prostitutes, a cat, and even an old woman.
173;He revels in the amount of blood that he lets flow.
174;"The sex in this movie is relatively intense and ""sadistic."""
175;I feel that the answer is both.
176;the beauty of this movie lies in how much it still applies to modern society.
177;anyway, this is a brilliant movie, especially with regards to acting.
178;As Patrick Bateman, Christian Bale pulled off a sensational yet realistic performance that was so enthralling and eye.
179;pleasing that he should have won an Oscar for his actor.
180;The other actors are all perfect.
181;Reece Witherspoon plays Bale's snotty and lousy girlfriend and does superbly well.
182;One cannot but help laughing during the business card, Paul Allen, and stray cat scenes, all of which are brilliantly crafted.
183;, the movie itself is one of my top five of all time.
184;for those with a warped sense of humour or even those who just enjoy an amazing movie with superb acting, I recommend this!
185;Christian Bale is an excellent actor who must have had some kind of personal chuckle imitating an uptight, arrogant, wall.
186;Bale gets 5 stars for his stellar performance.
187;I was so excited to watch this movie.
188;American Psycho, the film, is really a totally separate entity from American Psycho, the novel.
189;She has extricated the satire and the humor from the novel's gratuitous (and largely unnecessary) violence, which (I believe) detracts from the themes of the novel.
190;The film serves as an effective indictment of the 1980's Me culture and the yuppies who were responsible for sustaining it.
191;Christian Bale nails the character of Patrick Bateman.
192;If you have an offbeat sense of humor and you know what the definition of subtext is, you will enjoy this film.
193;Although Bret Easton Ellis did a good job in the novel Less Than Zero when painting the superficiality of the characters, this is also reflected in the movie American Psycho.
194;Christian Bale's character is a good example of somebody with Asperger syndrome.
195;The rating of American Psycho stays the same as before.
196;Heck, not even the soundtrack redeemed it, and I love 80s pop.
197;in the end, you'll feel exactly what the main character feels .
198;I absolutely love the movie.
199;Bale as Bateman is inspiring, everything from the voice to the overall look and he plays unhinged so well.
200;the amount of that is more than sufficient.
201;in a very entertaining type of way.
202;received on time best of psycho movies i have seen in a long time would recommend others to see.
203;christtian bale was execellent in the role he played as well.
204;The movie itself is a four star masterpiece, and we get a bevy of special features and an extended cut.
205;wave to create a social satire, surreal black comedy, and suspense horror all rolled into one fantastic movie.
206;the killer inside is someone he hides behind this mask of success and humanity.
207;But he struggles to even be human.
208;christian's performance is amazing, as we find out in the commentary that not only did he have an amazing and rigorous excercise regimen to get an amazing physique, but in some scenes when he is dealing with inspector Kimball (Dafoe) he actually sweats on cue.
209;Anyone who has seen him in Batman Begins, The Machinist, Equilibrium, or Velvet Goldmine will know he is a modern master, always putting himself through intense preparations for his roles.
210;The rest of the actors are great too, with their 80's parody and preppy accents.
211;the movie does a really good job of an ambiguous ending and keeping the line between what Bateman is imagining, and whats actually happening.
212;this is the 'uncut killer edition' so we're treated to some great specials features, in fact more (in a sense, more on that in a minute) than I've seen.
213;She talks about the idea behind translating the book to screen, some of the happy accidents during shooting, the actors, etc.
214;It's a good commentary that not only gives you info on the movie, and the controversary surrounding the book and movie.
215;They also go quite in depth in these three bits about the controversy of the book, and later how that affected the movie.
216;It's a look at the nostalgia elements used in the film.
217;overall this disc is a great special release, and even if you already own the original, get this one.
218;A great addition to horror fans or yuppie haters collections.
219;Is it a masterpiece deserving of praise?
220;christian Bale's performance as Patrick is simply stunning.
221;He fills the character with humour, anger, charm, intelligence and copious amounts of vanity.
222;Christian makes even the strangest of scenarios in Patrick's existence appear to be completely realistic for him.
223;The direction is perfectly understated and considering the extreme nature of the book it is based on, the screenplay is as loyal as decency (amongst the general movie going population anyway) and budget would allow.
224;i thoroughly enjoy this movie.
225;Despite all the disconcerting aspects of the story it remains an entertaining film and multiple viewings have definitely been rewarding.
226;Heavy in nostalgic 80's theme music, clothing and slang.
227;This has got to be one of the best black comedies I have ever seen.
228;The music, the clothes, the Master of the Universe yuppies all go to build a great background.
229;Then there is Patrick Bateman (an outstanding performance by Christian Bale but more on that later).
230;This is all done in such a stylised way that it is funny .
231;but strongest of all is his narcissism.
232;i loved this movie because it took me in one direction (the black comedy, the blood, the psychosis of a man losing control) but then it kicked me back to a very cerebral and deeply intuitive understanding of human nature and the rage within.
233;best of all was Christian Bale who I must admit I had not seen since Empire of the Sun.
234;The difference between the character he plays and the actor himself is amazing to watch.
235;What a performance, what an actor.
236;so give your self a good kick up the backside and watch this.
237;A good insight in psychosis in a disturbed way.
238;Interesting movie but I would not watch it again.
239;The violence is ironic and funny: we are able to focus on the social satire, not lose the points in moral outrage.
240;"He is in ""murders and executions,"" he reveals when asked."
241;Lines like this are layered through American Psycho, as if one action is akin to the other.
242;and you'll never have more fun than when you watch Bateman play that game in American Psycho
243;He's a perfect physical specimen, perfectly wrapped in designer suits.
244;pampering shower regimen is a wonder to behold!
245;"On the exterior, he is handsome, well groomed, and ""together"", while his interior is a frenzy of violence and death."
246;His friends are as unaware of his problems as they are of their own, living only to burn up the vast amounts of money they make in the most impressive ways possible.
247;AMERICAN PSYCHO is a great character study of a man bereft of character.
248;Bale plays his role with ease and confidence.
249;in a way I'm surprised, positively.
250;'Cause the film has some good ideas, some good parts.
251;And although Christian Bale starts out well and is well.
252;So nice to look at too.
253;The film has a cult following and boasts four stars on the International Movie Database.
254;"I liked Bale as Bateman
255;He is capable of being the handsomely beautiful man on the big screen that Patrick Bateman is described as in the book.
256;He has the range of being able to shift from perfect etiquette to murderer flawlessly.
257;some novels are never meant to be made into films, it is impossible for their creativity and uniqueness to translate well to the big screen.
258;The transition between scenes was excellent, as was the overall camera work.
259;The portrayal and critique of """"yuppie"""" culture that appears in the novel is presented well."""
260;In the end of the movie, Bateman's final, moving scene is a shot with him on the phone in tears, confessing his crimes.
261;The film differs greatly from the novel here.
262;He continues on with his sociopathic ways.
263;i would have to recommend this film for anyone who is a fan of Christian Bale, or unique thriller movies.
264;There is quite a lot of wit written into the dialogue throughout the movie, making even the most bloodless scenes enjoyable.
265;top violence (which is not especially graphic, any controversy notwithstanding) and if you like social satire, this is worth a watch.
266;scenes like these are definite high points, both humorous and horrifying, and driving home the filmmaker's point (about soulless, faceless businessmen) with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer.
267;also, the ending is a sort of twist.
268;It's interesting to note that the violence and sex is over.
269;Poetic license, in this movie, was used too often.
270;If one is not so critical, it is a fun watch.
271;The dialogue was to clever to be believable, or even stomachable.
272;There is absolutely no good reason to watch this movie as you will gain nothing from it.
273;All the best scenes of American Psycho occur in the first three quarters of an hour.
274;Christian Bale meticulously describes his morning routine with hilarious results and constantly tries to explain the significance of 1980's pop music.
275;The Greatest Love of All's transcendant beauty makes it by far Whitney Houston's most accomplished record he claims, before butchering two girls.
276;There is also a perfect scene in which Bale and his peers spend ten minutes arguing over who's business card font is better.
277;the violence (and sex) may be unsettling to some but is often times hilarious if you are willing to take it with a grain of salt.
278;This is a very clever and sophisticated film that could be perceived incorrectly.
279;It is one of 2000's finer movies and deserves something better than to be overlooked because of the book's notoriety.
280;This movie grabs your attention and holds it to the very end!
281;This movie tried to be funny.
282;fancy restaurants, luxury apartments, limos, cosmetics and the rest.
283;most good movies have a beginning, a middle and an end.
284;many of the scenes insulted the viewer's intelligence.
285;Absolutely one of my favorite movies.
286;A satire of the yuppie culture and life in the 80's, American Psycho is a cross between a comedy and a horror movie.
287;A real thinking movie, you will probably have to watch it twice, but you won't mind.
288;Why do you think movies like this rarely cross the 10 million box office mark, while Big Daddy and Wild Wild West easily cross the 100 million mark.
289;American Psycho is highly entertaining the whole way through, hysterically funny most of the way through and Ultra.
290;See it, don't be swayed by anything you hear, see it and make up your own mind.
291;Great fun watching this film again, yes some folks will complain that it is not perfect like they are, but it is a fun show to re.
292;This is another one that the movie was as good as the book.
293;You just gotta see it.
294;this film is so Hitchcock.
295;christian Bale gives a great performance of elitist Ivy League scum.
296;ultimately this is Bale's breakthrough,defining performance.
297;best when viewed after dinner, while sipping wine, about 11pm.
298;ish, with a significant other.
299;For me, this is Christian Bale's definitive performance.
300;He embodies Patrick Bateman perfectly, and this was one of the rare times that I have enjoyed a movie more than the book.
301;Grim, gruesome, and delightfully psychotic, highly recommended if your tolerance level for gore and horror is high.
302;If not don't bother, it should be replaced with something else worth watching.
303;This is a great movie first of all.
304;So much clearer and brighter, very nicely redone.
305;Mr. Lewis, as I understand it, wasn't very pleased over the movie's use of his music and actually tried taking the filmmakers to court.
306;It was shot for half the budget of this one and is far superior.
307;Although I do not recommend this movie to anyone who is still somewhat sensitive to violence in movies, both the entertainment and philosophical value of this movie makes this film a very worthwhile use of time.
308;Bateman's intense daily routine of hygiene and the fierce competition between businessmen over business cards are just two examples of the both hilarious eccentricities of the characters in the film and the dark result of a lifetime characterized by ambition and vanity.
309;This film brings up interesting points about the interchangeability of human beings in modern culture.
310;Bateman's decent into insanity leads wonderfully into the very fulfill climax.
311;The conclusion of this movie will leave questioning what happened you just saw and scared of who the people around you might really be.
312;sexy main actor with good story line, keeps interest with the plot line and the ways the actors interact with each other
313;I had seen the movie many years ago and wanted to watch it again .
314;This is one of my favorite movies.
315;Christian Bale gives a convincing, chilling, dead on performance of Patrick Bateman.
316;Overall it is a great movie (i also suggest the book) with comic relief from the disturbing killing scenes, and I highly recommend it!
317;This is such a good movie a cult classic dark comedy don't go in thinking its a horror if you do you are not going to enjoy it and for a great price 5/5 stars
318;I'm keeping my eye peeled for the next film Christian Bale makes as he is an actor who could do marvelous work in the years ahead.
319;This film is very intelligent, underplayed, and well done.
320;As a satire of the 80s, I think that this film works somewhat well.
321;As a portrait of a sadistic sociopath, this film works much better.
322;Eerily, all the men in this movie do look alike, with slicked back hair and immaculate designer suits.
323;there are moments of sheer terror in this film.
324;the biggest questions I had after viewing this compelling film were: did the murders actually happen, or is this merely Patrick's imagination??
325;After having read the book and watched it a couple other times, I got all of the subtle undertones in the movies.
326;An excellent thriller to watch if you're OK with sex scenes, bloody murder and drug use.
327;I loved this movie so much.
328;I thought that the acting was really good.
329;Since seeing this movie I have an appreciation for this actor's work.
330;I have it now and love it.
331;It's quite a movie to see!
332;I do NOT understand why people love this movie!
333;He is engaged to a woman (played by Reese Witherspoon) who sees men in the same way he sees women, which is convenient for a while but eventually results in a rupture of the relationship.
334;he is hyper competitive and overly sensitive to the trappings of success.
335;We are given considerable hints throughout the film that his murders are figments of his imagination.
336;the film is actually very good and unfortunately misunderstood and underestimated by most viewers.
337;The way the yuppie lifestyle is portrayed is pure genius and great performances by all especially Bale and Defoe make this film a wonderful black comedy.
338;This movie may be criticsized for making people insensitive to murder and somehow glamourizing serial killings but this glamourization is essential in capturing the sociopathic nature of the character in such an egocentric time in America's history.
339;Side note: For an even deeper disection of the mind of the yuppie serial killer read the novel American Psycho, you wont be able to put it down.
340;this movie is a satirical look at yuppie Wall Street America.
341;Bateman does have an unsquenchable bloodlust lingering beneath his pristine corporate image.
342;And yes, there is a strong hint that if you love Huey Lewis, Phil Collins, Robert Palmer, and Whitney Houston, you're crazy too.
343;It also leaves unanswered questions that are fun to contemplate.
344;I give it a big thumbs up.
345;Despite its title and a considerable amount of bloodshed, American Psycho is a superbly witty and satirical film.
346;patrick Bateman is a twenty.
347;In a notable scene, Bateman brings two call girls to his apartment and commands them to debase themselves in front of him.
348;While serial killing is certainly a grizzly subject, it is a more a device and a motif than a theme in this movie.
349;In a wonderful way, the film goes out of its way to assure us that its concerned with satire, and a social critique not with simulating brutality.
350;I would actually give it 2.1/2 stars, but I had to round up
351;Watch something else for real.
352;American Pscyho is the most terrifying novel I have read.
353;I love this film, It's one of those I watch over and over again.
354;I find myself still laughing at some scenes.
355;amazing movie that really makes you think introspectively.
356;Seemed more like a dream.
357;The acting was pretty good.
358;Christian Bale is wild AND crazy in this role about a rich neurotic in the big city.
359;The movie keeps your eyes wide open and keeps you guessing right up to the end.
360;it's one of those movies you'll think about after you turn off the TV.
361;After seeing this movie the day it came out, I was very impressed.
362;The directing by Mary Harron is absoultely amazing, she really made the book come to life in this thriller.
363;The movie goes through twists and turns and I recommend anyone this movie if you like thinking while watching movies.
364;Pat Bateman, portrade by Christian Bale is the main character throughout the movie there are many monologues which are absoultely beautiful and make the movie no doubt.
365;So if you like a moview that twists and turns and has a high shock value this is the movie for you.
366;if the above quote made you chuckle, then this movie is for you.
367;Christian Bale gives a great performance as normal guy by day and psycho by night.
368;Great acting and plot, very dark and funny.
369;And despite the best efforts from civilization in general to neuter them that aggression still has to go someplace.
370;The film is a big punch in the face to the egotistical businessmen of the 1980's.
371;This particular Gordon Gekko is overdone and overacted by Christian Bale in a great performance.
372;He is the kind of guy who will have a 3 some with prostitutes just so that he can admire himself in the mirror doing so (all the while flexing his biceps).
373;the film is a great success.
374;As a horror movie villain Patrick has one of the most compelling backstories ever.
375;Every scene has great energy to it and even though Bale looks a little out of place his acting is so good you can't stop watching him.
376;No words can describe how amazing this movie is besides the words you ate reading right now in your screen.
377;I have also read the novel, by Ellis.
378;First let me say that the film is both a brilliant adaptation of the novel as well as being only a pale shadow of it.
379;The adaptation was brilliant in that it adapted the most significant parts of the novel in terms of theme, rather than turning the film into a gore fest.
380;I think that often the real meaning of the book and the film go unnoticed.
381;Yes, it is a brilliant film in terms of cinematography and plot, but what does it all mean?
382;I think this film has a great deal to say about alienation, about the emptiness of modern life.
383;But it stands as an important commentary, a very valuable film.
384;and, if you have any doubts, just seeing Christian Bale's performance is worth the entire film.
385;This is one of the greatest performances on film I have ever seen.
386;Wow this is one crazy movie.
387;One has to be better than the next, and higher up is where they all strive to be.
388;this movie is very good if you like suspense thrillers.
389;It's very well done, and Bale gives a very compelling performance.
390;i call it Yuppieville.5* rating, it has all the elements of a great thriller.
391;Would not recommend it to anyone.
392;And I really like Christian Bale
393;Yuppies, testosterone, and high camp.
394;It zeroes in on the easiest of targets, and delights in skewering the yuppie life.
395;skimmed surfaces, making very easily made points, and getting very obvious and easy laughs.
396;i was surprised at how much fun I had while watching the film, knowing what a watered down compromise it is.
397;another big reason for enjoying it all so much is Christian Bale.
398;Now Bale hardly looks like an average New Yorker as Patrick Bateman but I found the performance very entertaining.
399;patrick Bateman is an extremely successful business man, his dad is a major stockholder so he's got job security and so is bored and easily distracted.
400;He must keep fit and look good and employs an exacting ritual involving soaps, creams, facial masks and herbal lotions to make sure he looks his best every day.
401;He works out obsessively, sometimes while watching The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
402;It's a film about style, made with some flair and it feels fresher than it has any right to.
403;If something gets through to him, touches him, or exposes something vulnerable,.
404;She finds a sweetness within her character that humanizes and warms every scene she's in.
405;She finds a fascinating balance of fear, vulnerability, need and self.
406;loathing in her portrayal and makes a lasting impression though her screen time is short.
407;There's a great buildup in this movie that doesn't get released.
408;I have managed to see this movie twice now.
409;centered to the point of being able to mistake one person for another is mind blowing.
410;some people have stated that the chainsaw scene is one of the best parts of the movie.
411;It keeps the essence, and wit, and sarcasm of the book, while adding a level of elegance and sophistication that was completely unexpected.
412;Add the absolutely flawless (not a term I would ever use lightly) performance of Christian Bale, and you have a near perfect picture.
413;But when you watch a movie, you have to realize that it's a form of art and entertainment all it's own.
414;You need to disconnect the book and the film, the two separate art forms, and enjoy it for what it is: Brilliant.
415;Thanks to those who do this.
416;The rest of it was great.
417;Most of the movie looked very high.
418;I selected the DTS, and it was very good, although the movie didn't have a whole lot of surround sound.
419;I envied this movie, it was very gruesome, but it was good.
420;It was a good suspense.
421;American Psycho may well be one of the most misunderstood films in recent history.
422;The central character, Patrick Batemen (played by the brilliant Christian Bale), epitomizes emptiness, something he himself knows.
423;It's hard to imagine an actor more perfect for this role than Christian Bale, who finally got a chance to show off his chops in AP.
424;It's equally hard to believe Bale is actually British, as his accent is so flawlessly perfect.
425;(He's also quite easy on the eyes, which certainly doesn't hurt.)
426;American Psycho is one of those films you can watch over and over, and continually see new things.
427;Every frame seems to have been carefully designed, and the visuals are stunning.
428;The apartment, like many other images in the film, speaks volumes.
429;It's entertaining, hilariously and frighteningly funny, and powerfully thought.
430;I believe American Psycho is one of the greatest films of the latter half of the 20th century, and will be considered so, if only in retrospect.
431;See it expecting greatness, and, guaranteed, you'll find it.
432;definitely not family friendly but good for a movie that makes you go hmmmm
433;but, I feel they did a good job of capturing the sardonic wit and social commentary from the book, and putting it on celluloid.
434;Following a great introduction and wonderfully controlled plot development, this movie ends with a fizzle.
435;a big thank you to the production team on this movie for not making it the bloodbath it might have been.
436;And she did a wonderful job.
437;to the novel by Robert Bloch on which it was based and you can immediately see a parallel.
438;And we are lucky sometimes to have movie directors capable of reworking them and creating art.
439;the actor, Christian Bale, is phenomenal in this movie.
440;Here he plays the title character perfectly.
441;the rest of the cast is excellent.
442;And I am once again pleased to see the beautiful Chloe Sevigny.
443;This movie is actually pretty good.
444;Watching Christian Bale try not to kill his assistant that he ask asked on a date is quite entertaining.
445;This movie adaptation of the classic Bret Easton Ellis book is a very cool take on American culter in the 80's, and on serial killers.
446;Funny, at times scary, and full of thrills and a twist, this movie has it all.
447;Christian Bale was excellent and with good reason made this a breakthrough role for him.
448;Worth any price you pay to see this.
449;The music of this film is just excellent, nostalgic, good memories.
450;I thought it was the best movie i have ever seen.
451;truly a great film by an excellent actor.
452;I have the movie ,I hope its better.
453;I have NO IDEA why it got so many positive reviews!
454;which sucks because some great people were in it that I love.
455;Worth a watch for sure!
456;i recommend this movie to everyone over the age of 21.
457;I've now seen it upwards of 30 times, and I love it more and more with each viewing.
458;i think the category it best fits into would be a dark comedy.
459;The more you see it, the more you notice every nuance of every character, with Christian Bale's portrail of Patrick Bateman being the undisputed masterpiece of the film.
460;He brings a witty and amusing, yet still scary edge to Bateman.
461;This is one of the best performances I have seen by an actor in a movie.
462;This movie is definitely a must see there's no doubt about it.
463;Bale has always been great at getting inside of the character and showing what the character is made of.
464;All in all it was a fun romp.
465;ray if I ever manage to bring myself to go all next gen. i'd write more, but I have some videos I need to return.
466;This movie is just amazing it's best performance from Christian bale and he just did it amazing it's chilling and makes you think about your life
467;I love suspense and horror films, and I thought with the actors cast in this film it would be great.
468;I had to have it, I'm one of those people with a great collection, and building, of the WELL MADE bizarre and thrilling movies.
469;Love it every time I watch it!
470;I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys this genre!
471;If you love the 80s, you're going to enjoy this flick!!!!
472;Wonderful movie, one of Christian Bale's best.
473;bateman represents the embodiment of what a successful young, single, white yuppie living in the 80's in upper class New York would do in any given day.
474;"He's the product that Michael Douglas in ""Wall Street"" would love."
475;Highly recommended, even though you just get a few more seconds of simulated sex.
476;Obsessed with success, sex, and into drugs, Patrick Batemen works on Wall Street by day and plays serial killer by night.
477;At the end, Batemen's lawyer tells him that Paul is alive and that he has seen him in London.
478;For example, Batemen tells several people, I have to return videos to the store.
479;a movie should stand on its own.
480;Christain Bale gives an outstanding performance as the lead in this thaut pschological thriller.
481;without giving away the story line anymore than the title this movie really gets into the mind of a psychopath.
482;In this flashy, stylish and yet somehow still laudably low.
483;key adaptation of a novel once thought unfilmable, Christian Bale does a superb job of embodying a self.
484;Bale trades his native Welsh accent for a polished snooty high society American one, and his comedic narcissism is refreshing in comparison with how so many other actors would have played this daunting role.
485;What has never been removed is the dark humor and blistering satire that skewers the late 1980's love of excess.
486;Fine performances abound in American Psycho, from the always magnificent Willem Dafoe, to Reese Witherspoon as Patrick's bubble.
487;The reason I say this is because, although the novel was over the top in the effect that it really pushed it's limits it still held a ring of truth behind the insanity that caused you to shiver at the sight of your own shadow.
488;It's reputation is what makes it so brilliant.
489;The novel as a whole delivers wonderfully, while this adaptation left me cold and feeling a little betrayed.
490;Bale is a brilliant actor, and did very well with his wit and charm, but the script as a whole failed to bring the full effect that Ellis' novel brought to the table.
491;Cool movie with wry subtleties at every turn.
492;Anyway, I really enjoyed this movie (which if you don't know is based on the novel of the same name).
493;, a handsome young businessman in the world of fast.
494;In the novel it covers this.
495;, it's also a savagely funny satire on consumer culture and the general gluttony that is our country.
496;Probably the most frightening aspect is the fact that he fits in so well.
497;It's the way it holds a mirror to us and forces some self.
498;something alot of us are very resistant to.
499;In the end it's a totally refreshing expierence, a movie that's actually not afraid to be original.
500;And it's nice to see, especially given the poor Seven.
501;As a psychological thriller there are none better.
502;As a gere film it's among the best of it's kind.
503;In short it's the best film of the early 21st century and one of my all time favorites.
504;era New York, that makes it seem so alien.
505;It'd have been interesting to see if he could have made such sophisticated art house fare fly with mainstream American.
506;But at the same time he would have deprived us of one of the best performances I can remember, ever!
507;He's always acting, which is an important component to the performance because Bateman is acting himself, just trying to fit in.
508;I'm not sure if this was intentional on Dafoe's part but it adds to an already layered cast of characters.
509;cheek moments that manages to be both terrifying and funny at the same time.
510;Equal helpings of pop culture, comedy and horror.
511;I haven't read the Bret Easton Ellis novel but what is certain is that literature allows a lot of liberties cinema simply can not translate in images unless you are Jean.
512;I think the scene where he chops Jared Leto up is the actor's undisputed masterpiece.
513;It's an epic meditation on intangibility.
514;Watch the brilliant ensemble acting of Witherspoon, Mathis and Dafoe.
515;In terms of thespian craftsmanship, the sheer delivery, this movie hits a new peak of professionalism.
516;The scene is extremely uplifting.
517;The lines are as positive and affirmative as anything I've heard in movies.
518;Christian Bale's solo career seems to be more commercial and therefore more satisfying, in a narrower way.
519;But I also think Christian Bale works best within the confines of this movie than as a solo artist, and I stress the word artist.
520;This is American Psycho, a great, great movie.
521;He wants to fit in, our Patrick, but you know, a man's got to have hobbies.
522;"Norman Bates said it perfectly when he noted ""we all go a little crazy sometimes""."
523;But Jesus, a man's got to.you know.
524;"Then I heard Mary Harron was helming it, and I sighed with bliss: Harron's ""I Shot Andy Warhol"" was a kind of cinematic kindred spirit to American Psycho, both delving into the mental states of complete gibbering lunatics no one took seriously."
525;a practical GQ fashion and hygiene expert, I might add!
526;He's a great authority on Huey Lewis and the News, which you can hear on his state.
527;He keeps his skin nice and taut and rosy with all sorts of unguents and admixtures.
528;He has a great tan, compliments of his little tanning sarcophagus.
529;He hits the club scene and comes home with dinner, dinner that talks and thinks and hopes.
530;harron takes liberties with Ellis's material, but captures the essentials like a champ.
531;ridden heart of High Society.
532;his campy smile, his goofy voice, his off.
533;and expertly directed a must own.
534;Bret Easton Ellis' satire of the Reagan Age is ultimately as subtle as a smart.
535;At first I thought it was odd that Amazon released this movie to Prime at Christmastime, but I wonder if this black satire is rather perfect for the holiday season after all.
536;Ellis is a moralist of the highest order.
537;Bale's beauty regimen, involving physical workouts, facial peels, and sundry exfoliating gels that require a person to spend 30 minutes in the shower, is all the more hilarious because it's hardly an exaggeration for some folks out there.
538;But these are cavils in what is an otherwise good time at the movies.
539;Like the often misunderstood novel, the film is more of a dark social comedy than a real horror story.
540;casting Christian Bale was a brilliant choice by director Mary Harron, who almost got fired from the project because of not choosing Leonardo DiCaprio for the starring role.
541;brained Evelyn, who's engaged to Bateman but knows nothing of his psychotic, homicidal behavior, was a perfect choice.
542;"And his philosophical ramblings about the music of Huey Lewis and the News, Phil Collins, and Whitney Huston are hysterical!The new ""Killer Collector's Edition"" is a mixed bag as far as worthwhile special features go."
543;My favorite special feature (and probably the main reason why you should by this edition) is the director's commentary which tells lots of entertaining behind the scenes info.
544;And before you judge or even watch this movie, you should read Ellis' novel to appreciate the whole, uncensored story.
545;I like to dissect girls.
546;Christian Bale is great as a very disturbed man living in New York city.
547;The movie leaves it up to you.
548;flick and a Comedy, all meshed into one.
549;As I also mentioned, it's also a comedy.
550;I laughed my ass of in some scenes, and so will you, probably.
551;well, anyways, this is a very entertaining flick, and I really recommend the Unrated version of it.
552;I don't know if Mr. Bale wants to forget this movie as a youthful indescretion, but in fact it is a remarkable performance in a movie that feeds off our obsession with violent human behavior.
553;An energetic and committed performance and some cleverness throughout make this a mildly entertaining experience.
554;Harron's approach doesn't strike the balance between psychological horror and biting satire very well.
555;American Psycho is an amazing film.
556;Chloe Sevigny is also spectacular.
557;Overall, a delightful film that I still love watching again and again.
558;Christain Bale gives a rare performance as Patrick Bateman, a business suit.
559;This is a performance of true power and wit and Bale throws himself into the role without a hint of self.
560;It all adds up to an extremely funny film for those who appreciate this type of satire.
561;Director Mary Harron creates a beautiful film given it's subject matter and it looks like it cost millions more then it did to make.
562;read each other's motives) and you have a film that's as entertaining as it is thought.
563;It will stay with you for days.
564;And that's a good thing.
565;Despite the film being silly, corny and at times STUPID, I must admit it was a bit entertaining.
566;Still, I would not really recommend it to anyone who has read the novel.
567;But feel free to take a chance.
568;made it right on time.
569;While American Psycho may seem a little dated now, it is still right on the money when it comes to corporate America's greed, corruption and materialism.
570;The surreal nature of the film brings it to a higher level than your run of the mill social commentary.
571;conformist who appreciates cutting wit.
572;this movie is pretty funny actually in its own way, i mean look at the picture he has an axe with a suit on and a funny smile.
573;its worth owning, if u like horror movies as much as i do u'll find it funny too.
574;I usually pride myself on being able to understand a movie absolutely with one viewing.
575;I'm a former English Literature major and I simply assumed that I had developed my ability to pick up on all the standard movie conventions to a relatively sophisticated level.
576;I watched it again and realized to my untter astonishment that American Psycho is a witty, piercing satire, sometimes hilarious, sometimes terrifying, and always brilliant.
577;The best way to describe the movie is Fight Club with no pulled punches.
578;But that is why American Psycho is brilliant, it puts a magnifying glass on a part of society we overlook and brings it into its horrific focus using primarilly the ideas that the society espouses itself.
579;The film is a tremendous artistic achievement and it is important that audiences don't give up on it too soon.
580;this is an interesting, if a bit over the top, portrait of a psychopath gone bananas.
581;This is a slasher film that will appeal equally to heartlanders on a date night, and to those blue coasters who need a little titillation.
582;personally, I don't usually watch slasher films, being above that kind of stuff, but this is stylishly done.
583;is a TOTALLY INACCURATE portrait of a true psycho.
584;"I mean he tosses it down the stairwell so that it crashes on the floor from how many stories above, and it still works so he can use it on ""Christie""?"
585;notice too that the ending allows for a sequel, yet has all the trappings of an ending.
586;And when you turn off the set and go to bed you realize that nothing in your life is so extreme and nothing in your life is really that far gone, and yet you have experienced vicariously an extreme emotion, and as a bonus you can feel superior to those Ivy League sickos.
587;It is as slick as slick can be, thoroughly engrossing with fine acting from especially Christian Bale who plays Bateman.
588;The direction is as tight as a well.
589;strung banjo, the script nearly hypnotic in its seductive power, the New York ultra hip sets eye.
590;like satirical commentary, which (on a third level) parodies the genre, is very funny.
591;I liked this touch because I have known a few non.
592;The only thing that saves this movie at all is Christian Bale's performance which is sufficiently over the top to turn the movie into the satire, I believe, it was meant to be.
593;Christan Bale is one of my favorite actors and even though many conisder his work in Empire Of The Sun to be his breakthrough performance for me it's all about American Psycho.
594;American Psycho was clearly one of the best movies released in the year 2000.
595;The film is a thinking person horror movie and has humor and one of the best portyals of a serial killer in recent years.
596;Mary Harron direction is very good and the performance by Christan Bale is top notch.
597;I highly reccomned American Psycho .
598;This movie was extremely good for its witty humor, dark plot and amazing soundtrack.
599;While I agree that Harron and Turner's adaptation of Ellis' dialogue and themes is masterful, the subsequent presentation borders on the mundane.
600;This movie is probably one of the best horror films I have ever seen.
601;It is so beautifully filmed and shows how one mans success and obsession with being perfect drives him mentally mad.
602;I especially love the scene where bale pulls the facial mask off his face.
603;This shows the audience that there are two sides to this character.
604;This is bales best performance in my mind(kudos to machinist).
605;The dirt is noticeable and does get your attention in several scenes.
606;aQ was perfect for this film.
607;i have listened to both commentary tracks and liked both.
608;It was still very nice to hear what she had to say about some of the most memorable scenes.
609;The movie version of American Psycho , on the other hand, is a cleverly drawn social satire, choosing black comedy over graphic violence to make its point.
610;The movie is closer in spirit to the similar Jules Feiffer.
611;The core subject matter is so dark and despairing that the occasional laugh.
612;loud scenes are quite welcome when they occur.
613;christian Bale does an admirable job portraying Charles Manson as a Yuppie.
614;Those who think Bale is too pretty and smart to play a serial killer should remember that Ted Bundy was considered an attractive,charming and intelligent person in casual social situations!
615;Its a full on dark comedy, with some social commentary.
616;The music theme is hilarious.
617;Every bit of writing is executed wonderfully.
618;Take or leave it, but well actually i don't care this is just my oppinion.
619;It did showcase the 80's well.
620;At least one gets ones moneys worth.
621;Music in the movie is good.
622;Twisted sense of humor helps make this a good movie.
623;It actually makes fun of itself (the scene where Bateman shoots and blows up the cop car, and he stares at the gun, for example).
624;I happen to love this movie!
625;But, that doesn't mean a cult classic is actually a good movie.
626;As long as you don't take the movie seriously, you will definitely love it.
627;UMD is all the better because you can bring it places.
628;I do not recommend this film to anyone who is looking for a film with a good plot, good acting, and attention keeping drama.
629;Christian Bale is a fantastic actor, so it was truly unfortunate to see him cast in such a horrible movie with a terrible story line.
630;There has to be a motive, or a point ultimately made in the ending, that satisfies me well enough to have understood why the killer does what he or she does.
631;Then, it's a good movie.
632;This contempt he holds for everyone in his life, known or unknown, is the cause of his mental snaps, which leads him to commit one heinous act after another.
633;I admire a movie maker who can look society straight in the eye and basically say, Hey, this is a movie.
634;This is one of those movies, and for that, I give it credit.
635;while the subject matter of the movie is not the greatest I've ever seen, the actors do a terrific job in their roles.
636;Christian Bale is a standout as Patrick Bateman, and plays out the egotistical maniac role quite well.
637;He is the film, basically.
638;He is able to somewhat keep the movie together in certain places where it is needed.
639;what a wild in your face dark comedy about the excess of the 80's lifestyle.
640;Bale is excellent at depicting a character who has become so shallow and empty that he rebels in his American Psycho way.
641;Bale is so slick and so wired in his extremes in behaviour and his voice over dialogues are performed to perfection.
642;It is so subversively witty .
643;Other performances are great here too: dafoe, mathis, leto, and Chloe Sevigny who is the only one who can actually steal her scenes away from Bale.
644;The only thing good about American Psycho was Christian Bale's wonderful portrayal of the twisted Patrick Bateman.
645;Christian Bale at his best.
646;cited satire is played in a ham.
647;Anyone seeking for an amazing adventure would love this movie.
648;This movie was brilliant, and you have to think to understand this.
649;If combined with Wall Street, a great double feature!!
650;It's interesting and intriguing and a good critique of the materialism and egotism in our society.
651;provoking, funny, and disturbing all at one.
652;Christian Bale gives a great performance.
653;At first I was put off by the violence, but came to realize this movie is probably the best commentary on the 1980's era and the attitudes of the 1%ers since then.
654;The Bateman attitude towards others continues to this day by those in power and those that stand in the shadows behind them.
655;This movie is not for the faint of heart or squeamish, but it is an unflinching look at our values as a country and culture, and where we'd rather not look.
656;This film is stylistically and visually stunning.
657;from the casting, sets, mood, cinematography, lighting, acting, everything is superb.
658;this is the film that propelled Christian Bale's career and you can see why.
659;Handsome with an immaculate body yet pulsing with menace.
660;He manages to project the subdued brutality necessary for the part while relying on very few tricks.
661;the mark of a great film to me is one that seems to breathe with its own life.
662;That is an excellent description of the world American Psycho inhabits.
663;It is simply an excellent piece of filmmaking.
664;Patrick Bateman is one of the best.
665;written characters I've ever seen.
666;He's clearly so dark and twisted, yet he has a very convincing and charming facade.
667;Other than that, and some other general weirdness aside, I definitely recommend it.
668;This movie is all kinds of wonderful from the food descriptions to Justin Theroux looking impeccable to the FANTASTIC comprehension gap between Chloe Sevigny in Patrick Bateman's apartamento (at last) and what Patrick Bateman really thinks and feels about her.
669;this movie is so perfect that it is a wonder that the director didn't go on to do more .
670;this is on par with the direction and end result of Silence of the Lambs.
671;But what really makes it work is Christian Bale, who is utterly perfect as the titular American psycho.
672;Every smile, snarl and twitch from this man is utterly perfect.
673;patrick Bateman (Bale) is the perfect yuppie .
674;paying job and a beautiful fiancee (Reese Witherspoon).
675;He dines at all the best restaurants and goes to the best clubs.
676;He keeps his body, New York apartment and wardrobe in perfect condition, and gives detailed descriptions of his designer clothes, beauty products and music collection.
677;She starts the story off relatively quietly, following Bateman around his everyday life .
678;christian Bale is scarily brilliant in this role, in the way that only the best actors can be.
679;Reportedly he based his performance on Tom Cruise, and I can see that .
680;Bateman greets the world with a friendly voice and a shiny smile.
681;American Psycho is wickedly funny, surreal and gruesome .
682;and Christian Bale is utterly sublime as a psycho that nobody seems to recognize.
683;the movie delves into the mind of a true sociopath and the modern world in which he lives in.
684;brilliant acting performances by all the cast especially christian bale.
685;overall,a great movie which could be enjoyed if you have a true understanding of all the underlying themes in this movie.
686;The attitude of the movie is sarcastic and mostly humorous.
687;The actors do a good job of following the look and feel of the movie.
688;The movie may contain a lot of poking around, but the focus is definitely on the psychological aspect of Bateman.
689;that brings us to the intellectual aspect of it.
690;I find two real connections myself.
691;"Much like the Mel Gibson flick ""Payback,"" the movie is full of unscrupulous characters, including the protagonist."
692;I liked this movie before i bought it.
693;It's not for everyone, but it is a great christian bale movie.
694;They sure changed the flavor of the book that I read!
695;Although the acting performances were excellent when judged on their own merit .
696;and keep your mental images intact!
697;It's really, really funny if it is not taken as a thriller or serious commentary.
698;It will blowv up your mind face.
699;** REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS **In the beginning, I found this movie compelling to watch.
700;cleansed, smooth skin to match.
701;This movie also pokes fun at the artificialness of yuppies.
702;I really think I love this movie.
703;Over all, movie is good with great replay value.
704;We see the films we love or despise in our own unique ways.
705;I strongly encourage you, from one Ellis lover to another, hold off.
706;now everyone has their own interpretation of Ellis' masterpiece, some take the novel very seriously, and compare it to some of the finest novels of our time, others, like Norman Mailer for instance, compare his writing style to that of Dostoyevski, and the reader can think it's a farce from the getgo with the satirical portrayal of Manhattan in the 80's and the stink, stank, stunk of the city that everyone knows 'how filthy it really is'.
707;Ellis' amazing eye to detail in the murder scenes, and the exceptional tools he uses to craft out his work, is sheer brilliance.
708;Jean is a very important role, and at times I find, at least in the book, that Pat's feelings for Jean he stating he may eventually marry her, are quite genuine.
709;In the Yale Club at that exact moment he would love to just cold out murder Luis and watch his blood drain from his body, that in all surreal innuendo, is freakin brilliant.
710;It's human emotion, hate is an emotion.
711;"in contrast, and to close, Christian Bale is a brilliant actor, his role as young Jim in Spielberg's ""Empire of the Sun"" is one of the most brilliant performances in cinema, and he did a fine job playing often emotionless and dead on 'mentally deranged' Pat Bateman."
712;One was I love Chritian Bale.
713;first I will review the movie to people who have not read the book and then I will review it to those who have.
714;The killer happens to be a rich, young, good looking wallstreet executive.
715;This is also a black comedy, with some of the funniest lines you'll ever hear.
716;It is also a period movie with meticulous details to the mid to late 1980's.
717;This is one of the few times we see Patrick as close to human.
718;"Which also has the best ""twist"" of the book with her new boyfriend being the head chef at ""Dorsia"", that illusive and chic resteraunt he can never get a reservation for."
719;That buildup in the book was really important.
720;In the book he is young, attractive and dresses as well as Patrick.
721;if you havent read the book then you should still see the movie.
722;If you like Christian Bale you will see him in a whole new light.
723;But its still entertaining and a good converstation will happen after you watch it with someone.
724;hope to do business with you in the future.
725;Great book Classic movie makes you think how many people are really like this .
726;This movie is a wonderful satire on consumer excess, and the illusion of having it all .
727;Christian Bale is chillingly terrifying in the lead role.
728;together move, and Christian Bale is perfect as Patrick Bateman.
729;(There are many other movies that accurately show Bale's fine physique and acting skills besides this one!)
730;Many people in the audience thought this scene was one of the funniest parts of the movie, but I felt that it was shocking and offensive.
731;American Psycho may be considered by some to be director Mary Harron's crowning achievement, since it covers the challenging territory of a killer's mind .
732;It was around three years ago when I first saw this movie, and I loved it.
733;christian Bale's performance was fantastic.
734;I honestly couldn't think of anyone else more suited to the part.
735;He looks, talks and acts precisely as he should and his entire character was believable.
736;this film is amusing, although I wasn't sure whether it was supposed to be or not!
737;I love the way that Patrick Bateman talks about music and morality as he openly prepares to kill his latest victim, and they don't even notice.
738;It's really insightful and very well researched.
739;this movie has some slightly shocking moments, but these become quite funny the second time you watch because you already know what's going to happen, and you can appreciate it's rather morbid comedy value.
740;and for the most part, she got it right.
741;To begin American Psycho I believe is in the class of film, in which every scene is perfectly shot and arranged.
742;Despite what they may say this film is pure art.
743;Its meaning is not clearly defined, every viewing is a potentially new experience all together.
744;Visually the film is amazing, with haunting backdrops of new york city.
745;This is one of the best commentaries on the 80's and best performances by Christian Bale
746;This has to be one of my favorite movies of the early 00s.
747;If you aren't afraid of the envelope being pushed, definitely give this a chance.
748;Also, great use of music!
749;It is a well plotted film, and since being a huge fan of the book, I thought this movie hit the book like a hammer on a nail.
750;Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is smart, intelligent, rich, and lives the life that most people can only dream of.
751;He is everything I thought of Patrick Bateman in the book.
752;"So there are times where he does talk to his fiancee Evelyn (Reese Witherspoon, which I think she tried a little to hard during the upsetting parts in the film), and he is always mistakn for someone who works wirh him since they all look alike
753;In all, the movie was beautifully described and tell told.
754;Watching American Psycho was one of the most unnerving cinematic experiences I've ever been through (the 1997 German.
755;A satire of the materialism and the me.
756;Not one male character in the film is depicted in a positive way.
757;Watch with a critical mind.
758;Christian Bale is the best actor though and he was spot on for an antisocial/ borderline psychotic individual with hallucinations and delusional behavior.
759;In a tale based on a best.
760;Bateman is a successful and financially well off New York corporate suit and tie who hangs around with other shallow and plastic carbon copies of himself.
761;It is quite stunning in its brutal shallowness.
762;Is this a good movie worth your time?
763;This is a black comedy done to perfection.
764;Once in awhile a film comes along that exceeds all expectations, and this is that movie.
765;It is entertaining on so many levels.
766;The storyline takes you back to the materialistic 80's, Regan era and makes you laugh out loud.
767;Christian Bale's performance of Patrick Bateman is flawless.
768;Patrick Bateman is a sadistic, good looking, professional, educated, serial killer, that can hold down a brilliant conversation about his seemingly very caring views on world affairs.
769;a cinematic and novelistic leitmotif.
770;the film is surprisingly non.
771;DiCaprio's slender, unthreatening frame and distinctive facial beauty would have made it impossible either to fear him or to mistake him for others, as constantly happens in the plot of both the novel and the film.
772;harron chose Christian Bale well as a physical presence.
773;born, and his nearly perfect face is oddly forgettable.
774;range, one has the sense of seeing something obliquely, as if part of his face were constantly obscured, or faceted ever so slightly out of the line of vision.
775;The more conflicted, intelligent, 'deeper' Bateman which Ellis so carefully constructs as a sort of human 'cautionary tale' ends up as something like the evil twin of Christian Bale's smirking, guffawing incarnation.
776;It's hilarious, comedic and dark, ominous and zany.
777;Christian Bale puts on his best performance ever in this film.
778;Police learned during interviews and the investigation about Windom's fascination with 'AMERICAN PSYCHO' and serial killers.
779;Mary Harron's American Psycho (based on the infamous Bret Easton Ellis novel) is really quite a brilliant movie.
780;I remember liking it when I first saw it, but found it rather disturbing.
781;Watching it again, I realized what a brilliant comedy it actually is.
782;Christian Bale gives an amazing performance as Bateman the yuppie psycho.
783;Bale alone makes the film worth watching.
784;There's a very memorable scene where Bateman slaughters a coworker with an axe while discussing the music of Huey Lewis and the News.
785;Christian Bale is always believable as the meticulous, obsessive psycho.
786;Many people are bound to misunderstand it, but American Psycho is really an intelligent, razor.
787;This movie has a good plot and good cast.
788;This special edition of American Psycho was fantastic.
789;For those of you who have read the book, you will find the screenplay version .
790;which captures all of the salient parts of the story .
791;Amazing movie, i heard alot about it was very surprised and impressed on how well they made this i would recommend this be watched.
792;If you have a twisted / dark sense of humor then you must see this!
793;Not having read the book, I will take this film on its own merits.
794;American Psycho is a satirical horror film that had greater potential than was realized.
795;Part of the story was a lampoon of the excessive materialism of the 1980's, focusing particularly on the yuppie lifestyle.
796;The story presented an opportunity for a fresh approach to the horror genre.
797;In addition, since it was a first person narrative, we had an opportunity to look inside the killer's head.
798;the acting by Bale was excellent.
799;The scene depicting his emotional disintegration was terrifically done and very intense.
800;It is kitsch enough for that to be a distinct possibility.
801;I believe it's his best work and he's amazing at pulling off a decent into madness in a narcissistic corporate world.
802;This slash and chop movie is so classy that it is levels above the other slasher genre.
803;in the end,this is an enjoyable movie,the acting is good,(some lines are hurried and some scenes are forced),the plot is what it is.
804;One of my favorite movies to date.
805;get inside the mind of an American Psycho!
806;The movie keeps you at the edge, not knowing what or who will be his next victim.
807;Judged by how many times I've watched it (about 10 times), this must be one of my favorite movies.
808;Those people responsible for it may have had some ideas triggered by the book, but this movie can stand on its own considerable merits.
809;Yet he is fascinating to watch and I can't help laughing hysterically at his total emptiness and delusions.
810;when he revisits the apartment where he had dead bodies hanging in every closet, the place is pristine and is for sale.
811;Obviously, because it was all in his imagination!
812;presidents whose greatest status symbols are the classiness of their business cards and where they can get dinner reservations), all of them look and act alike and they are constantly misidentifying each other.
813;It is impossible to say, which is one of the most amusing ironies of this eternally entertaining movie.
814;American Psycho is an awesome movie, no matter what anyone may say.
815;It is hard to understand, and the plot is all twisted up, but still a good movie.
816;Christian Bale does an awesome job as the main character Patrick Bateman.
817;Definetly a very controversial movie, but overall it is a very good movie to watch.
818;Okay, so we've got a gay porn Catcher, great.
819;In fact, I'm the chair of our local Libertarian Party affiliate and I devote considerable energy to fighting such governmental actions.
820;But I also realize that the other side of the freedom coin is personal responsibility, including on the part of movie.
821;As I will continue to argue myself, those watching this type of movie must be held responsible for their own actions.
822;But this is my private action.
823;it is a brilliant description of the 80s .
824;well, there was one woman, Mary Harron, who liked and respected AP so much that she decided to transform it to the screen .
825;I liked the film when I saw it first time"
826;Surprisingly restrained and funny .
827;it has one of the best scenes I've seen in the films lately .
828;the show belongs to Christian Bale .
829;and he delivers as Patrick Bateman, the rich and beautiful 26 year old Wall Street banker with the secrets so dark that he makes Dr. Lector look like a Sesame Street character.
830;Bale's cold, charismatic, misogynist turn is riveting.
831;I have to say, that the black humour was well appreciated.
832;kind of lightening up the disgusting subject matter of the movie.
833;This was a very chilling and twisted movie.
834;In the end, this was worthwhile but be prepared to ask yourself what happened and why.
835;The direction and screenplay, as well as Bale's performance, are all interesting and make for a unique film, and worthy of rewatching and discussing.
836;Rich white males are evil and viscious and killers at heart.
837;the 2 separate commentaries by Harron and Turner were very insightful.
838;The several featurettes were great.
839;I definitely recommend this movie
840;It is NOTHING like the book!
841;See the movie, then read the horrifying book and compare.
842;I love horror movies as much as the next guy.
843;I knew it would be stupid, long before I watched it, but a friend of mine told me it was funny.
844;Based on an equally disturbing book , American Psycho is a spectacular movie if you have the stomach for it .
845;It tells the story of yuppie Patrick Bateman who , along with his friends , spends the biggest part of the day worrying about what they wear , eat and listen .
846;side ( as he himself confesses in front of the mirror ) to feel alive in a way .
847;The murder scenes are absolutely abominable and can almost cause damage to a sensitive person's soul .
848;Yet it's Bale's exceptional perfomance as the sick psycho which makes this as great and breath.
849;If you love to hate the eighties, you'll eat this one up.
850;This is a parody on human behavior pushed to extremes and one of the main reason if works so immensely well is the fine performance by Christian Bale as the title character.
851;The film wisely dwells on the manner in which Patrick starts every day .
852;doing abdominal crunches and weight lifting (the resulting body Bale built is stunning eye candy!)
853;be fianc e (Reese Witherspoon) but pays little attention to her.
854;aMERICAN PSYCHO is a film that packs a wallop and Christian Bale gives a bravura performance.
855;It is becoming a cult classic and that designator is well deserved.
856;Christian Bale is perfect as the Armani and Rolex loving Patrick Bateman, who just happens to enjoy carving up people as much as he loves wearing his Oyster Perpetual Date Just Roley.
857;absorbed yuppie is a great villain with a great body to boot, and the Supporting Cast of Josh Lucas, Jared Leto, and Justin Theroux are first.
858;American Psycho manages to be funny, grotesque, and strange .
859;If you read it first, you'll catch lines, see scenes, remember things from it .
860;The one flaw in an otherwise small but interesting and valuable gem of a movie.
861;Ellis depicts a shallow world populated by yuppies obsessed with status symbols: clothing, the right job, getting in the right restaurants, etc.
862;"tune with the cultural ""ins"" and ""outs"" of the era, providing an accurate time capsule for readers."
863;Appropriately, her movie adaptation focuses in on the satirical elements.
864;Actor Christian Bale (also appears in Shaft in a somewhat similar role) deserves much of the credit for bringing the movie to life with his outstanding performance as Patrick Bateman.
865;All this is done with a pitch.
866;Ellis' novel rapidly disintegrates from its promising beginnings rooted in satire.
867;Although I think the graphic violence is highly effective in conveying Bateman's ever.
868;the movie's ending is essentially true to the book and very fitting.
869;really shows that hes got the stright sickness, and thats what makes the movie so great.
870;Alota funny parts also, definetly worth watching, .
871;I love this movie because it's a legit horror film until you try to explain the scenes to someone then you realize how funny it is.
872;The final scene is what gives it away as dark satire, He legit confesses and it's played off as a joke.
873;Really enjoy this movie, it has get the excitement and thrilling together and it doesn't look like any of Hollywood movies.
874;Bale did a great job
875;aside from the above, it was a fun film to watch.
876;Christian Bale is a pretty good Patrick.
877;Nice and always looking overwhelmed.
878;He definitely had issues .
879;Based on the Bret Easton Ellis novel of the Me Generation, Christian Bale takes us through a sometimes unsettling and always entertaing tour of the kind of self.
880;Definitely not one of Christian Bale's better movies.
881;but there's so much more to love.
882;I now watch it at least twice a month.
883;blowingly good movie IN MY OPINION with beautiful cinematography and great performances from everyone involved (Willem Dafoe's scenes are sparse but hilarious and Chloe Sevigny's character gives a quiet, poignant feel to her major scene with Bale.)
884;One of my favorite films of all time, Empire of the Sun (see my review if interested) starred a fourteen.year old Christian Bale with a heavy English accent.
885;up, hunky, and quite the convincing actor (even the accent is gone!)
886;I thought this movie was good.
887;I eventually read the book to discover that it was quite a work of art, often reminiscent of Clockwork Orange .
888;The movie adaptation is well.
889;Patrick Bateman(Bale) and his friends are obsessed with women, money, great restaurant reservations, and themselves.
890;Patrick's whole existence is identified to us by his lifestyle.
891;He is obsessed about everything from his skin care line to his business cards.
892;He is perfect and seemingly normal to his peers.
893;his obsession for cleanliness and perfection.
894;While not a perfect date movie (my own sarcastic attempt), American Psycho is sure to please if you have a good sense of humor.
895;He has done well painting the tale of a psychopath with excellent taste in food and ties.
896;This is a classic and a must own by any thriller movie fan.
897;Highly recommended to movie buffs and fans
898;Besides that, the movie is great.
899;I was expecting a solid movie and it blew away my expectations.
900;But, on the contrary, my friend!
901;The movie is absolutely hilarious!
902;The way that it is made makes it such that you'll laugh instead of being horrified.
903;The gruesome deaths are made in a way that they're actually really funny.
904;the movie is about Patrick Bateman, a rich Wall Street man who's obsessed with killing people.
905;The movie is very exciting and interesting and keeps you into it until its great ending.
906;I loved the ending and found it to be very unpredictable but makes sense.
907;I recommend this awesome movie and Christian Bale's perfromance is stunning.
908;You see the blood on Bateman's face and a body in the background but it's made comically.
909;But, the random sex scenes are perverted so I recommend just closing your eyes.
910;"Having read the novel, I knew I had to see the movie ""American Psycho"" starring Christian Bale."
911;American Psycho really is more of a psychological drama.
912;This movie is much deeper than that.
913;American Psycho is really a sharp and very humorous satire of American culture during the 1980s as well as a dark psychological drama and part thriller as well.
914;"There are certainly nihilistic overtones in ""American Psycho"" and Patrick Bateman struggles to stay in touch with reality and to make sense of himself as well as life around him."
915;It's really incredible how self.
916;centered all of the characters are in this movie which is also a theme throughout Ellis' novel.
917;The theme of the individual versus the machine of society is also developed in the novel and present in the movie.
918;In Bateman's case, it is the darker side of the human existence that dominates his life.
919;basically, Bateman lives his normal life during the day as he has a great job, a beautiful fiancee and lots of rich friends, yet, he struggles to keep his real self on the inside, but in the darkness of the night, the real Bateman comes out in an absolutely brutal, psychotic, and horrifying fashion.
920;The movie is able to relate this aspect to some extent, but obviously not like the novel.
921;This element of darkness, the unknown, the unconscious mind and psychosis are examined brilliantly inside the mind of Patrick Bateman in Bret Easton's Ellis' novel and to some extent, we get this in the movie as well, mainly because of Bale's brilliant performance.
922;While the movie doesn't quite capture the depth of the novel, the movie shines at times as well and does a competent job of relating the themes prevalent in Ellis' novel, although not nearly developed to the extent that I would like.
923;christian Bale is absolutely brilliant as Patrick Bateman, and the rest of the cast is very good as well including Reece Witherspoon.
924;The direction is good, the script is good although I think the movie could have been longer and more elaborate.
925;Indeed, I think the problem with the movie is that it is unable to capture the intricacies of the novel, and that's where the movie comes up short, but overall, the movie is pretty good.
926;"Sure, there's a horrifying element to it all that I find quite interesting, but ""American Psycho"" is also a sharp and very funny satire as well as a dark psychological drama or maybe a thriller but not really a horror movie."
927;"from a psychological drama's standpoint, ""American Psycho"" is a fine viewing for anyone interested in such an endeavor."
928;bale is brilliant in this movie.
929;Christian Bale is a genius actor, just look at him in Empire of the Sun in which he starred at the age of 13.
930;look great, sound great and the movie itself its amazing, for this price you can't complain.
931;An amazing film adapted from an excellent novel which I would recommend to everyone.
932;This may be THE American satirical work of the nineties, and has a special resonance following the ENRON and WORLDCOM sagas that ended that weird decade.
933;She needs to be spoken of in the same way as Julie Taymor whose brilliant work on Titus Andronicus should bear comparison.
934;But in terms of satire, which I believe is at the heart of the greatest comedy, only Mr Todd Solondz perhaps is a worthy contender.
935;I found the set pieces in AMERICAN PSYCHO superb, the acting pitch perfect, and the mis en scene a model of its kind.
936;Directed by Mary Harron and based on Bret Easton Ellis' novel, American Psycho is an excellent cinematic approach to various issues that have sparked constant controversy.
937;American Psycho places you right into the mind and daily routines of its villain.
938;He fully grasps and embraces his character turning it into a precise art.
939;He makes the movie worth watching solely on his performance.
940;He gives the role a dark but goofy edge, which may even cause you to laugh at some of his more vicious acts.
941;an interesting factor about Patrick Bateman is the fact that you would never suspect him of being a serial killer.
942;He's a millionaire, he has a perfect body, and he can get any girl he wants.
943;He seemingly has the perfect life one might think.
944;one of the best things this movie does as a whole is the fact that it turns a very controversial book into a very satisfying and enjoyable film.
945;It is probably best viewed for the second time as the humour relies on knowledge of the story/character.
946;In my opinion this is in my top 5 films.
947;What a wonderful movie this is!
948;The triumph of form over content portrayed with icy precision.
949;Irony itself conveys a measure of elegance.
950;Thus the movie comments on itself.
951;It's a disquisition on a decade, a perspective, a way of being that is still very much part of us today.
952;There is keen pleasure in realizing that the camera itself, more than words, is the scalpel for the irony which defines this chilly tale.
953;american Psycho is full scenes that are tough to watch.
954;Other times the film is just laugh out loud hilarious.
955;And his inability to stay connected to the world around him is a wicked delight.
956;Though his world of slick, cocaine.
957;"and emphasizes the story's taking place in the ""Me Decade"" with appropriate song and fashion that add to one's enjoyment of the film."
958;bale shines as Bateman, making us thank God the powers that be did not go with Leonardo DiCaprio as they at one point hoped to.
959;Whether he's stiff, menacing, dryly sarcastic, tortured or over the edge psychotic, Bale is mesmerizing.
960;Willem Dafoe is amiable enough as a detective investigating one of Bateman's crimes, but .
961;it's a wild ride that gets a little hazy in parts, but is certainly enjoyable in most places.
962;Christian Bale is at his best is this horrific tale of madness.
963;Definitely recommend this film for anyone who likes suspense with a healthy dose of horror.
964;The characters are masterfully played, and the film does an excellent job building the suspense, through to the surprising revelations of the main character.
965;There is absolutely no one or nothing to care about in this movie.
966;Christian Bale does a great job, there's just nothing for him to work with here.
967;These movies are much more intelligent and much better made.
968;There are actually characters to care about in these movies and the soundtracks are great to.
969;Talking about Christian Bale, his performance was Amazing !
970;He totally deserved at least an Oscar Nomination.
971;anyhow, Great acting, Great filmography, Great directing and I liked the dialog this movie is very quotable.
972;And more amazed that it worked.
973;I believe I speak for myself and many other fans.
974;He's so meticulous with every detail.
975;What a perfect specimen of the male physique.
976;Worth a look if you have the time to kill !
977;My favorite movie of all time.
978;Hands down, the best movie to watch with a girl.
979;A first date for the ages.
980;This is a very good movie!
981;Not my favorite but I absolutely love Christian Bale.
982;The movie was in perfect condition.
983;The American Dream first, which has to do with the dream of people arriving in the US and succeeding in making fortunes, or at least enough money to become the middle or upper middle class : the opera of American success and capitalism in its positive understanding.
984;this American Psycho is absolutely essential to understand modern America.
985;a great film for advanced viewers who are able to go beyond the surface of things.
986;This satiric commentary on Men and the 80s brings to life a deep roar of laughter behind a mask of disgust.
987;The violence is so strong that many readers were blinded to the sporadic humour of the piece, often laugh out loud funny.
988;Happily, the film takes all the redeeming qualities of the novel and builds on them, creating another beast entirely.
989;But most importantly the film acts as a satirical look at the cultural emptiness of the eighties, and the emptiness of Bateman.
990;This is a great film just waiting to be discovered.
991;core American Psycho fan and think it's one of the best, least known cult classic films around.
992;finish, this movie has always been one of the funniest and entertaining films in a long time.
993;witherspoon exchange in another scene is priceless.
994;I thought this was a great movie.
995;It has dark comedy in it, but it is mainly a horror movie.
996;I thought Christian Bale did a superb job as Patrick Bateman.
997;The movie was directed by Mary Herron, and was done really well.
998;'American Psycho' is about a rich businessman Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) who, during the day anyway is a charming guy, but sometimes he just wants to kill whenever he feels the urge.
999;As a avid movie fan, I must say this is one of the best PQ and AQ movie that i've seen.
1000;AMERICAN PSYCHO is an excellent movie.
1001;without giving away any details to the plot and the twists, I have to say that this movie was incredibly enjoyable.
1002;Yes, you have to have a DARK sense of humor to enjoy it.
1003;Especially brilliant is his voiceover about his morning ritual.
1004;watch this film with an open mind.
1005;5 Stars = MasterpieceSuperior black comedy on the serial killer genre!Christian Bale is superbly, darkly comedic, as the narcissistic corporate ladder climbing executive, moonlighting as a serial killer by night.
1006;As the other reviews have stated, this movie is a fine satire of consumerism and the greed of this growing yuppie culture.
1007;But it is also more than that.
1008;It is an existential view of human nature, of the emptiness and uselessness of life, of being totally, utterly, alone.
1009;He has an idea that if he cuts them up and plays with their insides, and keeps their body, that he will find something more than the superficial outside.
1010;That is when he starts with his views on music, his one connection with anything more than material.
1011;He answers because I want to fit in .
1012;"That is all he wants
1013;The brilliant ending completely twists the storyline.
1014;evoke genuine emotion in the reader/viewer/listener.
1015;the movie does a better job of capturing what Ellis was probably trying to do .
1016;The film seemed very intimate .
1017;Christian Bale's performance was excellent.
1018;Also there is an unexpected ending.
1019;goers hoping to see a film along the lines of the 6th Sense.
1020;To be sure, the film American Psycho is flawless, from the opening title to the closing credits.
1021;And the film delivers this message is a highly stylish, comical way that makes it both poignant and entertaining.
1022;but a video camera as well.
1023;Underneath the faade lies the heart of a psychopathic killer that he keeps hidden from the rest of the world.
1024;A lot of times satire is timely, but that doesn't mean that it'll remain timely into the future, so it must also have entertainment value that extends well beyond its perceived time frame.
1025;American Psycho does a great job on all of these fronts.
1026;Bale has a sixth sense for playing characters trying to keep it cool on the outside with turmoil underneath and a secret waiting to be shared with the world, but here there's a bit more levity and comedy to his performance.
1027;In particular the scene where he dispatches condescending executive Paul Allen shows his slightly more dark comedic side.
1028;Dancing around to Huey Lewis while donning a rain coat and carrying an ax, one can't help but laugh at Bale's manic energy while also questioning if they should.
1029;there's also that intensity that Bale brings to every role that is just kind of creepy disturbing.
1030;this film is brilliant in its eccentricities and its subtlety within an outrageous casing.
1031;If you haven't seen it I highly recommend that you give it a try.
1032;Whether you're a fan of Christian Bale, horror, lurid tales, or satire in general this is a must watch, and for some of you out there a must own!
1033;Great movie about NYC in the 1980s.
1034;Chritian bale plays a great psycho.
1035;Christian Bale is excellent in American Psycho.
1036;His rendition of a psycho killer is amazing"
1037;this is a must see movie for everyone.
1038;Christian Bale is a great actor and fit the role very welll.
1039;I see that some people felt the movie was sub.
1040;par and others felt it to be a Christian Bale tour.
1041;I liked American Psycho because I knew that it was a satire of American culture in the 1980's.
1042;The film delivered a satire that showed the extremes of our culture and also mocked it.
1043;I found the film to have multilayers, which is a good film in my book.
1044;Here is a man who works on Wall Street.
1045;All for the sake of feeling alive, of feeling individual, of having or making some meaning out of his life.
1046;I thought it was well done.
1047;Christian Bale turned in a fine, stilted/controlled/obsessive.
1048;I thought it was well directed and acted as well as written.
1049;watchable, and years from now some people will refer back to this film as a trendsetter, because I'm sure there will be other films that reach a wider audience that deal with the same themes touched upon here.
1050;A Great Film for some BAD Nightmares!It's A Must have Blu.
1051;Overall, a decent movie of a great book.
1052;Patrick Bateman as played by Christian Bale is a true work of art.
1053;Very true to the novel by Bret Easton Ellis.
1054;an insightful and hysterical dark comedy that demonstrates what happens to our psyches when we live in an environment of lies, greed and superficiality.
1055;the main actor christian bale does a great job portraying the serial killer patrick bateman, in a stylish performane on par with richard gere's breakout role in american gigolo.
1056;all this and a surprise ending that will keep you guessing and questioning after the movie has ended.
1057;Was hoping for something similar to the wonderful old Hitchcock Psycho.
1058;It show us rich people having fun .
1059;To quote Oliver Stone: I'm surprised that a lot of directors today find violence entertaining.
1060;You know, to shout somebody is fun, it's hip, it's cool.
1061;I love this movie, and it is impossible to be objective about it.
1062;This ambiguity is to me both a strength and a weakness.
1063;Well here we go with some originality.
1064;A comedy , or is it a satire, about the Eighties.
1065;the fact that so many talk about the laughs that broke out during the murders or the folks who go on and on about the Eighties soundtrack and clothes.
1066;I waited with anticipation to see this movie.
1067;I wanted, I really really wanted to like it, and it just sucked.
1068;the area in which American Psycho succeeds is as a black comedy.
1069;Bale does a tremendous job adding to the film's sharp comic wit.
1070;His saccarine grin and phony newscaster voice often benefit the film by making his lines quite hilarious.
1071;In fact, the scene in which Bateman kills Paul Allen after spending 5 minutes explaining the musical genius of Huey Lewis and the News is quite possibly the funniest thing I've seen in a while.
1072;This film was pretty creepy, but I really enjoyed it.
1073;I found his descriptions of the songs he played for other people amusing.
1074;"The more I think about Bret Easton Ellis's novel ""American Psycho,"" the more I consider it a member of the exclusive ""Great American Novel"" club."
1075;I predict that the coming decades will see Ellis's novel elevated to the pantheon of great American literature, a novel so indicative of its time and place that future generations will read it in order to gain insight into certain segments of our culture.
1076;Ellis's novel shows us how that greed taken to its farthest extension is anything but good.
1077;Pat seems to have everything the American dream promises: good looks, money, a good lineage, an ivy league education, beautiful women, nice digs, all the accoutrements that come with being a member of the American social elite.
1078;hero to embark on epic excursions of bloody mayhem, from a colleague producing a better business card than the ones Patrick carries to a homeless man on the street who has the temerity to ask for money.
1079;He's one of them, one of the cream of the crop, and is certainly not the sort of scoundrel who would murder and maim harridans, business associates, or anyone else who happens to cross his path.
1080;He's really nothing and he knows it.
1081;What we do get is highly disturbing thanks largely to the marvelous skills of actor Christian Bale in the lead role.
1082;In a film loaded with talent.
1083;bale easily holds his own and then some as the savage psychotic.
1084;It's amazing there are times you won't know whether you should laugh or shriek in terror at Bateman's latest escapade.
1085;extras on the disc include production notes, cast biographies, a trailer, an interview with Bale, and a making of featurette.
1086;My pain is constant and sharp and I do not hope for a better world for anyone, in fact I want my pain to be inflicted on others.
1087;It's still as crazy and funny as I remember.
1088;this is the greatest movie I have ever seen, it is so brilliant that it boggles the mind.
1089;And you too will see the sheer brilliance of this movie.
1090;"I've finally caught a full viewing of the ""American Psycho"" because every time it came on TV I would usually catch it towards the end then turn it off."
1091;First I must say I found the title somewhat misleading as I fully expected it to be another slasher flick, but it's actually a psychological thriller with a dash of satire.
1092;bateman, whose idea of foreplay is pontificating on the merits of his favorite 1980's songs, is disgusted with his fellow man's lust for material status and conformity.
1093;the conclusion of the film leaves it to the audience to determine whether Bateman actually murdered anyone or if he merely fantasized the killings.
1094;Directed by a woman, American Psycho is a thought.
1095;provoking study of the inner workings of a dark and twisted mind.
1096;It's a good one to watch especially for the price that Amazon is placing it for.
1097;Bale did a wonderful job, and Reese Witherspoon is usually solid playing her roles.
1098;Excellent movie especially if you want to remember some eighties music while watching a psychotic man murder people and you know you do.
1099;It created a sensation, and although most editorialists got it completely wrong, I do applaud them for creating a buzz around this outstanding film.
1100;He doesn't limit himself to just women, but the most fantastic scenes in the movie occur when he kills beautiful model.
1101;The movie has a very simple and very powerful message: Patrick is deranged, but so is everyone around him.
1102;There is a Realtor, in fact, who proves herself to be far more deranged than Patrick, and she commits no outright crime.
1103;this movie is a brilliant satire of a period piece.
1104;He can do crazy very well.
1105;"He stops for a moment and stares at his gun and gives it a sort of ""What the hell"" look."
1106;The second American Psyco is pretty hilarious too.
1107;I got this movie for a friend for chirstmas and she loved the movie.
1108;Funny ('feed me a stray cat').
1109;This is simply an awesome film!
1110;The supporting cast all do their jobs well (look out for a young reese witherspoon) but Bale well and truly steals the show and is so effortlessly ingaging as Bateman i have found myself watching films purely if he is in them.
1111;Check out the memorable quotes to see some of the great one liners to be found in this truly spectacular film.
1112;It's amazing how well that Yuppie era was recreated.
1113;The film influenced me to read the book, which is a wonderful expansion of the film.
1114;The commentary tracks are very entertaining.
1115;Overall, I found the movie to be a terrific horror roller.
1116;I liked Mr Bale for sure in this one .
1117;wild story and definitely a good movie.
1118;Has some interesting scenes about narcissistic 80's types.
1119;This movie has a wonderful soundtrack.
1120;His character is one that is inside everyone, and the ending has a great twist that I have found to leave some confused.
1121;The color is very brillant as well.
1122;The transfer is amazing crisp clear, no grain, no darkness, the audio is enhanced to a 5.1 sound mix which is very nice.
1123;The special features are interesting too, good solid interviews on the setting of the film to the book.
1124;worth the upgrade if you have a previous release.
1125;Stylish, entertaining, humorous, suspenseful and funny.
1126;Blame it on the female director.
1127;This movie is so damn cool, the acting by Bale is great top notch, he plays some up tight yuppie from wall street who is infatuated with his own self while going around killing people.
1128;the 80's music is cool and just funny as hell for some reason , like when he shows the cover of phil collins album.
1129;This movie is full of laughs and great acting and directing, there are 3 or 4 murders like 1 or 2 in the beginig and then like 2 at the very end, it would have been nice to throw one in the middle.
1130;more violence would have got this 4 stars but since there wasnt it I will go with 3 1/2 stars.
1131;Christian Bale's performance is outstanding and the supporting cast does just that .
1132;filled romp through insanity and the light.
1133;Does dinner sound good about now?The obsession with food is not clearly explained in the film: let's just say for common decency here that our lead character is a man of extraordinary tastes.
1134;One of the best movies of our era!!
1135;Great Dolby 5.1 sound, and excellent extra features with interviews of Mary Harron, and Gweneviere Turner, James St. James, etc. talking about the 80s.
1136;Though this movie was probably not intended to be comical, the main character is so far out there that his comments and mannerisms are hilarious.
1137;(My following comments may give away essential plot points.)
1138;The movie puts us in the mind of a mad man, Patrick Bateman, who's telling us his story.
1139;Work, living address, clothes, restaurants frequented and particularly the design of one's business card are vital means for providing this.
1140;He tells us that he's very aware that he's not what he pretends to be.
1141;there are dark humorous touches in the movie.
1142;One is Bateman's smooth, practiced critique of the profundity of the pop music that he plays during some of his crimes.
1143;The acting is astounding, Christian Bale is able to obtain the image of a business man with manners and raving psycho(though the business man is better played.)
1144;It's not so much thrill as its is horror, but nonetheless this is one of the best serial killer movies.
1145;He uses chainsaws, axes, knives.
1146;Nice twist on psycho films.
1147;Christian Bale is one of my favorite actors.
1148;We liked it a lot.
1149;Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is a very successful NYC Wall.
1150;street yuppie in the 80's, he's got a wealthy lifestyle, a great apartment, nice taste in music and a beautiful fiancee named Evelyn (Reese Weitherspoon).
1151;The film co. stars Jared Leto, Josh Lucas and William Defoe in fine acting roles in this picture, it's one of the best horror.
1152;thrillers of the 2000's and shouldn't be missed by any fan of the genre plus the soundtrack is great.
1153;Aside from the plot and the acting, the film is the definition of surreal.
1154;When else are you going to see a nail gun pointed at the back of a woman's head or a prostitute being chased by a naked guy with a chainsaw.
1155;Also, the movie is great.
1156;Would definitely recommend to anyone who loves a good mind.
1157;Pat Bateman is an intelligent, Harvard educated yuppie who has a sense for fasion and works on Wall Street.
1158;He has to have the best of everything, and on many levels, he does.
1159;He tries his hardest to fit in, and in the most part, he succeeds.
1160;Some of the amusing little scenes (ex.
1161;But if you want it more shocking and suspenseful, by all means, see the movie first.
1162;Well not enjoyed but it's worth 5 stars.
1163;Updated review: I now have read the book, and it made me realize that this is a genius interpertation by the astute filmmakers!
1164;Tackling this massive, bitterly cynical satirical (and at times boring) book, and giving it a focus, heart, and soul is nothing short of amazing!
1165;I congratulate the filmmakers and upgrade my review from three to four star ratings.
1166;I loved him taking offense to the anti.
1167;Do I recommend this film?
1168;If you haven't read the book, it's grippng in its own twisted way and Bale is great.
1169;It's weird but simultaneously brilliant filmmaking.
1170;It gave the movie a nice touch.
1171;Not a movie I would watch a million times, but it was worth watching the one time.
1172;Not only will this movie make you look like you enjoy a movie that requires a high amount of intelligence for you to understand this movie, but it also brings out the fun of watching a serial killer go completely psycho.
1173;not that I condone such things, but it's pretty fun to watch.
1174;This is best kept to yourself for your enjoyment.
1175;Catch Christian slater in his younger days.

1177;batman Christian Bale as the main character, Patrick Bateman, this film is not only a great cinematic experience, but a wonderful adaptation, as well.
1178;this film also keeps the tone the book so richly describes.
1179;If you love Ellis's work, this is a film you can get into.
1180;It's so perfect in so many ways that it's a true classic, both in book and movie form.
1181;it takes a lot to confuse an audience in a good way with dialogue, and Harron seems to be an expert.
1182;It keeps you guessing in a way that constantly leaves you intrigued.
1183;You'll want to obtain understanding, and the movie seems to hold it on a fishing line in front of you while never actually letting you have it.
1184;what really makes this film enjoyable is the deep emotionality of it all.
1185;"Movies like ""Funny Games"" became famous for pressing the issue of empathy, but this film really had a handle on it first, and I think it makes it a true classic."
1186;this film is also so brilliantly sarcastic that it is wildly funny.
1187;From Bale's acting to the overly oblivious behavior of all the other characters, the chemistry of this film is dazzling.
1188;It's a guilty type of pleasure.
1189;most importantly, though, this film is believable.
1190;The sets are made perfectly and the story fits even more.
1191;The fact that he is an everyman makes the whole thing so much more real.
1192;overall, I think this film is truly remarkable.
1193;It's the perfect blend of cinema.
1194;If you like horror, you will love this film.
1195;Funny though it may be, it's filled with wonderfully uncomfortable situations.
1196;As if the film itself didn't have enough to love, that might give you an extra incentive.
1197;This movie is well handled, to say the least.
1198;I think it maintains the spirit of the novel.
1199;There is some consolidation of characters, and thus some of the details are changed, but overall it is a pretty faithful production.
1200;There is a little more humor in the movie, but I wouldn't go so far as to call this a dark comedy .
1201;One of my favorite movies of all time.
1202;Knee slapping funny with fantastic slasher scenes.
1203;this movie is much more than a story about murders and sex.
1204;i dont know if this is a great review but i do know that this is a great movie/book that should only be viewed by people who are willing to see past the sex and gore.
1205;American Psycho is, hands down, one of the best movies made recently.
1206;It is witty, smart, funny, and everything else you can ask for in a film.
1207;It is well worth a look.
1208;Bateman is, by day, a normal individual.
1209;The charm also comes from his relationship to other characters, particularly the wonderful Reese Witherspoon as his fiance, and the beautiful Chloe Sevoine as his secretary.
1210;The book is a great piece of literature and the film is a wonderful piece of cinema.
1211;The great thing about the movie version is that it focused on the story and the wit of the book, not the violence.
1212;I can definitely recommend American Psycho.
1213;Those who loved movies like Very Bad Things, Rushmore, Election, and Pulp Fiction will really enjoy this movie.
1214;Such a fun movie to watch.
1215;Better to watch 2nd and 3rd times to catch little nuances.
1216;Bale gives one of his best performances ever.
1217;"Christian Bale is an incredible actor and his portrayal of Patrick Bateman in ""American Psycho"" is unforgettable."
1218;He is only happy in someone else's skin.
1219;this movie is violent and has disturbing elements but it is very well acted by Bale.
1220;I would agree this is a dark comedy and recommend it for its entertainment value.
1221;it is a comedy: a very, very, very black comedy.
1222;everything is played for laughs.
1223;Even the yuppies back then who agonized over getting the right seat at the right restaurant and having the perfect look and business card didn't even really believe in those things themselves.
1224;it is a wise decision to downplay the horror aspects of the movie.
1225;this movie, like other movies about the eighties, play best as nostalgia.
1226;American Psycho is intent on giving us a good laugh.
1227;"I thought it would be part of the ""I Still Know What Mrs. Tingle Did With You Idle Hands Last Friday the 13th"" routine, but this individual and occasionally stunning feature is a real horror film for a real adult audience."
1228;Outside of work, though, he is an accomplished serial killer.
1229;out finale, but this is still an imaginable, carefully crafted film that is highly controversial because of it's continuous violence and rather odd sexual themes, but Christian Bale and Mary Harron work excellently and co. operate well together to make this film hugely successful with both critics and our friends at the box office.
1230;The film has a lot of laugh.
1231;loud funny moments, but if you're expecting a horror.
1232;"Christian Bale's performance is another great thing about this great movie
1233;both hip and cool, American Psycho is an underrated little movie that deserves praise.
1234;Lots of horror, but the character is fascinating and the ending leaves a bit of suspense.
1235;It's like making fun of game show hosts .
1236;Her strategy is, first of all, to make this film a period.
1237;piece, i. e., cell phones bigger than one's head"
1238;Christian Bale's impossible task is to give convincing readings of lines like Phil Collins' solo work is more commerical, and therefore satisfying in a narrower way.
1239;The film is almost worth watching for that scene alone .
1240;Every frame shouts Don't get mad!
1241;This is a great film, but I'm not going to go into the writing, acting, or directing, here .
1242;ray can provide, and the sound is captivating.
1243;The washed out affect is there to reflect the mind of the killer, and how he sees things.
1244;another great bd to add to your collection.
1245;I love this movie, it really surprised me, how good is Christian here, the plot, all the music, it is a masterpiece, and in Blu.
1246;The movie was outstanding though.
1247;Christian Bale is a wonderfully talented and attractive star who makes the movie.
1248;There are some movies that when an actor acts in them every time you see that face again you see that character they played this is one of two that I see that way.
1249;the other is the very beautifull acteress that played the people eater in Angel .
1250;Every time I see her I see maggots eating her face.
1251;Every time I see this mans face I want to puke.
1252;This is a horrable movie who those who keep the chainsaw movies going around and around should love.
1253;And turns real people's stomach.
1254;If you are a goulie you will love this movie.
1255;love Christian Bale in this movie.
1256;s. this is a good film from an amazing book, read the book, watch the film, love the violence
1257;This kind of humor is exactly my kind of humor, so I laughed at American Psycho throughout.
1258;Mary Harron also seemed to recognize that the novel was old enough that she should approach the film as a period piece and she executes this well.
1259;She creates a virtual remake of the novel as I pictured it in my head years ago.
1260;Bale is outstanding here and Harron really seems to be a directorial force with her actors.
1261;old wealthy and successful investor.
1262;He is clearly a product of a privileged and ultra.
1263;Evidence of his murders also seemed to disappear quite easily.
1264;He understands Patrick Bateman and makes the character the mind.
1265;Her movies are interesting and American Psycho is a stand.
1266;It is sickeningly disturbing and a great movie that twists your mind.
1267;It is a movie where it expounds on the life of a rich wallstret suck up who is going insane, and indeed does crack a little.
1268;With a surprising, believable twist, with Ptrick Bateman (played by Christian Bale) going on a murder spree.
1269;The power of the mind.
1270;If you are a Christian Bale fan, you'll like to watch this movie and compare his work to his later works.
1271;Harron and Turner's screenplay is very faithful aswell as well adapted.
1272;The film can be enjoyed the 50th time as much as the first unlike many psychological movies.
1273;bale's performance is extraordinary and is entirely convincing.
1274;Dafoe's appearance is also delightful.
1275;From the moment i heard about this movie i knew it was something unique.
1276;entertaining but it is clever and almost comical.
1277;Christian Bale stunningly portrays Patrick Bateman in the most real to life way possible.
1278;Bale succeeds in entering the mind of a psycho.
1279;The movie is beautiful in every way and grips you until the end.
1280;Great cast make this a memorable movie.
1281;But Bales performance, which was amazing, was entertaining yet somewhat comical.
1282;It raises large questions about life and how one should live it.
1283;How we interact with others is a major theme of the movie.
1284;Bale plays Patrick Bateman, a New York City yuppy who has money, hangs out with his friends at clubs and dinner, has a sweet girlfriend {Witherspoon},, and has a nice apt.
1285;american Psycho is a must.
1286;But I enjoyed it just as much.
1287;I recommend this movie to everyone.
1288;I found it disturbing, yet humorous.
1289;I'd recommend it to anyone with an open mind about headcases.
1290;this movie satires society in how some of us have become so preoccupied with being wealthy having the best of everything.
1291;He loves to kill people.
1292;He lives his life like it is a movie and he is just merely going along for the ride.
1293;Bateman has absolutely no human emotions such as joy and pain.
1294;the ending of the movie will surprise the viewers and really make them wonder what actually happened and what Bateman just imagined.
1295;Still, the movie delivers its message across to the those with an open mind.
1296;When they're at work, they seem at the top of their game.
1297;there are some truly laugh out loud moments in this movie if you have a twisted mind.
1298;I found myself laughing and shaking my head at some of the murders and the predicaments Bateman and his colleagues get into.
1299;If one is looking for a unique, twisted, and funny movie, check out American Pyscho.
1300;Heck, not even the soundtrack helped, and I love 80s pop.
1301;A great concept with no follow through.
1302;Witty, scary, thought provoking, entertaining, .
1303;Along with this, I believe that this could be the greatest movie in Bale's career.
1304;He gives a perfect portrayal of Patrick Bateman in the movie.
1305;christian Bale is a great actor, and the aesthetics he brings to this movie are also a major plus.
1306;It's a great movie, I love it.
1307;I laughed at several parts of the movie and cringed when I knew another death was coming!
1308;You can see it each time on his face.
1309;i've watched this movie once, but I will be watching it again, and again, and again.
1310;It's a very cool movie.
1311;but the man can act!Oh!
1312;American Psycho was one of the best films of 1999.
1313;The blood and gore count was suprisingly low in comparison to other horror flicks, but the psychological scares rival that of a great Alfred Hitchcock film.
1314;This is a great film for those of you out there who prefer mind twisting to mind splattering.
1315;It is one of the WORST movies I have ever seen!
1316;It's a good combination of gore, sex, and psychosis.
1317;deliver the funniest film about twisted men since Fight Club.
1318;Bale transformed himself into an extraordinary simulacrum of a human being, a perfectly.
1319;He's the most memorable cinema nutcase in a mainstream film since Travis Bickle.
1320;it's pretty unthinkable that American Psycho will get an Oscar, but Bale proves himself to be one of the most technically adept and assured actors of his generation with this performance.
1321;Slasher film fans will be let down (I saw it in a cinema in Plymouth UK, with an audience of people who clearly expected a Manhattan Chainsaw Massacre and who were audibly disappointed not to get it) but it's a sublimely horrible and great film.
1322;Nice to see Willem Dafoe finally being cast as a sane person, too.
1323;I had to take myself to another place to enjoy this movie.
1324;If anyone is a fan of Bale's work, this is a must see.
1325;That aside, Bale plays the perfect looking, perfectly chisled, perfectly groomed Patrick Bateman to perfection.
1326;The man behind the perfect mask is truly psychotic.
1327;He is the best actor out there and dedicated to his craft which makes him fascinating to watch.
1328;I recommend this film and as a matter of fact, all of his films.
1329;He is a huge talent.
1330;AMERICAN PSYCHO is possibly the most stimulating film i have ever seen.
1331;it is set in the best year, 1985, and accompanied by great music (new order, genesis, etc), sex, drugs, money, and best of all.
1332;not only is this the ultimate cult classic novel, christian bale could very well be THE actor of the 21st century.
1333;so all you kids run out and get this video, you will learn to live, and you will love life like you have never imagined possible.
1334;you can thank christian's performance for this experience.
1335;Bale is int it, enough for me to stay and watch it he is so diverse in all his roles plus he in easy on the eyes lol I love him.
1336;Whats even more exciting is the little twist at the end.
1337;Highly recommend this to any ADULT.
1338;I got this movie because I am a huge Christian Bale fan.
1339;If you're into heartless psychotic killer movies with blood, guts, and a sense of humor, you will enjoy this.
1340;The 80's references make this kind of fun to watch too.
1341;I liked it very entertaining cast is great acting very good all in all a good movie very cool story line
1342;His colleagues are young men his age, who vie for the best business cards, restaurant reservations, ties, and suits.
1343;worker, prostitutes, homeless men and models.
1344;Both are wonderful actresses and give the movie some depth.
1345;Patrick gets away with everything with his public persona .
1346;Even as Patrick is loading a full body bag in the car a friend comes up and comments what a gorgeous bag .
1347;He is highly protected in a world of money and style.
1348;american Psycho is a great satire on Yuppie culture.
1349;stompin' good film, and was smart and fortunate enough to cast Christian Bale in the lead.
1350;the film will have most appeal to folks who had to suffer these monstrous urban characters in the 80s and 90s .
1351;"the ""business card scene"" rates as classic, the over."
1352;top chainsaw chase comes close, and Bale swooning over the cultural contributions of Whitney Houston and Phil Collins as he hacks his way through the mediocrity of his own mind is just delicious.
1353;globus Cannon Films sensibility on top of an art film in order to hawk it to the Great Mass it sees as proles.
1354;Watching it with that in mind made me understand the film for what it was, very funny but also very dark.
1355;Old classic that has some of the best scenes ever!
1356;bird, muscles throbbing, covered in his victim's blood, wielding a chain.
1357;probably a great movie for its time but definitely has some sick themes, but just seeing Bale naked is worth it.
1358;The movie was intriguing enough to keep you watching, but you were expecting something to happen or be resolved or come to a head.
1359;American Psycho is truely one of the most stylish, sophisticated and sexy films I have ever seen.
1360;Christain Bale has given his finest performance and I must say, he truely deserved many awards for his role.
1361;American Psycho is a stylish fare with alot more to see that guts splashing all over.
1362;it is, however, a mildly amusing movie, has some excellent photography, and Christian Bale does an ok job portraying the main character.
1363;But true satirical art must be fresh, original, and sustained, not merely stylish and half.
1364;N. b.: the opening credits montage is very well.
1365;done and clever, and worthwhile viewing on its own, if you have the will power to stop it once it's finished.
1366;crafted satires of late, American Psycho finds humor in the extremes of human behavior and the horrors we unleash on one another.
1367;As a spit in the eye of '80s greed, this tale is just a relevant today.
1368;He murders homeless people, prostitutes and even his own friends.
1369;It's not a classic, but it is still a good film.
1370;big shoulders, walls of hair, business cards.
1371;True sociopath played beautifully by Christian Bale.
1372;He hangs out with other rich, self.
1373;The hero takes his privileged status to its ultimate degree by becoming a serial killer who preys on women and men who aren't a part of his class.
1374;In other words, the story sucked, but the acting was excellent.
1375;Christian Bale is always good, and this movie is no exception.
1376;Great acting and fascinating to watch.
1377;Funny that I'm not really a big fan of Bale's, but this is worth watching.
1378;What really impresses me in this movie is the main character.
1379;Tihs movie gave a great example of the 80s bussiness men and how they interacted.
1380;Very funny, uncommon and weird horror movie.
1381;to truly like this film, one has to understand it.
1382;while no where near as fascinating or gory as the book, this film does do it justice in my opinion.
1383;There are some seriously funny scenes and lines in this one.
1384;The result is a movie that is about as good a filming of the novel as one could hope for.
1385;Wickedly bright and utterly ruthless, he makes big bucks working at a high powered finanical concern in New York.
1386;Instead, go into this with an open mind and just watch it and try to understand it for what it is.
1387;CHRISTIAN BALE gives one of the BEST performances I have ever seen by an actor.
1388;Yes that is a strong statement, but I can't stop thinking about this movie and how he ABSOULETELY NAILED his performance.
1389;While Tom Hanks gets a lot of accolades for his performances, I think a lot of his performances reflect his personality into the character.
1390;This character that Christian portrays is complex, dark, and emotionless on the inside yet outgoing and extremely educated on the outside and Christian performs both sides to absolute perfection.
1391;The whole time you watch him you just marvel at how well he pulls off everything he does.
1392;Christian is the star and what makes this movie what it is.
1393;All of this though itertwines into the story and helps add humor to it by making fun of the 80's ME decade.
1394;This movie isn't for everybody, but if you have an open mind and don't go into it with any expectations, you should enjoy it for the type of movie it is and for the acting performance you are about to see.
1395;The ending is enough alone to make you watch and want to see it again!
1396;An excellent and comprehensive view of a sociopath with Narcissism to the fullest.
1397;I dont' really understand it, I guess I should read the book, but I think It's a really well done movie.
1398;Of course Bale is great, i love him as bateman and I also loved the period of the film.
1399;"So, naturally I thought I struck gold with the ""uncut killers edition""."
1400;There are 5 deleted scenes that add up to about 2 minutes, so this was barely worth it, only because I love this movie so much.
1401;He works for his fathers company, even though he doesn't really have to.
1402;He has a body every man wants and every girl wants to touch.
1403;He's meticulous and anal in everything he does.
1404;It was a lot of fun to listen to his Patrick's narration of who he is and what he is.
1405;not only is the movie just crazy good, it's also pretty funny.
1406;There are just a lot of funny lines in this movie, but dark funny guys.
1407;I love how he tells people he will kill them, but you know he means it.
1408;christian Bale is a pretty good actor for sure.
1409;But one thing for sure is that good gracious God blessed that man with a crazy metabolism or something.
1410;I'm not gay, but the man has a great body.
1411;And to do what he does with it is crazy.
1412;The movie has you in suspense the entire time.
1413;I would definitely watch this movie again.
1414;At times color is satisfactory and detail is reasonably sharp.
1415;it's decent, but the DTS.
1416;Bateman is a Wall Street high.
1417;grin, and his voice is rather high.
1418;"this is entirely suitable for Bateman
1419;Bale uses his physicality as part of his roles, and always has: here he has the well.
1420;anyone whose work justifies the solipsistic lifestyle he leads .
1421;there are many murders in this film, but the viewer is gratefully spared seeing any of them in any sort of detail.
1422;ish way, detail about the killings"
1423;headed to really be capable of killing.
1424;christian Bale is a complete marvel in this role.
1425;I have been a fan since his heart.
1426;polished gleaming chainsaw and screaming at the top of one's lungs.
1427;This sort of response is essential to the proper understanding and enjoyment of this movie.
1428;the film is strongest as a commentary and exposition of the 1980s yuppie quest for world domination, though some may complain Harron is a one.
1429;(This is, in fact, the inspiration for one of Bateman's murderous rages.)
1430;macho world of corporate takeovers, Harron is able to more fully explore them.
1431;This is one of those movies that you should own.
1432;Anyway, Bale's acting is great, the editing is good, direction is good, but the story sucks.
1433;It's a great commentary on how narcissistic Americans can be.
1434;This movie is great if you like shows like Dexter or Breaking Bad .
1435;it's smart, disturbing, and sends a messege about the human condition.
1436;Christian Bale is fantastic in this movie.
1437;If you like movies that deal with the psychotic killer, you will like this one.
1438;starts out great and ends great.
1439;I am a Christian Bale fan and he played an excellent psychopath in this movie.
1440;The inner dialogue of his character is what made the movie very entertaining for me.
1441;My wife and I watched it about two weeks ago and we're still talking about some of the scenes in the movie.
1442;This has to be one of the best movies ever made.
1443;Christian Bale put on one of the greastest performances by actor that i have ever seen.
1444;He really deserved an oscar for the role.
1445;ray, I would have to say it is outstanding.
1446;By the way, Christian Bale did an excellent job and its hard to believe he is the same person as he was in EMPIRE OF THE SUN!
1447;*Spoiler* Christian Bale is excellent in this movie, he's really great at being a dick, but the movie is nuts because come to find out, it's all a dream.
1448;Not a great movie at all.
1449;Ellis' written world is full of super.
1450;attractive young men with secret killer ways.
1451;dropping and unending detail that Ellis gives to Bateman's ritualistic killings.
1452;ups Ellis in just about every department with her screen adaptation.
1453;Much like Ellis' portrait of Bateman, he is a man more concerned with performance than with the actual act of sex.
1454;He is making love to himself, enjoying his muscular body as it masochistically berates the women.
1455;there is a moment at the end of Psycho's wonderful finale where the characters are watching a presidential address by Reagan.
1456;Some parts were a little corny, but overall it was a good psychotic thriller.
1457;This is a very interesting social satire based on consumerism during the 80s.
1458;It's true to the novel for the most part and worth a look.
1459;That should tell the story right there.
1460;"So many classic lines
1461;Being interested in psychology, I saw more detail into the disturbed life of this corporate executive.
1462;I think the extras are exceptional.
1463;But this movie is a time capsule of the 80's, in addition to the flawless execution of Christian Bale's performance.
1464;First, Christian Bale's acting is superb.
1465;Some of the best acting i've seen in a while as a matter of fact.
1466;Second, the movie is highly entertaining with not one part of it being boring.
1467;I always thought it was just another """"Slasher"""" kind of film."""
1468;It's set in 1987, and it's such a movie in that you actually do start to wonder if it WAS made in 1987.
1469;The hairstyles, the clothes, the phones, the cars.
1470;And in the middle of all that, we have our main character Patrick Bateman, played by Christian Bale.
1471;As i said, the acting is extremely good.
1472;Bale is pretty much THE perfect choice for the role.
1473;So it is pretty violent in some parts, and basically the whole movie has a dark and violent atmosphere behind it.
1474;if you enjoyed Donnie Darko, Fight Club or even The Shining, you will no doubt enjoy this great movie.
1475;I highly recommend it, if you have or have not read the book.
1476;Patrick Bateman (our old friend, Christian Bale, from two personal favorites of mine, Newsies and Little Women) is a yuppie in the mid 1980's, extremely rich, and extremely messed up.
1477;This is probably partly due to the fact that all the yuppies he works and plays with are so much alike, and so self.
1478;Oh, and '80's music, he's big on '80's music.
1479;You know, Phil Collins, Huey Lewis, the best of the '80's at least.
1480;No doubt, despite the fact that he's obviously nuts, he really becomes a very sympathetic and likeable character.
1481;Of course, this disturbing feeling of sympathy for a psycho was purely intentional by the filmmakers, but it's fascinating nonetheless.
1482;American Psycho is one of the best movies out there right now.
1483;Definitely a must see film, if not a must own.
1484;All I could see was a self.
1485;It's also brilliantly funny and sarcastic.
1486;Christian Bale deserves some kind of award for his performance .
1487;If you're old enough to have voted against Reagan, you'll love it.
1488;A lot of people see the title and expect to see a slasher Friday.
1489;There has been a great debate over this movie's being classified as horror or comedy.
1490;It portrays a period in time and a certain mentality, but at the same time transcends to present day.
1491;He seeks it out in friends, job and social life, and finds nothing.
1492;I believe that, I believe a lot of that to be true.
1493;one of the oddest things I found about this movie was Patrick's relationship with his girlfriend.
1494;Want a real horror story, read the book.
1495;When I first heard that it had been made into a movie I was a bit shocked.
1496;But it turns out that they did a rather good job.
1497;One of the most unfilmable novels actually worked quite well on the big screen.
1498;a Merchant Ivory film with group sex and a chainsaw.
1499;detailed recreation of the late.80s.
1500;As with the book, the clever ending initially allows you to fool yourself into thinking that the film as a dream, until you think about it a bit more.
1501;This adaptation of the gritty bestseller is a real find.
1502;class society's little nuances, this movie manages to show just how complacent society has become, with Bale's lifestyle of a perfectly astute businessman masking his other life as a murderer who hires prostitutes up to his trendy flat.
1503;on the best all time list of murder and serial killer movies.
1504;this is a great flim for my collection.
1505;please keep titles like these
1506;Bale gives another winning performance in this dark satire about 80's yuppie life.
1507;For that reason I give it a 4 star rating.
1508;First off, American Psycho is one of my favorite movies of all time.
1509;Mary Harron's take on Bret Easton Ellis's masterpiece is amazing, and Christian Bale brings the character of Patrick Bateman to life like none other.
1510;Just like watching a train wreck, this movie creates fascination and disgust.
1511;The ending comes as a relief and a surprise.
1512;There's alot to say about this terrific movie, but I can almost sum it up in 2 words: CHRISTIAN BALE !
1513;What an amazing performance from a little known actor (from England of all places).
1514;this movie takes you on a whirlwind ride through the mind of Patrick Bateman, and what a ride it is.
1515;from the beginning of the film, you become immediately drawn to this guy, he is strangely likeable, despite his many excesses (including of course, murder).
1516;And the greed, lust and eccenticity of the Reagan 80's are well represented here, in hilarious form.
1517;This was a great film, fully worthy of 5 stars.
1518;the story mainly revolves around a man in his twenties who is very successful on Wall Street in New York City.
1519;He seems very charming and normal to just about all who meet him .
1520;he even has a fiance played very well by Reese Witherspoon.
1521;The scene where Patrick and his co. workers discuss their business cards will bring a smile to your face.
1522;It's amazing how the type of paper or ink used on a card can be so important and almost seem life.
1523;Their entire level of status rested upon a small card.You will probably find yourself in shock throughout most of the film, but sometimes that can be a good thing.
1524;This movie is not for the faint of heart, but if you think you are up to challenge of watching this film, I'd recommend it!
1525;This is the greatest movie ever made.
1526;Patrick Bateman is such a great character.
1527;"Christian Bale gives an excellent performance as a normal everyday ""psycho""."
1528;This movie is good for making you go to work and wonder who you are really working with.
1529;Great 80's music references and soundtrack.
1530;Watching it now in 2013 was a bit of a generation issue.
1531;The clothing, electronics and music (from the white.
1532;awesome blast from the past.
1533;Although I preferred the book, the movie did a great job presenting the main character.
1534;If you possess above average intelligence you are apt to enjoy this film.
1535;it takes a heavy subject and delivers it with alarming impact and humor.
1536;But then again I've always enjoyed a good laugh at the expense of others.
1537;I'll put it on display right next to my copy of The Reflecting Skin , another often misunderstood film.
1538;came in good condition and works fine.
1539;interesting, and strange film starring Christian Bale,worth a watch
1540;That being said it was a film that is definitely an underrated masterpiece.
1541;Before he was Batman, Christian Bale turned the film world on it's ear with his incredible performance in this adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis' controversial novel.
1542;While it has uneven moments, Bale's star making performance is worth seeing American Psycho for alone.
1543;"No one else could have brought the character of Patrick Bateman to life better than Bale, and the rest of the cast, including Reese Witherspoon, Justin Theroux, Josh Lucas, Jared Leto, Willem Dafoe, Chloe Sevigny, and Samantha Mathis
1544;A spectacular satire and a showcase for Bale's talents"
1545;If you've read the book and really enjoy it, stay away from the flick.
1546;christian Bale and Reese Witherspoon are brilliant in bringing their characters to life.
1547;But this movie is hilarious and black.
1548;And the satire is breath taking.
1549;We thought this was going to be the best movie since Stanley Kubricks A Clock Work Orange.
1550;I really enjoyed this movie because I am really into this genre of dark and twisted movies.
1551;It also showed us a person trying to find himself in the New York City society, and a great view of the eighties.
1552;The movie is about a good.
1553;Patrick has many hobbies: He loves music, going to clubs, charming the ladies, cocaine and of course killing, Mutilating and beating innocent people for the shear joy of watching them bleed.
1554;i really enjoyed this movie from start to finish.
1555;I really be keen on these weird twisted, dark movies because it keeps me entertained and usually laughing throughout the whole movie.
1556;This is one of the best horror movie I have seen in a while.
1557;The way they portrayed his life is perfect in everyway, to everyone's eyes but his own.
1558;This is why this movie gave great visuals to the dark and twisted part of it.
1559;This movie gave great visuals of the eighties.
1560;It really focused on what people thought about each other.
1561;If you do get it you will go for a 2.
1562;This movie also gave a great description of the eighties in New York city.
1563;In conclusion, I really enjoyed watching this movie and I still enjoy watching this movie.
1564;classic, American Psycho, is about a young, well.
1565;off young man, who loves himself almost as much as he loves killing.
1566;"This movie really shows the sickness that can be under a seemingly ""normal person."""
1567;"I
1568;This movie is fun and really delivers the thrills, compared to the book, i am kinda glad they cut some content the deaths while more gory and sexually deviant in the book where a bit over the top to make it more satirical, i personally felt that the deaths and sexual content in the book didn't add to the overall story.
1569;But it was a fun book all the same.
1570;I love the movie and the book equally.
1571;Christian Bale turns in a great performance in this disturbing yet darkly comic tale of an 80's yuppie with a bloodlust as strong as his self obsession.
1572;For lovers of dark humor and social commentary.
1573;American Psycho is an adaptation of an incredible book written by Bret Easton Ellis, and this movie definitely captures everything the book stands for.
1574;Christian Bale is simply amazing, and his portrayal of Patrick Bateman is simply mindblowing!
1575;This movie will keep you interested until the very end, where there is a big surprise waiting for you!
1576;The cast is incredible and doesn't disappoint.
1577;Still an excellent perforance from Christian Bale!!!
1578;American Psycho, the book, seems like an easy fit to the screen in terms of visuals.
1579;For instance, in the book you can note the actual style in which the book is structured.
1580;(Though if you go through them you find some great lines.)
1581;I thought American Psycho was as good an adaptation as anyone could hope for if they're a fan of the book.
1582;Mary Harron (a female director making the ultimate movie about """"men behaving badly"""" as she puts it in the featurette) does two things: she makes the film a real treat for those who read the book, and she makes the film funny and witty enough for those just wondering what the fuss is."""
1583;Christian Bale is amazing as Patrick Bateman.
1584;The accent is great, the facial expressions priceless (that look he gets when examining a rival's business card), the whole play he does on the character.
1585;the filmmakers do an incredible and difficult job of cutting the book down to filmable size.
1586;It's a great job of picking scenes from the book for the screen, meanwhile leaving out entire sections and characters (Bethanie, his ex.
1587;christian Bale is so commanding as Bateman that he gives a real face to the narrator of the book.
1588;It's a very vicious satire that combines all of those elements and stays smart.
1589;hollywood director making this without compromising more of the book in favor of personal style.
1590;Sure, they're cutting room floor, but at least 2 of the scenes would have fit nicely into the film, and the other bits are funny as well.
1591;this is a highly recommended film for anyone with a little dark side, no matter how little.
1592;It's funny and visually provoking enough for many people to fall in love with this small production and appreciate cruel satire and the blackest humor.
1593;the actors compromise their performances, and you can tell why, they think that by being in such an edgy and suspenseful movie that looks thought provoking will get them an Oscar Nomination.
1594;"Yeah, yeah, the mask symbolizes the true self from the one we all see
1595;Great movie, one of my favorite Christian Bale flicks.
1596;He really nails this role and the plot will keep you on your toes!
1597;Great movie about a sicko.
1598;American Psycho is an amazing film that is based on Bret Easton Ellis' book.
1599;It has amazing acting, great direction, a brilliant script, and great visual imagery.
1600;It's funny, horrific, and disturbing.
1601;That's an accomplishment on its own.
1602;bale(Bateman) has an amazing performance in his role.
1603;His acting adds to every scene in the film that he's in.
1604;The supporting cast is also very good.
1605;Expect a hilarious, disturbing piece of cinema.
1606;Anyone with a degree of wit will enjoy this film, though may question themselves for doing so, considering the dark content.
1607;the film centres around Patrick Bateman, a well.
1608;Their relationship typifies the 80s culture, summed up by Evelyn's """"my friends are your friends"""" justification for their love."""
1609;Both are having affairs with each other's drug.
1610;Bateman, brilliantly captured in all his perfect clinical detail by Christian Bale, spends his days honing his physique with a mind.
1611;Bateman and friends spend much of the film enjoying Cocaine.
1612;bateman's geeky love of 80s music characterised by his emotional critique of Genesis, Huey Lewis and Whitney Houston is very very funny, and I don't mind admitting despite his murderous leanings, I really enjoyed the character, and don't be suprised if you find yourself nodding along to some of his insanely bitter rants or laughing at his egotism and withering put.
1613;make your own mind up whether Bateman's a murderer or just a fantasist, but be sure to see this film, and if you enjoy it, add the book to your haul too.
1614;And that's a good thing.
1615;Andrezj Sekula cinematography struck me as particularly good as it perfectly resembles that 80s look and feel in a picture that's been released in 2000.
1616;"and then there's a brilliant performance by Christian Bale, one of the best serial killer impersonations I've ever seen and Bale's best acting ever if it wasn't for stuff like ""The Machinist"" which would come later in his career."
1617;I'm a huge Christian Bale fan, and he really does a great job here.
1618;He is so detached and still so captivating.
1619;This movie was grotesquely amusing.
1620;Interesting movie that takes some thought to watch.
1621;Mary Herron did an outstanding job with her interpretation of the novel by Brett Easton Ellis.
1622;True she tones down the violence but she also has made sure that the tone of the novel remains intact.
1623;Christian Bale is simpy superb in this film his Patrick Bateman is one of modern cinemas classic performances.
1624;Can't imagine who would enjoy it.
1625;Twisted movie with a great ending.
1626;Of your into crazy movies this is one to watch.
1627;His first movie I saw him in and he has still yet to top it in my opinion.
1628;he played his role very well,.
1629;As degenerate as it gets.
1630;"It was a awesome movie and he did a great job being a ""psycho""."
1631;And his American accent is perfect, almost better than his last New York accent role in Newsies!
1632;famous is satired really well.
1633;Look for the scene where they're comparing their business cards: it's really funny!
1634;Anyway, Christian Bale fits quite perfectly in his role of the superfical caricature of a businessperson.
1635;I watched this movie expecting all of the gore, disgusting thematics, and [sexual content] it was built up to have, but I was pleasnatly suprised to have viewed a highly intelligent, witty, and thought provoking masterwork from Mary Harron.
1636;Patrick Bateman did a marvelous job as Bateman, and the supporting cast was delightful.
1637;The movie is all around amazing.
1638;Its that simple, there are people who will watch it and love every joke at the 80's over indulgance.
1639;They will love the way a man is dedicated to appearing perfect.
1640;He basically has a nightly bloodthirst that grows and grows.
1641;I don't want to give anymore away, but the movie grows into a satire of the upperclass lifestyle in the 1980's.
1642;Very funny and violent at times, American Psycho is just a great movie.
1643;The only additional footage in the Unrated Version is some added footage in the wild sex scene, and a little extra blood.
1644;All in all, AP is one of the greats of 2000, get it now!
1645;Excellent direction and acting allow this film to not fall into the genre of trashy horror flick.
1646;This movie makes their fantasy a reality.
1647;There are moments of humility and even humor, but in the end it's a masterfully done dark satire, along the lines of A Clockwork Orange.
1648;But I shouldn't have been worried, Mary Herron created a masterpiece with this movie, and this movie captured a lot of the fascination of the book.
1649;The movie shows mostly the bitter black humor of the book, and the actors are brilliant.
1650;The perfect movie for when you are feeling like a psycho.
1651;Also has a great soundtrack with Whitney Houston and Huey Louis and the news.
1652;I have the unrated one and the extra footage adds nothing.
1653;Christian Bale as of late has come into his own I love the movies he head been in and he always plays his role with a great amount of care and is very convincing.
1654;this movie shows how an actor fine tunes his skills with roles and movies as they are added to their resume.
1655;probably okay for one viewing, .
1656;All in all, a decent movie.
1657;Bale is an American treasure.
1658;This classic is as good now as it was during initial release.
1659;One of my favorite movies!
1660;over all it's a real good movie.
1661;There's an essay in the sleeve that's a good read as well.
1662;Avoid this film if possible!
1663;moving upperclass Wall Street society of his father manifests itself both as an obsession with the brand names of the things he utilizes in his daily routine and as an unstoppable compulsion to murder.
1664;can you take a perfectly shallow character and center a whole book around him?
1665;this makes it all the more painful that so many wonderful roles surface in this film, not least up.
1666;i liked it as much as a movie that i watched starring Christian Bale.
1667;Christian bale is insightful and moving.
1668;Psycho is a statement on the greed of Wall Street, but also an introspective on our own consumerism.
1669;That scene where he calls The greatest love of all one of the most beautiful songs ever written completely without irony.
1670;well, there's more to this movie that will turn your stomach.
1671;I don't care for gore much myself, but this is a good movie that effectively explores all manners of disturbing behavior and thought.
1672;See it if you wanna get creeped out.
1673;It has more surprise twists than a pretzel.
1674;Definitely not Bale's best performance.
1675;The good news is, perhaps, that the film is nowhere near as gruesome and gory as both its subject matter and its controversial nature would lead one to believe.
1676;In fact, its tone of ironic comic detachment helps to de.
1677;stunning good looks, a fantastic physique, a beautiful fianc , a diploma from Harvard and a successful career as a Wall Street executive.
1678;that his perfectly maintained outer appearance, seemingly well.
1679;Much of the complexity of Patrick's character comes from the fact that he seems, paradoxically, to be both obsessed with the idea of conforming to the values of the world he lives in, and, at the same time, being strangely conscious of their unreality and meaninglessness.
1680;Much of Patrick's madness has its roots in the kind of obsessive.
1681;"free existence if one just has enough money and a sufficient amount of the right ""stuff"" to make it that way."
1682;Christian Bale brings a remarkable subtlety to a touchy role, managing to seem coolly alluring, chillingly detached, touchingly pathetic and wryly amusing all at the same time.
1683;Special credit should go to the stark, almost antiseptic look the filmmakers achieve through the art direction and set design, a look that matches in visual terms the moral and emotional emptiness of the characters and their world.
1684;I took this out of my local library to watch originally and just loved it's sentiment and evil.
1685;It's a definite thriller and sometimes macabre humor.
1686;Anyone that enjoys edge of your seat and misdirected tension will enjoy this movie
1687;The storyline and the atmosphere are there and it was quite enjoyable.
1688;Love this movie I recommend it to anyone that likes suspense!
1689;It holds your attention all the way through.
1690;Interesting to see Christian Bale's early work.
1691;Great edition of this move.
1692;American Psycho is a classic, underrated movie that is both funny and dark at the same time.
1693;This was the first Christian Bale movie I'd seen, and it's one of my favorite roles.
1694;he seems easy to get along with really.
1695;Well, this movie was a great one, but I'd categorize it under Dark Comedy myself.
1696;His simulation of insanity is easily believable by the viewer: he is a normal, everyday guy that we can identify with.
1697;This is what makes it especially shocking to the viewer: society has put Patrick in a box where he can do nothing but succeed, and yet he inexplicably decides to pursue a life as a deranged serial killer almost just to see if he can do it.
1698;The label put on him is so effective that when he confesses all his crimes to his lawyer in a moment of clarity, his lawyer doesn't even believe him.
1699;He is as crazy as they come, and Bale makes us believe it.
1700;It was a great psycho killer movie.
1701;Christian Bale definitely beats Jack Nicholson from The Shining in this movie.
1702;Great for horror oe thriller movie lovers.
1703;I was involve din that stuff and it got very intense.
1704;Everyone is wonderful in this movie, and it was very well.
1705;"I really can't say enough about Christian Bale
1706;A chilling yet funny performance by Christian Bale in this must watch slasher flick.
1707;the idea for this film is genius
1708;Her basic technique is diabolically simple"
1709;in a witty title sequence that demonstrates that what you believe you're seeing is not necessarily what you think it is.
1710;American Psycho benefits from a first.
1711;As Patrick Bateman, Christian Bale is spot on the money as a preppie.
1712;Reese Witherspoon is great as his fiancee who never realises who her man is, let alone WHAT her man is.
1713;Seymour has a remarkable likeness to Louise Brooks, and something of the same manner.
1714;We will see more of her in years to come, I think.
1715;Willem Dafoe is a treat as a detective who may or may not be on to Bateman.
1716;The fact that this film is stylish, witty, macabre, sexy and terrifying by turns is icing on a cake that could have been baked by Alfred Hitchcock.
1717;"He captures the character's dual personalities
1718;I was also quite impressed with film's flamboyant visualization of upper.
1719;Overall, American Psycho is nothing to brag about, but it will still keep you interested, and Christian Bale gives a terrific performance as well.
1720;Became fan of Christian bale and this movie is starting point for this method actor.
1721;Its Worth Watching movie .
1722;This is a fascinating movie that is sure to satisfy even the most bloodthirsty watcher!
1723;This movie was so good.
1724;Even when the whole damn movie made no sence to me i still loved it because of the great directing, cinimatography, and wonderfully placed 80s pop music.
1725;His acting is, as usual, great.
1726;This was a wonderful film that satirized rich, white, republican life in the late 80's, and accomplished it's goal with gusto!
1727;The film itself is very dark and well, psychotic.
1728;But there is something about the dialogue that makes you laugh.
1729;But I will say Don't just stare at it, Eat it!
1730;The performances in this film were very memorable.
1731;Christian Bale is an actor whose career I will watch with great interest.
1732;Reese Witherspoon is funny and sarcastic as ever.
1733;The rest of the cast was fine but the true star of this film is Christian Bale.
1734;The film is great and worthy of 5 stars.
1735;This has got to be in my top 7 or 8 favorite movies i've ever seen.
1736;I think Christian Bale was the perfect fit for this role.
1737;bring us back to the Pulp Fiction mid to late 90's days so we can have more great films like this
1738;this is a great movie but it deserves a better blu.
1739;ray than this, as it is ordinarily a beautifully shot film.
1740;i gave it three stars, because it is a great movie and for $10, this is a good starter for a budding Blu.
1741;This is a remarkable movie about the vapid narcissism of the 80's.
1742;It does an excellent job of pointing out the astoundingly shallow culture of the 80's (I was in my late teens, early 20s during this time) without quite making fun of it.
1743;Bale is remarkable in the part.
1744;Direction and cinematography: Makes Sliders look pretty slick.7.
1745;but the movie was actually better.
1746;I still suggest anyone that enjoyed the movie should read the book.
1747;I saw this movie then decided to read the book and I was suprised how well the movie held to the feel of the book.
1748;This man knows what he's doing when it comes to acting.
1749;American Psycho is a very untique movie,but it has style,its odd, it has a wonderful cast, and last but not least it takes us back to the 80's!!!!!!
1750;Christian Bale's performance was marvelous and I could not think of any one else who could have pulled the same performance
1751;But it is a daring movie, and its sordid potrayal of a whacko's life is certainly not recommended for the faint of heart.
1752;the film has very subtle undertones if you are willing to read between the lines.
1753;For a genre that is too often too campy, too violent without cause, and too brainless, American Psycho is a breath of fresh air.
1754;I'd say it is even well written.
1755;You'll see there's much more than meets the eye.
1756;Wouldn't recommend it to anybody I know.
1757;A simply outstanding film, but by far, a much better read.
1758;Once again, a truly outstanding film.
1759;I enjoyed the movie and would recommend it if your are into these types of movies.
1760;I would suggest this movies to anyone, the actor is great, and you are both attracted and scared by him.
1761;Another great Christian Bale performance.
1762;I watched this movie and was impressed with his early acting.
1763;I've got more and more respect for Christian Bale the more I see his movies.
1764;I rated it one star because we couldn't watch it through with our Roku.
1765;I bought this film for a good price having heard alot about it and with the word psycho in the title, I just had to see it.
1766;American Psycho is a great movie.
1767;There are some excellent scenes however, such as the business cards scene and Patrick Bateman's hilariously unnerving analysis of music from Huey Lewis and the News, Phil Collins, Whitney Houston, etc.
1768;GREAT movie, GREAT cast, GREAT acting, GREAT soundtrack!
1769;Christian Bale does a fantastic job!
1770;The sardonic handling of wall street mentality is a little entertaining.
1771;The dialogue from Bale such as his rants about 80's pop artists, was fun.
1772;If you see it and aren't repulsed by the violence towards women, you may continue to watch and be entertained and then be confused by it's ending.
1773;3of5 because it did have a few laughs.
1774;This certainly is quite a movie!
1775;Certainly is an accurate portrayal of an era in American history not so long ago, and we can only hope we've progressed D: Cheers!
1776;One of their favorite things to do was to compare business cards.
1777;When they got to Bateman's house, he had newspaper spread out all over the floor, with a chair with a sheet on it in the middle.
1778;he goes into the kitchen, puts on a raincoat, and picks up an alluminum polished axe.
1779;He smiles and says yes.
1780;the guy then proceeds to ask him if that is an axe, and Bateman replies pleasently, with a big grin on his face, Yes it is, and I'm going to kill you with it.
1781;tHE GOODChristian Bale did an excellent job of playing this Bateman guy.
1782;tHE BADThat a movie can make you laugh at this kind of stuff.
1783;It is by far one of the weirdest movies I have ever seen.
1784;This movie is a great black comedy.
1785;It's a little disgusting in some parts, and hilarious in others.
1786;I really liked this movie , and overall I gave it 5 stars.
1787;Bale shines in this here doozy of a cinematic tresure.
1788;haven't read the book, but will certainly pick it up sometime soon as this film which should appeal to horror fans as well as indy film lovers and anyone with a slightly twisted sense of humor, is a memorable one for sure.
1789;This is Christian Bale at his best, his performance oozes class.
1790;Classic performance in a classic movie.
1791;Now I must return some videos.
1792;I was quite impressed with this film.
1793;The thing that makes this film so much fun to watch is the fusion of 80's nostalgia and raw carnage being displayed with such creativity.
1794;Every scene has this dark sensibility but most of the time you are presented with daytime overcast skies, white walls and classic 80's artwork.
1795;This film is definately a winner and sure to be the Christian Bale breakout performance people will remember him for.
1796;do New York business exectutive with a high.
1797;Christian Bale is perfect in this film.
1798;Because I enjoy Christian Bale's work very much, I was anxious to see this film.
1799;It is admittedly violent and edgy, but if you focus on the nuances that make up an actor's craft, you will see this young man is extraordinarily talented.
1800;He worked very hard to get this role and is ideally cast in the film.
1801;I can also recommend 3:10 to Yuma if you can concentrate on his underplayed performance and ignore Russell Crowe and his gang.
1802;Bale was the believable character.
1803;american Psycho is NOT for the immature viewer, but if you are interested in dissecting characterization and film performance, this is a most worthwhile addition to your collection!
1804;All I can say is watch the movie and see why it deserves five stars!
1805;this film was one of the most complicated films that I have ever seen.
1806;On the other hand, certain scenes were hilarious.
1807;Christian Bale gives a great portrayal of Patrick Bateman, a self absorbed nut who ticks off about the littlest things.
1808;When things don't go his way or situations get too stressful for him, something inside him sparks, and he has to kill.
1809;Meanwhile, his relationship with his ditzy girlfriend is on the rocks, and her airhead friends constantly surround him.
1810;Reese Witherspoon plays Patrick's girlfriend, and she is perfect for the role.
1811;The musical score has hints of Bernard Herrmann's Psycho score, which fits in this film perfectly.
1812;The film changes plenty of Bret Easton Ellis's wonderful novel, but thankfully it retains the all.
1813;A brave Christian Bale is unforgettable as the tragi.
1814;Writer/director Mary Harron perfectly captures the ambience of the novel, and the design by Gideon Ponte and Andrew M. Stearn goes a long way to making low.
1815;Great Movie and performance by Christian Bale.
1816;This movie is a long time favorite and I continue to enjoy it from time to time.
1817;performing sex acts on each other, while he directs their every move and films them and himself.
1818;It was great and very moving and scary!
1819;I love this movie and book so much that I came up with a play inspired by it about two guys who become obsessed with emulating Patrick Bateman and end up getting carried away .
1820;It's called THE AMERICAN PLAY and it will be seen in New York in June.
1821;But, I was also unexpectedly delighted.
1822;Expertly casted, played perfectly and directed with finesse and humor, we not only get a picture of the times but also an understanding of the slide into madness.
1823;Definitely worth a watch if you were in high school during the 80's.
1824;Well done, well acted, and smart writing.
1825;This Blu Ray edition of American Psycho is awesome.
1826;When it arrived the disk was in good order and flawless condition and the playback on my PS3 was excellent.
1827;Both characters clearly have ego issues but the most salient point about American Psycho as a movies is how much more visceral and credible Bateman is over Bates.
1828;If it wasn't for the controversial nature of the subject matter, both the film and the novel deserve credit as hallmarks to great cinema and great writing respectively.
1829;This is a real strange film, well done, with a lot of zest and a great performance by Christian Bale.
1830;Probably one of the greatest movies of the 2000's, American Psycho made Christian Bale a movie star and is a film that definitely lives up to its theme and time in American history: the Reagan Era when people wanted more riches and the more they got the greedier they became often with dramatic results.
1831;bale plays a rich corporate young man who has it all.
1832;great apartment, beautiful clothes, great body and money.
1833;acted by Bale, it is Bale who makes the movie believable.
1834;This is honestly one of the last brilliant films to come out of Hollywood.
1835;Christian Bale is all out amazing in this movie, and as a book to movie it was decent over all.
1836;Take into consideration where you get your opinions, as a horror buff and psych thriller buff, this is a great movie.
1837;When it comes to sociological commentary and satire, this is a fantastic movie.
1838;Lastly, when it comes to that burning desire inside to just rip the heart out of that bastard who needs to have his heart ripped out, this is the best movie!
1839;Glad he is doing TV now, better actors can do movies.
1840;Christian Bale is amazing in this movie.
1841;But man his body so hot.
1842;She loved reading books about serial killers.
1843;On the outside they exude confidence, style, and success, and they know exactly what to say and when to say it.
1844;Welsh actor Christian Bale, in one of the best performances you will ever see, brings to life Patrick Bateman, the Wall Street yuppie who works at Pierce and Pierce by day and is a serial killer by night.
1845;What remains is the book's twisted sense of humor.
1846;perfect American accent that recalls a game.
1847;show host, Bale perfectly embodies his character physically and emotionally.
1848;His performance makes you simultaneously laugh at, pity, and fear Bateman.
1849;Nonetheless, """"American Psycho"""" is a disturbing but clever film that was one of the best of 2000."""
1850;This is a movie that stays with you, and will thrill you at every viewing.
1851;Christian bale delivers a excellent performance as a man with no morals and values.
1852;It reduces a magical piece of descriptive writing to pure dribble.
1853;What's really scary is that through much of the movie, our funny bone is being tickled.
1854;This film is loaded with dark humor, while Bale gives a dynamic performance.
1855;"This independent film has high production values, a fine music score by John Cale and good looking cinematography by Andrzej Sekula (""Pulp Fiction"")."
1856;Even though it boasts some shocking scenes (i. e. the chainsaw) the nature of the impact is mainly psychological and relies very much on the impressive performance by Christian Bale, once again proving the wonderful actor he is.
1857;friendly than the novel could possibly ever be, most female characters (including the melancholy Courtney) being sympathetic.
1858;A film told from the point of view of a psychotic is harsh enough, but the film also beckons the audience to question their own sanity.
1859;and the ideal serial killer.
1860;parts of this film should not be controversial: sleek photography, a good score, great acting by the supporting cast, and deft directing.
1861;Black satire, including American Psycho, is a legitimate theme as are serial killers.
1862;I just saw the movie, and decided to see wat you people had to say about it .
1863;I would call it an interesting thriller with a twist and very well played, but not a classic.
1864;Christian Bale is a convincing psychopath and homicidal murderer.
1865;There is blood and gore and but strangely comedic
1866;This is a good movie.
1867;Quite grainy in parts but it does look good and is still a great movie.
1868;but after this movie, I gotta go and read it.
1869;the funniest part of the movie is the music.
1870;funny movie, violence is not too terrible, and it's a great way to laugh at yuppies.
1871;Christian Bale proves in this movie that he is not just a handsome meathead, he is a true talent.
1872;He is so slimey and believable in this his character still creeps me out when I think of it.
1873;Bale character is funny, sadistic, and witty.
1874;American Psycho is one of the best twist films that I've seen.
1875;Bale really makes you go for the villain in this one.
1876;Although the movie is overall dark in subject matter, it's a must.
1877;movie thanks to Christian Bale.
1878;enjoy the movie for what it is, a very creative and eyebrow raising look at our fascination with serial killers and the vibe of the 80's presented in a very original manner.
1879;Similar to the feel and vibe of Natural Born Killers for the 90's.
1880;Acting and direction was great and flowed very well, especially in the un.
1881;enter this movie with the right frame of mind and you will enjoy it and get the message originally intended in the very controversial book.
1882;"Then, a few months ago, I saw Christian Bale in ""Batman Begins"" and thought he was fantastic."
1883;"I looked up ""American Psycho"" on the IMDb and it was rated pretty high."
1884;So I thought, what the hey, I'll give it a try.
1885;Because it's set in the 80's, it has a great soundtrack, and it makes the movie much more fun.
1886;mary Harron's directing is wonderful.
1887;During daytime scenes, the film seems bright and shiny, almost as though it were an adaptation of a Jane Austen novel.
1888;Harron enhances the film immensely.
1889;Bale's performance in this film is one of the greatest I have ever seen in my life.
1890;The rest of the cast is good, but Bale is absolutely spectacular.
1891;Entertaining, dramatic, absorbing, funny, well.
1892;made, and with a terrific ending.
1893;American Psycho is without a doubt one of the year's best.
1894;Always a great movie to watch anytime
1895;A brilliant portrayal of Vanity in the 1980's this film takesplace in the life of Patrick bateman.
1896;this films is undoubtedly the best film of the year 2000.
1897;it is as sharp as an axe in every way.
1898;One of the greatest psycho thrillers EVER.
1899;This film's portrayal of Bateman as an empty shell, a man on the outside with nothing inside is very accurate.
1900;"Besides, he is predisposed when it comes to echoing the sentimentality of success
1901;especially in the realm of music.
1902;order fashion and that disfunctionalities of our main character, Mr. Bateman, are reproduced with stunning beauty .
1903;readers that approved of the character and his barbed wit will no doubt enjoy Bale's portrayal of the malicious mindset inflicting our upper.
1904;class killer, and might actually be surprised at the number of scenes they recognize from the book's pages.
1905;I argue that is the essential element that makes this book work, makes it real.
1906;The entire point of this book is that you are reading the thoughts, you are inside the mind of a psychotic individual.
1907;It was interesting enought to watch but definitely not the best movie I have seen.
1908;I read this book many years ago, and was thrilled to come across the movie with a truly amazing cast!!
1909;If you love slashers this is an awesome one from way earlier in Christian Bale's career.
1910;Everything about this movie is well planned and performed.
1911;I added it to my watchlist because it sounded interesting and I think Christian Bale is a very good actor.
1912;Christian Bale is outstanding as a sick,tortured soul torn between his desire to be the man everyone wants to emulate with the right apartment,the right clothes,the perfect manicure,hell even the best business card and his hatred and contempt for those same like people.
1913;centered to hear him are quite funny.
1914;His commentaries on his favorite musical artists are hilarious!
1915;When he kind of shimmied (yes,Christian Bale shimmied!)
1916;I have never seen him in a role where he was so animated and he nailed it!
1917;The supporting cast was very good as well.
1918;This movie is definitely worth your time,I highly recommend it.
1919;As a documentary of a characterization of a stereotype of the 80's, the movie succeeds, and that is its only attraction.
1920;Amazon lists """"American Psycho"""" in the Comedy category."""
1921;A young person should NEVER see this movie!
1922;Had me guessing the entire show about the main character.
1923;It has a surprise ending.
1924;Highly recommend this suspenseful movie.
1925;Definitely a black comedy about a serial killer jumping into total madness.
1926;Definitely a classic to keep.
1927;I heard good things about it randomly on the internet so decided to give it a watch.
1928;the way the main character acts is very.
1929;interesting to say the least.
1930;That character in that movie was great and spooky.
1931;This character is extremely random and constantly energetic.
1932;American Psycho is a great movie.
1933;It was really interesting to see which scenes they decided to put back in.
1934;First and foremost is the actual ambiguity and even veracity of certain events.
1935;one of the best writers around IMHO.
1936;Throughout the movie he struggles with inner conflicts, which ultimately leads to his insanity.
1937;this is one of Christian Bales best performances as an actor.
1938;He plays the psychopathic killer role extremely well.
1939;That is what distinguishes a good actor from a great one.
1940;But this was a really good version of the book.
1941;He plays the perfect man, with the perfect body, that is living out the American dream of fame and fortune.
1942;He eats people and smears them on the walls of his apartment.
1943;worth checking out, in my opinion.
1944;Another aspect is that each actor or actress works very well in his or her part, each showing the total insignificance of one person to the other in the corrupt business world of the 1980s.
1945;the 1980s are captured very well in this film.
1946;"this film works very well on three levels: first as a satire of the Yuppie Wallstreet era of the 1980s
1947;if you like dark comedies much like Evil Dead II and Fight Club, then you'll probably enjoy American Psycho.
1948;Christian Bale is perfect for this role.
1949;He is genius in this.
1950;genre' type of movies, but it can appeal to so many tastes.
1951;Its kinda twisted and naughty but great at the same time.
1952;it is amazing how well the book translates onto the screen!
1953;Christian Bale did a very good job.
1954;It was very thought provoking, gory at times.
1955;It takes place during the 80's and just as in the book, the movie focuses on greed.
1956;Drugs, clubbing, eating expensive food, and keeping yourself looking good.
1957;It was done with a satire feel, which in itself was interesting and original, but was odd and made you think twice about what you were watching.
1958;Bale does a fabulous job with the role, playing a serial killer/business man to the T .
1959;It was a good movie, you just have to keep an open mind while watching it.
1960;This is one of my Favorite Christian Bale movies, It makes me laugh soo much.
1961;Each time you will pick up subtle humor along with enough high tech murder to satisfy all cravings.
1962;the movie was shipped and received within a few days .
1963;Although its gruesome murders drew feminist fire and made headlines and best.
1964;But the filmmakers have more than thrills in mind.
1965;They tip their hand with a credit sequence that draws us into a high rise world of sleek bodies and correct addresses.
1966;Yes, but this is a serious movie with serious themes and a serious actor, Christian Bale, wielding the weapons.
1967;His telephone confession near the end is a sensational piece of film acting.
1968;A great black comedy/satire of men's vanity and the 80's Wall Street lifestyle!
1969;Christian Bale's dynamite performance gives it a big boost.
1970;I'll start this review like I started other reviews: I absolutly love this movie!
1971;Any way the movie is funny, gory, clever, and inspiring, to me anyway.
1972;You have to be a person of a certain mind state to understand this movie, and therefore appreciate the dark humor.
1973;The movie makes a fine addition to my collection and definetly, certifies christian bale as one of the best actors of our generation.
1974;I've seen it 15 times and still love it.
1975;If you are checking the reviews on this movie means you like this type of movie.
1976;Having read and enjoyed the novel, I had no idea what to expect of the movie.
1977;But the movie for the most well catches the flavor and themes of the book, and replays some of the best parts of the novel.
1978;a highlight of the movie.
1979;The extras are extensive, and the documentaries are well worth watching.
1980;Christian Bale is one the greatest actors of my generation.
1981;Convincing on a level worthy of sincere respect and admiration.
1982;Although I was immediately smitten with the GORGEOUS Christian Bale (just to check out his perfect body is worth the price of the film!)
1983;As you watch Bale move through the movie, it is obvious he is one of the great acting talents of today.
1984;What a contrasting transformation Bale makes from his role in the wonderful movie Little Women as the suffering and love struck wanna be beau of Jo .
1985;The movie has it's moments, though, and several times I caught myself sitting up straight and paying attention!
1986;A campy, scary, funny film!
1987;and pasted together, the characters and events completely interchangeable.
1988;Ellis has trouble writing actual stories.
1989;But he has some literary gifts: he can compose witty dialogue, composes apt descriptions of settings, and is a decent expository writer.
1990;It is of course this gift that made his book such a notorious success.
1991;It was bound to be made into a movie, and, to the delight and chagrin of many, it was.
1992;The movie, however, is very good.
1993;She cuts out scenes, moving dialogue freely from one character to another, moving action from one location to another.
1994;She has eliminated all the book's novelistic pretension and fashioned a film of visual elegance and sly wit from the remains.
1995;right off the bat, Ellis' infuriating digressions on attire are easily disposed of by, well, the very medium of film.
1996;in addition, the book's amusing but context.
1997;free essays on pop music are woven into the film's story as eerily out.
1998;christian Bale's performance as Patrick Bateman is a tour de force of smugness.
1999;His delivery of Bateman is sheer hyperbole, a caricature of the voice of a spoiled urban prep.
2000;Seeing as how we cannot make violence truly horrifying again when seen on film, it is refreshing to see work by people who at least know how to make it entertaining.
2001;This was a great movie.
2002;This is the first movie I've seen him in, and I look forward to seeing him again.
2003;I found myself glued to the TV listening attentively to this perverted psycho's dialog.
2004;Having never heard anything about it, this movie turned out to be a pleasant surprise.
2005;The script was very well written, and Bale did a great job acting.
2006;This is definitely one of the best movies of all time.
2007;one of bale's best roles!!
2008;twisted and funny at the same time.
2009;Christian Bale brilliant as Patrick Bateman one of the greatest, and handsome, psychopath on movies.
2010;let me tell you something, this is how you do a character development story.
2011;This is also how you throw the audience in for a ride and make them squirm in their seats.
2012;this movie did an excellent job of building suspense and then giving you a satisfying conclusion to the suspense.
2013;It delivers in full impact.
2014;the movie also did an excellent job of capturing what I guess is the theme of the novel (never read it myself).
2015;That everyone is so self absorbed with themselves, their money, their power, their things, their looks, which ultimately makes you feel disgusted with their society.
2016;He's definitely a villain that you can love to hate.
2017;Some of the stuff certainly got laugh out loud funny and ludicrous.
2018;But in the end, the film really delivers one heck of an experience.
2019;Any movie that I'm happy to see over and over again gets a 5 stars.
2020;ultimately, the film was fascinating to watch and had me engrossed from the start.
2021;Definitely give it a watch if you've not seen it.
2022;Simply put, American Psycho is one of the greatest mind games ever put on film.
2023;The beauty of this film is in the mystery.
2024;Christian Bale puts in a stellar performance as the delusional madman.
2025;you must see this film if you are a true afficionado of great film.
2026;In """"Deathwish"""" a respectable citizen in New York City forsakes the law to secretly kill criminal scumbags in the name of justice"
2027;so the film starts off with a strike against it, but then I found myself getting into the story, meaning I was entertained, and that's the name of the game in cinema.
2028;"thankfully, ""American Psycho"" has meaning beyond the surface."
2029;I was looking forward to a cool, brilliant, classy, savage satire on yuppiedom, but I think most of the rest of the audience were hoping for a slasher movie.
2030;He also wanted to cast Leonard DiCaprio, who at the time was one of the biggest stars in the world.
2031;That he had to remake his body and create the accent from the ground up suits the character perfectly.
2032;"model relish with which Bale delivers lines like ""The Mud Soup with Charcoal Arugula is outrageous!"""
2033;is a sight to behold.
2034;"(""Hey,"" says Patrick with sweet reasonableness, ""cool it with the anti."
2035;Probably only women could be so funny about how insane men can get.
2036;Bale is brilliant in the scene, even strangely touching, but as a piece of writing (and a moment of utter faithfulness to the book) you can't help wondering whether these people want to make some good satire or just.yawn.
2037;"Still, it's one of the best movies about the 80s, and knocks something like ""Wall Street"" out of the water."
2038;this has to be one of the better recent films i have seen.
2039;the film had attracted a lot of controversy, so i figured what the heck, i'll go.
2040;but the violence is just so funny.
2041;i, honestly, have never seen a funnier portrayal of yuppies than in this film.
2042;See it for Bale's great performance, compare with Fight Club , The Talented Mr. Ripley Rope and any Pee Wee Herman tape.
2043;This is in my top 10 favorite movies so I won't write too much on the movie itself and its also 14 years old, so most people who have wanted to see the movie have already done so.
2044;the acting by Bale and even by the supporting cast were great.
2045;I love the movie along with the book and the only complaint I would have with the movie itself is the ending.
2046;The picture was better than expected and the audio is really good, not as strong as the picture, but still very good.
2047;Christian Bale constantly makes you question your sexuality.
2048;The plot is good too.
2049;Bale gives possibly the best performance of his career.
2050;One of the best book to movie adaptations ever made.
2051;Funny, gory, clever, well written dialogue and fantastic acting.
