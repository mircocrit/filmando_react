id;spiegazione
1;TO someone who fears being in a trench, fears having bullets fired at him, fears rotting anonymously, it's a story worth telling.
2;they are human, they're scared, the events are harrowing, and to reflect that, the cinematography is neither slow nor ponderous it's appropriately surreal.
3;This film beatifully captures the psychological aspects of war and envokes thinking and emotion and therefore goes farther and deeper and is more meaningful than any other war film ever made to this point.
4;Not so much about WW2 in the pacific then about the cruelty of war in general, this poetic film is a sad but perfect retelling of all wars.
5;A tragic tale that leaves one breathless.
6;This film better portrayed the horror of the unexpected than did Saving Private Ryan, and it had far superior scenery and cinematography.
7;Martin Scorsese, one of the greatest directors ever to breath, stood firm in naming The Thin Red Line as one of the top ten most important films of the 1990's.
8;the Thin Red line is an incredible achievement.
9;But, for these reasons, I love it more.
10;And as a nod to the individuals that rated this as a glorious film and made disparaging remarks as to the intellectual capacity of those who dare think other than they, yes, we one stars do read.
11;i will say the cast is excellent, and it is entertaining to see so many A list actors in once film, also be prepared for some cameo's from other big actors.
12;I paid 5$, it's well worth it.
13;only watched part of it then it got sickning expecily since i got done watching all the true ones adam
14;This is a fact that Malick understands perfectly, based on James Jones stunningly gripping novel, THE THIN RED LINE is a multi.
15;it's been a while since I have seen such a powerful story told so well, from John Toll's amazing Oscar nominated photography, to Malick's own direction.
16;With a powerful cast of actors, including outstanding performances by Ben Chaplin, Sean Penn, Nick Nolte, Jim Caviezel and Elias Koteas, this is a movie that deserves to be seen time and time again.
17;The image is crisp and clear with no visible artifacts.
18;Although not specified on the sleeve's specs, the 2.35:1 widescreen ratio features a gorgeous anamorphic transfer.
19;Still, the movie speaks for itself and I highly, highly recommend it.
20;Of all the war movies, that I have seen, I would rate this one as one of the best.
21;This movie shows war from a personal perspective with much work done in showing the soldiers emotions and their dilemmas of conscience.
22;Good acting and one where Sean Penn stood out as an actor for me.
23;As true artists do, Terrence Malick holds on tight to his obsessions.
24;His humanist approach seems to me to be truly sincere, and I think that's what I valued most of all in this movie.
25;perhaps less idealistic, more unforgiving.
26;but what they ultimately share is their concern for all things human in the context of war.
27;The movie has moments of inmense aesthetic beauty, the mixture of spell.
28;binding music and gorgeous images, the constant use of metaphores, the outstanding performances by all the cast and an intense and thought.
29;provoking story, all contribute to make it the best film I've seen in a very long time.
30;rarely,if ever, have I encouneterd such meditative beauty in a film.
31;This is a movie that 3o years fron now people will still be examining,probing.
32;The cinematography is simeply Brilliant, the acting from the magnificent Sean penn,through a surprising Woody Harrelson,are uniformly excellent.
33;The soundtrack, haunting,hauntinglelanesian chants,will stay will you for quite awhile.
34;he has filmed his masterpiece, a movie I truly feel that can stand on almost any level with any movie I have ever seen.
35;do yourself a huge favor and watch this movie.
36;it will pay great dividends.
37;It will be as big a cinematic culture shock if there was any, and you just might come away surprised at what's in your head by the time the end credit rolls.
38;It's not the grandest action war movie ever made, but it is on par with Apocalypse Now as one of the most thoughtful and introspective films ever made about the nature of war and quite explicitly, nature itself.
39;This is one of those movies where it is a singular piece of work.
40;seriously those are great movies, but in the end they have limited replay value.
41;When you've seen them a certain amount of times, you've hit the ceiling.
42;There's nothing you can take away from them except for just being diverting time killers and saying to yourself oh that was fun .
43;But sometimes I want art to challenge me.
44;And the most incredible aspect about it is that its accessible on an emotional level.
45;And to me that is its greatest accomplishment.
46;Seriously if this is one of those movies that has passed you by, give it a shot.
47;This film , I believe, is one of the greatest motion pictures ever made, and it is safe to say it will never be surpassed.
48;The story explores the thoughts and lives of American soldiers on Guadalcanal, an island over which the U. s. fought the Japanese during the Second World War.
49;Excellent cinematography as well as great acting add to make this beautiful movie one of the most memorable I ever saw.
50;An all star cast and a great novel make The Thin Red Line the unique film it is.
51;Each film had it's own agenda!
52;Ryan true was probably more realistic.
53;Maybe they feel if they make the movie long they have a epic masterpiece on their hands.
54;And in many cases a BORING one!
55;But still a film people should see.
56;SPR was a sentimental story of heroism, with evil Germans and noble Americans.
57;There are battle scenes and realistic gore, but the film is about who we are and why we fight, how we can find and be so barbaric in a world of such great natural beauty.
58;the cinematography, which includes gorgeous shot after gorgeous shot, is outstanding.
59;Worth watching with the volume off.
60;Malick, working with John Toll, created I brilliant film that takes the guise of war as its structure only to transcend into very real questions of philosophy.
61;Malick is a brilliant man (just look at his accomplishments in the world of scholars) and he created something here.
62;Every actor in the movie played to their strengths without overly drawing attention to them selves.
63;Saving private Ryan, Platoon, and others are also great .
64;You can tell how great and daring this movie is just by reading the reviews.
65;And how many are now considered classics?
66;Any movie that sparks this kind of dissent is something special and should be treasured.
67;the movie itself is good, senses are beautiful, but sometimes it can get boring, and unclear.
68;The movie and its display was very good.
69;It is thought provoking, has character development and excellent acting.
70;which is such an excellent movie by the way.
71;Right after it ended, my friend said, I want to see it again with the sound off, so I can just look at the images.
72;One of my favorite movies ever.
73;This movie is philosophical, emotional, human .
74;more about life on Earth, life as a human being, than it is about war.
75;Terence Malick delivers unforgettable scenery as well as undetectable acting by Hollywood's greatest stars.
76;His dichotomy created by a juxtaposed paradise in nature and the demolition of war seduces the viewer gradually and builds without histrionics or grandiose theatrics.
77;True cinematic adventures or risks should force us to ask these types of questions instead of preaching.
78;Beautifully filmed and thought provoking.
79;If you like to think, this is the best war film made to date.
80;first, let me say that the cinematography was excellent in this film.
81;Many truly breathtaking shots all around.
82;The combat scenes were generally well done and believable for the most part.
83;The acting was pretty good on most counts and for my money the most memorable performance from the film was that of Nick Nolte as a commander without the true ability to be a leader.
84;A perfect example is how near the end of the film we all of a sudden see John Cusack appear on screen seemingly from nowhere and lead a heroic charge to take over an enemy position.
85;Although it is not supposed to be a typical war movie it still has a good amount of combat footage in it.
86;in conclusion, go to the dentist and have a root canal because you'll enjoy that more than this movie.
87;This movie was head and shoulders above Saving Private Ryan.
88;the reason this film excels is because it has value after more than one viewing.
89;The message it is trying to send is subtle and hidden.
90;you will have to think a little and then it will come.
91;Another reason why this movie is so good is because you can find your own message in it.
92;This is proven through John Toll's excellent cinematography that captures the beautiful yet fragile flora and fauna that the war is slowly and sadly destroying.
93;pounding scores (The Peacemaker, The Rock) and an entry into subtle background music.
94;another strong point of this movie is that it is many stories in one.
95;Hard to enjoy, but easy to appreciate.
96;That is perhaps the best description I can think of for The Thin Red Line.
97;This is one of the most realistic pictures you will ever see!
98;poetic monologues at the drop of a hat?And people find this film deep and profound?
99;Yet I liked both Saving Private Ryan and The Thin Red Line.
100;the film is visually stunning and truly grabs the viewer's attention.
101;It showed how the interpersonal relationships that each character has with himself, nature and his comrades in arms.
102;The film was rated R, after all.
103;Gene Siskel felt this was the best contemporary war movie he ever saw.
104;The voice of a much older person.
105;Michel Chion writes about this eloquently in his book.
106;He goes into great details of each character's inner voice.
107;It seemed like he took the tone of the narration and moved it from the Texas wheat fields to this island in the Pacific and yet he's asking the same questions.
108;the battle scenes were nothing but superb!
109;The vivid scenery, the musings of the soldiers as well as the individual shots of wounded and angry wildlife.
110;i highly recommend this movie and I'm proud to have been the 535th person to rate it Five Stars and the 1067th overall.
111;He was able to translate the words of the Japanese soldiers that surrounded Witt at the end of the movie!
112;Chion's book is the perfect companion piece to this movie.
113;All of his reviews are timeless.
114;"outs to be entertained"" manifesto."
115;I shed real tears of emotion at Daniel Day.
116;"lewis's portrayal of Daniel Plainview in ""There Will Be Blood""."
117;This film is a work of art.
118;tHE BEST FILM OF ALL TIME doesnt even describe this movie well enough.
119;He is far more poetic and artistic and experimental than your average director.
120;Malick is a true auteur.
121;He has a signature style, visual and fluid and spiritual.
122;He reminds me in a way of Wong Kar Wai.
123;His films speak volumes without technically `saying' a whole lot.
124;For me, I have films from him that I love, and then I have films from him that I don't think worked entirely well.
125;but we're here to talk about `The Thin Red Line', which is possibly Malick's greatest cinematic achievement and, quite honestly, one of the greatest films ever made.
126;"as I've expanded my cinematic knowledge, there was always one film that many of my cinephile friends continually placed in their top ten lists
127;Sure, there are some great filmmakers who have elevated the genre and created some iconic films.
128;`Apocalypse Now', `Full Metal Jacket', `Platoon' and `Jarhead' are all marvelous films that get into the heart of war from a more personal and intimate nature.
129;I had seen Spielberg's `Saving Private Ryan', released the same year, and was far from impressed (lazy, scattered, shallow.yet beautifully framed and that initial sequence is a stunner).
130;so that brings me to finally seeing this film.
131;I'll just say this"
132;The film is that rapturous.
133;Using vivid imagery and beautifully poetic sequences, Malick coaxes out of his film a feeling of earthy longing.
134;He tugs at the core of us.
135;Many have dismissed this (so sad) because of the unconventional delivery, but to those who have embraced this film, it has become a shining gem.
136;Sean Penn is fantastic in his few scenes, as is Elias Koteas, and Miranda Otto is stunning in her elongated flashback sequences.
137;if you are looking for a beautifully tailored film that uses war as a way to embellish the spiritual journey of self.
138;discovery and the evolution of life itself.
139;"Narrated with poetic discussions by emotionally wounded men, `The Thin Red Line' is not only one of the best war films ever made
140;I want to like this movie!
141;I really want to like it!
142;I am a life long fan of the James Jones novel, and I was deeply anticipating this film.
143;I liked Malick's other films, and I think he shot this movie beautifully and majestically.
144;At times, it is a poignant, and fulfilling movie.
145;The star of the film is the island, and that would be fine, if it were a painting.
146;though I know most of the reviewers will disagree with me here, SaAVING PRIVATE RYAN is a far better film, a far grittier film, a more realistic and purposeful film.
147;Better message, better directing, better movie.
148;This is a good movie.
149;Its from the soldiers heart and their minds duh.
150;Yeah its not all guts and blood, but its real.
151;I have watched Badlands and Days of Heaven which are both excellent but I honestly prefer The Thin Red Line .
152;first of all, the acting is awesome in this movie.
153;Jim Caviezel, Sean Penn and Nick Nolte are all very soulful.
154;Even John Cusack (I love him in everything) and Woody Harrelson do very well in their smaller parts.
155;but the true power of this movie is in the questions that it asks.
156;I love the mysticism that fills the whole film.
157;the fact is that this movie is very spiritual and beautiful even as it faces the reality of suffering and evil.
158;The cinematography, music and acting are awesome.
159;Not just one of the best movies of the 90's, this is probably one of the best of all time.
160;making, hypnotic and beguiling .
161;set aside a couple of hours for this one, cause it takes its sweet time.
162;those who had read Tolkein, and those who had yet to do so.
163;Thin Red Line is as good a place as any to start.
164;the cinematography is truly stunning, and it is really for that that this film received two of its stars.
165;The first two or so hours are this objective, a physical progression of the story.
166;but i will point out a couple of things: (1) the soldiers in this movie are believable because they show us their FEAR.
167;Days of Heaven is a profound movie.
168;He's only made three films, but there is no doubt among discerning people his films are art and worthy of acclaim, period.
169;If you're going to trash a movie, you need to either start with at least ONE good point about it OR give solid, well.
170;Great acting and great cinematography.
171;It is true that there is a place for both genres in this world, but those that enjoy war movies are not going to enjoy this type of movie.
172;'Saving Private Ryan' for the most part has a linear narrative with straighforward goals.
173;Thus, its drive comes from emotional power.
174;Malick achieves this with an impact that is frightening.
175;The main battle scene is super intense with changes from slo.
176;mo to regular pace and exchanges in foregrounded/backgrounded music and sound .
177;however, the reaction from this scene is even better with sweeping camera fluidity, a touching score, and poetic narration that it virtually transcends the physical world.
178;and that's good enough for me!After repeated viewings on video, I finally got to see the film on the big screen last week and was as moved (if not more) as the first time I saw it.
179;Our troops are advancing on Guadalcanal.
180;The point of view of the foot soldier is utterly stark and terrifying.
181;For this achievement, the film deserves its first two stars.
182;The neighborhood bar has more insights.
183;Nick Nolte tries his screaming best to be a tough leader, but you keep thinking what a good acting job he's doing, and this isn't what you should be thinking"
184;a great sense of conveying mood.
185;i waited for this one to come out, as I liked the original version, with Kier Dullea.
186;But I wanted to see what Mallick would do with the material at hand and one of my favorite genres.
187;His previous films Badlands and Days of heaven were both brilliant and ok in that order.
188;Sift through the voiceovers and the distracting opening segment and some annoying characters and you will find a wonderful and genuinely frightening main sequence.
189;This is breathtaking because it is shot an awful lot from the soldier's point of view.
190;And what do we see.
191;Then all hell breaks out and suddenly we have an entertaining movie on our hands.
192;This is what we have been waiting for and this section of the film is the redeeming factor of the whole movie and is worth seeing alone.
193;One other redemption is the movie's portrayal of the Japanese soldier.
194;He is presented as human, as frail, as violent and as corrupt as the US soldiers on the same Island.
195;This film is the best war film of the last few years (Black Hawk Down not included).
196;It is far better than Saving Ryan's Private's.
197;This film is one of my all.
198;he has a whole two minute scene in this three hour film!)
199;the slow, poetic opening establishes the elegaic mood that pervades this movie, aided by voice.
200;overs and a one of the loveliest soundtracks of recent years.
201;Malick has a great gift for revealing the natural world on film (first evident in the breathtaking Days of Heaven of long ago), and he does it in The Thin Red Line.
202;there is an undertow of profound sadness to this movie, which is sustained by the haunting soundtrack and the wonderful characterizations.
203;I think this film ranks with The Rules of the Game and Paths of Glory in terms of artistic achievement.
204;The stories told here are the lasting ones, the ones left after the dead are buried and the parades have ended.
205;This film shows the true experience during World War II.
206;The film is loaded with drama and action and is worth seeing if you haven't experienced this wonderful touching war film yet.
207;A realistic and disturbing film, sure.
208;End of story, right there.
209;They ALWAYS give the main characters a distinct and important purpose.
210;At the end of the film, said purpose is accomplished by the main characters which will give most viewers satisfying closure to the what they just seen.
211;Each individual wonders how he will hold up when the bullets start flying.
212;Each man wonders if he will survive.
213;Though the battle is fought by many men, the movie leaves you with one realization.
214;If you enjoy watching the fuzz on channel 1, then perhaps this movie is for you (they both have the same entertainment value).
215;But I'm a fan of it.
216;The picture is just about perfect.
217;As good as the video is, the sound is better, it handles the the quiet scenes and the musical score with finesse and the explosions are awesome.
218;Extras are very good as well, including the booklet and the various video supplements.
219;If I wanted to watch a documentary on the beautiful wildlife of the Southeast Asian Region I would have tuned in to the Discovery Channel.
220;One moment these guys are on the beach.
221;a mesmerizingly beautiful film on life, death, love, and the senselessness of war.
222;While the film traces several characters it's amazing how you're left with a lasting impression of the interior landscapes of each and every one.
223;The film is both spiritual meditation and a completely corporal rendition of the atrocities of warfare.
224;The Thin Red Line is far more than a war film and a supreme masterpiece of film making.
225;It is a moving statement of the human condition, the dilemma of the mind.
226;chain existence in the midst of the ravishing beauty of Creation.
227;Director Malick leaves us with the men who survived because of Witt's sacrifice and with these accusatory words on God's horrors, Oh my soul be in me now, look out of my eyes, look out at all the things you made, all things shining.
228;It is a fairly long movie with a complex structure, but its rewards are many.
229;Beautifully shot in the South Pacific, and featuring brilliant performances by an all.
230;star cast, this is a film that probes deep philosophical issues while following the paths of soldiers engaged in the battle for Guadalcanal in WWII.
231;Both use the context of war as a theatre in which to explore some of the central issues of mankind .
232;There are few other movies as deeply packed with philosophical baggage, and were it not for the frequent pauses where the camera simply lingers on scenery and wildlife, or follows the quiet moments in the characters lives, this movie would surely overwhelm most audiences.
233;This is a potentially fine film completely ruined by force.
234;fed intellectualism and miles of excessive footage best left on the cutting room floor.
235;The closing shot is such a simple yet elegantly powerful image, that it should have left audiences in awed silence.
236;Mallick expertly sets us up for what promises to be great movie moments and then he doesn't deliver.
237;Do NOT convince anyone to watch this with you because George Clooney is in it.
238;They throw their hands up at the first sign of an American soldier without putting up a fight (yeah right!)
239;In addition to all that, the history is all messed up.
240;So it goes with some reviewers of this movie.
241;War is tough is one of the main themes of this movie.
242;Oh look, a pretty butterfly!
243;Oh gee, the light going through that leaf is beautiful!
244;winger or have a thing for looking at the bodies of naked boys, you will love this movie.
245;The characters are real and the plots move the story foreward.
246;"Anyone familiar with James Jones' gripping novel concerning the so. called ""thin red line"" between one's war experience and madness must appreciate the stunning accuracy with which the latest film version of this frightening psychodrama plays itself into the experiences of a group of soldiers about to go into battle at Guadalcanal."
247;History buffs familiar with the literature (both fiction and non.
248;Although one is comically absurd and the other courageous, both are intensely unlike the circumstances anyone would experience anywhere else but in combat.
249;all that said, the film is a very sophisticated exploration of man's humanity and inhumanity under circumstances so bizarre and unusual that one must suspend one's ordinary consciousness in order to survive.
250;The cinematography is marvelous, and even in the most gruesome and violent scenes, one gets the feeling all of this is choreographed by someone understanding the power of the camera to catch glimpses of man's essential struggle with himself in those moments he is most desperately trying to stay alive under the most murderous of circumstances.
251;verbally about the nature of man, the world we live in, and the incredible things men do to each other in the terrible prism of combat.
252;Instead of being true to the spirit of the work by giving the viewer an honest, gritty portrayal of infantry combat on Guadalcanal, Terrence Malick chose to create some post.
253;The masterful art of James Jones deserves a better effort than this.
254;This film had great potential.
255;The storyline and commentary on war was unique, deep, troubling, and strangly inspirational.
256;For the last half hour I wanted the movie to end.
257;Coming out at the same time as Saving Private Ryan and having top notch stars like Nick Nolte and Sean Penn I highly anticipated watching this movie.
258;buffs want it to be.
259;TRL is a good film.
260;The cinematography is extraordinary, as is the acting and Hans Zimmers score.
261;The bottom line is that SPR is more meaningful than it seems at first sight.
262;in my opinion, the real film, .
263;the film from which watcher benefits.
264;, and ends with peace.
265;Those represent lots of things in the world: bad/good mood, capitalism/religion, believing in career/believing in GOD, living for nothing/living for everything.
266;which is directly threating human life is selected.
267;This production is that rare example of a motion picture as art.
268;It is beautiful, poignant and mystifying.
269;It is a realistic depiction of a drug.
270;addled director's view of Guadalcanal.
271;They are all logical and sophisticated.
272;There is so much meaning and themes in each of the characters.
273;Each of the characters feels real.
274;The music, especially when they are taking over the Japanese base is touching.
275;I still have those Melanesian songs in my head.
276;anyway, I most definitely reccommend this film.
277;He was enthralled by the picture, saying that this was exactly what it was like.
278;And who better to judge than he?Some complain about the big movie stars' minor roles.
279;I believe this works to the movie's advantage.
280;I certainly felt that way in SPR.
281;i'm sorry for making this so long, but I honestly think it's one of the greatest pictures of the decade.
282;But by being unrealistic in appearance, it has become more realistic than any war movie, because it knows that in order for us to feel it, it has to come from inside, from the heart and the soul.
283;Saving Private Ryan 's plot is strong, the characters are strong.
284;There is no structure, but that is how it's most effective.
285;But The Thin Red Line is the one that will strike you more emotionally, because it works from the inside, if only you'd try to appeciate, try not to compare it.
286;Stop holding onto the conventional, just let it flow through you, and you'll experience something truly extraordinary.
287;the music is great,sensitimental,catch me from my soul.
288;unlike other war movies like saving private ryan it has got a universal vision.
289;this is a good movie to watch if there is nothing else on tv.
290;world War II has proven a very elusive subject in all the arts.
291;James Jones had an eye and an ear, a big heart too, but was somewhat hysterical.
292;Sure, some of this is caught and reflected in the picture itself.
293;But it is caught with an extraordinary psychological realism that you at times forget is not live footage.
294;And this is also presented as a true tribute to the fighting men .
295;"there is a lot of talk about the ""greatest generation"" now, we all know."
296;Well, see what James Jones aided by this director Malick shows, how they got that way, and the way they were just before, just after, and during their cataclysmic transformation.
297;Fantastic deep movie on the workings of the inner psyches of those about to die.
298;The dialogue regarding the contrasting philosophies on the meaning of life between Jim Caviezel and Sean Penn truly makes this film.
299;For me, I loved it and saw it a couple of times in the theater.
300;This is a philosophical masterpiece.
301;A painting, if you will, that's open to interpretation.
302;on the other hand, if you've ever been wrapped up in a particular work of art and tried to deduce what the artist is trying to say, you're going to love this picture movie.
303;Fantastic cinematography, music score, and narrative dialogue.
304;one of my top five favorite films.
305;The Thin Red Line is one of the most beautiful and most haunting films ever.
306;John Toll's cinematography is some of the best ever.
307;The images stick with you for weeks after seeing the film.
308;Once again Terrence Malick delivers a deeply philosophical film that is haunting yet immensly beautiful just like his two previous film Badlands, and Days of Heaven (both also amongst the greatest films ever).
309;But it is the Blue Flame that touches the wick, that burns the hottest, that shows the greatest purity.
310;The outer yellow/orange flame, burns, or warms, or gives light, but the blue flame brings the peace, the perspective,the faithfulness that PVT Witt showed.
311;it is the blue flame that gets its strength from the Almighty, It is the blue flame that represents true love, true life, true hope, true strength.
312;"If they could understand the ""bloodline"" they could then understand the Blue Flame of real love, peace, and the Almighty."
313;This is a very moving, beautifully filmed, wonderfully scored work of art.
314;The casting was very interesting.
315;known names and faces show up throughout.
316;"It should be used in more films to add depth and provide more of a what a written novel provides
317;This may be fine for photography students, but for anyone wanting a film that tells a story, look elsewhere.
318;i wonder how do you people give this film any stars .
319;I don't consider myself an artsy type so please don't throw me in that group just cuz i liked the movie.
320;But what makes this movie so incredible is its atmosphere.
321;the astounding cinematography takes you right into the jungle and shows you the thin line between beauty and horror, an island paradise ravaged by war and the effects it has on men.
322;This movie is not about blood and guts"
323;If you haven't read the book it's based on (The Thin Red Line), it is very good at reproducing it.
324;"This is one of the most realistic films you will ever see, and has been called an ""anti anti."
325;An excellent example would be Saving Private Ryan, which I also own.
326;It didn't show war in a vacuum, but rather included war, valor, intensity, nature, spirituality, love, hate, blood, guts, brotherhood, and, if I may say so, excellent battle scenes all in one gritty and moving performance.
327;Terence Malick's masterpiece is a true study in what becomes of men who face combat.
328;all of these things are a part of armed conflict, and Malick explores them without rendering judgment.
329;The beautiful scenery and weather contrasted greatly with the terror that was taking place on the island of Guadalcanal.
330;Really a beautifully directed film.
331;The moment of greatest courage in this film may be when the Captain refuses to accept the order to charge a hill when he knows that it will be a suicide attack that will kill most of his men.
332;Nonetheless it is a beautiful and poetic film about men at their best and worst.
333;Whenever a film strives for philosophical meditation, Americans go wild and run for the exits.
334;first the good: excellent cinematography and a couple of riveting battle scenes.
335;All the while the characters have highly philosophical thoughts presented to the audience via voice.
336;Ok, I've seen and enjoyed Apocalypse Now and highly recommend that movie in place of the Thin Red Line.
337;True, the audio and visuals are stunning, the scene selection feature is nicely done, and it includes standards such as widescreen and alternate language(Spanish) subtitles.
338;It is seldom I find others that enjoyed this movie.
339;I was excited to see this on blue ray and couldnt wait to watch it.
340;If you have not seen this movie give it a shot.
341;I thought it might be mildly interesting, but I was so far from the truth.
342;What a beautiful movie, what an amazing concept.
343;One star for the fan momentum, four stars for the film, and who knows how many stars for the blu.
344;Good movie, my husband especially liked it like most of the war movies we've seen.
345;Would recommend it to my friends.
346;I admit, some of the cinematography was stunning, and the acting was exceptional.
347;I can see why many of the people who enjoyed Saving Private Ryan detested this movie.
348;The former begins with intense and unforgetable realism, while the latter is surreal from start to finish.
349;Tall is in command but he is vulnerable and desparate to accomplish something worthy of promotion.
350;i admire Malick's project but I'm not so sure he pulled it off successfully.
351;This film, at least is original and doesn't try to moralize with the audience.
352;more for our money please.
353;i prefer other WWII movies such as The longest day, Saving Private Ryan, U571, Midway.
354;The book is pretty good to.
355;Glad I was able to replace it.
356;a visual and sensual evocation of both primitive and profound human feelings.
357;When I have enjoyed watching Thin Red Line the most, I have watched with that expectation.
358;Saving Private Ryan , while certainly also portraying the human emotions involved with war (most brilliantly and realistically, fear), was more concerned with gritty realism.
359;Private Ryan has the gritty realism of a documentary.
360;Both methods have an undeniable effect.
361;but please, folks, don't delude the readers with the idea that one of these two films is better than the other.
362;i rate the film as one of the best war films primarily because of its depiction of fear, courage and the brutality of war.
363;First Sgt. Welsh (Sean Penn) carries the burden of providing the structure for the story's (film's) theme .
364;Nick Nolte gives an excellent performance as the hard.
365;The rest of the cast does splendid work and the cinematography is exceptional.
366;this film will always be compared with Saving Private Ryan.
367;In my view this is a good thing, yet i think it may throw some viewers off.
368;In fact, much like the New World, Mother Nature is the main character in this film, which i find delightful.
369;When he finally reappeared in 1998 to direct this adaptation of James Jones's novel about the Battle of Guadalcanal in World War II, many actors were desperate to work with him and he was able to gather a large ensemble cast.
370;Eventually US forces are able to overcome Japanese positions, and the Japanese side of the offensive is depicted with more fairness and equanimity than in most American films on the Pacific Theatre of the war.
371;while the realistic depiction of battle might touch viewers .
372;There are also featurettes on the actors involved, the casting process, the editing of the film and then some historical news footage on Guadalcanal.
373;That's a considerable amount of commentary and behind.
374;Highly recommended for anyone desiring to see the ugly conflict between life and death.
375;Good for the philosophically minded.
376;is a positive first step.your attention span CAN BE lengthened with some effort.your video games and sitcoms are calling.
377;Anyway, this movie is long but has a good story and lots of action.
378;Personally, I rate a movie based on how it holds up over time.
379;I saw this movie when it was released in the theaters and loved it, and I just watched it again years later and loved it even more.
380;This movie takes it's time.
381;whoever did the chopping did a damn fine job.
382;I can watch this one throughout my life and see something relevant.
383;The film is however almost saved by it's quite breathtaking look.
384;Clearly, this is visual direction and camerwork at it's best and the sheer beauty of the images is enough to distratct from the often plodding pace.
385;The cast includes a suprising number of star names in small roles and their minimal screen time re.
386;inforces the impression of the transient nature of intense relationships between troops in combat.
387;The all round excellent performances of the cast together with the many powerful images almost suceed in lifting the whole film to the level of greatness but sadly not quite.
388;1)Malick is a great director.
389;the Criterion version makes it even better.
390;I saw Private Ryan and loved it .
391;Jim Caviezel's performance is good, but his role (as of others in this movie) too modern and pacifist for the 1942 WWII situation where the Axis powers' threat to the freedom and peace of the entire world was real and well perceived.
392;All the characters in the 1964 original are believable, especially Keir Dullea's unforgettable performance at Pvt. Doll.
393;I also recommend the 1943 film Guadalcanal Diary to real WWII buffs.
394;Which is fine with me.
395;"But it truly is 180 degrees away from some infantile art movie
396;the good: a portrayal of the disruption suffered by the native Melanesians during the conflict, and the idealistic lifestyle that they seemed to lead in their 'paradise' (not necessarily accurate for the Solomons), an aspect that was usually overlooked in prosecuting the Pacific War.
397;i haven't read the book for many years, but recall it as a more complex story than the movie, for all the latter's excellent filmography.
398;It strikes me that profound notions about philosophy form the moral core of this impressive film.
399;But this is much more than a person.
400;Try to understand that it's perfectly acceptable to leave a film with more questions than answers.
401;When I first watched Terrence Malick's 1998 film, The Thin Red Line, over a decade ago, it was clear that the film was great, and so was its director.
402;Nonetheless, I immediately felt that sort of pleasure seep into one, knowing that this artist knows exactly what he is doing, and it will be something very good, or even better.
403;That's a surefire marker of greatness.
404;the Thin Red Line ranks with Paths Of Glory and Apocalypse Now as amongst the greatest American war films ever made.
405;It is a masterpiece that really has no flaws.
406;Sometimes prescience has its benefits.
407;i would say that this is easily the best WWII film ever made.
408;Poetic storytelling, impressive battles, wonderful cinematography and great acting compliment this masterpiece.
409;I know that everyone wants to hear how great a movie is.
410;With 7 Academy Award Nominations including Best Picture, a cast that includes many of the top names in Hollywood, and a huge budget, the bar was set pretty high.
411;Up until lately, I agreed with most other people that Steven Spielberg's film was more more appealing than this Terrence Malick movie.
412;I find both of them fascinating.
413;Spiritual matters are discussed by Believers and non.
414;it's pretty heady stuff, as it turns out, and pretty such sums up this film which, of course is rich in visuals.
415;The scenery, much of it filmed in either Australia or the Solomon Islands, is just gorgeous, just the kind Malick loves.
416;A true lover of nature, Malick gives us one spectacular scene after another with all the greens of grasses, tress and leaves you'd ever want to see, complemented by an assortment of exotic birds and reptiles.
417;It's just stunning in parts.
418;It's better than what first meets the eye!
419;God this should have won some awards.
420;Malick has always followed his own muse and does so with the skill of a master filmmaker with his """"adaptation"""" of The Thin Red Line."""
421;malick uses the book as a starting point, a springboard for which to launch his own thematically pre.
422;TRL shows that even while we are killing each other off, nature will still survive and continue on regardless if we are still around to see it.
423;Malick also explores the duality of man .
424;above all else, this is an absolutely stunning film to look at.
425;if you like challenging war films then this is definitely worth a look.
426;This is one of two movies that I have ever wanted to leave the theater mid way through.
427;if you like extremely dramatic movies that are more interested in showing you mostly nature footage, then you may like this.
428;Those movies had well written stories, great acting and plenty of appropriate action.
429;moving film that places many demands on the time and awareness of a viewer.
430;telling the sometimes brutal and often intensely introspective story of the men of a US Army company in the thick of the fight in the Guadalcanal campaign, The Thin Red Line is mostly told within the interior monologues of its primary participants.
431;The narrative technique allows the story itself to be the real star of The Thin Red Line rather than those who act within it, and this rare achievement is integral to what raises this film above so many others both within the war genre and outside it.
432;As with all Terrence Malick productions that I've seen, the pace of the unfolding plot allows time for the setting to manifest with at least equal importance to the story or the human actors.
433;additionally, the music in The Thin Red Line also stuns with its glorious power.
434;It is also a straightforward story of the reaction of humans separated from those they have known in their familiar lives, now facing the threat of direct extinction, which imposes states of hyper.
435;It is unlike anything else done in American cinema in the 1990's, and it is a true achievement in excellence.
436;set in the second world war it deals with a group of American soldiers whose mission it is to win a sub.
437;Furthermore the portrayal of his disaffected, uncompromising Lt. Col. Tall are well realised.
438;overall this is a well balanced cast whose solid teamwork effectively conveys the mood of the collective war experience.
439;I read James Jones' book many years ago, but found it a memorable account of the fighting on Guadalcanal.
440;Director Terrence Malick did a masterful job of capturing Jones' essence in this film.
441;Yet the cinematography is breathtaking.
442;The juxtaposition of beauty and agony is gripping.
443;The philosophical thoughts by some of the characters was an intriguing ingredient, but again, echoed Jones' writing.
444;For war film junkies or WWII buffs, this is a must.
445;The Thin Red Line, in my opinion, is a masterpiece, an atmospheric and poetic war drama, possibly one of the best movies of the 90's.
446;Saving Private Ryan is a war movie, and a great one at that.
447;The end is very good, and sad.
448;def via Netflix)and it is one of my favorites.
449;Best Director?After watching it, you realize, if you were trying to get a WWII film fix, you sure as hell weren't going to get it here.
450;i really wanted to enjoy this movie because of all the wonderful things I had heard about it.
451;I found myself happily dozing during the middle scenes of this film.
452;despite my best attempts to keep my eyes open.
453;The characters have voice overs that shed light into the introspection of a soldier which mimic the inner.
454;monologue of noteworthy films as Full Metal Jacket and Apocolypse Now.
455;the character whom Nick Nolte plays is interesting as well.
456;and they certainly have the cast credentials to make it.
457;malick has everything at his disposal: a stellar cast, immaculate production design and magnificent, almost.
458;exquisite cinematography by John Toll.
459;screen on the soundtrack (as in Wim Wender's Wings of Desire) sound like they came right off the notebook pages of a lofty.
460;trade, what he's clearly most interested in about the filmmaking process and what he excels at .
461;with a cast this impressive, some of the performances are bound to be superlative, and Nick Nolte and Elias Koteas have the best exchanges.
462;bests and deserved Oscar nominations.
463;Ben Chaplin also does fine work as Private Bell, a soldier who vests his moment.
464;As the one closest resembling a lead character in this ensemble piece, Jim Caviezel's Private Witt never moves beyond his doe.
465;Sean Penn, whose courageous performance in Brian De Palma's criminally underrated Casualties of War cut right to the most horrifyingly inhuman physical and psychological aspects of war, is given the standard old world.
466;Penn, the incomparably gifted actor's actor who delights in discovering new surprises in all in his characters, is here denied the opportunity to find any.
467;Part of why I responded to Malick's latest movie, the underrated The New World, and his previous movies Badlands and Days of Heaven, more positively than this movie was because Malick wasn't afraid of spending time in the presence of female characters (Q'Orianka Kilcher's Pocahontas, Sissy Spacek's Holly, Brooke Adam's Abby, respectively) and taking more than a passing interest in their points of view.
468;fat to stand up straight, hold his own, to speak up for his men and his homeland, to proudly represent Japanese identity in return?There is also a moment right after the final assault on the Japanese hilltop bunker that is deeply disturbing: an infuriated, hot.
469;tempered American soldier beats up two Japanese prisoners.
470;meditating on the eternally heart.
471;Maybe this is a movie we should all watch again with our country's present situation.
472;I found The Thin Red Line to be a very powerful and moving picture.
473;It is a great film.
474;This is the truest antiwar film I've ever seen.
475;At first the shifting narration is tough to get used to, but in the end it makes for a deep understanding of the film's themes.
476;style grand action happens in the movie.
477;There are intermittent bombings and Japanese attacks, including a fairly exciting river.
478;chase scene toward the end of the movie, but more of the film is quiet contemplation, conversation, and exploration of the jungle.
479;The real meat of the movie is in the emotions experienced by the characters.
480;another amazing aspect of the film is the visual presentation.
481;Never before have I seen such amazing locations in any film.
482;Rolling grassy hilltops for miles, shafts of light penetrating the jungle canopy, sunset on the mountain top, and other amazing images fill the screen from beginning to end.
483;Every frame of this movie is a work of art.
484;If losing any possible extras is the price we have to pay to have such a perfect transfer of this film, it is most certainly worth it.
485;A large part of the enjoyment in the film is in the visuals, and Fox has done a great job in preserving them for the home release.
486;I have a pretty scrutinizing eye, and I was only able to see a little bit of artifacting and mosaic at brief moments in the darker and more action.
487;That is actually amazing considering the length of the movie and the complexity of the visual information, which is ever.
488;the sound is actually pretty impressive as well.
489;Some believe the whizzing bullets and exciting explosions of Saving Private Ryan to be the quintessential Dolby Digital war film experience.
490;The soundtrack is rich with the subtle sounds of jungle life, and it accurately represents the human voices in this largely quiet movie.
491;The surround channels aren't used nearly as much as in Saving Private Ryan (or at least not as overtly), but when they are, you certainly know it.
492;The movie has very quiet moments and thunderously loud ones, and both are represented in DD with excellent precision and balance.
493;DTS is always just that little bit better, and it can only enhance the depth of the sonic experience.
494;well, I hope my meandering has been helpful.
495;if you're a war movie fan, or even if you're just a fan of damn good movies, you definitely want to check this out.
496;It provides a great counterpoint to Saving Private Ryan, and it's so engrossing that you won't notice the length much.
497;It's an emotionally and intellectually stimulating film, and on top of that its beautiful imagery and rich sound will give your system a real workout.
498;Definitely worth the price tag.
499;Japanese soldiers practiced cannibalism on American prisoners, cutting them open while alive and removing their liver to be eaten with sake.
500;good pacifist, nature lover person.
501;"In ""Saving Private Ryan,"" viewers just innately new that this movie represented much more closely the emotions and feelings of the participants."
502;"So much of the first part of the ""Thin Red Line"" movie is nature vs industrialized man, sensitive verses the Mr. Spoc of Star Trek fame."
503;I saw this movie after i saw saving private ryan, and i honestly beleive it is just as good.
504;the acting , story line, and script is just as impressive, andi think the characters are really intresting.
505;the visuals are astounding and as gripping as spr,and of course, the sound is just as good.
506;people, this movie is great because it lets you decide for yourself the point/meaning .
507;the smart, intellectual, pretentious, egghead, idealistic, ivory tower person.
508;I have to THINK about it for a while, digest it, analyze it, break it down and figure out for myself the significance and meaning.
509;This film is one the best of the decade .
510;The best and most bold aspect of this film though is in the narrative.
511;This kind of movie RARELY gets made these days .
512;It is a far more sophisticated film than the ultra.
513;SVP is a great entertaining film to watch once and then forget .
514;The flashbacks to the soldier's wife scenes alone are more powerful than just about anything to come out of Hollywood in the last ten years.
515;6 months later it still remained in my mind: images, sounds, faces, voices.
516;for me the film is like a dream, like a river that flows, making the film almost organic.
517;There's such life and power, deep feelings and emotions in this film that they don't wash away like your usual drama.
518;both intelligent and profoud, the actors, especially jim caveizal, ben chaplin and sean penn, truly amazing, just the look on their faces, those moments of silence between characters speaks volumes.
519;So please, give this film a chance, see it a second time or a third time, let it take you with it, let it sweep you up, throw away your expectations, forget everything you've seen, the journey will be one you'll remember.
520;Okay, I can appreciate a director attempting to make a bold statement about war and it's effect on the human condition.
521;wise in the states because Americans don't care about what is going through the mind of a soldier in war.
522;I'm rare in finding that even Tall is rendered with compassion, pressured from above, exposing the cost in his own soul in his final shot.
523;If you liked the second half of Apolalypse Now, there's a good chance you'll appreciate this.
524;I wanted, more than anything, to like this movie.
525;I am an enormous fan of WWII movies, and after such recent films like Saving Private Ryan, I was really looking forward to this movie.
526;There is a brilliant film about the taking of a particular hill during the Battle of Guadalcanal.
527;This film is one of the best WWII movies I have ever seen.
528;I have long been a fan of Nolte, and this role has got to be the crowning achievement of his career so far.3.
529;honestly, if you want to see a good WWII movie, watch the first 1 1/2 hours of The Thin Red Line.
530;this was once a brilliant film.
531;people had to go to the theater twice to see all of it, if I remember right.
532;the Thin Red Line might be such a great film that moviegoers really ought to have a right to see the ENTIRE thing.
533;By the way, this movie is incredible.
534;I call it one of the best films I have ever seen dealing with soldiers in combat.
535;"I rank it with ""Saving Private Ryan,"" but with this difference: ""Ryan"" is so terribly effective that, having seen it once, I don't need or wish to see it again."
536;Red Line is so effective in its visual, sensory.
537;overload way that I *will* watch it again.
538;I will give it a year and come back to it.
539;This is how I treat the movies and novels I like best.
540;this is a lyrically visual film.
541;To the writer, please visit with those who serve.
542;This film is similiar to Malick's previous works, Days of Heaven and Badlands, where there are voice tracks of the character's thoughts as they progress through events.
543;wise first sergeant, a company commander who stands up against his battalion commander during an attack that is causing high losses, and the battalion commander whose personal ambitions over.
544;Good film, Nick Nolte is excellent as a battalion commander and John Cusak does a brief appearance in a tense battle to seize a hilltop.
545;This is one of those movies in your collection that you always knew would pop off the screen on blu ray.
546;The main battle scenes are on that tall, grassy hill side set against the bright rays of the sun.
547;This is the perfect movie for blu ray!
548;There are a handful of these fantasy sequences.
549;The battle scenes are very well done.
550;the cast is surprisingly chock full of name brand actors.
551;The Japanese are finally over run and some are captured as prisoners.
552;a small detail thats in this movie that adds a little is the scenes with the natives on the island.
553;So to see these people in the film is cool.
554;the original version is a 5 star film, but blu ray will make this even more spectacular.
555;This is a perfect film directed by a true artist.
556;So I occasionally rewound the tape and listened and watched carefully.
557;Gradually something began to build.
558;The impressionistic and stream of consciousness techniques began to pull me in and to mesh with the flashbacks and poetic voice.
559;[Life] is a tale/Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,/Signifying nothing.
560;He was one of a generation of writers, including Norman Mailer and James Michener, who found their inspiration in the war in the Pacific.
561;award winning movie starring Burt Lancaster (an excellent movie, by the way).
562;the performances by James Caviezel as Pvt. Witt and Sean Penn as First Sergeant Welsh were excellent.
563;Certainly there is an intentional allusion to Carl Sandberg's poem Grass when one of the soldiers holds up some grass and says something like, This is us.
564;"With an astounding cast mainly male, which included future ""Jesus"" star, James Caveziel, Nick Nolte, Sean Penn, Elias Koteas, John Travolta, George Clooney and Woody Harrelson."
565;malick has crafted a masterpiece which towers over the mediocre '60 film which starred Jack Warden and Keir Dullea.
566;It was a very good movie.
567;enjoyed the story and each character involved.
568;Thin Red Line is one of the best movies I have ever seen.
569;that's one of the reasons that I liked Thin Red Line better than Ryan .
570;i also liked how Thin Red Line had beautiful cinematography, such as the forests and the wildlife.
571;so I think it added a more realistic touch to the film.
572;Jim Caviezel does an excellent job as the optimistic Private Witt.
573;and Elias Koteas does a fine job too.
574;overall, I was disapointed that there were no real special features (except for some Melanesian songs ), but since Thin Red Line is such a good film, I can forgive Fox.
575;I am really surprised at how many good reviews this film got here on Amazon.
576;And I went to the theater with a tottaly open mind.
577;I tried to keep telling myself Hey, hang in there, something cool will come.
578;THE THIN RED LINE reminds me of a ride at Disneyland.
579;"'The Thin Red Line' is yet another haunting and poetic film from a great visionary of American cinema
580;Certain scenes are just awesome and mind.
581;blowing and will send shivers up your spine.
582;But after all, TRL is one of my favorate(I can also recommend you another compelling film .
583;Terrence Malick is a genius.
584;Saving Private Ryan was good but a long shot from this one.
585;Not great as in, cool dude, blood but great as in bringing about emotion and the harsh brutaliy of war.
586;Great spiritual aspect along with a great look at the beauty of nature and life.
587;The Melenesian songs are AWESOME and the movie has an excellent score.
588;What was true for his first two films holds true here.
589;This film collected 7 Oscar nominations, great critical praise, but it didn't win any.
590;Another film by the title of Saving Private Ryan steamrolled right over it, as did the film that eventually won the Best Picture Oscar that year, Shakespear in Love.
591;The style of this film is also reminiscent of Terrence Malick's first two endeavors.
592;Many film directors leave an unmistakable stamp in their movies.
593;Martin Scorsese is an excellent example, as well as Steven Spielberg.
594;I named those directors to illustrate that I think Terrence Malick is a superb filmmaker as well.
595;The largest difference between this film and his earlier work is the sheer size of the cast and production.
596;Other than those moments, however, this is a very stong film with brilliant cinematography from John Toll and solid direction from Terrence Malick.
597;I want to emphasize that John Toll's work here is sparkling, and was one of the 7 nominations (Best Cinematography).
598;He has won the Oscar for Best Cinematography twice before: for Legends of the Fall in 1994 and for his stunning work in Braveheart in 1995.
599;I hope my review was informative and helpful.
600;like Ryan, this film has intense images of graphic violence associated with war and battle.
601;motion captures, cut to the powerful score of Hans Zimmer, are just as moving and powerful.
602;Scenes that stick out in the mind are the Americans' capture of a Japanese bunker on a hill, while their raiding of an enemy camp is one of the most moving pieces of cinematic masterpiece I've ever seen in any film.
603;the second half of the film takes us to where the real focus of the movie has been all along.
604;After their mission is accomplished, the regiment is given a week of rest, during which time each of the characters is given a chance to reflect on the experiences of the previous day.
605;The movie is brilliant for its ability to separate one's feeling of victory with their latter realizations of the acts they have taken part in.
606;one right after another, the movie brings out unheard of emotions that will stir even the hardest of cynics and critics.
607;The images of war, people crying out for help, breathing their last, and just the frenzied, frantic bravura of it all is deeply moving, one of the best war portrayals to date.
608;The psychological examinations are also very heartfelt, establishing the soldiers as characters, and more than mere pawns in a game of war.
609;Each of them has a monologue that plays during the movie, their thoughts and feelings put into poetry for the screen.
610;And Caviezel is an incredible addition to the cast as Witt, whose simplistic view of the world sets the mood for some of the movie's most powerful scenes and monologues.
611;A stirring war epic and an intense journey into the mind are swirled into an engrossing movie that tugs at the heartstrings with such a grip you have no choice but to go along with it.
612;This film exemplifies all the spectacular and beautiful things that can be achieved through the use of a camera.
613;Unlike the blatently obvious and artificial Saving Private Ryan, The Thin Red Line delivers insight into human existance through its visuals and steam of consciousness dialogue.
614;Mallick delivers one of the most asthetically pleasing films I've ever seen.
615;The visuals are gorgeous in their picture of a place untouched by the quest for power presented in war.
616;terrence Malick with this film become one of the most profound directors of our time.
617;such intense drama without any compromise in USA?
618;god bless you Terrence Malick !
619;Try Guadalcanal Diary , a fine movie based on a terrific book.
620;One of the biggest movie dissapointments I have ever seen.
621;Especially disapointing since so many great actors are in the movie with a great director.
622;While these men are not part of the first wave of the invasion, they still encounter a considerable force of Japanese infantry within the island.
623;and the battle scenes that do take place in this movie are on a far smaller scale.
624;does an excellent job of bringing the viewer into the mind of each major character in the movie.
625;You get a good feel for each soldier's personality through his thoughts, and his actions.
626;like I said, poetry is very heavy in this movie.
627;the camerawork is also excellent.
628;It's very gritty when it needs to be, especially during battle scenes.
629;There are also loads of still shots of wildlife, the land, and its natives.
630;I found that it created a sense of life for the environment in which the soldiers were fighting.
631;There are so many good things that I could say about it, and almost nothing bad.
632;Watch this movie with the intent of examining every scene, and listening to every word that is said.
633;I guarantee you will be thinking about this film for days on end.
634;It is a realistic depiction of a drug.
635;addled director's view of Guadalcanal.
636;If you think They Shoot Horses, Don't They was a good movie, you will love this one.
637;Take out the extended extra looks at various scenes, cut this movie down to around 75 minutes, and it would not be bad.
638;nominated World War II drama based on James Jones' book, is notable not only for its introspective approach to its subject, but also as the film that was initially supposed to make Adrien Brody a star in his pre.
639;While Sean Penn, Ben Chaplin, and Jim Caviezel have substantial screen time as the audience gets to see and hear their thoughts, the rest of the all.
640;be cast come across as extras in their own movie, with everybody from John Cusack to John Travolta to Nick Nolte to George Clooney (among many others) getting one or two memorable scenes at most and then moving right along.
641;, his expressive face and eyes and his considerable screen presence make up for his lost dialogue as he hovers anxiously in the background"
642;Even if you're not on the lookout for your favorite actors, TTRL dazzles the eye and touches the soul with imagery that is at once grim and poetically beautiful, as well as poignant Melanesian native music that acts as a moving counterpoint to the soldiers' ordeals.
643;'em action and people getting blown up real good, you may find yourself getting impatient at TTRL's leisurely pace and 170.
644;provoking, TTRL is worth a look.
645;Granted all soldiers go through their dark nights of the soul, and war sucks.
646;while I found it to be a meandering, unfocused film, I was still drawn in to Terrance Mallick's examination of the soul of a soldier.
647;I liken this film to Apocalypse Now, my favorite film of all time, in that it is a surreal examination of the psyche.
648;I feel that many of the reviewers that gush over this film do so as an attempt to establish themselves as 'lofty and discerning of taste while bashing a great film like Saving Private Ryan.
649;Mallick is considered an artist, since he has made exactly 3 movies in 25 years.
650;Not enough can be said about this 3 hour epic war film masterpiece to do it justice.
651;In my opinion it is clearly the best war picture of all time because it captures the thoughts and feelings soldiers had during the war.
652;This film allows them to share their thoughts with us and understand the horrors of war and the destructiveness of human nature.
653;What truly works in this film are the many questions the soldiers ask throughout the film during their confrontations on and off of the battlefield.
654;Each soldier is scarred and distressed in some personal and emotional way.
655;There are numerous ideologies and questions the soldiers ask about their mortality, the cruelty of nature, and the absence of a caring god.
656;All the actors give outstannding performances, especially Nick Nolte, James Cavaziel, Ben Chaplin, and Sean Penn.
657;Director Terrence Malick outdid himself by outdoing the cinematic beauty he previoulsy accomplished in Days of Heaven by hiring Cinematographer John Toll (Braveheart).
658;The filming of the mountains, the animals, and the tall grass plains are visually stunning.
659;The DTS soundtrack also enhances Hanz Zimmer's timely epic score and the numerous amounts of bomb explosions and machine gun fire.
660;I believe everyone should view this film because I feel it is timeless classic that few film filmakers will be able to surpass.
661;This is by far my favourite film.
662;What follows is simply an explanation of what I love about this film.
663;it is really this last area that the film is most focused on, IMO.
664;What's most impressive is that TTRL explores this subject matter through a unique presentation of scenes that would otherwise be cliche.
665;A brief exchange between the Captain and his Lieutenant brings up a recurring theme.
666;The parallel here is wonderful.
667;Where these scenes with Welsh illustrate these contradictions between group and self identity with death and combat, Witt's scenes explore these issues through peace and compassion.
668;For Witt, these contradictions are beautiful.
669;Witt sees a continuity in all forms of life: we are all a part of something greater.
670;"Witt is a peace loving man who bravely risks his own life and ends those of his ""enemies"" for his ""comrades""."
671;it is these issues that make up the main focus of the film, plus one other aspect.
672;This makes up the essence of the most interesting and beautiful exchanges between these two characters and it characterizes the presentation of this film: TTRL offers contradictory points of view.
673;"over at the end of the film is a good reminder of this: ""Darkness and light."
674;Just as Welsh sees bull**** and Witt sees beauty, one audience may hate this film and another may love it.
675;IMO, the greatest testament to this film's beauty is that it is still discussed with such passion.
676;Thus, I will firmly say that it is worth seeing at least once.
677;One great movie from one of the best directors the XXth century has seen.
678;While this film does justice to the horrible violence and cruelty of battle, it is also deeply meditative and beautiful, as well.
679;Like all of Malick's work it asks deep questions about man and his place in the universe.
680;"1998's ""The Thin Red Line"" marked the return to movie."
681;The action can be extremely intimate and challenging, as characters live and die.
682;The Thin Red Line is good cinema, and may be best appreciated by fans of Terrence Malick's style of film.
683;"making
684;the movie is acted out well, filmed in such a breathtaking style, and touches on such universal issues and truths that it still amazes me that people didn't like it.
685;Its not conventional or all that easy at times, but it is touching and amazing.
686;All of this touchy feely stuff is set to the backdrop of amazing, suspensful battle scenes that make your stomach drop.
687;A must have and one of the best movies of the past few years!
688;This is probabley the best war movie ever made.
689;It has one of the best casts ever assembled including John Travolta, Sean Penn, Nick Nolte, and Jim Caviezel(in one of the best breathrough performances ever).
690;I really love war movies, but this one just didn't hold my interest!
691;I have never seen a film come so close to poetry as this one.
692;Hard to explain but the truth is you either love this film or it frustrates you.
693;The best way to describe it is like one of those magic eye books you either see what is hidden or you don't.
694;Either way I enjoyed it and i hope my son will enjoy it as much as I did when he is old enough to watch it.
695;Terrence Malick has a reputation as one of the more eccentric and iconoclastic directors alive today.
696;He has been regarded at times with the same reverence as Stanley Kubrick, another iconoclastic director.
697;All of these films show a very personal, unorthodox method of story.
698;telling, and all of them are mesmerizing films.
699;Malick's last film, The Thin Red Line, was sadly overlooked in the shadow of Saving Private Ryan, but in many ways it is the more spiritual and moving of the two films.
700;In fact, if you look at the film as a visual poem rather than a typical Hollywood narrative, you will probably be able to appreciate the film more.
701;Picture is sharp and clear, and the sound is spread out amongst all the speakers quite well.
702;inspiring as in Saving Private Ryan (especially the DTS version, wow!)
703;but it is nonetheless very good.
704;There is an unusual section with the Malayasian songs from the soundtrack.
705;That's about it, other than the usual subtitles.
706;So, I highly recommend this film!
707;mines) will always be with us, and real men do not go mad.
708;This has also been made clear by Paul Fussell's book The Great War and Modern Memory.
709;so we can transfer our own damn foolishness and utter moral and physical cowardice onto Someone Else.
710;The commander, although relieved of his position, has a genuine argument for a recon in force, and Nolte's careerism is also his genuine committment to duty.
711;This one, however, will be remembered as a great all time stinkers list.
712;There was so much talent in it.
713;kind of movie like Saving Private Ryan (far more popular) was, which I find interesting, since both deal with the same war.
714;This one, from the first voice.
715;The Thin Red Line is definitely one of the best if not the best war movie ever made.
716;This is all sounding very pretentious, I must admit, but it is a nice counterpoint to Saving Private Ryan which is a great movie in its own right.
717;With this movie, Terence Malick really shows that he is a thought.
718;provoking great filmmaker capable of tackling a wide variety of subjects.
719;I think people will grow to love this film as I have, as a very poetic beautiful film, on a truly horrifying experience.
720;The Thin Red Line is the best war film I have ever seen.
721;there is a stellar, all.
722;Like the work of Stanley Kubrick or David Lynch, the film takes more than one viewing to fully understand, which may be impossible.
723;But if you're open minded enough, it is such an enjoyable movie in its grandeur.
724;Everyone has the right to their opinion.
725;And I think that it is more impressive to have a film that can recieve such divergent reviews.
726;i think that this film is more realistic about war than most.
727;the acting in the film is superb.
728;The music is awe inspiring.
729;When the main theme hits a certain point, a few minutes in it's breathtaking.
730;i can still remember some of the images.
731;whether people admit it or not, this film is a masterpiece.
732;It is one of the best films I have ever seen.
733;And I am glad that I had an open enough mind so that I could see that film for what it is .
734;a work of true art.
735;Terrence Malick is a director with an endearing eye for visual poetry.
736;His adaptation of James Jones' The Thin Red Line beautifully contrasts the terror of war with the utter beauty of nature and love (the flashbacks of one soldier's lost girlfriend .
737;acted beautifully by the gorgeous Miranda Otto .
738;Malick has constructed a cinematic poem using the backdrop of tall, green grass and the blood which stains its blades.
739;He is commenting on the way in which war tears apart the things we cherish: love, nature, freindship, and life.
740;The cinematography, as with Malick's earlier Days of Heaven , is breathtaking and powerfull.
741;This is one of the most beautifull films I have ever seen (the last shot of a single, lonely coconut laying in the sand is simply brilliant).
742;This ranks right up there with the classics: Full Metal Jacket and Apocalypse Now.
743;A beautiful shot film that will have you thinking and leave a lasting impression on you about the horrors of war and the men who lose their souls in the process.
744;I'm very happy with this blu.
745;ray's PQ and AQ, easily one of the best I own in those categories.
746;First, a few words about the wild difference of opinion about this film.
747;This is a film that will greatly reward the viewer who is willing to give their full attention.
748;Also, while there are some thrilling battle scenes, this is for the most part a contemplative story.
749;If you enjoyed Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket, for instance, you will likely be very moved by The Thin Red Line.
750;that aside, I found this film to be a deeply moving experience.
751;The music, scenery, and cinematography are absolutely beautiful and strangely complement the tension and anguish that unfolds.
752;The cast is for the most part outstanding.
753;Jim Caviezel is perfectly cast, as is Nick Nolte.
754;I also thought the cameos by big.
755;The combat scenes are among the most gripping I've seen, perhaps seeming even more so due to the quiet sequences elsewhere.
756;Those that are interested and willing to surrender themselves to the experience are likely to be richly rewarded.
757;Instead, I was coaxed by a fascinating, gorgeous movie out of my physical and mental state and into a sustained meditation on life and death .
758;no lecturing or highfallutin' abstract terminology, just a beguiling string of eloquent voices over the almost visceral visual style of a master filmmaker.
759;i loved this movie because it was balance in the horrors of war,yet the bond between men fighting the good fight.
760;After seeing Saving Private Ryan four times, and each time being more impressed by the realism and artistry of that film, I was tempted to see The Thin Red Line.
761;How this film received some good reviews is a mystery to me.
762;Back in the late 90's, I prefered Spielberg's """"Saving Private Ryan"""" over Malick's """"The Thin Red Line."""""""
763;It's actually a philosophical film that uses war as its topic.
764;The things that these soldiers go through are things that are discovered in the dark side of human nature.
765;Nick Nolte's story is especially astonishing and heartbreaking, as he (as Lieutenant Colonel Tall) cherishes his decorations and his strive for another promotion more than the men that he commands.
766;The contrast between Mother Nature and Human Nature is what drives this film, and it's captured rather perfectly.
767;The stunning cinematography by John Toll, the ethereal music score by Hans Zimmer, and the nearly flawless editing by Leslie Jones, Saar Klein, and Billy Weber make this film a definite classic.
768;But that's what sets it apart from other war movies.
769;Ryan, which was also made that year) this movie investigates the internal struggle, the soul.
770;It shows us the waiting time, while soliders questioned their actions, reflected upon themselves, or thought about home.
771;Sean Penn and Nick Nolte are at their best, as you've never seen them before.
772;Still others shall move you quite profoundly, more so each time you watch this movie.
773;The Thin Red line is one of the finest thought provoking movies to grace the screens in a long time.
774;When I watch the movie I appreciate it for the way that the visuals and the amazing score work together (the score by the ways is one of the best ever to come out of hollywood).
775;Its all very beautifully done to me, and it speaks to the big picture of nature and the human condition.
776;I highly recommend this book.
777;Say what you will, but Terence Malick's gorgeous opus was 1998's most stunning oscar contender.
778;Although I enjoyed Saving Private Ryan, and found Shakespeare in Love to be absolutely wonderful, neither film could match the profundity, depth, and utter beauty of The Thin Red Line.
779;Not only are the films performances well executed, and its themes amazingly explored, but The Thin Red Line is one of the most visually beautiful films created in recent history.
780;The shots of waving grass exhibit the extreme beauty of Guadanacanal, and serve as the perfect contrast to the horrors of war the picture presents.
781;The Thin Red Line is true cinematic poetry, and is destined to go down in history as one of the greatest anti.
782;my primary criticism is that the characters in the film often blend together, both in the accent of their dialogue and the nature of their appearance.
783;with that criticism aside, I have to point out everything that this film does so well.
784;Cinematically, it is a masterpiece.
785;(I feel the film was slighted at the Oscars, deserving the awards for cinematography, editing, and score.)
786;While the film traces the lives of several soldiers during this timespan, the action truly serves as a backdrop for Malick's own transcendental philosophies and his exploration of war's effect on men.
787;There was a lot of nature footage intercut throughout the film, effectively contrasting the brutality of war and humanity against the serenity of nature, and ultimately calling into question our own relevance in the natural equation.
788;As many viewers have described it, the film is a form of visual poetry.
789;overs are prevalent throughout the film, and they ultimately contribute to the poetic nature of the film and add insight into the soldier's psyche.
790;"Artsy would be an understatement in regard to this film
791;intellectual poetry in a southern drawl.
792;if you found profound meaning in the title for this review, you'll love the movie.
793;Despite its casual monotony for its 172 minutes, it is a touching life lesson in a war between life and death.
794;With an original story, an spectacular cinematography and a profound and intense soundtrack, The Thin Red Line demonstrates how useless and senseless a war can be if we can live in peace.
795;Jim Caviezel, the actor who played Pvt. Witt, delivered a performance and created a character that changed my life.
796;body experience is more accurate.
797;the film itself is pure poetry, the film is brilliant.
798;The film displays the best use of voice.
799;overs that I have ever seen.
800;a. kind picture, and one that you must open yourself up to completely.
801;Malick is a master of film, and The Thin Red Line is the strongest evidence to support that claim.
802;It will open your eyes to a whole new world of possibilities.
803;It didn't make everything better, it is my girlfriend and my family who helped me finally heal.
804;The Thin Red Line put me on the road to recovery, and that in and of itself is a wholly remarkable thing for a film to do for a person.
805;this is a film that wants to speak to to you.
806;Thin Red Line is a fascinating view on a dark and cruel chapter of WWII, the bitter, relentless fight over Guadalcanal in the Pacific theater of war.
807;Although the fighting is intense and without mercy, nature is in large part undisturbed by it and uninterested in the outcome.
808;There are exiting vistas and images of nature, animals, sunsets and sundowns, clouds and the omnipresent jungle.
809;Like it must have been for the soldiers most of the time.
810;Mr Terence Malick did an excellent job.
811;An intelligent, philosophical and artful anti war.
812;I was truly impressed by it.
813;This film in my opinion is an epic combination of sight, sound, and performance.
814;Nick Nolte's role was Oscar worthy.
815;It is the most powerful, gutteral, desperate, portrayal of a combat commander ever filmed.
816;Starles is excellent, as are Caviezel, Cusack, Chaplin, and Penn.
817;The philosophical meanderings and voice over take quite a bit of flack.
818;Malick is one of those directors whose work is pure cinema.
819;His movies touch the non.
820;verbal part of your brain, and experiment with what the medium of film is capable of.
821;The Thin Red Line is a very strange movie, with the most amazing soundtrack by Hans Zimmer.
822;It is most definitely a war movie, depicting the American take.
823;the filmography is really amazing, giving the movie a sort of dreamy.
824;overall, although this movie is a very strange mix of two movie genres, it's a very touching experience which can leave you speechless if you allow yourself to be taken away by the dream.
825;But there is a difference between providing a balanced view free of flag waving and showing a distorted vision of history as this movie does.
826;it all seems like a terrible waste because the few battle scenes that exist are fairly good, the cinematography is beautiful, and the cast is amazing but none of them have any interesting lines to say.
827;I never thought a """"war movie"""" (please take notice of the quotation marks) could be beautiful too."""
828;Terrance Malik is probably one of the best directors to ever make film and this film is hands down one of the best films made in the history of cinema.
829;To understand this work, It Takes the Heart of a Lion, Yet the Soul of a Writer.
830;terrence Malick has a masterpiece here.
831;It is a film that will become a classic.
832;He was awe struck and deeply moved at this films reality.
833;Three: The scene towards the end of the story whereby the soldiers are walking past the cemetary where fallen heroes are buried is beyond description especially with the back drop of thoughtful narration at that point.
834;a tremendous work of art.
835;See it with an open mind and no distractions.
836;The beginning is beautiful, very pretty scenery.
837;Slowly, but surely (and definitely artistically), the movie creeps towards the battles of Guadacanal.
838;and the cinematography is some of the best, in any movie ever.
839;There are shots that are 1/2 a mile wide, and there are soldiers in the whole shot.
840;What little action there is is great.
841;like at times, it really gets the adrenaline (and suspense) flowing.
842;The movie really shines in the acting and the general intelligence of the story.
843;Nick Nolte and Sean Penn are absolutely amazing in this film, and Woody Harrelson really shows his stuff during a certain death scene.
844;epic movie for all vets I, II , and vietnam vets to see.
845;has a great cast and visual effects.
846;good story line and of course fine acting
847;"There are two really good movies about Guadalcanal and the men who fought there, ""Guadalcanal Diary"" and ""Pride of the Marines""."
848;unless you are satisfied with watching beautiful scenery.
849;This Movie is a great Movie How could any one give this one star.
850;The acting is great the action scenes are great everything about this movie is great so I highly reccomend this movie to any one.
851;hey, all you coffee house liberals that love this movie, pretending that our fathers who fought in WWII act like you do when you fight with your 90's girlfriends.
852;I enjoyed films like Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers because the characters were well developed, they were believable, and above all, I could relate to them.
853;Mallick seems to think that characters take a back seat when you've got a grand artistic vision.
854;it has good cinematography, but honestly, anybody that's taken a basic filmmaking class can come up with good shots when given scenery like that.
855;This film is a master work from a director who is not prolific.
856;There is poetry and lyricism juxtaposed between horror and carnage.
857;It made me feel how life can be so precious to some and so expendable to others.
858;I saw the film when it was first released in the theater and felt compelled to revisit it.
859;"I know I'm ripping off Jim Jarmush, but this film testifies to the fact that ""It's a sad and beautiful world""."
860;Sometimes their are brief inhuman glimpses of the Battle for Guadalcanal and touching human flashbacks to the personal life of the film's protagonist.
861;"These men were truly ""The Last Great Generation"" and this film is a fitting and emotional tribute to the those who served and died on that small isolated patch of land located in the middle of a vast ocean on the other side of the world from their homes and loved ones."
862;I don't like movies about war and death but my husband does and he loves this movie and has watched it several times since I bought it.
863;Saving Private Ryan shocked us all with it's brutal fight sequences yet it somehow hesitated to get involved too much with the soldier's soul and feelings .
864;class fashion models at it's front line.
865;It includes some stunning battles scenes too but mainly , it sticks to the thoughts that went through the minds of the people who where there.
866;It trashes the act of war and judges it constantly by showing images of the piecefull nature and daily life of the native people of the islands right after the moments of chaos that took place during the battles .
867;Although the cast includes some really popular stars like John Cusack , John Travolta and George Clooney ,the director chooses two less.
868;known yet highly gifted and talented actors to carry the film : Jim Caviezel who , right from the start chooses to be alieneted in his own , dreamy world rejecting the people who conduct the war and their fake ideals and Ben Chaplin who searches for a goal in his life after breaking up with his wife.
869;something that takes lots of introspection and time.
870;star this movie, and go get any of those other sugar.
871;this is the best war movie I have seen.
872;Spielberg always hits the big time with his formula filmmaking that caters to those who don't understand and appreciate the endless possibilities of film as a medium.
873;Saving Private Ryan scores extremely well on the realism scale (we guess) but his cross section of America represented doesn't score well in originality.
874;Malick uses the background of the battlefield to suggest the ability of man to destroy nature despite it's obvious beauty.
875;perfect 'Days of Heaven', a film which also uses the technique of inner monologue to pull the narrative together.
876;I found THE THIN RED LINE to be a deep film, very ethereal in nature and liberating as it is disturbing.
877;Director Terrence Malick focuses on the conflict at Guadalcanal from ground up and showing empathy and apathy along the way.
878;The conversations, the dialogue between Jim Caviezel and Sean Penn is thought provoking, moving.
879;Hans Zimmer composed a very subtle, beautiful and thought provoking score for THE THIN RED LINE.
880;Zimmer's score was very moving in a very ethereal way.
881;James Jones was most certainly NOT zen.
882;like or poetic in his narrative.
883;The camera work is terrific.
884;And Malick can handle an action sequence with relative ease.
885;like thoughts and ideas of poetry go right out the window.
886;"I thought ""Saving Private Ryan"" was superior in terms of focus."
887;if ambiguity is what Malick was aiming for, then he accomplished his mission.
888;Can you quote one significant line from the film that encapsulates its themes and relate the context in which it was delivered?
889;the supposed main character Whit wanders the battlefield in a state of almost perpetual ecstacy, searching for that Zen moment whereby he resolve his life in a perfect death.
890;nick Nolte is, as usual, superb, as are many of the other performances.
891;But good performances on their own do not a great movie make.
892;While it does ramble a bit at times, it is one of the most unique, poetic, transcendtal war films ever made.
893;There are such etheral, extraordinary moments here.
894;Private Ryan was a Hollywood film, this film is an art film.
895;This was the better of the 2 films, and while many dislike this film intensely, I don't understand why.
896;i find it remarkable that despite a 20 year layoff, Malick came back and made such a memorable film.
897;That being said, this film is very well done.
898;i give it 4 stars, simply because I don't consider it a masterpiece as some have stated.
899;The characters are so soulful, developed and well played.
900;out it'll bring a tear to your eye.
901;The acting is brilliant from the mostly.
902;Sean Penn is strong and stunning, John Cusack is very convincing and Nick Nolte is angry, loud but somehow we see through to his good heart.
903;But it is the brilliant Elias Koteas who takes the cake in The Thin Red Line.
904;A true performance to be cherished, and we rarely get such a strong young actor to bring up such a magnificent portrayal of a man going through a rough time.
905;We don't see enough of George Clooney, unfortunately, but his extended cameo is still surprisingly memorable.
906;There are a lot of excellent things about this war movie, but Terrence Malick's amazing direction truly wins us over.
907;This man hasn't made a movie in 20 years and he has come back with this love.
908;hate it flick that most of the world enjoyed to the fullest.
909;This is mostly due to Malick's brilliant control over the movie and handling his task with absolute calmness and sureness that it'll do well.
910;The sound and editing are all fabulous and the cinematography is breathtaking.
911;The score is also very powerful and captures the movies beautiful brutality.
912;Overall, this is one of the best and most beautiful war films to ever be put on screen.
913;The Thin Red Line is unique and special and a stunningly shot flick that I am sure I will never forget.
914;this is a thought provoking movie.
915;How many men is it worth?
916;gentle John Cusack who only cares for the welfare of his men no matter what the cost to the mission.
917;This film is full of every anti.
918;They were all young and on the greatest experience of their young lives!
919;This was at a time in our history that the fate of the US actually DID hang in the balance!
920;i guess it struck such a chord with Hollywood reviewers because it essentially reflected their own lifestyles and attitudes.
921;the best thing about this movie is that it pretty much guaranteed it'll be another twenty years before Malik inflicts another horrid movie on us.
922;It's absolutely poetic, stylish and never hysteric, not even during the battle scenes.
923;are doing an outrageous job, and so does the rest of the crew, combining all to the best war movie ever made (in my opinion).
924;I remember quite well the simultanious release of 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'Thin Red Line' in 98.
925;That is why I had more appreciation for Private Ryan in my youthful years.
926;I shocked me and I loved it.
927;Thin Red Line is such a beautiful crafted film.
928;Terrence Malick is a genius, not like Spielberg, a machine.
929;He has a greater understanding of man.
930;He's very similiar to Kubrick.
931;this film will eventually become a classic.
932;Best war movie of all time?
933;This film should be nominated as one of the three best movies ever made.
934;A revolution in important ways.
935;All the men grapple with their secret natures, with the selves they are and those they hope to be.
936;The movie is, of course, about the religous/spiritual undertaking that is life and the ways that situations like a war are sometimes necessary to remind us that our moments are finite, our actions all important and that sacrifice and goodness are good qualities not lost to us yet.
937;Even so, a few decent battle scenes would have made this experience passable.
938;for most of the first half of the film we never see the faces of the enemy.
939;He stands and looks at the pin, runs into the side of a hill .
940;This film has not only an amazing cast but is also very accurate in how it depicts the pacific front of the war.
941;The film also shows the natural beauty that surrounds the way such as the landscape of it all.
942;"if you are a fan of nuance and abstraction and are intrigued enough to see the antithesis of a visceral movie like ""Saving Private Ryan"" (which is brilliant in its own right), this is the film for you."
943;I personally find (most of) his work to be brilliant and thought provoking and individual lines in the movie are as poignant as any I have heard before or since.
944;who's the good guy and who's the bad?Nolte and Penn are magnificent in their respective roles and Harrelson played a very believable role.
945;superb photograph and dazzling direction!A real winner film!
946;Not a 'Hollywood' film, a poetic meditation on men in war delivered in vividly beautiful imagery.
947;Only topped by 'Eyes Wide Shut' as possibly the best film of the decade.
948;Worst of all, this movies is SLOOWWWWWW!
949;the cinematography has been the only thing consistantly praised and that is so deserving.
950;the excellent cinematography makes the script seem surreal, like we're traveling in a dream and who's to say that that's not the director's intent.
951;This is one of the most powerfully introspective large budget films I've seen, largely due to the masterful artistic direction and screen writing of Terrence Malick and the incredibly cinematography of John Toll who has worked on many of the more beautifully scenic large budget films in the past two decades.
952;undeniably, the film was cast with great attention to how each actor would bring strength to the film, particularly the two main protagonists, Witt and Welsh.
953;Weaving together this tale of voices from the perspective of several points of view must not have been an easy process, yet as we balance the whole of the film, it's an incredible accomplishment for such complexity.
954;one of the reason I'm intrinsically drawn to this film is my own struggle with search for self and good in humanity, and the indelible moment that I recognize myself in these words.
955;It's a meditation on the nature of reality.
956;"something smiles back at him."""
957;This is the key to the movie and the driver behind the shots of nature in all its beauty and brutality.
958;The cinematography and Pacific Islander singer are quite lovely.
959;Not since The English Patient had one film affirmed for me how a remarkable film experience can sometimes become one of the most elevated forms of expression people can make.
960;All told, tens of thousands of Americans, Australians, over half a million Japanese (to say nothing of the Melansians!)
961;Spielberg knew about poems once, and the complexity and the comparably rich palette he afforded us in the unheralded Empire of the Sun, is one that all of Janus' Kaminsky's spectacular camerawork in Private Ryan or even Shindler's List could never hope to recreate.
962;all the movies that have well developed characters.
963;But something about this film stayed with me.
964;When it came out on video I was able to watch it.
965;Every time I watched I found a new dimension.
966;When we overran the Japanese base the emotions and images I felt and saw were haunting.
967;it also has a very interesting soundtrack.
968;Coupled with the technically unsurpassed cinematography of John Toll (and the director's eye for the camera which is part of Malick's genius), the scenes of battle are superior to any I've seen, ever.
969;Eschewing easy answers, the film poses important questions and assumes that you and I are capable of responding with intelligence, insight and compassion.
970;hans Zimmer's sound track truly weaves together the various elements of this epic film, and its elegiac, haunting poetry linger in the mind and heart long after the film is over.
971;nick Nolte, John Cusack, Sean Penn and James Caviezel in particular give outstanding interpretations of complex characters, and do credit to the wondrous characterizations in James Jones' related novels (From Here to Eternity and The Thin Red Line).
972;For those concerned that Malick may have been overly cerebral in making this film, turn to those sources and realize that this film is the product of two astoundingly creative minds in synchrony.
973;read Stephen King, certainly, for sheer entertainment .
974;those whose creations further the culture and give expression to our deepest travail and highest aspirations.
975;Watch Saving Private Ryan , certainly, to be entertained (and reassured by the illusion that the Americans are always good, the enemy always bad) and to feel good.
976;But also take the time to experience the finest cinematic art and all it can offer as an expression and validation of our humanness.
977;Intrigued by the majesty and thought.
978;"The Thin Red Line centers around gorgeous dialogue and monologue
979;Strife and Love, Darkness and Light.
980;Oh my soul, let me be in you now.
981;Tremblingly beautiful, Welsh's final words will render the avid viewer pensive and immobile, lost in thought"
982;I often enjoy offbeat films and deep dramas.
983;It is beautifully filmed, and the contrast between the beauty of the environment and the extreme violence of the war is harrowing.
984;There is a definitive scene about half.
985;innocence and beauty and subtlety juxtaposed against violence, hatred, and high caliber machine.
986;This is both a great war and anti.
987;This is a beautiful and strangely moving film.
988;In my opinion it beat the bejeezus out of Saving Private R.
989;Well, yes the set pieces in Saving Private Ryan are astonishing, but its center is told very conventionally and blandly.
990;If you want something with a broader viewpoint, a more penetrating world view .
991;Highly recommended if you suffer from insomnia.
992;Instead it is serene, beautiful shots of nature, a veritable paradise on a small island.
993;It plays like eloquent prose, or a piece of art, which is all the more astounding when considering the subject.
994;the lead character played by Jim Caviezel is perhaps one of the most aesthetic, not to say, most overwhelmingly magnificent characters i've ever seen on.
995;From director Terrence Malick, to actors Nick Nolte, Sean Penn, Elia Kostas, Ben Chaplin, the aforementioned Jim Caviezel, etc., it is and shall ever remain, a piece of art.
996;satisfied career, and their men are nothing but pawns that have to be moved, by force most of the time, and not the force of rational arguments.
997;The commanding officer will of course go last, and most probably will come last to certify the work of the men.
998;The second element is that this film shows how the minds of the soldiers still go on and they mix news from home and the famous letters from their wives who are asking for a divorce, and secretly hoping that will not be necessary.
999;The film is an absolutely fascinating denunciation of the psychological but also spiritual destruction a war is for any soldier who is de.
1000;structured and will have to rebuild his own personal psyche, structure, social being, human being, life in one word, afterwards.
1001;A war is for each soldier a loss of virginity, purity, happiness, promised rewards.
1002;This film treatment takes liberties but is entirely appropriate in tone and absolutely superior in its shooting, angles, and virtually every other technical detail.
1003;The acting is simply amazing as well.
1004;Like many of you, I'm an avid filmgoer and have a very eclectic taste, ranging from an appreciation of films like There's Something About Mary to Happiness.
1005;I've seen both Saving Private Ryan and The Thin Red Line, and I think they are both very innovative and brilliant in their own way.
1006;And I don't really see a need to say one is better than the other, because I'm sure that Spielberg and Malick have a mutual respect for one another and would not care to engage in such petty comparisons (one cast member of TRL stated in an interview that during shooting Malick seemed almost oblivious to the presence of SPR and had only positive things to say about its success).
1007;Despite the fact that many film critics attacked the bookends of SPR (the opening and closing scenes involving the aged James Ryan visiting the military cemetery) as unnecessary and overly sentimental, Spielberg stated in a recent LA Times interview that he was completely happy with the film and had added those bookends specifically for the veterans.
1008;He said that when WWII veterans wrote letters to him about SPR, they almost always mentioned those cemetery scenes as being the most moving.
1009;I think that TRL was a beautiful and daring work of art, but it cannot be doubted that it WAS a very personal film.
1010;It was a 10 year labor of love for Malick, and much of what we see onscreen is a reflection of Malick as a person: a passionately anti.
1011;rooted love of nature and peace and the fragility of the human condition.
1012;Those of you who did are no better than those of you who did not.
1013;That's the beauty of art.
1014;the artist creates it and then leaves it for the world to take from it what it will.
1015;it is also important to remember that few living filmmakers equal Spielberg in his ability to tell a story and to hook his audiences in.
1016;In fact, Malick has a well.
1017;He wants people to FEEL every aspect of what is happening onscreen.
1018;Thus, his films are full of long, fluid camera shots and dark, cerebral music that many find off.
1019;indeed, just as Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan has much in common with Oliver Stone's Platoon, so Terrence Malick's The Thin Red Line has more in common with Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now.
1020;another deep, dark, brooding piece of philosophical filmmaking.
1021;Both are masterpieces and comparing them is kind of ridicuous, yet most reviewers fall into one camp or another.
1022;both masterpieces, Badlands' and Days of Heaven.
1023;Both are visually opulent and so is The Thin Red Line.
1024;It takes great courage to show these Arcadian spendors of the Solomon islands being turned into killing fields.
1025;Malick gives most of the screen time to unknown actors and they are uniformly excellent, like Ben Chaplin and Jim Caviezel.
1026;Sometimes they seem like brothers and that is what it takes to survive, to establish a brotherhood in battle.
1027;John Toll's cinematography is wondrous, showing us the many shades of emerald green in the jungle grasses, the mountains that take on animal shapes, a silently malevolent crocodile silently slipping into the jungle algae.
1028;Hans Zimmer's musical score is great.
1029;His use of native chants is inspired, as in the opening segment, young native boys swimming in a paradise lagoon.
1030;"The battle scenes are unusual for their perpective
1031;The bigger name actors are good or used sparingly.
1032;We see alternate scenes of beauty and terror, fierce firefights, then quiet, and powerful images of vultures cicling a dying bunch of Japanese soldiers, multi.
1033;This is film poetry of the highest order and let us hope that Terrence Malick doen't wait another twenty years to make another film.
1034;We need his great visual eye and phisophical sensibility that infuses every frame of The Thin Red Line.
1035;traditional movies are constructed around the narrative with the visuals and sound effects employed to highten the emotional ties to the plot.
1036;whereas Saving Private Ryan may be like a great novel, this movie is like a great painting.
1037;Because of this, it is MUCH more work for the viewer and is about what the viewer brings to the viewing almost as much as what is actually shown.
1038;It is also worth noting that this is a prime example of a movie that should be, make that DESERVES to be seen in a theatre.
1039;One with the biggest screen and best projection and sound you can find.
1040;The story telling here is very unconventional, but poetic and beautiful, leaving you valuing life by the end.
1041;As an examination of humanity, this movie is wonderful and must be seen for it.
1042;The monologues delivered by the main characters are very philosophical and interesting to listen to.
1043;however, this film as a whole is very hit and miss.
1044;The Thin Red Line is a stunningly poetic and beautiful film.
1045;Terrence Malick is a true artist.
1046;I liked the contrast between the beautiful nature scens, and the horrors of combat.
1047;While few people seem to like both films equally, in my opinion they are both masterpieces, and a highmark in their respective director's careers.
1048;The film is truly a visual wonder.
1049;The cast is also a fantastic collection of great method actors,(and sprinckled with rising stars)who bring the grit every war movie does need.
1050;Nick Nolte especially is an essential part of what make some of the most important scenes work.
1051;Young Jim Caviezel gives a marvelous performance, and is the soul of the film.
1052;The Thin Red Line is an unorthodox war film that transcends genre expectations.
1053;It stands today as a testament of film.
1054;I felt this movie deserved much more merit than 1 star.
1055;Take a breather halfway through it and come back later to finish it.
1056;The movie has well spaced action sequences to keep the movie flowing.
1057;this entire film is fancied with highly impressive performances by Nolte, Penn, Cusack, and many others.
1058;Schindler's List is one of my favorite films of all time.
1059;Amistad is somewhere in the middle to upper.
1060;Thin Red Line is a brilliant film that is as cinematic as it is thought provoking.
1061;Thank you for your time.
1062;This movie is one of the best movies hollywood has put out about World War two so far.
1063;I would recommend this to any of those history buffs out there.
1064;This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.
1065;I defend this country and I understand the thoughts that go on.
1066;Saving Private Ryan was great but it didnt touch the human factor of war.
1067;I can only assume that this movie received Oscar recognition because of its beautiful cinematography.
1068;The scenery was spectacular and I appreciated the inclusion of exotic South Pacific wildlife in this movie.
1069;i also disliked the cast.
1070;The only soldiers in the film that I found believable were the extras.
1071;This is a great movie.
1072;There are a bunch of famous actors in it and they all do a great job with their parts.
1073;The movie seems real to life and will make you feel what they are feeling.
1074;I saw this movie because of John Cusack and really enjoyed it.
1075;I recommend it to everyone.
1076;embraced by film elitists and admirers of nice cinematography, Terrence Malick's comeback picture is certainly the prettiest war film I've ever seen.
1077;A great movie especially for veterans who fought the Japanese in the South Pacific.
1078;Great realism and family story lines, and of life s real meanings.
1079;Only a few people truly see the meaning of this movie, I included in this group.
1080;But The Thin Red Line in a nutshell is the best war epic ever produced.
1081;This movie gives you a real look on war.
1082;the thing that really makes this film unforgetable to me is the beautiful words spoken by various soliders with the view of war, or the view of the Guadal Canal.
1083;Caviezel was a relative no name before this movie, and I believe he truly deserved an Oscar for his role.
1084;He was a calm man in an insane world.
1085;He saw peace and harmony in everything, and Caviezel did an unbelievable job portraying this man.
1086;Because of this great performance he has gone on to make great films such as Frequency and The Count of Monte Cristo along with a hanful of others.
1087;2001 and 2002 have been very busy years for him and I believe that will continue to be the trend.
1088;one last note, don't forget to pick up the soundtrack, done by the great Hans Zimmer.
1089;Its very un zimmeresque and i believe it to be his best.
1090;This movie was defintely a 10/10 and should have won the best picture without a doubt.
1091;Truly, one of this decade's greatest movie making fiascos.
1092;All of the elements were there for a truly great movie.
1093;beautiful setting, human drama, even gifted actors.
1094;The director was far in above his head (or talent or ability).
1095;If you enjoy movies as high art, inflected with lots of hidden meaning and subtle flavors, you'll love it.
1096;The Thin Red Line's battle scenes were not as good as Saving Private Ryan's, but what makes this movie a must see is the expression of the soldier's mental and emotional well.
1097;The movie really shows how World War II effected the men of war emotionally and morally on the battle field and while on R and R.
1098;With news of the upcoming release of Terrence Malick's masterpiece THE THIN RED LINE on Blu.
1099;, I will now be able to die happy.
1100;IMHO, TTRL is one of the greatest films ever made.
1101;ray especially since it is also one of the most visually beautiful films ever made.
1102;It is not only a great war film, but a great spiritual poem that pays tribute to life in all of its forms on our planet.
1103;It will never be as popular as SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (released the same year), but great art is never embraced by a mass audience.
1104;ray while so many inferior films are released in this format every week and it will be worth the wait because Criterion deserves its reputation as the best home video company for film buffs.
1105;Saving Private Ryan is an action film, The Thin Red Line is a work of art.
1106;I was a little surprised at this particular part of the film.
1107;after a prolonged struggle in which many of his men are killed, Starlos finally captures the ridge, much to the delight of Tall, who comes striding up the ridge with a big grin on his face.
1108;Many of the men question the decision, but Starlos is happy to finally be out from underneath Tall and his gung.
1109;The battle continues to rage on until the survivors are finally evacuated, but the scars, both physical and mental, still remain.
1110;company struggles between the men.
1111;this is a very good movie.
1112;Despite some of the historical mistakes, such as the Army landings at the beginning of the film and the strange terrain in which the movie was filmed (Guadalcanal is a complete jungle island, while the movie was shot in wide open spaces with little or no tree cover), the battle scenes are executed very well, and the acting, especially by Nick Nolte, Sean Penn, and Elias Koteas, is excellent.
1113;Watch this movie and see a hauntingly realistic view of militaty and moral chaos in the Pacific during World War II.
1114;I consider both to be some of the very best examples of art perceiving truth about war.
1115;Like many admirers of this poetic masterpiece, I question the lack of relative arguments against the brilliance of this film.
1116;Are you loved by all?
1117;It goes into the minds of men involved in the war and the questions running through their heads, but does not force its audience to see it in any certain way and that's what I love about it.
1118;The action sequences are few and dripping with artistic flair that seems completely out of place in a WWII film.
1119;An honest, authentic, and non.
1120;hollywood portrayal of actual battle time.
1121;I had loved the book, loved the director, and loved the cast.
1122;I thought the cinematography was terrific and some of the performances (notably Elias Koteas and Ben Chaplin) were excellent.
1123;then about two weeks later I went to see the film again.
1124;The battle scenes were exciting and the visuals struck me as absolutely beautiful.
1125;i asked for the widescreen edition of the video for Christmas because the more I thought about the film, the better I liked it.
1126;it's one of the greatest films I've ever seen and certainly one of the best films of the past decade.
1127;The cinematography, the battle scenes, the performances, the score, everything came together in a riveting three hours.
1128;The canvas he paints is so large and so vivid.
1129;if you have the time and the interest, give this film a shot.
1130;It make take you a while, but if given the chance this hauntingly powerful film with stay with you for a much longer time than most standard Hollywood films.
1131;following an epic poem that reveals and resolves several characters time in guadalcanal.
1132;it is so much more fascinating to recreate the emotional intensity rather than recreating what a bomb looks like when it explodes.
1133;this is one of the most amazing films i have seen on screen.
1134;the thin red line is nothing short of a masterpiece.
1135;Always a big fan of WWII films I went and saw this film with great things in mind.
1136;What I got was great things.
1137;First of all the acting was great.
1138;The film also had a great music score, editing, directing and of course acting.
1139;It's great to see Terrence Malick back doing what he does best.
1140;And most of all seeing a strong film explain a great conflict that America was wrapped up in.
1141;i really looked forward to this movie and was completely appalled by it when I saw it.
1142;Best part: Polynesian chant at the end, Jesis yu takem life blong mi .
1143;this good film about the human condition and existentialism this about suffring the horor of war what is the meaning of existeince the nighmare that exist in nature and the beauity how nature is at war all the time creating and destroying it also about absurdism.
1144;this film is about justice and unjustice the cruelty that exist in the universe it about love good and evil and hope this is this one of the best philosophical war film that usa has made
1145;Malick's movie is an altogether refreshing movie about ideas, subplots, and an ethereal exploration of things unseen.
1146;Don't get me wrong: SPR is a stunning achievement .
1147;speaking, and I recommend it to everyone.
1148;It's an existential exploration, out of which viewers can reach very differing conclusions.
1149;Great war movies like 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'We Were Soldiers' get inside the heads of their soldiers and reveal them to be ordinary people thrust into the Hell of war, while at the same time giving us tense action and brutal battle scenes.
1150;i loved every minute of it.
1151;it is one of the most beautiful films i have every seen, and it captures both the horror and the boredom of war.
1152;a true classic with a massive cast of talent.
1153;terrence mallick is a true visionary, let's hope it doesn't take him another 20 years till his next movie.
1154;Make us shout, """"hoora"""" as we watch yet another glorious blood and guts scene featuring the noble aspect of honor, duty, and sacrifice."""
1155;It strays from the glorious charge, the valiant assault on the hill leading to a splendid celebration in the ranks, the bronze medals or silver stars.
1156;In that way, Malick does a wonderful trick, bulldozing all the war movie cliches that have become common practice in mainstream Hollywood.
1157;And again, while the soldiers are invading a Japanese camp, we here yet another thought from Caviezal's dreamy character stating: This great evil, where's it come from.
1158;Such ideas are solid measuring points on humanity, the idea of evil, and the idea of war.
1159;this film is not for everyone but it does convey some powerful statements throughout the 3+ hours of viewing time.
1160;Take note: if you enjoy thinking films, this will suffice.
1161;"i give this film an A+ for actually taking a stand and sticking with it, even though Saving Private Ryan lovers, classic skeptics, and ""color it for me"" movie lovers blast it left and right."
1162;I also heard profoundly philosophical ideas voiced.
1163;It is a work for the ages.
1164;For the sheer nature of its artistic controversy thin red line is the most important FILM of 1998 and probably the decade.
1165;It's the best film about existence itself since Wings of Desire.
1166;And, for me, it's in these moment of narration, combined with the stunningly beautiful cinematography, that this film is jaw.
1167;I could go SO much deeper.
1168;And the extensive booklet tells you everything that I haven't.
1169;And much, much better than the little that I have.
1170;Malick is a true master.
1171;I feel that this movie is magnificent and certainly worthwhile for someone to go see.
1172;terrence Malick graduated from Harvard with a degree in Philosophy, so naturally his screenplays and direction in general are unique and not commonplace to mainstream cinema.
1173;I realized I had witnessed some of the most powerful and sublime scenes created, yet, my mind wanted a big finale that most war films have, and I wanted a better structure for the disjointed story to embody.
1174;I began thinking more about some of those beautiful scenes, and I found that my mind had been stimulated.
1175;This is much deeper and cogitative than standard fare.
1176;i think this movie is outstanding and worthy of film goers who are going to give it some deserved thought and consideration.
1177;I don't just think this is a good film.
1178;To me this is the best film i've EVER seen.
1179;There probably are better films.
1180;then by all means revel in the drek that most of Hollywood puts out today.
1181;the film examines so many fundamental questions about us as individuals and beings with a common lineage that i've never seen anything that can even be compared to it.
1182;the most moving and engaging film experience.
1183;The movie is sometimes slow in spots but the general gist of it gets across the intense and sometimes futile nature of battle.
1184;pluses include nice scenery, chants, and some great battle scenes (especially the storming of the pillboxes led by John Cusack, and the overrunning of the Japanese bivouac).
1185;In my opinion, this was easily the best film of 1998 ( Shakespeare in Love .
1186;Malick has again created a magnificent visual canvas upon which to tell his story about man's humanity and inhumanity.
1187;film is a VISUAL medium.
1188;Terrence Malick is by far one of the best and brightest to direct today.
1189;This movie is the closest thing to poetry on screen in recent memory.
1190;"Ryan was powerful in its own way, but mostly because of its depictions of the ""horrors of war""."
1191;The Thin Red Line was beautiful because of its more ethereal qualities.
1192;sort of like reading a great poem.
1193;"But true movie lovers know that a movie that can sometimes place you in an almost meditative state is testimony to great filmmaking on many levels, and that is why I go ""The Movies"" in the first place."
1194;As a Vietnam veteran I can sense from this film many of the thoughts and feelings I had while in combat.
1195;Each in it's own way has it's strengths and weaknesses.
1196;This film however touches your soul.
1197;There are so many scenes in this film that can cause a flashback, the reality of war and combat come true.
1198;There is a certain sense of credibility here.
1199;When it starts it is very exciting.
1200;Watching this movie in full is a great experience.
1201;With SPR, you have a small group of guys that you follow from point A to point B. Real simple.
1202;Plus a lot of the film is focused on war images.
1203;"TTRL let's you really ""experience"" what it was probably like to land on a foreign island that's rich in beauty but you know you're about to go into battle shortly."
1204;That's true, this movie is the thinking person's Saving Private Ryan.
1205;But if you can watch a movie like the GodFather and follow along and you want more than CGI and special effects then you'll probably love TTRL.
1206;Saving Private Ryan, Enemy at the Gates, and even 1941 is infinitely better.
1207;One of the reasons I go to a film is to see something with at least a little entertaining content.
1208;In my opinion this is a definate pass!
1209;has there ever been a director so able to create magnificent visuals yet so incapable of framing even the most elementary narrative?

1214;ray and undergo true cinematic rapture.
1215;** UPDATE ** I've watched all of the extra features, which are uniformly insightful and superb.
1216;I like the director commentaries the most, since they usually combine both interpretation and production stories.
1217;I would've liked discussion about, say, the poetry of the film .
1218;"I didn't find this particularly interesting
1219;casting: A twenty minute featurette with the casting director, Diane Crittenden, featuring many audition tapes.
1220;Pretty interesting to see now well.
1221;I found this feature to be the most interesting of the lot, particularly their discussion of how Malick pared the original 5.
1222;One of the events that actually happened to James Jones that he put into the novel .
1223;Another scene shows George Clooney displaying some fine actorly chops.
1224;It's an amazing counterpoint to the film.
1225;trailer: Watch this after you've seen the film, since like most trailers it completely gives everything away.
1226;What emotions we felt, what our minds gravitate too during times of immense stress and emotional pain and what we do to maintain some sort of relationship with sanity.
1227;Many films in my opinion have tried to accomplish what Malick has so eloquently scratched the surface of.
1228;its easy to see why people dont like this film.
1229;Red Line is more subtle .
1230;I love both and watch both over and over .
1231;but for me at least TRL is the winner.
1232;The Hans Zimmer touch is probably a piece of the difference .
1233;but greater subtlety is a simple way of describing the other difference.
1234;There is a great film buried in this movie.
1235;And I do like a wide variety of movie.
1236;ed transcendentalist who has found heaven on earth in the form of life among the natives of the Solomon islands.
1237;Already, without wide realization, Witt has become one of the most unforgettable screen characters.
1238;The characters in Line are all original (much unlike the cliche roles of Spielberg's Ryan ).
1239;A glance from your eyes, and my life will be yours ).
1240;It has much more in common with 2001: A Space Oddessy than it does with Saving Private Ryan like most reviews compare.
1241;Beyond all the polics and rich egoists, why do we even have enemies?
1242;In perhaps the most powerful cinematic scene of the 1990's American and Japanese soilders senselessly kill one another through fog, and destroy a village in mid.
1243;We see several subjects who are all obssesed with something, one of which is obssesed with God.
1244;According to Christian beliefs, those of mine, one's purpose on Earth is to glorify God.
1245;Much like how all are who lay aside their daily obssision and become obssesed with God.
1246;Terrance Malick is a master of the medium.
1247;In a society where violence is glorified and warfare sanitized, this film is a powerfully moving testament to the horrors and inhumanity of war.
1248;Recognizing that soldiers are real people, it lets the audience in to the minds of those who were witness to such tragedy.
1249;The premise of the film is based on the works of William Faulkner, with characters defined by poetic, philosophical voice.
1250;overs that are meant to represent their subconscious thoughts.
1251;In any case, Malick's technique is an original approach to film.
1252;There seems to be a great deal of comparison between this wonderful film and Speilberg's """"Saving Private Ryan"""", but I don't think that there's really much to compare between the two."""
1253;You'll feel this movie as much as you watch it.
1254;Anyone who has seen and loved this film needs to read Being and Time by Heidegger if they want to fully understand the greatness of this film and to understand where Malick is coming from and what this film is trying to do.
1255;A darling of film buffs, Malick had dropped out of sight after 1978's DAYS OF HEAVEN.
1256;It was this hero worship that motivated most of the reviews that praised THIN RED LINE as a work of beauty and introspective genius.
1257;While film critics described LINE as a tone poem or a philosophical exploration into the nature of man few described it as a good (or even comprehensible) movie.
1258;I'm surprised this even got released.
1259;One of the most philosophical movies released by a major Hollywood studio with this type of budget behind it.
1260;This movie has a great plot.
1261;a beautiful war story is hijacked by the actors.
1262;"the blu ray extended edition of ""the thin red line""""the new world"" blu ray extended was one of the best things to happens to blu ray users everywherethis movie certainly deserves one or even two hours more!fox, hears this, brad pitt is still a huge star and ""the tree of life"" may attracts a lot of publicity, its the best moment to make some bucks from mr malick s work."
1263;this film has an amazing cast, and if you take your eye away for a second you could miss a Hollywood stars performance.
1264;This is the truth of the world.
1265;He knows there is a better place out there away from the war and he has experienced it.
1266;Witt is the hero of the story as he is able to learn how to live while staring death in the eye.
1267;this movie is absolutely amazing.
1268;Watch this movie and see if you can take it all in because there is so much to love about it.
1269;Boasting some nice cinematography and fine acting, there was no reason this couldn't have been a better movie than it was.
1270;We become aware that combat is intense.
1271;* This is a remarkable and heartening change after the devastating blows of Pearl Harbor, the fall of the Philippines, Guam and Wake Islands and a number of very costly sea battles.
1272;There are two kinds of Japanese in this movie.
1273;In the World War II that my father fought in, Japanese soldiers were quite capable and very brave, often to the point of fanaticism.
1274;I commend HOllywood for being brave enough to come out with something like this.
1275;Terrence Malick is a very spiritual man, and he is on a distant plane seperate from most of us, and he shows this best through his work.
1276;so this can't be viewed by many but give it a look.
1277;I respect that and feel what you feel.
1278;I thought James Caviezel played an awesome and intense role.
1279;With such a great line up of actors I may have been expecting too much.
1280;This is one of the best films of 1998 and perfectly supplants Saving Private Ryan as one of the finest war films to come out of Hollywood in years.
1281;The imagery is absolutely stunning and the cast is top notch.
1282;The cast is terrific and not one performance should be missed.
1283;The extras on the disc and the booklet are fascinating as well and Criterion has succeeded on every level once again.
1284;This movie deals with a very good subject and area of the Second World War in the South Pacific Islands, but the focus of the movie is on unrealistic emotions of soldiers.
1285;"The ""men"" are acting out emotions that are more feminine than masculine."
1286;I see this in the native village scenes, the main character acts like he is on drugs.
1287;"Movies like Platoon are far more realistic, this movie is too ""artistic"" and whimsical."
1288;we are treated to the longest reaction shots in the history of modern cinema.
1289;This is one of the few things the movie got historically right.
1290;remove the interesting characters from Apocalypse Now and replace them with your new concoction.
1291;japanese guys and see what happens.
1292;Make absolutely sure that you end up with a homogeneous mixture.
1293;sIDE NOTE: For those of you who have not yet learned how to make a flashback, you have a greater chance of making them the Thin Red Line way.
1294;the way they showed the American soldiers brutalizing the Japanese, namely the most vulnerable ones.
1295;Terence Malick is a genius.
1296;He took a hiatus from the Hollywood grind/emptiness then reappeared with this grand war drama.
1297;It is beautiful and daring while maintaining a grim clearness.
1298;He used a mix of well known actors to mixed effect.
1299;Sean Penn is fantastic as usual, Jim Caviesel is moving and other worldly, Elias Koteas perhaps steals the film and Nick Nolte's bulldog character is memorable.
1300;Others, such as Woody Harrelson and George Clooney, seem out of their league as does John Travolta, but their quick bits don't take away from the overall vision and power of this master work.
1301;"Like ""Saving Private Ryan,"" ""The Thin Red Line"" takes place during World War II."
1302;A place so beautiful, that I suspect most of talent involved in this film were involved for the sole purpose of visiting that beautiful land.
1303;The movie poster/box highlights many big stars, such as Oscar winner Sean Penn, Oscar winner Adrien Brody, Oscar Winner George Clooney, Oscar nominee John Travolta, Oscar nominee John C. Reilly, Oscar nominee Woody Harrelson.
1304;there is some MAJOR talent behind this movie!
1305;Most of the time though it's beautiful scenery, characters starring at each other for long periods of time, and once in awhile things will start blowing up.
1306;There is much skill behind the craft to be sure.
1307;The cinematography, special effects, and camera work is all very impressive.
1308;This is a great looking and sounding film.
1309;What a pity, for I'd sure like to see that great movie someday.
1310;Has got to be one of the most powerful war films ever made.
1311;ending flashbacks of one soldier's wife.
1312;It will punch you in the belly, and then knock you on your rear end.
1313;This motion picture gives you the agonizing truth.
1314;Overall, though, this is a very good movie.
1315;If you are looking for high art, you'll get it, if you're looking for high action forget it!On the plus side, the cinematography is amazing.
1316;The beauty of the jungle set against the uglyness of battle is striking.
1317;please don't expect this movie to be Saving Private Ryan.
1318;to explore what it means to be human.
1319;Yet, despite all the flaws, this movie manages to combine images and words into a true visual poem.
1320;There are a handful of moments in the film when the voiceovers and the action and the music the cumulative narrative force will overwhelm you and take you to another world, moments when you will forgive Malick for all of his faults and just sit there in reverie.
1321;The acting is superb with an impressive performance by Nolte.
1322;The cinematography is excelent as well.
1323;Because as I see it all the reviews so far fall into two catergories, loved it or hated/feared it.
1324;"
1325;Like the nightime sky this film is best enjoyed just sitting back and soaking it all in.
1326;"
1327;no artifacts, great 2.35:1 picture.
1328;It is a hauntingly realistic view of a US Army Infantry Battalion and its men fighting the bloody battle for Guadal Canal.
1329;This film is wrought with an almost spiritual sense of moral chaos as these men face the brutalities of war without and within themselves.
1330;The film opens up with some beautiful scenery and a couple soldiers who are, by all appearances, living with some Pacific Islanders.
1331;special features: Several Melanesian Songs which are quite beautiful in and of themselves, but that is about it with the Special features.
1332;Technically, the film is moderately good .
1333;nice scenery, good cinematography, lighting, composition and so on.
1334;The film was accurate and was a good portrayal of fighting in the Pacific in general and of the fighting on Guadalcanal.
1335;I dont have that feeling yet.
1336;the film also talks a lot about the bonds that are formed between the men who fight together in a war.
1337;Early in the movie one soldier thinks: maybe all men have one big soul that [everyone is] a part of one big self.
1338;After the GIs are sent back to camp, one thanks the Captain for saving their lives by keeping them together and asking to make the flanking move.
1339;He responds by telling them in Greek that they are all his sons.
1340;He thinks to himself: You are all my sons, my dear sons.
1341;Ill carry you wherever I go.Perhaps the most moving portrayal of the brotherhood was the scene where the GI who was AWOL at the beginning of the movie led the Japanese away from his company.
1342;He gets himself into an open field and is surrounded by Japanese soldiers.
1343;Oh my soul, let me be in you now.
1344;Look out at the things you made, all things shining.
1345;A GI hears the bird, gets scared, and shoots at it.
1346;I felt there were scenes that could have been left out and there were scenes that probably should have been added, but all in all it was a good movie.
1347;I liked the fact that it wasnt a package movie, one that tells a story from start to finish and wraps it up in a nice box.
1348;I like to feel that way about a movie, it means Im thinking for myself.
1349;This film brought a subject to the foreground and asked the audience to come up with the answers for themselves.
1350;The writer and the director didnt get together and show us exactly what they wanted us to think.
1351;star reviews, and maybe a five.
1352;star if it occupies, as it usually does, the proud upper.
1353;the film displays Malick's usual stunning images, along with the philosophical musings on the order of what is life?
1354;I especially enjoyed the occasional glimpses of animals, from the crocodile at the beginning, through the rainbow lorikeets, phalangers, and especially the cluster of adorable fruit bats.
1355;I was fine with the initial entrance of Jim Caviezel, especially since this came before his later fame in The Schlemiel of Monte Cristo and The Passion of Mel Gibson's Anti.
1356;A 1998 film and not a rave at the box office even though it was loaded with box office stars.
1357;The movie starts out a little slow and builds into lots of American and Japanese fighting as the Americans work to take over a hill occupied by the Japanese.
1358;I'll give this one 4 stars.
1359;self, this is going to be great.
1360;After watching it, I ponder why it was nominated for best everything.
1361;The cast is solid, with lots of little parts here and there.
1362;Woody Harrelson and George Clooney deserved more than they received.
1363;The scenery is beautiful and Nick Nolte is great, but thats about it.
1364;TRL subtlely draws its viewers by concentrating not on the heroism of each characters but allowing these characters to examine their own roles in the war and simply, the ethics of war itself.
1365;There really are no heros in this movie but that's okay b/c what they say and think is much more important.
1366;Remember one of the greatest minds of the 20th century (Time), L. Wittengstein wrote one of the most powerful philosophical texts when he was in the trenches of WWI.
1367;Terrence Malick is a director who always wants us to see something unique, and with The Thin Red Line he has finally become the kind of visionary that all great movie lovers have been anticipating.
1368;game inspired bloodbath (fun on one level, due to its great sound effects, but poor on many other levels, such as having a point), while Malick's is a sensitive, slowly paced, far more watchable picture.
1369;Like all great art, it will not please every taste, but to those of us who appreciate its design, it means something more than most war films ever will (probably because the art of war is not the principle concern of Malick in this script).
1370;Zimmer's sweeping music score is also more melancholic and memorable than the one chosen for Saving Private Ryan .
1371;in its tones, you can hear the truth about the human condition trying to get out.
1372;the Criterion disc is loaded with great options to choose from (if you aren't one who has a great deal of time), but the interviews with the principle players are great fun to watch (especially Penn's comments).
1373;The audio commentary is also very good, worth a listen any time.
1374;Thank you Criterion for giving Malick the due that he deserves.
1375;Thanks Dad for everything you and our men had done.
1376;keep in mind, that many of our men were killed over there fighting for our freedom.
1377;the director, Terrence Maliick, did an outstanding job of conveying all this.
1378;ups of the men's faces manage to show their inner struggles by the use of lighting and perhaps a leaf against the backdrop of nature.
1379;There is star power in the cast .
1380;the film was true from its very core.
1381;If you like WWII flicks for action as well as human interest, this is a film that has all of it.
1382;IMO The Thin Red Line is the best WWII film made and that includes Saving Private Ryan (for my reasons see my review of SPR also here on Amazon).
1383;malick's ponderous film is a masterpiece from start to finish.
1384;what this film lacks in terms of Saving Private Ryans landing sequences, gore and shock value it makes up for in emotion and human spirit.
1385;Above all this is a film about the triumph of humanity over savagery .
1386;a theme captured in the character of played by Private Witt.
1387;the film is packed with marvellous performances, in particular that of Nick Nolte as the general looked over for promotion and who uses his men heartlessly as pawns to erase that painful memory.
1388;Oil, land, political boundaries drawn on a map?
1389;As Jim Morrison aptly put it, you're all a bunch of slaves!
1390;Above all, it is about the duality of man: one role as a member of the natural world around him and the other as the destroyer of nature.
1391;Beautifully filmed, it is a mesmerizing tale that absorbs the open.
1392;Have not seen it yet but I received it.
1393;It was well acted, but I have no idea what message the film was trying to send.
1394;now even though it is a psychological study more along the lines of The Red Badge of Courage it delivers some great action sequences as well.
1395;"The characters aren't all american boys in the strictest sense but they are ""real"" people with real problems."
1396;I had recently seen Saving Private Ryan and although captivated by The Thin Red Line's stunning cinematography, I felt the elegiac narrative was over.
1397;I am always loathe to describe a film as beautiful, but The Thin Red Line certainly is.
1398;although you miss the grand scope of the glorious natural imagery, the smaller scale of the television screen renders this movie more intimacy and makes it feel deeply personal.
1399;the prosaic narrative running throughout, spoken by a host of characters, is sheer poetry.
1400;If you allow yourself to be absorbed, it'll make you consider life, the universe and everything.
1401;But when he does, it's certainly worth waiting for.
1402;He has a glorious cinematic eye, and everytime I watch this film, I just want to know more and more about each character.
1403;the acting by the main cast is flawless.
1404;weary Sgt Welsh and the ethereal Private Witt, played with utter grace by Jim Caviezel.
1405;as he proved with Gladiator, Hans Zimmer writes the most stunning scores, and the songs of the Melanesian choir are a brilliant scene.
1406;just 18 months down the line, time and perspective has worked wonders for this film.
1407;The Thin Red Line is one of my all time favorite movies.
1408;The idea if transcendence is very important in understanding the main character of Pvt. Witt, played by Jim Caveziel.
1409;Witt bookends the story, as it begins with him and as well as concludes.
1410;The spiritual aspect is one of the driving messages brought home by director Terrence Malick, who also wrote the screenplay based upon the James Jones novel.
1411;Malick strikes a perfect balance between realism and a higher motif regarding the inner life of combat soldiers.
1412;In the wrong hands, this could come off as derived or sappy, but Malick is definitely a master film maker.
1413;"This picture was the first movie he had made in 20 years, since his pair of Seventies hits, :""Badlands"" and ""Days of Heaven."
1414;Like all good war stories, this is an ensemble performance.
1415;the cinematography created by Malick perhaps allowed this movie to be so realistic.
1416;One of the aspects that makes this film so good is the emblematic nature of the fighting.
1417;"The Marines obviously had similar fights up in the hills, but this film when compared to ""The Pacific"" is great study in the subtle differences between the two branches."
1418;The interplay between Nolte and Koteas is the perfect example of how these schools of thought converged.
1419;In fact, Malick does a masterful job of spreading the story out to cover all the characters created by Jones with equal attention.
1420;Dash Mihok, Ben Chaplin, Arie Verveen, Woody Harrelson and John Cusack round out the ensemble with a text book example of how the war was won with close quarter combat against fortified Japanese positions upon the grassy and jungle covered hills.
1421;Malick also added an amazing soundtrack, complete with Melanesian choral chants.
1422;This film is very touching, emotional and educational that I highly recommended.
1423;Otherwise the supplements are quite interesting because the stories behind this film are legendary now.
1424;language: EnglishSubtitles: English SDHSpecial Features:* New, restored high.
1425;This release has managed to hold its value quite well.
1426;For me TRL, is a far more rewarding picture.
1427;Like all great works, it requires multiple viewings and close attention to be fully appreciated.
1428;Yes, there are battle scenes (one spectacular battle in particular, for the taking of a hill) The director, Terence Malick, uses the wartime setting to make points about the human condition (especially, humans as PART of the NATURAL WORLD), because war intensifies and foregrounds the most fundamental emotions.
1429;the film (derived loosely from the James Jones novel) is Whitmanesque in seeing mankind as a part of nature.
1430;acted, haunting film, TRL demands close attention and more than one viewing.
1431;For some, it will be well worth the effort.
1432;shaking low frequencies and stunning nature imagery.
1433;I had an art teacher once who taught a revealing parable about art specifically, and life in general.
1434;"he described the angst, the anger, the pain of the artist
1435;the teacher explained that a lifetime of study and understanding art gave him the ability truly see the work for what it was.
1436;the person laughed and stood up.
1437;Before walking out he said he liked the color red.
1438;that the cast is made up of a Hollywood Who's Who among anti.
1439;I'm genuinely surprised that Tim Robbins wasn't in the production.
1440;war film can be done and done extremely well.
1441;Even received by the right.
1442;Kirk Douglas/Stanley Kubrick's brilliant film 'Paths Of Glory' is a prime example of the insanity of combat.
1443;I just watched this film for the second time and liked it better this time.
1444;Still, Mallick is an artist with the camera and the cinematography is visually stunning.
1445;And I thoroughly enjoyed the sound track by Hans Zimmer.
1446;Malick allows the viewer to understand the true nature of the soldiers and there reaction to the madness of war.
1447;It is about finding a spiritual connectedness with all things and about what it means to be part of not just a human family, but a family of the world.
1448;It is a mesmerizing spiritual journey and look at the horrors of war and life.
1449;We should be so luck to have Hollywood makes more movies with such a skillful discussion of an individuals place in the world.
1450;This film is greatly overrated!
1451;Private Ryan was three hours long too, but that was a good movie, with changing scenerey and story.
1452;This movie is good in the fact that it makes you think.
1453;dEATH soldier?It is realistic in that it shows that everybody gets scared some time or the other.
1454;You can't really compare the two"
1455;He is back in prime form.
1456;Saving Private Ryan was a safer film to make, I think, because you have the firepower of Spielberg, the most successful commercial director in movies history and Hanks, arguably the most popular American actor today.
1457;But, The Thin Red Line has more ambition and a greater emotional impact.
1458;Malick had enough influence to gravitate so many great actors for this project and makes a good selection in Jim Caviezel, who illuminates with a sort of holy aura.
1459;The meditation exists as the narrator sort of floats above the action, acting either as an ominiscient being, or one who's voice is filled with questions.
1460;there are good roles in this film, especially those of Nolte, Caviezel, and Penn.
1461;christ figure and his dialogues with Penn are some of the film's best.
1462;masculine CO who possesses some nice silences between his fits of screaming.
1463;Despite all that, I believe it is the year's best film and ranks with Apocalypse Now as one of the best war films of all time.
1464;It is more ambitious than any film you will see in a long time.
1465;The Thin Red Line is the greatest war movie ever made.
1466;the cinematography is breathtaking, the directing inspired, the acting first.
1467;The ensemble cast pulls off a miracle .
1468;All in all, a contemplative mood piece with more inspired and artistic images than easily.
1469;An excellent movie to understand the psychology of young men thrown into combat.
1470;Acting is very good and often superb.
1471;Location is well chosen (could not be done in Guadalcanal itself though) and special effects are well done.
1472;extras: deleted scenes add value, especially one with GIs moving Japanese prisoners.
1473;Terrence Malick is rightly a genius of film.
1474;The reasons for its failure are not all his and the craft of the film is excellent.
1475;But ultimately it is what is.
1476;And the book is some sense a sequel to that work.
1477;The strength of the book as the fiction are the human portraits of ordinary soldiers that it creates.
1478;Its weakness is that Janes Jones often played fast.
1479;Its fiction but its so closely shadowing real events and real people that the author is himself riding on a thin line.
1480;The battle had essentially been won before the film starts.
1481;This is a character based on a real person with a real history that can be examined.
1482;this could have been a great work if the director had stepped back from the pure book and given a broader historic perspective to the individuals involved.
1483;The strength of Jones is that he captures the war from the viewpoint of the bottom.
1484;one thing, above all else needed, was to show the marines who had been fighting on the Island coming off the Island as wrecks as the film begins.
1485;but for all the shortcomings of the film, its an incredible technical work on some levels.
1486;There is an enormous attention to detail in the production and the construction of scenes.
1487;Everything seems more than faithful to the period.
1488;And the actors do a good job with the flawed material they are given.
1489;This movie is one that stirs great controversy.
1490;This beautiful canvas full of poetic beauty and sensual mindflow, is one not to be taken superficially by the viewer, which has lead to a great misunderstanding of this masterpiece.
1491;The setting for this movie is stunning although should not be the center piece.
1492;"The battle scenes are excellent (the taking of the hill), and the cinematics wonderous
1493;The film seems to wander fluidly much like the human mind, and the train of thought unfolding is underappreciated.
1494;The cast in this picture are supurb and complement Malicks haunting direction without overshadowing it.
1495;Many of the actors, such as George Clooney, have very small roles.
1496;There is one decent part of the film where an artillery observer calls in an artillery strike, but that's about it during this three hour monster.
1497;A large cup of coffee is a must with this film.
1498;This is the only movie that you will probably ever see that is the most realistic and moving as this one is.
1499;This movie shows everything from the compassion, courage and pain of the soldiers to the beauty of the land that they were in, including the pictures of the wildlife to the uglyness of the war in itself.
1500;The narriation of the soldiers was excellent and was there to show the feelings and the compassion for each other on the battlefield.
1501;This movie is a must see to everyone especially to those that think that war is """"glory and victory""""."""
1502;I have read many of the other reviews and it is one of those i love it or hate it.
1503;everybody is entitled to their opinion.
1504;Thats why i liked it so much.
1505;TRL brings the viewer through that emotion.
1506;Don't get me wrong, I thought SPR was well done movie, I own it and enjoy it.
1507;If you seen it once, you sould see it again.
1508;I definitely liked this movie a lot, probably more so than Saving Private Ryan.
1509;But don't that let that put you off an otherwise excellent movie with many beautiful pictures, flawless acting and not least a superb soundtrack.
1510;But it was still a pretty good movie.
1511;It cool how, one moment it was showing some violence and then the next moment it was showing the beauty of nature.
1512;The movie was beautifully filmed, the actors were well.
1513;known, and the writing was superb.
1514;It is my belief that one day film historians will look back at the 1990s and realize that The Thin Red Line, an overall superior work compared to Saving Private Ryan, was done an injustice due to the latter's superior marketing techniques as well as director Steven Spielberg's household name recognition.
1515;While Private Ryan did a good job at depicting the horrors of war and the honor of the individual soldier, The Thin Red Line gives us the psychological aspects of war, which is a far more complex and intriguing world then the one presented to us by Spielberg.
1516;This film is longer and less hollywoodized than Ryan, but it has just as many gripping battle scenes and a star all.
1517;torn towns in France, this one gives us a glimpse into the colorful, exotic world of the Asia.
1518;To sum things up, this film is a masterpiece for an audience that appreciates war films that are realistic yet also introspective, delving into the the eternal issue of life and the meaning that human beings give to it.
1519;It shows them as frightened men who do their job: taking a hill from the Japanese.
1520;soldier like me knows that has to be true.
1521;maligned woman on the swing to be a very powerful image that worked well with the carnage it interrupted.
1522;But it was a very good film.
1523;The cinematography and music worked well together and many of the images were starkly beautiful.
1524;These feelies (holographic entertainments like movies) were uniformly designed to produce maximum pleasure with ever.
1525;It is a work of art that challenges its audience and raises many questions and answers none of them completely.
1526;It is a film to own and savor over many years.
1527;If you see the beauty and profundity in that island, the aborigines, and Col. Tall's madness you will glean new insights with each viewing.
1528;I'll tell you though, the pleasures you'll find if you open yourself up to it are many.
1529;Because it is genuinely reflective and soul searching, it seemed a letdown to most audiences.
1530;The battle scenes are equally brilliant, though more stylistic.
1531;Malick's intentions are to show that mankind cannot separate itself form the rest of nature and to make us see that even the most uneducated among us can see that war is ultimately evil, no matter the goodness of the cause.
1532;much of the time you hear the characters thoughts.
1533;despite the subject matter, this is one of the most visually beautiful American movies in years.
1534;The wonder of this against what the troops are doing is powerful.
1535;The film is filled with such images.
1536;An American army fighting for survival must take over a force of Japanese soldiers.
1537;First off, the film has a point.
1538;It wants to look good.
1539;He orders his men this and that and never stops to rest or wait.
1540;He's the one who seems as though he constantly saying CHARGE!
1541;He like a solid rock that is just lying at the bottom of the sea.
1542;There is actually character with these two.
1543;Once Director TERRENCE MALICK actually builds something in this film.
1544;There is some dramatic war and brief emotion to be rewarded for this film.
1545;and just added together the actual performances and few war scenes.
1546;this film could've been brilliant.
1547;It had a brilliant idea.
1548;Oh hey was that just George Clooney right there?
1549;I found this film to be very moving and I think it says something when grown adults probably 20 or 30 years older than myself proclaim in all.
1550;I think Terrence Malick's work is visceral and poetic and a million other adjectives.
1551;This film will move you.
1552;Well first of all, the film's length is appropriate to its subject matter.
1553;Lastly, if anyone studies history they will realize that it is historically accurate.
1554;The cinematography in this film is incredible.
1555;The acting is so well done that you are forced to identify with each character.
1556;Few films are create magic anymore.
1557;Thank you for reading this.
1558;A lot of people were surprised when Line racked up seven Oscar nominations, including one for Best Picture, the year that Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan raked in the bucks and the critical acclaim.
1559;awaited followup to Days of Heaven yesterday, I thought a lot about how boldly contemplative, achingly beautiful, and curiously flawed it was and came to a realization: I'd watch this one again before I did Ryan.
1560;What Line has in spades, though, is the ability to create a beating heart and soul for those young, scared men who braved the deadly shores of Guadalcanal.
1561;name stars have less, and the movie has the same gorgeous fascination with the natural world as Heaven.
1562;"what makes Line an arguably more fascinating journey than its same.year WWII flick is that dive deep into the soul that it attempts, and usually succeeds, to make
1563;The Thin Red Line is far from perfect, but it's as close to capturing the spiritual and philosophical side of war than any movie I've seen.
1564;'My uncle/father/etc was at Guadecanal Canal', therefore I am the true judge of a good movie.
1565;A good movie gets a reaction.
1566;So truth be told this movie is brilliant.
1567;Its message is of humanity with all its glory and beauty shining through.
1568;Its about goodness, friendship and love weighed againts the twisting vines of war, desperation and lonliness.
1569;Its about finding a spark within the individual, to acknowledge evils, acknowledge death, but to rise above it.
1570;Its just the netting that holds the true meaning of the movie in check.
1571;Simply a great movie full of nuance.
1572;Nick Nolte is outstanding in this movie as is Sean Penn.
1573;Consider the juxtaposition of man made conflagration over """"property"""" with the serenity and beauty of nature."""
1574;"The ""dear John"" letter scene is classic."
1575;Private Ryan was 1 of the best movies ever!
1576;A monent of peace and tranquility amoung the terror and fear of war.
1577;If you want to see a great movie.
1578;"I thought, ""The time has come for me to enjoy this!"""
1579;This film is not only one of the greatest war movis ever made, it is also one of the greatest films ever made.
1580;It is a beautiful juxtaposition of the beauty of nature and the horror of war.
1581;Amazing national geograpic style visuals (every frams is like a beautiful photo) and an amazing score.
1582;Amazing perfomances all round with the exception of John Travolta (who trys to be just too cool).
1583;The Criterion Collection has released a superb 2.
1584;disc edition of Terrence Malick's 1998 film adaptation of James Jones' novel of World War II.
1585;i know that a lot of people think that this is the greatest war movie ever made but, unfortunately, I'm not one of them.Yes, visually it is absolutely stunning and it has some powerful scenes and terrific performances (e. g. Nick Nolte, Elias Koteas, John Savage).
1586;as in all of Malick's movies, the nature shots are fantastic, yet its dramatic structure is almost non.
1587;on the other hand, Criterion's new transfer for this film is magnificent, and they've also included their usual array of first.
1588;rate extras, including audio commentary by cinematographer John Toll and others, interviews with many of the cast members and production staff, deleted scenes, audition tapes, a very informative and touching interview with James Jones' daughter, WW II newsreels of Guadalcanal and much more.
1589;page booklet, filled with essays about the picture.
1590;if you like this movie, then this is certainly the edition to own.
1591;Yes the adrenaline but also the greyness that enters in during an extended campaign.
1592;Because the charactors respond in this context so believablely and honest, some truly vivid scenes are possible.
1593;probably right up there with Saving Private Ryan.
1594;this one has to much talking but its the point of the story people, if you didnt like it, dont watch it.
1595;with powerful performances by Penn, Nolte, Koteas, Chaplin and Caviezel.
1596;The opening few minutes are lush and full of imagery and feeling.
1597;The haunted look on Private Witt's (James Caviezel) face, the eerie chanting of the villagers, the trepidation that the girl had for soldiers and what they represented, the sheer joy Witt got out of simply being able to share in the normal village life, and the dread that he showed when realizing that his AWOL jaunt was up .
1598;I felt all that and got the mood .
1599;the beauty of the scenery with sun and shadow playing across the fields of shimmering tropical grasses and the beautiful birds in the trees .
1600;setting the mood, creating anticipation, hinting at deeper things to be.
1601;good: I liked the cinematic production.
1602;The combat footage is rather good, and from time to time the tactics are also reasonably accurate.
1603;But, great work by the cinematography crew and technical adviser.
1604;The theme and message of this movie are incredible.
1605;This is one of the best, or the best pacific based movies of ww2.
1606;(a lot better than Windtalkers, even though the action scenes and explosions in that movie are great.
1607;Lots of great famous actors star or pop out throughout the movie.
1608;On one hand you have brilliant visuals, thought.
1609;provoking musings from the characters about man's inhumanity towards man, and a terrific performance by Nick Nolte as Lt. Colonel Tall.
1610;He then returns at the end and his death is the emotional finale of the movie.
1611;director Terence Malick's brilliant philosophical musings about life, voiced by the characters, don't work here.
1612;I found the middle part of the film the most interesting, and not coincidentally because it starred because Nolte's Lt. Colonel Tall is heavily featured in them.
1613;Nolte is brilliant in the role.
1614;How rare it is anymore that film aspires to art.
1615;Not only does, The Thin Red Line, aspire, it stands as a magnificent achievement.
1616;As Mort Sahl stated, for better or worse film is the literature of the twentieth century, and in that vain this film is worthy of reading, studying, and contemplating for what it reveals of nature, man, and humanity.
1617;The art of conveying ideas and powerful visual metaphors within a story worked with David Lean.
1618;Director Terrence Malick brilliantly portrays the dichotomies of life and death, of humankind's dark, yet brilliant soul, and nature's beauty and indifference in this adaptation of the 1962 James Jones war novel.
1619;This cinematic masterpiece boasts extraordinary acting performances from a cast of actors including Nick Nolte, Adrien Brody and Sean Penn.
1620;Cinematography and soundtrack in this film are lush and beautiful, the camera work is astounding.
1621;The Thin Red Line is a sensual, rich and emotive journey through a South Pacific island jungle during the WWII battle of Guadalcanal.
1622;They first saw Saving Private Ryan and loved it.
1623;I feel Saving Private Ryan is a great film and is perhaps greater than The Thin Red Line , but one of the reasons I admired this film was because it wasn't like Saving Private Ryan .
1624;This is a fantastic film that many people have put down, and while I see where they're coming from, I really believe that they're missing the point of the movie.
1625;Oh and read the book of the same name by James Jones, it to is amazing.
1626;But I watched it 3 times and loved it.
1627;Yes it was slow but it dealt with very real characters and took on a big task of trying to show every aspect of a soldier's life in the war.
1628;Heck, I don't even think it was the best war movie ever made.
1629;On the plus side, the cinematography is some of the most beautiful ever filmed.
1630;The lush green scenery is used to good effect here.
1631;When you view The Thin Red Line you detect poetry, originality, and destruction.
1632;Nothing has ever been so effective, and what can I say?
1633;Terrence Malick's Days of Heaven was just a pure joy to watch.
1634;nosed but compassionate sergeant major (Sean Penn) to take his platoon full of misfits up an enemy infested hill.
1635;schmartsy dream sequences and beautiful shots of South Pacific real estate.
1636;Besides the exquisite cinematography, haunting music and moving performances it goes beyond the obvious horror of war in several respects: soldiers play their roles and reveal their characters in how they come to grip with what is expected of them.
1637;I just wish it received more attention when it came out.
1638;One reviewer described it as a National Geographic Special.
1639;Lovingly photographed in exquisite detail, the beauty of the Solomon Islands and their indigenous inhabitants provides a powerful backdrop for these questions.
1640;the words, only intelligible to a tiny minority, sung in a language that itself was born in the violence of colonial and religious imperialism, gesture to a spiritual realization that transcends the historical accident that gave it a particular form.
1641;He can only gesture to the profound mystery of its imminence, which has the miraculous power of revealing itself most clearly at times, like war, of violence and suffering.
1642;When I left the theater my mind was full of the beautiful images I had just seen.
1643;I feel that a movie to a great degree is a visual story.
1644;It said a great deal, sometimes without using a single word.
1645;For example the scene were the soldiers are first walking onto the island and a native walks by without even looking at them!
1646;It was a personal adventure for everyone who saw it.
1647;I loved the scene where one of the soldiers gets a letter from his beloved wife saying she is leaving him for someone else.
1648;Because you know that that really happened to some of them.
1649;I think time will reveal the true genius of this film.
1650;Give it another chance if you already saw it and if you missed it, you missed a classic and a beautiful work of art.
1651;This movie was quickly added to my personal top 15 films ever made.
1652;After a 20 year absence, director/writer Terrence Malick returns with this adaptation of James Jones' novel.
1653;The camera work is spectacular as scenes change from jungle to rivers to mountains and grassy fields.
1654;It has a great cast supported by the likes of Ben Chaplin, John Cusack, Adrien Brody, John C. Reilly, Woody Harrelson, John Travolta and George Clooney (the latter two in cameos).
1655;Hans Zimmer's score is terrific and punctuates the scenes perfectly.
1656;"In a year that also saw ""Saving Private Ryan,"" ""The Thin Red Line"" secured 7 Oscar nominations including Malick (directing and screenplay), Toll and Zimmer among them."
1657;Here he balances the brutality of war with serene moments, poetic voice.
1658;overs and thoughtful long pauses.
1659;Still it is one of the great war films.
1660;but I do feel moved to tell you that I've watched this film repeatedly since it came out in 1999.
1661;And I continue to love every long minute of it.
1662;I can only repeat: I love this movie.
1663;It is a work of art.
1664;It is the most philosophical movie I know of.
1665;It is a mystical experience captured on celluloid.
1666;every time I watch it, it pervades my heart and my mind with warmth, wonder and depth.
1667;In a word, it's beautiful.
1668;on one level, it is a film that questions man's place in nature.
1669;these soldiers, all of them on both sides, are blind to the incredible beauty of the paradise island on which they fight.
1670;He believes his wife to be the most beautiful person in the world, a woman he thinks is so trustworthy that he has given over his own soul to her.
1671;"But he's betrayed by a ""Dear John"" letter."
1672;She's written to confess she's in love with an Air Force officer, and wants a divorce.
1673;Please show me how You see things, one sergeant prays.
1674;"The fuller question is, ""What's the right equation between man and nature and God?"""
1675;"In addition: ""What's the right equation between man and his own Self?"
1676;The end of the film intimates that all these puzzles are created by the shining Self of mankind as a whole.
1677;searching American seems sincerely inclined to explore that route.
1678;over of introspective speculations about man, God and nature appeal to the thoughtful Western.
1679;The happy islanders continue to find peace within themselves and with nature, singing their hymns to God.
1680;Both the cinematography and Hans Zimmer's score are excellent, and technically it's masterful.
1681;In summary, it looks and sounds gorgeous, goes on far too long, seems to think itself a lot more profound than it is, and coule have done with some editing.
1682;but you would be missing out on an extraordinary piece of cinema.
1683;Its incredible beauty and wonderful acting give you release from your day.
1684;day reels of celluloid, and show you a revelatory experience.
1685;that is, if you have patience and an open mind.
1686;It is an epic battle, of ideas, emotions and images.
1687;As much as I love Apocalypse Now and Platoon, these were merely films with political points to make, but for me this film was more of a spiritual experience.
1688;I've seen it 11 times thus far, and like all great movies, new riches are discovered every time you see it.
1689;Don't worry I haven't spoiled anything with these discriptions, because the film is an experience that can't be described with words, it is dramatically/photgraphically/spiritually and thanks to Hans Zimmer's brilliant score, musically a masterpiece.
1690;Firstly, The Thin Red Line is a stunning war movie and one of my favorites.
1691;This movie is a complete masterpiece!!!
1692;Likened by me to classics such as 2001, Apocalypse Now and Tarkovski's work.
1693;it contains beautifull cinematography, a wondrous score from Hans Zimmer and fine performances particulary from Nick Nolte.
1694;in no way is it a glorifying picture like Saving Private Ryan.
1695;On the contrary it's a more humane and spiritual film containing elements of fear, compassion and loneliness.
1696;I dont think any film to date has touched on this level of thoughtfullness.
1697;in the years to come this film will be remembered as the masterpiece it is unlike the other overrated films of the 90's.
1698;long live Mallick and his work and I can say in confidence that of my own opinion this is the finest picture ever made.
1699;The leading elitist entertainment magazines generate thier hype, selling the idea that this director's return will be something of a treat.
1700;Chances are most of us have never heard of him, yet we are told to be excited that he is finally making another film.
1701;Then, when the film is released, we read about how great it is, and we want to go see it.
1702;So we go see it, and then those of us with a reasonable level of intellingence wonder what it was that we missed.
1703;The film also bombards us with nature imagery that is pretty but cryptic in meaning.
1704;A bizarre film and a great film are not the same thing.
1705;He shows up right near the end of this 170 minute snoozer and has about a minute of mostly backround dialogue (during a voice.
1706;I will give this movie it's props for being beautifully filmed and having a good soundtrack though.
1707;Personally, I thought The Thin Red Line was one of the best movies I'd seen in a long time.
1708;"It is truly a piece of art
1709;brainer mood for this one!
1710;Personally, I love every second of most of his movies (Not a big fan of New World), and this is my favorite of his as well as my all time favorite movie.
1711;The other shortfall of this film is the script which starts off solidly and takes the viewer into a captivating battle for a hill, definitely the high point of the film.
1712;BTW you made a much better film than Spielberg but it could have been great had you sacrificed a little arty self indulgence for a slightly more objective representation of the reality of Pacific warfare.
1713;The cinematography of the film adds to the paradoxical poetry of Destruction in the Face of Beauty.
1714;The outstanding cast and perfectly played lead present a world where man's claim to what he is is questioned and whether man can choose which side of the line to be on.
1715;I classify this as my personal favourite of all time.
1716;It's artistic nature is not for all, but it's sheer beauty and peotry speak more of the realty of war in relation to not the platoon, but the soldier himself.
1717;Having been released during a great film year (Shakespeare in Love, Life is Beautiful, Private Ryan.)
1718;Bring an open mind to this film"
1719;Malick made an unparalled classic in Badlands which I saw when I was nine.
1720;A lot of rising stars make appearances that are shorter than cameos.
1721;Althought both movies are great, you really can't compare them.
1722;It has a really good cast, with many talented actors.
1723;The plot is well written, and the beauty of the cinematography is unsurpassed, but the reason that I love about it, is the script.
1724;It is very poetic, and very surreal.
1725;It is more about a man's thoughts about life, and the nature of war.
1726;It was really a moving experience, and I love it for what it is.
1727;It is truly a classic war film, with not alot of violence, but with alot of emotion, and it leaves you thinking about the true nature of man and humanity, and how war effects us!
1728;ray offers a gorgeous rendition of The Thin Red Line, a film that demands to be seen in the best conditions possible.
1729;The difficult but beautiful film that marked the re.
1730;What gives it unity, to my mind, is the special attention the film gives to three relationships, each of which exemplifies one of the primary motivations that tend to drive human beings: honor and respect, love and desire, and truth and wisdom.
1731;Private Bell (Ben Chaplin) finds meaning in the memories of the beautiful wife he left behind.
1732;it's a gorgeous film, with an all.
1733;star cast that's outshined by the incredible imagery.
1734;excellant piece of work by Malick.
1735;those who fought or have been in a war can identify with this artwork.
1736;"When it came out, all the hype and attention went to ""Saving Private Ryan"" and it took me months to work up courage to see that film."
1737;"in hindsight, I wish this film would have won the Best Picture Academy Award in 1999, instead of the surprise win, ""Shakespeare In Love"" and the predicted favorite, ""Saving Private Ryan""."
1738;The Thin Red Line balances the war scenes with scenes of imagineable beauty, from the animals and the beautiful South Pacific island landscapes and it makes for a much more pleasant viewing.
1739;that it makes one wonder why people kill each other when they should be enjoying and preserving nature.
1740;This film manages to enlist the new generation of actors making a name for themselves in Hollywood today (Jim Caviezel, Adrian Brody) as well as stellar performances from Sean Penn and Nick Nolte.
1741;The intro scene, with Jim Caviezel cavorting with natives of some South Pacific island in what appears to be AWOL, was brilliantly done and set the tone for the rest of the film.
1742;The music and especially the singing of the Melanisians were outstanding!
1743;There is a certain spiritual lift one can get from listening to these simple people sing, and to see how they live in a true community.
1744;Who wouldn't want to drop out of a war to live the rest of their lives among these peaceful people?Though the film is long, it's worth watching because of the performance of Jim Caviezel and the overall message and tone this film ultimately conveys.
1745;i think the movie was made for more the actors pleasure then the audiences.
1746;after the review of the movie i usually give a synopsis of the storyline but there really isnt one what you see is what you get.
1747;The Thin Red Line ' is the kind of movie which needs a little heart, soul and mind to appreciate.
1748;Jim Caviziel, Sean Penn, Nick Nolte, John Cusack and Elias Koteas turn out hauntingly brilliant performances and do justice to a beautifully written script.
1749;a must for all those who appreciate good art.
1750;This, my friends, is one of the best you'll ever see.
1751;in my opinion it doesn't come close to Saving Private Ryan but it was good.
1752;Throughout the film he had flashbacks of her, their home, and what I thought was their relationship.
1753;the scenery throughout the film was wonderful: the ocean, the island, the lush tall grass, the bamboo stalks, the mountain stream, etc.
1754;It was no where near what I felt for Saving Private Ryan, which was an excellent film.
1755;I'll be interested to see how others view this film.
1756;I just want to make a basic point: people love to compare this movie to Saving Private Ryan, since both are war movies, and both came out in the same year.
1757;searing mindassaulting drama starring somebignames aand some of the most intense scenes ever.
1758;We can see, however,that Nolte wants glory forhimself, and offers it to his subordinants as a bribe.
1759;and is outstandingin his portrayal.
1760;Deserter, Jim Cavezel is constantly visited by whimsical and overwhelmingly beautiful flashback images of he and his wife, back homein the states.
1761;Their scenes of dreamlike lovemaking, allfully clothed, arewonderfullytouching and moving, and I was totally stunned when my wife was unimpressed with the footage.
1762;It is some of the most romantic materialever in the movies and well worth the timeto watch it.
1763;And, in a completely unexpected and jar.
1764;whrenching tenderness of japanese for each other,Marines for their comradwes and individual americans for their counterparts, which is the best part of the movie.
1765;It is a peaceful and touching end to a great movie experience, one which I will remember for a long time.
1766;pray for Peace,God bless you, Tony.
1767;The Thin Red Line is by far and without a doubt the best war movie I've ever seen.
1768;"One thing you really won't feel a lot of in this film, therefore, is an ""us vs. them"" sense of cheering for the Americans and hating the Japanese."
1769;this movie is truly a gem.
1770;This depiction is just simple minded and pure excrement.
1771;The scenery and photography is quite good.
1772;Get a classic like iwo or even wind talkers.
1773;This is Jazz on film, Malick takes a theme and riffs on it for two hours, it is brilliant
1774;"My son is very much into history
1775;Easily one of my favorite movies on the Pacific War theatre and top 10 of all.
1776;Criterion did a great job on this one.
1777;It is a profound work of art in a sea of drivel.
1778;This movie is a beautiful reflection war.
1779;I found it more thought provoking than Saving Private Ryan, which I believe came out at about the same time.
1780;this movie is visually stunning and even poetic.
1781;but reading some of the other reviews, I retained two comments I realy liked so will bring forward.
1782;At least I went alone, I didnt recommend and entice anyone else along to be ripped.
1783;baby, aint that the truth, thats the ideal companion to it.
1784;memorable line'Hey, P.51, Cadillac of the Skies!'
1785;with my interest peaked, and another movie about the same war to be seen, I decided I wanted to learn a little more about war in general, and the pain and anguish young men between the ages of 18 .
1786;I wanted to read the book first, and then watch the movie and see how well it followed along.
1787;the Worst Mistake:I have seen the movie, only after reading the book, and have heard/read a lot of great reviews, including the ones on this site.
1788;After hearing/reading all of these reviews, I can definitely see how this movie can be seen as 'philosophical', 'beautiful', 'poetic', etc.
1789;in short, had I not read the book, I may have enjoyed the movie.
1790;If you are planning on reading the book, dont see the movie.
1791;If you're not planning on reading the book, see the movie.
1792;All I remember thinking is, this is the strangest and most beautiful war movie Ive ever seen.
1793;This is actually the strangest and most beautiful ant.
1794;This is the most powerful depiction of the emotional and existential trauma of war that Ive ever seen.4.
1795;Sean Penn gives a wonderful performance as a sergeant who wishes he didnt care about anything.
1796;Adrien Brody is in one of the shortest and most memorable scenes, when his crew discovers a dead soldier.
1797;This is a gorgeous, profound film that a lot of people dont like.
1798;I am shocked by the number of glowing reviews this movie received .
1799;The cinematography is gorgeous, but does not save the movie.
1800;but as I got older and more mature, I wanted to see it again.
1801;now For the overview of acting, directing etc. the acting is sensational, there really isn't a best actor in this film, they're all brilliant in this film.
1802;the directing is very good in this and has great locations.
1803;The script speaks for itself, and the cinematography is magnificent.
1804;ps the director is releasing a film that looks just as good.
1805;name guys like Caviezel and Koteas turning in the performances they did is a massive tribute to them, the script and the director.
1806;The entire cast here definitely outdid 'Ryan' and everything else that year.
1807;One young man reflects on his life as a child, who witnessed his Mother's strength and bravery when she faced death"
1808;In one moment there's quiet contemplation and then sudden images of violence and explosive chaos.
1809;the camera's intensity matches the soldiers' heartbeats in this wonderful film.
1810;This film is a masterpiece of poetic cinema.
1811;and the most important opinion I can offer about this film.
1812;"but also forgiveable since the ""war"" theme is merely a backdrop, and historical accuracy is relatively irrelevant to the message of the film."
1813;the Thin Red Line is basically a profoundly philosophical morality play on life, death and the love that drives us through moments of sheer terror, and it is also a piece of deeply moving poetry that captures the beauty of life and the tragic sadness of our world.
1814;Students and afficionados of filmmaking will be treated to stunning visuals and technical mastery.
1815;"time top 20"" list of films, BUT."
1816;"it only ""works"" if you maintain the perspective that you're watching an ""art"" film, rather than an ""action"" film."
1817;To that effect, Nick Nolte provides the most interesting thing in this movie.
1818;I like a fresh approach to a genre such as Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket .
1819;But that was a compelling movie that can be watched several times, unlike this film which I would not recomend to anyone.
1820;Some have described the movie as ethereal and moodily philosophical.
1821;given the number of folks who seemed to have liked this movie, maybe it's a real hit.
1822;Visually, the film is gorgeous, with incredible locations and camera angles.
1823;The former film is very much like to yin to the latters yang.
1824;The film marks the return of Terrence Malick.
1825;Much like his two previous efforts, Days Of Heaven and Badlands, the film has a sweeping vision.
1826;Mr. Malick captures the lush beauty of the South Pacific and uses it to perfectly contrast with the destruction of war.
1827;The film uses Mr. Caviezels character in voice.
1828;This is a cinematic feast that is unlikely to be appreciated by audiences reared upon a diet of dumbed.
1829;provoking fare such as this.
1830;Like David Lean, Malick's films are alive with a sense of pure cinema with every frame delivering such detail and richness that you could swear you were there.
1831;It's a fantastic performance from a real pro and it's a mystery to me why he didn't get an Oscar.You won't see a more beautiful film about the horrors of war than this.
1832;Let the film speak for it self.
1833;There are a lot of big name actors in this movie who wind up playing small parts.
1834;Kudos to the Director who wound up leaving a lot of film on the cutting room floor to focus on the character of Witt portrayed by a young Jim Caviezel.
1835;I generally stay away from war movies, but this one I will watch again and again.
1836;The thin red line is argueably the best warmovie of all time.
1837;Acter 8 Name: elias koteas movie, the prophecy 1.
1838;The acting is amazing for a warmovie like this.
1839;Very emotional or very intense war movie.
1840;Also i like to throw in great narrateing to.
1841;Quite an interesting movie with many memorable moments but a lot of self indulging periods.
1842;I grant everyone scads of talent all around: it takes EXCEPTIONAL talent to turn such naturally exciting and interesting material into such a soporific wet noodle.
1843;Terence Malick's 'Thin Red Line' is quite possibly the finest work of cinematic art that has ever graced our screens.
1844;"malick's direction is simply genius
1845;And, indeed, the acting itself is remarkable.
1846;overs from numerous characters awards the picture with a great sense of dimension that crosses the proverbial board of mixed emotions.
1847;In doing so, it also goes against the notion of the classic Hollywood narrative"
1848;this epic masterpiece deserves to be placed on a par with 'Citizen Kane' and 'The Third Man' and the very least you could do is to invest in your very own copy and behold in the pure splendour that is 'The Thin Red Line'.
1849;very few words would do it justice.
1850;, except the thin red line has a better ending, so if you saw and liked this one I would recommend you see that.
1851;well I hope this review has helped you a bit.
1852;The transfer is good, but not great.
1853;"It was a fairly good movie
1854;About 15 years ago I finally read the book by James Jones and discovered that the similarities between the book and the movie were that it took place on an island in the Pacific during WWII and involved US and Japanese soldiers.
1855;With this in mind, I looked with great anticipation to the new movie version of """"The Thin Red Line"""" released in 1998."""
1856;"ironically, Billy Weber and and Leslie Jones were nominated for an Academy Award for Best Film Editing for their ""efforts"" in this movie."
1857;"Spare yourself the grief and enjoy the book instead
1858;Nick Nolte however outdid himself, very believable as a hard career bird.
1859;terrence Malick is hailed as a great visualist and genius, but how tough is it to film a beautiful South Seas island with blue oceans, slithering snakes, and green grasses?
1860;Yes, this film is to long and for you poetry lovers, I know good poetry and this ain't it.
1861;i will praise the battle scenes.
1862;This movie had some great photography, but it still lacked much of the need plot to keep any viewer entertained.
1863;For instance all of the sequences involving Ben Chaplin's character (Private Bell) and his beautiful wife (played by Miranda Otto).
1864;I still feel the spell of the particularly striking scene where the camera is upside.
1865;jim Caviezel's entire presence in the film itself a stand.
1866;For me it represents idealism destroyed by crushing reality but also the hope that there is something spiritually transcendent beyond death.
1867;a """"life moves on"""" image that at first left me somewhat befuddled when I first saw the movie."""
1868;has now indelibly joined the pantheon of haunting film endings for me.
1869;As I evolve, as I age I experience something fuller and deeper each time I revisit this film that only grows ageless with the passing years.
1870;whose impact we find in full force during this time of war.
1871;Having read the book, and looking at the cast of characters, I expected a pretty good film.
1872;"Don't waste your time on this one
1873;An amazing cast of actors is assembled in this powerful film set in Pacific during WWII.
1874;Film is longer than usual, but it goes fast because each character is deep exploration of human nature, psyche and togetherness that soldiers develop between each other while in combat.
1875;Deep, insightful, humaine in spite of the topic of war and brutality.
1876;The all so subtle style and beauty of Malick's approch to filmaking is inspiring.
1877;I must have seen this film over 100 times and still enjoy it just as much.
1878;Most of the others are all the same but this one had some real thought put into it.
1879;There was something about that moment of the going, the getting into, the necessary steps.
1880;then the sense of the events and The Machine of war and destruction taking over, and taking these men to those fields.
1881;I remember Gene Siskel saying he thought the film would have more of a personal impact and stay with you longer than Saving Private Ryan, with its Greatest Generation theme and all that.
1882;The music and images and words of this film have stayed with me over the years and fermented within me.
1883;The viscereal immediacy of that film is gripping, and it certainly has its moments, too.
1884;His last scene having to listen to that BS speech from the new Capt (Clooney) is just classic.
1885;I think that's the kind of moment that will live on long after the shock and gore of Braveheart (good film, still), Starship Troopers (childish), or Saving Private Ryan has subsided.
1886;It's poetry, and I usually don't even like poems.
1887;But I'm certain that's the right name for these feelings.
1888;this movie is not another war but conveys one message which is expressed throghout that every part of reality we see is just another face of the great soul of all .
1889;A good movie about about (perhaps) a not.
1890;interesting part of World War II.
1891;All the while panning through visually stunning pacific settings (director of photography John Toll should have won the Oscar here for best cinematography).
1892;This film shows the chaios on both sides of the fighting.
1893;Platoon, Saving Private Ryan"""", """"Full Metal Jacket"""", """"Glory"""", """"Black Hawk Down"""" and """"We Were Soldiers""""."""
1894;Perhaps the real story is the seemingly countless number of Hollywood stars to appear on the screen in the 170 minutes it takes to watch.
1895;"Nick Nolte delivers his best performace in decades
1896;Good movie, though long at just under 3 hours.
1897;If you want to make a movie based on spirituality and the aftermath of battle then do it in a way the audience will understand.
1898;Maybe if you are reading the script as you watch the film you will be able to fully grasp the message intended.
1899;One moment we are in preparation for battle the next we are whisked away to dreamland memories of a man, and who we can only guess is his wife, in a loving embrace.
1900;That everyone takes away what they want from this movie and form their own opinion of the film free from any bias.
1901;Two of the greatest movies of all time made great not only because of their grandure but beacause of their message.
1902;In both these movies there was a set objective and purpose which the main characters followed.
1903;Offering us insight into the workings of his mind.
1904;Charlie Sheen's purpose, in Platoon, is to survive his tour in Vietnam.
1905;His metamorphosis is further illustrated through his to his grandmother back home.
1906;the reason I gave this movie three stars is even though it is a confusing film it is still a tremendous work of art.
1907;The grandure of this film is awsome as well as the acting and the direction of every aspect of the film.
1908;A member of the audience summed it up best at the conclusion """"thank #%$ it's finally over!"""
1909;what really chapped me about this movie is that it was the Ross Perot of the 1998 Oscar race.
1910;"It didn't have a chance of winning, but took votes away from ""Saving Private Ryan"" allowing the saccharine sweet ""Shakespeare In Love"" to steal the Best Picture award from what is quite likely the best war movie ever made."
1911;Discover the true power of cinema.
1912;Try again, maybe it could be done right next time.
1913;There are a couple of funny moments in this film, but they are completely organic to the moment and the characters in that moment.
1914;PVT Bell's recollections of his wife during the most perilous situations is one of the most beautiful and devastating themes in the story.
1915;I would highly recommend it to film aficionados and cinephiles.
1916;I found the film a very moving experience, war isn't all action but hours of bordom punctuated by five minutes of mind numbing terror.
1917;The photography was superb, the action spot on and the characterisation close to perfect.
1918;Well done, a classic to be remembered forever.
1919;TRL achieves this masterfully with lush cinematography and masterful performances.
1920;Also the Malanesian Songs provided are quite a treat.
1921;war treatise is less effective on repeat and its pitch at the sublime is best savoured on big.
1922;Initially, the film moved me.
1923;Yet there are stunning cameo roles from Nolte, Penn, and Cavizel.
1924;But who could seriously quibble with an American director pitching at the transcendental, a glimpse of a better and redemptive world than the one thrust upon the terrorised youth depicted.
1925;"The will is embodied in Nick Nolte, who lives to fight and win, while recognizing that his way is the way of ""nature."""
1926;Nice story of war and the effects it has on young people, who are the ones that mostly fight them.
1927;Were eager to see new work, especially such an attractive cast in such an ambitious subject.
1928;THAT was more entertaining than this movie!
1929;I thought this was a very good movie.
1930;It had great acting between Nick Nolte, Jim Caviezel, and Sean Penn.
1931;But the ending was very interesting and effective.
1932;There were realistic and sometimes hand to hand combat secenes to, that showed the fear and the bravery of the men.
1933;I saw part of Saving Privite Ryan on TV, and though it seamed good, it just wasn't exactly what I expected of it.
1934;About the only thing going for it is excellent photography.
1935;Saving Private Ryan is a far better flick.
1936;Just know, it is NOT a war film, it is simply a meditation on mans relationship with nature, and perhaps their own nature.
1937;Truly a great movie, I wish I had the chance to give this movie *4 and 1/2* stars.
1938;I don't believe this movie is a classic movie, but it definitely deserves *4* stars.
1939;Definitely a movie that will be around as long as people are watching cinema.
1940;In my judgement, these attributes in no way take away from the fact that this is one stout war movie with very realistic and well shot battle scenes.
1941;The musical score is deep and true to the flow of the film.
1942;The acting is wholly convincing and as mentioned above, the battle scenes and action is solid.
1943;two of the more remarkable movies of the 1970s .
1944;In 1998 he resurfaced with THE THIN RED LINE, an adaptation of James Jones's 1962 novel set during the battle for Guadalcanal.
1945;"equally loved and hated, this is much more than an epic war movie
1946;beautifully photographed, the images reflect the surreal, often transcendent tone of the films deeper meaning.
1947;real sensual images of the natural world abound .
1948;the fine cast features Sean Penn, Nick Nolte, James Caviezel and Woody Harrelson.
1949;ray Criterion transfer is breathtaking.
1950;sympathetic to the Japanese, and not """"anti."""
1951;the only reason I gave this one two stars instead of one is that I was able to watch it to completion.
1952;Mind, I had to try multiple times, but I finally did finish it.
1953;basically its the moment where the Director being Mr. Terrence Malick would openly and honestly share his thought process, his poetic masterpiece, His spiritual inspiration and motivation for the entire film.
1954;It's so SAD that Mr. Terrence Malick chooses to be a hermit and isolate himself from the world and those that admire him and his films.
1955;this is one of my favourite films, because of the impression that it left on me when I finished viewing it.
1956;The cinematography is absolutely beautiful, so on the surface this film leaves an indelible impression.
1957;This is totally refreshing as the subjects are no longer predictably stalwart or weak.
1958;basically if you would like to watch a beautifully concieved film with an interesting plot and sublime performances from Nick Nolte and Sean Penn then see this film, because it really is a work of art.
1959;His efforts to portray war realistically while probing metaphysical matters through the lenses provided by character studies of men in an Army rifle company were quite uneven, but taken as a whole, brilliant.
1960;the movie captured the best of what Jones tried to accomplish, but meandered too much.
1961;a few other quibbles: Jones' frank and realistic exploration of homosexuality in a military context was dropped.
1962;"in the novel the men first dub him ""Bugger Stein"" and come to appreciate his good qualities only after he's relieved."
1963;as for the plus side of the ledger: The actors were superb.
1964;Even Travolta and Clooney managed to contribute much to the film's tone through their abbreviated appearances.
1965;an excellent film with some serious flaws.
1966;to work with them was both a pleasure and honour.
1967;this might be an arty farty movie but it is among the best.
1968;anyway it won most of the awards that matter.
1969;i just hope that terrence malick does another movie soom and that i have the priviledge of working with such a visionary director again.
1970;Very introspective and not for those who want a clearly defined plot and ending.
1971;Malick really knows how to capture emotions and internal struggles on film.
1972;A lot of good things have already been said here about this movie , so I will just make a couple of quick observations:.
1973;if you will listen closely, much of the voice.
1974;over narration is prayer, pure and simple.
1975;The musical score (especially the excerpts from Faure's Requiem ) help us share that perspective.
1976;I have to admit, the cinematography was well done and the film was beautiful.
1977;This is isn't war, it's a National Geographic Special on the Rainforest.
1978;Saving Private Ryan is better, and it was recognized with 5 Academy Awards.
1979;The horrific battle scenes and excellent score by Mr. John Williams.
1980;day account of World War II.
1981;And I love the realism created when an entire army with machine guns can't take a well secured enemy shelter, yet one guy with a six shooter takes them out without any resistance.
1982;Mr. Malick, for the love of film goers everywhere, take a lesson from Spielberg, Coppola and Stone and realise that dirty men and a fleeting shot of an amutated limb a war film does not make.
1983;Simply not an enjoyable film.
1984;But I think this movie is a good and real movie.
1985;It draw the mental parts of both sides(American and Japanese soldiers).
1986;but it still has enough action and war parts.
1987;, the inner words and motion can still be understanded.
1988;and we can have our idea of the price of peace and human rights.
1989;totally speaking, it's a good film ,and I like it.
1990;the acting in this film is horrendous.
1991;John Savage does play a lunatic, but he comes off as the comic relief.
1992;There is a stellar performance by Jack (no last name) as old man walking through the field .
1993;No doubt that the acting and cinematography were good.
1994;With expectations set for that genre, the film is top notch.
1995;The film has plenty of both bullets and tactics, but the main point (and what makes the film work) is the beauty of God shining through in both the ordinary and extrordinary.
1996;On those terms, this film truly earns five stars.
1997;It is a work of art.
1998;watch this film as you would a mini.
1999;Upon later viewings, the poetry comes to life and one sees how it relates to what is happening.
2000;what makes this film great is the cinematography, the landscape, the music, the lyrics from the book, and some splendid acting.
2001;The infantry attack sequences are breathtaking and the camera work and musical sequences complement them perfectly.
2002;The film's emotional and artistic climax comes with the storming of a Japanese camp at the top of a hill after days of horrific fighting.
2003;But it compares well to Band of Brothers or Saving Private Ryan (both of which are also excellent).
2004;It's definitely worth watching if you like war movies or enjoy great cinema.
2005;This is one of the deepest movies I've ever seen.
2006;Malick follows a simple formula of showing an action shot, then a nature shot, then a psychological shot, and finally back to an action shot.
2007;Oh boy, this is definately the best comedy of all time!
2008;If you want a war film that is poetic and not cheap, watch Apocalypse Now.
2009;To put it succinctly, the novel is amazing.
2010;Some of the good guys would die, and there might be a bitter sweet element, but basically good would triumph, the soldiers would (mostly) do the right thing, find their inner bravery, rise to the occasion and so on.
2011;I found it to be extremely beautiful, very moving in parts, very hard to watch in parts due to the horrific violence.
2012;Through intense visual storytelling, the movie attempts, successfully for me, to convey not just what is happening, but how the characters' pasts continue to inform what they're experiencing now, how they continue to exist in nature, even while they are engaged in extreme violence.
2013;overs drift into precious, artsy territory, but for the most part the device is very effective.
2014;All in all, this is a very special film that I'd guess viewers will have a strong reaction to, either positive, as in my case, or negative.
2015;They wanted a film that compelled you through intense visual imagery and used that imagery to convey a sense of the horrors of war.
2016;Rather, it gives a deep look into many of the important things in life through the medium of war.
2017;The Thin Red Line gives you a much more broad based view of the effects of war and may very well be the finest war film ever made, if only it were truly about war.
2018;It was very unconventional and that is what made it great.
2019;(This is a rather niche review, but hopefully it will help some people.)
2020;First off: the movie is great, among my favorites.
2021;Was very happy to see it available on blue.
2022;You either like this film or you dont but I loved it.
2023;conciousness elliptical langorous film is well worth the time.
2024;Instead of taking the normal bloody route great war films usually take, it took the poetic, much more intellectual path.
2025;Also, like Contact , it explored and questioned the true value of human life and nature of living things, while Ryan made its own conclusions with in.your.
2026;Terrence Malick may well be the next Stanley Kubrick.
2027;His quiet, beautiful, confident attempt at storytelling in this film reminded me of 2001: A Space Odyssey.
2028;Beautiful, haunting, poetic, surreal, thought provoking.
2029;"Jim Caviezel's performance as Private Witt is outstanding
2030;watch the movie to see how the two compared.
2031;I recomend both to anyone interested in the topic of war and philosophy.
2032;The Thin Red Line is beautifully filmed, and even the tragedies of war are rendered in flawlessly gorgeous sequences.
2033;malick captures the extraordinary sense of the jungle by using a montage of brief shots on light filtering through leaves, on the various creatures of the jungle and on the far.
2034;I suppose that is partly why I love the movie so much.
2035;There is a great juxtaposition of beauty and violence.
2036;The Thin Red Line does explore the dark depths, but it is much more subtle, nearly serene in its take that feels profound.
2037;This is a film about the struggle of truth and beauty and love against the nihilistic, empty, self indulgent aspirations of the leaders of men, of human society.
2038;It's a touch more subtle than that.
2039;And it is wonderful and it is powerful and it is important, so long as cares about things such as truth and beauty and love.
2040;I enjoy this movie and the book that it was modeled after.
2041;Whenever I need items such as this I always check Amazon.
2042;Great job yet again Amazon :)
2043;Every single frame of this movie is a work of art.
2044;Put together, and added to a story which is really a complex set of philosophical reflections on war, life and death, this is just sublime.
2045;Elegiac, surreal, beautiful, horrifying and brilliant.
2046;Everything that's needed to be said about this powerful, revolutionary movie has I'm sure been stated earlier, but I feel compelled to share my view also.
2047;First and foremost I have a tremendous amount of respect for any movie and it's director that has the courage to show war in such an unconventional manner.
2048;Without question the cinematography is incredible, but the real acclaimation may be better directed at the actors involved here.
2049;I found myself drawn to many of these characters, even though they only revealed their true characters in stages.
2050;like, soul searching private completely possesses his role, and looks to be a formidable talent .
2051;the interaction between himself and the always dependable Sean Penn is cracking.
2052;Nick Nolte is highly convincing as a grainy, world.
2053;That said, if you ARE in the right mood, it's absolutely incredible.
2054;This was my second favorite movie of 1998, and would have been a shoo.
2055;it is very, very artsy, incredibly slow .
2056;The first act serves to set up the characters .
2057;The majority of the film is one extended battle scene, intercut with brief flashbacks and voice.
2058;the battle scenes are amazing (second only to Saving Private Ryan in my opinion).
2059;They're brutal, horrifying, and at times beautiful due to the amazing cinematography.
2060;The second act is as immersive, brilliant, and haunting as any film that I have ever seen.
2061;Nolte is riveting and intense as the colonel in charge of the operation.
2062;He is absolutely perfect .
2063;genuine, sympathetic, sincere, and yet strong when he needs to be.
2064;it was my second favorite movie of 1998, Ryan was my first.
2065;I highly recommend both of them, and consider them to be the two best war movies ever made.
2066;all in all, The Thin Red Line is filmmaking of an incredibly high order.
2067;It's slight faults are easily offset by the sheer brilliance of what is done right.
2068;films this unconventional, powerful, and thought.
2069;There are good and great war movies out there.
2070;I think this is Malick's best work to date, and that is because, like Braveheart and Schindler's List, there are scenes in this film that I will never completely shake.
2071;What about those hauntingly gorgeous lyrical memories the one soldier had throughout the fighting of the sensual times he and his wife shared?
2072;And that's one of things that works for this movie: it's so personal.
2073;Second, for some reason the art venders have attached themselves to this film and like to compliment it for its art and finesse and artistic finery (or whatever).
2074;gritty, emotionally wrenching, and hard.
2075;around powerhouse performance, and the scene where he was on the field phone with Sean Penn proves it.
2076;The amount of intensity that man put into his acting is outstanding.
2077;First off, the cinematography was excellent and the cast was unsurpassed.
2078;Malick has a vision in this film, almost Apocalypse Now like vision, showing the motivation behind each character.
2079;That part is not the problem, telling the emotional and mental pain soldiers go through while at war is a wonderful goal.
2080;The short scene with John Cusack is the most exhilarating scene in this film and the best one I've seen in quite awhile.
2081;Terrence Malick created a masterpiece, unlike anything that I have ever seen before.
2082;This is a sprawling epic with magnificent performances from all involved, especially Jim Caviezel, who was a new face at the time.
2083;Nick Nolte gives the performance of his career, right behind his work in The Prince of Tides.
2084;This is a work of art.
2085;Films like THE THIN RED LINE are the reason that I love movies in the first place.
2086;I want to be moved, and this film did exactly that, many times over.
2087;This is a great film about an Army unit on Guadalcanal after the Marines had taken it, but left it to the Army to cleanup remaining enemy soldiers still on the island.
2088;They loved it because of its artistic features.
2089;You got better combat action in the television show Combat!
2090;I would only recommend this movie to insomniacs with a high threshold for pain.
2091;The movement of the camera through the shoulder high grass, guiding the audience through the soldiers eyes, is really masterful.
2092;Every shot is crafted to perfection that any one could be a work of art.
2093;a powerful film that deserves a place in everyone's collection.
2094;From the opening shot, which simply tracks an alligator submerging itself in the water, you realize this is going to be one of those movies with gratuitous scenery shots.
2095;I think The Thin Red Line is the best movie of all.
2096;It is a masterpiece and the best war movie that I've ever seen.
2097;A brilliant direction, a wonderful cinematography, a perfect music score and magnificent plays.
2098;If you've seen Badlands and Days of Heaven, you'll be happy to learn that Malick continues to provide beautiful prose with stunning imagry (John Toll) and moving music (Hans Zimmer).
2099;This is an intelligent film on the conflicts/horrors of war and the toll it exacts on mens' lives.
2100;Malick's unique vision is one that I hope we see again.
2101;This film moved me when I first watched it.
2102;the music is perhaps Hans Zimmer's best.
2103;I dare to say it's the best match of music and images that I have ever seen.
2104;it's high art, not a popcorn movie.
2105;It breaks all the rules of story telling by taking a well written novel on war with a dozen major characters,while using the characters,he bypasses what is their narrative,with a musing upon the nature of existence,turning it into a mainstream.
2106;embracing,Whitmanesque"
2107;gita,The Iliad,The Grapes of Wrath,he infuses myths into the lifeblood of the film's imagery,giving it primacy,beauty and poetry,not plots and characters,presenting unmediated,uninterpreted reality.
2108;He tossed away the straight narrative adaptation(transitions,expository scenes), filling the film with an elegiac,epiphanic symphony.
2109;the characters present the world in all its variety,as something to be faced with reverence.
2110;War/nature are both cosmic and local.
2111;that Malik exists in America is what is astonishing.
2112;i found it to be great film with an excellent musical score that includes traditional Melanesian choruses which I really enjoyed.
2113;this is a great film and I highly recommend this edition over earlier ones.
2114;What he has given us is a film with an intellectual impact that exceeds its emotional impact.
2115;It is truly in a class by itself and It wholeheartedly deserves to be acknowledged as a work of art of the highest degree.
2116;the Thin Red Line opens with perhaps the most beautiful fifteen minutes of movie I have ever seen.
2117;"After a poignant scene of Witt's mother's death, Witt wonders about his own: ""I just hope I can meet it the same way she did."
2118;The ongoing interaction between Welsh and Witt serves as the backbone of the film, but many other scenes contain the same strange mystique.
2119;scale World War II film, Saving Private Ryan.
2120;But what really tipped the scales is our modern.
2121;Admittedly, this film is a triumph of style over substance, and the film's ambitions far outreach its abilities, but it's nonetheless a movie that warrants your attention.
2122;but it is nice when you can follow the bloody thing.
2123;What a profound and moving film.
2124;mallick is an artist, a true film maker, most certainly not a 'movie maker'.
2125;I love that line as they board the plane, goes something like 'you're all are my sons, my precious sons' I like to think that is the Earth talking to them.
2126;Hans Zimmer pulls out the best score he's ever written, it's kind of derivative of Henyrk Gorecki but we'll let that one fly this time.
2127;in summary, a rare breed of film from Hollywood, please Mr. Mallick make some more, the world needs more directors like you.
2128;Is this movie superior to the vastly popular Saving Private Ryan?
2129;this movie is pure cinematic poetry caught on film.
2130;That war corrupts the mind, the soul and ultimately nature.
2131;there are some very breath taking scenes, the way Malick captures the land scape, where the clouds disperse and sun light bathes a quiet, tranquil field then all of a sudden gun fire crackles, mortars go off, U. s. soldiers charging an unseen enemy.
2132;You see G. i. Helmets immersed in the tall grass as they disappear among the green.
2133;this is great news!The acting is top notch, from Sean Penn, Nick Nolte, Jim Caviezel, John Cusack, and some bit roles by John Travolta, George Clooney, Woody Harrelson, Jared Leto, All of them I think didn't care about their screen time they just wanted to work with a great director who just took a 20 something year hiatus from film making, after directing Days of Heaven in '78 I believe and came back with this tour de force.
2134;i've seen this movie a half dozen times or so and I am still awed by it, the photography, the music, it's a beautiful film indeed with such deep themes of the human mind and spirit.
2135;please check out The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, I believe another movie that is poetic like, thought provoking, visually beautiful, with top notch acting.
2136;The film is ostensibly about WWII, but by the way it's shot, costumed and written, we're meant to think of Vietnam.
2137;"And from this we are hearing that this is such a ""deep"" and ""profound"" films, that Malick has gotten a lock on Truth with this picture."
2138;the Andrew Sisters would be kitschy, but little brown kids singing Melanesian songs, that makes the film feel Important.
2139;"jaded Sean Penn telling a busted Ben Chaplin he may be the best friend he's got in this man's army
2140;even the somewhat interesting challenge of authority in the scene between Elias Koteas and Nick Nolte was done better and more surrealistically and """"insanely"""" by Robert Duvall in Apocalypse Now."""
2141;The movie shows all the varying responses to it.
2142;"comments like, ""real GIs didn't act that way"" by people who were born 30 years after the war was over are particularly amusing, since such reviewers clearly got their view of how soldiers are ""supposed to act"" from watching other movies, rather than having experienced war firsthand."
2143;Probably the best war movie ever made.
2144;The story is interesting and well filmed.
2145;This is one film you will have to see for yourself.
2146;one can tell you what this film is like and lets all be honest regardless of the side of the fence you are on .
2147;i think it is really well presented and has some music extras which i enjoyed.
2148;or even better see it in the movies if you can because a few years from now .
2149;at a dinner somewhere with someone you want to impress, you will be able to say 'actually i saw that movie on its first release.'
2150;There's something consistently sublime about it's dialogue and cinematography that I appreciate more with each viewing.
2151;A deleted scenes feature would be fascinating to see in a future edition.
2152;Inference is a more powerful tool in explaining the terror of real violence.
2153;Pretty good battle in the middle.
2154;This film is nothing like Saving Private Ryan, which is an exceptional film in its own right, but makes attempts at other things.
2155;Absolutely brilliant performances all around, particularly by Nick Nolte.
2156;The personal side, the absolute true emotions sparked by war are portrayed in this film.
2157;Jim Caviezel is one with nature (habitat boy).
2158;There are plenty of shots to make any cinematographer jealous.
2159;"house enthusiasts with ""Badlands"" and ""Days of Heaven"", visionary director, Terrence Malick, was back with a take on James Jones WWll epic ""The Thin Red Line""."
2160;His films are a grab bag of great performances, beautiful framing, gorgeous photography and long groggy stretches of emptiness.
2161;Quite frankly I thought The Thin Red Line was brilliant.
2162;You really got the feeling that this was some kind of sacrilege in this beautiful setting.
2163;I know a lot of people didn't like it but I saw it by myself and was really moved.
2164;This movie has great locations to watch.
2165;If there truley is a basic story of this movie.
2166;The Thin Red Line is a very good war movie set during the battle of Guadalcanal in the Pacific theater.
2167;For this reason, many people did not like this movie, but it is still very good.
2168;there is a very large cast in this movie with some big names.
2169;The thing that makes this movie good is the exceptional performances by the cast.
2170;Also, Hans Zimmer turns in another excellent musical score that includes the native of Guadalcanal.
2171;war rhetoric then this is definitely the film for you.
2172;Many people consider it among the greatest films to which they have beared witness.
2173;If great art can be defined as something which evokes powerful emotions, then The Thin Red Line certainly will meet that criteria.
2174;The director, Terrence Malick, made two critically.
2175;acclaimed masterpieces in the 70s that, while certainly influencial, never reached a wide audience outside film.
2176;modern film lasting three hours with endlessly complex messsages and themes.
2177;Certainly on the first viewing one will probably not be able to follow all of the plot, but that makes the film watchable and intriguing repeatedly as the beauty and complexity of the individual stories become more clear.
2178;even without interesting characters The Thin Red Line would be remarkable for its gorgeous, gorgeous, cinematography.
2179;I think the more times one sees the more complex and ineffable the film becomes.
2180;Recommended for anyone wanted to experience beautiful, complex, though.
2181;The Thin Red Line is a culmination of two great minds .
2182;Jones' novel is a great one, probably the best written by a civilian but it weaves such an intricate and finely detailed web that one would think it almost impossible to translate into celluloid without losing a great deal of its impact, however Malick's film of the battle of Guadalcanal is every bit as moving as Jones' prose.
2183;malick imbues the story with his own qualities as a director.
2184;If you have seen his film 'Days of Heaven' then you will know that he is a very visual director, as concerned with the intricacies of nature, of subtle movement and the dance of light as with the unfolding storyline.
2185;"for the most part though he manages to stay quite true to the novel and the strong characters in the book are brought wonderfully to life
2186;the deep thinking Pt Witt in Malick's film allows the director to channell the universal themes ever present in Jones' novel through the character and hence he becomes pivotal in the telling of the tale, one in which the fight against a foreign enemy takes a back seat to the battle within the self.
2187;Any one who served in the tropics knows how close to the mark this film is.
2188;This is the real stuff.
2189;I must say that this movie is the greatest war movie ever created, and in my opinion, the greatest movie ever created.
2190;charlie company, a company from the United States Army that serves in Guadalcanal.
2191;the war scenes are superb, better than Saving Private Ryan's(excluding the Omaha beach scene, which is perfect).
2192;The cinematography is also a ten, you'd have to see it to believe me.
2193;Directing is a nine, everything is very well organized, the sound and music are absolutely perfect,and finally the script, I give a six, because some parts follow the book exactly, and some contradict what the book says, which in some parts is good and some parts it's bad.
2194;I love this movie, and everything about it, though some vital parts in the book were left out, it still turned out pretty much immaculate.
2195;This was a great war movie.
2196;Excellent acting, great story line/plot, and great action and special effects during combat.
2197;Films like this one are rare"
2198;And as an unexpected twist to all this movie seeks to accomplish, Malick, despite his detractors, takes to the task in a strikingly humble way, allowing the viewer to easily choose from him or herself to take or leave' what Malick offers.
2199;While Malick may have taken liberties with plot and character details, he does prove himself to be a faithful student of Jones in exercising the very qualities that made Jones the powerful and effective artist that he was.
2200;watching this movie will demand attention and patience, and Malick will expect us not to be sqeamish or dull about the difficult spiritual, moral and philosophical questions that the human race has wrestled with since our earliest beginnings.
2201;The film carries out at a steady, slow pace, as though it is more a meditation than a movie, and seems to ask time and time again: With such beauty within and without us, why do we commit such horror upon ourselves?
2202;In a movie that seeks to show us humanity, that is perhaps one of the most enduring, most confounding, and most human of questions.
2203;is too cling to the remenants of that beauty and to the memory of beauty which has past away.
2204;It is an answer that is found, Malick reveals to us, in the deepest of our human motivations and longings, and from it springs the quiet, gentle hope that, as the Russian genius Dostoesky phrased it, beauty will save the world.
2205;Malick does a good job weaving beautiful almost artistic scenery with profound music and philosophical ponderings, while at the same time sharply contrasting with scenes of violence, horror, and dread.
2206;War movies of the past merely celebrated the glory and success of the covered altercations.
2207;"the ""Thin Red Line"" does something much more profound: it displays the human conditions ofthe soldiers ."
2208;It really moved me like nothing else has in a long time.
2209;I found its visual imagery and its powerful emotive force both riveting and deeply touching.
2210;it has multiple points of view among other things.
2211;You just have to be in the right mood for it.
2212;A good analogy: You wouldn't go to a bar one night and get all liquored up and then go to an art museum.
2213;Some guy gave it one star and said that this movie was brilliant.
2214;The fact that characters don't get enough airtime to make you care about them is actually a good thing.
2215;edited, they could trim it down about 1 hour, remove the voice.
2216;The marines all look like actors right out of acting school.
2217;Of course, all the women at home are beautiful with not a plump or pimply one among them.
2218;however, there are some well done battle scenes.
2219;Terrence Malicktook a big chance and he succeeded.
2220;Both deserve an Oscar for best picture.
2221;That's what makes it so valuable.
2222;"Twenty years from now, ""The Thin Red Line"" will still be regarded as a masterpiece."
2223;Saving Private Ryan will just be another excellent war movie.
2224;I thought this movie was a masterpiece.
2225;I felt that some of the interludes in the movies were a bit drawn out, otherwise it was great.
2226;after I thought about it though, the way in which this film was presented was in some ways superior to Private Ryan.
2227;The other thing that I found amazing in this movie was the camera work, it was simply awe inspiring.
2228;In the first major battle scene, if you watch the way the camera is positioned, it really gives you a greater feeling for the way the battle took place.
2229;an all around great movie.
2230;This is a movie experience above the usual.
2231;I watched this movie and even though it was three hours and didn't have the greatness of Private Ryan in the war scenes, I loved this.
2232;While the book focusses mainly on the thoughts of the cowardly Corporal Fife, the film successfully manages to float between the thoughts of around eight of the soldiers seamlessly.
2233;On comparison between the book and the film (which are inevitable), you'll notice that the characters in the film are far more romantic than they were in the book.
2234;I feel this greatly helps add to Malicks' celluloid masterpiece as the characters innate spirituality blends perflects with John Tolls fantastic cinematography.
2235;While Private Ryan and many other war films concentrate on plot, TTRL focuses on the characters plight and in understanding the emotions of the characters you will understand the film.
2236;this film also boasts a fine score by Hans Zimmer, again neatly sidestepping all of the usual war film cliches.
2237;No discussion of the production and how the focus of the film moved from Fife to Witt.
2238;This would have been of great interest.
2239;great filmmaking is often about passing on new concepts and ideas to your audience, subtly being the most effective method.
2240;Contrast this with Mr. Malik's ham.
2241;"it's been said that this TRL has as little to do with WWII as ""Apocalypse Now"" has to do with Vietnam."
2242;this is one of the few films i consider to be a perfect 5 star film.
2243;certainly its not perfect, but it deserves the 5 stars.
2244;well, the opening scenes are setting up soemthign that the audience must be lulled into.
2245;The effect is essential to the film as a whole.
2246;Paste together the water, the human aspirations, the hardness of nature, the softness, the thousandfold conflicts, rebellion, duty, power.
2247;if some of the soldiers are gonna pass out, well they'll just have to pass out!
2248;there is something good about the movie as well however.
2249;Awesome shots of nature and a very clear depiction of what men in combat go trough psychologically.
2250;i guess this is a nice example of taking creativity to far.
2251;It was very well done, and showed the fear and even panic on soldiers faces going into battle for the first time.
2252;I loved the montages and the cinematography blew me away.
2253;Funny how it took SPR a half an hour special effects bonanza to impress me, but a man's shadow in falling on a woman on a swing blew me away in TRL.
2254;The movie is a very interesting adaptation of the book.
2255;It was a clever adaptation.
2256;the acting is good but with all the voice overs it began to get difficult to figure out who was saying what.
2257;For those who are seriously interested in warfare and its effects on combatants, this film offers a great deal of insight.
2258;"Witt replies, ""I can take anything you can dish out."
2259;worthy performance by Nick Nolte.
2260;Nolte's performance as Tall anchors the major battle sequence in the film, and is so mesmerizing and memorable that it will remain carved in the viewer's memory long after the movie is over.
2261;high grass, the camera shifts to the birds.
2262;Eventually Gaff's team is able to get close enough to throw grenades into the enemy bunker and the position is captured, which makes it possible for the Americans to clear the Japanese from the ridge.
2263;handedly harass the advancing enemy.
2264;solid performances in Thin Red Line are given by Caviezel, Koteas, Nolte, and Penn.
2265;the Thin Red Line received six academy award nominations: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Sound, and Best Film Editing.
2266;After you see the movie, read the book, or vice.
2267;In place of James Jones' sharp characterizations and down.
2268;even so, there's no denying that this is a beautiful movie, which is responsible for one of my stars.
2269;But the book was a much more rewarding experience.
2270;I'll preface this review, and try not to sound like a complete rube, by saying that I've seen one other Malick movie, The New World, about a year before this one, and absolutely loved that.
2271;Plus, the number of big.
2272;I loved The New World, and really wanted to love this, especially with so many bits of greatness and beauty.
2273;so many people say that this movie is deep and insightful, that it is trying to analyze the dichotomies of nature and war, and how they fit together and yet, at the same time, contrast one another.
2274;I mean you may as well sit on the grass and say aloud ponder the many facets of a droplet of water, see how the light reflects from it.
2275;saving Private Ryan is superior in my opinion.
2276;It also touches on the emotional aspects of combat but is subtle about it, and so, is real.
2277;And the carnage on Omaha Beach is probably as realistic as anything I've ever seen.
2278;Witt (Jim Caviezel) is one of the most memorable characters in the history of cinema.
2279;this is a beautiful, profound film, even with all it's ugliness.
2280;Malick's masterpiece is worth your time.
2281;star cast with cameos by the likes of John Travolta and George Clooney.
2282;Nick Nolte shines as the gung.
2283;"other standouts include Ben Chaplin as Pvt. Bell, who's dearly devoted to a wife who may or may not deserve it (Miranda Otto)
2284;as you can see, the film explores the noblest and darkest reaches of the human heart and experience.
2285;As such, it's a picture that keeps giving no matter how many times you've watched it.
2286;In other words, it's full of hidden gems to glean with each viewing.
2287;In the end """"The Thin Red Line"""" towers alone in the annals of war cinema, a deeply spiritual triumph."""
2288;"I would not recommend this movie to anyone, rather, watch ""Saving Private Ryan"" for a more realistic portrayal of infantry war."
2289;The Thin Red Line insulted my intelligence.
2290;before praising it, I will explain why it might fail in some viewer's eyes:1) The cast is top heavy with celebrity stars and this can be distracting.
2291;Some are cast against type, other's performances are completely over the top like Nick Nolte and Sean Penn. james Caviezel, while not exactly a household name in 1998, carries the picture well and personally retains a particular yet recognizable Southern face perfectly suited to his character.
2292;It is structured more like a 'chick.
2293;flick': that is, as a slice of life than a deliberate story.
2294;The Thin Red Line's greatest achievement is on the spiritual/humanistic level and this is attained by more than just the dialogue.
2295;The major character's etheric philosophizing forces the viewer to witness Malick's visuals in a novel way.
2296;Composer Hans Zimmer weaves a beautiful and poignant aural tapestry of traditional melody with his own dark and majestic themes.
2297;the film is long and winding and will probably take two viewings to fully grasp it's particular rhythm and structure.
2298;Though the dialogue is often savage and angry the film is poetic in it's effect.
2299;Were it not for the constant distraction and confusion of the flashback scenes, this could have rated as one of the best World War II movies of all time.
2300;It is unlike any other movie I have seen in that aspect.
2301;ray so special with a ton of feature.
2302;so picture 5/5 sound 5/5 and feature 5/5.
2303;complicating things, the simplest approach is usually the best.
2304;this is one of the most complicated films ever made.
2305;After perusing some Amazon reviews, it is interesting to note the difference between this film and Saving Private Ryan , also released in 1998.
2306;Yet, what director Spielberg realized (as he usually does) is that the simplistic approach is the best.
2307;Hey, you're soldiers stopping foreign aggression before it ends up at your doorstep, it's been done before, and with conviction and honor by our WWII veterans.
2308;John Toll deserves praise for excellent cinematography, hence the stars.
2309;they draw me back to the film again and again.
2310;Like a true work of art, it defies easy characterization.
2311;At other times, nature reveals its own violent side.
2312;There are other scenes that fascinate me and have etched themselves in my mind.
2313;caviezel is perfect in what I think of as a Christ.
2314;One gaze from his eyes can convey so much.
2315;It's the best role I have seen him in.
2316;A fantastic, beautiful, compelling, and thoughtful film.
