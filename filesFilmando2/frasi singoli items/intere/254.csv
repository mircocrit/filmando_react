1;It is about a rich girl, Winnie, who stumbles across some odd people in the forest one day.
2;They soon reveal their secret that they drank some magical water and will stay young forever.
3;The movie is incredible and really made me think.
4;I thought this movie was great, and a wonderful love story.
5;I am a hopeless romantic, so if you like that kind of stuff, you will love this movie.
6;It made me laugh and cry and a good movie has to have those two quialities.
7;This movie is great for any ages and it really makes you think about life and how short it is.
8;If you read the book which I haven't but I will your in for a real treat!!!
9;the story is great and i wanted to get that music box that mae tuck had.
10;but thats not a big deal it's still a great movie.
11;So they moved back to the forest to be near the well.
12;my Comments:I liked this movie.
13;It won't likely win any awards, but it was kind of cute.
14;The story is a good concept and I was impressed with how the idea of the fountain of youth was approached.
15;It was an intriguing story.
16;it developed over a week or so and, though no one really knows what it would be like, Jesse was 104 years old compared to Winnie's paltry 15 years.
17;I was expecting this film to be excellent, having read the book and finding it to be one of the best novels I have seen.
18;I will add, for those who are not worried about the book that my family, who had not read the story, thoroughly enjoyed the film so it clearly can stand on its own.
19;so in summary I was seriously dissapointed and I imagine that most fans of the book would be as well.
20;One of my daughters all time favorite movies!
21;She will always go back to this when she wants to watch a movie.
22;Wow, this is a good movie.
23;My students loved it and it made for a great end to a unit.
24;Used the book as a novel study for my 5th grade class.
25;This is my daughter's favorite movie.
26;So glad I found it before Christmas.
27;She was so exited to get it Christmas morning.
28;Great to use in school to compare book, play and movie.
29;I love this movie and have loved it from the first time I saw it.
30;The theme of the movie has been one of man's quest for centuries.
31;I think the cast was perfect and that is why the acting was so good.
32;Every one of the actors did a superb job.
33;well, let me say that it was a very entertaining watch!
34;I loved the movie, Tuck Everlasting!
35;I thought it contained all the elements of a great story and terrific movie.
36;The acting was really terrific.
37;I think she truly captured the essence of the character.
38;This was a great movie.
39;but the book has much more detail.
40;I recommend this book as a must read in order to fully appreciate the movie.
41;This is a nice family movie, especially if children have read the book.
42;Its fun to compare and contrast the book with the movie.
43;Very sweet Disney movie which may be just a little too simple for the more sophisticated adults.
44;He also carries her back to his family in a rustic cabin deep in the woods.
45;He offers to help her father search for her, but it's clear he has some sinister motive.
46;Tuck Everlasting is a decent movie.
47;It's somewhere in between romance and adventure.
48;"Romance because it involves a young girl falling in love with a boy who has the ability to live for all eternity, and adventure because of the whole ""family living in the woods/running from the law"" aspect."
49;anyway, yeah, this family living in the woods discovers the fountain of youth.
50;A puddle of magical water residing by a tree that contains eternal qualities.
51;is the magical question of the day, haha.
52;Seeing the movie was a great way to relive the childhood glee.
53;The movie is a beautiful, moving tale about a doomed love story.
54;All the actors do a phenomenal job, and the scenery and costumes are beautiful.
55;I highly recommend this movie for anyone.
56;It is a timeless tale.
57;The acting is excellent (Sissy Spacek has a role), and the theme is similar to a more family.
58;The movie has some mild thematic scenes, a slightly spooky villain, and a bit of a romance.y element, culminated by a sweet kiss.
59;i got teary at the end.
60;After weeks of debate I finally caved and I'm happy I did.
61;It arived on time and works great.
62;Very happy I finally caved.
63;I read the book when I was a freshman in High School and absolutely loved it!
64;I highly recommend it to people who are fans of other movies such as Bright Star.
65;it's a wonderful story for even the very young child.
66;As an avid reader and mother of five young readers, I was so excited when this movie first opened.
67;I was pleasantly surprised at how well made, well acted, and entertaining the movie proved to be.
68;The scenery was beautiful, the screenplay closely followed the book with a few exceptions, but not enough to 'ruin' it, as many screen adaptations do.
69;The story was wonderful, it made me laugh and cry.
70;It was lovely in all aspects.
71;It is a light and happy tale.
72;As a teacher, I completed a novel unit on Tuck Everlasting with my fifth grade class.
73;I will definitely do again in the future!
74;This is one of Disney best films.
75;Amazon prime delivers movies at a low cost and im able to watch it anywhere.
76;I enjoyed this lovely movie so much.
77;I ordered it for my ROKU player.
78;The best part of viewing the movie was that there were no interruptions from start to finish.
79;I was very pleased with the movie.
80;It is the best movie I've ever seen.
81;I'm going to see it again this friday!best movie ever!
82;Great movie to let your imagination take you away to what if?
83;The cast is big, as is the story.
84;The real problem is I see Bledal's character like her character on Gilmore Girls.
85;While it at times is dark, I enjoyed the overall story.
86;I found the teenage love suitable for all ages.
87;It was well acted by namely Alexis Bledel and Jonathan Jackson.
88;i hadent seen this movie in like over 8 years i almost cryied because i remeber how much i loved it
89;The film is almost 100 percent faithful to the book, capturing the enchanting style of Natalie Babbit's novel.
90;Alex Bledel shows great acting talent as young, confined Winnie and an excellent supporting cast rounds out the movie.
91;Do yourself a favor and go see this film right now.
92;We took the entire family to our local multiplex to see this movie yesterday, two days after its arrival in theaters.
93;We all loved the film .
94;She was perfectly cast in this role.
95;"Ben Kingsley played the ""man in the yellow suit"" flawlessly ."
96;Jonathan Jackson was wonderfully intense, handsome and likeable.
97;the photography was breathtaking, the score haunting, the story thought provoking.
98;i would highly recommend this film.
99;Great family movie to watch together!
100;Loves sissy spasek she was great.
101;This is such a simple and kind of slow movie, but I simply love it!
102;If you are a fan of the book, do yourself a big favor and forget this movie.
103;Niceto be able to give it to her to take home for a sleepover.
104;All her friends liked it as well.
105;My 7th grade students read this book in class, and I ordered this move for them to watch.
106;The movie is great, and the extra bits at the end are entertaining.
107;That set the tone in my head for Tuck Everlasting, but I was soon to be swept into one of the most poignant tales of love, choices and consequence I'd read in my young life.
108;read it with fondness several times in my teenage years, always finding something new to delight me, captivate me, or even torment me.
109;When the film came out in the last decade, the Tens, I couldn't wait to see it and was glad to find it was every bit as lovely and meaningful as I'd hoped it would be.
110;ray Tuck Everlasting is more beautiful than ever and every bit as good as it was nearly ten years ago.
111;"Alexis Bledel is wonderful here in what I think is the performance of her career, and a strong supporting cast which includes William Hurt, Sissy Spacek and Ben Kingsley really adds power to Natalie Babbitt's masterful story of ""what if?"""
112;This is just a great movie from beginning to end.
113;The Twilight crowd ought to really love it!
114;Great for all ages to see as well.
115;"I am pleased at just how surprised I was
I:371;116;Although they changed the plot some, they gracefully captured the essence of the book .
I:371;117;I also loved the cinematography of the film, and thought it artistic and excellent.
I:371;118;In reality, a truly creative person really might have done something amazing with immortality.
I:371;119;I've owned this movie now for over two years and have enjoyed watching it several times.
I:371;120;The story is mostly laid back and peaceful but tells a powerful story and on occasion gets somewhat heavy.
I:371;121;From my perspective that was an act of grace and mercy.
I:371;122;A future is now available which includes both spiritual life and eternal life for all who accept God's solution"
123;"Winnie is finally faced with the necessity of making a decision as to which way she should go
I:371;124;the movie has a charming ambiance and is well acted, Alexis Bledel portrays Winnie with charm and innocence, Ben Kingsley does a good job as the unnamed """"man in the yellow suit,"""" William Hurt as Angus, Sissy Spacek as Mae, Jonathan Jackson as Jesse, and Scott Bairstow as Miles are all effective in their roles."""
125;The supporting roles are also convincingly played.
126;i can recommend this movie for all who love a good story.
127;time collector of lush, beautiful soundtracks and scores of motion pictures.
128;this particular score is outstanding!
129;the entire score is as good.
130;I love all the sweet scenes between Jessie and Winnie in this movie.
131;I love clean love story movies.
132;I just wish that it had a happy ending.
133;I just adore happy endings.
134;It's a great movie and I love it!
135;Everyones dream to have a fountain of youth in the back woods .
136;A pleasant fantasy with lovely scenery, we bought this as a gift for friends who are building a home near the location where it was filmed.
137;It is a very good movie, kind of a fantasy romance, and suitable for the whole family.
138;It arrived in excellent condition and in a prompt manner.
139;Reading the novel prior to viewing the movie can provide more detailed character understanding and foundation for a comparison debate.
140;The whole family watched iit together ( my daughter and hubby, with their two kids live with me) The movie even kept the attention of our 4.
141;Tuck Everlasting is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.
142;Alexis Bledel was both inspiring and graceful as Winnie.
143;The movie was enchanting and captivating.
144;(Like the Princess Diaries) Anyways, I still think that this movie is moving and beautiful.
145;It has a beautiful love story as well.
146;It is a movie that will allow you to take your own perspective in life, and you will still be thinking about it when you leave the theater and maybe even when you reach home.
147;I highly reccomend this movie to all who love romantic and thought.
148;Would highly recommend this movie for the family.
149;tale execution of it is very compelling, very beautiful.
150;If this movie doesn't entirely explore that, then it does a good job trying.
151;jesse's brother (Scott Bairstow) brings Winnie back to their cabin, and soon Winnie becomes intrigued by their simple, carefree life.
152;thanks to the little spring under the tree, they are also immortal and unaging.
153;one of the most gorgeous things about this film is the scenery .
154;the camerawork perfectly sets off the almost unreally beautiful forests and lakes.
155;Dialogue is fairly good, although occasionally it sounds a bit too modern to be plausibly pre.
156;That moment crystallizes the entire message of the movie, and Scott Bairstow is outstanding in it.
157;bledel is quite good as Winnie, and manages to convey very well the frustration of a smart girl who just wants to live a normal life.
158;Jackson is also good, flipping between the poignant and happier moments.
159;"While ""Tuck Everlasting"" isn't the deepest it could be, it's still outstandingly executed and well."
160;It is a supernatural love story that stresses family values and unrequited love.
161;The story connects to persons of any age, making it wonderful joint viewing for both a child and adult.
162;It's a movie you will share over and over.
163;A family of settlers discover a spring which grants them immortality.
164;It's a lovely fairytale and I would recommend it to everyone!
165;This beautifully shot Disney movie is a sensitive and well made version of the much loved children's novel of the same name by Natalie Babbit .
166;the movie is shot through with both melancholy and humour .
167;it is well made although sentimentality is not always kept at bay.
168;foster and Jackson give strong performances and there is a good Ben Kingsley cameo .
169;this is a minor blemish on what is an affectionate and sensitive piece of work , is suitable for a family audience
170;This a real love story where he wants her but he knows what will happen if he does marry her and he doesn't want what happened to him to happen to her,live forever.
171;Quote from a great show I love that has meaning,,Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequet,Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure,We ask ourselves who am I to be brilliant,gorgeous,talented,and valiant,actually who are you not to be?
172;line takes the viewers out of our ordinary world and succeeds in truly entertaining us, which is really enjoyable.
173;There are elements of: a) a love story, b) real.
174;heartedly recommend this to every viewer.
175;The story by Natalie Babbitt is wonderfully written and intriguing.
176;Disney took off on the teenage love story bit, but it's still a very entertaining movie.
177;My strong suggestion is to read the book first .
178;TUCK EVERLASTING is simply a 'feel good' movie.
179;affirming, sentimental, finding the borders of credibility and celebrating them, and directed and acted with the sense of commitment that Jay Russell and his fine cast provided .
180;The Tuck family happened upon a spring in a woods in the past, drank from the spring and voila!
181;the inevitable capture of the Tucks and the way they resolve their immortal inaccessibility with Jesse's and Winnie's new found need for each other .
182;serves as the ending and it is resolved well.
183;the settings and acting and physical beauty of this film are matched by the understated but important moments of philosophy about what is the meaning of the cycle of life as we know it rather than as we think we would reshape it.
184;Tuck Everlasting is a wonderful book, with a sweet and basic tone.
185;Reviewers that liked the 1981 TV movie are correct: it's better, because it sticks to the story, even with subtle changes.
186;The characters are fully developed.
187;if you're a teenage girl, enjoy the new Disney 2002 version of Tuck Everlasting.
188;great story and a great sound track.
189;"Einstein's theory of Relativity set alive imaginative story lines based on earth as well as in space, from vampires that live forever, to the very old TV series of unexplainable experiences in the ""Twilight Zone"", to story lines in outer space."
190;The film is well acted and photographed with good drama as well.
191;This is literally my favorite movie in all the land.
192;it is the sweetest and most tragic love story that is beautifully portrayed throughout the story.
193;The soundtrack and cinematography were executed perfectly.
194;they made a few changes but i good movie
195;Its the best way I can characterize the feeling I get watching it.
196;the movie is not overly ambitious but within the world it creates wholly believable.
197;Great imaginative story,great filming,good acting,actors that were type cast great for the roles that they played,you really can't lose watching this film,and who really knows,it just might take 10 years off your age watching it,good luck
198;The emotion, both Jesse's and Winnie's love and Miles' grief, were infinitely more genuine than most emotion I've seen in movies.
199;I am fascinated by both immortality and romance, and I found Tuck Everlasting to be perhaps the best combination of the two that I've ever seen.
200;While so many romance movies focus on sex, this movie's romance was a form of pure love that is a real treat.
201;I hope my kids enjoy this movie as much as I did when I was young.
202;Thoroughly enjoyed by my 6th Grade Language Arts class.
203;Norman Rockwell was a painter who knew, first hand, of the evils of the real world.
204;They would have crushed her soul to meet there idea of the perfect daughter,but this is Disney, thank God.
205;In Disney's world we know that mom and dad will come around, that there daughter will find herself and be happy, that they all will be.
206;The young actress who plays Whiney is just perfect, she does not act so much as stand there and shimmer like some sort of living jewel, she is simply perfect.
207;the book was in good condition.
208;Tuck Everlasting is a wonderfully bittersweet family film.
209;with a few exceptions, Disney's Tuck Everlasting is true to Natalie Babbitt's classic book.
210;(A couple of scenes are added to the film for dramatic effect and to build character development.
211;Bledel plays the part of Winnie Foster perfectly.
212;She captures the innocence of youth and the nervousness associated with a first love to a T.
213;She is the perfect actress for the part and Disney hit the nail on the head in casting her.
214;Nevermind that this is her first film, as Bledel's experience from the Gilmore Girls has surely paid off and is demonstrated many times throughout the movie.
215;He's an adventurous young man who likes to travel, but his life is forever changed when he meets young Winnie.
216;the remaining cast members also capture their characters' personalities and emotions beautifully.
217;"Kingsley, talented as ever, plays a great villain while Hurt and Spacek are the perfect ""neighborly"" folks that everyone wishes they lived next to."
218;the music by William Ross enhances each scene with its own, unique melody.
219;It's a nice change from the all.
220;"This is undoubtedly a Disney classic, sure to find its way among other such films as ""Old Yeller"" and ""The Swiss Family Robinson""."
221;Disney has outdone itself with a modern classic that you can feel comfortable taking the whole family to see.
222;A usual romantic movie (young love and choices) that has an ending with a twist.
223;My students loved the book and they loved the movie.
224;There are quite a lot of differences between the two which will generate lots of discussion.
225;(I have been told that there was much less a love interest between the teenagers in the book, however this emendation certainly lends a magical spark to the timeless story.)
226;Upon seeing the movie, I can recommend it not only for its excellent treatment of this subject, but also as a film the whole family can enjoy and discuss afterward.
227;a tree that will lend a poignant and touching climax to the end of the film.
228;suffice it to say, the acting is wonderful.
229;"Victor Garber (Alias
I:371;230;She is convincing and superb in her effort to balance her desire for love in a life outside of time, with her responsibility to live the life intended for her.
I:371;231;The talent of the cast, as well as the curiosity of the storyline makes for few dull moments, and the conclusion left me with one wet Kleenex!This is a beautiful film.
I:371;232;from the scenery, to the music, to the performances, to the plot.
I:371;233;Best movie ever i could watch it all day and keep pushing repeat.
I:371;234;Im so glad i finally found it.
I:371;235;LOVED the book and the movie is just as great!!
I:371;236;The acting is good and the unfolding of the movie is captivating from the beginning.
I:371;237;Truly enjoyed this movie and I hope to watch it with my granddaughter when she's a bit older.
I:371;238;It was an insightful film.
I:371;239;I viewed the original and the comments from the original.
I:371;240;The whole premise of the film I found fascinating.
I:371;241;Tuck Everlasting is a wonderful Disney film that is sure to capture the attention of everyone in your family.
I:371;242;Alexis Bledel and Jonathan Jackson are a precious pair, bringing enormous talent to the film.
I:371;243;This character is as unique and captivating, as if seeing this actress for the first time.
I:371;244;But Alexis is not the only talent, every actor in this film does a remarkable job, bringing their characters to life and making one believe the part was created just for them.
I:371;245;Removing the possibility of death, takes away the possibility of life.
I:371;246;to truly understand, you'll have to watch the film .
I:371;247;The movie is done very well with top notch actors.
I:371;248;I think everyone would love this movie.
I:371;249;My husband and I were luke warm about watching this, but were pleasantly surprised.
I:371;250;Not syrupy at all, well acted and great story.
I:371;251;I Remember watching this movie in 4th grade and I fell in love with it and I'm so happy that I have it again :.)
I:371;252;I really enjoyed the characters in this movie.
I:371;253;Excellent choice of actors andactresses.
I:371;254;My grandson had to read the book for class, and I helped himby getting the movie.
I:371;255;This is a film with mystery throughout.
I:371;256;Slowly the mysteries are revealed and choices must be made which will influence each of the character's lives.
I:371;257;The acting is convincing, particularlythe romantic leads Alexis Bledel, the beautiful daughter of a wealthy man"
258;It does, however, pose some interesting philosophical questions and goes deeper than most Hollywood products.
259;I read the book as a teen in the 70's and really enjoyed it.
260;Regardless, it is a timeless tale for all ages.
261;They looked so much alike that they seemed like brother and sister as opposed to passionate teens.
262;william Hurt who played the father is one of my favorite actors.
263;i enjoyed the movie but whoever cast Jesse should not have cast a guy who looked like Winnie's brother to play her love interest.
264;If you have kids or grand kids this would be a good movie to watch with them.
265;This was a sweet movie that would be good for the whole family.
266;The characters were real, actors fantastic and the plot was very intriguing.
267;I found this movie to be very one.
268;When it comes down to it, this movie was very amusing.
269;Very good, would recomend, even if you read the book.
270;In the book this made him a rather somber character, and a sympathetic one, but it was mostly because he feels rather.
271;and even some of the romantic moments added were not bad, but I do feel as if this movie suffers purely because I so loved the book.
272;I enjoyed it, but it could have been better, had they stuck more to the original material.
273;Tuck Everlasting is a good film for preteens and teenagers.
274;I would love it if they show more scenes between Jackson and Bledel.
275;Their love story is packed in this 20 minute scene and that (.)
276;The performances of the actors in the film are solid.
277;Bledel and Jackson have a great chemistry .
278;It came promptly and was in excellent condition, My students liked comparing it to the book,
279;I enjoyed the book so much, that when i saw a teaser poster for this movie, i was overjoyed!
280;If you are looking for something to just while away an hour or two, you have found it.
281;The story and acting were great, but the reason I gave it 5 stars instead of 4 is that the point it so poignantly makes is excellent.
282;Watch this and Benjamin Button right afterwards, and we may never complain about getting old again!
283;I am 31 and enjoyed this film, but I would have loved it when I was 13.
284;This is a great movie for females of all ages, but would probably especially touch 11.14 year old girls.
285;Great romance story (with only hand.
286;holding and a sweet kiss)2.
287;top acting or characters (I hate when they throw in that zany character in so many films for 'comic relief'!)
288;Beautiful film to watch, great landscapes, very crisp, bright, and green with nature4.
289;Great looking actors, especially the guy in the romantic lead.
290;Of course, like a lot of movies for novels, there were some differences, but overall a great movie!
291;While at my friend's house we watched it and I must say I was praticulary impressed.
292;There she meets a young boy Jesse Tuck drinking from a spring.
293;Wanting a drink herself, Jesse stops her and the mystery of the Tuck family is unravled as Winnie is brought to the Tuck's home and told their secret.
294;They are blessed and cursed with immortality.
295;i really liked how the movie discusses issues of death and life.
296;And their family is somewhere stuck in the middle.
297;There is also the romance between Winnie and Jesse that is prevelant in the movie.
298;All in all it is a movie worth your time.
299;The novel by Natalie Babbitt touched my life at a young age, so when they made a movie based on it, I wanted to see the story come to life.
300;I must say they captured it well.
301;Great family movie, and one that actually provokes thought .
302;The main character in the novel, however is 10 and Alexis is a young teen in the movie.
303;i would recommend it as it provokes thought about eternal life on earth.
304;She is faced with this choice after meeting with the Tucks, a family that unwittingly became immortal after a drink from a very special spring.
305;i was pleasantly surprised at how good the movie was.
306;I really enjoyed the musical score as well.
307;the acting was quite good, with performances by Sissy Spacek, William Hurt, and Alexis Bledel, among others.
308;In good time she learns the family secret: a century ago the Tucks discovered a small spring in the woods.
309;They drank from the sweet waters and found out that they no longer aged and had become invulnerable.
310;It is Angus Tuck who makes the most important points to young Winnie.
311;"Angus knows that people will do just about anything not to die, but finds it more important that ""they'll do anythng to keep from living their life."""
312;Tuck Everlasting is sweetly romantic.
313;The kissing is fairly chaste and the most romantic moment has the winsome Bledel as the young Winnie dancing by firelight.
314;Still, the innocent romance seems in keeping with the rest of the story.
315;This special viewing mode allows kids to switch from the film to special segments that explore the themes and issues of the movie with actor Jonathan Jackson, other cast members, and some regular kids.
316;Disney scores another home run with this delightful film, lovingly adapted from the popular children's book of the same name by Natalie Babbit.
317;The changes actually serve it well, and Disney has done a masterful job in creating another beautiful family film.
318;the film takes place in the early twentieth century, just when cars are coming into use.
319;Winnie helps them to keep their secret, leaving her to make a life defining decision.
320;director Jay Carroll has directed a film that is simply wonderful, both magical and philosophical.
321;He has a first class cast that conveys the story in a way of which the author of the book may be proud.
322;The performances are simply stellar.
323;"Alexis Bledel is delightful as Winnifred ""Winnie"" Foster, reminding me of a very young Winona Ryder."
324;Jonathan Jackson is terrific as the boyish, good looking Jesse, and has, undoubtedly, acquired a following of young girls, as a result of this film.
325;William Hurt gives a thoughtful performance as the patriarch of the star.
326;Scott Bairstow's performance is a little on the strident side, but effective, nonetheless.
327;Ben Kingsley is suitably sinister as the man in the yellow suit who threatens to take the secret of the Tuck family up a disastrous path.
328;this is a heartwarming and tender film with a lovely and haunting musical score.
329;"It is a film that will simply delight viewers, It is rated ""PG"", but its innocence serves to underscore some of its philosophically potent, underlying themes."
330;The film provides much food for thought and has a depth that is surprising.
331;It is a film that is worthy of being in one's personal collection.
332;I read the book by Natalie Babbitt and loved it, but was wary about watching the movie.
333;It has the feel and plot of the book, which I was pleased to see.
334;The main change was Winnie and Jesse's romance.
335;I think the two best scenes were the one where she and Tuck are rowing in a boat on the pond and the one with her and Jesse in the water.
336;The story is very simply and beautifully told and the music is lovely.
337;Would it be worth it?
338;It was funny at times, and heartrending at others.
339;A simple, beautiful, powerful film.
340;I know this movie is quite good, cause I saw it on TV a couple of years ago.
341;I Truly enjoyed this movie Very much, so when I saw it for sale on amazon, I jumped at the chance to get it.
342;This is an excellent movie, romantic and amazing story about the Tuck family and how they found the fountain of youth!
343;Good acting and a thought provoking story.
344;Bear with me for just a moment, because I'm going to talk about another movie that has a great deal of relevance to this movie.
345;Tuck Everlasting is a family movie, and the central aspect of the movie is the love between Jessie Tuck and Winnie Foster.
346;In both movies the man is immortal, regardless of the source of that immortality, and the woman either suffers from the man's immortality, as in the case of Heather MacLeod, or she chooses to live the life she was given to the fullest.
347;When Winnie meets the Tuck family, she finds a freedom she did not know existed.
348;free life is always tempting, regardless of time and society.
349;Tuck Everlasting thoroughly sets up the comparison between the Tuck's life of freedom and the rule.
350;of course, in all movies where there is a love story and a choice must be made between alternatives, one of which is the love the characters have for each other, we know that somewhere someone must give up something.
351;this movie is very suitable for family members of all ages.
352;"This movie is a pleasant fantasy with a wonderful bittersweet ending in the tradition of movies like ""Old Yeller""."
353;I like the details of the ending better than the book.
354;Being an extremely discriminate movie goer, I can sincerely acclaim this to be one of the most captivating, thought provokig, heart touching movie I have seen in a long time.
355;As far as I am concerned the actors played their parts superbly.
356;"The story was absolutely fascinating, having now seen something that led one to the ""fountain of youth."""
357;Though it was heart rending at the conclusion, which made it very emotional, I was intrigued the entire time.
358;Disney did a great job.
359;delightful book made into a beautiful movie.
360;perfect gift for every grandchild and if you are lucky, they will invite granma and granpa sit watch with them.
361;I was entertaining and age appropriate.
362;I haven't seen the entire movie yet but it looks amazing.
363;it was so sad and very good.
364;it had a very good plot and it stood tall to the story line.
365;i recommend this book to everyone who likes teen romances.
366;Really enjoyed this movie my son read the book in school and wanted to see the movie.
367;It is a meticulous production, filled with beautiful cinematography and lovely sets.
368;While it does not quite capture the magic of the novel [perhaps no film could], it does capture the book's main message.
369;Overall, this is fine family entertainment.
370;the story takes place in a small American town around 1915.
371;He knows their secret and will do anything to find them.
372;the main focus of the movie is on Bledel and Jackson, who do a fine job, especially considering that the cast includes much more experienced acting heavyweights at Kingsley, Sissy Spacek and William Hurt.
373;Tuck Everlasting doesn't rank as a classic family movie, but it is lovely to look at and quite entertaining.
374;This story doesn't have a whole lot to it, but the movie was wonderfully done.
375;Acting is amazing, I enjoyed the music too.
376;Yes, it was definitely not Oscar worthy, but still it was a light, bubbly, family film.
377;Great movie, and my daughter was 'upset' at the ending, which just means she really got into the movie and characters
378;They did a great job with the service.
379;Finally, I love the plot and the fact that we can see this girl becoming a woman and how she goes through it, asking herself the biggest question of all times: Would I like to live forever?Moreover, the end is one of the most enjoyable parts of the movie with Jesse coming back to the woods, I could feel his relief because she had the life he could never have.
380;"on balance, this is what I call ""Real Fantasy""."
381;A fantasy that looks real because we can actually ask ourselves if we would do the same as the main character.
382;Any of the main themes of the plot can happen to us: growing up, making important decisions, changing our mind, finding new friends with secrets and falling in love with an unreachable and everlasting dream.
383;Movie is in good condition.
384;Perfect, my daughter and her class loved watching the movie.
385;And she loved being able to watch it on family night
386;"It's a real ""family"" film as opposed to the empty fare most movies of the same nature are."
387;"It can be slightly macabre, gently philosophical, and ponderous
I:371;388;The rest of the film is much the same.
I:371;389;It moves at an unusual speed for films these days, it just strolls along lovingly and thoughtfully, with some tense moments here and there, until the last 30 minutes or so, where everything falls into place with help from those exciting escapades.
I:371;390;It's smart, and it works, and the result is beautiful, if not bittersweet and heartbreaking.
I:371;391;Other than the absolutely stunning cinematography AND gorgeous, haunting score AND the great costumes AND production design (these last two aspects help the feel of the film greatly, in a film that relies on """"feel"""" and that tangibility a great deal), the beauty of the film lies in it's sincerety and its simplicity, it's message and it's moral, and it's hefty handful of purely breathtaking and wonderful moments."""
392;and what I though was a truly beautiful ending.
393;Just to see them in the background and to know they are there helps create a mood and atmosphere about their home and the Tucks' personalities .
394;The rest of the cast, Garber, Irving, and Bairstow, are fairly capable, with Irving leading the pack.
395;this is a wonderful film.
396;"Quite brave considering all the flash and dash and raucousness of most films for the ""teen/kid"" age group these days."
397;See it to bring your kids to a wholesome, mature.
398;It gives room to think and to daze in a bucolic setting with a wonderful passionate story about life.
399;She loves him too, but he can not die.
400;If she does, she will live forever with the one she loves, but if she doen't, she will finish the wheel of life.
401;Faced with the most romantic fantasy a girl could dream of, she must decide whether or not to give it up, or live it . . . forever.
402;This movie is magical and romantic.
403;Anyone who loves romance will absolutly love this movie rich with fantasy.
404;This is a wonderful story.
405;THe production, casting, everything about this is absolutely perfect.
406;A good family film, teaching an important value, I highly recommend this film.
407;perfect) movie adaptation of Natalie Babbitt's classic novel about a young girl who meets a family immortals.
408;"If you are looking for a nice family movie or love story, Disney's ""Tuck Everlasting"" is a fine selection for your viewing pleasure."
409;The story, very carefree but at times a little deep and occasionally dark, provides good discussion fodder on issues such as life and changing society values.
410;overall, the movie contains all the great things you could look for in both a love story and a family movie.
411;The movie overall is very light and easy and should be enjoyable for anyone.
412;I myself read Babbitt's book in elementary and though it's been 16 years I still remember the book quite well.
413;As far as I can tell, this movie was about as true an adaptation as you can get.
414;The main themes and event sequences are translated well onto the big screen.
415;Fans of the book should appreciate this movie.
416;"This is a very powerful scene that touches very well on the ""eternal life"" issue."
417;This scene could easily win an award.2.
418;Jesse and Winnie's adventuresTHE VERDICT:Overall, this movie is a great choice for young couples on a date or family's looking for a nice, clean movie.
419;Yes indeed my friends, it's a chick flick!!!
420;The movie is a marketable rendition of the book because it builds in romance since Winnie is a teenager and not ten years old.
421;It builds suspense since there are so many people sent out to look for Winnie.
422;as an avid book lover, I wanted to see how the movie kept to the theme of the book.
423;i enjoyed the movie, but if you are looking for the feelings that the book evokes, you will not find them here.
424;I have loved this book for years.
425;The movie stays very true to the story.
426;line of the book and handles it in a fun and whimsical manner.
427;Very glad we ordered it for our trip!
428;The kids loved it and it worked perfectly to occupy them for the long trip!
429;"Nicely filmed and intelligently conceived (based on Natalie Babbitt's novel), Disney's ""Tuck Everlasting"" works on enough levels to make it an entertaining film for the whole family."
430;The classic Disney feel is there, with sweet emotions, pleasant vistas, and good.
431;"natured simple characters
I:371;432;She is introduced to the Tuck family and their secret, along with an entirely new way of living.
I:371;433;The Tucks take their time with life, appreciating everything around them.
I:371;434;coming from a wealthy and very proper family, Winnie finds the Tuck lifestyle very refreshing and stays with the Tucks rather than returning home.
I:371;435;suspense is introduced by a mysterious man in a yellow suit (Ben Kingsley) who is getting increasingly close to learning the Tuck's secret.
I:371;436;Romance is introduced by the growing love between Winnie and Jesse.
I:371;437;Although Jesse looks 17, he is actually 107.
I:371;438;the """"Tuck Everlasting"""" novel is an expressionistic story and the Tuck family themselves a surreal device much like the repeating day in """"Groundhog Day""""."""
439;to best appreciate this story it is important to remember that it is about Winnie's life and not about the Tucks.
440;Very nice film of the classic book!
441;Great book and great service from Amazon.
442;She loved the movie and wanted to have it to watch whenever.
443;How much harder (and better) to put a pleasant face on it and let the actions speak for themselves.
444;The movie brought out great qualities and is a joy to watch.
445;The story of Winnie Foster leaves you enjoying life.
446;The ending leaves you thinking and wanting more.
447;The movie is great for families and first dates.
448;"Great movie
I:371;449;thank you and Happy New Year :)
I:371;450;I streamed it to introduce it to my 15 year old.
I:371;451;A classic in my book!
I:371;452;I have watched this movie over and over, which may seem silly, but it always leaves me with a head full of things to ponder and good feelings inside all at the same time!
I:371;453;I loved this movie so much.
I:371;454;But this movie is definetly as good, or even better then the book.
I:371;455;This movie is about a girl named Winnie who is fed up with life at home, and goes exploring in the woods.
I:371;456;There is an amazing scene that almost made me cry, when Winnie is being taken away from Jesse.
I:371;457;If you want to know what happens next, see the movie!!!
I:371;458;All in all,this was a great movie and you should get it!!!
I:371;459;If you have read the book then you will want to watch this movie.
I:371;460;If you ever get a chance to watch the original film (only available on VHS according to IMDB), and read the original novel you will find a much better story.
I:371;461;The original 1981 film is much much more closer to the novel.
I:371;462;old daughter, who I thought would enjoy it with me, went off and found a book to read.
I:371;463;I added a half star to the film for this.
I:371;464;Now our heroine discovers them.
I:371;465;The actors are all fine, the characters are interesting, the scenery is beautiful, the premise is fascinating, but the plot just kind of meanders and never finds its way.
I:371;466;There are good bits and pieces here and there but not a whole.
I:371;467;The best part of the film is when Miles, the older Tuck brother, who is a perpetual twenty, tells our heroine the downside to immortality.
I:371;468;Heartwrenching scene here, very good.
I:371;469;Beside this scene and a bit more on getting into the dark side of living forever I liked the ending.
I:371;470;It was a bit uplifting as you might expect from a Disney film.
I:371;471;As I said, it has its moments.
I:371;472;Just don't expect the youngsters to enjoy it with you.
I:371;473;my girlfriend likes it and my dogs were delighted.
I:371;474;It is really thought provoking.
I:371;475;This is a magical mystery movie, and is also thought.
I:371;476;Entertaining adaptation of the book by the same name.
I:371;477;Watched with 11 and 8 yr olds who enjoyed it very much also.
I:371;478;hollywood cast, Lieber and Hart's braindead screenplay renders this, at best, an ineffective shadow of Natalie Babbitt's classic young adult novel.
I:371;479;Because, you see, the Tucks are immortal, thanks to that very spring.
I:371;480;disney being Disney, the romance between Winnie and Jesse and the action scenes featuring the Man in the Yellow Suit (I wish he'd finally get a name somewhere, to make reviews easier to write) are brought to the forefront, and the more cerebral portions of the novel.
I:371;481;I have loved this book since childhood, was excited to see it as a movie and NOW we own one so it can be watched over and over again, especially when the Grands are here .
I:371;482;Eternal forces that seduce with life and death rewards have always been a staple of film stories.
I:371;483;tUCK EVERLASTING is beautiful to look at and has already been hailed as a classic, although not a box office success.
I:371;484;The fine cast includes Sissy Spacek, William Hurt and Ben Kingsley.
I:371;485;A teen romance plot, not in the book, finesses the idea that life is a magical gift and every moment counts.
I:371;486;Not one of the greats, but a wonderful cast.
I:371;487;A really neat romance story, a chick flick.
I:371;488;a surprise ending, but very fitting for the story line.
I:371;489;this movie had heart and an undying soul.
I:371;490;a classic for years to come
I:371;491;Product arrived in excellent condition.
I:371;492;tuck EverlastingThank you for good service.
I:371;493;It is required reading in their class and so we take 30 minutes everyday to read a chapter.
I:371;494;It was a great movie and was true to the book.
I:371;495;It was sad, but a beautiful story.
I:371;496;At the end they will see the movie again with their classmates.
I:371;497;I want them to walk away with a great experience about what life was than and what life is like now (compare/contrast).
I:371;498;Of course to also think if they had the chance to live forever would they drink the water or would they make the choice to let their life take the course of growing old.
I:371;499;A good, clean, fun movie the whole family can enjoy together.
I:371;500;Immortality is always an interesting thing to ponder.
I:371;501;I thought all of the actors were very well cast.
I:371;502;In this film you see how many sides of the gift there are to consider.
I:371;503;there's a magic to this movie and it's wonderful for young and old, even those who don't enjoy romance.
I:371;504;The director chats a bit much, talking more about the book and how they got into character and not the secrets and interesting facts about the film like in other movies I've seen.
I:371;505;I've found I enjoy the movie more than the book, no offense to Ms. Babbitt, of course, but the cast does such a good job portraying and BEING the characters that I love it!
I:371;506;I haven't read the book yet, but this movie is really sweet.
I:371;507;The movie is about the Tuck family and their unique gift: they can not die.
I:371;508;The spring had magical powers and granted them an immortal life.
I:371;509;I won't spoil the ending, but overall I think this movie was well written and would be a great addition to any child or young adults collection.
I:371;510;Though I've never read the book I think I would've found it more enjoyable than the movie.
I:371;511;If one drink from the spring gives them life everlasting.
I:371;512;I took my 5th grade class on a literary journey through this book, and we decided to compare it to the film.
I:371;513;The book is definitely worth the read, though.
I:371;514;It's a bit more complex.
I:371;515;I read Tuck Everlasting every year with my 4th grade class, and after we've finished the book we watch the movie.
I:371;516;Although there are several distinct differences in the book and the movie, I love them both.
I:371;517;It was a good movie.
I:371;518;I have seen it before and really liked it.
I:371;519;If you enjoyed the book then you will not enjoy this movie.
I:371;520;i heard it was a good love story but i have sure seen a lot better.
I:371;521;I will show the movie at the end of the reading.
I:371;522;The movie goes along fairly well with the book.
I:371;523;I'm a 5th grade teacher and read the novel over the course of a month to my class.
I:371;524;Watching this movie with snacks was a great celebration for the end of the book.
I:371;525;It has a typical romantic plot, """"we're in love but we must sacrifice for a greater good."""""""
526;I loved the book and I really enjoyed the movie, but it was very predictable and rather too fluffy in spots.
527;A girl, Winnie, who is growing up as the only daughter of a well.
528;do, proper and very repressive family and who yearns for more out of life, crosses paths with the Tuck family's youngest son.
529;Ben Kingsley was a wonderful villain.
530;He created his characterization with brilliant use of voice and facial expression and was never overtly evil, yet dripped with greed and self.
531;Nice story, good actors, cinematography, set decoration, music.
532;This is one of her favorite movies and we hadn't been able to find it anywhere.
533;I ordered it when I saw you had it.
534;I have always been a huge fan of the book, and while this isn't perfectly in line with the book it is pretty darn close.
535;Alexis Bledel is best known for her role on Gilmore Girls but she does a great job here as do her costars.
536;This is a wonderful tale of life.
537;I encourage you to read the book first, before watching the movie but if you don't you will still enjoy it.
538;this movie is really great.
539;"Family films have to be able to hold the attention of both young children and grown adults
I:371;540;almost the entire movie takes place in the woods, and while there was some great cinematography, there were almost no scenery changes.
I:371;541;I read Tuck Everlasting when I was in sixth grade and enjoyed it a lot.
I:371;542;It was a pleasant surprise that the movie is just as pleasant.
I:371;543;It retains the feeling the book gives you.
I:371;544;Of course for the movie to sell more tickets they made it into a romance.
I:371;545;I think the choices of cast members was excellent, except Alexis Bledel.
I:371;546;Except for the romance they also stay very true to the story, which is refreshing.
I:371;547;This is a wonderful show.
I:371;548;My daughter loved it when it first come out and kept asking for it until I finally bought it for her a while ago.
I:371;549;TUCK EVERLASTING is most definitely a chick flick.
I:371;550;The acting is good, but not great.
I:371;551;It's not the typical chick flick and is a film that most members of the family can at least tolerate if not enjoy.
I:371;552;Even when this movie was not a big hit when it came out I think it does captures the spirit of the book and it is still a great way to tell everyone that life does not need to be extraordinary to be wonderful.
I:371;553;We received this video in a timely manner but when we went to play it, a message came up saying """"."""
554;I understand this is a great movie but I wouldn't know.
555;I found it so inexpensive on your site.
556;It came in good condition and I watched it right away.
557;I bought this movie for my child and me.
558;The idea of immortality is always an interesting one.
559;It is a fun movie to watch.
560;I had a great experience with amazon and the seller.
561;The book was really good so I thought I would give it a shot.
562;I absolutely loved this movie!
563;I was so thrilled to be able to watch this movie without worrying what my 9.
564;This movie was so well done and so well acted that I would give it 10 stars if it was possible.
565;I bought this video for my best friend's 12.
566;It was probably the funniest part of the movie.
567;i highly recommend this movie whether you are 12 or 112.
568;It is just so good!
569;While to movie strays a bit from the actual story line from time to time, our family felt like the movie did capture the gist of the characters, and certainly the scenery.
570;"Following the link to see the rest of his reviews, he has given ""Jackass"" a four."
571;"star rating and ""The Hot Chick"" five stars."
572;matter to be a little to slow for their taste!This is a wonderful movie.
573;This is a great movie, and can stand on its own.
574;Gave as a gift to a sweet girl who wanted this movie, I've never watched it but she was very happy with it.
575;Every time I thought about going to see the movie I cringed .
576;I hoped and prayed that they would keep the ending as it was in the book .
577;I have never felt happiness while tears were running down my face, until I went to see the movie.
578;alexis Bledel brought so much spirit to the character of Winnie, that I was taken aback.
579;She has certainly impressed me now.
580;his striking, innocent appearance accented the character of Jesse perfectly, and all of his mannerisms, long glances at the camera, and lively nature were euphoric to me.
581;i was enchanted and breathless by the images portrayed, and by the people represented.
582;After seeing this movie, I remember why my teacher made us read this book so many years ago .
583;So, if you're debating on if you should see this movie, please .
584;take my word for it, it's worth a look.
585;Take a chance, live your life, and see this movie.
