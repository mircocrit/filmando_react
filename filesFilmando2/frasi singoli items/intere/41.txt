I:9065;1;One of my top 10 pics.
I:9065;2;The actors were great, the script is excellent and directed beautiful.
I:9065;3;A real good crime story.
I:9065;4;This picture is totally mind boggling!
I:9065;5;"Five cool actors manipulated themselves into the ""film of the century"" to the world of Kaiser Soze."
I:9065;6;It is an ingenious plot which took control and influenced every character in many, many devious ways.
I:9065;7;The whole picture is full of grip, I was waiting to see what's next scene.
I:9065;8;kevin Spacey is incredible, the whole cast is incredible!!!
I:9065;9;Indeed my favorite film of all time.
I:9065;10;The plot is simply the best I have ever seen.
I:9065;11;The performance by Gabriel Byrne and Kevin Spacey is masterful.
I:9065;12;I own three copies of the same movie and I still feel the urge to see it again.
I:9065;13;definately it is money well spent.
I:9065;14;A unique, and somewhat nondescript cast performs beautifully, and the movie will stay with you for years.
I:9065;15;I enjoyed Kevin Spacey in this movie.
I:9065;16;He did a great job.
I:9065;17;Amazon provided an excellent stream.
I:9065;18;the Usual Suspects could have gotten by on the storyline itself, but the script is funny and well.
I:9065;19;written and the acting is terrific all around, especially by Spacey and Del Toro (both in award.
I:9065;20;The acting, storyline and twist are superb.
I:9065;21;It's a movie you can watch 20 times and still catch something new and be excited.
I:9065;22;the film itself becomes an entity, daring you to make preconceptions of any kind, daunting you with plot twists, strangling you with suspense, until the final card has been played and the only thought that comes into mind iswowIt is a film where nothing is as it seems, and trying to find what is real is like a dog chasing after its tail.
I:9065;23;As the story unfolds, the men have to serve the will of the diabolical Keyser Soze, and the power of the film grows until the end, when we realize that the Keyser (and Chris McQuarrie) have played us for fools.
I:9065;24;But more compelling is the acting.
I:9065;25;Gabriel Byrne is phlegmatic and charismatic as Keaton, a man wanting to change but tormented by the Establishment (Keyser) and by inner demons.
I:9065;26;Stephen Baldwin plays the macho McManus, and he is utterly convincing in the role.
I:9065;27;Benicio Del Toro, in one of his earlier performances, turns the rather insignificant role of Fenster into a captivating performance, he goes over the deep end, but it works perfectly.
I:9065;28;Pollak gives a fine performance and his natural comic timing adds some levity to the plot.
I:9065;29;Chazz Palmintieri plays his character with both sensitivity and toughness, and pulls it off brilliantly.
I:9065;30;this film is genius, pure and simple.
I:9065;31;Definitely one of the best movies of all time.
I:9065;32;once again, Kevin Spacey (Se7en, American Beauty) delivers a performance deserving of Academy Awards.
I:9065;33;This movie was great from begining to end.
I:9065;34;The whole cast in this movie does a fantastic job (especially Byrne and Spacey).
I:9065;35;This movie has the best ending that I've seen.
I:9065;36;This is the best ever film i have seen.
I:9065;37;Forget 'The Matrix', forget 'The Gladiator', this is a masterpiece in film making.
I:9065;38;The acting by all the suspects are amazing and kevin spacey plays his part with all inspiring class.
I:9065;39;The plot is full with detail, thrill and suspense and i dont think there is anything more you can ask from a film.
I:9065;40;The best film i have seen yet with no exaggeration.
I:9065;41;"I mean ""Pulp"" was so unique and original that I was so stunned when I first watched it."
I:9065;42;It was suspenseful and mysterious, the whole bit with Keyser Soze, it's gold!
I:9065;43;It's always fun to watch it with someone who hasn't seen it just to see their reaction.
I:9065;44;And of course, great performances on behalf of Kevin Spacey (who's career skyrocketed after his role as Verbal Kint) and Benicio Del Toro (whose talent was recognized after his useless role as Fenster where he basically took a guy who only had like two lines in the whole movie and actually was able to turn him into a character that people care about after watching it.
I:9065;45;As with most such films the truth (if I may be so presumptuous) is found between the two extremes.
I:9065;46;Dave is questioning Verbal to find out what happened.
I:9065;47;I don't think this flaw completely detracts from the strengths of The Usual Suspects, but it is certainly significant.
I:9065;48;the Usual Suspects does have quite a bit going for it: Riveting direction, interesting dialog, good acting, and a very clever (if often incomprehensible) plot.
I:9065;49;The screenplay and story have many of the same elements as Tarantino's Pulp Fiction.
I:9065;50;What makes Pulp Fiction a superior work is that Taranino never pretends to make the film more than what it is: A clever, unpredictable piece of storytelling, making the viewer feel surprised and satisfied.
I:9065;51;the Usual Suspects has been most accurately likened to a cinematic card trick: While you are watching it, the slight of hand is entertaining the first time you see it.
I:9065;52;The Usual Supects is worth seeing for it's considerable initial entertainment value, but once you find out the ending, what occurred before is no longer interesting (or relevant).
I:9065;53;As Fenster, Del Toro's abilities as one of the finest charcter actors of our time shine.
I:9065;54;His unusual delivery, impeccable timing, physical acting and expressive features allow him to give his character amazing depth.
I:9065;55;He creates layers for his characters and systematically peels them back.
I:9065;56;Del Toro has amazing charisma and steals all of his scenes.
I:9065;57;Both men are tremendous physical actors, defining their characters through their way of moving and speaking.
I:9065;58;The rest of the cast is also terrific, with the possible exception of Gabriel Byrne, whose performance seems strained at times.
I:9065;59;Stephen Baldwin is a real surprise.
I:9065;60;Both Palminteri and Postlethwaite give strong performances.
I:9065;61;Regardless of the ending, the movie is worth seeing if only for the acting.
I:9065;62;It is also stylishly directed and filmed with a smart and darkly humorous script.
I:9065;63;This is a thoroughly entertaining movie that will keep you guessing.
I:9065;64;Kevin Spacey is perfect in this movie, and Benicio Del Torro and Gabriel Bryne do well in it too.
I:9065;65;up movie plot that is found all to frequently in today's movie theaters, but the ending is what makes this movie a notable one.
I:9065;66;All great movies should have great endings, and this one does.
I:9065;67;The usual suspects is a great movie.
I:9065;68;It has great acting by Kevin Spacy, who plays the gymp.
I:9065;69;The sheer brilliance of it just pulled me in and right when I thought I had solved the mystery, the plot twisted again.
I:9065;70;I'm not saying everyone should share my opinion because he is my favorite actor, but to me his performance was absolutely flawless.
I:9065;71;this stands as a film noir classic.
I:9065;72;There are mind games galore.
I:9065;73;The Usual Suspects keeps you guessing.
I:9065;74;It's a delicious dish of red herrings.
I:9065;75;it is the best acted, best plot twister that I've watched in many a day.
I:9065;76;The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was making us believe he wasn't real.
I:9065;77;Amazing twist at the ending.
I:9065;78;It's one of those movies I watch when ever it's on TV
I:9065;79;Great movie with an unpredictable ending.
I:9065;80;Lots of suspense and action.
I:9065;81;Kevin Spacey and cast did an awesome job!
I:9065;82;I doubt I will ever see another film as well done as this one.
I:9065;83;It is brilliantly told with an incredibly unexpected conclusion.
I:9065;84;packed, this story unfolds twisting and turning until it takes you where you never thought you would go.
I:9065;85;This has to be in my top 20 favorite movies.
I:9065;86;I had to watch it multiple times to completely understand, and even now I can watch it and see something new!
I:9065;87;One of the best suspense movies.
I:9065;88;it has you on the edge of your seat from the beginning.
I:9065;89;SPOILER: Kevin Spacey is one of the best actors of my generation, IMHO, and his performance in this movie is no less than overwhelming.
I:9065;90;He masterfully pulls off a gimp role, only to be masking an evil mastermind.
I:9065;91;And the stories he yarns while under interrogation are very creative diversions from the ego maniac cop.
I:9065;92;The final scene where he walks away is the best part of the film.
I:9065;93;I forgot how intricate this movie was until watching again after a few years.
I:9065;94;I gave this movie three stars because it was entertaining and suspenseful, but it wasn't great.
I:9065;95;i liked The Italian Job much better.
I:9065;96;"The movie works not because of a borrowed ""whodunnit"" plot or ""twist"" ending but because of the fine scripting, direction and acting that came together to churn out a fantastic product."
I:9065;97;Watch this movie to see great performances and excellent direction.
I:9065;98;The plot will keep you interested and the subtleties of facial expressions the characters provide will lead you through the truths of the story just as they will allow you to realize where you are being lead astray.
I:9065;99;It is a fantastic movie and even those of you who just don't like this sort of film and perhaps enjoy something more simple yet well done and exciting, like Gladiator, I suggest you give this movie a try, you are guaranteed to like it.
I:9065;100;Great suspense but unconvincing twist !
I:9065;101;****Spoiler alert*****I was bit surprised reading lot of positive reviews after seeing the movie.
I:9065;102;It is as if the director played a trick on us and this makes suspense uncompelling.
I:9065;103;The movie is probably inspiration to 'twist ending' thrillers like 'Sixth sense' movie.
I:9065;104;After the suspense, we are compelled to look back the entire plot and it is still convincing.
I:9065;105;This makes sixth sense is so bold in storytelling that at the end we don't feel tricked or manipulated (although trick is played on us by Night).
I:9065;106;entire movie seems convincing and we rewind the movie to see again.
I:9065;107;the movie however has excellent screenplay.
I:9065;108;The music score by John Ottman is hypnotic and evokes emotion to the plot.
I:9065;109;Kevin spacey is powerful actor and he does great job as crippled passive criminal !
I:9065;110;This film is a perfect example of Great storytellingwhere the viewer is rewarded for following along,or can be chewed up and spit out for not paying attention.
I:9065;111;Many twists in this clever suspense thriller as told by one of the usual suspects from a recent police line up.
I:9065;112;Great acting and wonderful casting including the very talented Kevin Spacey, who alone makes this movie worth checking out.
I:9065;113;If you like trying to figure out what is really going on and who done it, you will enjoy this one.
I:9065;114;I count these rather faint strikes being marked against a fantastic film:1.
I:9065;115;I knew what was coming yeah, right!
I:9065;116;Definitely one of his best works.
I:9065;117;"The story is very well written also
I:9065;118;absolutely the most powerful movie that i have ever seen, not to mention the most entertaining.
I:9065;119;if this film was a woman, i'd marry it.
I:9065;120;If you haven't seen it, you should definitely check it out.
I:9065;121;well, they show a bunch of scenes from the movie, including a very critical, end.
I:9065;122;The five actors are great together and really make this movie's name ironic.
I:9065;123;Look out especially for Benicio del Toro in the criminal lineup, he's hilarious.
I:9065;124;The acting is good, the plot is fascinating.
I:9065;125;Some may find that unnerving, but it is very well written.
I:9065;126;I recomend this film for anyone who likes mysteries or crime stories.
I:9065;127;This is a very good movie with a surprise ending that I didn't see coming.
I:9065;128;I always like the movies Kevin Spacey does .
I:9065;129;Good job and a good deliverance as always that he does.
I:9065;130;I will say that `The Usual Suspects' is entertaining, because to say otherwise would be a bold faced lie.
I:9065;131;Spacey at least develops a character that is interesting, and even though he has delivered much stronger performances in other films he really carries the bulk of this film on his shoulders, and the moments that do work, work because of him.
I:9065;132;I love a good film noir, and films like `Chinatown', `The Griffters' and the recent `Brick' really understood the concept and delivered brilliantly.
I:9065;133;so a lot has been made about the `twist' that comes at the end of this film.
I:9065;134;Some absolutely love it and stake their everlasting devotion to this film on the last few moments alone.
I:9065;135;having the revelation come about that the entire film up till the last few moments was a complete faade, an exaggerated fabrication of actual events, was genius.
I:9065;136;I would probably still have nominated the screenplay since it was, for the most part, really well done, but I wouldn't have given it the Oscar.
I:9065;137;in the end I see `The Usual Suspects' as a decent thriller that entertains as best it can.
I:9065;138;this has got to be one of the best suspense movies I have ever seen.
I:9065;139;The plot is very involved and engaging, the actors are perfect in their roles, and it has one of Hollywood's greatest twist endings.
I:9065;140;thank You Everyone ,PS It is also excellent value
I:9065;141;A smart, violent, stylish film and an instant.
I:9065;142;see for action or whodunit lovers.
I:9065;143;Thought provoking and an excellent cast.
I:9065;144;Kevin Spacey and Gabriel Byrne give stellar performances.
I:9065;145;This will keep you guessing
I:9065;146;This film includes one of the finest actors of our generation, doing one of his best roles.
I:9065;147;Let it work it's magic.
I:9065;148;Kevin Spacey is fantastic, my new favourite actor, and the rest of the cast are also very good.
I:9065;149;Great direction and use of soundtrack .
I:9065;150;possibly the best film I have ever seen.
I:9065;151;The twist, building and build.
I:9065;152;up seem so carefree, casual, and simple.
I:9065;153;Still this is the movie that proves the writing and acting is what makes a movie great.
I:9065;154;really clever and shrewd film.
I:9065;155;Bryan Singer did a wonderful job here maybe because he was young and unknown.
I:9065;156;also smart movie, and then.
I:9065;157;well, it's Hollywood after all :) Sam Raimi, Peter Jackson and many others once also were making independent interesting cinema.
I:9065;158;"As I said ""The Usual Suspects"" is a smart and intelligent film and those like it are in deficit now."
I:9065;159;You will definately enjoy watching them play.
I:9065;160;Arrived in great condition and no damage to it at all.
I:9065;161;Legend and who done it mystery classic.
I:9065;162;A must see in the genre that is timeless.
I:9065;163;I still recommend this move decades later.
I:9065;164;This is one of my choice as one of the best movies ever.
I:9065;165;Having said that, I love this movie.
I:9065;166;Kevin Spacey may be the best actor going today.
I:9065;167;The Usual Suspects is one of the best and the music is really good too.
I:9065;168;I know that this is a review of this movie but one way I can describe how good it is is to put it along side of another that is way up there in the catagory of WHERE IN THE HECK IS THIS MOVIE GOING and that other movie that is comparable to The Usual Suspects is The Game.
I:9065;169;It was just a complete entertainer and the best suspense movie i have ever seen.
I:9065;170;A fast and fun loving tomp.
I:9065;171;Entertaining with a twist you may just not even know to watch for.
I:9065;172;Basically it starts with the end of the movie and works its way back in flashbacks as Kevin Spacey's character Verbal Kint, relays his story to the investigators.
I:9065;173;i can't provide more details without ruining the story, but it was masterful.
I:9065;174;Kevin Spacey's acting as Verbal Kint was wonderful.
I:9065;175;This movie has been one of my favorites since its release in the 90s.
I:9065;176;A great blend of actors, writers and production staff.
I:9065;177;It is a must see for Spacey fans.
I:9065;178;Unless someone has told you, the ending will surprise you.
I:9065;179;The Usual Suspects is my 2nd favorite movie which I own on video but can no longer play.
I:9065;180;This movie was very interesting and intriguing.
I:9065;181;the suspense keep me at the edge of my seat.
I:9065;182;he got an oscar for this movie.
I:9065;183;If any of you remember reading Lord Jim in your high school or college days, you'll remember that two.
I:9065;184;thirds of the story is told from Jim's point of view and, consequently, we never know what's true, what's truth.
I:9065;185;And that's what this movie is all about: What is truth?
I:9065;186;Gabriel Byrne has made a remarkable film because he's willing to play with the audience just as he plays with both time and characters in the film.
I:9065;187;And Kevin Spacey gives an outstanding performance as the slimy little con man and as the murderer playing the con man.
I:9065;188;I recommend this film to anyone who has a bit of imagination, a sense of humor (preferably off the wall), and a willingness to be confused in order to be unconfused at the conclusion.
I:9065;189;Great storyline, and a great twist.
I:9065;190;This has got to be one of the most amazing movies I have ever seen.
I:9065;191;I work at a video store and anytime the customer asks for suggestions, this is the first one that comes to mind.
I:9065;192;Every actor played their roles well.
I:9065;193;I was on the edge of my seat.
I:9065;194;Great for movie date night.
I:9065;195;My god, this movie is the most mindblowing, intense, and truly spellbinding movie i've ever seen.
I:9065;196;great cast, great script, and what can i say about the ending that hasnt been said.
I:9065;197;"So many quotable lines in this movie, from the ""devil's greatest trick"" to the ""hand me the keys you."""
I:9065;198;who were highschool friends and give a truly entertaining look at the movie that launched their careers.
I:9065;199;One of the best movies made.
I:9065;200;I would say this by far one of the best written screenplays around, along with amazing acting.
I:9065;201;This is one of the best movies of its type that I have ever seen.
I:9065;202;It is a modern classic in my opinion.
I:9065;203;notch cast, well written script, and wonderful directing give this movie a life of it's own.
I:9065;204;The deleted scenes are absolutley wonderful, and one wonders why they were deleted.
I:9065;205;The featurettes are a bit obscure, but still a lot of fun to watch.
I:9065;206;"Lie or Legend"" is great."
I:9065;207;The Gag Reel is fun, as all are mostly.
I:9065;208;Listening to Singer's commentary is absolutley fun.
I:9065;209;Trying to catch them all is hard, but lotsa fun.
I:9065;210;The story is a masterpiece and the acting is spectacular.
I:9065;211;The ending is the absolute best.
I:9065;212;Excellent piece of suspenseful story telling.
I:9065;213;great plot, co. worker recomended in passing.
I:9065;214;But what a helluva ride it is getting there!
I:9065;215;For that reason alone 5 stars, because this is an immensely entertaining and well crafted film.
I:9065;216;Arrvd on time and well pjd, A gift for my husband's 83rd bday.
I:9065;217;It works better without emphasizing them, just letting them linger in the background somewhere.
I:9065;218;performances: cool, slick, yet believable.
I:9065;219;Beautiful work, John!By the way, it's one of mine Top 3 movies of all time.
I:9065;220;The Usual Suspects is so well done, it is worth watching it twice in a row just to pick up all the subtleties in it.
I:9065;221;The acting, directing and plot in the film all flow together to make it one of my personal favorites.
I:9065;222;This was my first LB viewing of the film, and every shot that you rememeber as striking from the VHS edition is doubly so in letterbox.
I:9065;223;Not alot for special features, but the commentray with Singer and (insert screenwriter name here) is informative and funny in every way.
I:9065;224;This movie has perhaps the best surpise ending that I've ever seen .
I:9065;225;much better than The Sixth Sense.
I:9065;226;the acting of the master criminals is superb .
I:9065;227;Gabriel Byrne is fantastic as Dean Keaton, Kevin Pollak wonderful in a surprising turn, and Kevin Spacey in a (well.
I:9065;228;The supporting cast, including Chazz Palminteri and Pete Postlethwaite, is also outstanding.
I:9065;229;the real star of this film, though, is the plot.
I:9065;230;It's very well thought out, suspenseful, and keeps you on the edge of your seat.
I:9065;231;Though nothing can match watching it for the first time, it's great to watch it again and again.
I:9065;232;This film encompassed such ideas with flair and originality, which is probably the reason Brian Singer is sticking to sci.
I:9065;233;Only Memento and The Game are the only recent mystery movies worthy enough to stand beside this film.
I:9065;234;This film will always bring a smile to my face when I watch it with someone who hasn't seen this movie.
I:9065;235;keton is played by Gabriel Byrne, who is well.
I:9065;236;Pollak is great at this kind of role, and he has some great lines.
I:9065;237;Benicio del Toro, in his breakthrough role, is hilarious as a wisecracking criminal with a speech impediment.
I:9065;238;The speech impediment, where he mumbles constantly, makes him hard to understand, but it's very, very funny.
I:9065;239;Kevin Spacey is awesome in this movie.
I:9065;240;This is his best acting job ever.
I:9065;241;He won the Best Supporting Actor Academy Award for his work, and it is well deserved.
I:9065;242;The opening lineup scene is a classic, and is possibly the greatest opener ever, second only to the Diner Scene, from Reservoir Dogs.
I:9065;243;The movie jumps around a little, but by the second viewing it is easy to follow.
I:9065;244;The chilling climax will leave you speechless, and will put your head in a whirl.
I:9065;245;"The film won an Oscar for best screenplay and another for Kevin Spacey's ""supporting actor"" role."
I:9065;246;"Spacey's award was well deserved
I:9065;247;it's worth a look, though, partly because of how well and stylishly the finished production cheats on you.
I:9065;248;Obviously it got away with it, for most people.
I:9065;249;"Also, continuing the obvious parallels to ""Reservoir Dogs,"" this film is far more stunning in terms of cinematography, obviously a higher budget film (I can hear McQuarrie and director Bryan Singer, who were high school buds, pitching this film to prospective producers: ""It's an upscale 'Reservoir Dogs' with a bigger twist at the end,"" which is essentially what it is)."
I:9065;250;Any film with Spacey sharing extended screen time with Chazz Palmanteri is worth three stars for that alone, and Kevin Pollak and Gabriel Byrne are bonuses.
I:9065;251;"Another reviewer for Amazon asks if this is the perfect film, and the answer is, ""Far from it, but many of the elements are there."""
I:9065;252;I was looking forward to watching this as it's highly regarded as one of the best crime movies.
I:9065;253;The Usual Suspects is one of the finest films I've ever seen.
I:9065;254;It is peppered with magnificent performances, excellent direction, and a brilliant script(Which incidentally won the Oscar for Best Screenplay).
I:9065;255;Director Bryan Singer molds a tight and entertaining tale of five men, falsely brought in on charges of a stolen vehicle, then deciding to join forces and commit more crimes.
I:9065;256;Not only is the tale incredibly gripping, it is also downright hilarious at some points, making it such an enjoyable film.
I:9065;257;Kevin Spacey delivers an amazing performance as Verbal Kint, a scam artist cripple.
I:9065;258;Gabriel Byrne is great as the tough but compassionate Dean Keaton.
I:9065;259;Kevin Pollack delivers a strong and razor sharp comic relief role as Todd Hockney.
I:9065;260;One of the most surprisingly fantastic performances comes from Stephen Baldwin, who really packs a punch in this one.
I:9065;261;and very deservedly for Kevin Spacey and his awesome performance.
I:9065;262;There is a surprise ending that will knock you off your seat.
I:9065;263;Go out and see it.
I:9065;264;This is a classic movie that every crime/drama fan must have in their arsenal!
I:9065;265;This is an an entertaining, well acted and directed movie except the twist at the end tells you that everything you have seen is a concoction of one of the characters.
I:9065;266;"but ""The Ususal Suspects"" somehow gets away with it, probably because it is simply a better picture than ""Stage Fright."""
I:9065;267;This is one of those for sure!
I:9065;268;Great twists and turns, you will be in on the inside jokes the second time you watch.
I:9065;269;If you really like the kind of movies that are twisted and you really have to pay attention to find out where it is going, then you will love this one.
I:9065;270;The first time you watch it the movie keeps you guessing.
I:9065;271;"The ""Usual Suspects"" is a movie that has been since it's release very underrated."
I:9065;272;This film will keep you on your seat from beginning to end and unlike most movies nowadays does not drop off with a predictable ending.
I:9065;273;Kevin Spacey won a best Supporting Actor Oscar for his preformance and I can honestly say it is one of the finest I have ever seen.
I:9065;274;A great movie, one that if you have not seen, I highly suggest it.
I:9065;275;This was not a huge hit because of the violence, but nonetheless it is an exceptional movie.
I:9065;276;"Fans of movies like ""Snatch"" and ""Formula 51"" should enjoy it the most."
I:9065;277;All the support cast is a powerhouse of talent and could not have been cast better.
I:9065;278;Kudos for directing, sets, and music as well.
I:9065;279;I recommend it to adults that enjoy hard etched movies like those I mentioned.
I:9065;280;This is why 1995's The Usual Suspects is such an achievement.
I:9065;281;There followed a casting executive's dream roll call .
I:9065;282;and turned it into a stylish crime thriller of labyrinthine complexity with an ending that would become one of the most startling in cinema history, causing the viewer to reassess their opinion of the entire film in a way that would be emulated in later years by The Sixth Sense and Fight Club.
I:9065;283;Yet here was a film that did not shy from spectacle, with intense gun battles intercutting incredibly dense dialogue, edited together to look like a blockbuster of ten times its budget.
I:9065;284;In a nice twist, it begins with the death of the supposed central character (Gabriel Byrne in a wonderfully mysterious portrayal of an ex.
I:9065;285;con lured back into the game) and the rest of the film takes place almost entirely after the events it depicts.
I:9065;286;the Usual Suspects is that rare thing: A film in which no aspect is found wanting.
I:9065;287;This movie is by far the best suspense film on the planet.
I:9065;288;The fantastic acting by an amazing cast, mixed with a thick and well planned out plot, makes this movie a jaw.
I:9065;289;I could watch this movie once a year and enjoy it every time.
I:9065;290;Kevin Spacey is an amazing actor and doesn't disappoint in this movie.
I:9065;291;Keeps you on the edge of your seat until the very end.
I:9065;292;The entire cast is terrific, but any Kevin Spacey fan who has not see TUS is missing a great point in his career.
I:9065;293;Great actors doing what they do best.
I:9065;294;The right amount of suspense and intrigue.
I:9065;295;Great acting, great plot, great twist at end.
I:9065;296;Hadn't seen the movie in years, had my 15 yr old son and 20 yr old daughter watch and they enjoyed the movie as well.
I:9065;297;It contains one surprise after another.
I:9065;298;One was given to Christopher McQuarrie for best screenplay.
I:9065;299;making performance as the often likable Verbal Gent.
I:9065;300;He convincingly takes the viewer along a rollercoaster ride of lies and deceit.
I:9065;301;The cast is amazing including: Gabriel Byrne, Benicio del Toro, Kevin Pollak, Stephen Baldwin, and Chazz Palminteri.
I:9065;302;The film is a terrific story with twists and surprises that will definitely keep viewers guessing.
I:9065;303;Although on repeat viewings, you will know what the surprises, it is still a fantastic movie because you can go back and see things you did not notice the first time.
I:9065;304;This is a great film with such a convoluted plot and an awesome cast.
I:9065;305;ray high definition tops it all off.
I:9065;306;other than that, what a great movie!
I:9065;307;I truly love this movie.
I:9065;308;It simply has to be one of Kevin Spacey's all time best performances.
I:9065;309;A lot of excellent actors in this one.
I:9065;310;Twists and turns keep you guessing.
I:9065;311;Roller coaster ride with good ending.
I:9065;312;It's a good movie, and they chose an interesting group of mobsters.
I:9065;313;it had action, suspense and good acting.
I:9065;314;An excellent ensemble piece, admittedly with Spacey and Byrne giving standout performances in particular.
I:9065;315;Visually thrilling, vibrant, and smart.
I:9065;316;Suspects is still being constantly analysed and discussed with joy by its viewers.
I:9065;317;"Knowing that I was behind the times I decided to catch up with ""The Usual Suspects,"" the critically acclaimed, Oscar winning film from 1995 that launched Bryan Singer's directorial career."
I:9065;318;it is interesting that this is what started Singer's career, a career devoted pretty much to men who fly.
I:9065;319;Of course the myth is bigger than the man, but the build up is done quite well.
I:9065;320;As is a lot of this film, and I really have no intentions of dumping on it.
I:9065;321;And so it goes and that is the fun to be had.
I:9065;322;All caper movies have a twist ending, and as I mentioned earlier so does this one.
I:9065;323;"I was just hoping that it would have been a tiny bit more creative than the whole, ""Let's take the least likely ending possible and make that our ending"" bit."
I:9065;324;This starting point already sets the tone of this movie.
I:9065;325;the final scene, in which the agent interviewing Kevin Spacey manages to raise some of the obscurantist veil covering the whole real story is memorable and marvelous .
I:9065;326;the acting is second to none especially byrne as keaton+spacey as verbal plus an excellent performance from the underrated postlethwaite this movie has everything action comedy and an excellent ending just watch this again and again.
I:9065;327;Great movie and great service.
I:9065;328;This movie is an old classic and I loved it then and love it now.
I:9065;329;Saw this movie when it first came out and enjoyed it then.
I:9065;330;I like it again the second time I saw it.
I:9065;331;Then the greatness kicked in where everyone saw how good it was and it became one of the 90's best films.
I:9065;332;what makes the film work is not only the direction, score and the acting but it's a very sharply written story.
I:9065;333;While the ending to some might cheapen the film, it works given the context.
I:9065;334;"It's also very fascinating to watch the film
I:9065;335;I sat on the edge of my seat, gazing at the screen.
I:9065;336;As the end came barreling in, I was shocked by the complexity of the story line.
I:9065;337;By the end of the second viewing, a curtain opened, and I almost laughed at the simplicity.
I:9065;338;I highly recommend my favorite movie to anyone.
I:9065;339;This has got to be one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.
I:9065;340;And it has one of the best lines in it.
I:9065;341;It came out almost 20 years ago, but it was still good.
I:9065;342;Also liked prime member special.
I:9065;343;It flows nicely and keeps one's interest without overtaxing one's mental abilities.
I:9065;344;This is by far the best suspense thriller I have ever seen in my lifetime.
I:9065;345;What a great plot this movie had.
I:9065;346;To top it off the characters in the movie, especially Kevin Spacey, do an excellent job of delivering the script which is also well.
I:9065;347;They got me hook, line, and sinker.
I:9065;348;For all those who were able to predict the end of the film while watching it I'm glad you're smarter than the rest of us.
I:9065;349;The beauty comes from the subtle way Verbal manipulates his way through tough situations.
I:9065;350;I heard from so many people over the years how great this movie was.
I:9065;351;excellent acting, writing and a great twist.
I:9065;352;All the actors are superb and the plot is intense.
I:9065;353;This classic from the 90's should remain popular for a long time to come.
I:9065;354;spacey is really good and storyline is dated but well played.
I:9065;355;"well not to ruin anythign ""suspected first ending""."
I:9065;356;Though it is a deffinatly a top 200 film on IMdB and well should be, Spaceys performace was great.
I:9065;357;An exciting plot played by a great team of actors.
I:9065;358;The movie is actually simple but very intelligent!
I:9065;359;But who's really pulling the strings.
I:9065;360;The director captures all the tension without slowing down the pace.
I:9065;361;That's what makes this movie one to own.
I:9065;362;Watch it with your friends and see who figures it out first, and last.
I:9065;363;Those are the best kind and this is the best of the best.
I:9065;364;killer flick (pun not intended) spacey is amazing, byrne as well.
I:9065;365;i recommend that you try again
I:9065;366;Always love to watch this classic, If you have not watched this movie you owe it to yourself to watch it.
I:9065;367;Watch to the very end as the movie makes an awesome unexpected turn.
I:9065;368;It all ends up with one big ass surprise.
I:9065;369;An amazing twist to it.
I:9065;370;There's plenty to laugh at, as well as wait for in this movie.
I:9065;371;Lots of suspense, action and mystery.
I:9065;372;enough to make you watch it again, and again.
I:9065;373;Who is he, and what does he have to do with any of this?This movie was a brilliant marriage between spectacular acting and phenomenal writing.
I:9065;374;This movie is so worth your time, it's worth purchasing for your home collection.
I:9065;375;I have seen it many times and find something new in it each time I see it.
I:9065;376;I told my friends that it was the greatest movie I've ever seen, and they didn't believe my praises till they saw it for themselves.
I:9065;377;Greatest performance by Kevin Spacie!
I:9065;378;Beats American Beauty any day!
I:9065;379;Greatest Ending to a movie EVER!
I:9065;380;You are guaranteed to see it over and over again!
I:9065;381;Plot took a little bit to get going, but it came together quickly and kept me entertained and made my mind process it's own theory of who the real culprit was.
I:9065;382;The first time through is fun, but rewatching it is even better because you admire the genius and brutality of Soze as played by Spacey
I:9065;383;"There is much to recommend ""The Usual Suspects"" for."
I:9065;384;The film is surehandedly directed by first.
I:9065;385;The cast is uniformly excellent.
I:9065;386;The script, that won an Oscar, keeps you guessing until the very end.
I:9065;387;What I'm not certain of is whether this film meets the status as a modern day classic.
I:9065;388;It is certainly one of the more ambitious films in recent memory.
I:9065;389;That said, this film has a rabid partisan following that is understandable and I recommend this film to those who haven't seen it and let them judge it for themselves.
I:9065;390;An excellant conversation piece for years to come.
I:9065;391;Cleverly directed, the Usual Suspects has a good thematic sequence that explodes and is brought together scene by scene.
I:9065;392;This movie has to be one of Kevin Spacey's best movies.
I:9065;393;The first time I saw it, I was riveted to my seat in anticipation.
I:9065;394;Great suspense and ironic finish.
I:9065;395;New, and in perfect condition, not to mention, a smart movie.
I:9065;396;I would highly recommend it to those who like movies that make you think.
I:9065;397;Great movie, great cast, even Stephen Baldwin is good.
I:9065;398;This one holds up so check it out.
I:9065;399;If you enjoy twisted thrillers, sharp acting, and trick endings, then this is the movie for you!
I:9065;400;ray and Surround Sound make home entertainment lots better than the past.
I:9065;401;I liked this move and would recommend it.
I:9065;402;Always a great movie to watch with someone on the first viewing.
I:9065;403;Always a hit to watch because of the plot
I:9065;404;The Usual Suspects is a very effective movie for several reasons.
I:9065;405;One lesser reason the film is good is the surprise ending, which is a shocker and comes at you from out of nowhere.
I:9065;406;"However, I don't think the movie depends completely on the ending
I:9065;407;The cast is great, all bring the proper amount of intensity to their roles.
I:9065;408;How much of what we see is the truth is the real mystery.
I:9065;409;the ending is a surprise, and very well done, but I don't think the movie gave enough clues in order for us as viewers to figure it out.
I:9065;410;Even keeping that in mind, though, this movie is one of the better mystery thrillers I have seen in some time.
I:9065;411;If you can get by the profanity, which is properly used as this movie is about criminals, you will find this movie enjoyable and suspenseful.
I:9065;412;You will defiantly enjoy this movie
I:9065;413;These extra scenes are well worth seeing .
I:9065;414;which give a good insight into the making of the film and the ensemble cast.
I:9065;415;all of which is hilarious.
I:9065;416;The Usual Suspects is a solid and suspenseful movie.
I:9065;417;i thought it was an interesting movie, but i knew from the start what kind of twist the ending would provide.
I:9065;418;but the movie was well done and well acted.
I:9065;419;The Usual Suspects twists, turns, charms, and delivers a wallop of a twist, making this thriller one of the more memorable films of the 1990s.
I:9065;420;The acting is superb, with Spacey and Byrne turning in especially fine performances.
I:9065;421;Its haunting soundtrack evokes a cinematic atmosphere so particular to the film that even a few bars of it can evoke the entire movie.
I:9065;422;Ended up with the authors rendition of this movie.
I:9065;423;Excellent movie excellent actors great plot.
I:9065;424;kevin spacey made hs big breakthrough in this film and he s now recognised as the best actor of the 90s.
I:9065;425;gabriel byrne and ben del toro are also excellent.
I:9065;426;Smart, clever, and just really good.
I:9065;427;The writer of this movie is a genius.
I:9065;428;This is a great drama that leaves you going Oh WOW at the end.
I:9065;429;The actors are great, the story line keeps your interest from the beginning to the surprise ending.
I:9065;430;Round up the usual suspects is a line from Casablanca (1942), as most movie buffs know.
I:9065;431;It is just the sort of cynically ironic line that would inspire Singer and McQuarrie to dream up this exceedingly cynical, but bordering on the funny, flick.
I:9065;432;"while Casablanca was a bittersweet love story, ""The Usual Suspects"" is anything but."
I:9065;433;These guys are all excellent actors who together create a kind mass energy that propels the film.
I:9065;434;In all three films the cast is outstanding, with Al Pacino, Jack Lemon, Ed Harris, Alex Baldwin, Kevin Spacey and Alan Arkin leading the cast in Glengarry, and Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi doing the same in Reservoir Dogs.
I:9065;435;They know how to look and act authentic.
I:9065;436;"And of course Verbal is very verbal and able to spout lines like, ""The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world that he didn't exist."
I:9065;437;Keep that line in mind as you watch, and ask yourself who plays Keyser Soze, the devil incarnate, so to speak.
I:9065;438;That will help to unravel the plot.
I:9065;439;The ending contains a nicely set up surprise.
I:9065;440;inspired dialogue and devil man care anti.
I:9065;441;Personally I thought the movie was a laugh.
I:9065;442;I actually laughed out loud at some of the theatrics and grinned with appreciation at how surely Singer had captured the mentality of the targeted audience while bonding with it.
I:9065;443;"They really believe there are tough guys who say ""f.you"" even with a gun shoved in their face, and there really are guys who see the world in a kind of cops/robbers, good guy/bad guy, buddy/rat persona world."
I:9065;444;And there's some truth to it.
I:9065;445;spacey won a supporting actor Oscar playing Verbal Kint, a kind of crippled loser, it would seem.
I:9065;446;He should have won Best Actor, he was that good and he was the heart of the film and the guy with whom the audience most identified.
I:9065;447;I think that is what the targeted audience really loves about this movie.
I:9065;448;A few academic dissertations have been and will be written on how the cinematic hero has evolved from, say, Tom Mix to Verbal Kint.
I:9065;449;It combines incredible acting talent, riveting script, and direction that is remininsce of the classic thrillers of the 40's and 50's.
I:9065;450;Bryan Singer does a terrific job as the director, and Christopher McQuarrie's script is something all hopeful screenplay writers aspire to accomplish.
I:9065;451;The script won the Oscar, as well as Kevin Spacey, for Best Supporting Actor.
I:9065;452;This scene is terrific, with the men taking money from a police Taxi service, and many officers indicted on transporting criminals in their squad cars for profit.
I:9065;453;This scheme shows how well the five work together, and sets up the rest of the movie.
I:9065;454;I won't go into further details, but let me tell you that the intermix of scenes of Spacey's narrative and the story he tells is perfectly done.
I:9065;455;And you have to see the mind.
I:9065;456;The Usual Suspects is a great film, and I have high hopes that you'll enjoy it to.
I:9065;457;Other than that, a great movie.
I:9065;458;Evergreen thriller with spectacular acting job from Kevin Spacey.
I:9065;459;winning performance by Kevin Spacey, EVERY other performance is top.
I:9065;460;"fashioned crime mystery/thriller
I:9065;461;The soundtrack is superb, and propels the movie along without you realizing it (which really is the point of it, right?)
I:9065;462;"It's one of the very few movies you'll ever see where as soon as it's over your immediate reaction will be ""WOW!"
I:9065;463;"Now I need to see it all over again!"""
I:9065;464;Watching it twice only enhances the enjoyment.
I:9065;465;I had heard great things said about this movie and so i decided to watch it.
I:9065;466;"Very good movie
I:9065;467;Classic noir tale with twists and turns designed to keep you on the edge of your seat literally till the last scene of the movie.
I:9065;468;This is a superb film in virtually every aspect.
I:9065;469;The script is outstanding: the dialogue shines, the plot is always mesmerizing, and the final scene is just plain excellent.
I:9065;470;The cast is a perfect ensemble.
I:9065;471;He won the first of his 2 Oscars for The Usual Suspects, the second coming for American Beauty in 1999.
I:9065;472;This film also won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay.
I:9065;473;This is a dazzling piece of updated film noir for the post.
I:9065;474;This is easily one of the more memorable films from the '90s.
I:9065;475;studded cast is a delight to watch, but the film is so fixated on its own cleverness and originality that it quickly loses interest, deadening the impact of a surprise twist ending that may have worked had it had a better lead.
I:9065;476;All of this is narrated and seen in the mind of Kint, played with a fiendish glee by Kevin Spacey, who turns in a well.
I:9065;477;The rest of the cast also leave lasting impressions: Stephen Baldwin makes a great all.
I:9065;478;Many will disagree with my thoughts on The Usual Suspects, and some may even recommend watching it twice to understand the film's twists.
I:9065;479;One of the few movies I can enjoy time after time.
I:9065;480;Gabriel Byrne and Kevin Spacey are sublime, Pete Postlethwaite a deliciously eloquent villain, Christopher McQuarrie's script an energetic, imaginative maze of twists and conflicts, and Bryan Singer's direction rock.
I:9065;481;steady, making this one of the most stylish films of the '90s but still packing it with enough substance and character to back up the flair.
I:9065;482;One of the grandest tricks in The Usual Suspects is to create a thoroughly winning hero, yet forcing you to applaud the ingenuity of the victorious villains at the end.
I:9065;483;a high point in '90s cinema.
I:9065;484;Excellent movie, and it will keep you on the edge of your seats from start to finish.
I:9065;485;If you like suspense, mystery and fine acting, this is a movie for you!
I:9065;486;It's one of my favorite movies of all time.
I:9065;487;A great movie with one of the most famous ending ever .
I:9065;488;do yourself a favor and watch this movie.
I:9065;489;Twists and turns and amazing story telling from one of the finest actors around (Spacey) fill this movie from start to finish.
I:9065;490;I've seen it 8 times.
I:9065;491;If you like movies with unexpected turns, you'll love this movie.
I:9065;492;absolutely well done and suspenseful!no spoon.
I:9065;493;Like other 1 star reviews, I love the actors in this film, but the actual characters in the movie are far from like.
I:9065;494;this movie has great acting (in addition to Palminteri and Spacey, Stephen Baldwin, Gabriel Byrne, Benicio del Toro, and Pete Postlethwaite also have prominent roles) and flawless directing by Bryan Singer.
I:9065;495;It is gripping throughout, moves at precisely the right pace, and is complex enough that one never figures out to the end who Sse really is.
I:9065;496;this is one movie worth watching twice, once to follow the action and once to go back and see what hints were given along the way to prepare us for the conclusion.
I:9065;497;This is one of the all time greats, with many classic lines .
I:9065;498;he devil's best trick was to convince the world he didn't exist .
I:9065;499;One of the best written movies of all time.
I:9065;500;Awesome twist that you never see coming.
I:9065;501;It was really good, and quite original yet still ultimatly forgettable.
I:9065;502;The Usual Suspects is a real treat for movie lovers who enjoy film noir and caper movies.
I:9065;503;it's an exciting thiller and it's so FUNNY without breaking the mood.
I:9065;504;Kevin Spacey is always aces, but he earns his Oscar as he introduces us to the story of Keyser Soze .
I:9065;505;a new name that everyone will know.
I:9065;506;Second best movie of the 90's .
I:9065;507;I've since bought the special edition, and I highly recommend it.
I:9065;508;Deleted scenes and the blooper reel are so.
I:9065;509;so, but the discussions with the actors are fascinating, as is the trip to the Cannes film festival.
I:9065;510;And some people will wonder what all the buzz was about.
I:9065;511;In 1995 the Oscar for Best Picture went to Mel Gibson's Braveheart.
I:9065;512;noir/thriller that's loaded with great performances from an ensemble cast, a great score and a whooping of a twist ending that's quite literally jaw.
I:9065;513;This is a film that's truly memorable and deserves to be a classic.
I:9065;514;The film does an excellent job of playing with your mind, and at the same time convincing you that you think you know what's going on, but it's not until the final ten minutes that you'll start to be able to pull back and look at the big picture and realize that you've been had.
I:9065;515;But a lot of praise should also go to the fine cast as well, including Stephen Baldwin, Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Pollak, Chazz Palminteri, Benicio Del Toro, Pete Postlethwaite and a really knockout performance from Kevin Spacey, which earned him an Oscar for the role of Verbal.
I:9065;516;It's a complicated, well crafted and nearly flawlessly written thriller that's exciting and puzzling to watch the first time, and fun to watch again and again.
I:9065;517;This is one of my top ten favorite films of the nineties, and one of my all.
I:9065;518;time personal favorites as well.
I:9065;519;A good enough crime saga with some great one.
I:9065;520;liners and several sharp twists and turns, but not something I'd revere alongside the all.
I:9065;521;"Tough to follow at many times, with some interesting storytelling experiments along the way
I:9065;522;very good story that often gets too caught up in itself.
I:9065;523;This movie was really good.
I:9065;524;This is one of the best movies.
I:9065;525;It is all about characters and it is so well written and suspenseful.
I:9065;526;I think Benicio is hilarious in this.
I:9065;527;This is a solid movie and a classic.
I:9065;528;i have no problem with Benicio Del Toro or Peter Postlethwaite but I have never seen an especially enjoyable performance from either one of them.
I:9065;529;he sort of takes his hands off the steering wheel and lets the film coast to its conclusion.
I:9065;530;well it is very good.
I:9065;531;This movie was thrilling from the first frame to the ironic, blood.
I:9065;532;laugh because you didn't figure it out first end!
I:9065;533;This was the first film my wife and I viewed on our Amazon Prime account.
I:9065;534;If you like Kevin Spacey you'll like this action suspense movie.
I:9065;535;We really liked the film and our new Amazon Prime first experience.
I:9065;536;We originally watched this on VHS about 15 years ago, and it is still a great film.
I:9065;537;also, the streaming was excellent, and I really appreciate the closed captions.
I:9065;538;This is one of those films that at the end you can't believe it, it was so well put together
I:9065;539;I highly recommend this film to anybody who loves a good mystery.
I:9065;540;The movie tantalizes you with directing.
I:9065;541;And the movie flows so smoothly, that you will not see the surprise ending coming.
I:9065;542;Truly an engrossing film to watch.
I:9065;543;I first saw this polished gem of a film when I was thirteen.
I:9065;544;Of course at that age I was blown away by how cool and clever it was.
I:9065;545;And I think I always will have an affection for it, because despite not being as amazing as I thought, it is a genuinely smart and cool movie, nearly perfect within its own niche.
I:9065;546;the 'usual suspects' are a group of career criminals rounded up to take some heat for a truck heist.
I:9065;547;a few people seem to see this as a standard crime caper with a twist ending, and one that means that the whole story does not make much sense.
I:9065;548;The ending deconstructs the slick pretensions of 'cool' crime movies.
I:9065;549;The trick this devil pulls is to make us believe that his actions make him more than a man, make him a mythical figure beyond normal humanity, thus bolstering his self.
I:9065;550;so in thinking that this film is clever and cool perhaps I am dancing with the devil.
I:9065;551;The charm of The Usual Suspects is that it allows us to live inside that dream world for a few hours and enjoy the ride.
I:9065;552;A great thriller and a heck of a good view.
I:9065;553;This is a movie made for intelligent people.
I:9065;554;It plays with our perceptions and establishes a mind duel with the audience: will you be able to decipher its plot?
I:9065;555;Get ready for top notch performances by the whole cast, especially Kevin Spacey and fellow Puerto Rican Benicio del Toro.
I:9065;556;I like nothing better than stumbling upon a really good movie you know nothing about.
I:9065;557;Take my word and just watch it.
I:9065;558;This is a mystery/crime drama of the 1990's that is one of the best films of all time.
I:9065;559;"it has all the elements of what I feel truly makes a movie ""one of the best""."
I:9065;560;This is without a doubt an amazingly great screenplay.
I:9065;561;While it does borrow from old films from time to time, it is just so well done.
I:9065;562;Kevin Spacey, hands down, is the best actor around right now.
I:9065;563;The rest of the cast is excellent.
I:9065;564;He is very convincing as the cop.
I:9065;565;This is a great story.
I:9065;566;It is very well crafted in every capacity a film can be.
I:9065;567;A must see if you like a good mystery.
I:9065;568;Elizabeth Essenfeld says:This movie is hilarious!
I:9065;569;A great cast with all the turns and twists you could ask for.
I:9065;570;If you are a fan of 'Resevoir Dogs' and 'Momento', you will love 'The Usual Suspects'.
I:9065;571;The latter is a COMPLETE book with a superior picture and great EXTRAS.
I:9065;572;This is a fantastic film.
I:9065;573;Good service, all that jazz.
I:9065;574;This movie not only had a lot of action, but also had a great plot and a great cast.
I:9065;575;If you have not seen this movie yet and you like good movies, I strongly suggest you do so, like right now!
I:9065;576;everything about it: the 5 main characters that glamourized being a crook, the action sequences, the story that slowly unravels and keeps you watching until the end that throws it all back in your face.
I:9065;577;And the movie could be hilarious when it wanted to be.
I:9065;578;This movie was made in 35 days and wow what an awesome movie.
I:9065;579;this is an awesome performance by kevin spacey, who gives his best performance to date.
I:9065;580;the dialogue is nicely put and everything comes together nicely.
I:9065;581;and i can garantee you will watch it more than once if you do see it the first time.
I:9065;582;this is one of the best movies ever made.
I:9065;583;The surprise ending wasn't as surprising as it might have been, but the film is so well written, well plotted, and well put together that it really doesn't matter.
I:9065;584;Many of the twists along the way were surprising.
I:9065;585;All in all it's a great movie with some fabulous performances.
I:9065;586;I was, and still is one of the best thrillers to cpome down the road.
I:9065;587;This movie is one of the great movies of the 90's.
I:9065;588;The story is awesome and after all these years the plot twist is still great to watch.
I:9065;589;The Usual Suspects is such a phenomenal story, with a great ensemble cast .
I:9065;590;The special features on here are probably equal to the length of the movie itself, and offer really great insight into the director, editor, and cast.
I:9065;591;Extensive interviews with the key players reveal inside information that is fascinating.
I:9065;592;the plot is wonderful, involving a small crew of big.
I:9065;593;He is ruthless, brutal, powerful and hugely successful.
I:9065;594;each actor does an incredible job of getting into his character's skin, and each man makes the viewer believe that he feels each and every little tic and itch his character would feel.
I:9065;595;I suspect it'll keep most people guessing.
I:9065;596;Even then, after knowing how it ends, watching it over and over again is still enjoyable, simply because of the details and hints to the truth one picks up.
I:9065;597;Plus, the characters are so engaging, and the chemistry between all of them works so well, it's just a supremely enjoyable ride every time.
I:9065;598;After having watched it perhaps 10 times, it's still something I pull out now and then.
I:9065;599;the script is excellent, proving that there are other screenwriters who know how criminals sound.
I:9065;600;this film has the greatest line i've ever heard in a move the greatest trick the devil ever pulled, was convincing the world that he didn't exist.
I:9065;601;Great movie that keeps the intrigue and suspense high, and keeps you guessing the whole way through.
I:9065;602;I watch this movie regularly and still find it refreshing.
I:9065;603;The story, plot and actors are really good and will keep you glued to the end.
I:9065;604;Kevin Spacey won an Oscar for his work in this movie.
I:9065;605;This movie is definitely one of the new modern classics .
I:9065;606;definitely within the top 50 movies of all times.
I:9065;607;Worth the price of admission 20 times over!
I:9065;608;Normally I am very good at figuring out the plot and it's twist and turns, but not in this case.
I:9065;609;A really great movie that is practically an unknown.
I:9065;610;A great movie for anyone who likes suspence and drama
I:9065;611;Have seen this several times still love it.
I:9065;612;I would always recommended this movie no matter what type of genre your preference is.
I:9065;613;that said,this is an absolutely fantastic,exciting take on the subject.
I:9065;614;every actor is incredible(yes,even the baldwin guy!)
I:9065;615;the one who steals the show is mr spacey.
I:9065;616;like i always say,LEAVE OUT RAPPERS/SINGERS/MODELS and your movie will be 80% better.
I:9065;617;Some may have seen it coming, but to those who didn't, it makes for one great surprise.
I:9065;618;"The method of getting to the story's climax is what ""makes"" this suspense fantastic."
I:9065;619;"There are some plot events that you will naturally look back to as ""aha"" moments."
I:9065;620;"You can credit the screen writers for coming up with this
I:9065;621;smart writing carries this film, albeit with a superfluity of profanity spewed about.
I:9065;622;Its plot is its main strength, and this is the kind of film you can watch again and pick up on things you missed before.
I:9065;623;if you love suspense and twists, then this is the movie for you.
I:9065;624;it is an incredible story spun as a tale.you won't be disappointed.
I:9065;625;I had heard for year about what a great movie this was but when I finally got around to watching it I wasn't impressed.
I:9065;626;Great cast and I liked Kevin Spacey as always, but it literally put me to sleep.
I:9065;627;It's like 1 hour and 30 minutes of great action builds up to the 10 minute ending, the most intense 10 minutes in the history of moving pictures.
I:9065;628;And the second time you see it, you notice things you didn't notice before when you didn't know the ending, and you realize how complex and detailed this movie really is.
I:9065;629;And Kevin Spaceys achievement is just great.
I:9065;630;I've seen this movies about 20 times or so, and it's still great, but nothing can beat the first time you see this.
I:9065;631;This is one of those movies that you can comfortably watch multiple times.
I:9065;632;Very engaging and you begin to pick up small things when you watch it over.
I:9065;633;One of the best ensemble cast crime dramas ever, the only Usual thing about this film is that it is now usual to here people list it among their top movies.
I:9065;634;One of my favorite movies.
I:9065;635;Recommend it to anyone who wants a who dun it.
I:9065;636;A few of my favorite actors
I:9065;637;This is the movie that first brought the Great acting of Kevin Spacey to my Attention.
I:9065;638;This movie is a good Thinker movie that keeps you guessing.
I:9065;639;Kevin is great in this movie, and I have to say this is a must see.
I:9065;640;Keven Spacey is as usual giving a great performance.
I:9065;641;I consider this movie to be one of the greatest thrillers of the 90's.
I:9065;642;He and the story he reveals will have you guessing about the ending and your answer will always be wrong.
I:9065;643;"The movie is fun but scary in a freaky kind of way at the same time Great performances all around, this kinda reminds me of ""The Long Kiss Goodnight""Overall."
I:9065;644;A well thought out plot with many a twist.
I:9065;645;it will leave you guessing who done it to the very end
I:9065;646;The Usual Suspects, is, in my mind, one of the most fantastic pieces of film.
I:9065;647;making ever to grace our screens.
I:9065;648;That a group of people can come up with a piece of fiction that is so excellent in every way, from start to finish, is frightening.
I:9065;649;a lot is made of the film's ending.
I:9065;650;the cast is, in a word, flawless.
I:9065;651;He turns in a performance that is so moving and outstanding that he should have got three Oscars.
I:9065;652;Byrne is fantastic, Del Toro adds continental flair, and Postlethwaite is disturbingly dark, yet calculated.
I:9065;653;by all means watch this film, and observe its strong points, from Bryan Singer's masterful direction to the equally pleasing musical score.
I:9065;654;Prepare yourself for a rollercoaster ride and the best ending EVER in a film made anywhere in the world.
I:9065;655;"By now everyone knows ""The Usual Suspects"" so I won't comment on the film, just this MGM Special Edition
I:9065;656;As I said in the headline, this is worthy of the Criterion Collection but at a very affordable price.
I:9065;657;"The second commentary of by John Ottman, the editor and composer, and this one is a revelation to anyone who is interested in filmmaking, specifically ""putting the film together after the finished shoot"": editing and scoring."
I:9065;658;"There is plenty here that ""Suspects"" fans will appreciate."
I:9065;659;"minute documentary on ""Keyser Sose: Lie or Legend"" which is funny and informative."
I:9065;660;itis, and adapting films to their perception of what an audience wants after multiple pre.
I:9065;661;Great actoing on all levels.
I:9065;662;This movie without a doubt is one of the best (after.
I:9065;663;Pure suspence, tention and mystery to the end.
I:9065;664;Just good as i remember it when i saw it a long time ago as kid.
I:9065;665;I was reading a true crime book and in it.
I:9065;666;I wanted to see it and tie it into the book I was reading.
I:9065;667;This is worth watching if just to see and try to understand what's going on.
I:9065;668;This film is a brilliant masterstroke.
I:9065;669;for director Bryan Singer, for writer Christopher McQuarrie, for all the cast of exceptional actors, and most notably, for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, for finally getting it right.
I:9065;670;The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was making the world believe he didn't exist.
I:9065;671;You shall see the greatest trick in this film is Spacey's ability to completely stare straight and tell the truth.
I:9065;672;The tight dialogue is great.
I:9065;673;liners you'll be saying for weeks.
I:9065;674;The cinematography is amazing, as is the moving score which evokes the old noir classics of the 1940s and 1950s.
I:9065;675;Gabriel Byrne is in top, intense form, as is the unlikely pair of Kevin Pollack and Stephan Baldwin.
I:9065;676;Theatrical oldtimer Pete Postlethwaite is amazing, as is Chazz Palmintieri.
I:9065;677;It is a classic movie that shaped a genre.
I:9065;678;I could watch it a hundred times and still marvel at it.
I:9065;679;Kevin Spacey did an outstanding job in this movie.
I:9065;680;I loved the twists and turns and suprises along the way.
I:9065;681;The movie holds your attention and is entertaining all the way through.
I:9065;682;One of the better films in this genre.
I:9065;683;With that said the movie is amazing, stay patient with it and it will deliver.
I:9065;684;This is a thriller on lots of levels.
I:9065;685;ray is excellent, and clearly better than the very.
I:9065;686;It will really add to your enjoyment of this noir classic, at a not unreasonable cost.
I:9065;687;Great plot, great acting, great everything.
I:9065;688;It's for those who may have heard that it's an ingenious film with a startling surprise ending.
I:9065;689;It's not nearly as inventive as Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs, but it is clever enough for an evening's entertainment.
I:9065;690;And yes again, the cast is impressive.
I:9065;691;more impressive than the dialogue or the direction.
I:9065;692;everything was just so perfect, whether it be the acting, writing, etc.
I:9065;693;It draws you in early on and never lets go.
I:9065;694;The ending will definitely surprise you (just don't read any articles about it first).
I:9065;695;The acting is brilliant .
I:9065;696;He truly deserved that Academy Award for this.
I:9065;697;The movie, of course, is great.
I:9065;698;Five men pull off a successful heistthat brings the attention of an unseen crime figure.
I:9065;699;this is a terrific film with a great cast.
I:9065;700;This specialedition has nice picture and sound plus neat extras.
I:9065;701;With lots of plot twists and one of the best surprise endings in all of Filmdom, The Usual Suspects entertains and instructs on every level.
I:9065;702;Great cast, great performances, great script, great director.
I:9065;703;Did I mention that I liked it?
I:9065;704;THE USUAL SUSPECTS is my favorite movie of the 1990s.
I:9065;705;I remember seeing it in the theater opening weekend.
I:9065;706;It was amazing, and I ended up seeing the movie in the theater seven times.
I:9065;707;christopher McQuarrie's Oscar winning script is brilliant.
I:9065;708;There are so many details packed into the movie that it requires multiple viewings, perhaps even as many as a dozen, to be fully appreciated.
I:9065;709;And even after that it still gets better with each viewing.
I:9065;710;Bryan Singer's directing is based on a love of movie making and a very strong, deep respect for the intelligence of the audience.
I:9065;711;Newton Thomas Segal's camera direction helps to give a classy, 1940s feel to the movie which makes it all that much more interesting.
I:9065;712;John Ottman's musical score and editing are the final seal in making this movie absolutely perfect.
I:9065;713;in Bryan Singer's masterful directorial debut we learn how, six weeks earlier, the five men (Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Pollak, Stephen Baldwin, Benicio del Torro and Spacey) came together in the film's most famous scene .
I:9065;714;a razor sharp script by Christopher McQuarrie (which won an Oscar for best screenplay), brilliantly taut and suspenseful direction and a fine ensemble cast make The Usual Suspects an electrifying experience.
I:9065;715;It possesses all the components to make it one of the best thrillers in recent memory, and will literally have you on the edge of your seat.
I:9065;716;I highly recommend this movie.
I:9065;717;The movie is also very well.
I:9065;718;"written by Christopher McQuarrie and expertly directed by Bryan Singer (both of them would reunite to, respectively, co. write [with Nathan Alexander] and direct ""Valkyrie""
I:9065;719;One of the best movies EVER!
I:9065;720;This is an amazing movie that keeps you riveted and guessing the entire time!
I:9065;721;Character development is excellent, pacing is outstanding, this is just a great flik with a stunner of an ending!
I:9065;722;This movie is a amazing tale that you leaves one trying to figure it out when it is over.
I:9065;723;It is a superb show.
I:9065;724;This movie is so great.
I:9065;725;so powerful and with high suspense.
I:9065;726;kevin Spacey is a great actor as always.
I:9065;727;And I say all actors and the director did a great job especially with the amazing score.
I:9065;728;I'd recommend you watch both movies because they're both so powerful and with a surprisingly extreme twist at the end.
I:9065;729;But these actors play with words and phrases and nuances like children play with building blocks.
I:9065;730;Story telling should always be this good.
I:9065;731;Every actor's performance, although written to be over the top, just works perfectly.
I:9065;732;We've love to share this movie with people that have never seen it, just to watch their reaction and their faces light up when they put it all together.
I:9065;733;Especially with the holiday season coming up, I can see no better present than a wonderfully written, seamlessly portrayed, SMART movie that your friends and loved ones will thank you for.
I:9065;734;Pretty good for the fare hollywood is putting out today.
I:9065;735;This movie is a good first watch, after that it seems like every other action/thriller with a twist ending but not as thrilling or action packed or dramatic or envoking or .
I:9065;736;On the other hand, I am obligated to give this movie 5 stars because of the excellent but somewhat confusing plot (at least the first time you watch it), the unpredicatable ending, the great shootouts, the neat humor, and the mystery of Keiser Soze.
I:9065;737;This movie will definitely be a lot better to understand the more times you see it.
I:9065;738;The criminals refuse but he informs them that Mr. Soze knows all of their criminal records.
I:9065;739;What happens next is amazing and very unpredictable.
I:9065;740;But the way the movie is made is absolutely incredible and so very unpredictible, and doesn't give away much of the details of the actions of who (in the end) seems to be the bad guy .
I:9065;741;I have seen it about a dozen times, and I keep seeing passages i haven't seen before, therefor I simply have to rate this as the ultimate masterpiece.
I:9065;742;KEVIN SPACEY is one of my FAVORITE actors and he is BRILLIANT in this role (he won an Academy Award for this performance).
I:9065;743;One MAJOR strength of this film is the incredibly POWERFUL ENSEMBLE CAST (chemistry for days).
I:9065;744;The other is the Academy Award WINNING SCREENPLAY that weaves a MESMERIZING tale that bends, twists, flips, and curves every way but the way expected.
I:9065;745;There's a cardinal unspoken agreement between a filmmaker and his audience.
I:9065;746;You may have heard this already, but the ending really does negate the entire film thanks to the storytelling device chosen.
I:9065;747;gabriel Byrne and Stephen Baldwin are easily as good if not better.
I:9065;748;If you're willing to overlook that fact, and just enjoy the journey for its own sake (even knowing that the destination makes the trip moot), then you'll enjoy it.
I:9065;749;And one plus is that the filmmaker's commentary track is one of the better ones around.
I:9065;750;an entertaining film, if you're willing to ignore that it makes itself almost meaningless by the end.
I:9065;751;This was THE outstanding movie of 1995 and recommend for anybody to see it.
I:9065;752;in fact it is better than anything he has ever done.
I:9065;753;It makes brilliant use of its complicated plot and characterisations with exceptional style.
I:9065;754;Everybody excels to powerful and utterly convincing performances.
I:9065;755;Kevin Spacey of which was the most impressive playing the crippled suspect and thoroughly deserving his best supporting actor oscar.
I:9065;756;The pace is electrifying and the direction slick by Brian Synger.
I:9065;757;It keeps you gripped right until the end when you can only moan to yourself, it was him all along.
I:9065;758;Interesting, original, gripping, slick .
I:9065;759;This is one of the best movies ever made.
I:9065;760;The cast is perfect, the story holds your attention throughout.
I:9065;761;ray the picture and sound is perfect.
I:9065;762;I was happy to see this movie was available.
I:9065;763;It wasn't until an hour until the movie that it began to make sense in my mind, and then the ending hit me in the face.
I:9065;764;Kevin Spacey is convincing, and brilliant!
I:9065;765;Simply, one of the best movies ever!
I:9065;766;It has you from the start and the Ending.
I:9065;767;This is a movie I'll keep coming back to.
I:9065;768;Definitely a movie that is best if you go into it without knowing a single thing about it.
I:9065;769;Just watch it, and you will enjoy it.
I:9065;770;A classic film about a group of bad guys who don't seem to understand that they are being manipulated by unseen hands.
I:9065;771;Great acting, dialog and suspense.
I:9065;772;Well written and directed and will keep you watching and guessing until the end, then for a while after that.
I:9065;773;Grand stuff to watch with a few buddies, sipping some beers and puffing on a good cigar.
I:9065;774;This is, without question, one of the best films of 1995, and one of the best mysteries ever.
I:9065;775;This sets into motion a chain of events that will lead them to Keyser's lawyer, Kobayashi.
I:9065;776;This was a vehicle for Spacey, and he works it like a wind.
I:9065;777;Gabriel Burns is his usual talented self, and Benicio Del Toro is hilarious as Fenster.
I:9065;778;It's worth it, though, in the end to know Who Is Keyser Sze?
I:9065;779;A very clever film by Bryan Singer.
I:9065;780;"i rank it with the best classic mysteries, such as Hitchcock's ""Rebecca"", Welles' ""The Third Man"" and ""The Lady from Shanghai"", and similar films, ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"", ""The Big Sleep"", ""Farewell, My Lovely"", and ""Laura""."
I:9065;781;"however, the film it rivals most closely, in my opinion, is David Mamet's utterly absorbing, and demanding, and brilliant 1987 masterpiece, starring Lindsay Crouse and Joe Mantegna, ""House of Games""."
I:9065;782;These young, bright, and talented filmmakers, McQuarrie, Singer and cast, filmed a story that holds your attention for 122 minutes, keeps you guessing even after the end, and provokes the audience to reflect.
I:9065;783;There's also the superb cinematography of Sigel and crafty editing by Ottman.
I:9065;784;The Usual Suspects deserved awards for Best Film.
I:9065;785;Kevin Spacey is amazing throughout the entire film.

I:9065;787;office success, and is listed as #15 on the top movies of all time list.
I:9065;788;The R rating is due to some violence, but mostly the extreme profanity, and although the extremety of it occurs mostly in the first 30 minutes, the rest of the movie still carries a substantial amount of strong language.
I:9065;789;provoking, the movie delivers the most incredible and creative ending that I have ever seen.
I:9065;790;The film itself is worthy of a very strong five.
I:9065;791;while it's fantastic to have one of my favorite films of all time in high definition at last, the extras here are non.
I:9065;792;To play on the impossibility for these cops to believe such a story can exist is your best diversion, disguise.
I:9065;793;This tactic has been used by other thrillers, but in this case it is very persuasive and the film works very well provided we do not profile the thriller.
I:9065;794;It's a classic movie all the guys in this film are at the top of there game a must see and for sure a must have.
I:9065;795;This is the unique story of 5 criminals and an anonymous crime lord.
I:9065;796;This movie is a masterpiece with an amazing ironic climax.
I:9065;797;This story is great because the plot does nothing but puzzle you for the entire duration of the movie, then in the last 2 minutes most of your questions are answered and you can lean back in your seat holding your head thinking what a great movie that was, but I think I have to watch it again because there was something I didn't quite understand .
I:9065;798;chosen cast sinks into the plot and is so well constructed and believable that you're going to hope its all fiction.
I:9065;799;This movie is ironic, suspenseful, mysterious, classic and most importantly, cool.
I:9065;800;This film is a classic that we can compare all other movies to.
I:9065;801;In 1995 a film was made that not only gained commercial and critical acclaim but also made the career of one of the world's greatest actors, Kevin Spacey.
I:9065;802;'The Usual Suspects' is a film like no other, a fabulous story, fantastic characters, a sympathetic protagonist and a twist that cannot be rivaled in modern cinema.
I:9065;803;the performances in the film are brilliant, as always Spacey's performance is amazing his pure air on camera makes the audience sit up and watch.
I:9065;804;In playing somewhat of a comic relief role Benicio Del Toro is fabulous and often hilarious.
I:9065;805;The work of Gabriel Byrne can never be underrated and in 'The Usual Suspects' he shines.
I:9065;806;the direction in the film is masterful as the viewer truly gets a feeling of the nitty, gritty world of crime and is one of the few films where the twist isn't given away prematurely.
I:9065;807;Bryan Singer has truly created a masterpiece of modern cinema that has not been surpassed on the micro/macro level since.
I:9065;808;"The film is faultless
I:9065;809;easily merits another viewing of what I now belive is the greatest collaborative/suspense epic (yes epic) ever.
I:9065;810;Suspenseful, cliff hangar that is well acted.
I:9065;811;Kevin Spacey was terrific in his role.

I:9065;821;As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that the mysterious Keyser Soze is pulling the strings and making the quintet dance to his own tune.
I:9065;822;"Benicio Del Toro's small part as ""Fenster"" was hilarious ."

I:9065;826;But quickly morphs into a modern day urban legends movie that simply rocks.
I:9065;827;this is a great movie from beggining to end,the most shocking end to a film i've ever seen.
I:9065;828;Out of the mind of Christorpher McQurrie comes this incredible story of a man in search of the devil.
I:9065;829;up by law enforcement to put several guilty men together in the same line up, the tale proceeds cross country and culminates with a powerful, but mysterious kingpin by the name of Keyser Soze.
I:9065;830;The center piece of the Unusual group is their leader, a remarkable individual named Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne, incredible performance).
I:9065;831;What transpires in this movie from moment to moment is a lesson in sleigh of hand.
I:9065;832;A superb classic in both mystery and action entertainment, by Bryan Singer.
I:9065;833;Byrne and Spacey are great actors, but it's really the plot that carries this movie.
I:9065;834;For the first time in history, The Usual Suspects allows the words Stephen Baldwin and fantastic movie to be used in the same sentence.
I:9065;835;I got this movie off a recommendation from an all time movie list, and I wasn't disappointed.
I:9065;836;Interesting storyline with a big but fitting twist at the very end.
I:9065;837;This is a really good movie.
I:9065;838;Watched after the ocean's 11 and these are some great actors in this movie.
I:9065;839;The acting was very good.
I:9065;840;It was full of suspense, The plot was very clever.
I:9065;841;But each minute brings the viewer deeper and deeper into a world in which things are not as they seem.
I:9065;842;great performances, especially by Gabriel Byrne as Dean Keaton, the one.
I:9065;843;written and captivating from beginning to end.
I:9065;844;it causes fans to reevaluate what drew thm to the genre in the first place and rekindles their enthusiasm for it.
I:9065;845;The Usual Suspects is all the more remarkable for having an all.
I:9065;846;star cast, akin to The Dirty Dozen .
I:9065;847;much of the action is relayed in the form of a flashback from Verbal Kint's interrogation.
I:9065;848;Anyone who doubts Spacey's status as the finest actor in film today need only reference his role here as the complex Kint to become true believers.
I:9065;849;it would be a crime to reveal any more of the plot ir the astonishing climax, but suffice it to say that if you enjoy the way tightly.
I:9065;850;A film so in love with itself that it spirals consistently out of control to the point that it can't even keep up with itself, the final act .
I:9065;851;job that burned and frayed you for 90+ minutes without a happy ending.
I:9065;852;A great movie with a great cast of characters and actors.
I:9065;853;I mention both because the script provides us with a great story concerning a collection of rogues, and the actors truly make these rogues memorable.
I:9065;854;This film takes a crime drama and adds a twist.
I:9065;855;the work of Kevin Spacey in this movie is stellar.
I:9065;856;He shares a very wide acting range with the audience.
I:9065;857;Seeing his performance alone is worth the time to see the movie.
I:9065;858;i would highly recommend seeing this movie.
I:9065;859;He's too loved, too big of a name, and I quickly figured out that he must have some plan up his sleeve.
I:9065;860;A bit hard to follow but ending was good.
I:9065;861;Always worth watching this classic.
I:9065;862;One of Kevin Spacey's best roles.
I:9065;863;Kevin Spacey is such a great actor.
I:9065;864;If you like suspense, this is the movie for you.
I:9065;865;If you can get through the first part of the movie without falling asleep it gets fairly interesting and is worth watching.
I:9065;866;It is a must see film.
I:9065;867;Because this is a movie that you will want to see over and over again.
I:9065;868;One for you and one for your best friend.

I:9065;871;It appeals to the thief/criminal in all of us.
I:9065;872;Also, the cast is perfect.
I:9065;873;The film transcends its time and is a certain classic.
I:9065;874;Aside from its amazing conclusion, the film's music alone will make the viewer want to watch it again.
I:9065;875;"Also, Michaelmatician states that Kobayashi indeed works for DeDonde Inc. and is very real.2.342""We Will Learn To See The Michrotron."""
I:9065;876;Definitely one of those films that is better on re.
I:9065;877;Love everything about the movie.
I:9065;878;It will keep you guessing what will happen next up to the very end.
I:9065;879;Great acting and an intricate and interesting plot.
I:9065;880;One of Kevin Spacey's classic roles.
I:9065;881;It's definitely a must see suspense film.
I:9065;882;Excellent movie that warrants seeing many times.
I:9065;883;I recently noticed it to be very popular among critics and fans, so I became a fan and saw it at the store .
I:9065;884;When the end came it was a little cool but I was disappointed, because I felt that was the best and only good part.
I:9065;885;I really have to know how movies like this and The Godfather and Schindlers List got to be so loved by critics and movie fans.
I:9065;886;It kept me on the edge of my seat and oddly enough it STILL does.
I:9065;887;And the music is haunting and eerie.
I:9065;888;it adds to the movie, perfectly done.
I:9065;889;Kevin Spacey is without a doubt one of the finest actors EVER to grace the silver screen.
I:9065;890;His diversity in roles is just amazing.
I:9065;891;"The rest of the cast were wonderful as well
I:9065;892;the language is strong and there are a few graphic, violent scenes, but the film is absolutely amazing and should not be missed.
I:9065;893;"An intriguing story
I:9065;894;i love these movie it has great actors and was well done.
I:9065;895;i love the ending becouse it is a one of a kind ending
I:9065;896;One of those rare movies that you can watch 20 times and notice some critical detail during the 20th viewing that you missed in each of the first 19.
I:9065;897;the acting is as good as it gets.
I:9065;898;Dealing with criminals on a regular basis as I do (as a lawyer, not as one of them), I can assure you that the characters in this movie speak just like the real thing.
I:9065;899;as pointed out by other reviewers, this film contains a wealth of memorable lines.
I:9065;900;I guessed at who the mastermind was and he told me I was right.
I:9065;901;Kevin Spacey gives a great performance, maintaining a good.
I:9065;902;The plot is well designed and suspenseful right up until its surprising ending.
I:9065;903;Well written,well acted and well directed.
I:9065;904;It is a classic movie.
I:9065;905;A great cast, a great director, a great story .
I:9065;906;If you can figure out what the ending will be, you will do better than some of the stars.
I:9065;907;"There are clues that you will see on the second viewing for the first time, and other subtle ""things"" on the third."
I:9065;908;All I can say is .
I:9065;909;I can watch this more than once and each time it is entertaining.
I:9065;910;Everyone in this film had a good part.
I:9065;911;I'm still amazed at how good an actor Kevin Spacey is here.
I:9065;912;Fun that our 19 yr.
I:9065;913;The director's commentary was very informative and at times funny, but was just not enough.
I:9065;914;Few movies are as successful at keeping the viewer in suspense, and even fewer have such a fantastic cast.
I:9065;915;One of the best films in its genre.
I:9065;916;go into this film with absolutely NO knowledge of the plot, and if you must know some of the plot, only know the smallest portion of plot details.
I:9065;917;Knowing there is a surprise ending will take away from the rest of the film as you try to study the characters and plot lines.
I:9065;918;If you like the film, you'll love this.
I:9065;919;"Great suspense, great mystery
I:9065;920;Quite shocking its effect, that it offers originality to its genre.
I:9065;921;Singer's ingenious noir thriller takes a twisty, complicated plot about betrayal and recrimination and turns it into a dark fable about the things we fear most: what we can't see and don't understand.
I:9065;922;Spacey won an Oscar for his unnerving portrayal of Verbal Kint, a man at once physically vulnerable and intellectually devious, but the entire cast.
I:9065;923;byrne, Pollak, Baldwin, and a hilariously indecipherable Del Toro.
I:9065;924;bring their gallery of quirky deviants to vivid life.
I:9065;925;A mystery thriller that grabs you and holds on until the very end.
I:9065;926;You will want to watch it twice.
I:9065;927;But even that has been done before, and I can't remember anything really good or memorable about this film, other than the plot.
I:9065;928;But there is a difference between plot depth and real good plots, and smoke and mirrors.
I:9065;929;Part of the 'cult' appeal of this film, I'm fairly sure, lies in its trick ending.
I:9065;930;It's clever, but finally not clever enough.
I:9065;931;If you're going to take the best part of two hours to play an elaborate hoax, make sure the hoax is worth waiting for.
I:9065;932;"The Usual Suspects is one of those movies that simply makes you say ""wow."""
I:9065;933;we bought our tickets and headed into the auditorium.
I:9065;934;Little did I know that within the next two hours I would be witness to one of the finest pieces of moviemaking ever created.
I:9065;935;bryan Singer's wonderful direction and Chris McQuarrie's story are flawless.
I:9065;936;a finish and, like you've probably already heard, will make you want to see it again.
I:9065;937;The characters are memorable, with Benecio del Toro's and Steven Baldwin's roles really standing out.
I:9065;938;And Kevin Spacey, as in everything he does, is masterful.
I:9065;939;def transfer, and a whole truckload of stuff that fans of the movie .
I:9065;940;and film buffs in general .
I:9065;941;"A ""Special Edition"" was in order, and now, it's here."
I:9065;942;The Usual Suspects is a movie worthy of your time.
I:9065;943;This was his first Oscar winning role and he deserved it.
I:9065;944;The story is engrossing, and the climax terrific.
I:9065;945;My youngest daughter commented that she loved Kevin Spacey.
I:9065;946;This is without a doubt one of the best movies that I have ever seen.
I:9065;947;Christopher McQuarrie's Academy Award winning screenplay deserves a great deal of praise.
I:9065;948;This movie is well worth your money.
I:9065;949;Truly an amazing film, this movie is one of a kind.
I:9065;950;Great acting and a great script make this one of the best crime mystery ever!
I:9065;951;yep, its obvious 20 minutes into the movie what the denouement will be, but i found this so skillfully done i give it a top rating.
I:9065;952;just wildly fun to watch as a heist movie, a genre i always tend to enjoy.
I:9065;953;the entire cast, led of course by kevin spacey, seems to have enjoyed itself.
I:9065;954;It might have started off slow, but it sure got going and the ending is great.
I:9065;955;if u like a good mystery movie this is the one for u it has enough twists and turns to keep u interested to the finale 5 minutes.
I:9065;956;this is a great mystery movie that is not to be missed
I:9065;957;"The greatest trick the devil ever played was convincing the world he didn't exist, says con man Kint (Kevin Spacey), speaking of the ""heavy"" in the movie, Keyser Soze."
I:9065;958;whose identity is kept under wraps until the end of the film.
I:9065;959;Probably a lot of people will enjoy it.
I:9065;960;This looks just like the original 1955 film and stars many of Britain's best actors.
I:9065;961;It's an interesting contrast to the 1995 version (also excellent) that is set in a Fascist England of the 1930's and has a terrific preformance by Ian McKellen as Richard.
I:9065;962;The play itself is as easily understandable and likeable as it was in 1600.
I:9065;963;I love these blu ray books, they look fresh on my shelf and are filled with great info and trivia on the production of the movies, a film buffs dream.
I:9065;964;If you like this film, you'll love this edition.
I:9065;965;You will be surprised by what transpires from start to finish.
I:9065;966;This movie is by far one of the most enjoyable films ever made.
I:9065;967;on and then given little chance to breathe as Bryan Singer takes you deep into a story so rich with characters(the best part of the movie) and the acting genius that is Kevin Spacey.
I:9065;968;It's full of twists and turns that take the viewer on an amazing ride.
I:9065;969;If you have never seen it then give it a chance and I'm sure you will enjoy it.
I:9065;970;"Kevin Spacey gives one of the best of his always cool, always creepy performances
I:9065;971;"warping twists like this one
I:9065;972;A great movie for those of you who liked Pulp Fiction (the guy who played Zed even has a role!)
I:9065;973;worthy but better than the typical fare of the same genre.
I:9065;974;"The Usual Suspects belongs in a league with films like ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Out of Sight."""
I:9065;975;"Not just because all three films juggle with time, but because they're all smartly written, well acted crime capers that are usually overlooked as being ""great films"" (with the exception of ""Pulp Fiction"")."
I:9065;976;The Usual Suspects blends everything that makes a good crime film.
I:9065;977;It's well written, has some twists, is well acted, funny, and is rough around the edges.
I:9065;978;Pretty soon, the men are plotting jobs together.
I:9065;979;"This all leads to the brilliant climax that reveals what exactly a dying Hungarian man meant by the name ""Keyser Soze."""
I:9065;980;Spacey won his first Oscar for his role as Verbal Kint and he deserved it.
I:9065;981;For a man who never fails to turn in a winning performance, this is one of his best.
I:9065;982;The film also won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay.
I:9065;983;"The film is directed by Bryan Singer, better known as the director of the first two ""X. men"" movies and ""Superman Returns."""
I:9065;984;He's a director that doesn't get a lot of respect from critics or audiences (usually because he's dealing with beloved comic book characters), but with this film he proves that he is a talented director.
I:9065;985;"paced and very entertaining and when I said it was funny, I don't mean ""ha."
I:9065;986;The lineup scene is one of the funniest scenes I've ever seen.
I:9065;987;"All the performances are good
I:9065;988;"If you liked any of the movies I mentioned above or just enjoy smart crime films
I:9065;989;Not only does this film have some excellent casual moments of hilarity, some cooly executed violence, some great characters, but it has the finest twist I have EVER seen.
I:9065;990;writer Chris Mcquarie spins the twist perfectly and I don't know of anyone that guessed it.
I:9065;991;Mcquarie manages to wrap the whole film up, conclude with one twist, before pulling the carpet out from under us just as we thought it had finished.
I:9065;992;this film is a true calssic and among my top ten.
I:9065;993;I've seen it nearly ten times and the end still makes me smile.
I:9065;994;Usual suspects is his finest hour.
I:9065;995;Clearly, this truly is a great story of 5 crooks working together to unravel a mystery, and just stay out of jail.
I:9065;996;it is now selling for a lower price and is well worth it.
I:9065;997;I played it on my laptop .
I:9065;998;Overall great value and a treasured addition to the gangster section of my collection.
I:9065;999;although not packed with features, it is a solid value.
I:9065;1000;One of the best crime movie I have ever seen.
I:9065;1001;I received a message that said.
I:9065;1002;Full of suspense and great story line.
I:9065;1003;This movie brings out the detective in you.
I:9065;1004;Definitely is a must see!
I:9065;1005;This is the best Kevin Spacey movie yet.
I:9065;1006;This movie will keep you rivited.
I:9065;1007;It slows down a little in the middle, but it has the best ending of any movie yet.
I:9065;1008;the story is good, but you have to get through a lot of junk to get to it
I:9065;1009;The fact of the matter is that Bryan Singer and Christopher McQuarrie's USUAL SUSPECTS is one of the best films to come out of the studio system in the last ten years.
I:9065;1010;First time directors rarely do all that great with their first movie, but sometimes a director comes along that breaks the rules, and makes an incredible first film.
I:9065;1011;"Bryan Singer is just such a director, in recent years he's become well known among comic book fans as one of the best directors to bring their favorite heroes to life in a long time, this is because of his films ""X. men"", ""X2: X. men United"" and the recent release ""Superman Returns""."
I:9065;1012;Before Singer became known as the man that rejuvenated the comic book movie genre, he directed an incredibly taut, thriller with so many twists and turns that it still leaves audiences guessing to this day.
I:9065;1013;up and while in holding conspire together to pull off a one.
I:9065;1014;boasting an incredibly talented cast of actors, a twisted storyline that will leave you scratching your head as you struggle to understand everything you've just seen, and an excellent first.
I:9065;1015;time director who shocked Hollywood with this impressive thrill ride.
I:9065;1016;The Usual Suspects is most definitely one of those rare Hollywood gems that when it comes along you can't help but pay attention.
I:9065;1017;though the movie sometimes moves slow, though not very often, and these times serve as a nice breather from the mental games being played out in the film, I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for an enjoyable movie that is way more than simple eye candy, but will provoke you to think about what you're watching.
I:9065;1018;This is one of my favorites movies.
I:9065;1019;At the end of the film you'll realize that the performance of the actors is beyond what you were watching in the screen.
I:9065;1020;So, in my confusion, I was still sure based on the stellar performances, and the mere presence of Kevin Spacey, that this was a good movie, and I was just the idiot who gave up on it too fast.
I:9065;1021;Boy oh boy, is this a good movie.
I:9065;1022;It was a most enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours.
I:9065;1023;kevin Spacey really nailed his rather creepy, pivitol character and nicely held the threads of the movie together.
I:9065;1024;Wake up and smell the coffee cup!
I:9065;1025;It was probably a good movie if they could cut the swear words at least to a minimum.
I:9065;1026;This movie has everything, great actors, fine filming, and an 'unusual' story.
I:9065;1027;It is totally entertaining and actually makes you think.
I:9065;1028;One of the best movies of all time!
I:9065;1029;Saw this movie when it first came out.
I:9065;1030;Still fine acting and the suspense holds for most of the movie.
I:9065;1031;Fantastic storyline and acting with a great twist.
I:9065;1032;I received my order really fast.
I:9065;1033;So glad I bought this movie.
I:9065;1034;This is an incredible flick!!
I:9065;1035;The suspense, the acting, and the directing make this a MUST OWN.
I:9065;1036;Great cast with a fabulous plot.
I:9065;1037;You will be glued to the television from start to finish.
I:9065;1038;The ending is unexpected and classic.
I:9065;1039;I can honestly say that Kevin Spacey is the most talented actor in Hollywood today.
I:9065;1040;It is often classified as a modern film noir, but though it isn't the equal of great modern film noirs as CHINATOWN and L. a. CONFIDENTIAL, on its own terms it is a well.
I:9065;1041;made, entertainingly twisty little mystery.
I:9065;1042;It has good performances all around (Kevin Spacey won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for basically bringing a welcome wit and energy to a generic narrator role.
I:9065;1043;well, at least it seems generic for most of the movie), and Christopher McQuarrie's Oscar.
I:9065;1044;winning screenplay offers deliciously hardboiled dialogue and, especially, some genuinely startling plot twists.
I:9065;1045;with the final twist being the most shocking of all.
I:9065;1046;Personally, I was able to accept that controversial final twist a bit more easily than many others did.
I:9065;1047;it certainly made for great theater, if you know what I mean.
I:9065;1048;All in all, a very good, not great, thriller, but suspenseful and entertaining enough to be worth a viewing or two.
I:9065;1049;and I'm sure most people who watch it once will feel compelled to watch it again.
I:9065;1050;Love, Love LOVE this movie.
I:9065;1051;As exciting to watch for the tenth time as the first.
I:9065;1052;star cast, great action along with some comedy.
I:9065;1053;Since this movie revolves around its plot twists, all I can really say is that this movie is REALLY good, and definitely worth the watch.
I:9065;1054;This is more than a just a thriller.
I:9065;1055;you will spoil one of the most entertaining things about it: trying to figure it out.
I:9065;1056;If you enjoy the film, you'll probably want to watch it again, and you'll be irked that you didn't have an opportunity to put all the pieces together yourself before knowing the ending.
I:9065;1057;also, the film is doubly entertaining in that it's like one of those jackets that you can turn inside.
I:9065;1058;You sit down and watch it and get hit with its raw impact .
I:9065;1059;Otherwise, you'll be robbing yourself of some good fun .
I:9065;1060;a classic and definitely a must see .
I:9065;1061;Epic ending and action packed from beginning to end .
I:9065;1062;I love the acting and the how the story works out in the end!
I:9065;1063;It's dark but even more clever than it let's on!
I:9065;1064;Usual Suspects has become a cult classic not only for its trick ending but for the excellent performances given by each of the protagonists, if they can be called that.
I:9065;1065;One of the all time great movies!
I:9065;1066;I would highly recommend this movie as well as The Shawshank Redemption and the Lord of the Rings trilogy.
I:9065;1067;If you haven't ever seen The Usual Suspects, you're missing one of the best films of the past 20 years!
I:9065;1068;Entertaining with a twist ending that will leave you with a smile.
I:9065;1069;This film is definitely THE best of its kind.
I:9065;1070;Not only because it is a film with a unique story line, brilliant performances, great actors and super suspense, but because it is simply one of a kind!
I:9065;1071;A great movie that truly showcases Kevin Spacey's amazing skills as an actor!
I:9065;1072;Great movie that gets better each time you watch it!
I:9065;1073;I bought this movie for my husband.
I:9065;1074;It is a great movie.
I:9065;1075;Great acting and lots of twists and turns.
I:9065;1076;I especially liked Kevin Spacey's performance.
I:9065;1077;One of my good friends, after discovering I was a Spacey fan, insisted that I would love this movie.
I:9065;1078;As per usual, Kevin's brilliant.
I:9065;1079;This movie is full of plot twists and surprises you up to the very end.
I:9065;1080;This is definitely worth watching mor than once.
I:9065;1081;The thing that is so special about the fact that all of these well.
I:9065;1082;seasoned criminals are conned by a master.
I:9065;1083;Along that way the plot twists and turns, as good plots do.
I:9065;1084;"It's, ""The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist."
I:9065;1085;It gives the movie an element of realism.
I:9065;1086;realistic looks at that are important.
I:9065;1087;But rest assured (those of you who haven't seen it) that all will be explained by the time the credits roll.
I:9065;1088;"
I:9065;1089;I think this is a great movie, and the acting is simply first rate.
I:9065;1090;Kevin Pollak is outstanding, and Spacey is god.
I:9065;1091;It drags on a little to long, but other than that Kevin Spacey and Benicio Del Toro make the movie great.
I:9065;1092;This movie is one of the best with its plot twists and an ending that will have you standing up saying Oh my god!
I:9065;1093;A very good movie, but if you've heard that there's a surprise ending (which most of these reviews point out) you'd have to be an idiot to not know what it is 1/4 of the way through the movie.
I:9065;1094;A lot of movies with twist endings have no replay value.
I:9065;1095;With this movie, I always find something interesting that I hadn't noticed the previous viewing.
I:9065;1096;I first saw this movie when I was in College and it is the best movie.
I:9065;1097;One of the best movies of all time!
I:9065;1098;Great movie, characters, and storyline.
I:9065;1099;Twist at the end will knock you over!
I:9065;1100;The characters are grouped as criminals similar in their chosen professions, but each one is diverse.
I:9065;1101;If you're the type that foresees plots, or thinks you do, this one will be a challenge for you.
I:9065;1102;Like lots of Kevin Spacey movies this one has great writing and a really good story.
I:9065;1103;looking at it again even knowing the twists I still think they wee well done.
I:9065;1104;And I still enjoy the movie anyway.
I:9065;1105;As a crime drama, it's great.
I:9065;1106;As a suspense/thriller, it's classic.
I:9065;1107;Christopher McQuarrie's Academy Award winning, original screenplay, coupled with Bryan Singer's masterful direction of a stellar cast, makes for a complex and absorbing film.
I:9065;1108;"kevin Spacey won a 1995 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his low key, ingratiating portrayal of ""Verbal"" Kint."
I:9065;1109;Gabriel Byrne also gives a compelling performance as the cop who ended on the wrong side of the law.
I:9065;1110;The rest of the cast also give stellar performances, with the exception of Benicio Del Toro, who gives an odd, marble mouthed performance.
I:9065;1111;Notwithstanding this, the film is really a splendid tour de force that is sure to captivate the viewer.
I:9065;1112;Well crafted film with pristine transfer and original plot.
I:9065;1113;in the middle of the film, i thought i knew who keyser soze is.
I:9065;1114;the 5.1 Sound is admirable though the sound level has not been equalized.
I:9065;1115;This is probably one of the most intelligent films ever made, the story is slick, clever and keeps you thinking all the way through, never once in any other film have I seen such a glorious spectacle, this flm incorporates a crisp crime tale, exhilirating thrill sequences, unintended comedy and fantastic acting.
I:9065;1116;the 1995 film revolves around five criminals, who are set up on a police line.
I:9065;1117;You have to watch it yourself, it is owed a viewing or two, although I personally have seen it well over fifty times and I love it even more each time I see it.
I:9065;1118;Bryan Singer captures the action well and Kevin Spacey is brilliant as a more than he seems cripple, and quite deservedly was awarded the Best Supporting Actor at the 1995 oscars, and I think this film established him as a top class actor.
I:9065;1119;all you geezers out there you have got to watch this film!
I:9065;1120;I forgot how great this movie was.
I:9065;1121;Kevin Spacey truly is a master of his craft.
I:9065;1122;One of the most important ingredients to a good adventure story is a great villain.
I:9065;1123;Lord of the Rings has its marvelous villain, Sauron, and its fantastic secondary villains, the Ringwraiths.
I:9065;1124;The Usual Suspects has one of the finest villains I've ever come across in a movie, scary Keyser Soze.
I:9065;1125;I think it was a good touch to make him a Turk.
I:9065;1126;Nice choice for a westerner's fantasy of the most depraved villain on earth, a dangerous Young Turk .
I:9065;1127;I dwell on this because Keyser Soze, horrid murderer, is the appeal of the movie and what the whole plot and surprise ending are about.
I:9065;1128;I found the ending as satisfying as a walk.
I:9065;1129;When people ask for my favorite movie of all time, this is one of those that I mention.
I:9065;1130;Kevin Spacey received a well deserved oscar for his performance.
I:9065;1131;The plot was intriguing and kept me hooked till the last minute.
I:9065;1132;for all those who heard the ending, it is still worth viewing the movie simply for the brilliant manner in which the plot unfolds.
I:9065;1133;Now and then, someone asks you what your favorite movie of all time is.
I:9065;1134;it is one of those movies you enjoy more the second and third and fourth time around, always picking up things you missed before.
I:9065;1135;it has a great villain.
I:9065;1136;That is very important to a story.
I:9065;1137;Although the brief parts with violence were hard to watch, the movie was captivating and witty.
I:9065;1138;Good balance of humor and drama.
I:9065;1139;This is a who done it movie and it keeps you guessing right until the end.
I:9065;1140;I bought it as a gift this time.
I:9065;1141;It kept you on your toes, actors were very good, good movie to watch at homein your lounge chair.
I:9065;1142;But then this movies wraps itself around you and it really holds you in, shocking you over and over.
I:9065;1143;Besides the awesome ending, the performance by Kevin Spacey is brilliant!
I:9065;1144;I waited to get a copy at a good price and this answered that wait.
I:9065;1145;The Usual Suspects is an amazing, action.
I:9065;1146;packed psychological drama/thriller type movie that will definately leave you guessing till the end!
I:9065;1147;Amazing direction by Bryan Singer, great script with an OUTSTANDING ensemble cast including the amazingly talented Gabriel Byrne (the sexiest man alive), the brilliant Kevin Spacey and Kevin Pollack, possibly the most hilarious man alive.
I:9065;1148;All in all, this is a great, great cult classic for any movie freak.
I:9065;1149;It is so much better to watch the movie all the way through the first time, plot unknown, to watch how it unfolds.
I:9065;1150;That's what makes the film noir movies so great for watching and rewatching.
I:9065;1151;The first time you see it, you are caught up in how the mystery elements are linked together and unraveled.
I:9065;1152;In subsequent watchings, you know what the end game is, and you now enjoy all the clues and hints that are laid out for you along the way.
I:9065;1153;the beauty of The Usual Suspects is the stellar cast involved .
I:9065;1154;Every one of these actors does a fantastic job.
I:9065;1155;There are so many quotes, so many specific lines of dialogue, so many tiny eye movements and looks that just bring incredible depth to this story.
I:9065;1156;Go back and watch it again.
I:9065;1157;layered adventure and each time you take a look, something else unfolds for you.
I:9065;1158;It's something you see multiple times, share with family and friends, and then discuss afterwards.
I:9065;1159;This is a great movie and if you have never seen it do yourself a favor and don't look it up on the internet.
I:9065;1160;Don't even talk to anyone about it before you see it.
I:9065;1161;One of the best endings to a movie of all time.
I:9065;1162;A good night's entertainment with plenty of action and twists.
I:9065;1163;Excellent performances, especially about Kevin Spacey.
I:9065;1164;must watch love it you can't be a movie buff if you haven't seen this.
I:9065;1165;This movie is a work of art.
I:9065;1166;The kind of movie you can watch 3 times and still notice things that eluded you before.
I:9065;1167;I'm sure I've seen this movie at least a dozen times and I am always captivated by its intelligence and visual beauty.
I:9065;1168;Even if you know how it ends, getting there is always a trip.
I:9065;1169;not worth my time to watch, had to move on !
I:9065;1170;time criminals that get involved with a strange scheme I found hard to understand.
I:9065;1171;several crimes are committed successfully, leading up to one big hit for $91 million dollars.
I:9065;1172;The final thirty minutes make the Usual Suspects worth watching, strange yet fascinating surprise ending.
I:9065;1173;A great modern who done it mystery/.
I:9065;1174;It is a amazing film with a great build up and a really good ending it keeps you cluded to your seat all the way through the film.
I:9065;1175;The film is a must have as it is watchable at any time and will keep you entertained for a long time to come.
I:9065;1176;This is one of the best movies I have seen in a while.
I:9065;1177;Plot twists, interesting characters, and a great surprise ending combine to make this a really fascinating study.
I:9065;1178;The characters are interesting, and there is enough action to keep things going along at an exciting pace.
I:9065;1179;Chased by the cops, customs, and others, they realize that they may be in deeper than they anticipated, and start accelerating towards a suspenseful conclusion.
I:9065;1180;great performances from Spacey and Gabriel Byrne.
I:9065;1181;Plot twist amazing character line up awesome glued to the movie was not expecting that ending they way the movie was set up was geniuse
I:9065;1182;Something good to watch when there's nothing interesting.
I:9065;1183;what remains when the good stuff is gone.
I:9065;1184;"Yeah, you can hear the pitch now: ""it's more Reservoir Dogs than Reservoir Dogs is!"
I:9065;1185;The Usual Suspects makes the mistake most Hollywood studio flicks do: they confuse the elements of a successful movie with the movie itself.
I:9065;1186;The script is terrific, and the acting by the entire cast is also superb.
I:9065;1187;Overall, still a fine movie that has held up very well and that I suspect is destined to become a classic of the film noir and detective/crime genre.
I:9065;1188;In all a great movie and one I'd watch again.
I:9065;1189;I really like this movie and would recommend it to others.
I:9065;1190;Kevin Space is phenomenal and the rest of the cast incredible.
I:9065;1191;:) A must see!I love this one.
I:9065;1192;The story was very well written with plenty of plots and twists.
I:9065;1193;This is the sort of movie that holds up to repeated viewings.
I:9065;1194;A great script, great performances (especially by the wonderful Kevin Spacey), entertaining, spooky at times, and thought.
I:9065;1195;Typical of all really good films, it has a twist in the tail that a great white shark would be proud of.
I:9065;1196;Kevin Spacey and Gabriel Byrne are two of the best character actors in the business and Usual Suspects is some of their best work.
I:9065;1197;And watch your jaw drop at the end.
I:9065;1198;Kevin Spacey is an amazing actor.
I:9065;1199;I thought the cast worked well together.
I:9065;1200;I would definitely recommend to a friend.
I:9065;1201;There is a good twist at the end.
I:9065;1202;The Usual Suspects is pure movie entertainment.
I:9065;1203;A brilliant story with superb acting all around makes this a true pleasure to watch again and again.
I:9065;1204;But this movie is more about an intelligent script, tight directing and characters that are as real as you will ever experience in celluloid.
I:9065;1205;ball explosion in the opening scene, were remarkable *because* of the astonishing clarity.
I:9065;1206;After my wife and I finished the movie, we started it again to check out the director's and screenwriter's commentary soundtrack, and THAT was so interesting we watched nearly half of the movie again right then!
I:9065;1207;this is one film that holds up over multiple viewings.
I:9065;1208;The Usual Suspects is one of the great crime dramas of all time, and there's enough action to make it a wild ride.
I:9065;1209;So fasten your seat belt and settle in for Spacey's most epic performance !
I:9065;1210;enjoyed this film I would recommend this to a friend.
I:9065;1211;I liked all the actors in the film The plot was exciting
I:9065;1212;I loved this movie and have seen it 5 or 6 times.
I:9065;1213;it's intriguing, amusing, had me on the edge of my seat (even after seeing it so many times), and I loved the way Verbal kept the mystery going.
I:9065;1214;In my top 20 best movies now!
I:9065;1215;Great cast and entertaining story line.
I:9065;1216;But I shouldn't be too hard on it, all good ideas come from somewhere, the author of this screenplay, Christopher MacQuarrie, just got to it first is all.
I:9065;1217;Years after reading Foundation, I still feel a sense of wonder at its twists and clever manipulation.
I:9065;1218;Amazing, thats all i have to say.
I:9065;1219;This movie showcases a pretty solid pool of talent.
I:9065;1220;Spacey truly rises above the crowd in this movie.
I:9065;1221;"His performance is convincing (which it has to be for the movie to ""work"") and stirring."
I:9065;1222;this is an interesting story made up largely of mind games and betrayal.
I:9065;1223;Kevin Pollack's character is a Bad@ss who knows and executes his business well .
I:9065;1224;it is fascinating to watch it all unfold with Verbal Kint's (Kevin Spacey) retelling of the tale in Kujan's office at the precinct.
I:9065;1225;The scenes shared by Spacey and Palminteri in that office are among the best moments in the film.
I:9065;1226;This is well written and well done.
I:9065;1227;The story plot flowed very well.
I:9065;1228;It kind of represents today's society in that sometimes things are right in front of us and we missed it completely.
I:9065;1229;brian Singer has constructed a masterpiece, in which the punchline resides where it should, in the last shot!
I:9065;1230;This movie keeps you guessing, and I am finding it very hard to review without letting some of the better shocks slip!Baldwin, Spacey and Byrne play career roles in this movie, for which they will all be remembered.
I:9065;1231;The filming locations are very good, the musical score superb and the story, although slow burn, moves along at a perfect pace.
I:9065;1232;The use of flashback, which is a very hard tool to work with, is used to perfection, with the viewer becoming so engulfed in each scene, it is a genuine surprise when you are back with the key characters.
I:9065;1233;The Usual Suspects is an unbelievable film, full of intrigue, misdirection and suspense.
I:9065;1234;The casting is just fantastic and as always, Kevin Spacey (Best Supporting Actor as Verbal Kint) shines.
I:9065;1235;Keyser Sose knows the truth though.
I:9065;1236;the plot for this movie is one of the best I have ever witnessed.
I:9065;1237;Full of dark characters and twists, it is guaranteed to entertain and baffle.
I:9065;1238;It will surely withstand multiple viewings.
I:9065;1239;Consequently, its audience should extend a considerable degree of tolerance.
I:9065;1240;Absolutely one of my favorite movies of all time!
I:9065;1241;Excellent job by Kevin Spacey who won Best Supporting Actor for his role.
I:9065;1242;Very interesting from start to finish.
I:9065;1243;A superb film with famous catchy phrases.
I:9065;1244;Very well thought out and directed.
I:9065;1245;Great visuals and additions of scenes to make your imagination go wild.
I:9065;1246;One of the best if not the best endings to any film available.
I:9065;1247;The ultimate crime mystery there is, this movie is good on every level.
I:9065;1248;never have I watched such an intriguing movie.
I:9065;1249;this is hands down Kevin Spacey's best performance.
I:9065;1250;Him, along with Stephen Baldwin and Gabriel Byrne who also give extraordinary performances make this movie an all time classic as far as crime mysteries are concerned.
I:9065;1251;Superb acting and an even better story line.
I:9065;1252;If it has been spoiled, like it was for me, this is still an incredible movie.
I:9065;1253;The way that the movie is done is a worthy set up to one of the great twists in movie history.
I:9065;1254;this movie is an excellent crime thriller/drama where the viewer is trying to figure out what happened as well as everyone else in the film.
I:9065;1255;this story is told by the film's narrator, one of the men from the line up, after the events in the story take place to a cop trying to get the truth.
I:9065;1256;If you like intrigue, drama, great dialogue and some gratuitous violence then this is the movie for you.
I:9065;1257;A couple people at work told me that it was The Usual Suspects those movies were making fun of.
I:9065;1258;Now I know why all the movie critics and people still talk about this movie, even to this day.
I:9065;1259;So I finally understand the part with the coffee in Scary Movie and Wrongfully Accused.
I:9065;1260;I find those parts much funnier now.
I:9065;1261;Bryan Singer did a wonderful job on producing and directing this movie.
I:9065;1262;I thougt he did a great job directing X. men, so I was pretty sure The Usual Suspects would be good.
I:9065;1263;This movie is so clever and brillant, it's one of a kind.
I:9065;1264;Theres not a lot of movies out there like this, that keeps you guessing, and makes you want to watch the movie again and again.
I:9065;1265;Now if you want a slick, smart mystery movie, with the coolest ending of any movie ever, this is it.
I:9065;1266;In one sense the film is a traditional whodunit, but as the viewer gets deeper into the story, you not only begin to wonder who did it but what it actually was that he did, since the main story is being told by one of the criminals, and you are never quite sure if he is telling the truth.
I:9065;1267;The screenwriter obviously put a lot of thought into the story, as this is one of the smartest crime films I've ever seen, and it contains surprises for the viewer on a Shyamalanesque scale.
I:9065;1268;It's a joy to watch filmmaking of this caliber, and now I know why the X. men series has done so well in Singer's capable hands.
I:9065;1269;Loved it loved the ending!
I:9065;1270;If you love Kevin Spacey you will love this movie.
I:9065;1271;If you haven't seen this movie yet you should absolutely definitely watch it because it is a classic and wonderful!
I:9065;1272;The ending is such a surprise.
I:9065;1273;I've actually watched this several times, to date, and it always seems new.
I:9065;1274;This movie is what made me a huge fan of Kevin Spacey!
I:9065;1275;Intelligent, well written, exciting and full of unexpected twists and turns!!!
I:9065;1276;This is a thriller with a twist.
I:9065;1277;I've always liked movies that leave you in the dark until the last possible moment and this movie is a prime example.
I:9065;1278;kevin Spacey stars in this deceptive film about five high.
I:9065;1279;It really makes you realize how smart and shady the filmmakers are in the sense that they show you that the audiences' expectations can really be used against them.
I:9065;1280;Bryan Singer's The Usual Suspects is a breathtaking crime thriller that exceeded all expectations after its 1995 release and to me represents the zenith of filmmaking.
I:9065;1281;Singer himself creates the story using complicated and beautiful shots and an uncompromising vision.
I:9065;1282;This man knows what he wants.
I:9065;1283;And this is to bring Christopher McQuarrie's script to life.
I:9065;1284;It is quite simply sheer brilliance.
I:9065;1285;Kevin Spacey's performance, though, is the key to the movie's success.
I:9065;1286;His performance is simply amazing in its difficulty and aim.
I:9065;1287;Great supporting roles by Gabriel Byrne and Benicio Del Toro (with one of the funniest movie accents of all time).
I:9065;1288;It had managed to capture me and fascinate me in a manner few others have.
I:9065;1289;Wow is all I can say.
I:9065;1290;Ever since this film came out friends have told me to watch it.
I:9065;1291;Still trying to wrap our minds around what we watched.
I:9065;1292;It draws you in slowly andthrough out the film you think you know where it's going.
I:9065;1293;And 24 hours later your mind is still untangling all that it thought it saw.
I:9065;1294;Who is Keyser Soze?Christopher McQuarrie won a well.
I:9065;1295;deserved Best Original Screenplay Oscar for this stylish, mesmerizing gangster thriller, which demands multiple viewings.
I:9065;1296;feared, legendary master criminal who each has unknowingly wronged.
I:9065;1297;this 1995 release has one of the most memorable surprise endings in movie history.
I:9065;1298;great mystery thriller and a lot of action.
I:9065;1299;pure genius from start to a brillantly done finish.
I:9065;1300;the cast are great, especially Spacey.
I:9065;1301;THE USUAL SUSPECTS is an unusual, well.
I:9065;1302;crafted, if ultimately mystifying movie.
I:9065;1303;Kevin Spacey won his first Oscar for his supporting role as the narrative force behind the drama.
I:9065;1304;There are some interesting twists throughout the movie, and of course, the final one is a doozie, although if you watch the film closely, you can see it coming.
I:9065;1305;the identity of Kayser Solce is key to the film, and it's revelation forms the big surprise at the end.
I:9065;1306;I rarely enjoy a movie this much.
I:9065;1307;Movie that you will want to watch multiple times.
I:9065;1308;Great acting and a great story.
I:9065;1309;granted, this movie has a very clever ending.
I:9065;1310;I can watch this movie over an over despite knowing the ending and twists.
I:9065;1311;Great film, well written, acted, and scored.
I:9065;1312;great acting, a great plot and an extra something special that sets this film apart from the others.
I:9065;1313;Easily, this movie could have become a lame copy of Reservoir Dogs , but instead we are treated to some stunning performances on the part of Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Pollock, Stephen Baldwin, Chazz Palminteri, and.
I:9065;1314;The one most suspenseful question in this film.
I:9065;1315;This is probably one of the best films ever with an ending that will leave you breathless.
I:9065;1316;Great characters and a intricate plot captivates right up the the stunning end.
I:9065;1317;This is an outstanding movie.
I:9065;1318;The cast was well chosen and are fantastic in their roles.
I:9065;1319;The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist.
I:9065;1320;This movie is a well made and smartly written film, its just perhaps a bit less dynamic than it could have been.
I:9065;1321;Al great performances across the board.
I:9065;1322;This movie was an awesome look at what film needs to get back to.
I:9065;1323;The film has quick smart dialogue.
I:9065;1324;Good cinematography and a ending that few others can match.
I:9065;1325;My favorite movie is Fight Club, but I will definitely put Usual Suspects at a close second.
I:9065;1326;Way of the Gun is also an awesome Mcquarrie film
I:9065;1327;Serpentine mystery that will keep you guessing until the very end.
I:9065;1328;Outstanding cast, script, and direction.
I:9065;1329;One of the finest motion pictures I've ever seen.
I:9065;1330;I love the way this story comes together.
I:9065;1331;Twists and turns in the story make it truly entertaining.
I:9065;1332;The whole movie drew me in with the masterful acting by Byrne, Del Toro, and (sorry American Beauty fans) the performance of Spacey's career that won him his first oscar.
I:9065;1333;it continued along, foggy enough to keep me guessing, but intriguing enough to be brilliant.
I:9065;1334;The end of this movie (I wouldn't dare give it away) is the single finest cinematic moment ever.
I:9065;1335;Each time engenders a new appreciation for Brian Singer's masterful directing and the accross the board good acting.
I:9065;1336;One of the two best movies of the Nineties (along with Schindler's List)as alwaysP milo
I:9065;1337;It's one of those movies that you definitely put on pause to discuss a point with friends or since you don't want to miss anything, before you go to the fridge.
I:9065;1338;The acting is excellent with Kevin earning his supporting actor Oscar hands down.
I:9065;1339;For first time viewers you will never guess the ending and for those of us who have seen it time and again it's always a nice addition for when you are entertaining friends and families because no one will be able to stop talking about it for hours afterwards.
I:9065;1340;The Usual Suspects is perfectly watchable, but far from great.
I:9065;1341;Gabrile Bryne was excellent in this movie though, as was Stephen Baldwin.
I:9065;1342;survives at the end and tells his tale of a super bad guy who engineered all of it.
I:9065;1343;important and not clever enough by half (much in the way that The Da Vinci Code is not clever enough, to use a recent analogy!)
I:9065;1344;The only redeeming factors are an engaging cast and a quick (if rambling and somewhat pointless) plot.
I:9065;1345;crafted movie with a big surprise at the end, watch The Sixth Sense .
I:9065;1346;If you want a clever movie that makes you work to put everything together, watch Memento .
I:9065;1347;a film that baffles the viewer and leaves the audience 'guessing' until the end.
I:9065;1348;In the effort to appeal to the movie.
I:9065;1349;This is a great movie with a great plot and ending.
I:9065;1350;The five men are thrust into a world of danger and mystery as they work together to discover the true identity of Keiser Sose.
I:9065;1351;"bryan Singer's ""The Usual Suspects"" is one of the best films ever made in my opinion."
I:9065;1352;The thing that impresses me the most about The Usual Suspects, is that the acting and overall storytelling of the film are so well done, that each viewing provides for a rewarding experience despite the fact that I know how it will end.
I:9065;1353;It is set up in the format of an interrogation between one of the five men and a U. s. customs agent, giving us flashbacks on the events that led up to that moment in time.
I:9065;1354;The whole film will keep you guessing from one minute to the next, and it culminates in of the greatest endings of all time.
I:9065;1355;The film does a great job at making Sose look like the most imposing and frightening criminal ever, and the fact that his true identity has been kept a secret, only makes the character that much more appealing.
I:9065;1356;another thing to point out about this film, is that The Usual Suspects probably has one of the best ensemble casts I have ever seen.
I:9065;1357;The five men that the story focuses on are played by five very skilled actors.
I:9065;1358;Keaton is a character that has two sides to his personality.
I:9065;1359;But on the other hand, he gains respect from the men he works with for the code of honor that he lives by which makes him likeable at times.
I:9065;1360;Gabriel Byrne places both sides brilliantly.
I:9065;1361;Spacey does a great job on both ends, and is also very convincing as a cripple.
I:9065;1362;He also has great on screen chemistry with Chaz Palmentari who plays customs agent David Kullan that interrogates Verbal.
I:9065;1363;He was outstanding, because of his relentless nature.
I:9065;1364;The rest of the cast includes Benecio Del Toro in one of his best roles ever, Stephen Baldwin, and Kevin Pollack.
I:9065;1365;this highly entertaining and suspenseful mystery, will become an instant favorite of yours.
I:9065;1366;Christopher McQuarrie's amazing script and Singer's trademark style of directing, really make this film a masterpiece.
I:9065;1367;Within it's intricate plot and dialogue, this movie has you reeling from the beginning to end.
I:9065;1368;And, as the saying goes, Life mimics art.
I:9065;1369;In this movie it does so by having you thinking about how simple it all is.
I:9065;1370;duper action fan and this is such a well made film!!
I:9065;1371;If you like action and down dirty acting, you'll LOVE this film!
I:9065;1372;I watched it once, and I have loved it from that day to this.
I:9065;1373;The cast is incredible, the story is twisted and interesting, and to top it all off, it's very, very funny.
I:9065;1374;It is really one of the best kept secrets in the video world.
I:9065;1375;Great screenwriter, great actors and great dialogue.
I:9065;1376;Even Baldwin did an impressive job in this movie.
I:9065;1377;I'd rather see a very entertaining movie with a stinky ending, than a boring movie with a cool ending, any day.
I:9065;1378;A cult movie is a movie with a very high repeatability factor.
I:9065;1379;Maybe just to see the Jaguar at the end, love that car.
I:9065;1380;Great acting across the board, a little bit of coarse language and humor, and some of the best character writing I've seen in a long time.
I:9065;1381;definitely in my top ten of ridiculously awesome movies.
I:9065;1382;it was a gift to one of my relatives n he loved it.
I:9065;1383;he especially liked that it was special edition
I:9065;1384;a terrific movie that you will love or hate, but will enjoy discussing in either case.
I:9065;1385;And the twist will make you think :D
I:9065;1386;Five star for one of the best movies I have seen (again).
I:9065;1387;Loved the story, cast, direction, and plot.
I:9065;1388;Recommend it for all ages and audiences.
I:9065;1389;notch thriller with an ending that you'll never expect.
I:9065;1390;fine acting by Spacey, Byrne, and Singer, etc. clever plot twists.
I:9065;1391;and all the fun of a good movie.
I:9065;1392;I have watched this movie several times and it is still as good as the first time.
I:9065;1393;Kevin Spacey takes the role of verbal painting a perfect changing picture.
I:9065;1394;Director Bryan Singer is a great visionary.
I:9065;1395;His ability to translate ideas to film is astounding.
I:9065;1396;the best part of the Special Edition is Special Features.
I:9065;1397;Before entering the special features section I recommend watching the movie two or three times.
I:9065;1398;Sometimes you get a film which people say is great because it has a wonderful car chase or there is a nice big explosion or the main character gets to say some wonderful one.
I:9065;1399;this caught my attention so I went to see it and have watched it many times since.
I:9065;1400;I understood the film but I just loved the experience of watching a brilliant story unfold so mcuh that I wanted that experience again and again.
I:9065;1401;if you like to watch a good film that is far more than car chases, explosions and witty one.
I:9065;1402;A powerful underworld lord who may or may not exist.
I:9065;1403;The only extra is a commentary track which gives a nice insight into the making of the film.
I:9065;1404;i loved Kevin Spacey and Chazz P as they walk us thru the entire story.
I:9065;1405;The entire movie is non.
I:9065;1406;Between all the bomb explosions, interigation scenes, and intense situations lies a great plot.
I:9065;1407;The point where this goes from being a four star action film to one of the best movies i have ever seen.
I:9065;1408;If you don't know what I'm talking about then you must see this film.
I:9065;1409;Great movie, goes into must see classics category.
I:9065;1410;Good story line and twists.
I:9065;1411;Would recommend to those who like crime/murder/suspense.
I:9065;1412;I love the movies that are interesting to watch.
I:9065;1413;Here is one of the best suspense movies I have ever seen.
I:9065;1414;But even if you have seen it, it is worthy of film study on every level of production.
I:9065;1415;but there is so much more involved.
I:9065;1416;lots of twists was worth the time, and as usual Kevin spacy did a great job.
I:9065;1417;Wikipedia has the best write up that I have seen so far.
I:9065;1418;This great story follows Roger Verbal Kint, played by Kevin Spacey, as he narrates a very twisted mystery whodunit and suspenseful action thriller.
I:9065;1419;The author Christopher McQuarrie won an Academy Award for Best Writing (Original Screen Play) and Spacey won for best supporting actor.
I:9065;1420;A must see film .
I:9065;1421;can see why it is his favorite.
I:9065;1422;Excellent plot and worth viewing several times to catch it all.
I:9065;1423;The Usual Suspects is a great thriller.
I:9065;1424;It keeps you on the edge of your seat, wondering what will happen next.
I:9065;1425;If you have no idea about this movies plot or twists, watch is ASAP and enjoy!
I:9065;1426;Great movie, but not for children.
I:9065;1427;It has a lot of language.
I:9065;1428;I thought the movie was very good.
I:9065;1429;The story was really interesting, and the acting was well done.
I:9065;1430;I decided to give this a try and I was very impressed, I thought it was totally worth it and I felt the whole experience was made better by it.
I:9065;1431;It all feels like it's just a nice trip to the movies, thanks to exceptional acting (with Kevin Spacey winning the Best Supporting Actor Oscar) and a script that's smooth as buttah.
I:9065;1432;In the last 5 minutes of the film, you feel good, thinking that you've figured everything out now.
I:9065;1433;Then, the bombshell drops, and brother, it's a good one.
I:9065;1434;Any movie that twists a moviegoer's perceptions to the point that they play by the director's and writer's rules is a good one.
I:9065;1435;By blinding the unknowing viewer to what's happening, the ending is set up beautifully.
I:9065;1436;If you actually enjoy thinking, this movie's for you.
I:9065;1437;The Usual Suspects is one of those movies that you have to see atleast twice.
I:9065;1438;A lot of information is packed into this movie and everytime you watch it, you notice something new making the viewing experience great.
I:9065;1439;One of the best peices of cinema to ever grace the silver screen.
I:9065;1440;Yes b'y, dat's right, 5 friggin stars.
I:9065;1441;D'actin is friggin great even doh one of dem dere Baldwins is in it.
I:9065;1442;well da endin spun me right round and I landin on me arse.
I:9065;1443;Dint mind doh, cause da movie's so friggin good!
I:9065;1444;"Radder watch dis movie den fish
I:9065;1445;This movie had me hooked from the beginning, the script knows how to balance drama with comedy and even has a pretty dam good cast.
I:9065;1446;This film delivers on cast,writing,and even special effects.
I:9065;1447;This movie also does a great job of explaining each character and their motivations for doing what it is they do.
I:9065;1448;Probably the best crime movie of the 90's (not sure if goodfella's counts as the 90's).
I:9065;1449;Very engrossing story with an amazing ending.
I:9065;1450;Smart, edgy, a movie that will always stand apart on its own.
I:9065;1451;This movie is a great edition to anybody's collection.
I:9065;1452;Every now and again a film comes along that is described as a gem.
I:9065;1453;This is because the film just like a gem is a surprising pleasure to find esecially amongst the mass expanse and typical rubble of moviedom.
I:9065;1454;is just such a gem!The film is described as a classic by all who have seen it even though it was released as recently as 1995.
I:9065;1455;if you are going to see the film for the first time, you will notice that when you ask for the film at your local video store, a smile will mould itself onto the owner's face.
I:9065;1456;Why?Because he knows just as everyone else who has seen the film that you are letting yourself in for something special.
I:9065;1457;and, I guarantee you that the next time you go into your local video store and catch a glimpse of the now 'oh.
I:9065;1458;assured individual stands out from a crowd.
I:9065;1459;I hope you enjoy the film again and have fun trying to answer the immortal question:WHO IS KEYSER SOZE?
I:9065;1460;Bryan Singer was a young director during the filming of The Usual Suspects, and he was working with some of the biggest egos and some of the most talented dramatic and character actors of the day.
I:9065;1461;Watch the extra features content and you'll see why the combination was so trying for Singer and how one of the best scenes in the film wasn't purposely filmed but pieced together from the few moments when the cast stopped acting like children.
I:9065;1462;"fictional level
I:9065;1463;Somehow, the film gets away with telling more often than showing the audience the story.
I:9065;1464;Since information and misinformation are both mixed and hidden in the film, the viewer experiences the rare treat of actual surprise at the film's conclusion.
I:9065;1465;This is one of those films that, after you have seen it a few times, you feel proud to show it to someone who's never seen it or heard about it.
I:9065;1466;This is a must for any personal film library.
I:9065;1467;Even after watching it so many times, it's still one of my all time favorite movies!
I:9065;1468;If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favorite and watch it!!
I:9065;1469;brilliant direction,Brilliant performance,Brilliant script,Brilliant shooting composition.
I:9065;1470;"The movie is still excellent
I:9065;1471;I am not a fan of Stephen Baldwin and it is mainly through the acting of the other principles that this movie carries 4 stars, especially Kevin Spacey.
I:9065;1472;This is a movie that gets you to think and watch it again.
I:9065;1473;I actually quoted a line from the movie in a casual conversation (I do not want to spoil the plot ending) about Kaiser Sosze and got a good laugh.
I:9065;1474;after the first few twists, I decided to really pay attention and STILL they got me!Very enjoyable.
I:9065;1475;"This film is great
I:9065;1476;The greatest trick the devil ever played was convincing the world he did not exist.
I:9065;1477;Better than ALL the surprise ending movies you will ever watch.
I:9065;1478;But there is so much to the story.
I:9065;1479;Good script acting by all.
I:9065;1480;Will call it a classic!
I:9065;1481;First of all the movie is cool.
I:9065;1482;It has a great story line plus it is simple.
I:9065;1483;The two draw backs to this movie might be the actor Steven Baldwin, but still he held is own.
I:9065;1484;Loved the cast, loved the humor, loved the surprise ending!
I:9065;1485;Kevin Spacey did a superb job as always.
I:9065;1486;I'd give it 6 stars if I could.
I:9065;1487;I just love how it ends.
I:9065;1488;This movie is full of suspense, totally refreshing, edge of your seat, trying to figure it out all the way till the end!!!
I:9065;1489;Great acting, wonderful supporting actors, excellently told story.
I:9065;1490;Suspects combines a great cast, an intricate story (don't find too many of those these days), and outstanding directing.
I:9065;1491;Give me the keys .
I:9065;1492;I'll stop here, but the whole cast is great.
I:9065;1493;the beauty of this movie is how the story develops and leads your little brain into believing the events, names and characters that populate it.
I:9065;1494;"And when the puzzle finally seems to come together and you think you are so cool for having ""known it all along"" and satisfied to have watched a great movie, director Bryan Singer and writer Chris McQuarrie tear the puzzle apart like your mean older brother would do only to leave you with a thousand pieces that could come together in a completely other way."
I:9065;1495;You'll be continually amazed and entertained.
I:9065;1496;I was talking to someone recently about the most definitive movie of each decade.
I:9065;1497;One of the great movies of all time must watch several times to really get it.
I:9065;1498;Acting and direction and a fresh script turns this story filled w/ anti heroes into a must see.
I:9065;1499;The Usual Suspects is an twisting, turning thrill ride into the dark underworld of hardcore criminals.
I:9065;1500;This movies characters are unparalleled.
I:9065;1501;There is Fenster and Mcmanus who are longtime partners and top notch entry men.
I:9065;1502;The most interesting and prominent character is Verbal Kint.
I:9065;1503;They are an explosive group of hardcore criminals, who if the payoff is right will go into battle.
I:9065;1504;Verbal tells this dark yet enthralling story to Dave Kujan.
I:9065;1505;dave Kujan recruits Verbal to talk to him about his experiences with Keaton and the story of this mans experiences draw the viewer closer and closer to the movies central question and ultimately it's unsolved mystery.
I:9065;1506;Kevin Spacey is one of the greatest actors alive and this is the proof.
I:9065;1507;Kaiser Soyze is a legend, the ending contributes to that theme, making the story told in the movie a legend of it's own.
I:9065;1508;Bryan Singer did an excellent job putting the pieces together, he definitely had the cast to pull it off.
I:9065;1509;My highest recommendation to anyone looking to twist their minds a bit.
I:9065;1510;A super slick thriller witch kept me on the edge of my seat for the total running time.
I:9065;1511;The actors are absolutely excellent in this film, especially Spacey, who gives out one of his best bad guy roles since his other classic, Seven.
I:9065;1512;The movie takes you through twists and turns all the way, with a stunning montage wich makes all the rest make perfect sense.
I:9065;1513;even though Spacey delivers a bravura performance (more than worthy of his Oscar), the script itself seems to trip over its own feet at the end.
I:9065;1514;up, and giving them the ability to do this just because they're really good at what they do.
I:9065;1515;but because it had an original idea, it was destined for classic status.
I:9065;1516;It is one of the best movies of all time and has the most shocking ending I have ever seen.
I:9065;1517;See this movie and you will never regret it.
I:9065;1518;I really enjoy movies like this.
I:9065;1519;The whole movie keeps you on the edge of your seat and I can't wait to watch it again.
I:9065;1520;The Usual Suspects has been one of my favorite movies.
I:9065;1521;The performances are excellent, the plot fiendishly clever, and the direction sharp.
I:9065;1522;"lit scenes
I:9065;1523;I am surprised that a movie so beloved by film buffs could be given such poor treatment.
I:9065;1524;I got a credit, I think.
I:9065;1525;Just amazing story telling and drama played out by excellent actors.
I:9065;1526;the twist at the end is hard to predict on your own and it forces you to watch it again for the clues.
I:9065;1527;worth a watch every few years just to remind yourself how awesome this movie remains.
I:9065;1528;Was looking to spend a few bucks on a new blu ray, saw this and bought it on a whim, very speedy delivery and great film
I:9065;1529;Skillful direction, screenplay, camera angles, acting.
I:9065;1530;Fine acting, moved along at a fast but confusing pace.
I:9065;1531;law have said, this must rank among the best movies of the 1990s, if not of all time.
I:9065;1532;perfect sound, but because you can set the audio track to suppress the dialogue and instead play running commentary director Brian Singer and writer Christopher McQuarrie.
I:9065;1533;If you love the film, you'll love hearing about how it was made.
I:9065;1534;The Usual Suspects works as a film on many levels.
I:9065;1535;If viewed as an entertaining film then it does its job very well.
I:9065;1536;The script is masterfully crafted and the ongoing voice over is an excellent addition.
I:9065;1537;The main interest of the film comes in the form of the arch.
I:9065;1538;With excellent music and equally absorbing performances, the film remains as a testament to a good story far out.
I:9065;1539;Overall then it is a thoroughly recommended film that deserves its cult status.
I:9065;1540;Even though I know the story, it was still great to watch.
I:9065;1541;Kevin Spacey is fantastic as usual.
I:9065;1542;Really entertaining and very enjoyable with lots of violence.
I:9065;1543;Lead is well played and the end comes as a bit of a surprise.
I:9065;1544;kevin Spacey, Kevin Pollak, Chazz Palminteri, Pete Postlethwaite, Stephen Baldwin, Garbriel Byrne, and others, along with a brilliantly written screenplay, make The Usual Suspects one of the best thrillers and most unpredictable films of all time.
I:9065;1545;This is a twist on the WhoDunIt plot with powerful performances by everyone but Spacey in particular.
I:9065;1546;I love this movie and watch it over and over even though I know the plot and the ending.
I:9065;1547;One of the greatest casts ever assembled.
I:9065;1548;Bryan Singer's The Usual Suspects is a brilliantly crafted thriller that leads the viewer through a roller coaster ride of twists and plot turns.
I:9065;1549;The film marked the breakout of Kevin Spacey and helped him become a big star and win the first of his two Oscars.
I:9065;1550;The cast is full of superb actors including Gabriel Byrne, Benecio Del Toro, Kevin Pollack, Pete Postelwaithe, Chazz Palminteri, Giancarlo Espinosa and elicits a strong performance from the normally cringe inducing Stephen Baldwin.
I:9065;1551;Throughout the story, the name of the mysterious Keyser Soze comes up and it is the identity of Mr. Soze that adds suspense and intrigue to the plot.
I:9065;1552;The ending is a true surprise and you really don't see coming even the clues are there all along.
I:9065;1553;The Usual Suspects will keep you on the edge of your seat.
I:9065;1554;One of the best movies for the era, suspense and mystery roled into a Hitchcock style movie.
I:9065;1555;Entertaining film, but not as good watching it the 2nd, 3rd, 4th time.
I:9065;1556;Unlike most suspense thrillers,'Usual Suspects' remains interesting even after multiple viewings.
I:9065;1557;its true force comes from the acting by the main leads and the narrative technique followed by Bryan Singer.
I:9065;1558;And it's pretty cerebral at that.
I:9065;1559;one of the pleasures of this move is that it makes you care about some of the main characters.
I:9065;1560;You wonder what kind of a life Verbal leads in private.
I:9065;1561;it is a movie for intelligent people and I bought it because at the end your are going to be saying WHHAAAAAATTT!!
I:9065;1562;If you one see it one time you are seeing a magic trick.
I:9065;1563;After I saw it I bought it immediately and I have an outstanding memory.
I:9065;1564;I am a voracious reader and love all the major mystery writers.
I:9065;1565;i hate what they have done with James Patterson mysteries.
I:9065;1566;4.5 stars'The Usual Suspects' is a film I have heard about, and I finally got to view it.
I:9065;1567;It will take you awhile to realize that this is really the beginning of the film.
I:9065;1568;Keeping up is the name of the game, and by the last give minutes the gig is up.
I:9065;1569;Kevin Spacey was terrific we thought and the revelation at the end was awesome.
I:9065;1570;Still, a great time at the movies.
I:9065;1571;I really loved this roller coaster movie!
I:9065;1572;This is without a doubt the best film noir film released in the past two decades!
I:9065;1573;The story unfolds at a very deliberate intoxicating pace, and the characters are all so believable, even though some of them may or may not be fictional to suit what may or may not be fictional accounts of certain events in the film.
I:9065;1574;force performances in this stunning crime.
I:9065;1575;"caper film noir masterpiece from the director of the ""X. men"" trilogy (which I've yet to see), and ""Apt Pupil"", a classic film based on the Stephen King novella."
I:9065;1576;and, that is how great film noir is supposed to work.
I:9065;1577;I know that I am glad to own this modern day masterpiece.
I:9065;1578;see classic film with twists and turns that will keep you guessing until the end.
I:9065;1579;The acting by the entire cast is outstanding, and Kevin Spacey, Gabriel Byrne and the departed Pete Postlethwaite do an especially fine job.
I:9065;1580;I loved this movie when it first came out and had been hoping to find it on my netflix for streaming they however didn't come through but amazon streaming did.
I:9065;1581;thanks Amazon for having great movies to stream at a reasonable price.
I:9065;1582;This is without a doubt the best film noir film released in the past two decades!
I:9065;1583;the story unfolds at a very deliberate intoxicating pace, and the characters are all so believable, even though some of them may or may not be fictional to suit what may or may not be fictional accounts of certain events in the film.
I:9065;1584;force performances in this stunning crime.
I:9065;1585;"caper film noir masterpiece from the director of the ""X. men"" trilogy (which I've yet to see), and ""Apt Pupil"", a classic film based on the Stephen King novella."
I:9065;1586;"Another awesome performance by Kevin Spacey is in the Clint Eastwood film classic ""Midnight In the Garden of Good and Evil""."
I:9065;1587;and, the film is SO unique!
I:9065;1588;and, that is how great film noir is supposed to work.
I:9065;1589;I know that I am glad to own this modern day masterpiece.
I:9065;1590;One of the best movies I have ever seen.
I:9065;1591;The ending is worth the price of the movie.
I:9065;1592;Great cast to show the story and an excellent idea for a film.
I:9065;1593;I would recommend this movie to all my friends and anyone interested in watching a great film.
I:9065;1594;Just when you think you have things figured out there is a twist.
I:9065;1595;Find another film to hold your interest.
I:9065;1596;The plot of this movie is amazing!
I:9065;1597;It is an intelligent thriller that keeps you guessing even after the ending.
I:9065;1598;Gabriel Byrne is at his usual best, but Kevin Spacey is unbelieveablely good.
I:9065;1599;I guess that is why he won an Oscar for his performance in this movie.
I:9065;1600;Oh by the way, it does have some great action sequences.
I:9065;1601;I have seen this pic so many times and everytime I find something new.
I:9065;1602;Watch it, you'll like it too.
I:9065;1603;Great story, twist, and cinematography.
I:9065;1604;I highly recommend watching 2.5 times.
I:9065;1605;Great actors, the plot couldn't thicken more and amazing ending.
I:9065;1606;The best trick the devil ever played was convincing the world he didn't exist
I:9065;1607;Great casting and outstanding performance by Kevin Spacey (Best Supporting Actor).
I:9065;1608;This film has been a the forefront of all singerstyle movies to be released since.
I:9065;1609;The movie displays the most extravagent style of thinking since zombies live that i have seen in years.
I:9065;1610;Once the story unfolds you will understand why singer is and all ways will be the king of the thinking mans suspence.
I:9065;1611;I'd recommend this movie to anyone who likes mysteries or crime thrillers, or anyone who simply likes excellent movie plots and good acting.
I:9065;1612;I give it five stars because, despite the plot twists it is still great to watch.
I:9065;1613;A great movie for all time.
I:9065;1614;An oscar level performance by Kevin Spacey.
I:9065;1615;Another great performance from the Crossing Delancy star Gabriel Byrne.
I:9065;1616;and the best twist surprise ending on film in many critics opinions.
I:9065;1617;Like my brother always says, a movie needs a strong protagonist and a strong antagonist to be interesting.
I:9065;1618;It had a great mystery and suspense in it and it has to be the most underrated movie ever.
I:9065;1619;This was a very interesting story right from the word go.
I:9065;1620;But for this reason alone I had to give it a 4 star.
I:9065;1621;Still like I say it was pretty tame in this department and stood very well on the story alone, and when there was this aspect it fit and wasn't gratuitous.
I:9065;1622;that said I found this a gripping yarn that was intreaguing and interesting the entire show.
I:9065;1623;"But the ending and the ""opening of the eyes"" was pretty kool."
I:9065;1624;Kevin Spacey did a great job with his role, it was a lot like his role in Seven.
I:9065;1625;Kind of the relaxed sociopath with sarcastic humor.
I:9065;1626;Excellent acting on everyone's part, particularly Kevin Spacey.
I:9065;1627;"Good script too, with insinuating dialog: ""The greatest trick the devil ever performed was convincing the world that he didn't exist."""
I:9065;1628;I woke up in time to see the unexpected ending, a literal jaw.
I:9065;1629;If you like complex, action filled films with a mystery element that keeps you guessing, this is definitely your film.
I:9065;1630;The story, would have been very enjoyable, but the language throughout, detracted from my enjoyment of this film.
I:9065;1631;He gives an outstanding performance as always and the rest of the cast is also very good.
I:9065;1632;But, as I said, I will watch anything with Kevin in it and his performance as Verbal Kint is quite captivating.
I:9065;1633;The script is both the hero and the villaim in this film.
I:9065;1634;Still, the acting is by turns subtle, convincing and humorous, and the 'myth' of Kaiser Szozy (?
I:9065;1635;spelling) is a suggestive and cleverly dramatised idea.
I:9065;1636;The film is a highly polished product.
I:9065;1637;It's a bit like seeing a skillful magicain perform a complicated trick .
I:9065;1638;very entertaining, even thrilling, but with little connection to one's emotions.
I:9065;1639;Probably Kevin Spacey's best performance and the rest of the cast does equally as well in this movie that has the ultimate twist in the end.
I:9065;1640;Super movie here able to watch over and over highly recommend to anyone.
I:9065;1641;Great line up of actors and great story
I:9065;1642;exceptfor a movie buff there is a whole 2nd disk with lots of great bg and info.
I:9065;1643;I saw it originally based on a recommendation from one of my students.
I:9065;1644;This is one of the best films ever made.
I:9065;1645;It starts and you think it's a caper.
I:9065;1646;It magically transforms into a character study so compelling you can't take your eyes off the screen.
I:9065;1647;if a great movie stays with you after you've left the theater, this is one of the best.
I:9065;1648;This is a screen classic.
I:9065;1649;the ending is so brilliant that it ruins the movie for a second viewing.
I:9065;1650;Even then, it must be seen at least once more to gain a sense of its multiple meanings and then again at least several more times to appreciate its complexity and ambiguity.
I:9065;1651;The viewer's patience is abundantly rewarded with thought.
I:9065;1652;Under Brian Singer's crisp direction, all of the cast's performances are first.
I:9065;1653;received an Academy Award for his performance.
I:9065;1654;Were an Academy Award also given for best ensemble, he and others in the cast would have received it.
I:9065;1655;I began to wonder, which (if any) of the characters can I trust?
I:9065;1656;Hence this film's elusive but compelling appeal, one which I, at least, am unable to explain in a brief commentary such as this.
I:9065;1657;But I guaranteethat Kevin Spacey does a great job of acting in this film.
I:9065;1658;Before the dime drops (or should I say the cup of coffee) at the end of the film, I felt that I had already seen a great movie.
I:9065;1659;By the time the last word of the film was spoken, my jaw dropped in amazement.
I:9065;1660;This is an extraordinary film.
I:9065;1661;This is a suspenseful, action.
I:9065;1662;funny movie that has as a PLOT DEVICE our susceptibility to believe what we want to belive.
I:9065;1663;so I'll go on to the performances.
I:9065;1664;Yes, Kevin Spacey is great, and all that Academy Award worthiness stuff.
I:9065;1665;Rouding out the cast are the always surprising Dan Hedaya and Giancarlo Esposito.
I:9065;1666;behind it all is an unbelieveably tight script and Bryan Singer's masterful direction.
I:9065;1667;This is a must see movie for lovers of crime, action, mystery films, and a must see for anyone who enjoys the type of rare film that is well.
I:9065;1668;A very compelling mystery right until the end which was totally unexpected.
I:9065;1669;Movie had me on the edge of my seat the whole time.
I:9065;1670;I have to admit I was able to predict the ending when I first saw it, but just barely, the plot is very in depth and engrossing that everyone will enjoy it.
I:9065;1671;The story does a good job of portraying the period of time when these kids got in trouble.
I:9065;1672;The Usual Suspects is the kind of film that you get what you put into it.
I:9065;1673;it is well respected be cause of the fact that it is a complex film and will , make you think.
I:9065;1674;this movie has the original theatrical trailer and a great and worth watching commentary by Bryan Singer good options and an incredible movie that you will want to watch over and over its a fair bet you won't get tired of watching it.
I:9065;1675;"layered story of rapacious greed and ambition, ""Usual Suspects"" puts together a great cast and a story."
I:9065;1676;targeting for robbery various high.
I:9065;1677;By now, Verbal has recounted what he knows of Soze .
I:9065;1678;Soze's is the name that that career criminals utter to themselves when they need something to keep them up at night.
I:9065;1679;okay, that's as far as I can go without spoiling it.
I:9065;1680;Nevertheless, the script works some great magic.
I:9065;1681;The biggest mystery of all, when I saw it, was figuring out what kind of movie this was.
I:9065;1682;"a sort of ""Brinks Job"" for the 1990's, but the result is much more satisfying."
I:9065;1683;he's gone.Chilling words from one of the most chilling scenes in this brilliantly written, acted and directed film.
I:9065;1684;Confusing, yes, but genius to write it as Christopher McQuarrie did.
I:9065;1685;He deserved the Oscar he received.
I:9065;1686;The walk is brilliantly executed, as it causes the audience to feel sorrow, but at the same time have a deep.
I:9065;1687;It is a brilliantly written film with dynamic performances by Spacey, Palimentri, Kevin Pollak and Stephen Baldwin.
I:9065;1688;It is funny, chilling, suspenseful and action packed, making for an awesome movie experience.
I:9065;1689;it will leave you breathless.
I:9065;1690;I used to love this movie.
I:9065;1691;The film's often mentioned final twist seems so devilishly clever the first time you see it.
I:9065;1692;All five usual suspects are characters that have appeared in dozens of streetwise mysteries before but their interaction with one another is appealing.
I:9065;1693;"Del Toro has some great lines as Fenster, (""He'll flip ya, flip ya fo' real"" is a fav of mine) and most of the perforances are well done."
I:9065;1694;Spacey is of course great and this is my favorite role for Chazz P since A Bronx Tale.
I:9065;1695;success when it was released in theatres, The Usual Suspects finally gets a good deluxe treatment.
I:9065;1696;There are so many familiar faces in this film, but Kevin Spacey is soooo good in this classic!
I:9065;1697;One my favorite movie endings!
I:9065;1698;Kevin Spacey and everyone else in the movie is awesome.
I:9065;1699;This is deffinately one of the best films ever!
I:9065;1700;Let's get one thing straight: I really enjoy The Usual Suspects.
I:9065;1701;Bryan Singer's artful direction of Christopher McQuarrie's ingenius script, as well as perfect casting, make The Usual Suspects a film impossible to forget.
I:9065;1702;The success of their revenge leads to an even bigger job, this time for the elusive and feared Keyser Soze.
I:9065;1703;Keaton (Gabriel Byrne) is a cool headed professional, who insists that everything be thought out.
I:9065;1704;The last five minutes of this movie will tell you just that as well as make you rethink the entire film.
I:9065;1705;A must see movie, one of the best films of the 1990's.
I:9065;1706;The only confusing part about this movie is how Kevin Spacey won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar when he's in 90% of this movie, he should have won Best Actor!
I:9065;1707;Im so serious when I say best movie of all time.
I:9065;1708;This movie is funny, it has action, is interesting, has great acting and the best ending I have ever seen in any movie, it had me totally surprised at the end, I wasn't expecting it at all.
I:9065;1709;So many wonderful quotes in this movie.
I:9065;1710;It's a delight to watch.
I:9065;1711;The movie is cleverly plotted and stars a wonderful cast.
I:9065;1712;the highlight of the movie has to be Oscar winner Kevin Spacey.
I:9065;1713;He plays his part brilliantly well.
I:9065;1714;as good as it was the first day it hit video store shelves.
I:9065;1715;A film that has more twists and turns than something with twists and turns.
I:9065;1716;Usuall Suspects delivers the unexpected plot twists you never saw coming.
I:9065;1717;An interesting and provocative film that will have you glued to your seat and the tv screen.
I:9065;1718;This fantastic film with an astonishing ending will keep the spectator tied to the armchair.
I:9065;1719;Great disc without lots of special features.
I:9065;1720;Great actors and fine storyline.
I:9065;1721;if you haven't seen it lately i do recommend it to you.
I:9065;1722;Sure it's clever and tricky, sure Kevin Spacey gives a knock.
I:9065;1723;Oh yeah, the revelation at the end is a complete surprise, and for a moment, the shock elevates the movie, but once you start to let reason enter in, you realize that everything else that has gone before in this story has been rendered utterly meaningless.
I:9065;1724;Many films with great surprise endings work within the story to shed new light on what has gone before (Sixth Sense, Memento), but his one completely throws out everything else in the movie, and says, Nyah, nyah, fooled you, and you sat there and listened to the whole thing!
I:9065;1725;It's a highly entertaining film, don't get me wrong.
I:9065;1726;It has a great crime story and strong actors letting it all hang out, especially Gabriel Byrne as the one crook who finally figures out what's going on, but don't pretend that the ending is some brilliant twist.
I:9065;1727;If you want to fall into the world of a story, you have to trust that it's a real world, and not one existing solely in the mind of one character.
I:9065;1728;A very enjoyable movie, but like the 6th Sense its re.
I:9065;1729;I've seen it several times since and the intelligence of it is still amazing.
I:9065;1730;I've watched it twice, and I have some trouble following it, but I think it is worth my time.
I:9065;1731;It may seem like a monotonous watch at first, but once you finish, you'll most likely be happy that you did.
I:9065;1732;This is a real CON movie, you do not except the ending, and it does not matter how many times you see it, you wont believe it
I:9065;1733;This is one of my favorite films of all time for several reasons: 1) The plot is fantastic 2) The acting is believable 3) The plot is fantastic 4) KEYSER SZE
I:9065;1734;The cast is outstanding, the way they gel together.
I:9065;1735;A great crime thriller showing how crime doesn't pay but with humor and an unforgettable ending.
I:9065;1736;I'm not a Kevin Spacey fan but he was great in this!
I:9065;1737;Hope you enjoy as much as I did.
I:9065;1738;This was a funny movie.
I:9065;1739;I RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE ON A RAINY DAY so sit back and enjoy.
I:9065;1740;I received this movie today from Amazon.
I:9065;1741;This story stays fresh even after watching it about 6 times.
I:9065;1742;The concept, the characters, the actors all made this a thoroughly enjoyable movie.
I:9065;1743;Awesome movie, one of my favorites of all time.
I:9065;1744;Everything about this movie is fantastic, from actors and locations to direction and story.
I:9065;1745;If you haven't seen this classic, it's a must.
I:9065;1746;The story has twists and turns every which way, the performances are great all around, its suspensful and even if you know the ending before you see it, it will surprise you.
I:9065;1747;Its truely one of the best crime films ever made, worthy of quite a few oscar noms at least, and i agree with it winning for screenplay and supporting actor.
I:9065;1748;The Usual Suspects is a great movie, probably one of the best crime.
I:9065;1749;thrillers ever made and a personal favorite of mine.
I:9065;1750;Great job in making a surprise mystery thriller.
I:9065;1751;This film has one of the best endings ever.
I:9065;1752;up is exciting (albeit a little violent) and the climax is guaranteed to leave the audience breathless.
I:9065;1753;Kevin Spacey shines, with his mesmerising acting.
I:9065;1754;If you like suspense and do not mind a little violence, then this is a must.
I:9065;1755;See it knowing as little aspossible, I saw this film totally cold and really enjoyed it and wastotally surprised.
I:9065;1756;I think it's easily the best film I've seen in thelast ten years.
I:9065;1757;the casting andacting is exceptional.
I:9065;1758;The highlight of the film is the line.
I:9065;1759;up scenewhich is really funny (the director filmed the scene a number of timesand chose the best take) but the film as a whole is of a very highstandard and will keep you guessing until the end.
I:9065;1760;kevin Spacey is brilliant and did win an Academy Award for hisrole but everyone else is just as exceptional.
I:9065;1761;As the hyperactiveMcManus who knows no fear and has some of the best dialogue in thefilm to boot.
I:9065;1762;a great filmwhich won the writer, Christopher McQuarrie an Academy Award for BestOriginal Screenplay and a must see.
I:9065;1763;This movie is one of those classics that you go back to every now and then just to enjoy the ride.
I:9065;1764;"In fact, knowing the story may actually make it more interesting
I:9065;1765;Totally surprising ending and a host of great actors.
I:9065;1766;The movie has a great line up of actors and all did very well playing their part.
I:9065;1767;I enjoy the whodunnit type movies and this one had me guessing until the end!
I:9065;1768;Although it seems like a slow beginning, this movie will keep you riveted to it and you will love the ending.
I:9065;1769;One of the best movies ever made.
I:9065;1770;Watched it, and it was great.
I:9065;1771;It's a great movie that's not new but still thrilling to watch.
I:9065;1772;This has to be one of the most intriguing films of the last twenty years.
I:9065;1773;The twists and turns (right up until the end) in the story keep you on your toes as the suspense draws you into the drama.
I:9065;1774;A masterful script, well directed with lots of action, and yet, the most intriguing part is the brilliantly crafted (both in performance and page) characterizations.
I:9065;1775;I found this film riveting and recommend it highly.
I:9065;1776;The plot was done pretty well, with some twists that they kept hidden pretty well until the end, well done.
I:9065;1777;Kevin Spacey is amazing .
I:9065;1778;if you like him in House of Cards, you will love this decade old+ film.
I:9065;1779;This is a fantastic movie.
I:9065;1780;No special effects, green screens, etc., just great actors doing great acting!
I:9065;1781;The cast, the characters, and the intelligent but entertaining plot make this a great way to spend two hours.
I:9065;1782;Thsi is one of the great ORIGINAL movies.
I:9065;1783;Great team of actors and wonderful story.
I:9065;1784;All I can really say is this movie has one of the best endings ever!
I:9065;1785;This movie is definitely a must see.
I:9065;1786;An incredible achievement for Brian Singer.
I:9065;1787;An extraordinary film that keeps you guessing all the way to the end.
I:9065;1788;The climax comes near the end of the movie with an ingenious surprise.
I:9065;1789;The flashbacks are suspenseful gripping your mind making you rethink your own instincts when the film is over.
I:9065;1790;time classics: Personally, I disagree and think this is a masterpiece of a movie.
I:9065;1791;Christopher McQuarrie's Oscar winning screenplay, skillfully brought to life by director Bryan Singer, is a patchwork of elements that combine to thrill the viewer and draw you ever deeper into the intricate web of the plot.
I:9065;1792;Kevin Spacey deservedly won an Oscar for his portrayal of Verbal Kint, the club.
I:9065;1793;The story is recounted by Spacey to the investigating customs officer, played by the skillful Chazz Palmintieri, in ever increasing levels of complexity.
I:9065;1794;The to and fro between Palmintieri and Spacey is a delight to watch but it would spoil the experience to describe the scenes in too much detail.
I:9065;1795;This movie is an all round pleasure: the writing inventive, the acting delightful, and the visual clues are a creation of the writer and director that require a second viewing to fully appreciate.
I:9065;1796;The characters all play off of each other very well.
I:9065;1797;Interesting take on a whodunit .
I:9065;1798;I would recommend this movie to anyone over 14 (due to the language).
I:9065;1799;It's been five years since the release of The Usual Suspects, so you should have gathered by now that there's a bit of a twist at the end.
I:9065;1800;loop in the rollercoaster ride that is the incredible script.
I:9065;1801;You'll notice the acting and the dialogue, of course, but it's the ending that will stick in your mind.
I:9065;1802;wathc it again, however, and it's a whole new experience: just take a look at the little titbits that were missed the last time round but can be enjoyed even more now that you know how it turns out.
I:9065;1803;This viewing will ensure that the dialogue is imprinted on your mind, and the fantastic performances won't be forgotten in the fog of amazement that the ending pumped out the first couple of times.
I:9065;1804;When it comes, the denouement won't be such a thrill any more, but on the plus side, you'll enjoy the two hours or so that precede it even more.
I:9065;1805;He and I are still friends so even to this day, I still thank him for introducing me to this amazing movie.
I:9065;1806;Plenty of other reviewers have detailed the plot.
I:9065;1807;It's captivating and smart and the ending is awesome.
I:9065;1808;Kevin Spacey is amazing, but then again, he always is in my book.
I:9065;1809;all of actors together in this movie really makes worth watching again and again.
I:9065;1810;Great story and good acting.
I:9065;1811;Not a family show but good for adults to share in.
I:9065;1812;Mystery suspense lots of action and very good played out drama.
I:9065;1813;The drama is especially key to the story.
I:9065;1814;The Usual SuspectsEvery now and again a film comes along that is described as a gem.
I:9065;1815;This is because the film just like a gem is a surprising pleasure to find esecially amongst the mass expanse and typical rubble of moviedom.
I:9065;1816;is just such a gem!The film is described as a classic by all who have seen it even though it was released as recently as 1995.
I:9065;1817;if you are going to see the film for the first time, you will notice that when you ask for the film at your local video store, a smile will mould itself onto the owner's face.
I:9065;1818;Why?Because he knows just as everyone else who has seen the film that you are letting yourself in for something special.
I:9065;1819;and, I guarantee you that the next time you go into your local video store and catch a glimpse of the now 'oh.
I:9065;1820;assured individual stands out from a crowd.
I:9065;1821;I hope you enjoy the film again and have fun trying to answer the immortal question:WHO IS KEYSER SOZE?Hope you found this review helpful.
I:9065;1822;"What earns a film the characterisation ""classic""?"
I:9065;1823;First and foremost a great script.
I:9065;1824;"The ""Usual Suspects"" has the definition of a great script."
I:9065;1825;It keeps you guessing until literally the very last minute when it leaves you in awe.
I:9065;1826;art mind games are dominant throughout while parts of the story could actually be separate films alltogether.
I:9065;1827;"as you try to make sense out of what ""verbal"" says (while the ""facts"" keep constantly changing and ""verbal"" keeps adjusting his story according to the new clues coming in) the mind game keeps climaxing and the myth about Keyser Sose elevates to incredible manipulations."
I:9065;1828;Possibly one of the most ingenius film.
I:9065;1829;Kevin Spacey doesn't simply give yet another solid performance, he gives a trademark performance, one that many a character have since been based.
I:9065;1830;"on on film and doubtlessly more are to follow as the character of ""Verbal"" is sharply inspiring."
I:9065;1831;"the most clues are given, perhaps, by Keyser's ""right hand"" the enigmatic ""Mr. Kobayashi"" who serves also as a guide to Sose's power for the viewers."
I:9065;1832;"Puts the ""C"" into classic."
I:9065;1833;This is an outstanding movie with almost a cult following.
I:9065;1834;loved it and highly recommend!
I:9065;1835;It's better the 2nd and 3rd time you watch it!
I:9065;1836;This movie was entertaining to me every single time I saw it.
I:9065;1837;It's clever, it's funny, it's dramatic, it's everything.
I:9065;1838;Kevin Spacey is a great actor and tells the story of Keiser Soze better than anyone else.
I:9065;1839;He weaves a tale so detailed, that we soon start to believe every word he says.
I:9065;1840;They may not be huge, but it's still a lot of fun.
I:9065;1841;This is a great movie, definitely worth the watch.
I:9065;1842;It's best watched when the audience has no idea of what's going to happen.
I:9065;1843;So just go ahead and give my review an unhelpful vote right now.
I:9065;1844;and I still feel I could enjoy the movie a second time even though I already know what's going to happen.
I:9065;1845;I guess The Usual Suspects is just a good movie regardless.
I:9065;1846;Okay, so I heard about how great this movie is.
I:9065;1847;It's funny, it's great, it's a classic, they all said.
I:9065;1848;The story was very complex.
I:9065;1849;I've seen several people talk about how hilarious this movie is.
I:9065;1850;Okay, so let it be a mystery.
I:9065;1851;If anybody wants to see a GOOD crime movie, with characters we can actually feel for and care about plus a complex and intriguing story, try watching THE GODFATHER again.
I:9065;1852;Now THAT is what good moviemaking is all about.
I:9065;1853;The subject of crime/ mystery / suspense is a great thing and there are much better movies out there to see.
I:9065;1854;It's gets one star for the actors that were in it.
I:9065;1855;You'll also discover nuance upon nuance in Kevin Spacey's incredible performance.
I:9065;1856;You'll see that tiny apologetic grin on Todd Hockney's face as attorney Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite) lists a weapons truck heist .
I:9065;1857;"among a cast of tremendous actors (to name just two, Gabriel Byrne in one of his best performances and Benicio del Toro, deserving much more than just an ""also starring"" mentioning in the opening credits), Kevin Spacey's star shines brightest."
I:9065;1858;this is one of those movies which have you quote their many memorable one.
I:9065;1859;"(Just look at how many reviewers on this site alone are quoting the one about ""the devil's greatest trick."")"
I:9065;1860;It is one of the best modern examples of the genre and has long since become a cult classic .
I:9065;1861;it's a must in every decent collection.
I:9065;1862;running Time: 106 minutesRated R for violence and a substantial amount of strong language.
I:9065;1863;The Usual Suspects is, quite simply, a masterpiece of cinematic intrigue and suspense.
I:9065;1864;At various points throughout its runtime, it is almost disarmingly comic, action.
I:9065;1865;packed and insightful, yet at any given point when the film seems to be conforming to the clich s of its genre, the director is merely toying with the viewer and laying the foundations for one of cinema's most memorable climaxes.
I:9065;1866;The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he doesn't exist.
I:9065;1867;Kint, one of the five, and, hampered by physical deformities, definitely the sickliest, appears to be the only survivor.
I:9065;1868;He knows his form, and had not for one moment bought Keaton's recent line that his criminal days were behind him.
I:9065;1869;spacey and Byrne, a study in contrasts both physical and temperamental, bring actorly gravitas to Bryan Singer's stylish and eloquent crime film.
I:9065;1870;Byrne, physically imposing and craggy.
I:9065;1871;"With him, Singer and McQuarrie have crafted something of a genre classic, complete with a breathtaking climactic twist that's right up there with ""The Crying Game"" and ""The Sixth Sense"" in the gobsmacking movie surprise stakes."
I:9065;1872;One of the better, most intelligent films of the middle of the decade.
I:9065;1873;The Usual Suspects (1995) is a riveting tale with Kevin Spacey, as Verbal Kint, delivering superb acting as the sole survivor of a dope deal gone bad being interrogated by Federal Agent Dave Kujan ( played by Chazz Palminteri).
I:9065;1874;The action, intrigue and suspense with lots of terrific twists and turns will keep you on the edge of your seat.
I:9065;1875;the cast did perfect acting which my favorite besides spacey was Mcmanus played by Stephen baldwin and the halerious Fred Fenster played by Benicio Del Toro.
I:9065;1876;A modern classic after reservoir dogs ( which i think the idea of the usual suspects came from and pulp fiction which has nothing in commen but is just simply another masterpieace in my book).
I:9065;1877;An excellent movie that keeps you interested all the way through.
I:9065;1878;A grabber, nice to see a good one come along with all the other rubbish out there.
I:9065;1879;and it gets better with each repetition!
I:9065;1880;A very underrated movie compared to other 'con.
I:9065;1881;Mysteries SHOULD give U tiny clues along the way as to who did it.
I:9065;1882;can't say movie was great.
I:9065;1883;My spouse gaives it 2 stars, I give it one.
I:9065;1884;This is a great movie!
I:9065;1885;I liked the actors in this movie and thought the story was pretty good.
I:9065;1886;A definite worth checking out movie for a slow night.
I:9065;1887;It is one of those movies that is an instant classic.
I:9065;1888;its completely plot driven but the acting is terrific and the performance by Kevin Spacey is the best you will ever see.
I:9065;1889;For real complexity, see Scorsese's Raging Bull, or Coppola's Godfather films.
I:9065;1890;Just a great movie all around.
I:9065;1891;Good story line and an interesting twist at the end.
I:9065;1892;An excellent and intriguing movie in which Kevin Spacey plays an phenomenal role!!!
I:9065;1893;life allure results from a seamless blending of elements: Pschodrama, Action, Suspense and Mystery, all built on intricate storytelling, a dynamic screenplay and taught direction, by Bryan Singer.
I:9065;1894;depth character development, brought to life by an outstanding cast, who flesh out each role to chilling near perfection.
I:9065;1895;(Kevin Spacey, seen here before most people would have recognized his name, received an Oscar for his supporting role!)
I:9065;1896;More than anything else, SUSPECTS is about the unparalleled unsettling reaction you get from viewing it!
I:9065;1897;a peerless example of instant timeless classic film noir.
I:9065;1898;without warning, the intruder firmly raises a pistol, his unblinking gaze reflected in eyes locked in contact with his own.
I:9065;1899;This has to be one of the best films ever to be made.
I:9065;1900;Kevin Spacey once again proves how talented he is and is well supported by the cast.
I:9065;1901;Bulk of the film is solid, but the twist ending makes this movie an all.
I:9065;1902;The actors in this movie I actually like a lot in other films, but NOT this film.
I:9065;1903;The Usual Suspects is a complicated puzzle of a movie that I you can't watch just once.
I:9065;1904;An amazing original screenplay and tight direction keep up a substantial amount of tension throughout.
I:9065;1905;Enjoyable the first time you watch it, even more enjoyable the second time round.
I:9065;1906;You'll welcome every minute of it.
I:9065;1907;The wonderful ensemble acting stretches far beyond the master, Kevin Spacey, to include both mesmerizing and hilarious performances from all of the cast.
I:9065;1908;The cinematography is breathtaking in its originality.
I:9065;1909;I remember thinking, Holy Crap!
I:9065;1910;I felt that this movie was amazing.
I:9065;1911;acted (Spacey deserved the Oscar for this one), suspenseful, extremely entertaining and thought provoking, and was well paced.
I:9065;1912;If youve never seen it, it is definitely one that you want to check out.
I:9065;1913;I recommend it to anyone who enjoys watching excellent movies.
I:9065;1914;When I first saw this movie I was caught up in an interesting story and that alone makes it worth your time.
I:9065;1915;It has one of the most unforgettable endings of all time.
I:9065;1916;I love Kevin Spacey and Chaz Palminteri and they make this movie better with their acting.
I:9065;1917;One of the best movies of the 1990s, The Usual Suspects startles and surprises.
I:9065;1918;And a really good one (grimacing and teary.
I:9065;1919;Nietzsche said: Talking much about oneself can also be a means to conceal oneself.
I:9065;1920;He also has his back turned to the bulletin board until the very end of the film.
I:9065;1921;great script, great acting, great movie.
I:9065;1922;Kept me on my toes.
I:9065;1923;He made the role believable.
I:9065;1924;Everybody should watch this film.
I:9065;1925;It is a classic and very smartly written, directed and acted.
I:9065;1926;Oh, and the ending is pretty darn cool, if you didn't see it coming.
I:9065;1927;It is a well written screenplay with lots of twists and turns.
I:9065;1928;There's a reason it's a classic!
I:9065;1929;The acting is superb, the plot is beautifully twisty without being convoluted, and the entire thing is beautifully written and shot.
I:9065;1930;If you like things like LA Confidential, you'll probably love this.
I:9065;1931;I think it was a defining role for Kevin Spacey and really brought the whole who done it type of style movie back into popularity.
I:9065;1932;It will keep you hooked inthe entire movie.
I:9065;1933;Bencio Del Toro still steals the show.
I:9065;1934;This is a movie you will watch over and over again until you get it.
I:9065;1935;It's a twist that you'll never expect from such an all star cast.
I:9065;1936;Brian Singer's Opus, one of the best movies ever made.
I:9065;1937;Credible and worth watching over and over.
I:9065;1938;Good cast of characters, though.
I:9065;1939;I just love all the characters, the way they are brought together and interact.
I:9065;1940;It's a good story and the twist at the end doesn't keep you from wanting to watch it a second time.
I:9065;1941;As for the movie, one of my all time favorites.
I:9065;1942;There is a nice complex timeline with a lot of flashbacks with really work to enhance the movie.
I:9065;1943;The Usual Suspects is 1995's fantastic mystery/thriller directed by Brian Singer and written by Christopher McQuarrie.
I:9065;1944;The film won two Oscars, one for McQuarrie's original screenplay and one for Spacey's brilliant performance as a supporting actor in the role of Verbal Kint.
I:9065;1945;The end of the film is one of the most stunning endings in the history of Hollywood, and there are to this day, huge arguments about it.
I:9065;1946;The story is what drives this film and makes it special.
I:9065;1947;cons do a fantastic job.
I:9065;1948;Also I really enjoyed Chazz Palminteri's portrayal of US Customs agent Dave Kujan, and Pete Postlewaite's portrayal of Keyser Sose's lawyer Kobayashi.
I:9065;1949;The acting in this movie was truly first rate.
I:9065;1950;It's rated R for a reason.
I:9065;1951;But even so, it's one of the best mystery/thrillers I've ever seen.
I:9065;1952;It's one on the best films ever made.
I:9065;1953;It's also a film that stays with you.
I:9065;1954;And finally if you think about it, you get it.
I:9065;1955;The finest line from the film sums it all up.
I:9065;1956;The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist.
I:9065;1957;This is an intelligent movie for people who appreciate a feast, and after, you're left with dessert.
I:9065;1958;It's a game played well.
I:9065;1959;fine performances from all involved, especially Kevin Spacey, Gabriel Byrne and Director Bryan Singer.
I:9065;1960;Great screenplay by Christopher McQuarrie.
I:9065;1961;I strongly encourage anyone who has not yet seen it to do so.
I:9065;1962;The commentary by the writer and the director is hilarious!
I:9065;1963;Excellent cast with superb character development.
I:9065;1964;Look for Mr. Kobayashi to show up and life begins to get interesting for the usual suspects.
I:9065;1965;Kevin Spacey is at his finest in this intriguing action/mystery.
I:9065;1966;Supporting actors deliver well in their parts in this web of intrigue.
I:9065;1967;you will enjoy watching this movie several times.
I:9065;1968;The Usual Suspects is clever and flawlessly executed.
I:9065;1969;He hasn't watched it yet but sure he will like it.
I:9065;1970;from this movie, it is best if you had a mind free from expectation when viewing this film.
I:9065;1971;one the best psycho thrillers ever.
I:9065;1972;i won't give away this film the stars are great, the the movie excellent and the story is filled with suspence,drama and action, this is a movie you definitely must see laterz folks.
I:9065;1973;If you are a Kevin Spacey fan and haven't seen this movie you would be in for a treat as far as seeing what a well rounded actor he is by watching it.
I:9065;1974;The movie on a whole is done well and the other actors all do a fine job.
I:9065;1975;The ending is excellent well thought out.
I:9065;1976;"I'm sure you've all seen it, and we all know it's wonderful
I:9065;1977;And, OK, the commentary is very interesting, but they keep going on about these great outtakes they had, but they're not on the disc.
I:9065;1978;Brilliant script/plot, brilliantly acted, with a popper of an ending.
I:9065;1979;For me, this is Kevin Spacey's best performance among many great performances.
I:9065;1980;The ending sequence is as beautifully executed as it is unexpected.
I:9065;1981;Subsequent viewings are just as good as the first even though you know what happens, because the characters are so compelling and the story is so enthralling.
I:9065;1982;This is one of those movies.
I:9065;1983;One of my favorite films of all times, The Usual Suspects is an exeptionally strong ensemble cast work.
I:9065;1984;Kevin Spacey's Verbal Gint character is terrific to watch as well.
I:9065;1985;Benicio del Toro steals scenes with his bizzare choice of character in an otherwise nothing role.
I:9065;1986;threaded fashion while keeping viewers entertained and involved enough to pay attention.
I:9065;1987;the ending will either annoy or delight you depending on how you view films.
I:9065;1988;I loved it and on second viewing the forshadowing of events are right in front of you like a good murder mystery although The Usual Suspects is much more than a mystery film or buddy flick or crime caper film while being a little bit of each.
I:9065;1989;it's great to see a film that isn't high budget and relies on acting and a good script to move the film along.
I:9065;1990;Although embraced by hollywood this is as independent as you will find in it's easy tone and believable characters.
I:9065;1991;(Note: one of my favorite movies of all time).
I:9065;1992;singer and MacQuarrie speak in depth about writing this movie, about setting up the shots, about all the background detail in the movie, about the technical details such as sound, editing, and film score.
I:9065;1993;"Since Singer and MacQuarrie are friends and business partners, it was entertaining to listen to their exchange
I:9065;1994;I love the ending every time I watch it.
I:9065;1995;Benicio is the Reason to see this film more than three times.
I:9065;1996;The first few times it's great.
I:9065;1997;It is a good movie but Benicio made it for me.
I:9065;1998;I just finished watching this film for the second time and I must say that it is one of the absolute best movies I've ever seen.
I:9065;1999;The entire cast gives a fantastic performance, and the non.
I:9065;2000;This is truly a 5 star film.
I:9065;2001;blowing ending in the history of American Cinema.

I:9065;2003;It was excellent and I recommended it to others.
I:9065;2004;Always loved Kevin Spacey and can't complain about Gabriel Byrne, Benicio delTorro and the others.
I:9065;2005;Has always been a favorite of mine since I saw it when I was young.
I:9065;2006;if you enjoy great acting, a great, twisty, even twisted sort of plot, you are in for a treat and I highly recommend!
