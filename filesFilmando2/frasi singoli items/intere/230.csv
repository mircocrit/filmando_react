1;This is a nonstop laugh a minute movie that will have you rolling in the aisles.
2;highly recommended to any age
3;Private Benjamin starring Goldie Hawn is a film I have tried to enjoy on many occasions .
4;This comedy isn't horrible but it isn't brilliant either.
5;Hawn is a delightful actress but I just feel the premise and characters are a little far.
6;The first half of the film is strong and the last hour .
7;I rank it five because Goldies Hawn works very funny the realities of life.
8;With families problems and treat reality with hope to survive and overcome any situation.
9;Just a cute fun movie for my military mom who sort of looked like Pvt Benjamin in her GI days.
10;She is the perfect spoiled brat goes army.
11;great movie for when you need to escape the real world and just laugh
12;It is the kind of movie that I would be classify indie, Goldie is exquisite, a charm and so witty and smart.
13;and I appreciate a good pro.
14;storyline is dynamic and quite realistic yes you could be by accident a widow divorcee at 29 yo2.
15;humor loaded, sexy and innocent at once3.
16;portrait of women : strong women , sisterhood in the army .4.
17;She is a dynamic character in this fabulous movie!
18;Thank you for sending this with such speed, this was the bonus to a product that is in great shape.
19;I enjoyed seeing it again.
20;My favorite line was response to the mother asking what her son's last words were to his wife.
21;"Private Benjamin is one of the best feminist movies of all time
I:222;22;Bravo to Goldie Hawn for making this movie!
I:222;23;It's entertaining, very meaningful, and very funny!
I:222;24;Watched with my son, had it on mute and his head under a pillow more often that I felt was necessary.
I:222;25;it had a lot of things that were true about the milatary which is why it was so funny.
I:222;26;I absolutely love this movie"
27;Goldie Hawn is perfect as the pampered Jewish bride who suddenly loses her way and joins the army.
28;And figuring out the French guy's shallow meaningless character was brilliant.
29;Goldie Hawn in arguably one of her best films (certainly one of her greatest performances of the 80's).
30;"a classic ""fish out of water"" story, produced by Hawn and largely."
31;Had seen it many years ago and wanted to own it so I could watch it as much as possible.
32;It is wonderful to see her transformation from a taken care of woman to someone who evolves into her own person.
33;Much more than the other 2 times that I saw it.
34;my granddaughter is heading to Army boot camp tomorrow and we thought this would be a good watch.
35;respect, deal with the Frenchman, etc.
36;Still, Private Benjamin is refreshing and fun.
37;Goldie Hawn, who is a true comic actress, makes an original, appealing character out of Judy Benjamin, and so the movie feels alive, not just an exercise in gags and situations.
38;We actually bought two copies!
39;One for us, to remind my wife of her Army experiences, and one for a Foster Child that we had at the time.
40;complains, but after a meeting with her family and she understands just what they think of her she decides to take things a little more seriously, and she actually becomes quite good.
41;the entire cast is outstanding, but especially Hawn who lights up the screen with her charm and beauty.
42;This is a great movie about self growth and the ability to become more than what people expect of us.
43;A wonderfully delightful slice of entertainment.
44;I have always enjoyed Goldie Hawn and Eileen Brennan makes the perfect foil to her character.
45;It also has some of the funniest lines in a movie!
46;"This is a fun edition of the ""Goldie"" oldie."
47;I remember some scenes from the Denver premere that were not included in this edition and enjoyed the newer version for a better storyline.
48;There is an amazing number of cameo,s to catch in the details.
49;Goldie Hawn in one of her best films ever!
50;This is a perfect way to spend an afternoon or evening.
51;It had been years since I had seen this movie and enjoyed it very much.
52;I think Goldie Hawn did a fantastic job in this movie.
53;I loved the part she played here.
54;I really love this movie and you don't usually find it in the stores goldie hawn is great its very funny
55;This was funny as usual and sported a good cast.
56;"Goldie Hawn was hilarious in ""Foul Play"" when I first saw it all those years ago and she shows another dimension to her acting and now screenwriting in ""Private Benjamin""."
57;decayed nature of most of the jokes because it is also a very good story about how a spoilt, dependent young woman becomes emancipated and self.
58;confident to be better able to identify various attempts to exploit and manipulate her with her passing the final test at the end with the jerk she's supposed to marry.
59;This is the best Goldie Hawn film that I've seen.
60;as a result, the film retains its ability to still amuse and entertain despite the poor aging of most of the gags.
61;"Goldie Hawn once confessed to Oprah that ""Private Benjamin"" was a ""once in a lifetime "" role and she makes the most of it The part of a Philadelphia socialite turned Army Career Gal is perfect for Hawn's ditzy, sweet personna."
62;As Judy Benjamin becomes less naive, Hawn does a masterful job in keeping her vunerable and sweet.
63;nominated Eileen Brennan keep the laughs coming.
64;Goldie Hawn shines in her first producing and starring role of Private Benjamin.
65;The hilariously funny and witty comedy proves just how versatile this stunning actress can be.
66;When Goldie meets her nemesis the tyrannical Captain Lewis who calls Goldie Princess the fun is just beginning.
67;From the time Goldie cleans the bathroom with her electric toothbrush, to whining her way out of jumping out of an airplane this is definitely one of Goldie's finest moments.
68;Widescreen with some great special features like perhaps an audio commentary by Ms. Hawn and co. star Eileen Brennan!
69;It would be fun to hear two old friends talk about the fun they had in their Oscar nominated roles.
70;Anyway, I would love to see Warner Bros. give this title the treatment it deserves!
71;I keep checking to see if a Special Edition is on the way but, no!
72;I remember watching this movie as a teenager and wanted to see it again.
73;i loved this movie, it was funny and made my Friday night enjoyable!
74;Along with Foul Play this is one of Goldie Hawn's finest hours, playing a rich, pampered widow who is duped into joining the army.
75;Eileen Brennan is equally fantastic as the tough army officer you love to hate.
76;This is worth the laugh!
77;Another Goldie Hawn's best!I will recommend this to lighten up your day!
78;I loved this movie the first time.years ago.
79;I still love the message.
80;pleaser role regardless of the media claims to the contrary.
81;It's always refreshing to see the transformation of a girl when she realizes she is being diminished and takes control of her life.
82;If you are a woman, you will identify in so many of the manipulations.
83;The wedding scene in this movie is a great climax.
84;A smooth talking Army recruiter hears her sad tale on a radio talk show and offers to help her.
85;After smooth talking her in his office, she signs up.
86;Sounds like a real good story right?
87;judy's arrival at Ft Biloxi is funny as are other boot camp scenes.
88;She meets up again with a snobbish Frenchman that she met in Biloxi (yeah I know).
89;She decides to marry him, then changes her mind once she's out of the Army.
90;Bill Murray's 'Stripes' is a good example of 'interest after the boot camp scenes'.
91;This is one of the funniest movies ever!
92;Goldie Hawn and Eileen Brennen are spot on as adversaries in the Army!
93;I love it and now I own it!
94;I enjoy this movie every time I watch it.
95;I think it is one of the best that Goldie Hawn made.
96;Goldie is perfect for this part.
97;I loved this movie when it first came out and still love it now.
98;It's a movie full of laughs and also you get to watch the pampered princess who doesn't know how to do anything, all she's ever been groomed for is marriage and someone to take care of her.
99;she learns to stand on her own two feet It's classic Goldie!
100;She's as adorable as ever.
101;This would make great stocking stuffers for any of your 'Goldie Hawn' fan friends and family.
102;Goldie Hawn and Eileen Brennan at their comedic best.
103;"we watched it prior to her leaving for boot camp, and I'm sure it helped her prepare for her ""adventure""."
104;Private Benjamin is one of her best comedies.
105;"The ""Jewish Princess"" persona wears a little thin in a few places, but most of the time the comedy works well."
106;judy learns that she is good for little.
107;A fortuitous phone call has Judy visiting an Army recruiter, where she learns that modern army life is full of beautiful bases, condos, and yachts, not to mention great medical benefits.
108;basic training is filled with the lovely accommodating people that you might anticipate.
109;She is in charge of herself and doing well.
110;Judy soon finds the man of her dreams, again.
111;Life becomes very interesting for Judy as she decides how to stay in control of her life.
112;this movie has far more humor than my mellow review would intimate.
113;This movie has numerous one.
114;liners that bring smiles all the way to serious laughs.
115;goldie Hawn does an excellent job of bringing the role of Private Benjamin to life.
116;She performed so well that she was nominated for a Best Actress in a Leading Role.
117;Eileen Brennan was also outstanding, and was nominated for Best Actress in a Supporting Role.
118;Both nominations were well deserved.
119;this movie is rated R because it has several scenes that are bit risqu .
120;the occasional bumpy spots in the movie are more than compensated for by the humor of the rest of the movie.
121;This movie is one that I watch when I want light comedy with guaranteed funny jokes.
122;After watching this movie a half dozen times, I suspect I will watch it many more times.
123;Great oldie video for comedy and standing up for yourself!
124;Other than that, it is a great comedy which I would love to own in it's original format.
125;Judy is a newly widowed, spoiled rich kid.
126;I think Goldie Hawn is great in this movie.
127;It's a cute satire military movie.
128;I think Eileen Brennan is great in this role as well.
129;I had forgotten alot of it, but still enjoyed it.
130;it was a good laugh from beginning to end.
131;Goldie Hawn is made for this kind of role, and as usual delivers the goods.
132;There are some genuinely 'laugh out loud' moments as she struggles to adapt and make friends.
133;goldie Hawn is as brilliant as ever and really suits the part of kooky blonde.
134;All in all this is a movie that has stood the test of time and is still worth watching if only for the hilarity of the first half.
135;Just be prepared for the laughs to disappear.
136;Only 1 told me anything about the storyline, so I was surprised when the movie moved beyond her time at boot camp and into what she did next.
137;it was a joy to see Goldie Hawn act again.
138;I remember her best for her time on Rowan and Martin's Laugh In, so it was almost a surprise to see her as an East Coast Jewish princess.
139;This is one of Goldie Hawn's best films.
140;time favorite of mine and this is one movie I enjoy seeing over and over.
141;much like OVERBOARD It just keeps getting better with time.
142;the first half of the movie is the best half, highlighted by many slapstick fish.
143;Eileen Brennan is also great as Judy's commanding officer, a tough.
144;What makes the film far from perfect is the second half.
145;Judy decides to be the best soldier she can be, and becomes the best out of them all.
146;still, despite some glaring flaws, Private Benjamin is a good movie with a good story to tell.
147;If you overlook that, though, the movie is very entertaining.
148;One of Goldie Hawn's great movie.
149;what happens to this Prima Donna is a bellyful of laughs.
150;How else do you take care of a rich brat?
151;ANother good movie that I gave to my BFF who was going into the army and was scared sick.
152;It's funniest in the first half, during her basic phase, and becomes more of a drama in the second half.
153;One of the best films of the 80's!
154;I love the message of self empowerment and I love Goldie Hawn!
155;I bought this as a gift for a friend who loves Goldie Hawn.
156;I really enjoyed this movie.
157;This Warner Bros. 1980 comedy flick is about a spoiled Jewish.
158;pRIVATE BENJAMIN was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actress in a leading role(Goldie Hawn), Best Actress in supporting role(Eileen Brennan), and Best Writing done directly for the screen in the Spring of 1981.
159;this hilarious flick also takes me all the way back to memory lane to when we had all those budget cuts going on from the recession we had back in 1981.1982 when Ronald Reagan was president.
160;This movie is very funny I watched it many years ago and loved it.
161;and the film rarely manages to capitalize on the comic potential of the situations.
162;We cheer for her to succeed.
163;She does, of course, becoming a strong and independent woman in the Army.
164;Her romance with the despicable Henri is the most interesting part of the film, in part because Arman Assante plays his part so well: charming but condescending and unfaithful.
165;I always liked Goldie Hawn and she did a good job in this movie.
166;She is a good actress and showed it in this movie
167;Great family movie, no foul language or sensual scenes, very tactfully made and hilariously funny!
168;Made for a nice night with the family and was somewhat realistic too.
169;We all enjoyed this movie!
170;Love this movie, really makes you laugh and life has enough drama so I love a good comedy.
171;Goldie was great in this!
172;while it's a given that there are no surprises whatsoever, it's one of those comedies that manages to be pretty consistently funny throughout even if there aren't many really big laughs out of sheer likeability.
173;Eileen Brennan is clearly having a ball as the obligatory sadistic training officer out to make her life hell and there's a quietly impressive supporting cast filling out the ranks as well as a memorable Bill Conti score.
174;This is one of Goldie Hawn's funnies pictures.
175;But I love it every time.
176;I just love Goldie Hawn and others in this movie.
177;I've seen this, always wanted it, THERE'S A WHOLE SERIES OF THESE MOVIESget them and enjoy, I know I have
