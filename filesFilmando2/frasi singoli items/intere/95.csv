1;So I decided to give it a try, and I'm glad I did!!
2;the latter was deservedly Oscar nominated for his performance as the man with miraculous powers.
3;It was surprisingly nominated for Best Film (not deserving) and Screenplay as well as the nod to Duncan.
4;The King of Horror once again proves himself by making another psychological drama along the lines of The Shawshank Redemption!
5;This is a great movie that has something for everyone, either you're on the verge of tears or on the edge of your seat!
6;Good movie and the casting was a great team.
7;The director did a good job with layout and design from the prison to the homes of the characters
8;A great movie, as simple as that.
9;Moving, inspiring, and thought provoking.
10;This is a great movie with a great story and a great script.
11;So behold, you are in the presence of greatness.
12;The Green Mile is a feel good movie.
13;Great acting throughout the movie, a nice story, but very, very predictable.
14;Definitely not the best movie of the year or an important work of American cinema, but a very nice movie.
15;The Shawshank Redemption was a masterful work of film, with terrific performances, wonderful direction, and a beautiful story to tell.
16;important, and basically tells a PBS After.
17;There are fine performances in this film, just not from the ones critically lauded.
18;Look to a crazy man with his mouse, a demented police guard, and a toothless murderer to provide some amazingly deep performances in this film.
19;Due to the author, director and local, it's like Shawshank with some Fantastic Happenings and so much more.
20;Moving and mesmerizing story has great performances, thick mood and the some of the fastest and most fulfilling 3 hours you'll ever spend.
21;bD looks and sounds great.
22;An October surprise exclusive at BB.
23;The Green Mile is a film set on death row and focuses on two main characters: a guard (Tom Hanks) and a prisoner (Michael Duncan).
24;And with the throwing in of the inevitable King supernatural twist, is overall well done.
25;Overall a good rendering of the King covert anti.
26;This is pure fantasy, played with a realism that will break your heart.
27;If you can still believe something you've never seen before, and take delight in it, than this film will affect your outlook forever more.
28;Tom Hanks is very good.
29;519 reviews is a huge number, even for a new movie in a mega.
30;tom Hanks always presents very good movies, technically good, not necessarily tasty or flavored, but well.
31;"This one is not an exception
32;but the movie is a fairy tale, with personalities of black and white, pure evils and pure saints, and in order to smartly cover this defect (unfortunately it is presented as defect in the movie), some salt and pepper have been added, like the funny attitude of Graham Greene, the wonderful presentation of the mouse, or the skillfully embedded indication to corruption.
33;Yet you do not get board watching this lengthened movie, you will admittedly enjoy the building of the characters, get amazed by the great techniques in reviving the life of the 30's in prison and in outside life (the visit to the lawyer for example) and convince your self that adults need fairy tales to boost their structure.
34;This one is very good example.
35;But it is deffinately worth watching, but I would have to recomend reading the book before you watch or if you have already watched the movie do yourself a favor and read the book.
36;I have got to admit that this is one of the best movies I have seen ever!
37;Not only has Stephen King written a great novel based on The Green Mile but through his great imagination and mind he has created what would be called one of the best movies of the decade.
38;I am a big fan of Stephen King and I have loved The Green Mile The Green Mile being based in a prison in the 1930s where the main character (tom hanks) is in charge of his own block of prisoners.
39;He brings out joy and happiness into some of the characters in this movie, and to a small amount of characters diturbance and hatred towards the lovely Mr Jingles .
40;I must admit, even though being male, this movie is very emotional, funny, disturbing, sad, and has got to be one of the best movies out.
41;It actually made me very emotional and tears came to my eyes.
42;Hanks shines, but the most oustanding and most touching performance is by Michael Clarke Duncan.
43;john Coffey, the gentle giant Mr. Jingles was added mainly for comic relief(viewers can't be expected to look at depressing scenes for 3 hours) The movie may be a bit depressing, rather disturbing for the soft and faint of heart, but it is so moving and enlightening, that you will undoubtedly become a better person after seeing it.
44;Granted,TSR was a very impressive and touching movie, but The Green Mile leaves it in the dirt!
45;I was rooted to my seat, and tears were flowing uncontrollably down my cheeks.
46;we've got to give TOM HANKS credit for his pick of roles"
47;a story that has a mouse that lives eternally is after all quite special,even in our time.
48;Steven King strikes an incredible balance of the bitter and sweet, endearing and creepy, light and dark.
49;The actors in this film do an absolutely amazing job bringing his artistic vision to life, and they are supported with a superior production
50;Michael Clark Duncan steals the whole movie.
51;As good for once as the books.
52;Being on film took you right there, and it did.
53;one of my favorite movies and i can re match it without getting bored at all
54;This movie touched me in soo many ways.
55;The whole cast enchants you while you watch it.
56;The guards and prisoners alike soon discover the wonderful gift that this man has and it brings them all to question their beliefs.
57;The performances are strong (although, I admit to getting tired of Tom Hanks and his good man in a bad world roles)and the storytelling is good.
58;The scenes of electrocucians are powerful, and I imagine at least a bit realistic.
59;I am generally not a fan of Tom Hanks but I got to admit the Green Mile was a very nice heart warming story.
60;I really enjoyed this film.
61;I thought Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan along with the other cast members did a wonderful job.
62;"Mr. Jingles was the ""best"" :)"
63;This has always been a favorite movie of my wife and I and now it is a welcome addition to our Blu.
64;That's all I have to say.
65;The Green Mile tells the tale of a miracle.
66;I wasn't exactly sure what to expect when I checked out the movie, but I am so happy and sad and emotionally.
67;Tom Hanks was genious, and it is well worth your effort to see the movie just because of him, but the real star of the show I would say is Michael Clarke Duncan as John Coffey, the miracle.
68;His acting ability is beyond words.
69;voluntary portrayal of peace and goodness about him.
70;he gives his character depth and warmth and made him alive as John Coffey.
71;i completely understand why this movie is rated R .
72;For example, the scenes of actual executions in the electric chair are unbelievably realistic, and very scary for younger viewers.
73;The Green Mile is one of the most intense movies I've ever seen.
74;wrenching and hopeful and saddening and beautiful and ugly and just plain wonderful was as ever a movie I've seen.
75;, and slowly but surely showing the truths of life and love.
76;It is one of the most powerful, moving, wonderous shows out, and frankly, you would be missing out on something big if you didn't see it.
77;This movie is based on Stephen King's best seller.
78;I am happy to say this is one of the latter.
79;The movie actually deserves 4.5 stars.
80;(hopefully amazon will one day allow half stars) Frank does a very good job keeping in the spirit of the novel and assembled a wonderful crew.
81;(I hope they will forgive me for not knowing their names) While not quite as good as Darabont's Shawshank, it is definitely worth a look.
82;frank Darabont (known for King's adaptation of the Shawshank Redemption) wonderfully sculpted and told Stephen King's tale of a death row during the Depression.
83;Though he jumped a few years and changed the state, the basic elements of the novel are intact.
84;The one drawback to cinema anymore is that audiences need a happy ending, so this slight oversight is easily forgiven.
85;though over 3 hours long, The Green Mile successfully sets the tone and images.
86;It is a tragic yet uplifting story, that will leave the viewer pondering over it for many hours.
87;a great movie for King fans, and even better for movie fans.
88;The green Mile is a very exciting movie.
89;My wife and I enjoyed it very much.
90;The gripping story, directed with meticulous attention to details, and acted as if the actors were the real characters, doesn't seem like a long movie of 3+ hours.
91;We were very pleased to receive the two disc special edition of The Green Mile.
92;It is in perfect condition.
93;The cost was greatand the product was received in a timely manner.
94;I borrowed this from my town's library and since I like Tom Hanks movies and Stephen King, I assumed I would enjoy it.
95;It was so sweet and sad all at once.
96;The moral of this story is that things are rarely as they seem.
97;This movie is a study in range, from the personification of kindness and compassion to madness and cruelty.
98;There is love, there is suffering, there is strength and courage.
99;the fact that this movie is set on death row makes it extraordinary.
100;Tom Hanks performs as always to expectations, which in his case are high.
101;Michael Clarke Duncan shone beyond anything I could have imagined in the role of John Coffey, an innocent man condemned to die, a man with a miraculous gift.
102;I never had to suspend disbelief, but if you must, it's worth it.
103;The dignity and care that Hanks' character and the other prison guards (with one notable exception) for the death row inmates is extraordinary, and it sets this movie apart from any other prison movie I've ever seen.
104;This movie asks more questions than it answers, but the questions are deep and meaningful.
105;One of the best movies ever made, and I can't recommend it highly enough.
106;I absolutely love this movie!
107;This is Tom Hanks at his absolute best.
108;A classic movie for a great price.
109;I love this movie and am extremely excited that i finally own it!
110;big black dude is my favorite they all my favorite I can watch this show all of the time and time
111;it is exciting and at times amusing all of the way through.
112;In the Green Mile Hanks delivers another oscar calliber performance, although Duncan desreves it more.
113;Once again Hanks is supported by a great script, which has made Darabont one of my favorite interpreters of books for film.
114;It is also filled with great comedic moments and characters that you grow to love, and hate.
115;Duncan makes all of the viewers believe in his miracle.
116;Darabont brings these elements into a very small world and makes the Mile a world of delights that I never thought the movie would live up to.
117;He also creates a seemingly truthful freindship between Hanks' character, Duncan's, and with three other guards on the mile (a stregnth of Darabont's skill as a screenwriter).
118;And as Darabont did with Shawshank Redemption's get on with livin' or get on dyin' , he ends the movie with a great final line, better than any I've ever heard.
119;He's impressed me a few times before but honestly I can't think of a time when he's ever `wowed' me.
120;I decided to give this a chance only because a friend of mine raved it, and it has received high amounts of praise from the critics and have I mentioned yet that it was nominated for Best Picture of the Year at the Academy Awards so with that in mind I decided to sit down and watch this, finally.
121;I've read a while back that the character of John Coffey was modeled after Jesus Christ and this makes perfect sense when you watch this film and analyze it.
122;the performances in this film also elevate the material, especially that of Michael Clarke Duncan who delivers a performance so solid and so tempered that without it the film would have failed.
123;He is, with all due respect, the heart and soul of this film.
124;Tom Hanks surprised me by delivering an outstandingly tender performance.
125;It may actually be his best performance to date.
126;Sam Rockwell is as disturbing as they come and the revelation of his character will chill you.
127;It is not as disturbing as `Carrie' and not as meaningful as `The Shawshank Redemption' but it rest nicely in the middle and delivers solid and gratifying entertainment.
128;The best movie that was made from a Stephen King novel.
129;This movie will keep you in suspense and you will never get tired of watching it.
130;This is a movie i would see more than one time it was long but good.
131;It is funny and sad.
132;The Green Mile is a very powerful show.
133;You are introduced to all of the prisoners there, and create an opinion about them.
134;There is one character who can feel the pain and cruelty that people cause each other.
135;This theme creates an image in the viewers' mind that may even promote change in their heart.
136;a work of pure genius, but I digress .)
137;wrote some months before the release of The Green Mile that he'd seen Darabont's screenplay, and declared it brilliant.
138;Why is The Green Mile brilliant?
139;Take the prison wardens, who are all (with one exception) model citizens, wonderful spokespeople for tolerance and humanity.
140;"You just gotta love these guys
141;surely he's playing a real character, surely.
142;Let's imagine for a moment what must be running through his head: I know the innocent Christ figure is, well, innocent.
143;He's right, let him FRY.
144;This movie and The Hurricane both give one great pause as to today's reality versus how we wish life would be.
145;Both films are rewarding experiences and I recommend them both.
146;The Green Mile was one of the best movies I have ever seen.
147;It had such warmth and compassion.
148;The first thing I had heard about it was from my father and he said 2 words excellent movie .
149;I am a HUGE Tom Hanks fan and he did a FABULOUS job and Micheal Clark Duncan did an absolutely amazing job as John Coffey.
150;Shawshank was a great movie, but the Green Mile was absolutely the best I have seen in a LONG time.
151;Bought it for my dad, this is one of his favorite movies, he has been looking for it for a while and i found it online for him.
152;i think the special power scenes RUINED the movie.
153;I realize this is a Stephen King movie.
154;and those whacko scenes are the scenes that made you KNOW it was a Stephen King movie.
155;Tom Hanks was perfect casting because though he was not the gruff man I had invisioned, he could play all the tender parts really well.
156;All in all, this is a great movie, satisfying to those who have read the book and a good see to those who haven't.
157;Just remember to bring tissues, you will need them.
158;omg, that was so sad and good and the acting was incredlible.
159;well you have to see it!
160;Just a true down to earth movie,Hanks is awesome in anything.
161;Great movie and great price.
162;Billy the kid is a bad man but this is an excellent movie.
163;Its got all the hallmarks of a well done SK book/movie.
164;The Green Mile draws its name from the lime floor tiles that cover the floor of a southern prison's death row.
165;We can therefore believe in them as real people, with pasts and futures, rather than two.
166;All of the characters are important.
167;If there is a plot, it is submerged beneath a dozen important sub.
168;The characters are what keep us entranced during this three.
169;Paul is a good man, surviving the great depression in a less than attractive job.
170;This strength is displayed in other ways as the story progresses.
171;, is a mountain of a man who exudes innocence and peace in equal measures.
172;Percy is well connected in political circles and uses this form of protection to free his base desires.
173;Luckily, Percy is well matched by Paul Edgecomb.
174;We have confidence that Paul will eventually master Percy.
175;all the support roles are outstanding, although Graham Green's character, Arlen Bitterbuck, was not so memorable.
176;The mouse, eventually adopted by Eduard, seems to represent freedom.
177;He comes and goes without restriction.
178;He can't be trapped and he enjoys life, as expressed through his simple circus tricks.
179;Coffey's healing power clearly represents good or perhaps the power of God.
180;in the end, a film that might have centered on the morality of the death penalty, takes us in another direction entirely.
181;Our focus is always Paul Edgecomb.
182;His moral strength and eventual spiritual test are offered to us as a testimony.
183;Hank's performance forces us to examine our own lives.
184;Can we recognize the good in those around us and, more importantly, can we resist the evil?
185;3 hours long, but very well done.
186;The other fantastic prison movie.
187;This one is a little more magical and very touching.
188;A compelling script and incredible acting .
189;I was surprised when I found out the movie was just over 3 hours long!The Green Mile has a similar tone and rhythm of Shawshank Redemption with a hint of the """"Saving Private Ryan."""
190;I'm not a huge Tom Hanks fan but have enjoyed some of his films.
191;Filled with great scenes of both hope and tragedy, of sorrow and of joy, with just a touch of redemption thrown in.
192;The story is a mix of drama, humor, and adds the spiritual/mystical as only Stephen King can do.
193;The story also has one of the most creative twists at the end.
194;Very surprising!But what takes this movie one of the best I've personally watched is the supporting cast.
195;i would recommend this to any movie buff looking for originality and creativity.
196;Great actors, great story, great film!
197;The Green Mile also contained strong elements from movie and book classics of the past such as The Grapes of Wrath (story taking place during the Great Depression) and Of Mice and Men (the mouse and the big.
198;this is surely a modern masterpiece bound for classic status !
199;Yet, there are many messages on the value of life and our human existence we can all draw from.
200;But it was just great!
201;Lots of emotions in there, you really start to like the actors (more the persons they are playing).
202;Though it varies in small ways from the book, this Stephen King adaption still gets the message across.
203;Tom Hanks is perfect as the hero, Paul Edgecomb.
204;(Paul is the kind of guy you would want to give a hug every day, because he is just so damned nice.)
205;In fact, all the actors are pretty much perfect for their part.
206;This movie really has multiple plots, with multiple climaxes, which makes it all the more enjoyable.
207;Classic movie that is quite enjoyable.
208;anyways, this movie is very sad, but an excellent story that captures your attention and your heart.
209;I highly recommend everyone to see it.
210;I don't wanna make this a long review, but it's very captivating and everyone does a great job in it.
211;He compassionately uses another human being as a sort of metaphysical barf bag in order to mete out divine justice.
212;and from the same character who says, Boss, I gotta give you a little piece of me . . . .
213;What a gift to give another person .
214;He killed them with their love, they loved each other. . . .
215;Now you see how I feel.
216;That's the way it is every day, that's the way it is every day all over the world.
217;Here is a motion picture that comes along once in a lifetime.
218;This movie is so entertaining, once you see it you want to see it agian.
219;The Green Mile is an unbelievable compilation of great acting, directing, and filming and it has an amazing story to tell.
220;Even though it is a long movie, it is well worth your time.
221;In my estimation this is the best of Steven King's work.
222;Very good acting, with a cast of characters which enhances the story line.
223;Excellent adaptation of Stephen King's book.
224;All the characters are believable and Tom Hanks shines.
225;It takes a little while for you to figure out what is really going on which makes it a great movie.
226;Tom Hanks is always excellent and the other actors did fantastic jobs too.
227;The incredible amount of feeling in this film makes you feel as if you had been a part of the experience that the guards, inmates, and even the warden had been through.
228;I have seen mention of the great performances of a marvelous cast in this movie many times, but I would like to add to that how impressed I was with the performance of Michael Jeter.
229;But the good guys win.
230;And after all of this we still manage to come up with an uplifting ending which, with everything we have been through, I think we deserve.
231;And in places it is a real tear.
232;Definitely well worth watching, and probably a great picture to add to your personal library.
233;This one is definitely a keeper!
234;This show is everything you'd want in a great show!
235;Yes it is a long show, but it is definitly worth it!
236;one of the best movies ever made.
237;Ving and Tom are greart!
238;It has an excellent script, a strong performance by Tom Hanks, and an amazing one by Michal Clarke Duncan.
239;Next time please let him star as a real person.
240;As always a super good movie.
241;we watch this one every few years.
242;acting is superb by all in this picture with a really good story.
243;the book is really good too and the movie follows it quite well.
244;This is an all time great movie, one I consider a classic, and will watch over the years again and again.
245;All the acting is top notch especially the Big Guy Mr. Duncan.
246;I was laughing at parts and then cryiing at others.
247;It explores the horrendous mind of Percy while you're engrossed in watching the heart unfold in Tom Hank's character.
248;John Cofy just broke my heart.
249;It's seems that Stephen King has a favorite filmmaker Frank Darabont which this is his second King adaptation.
250;Following his masterpiece The Shawshank Redemption.
251;If you can withstand a 3 hour running time you are treated with a movie that is funny, touching and brilliant.
252;Tom Hanks is in top form here.
253;Also a great supporting cast.
254;One of the best films of last year and not to be missed.
255;I thought the movie was excellent it kept me on the edge of my seat it was almost like the book and as good as the book.
256;Lots more and this movie have it.
257;As a rule, I steer clear of prison movies but this movie transcends the prison genera.
258;The movie features expert casting, and every actor brings his character to life.
259;An excellent cast, Tom Hanks continues with his string of good movies with another role in another Best Picture Nominee, he delivers a credible performance but he never really gets the opportunity to shine because of the limitations of his character.
260;Which is the exact opposite of Michael Clark Duncan's performance, he gets shine in many scenes, and he plays the key role so convincingly that the movie's success is largely due to him.
261;Darabont is an expert storyteller, when you watch his movies, one gets a sense that he is enjoying a good book.
262;The film succeeds on many levels, and while it is a bit overlong, it delivers the goods.
263;From a scale of 1.10 I give this film an 8!
264;Very few movies live up to the word masterpiece, The green mile does more , it surpasses the term MASTERPIECE, it surpasses the expectation of most of those who chose to watch.
265;The green mile is a movie destined to join the archives as a classic, a movie to watch over and over.
266;Best movie I've watched in many a year.
267;Great story line, great cast.
268;Being a Stephen King fan and loving the book, I had to see this movie.
269;And it was worth it.
270;tom Hanks is remarkable as always, but the real pleasure of this movie was no doubt Michael Clarke Duncan who was incredible.
271;He showed he can cover a wide range of emotions and played the role as perfect as King had written it.
272;there are some gruesome, funny, and lighthearted scenes throughout that make this movie one of the best I have ever seen.
273;This movie is a keeper and I definitely recommend this for all (as long as your of age).
274;This is an absolutely stunning movie: it is WONDERFUL!
275;it is great the way that the storytellers actions click into place by the end.
276;The sting in the tail (or is is tale) stops this from being your everyday miracle movie and the emotion elicited through wonderfully underplayed acting defied my expectations.
277;This movie will fully engage you and unless you like sleeping on a wet pillow, you are best watching this during the day.
278;this is a wonderful story, sad, funny, just like real life.
279;I hope it ranks as highly with you as it has with me.
280;Michael Dunkun is superbly fabulous in this movie along with the obvious tom hanks.
281;This movie touches you in every single way and shows how a white man can rely and trust a black man in a racist society.
282;One forgets that Stephen King can write spiritual and uplifting stories.
283;If you enjoyed that movie then this is the movie for you.
284;Worth purchasing and adding to your collection of movies.
285;This movie is sure to become a classic in the years to come.
286;An outstanding performance by Michael Clarke Duncan.
287;The Green Mile by director Frank Darabont is one of the most adorable movies in history.
288;This prisoner has obviously supernatural gifts, and everything focuses around this strange man and what he does.
289;Great movie, got to see this one.
290;what a great movie top to bottom!
291;I loved the movie but several times during the movie, the movie would suddently stop as if it was scratched then it would start back playing.
292;Stephen King's powerful book was turned into a fantastic, moving, and thought .
293;tom Hanks has always been a constant actor who always delivers.
294;he plays the part perfectly.
295;Many Black actors stick to the same ghetto rules (exceptions being Cuba Gooding Jnr and Denzel Washington) but Michael Clarke Duncan has broken out of this and with his performance in this proves that he can play deep and meaningful characters.
296;sam Rockwell was great in this film.
297;give this film a chance.
298;It seems long and moralistic but there are no evident religious tones to it and the acting, script is done brilliantly.
299;"Well, it can from time to time, but there is also so much beauty in the world that is right front of you
300;Watching The Green Mile, I felt my eyes open as wide as they ever had.
301;I left the movie theater with a new appreciation for everything I was given.
302;Very few movies can make you feel this way.
303;part serial novel of the same name by one of the great authors, Stephen King, Frank Darabont brought another uncommonly powerful work of King's to the screen with such depth and emotional resonance that by the end of the movie, there isn't a dry eye in the house.
304;something miracle of God such as John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan) can?
305;There are many moments in The Green Mile that are worthy of a standing ovation, and one in particular that makes your chin slam into the floor harder than I think most everyone's did at the end of The Sixth Sense, but the soul of the movie lies in the relationship between Hanks and Duncan, whose performance is as much being as it is acting.
306;The ending of the film could've been trite, but there is one thing that saves it: The inspired monologue that gets us to comtemplate our own lives, and what we have done with them.
307;Use your time wisely, watch The Green Mile, and live.
308;The Green Mile is a long heart wrenching movie.
309;It is exceptional with scenes that you will not forget.
310;Tom Hanks is very realistic as are all the characters in this movie.
311;I highly recommend this great movie.
312;I have watched this movie many times and will watch it again.
313;Stephen King, as always, does a great job writing books that are made into movies.
314;Excellent story and fantastic acting and production value.
315;It was one of the most moving and powerful movies that I've seen in a long, long time however.
316;I've seen it 3 times and each subsequent time is better and better.
317;This movie is a must see.
318;the story is, like the Shawshank Redemption, a very uplifting tale.
319;If you really love movies then you will be able to see everything coming ten miles down the road.
320;I remember when the mouse first entered the movie screen I heard a collective Ohhhhhh from the crowd followed by even a few people saying he's so cute.
321;I thought to myself, you saps.
322;This one is kind of a Saving Private Ryan meets Apollo 13 role with a Forrest Gump accent thrown in for good measure.
323;It would so easy to lavish accolades on this movie because it made you misty.
324;tom Hanks Co. did a wonderful job convincing me of their cluelessness.
325;A film should inspire, entertain, educate.
326;overall I give it one star .
327;kneed, and Seinfeld was hilarious and well.
328;This was an excellent movie.
329;The characters played excellent parts, especially Tom Hanks and Michael Duncan.
330;This isn't a movie that chilren should see, because there is violence involved, but I do recommend it to people who enjoy action, drama, and a good tear.
331;Hands down, IMO, the best Tom Hanks movie.
332;And since I'm not one of those who need to see fireworks of action and suspense from the first instant of a movie, that's fine with me.
333;And that's never a good thing.
334;There's no arguing that the solution is quite touching.
335;So finally, a movie worth watching, but there were still a few things that bugged me.
336;In the way they're portrayed, these are good, righteous people that are good friends with the wardens, love a cute mouse and are generally lovable.
337;I understand the novel shed some light on this, and the film could've certainly needed some of this other side of the story to avoid some of the schmaltz.
338;I was genuinely moved at the end and, despite the occasional predictability, the story had its clever moments.
339;I was not expecting what unfolded(I won't spoil it for some of you who have not seen this one), but this is an incredible film experience with a strong cast that includes Gary Sinise and James Cromwell.
340;One of the best films to be set in a prison since Shawshank Redemption(another King masterpiece), but it is more than just a prison picture.
341;the characters were well drawn (allowing for the fact that this story is a fable) and the ending rang true for me.
342;This is an absolutely PERFECT translation of the (half.
343;way) decent Stephen King book to a great and Beautiful movie.
344;Tom Hanks does a fabulous job, and so does the actor playing the Giant John Coffey.
345;And I haven't read the book, and I definitely won't after seeing this movie.)
346;i mean this was the most likable group of death row inmates I've ever seen portrayed on film.
347;All of them were nice and well.
348;mannered and obviously reformed (except Billy the Kid, and he was the most interesting of the lot because of his antics, but that really ain't saying much for his character).
349;rated at even one star.
350;Lets face it, Tom Hanks is one of the best actors ever!
351;This is one of his finest movies.
352;Whoever did the casting for The Green Mile did a heck of a job.
353;If you have read the book, but are hesitant to see the movie, let me encourage you to do so.
354;Frank Darabont's The Green Mile is great in every aspect.
355;The writing directing and performances are all great.
356;The real standout of this film though, is the cast itself.
357;This cast and crew do a great job.
358;the special effects are great.
359;The End gives the viewer something to think about at least it did me.
360;I had read Stephen King's The Green Mile a long while ago and I loved it!
361;I was extremely excited when the movie started.
362;I sat there eating my popcorn, while I was brought back to the world that I visited while reading the book.
363;This is solid filmaking here: great character development, a few laughs, tragic scenes, and over.
364;Mr. Coffey's spiritual intercessions (enhanced by special effects) rivet the flesh with goose bumps.
365;Hanks, as always, is at the top of his game as are the director and producer.
366;The balance of acting is flawless.
367;It had a lot of accurate content and was very entertaining.
368;A Warner Bros. classic derived from a Stephen King novel!
369;Obviously, one of the best jobs for sensitive, motherly guys is prison warden, like the one portrayed by Hanks in the movie.
370;i haven't checked this theory out with other movies yet, but I'm sure this example proves pretty convincingly that Hollywood uses horrorscopes for casting.
371;I finally got to see this film and its great.
372;Paul Edgecomb(Tom Hanks) comes to know a man in prison with a special gift i. e. John Coffey (played by Michael Duncan).
373;The way the film is set up, Paul is a elderly man telling his personal accounts of things that happen during his years at the prison.
374;This is a story about the power of love and the simplicity of faith.
375;The characters are very real and the interwoven stories create a powerful and absorbing movie.
376;Tom Hanks and Michael Clark Duncan were phenominal as well as the rest of the cast was good.
377;The Green Mile is simply one of the best movies I have ever seen!
378;The Green mile was easily the best movie of 1999, and it should have won the Academy Award!
379;When I saw the Shawshank Redemption, I knew that it was the best film I ever seen, and I believed that since then.
380;I believe that The Green Mile is the most important film, the movie industry gave us.
381;And I say this because, as a friend of mine perfectly put it: Anyone who sees Green Mile becames a better man .
382;Having read Stephen King's fantastic serial novel, I had high hopes for the movie.
383;I knew right from the start that it was going to do justice to the book.
384;It will tear your heart out.
385;This film is a very great masterpiece.
386;The story is so engaging.
387;I have read the wonderful novel that this film is based on and the film stays true to it in both spirit and story.
388;It is also well acted, well, shot, and well written.
389;If you love Stephen King films, you will love this.
390;the Green Mile represents death row in a Louisiana prison of the 1930's, when a huge black man, sentenced to death, reveals remarkable powers of precognition and hands.
391;should we also believe that John Coffey, via touch alone, bestowed practical immortality upon Tom Hanks and Mr Jingles?
392;all the actors do a very fine job, but.
393;The book is very nice and well done.
394;The movie itself is a great story and the Video and audio gets perfect 10s.
395;They did such a great job on the restoration of this film.
396;I have no trouble saying that this is probably the best movie I have ever seen.
397;It was intense for the executions, and touching in the parts with Michael Clarke Duncan.
398;Stephen King's novel illustrates the whole storyline a bit better.
399;the book was better then the movie!
400;Hands down, this should have won Best Movie for 1999 (or The Insider).
401;Coffey brings the Magic in the movie.
402;This is a must see movie that is beyond words!
403;I thought this was a really great, sad, comical and interesting story.
404;All the actors were great.
405;Everyone I know who has seen it thought it was really great.
406;It is a very long movie, but definitely well worth your time.
407;It was a perfect blend of the old stories of bad against good, but with a twist.
408;king is a story telling god.
409;i recommend this movie to everyone who loved shawshank!
410;it's a good story and the movie definately did it justice.
411;if you love king.you'll love this adaptation.
412;This is definitely one of Tom Hanks best films, and that is saying a lot.
413;Hanks provides his usual top notch performance, while M. c. Duncan provides a performance that should have won the Oscar.
414;The movie is long, but it is time well spent in a moving and intelligent tale.
415;This is a fabulous interpretation of a Stephen King novel.
416;This is a fantastic film, fantastic all around.
417;I loved it and anyone who can't grasp the meaning And underlying biblical stories will not be able to grasp the movie for what it's worth.
418;Tom Hanks what else is there to say , I enjoy him in every movie he makes , a very powerful actor !
419;Saw this movie in the Cinema and while I was watching it I was in a deep trance for over 3 Hours.
420;It is a brilliant film and Michael Clarke Duncan plays a brilliant part as John Coffey.
421;The film brought tears to my eyes.
422;(More than three seperate nights) I was eager to see it, because our friend had said that if I loved Shawshank Redemption, (which I did) I would love this one more.
423;We sat eyes forward, mostly quiet and at times open mouthed in our amazement about some scenes.
424;This is without a doubt, the absolutely most intense movie I have ever seen.
425;Its a great one to watch just alone or with the whole family.
426;It is an exploration of humanity and injustice and has an element of magic.
427;this is a great film.
428;The characters are well developed and the acting very strong across the board.
429;I found the minimalist cinematography of the Green Mile itself very creative and powerful.
430;This is a story that moved me to tears.
431;some people found the film a bit long, partly due to the fact that most of the film takes place inside of the Green Mile , but I felt that gave the film a chance to develop at its own pace and really allow us to know the characters and either make friends or enemies with them.
432;I also loved the way that I was able to identify with a group of men in an extremely difficult job in very hard times who never loose touch with their humanity.
433;As always, the Green Mile is such a good movie.
434;All of the roles were very well acted.
435;I felt for the characters"
436;if you're looking for a good drama, this will probably satisfy you.
437;Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan deliver incredible performances in this classic.
438;"From Frank Darabont, the director of ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" this is one you will want to own and watch multiple times!"
439;I must be honest and say that I don't understand the harsh reviews about this film.
440;The three hours fly by due to the superb casting, memorable characters and a superior job of directing by an almost unheard of director named Frank Darabond.
441;I don't make comments, but I did love the show.
442;This is an awesome movie .
443;"runs the gamut of emotions
444;Every moment of it is charged with excitement.
445;This is one of the all time great movies.
446;Any other year The Green Mile would have won the Oscar for Best Picture.
447;time brilliant actors, shines again.
448;He is surrounded by an outstanding supporting cast, all of whom steal his spotlight.
449;Director Frank Darabount has topped his masterpiece: The Shawshank Redemption.
450;The Green Mile will make you laugh, cry and amaze you.
451;Frank Darabont's second film since The Shawshank Redemption, another adaptation from a Stephen King story, The Green Mile is concerned with good and evil, hope and resilience against unspeakable odds and the power of the human heart.
452;This is an intense film, finding myself emotionally drained as the last credits rolled, though unmistakably open to the fact that miracles, in one form or another, can an do occur.
453;As the film progresses, we discover that the giant, John Coffey has a special gift, and wonder how such a gentle man with a miracle gift can be a child killer.
454;tom Hanks performance as the head guard, Paul Edgecomb, is subtle and moving, as he begins to realize his own sense of spirit and humanity.
455;The scenes that follow are extraordinary as we witness the power of Coffey and the miraculous transformation of the Warden's wife.
456;aside from Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan's (John Coffey) outstanding performances, the field mouse, Mr. Jingles, stole the show in his many scenes, outsmarting everyone with his tricks and incredible disappearing acts throughout the film.
457;director and writer Frank Darabont surprised the world with his directorial debut The Shawshank Redemption.
458;This is a film one never tires of and can be viewed many times and continue to be inspired by the beauty of the human spirit.
459;hope, resilience and overcoming diversity despite incredible odds.
460;The message in this movie is very moving.
461;The quiet battle between good and evil is something everyone will enjoy.
462;This movie is very good lots of interesting sitsuations.
463;I love John Coffee he is such an inocent man with a big heart and lots of love to give to all and know one understands him.
464;Lots of twists and turns.
465;This is another Tom Hanks movie and I love anything with Tom Hanks
466;It is worth every moment spent watching it.
467;Tom Hanks and Michael Clark Duncan are at their very best in this incredible film.
468;This is one of the greats that you will watch over and over.
469;While I love just about everything about it, the thing that always comes to mind is how perfectly every major role was cast in this film.
470;Tom Hanks was definitely a wonderful choice for the central character.
471;Nobody could be more perfect for the role of the gentle giant that is John Coffey than Michael Clarke Duncan.
472;This is a great movie, of course I love anything with Tom Hanks, but this was a very touching and well done movie.
473;More important: what will it make of us?
474;see this movie and if you're connected to your emotions, you will never think of the death penalty the same way again.
475;the acting in here is outstanding and runs the gamut from well.
476;known actors like Tom Hanks to several unknowns, all having major roles.
477;big Michael Clarke Duncan elevated his career a lot with this role, playing """"John Coffey,"""" a prisoner with strange powers."""
478;With those two exceptions, however, it was nice to finally see prison guards as good guys, something rarely seen since the classic.
479;"michael Jeter, one of those unknown actors, was a lot of fun to watch as ""Eduard Delacroix."
480;Let's put it this way: it gets your attention!
481;One man, however is destined to make a more lasting impression.
482;set on the penitentiary's death row, The Green Mile is an adaptation of what is, in my opinion, one of King's finer stories.
483;It is also, surprisingly, given the subject matter, an uplifting and even heart.
484;"There is a wonderful scene where the guards are shown cleaning and polishing ""Old Sparky"" in preparation for one of the executions and the juxtaposition between this menial housework and the terrible purpose it precedes is spine."
485;this is rated 18 for good reason) are more chilling, even upsetting, than the final act itself.
486;the acting is fine and the cast list is impressive but by no means overwhelming.
487;Hanks does a sterling job as the compassionate and fair.
488;"minded head warder and David Morse fits the role as his second in command ""Brutal"" Howell perfectly."
489;The remainder of the cast includes some that will be familiar to Darabont's fans (Jeffery deMunn, William Sadler) and includes a fair sprinkling of other (perhaps surprising) well known names, such as Michael Jeter and Sam Rockwell.
490;the adaptation to the big screen is done with due reverence to King's novel and the dialogue and plot are exceptionally faithful.
491;all told, this is an absorbing and very enjoyable film.
492;He meets an amazing black man who has a special talent in healing and who really struck me as a good man.
493;The movie is quite long but it is really worth watching.
494;Despite not being a King fan, nor usually in love with 3 hour movies, I found this movie exceptional in its depth, its wonderful, incredible cast, and its delicate handling of such a macabre subject.
495;Hanks is as extraordinary as always, but each member of the cast is just as terrific.
496;What are you waiting for !
497;the most I will say about this movie is that I feel that it was an honor to be able to view such a movie.
498;I thank God that I can hear, see, and feel this movie.
499;This movie was well acted and well directed.
500;Screen favorite Tom Hanks gave another oscar worthy performance (although he wasn't nominated for one) who plays a warden of a prison cell during the days of the Depression.
501;Oscar nominated Michael Clarke Duncan gave a fantastic performance as a prisoner who changes everyone's lives forever.
502;Duncan got robbed of his oscar, in which he definitely deserved (although Osmont from the Sixth Sense deserved it as well), but nonetheless, this is an excellent movie with brilliant actors and a terrific director.
503;The movie is long over 3 hours, but it is really good.
504;This is one of my favorite movies.
505;He won his second award and the academy has just past him off as a solid performer.
506;It would be nice to see the academy return a little love to one of the country's very best talents in his field.
507;an incredible film with a wonderful, and correctly acknowledged, nominated performance by the great and sadly missed Mr. Michael Clark Duncan.
508;A wonder actor and an incredible man.
509;Suprising performances by Barry Peppers and David Morse.
510;as for the story itself, well, I must give it a thumbs up.
511;It's touching, and realistic without being sappy.
512;This movie is powerful: every single person in the packed theatre was weeping.
513;It's a wonderful addition to Stephen King's repertoire.
514;the movie provided some excellent performances.
515;The Green Mile was a great book.
516;The concept of a serial novel was incredibly intriguing.
517;The movie, while the scene was done well, hides much of the detail expressed in the book.
518;also, the ending of the movie skips possibly one of the most moving scenes from the book where the main character describes his wife's death.
519;Here is a movie that is destined to become a classic over time.
520;"The Green Mile is more than just a Stephen King tale (in fact, it's hardly that at all)
521;Another masterful collaboration between King and """"Shawshank Redemption"""" director Frank Darabont, the movie represents some of the best work of everyone involved ."""
522;over the last decade, Hanks has become our greatest living actor.
523;"His work in ""Forrest Gump,"" ""Saving Private Ryan,"" ""Road to Perdition,"" ""Cast Away"" and ""Catch Me If You Can"" proves his name worth mentioning with Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Marlon Brando."
524;"He can effortlessly transform himself into whatever character he plays, yet still remain ""Tom Hanks."""
525;"His best acting may be in ""The Green Mile."
526;Only in his more private moments does he reveal second thoughts about his job, making the character all the more compelling.
527;darabont did a sensational job directing this movie.
528;We feel his relief, and understand pretty much everything he does after that point.
529;The Green Mile contains excellent performances from an expert supporting cast.
530;Michael Clark Duncan deserved his Oscar nomination for his empathetic portrayal of John Coffey .
531;Darabont (and his surrogate Hanks) treats the condemned men with the utmost reverence and respect, allowing each a chance for redemption.
532;an unnaturally extended life .
533;It is worth every minute of its running time, and is now one of my all.
534;He possesses powers to help heal others.
535;i love this movie it's my favorite stephen king movie.
536;it looks and sounds great and you really can see how big jon coffey is.
537;It's hard to come up with what it is about Tom Hanks, but he's got it.
538;We have watched this 4 or 5 times now and it is excellent.
539;(seeing a man cry is just humiliating,you see)This has got to be one of the best movies i've seen in years.
540;Tom Hanks and Michael Clark Duncan are simply great together!
541;Duncan as the gentle giant was so believable and Tom Hanks as the Head Warden played a very humble and likable person in this movie.
542;every single character in this movie was excellent.
543;some characters you're gonna love to death,others you are gonna hate with a passion!Director Frank Darabont really brought these characters to life!
544;It's more fun that way,thats what i did!
545;This movie is unlike any movie you've ever seen.
546;excellent attempt at putting a lump in my throat!
547;i don't want to spoil one miniscule detail of the movie to you,so ill just say this:The acting was some of the best you'll see.
548;the relationships that develop between characters is really good.
549;and, it's funny how they manage some funny jokes into such a sad and dark movie.
550;he has proved to b a excellent actor and director over the past years.
551;this one is right up there with forrest gump
552;Credit has to be given to Frank Darabont for his excellent direction for allowing this story, adapted from a Stephen King novella, to unfold slowly, but not excrutiatingly so, to a satisfying conclusion.
553;Darabont, to his credit, has assembled a first.
554;"The always solid Tom Hanks shines as Paul Edgecomb, the stolid head guard of ""the mile""."
555;dimensional, shines and gives the film it's heart and soul.
556;The Green Mile sure is long but it is well worth an investment of your time.
557;This is one great movie!
558;In addition, the film is so well.
559;"I can honestly say that ""The Green Mile"" is my favorite all."
560;It IS long, but the three hours are filled with hugely moving cinematic material.
561;This is a brilliant, sweeping, stirring motion picture.
562;This was certainly one of the better movies of last year, and it was definately the best highly.
563;touted movies of last year.
564;I enjoyed this one more then I did American Beauty.
565;Everyone in this movie does a great job, especially Micheal Duncan for his role as John Coffy.
566;great performances by everyone made this a very enjoyable movie.
567;It was great, and was one of the few movies I didn't want to see end.
568;The movie was long and somewhat slow at times, but the characters were well developed and the acting was superb.
569;If you watch this movie with your wife, have plenty of tissues ready for use.
570;Indeed, much of King's signature genius lies in weaving together elements of fiction which COULD easily be fact, before injecting a story with a supernatural tone which challenges belief.
571;And director Frank Darabont has done a masterful job of using those truth.
572;"But there's something more, something messianic, about John Coffey
573;rending romance with the doomed innocent, ashamed of ourselves for the fear he inspires in us.
574;king closes It, another of his novels, with a challenge: there are so many happy endings that the man who says he does not believe in God needs to have his rationality called into serious question.
575;In fact, this story, for all of its gut.
576;It is, in essence, a story of Grace and Redemption.
577;Tom Hanks delivers another top notch performance as a prison guard on death row.
578;King is no longer just a master of horror fiction, he has proven he can write a deeply moving story about life, love and friendship.
579;By far his best work to date.
580;This movie is one of the best movie i ever saw.
581;I find it almost impossible to describe how good """"The Green Mile"""" is."""
582;It's a film you simply have to see and experience for yourself.
583;The cast, the writing, the direction, the music, the 1935.
584;they've actually made the miracles performed by the character of John Coffey in this movie seem possible.
585;this is truly an amazing and inspiring motion picture.
586;I'm a richer person for having seen it.
587;This is one great movie that actually works.
588;All the acting is good.
589;The special effects are good.
590;One of the best movies I have ever seen!
591;This movie was so enjoyable.
592;It had supernatural themes, good vs. evil, loving characters, and characters you love to hate!Tom Hanks is very good, as he always is.
593;But my favorite character was the gentle John Coffey.
594;His size made him so intimidating, yet he had the gift to heal.
595;the movie is long, but worth every minute.
596;This movie will bring you lots of tears and a few laughs.
597;Worthy of 5 stars, and worthy of a home collection.
598;One of Tom Hanks' best movies that has alot of simalarities to The Shawshank Redemption.
599;There are a number of good character's in this movie including Prison Guards and Prisoners.
600;I bought it last week and have watched it twice, something I rarely do with a 3 hour movie.
601;Tom Hanks shines in everything I've ever seen him in and this film was no exception.
602;I too was tired of seeing stereotyped prison guards and prison inmates and this movie really crept into the very soul of the viewer.
603;I thought the supporting cast was wonderful.
604;I thought the story was wonderful and a big magical which carried the audience every single minute.
605;I laughed, I cried, I got angry, I felt scared and comforted all within the 3 hours that I sat glued to the screen.
606;Not many movies provoke so many emotions in one setting.
607;I think this is perhaps one of the best movies I have ever seen and I feel Tom Hanks gets better and better with age.
608;Again, the supporting cast was wonderful and well.
609;In my opinion it rates right up there with The Shawshank Redemption which is another of my favorite movies but I don't intend to get the two confused with each other.
610;In fact, i will say that it is one of the best films that I have ever seen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
611;This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.
612;The casting and directing are excellent .
613;This is an oustanding uplifting tale that re.
614;One of the few recent movies that really is a nice adult tale(although it has some tough scenes).
615;This was, no doubt, the most moving film I have ever seen.
616;Sitting in the theater, I was gripped by the realism and compassion of the characters.
617;What some have characterized as spineless in previous reviews, I consider as true human compassion and a reflection of the human spirit even in places as seedy as the prison system.
618;His portrayal of the integrity and honor of the character he played had a tangible effect on me.
619;This is quite possibly the best movie I have ever had the privelege of watching.
620;I am so happy that hollywood din't ruin this great Stephen King series.
621;I loved this movie and every aspect of it.
622;jerking and just the best drama you could ever have the fortune to see.
623;Awesome and flawless in every sense of the word.
624;Makes you laugh, makes you cry and it makes you want to believe.
625;(If you want to spend three hours with some fairly well.
626;and yet allows himself to be led like a sheep to his own pseudo.
627;The world has so little love in it, that he selfishly decides to withhold himself from it.
628;(I think the conversation between Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman in Se7en when their characters were in the bar and talking about apathy is infinitely more interesting and on the mark than the silliness of John Coffey's speech in this movie.)
629;rate this movie, I may be under.
630;It's from the awesome mind of Stephen King.
631;Frank Darabont's second adaptation of a Stephen King prison drama (The Shawshank Redemption was the first) is a very faithful adaptation of King's serial novel.
632;As with King's book, Darabont takes plenty of time to show us Edgecomb's world before delving into John Coffey's mystery.
633;With Darabont's superior storytelling abilities, his touch for perfect casting, and a leisurely 188.
634;minute running time, his movie brings to life nearly every character and scene from the novel.
635;Darabont even improves the novel's two endings, creating a more emotionally satisfying experience.
636;The running time may try patience, but those who want a story, as opposed to quick.
637;fix entertainment, will be rewarded by this finely tailored tale.
638;section of humanity it tried to portray, and basic overall movie.
639;The analogy Stephen King and Frank Darabont attempt to draw has been done in much more interesting and emotionally satisfying and complex ways.
640;As for Frank Darabont, the count is at two strikes.
641;He gets one more try.
642;Tom Hanks has always been an outstanding actor since very early in his career .
643;regardless of being an Oscar winner.
644;and the late Michael Clarke Duncan is just touching, powerful, beyond emotional.
645;He was amazing, and he was the type of actor you felt you knew.
646;One of the best movies ever made.
647;And one of the best conversions of the written word to the screen in recent times.
648;Amazing that this was based on a Stephen King story.
649;It is soon revealed that John Coffey has a gift for healing those in pain, whether physical or emotional, and this revelation leads to an unexpected discovery about the truth about the facts of the crime, and a twist that will leave you breathless.
650;Michael Clarke Duncan gives an uncanny performance as the extremely friendly and soft.
651;Everything in this movie is perfectly rounded, created so that in the end, everything ties up together in a glorious package of revelations and truths about life.
652;On another high note, the film remains ever.
653;so true to the novel, remaining one of the finer book.
654;This film will remain one of the best films ever made in history, and is, by far, one of the greatest achievements for all those involved in its making.
655;The real star of this Stephen King adaptation is director Frank Darabont, who weaves a powerful, fascinating story that effortlessly eats three hours of the clock.
656;spoken man with a miraculous gift, a gift so selfless the viewer immediately knows John Coffey isn't guilty of the horrible crime he's alleged to have committed.
657;by the director's storytelling ability.
658;The Green Mile directed by Frank Darabont who delivered us The Shawshank Redemption manages to bring us another great prison movie, which is anything but what you'd expect.
659;the film is superb in its character development.
660;So rarely anymore does a film succeed in making you honestly care about (or despise) its characters in a couple of short hours.
661;A triumph in character development which was a pleasure to experience.
662;He managed to portray Coffey so perfectly that his character positively fills the theatre.
663;"David Morse is also applaudable as ""Brutal"" Howell, a guard with similar beliefs and kindness as Edgecomb."
664;So watch it, but make sure you have tissues at hand.
665;fast shipping tape is in excellent shape will by from this person again
666;and as for happy scrappy hero mouse .
667;A great family movie and treasured heirloom.
668;It was very entertaining, and was in great condition.
669;One of the best movies ever.
670;Our family has watched it numerous times and still love the show.
671;This one's an absolute classic and for anyone who likes severe drama this is one you'll be glad you bought.
672;Where have you ever seen such lovely death row inmates before!
673;His character also has the mystical power to heal people.
674;but the supporting actors are outstanding in their own right.
675;All around, every performance is flawless.
676;this is a great movie.
677;A compelling look into the lives of men on death row and the circumstances which brought them to prison.
678;One, a gentle giant possesses the gift of clairvoyance and healing.
679;His innocence, and gift is recognized by a few compassionate prison guards and the prison warden whose sick wife is cured by his efforts.
680;Tom Hanks and a superb cast make this film believable.
681;It is an intense, alternately cruel and beautiful production.
682;"Tom Hanks, David Morse and their buddies are all real good, upstanding folks
683;That particular look, in fact, is the number one expression in the movie, and everybody gets a shot at it.
684;And with those Godawful """"Southern"""" accents, he must have done much the same."""
685;Although camera shots do not linger on the victims, each execution is conveyed with real emotion.
686;"For all its flaws, The Green Mile is worth watching
687;If however you are a human being who has considered his mortal plight and shares in the author's desire to ask the big questions, you Must see this.
688;Every moment was used effectively to draw us deeper into this strange and wonderful story.
689;One of the most engrossing and beautifully crafted films I've ever seen.
690;The Green Mile is one of the best adaptions of a Stephen King novel to date.
691;A great story that unfolds like you are reading a book with well developed characters who aren't just black or white or good or bad.
692;The cast including Tom Hanks (in one of his best performances) Michael Clarke Duncan, David Morse, Barry Pepper, Patricia Clarkson, Bonnie Hunt and a cast of top notch character actors including Sam Rockwell, Doug Hutchison and Michael Jeter are all in top form here.
693;For those who have never seen the Green Mile (Its been around since the late 80's) I suggest you give it a try.
694;The acting without exception is superb as is the story.
695;The story is driven by its well.
696;designed and slightly quirky plot, but even more so by the various characters,as acted by an ensemble headed by Tom Hanks.
697;Take a chance and I think you'll be very pleased that you did.
698;This movie is a very Stephen King kind of a movie.
699;Several people who are faced with a unique scenario.
700;In this case, several wardens, who receive into their care a huge prisoner, a gentle giant who happens to have strange and unique powers.
701;I love to watch movies and am very picky about having a favorite.
702;This movie was excellent from the get.
703;I highly recommend this film and promise you will recommend it to others as I am now.
704;The story line and actors are top notch.
705;This is one of Tom Hank's best movies.
706;The touching of the heart and dignity the guards showed was amazing.
707;Even a movie in a prison environment proved that Paul Edgecomb as well as those under him respected the prisoners rights right till """"Ol' Sparky"""" took their lives."""
708;Good, kind and respectable men just a wonderful movie .
709;One of Tom Hank's finest movies, has a wonderful trama, when I started watching I never imagine were the storie was going, was just fantastic, a genious movie from beginning to end.
710;Tom Hanks,Michael Duncan Clarke, Barry Pepper and David Morse are excellent.
711;it's also one of the few movies even the most macho guys may shed a tear at!
712;tom Hanks starring and did a fantastic job.
713;The electrocution scenes were a bit intense,but,true.
714;every character in this movie did an outstanding job.
715;well worth the money.You will never forget this movie.
716;"Got it for a gift for a retired guy
717;The blue ray version is so cool"
718;I definitely recommend this movie with 5 stars.
719;____ was soo sweet and funny.
720;The story could have existed without the supernatural, but the supernatural in it is so, well, natural, that it becomes maybe the best of King's stories that have been filmed.
721;While the movie is long, it never seems to drag, so good is the story.
722;I won't give it away here, but it is so wonderful, so immense that nobody, not even the inmate, quite comprehends what it is.
723;I will not reveal it, but it manages to touch everyone it surrounds, both positively and negatively.
724;the acting in this movie is superb by everyone involved.
725;But even bigger credit must be given to Doug Hutchison.
726;I love him so much and the supporting cast was just wonderful.
727;Great story line, great dialogue, great scenes, memorable characters, just superb!
728;definitely a must see for everybody!Soon to be classic.
729;well this is an awesome movie first off yes it does not follow the movie exactly but it is faithful to the heart of the story, however when i received my own copy of this from amazon disc 1 was actually labeled as disc 2 luckily i checked before i sent it back to amazon.
730;This movie was a monster (3 hours long) but man o man was it excellent.
731;Michael Clark Duncan's depiction of John Coffey was mind blowing and most of the script came right out of the Stephen King novel.
732;It was a great movie but I recommend that you read the book before watching it.
733;Shipped fast and in great condition.
734;Its pretty emotional and you need to be paying attention when you watch it.
735;The story itself was captivitaing enough without the help of an excellent cast.
736;Tom Hanks delivering his usual best, Michael Duncan's performance was awesome.
737;The rest of the prison guards were captivating as well, notably the Percy Wetmore character.
738;"a story with twists and turns and suspense
739;a thoughtful, sometimes meandering pace through the characters' lives.
740;i assure you, by the final scene, all questions will be tidely wrapped up in logical.
741;But even more worthwhile is the walk down The Green Mile.
742;Though the guards of this death row seem at times a bit soft and sentimental, they are portrayed and acted superbly.
743;Their insecurities and foibles endear them to us, save one whom we come to despise.
744;Therein lies the heart of this story.
745;Facing the electric chair, one inmate wonders if, in death, he'll have the chance to go back to best moments of his life.
746;Played with deceptive ease by a hulking, muscle.
747;stacked black actor, Coffey leads us through a series of supernatural encounters that show his ability to bring healing and justice to the world around him.
748;Coupled with this ability is his insight into people's hearts and situations.
749;The director, and Stephen King's writing, keep us sympathetically on his side while still flirting near the edge of doubt.
750;Darabont directs us patiently through the story and lets us finish the journey winded but better for the wear.
751;Perhaps it's because Durabont's previous movie (The marvelous, un.
752;This movie showcases an all around exceptional cast.
753;Even Graham Greene and Gary Sinise make significant impact in their limited roles.
754;the acting, direction, casting, sets, and locations were all excellent.
755;Michael Clarke Duncan's performance as John Coffey is overwhelming"
756;Tom Hanks, James Cromwell, David Morse, and Michael Jeter all turn in great performances as well.
757;King's horror devotees won't find his usual style here, but those who loved The Shawshank Redemption will be very pleased.
758;There's a bit between Hanks and Duncan in Coffey's cell during which Hanks is almost entirely off.
759;winning performance, and he's not even on.
760;He's giving Duncan everything possible to make his performance as real as possible.
761;That brought tears to my eyes as well .
762;Tom Hanks is truly extraordinary.
763;The Green Mile is a deeply touching story, brought to vivid life by this great cast and crew.
764;There is the best and the worst of humanity in here, and each extreme leaves a lasting impression.
765;The best 3 hours I spent watching a movie I mean from beginning to end the movie was well done.
766;Tom Hanks of course delivered a great performance as well as the other actors.
767;I have never in my life loved a movie more.
768;Understanding what you are about to watch before you cozy up with a large bowl of buttered popcorn is very important.
769;His sidekick, David Morse is absolutely thrilling!
770;Michael Clark Duncan carries the show with his awesome acting ability as John Coffey.
771;I agree totally with another reviewer, who in the world CAN'T love this movie!
772;We are entertained the whole movie through.
773;Big thumbs up for Stephen King and the Green Mile!!!
774;This movie is very well done in nearly every detail.
775;"The acting is smooth and crisp
776;Filming is excellent as is the use of light and dark, close.
777;well worth seeing and owning.
778;All I can say is it really held my interest, and I liked it so much I now what to read the book after seeing the movie.
779;I saw this moving in the cinema, I was amazed then, wonderful acting and excellent story.
780;I would recommend this movie to anyone, there is laughter, there are tears.
781;It is definitely a MUST SEE MOVIE.
782;Stephen King knows how to spin a yarn.
783;This is another terrific adaptation of a King novel that delivers a bittersweet story of a depression era Louisiana prison on the death row cell block.
784;It presents numerous interesting character studies that induce strong emotions for the various characters.
785;There is also a lot of irony here with good guys who are evil and bad guys who are good.
786;darabont again does a superlative job of creating the right mix of drama, imagery and human interest.
787;the acting was outstanding by all.
788;Tom Hanks turns in another great performance as the tough but kind cell block boss.
789;Hanks continues to show his versatility, excelling in both dramatic and comedic roles and moving effortlessly between them like a chameleon.
790;David Morse mirrored Hanks as another tough guy with a heart and played the part nicely.
791;Michael Clarke Duncan engendered a very sensitive and lovable nature to his character, making the contrast between his demeanor and physiognomy all the more striking.
792;overall, a well crafted film and an excellent story that suffered slightly from excessive length.
793;Great film about the people who work on Death Row and one very special inmate they encounter.
794;It has a surprise ending.
795;The Green Mile is an exceptional movie about love, hope, hate, despair and transformation.
796;If you haven't seen this movie yet get it and sit back and enjoy.
797;Best movie I've ever seen.
798;This was an excellent Film.
799;Tom Hanks is outstanding in this film.
800;I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good movie.
801;This is hands down the best movie I have ever seen.
802;Tom Hanks does a great job (as always) and Doug Hutchison (Percy) also does a good job of making you hate him.
803;Another reason why Stephen King is the best.
804;Keep up the good work!
805;This is one amazing movie.
806;When John COffey comes in he is a huge inmate but is a gentle giant who is even afraid of the dark.
807;As the movie goes on we see John's secret powers.
808;From the Director of Shawshank Redemption comes another classic movie about life in prision.
809;In this case the twist is a New Age experience.
810;It was quite an excellent movie and the best part was the acting.
811;All of the characters really came to life and you loved them or hated them.
812;All of the prisoners await their journey.
813;Some are quite likable people.
814;It seems like a pretty simple setting but a lot of drama is involved in the dynamics of the situation and this is the best movie in which I've ever seen Tom Hanks.
815;The acting, direction and filming are all first rate.
816;pocus of the miraculous healings.
817;This type of supernatural nonsense tainted an otherwise outstanding movie, in my opinion.
818;star effort on the part of all concerned.
819;With a good team of good men with the exception of the hateful Percy Wetmore .
820;it is a remarkable movie.
821;It does the heart good.
822;Tom Hanks was great once again in a great movie.
823;This movie had great acting,great plot,and a cool mouse named Mr. gingles.
824;Probably one of the most sensitive, beautiful stories written by Stephen King.
825;The movie was basically true to the book, with the exception of the ending.
826;Just make sure you have plenty of Kleenex on hand!
827;The movie, The Green Mile, based on the seriel story by Stephen King, was one of the best adaptations of his work I've ever seen.
828;The movie moved along at a steady pace and pulled you into the story without grabing you by the throat.
829;All the characters were well acted and believeable.
830;Other things about the story gave you a sense of good feeling over all, let you cry a little when John Cofey died, and a smile on your face at the film's end.
831;The Green Mile is definately a five star film and one of the best of 1999.
832;The book is really brilliant, but I'm of the opinion that the movie did the unthinkable and actually improved on it.
833;Although the movie is really brilliant, the book is better.
834;Still, it's worth every dollar and every minute.
835;It made me laugh, made me cry, and touched my soul.
836;A very, very good piece of story telling, full of human emotions"
837;If you haven't yet seen this movie, please do.you will love it.
838;Watched it while I worked out on the treadmill.
839;I first seen this movie on the recommendation of my mom.
840;This is a must see movie.
841;The price was also great.
842;Should have been a better, more uplifting ending.
843;Great performances by the entire cast.
844;One of those movies you'll watch time and again.
845;Can you imagine melding a little furry mouse, a huge hulking beast of a man, into a wonderfully woven magical tale, and your name is NOT Disney ?
846;natural master author, Stephen King, has a gift unsurpassed by few if any among modern day writers.
847;one of the finest films made.
848;king's gift brings us this mysterious story of a man, John Coffey, who is wrongly imprisoned for the hideous murders of two small girls.
849;He has a gift too.
850;And when the guards learn of this, they use this wonderfully strange force in miraculous ways.
851;Hanks et al were well cast, and the electric chair room shots were extremely intense.
852;Either way, The Green Mile is rich, textural, heart.
853;wrenching and just makes us want to protect all beasts, large and small.
854;thank you for your interest comment votes.
855;Tom Hanks is one of my favorite actors but I have to say that Michael Clark Duncan stole the show for me on my second viewing.
856;This has got to be one of the best pieces of film ever.
857;THe splendor of it is beyond belief.
858;John Coffey was so touching that it would bring anyone close to tears.
859;This has got to be my favourite film ever!
860;All I can say is it as the most ingenious piece of film ever.
861;Steven King is a master of combining the supernatural with the human element.
862;In The Green Mile (as in The Stand) you end up with a cast of very unique, individual and interesting personalities along with quite a few jump.
863;seat surprises (reminiscent of the X Files) thrown in!
864;(And a word of warning: The scenes with Old Sparkey are grippingly real)!
865;"As the story slowly unfolds, we learn that John Coffey has a secret
866;The casting in this movie is excellent"
867;"This is definitely a movie you must see
868;Be patient at first, though"
869;In an attempt to instill a glimmer of realization into these prisoners' lives, renowned author Stephen King has once again emerged with a thrilling and touching film, The Green Mile, which centralizes on the life of a wrongly convicted man.
870;How true this is, especially in the context of the film.
871;For a majority of people, it is difficult to imagine an individual on death row to possess or display such pure, unadulturated love and fascination toward such a simple organism as a mouse.yet this holds true in the film.
872;First of all, I thought everyone gave an outstanding performance .
873;Their performances were the most moving in my opinion.
874;Other than that, I enjoyed the movie.
875;In conclusion, THE GREEN MILE was a very touching movie.
876;I think it contains an important message about human nature.
877;this is a terrific film and this special edition has nice pictureand sound plus neat extras.
878;Had seen this movie at the theater but watched it again on TV and it was so good I wanted my sister to see it.
879;"The ""Green Mile"" is a triumph as an incredible story and an incredible movie that tells that story."
880;The actors all share equally in the strength and emotional impact of the storytelling.
881;"Tom Hanks is ostensibly the lead character, but you feel that all of the characters are critical to the story
882;Each time it has delivered a deep and emotional experience.
883;They were outstanding and the movie is just as good.
884;Tom Hanks is literally the perfect person for the role,and this movie proves that even Stephen King has a soul, and it can be sentimental.
885;This is one of the most powerful and brutal movie you'll come across as the story goes on in the worst jail based in the 30s.
886;The greatness of this movie and ending scenes are exhilerating and a bit confusing, but in other words this is a must see if you've already watched a movie called Shawshank Redemption.
887;this was one of my all time favourites and the type you'd want to watch over and over, a classic.
888;Every performance in the movie was an excellent one.
889;The movie was also the best of the year.
890;Tom Hanks played Paul Edgecomb masterfully and he and Duncan gave the movie heart.
891;From the first frame right through the final cut, The Green Mile is an astonishingly powerful, suspensefully crafted picture that is extremely hard to fault.
892;He pulls off a brilliant showcase with Tom Hanks, who has stunning screen prescense.
893;I didn't mind it, and it has such a high level of intrigue and utter superbness that 3 hours will feel like 1 to you too.
894;It was very moving in some place.
895;Great movie and of course Steve Hanks is at his best in this movie.
896;very emotional and moving, i loved this and am considering adding it to my permanent collection very soon
897;One of the top 5 books I've ever read, and I read a lot.
898;I just love this movie, and Tom Hanks' acting is phenominal.
899;This movie is silly, funny, romantic, dramatic, human and overall and above all shows great performances by a select group of actors.
900;I still think this is one of the best and most original movies of the year.
901;It is deep in character development, and has several storylines running throughout.
902;The acting in The Green Mile is excellent, and Tom Hanks once again puts in a memorable performance, putting further behind him the days of Bosom Buddies and Bachelor Party.
903;Oh well, he gets his in the end.
904;If you get The Green Mile, I recommend you be well rested and be prepared for some serious character and plot development.
905;this entire movie shows the genius available in American film making.
906;After hearing several mixed reviews about this film, I finally viewed it on VHS recently.
907;the leads give fine performances all around, and newcomer David Morse makes an indelible impression as a sociopathic guard who is far more dangerous than anyone who is locked up on the Green Mile.
908;Kudos go also to Michael Clarke Duncan, who manages to radiate dignity even while portraying essentially a freak.
909;This stands in sharp contrast to the earlier Shawshank Redemption , another King work also directed by Frank Darabont, which I can watch again and again for the real human drama it contains.
910;From all standpoits, this picture means a complex and deep sociological approach about the human behavior.
911;a prison represents the background "
912;"Obviously Percy represents the nazi spirit 
913;but notice than much more than a political movement the nazism works out here as a living style.
914;the punishment for him it's excellent "
915;The mouse gag is a very ingenious clue.
916;A prisioner will experiment a twist of fate with this pet.
917;Slowly the curtains will reveal the awful truth and you as viewer will be reflected in the moral jury who observes the execution.
918;"notice by moments the film reminds us to a great picture of the same age (1935) , casually titled ""Fury"" of Fritz Lang ."
919;"The extrordinary picture Top Hat in which we watch to Fred Astaire dancing with Ginger Rogers is a touch of genius device that let introduce us and links the last will of Coffey 
920;Frank Dubont made a very well done work with the camera , art direction , photography, cast and enlightment.
921;the smart ending is filled with sweetness "
922;"this film and the wisperer's horse were the finest achievements in 1998 
923;It's a great movie and covers just about all of the aspects that are in the book.
924;This movie will touch you and, while quite sad, it makes you sort of take a reflective view of your own life and the inevitable end of that life.
925;All of the acting talent here is top shelf.
926;Michael Clarke Duncan, as John Coffey, delivers a truly powerful performance that's equal to Tom Hanks, who turns in yet another of his many memorable turns, as prison guard Paul Edgecomb.
927;The supporting players are equally wonderful .
928;Even though his onscreen time in The Green Mile is brief, he demonstrates what a great actor he truly was.
929;And with over 300 film and TV appearances in his 50+ year career, at least we have many wonderful opportunities to catch a glimpse of this fine, underrated actor.
930;ray for The Green Mile is well put together: the colors are rich, the focus is sharp and the audio is crisp, clear and nicely balanced.
931;The disc includes a handful of cool bonus goodies to go along with the feature film.
932;5 stars for this moving human drama story.
933;The cast of The Green Mile deliver an outstanding performance in the movie.
934;This is a must see for those who have yet to see this movie classic.
935;A very, very good film.
936;About a miracle man up for execution, you guessed it, he didnt do it.
937;Tom Hanks and David Morse do a great job.
938;See this, you wont soon forget.
939;The complaint that this is Shawshank Redemption, Part II, is valid.
940;Tall, innocent gentle man who retains his sense of dignity and hope.
941;Stephen King always has these mythical treatises on good versus evil.
942;And Mr. Darabont knows how to yank on your heart and, in the midst of a bleak situation, pull out the humanity and humor.
943;Both men are truly good storytellers"
944;this is ensemble acting at its best.
945;Although Tom Hanks, again, plays his part convincingly and Michael Clarke Duncan fills the screen figuratively whenever his limited lines appear, you must give a nod to the other actors: Brutal, Dell, Wild Bill , etc.
946;hanks has come a long way since playing a woman in Bosom Buddies and I hope for Michael Duncan Clarke that this is a breakthrough role.
947;The Green Mile is one of the best movies ever to be made plus one of the better novels written by Steven King.
948;But I was so touched by the emtional draw to the movie because there are people out there that can preform miracles because of the the gifts God gives his followers.
949;I also enjoy the fine acting job Tom Hanks did on this movie proves he is quite the actor and can bring the character to life very well.
950;Each character comes through with great presence and individual personality .
951;Still, each character seems just right and Michael Duncan gives an Oscar type performance.
952;and yet, he too, did a wonderful job exuding a squirming, low.
953;I will remember this movie for my life.
954;This one of the best movies.
955;It arrived quickly and packaged very well.
956;I also revived the digital version free!
957;It was a powerful, sincere, and extraordinary movie.
958;Stephen King is a master storyteller.
959;And the director and actors did a superb job, all of them.
960;john Coffey was one of the greatest characters in the movies last year.
961;A representation of human kindness, which I think is rare these days.
962;I like both movies a lot.
963;this movie is a good way to feel better about life and people.
964;He Tom Hanks is also one of my favorite actors.
965;highly recommend to family and friends.
966;The Green Mile was a breathtaking movie about a prison in Louisiana during the depression.
967;John Edgecomb (Hanks) is the compassionate, yet tough death row supervisor.
968;The Green Mile is a very long movie, however it allows for the excellent character development and storytelling.
969;For the entire movie I was riveted and had a wide array of emotions.
970;The movie had a strong collection of supporting actors and one mouse!!
971;The Green Mile was the best adaptation of a Steve King novel and I felt it was better than Shawshank Redemption.
972;The acting was VERY good, the people who portrayed the main persons did a wonderful job.
973;Spellburg got the best there was to be in movie.
974;That film is a masterpiece.
975;So he centers his tale on the emotional level of this experience and he uses all the symbols he can in the pictures.
976;John Coffey (JC, like another one) is huge and powerful.
977;He embodies the simpleness of nature, of a true miracle, though we do not know if he is a miracle of nature or of God.
978;The film also shows so beautifully that men do not do evil for the sake of evil, but that they are moved into doing that by their fears, their ambitions, their mediocrity or the system that engulfs them in order for them to survive, to eat and drink and sleep and have a little of comfort.
979;The actors really give some density to the characters.
980;John Coffey is the most convincing living human and humane miracle we can imagine.
981;Mr Jingles finally is the most extraordinary pet we can imagine : brilliant, intelligent, sensitive, a marvel of animal grace and beauty.
982;This film is naturally a direct allusion to our world.
983;It shows the true colors of love, hatred, fear and death that all roam among us like so many skeleton in our cupboards and cabinets, even if it is love.
984;The Green Mile was the absolute best movie for the 1999 season.
985;I would advise you to leave the kids home, though, but you will surely enjoy it.
986;Great film, very good story line and full of surprises keeps you glued to your TV, a film too watch over and over again.
987;King is the best, simply the best!!
988;I recomend this movie because it is just the best.
989;This is probably the best movie adaptation of a Stephen King novel that exists.
990;Character development is very accurate and the story is told in an enticin and almost chilling way.
991;evil, it is suspenseful and mysterious.
992;One of my favorite movies.
993;Tom hanks is great in this movie.
994;This is a faithful adaptation of the Stephen king book.
995;The supporting cast worked in an ensemble.
996;Mouse was an interesting device and cleverly becomes central to the film's development direction.
997;Race issue nicely downplayed and treated in an adult manner.
998;Makes for a good library movie.
999;Not that I like to watch repeats but this is worth a second look.
1000;The Green Mile is by far the best movie i've ever seen.
1001;there is everything in this movie from drama, to action, to comedy.
1002;i've seen the movie 8 times and read the book once and Tom Hanks and Micheal Clarke Duncan did a great job portraying their roles.
1003;I enjoy watching this movie because it takes some bad and brings the good to the forefront.
1004;The big wholesome chap is good as he is childlike and asexual.
1005;If you enjoyed the book by Stephen King, you'll like the movie.
1006;Overall, a wonderful story and outstanding acting from the whole cast.
1007;This is one of my favorite movies, Tom Hanks at his best, Stephen King at his best, and Michael Clarke Duncan, WOW.
1008;I'd read the book months ago and it was excellent.
1009;Whoever presided over the casting of this film deserves an Oscar.
1010;This film will be as much a classic as Citizen Cane or any other film we deem worthy of the honor today.
1011;I dreamed you were wandering in the dark, and so was I.
1012;And if you've ever been one of the wanderers, you know how important that is.
1013;Great story great movieall actors are amazing you will feel every sceneROLLERCOASTER ride all the way to the end
1014;Frank Darabont's adaptation of The Green Mile was one of last year's best films.
1015;The supporting cast is also solid, especially Micheal Clarke Duncan and David Morse.
1016;This is filmmaking at its very best.
1017;Great actors and great story.
1018;one of Stephen King's best stories on film.
1019;for those who criticize the movie because they claim the book is better of course the book is better to you because when you read a story you are able to create the scenes to your liking.
1020;I thought that The Green Mile was a wonderful story.
1021;He gentle character represented the innocence of a child and the supernatural aspect of the story represented the gift that was bestowed upon him to share with others to show humanity and forgiveness.
1022;I was very surprised when I saw this movie, directed by John Darabont and starring Tom Hanks and the remarkable, larger than life, Michael Duncan.
1023;I found it to be very engrossing, well written, and beautifully acted.
1024;His quiet, strong portayal of a man with character, working on Death Row, confronted by daily decisions and inexplicable occurrences is perfect.
1025;Consistently he proves how skilled he is at portraying a character as a real person, with a heart, guts, an actual life.
1026;He gives this movie, with its improbable plot, the strength to anchor the tale and save it from going adrift into a sea of confusion and mysticism.
1027;In this task he is assisted by the ensemble cast, all of them, the good guys AND the bad guys.
1028;And what a piece of work Michael Duncan is!
1029;He has the most expressive face I have seen on the screen in a long time.
1030;i will remember scenes from this movie for a long time, I expect.
1031;If you like stories like The Green mile and stories about jail time, this is the movie for you to see it tells all about this guy who worked for the prison system and really has a long story to tell about his experiences and all.
1032;So if you want to see something good like this movie, This is the one for you.
1033;master Stephen King, I expected it to be a bit more on the scary side than it actually ended up being.
1034;In fact I found it to be easily one of the best movies I saw in 1999.
1035;which amazingly has a rather large roll in the movie.
1036;to easily the biggest man I have EVER seen all works together to make 'The Green Mile' an incredible journey which on more than one occasion had me thinking long and hard at the death penalty.
1037;when in reality he was actually trying to HEAL them.you see John has an interesting ability to cure people of their ills.
1038;Time just stood still as I watched this fantastic movie.
1039;I enjoyed this movie so much I actually went out and bought the book (which actually IS better, but what book isn't?)
1040;and I also found a whole new view of Stephen King.
1041;Do NOT let this movie being written by him keep you from a true masterpiece.
1042;Simply put great filmmaking with each character pulling in a great performance.
1043;Oh, and even though the book was better, I think they did an incredible job of turning it into a movie.
1044;This movie is very touching and the cast is brilliant especially Michael Clarke Duncan.
1045;Not very many movies can be as touching as this one!
1046;It never fails, cast Tom Hanks and it is destined to be a great movie.
1047;The Green Mile is no exception, an outstanding drama that keeps you watching despite its longevity.
1048;Then one day, a new prisoner who is a gentle giant in every sense of the word, is brought over, played well by Micheal Duncan.
1049;Edgecomb discovers Coffey's amazing gift first with the other guards realizing it later.
1050;Of course, they can't and it leads to an emotional rollercoaster at the end that will bring tears to anyone who has a heart.
1051;Coffey is a gentle giant who brings a sense of spirit and humility to his fellow inmates and guards.
1052;He also possesses supernatural powers which he uses for the good of his fellow man.
1053;While awaiting execution, he magically transforms death row into an area of caring and compassion.
1054;Even Warden Moores' wife, who is suffering from a terminal brain tumor, is healed by Coffey's magical touch.
1055;Coffey also uses his special powers to show Edgecomb that he is really innocent of the charges against him.
1056;this is an excellent movie.
1057;rate, and the acting, led by Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan, is outstanding.
1058;The execution scenes are carried out with remarkable realism, as well.
1059;Based on the novel by Stephen King, the movie is actually better than the book was.
1060;I was impressed with the relationship that developed between Coffey and the guards and how their friendship deepend until the final scene, where the guards are openly crying while carrying out Coffey's final wish.
1061;I give this film my highest recommendation.
1062;Rather, it is one that will touch your soul and uplift your spirit.
1063;Watch and see how a gentle giant uses his powers to help others while unselfishly sacrificing himself.
1064;When the theater lights dimmed and the previews were over, this gem of a film began.
1065;This is a very strong and beautiful film that is very well acted, but after watching, you may become depressed.
1066;I have to admit that I did like Shawshank better simply because it was more uplifting, but this film is still great.
1067;Tom Hanks fits the roll and does a wonderful job.
1068;I think the movie is a masterpiece in film making, story, character presentation and thought provoking philosophy.
1069;I found that to be true of this .
1070;John Coffey represents the power available to those who believe .
1071;Stephen King is so good at what he does and the film is amazing.
1072;I gave it for a Christmas gift.
1073;I watched this movie at the recommendation of a friend and I am glad I did.
1074;A while back, in 1997, I believe, I read all six serial installments of The Green Mile by Stephen King and loved it!
1075;This was better than I thought it would be!
1076;This is the second best movie ever to me, right after Meet Joe Black, but very close!
1077;The plot to this movie is great.
1078;I read the books, and most movies don't stay true to books but I was proud of this one.
1079;The characters, their actors, and the plot was very true to form.
1080;It's a bit of a long watch, but once you start into it, you get captivated and then time will fly.
1081;Great movie, classic Tom Hanks.
1082;Great story line and actors.
1083;All I have to say is for those people that complain about the movie being 3 hours.
1084;It delves into the characters and brings them to life as King does in every book.
1085;Hanks shines as he has in recent past, and the rest of the cast elevates this film to another level.
1086;But Green Mile definitely rocks the house!
1087;I wish I could give this one more than five stars.
1088;This is one of the few movies that I have liked more than the book.
1089;All the actors turned in great performances and the direction was some of the best I've seen.
1090;This is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen!
1091;For such an incredibly wonderful and breathtaking movie.
1092;Whoever created this version of such a fabulous movie, erred egregiously.
1093;But overall, it's a great movie and worth the time (3 hours) as well as money.
1094;"The superb acting by all involved compensates admirably for most of these things
1095;Overall, this is a film about true magic .
1096;the magic of the human spirit even under dire circumstances.
1097;As such it is an admirable achievement by all involved.
1098;An exceptional movie, combining the literary genius of Stephen King,augmented by the acting of Tom Hanks and an array of talented role players, led by Mr. Coffey,(Michael Duncan).
1099;A towering figure of a man, Cofffey is a faith healer in the truest non.
1100;He also has the powers to allow others to see that he is a good man,plus the capability of removing the two biggest scoundrels in the film with comparative ease.
1101;tears on the guards' faces indicate the power he's held over them,up until and after his electrocution.
1102;He is a giant of a man and everybody believes that he must have done it but Paul begins to wonder if it is true.
1103;He also has special powers that manifest themselves in front of the eyes of the death row guards.
1104;this is a superb story that has been brought to the media of film in a perfect way.
1105;The casting for the actors in this movie was one of the best I have ever seen.
1106;The acting is astounding and the entire cast is perfect for their roles.
1107;this is an outstanding movie and if you like Stephen King you will absolutely love this movie!
1108;it has great performances in it.
1109;i cried at the end.
1110;micael clarke duncan is great.
1111;I have seen this movie more than once and enjoy it every time.
1112;A wonderful story, well written and beautifully acted.
1113;The cast was top notch too.
1114;this last time I viewed it was via Amazon streaming and it worked perfectly with no delays or any other technical problems.
1115;Dead Man Walking This is an all time favorite of mine.
1116;well NOTHING like this movie actually is.
1117;this movie will open your heart, break your heart,open your mind and eyes and touch your soul.
1118;They did a fantastic job making this movie.
1119;Steven King outdid himself, the actors outdid themselves as well as the producers of the movie.
1120;The Green Mile is a great movie adaptation of the Stephen King book.
1121;Both my husband and I enjoyed this movie.
1122;Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan were great choices to play these two particular characters in the book.
1123;director Frank Darabont adapts Stephen King's story for the screen, choosing to let the characters and plot gently unfold at a leisurely pace .
1124;thus creating a splendid example of visual story.
1125;Tom Hanks, as the tale's narrator, once again demonstrates his incredible generosity as an actor"
1126;It's nice to see him reunited with Gary Sinise ( Forrest Gump ) and Barry Pepper ( Saving Private Ryan ), and his scenes with the wonderful Michael Clarke Duncan give the movie its emotional heart.
1127;Great work is also turned in by Michael Jeter as the sympathetic Del, Doug Hutchison as a wormy guard, and Patricia Clarkson as the woman who receives a miracle.
1128;"Worth seeing for the performances alone, the film also offers a wonderful blend of drama, mystery, and fantasy
1129;The film to video transfer cannot be faulted"
1130;And there are some great bonus features, including the theatrical trailer and a short production documentary (make sure you watch this all the way to end .
1131;or you'll miss a great comedic payoff).
1132;Bought it for Mom for Christmas!
1133;The movie is great, and the delivery was excellent.
1134;I thought that even though they did not follow the book exactly they did an excellent job on the movie.
1135;one excellent movie but it did not work it skipped in all the players i had so i got a refund
1136;The GREEN MILE is one of 1999's best films with fine performances from all the leads.
1137;Every once in a while a movie comes along that reminds you of why you really like movies.
1138;The Green Mile is such a movie, telling a wonderful story of humanity with all its faults and wonders.
1139;Hanks has never been better (he should have won another Oscar for this role, and so should the film) and the movie offers career topping performances for a number of other actors, including Michael Geeter.
1140;plus hours a chance to enjoy this marvelous film at home with a few gentle pauses, if necessary.
1141;movie experience, that leaves you uplifted at the end, despite its setting and general subject matter, travel The Green Mile.
1142;This time it's completely over the top and does end up ruining this movie.
1143;the acting and casting are surperb for this movie.
1144;the direction and screenplay are top notch.
1145;i highly recommend this movie.
1146;Also the formula of an old man recalling great events of his youth just like in Titanic or Saving Private Ryan.
1147;Of course the drama is so powerful that it moved me, however I would prefer to be moved in a more valid manner, artistically.
1148;Tom Hanks is great, like always and Michael Clarke Duncan is truly superb!!
1149;The entire supporting cast are fantastic as well.
1150;If you love movies you will love The Green Mile.
1151;Unmistakably the best film of 1999!
1152;The film has moments of beautiful tenderness and incredible cruelty.
1153;as does the arrival of a small mouse which gives immediate purpose to one of the inmates.
1154;balance to the innate goodness of Coffey and his healing ways.
1155;The interplay between all these actors is brilliant and in some instances heart rending, it certainly choked me up more than a few times.
1156;Themes of love, hate, friendship, guilt, redemption, and healing all intertwine to combine for a memorable movie experience.
1157;That's the first thought that comes to mind.
1158;And although I would not be so harsh in my criticism as some other reviewers I can certainly understand their feelings.
1159;worth a look just don't expect too much.
1160;I seen this movie before, and that's why I bought it.
1161;The Green Mile is one of my favorite movies.
1162;there is one important scene in the middle of the movie during which the guards feloniously take John Coffey (the central prisoner, with the magical powers) to the house of their supervisor, whose wife is dying of a brain tumor.
1163;Coffey, and absolutely gigantic African American, leans over and KISSES her, in a room full of Depression.
1164;era white men, including the woman's husband!
1165;The performances are good, and while the movie isn't boring, the last half does sort of grind to a halt.
1166;This is a beautiful movie, with very disturbing moments, like the I didn't know the sponge was supposed to be wet part.
1167;I grimaced serveral times during this film due to it's graphic nature, but it pales in comparison to what the real.
1168;life experience would be like.
1169;This is a very faithful portrayal of the King novel.
1170;Very smart dialogue, very humorous and believable characters make this all the more entertaining!
1171;Gary Sinise is great as the no.
1172;good lawyer who defends Coffey.
1173;The inmate and Hanks are good.
1174;First off, I have a heart.
1175;and, secondly, I have been moved to tears by some movies.
1176;i gotta hand it to Hanks, Darabount, and King, though, this is some pretty slick movie.
1177;making, and I can see where the emotional rip.
1178;The Green Mile is a great movie.
1179;Directed by Frank Darabont, the director of The Shawshank Redemption, it's story is wonderful as he directs nothing but wonderful scripts.
1180;The bad guy, Percy, was also very convincing to the point where you just wanted to strangle him.
1181;The acting was extremely impressive and the show itself was great.
1182;But other than that, it is a movie that is definately worth seeing.
1183;American Beauty was an incredibly filmed, superbly written film that shined a mirror on too many American families.
1184;The ideas are, for the most part, original.
1185;What we need is more movies like American Beauty to show us the utter vastness of that gray area.
1186;(Paul vs. Percy, Coffey vs. Wild Bill, etc.), making it far too sugary sweet to be enjoyed long enough.
1187;An interesting turning point in the story occurs when Coffey demonstrates the ability to heal merely by touch.
1188;The inclusion of this single element of fantasy into an otherwise harsh reality has tremendous impact and causes ripple throughout the rest of the movie.
1189;this film has a great cast from top to bottom whether it's the big names or the character actors who get typically little credit but give a great deal of depth to the movie.
1190;Duncan steals the show as Coffey partly due to his sheer size but also because of the great warmth and decency he brings to the character.
1191;Hanks does as fine a job as he ever has, and that's saying something.
1192;in short, The Green Mile is an exceptional movie.
1193;The script is unusually intelligent, the acting top notch, and the story keeps you interested throughout it's nearly three hour running time.
1194;It certainly has an unorthodox story line but it works beautifully.
1195;If you haven't seen the film yet, I would certainly recommend giving it a try.
1196;I still rembember seeing this gem at the theater and feeling the audience's reactions, and it felt great.
1197;tom Hanks does a wonderful job being in charge of prison guards who guard death row inmates.
1198;This is an intense movie where you will feel the wrath of killers the sadness of execution and the injustice of someone falsely accused.
1199;Yet, you will feel for Clarke, a rather large man plays Coffey, who, wrongly accused, plays a man who has great powers, almost magical, yet he is forgiving of his captors and of the accusors.
1200;Tom Hanks and Bonnie Hunt make a great couple who have challenges with Tom's job and his health.
1201;There is an eerie sense to this scene where Coffey is in chains in a truck.
1202;Yet the Green Mile is a movie that shows the human side of tragedy, the intensity of death row, the cruelty and injustice of life, and that what goes around comes around, yet it may be time before that happens.
1203;this is one of my favorite movies.
1204;great acting and story, this movie brings you in as you're watching it, with alot of emotions.
1205;i highly recommend this movie.
1206;This film is wonderful, although the ending is not at all what I had hoped for and I suspect that this might have been a part of why there were mixed reviews.
1207;It has a bit of Shawshank in it and some great actors that are familiar to King and Hanks best work.
1208;This is a beautifully filmed and well acted movie.
1209;The director, Frank Darabont, who also directed The Shawshank Redemption(also by Stephen King), did an excellent job.
1210;Tom Hanks, yet again, gives us another fine performance worthy of being ranked with his performance in Philidelphia.
1211;"He truly is a ""gentle giant"", and was worthy of his Oscar nomination and should have won."
1212;Don't let the running time of three hours scare you off because this film is so good you will never realize it until the film is over.
1213;I consider it to be one of the best films of 1999.
1214;wow, this movie was intense.
1215;First let me say that my title of this movie is very true.
1216;Once you see this movie you will remember it to some degree for the rest of your life.
1217;If you watch it alone you will tell your friends and family about it.
1218;You will probably let them borrow it or watch it with them just so you can see it again.
1219;the movie has a great cast.
1220;These are just some of the great actors in this movie They are all giving some of the greatest performances I have ever seen.
1221;One who works there and one who has become a prisoner.
1222;But you will come to find out at the very end that sometimes even good men, whom do things that may be considered good.
1223;what the basic meaning of all this is, this movie will make so many people happy.
1224;I am sure that this film is in the top 100 films ever made list.
1225;My husband loves this movie so much that he plays it over and over.
1226;He played it so much that it wore out.
1227;This an amazing movie and would recomend it to anyone.
1228;This stays with the King book admirably.
1229;I read The Green Mile many years ago, including many other Stephen King books.
1230;Tom Hanks and the rest of the cast (including the little mouse) do such a great job of portraying the characters and making it one of my all.
1231;Now I can watch The Green Mile anytime I want.
1232;If you like prison movies you will love this one, great actors that play there parts well.
1233;Also it's a little touching has some sad moments that will touch your heart.
1234;Oscar nomination for best picture was a joke, as was the one Michael Clark Duncan as the giant, childlike black death row inmate.
1235;But I think everyone knows, at this point, that this is a completely wonderful, amazing, imaginative and unique film with superb acting by every member of the cast.
1236;It was magnificently and dynamically directed by Frank Darabont who also directed another fantastic and favorite film, Shawshank Redemption.
1237;cast is brilliant loved the mouse.
1238;The Green Mile is undoubtfully the best film of 99.
1239;Tom Hanks gives a great performance as prison guard Paul Edgecombe but Michael Clarke Duncan is the one who gives a breathrough performance in this film.
1240;"There are alot of memorable lines in this movie
1241;But the most powerful scene of the movie is when Coffey shows Paul Edgecombe what he saw through Wild Bill.
1242;what helped me more in appreciating the movie was being able to read the book understanding all the reasons behind the scenes.
1243;I saw it a long time ago when it came out and bought it now for my wife to see it and we both loved it.
1244;Great performance of Michael Clarke Duncan and Tom Hanks
1245;And I do reall love this movie.
1246;The electric chair scares me.
1247;i enjoyed all the folks in this (even the really bad guy) he made me laugh and mad at the same time!
1248;i'm also happy with the redesign of the cover"
1249;the bonus features are also very interesting.
1250;It's Wintertime and I work out side when it's warm.
1251;I love this movie and cuddle up in my PJ's and enjoy it each time I watch it.
1252;I love this movie, first of all Tom Hanks is in it.
1253;I saw it once at the movies when it opened and liked it a lot.
1254;Now I have had the opportunity to watch it a few more times I am reminded of what a really good film it is.
1255;The attention to detail is exquisite and the tale lovingly and absorbingly told.
1256;But one of the prisoners, John Coffey, is a magnificent human being housed in the body of a giant.
1257;He possesses supernatural powers which he uses in a sacrificial way to help others, most notably the wife of the warden who has a terminal illness.
1258;The story sounds a bit farfetched in the telling but it is beautifully illustrated in this movie.
1259;As wonderful as Tom Hanks is, the best performance is Michael Duncan's as John Coffey.
1260;His acting is beyond acting.
1261;This is a movie to be watched, savored, enjoyed, and pondered well after the viewing.
1262;It would have been a very worthy Academy Award winner.
1263;They sobbed so much it was a box of tissues for each, but they both loved the movie as much as me.
1264;Green Mile is a solid film.
1265;The acting is fine, the writing is fine, in fact there really isn't much to critique beyond the fact that film just wasn't all that powerful.
1266;"Both ""The Stand"" and ""Salem's Lot"", on the other hand, were a real pleasure, IMO."
1267;The Green Mile, on the other hand, is pure cinematic gold (or platinum, maybe?)
1268;Firstly because of the brilliant acting.
1269;secondly for the great story line which somehow manages to be both down.
1270;tom Hanks gives an outstandingly understated performance.
1271;"likewise David Morse, who has given so many satisfying performances over the years, is wholly convincing as Brutus ""Brutal"" Howell, but by implication rather than by resorting to overtly aggressive behaviour."
1272;"sam Rockwell, as William ""Wild Bill"" Wharton, plays his part as a total scumbag so well that you *may* spot the significance of his character well in advance of the punchline."
1273;doug Hutchison, as the governor's totally despicable nephew, also makes a good job of an unpromising character, not least because he resists the temptation to try to redeem his character by showing some tiny spark of humanity.
1274;In this respect, Doug's acting is, in a way, the best on the set.
1275;king's personal form of spirituality seems to be pretty unorthodox, and even though some [people] see John Coffey as a parallel to Jesus Christ (John Coffey = JC = Jesus Christ) this is a tenuous association at best and maybe best ignored in order to get the most entertainment from the story.
1276;so, never less than above average, and mainly way up with the best, this is definitely one worth watching .
1277;This is the best movie and it was very easy to download.
1278;I don't usually rate things, but this movie is so well done, the actors were authentic and played their parts well, you could almost feel Paul Edgecomb's pain from his UTI.
1279;i wonder if they could make it as good as the original.
1280;I usually don't like sequels, either, but this was done so well it leaves you wanting more.
1281;Such a great film is The Green Mile, which is based on the six.
1282;The continuity of the film is done amazing well, when one considers its origins.
1283;His story/ies take place in 1935, so during the depths of the Depression, which hit the South and Midwest at its hardest.
1284;the film takes time to develop each character, which I always enjoy: Edgecomb's fellow officers are decent upstanding men with a tough job, but they do it well .
1285;"Certain ""nemesis"" characters are also well."
1286;Like Wharton, he too has a secret to hide, but as this slowly reveals itself, it is far more uplifting than that of the former.
1287;style electric chair of the times (one such execution is really quite graphic and worth fast.
1288;The highest point in the state of Louisiana is 535 ft. above sea level, and is in the far northern part of Louisiana, right near the Arkansas/Louisiana state line (however, to be fair, this does appear to be the part of the state where the film is set).
1289;in all, The Green Mile is film worth seeing.
1290;have always wanted to watch this and so glad thta I finally did.
1291;I will look into the book as well now.
1292;Tom Hanks does a great job in this movie.
1293;It is inspiring and gives me hope that their is good in this world.
1294;It's a long movie but very much worth watching.
1295;This movie is a glimpse inside a world we wouldn't really know.
1296;the performances of each actor are exceptional and powerful and make your heart ache.
1297;sit down for the ride and prepare to be moved, very moved!
1298;Being an avid Stephen King fan, i have read the book twice, listened to it on tape and seen the film twice.
1299;I highly reccommend it to anyone.
1300;This is by far the best movie based on a Steven King novel I have ever seen.
1301;Powerfull, good acting, good storyline, and heart.
1302;I was sleepy while seeing the movie.
1303;This is an excellent movie!
1304;This is definitely one for my collection!
1305;Good price, GREAT movieTom hanks is a fantastic actor and the film is well organized, giving a great experience to prison life and how just because of where you are, doesn't mean you DONT entertain angels, unawares.
1306;I was skeptical, not being a Stephen King fan, but it was excellent.
1307;A real gem of a film.
1308;Great film and probably should have won the academy award or equal.
1309;I admit to being a fan of Steven King, but this film had it all: a great story, a wonderful cast, great acting, good sets, fine filming and editing, great special effects, a haunting musical score and so on.
1310;It was far superior to The Stand (which I loved), and which many King fans think is his best film.
1311;THis movie keeps your attention.
1312;I think it is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time that is why I bought it.
1313;It will take you on an emotional roller coaster.
1314;Funny, sad and heart warming .
1315;This is one of the best movie that I have seen so far.
1316;The movie pulls the audiences in to feel and have a taste of the life of inmates on death row.
1317;The essential part is that, their feelings and emotion while being put on the fine line between live and death.
1318;the most touching part of the movie is how prison guards have to stick to their duty while executing an innocent man despite they know he didn't do the crime.
1319;of course, the supernatural power of the big guy does give the audiences a pleasant shock and reflected how kind and little he is despite of his enormous size.
1320;It's a challenging story and the psychological, suspenseful, dramatic issues of this story line really keep you engaged.
1321;The characters are well developed and portrayed by the cast and the directing was superb!
1322;Not for everyone, but I give it a high recommendation!
1323;This is a bittersweet tale with many moments that make you laugh and others that make you grin as the evil get their just desserts.
1324;"The scene shifts to 1935, where Paul works with fellow guards Brutus ""Brutal"" Howell, Harry Terwilliger, and Dean Stanton."
1325;John reveals extraordinary powers by healing Paul's urinary tract infection and resurrecting a mouse.
1326;"Percy Wetmore, a sadist with a fierce temper, has recently begun working in the death row inmates block
1327;He demands to manage the execution of Eduard Delacroix, promising that afterward, he will transfer to an administrative post at a mental hospital.
1328;John takes Paul's hand and says he has to give Paul """"a part of himself"""" in order for Paul to see what really happened to the girls."""
1329;Paul agrees, shakes his hand, and John is executed.
1330;Mr. Jingles, Del's mouse resurrected by John, is also still alive .
1331;this is such a brilliant film and yet another adaptation of a novel that was never paid its full respect.
1332;definitely a keepsake for the truest movie buff.
1333;The story was full of life experieces that anyone can relate to!
1334;Great scenes and great acting!
1335;The Green Mile was a lot better than I ever imagined.
1336;I was very shocked the movie had humor as well!
1337;Streamed well and was available immediately.
1338;I've seen it before and it is still a really great movie to see.
1339;The newcomer had an amazing growth and was eerily quiet, which, however, had no effect on the attitude of Paul Edgecomb unit chief who is used to execute the sentence.
1340;giant later surprised everyone when it was revealed that he has incredible magical powers
1341;Tom Hanks is ideal in this film.
1342;This is one of those iconic films to be remembered and part of Tom and Michael's legacies.
1343;There are some good performances, most notably Michael Clarke Duncan, who made an odd couple with Haley Joel Osment when both were nominated for Best Supporting Actor at the Oscars, and the scene with John Coffey and Melinda the prison warden's wife is brilliant.
1344;it is pretty close to the story with few changes this movie is great.
1345;Great story but it could have been told in two hours instead of three hours, but I did enjoy it.
1346;For anybody who is a fan of Frank Darabont's work on The Shawshank Redemption this film is definitely one to pick up.
1347;Full of powerful emotions and striking clarity on life lessons, The Green Mile shows us that not everyone can be placed into a good or bad category based simply on their position in life.
1348;the film also deals with how precious life is.
1349;This movie is a testament to film.
1350;making at its best, and I would recommend this to anyone in a heartbeat.
1351;Its powerful story and great cast make The Green Mile one of my favorite movies of all time.
1352;This movie is a timeless classic and the blu ray makes it that much better!
1353;This movie is for anyone who wants to see a true classic.
1354;I recommend this to everybody.
1355;I'd say this is one of Tom Hanks best movies and MIchael Clark Duncan does an outstanding job as well.
1356;Everyone I know who has seen it really likes it.
1357;The other events in the film, however, such as Hank's healing and the discovery of the real murderer are a redeeming factor, as are the actors.
1358;This is a powerful movie based on the Stephen King book series.
1359;The cast is fabulous (Tom Hanks, Michael Clark Duncan, and James Cromwell, just to name a few), and the acting is so believable.
1360;"this touches upon some adult issues and can be very graphic when referring to the murder of two little girls
1361;an excellent addition to anyone's movie library.
1362;Before seeing this movie I was treated to some great reviews, not only by critics, but by my friends.
1363;I had never read the book, but I really wanted to see the movie.
1364;The acting was good, the story was good, but the movie just wasn't what it coulda been.
1365;I mean after all, this is Steven King's story here.
1366;If your looking for a really long movie with some decent tear.
1367;Tom Hanks has far and away one of the best roles of his carrer.
1368;Only his turn in Saving Private Ryan is more moving.
1369;Michael Duncan is awesome in his role as the Christ.
1370;Michael Jeter who plays Delacroix deserves recognition for his portrayal.
1371;He shows us a condemned man who can find joy in the antics of a pet mouse and .
1372;This is a movie which is at once funny, tender, terrifying and compelling.
1373;I will be inviting family and friends over solely for the purpose of revealing this movie to them.
1374;Darabont and King have done it again with The Green Mile.
1375;The same magic that flowed through their previous movie together (The Shawshank Redemption) is alive and well in this movie.
1376;This has to be the best adaptation from a Stephen King novel ever done.
1377;i thought the casting choices were excellent, especially that of Michael Clarke Duncan as John Coffey.
1378;Duncan is a perfect fit.
1379;this is one of the best movies I've seen in the past few years.
1380;All we get is a trailer (a very good one though) and an 8 minute behind the scenes documentary (another nice one).
1381;If you don't fall into this category, give the movie a shot.
1382;It will be worth your time.
1383;It is a long one be well worth it .
1384;Tom Hanks does a wonderful job acting.
1385;Tom Hanks delivers his usual great performance but all the cast are superb.
1386;The storyline is absolutely captivating.
1387;its a great movie that i will watch over and over again.
1388;Each character in the movie, directed so richly by Frank Darabont, is a full.
1389;It made me squirm in my seat just imagining it.
1390;sized man named John Coffey ( just like the drink, only not spelled the same ), played by the very talented Michael Clarke Duncan, is brought to the penitentiary.
1391;If you're looking for a movie to give you a quick fix, then honey, you best be looking someplace else.
1392;This is a beautiful and complex story and Darabont does not rush it.
1393;He lets the story take on its own life and allows it and the characters to evolve fully.
1394;there are many wonderful scenes in this movie (and some honestly horrific ones), and one of my favorites is near the end of the film.
1395;No matter how many times I brace myself for it, I still get emotionally charged by it.
1396;minute documentary, Walking the Mile, that has interviews with the cast, crew and writer of the film.
1397;The Green Mile is a very powerful and moving tale.
1398;winning performances"
1399;And plus, it's got the best acting mouse in Mr. Jingles you'll ever see!
1400;This si one of my favorite movies, it is absolutely one of the best.
1401;The characters are so real and the story is outstanding.
1402;I found the story to be interesting and compelling and the acting to be terrific.
1403;An OUTSTANDING film, The Green Mile, follows the life of a prison guard at Cold Mountain Penitentiary in the 1930's.
1404;That life is going to change when a new inmate arrives and is placed on death row.
1405;it is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, faith, friendship, and inner strength.
1406;tom Hanks, Michael Duncan, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are extraordinary to say the least.
1407;All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!
1408;Very well written and very well presented, it is an entertaining film that can be watched over and over again.
1409;Was a great movie to watch, and what a shock ending.
1410;Really makes you stop and think how far we have come.
1411;Tom Hanks a Great Actor and the Star to us was the Actor with the Gift.
1412;This s my favorite movie.
1413;I love The Green Mile more each time I view it.
1414;I would recommend it to Tom Hanks fans, and those of heavy drama.
1415;My most frequent criticism of films is that they tend to be overlong, but The Green Mile, at a three full hours, needed every precious second in order to pace the story, develop its characters, and lead the viewer into the satisfying conclusion.
1416;despite some gruesome scenes depicting the details of electric chair execution, the film is a testament to the humanity of people.
1417;The audience gets to experience the stress of the responsibility of prison guards seeking to bring a bit of dignity to the last days of the convicted men, and we share their moral dilemma when they are faced with hard choices.
1418;michael Clarke Duncan, cast as the simple and honest black man sentenced to die for supposedly killing two little girls, is absolutely superb and was nominated for an academy award for his outstanding performance.
1419;He's 43 years old, 6'5 tall and a former ditch digger and bodyguard.
1420;tom Hanks, of course, is excellent, giving us the kind of fine performance we have come to expect of him.
1421;And the rest of the cast, including Michael Jeter as the villain, and David Morse as a fellow prison guard are perfect.
1422;directed by Frank Darabont who also shared the scripting of this film with Stephen King, every scene is constructed with just the right amount of tension to keep the viewer glued to the screen.
1423;but by no means is this a simple wrongly.
1424;There's a slight suspension of reality well integrated into the story line.
1425;I give it my highest rating.
1426;Another great movie starring Tom Hanks.
1427;I like a movie with a moral.
1428;The interaction between the charactors is great.
1429;"The plot takes place on Cold Mountain Penitentairy's death row, one of the scariest and deadliest places, where ""the green mile"" is the walk to the electric chair."
1430;He's even afraid of the dark.
1431;tom Hanks does a great job as Paul Edgecomb, but most impressive is Michael Clarke Duncan as John Coffey.
1432;Together with the other actors and actresses they outdid themselves in one of the best movies I've ever seen.
1433;Stephen King wrote an excellent and the director Frank Darabont did an excellent job turning it into a movie!!
1434;Great story with great acting performances.
1435;I highly recommend this movie.
1436;One of the best ones out there!
1437;this is a good movie it was a while to wach and time consuming but the actors were good also
1438;A wonderful story played by a wonderful cast.
1439;A job well done by everyone, including the late Michael Jeter.
1440;A classic for future generations.
1441;Each character is so well.
1442;defined, believable even when magic happens.
1443;The casting of Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan were perfect.
1444;He (Duncan)covered the range of emotions needed and is a superb actor!
1445;I find something new every single time I watch it.
1446;The movie is so worth the time to watch and it will leave you pondering many questions long after it is over.
1447;Grab a kleenex and enjoy!
1448;It was an excellent read, and this movie does the book(s) justice.
1449;All the actors give an outstanding performance.
1450;The movie has a great storyline, with conflicts and suspense combined with an emotional setting that leaves you spellbound.
1451;But it will draw your attention with its moving performances given by Tom hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan.
1452;Nevertheless, the performances are sterling (the sadistic guard is great), photography first.
1453;rate, and its heart is in the right place.
1454;A very, very good movie, you will not even realize how the time passes by.
1455;good acting, the black guy is great too.
1456;Frank Darabont took Stephen King's masterpiece and somehow got every little detail onto film.
1457;Not just because his script is very true to King's writings, but aslo through the emotions he presents the visuals he use.
1458;The main reason why is he uses the gift of vision to somehow engage the imagination as good as the written word doing what no director, especially of a Stephen King adaptation, has been able to do.
1459;But here I went book then movie and was stunned that the movie was just as good and just as powerful.
1460;Tom Hanks, David Morse and others give terrificc performances as always, along with other actors.
1461;He possesses Coffey's size and heighth but he also amazingly possesses Coffey's beautiful pure innocence.
1462;His performance alone brought me to tears.
1463;If you have read the book see the movie and see for yourself.
1464;I was actually looking for something that my boyfriend would enjoy since he puts up with my chick flicks.
1465;I loved it but he just rolled his eyes and asked me to let him pick out our next movie, so careful girls.
1466;It's a great story and well worth watching but you may want to consider something else for date night.
1467;one of my favorite movies ever.
1468;the cast was the best and tom hanks was fantastic like he always is.
1469;I had heard that The Green Mile was a good movie, so I decided to go to the theater one night to see it.
1470;Even though the movie was long (over 3 hours) I was kept captivated and enjoyed it the whole time.
1471;They develop a unique relationship based upon a special 'talent' of Duncan.
1472;In a way, the story introduces the supernatural and religion from an interesting perspective that strengthens the connection between the characters and the viewer.
1473;It is an interesting tale that will make you think about what counts in life, how you treat others, and the distinction between good and evil.
1474;It is touching to the heart and even though I didn't cry, I felt moved by the story.
1475;I recommend this to you if you like good stories with interesting characters.
1476;The actors in this movie were all well cast.
1477;charge of E block and his co. workers did a great job, even Mr. Jingles but, with all due respect, the movie focused on the character, John Coffey.
1478;The scenes of the electrocutions were vivid.
1479;This movie was one of the best of the year.
1480;It lead you through all the range of human emotion.
1481;It gets better with each time you see it.
1482;my eyes still get watery when I think about the movie.
1483;Micheal Clark Duncan does justice to the role of John Coffee.
1484;Again an excellent performance from Tom Hanks, and if you dont have a tear at the end of this film, then you must have been watching something else.
1485;Great story with excellent performance's by Tom Hanks, and Michael Clark Duncan.
1486;It is a long movie but worth the time.
1487;I actually enjoyed the Movie better.
1488;The length of the movie wasn't a problem, it kept you into it the whole time.
1489;It was very intense at times, especially during the executions.
1490;It was a very unique film.
1491;I love prison movies, and if you do to, I highly recommend this great movie.
1492;From the same director of Shawshank Redeption This is a very human movie, with a magic touch.
1493;Great acting, and it is worth to have.
1494;See it and read the book too!!!
1495;It is really deep and will touch your heart.
1496;It is funny, sad, thought provoking, magical, and disturbing all at the same time.
1497;It was very true to the book and the casting was spot on.
1498;he was excellent ,as was Tom Hanks!
1499;For Stephen King fans, this movie is a delight .
1500;it's realistic enough to make you believe it could almost happen, yet supernatural enough to give it a real edge.
1501;The acting was superb .
1502;all of the characters played their parts so well you were able to get a really emotional feeling .
1503;I think this is for sure, the best movie that I've ever seen.
1504;I watched it two days in a row, and it was just as good .
1505;I read the serial novel before I saw this movie, and I have to say that they did an excellent job converting the book into a movie.
1506;The fact that the novel was published in serial form had King going back to Paul as an old man between each part to continue the flow of the book, and to keep the reader aware of what was going on.
1507;the actors all did a magnificent job also.
1508;Duncan did an excellent job as Coffey, infusing the character with the proper touch of wonder, sadness, and his sense of isolation from the world.
1509;Everyone did a good job, right down to the dozen or so mice they had that portrayed Mr. Jingle, an excellent job there.
1510;finally, I really enjoyed the wrap up at the end of the movie, the punishment Paul feels he's serving for having killed one of God's true miracles.
1511;And it's true, we all are walking our own green mile, and we never know when it's going to end.
1512;The Green Mile is certainly one of the better films of 1999.
1513;Adapted from one of Stephen King's best stories, the film is doggedly faithful to the original story.
1514;"I have nothing against three hour films
1515;that is a masterpiece of film that soars with powerful imagination and contains unforgettable cinematic images.
1516;The film also makes a couple of key missteps.
1517;The CGI effects used when JC does his miracles diminishes the power of the moment.
1518;It actualizes an event that is more powerful in the mind .
1519;The cast is fine and the production truly captures the environment as well as the time the story takes place.
1520;It's a fine story and a movie worth watching.
1521;I found this movie very captivating and heart warming.
1522;this has to be one of the all time greatest movies.
1523;i received it before the due date.
1524;for the emotionally impaired, you'll find this a five star movie and delightful use of an evening.
1525;I saw, this movie 2 times one, in theatres the other on video, good movie and sad.
1526;This movie is a lot like Shawshank, and if you liked that movie, this is pretty much a sure bet.
1527;Tom Hanks in particular I felt was just wonderful in this movie.
1528;But he was just the best in a whole cast of great actors and actresses.
1529;overall, an excellent movie, easily one of the best of the year, and one that I personally will want for my library.
1530;you will feel things and think about and learn more about these actors and what they bring to life with their skill
1531;This has to be one of the best films I have ever seen.
1532;Its an incredable story of a Death Row prison guard's experiences one year on the Green Mile, a name they dubed the green floor on which the inmates walk on before their deaths.
1533;The acting and Frank Darabont's direction was simply breath taking.
1534;This so great i cried at the end, and i dont cry over movies like that.
1535;This is truly a great film.
1536;It was generally well received critically and was nominated for seven Academy Awards.
1537;Both movies take place in prison, and The Green Mile is, if anything, even grimmer.
1538;This new effort managed to garner only four Academy nominations, but the producers were smart enough to snare Tom Hanks for the lead, which assured commercial success both here and abroad.
1539;The man in charge of death row is Paul Edgecomb [Tom Hanks], a fairly affable and thoughtful guy.
1540;He has a likable and loyal crew, except for Percy Wetmore [Doug Hutchison], a sick kid who does as he pleases because his uncle is the state's governor.
1541;the performances are all great.
1542;Darabont is said to be very picky about casting, and he chose actors who could create memorable characters.
1543;The black with super powers who is on equal terms with less than average whites.
1544;That's why it got all those awards.
1545;This makes the second time a black man turned in a superior performance to Hanks and Hanks got the nod.
1546;the director (Daranbount) is an excellent story teller.
1547;He rivals Spielberg, who does a pretty good job of telling a story.
1548;I enjoyed the episodes which were told in this film.
1549;And it is so good to see Bonnie Hunt doing solid work as well (*on a side note, her Bonnie t. v. series was the most refreshing thing I'd seen on t. v. in years .
1550;Based on a Stephen King episodic work, the film has a touch of the supernatural .
1551;I stayed with it for 3 hours!
1552;I felt the pain and joy of those men.
1553;It does seem timely what with all the attention that death row criminals are receiving these days .
1554;It definitely makes some statements about those topics.
1555;In fact, at several points it hits a wonderful groove and works on all levels.
1556;Tom Hanks and a cast of other brilliant stars bring you up and down for well over 3 hours.
1557;If you have not seen it yet it is definately worth your time, more worth than the past several movies I have seen.
1558;this movie is incredebly long, but you still must admit it is very good.
1559;great performances by: Hanks, Morse, Pepper, and of course Michael Clarke Duncan.
1560;Barry Pepper (Saving Private Ryan, Enemy of the State, and Battlefield Earth) is an amazing up and coming actor.
1561;this is a very moving story of life.
1562;the book is very good too.
1563;This has some of the best acting ever in a film.
1564;I love the sets, and storylines.
1565;I'd be more than happy to answer any and all of them.
1566;This is one of those movies that I watch over and over again.
1567;I pretty much have the dialogs memorized.
1568;This movie has to be one of my top ten movies of all time.
1569;It is such a beautiful movie.
1570;Each time I watch it.
1571;This movie was gripping, drawing you in, making you want to get to know the characters.
1572;From the moment Coffey's hulking presence enters the prison, the dark and ominous shadows of the prison, seem softer as if reflecting the gentle giant's purity of heart.
1573;One of Tom Hanks best and will be a destined classic.
1574;This movie is so powerful.
1575;I literally cried the whole time.
1576;A truly great film, starring the terrific Tom Hanks.
1577;This movie shows he can play any one in any film, and he does it well.
1578;It's worthwhile watching (even if you do need to keep your legs crossed throughout!)
1579;and it'll definitely make you re.
1580;He's a big hunk of love to begin with, and considering there's only an inch between him and David Morse to begin with, it was done very well, as Michael seems to tower over everyone.
1581;all about your movies, you will perhaps notice that the music played over the loudspeakers in the retirement home as Old Paul Edgecomb first walks out of his room is the same as the music the nurses played at medication time in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest!This film comes highly recommended, and the book is just as good.
1582;The extras are quite good at the same time, although not if you don't like looking at Stephen King!
1583;we laughed and cried and then were completely surprised to find that 3 hours had passed.
1584;telling is riveting and the character portrayals are excellent!
1585;Others have praised Michael Clarke Duncan for his Coffey but I was very pleased when Brutus showed his face for the first time for David Morse is an excellent yet largely ignored actor.
1586;Michael Jeter, Sam Rockwell, and Doug Hutchison also turn in superb performances.
1587;It is true that this movie isn't perfect and that I was able to anticipate some of the plot points.
1588;this is a modern classic.
1589;Just a great movie .
1590;Just a great movie on the all levels.
1591;it will touch your hearts.
1592;As opposed to most Stephen King books made into movies, I was surprised at great this movie actually was.
1593;It is one of those movies in which you get attached to the characters and when it ends, you end up with one of those """"That's it?"""""""
1594;as far as the special edition version of this film, it is totally worth it.
1595;packaging is also good (plastic packaging, not that inconvenient paper one).
1596;Stephen King should be extremely proud of Frank Darabont's rendering of The Green Mile.
1597;What an awesome cinematic experience!
1598;It certainly does give you a whole new vision of the death penalty, and life in general.
1599;What is truly amazing about this film is the casting!
1600;They should have given an Oscar to all of them as the most outstanding ensemble cast in years!
1601;It's hard to single out any one person, but if you look at the entire cast, you can see how perfect they were for their roles.
1602;Of course, Tom Hanks demonstrates why he's considered the best actor out there these days.
1603;His portrayal of Paul Edgecomb is simply terrific.
1604;His battle with the urinary tract infection is played marvelously, without one word of dialogue, and when he's cured, and goes to the john, the look of relief is something any male can identify with.
1605;"His relationship with his wife (beautifully embodied by Bonnie Hunt) is so beautiful
1606;A man of unbelievable size, he still evokes a gentleness and understanding of love in such a wonderful way.
1607;His last scene with Hanks is pure gold.
1608;The rest of the cast is awesome, too.
1609;David Morse (from St. Elsehwere ) is perfect as Brutal.
1610;All the guards seem to have a genuine love for each other, and Morse displays strength, compassion and humor in this overlooked role.
1611;Jeffrey DeMunn and Barry Pepper as the other good guards are brilliant, too.
1612;Hutchison is brilliant in his portrayal of this evil, uncaring, unhuman guard.
1613;Michael Jeter as Delacort, the man who gets an unusual friend in the mouse, Mr. Jingles, is awesome in his role.
1614;The movie never seemed slow, or long"
1615;Putting one of Stephen Kings best works with arguable the best actor today in Tom Hanks, it's inevitable that this be one of the best films of the new century .
1616;regardless of the movie length, if you want a wonderfully told story, with absolutely superb acting, this is a must.
1617;The acting is good and it is a good steven king adaptation.
1618;NOt as powerful and truly great 'shawshank redemption' another steven king story that is a straight drama , but is set back in this era as well.
1619;The acting is first class with tom hanks and the rest of the cast doing a fine job.
1620;Michael Clarke Duncan is especially good as the giant with strange abilities.
1621;MOst people who are that tall don't live to be sixty which is unfortunate as well, anyway he really puts in a outstanding performance here.
1622;There are some good extra features on here as well.
1623;This is arguably one of Tom Hanks' best movies.
1624;The first disc is rated 18, the second 12, but do not be misled, I found the emotional impact of the second is as great as the first, and not for the deaths to come.
1625;I was quite prepared to give it a one star rating after about the first 15 slow minutes.
1626;It is deeply moving and believable throughout.
1627;In this case all you have to accept is that the man has a gift.
1628;Science may be food for the mind and food for the body, but this is food for the soul and the heart.
1629;This is a good film to start deep conversations with.
1630;The first time I viewed the film, I deemed it a personal classic.
1631;After watching it several times after its first release, I felt I was correct and I still hold that same opinion.
1632;The story line was great and the acting was outstanding on all levels.
1633;I read the book 6 times because I loved the story so much, and when I went to see it in the theaters it made all my invisions come true.
1634;This movie has the best story that I've seen in a while (and I'm a movie freak!)
1635;The movie will touch your heart and even me as a guy i cried every time I read the book and watched the movie.
1636;The film adaptation stays true to the Stephen King masterpiece, and deserves 80 stars, and is put up as my top ten best movies of all time!
1637;This is an excellent film, well done and hard to leave when it is on.
1638;it's a bit of a strange plot but the acting is superb!
1639;I found myself emotionally attached to a number of the characters.
1640;It has the serious story, the serious actors, and the serious length that the Academy likes to reward with serious numbers of statuettes.
1641;"this isn't to say that The Green Mile doesn't have its strong points
1642;to begin with, the cast is excellent.
1643;the rest of the actors portraying Edgecombe's crew are also fine, but Doug Hutchinson stands out as the smarmy, abusive Percy Wetmore, a man who most assuredly gets what he deserves.
1644;Harry Dean Stanton has a great turn as Toot Toot, a old.
1645;Frank Darabont's direction is suave and self.
1646;that brings us to the subject of length.
1647;as long as they give me fascinating characters and situations, and don't beat me about the head and face with how important they are.
1648;importance, and Great Cinema flourishes that the movie sagged under the weight of its own inflated self.
1649;It is perhaps the best movie adaptation of the 90s, or in recent times.
1650;It is set back in the 1930s, with Tom Hanks as one of the main people at the prison.
1651;Every one of the cast does an outstanding job.
1652;this movie is the rarest of breeds.
1653;SHAWHANK, is a very impressive movie, but this leaves it in the dirt.
1654;To anyone who has seen SHAWHANK, they know what a great film that is.
1655;Now imagine that achievement doubled, perhaps tripled.
1656;Truly two of the best prison movies of Hollywood.
1657;Percy's evilness is contrasted sharply with Coffey's goodness.
1658;Mr. Bojangles, the mouse, is a nice little part in the movie also.
1659;it also brings out an aspect of King which I have believed for a while.
1660;One gets the impression that the author knows about God, and knows what God is capable of, but is confused.
1661;Although not called so in terms of the movie, but Coffey is obviously a Christian.
1662;He loves everyone, and wants to use his gift to do what he can for other people.
1663;I recommend this movie to anyone.
1664;This is my very best movie of all time !!!
1665;The Green Mile is what a motion picture should ideally be: a wonderfull epic story that engages the mind and the emotions.
1666;Tom Hanks just can't miss, and he does a fabulous job bringing his role to life.
1667;The rest of the cast is also brilliant, and the sotory just comes alive form there.
1668;this is the type of tale that we need in this day and age.
1669;A tale that shows you that good things can happen and that people are what's most important"
1670;The Green Mile tries to show us that caring for people and living our lives the best we can is more important than any other consideration.
1671;i enjoyed the film and thought it was masterfully done.
1672;The characters are all engaging and you are allowed to get personal with each one.
1673;this King film, unlike his non.
1674;supernatural stories such as Shawshank Redemption or The Body (Stand by ME), is more comparable to the likes of his thrillers, but with a twist.
1675;Stellar performances from all of the cast.
1676;The story is compelling, and you really get to fall in love with Coffey, played by Michael Clarke Duncan, who is accused of a horror of a charge that he did not commit.
1677;Five stars for this fine title.
1678;They're all done well, bringing the right amount of pathos to the proceedings, without ever being manipulative (well, one is, but it kind of had to be to make its point).
1679;Move on to the story, please.
1680;which means we have a nice, lean two hour and twenty minute film.
1681;Hanks, of course, is just solid.
1682;But it was his choice to make, and Hanks ably shows the angst it took to make that choice.
1683;Plus, he gets to play pain and indignity, as Paul has a wicked bladder infection throughout the film's first third.
1684;paul's men, played by David Morse, Barry Pepper, and Jeffrey DeMunn are all excellent.
1685;Pepper is good at playing the wide.
1686;And DeMunn is mainly about quiet dignity, and in the end, confusion as to what the right thing to do would be.
1687;michael Clarke Duncan, as John Coffey, did an excellent job, although for the most part he was nearly unintelligible.
1688;Credit should go to Duncan, who does a fine, charismatic job bringing this hulking but innocent man to life.
1689;But the story is fascinating nonetheless, humourous for much of the time, but moving also, especially at the climax.
1690;There are even some quite scary scenes in the film, especially the flash.
1691;Michael Duncan was brilliant as the huge booming but gentle giant, John Coffey.
1692;Despite this though, you don't sit back and fall asleep, this is certainly a film to keep you watching, and a fine one at that.
1693;Acting, cinematography, plot all recieve a perfect ten in this film.
1694;With a moderate success and forceful critic praise, The Shawshank Redemption conquered seven Oscar nominations.
1695;The secret was staying faithful to the original manuscript, preserving the essence of history.
1696;because they are stories well told.
1697;They simply are books that captivate us because they entertain us in a pleasant way.
1698;They are frank, gripping and sure, they make us laugh or cry.
1699;now, Darabont returns with his adaptation of The Green Mile, a work that, as The Shawshank Redemption, is extraordinarily faithful to the original manuscript.
1700;Much more when he sees him practice miracles as generous as his good heart.
1701;If you can leave at home your cynicism detector, you will enjoy this film enormously.
1702;the whole cast offers wonderful interpretations, from Tom Hanks like the comprehensive Edgecomb to Michael Clarke Duncan like the enigmatic Coffey.
1703;Magnificent also are Doug Hutchinson like the ruthless Percy Whitmore, David Morse, in the comprehensive and faithful role of Brutal, Bonnie Hunt, the sweet wife, Michael Jeter, the French conquered by a little mouse and Patricia Clarkson, the special lady who can in John Coffey's eyes what's in his soul.
1704;"He sweetens what's already been sweetened
1705;He is the master of emotional impact, because he believes blindly in his power.
1706;the Green Mile is a memorable piece, although it doesn't reach the levels of excellence reached by its predecessor, The Shawshank Redemption.
1707;This last film has a plot more prone to the massive acceptance: its purpose is to raise the triumph of the life.
1708;Overall, a very pleasant transaction.
1709;This movie has some funny parts some suspensiful parts and some very sad parts.
1710;I am not a fan of sad movies but I still loved this movie although it was ar some times a tiny bit confusing.
1711;Tom Hanks is terrific, but Michael Clark Duncan is the one who really shines.
1712;Very original story by Stephen King.
1713;michael Clarke Duncan got Robbed just like Denzel Washington at the Oscars.
1714;This has to be one of my favorite moives.
1715;And this movie is worth putting a lot of thought into.
1716;In fact, it has now become one of my favorite movies to watch over and over.
1717;This movie is so good in so many ways.
1718;I have watched this movie about 8 times now, and I can tell you it never gets old.
1719;Because the story has so many levels, it always shows new elements that I never caught the first time.
1720;the story itself is fantastic.
1721;It is hugely inspirational and always leaves me in tears.
1722;This movie should be a requirement to watch before you finish high.
1723;This movie has so much depth and amazing acting it's unbelieveable.
1724;Tom Hanks' best performance in my opinion.
1725;Liked the movie very much.
1726;love the mysterious part of it and wish there was a sequel to this one for sure.
1727;As always Tom Hanks does his best in every single film he has ever done.
1728;For another awesome amazing film!
1729;This movie makes me laugh and cry.
1730;Even though his two most successful movies have been adaptions of Stephen King prison novels.
1731;His touch behind the camera is impeccable, and he moves the story at an unforced pace to illustrate its themes and deftly paints its characters.
1732;He also has an uncanny ability to choose brilliant casts, as he does here.
1733;He brings in Tom Hanks, the most reliable actor in Hollywood to play the lead as Paul Edgecombe, and Michael Clark.
1734;But he is a gentle soul, and Paul and his fellow guards have a hard time comprehending that this man could have killed two little girls at all.
1735;Over time, Coffey reveals his extraordinary gift: He is a healer, some sort of a miracle worker, able to cure any ailment or disease.
1736;But one fact keeps bothering the guards, Paul most of all: should this miracle be executed or, more importantly, is he possibly innocent.
1737;Darabont's script and direction keeps everything tight as it moves towards the emotionally wrenching and draining ending, one that leaves you tearless because you have spent them all.
1738;everything in the """"Green Mile"""" is laudable, right down to the gritty set decoration and perfectly crafted period."""
1739;"Frank Darabont crafted a masterpiece with the ""Green Mile"" one that can stand up to his other work of brilliance, ""The Shawshank Redemption."""
1740;The story is so well told and the acting so unforced and natural, it's disappointing that they don't make that many movies like it anymore.
1741;All of the acting was good.
1742;We recieved it in a timely manner, packaging was good.
1743;This is probably one of the best movies I have ever watched.
1744;It involves a riveting story line portrayed by excellent acting.
1745;This is a Must see
1746;It's like it comesto him easily !
1747;There is rarely a movie (or a novel) today that moves me to tears.
1748;This movie came together with an extraordinary cast .
1749;The supporting cast thereafter is marvelously deep talented with the likes of Bonnie Hunt, David Morse, Barry Pepper, Michael Jeter, Sam Rockwell, Doug Hutchinson, Patricia Clarkson, James Cromwell, Graham Green a small role by (one of my many personal favorites) Gary Sinise, each giving an Oscar.
1750;If you haven't seen it, please do, and you will probably agree with me.
1751;But as an added bonus, there is a behind.
1752;Mr. Jingles even makes an appearance!
1753;So, the long and short of it is that The Green Mile is time and money worth spent.
1754;I cried and laughed throughout with great reason.
1755;He's funny in such classics as Big and The Bachelor Party.
1756;He's serious in Philadelphia and Forrest Gump.
1757;Like many other writers, I fell in love with the character of John Coffey, so amazingly performed by Michael Clarke Duncan.
1758;I must say I was delighted with the interaction between him and Wild Bill.
1759;Both got what they deserved.
1760;The devil inside of me thought of everyone throughout my career who knew someone on the inside and received promotions and/or jobs because of that.
1761;Stephen King can be a masterful storyteller, and this is in my opinion one of his greatest.
1762;slower paced, entertaining and very enjoyable.
1763;All the actors were outstanding, including the mouse!
1764;The Green Mile can be seen as a sister film to the Shawshank Redemption which is, in my opinion, the best prison movie ever made.
1765;Like its predesessor, The Green Mile is a superbly crafted movie, powerful as anything you'll ever see.
1766;The actors, with Tom Hanks at the helm, all turn in brilliant perfomances, and.
1767;it's a great film .
1768;The perfect Christmas holiday movie, then.
1769;This is a movie that all should watch.
1770;This is a very special and powerful movie, it will humble you and make you think about who you are.
1771;This movie is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen.
1772;If you like this movie you should also see Shawshank Redemption.
1773;Both these movies are directed by Frank Darabont.
1774;Coffey has a special power to heal or give life to the dead.
1775;I love the mouse Mr. Jingles.
1776;Love the writing and script.
1777;Tom hanks is a great actor.
1778;A good movie to watch.
1779;Shipping was fast and disc arrived in excellent condition.
1780;This is a movie that I have liked for many years.
1781;Finally bought me a copy and have really enjoyed it
1782;I think the green mile was a very well done movie.
1783;I thought that it was sort of fun to compare with the shawshank redemption, because they have some similar things about them other than the fact that they were both based on a novel by Stephen King and both directed by Frank Darabont.
1784;I think that all and all the Shawshank Redemption is a better movie but The Green Mile is worthy of a good review.
1785;Perhaps the most wonderful part is Mr. Jingles the cute prison mouse.
1786;the screenplay is better the Stephen Kings Novel.
1787;tom Hanks is Wonderful, Micheal C Duncan is Great and Frank Durabont Directing Is Great.
1788;One of Tom Hanks finest roles as the head supervisor of E block, known as the green mile, the death row of an Alabaman prison.
1789;The Green Mile is a powerful and moving story of a simple.
1790;Sent to death row of Cold Mountain Penitentiary he increasingly convinces the supervising wardens not only of his possible innocence but of his extraordinary abilities that make him a gift from God.
1791;Some extraordinary supporting performances make this one of the finest movies of the last decade, David Morse as 'Brutal' Howell a gentle giant, Doug Hutchinson as the immature, power crazed Percy Whetmore, Sam Rockwell as the truly loathsome often puerile Wild Bill Wharton and of course Michael Clark Duncan as the remarkable John Coffey.
1792;As usual Hanks's good guy is never less than satisfactory, and Michael Clarke Duncan manages to bring a sense of emotion to his role.
1793;Most impressive however are the electric chair scenes, which are shocking just as much as they are compelling.
1794;There's also a nice little subplot with a malicious prison guard that likes to take out his own inadequacies on the prisoners.
1795;Far from it, there's a lot of worth here, but it's just as conventional as every other Hollywood prison movie.
1796;It seems to me that any movie with Tom Hanks is automatically elevated to best.
1797;Not to disrespect Hanks, who is a very fine actor, and he proves so here.
1798;The entire movie, in fact, has trouble convincing us that this is real.
1799;This movie proves that even Oscar has his lapses in taste.
1800;The portrayal of the prisoners unfair since it lets us feel great sympathy for them not having seen their crimes.
1801;john Coffey, as played by Micheal Clarke Duncan in a beautiful performance, is a man who physically feels the pain of the wrongs people do to each other.
1802;His size is symbolic of that, expressing years of absorbed pain.
1803;the Green Mile contains another pleasant surprise, Tom Hanks.
1804;A point of contention about this film is the nessecity of the present day framing sequences, and although I usually don't like this device, I think it works well here giving the story a larger scope, magnifying the effects of John Coffey.
1805;frank Darabont's last film was The Shawshank Redemption, one of the best films of the 1990s and obviously a hard act to follow.
1806;The Green Mile is not as good as that, but it is a moving, powerful and unique film in its own right.
1807;This is one of my favorite movies.
1808;Now that I've had the chance to see the complete movie, I love it even more.
1809;Seemingly gentle he has a way about him that is almost childlike.
1810;He does make a friend in Eduard Delacroix (Michael Jeter) a fellow inmate when he heals his remarkably smart pet mouse Mr. Jingles.
1811;all the actors in this movie did amazing jobs.
1812;Hanks plays a believable sympathetic guard and it is easy to relate with him.
1813;Coffey is a sad character but there is something very special about him and actor Duncan plays him very convincingly.
1814;About the best actor in this film though would be Hutchinson for his portrayal of Percy.
1815;A close second was Rockwell's interpretation of the crazy Wild Bill.
1816;i also enjoyed the music in this film.
1817;All of the music fit in well with the scenes in which it was played.
1818;There weren't a whole lot of them, but what was used was tastefully done and entirely believable.
1819;"They had a great interpretation of Coffey expelling the ""toxins"" he took out of people."
1820;wonderful movie filled with great actors and performances.
1821;Out of all the Stephen King movies out there, this is definitely one of the better ones.
1822;Hanks is his usual superb self (although the southern accent brings back 'Gump syndrome') and the rest of the cast back him up very well indeed.
1823;Another masterpiece from the man who brought you the excellent 'Shawshank Redemption'this film will have you laughing,crying and shouting.
1824;Still the sound and picture are excellent and even if they weren't .
1825;the film makes up for it.
1826;One of the most engrossing and beautifully crafted films I've ever seen.
1827;A great story that unfolds like you are reading a book with well developed characters who aren't all bad or all good.
1828;One of Tom Hanks best performances(I guess since 'Forrest Gump' beat out 'The Shawshank Redemption' for best picture Darabont wanted to use a star with Academy appeal?)
1829;ditto, Michael Clarke Duncan, David Morse and a cast of top notch character actors including Sam Rockwell, Doug Hutchison and Michael Jeter.
1830;I felt obligated to watch the whole thing because so many recommended it.
1831;Tom Hanks and the other actors play a fantastic part.
1832;Wonderful performances from all cast members but especially Michael Clarke Duncan.
1833;"a movie with heart like ""Shawshank Redemption""."
1834;Love this movie, great adaptation of the serial novel by Stephen King.
1835;Movie is just as good as the book (or books if you read it when it first came out),
1836;And as this movie was already three hours long considerable cutting was necessary.
1837;"And exploding light bulbs can be a great effect in small doses
1838;The main set just took my breath away"
1839;"And listen carefully to the sound track
1840;But read the book first"
1841;"ray book"" format and enjoy the extra information it provides."
1842;"video: Gorgeously shot, richly ""honeyed"" in that depression."
1843;film way, strikingly detailed, some minor edge enhacement raises it's head but it never gets in the way.
1844;Excellent and consistent grain field.
1845;In the first fifteen minutes of The Green Mile it is very obvious that it's a great movie.
1846;Tom Hanks also puts on another amazing performance (gee.
1847;But the supporting cast and fantasy also help to make this movie a must see.
1848;if you desire to watch a compassionate, wonderful, and sometimes teary eyed movie, then, this the the one for you.
1849;Really like this movie a lot.
1850;ray and the actor Michael Clarke Duncan passed away recently and wanted to make sure I had a good movie of him in it to remember him by.
1851;"It's a story, lovingly drawn out and beautifully told
1852;I find I much prefer the drawing out of the story to the race to the finish line that I get from most movies that are pushing to fit themselves into a two.
1853;time"
1854;i read the Green Mile and then watched it shortly after and I am conviced this is one of the best film adaptions ever made.
1855;The cast is simply amazing, straight out of the book.
1856;The set design is equally flawless, just how I imagined it as I read the book.
1857;The Green Mile is a story which captures the spectrum of human emotion, evoking pain, hatred, sadness and joy.
1858;Having said that I won't reveal what happens to these characters, but like the christ story it is both a tragedy and a triumph.
1859;One of the best film.
1860;The music is astounding and the actors really drive home empathy with the prisoners as well as the prison guards.
1861;Great ensemble acting and it brings to life the chain of events of men on death row ~ one in particular who has a great gift he can share with others.
1862;shoes but credit must go to Michael Clark Duncan, the gentle giant with super.
1863;healing powers who gives every person he meets their just desserts.
1864;One of my all time favorites.
1865;David Morse is amazing also
1866;This movie has become a classic and looks excellent in hi.
1867;definition, making it a great pickup at the price I paid
1868;If you like a good story this movie is for you.
1869;One of the better movies that I've seen.
1870;The Green Mile is one of the best movies we have watched in quite a long while.
1871;The casting and acting is superb.
1872;Be aware that those who control Hollywood are using movies as propaganda vehicles to impose their agendas on others.
1873;this is a wonderful movie to watch i love watching it and to add to my collection is wonderful thing i want be loaning it out
1874;A wonderful film like this needs to be lenghty to set the mood.
1875;In this time we are introduced to very interesting characters and a VERY VERY well written supernatural fable.
1876;The themes hold something for everybody.
1877;Weather you are religious or not, you will see into the deep moral ideas that the film has to offer.
1878;Even though it is a fable, it has DEEP and realistic emotions that everyone can relate to.
1879;Plus it has a wonderful little mouse, that provides some comic relief, which fits.
1880;This is a classic and a must have for any Tom Hanks collection.
1881;Rest assured, gentle friend, because these three hours go by quickly.
1882;the movie is adapted from the Stephen King series about a gentle, kind.
1883;You'll laugh at this movie, so don't think it is a hard.
1884;minute documentary and Cast and Crew information.
1885;Blows my hair back, too, but the information is nice to have.
1886;Absolutely one of the finest films I have ever seen, spellbinding.
1887;I thought Hanks did a great job in 'Saving Private Ryan', but in this film he rose to new heights.
1888;"the metaphor of the demasculated black male's ""blessed subservience"" to the white man is profound."
1889;That's good because I don't see how it could have been shorter without wrecking it.
1890;For me, that was one of the film's greatest strengths.
1891;The guards are (with one glaring exception) very decent men who tend the inmates with great kindness and respect.
1892;They also execute them with similar kindness and respect.
1893;It also owes a great deal to the skilled visual design which makes the prison environment seem physically real.
1894;This thoughtful, haunting film is not naive by any means.
1895;John( the black guy) has done a really impressive acting since he is sad all the time, making me feel so bad when he got killed.
1896;Tom Hank is perfect always.
1897;this is an awesome movie and goes down in the books as a tom hanks classic.
1898;has to also be one of my favorite movies as well
1899;"One of the best prison movies of all time
1900;The best movie ever made it keeps you drawn to it from beginning to end Tom Hanks was great as always
1901;One of the best movies I've seen .
1902;But what makes Tom Hanks' character truly shine is that he has a heart of gold.
1903;John Coffey (played by Michael Duncan) is the biggest, strongest, but the gentlest prisoner brought in.
1904;Of course stated in better terms, but I found that to be the part I started bawling out.
1905;I actually ordered this movie as a Christmas gift for my cousin.
1906;I chose the highest rating, as I am very pleased with the product.
1907;This is an amazing movie full of exceptional talent!!
1908;I highly recommend this movie to everyone!
1909;This is Michael Clarke Duncan at his best!!
1910;I would recommend this movie to anyone.
1911;Tom Hanks is wonderful in anything he does and this is a great movie!
1912;king team up in SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION which is one of my favorite movies.
1913;I read THE GREEN MILE as it came out in its 6 installments, and as I read I knew it was made for the screen, and it has turned out to be a wonderful movie.
1914;Darabont may not beat his prior effort in SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, but the beautiful crafting of the storyline and the chemistry between Hanks and Duncan produce a great contender.
1915;The sound isn't taxing on your system, but is well done.
1916;Overall, a wonderful piece of work, nearly for the whole family.
1917;Great addition to anyone's collection, and a must of Stephen King fans.
1918;This is one of my favorite movies.
1919;I love this movie,Tom Hanks dose this part as only he can,it has love,humor,and violence tells a story of a Huge,sweet,harmless black man who has a gift of magical healings.
1920;This movie gets me right in the pump!
1921;tom Hanks can play any part and the rest of the cast were perfect in their roles.
1922;I could watch this movie again and again.
1923;This is an adaptation of a Stephen King serialized novel, andis extremely well done.
1924;I have never enjoyed settings like this in movies .
1925;But what is striking about this movie, right from the beginning, is that the prison guards are people you want to get to know .
1926;good people who care about their job, about the inmates, about their families, and about each other.
1927;so well, so intimately, is an extraordinary feature of this movie.
1928;Tom Hanks is such a superior actor that almost any movie in which he appears will be worth seeing.
1929;Add the fact that this film is brought to you by the same team that did the outstanding film, The Shawshank Redemption, and I thought I was in for a masterpiece.
1930;Three hours can work in the movies (see, for example, Braveheart, Schindler's List, and Dances with Wolves).
1931;But the story must be consistently engaging with a multitude of rich characters.
1932;Another fantastic movie starring Tom Hanks and a great supporting cast of officers and inmates.
1933;Story has no lulls an is interesting throughout the entire movie.
1934;Just a greant Hanks film you should see or own.
1935;With this film been 3 hours long some people may become immediatly apprehensive but there really is no need to as every minute of this film is gripping and intense as you really do empathise with the characters as you get to know them throughout the film, Tom Hanks delivers yet another great performance and you're looking at the film from his perspective throughout from when he his a pensioner and when he's looking back either that or younger.
1936;The acting is amazing in this film.
1937;The story is about the evils of man and has some very emotional moments.
1938;The immersing storyline and acting kept me totally absorbed and I finished the film feeling deeply enriched by its message.
1939;The Green Mile is a very satisfying piece of entertainment that also exposes many facets of human nature that turn a story into a legend.
1940;The message and everything is just wonderful.
1941;The friendship between the two first actors is something I would like to have.
1942;Tom Hanks finds himself in charge of Death Row at a penitentiary where a huge but gentle prisoner (played by Michael Duncan) has the gift of healing.
1943;The movie takes its time, and every second is worth gold.
1944;The Green Mile is a great movie to sit by a fire place and drink hot chocolate to, GB Mr. Pete
1945;This movie is worth every penny you pay for it.
1946;How he made this giant like character into a vulnerable pussycat was a marvel.
1947;On whole, the cast came together and gave the best performance I have seen in a movie for a long time.
1948;David Morse who is more known for his supporting roles was also excellent and hopefully not long till he's carrying his own movie.
1949;This movie is exceptional both in terms of a moving story line as well as the performance of the actors.
1950;Tom Hanks is good, but the real star is the guy with the gift .
1951;If you want to see Tom Hanks really shine in a good (and uplifting) film, check out That Thing You Do .
1952;And let's stop encouraging Hollywood to make movies that depict children being molested.
1953;part serial novel for the big screen and truely capture all the elements that made this story great?
1954;Tom Hanks is brilliant as prison guard Paul Edgecomb, a man who thought everything in his life was straight.
1955;Michael Clark Duncan makes you want to stand up in your living room to applaude his riveting performance as the simple John Coffey (like the drink.
1956;i highly recommend this video.
1957;The Green Mile is probably the most genuinely """"poetic"""" film we'll see."""
1958;"Yes, there's plenty of lyricism out there
1959;well, you get the idea: this film shouldn't obviously be """"art"""" ."""
1960;"He kept saying, especially, ""The mouse is brilliant."
1961;"irresistible!So: did I really want to sit through a long film, even with a ""brilliant"" mouse?"
1962;especially with a brilliant mouse, given the emotional possibilities.
1963;"Yes, ""Shawshank"" had been a superb film
1964;Maybe this was just """"Shawshank"""" Part Deux, and thus to be avoided."""
1965;the film had been an especially good cinematic equivalent.
1966;The Green Mile (full collected version of the original serial I'd neglected on its initial publication) turned out to be wonderful.
1967;More than a return to form: possibly King's masterpiece, actually, and certainly the work that confirms his claim to serious literary status .
1968;when he puts his mind and pen to the business of real story.
1969;Dad was right about the adaptation: the perfect screenplay of a literary masterwork.
1970;how powerful it is on the idea of the agony of survival of the dead by the living.
1971;every so often, a film gives you perfectly.
1972;"crafted and/or performed, truly indelible moments for your mind and heart to store (Al Pacino saying ""Prego"" ."
1973;The Green Mile has more of these than you can count.
1974;"indeed, every element of The Green Mile is flawless: Thomas Newman's exquisite score
1975;Sam Rockwell is amazing, too, roguish and repellent by turns.
1976;The pacing is perfect as well"
1977;study and striking, poignant incident to perfection.
1978;all of it is superb.
1979;The final miracle is that these perfect parts, not least Hanks' total authority in the lead/narrator role and Michael Clarke Duncan's eloquent, monumental silences, add up to an even finer whole: an engaging, moving work that tackles the burdens and joys of life in the most intelligent, imaginative way you could wish for.
1980;It is, in its way, is as profound as Shakespeare's Primrose Path (and again, if you saw my CV, you'd recognise this as the highest praise).
1981;"Watch it, please
1982;And remember my Dad's praise (and concealed warning to those of us of an empathetic disposition): """"The mouse is brilliant."""
1983;To move us with a mere mouse is one of cinema's great accomplishments, I think.
1984;by the touching endurance of Mr. Jingles.
1985;An imposing, but gentle prisioner, Coffey (not spelled like the drink) was convicted of killing two young girls.
1986;I loved Hanks and I love the movie.
1987;The supporting cast was outstanding.
1988;The special effects also caught my eye.
1989;This movie is a must.
1990;it's a great story and movie.
1991;This movie really hit home with me.
1992;superior acting ability was potrayed by all actors in this movie.
1993;A sure winner for every catagory available.
1994;The film has some great casting, great script adaptation and a pace to keep you interrested.
1995;well worth purchasing for repeated viewing.
1996;I believe that the message in this story is that you should be good to people so they be good to you.
1997;In this book there is always something happening to make you want to keep reading.
1998;If you are going to read this book you should like action and entertainment.
1999;First, Frank Darabont managed to create what amounts to the greatest prison film ever made with 'The Shawshank Redemption'.
2000;The entire cast was absolutely wonderful, and each of them was perfectly sited in their roles.
2001;Once again Tom Hanks delivers an oscar worthy performance and it is an unforgettable one.
2002;Sam Rockwell however turned in the best performance.
2003;Michael Clarke Duncan's John Coffey was so sweet and tender that it made me wake up and notice this actor for the first time.
2004;Bravo to Tom Hanks who seems to add magic to everything he touches!
2005;Great cast, great story, great movie!
2006;Read the book first, just because it's worth the read.
2007;but absolutely see the movie.
2008;You will laugh, cry and then sit in wonder as this amazing story unfolds!
2009;Both melancholy and uplifting at the same time, Frank Darabont's adaptation of Stephen King's serial novel reveals itself as the best I have seen.
2010;This movie should have won some awards.
2011;The casting is flawless and the acting is top notch and believable.
2012;It is superb and I cannot recommend it more highly.
2013;This was a surprisingly good movie.
2014;If you liked Beaches or Silence of the Lambs , give TGM a try.
2015;tom Hanks shines as an actor, as do almost all of the other cast members.
2016;What is more impressive is how Hanks works in prison.
2017;management skills into the movie.
2018;It is a good example to managers in all fields.
2019;The movie can easily been seen to the half.
2020;This was a good movie and would recommend it.
2021;I read the 6 part book when it first came out and as with almost any other Stephen King book, I loved it.
2022;Almost ever line in the movie came staight from the book and the scenes from the movie where perfectly done.
2023;If you have read the book, the movie is a must!
2024;But the film itself is amazing!
2025;delivery has always been fast and items correct.
2026;It turned out to be a great movie with a touching story line.
2027;The supernatural powers in the movie really took me by surprise.
2028;Tom Hanks, as usual was stunning in his role.
2029;the movie is about a gentle giant of a man who is convicted of murdering two young girls.
2030;The man is brought to death row and is discovered to have supernatural healing powers, and he can take and feel the pain of others as well as see people's hearts.
2031;This whole drama really kept my interest up throughout the movie.
2032;The characters are superb in their roles!
2033;This superbly acted, absorbing movie is based on the novel of the same name by Stephen King.
2034;All of the performances are sterling, and this is particularly impressive since most of the cast is asked to do one of acting's most demanding jobs: portray good people without seeming simple.
2035;Tom Hanks, perhaps the leading American actor of his generation, leads a cast as capable as he is.
2036;I noticed that one of King's themes is imprisonment.
2037;"Here, there are several imprisonments: John Coffey's capture in race and accusation and in his own remarkable gifts
2038;This is a wonderful movie based on a fine book.
2039;exceptional performances from everyone which, to me, is what makes a movie work.
2040;I love Tom Hanks movies.
2041;This is a movie that is a little far fetched in only one way but the rest of the story line is wonderful.
2042;It has been one of my favorites this year.
2043;What can I say but absolutely fantastic.
2044;Brilliant acting, fantastic directing and cinematography.
2045;Although only seen as the old Paul Edgecomb, Greer makes a memorable turn as the elder version of Tom Hanks in the movie's closing moments.
2046;His quiet and dignified soliloquy is truly touching.
2047;Greer, as well as all parties involved, magnificently brought one of Stephen King's best works to the screen.
2048;Along with The Shawshank Redemption, Mile ranks as the most faithful and cinematically satisfying of any jump from page to the cinema.
2049;This was probably one of the best movies I have seen in a while, with the exception of Gladiator.
2050;It was the perfect combination of mystery, suspense, comedy, and drama.
2051;It is a great movie to watch unfold.
2052;also, the book is good to read.
2053;A great story and a great meaning of life.
2054;There are miracles that many people can't explain.
2055;This movie is sad and happy.
2056;This is Tom Hanks best movie in my opinion.
2057;One of the best movies of all time.
2058;Director Frank Darabont has a definite connection with the writing of Stephen King, re.
2059;Other reviewers have blabbed away the magnificent plot, and everyone knows how wonderfully Michael Clark Duncan played JC.
2060;The entire ensemble cast was excellent, without exception.
2061;Tom Hanks is powerful in the lead, and strong performances from Sam Rockwell, Michael Jeter, Graham Greene, Harry Dean Stanton, Barry Pepper, Jeffrey de Munn, and David Morse are all, individually, brilliant, and added to ensemble brilliance.
2062;it was, I thought, a courageous performance.
2063;The extras are pretty much the same, with maybe a few added ones.
2064;of course I loved it.
2065;The numinous aspect of the story was also enjoyable, as it never seemed to overcome the humanistic portion of the tale.
2066;horror King films it has a certain, well.
2067;There is a kind of quaint, yet mystical element to these film versions that always seems to transplant you into their world for the duration of the film.
2068;Character development and themes of repentance pervade our dealings with Arlen and Del, and tug at our sympathy, while leaving almost no knowledge of their criminal acts to use in judging them.
2069;This is probably best, because they are fictional characters, so the filmmakers can't be excused of glossing over anything heinous, and it precludes a probable mire in dichotomy, which would lengthen an already long motion picture.
2070;it is always an interesting phenomenon, in my opinion, how all the dramatics, sweeping music, appealing actors, and other blandishments of the big screen can engender affinity with characters we would normally excoriate.
2071;This movie brings tears to my eyes.
2072;Until I got introduced to this film I feel my human side showing.
2073;I can only shed tears for the prisoners and the prison guard.
2074;You will get introduced to the dark nature as well as the light nature of man.
2075;The ending will introduce anyone including unfeeling people to their sensitive side!
2076;I remember viewing this film with several friends.
2077;And we all wished Duncan would have received the well deserved oscar.
2078;Stephen King can surprise with moving stories that inspire one to believe in spiritual things and that good can hide in unusual places.
2079;This movie adaptation of one of his books proves that.
2080;The actors are believable in a story that seems beyond belief.
2081;The first hour of the movie is necessary to get you involved and concerned with all of the colorful, tragic, and interesting characters.
2082;jerker, because it's more than that, but it does successfully tug at your heart many times.
2083;great movie, great performances, great script!
2084;This is a slow but good movie.
2085;But it is a great watch for those rainy have nothing better to days.
2086;1999 was a good year for films, and The Green Mile was one of those films.
2087;Michael Jeter's portrayal of Eduard Delacroix is truly marvelous.
2088;The transfer is marvelous, with only minimal edge enhancement.
2089;The Dolby Digital 5.1 sound mix wraps you in ambient effects, such as rain and thunder.
2090;the film's strength and the fine transfer overshadow the lack of extras on this disc.
2091;The ending was unexpected and much enjoyed.
2092;It really makes you value love and life.
2093;I am a big fan of Stephen king's writing.
2094;Just the true spirit of a good man placed on death row for the crime that another man commited.
2095;Tom Hanks's performance as paul Edgecomb is first rate, and Michael Clarke Duncan turns in a fantastic performance as John Coffey.
2096;Tom Hanks: best role since Big, and perhaps ever.
2097;Harry Dean Stanton: best role since Alien.
2098;Most of the rest of the cast: best role ever.
2099;droppingly good as a man who's simply at the end of his rope.
2100;The only role like that in the last thirty years or so has been Larry Drake's wonderful character on L. A. Law"
2101;up Oscar this year, and both The Green Mile and Life are equally deserving.
2102;"The special effects, what little were needed, are chilling, brutal, and unglamorous
2103;The direction is fantastic"
2104;This is one of the best, if not the best, of the year.
2105;Filmmaking in the nineties has only rarely been this good.
2106;Still one of the best movies of the decade.
2107;This is my favorite Tom Hanks movie.
2108;i watch it probably about every 18 months.
2109;Follows the book very well.
2110;This means you can expect a sharp plot line, emotionally tumultuous scenes, and novel characters so vivid that each is a story in itself.
2111;It goes without saying then, that the screenplay was a very true adaptation of the 6.
2112;part novel by King, the most accurate of any King work.
2113;He finds himself on Cell Block.
2114;(Yes, in a King story even inanimate objects are memorable characters.)
2115;What ensues is the relationship that develops between Edgecomb and Coffey, who seems to have an extraordinary gift .
2116;Though of the latter breed, you'll still get a taste of the trademark disturbed King in the Mile .
2117;all the chemistry between the prison guards (Hanks, David Morse, Barry Pepper, Jeffrey DeMunn) is admirable as well as believable.
2118;This camaraderie culminates in their plan to sneak J. c. out of his cell for a special healing.
2119;For one, we now have a new star, Michael Clarke Duncan.
2120;Mr. Jingles, the amiable mouse that frequents the green mile.
2121;It's an emotionally charged movie that may even be a little underdone (in a positive sense), something very rare in today's over.
2122;The Mile hits you where it hurts, in seeing injustice done to the bearer of truth.
2123;Of course you'll also see the best side of Stephen King, and we, like Paul Edgecomb, will see that miracles can happen anywhere.
2124;This is a great film about human redemption that you will watch with tears in your eyes and joy in your heart as the story undolds.
2125;This story, of a group of guards and prisoners on death row in Lousianana in 1935, is masterfully told and true.
2126;Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan are superb as a guard and giant prisoner, who has special healing powers.
2127;This is a great film but not a film for the squemish as some of the scenes are violent and fairly intense.
2128;This film deserved all the awards that it recently won and is destined to become a classic.
2129;I enjoyed The Green Mile the first time I saw it in a theater.
2130;I had to add it to my library and was I pleasantly surprised when I viewed it.
2131;The detail in this blu Ray disc is excellent, but the real bonus is the extra features at the end of the film.
2132;The amount of work that goes into making a first class motion picture is amazing.
2133;In the special features you get to see many of the details the director had to work on to produce this outstanding film.
2134;You'll see the enthusiasm of the actors as they read their lines and how the whole thing came together with all of the special magic of film making.
2135;Steven King should write more great books like this and Director Frank Darabont has to be one of the greatest directors of all time.
2136;I wish that I could thank everyone of them for the entertainment that they provided.
2137;"In 1994, Stephen King and Frank Darabont teamed up to bring the movie The Shawshank Redemption to the screen
2138;the Green Mile is a touching story about hope and redemption in a place where all things end in death.
2139;also stars an extensive list of great actors including David Morse, Bonnie Hunt, James Cromwell, and a cameo by Gary Sinise.
2140;everything about it, right down to the detail of the sets, is really poweful and amazing to see.
2141;and thanks for all the fish.
2142;I loved it, can't wait to own it!
2143;I was surprised at how good it was.
2144;I was also surprised at the lenght of the movie"
2145;After seeing this film, I plan to read the book for more details.
2146;I understand the book got great reviews, and I can see why.
2147;Go out and read the book first and then see this great movie.
2148;This recommendation is a sure winner for the reader as well as the movie goer.
2149;This is story telling at its best.
2150;It's beautiful and usefull at the same time.
2151;i really love this movie i'm a guy but i cried during this movie i reccommed this movie plus ghost also to very moving and touching film.
2152;This movie, The Green Mile , tells the touching story a miracle on E. block.
2153;Hanks played this role with perfection and shows of his talent.
2154;I strongly recommend this movie to anyone!
2155;or dismiss it as a prime example of sentimental hooey.
2156;inspired prison epic, `The Shawshank Redemption,' this new film provides far too sanitary and romanticized a vision of prison life to be either entirely convincing or particularly meaningful.
2157;Indeed, `The Green Mile' goes a step further into the realm of parable by ascribing to one of its main characters the power of miraculous healing.
2158;Amidst all this amazing good will between condemned killers and supportive prison guards, there has to be some vinegar to cut the sweetness.
2159;The evil prisoner, Wild Bill, provides a similar two.
2160;It sports a number of excellent performances, generates some moments of genuine emotional power and, though languorous at times in its pacing, admirably refuses to hurtle ahead as it patiently gathers the strands of its story together.
2161;As with a good long novel, one approaches it with a sense of patience and goodwill.
2162;We want to give it the benefit of our attention.
2163;Go to see this one!
2164;The picture and music were amazing, everything was amazing.
2165;The story himself make you watch this one just to make sure, to believe it.
2166;This is an excellent Stephen King story.
2167;It has a great plot and a very interesting ending.
2168;And, Tom Hanks is great, as usual.
2169;The directing and acting were superb but that is no reason to nominate this over Magnolia or the greatest film ever made Being John Malkovich .
2170;So in conclusion it was good and worth a viewing but multiple viewings will make you want the chair.
2171;My Daughter loves this and she is starting to collect .
2172;Great entertainment time after time.
2173;I will help herbuild with your help, thanks.
2174;The human scenes and characters, Tom Hanks chief among them, are so compelling without this extra layer, I cannot help but feel that this movie would have been even more powerful without resorting to the special effect moments of strangeness.
2175;"However, these flaws notwithstanding, Michael Duncan is riveting
2176;A fantasy portending to be something much deeper, The Green Mile is superbly packaged pulp, designed, it seems, for a younger audience, with excellent performances and production values.
2177;ray Book Packaging)This is one of Tom Hanks best movies, well all of his movies are great.
2178;I loved this movie, and now as Michael Clark Duncan""""s death come to us, this is even more great now."""
2179;I really enjoy the story.
2180;This is a great movie.
2181;This movie gives you a lot of mixed emotions.
2182;I laughed,i cried,and at some parts i was shocked.
2183;has a power to heal.
2184;In this movie it is very easy to get attached to the jailers by their personalities.
2185;del with the mouse makes you smile at how happy Del is because he has a friend and John (or maybe it's Jon.)
2186;I would highly recommend this movie to people who enjoy Steven King's novel.
2187;one of my fav movies long yes but very very good i watch it a few times a year .
2188;It was easily the best movie I have ever seen
2189;just like the character they portray so well on the screen.
2190;Tom Hanks gives a stunning perfomance in this moving and uplifting movie.
2191;Above all is the calm quiet manner of the warders on the death wing, a gentle group of men who care for a band of murderers at the end of their lives.
2192;This film is a triumph of the spirit, uplifting in the way the Shawshank redemption and the Sixth Sense get to you.
2193;It is inspiring and gives me hope that their is good in this world.
2194;this movie is very good lots of interesting sitsuations.
2195;I love John Coffee he is such an inocent man with a big heart and lots of love to give to all.
2196;Personally, I think the movie was very, very good.
2197;It has the emotions in it and that's a special thing in a movie.
2198;Every so often there comes an event.
2199;Not just a movie, but a whole event!
2200;Magic best describes this Story.
2201;The book was fantastic, and the movie acted as a lens at amplifying the effect!
2202;Hanks, once again, performs wonderfully while being backed up by a stellar cast of Above Average actors!
2203;The plot was truly original, and the ending is, without a doubt, not what you'd expect!
2204;This movie goes to show that excellent filmmaking is far from dead!
2205;Kudos to everyone involved in brining this masterpiece into a full and magnificent life!
2206;Throw together a master of suspense in Stephen King, a proven and acclaimed veteran actor Tom Hanks, and one of the largest and fastest rising stars name Michael Duncan, and you have a work of art.
2207;the Green Mile tells the tale of a giant man with a giant heart and a gift from above.
2208;Splendidly written, acted, and portrayed.
2209;This is one for the men and the women.
2210;One of the best movies ever!
2211;The actors are well chosen in this one!
2212;And gives the reader a great picture of what is happening and how criminals were dealt with in the earlier 1900's.
2213;Tom Hanks plays one of his best roles ever!
2214;I had heard that this was a great movie, everyone who wrote reviews on here had good things to say about it, so I decided that I would order it.
2215;I couldnt help but laugh at it.
2216;but oh well, I still thought it was good
2217;There were so many great characters and performances, it is hard to pick the best.
2218;I really enjoyed this movie.
2219;It will be time well spent.
2220;Great movie for a rainy Sunday afternoon.
2221;The movie is almost true to type.
2222;There are suttle differences, but that what made the movie good.
2223;It was also a hilarious movie with Coffey, Del, and Wild Bill.
2224;I loved the movie a lot!!
2225;Tom hanks is a great actor in this movie.
2226;I would recommend watching this.
2227;movie adaptations I've seen in a long time!This and 'The Shawshank Redemption' are two of King's best.
2228;One of the best movies I have ever seen.
2229;Tom Hanks gives a stellar performance.
2230;Anyone who loves Tom Hanks should definately see this movie.
2231;I love this movie and I love even more that it came to me in perfect condition, just like new!
2232;It has strong emotion and it will make you believe in miracles.
2233;Clarke's performance of Coffey is excellent and very contrasting in content (but not ability) to his performance in Armageddon .
2234;add a strong cast, some wonderful directing and on the mark adaptation of the novel, and you get a five star film.
2235;If you like the movie, read the novel.
2236;This is my most favorite movie, I could watch it over and over.
2237;I'm glad that I bought it to go with my movie collection.
2238;the characters are likeable and you get caught up in the story right away.
2239;Stephen King has written another gem that was destined to fly from the pages of his book to the big screen.
2240;The cast for this film was perfect on all accounts.
2241;the twists and turns are pleasant surprises throughout the film and you will remember a little mouse ( Mr. Jingles ) for the rest of your life after seeing this film.
2242;but a young teenager has probably already seen and heard everything above and beyond what this film delivers as far as adult content on prime time TV.
2243;The story is intense, however, and I can't imagine watching it over and over again.
2244;A darn good movie and it last and last and last.
2245;Hanks is excellent as well as all of the other actors.
2246;One of my favorite movies.
2247;From one of America's finest horror / thriller writer, Stephen KING, movingly and beautifully portrayed by the Director, Frank Darabont who once brought you another Oscar nominee, The Shawshank Redemption a few years ago, this is the story of, among others, a miracle of God in the final chapter of his life having been experienced and seen through the eyes of, among other witnesses, the Chief Guard of Cold Mountain prison in `30s ( Tom Hanks ).
2248;making as well as the ability to keep viewers enjoying, interested, curious and sitting still in front of the screen for literally more than 03 hours ( you won' t get bored, I confirm ).
2249;"tom Hanks, once again, at his best
2250;Great service, came in a timely fashion.
2251;Has a couple of blurps in it.
2252;I just saw this movie and I thought it was absolutely amazing.
2253;It was good because it had drama, suspense, action, a good storyline, everything needed in a good movie.
2254;I'd say that even if you don't like Tom Hanks, you should still see this touching movie.
2255;This was a great film which I enjoyed a lot.
2256;Call me harsh, but that is a bit of a selfish attitude when he possessed the ability to do so much good.
2257;From the story line to the characters, everything was perfect, which makes for a perfect movie.
2258;All of the people in the book were portrayed very well in the movie, but I thought that Billy the Kid could have been a bit better.
2259;Nothings perfect, but of all the things in the world, The Green Mile is the closest.
2260;this film has a fine ensemble cast with Hanks, Michael Clarke Duncan (why only Oscar.
2261;, Barry Pepper and David Morse in fine form.
2262;The other members of the cast are also very good with Doug Hutchison playing Percy the deranged guard with family connections, his most twisted and evil role since Victor Eugene Tooms in the X. files.
2263;And who can forget Mr Jinks, the miracle mouse who can play fetch with cotton reels?I'm normally a blockbuster viewer, lots of car chases and explosions, so this film is a real change of pace.
2264;Close your curtains, take the phone off the hook and enjoy.
2265;It all makes sense and although a fictional story I could well put myself in the shoes of Tom Hanks or any one of the talented supporting actors and believe in the 'giant.
2266;I can see why it's a hit with the audience though.
2267;I can see how it renews the faith of many, especially during this era in which it has become hip to be ironic and cynical.
2268;Very well acted and worth watching even though it can be haunting afterward.
2269;He thinks it is a great movie.
2270;The price was really very reasonable.
2271;From the acting and casting, this is a top rate movie.
2272;Stephen King had a unique vision in writing this story and the movie adaptation won't disappoint.
2273;This is definitely a touching movie based on miracles but there is no reason for those miracles.
2274;Not only is Coffey a quiet, shy, and gentle man, but he has a power in him that brings not only the guards, but also his fellow inmates, together, and also makes Edgecomb wonder if Coffey's truly a killer after all.
2275;nominated film has some truly fine acting in it as well.
2276;When he finally realizes just how special Coffey truly is, it only serves to reinforce those doubts.
2277;Duncan has had many good roles in films such as Armageddon and Planet of the Apes, but this is his best role to date.
2278;the Green Mile had a very good supporting cast as well.
2279;David Morse was excellent as Brutal Howell, as was Barry Pepper in the role of Dean.
2280;I loved Michael Jeter as Eduard Delacroix, the prisoner who develops a relationship with """"Mr. Jingles"""", a mouse that has been wandering about Death Row and amusing both guards and prisoners alike."""
2281;Doug Hutchison's sniveling, arrogant Percy Wetmore was just great, and Sam Rockwell impressed me as Wild Bill Wharton, a prisoner who holds the secret of what really happened to the Detterick girls.
2282;James Cromwell turned in a wonderful performance as Warden Moores, a man beset by his own domestic troubles who also has the opportunity to find out the secret of Coffey's power, and Dabbs Greer as old Paul Edgecomb was very good.
2283;all in all, The Green Mile was the finest film I've ever seen.
2284;I was somewhat disappointed by the fact that there were so few extras on it (one documentary, a trailer, and a cast and crew list that covered only the first 4 actors, plus Frank Darabont and Stephen King), but I still gave this one high marks because it's Frank Darabont's best film to date.
2285;It's definitely a keeper in my book.
2286;i read the book before I seen the movie This has been the best movie I've ever seen.
2287;One of the best movie best actors.
2288;Tom hanks is sweet and tough.
2289;Michael Clark Duncan is sexy too.
2290;There is no horror in this movie, but a fantastic story about a man, played by Duncan, who happened to have a healing gift and ends up on the Green Mile (name given by Hanks of the death row he supervises) after being found guilty for the murder of two little girls.
2291;And what will be the price he will pay for it?On top of a story greatly written, the cast is outstanding.
2292;"Duncan plays an incredible character
2293;glad to have it thank you very much it will be put to very good use once again thank you
2294;The cast has some powerful roles to step into, because of all the King material I've seen or read (I admit I haven't read the original """"Green Mile"""" book but have read most of his other novels and short stories plus seen most of the movies) this has one of the two greatest repertoires of characters: interesting, delved into indepth, most of them immensely likable and even the detestable ones highly interesting and fully."""
2295;"The only King work that compares in terms of such a multitude of A. list characters is the novel ""Black House"", co. written with Peter Straub (of course Black House's predecessor ""The Talisman"" contains arguably the greatest individual character (co.)created by King: Wolf."
2296;That no doubt sounds clich , but it's never been more true than it is here, with some of the greatest depictions of compassion, regret and remorse, and the existance of redeeming values in outwardly mean souls.
2297;Of course, there are also examples of some of the scummier examples of the human race here, and as is the case in a number of excellent stories, it's the mix and contrast of the 'bright' and 'dark' elements that give the movie so much of its potency.
2298;killer Coffey, a hulking giant who (thanks to great special effects) must be at least seven feet tall, and who because of his gentle, childlike nature immediately leads Hanks to question whether he could really be responsible for the crimes he was convicted of.
2299;if you're a Stephen King fan and have been putting off getting this one just because it's not horror I urge you not to deprive yourself: this is one of his best works regardless of genre.
2300;I can only say that this is perhaps the finest movie I have seen in years.
2301;It is funny, sad, tender and shocking (no pun intended).
2302;Hanks, as usual is superb and his supporting cast doesn't fail him.
2303;Tom Hanks and Michael Duncan are fantastic.
2304;Green Mile is the best film that i have seen this year.
2305;John appears to be an 8ft beast but turns out to be a gentle giant with special powers.
2306;favorite movie of all time.
2307;The surrounding cast is incredible and makes the movie a must for anyone's collection.
2308;A character who says, He killed them with their love for each other.
2309;oh, if for some reason you liked this movie, then you might also want to try Magnolia .
2310;He is exceedingly large and, seemingly, simple.
2311;The Cajun, of course, represented the good thief.
2312;When the warden's wife takes her Saint Christopher medal from her neck and puts it around John Coffey's, it strikes me as some a pre.
2313;well what can you say about the mouse.
2314;The Green Mile remains a completely affecting movie with wonderful performances by all.
2315;On the blu ray format, the video brings beautiful colorations free of grain, aliasing or artifacts of any kind.
2316;The menu itself provides a play, scene selection and special extras.
2317;There are a great many alternate languages that you can change it to if desired.
2318;Early in the movie, Tom Hanks is talking very quietly, in almost a whisper and I found it hard to hear and had to bring up the volume for that scene.
2319;I do have a very high end audio system that would be esoteric to most.
2320;I give the audio 3 stars at best.
2321;This movie runs long, but in the end, worth it.
2322;especially Stephen King's books, where the lion's share of the action takes place in people's minds.
2323;This movie is a rare exception, with flawless performances all around.
2324;see for King fans, and fans of the book.
2325;He takes his time with the story and the development of the characters.
2326;"Don't expect fast cuts and short scenes
2327;before I talk about the film, I have to mention a funny story.
2328;King was inspired by Charles Dickens, who also liked the serial novel format.
2329;Coffey is a simple man and seemingly gentle despite his size, but he was found guilty of murdering two little girls.
2330;one part of the story concerns the appearance of a mouse.
2331;The reaction of the individual warders reveals something about their own nature and it's a brilliant plot device.
2332;It's very powerful and some of the characters do extraordinary things.
2333;The stakes are high and the story is compelling.
2334;i'll say no more about the plot other than that the conclusion is very satisfying.
2335;darabont draws strong performances from every member of the cast.
2336;Hanks is superb as usual, but the story wouldn't work without Michael Clarke Duncan's performance and his Oscar nomination was well deserved.
2337;I could mention at least 15 actors who played their role to perfection.
2338;Darabont was nominated for Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay and the film deserved all of the recognition it received.
2339;The mouse should have won an Oscar.
2340;The story has a lot of heart and will stay with you long after the credits roll.
2341;Good films never feel too long, and this is a very good film.
2342;ups is exceptional and, apart from a few soft scenes, detail is generally strong throughout.
2343;I'm very happy with the upgrade, but it could have been slightly better.
2344;driven film, but the surrounds do play a part when required.
2345;Listen to the sound of the mouse running across the floor and you'll hear the fine detail in the mix.
2346;One electrocution is particularly noisy and you'll feel like it's happening right in front of you.
2347;depth look at every aspect of making the film.
2348;It's a stunning achievement and the story never feels boring despite the long running time.
2349;I give it a spin every three months or so and am always glad to visit that world once again.
2350;Anyone who enjoys good acting, master storytelling and emotional drama would probably find a lot to like in this film.
2351;The Green Mile is one of my all time favorite films!
2352;In my opinion it is much better than the single disc version.
2353;Very good cast and told well in movie form.
2354;Not quite a timeless classic,but should hold up well for a long time.
2355;this movie was definitelly worth seeing at least once, and while it has been criticized for its length, the fact is, one of the strengths of this movie was the ability for the director to flesh out each individual character.
2356;if you watched it 8 times, you'd already have spent an entire day of your life watching this movie), but for the one time that I did see it, I saw a movie of masterful artistry and skill, with great acting to boot.
2357;well, they can go on and have their Rambo IX .
2358;if you want an intelligent, well thought out movie, I would definitely recommend The Green Mile .
2359;I'm still digesting it, frankly, and I can't quite say yet if I'm happy that I saw it.
2360;Like most Stephen King, there are several twists and turns and a couple of miracles along the way.
2361;Shawshank, by the way, I wholeheartedly endorse, as a superior movie.
2362;Shawshank is one of the best movies I've ever seen, that leaves you emotionally drained and completely satisfied.
2363;This film, based on the Stephen King bestseller, is Frank Darabont's best film along with THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION.
2364;Tom Hanks, Michael Clarke Duncan, Barry Pepper, James Cromwell, Bonnie Hunt, Gary Sinise, and many other fine and talented stars headline this masterpiece.
2365;This, along with SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, is Tom Hanks' best performance.
2366;The visual effects, although there aren't many, are dazzling.
2367;The mix of comedy, drama, fantasy, and mouse hunting make it a film that certainly deserves to be on every movie fan's top ten list of all time best movies.
2368;The ending, although quite sad, is still a happy one.
2369;Everybody who loves GREAT movies should see this.
2370;Trust me, it will make your day.
2371;Every scene is thought out to either add to the depth of the story or to create more pathos with the characters.
2372;I enjoy a long movie, and many times I wish that directors had added more scenes to the movies.
2373;So many things are more enjoyable this way.
2374;But I finally, finally saw this movie, and I enjoyed it.
2375;acted, nicely shot, and at moments quite moving, 'The Green Mile' is ultimately undone by its staggering 188 minute running time.
2376;This is a good lesson in filmmaking: you can have a fine director, a savvy cinematographer, a marvellous score, an excellent cast, and $60 million to play with .
2377;Frank Darabont's """"The Green Mile"""" is a film that takes its time and unfolds meticulously."""
2378;The performances themselves are excellent although Hanks may have been a little too young for his character.
2379;Duncan, Doug Hutchison, David Morse, Sam Rockwell, Barry Pepper, Harry Dean Stanton, Bonnie Hunt, William Sadler, James Cromwell, Gary Sinise, and Patricia Clarkson are all great but the film is still underwhelming despite their best efforts.
2380;Maybe one of the finest movies I have ever seen.
2381;John Coffee is a very good man.
2382;He new it, but excepted it anyways.
2383;Well written and played story by Stephen King.
2384;I watched this with my teen boys and it made a solid impression with them.
2385;Good display of characters, personality types and beautiful performance by Michael Clarke Duncan.
2386;This is a great movie.
2387;One of the years best pictures,with incredebly good actors as we have never seen before!
2388;Even better than the Book written by Steven King!
2389;The movie shows us how life can be dark and unfair but also a beautyfull gift.
2390;And this movie bestows magic .
2391;for those of you that have watched my phrase will make sense for those of you that haven't, well watch it and you will.
2392;This is a great movie!!
2393;The Green Mile is one of the best movies I've ever seen despite being three hours long.
2394;Tom Hanks was outstanding and the screenplay adaptation was wonderfully written.
2395;Michael Clark Duncan really steals the show as John Coffey, a gentle huge man with strange supernatural powers, who brings a sense of spirit and humanity to his guards and fellow inmates at the death row of the Lousiana country prison.
2396;this was an outstanding production from beginning to end.
2397;The whole atmosphere, especially the settings in the Green Mile and the execution chamber, are touching, unpleasent, and fascinating all at the same time.
2398;I definitely reccomend this movie to anyone and if you can manage to stomach the execution scenes, then you'll enjoy this fast moving and perfectly made drama.
2399;You know how when you read a book you form a picture of the characters, the surroundings etc., well the movie was right on the mark for me.
2400;The actors would have been more than capable of delivering the same touching performances without the lights and such.
2401;But still, this is a great movie.
2402;The best adaptation of a Stephen King novel to date.
2403;There is a smoothness of this film, and a sadness as it nears its inevitable end, which holds the attention and completely disregards the 3+ hour length.
2404;Any who have seen it, will always remember it.
2405;michael Duncan Clark, as John Coffee, is the spritual heart of this film.
2406;As the film unfolds, he is found to Tom Hanks and others to be a creature of God.
2407;He is able to see into peoples' hearts, and know their wrongs.
2408;in my mind, this is the role Tom Hanks will hold as the pinnacle of his career.
2409;It is then that Hanks understands his charge is more than just something special.
2410;the theme of Coffee's gift is shown as he revives life into Mr. Jingle's, a mouse living on The Mile.
2411;This is definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen!
2412;Its got it all: drama, action, and even comedy (the whole Mr. Jingles thing is a riot).
2413;Basically, this movie is about Paul Edgecomb,(an amazing Tom Hanks) a Death Row prison guard who is in charge of the executions during the Great Depression.
2414;If sad movies don't bother you, The Green Mile is SO worth your time.
2415;I've been waiting for this new classic to hit a great price for blue ray.
2416;This is a must see for any Tom Hanks fan.
2417;This movie will definitely be remembered as one of the strongest anti.
2418;Its screenplay will also be remembered as the one that stays the closest to the book author's intentions.
2419;Stephen King is often dissatisfied with the way his novels are adapted for the screen, but I am sure he was pleased with The Green Mile.
2420;nighters the likes of Scream s and, ironically, American Beauty.
2421;John Coffey's powers needed to be demonstrated sparingly and with great deal of care.
2422;tom Hanks became America's leading dramatic actor thanks to good directors who noticed a huge potential housed in a regular joe appearance.
2423;In recent years, hit by hit, he continuously displayed enough sensitivity and charisma to make his characters memorable, yet he never over.
2424;did it and the pathos that he delivers are of subtle nature, he lives every role, no matter how unusual, and brings the essential humanity and kindness to the viewer.
2425;The thing that seems to Paul perfectly natural .
2426;There is definitely more to this athletic looking guy than meets the eye!Now, for the huge (and I mean huge!)
2427;the miraculous (and extremely taxing on John) treatment of the warden's ill wife is chilling, I literally held my breath.
2428;Kudos to the Frank Darabont for finding the most wild Wild Bill imaginable!
2429;Many of my friends and I, as well as many respectable film critics, thought it was worthy of an Academy Award.
2430;I would recommend it to anyone.
2431;"Having first read ""The Green Mile"" when Stephen King published them in Chapter Books, I was in love with the story even before it made it to the big screen."
2432;"After ""Dolores Clairborne"", ""The Green Mile"" is without a doubt the best film adaption of a Stephen King story."
2433;Tom Hanks plays a prison warden in Florida during the Great Depression, and it is through Hank's character that we as an audience encounter many prison characters and prison officers, some good and some bad.
2434;The most interesting of all the characters in the film is John Coffey, played brilliantly by Michael Clark Duncan.
2435;Coffey also has special healing powers, and once we know Coffey's background and innocence we root for him in his survival from being killed on death row.
2436;The Green Mile is one of the greatest prison films of all.
2437;"time, and it ranks up there with ""Midnight Express"" and ""The Shawshank Redemption""."
2438;There is also an informative ninety minute documentary on the making of the movie.
2439;The Green Mile won four Academy Award nominations including Best Picture and Best Supporting Actor for Micheal Clark Duncan.
2440;Either way, it's powerful and moving.
2441;I used to enjoy Stephen King's books.
2442;Now THE GREEN MILE was bought for my husband, and he enjoyed this movie a lot.
2443;I was one of those who saw the movie before reading the book(s), and I have to say that the movie actually surpassed the book, a rare accomplishment indeed.
2444;Frank Darabont is set on an incredibly promising career.
2445;this movie was simply astounding.
2446;he naturally scores himself another winner with this one.
2447;it should've won the oscar for best picture.
2448;This is one of the best movies I have ever seen bar none.
2449;The movie builds the characters including some the prisoners so completely you feel as if you know them.
2450;This movie touched my very soul and spoke more directly to my joy, pain and life experience than any other experience I have known.
2451;His performance is so powerful that Tom Hanks seems to be along just for the ride
2452;The best thing about this movie is that, at three hours, it's paced fairly well.
2453;important excuse of a film.
2454;Great movie just as I remember the first time I saw it.
2455;I really enjoy being able to pick up some of the older movies on Blue ray.
2456;"Love this movie
2457;Can even forgive the minor discrepancies between the book and the movie as one doesn't detract from the plot [minor character changes] and the other [Mr. Jingles NOT passing in the movie] makes the ending more heartfelt.
2458;The Green Mile , an epic flim representation of the serial book series written by King in the mid 1990s, is an example of how some films are just as good as the book.
2459;adequate performance as the head chief of a maximum.
2460;the film has a great supporting cast, especially that cute little mouse Mr. Jangles (not credited), and an excellent, emotionally.
2461;involved script that will grab viewers and keep them captivated until the very end.
2462;While a little long in its deliverance, this motion picture is one that can truly touch the hearts of individuals and shed tears in those who would not have thought possible.
2463;A supernatural tale that seems out of place in portions, but overall a heartwarming drama that will surprise, scare, and arrest you.
2464;Delivery fast and the movie is an all time favorite!
2465;Tom Hanks, the late and sorely missed Michael Duncan Clarke, and great supporting cast make this movie a constant watch over in my home.
2466;It shows a lot of caring for those who need to be heard, even when most think he is guilty.
2467;Must watch and learn something that a lot of people never seem to understand.
2468;My wife and I found THE GREEN MILE deeply entertaining.
2469;There are times, of course, when the director obviously goes for viewer's tears, and some of the characters seem two.
2470;At the same time, however, the care taken to demonstrate that compassion and humanity could develop even in death row works"
2471;A couple of the scenes, due to their grisly nature, make this movie inappropriate for most younger viewers, but one of its themes, that one's stature depends a great deal on how one treats others, seems more poignant in contrast to those scenes.
2472;I offer a warm recommendation for this film.
2473;What an amazing movie that somehow weaves in the magical without it feeling silly.
2474;And what amazing, rich characters.
2475;One of my top movies now.
2476;Based on an incredible story, this is an incredible movie.
2477;I have seen enough Stephen King stories adapted for the big screen that have ben train wrecks, it's nice to see a writer/director combo that can fill out the story and make it come alive the way the Green Mile does.
2478;The casting is absolutely perfect all the way around and this remains one my all time favorite movies.
2479;I can watch it again and again and it never gets old.
2480;The movie was well done.
2481;showing how prison life is in reality and the actors were exceptional.
2482;It's a powerful movie about John Coffey, a man with strange powers who is on death row for the murder of two little girls.
2483;but Tom Hanks's character see's something special in him and is determined to find out the secret behind Coffey.
2484;This movie is powerful and emotional and will touch you.
2485;This movie taught: That the state loves to kill innocent African men, African people are mystical in their right mind, People will follow the system rather than their conscience, and more.
2486;Darabont followed up his brilliant adaptation of King's Shawshank novella with this brilliant adaptation of the serial novels The Green Mile.
2487;The characters are all incredibly memorable and brilliantly cast.
2488;perhaps the best of all of the King adaptations, the Green Mile will make you laugh and make you cry, but most of all, it will make you CARE.
2489;This movie is the best book to film adaptation I have ever seen.
2490;I highly recommend people to read the book first and then watch the movie.
2491;One of Tom Hanks best movies.
2492;Great story, good directing, and very good acting.
2493;Fast shipping and got it at a good price.
2494;thank you for the memories.
2495;How Stephen King came up with such a poignant and heartfelt tale is beyond me, maybe it was divine intervention, but the story of the Green Mile is a unique and moving film, the likes of which I've never seen before.
2496;The performances in this film were Oscar worthy, building on the success of their last collaboration, The Shawshank Redemption, King and Durabont, got the biggest star in Hollywood to star in this film.
2497;The combination of a strong sentimental story along with the acting power of Tom Hanks made this film one for the ages.
2498;The supporting cast, in particular Michael Clarke Duncan and Sam Rockwell, were tremendous assets to the film and their careers were launched with the help of Hanks's experience and King's amazing words, but this film is far from perfect.
2499;The story, in particular the ending were so powerful, that a lot of the in between could have been left on the cutting room floor.
2500;That aside, this is a long, but fantastic film with some of the best writing and performances you could find.
2501;I did get it and I feel the better for it.
2502;This is one of those films, love it or hate it, that everyone should see at least once.
2503;When a bond is made between prisonmate and guard, it is a touching display because you see the good in human nature.
2504;The Green Mile is a heart warming and heart wrenching story, see it with someone you love.
2505;Tom Hanks at his best, and Michael Clark Duncan was absolutely phenomenal in this role.
2506;All the actors did a GREAT job!
2507;I think it was stunning how good Michael Clarke Duncan was!
2508;I had seen him in a few other movies, but this was his best performance so far!
2509;I hope to continue seeing him.
2510;He had so many feelings for Duncan the two of them worked great together.
2511;EVeryone did a fantastic job!
2512;The plot is equally as good.
2513;The conflicts get bigger and bigger the plot just keeps adding up to create a masterpiece.
2514;This was the best movies I have seen in forever.
2515;Michael does a stunning job playing John Coffey, a simplie minded black man with the gift of healing.
2516;I could almost feel what his character was going thru, as he played the part so well.
2517;The Green Mile is a lengthy but rewarding retelling of the Jesus parable.
2518;John Coffey (Jesus Christ, both JC) is a gentle giant, wrongfully convicted of a crime he did not commit.
2519;Lots of visuals reinforce this storyline, such as the movie projector behind Coffey creating a halo.
2520;overall, the cast is superb, and the storyline is extremely well written.
2521;Despite its length, this film is well worth the time.
2522;Enter John Coffey, He's eight feet tall.
2523;He has hands the size of waffle irons.
2524;And Edgecomb, as well as the other prison guards .
2525;Brutus, a sympathetic guard, and Percy, a stuck up, perverse, and violent person, are in for a strange experience that involves intelligent mice, brutal executions, and the revelation about Coffey's innocence and his true identity.
2526;The Green Mile is a rare gem.
2527;This movie is a work of art, at it's very best.
2528;The depth of the cast is extraordinary, with all of the players delivering excellent performances.
2529;There is a clear sense here that all involved in the production knew that this was something special, and gave it their all.
2530;The Green Mile is a very touching drama, with the joys and sorrows of the life pictured with great skill.
2531;Mesmerizing and thought provoking movie.
2532;The movie was brilliantly addapted from the Steven King Novel.
2533;The way this movie is presented to the audience the story unfolds to you so smoothly.
2534;This could be a great movie to cuddle with a partner have some ice cream with hot fudge.
2535;Frank Darabont has to be one of the best storytelling directors in the business today.
2536;I was surprised to see him crying couple of times during movie.
2537;There were incredible scenes (not about supernatural stuff) about the feelings , fun , joy , sentimental , anger , shock and miracles.
2538;I really loved every bit of it .
2539;And the scores rises the effect on the movie.
2540;This is a very good movie.
2541;Tom Hanks is great as always and Michael Clark Duncan is just as good!
2542;The movie is a bit long but it's so good it keeps you into the movie thus you don't really mind the time length of the film.
2543;this is a highly entertaining movie and deserves a place in any true movie fan's collection.
2544;Took me several years to final watch it but now it is one of my favorites and I watch it every chance I get!
2545;As always, Tom Hanks gives a great performance.
2546;This is a really good movie, that is made a great movie by the last line spoken in the movie.
2547;The line said by Tom Hank's character is so memorable, and will really make you think long after seeing the movie.
2548;The movie is all together very good.
2549;All the actors did a great job in theis movie especially Tom Hanks, which he always does.
2550;One of the greatest movies I have seen.
2551;The message is wonderful, a must see.
2552;I read the book first and I highly recommend that everyone do this, but I am sure it is not necessary to enjoy this movie.
2553;The Green Mile is an excellent adaptation of the book.
2554;It is gripping and will tug at your heart for sure!
2555;Tom and Michael are excellent with a great supporting cast.
2556;I saw this movie well over 15 years and enjoyed it very much so I had it shipped to my son.
2557;The Green Mile is the best movie in the world.
2558;Tom Hanks is the best actor that ever graced the Big Screen.
2559;The storyline is the most heartwarming storyline i have ever seen in a movie.
2560;this movie deserved more than 5 stars but, if i was to rate it honestly it would get at leat 10 stars.
2561;Stephen King is a great writer and the production of his book did it justice.
2562;It was heart warming and dramatic!!
2563;Great actors like Tom Hanks, Michael Clarke Duncan, David Morse, Bonny Hunt and other great actors!!!
2564;I will, however, say that in my opinion it's the best film adaptation based on a work by Stephen King that's been done so far.
2565;It also has a new 6.
2566;featurette documentary on the making of The Green Mile that will pretty much tell you everything that you want to know.
2567;There's also a commentary by Frank Darabont with the film.
2568;All the new material is excellent with up.
2569;date interviews that includes most of the cast and crew.
2570;date interview with Stephen King about the film.
2571;That's exactly what it sounded like.
2572;Of course, Stephen King is still alive.
2573;This is the definitive edition of The Green Mile!
2574;"The most important question is simple and straight forward
2575;The three hour film is now spread over two dual layered discs allowing breathing room for the sound and images along with the inclusion of a commentary track from the director.
2576;While the previous edition released in 1999 looked extremely nice this edition has sharper images and better definition.
2577;we get a terrific and informative Commentary by writer/director Frank Darabont.
2578;we also get a great 90 minute documentary on the challenges (and fears)that Darabont faced in making another Stephen King project.
2579;He was afraid that he would be seen only as a Stephen King director (or a director of prison dramas which are hardly in vogue right now)which might limit his options as a director later in his career but he realized that the material was so powerful in human drama that it was worth the risk.
2580;nevertheless having compared my previous edition to this for the $6 extra dollars this is the edition to get.
2581;rEVIW OF THE FILM BELOW:""""The Green Mile"""" the third film made by Frank Darabont from Stephen King's work is surprisingly strong and an outstanding follow up to Darabont's version of """"Shawkshank""""."""
2582;nominated for four Academy Awards (including Best Picture)this is a rich drama with strong performances all around including a terrific and moving performance from Tom Hanks in the lead.
2583;Well worth picking up for fans of King's work but, more importantly, for fans of moving dramas/fantasy films with more than touch of reality.
2584;I loved the movie (minus the horrific execution scenes and other disturbing parts), but the ending I thought fizzled out.
2585;Oustanding performances by Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan.
2586;a fictional story that remind us about injustice and discrimination, but also about loving and helping the human being next to us!
2587;Saw it a long time ago and liked it better the first time.
2588;The Green MileNot quit reality but great acting that keeps your attention.
2589;the co star, David Moss is gone so this will be one of the opportunities to view his powerful work.
2590;The Movie takes us thru the levels of human frailty and disbelief.
2591;we limit ourselves to what we can see, hear and touch and yet this movie gives a glimpse into a much bigger universe of possibilities.
2592;Tom Hanks gives a performance that is both insightful and full of depth for a person put in the position of his character.
2593;This was a great movie.
2594;The actors actually did a good job of portraying the times and what they all did.
2595;My advice would be to see this movie, because it's nothing short of a masterpiece!
2596;Always brings a tear to the eye.
2597;What I didn't expect was that the Green Mile would be powerful and uplifting.
2598;What I saw was an awesome, inspiring, uplifting, funny, and sad movie.
2599;Yes The Green Mile is 3 hours long(I actually wish it was 4 hours) but you'll love it.
2600;the acting, the underlying themes about judgement, trust, and truth.
2601;The supernatural elements of the movie become spiritual lessons.
2602;Very entertaining movie, this movie was made from a Stephen King book, and is certainly one of his best.
2603;The Green Mile expertly mixes film genres: It's part prison flick, part supernatural mystery and part drama.
2604;"profound film
2605;hearted giant and begin to realize that he is eminently gifted in a decidedly supernatural way"
2606;hour film, way over my limited attention span, and yet it is somehow utterly engrossing, even on repeat viewings.
2607;The film is character/dialogue driven, unique and wholly unpredictable.
2608;The fact that it largely takes place in a prison in the 1930s is a secondary issue.
2609;This is an incredibly powerful supernatural mystery/drama.
2610;He pronounces and executes divine judgment.
2611;It ranks up there with my 5 or 10 best.
2612;All my friends told me about how great it was and so I started reading the book while I waited for the movie to be delivered.
2613;It is exactly what I imagioned when I read the book!
2614;Soon the prison guards for E block discover that he has a gift to heel people and some sort of other power.
2615;It is a very good story, I almost cried and deserves more than 5 stars.
2616;i won't give away any plot details here, but suffice it to say that pretty much everyone will enjoy this film.
2617;While the subject matter and language (the film IS set in a prison) rules out the kiddies, pretty much anybody else should find it to be an inspiring journey, as the movie explores the themes of death, love, and doing the noble deed in the face of great opposition.
2618;It was with unprecedented anticipation that I awaited this film.
2619;The prior collaboration of this team of talented filmmakers resulted in the production of my favorite film of all time: The Shawshank Redemption.
2620;And, indeed, while The Green Mile hasn't assumed that title, it certainly remains one of the greatest movies I've ever seen, one of the greatest movies ever made.
2621;It is that engaging, that beautiful a film, and it deserves all the respect one can bestow upon it.
2622;simply put, the story is positively phenomenal.
2623;The structure is magnificent, as we travel from episode to episode, covering every fascinating subplot and side.
2624;story, and then intertwining all of them together in the end.
2625;Certainly, Duncan has all of the physical attributes that make him appropriate for the part, but moreover his performance excels beyond what anyone expected.
2626;The character in the novel is one that can hardly be imagined, it is such an innocent brute of gentleness, yet Duncan manages to capture all of that and more.
2627;Frank Darabont's direction is immaculate, as always.
2628;It's amazing what he is able to accomplish in such a limited set.
2629;Most of the film occurs within the death row penitentiary block, yet he somehow manages to capture a new image in every shot, making it perpetually interesting, and never redundant despite its solitary location.
2630;I had read the books years prior, enjoyed them heavily, and thus waited eagerly for the film adaptation.
2631;"Every aspect of this film is enjoyable
2632;The film keeps a steady pace that develops and moves on, never straying.
2633;The finished product is a near seamless adaptation of a fine book, transporting it to an exceptional movie.
2634;Indeed, Mile even manages to surpass Shawshank in several respects: it has a more emotional basis, its stories are better entwined, it conquers the mood of the moment more wholly.
2635;The Green Mile stands as one of filmmaking's best, one of my favorites, and one that is sure to please you as well.
