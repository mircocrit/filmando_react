I:8621;1;This movie is a perfect A film noir.
I:8621;2;It has a compelling narrative, a sympathetic anti hero, a sinister femme fatale, and wonderful banter dialogue between Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray.
I:8621;3;(See the film you'll understand.)
I:8621;4;It is here that he first meets Phyllis.
I:8621;5;of course, the sexual sparks fly and Phyllis ends up convincing Walter to help her take out a life insurance policy on her older husband without his knowledge, and then help her murder him in order to collect the double indemnity.
I:8621;6;with starkly realistic in its exteriors and carefully foreboding interiors, Double Indemnity is a triumph of psychological suspence with John Seitz's glorious black.
I:8621;7;double Indemnity is nothing short of a masterpiece, beautifully capturing all the elements of forties film noir.
I:8621;8;Full of energy and compulsion, these actors effectively propel the taught story forward, and make the film a truly compelling classic piece of work.
I:8621;9;Deep down Walter really is a nice guy .
I:8621;10;constantly telling Keyes that he loves him .
I:8621;11;Double Indemnity is truly a great film, and stands as an all round grand American classic.
I:8621;12;but the movie also stands as a fascinating portrait of two flawed individuals who are so unhappy with their lives that they succumb to their human failings and decide to take the easy way out.
I:8621;13;The actuarial tables are cited to show the encyclopedic knowledge of insurance companies.
I:8621;14;Daughter Lola meets Neff and tells him some old facts, and some new ones!
I:8621;15;There is now great danger for Phyllis and Neff.
I:8621;16;One important part of this story is the background of life in 1944 Los Angeles.
I:8621;17;I like film noir movies in general and this is one of the better ones.
I:8621;18;This is probably Fred MacMurray's best performance.
I:8621;19;top in this one, or perhaps MacMurray and Robinson got the best lines.
I:8621;20;A great adaptation of James M. Cain's novel of murder and betrayal.
I:8621;21;this legendary thriller is one of the greatest and most influential and most imitated films in motion picture history.
I:8621;22;the dialogue is intelligent, the plot is engrossing and the cast stellar.
I:8621;23;the picture is very grainy through most of the film.
I:8621;24;it is certainly among those films that deserved the special treatment but appears as though the distributers and studio used the first negative available for the transfer.
I:8621;25;nominated gem tells the twisted tale of a scheming black widow (played by Barbara Stanwyck) who draws a smooth.
I:8621;26;This is the first time that I have watched DOUBLE INDEMNITY 70TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION and it looks great on Blu.
I:8621;27;The transfer is fantastic with sharp image resolution and dark blacks, which is really important since light and shadow play such a HUGE role in the way the film was made and also to punctuate the storyline.
I:8621;28;Turner Classic Movie (TCM) host and film historian Robert Osborne provides an intro to the movie and gives some insight.
I:8621;29;It also discusses the film noir genre, casting the movie, cinematography, and locations etc., and was very entertaining, as well as informative.
I:8621;30;Now that sadly the world of cinema has lost the great Billy Wilder all we can do is marvel at the man's films who proved to be one of the most talented and versatile directors of his day.
I:8621;31;And, to me, it is one of the most perfectly constructed films ever.
I:8621;32;"based on James M. Cain's novel (he also wrote ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"", another one of the great noir films) and brought to screen by Wilder and Raymond Chandler ( Chandler too wrote some of the best noir stories ever, ""The Big Sleep"", ""The Long Goodbye"", and his first script ""The Blue Dahlia"")""Double Indemnity"" tells the story of what seems to be the perfect crime."
I:8621;33;An investigator who has 26 years of experience.
I:8621;34;As far the rest, well, just watch the movie and see what happens.
I:8621;35;"Double Indemnity has that ""classic"" noir look we expect from films in the 40's."
I:8621;36;And the beautiful cinematography by John Seitz is wonderful to look at.
I:8621;37;it's amazing that for a film that is well over 60's years old, Wilder managed to create a film that still seems fresh and is actually smarter then some of the films we have being released today!
I:8621;38;That was and always will be what made Billy Wilder one of the all.
I:8621;39;Double Indemnity fits very comfortably into that mix.
I:8621;40;The plot line is familar.
I:8621;41;You know it is a modern morality play, after all.
I:8621;42;Fred MacMurray before he became father knows best.
I:8621;43;Double Indemnity is one of Billy Wilder's best films.
I:8621;44;It is a classic film noir and it contains all the trimmings to make it what it is.
I:8621;45;Billy Wilder did an excellent job making this film one of my favorites full of dark, spooky, and eerie film with a plot full of suspense.
I:8621;46;He finds that when he arrives Mr. Dietrichson isn't present, and the only one who is present is the wife, Phyllis Dietrichson, who Walter finds very attractive.
I:8621;47;He visits he again, and soon they have a growing relationship.
I:8621;48;I would recommend this film to anyone and everyone who loves to sit and watch movies especially if they like movies with crimes, murder, a plot full of suspense and drama, and even love.
I:8621;49;The youth of today will never understand what really good Film.
I:8621;50;making is until they see a film that has a solid story, genuinely inspired direction, and nothing short of tour de force acting by the likes of more than mere stars like Robinson, Stanwyck, and MacMurray.
I:8621;51;"MacMurray is remarkable here
I:8621;52;This is the most fascinating must.
I:8621;53;see film of a lifetime.
I:8621;54;this 1944 classic centers on insurance salesman Walter Neff as he is conned into committing a heinous crime by the beautiful and intoxicating Phyllis Dietrichson.
I:8621;55;Phyllis proposes that Walter sign her husband up for accident insurance without his knowledge so that he can have an `accident' and she can collect the insurance payout.
I:8621;56;Walter catches on to her game and is initially put off, but his infatuation with Phyllis, and her cries of unfair treatment from her husband, cause him to change his mind and soon he is conning the very company for which he works.
I:8621;57;with sharp dialog and a plot filled with believable and dastardly twists, `Double Indemnity' is a brilliantly crafted film noir that stands firm as one of the best of the breed, and quite possibly one of the best in any breed come to think of it.
I:8621;58;The acting is superb and the direction is flawless.
I:8621;59;Fred MacMurray wonderfully sinks into his character, exposing his raw naivety when it comes to the advances of a cunning woman, and his guilt ridden core is masterfully blinded by his own desire for everything to be as he planned.
I:8621;60;watching a film like `Double Indemnity' makes me wish that every film were as complete and satisfying as these films of old.
I:8621;61;The stories were all so well thought out and elaborate, tightly woven to entice all of our senses.
I:8621;62;Double Indemnity is my first experience in traditional film noir and i quite enjoyed it.
I:8621;63;The film stood out to me in a number of ways, mostly the unique story and the look of the film.
I:8621;64;ok this is one of the best films noirs of allt ime and one of the best films OVERALL of all time.
I:8621;65;its really suspenseful especialyl the part at the train,it keeps you wondering what will happen.
I:8621;66;A famous candid photo of Snyder's 1928 electrocution appeared in the NY Daily News.)
I:8621;67;A really, really good movie.
I:8621;68;macMurray abandons his good guy persona in this film, having a staccato delivery, while Robinson abandons his bad guy persona.
I:8621;69;My only complaint is the baddies proclaiming their love for one another after just a short period of time rang false, but, hey, the film is still good.
I:8621;70;This is one of my favorite movies with Barbara Stanwyck.
I:8621;71;fast paced, and intriguing movie.
I:8621;72;It's a very good film noir with a great femme fatale in Barbara Stanwyck's character.
I:8621;73;Fred MacMurray does his part very well.
I:8621;74;Something I hadn't noticed enough the first time is that how well he delivered his lines with a straight face.
I:8621;75;There is a bit of a playful repartee between him and her that seems to have sealed the deal what Double Indemnity is going to be all about.
I:8621;76;That being written, all the credit goes to Billy Wilder and Raymond Chandler for penning a witty script.
I:8621;77;It's really the writing that makes the characters and the setting to come alive.
I:8621;78;Edward G. Robinson, as great as he is in so many films, is not nominated for his superb performance.
I:8621;79;He always makes it sound so fascinating.1973 VersionViewed: 9/13Rate: 39/13: Richard Crenna sure mailed it in in the first fifteen minutes of the unnecessary remake of Double Indemnity.
I:8621;80;Remember in the original that there was a good repartee between Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck's characters, something to do with the speeding limit.
I:8621;81;Exceptional plot and acting in the great Hollywood tradition.
I:8621;82;in addition to the great plot and suspense, the film doesn't waste its time with sloppy physical scenes, just the classic embrace and cut to cigarette smoking.
I:8621;83;the movie speeds along drawing the viewer into its inevitable conclusion with a great supporting role by Edward G Robinson.
I:8621;84;The original Double Indemnity is excellent.
I:8621;85;But having just watched it after watching the original (and each commentary track), I love the original all the more.
I:8621;86;so the contrast of the two versions of this classic made my experience of the original all the richer.
I:8621;87;It was stunning gorgeous imagery (think the 2.
I:8621;88;disc special edition of Casablanca which came out last year).
I:8621;89;The hint throughout this beautifully plotted film is that Keyes is on to Walter's guilt right from the beginning.
I:8621;90;At the same time he subtly indicates to Walter that he has it all figured out.
I:8621;91;The screenplay and direction are first.
I:8621;92;rate and the story and plotline are tighter and more absorbing than the Cain novel.
I:8621;93;Without question, a top ten American movie classic.
I:8621;94;One of the best film noir movies you can see!
I:8621;95;It has all the classic elements to keep you on the edge of your seat.
I:8621;96;An absolute knockout film noir masterpiece.
I:8621;97;"The dialogue is brilliant (Raymond Chandler wrote it with dircetor Billy Wilder)
I:8621;98;And it's all done in dark and shadows, the perfect film noir atmosphere.
I:8621;99;Understandably many noir fans feel this movie is the best of its genre.
I:8621;100;it is definitely in my top 10, maybe top 5.
I:8621;101;no matter though, because it is a great movie, although I would have liked to see Dick Powell in this role instead of Fred McMurray.
I:8621;102;This is one of the greatest Black and White Movies that was made in the 40's.
I:8621;103;discussed genre of film, a uniquely American style of highly stylized thriller.
I:8621;104;If you love film noir or if you want to start watching some film noir films, this is the one.
I:8621;105;this is beautiful shot in black and white by the great Billy Wilder.
I:8621;106;fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck both give great performances in this film.
I:8621;107;Barbara is one of the best femme fatales in the history of cinema.
I:8621;108;The dialogue between MacMurray and Stanwyck is well written and very well spoken.
I:8621;109;The documentary included as a bonus feature on this double.
I:8621;110;wilder, working with cinematographer Joseph Seitz, also emphasizes the location, in this case, Los Angeles, more than Huston did, and casts darker shadows.
I:8621;111;MacMurray, in a rare dramatic role, is good, and perfectly cast since Stanwyck admits in the end that she never really loved him, but manipulated him to get what she wanted.
I:8621;112;It's brightly lit and is distinguished only by Billy Goldenberg's music score, itself routine for the era, but appropriately suspenseful.
I:8621;113;The script, which gives credit to Chandler and Wilder's original, is so faithful that it seems less rewritten than dusted off.
I:8621;114;Movie itself is well played and original classic.
I:8621;115;Great movie, one of the all.
I:8621;116;time best, must be seen by all humans on planet Earth, we all agree, okay.
I:8621;117;Pause and take a close look at this man, and then take a look at a picture of Raymond Chandler.
I:8621;118;so that astonishing revelation aside, this is just simply a fantastic movie, as fun and thrilling to watch the 121st time, in 2008, as it was the 1st time, in 1944.
I:8621;119;The acting by the three leads is superb, the direction and lighting are expressive to the point of Hitchcock, and the dialogue is, well, it makes you want to bust out crying that anybody was ever that good, and why can't anybody be that good today?
I:8621;120;This is one of the greatest movies ever made.
I:8621;121;This is one of Billy Wilder's best.
I:8621;122;He has many, but this is really the one.
I:8621;123;First off the movie arrived in a prompt manner, the packaging was easy to open and protected the movie.
I:8621;124;I enjoy this great murder mystery.
I:8621;125;This is the best film noir I have ever seen.
I:8621;126;the actors are wonderful, especially E. g. Robinson, who plays Neff's boss and close friend, Keyes.
I:8621;127;It's full of Billy Wilder's wonderful banter.
I:8621;128;My favorite part in the whole movie is when Neff first meets Phyllis.
I:8621;129;I wonder if you wonder.
I:8621;130;This is just one example of Wilder's genius, but I could name many more.
I:8621;131;This movie is just wonderful from begining to end, and I think everyone should see it!
I:8621;132;Stanwyk, McMurray and Robinson all turn in brilliant performances.
I:8621;133;This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat.
I:8621;134;A must see for all movie buffs who love a good story!!
I:8621;135;First off: I absolutely love this movie.
I:8621;136;There's so much to revel in .
I:8621;137;the film gels with clockwork precision, and the suspense is genuinely nailbiting.
I:8621;138;What contributes to its effectiveness is the casting against type of good guy MacMurray as a killer.
I:8621;139;Beyond a doubt, this is just about as deliciously dark that film noir can possibly get.
I:8621;140;ray edition of DOUBLE INDEMNITY from Universal is gorgeous .
I:8621;141;Clarity of the black and white image is exceptional, and the mono audio track is crystal clear.
I:8621;142;The bonus features include an intro by TCM host Robert Osborne, a documentary on the making of the movie, commentaries by historians Richard Schickel, Lem Dobbs and Nick Redman, the theatrical trailer, and the 1973 made for TV feature based on the original film.
I:8621;143;It's what film classics are all about.
I:8621;144;This is one of my favorites of hers.
I:8621;145;Barbara is riveting on the silver screen.
I:8621;146;The story is great too.
I:8621;147;Boy they knew how to make a suspense film back in the day.
I:8621;148;This was probably the best film I have seen this year.
I:8621;149;This is a very classic film noir that deserves all the accolades it has received.
I:8621;150;Fred MacMurray does an excellent job of his role and Edward G. Robinson is especially stellar.
I:8621;151;Barbara Stanwyck does an excellent job of the acting, although, I personally don't think she has the classic face of a femme fatale.
I:8621;152;The plot is complex and the plan intricate.
I:8621;153;It all makes for an intriguing and intresting film.
I:8621;154;This classic stands up superbly and remains one of the first and best of the Hollywood films noirs.
I:8621;155;crossing still packs a wallop.
I:8621;156;The witty dialogue is top calibre.
I:8621;157;Up till this film MacMurray had played heroes and light comedy.
I:8621;158;macMurray personna makes it all the more chilling and here Stanwyck matches him with intensity.
I:8621;159;in this film Robinson delivers one of those great solo routines in the office with boss Richard Gaines( Mr. Norton) along with Neff and Dietrichson) .
I:8621;160;This is an excellent film.
I:8621;161;Stanwyck is an extraordinary actress who has the ability to convey the sex appeal, power, and vulnerability of the femme fatale who sets this murder plot in motion.
I:8621;162;Robinson is also truly great at making the honest claims adjuster utterly convincing.
I:8621;163;His relationship with MacMurray is, ironically enough, the real love story of the movie.
I:8621;164;Fred MacMurray does a good job, but unlike Robinson and Stanwyck, he can't breath enough life into this role to make it utterly convincing.
I:8621;165;This film is a classic for good reason.
I:8621;166;Not only is the acting superb, but the movie is proof that Billy Wilder can do a great variety of genres, noir, comedy, drama.
I:8621;167;I love terse, suspenseful scripts, and this story doesn't have a wasted moment.
I:8621;168;This masterpiece of casting , writing and directing(imho),is a 5 star noir special.
I:8621;169;This is one of the best.
I:8621;170;liked classic films of all time and I am among that large group of fans as well.
I:8621;171;Now, the film finally looks great.
I:8621;172;few movies have ever had dialog this entertaining.
I:8621;173;This is one of the rare times when the movie was far better than the book.
I:8621;174;Stanwyck, MacMurray and Edward G. Robinson, are what make this so good.
I:8621;175;The latter is almost mesmerizing in his performance, the way he delivers his lines.
I:8621;176;He can even make a speech about something as boring as insurance and still keep you riveted to the screen.
I:8621;177;stanwyck was no sex symbol (at least to me) but she looked great here in the most seductive of 1940s clothing and, like Robinson, has a distinctive voice and accent that keeps your attention.
I:8621;178;told mostly in flashback the film holds your attention throughout with its crackling dialogue, impeccable acting from the principals and a plot full of suspense.
I:8621;179;This was the film that first brought director Billy Wilder to my attention and I made a point not to miss any of his future films .
I:8621;180;He gave a powerful performance and I was surprised that he never even received an Oscar nomination for his work in this film.
I:8621;181;Edward G. Robinson as the insurance investigator Barton Keyes was absolutely brilliant and dominated every scene he was in.
I:8621;182;Barbara Stanwyck as Phyllis Dietrichson was breathtaking and this was without doubt one of her best roles ever.
I:8621;183;Double Indemnity had a particularly strong supporting cast including Porter Hall, Richard Gaines, Tom Powers, Jean Heather, Byron Barr and Fortunio Bonanova.
I:8621;184;"some favourite lines from the film:Fred MacMurray: ""Walter Neff."
I:8621;185;"we're sunk and we'll have to pay through the nose, and you know it!"""
I:8621;186;If you haven't seen the original you are in for a treat and if you have seen it then you know this is a film worth many repeat viewings.
I:8621;187;"a real ""film noir"" classic."
I:8621;188;Double indemnity is a Film Noir classic.
I:8621;189;Director Billy Wilder gives the film the classic Noir look, with dark shadows and a twisted murder plot.
I:8621;190;Neff an insurance salesman is coaxed into a murder/fraud scheme by a beautiful woman.
I:8621;191;Stanwyck's performance is superb, she plays a cold.
I:8621;192;blooded woman with a mindset of taking what she believes belongs to her.
I:8621;193;Dietrichson is nonchalant, and methodical when it comes to her femme fatale characteristics.
I:8621;194;Jean Heather playing Lola does an excellent job of selling her character as an innocent and meek teenager wary of her stepmother's actions.
I:8621;195;this was a great film going to great lengths to please the viewer.
I:8621;196;This Film not only leans towards the serious side but also has some comic relief mainly in the use of the word baby, and the endless search for one mans matches.
I:8621;197;A great work of art Double Indemnity should be on everyone's list of movies to see soon.
I:8621;198;It will not only keep you wrapped up but also will keep you on the edge of your seat waiting for the next plot twist.
I:8621;199;Finally a first class transfer of this great Billy Wilder classic.
I:8621;200;This was definitely money well spent.
I:8621;201;Very few movies have captured such intense suspense and drama highlighted by a clever scheme of murder that is in turn countered with brilliant detective work.
I:8621;202;Not only is this one of the greatest noir movies, it's one of the greatest movies of any genre.
I:8621;203;Great casting of Fred MacMurray against type as the eventual bad guy.
I:8621;204;Barbara Stanwyck is great as the fiery ice goddess that makes Fred MacMurray give his life up.
I:8621;205;Edward G. Robinson is great as the dogged insurance investigator that works with Fred MacMurray.
I:8621;206;The plot is tightly wound with moments of reral thrills.
I:8621;207;features except for the scene access (Thank you very much !)
I:8621;208;It doesn't matter, I will keep it my library until the day Criterion will release a special edition of DOUBLE INDEMNITY.
I:8621;209;let's back to this movie whose glorious fathers are James Cain, Raymond Chandler and Billy Wilder.
I:8621;210;Witty dialogs and Edward G. Robinson, one of Hollywood giants.
I:8621;211;One of my favourite classics!
I:8621;212;Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray give great performances of a bad girl and the guy she pulls into her web of evil.
I:8621;213;The photography, the sharp dialogue, the tense direction, and the fine acting all lead to a very satisfying film.
I:8621;214;The scenes between MacMurray and Edward G. Robinson, as the insurance investigator who closes in on MacMurray and Stanwyck, are the highlights of this excellent film.
I:8621;215;Excellent example of Film Noir with three outstanding actors at their best.
I:8621;216;Plot twists keep your head spinning throughout but worth seeing again just for the acting and dialog.
I:8621;217;If you love old movies, this is one of the best.
I:8621;218;How wise of him to take a smaller role and make the film even better.
I:8621;219;I love black and white movies and this one an all.
I:8621;220;Great screenplay and Billy Wilder's direction superb.
I:8621;221;And when he says he'll help her kill her husband youknow you are in for a treat.
I:8621;222;"Stanwyck and McMurrayaare great together and Edward G. Robinson is great as Keyes,the insurance inspector whose ""little man"" inside tells him howto spot a phony claim."
I:8621;223;This is a terrific movie, beautifully directed by Billy Wilder, one of his better films, and he made some very good ones.
I:8621;224;"Note the range: a psychological mystery, a prisoners of war movie, a comedy with song and dance, and a ""sophisticated"" comedy."
I:8621;225;He had a knack for getting the best out of the players and he never forgot his audience.
I:8621;226;"hearted fare, e. g., The Shaggy Dog (1959)
I:8621;227;Barbara Stanwyck, whose career spanned six decades, was also excellent as the sociopathic Phyllis Dietrickson.
I:8621;228;Edward G. Robinson, who practically defined the Hollywood gangster from the thirties and forties, switches type and does an outstanding job as Barton Keyes, a sleuthful insurance claims manager.
I:8621;229;At any rate that's the way Wilder played it, and it worked big time.
I:8621;230;In fact the movie is significantly better than the novel, which isn't usually the case.
I:8621;231;"one of the things I was thinking while watching this was that it was actually as ""perfect"" a murder scheme as you'll see on the silver screen, although everything had to go just right."
I:8621;232;time best film noir and a jewel in the crown of Billy Wilder, one of filmland's greatest directors.
I:8621;233;I believe it is, perhaps, the finest of the genre, Film Noir, which was not something planned or thought up, by those guys in Hollywood.
I:8621;234;It kind of evolved, from many,many, factors, one being the time period of pre.
I:8621;235;Double Indemnity stars Hollywood's finest actress, Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray.
I:8621;236;Mr. MacMurray is a pleasant surprise for this genre, as I could never have pictured him, in a film noir type movie.
I:8621;237;He shines and is finally out of that gangster role, he played so well.
I:8621;238;This movie is one that I can certainly watch at least, once a week and never tire of it.
I:8621;239;screenwriter Billy Wilder's flair with suspense and black humor works so perfectly with James M. Cain's novel about adulterous lovers plotting to murder the woman's husband and scam the man's insurance company, it even improves on the book.
I:8621;240;Back then, he was best known to my generation as a Disney movie star and the lovable dad of TV's MY THREE SONS, so it was quite a revelation to me when I saw him playing underhanded types in DI, THE APARTMENT, and THE CAINE MUTINY.
I:8621;241;MacMurray had more range than he got credit for!)
I:8621;242;stealing Robinson, though the Academy was smart enough not to overlook the mesmerizing Stanwyck.
I:8621;243;"DI boasts plenty of wonderful character bits, too
I:8621;244;Among other things, we learn about the censorship issues in bringing Cain's juicy, lurid tales to the big screen.
I:8621;245;the original film and cool featurettes and other extras are on Disc 1.
I:8621;246;Still, both versions are worth a look for completists, like me!
I:8621;247;Because, underneath all the deceits, betrayals and ironies lies a lighted match and one of the odder and more touching father.

I:8621;249;It's very impressive and very much appreciated).
I:8621;250;What a perfect way for Universal to introduce us digital snobs to the 100's of gems we've never seen just becuase they're black and white or were filmed in 35mm celluloid.
I:8621;251;It's a great way to give up digital nerds a lesson in prior greatness.
I:8621;252;Just please don't take away one of the best marketing campaigns we're seen anywhere over the last 5 years.
I:8621;253;"DOUBLE INDEMNITY, a 1944 film by Billy Wilder, is one of the most definitive and beautiful examples of early film noir (literally, ""black film"") at its best."
I:8621;254;For those of you unfamiliar with the genre of film noir, this was a type of film made popular in the 1940s and 1950s, features very dark cinematography (plenty of shadows intermixed with light), as well as equally dark subject matter.
I:8621;255;Common themes are murders, affairs and grizzly illegal activity.
I:8621;256;DOUBLE INDEMNITY is a great example of this style at its best.
I:8621;257;fred MacMurray plays wily insurance man Walter Neff, who finds himself drawn to a beautiful, married woman, Phyllis Dietrichsen, played by the lovely Barbara Stanwyck.
I:8621;258;this film is beautifully acted, directed with great zest, and very, very engaging.
I:8621;259;Even though some of the dialogue is (delightfully) dated, you are still going to have a great time watching DOUBLE INDEMNITY.
I:8621;260;There is no question that this is an example of filmmaking, at its best.
I:8621;261;Wonderful film in all ways.
I:8621;262;To me that is worth the price of admission.:+)
I:8621;263;It's still a tense and enthralling film noir masterpiece.
I:8621;264;Extremely shoddy treatment of such a wonderful film.
I:8621;265;I'd like to see a special edition of this film produced as soon as possible, and done right!
I:8621;266;"Double Indemnity is one of 5 films that helped launch the ""film noir"" genre."
I:8621;267;"I din't get the money, or the girl"" This is as good as it gets to explain what ""film noir"" is all about."
I:8621;268;Many people think this film was MacMurray's finest performance.
I:8621;269;"She won 3 Emmys (""The Barbara Stanwyck Show"", ""Big Valley"")."
I:8621;270;Robinson does a good job as the Insurance inspector, but it's hardly among his best performances.
I:8621;271;"Along the way he was nominated as Best Director 8 times and for Best Writer 12 times, and he won for Best Picture (""The Apartment"")."
I:8621;272;Double Indemnity is true film noir.
I:8621;273;By today's standards it's a little slow, but it has all the noir elements and its true value is historical .
I:8621;274;one of the earliest and truest examples of the genre.
I:8621;275;filled, plausible plot, and expertly acted.
I:8621;276;Fred MacMurray is handsome, cool and plays the gullible insurance salesman.
I:8621;277;Barbara Stanwyck is cunning, alluring, beautiful, whose performance as the seductress is perhaps one of her best roles.
I:8621;278;Walter Neff is a sharp, quick witted, slick insurance salesman who finds himself consumed with thoughts of Phyllis Dietrichson played by Barbara Stanwyck.
I:8621;279;It was a good story that was fun to watch and I really enjoyed it.
I:8621;280;i liked this movie and and would suggest it to anyone into noir films.
I:8621;281;The original picture is as crisp and sharp as the day it was made, the sound is just as good.
I:8621;282;It is a fine story, and this is one movie that one can watch over and over again.
I:8621;283;I have, and it's great each time.
I:8621;284;Billy Wilder gives it the pace and rhythm of a comedy, but it's a thrillingly entertaining trip to Hell.
I:8621;285;He embodies Neff's horny shallowness perfectly.
I:8621;286;there are two commentary tracks here and one has some interesting first.
I:8621;287;good to have your service available for us here in Australiathe old movies have spunk and a story line too
I:8621;288;smart dialogue provided by master film auteur Billy Wilder and supreme crime novelist Raymond Chandler is what makes this 1944 film noir such a timeless classic, certainly among the very best of the genre.
I:8621;289;The man isn't home but his lethally cool wife Phyllis is, and the sexual combustion between them is palpable from the moment they meet.
I:8621;290;it certainly helps that Wilder cast three actors who turn in exemplary performances.
I:8621;291;"It's easily his best screen work at least until Wilder cast him as the immoral, adulterous office boss in another classic, ""The Apartment"", sixteen years later."
I:8621;292;boiled dame with a brilliant turn as Phyllis.
I:8621;293;She is the role model for all femme fatales that came after her .
I:8621;294;But there is no love between these two .
I:8621;295;She's just a conquest to him, and he's a pawn to her.
I:8621;296;As the most decent person of an unseemly lot, Edward G. Robinson portrays Barton Keyes, a wily insurance investigator who likes Walter in spite of himself and the revelations about him.
I:8621;297;It all ends the way you would expect but in such a darkly humorous way that it's enjoyable just to see how.
I:8621;298;Double Indemnity is a film noir masterpiece .
I:8621;299;chilling, dark, and very suspenseful.
I:8621;300;It features a great script with many memorable lines (for instance .
I:8621;301;, an interesting plot with many good twists, and fantastic performances from two classic stars (especially Stanwyck, who won an Oscar for her portrayal of the evil wife).
I:8621;302;brilliant insurance salesman, Walter Neff(Fred MacMurray), who falls for a beautiful married woman (Barbara Stanwyck) who wants to use him to get rid of her husband for the insurance money (hence the title, Double Indemnity).
I:8621;303;double Indemnity is a great film .
I:8621;304;the idea behind it, interesting in itself, was brilliantly executed by the legendary director Billy Wilder.
I:8621;305;Consequently, Indemnity is a true film noir classic and must.
I:8621;306;This movie has an exceptionally good plot .
I:8621;307;lots of twists and turns.
I:8621;308;Also enjoyed seeing how Los Angeles looked in the late 1940s.
I:8621;309;The newer version included was interesting and not so great.
I:8621;310;This movie confirms that Barbara Stanwyk was one of the most talented actresses of her generation.
I:8621;311;The character of Phyllis Dietrichson is always fully developed, believable, likeable and detestable.
I:8621;312;Along with the rest of the talented cast, Stanwyk brings this intense story to life.
I:8621;313;The script is taught and well developed, the cinematography is great and the music is perfect.
I:8621;314;Clearly and without a doubt, the finest example of film noir.
I:8621;315;"Fred MacMurray, the beloved dad in ""My Three Sons"" made a powerful impression on me when he took on the role of ""Walter Neff"", the insurance salesman with a pronounced dark side."
I:8621;316;Combine that with the enormous talent of Edward G. Robinson as the sharp, intuitive investigator who we wonder if whether or not he knew of the murderous scheme.
I:8621;317;Double Indemnity is an excellent example of American film noir.
I:8621;318;The stars (especially Barbara Stanwyck, Fred Macmurray) are great in their roles.
I:8621;319;The last scenes of the movie are poignant and extremely well written and acted.
I:8621;320;The script is one of the best, too.
I:8621;321;Billy Wilder did a great job directing the film.
I:8621;322;This item arrived really soon after ordering, and I love it.
I:8621;323;Double Indemnity is a classic film noir involving an insurance salesman, an eager.
I:8621;324;Fred MacMurray is Walter Neff, a successful insurance man who falls hard for the icey Phyllis Dietrichson, played wonderfully by Barbara Stanwyck.
I:8621;325;Their eventual union gives birth to an intricate plot to kill Mr. Dietrichson and collect the insurance money.
I:8621;326;Walter Neff, however, is intelligent and confident.
I:8621;327;"Raymond Chandler, who wrote another film noir ""The Big Sleep,"" adapted the James M. Cain novel, adding dialogue that was both shocking and funny
I:8621;328;And the great Billy Wilder here early in his career has created an essential American Film.
I:8621;329;screen, the characters kiss very, very passionately to make up for it!
I:8621;330;If the Maltese Falcon was the first great film.
I:8621;331;noir then this film has to be a refining and improvement of the genre.
I:8621;332;Billy Wilder put together a crime film that is still intriguing today with its femme fatale and other techniques in storytelling and cinematography.
I:8621;333;Starring Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck, and Edward G. Robinson, this is a classic film.
I:8621;334;This movie was definitely full of suspense as well as great characters.
I:8621;335;Director Wilder utilizes the voice over with flashback very effectively to tell the story.
I:8621;336;If there is a better made movie of this genre I would love to see it.
I:8621;337;This one is juicy and taut and fires on all cylinders.
I:8621;338;Enjoy a masterpiece of the classic era!
I:8621;339;This is an excellent film with an excellent screenplay, great acting and exquisite play with lighting to tell a story.
I:8621;340;Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck and Edward G. Robinson are perfectly cast in their roles and you only realise this when you compare the film to the tv remake on disc two to see the big difference.
I:8621;341;this movie is a true classic and holds up very well to repeated viewing.
I:8621;342;Author James M. Cain virtually created a new genre with his extra.
I:8621;343;and they were so successful with the public that not even 1940s Hollywood could resist.
I:8621;344;possibly due to the story's truly psychotic edge, which is given full life by Barbara Stanwyck in one of her most celebrated performances.
I:8621;345;but MacMurray's performance is exceptionally good here, and all the more effective because it so completely unexpected.
I:8621;346;Stanwyck is truly memorable here, and gives us a woman who seems at once sexed.
I:8621;347;up and completely frigid, at once completely natural and absolutely artificial.
I:8621;348;It is a remarkable and often disturbing effect.
I:8621;349;beat performances that drive the action.
I:8621;350;this was one of director Billy Wilder's first major hits, and he deserves considerable credit for making the weird elements of the story work as a whole, keeping the film smartly paced, and heaping it up with atmosphere.
I:8621;351;The film noir genre is full of elements that comedians love to pantomime: The way characters seem to stop whatever they are doing to reveal their private thoughts to the audience.
I:8621;352;Some had truly frightful moments and heightened drama.
I:8621;353;ups, and eventual treachery is well.
I:8621;354;Enjoy the suspense and especially the cutting dialogue.
I:8621;355;Great storey , weill cast with seasoned professional actors.
I:8621;356;be slick insurance salesman Fred MacMurray.
I:8621;357;Must see if you like crime or caper movies!
I:8621;358;I remember this from long ago and that I liked it alot.
I:8621;359;So I got it after 30 years and it still holds up as a great plot and unexpected things that I forgot.
I:8621;360;If you look up the definition of Film Noir anywhere, this movie is what you will be directed to watch.
I:8621;361;If you saw and enjoyed the movie Body Heat , Kathleen Turner and William Hurt.
I:8621;362;Yes, this is one suspenseful film, but most of the suspense is found waiting for the absolutely awful story line to unravel.
I:8621;363;which is good, because it seems he's the only good guy in the film.Yet, if you're one of those people like me, familiar enough with Los Angeles to recognize it in movies, and you watch older movies to see what's going on in the background, and where it might have been shot, then you'll like this one.
I:8621;364;Double Indemnity is a classic movie, a giant in film noir.
I:8621;365;The rating here is for the original.
I:8621;366;the two versions are nearly identical, so much so it's a wonder that a writing credit was given for the newer version.
I:8621;367;fred MacMurray is Walter Neff, an insurance salesman.
I:8621;368;He pays the Dietrichson household a visit to update some automobile insurance.
I:8621;369;Phylis, quite simply, is a black widow, she wants to do away with her husband.
I:8621;370;Neff goes along with it and knows a way to get a double payment, the double indemnity clause.
I:8621;371;It's a very tense movie that deserves to be watched more than once.
I:8621;372;If you can get the original without the tv version you'll probably be more satisfied.
I:8621;373;Despite its genre roots and Fred MacMurray's stiffness, DOUBLE INDEMNITY is still one of the greatest films from the 40s as well as an exemplary noir.
I:8621;374;The film is a sly, incisive indictment of rampant capitalism and the title, an insurance.
I:8621;375;Babara Stanwyck plays her black widow role with slimy gusto and sex appeal (Wannabe Sharon Stone should take a lesson or two).
I:8621;376;Love it and have for years,worthy of a five star rating and what a cast with Fred MacMurray,Eddie Robinson and Barbara Stanwyck.
I:8621;377;Under the direction of Billy Wilder the film has great twist and turns and plenty of stars to go around with great performances by this superb cast.
I:8621;378;com and well worth the price.
I:8621;379;This work may be well considered as the masterpiece of Biily Wilder .
I:8621;380;The fate intersections and the soul darkness emerge to prevail on your behavior .
I:8621;381;famous adaptation of James Cain 's novel and screenplay of Raymond Chandler .
I:8621;382;Add besides the Edward G Robinson and Barbara Stanwick presence and you will obtain a classic sample of one of the top films of the forties .
I:8621;383;One of the greatest films of all time starring my favorite actress, the original Barbara, and Fred mcMurray ( who knew) .
I:8621;384;love everything she did especially the sexual role reversal of It happened one night.
I:8621;385;Take, for instance, the delicious exchange of double.
I:8621;386;Needles to say, it is a dream, fiction, and a masochistic dream at that, because he dreams about being exploited by a woman.
I:8621;387;This is sublime piece of cinema .
I:8621;388;perhaps one of the best Hollywood has ever created.
I:8621;389;Double Indemnity is a GREAT movie!
I:8621;390;Having been so impressed with other restorations in the series, I trusted and bought this edition.
I:8621;391;I always appreciate smart dialogue, and this film is full of it courtesy of Billy Wilder and Raymond Chandler.
I:8621;392;The exchanges between Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray are classic.
I:8621;393;But the script is also well constructed, using an effective shift between present and past as well as MacMurray's voice over to move the winding plot along.
I:8621;394;Stanwyck, such a versatile actress, easily gives one of her best performances as Phyllis, the woman who lures an insurance salesman into a scheme of murder and greed.
I:8621;395;As the salesman Walter, MacMurray is surprisingly good in a role unlike the usual likeable guy he played.
I:8621;396;He should have played more shady characters in his film career.
I:8621;397;Edward G. Robinson delivers a fun performance as MacMurray's friend and insurance claim inspector.
I:8621;398;Billy Wilder's intelligent direction uses all of the elements of film noir and puts them together in one of the best examples of the genre.
I:8621;399;Phyllis and Walter may not be the most likeable people, but it is fascinating to watch them lead each other into trouble.
I:8621;400;Fans of classic films, film noir, the director, or any of the actors should make sure to add this film to their viewing list.
I:8621;401;The plot moves along with the same tension that readers' found in Raymond Chandler's novels, and that's saying a lot!Barbara Stanwick is sexy and manipulative, all the while seeming somehow clean and innocent.
I:8621;402;The duplicity is frightening to behold.
I:8621;403;edward G. Robinson is a claims investagator, and his performance is top.
I:8621;404;it's one of the top films of all time, and the actors are all brilliant.
I:8621;405;This is a classsic,tried and true!!!
I:8621;406;Absolute classic film noir brilliantly acted and directed!!!
I:8621;407;Includes the classic film,wondefully restored,a nice documentary,two audio commentaries,a trailer,and the 1973 remake!!!
I:8621;408;The first disc is worth the entire price anyways.
I:8621;409;This is movie is an excellent retelling of a wonderfully written novel, rich with literary elements and meaning.
I:8621;410;Plus, it's interesting, for those who think all black and white movies are boring.
I:8621;411;not your average crime story, this movie takes you from the perspective of the murderers, an insurance salesman played by Fred MacMurray and rich tycoon's wife played flawlessly by Barbara Stanwyck (who actually got an Oscar nomination for this role).
I:8621;412;"Now it may be dangerous to take a story from the perspective of two people who you can never like
I:8621;413;The murderous characters are also contrasted by Edward Robinson's character, a small role that lights up the movie.
I:8621;414;notch acting, and a well.
I:8621;415;Did I mention that the grand master Raymond Chandler is one of the screenwriters.
I:8621;416;Wilder is a master of light and shadow and deserves the very best restoration.
I:8621;417;There are many fine Wilder films available (his director's filmography includes Some Like It Hot , The Apartment , Sunset Boulevard , a. m. o.) and this ranks at the top of his artistic achievement.
I:8621;418;Billy Wilder's film, Double Indemnity is a masterpiece filled with devious schemes, lustfuldesires and financial gain.
I:8621;419;He believes that Phyllis is his wayto fulfill that urge.
I:8621;420;An exciting relationship develops between these characters as theybegin creating a devious plan for the murder Mr. Dietrichson, which would includecollecting double indemnity off his accidental death insurance policy.
I:8621;421;Simply the greatest film, in my opinion ever made.
I:8621;422;Nothing can compare to this perfectly constructed film.
I:8621;423;Every shot, angle and every piece of dialogue is so carefully mastered.
I:8621;424;The performance from Barbara Stanwyck (as well as all overs) is fantastic.
I:8621;425;How brilliant that twisted look in her eyes when.
I:8621;426;This film is so perfect, and the music just sweeps the film along, as well as the viewer, and you progress through the often nightmarish world of the main caracter.
I:8621;427;The suspense lies in finding out how.
I:8621;428;the device of using the dictaphone is a clever idea to keep the film rushing along and on track.
I:8621;429;This improved on the book version where Walter makes a written confession.
I:8621;430;Neff's sharing his story with us also adds to the general tension.
I:8621;431;He's getting closer and closer though.
I:8621;432;And Walter is always on hand to provide the lit match.
I:8621;433;As Keyes lights up, the solution is right there under his very nose.
I:8621;434;I know there is and has been a lot of hype about this movie and it is good film noir but certainly not the best I've ever seen.
I:8621;435;This film just has to have B&W and this is beautifully filmed with great lights and shadows.
I:8621;436;Beautiful enough but she can't act her way out of a wet paper bag.
I:8621;437;Barbara Stanwyck was perfect in this role and I don't even particularly care for Barbara Stanwyck.
I:8621;438;This is not one of my favorite B&W movies but it is very well done and holds up well.
I:8621;439;Edward G. Robinson is wonderful.
I:8621;440;The grand daddy of them all.
I:8621;441;If you can get over the (intentionally) cheap wig worn by Barbara Stanwyck, there is no disputing this is one of the best of the Film Noir genre.
I:8621;442;This is one of the very best of the Film Noir movies of the 40s.
I:8621;443;Edward G. Robinson steals the show each time he is on screen.
I:8621;444;The Blu Ray disc looks marvelous.
I:8621;445;Great bonus features compliment this great movie.
I:8621;446;Amazon you must do better with your product descriptions!
I:8621;447;Now the transfer is OK at best lots of issues and I am sure there will be a great transfer made at some point but this isn't it.
I:8621;448;This movie is easy to recommend.
I:8621;449;It's a near perfect film: cinematography, dialogue, stellar performances.
I:8621;450;Must confess, I didn't care for the first 5 minutes too much but this movie is among the best, if the not the best of this genre.
I:8621;451;An easy movie to watch again and again .
I:8621;452;and, very quotable dialogue as you can see from all the reviewers here.
I:8621;453;The supplemental materials, described here by others, is just so.
I:8621;454;A few films have been marked as a classic and this is one of them.
I:8621;455;Twists and turns and a film that tells you a story without explosions.
I:8621;456;"One of the quintessential noir films, Billy Wilder's ""Double Indemnity"" is a masterpiece of stark atmosphere and carefully stylized suspense."
I:8621;457;boiled repartee and the great Edward G. Robinson is aces as always as the dogged investigator hot on the lovers' trail.
I:8621;458;"Sinister, tense, and cynical, Wilder's ""Indemnity"" is riveting film suspense."
I:8621;459;is an excellent, professional actress.
I:8621;460;I like her more with every movie I see and she made a lot.
I:8621;461;In the hands of director Billy Wilder, this novel by Raymond Chandler is a masterpiece.
I:8621;462;The moment you see that lovely ankle of Phyllis, (Stanwyk) on the staircase, you know she's trouble.
I:8621;463;Fred McMurray is taking a holiday from comedy to play oily insurance salesman, Walter.
I:8621;464;They are also very interesting, including Edward G. Robinson as Keyes, the obsessive insurance investigator and colleague of Walter.
I:8621;465;It must look like an accident and their plan is a good one though complicated.
I:8621;466;If not, it is still a superior thriller.
I:8621;467;Without a doubt one of the best of its genre, this movie still holds up after all of this time.
I:8621;468;MacMurray, Edward G. Robinson and Barbara Stanwyck are all sensational.
I:8621;469;Director Billy Wilder may be better known for other movies (Some Like it Hot, Sunset Boulevard) but this one still packs his best punch.
I:8621;470;This is one of the best films I have ever seen.
I:8621;471;This is noir at its very best.
I:8621;472;Sunset Boulevard comes out on blu ray next week and is also a classic.
I:8621;473;The blu ray looks terrific, although you need a region free player to view it since it is locked to region B (Europe).
I:8621;474;Simply put, this is one of the finest films noir ever produced and clearly Fred MacMurray's finest hour.
I:8621;475;Stanwyck's great, too, as is Edward G. Robinson, but the bottom line is the film itself, the story it tells, and the suspenseful web it casts.
I:8621;476;I've watched this one many times and will watch it many times again.
I:8621;477;Director Billy Wilder (Sunset Boulevard) along with writer Raymond Chandler (The Long Goodbye) brings Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck, and Edward G. Robinson into a great film noir.
I:8621;478;Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) is a successful insurance salesman.
I:8621;479;This wonderful plot in Double Indemnity has many twists and turns in it.
I:8621;480;They have to time everything just right and this keeps you on the edge of your seat.
I:8621;481;There are so many moments in the film where you think the whole scheme is about to collapse.
I:8621;482;Neff and Dietrichson are such witty characters that they seem to have the right thing to say or do at the right time.
I:8621;483;Neff is even surprised how good the plan is working out.
I:8621;484;I highly recommend this movie for people of all ages.
I:8621;485;The film really kept me on the edge of my seat the entire second half.
I:8621;486;I believe the true test of any film is to be able to watch it time after time after time and still enjoy it, which I have done.
I:8621;487;I love the feel of this film, particularly the shots in the insurance office where one gets to see a workplace as it appeared 70 years ago, the bowling alley, etc.
I:8621;488;He is probably my favorite actor and he is at his best here, takng a back seat to MacMurray and Stanwyck billing.
I:8621;489;wise and stealing just about every scene he appears in.
I:8621;490;would you hide in the back seat of a car and subsequently strangle (!)
I:8621;491;It's a legendary film, it holds a spot on The American Film Institute's Top 100 (#38) and has inspired countless other movies (i. e., 'Body Heat').
I:8621;492;For a movie that was released in 1944, it still works perfectly and hasn't dated a bit (except for little things like the Dictaphone and the fact that the main character walks through supermarkets smoking).
I:8621;493;He arrives at her house to see her husband, so that he can renew his auto insurance.
I:8621;494;The movie kicks into first gear when Phyllis asks Neff about insurance.
I:8621;495;So, Neff and Phyllis come up with a great plan.
I:8621;496;Some classic Billy Wilder movies (Some Like It Hot, Sunset Boulevard, etc.) end with a great line of dialogue.
I:8621;497;Double Indemnity ends with a great line (although it's the simplicity that makes it great) and a great action.
I:8621;498;This is a great movie, a great film.
I:8621;499;noir, a Billy Wilder triumph.
I:8621;500;Double Indemnity is considered to be the quintessential film noir.
I:8621;501;Every aspect of this film is pure movie perfection.
I:8621;502;a blonde Barbara Stanwyck is absolutely seductive as the impeccable femme fatale Phyllis Dietrichson who lures the naive insurance man Walter Neff (played amazingly by a cast.
I:8621;503;Billy Wilder's classic touches are present throughout making the film all the more enjoyable to watch.
I:8621;504;with a script so biting, so fierce that it should be the basis for all aspiring screenwriters, Double Indemnity packs quite a wallop.
I:8621;505;"A masterpiece of film noir, Billy Wilder's Double Indemnity is a wonderful picture, with the original ""touch"" of its author all around."
I:8621;506;Brilliant movie with brilliant actors and actresses!
I:8621;507;"It's the best crime mystery film I ever saw
I:8621;508;This is a fantastic movie.
I:8621;509;the most intriguing part of Double Indemnity was the way that it gently toyed with the audience by giving them a satisfying but original non.
I:8621;510;There is no happy ending for anyone.
I:8621;511;This was a good old movie.
I:8621;512;This is the best movie, the movie has everything murder, twists, great acting.

I:8621;515;"the film is a textbook case of successfully casting a star ""against type""."
I:8621;516;edward G. Robinson, in a supporting role, is absolutely superb as Barton Keyes.
I:8621;517;"he had always received top billing since ""Little Caesar"" made in the 30's, should have received an Oscar for his portrayal as the dogged claims investigator."

I:8621;519;acted and highly enjoyable noir thiller directed by Welles, but seemingly panned by most critics.
I:8621;520;Other remarkable touches are abound in this cinematically rich film.
I:8621;521;the snappy dialogue, courtesy of Raymond Chandler, who collaborated with Wilder on the script (the two actually hated each other) based on the James Cain novel, is an improvement on the book as is the story told in flashback by the dying protagonist helps amplify the personal relationship between Keyes and Neff to the film's advantage.

I:8621;526;That's perfectly fine with me, being a Queens man myself, but I think they should have just made her character from New York instead of California b/c it wasn't essential to the plot anyway.
I:8621;527;A true classic noir, fully deserving it's reputation.
I:8621;528;All the actors give their best performances.
I:8621;529;The dialog is all memorable, and quickly but subtly sets the mood.
I:8621;530;The special features are the best.
I:8621;531;She deserved a better wig!!!
I:8621;532;Boy, this movie was full of deceit.
I:8621;533;It was a good one.
I:8621;534;It crackles with Raymond Chandler's sharp wit (he's the other screen writer) as well as Billy Wilder's, well, sharp wit, and that masterful knack Wilder had for a perfectly polished script.
I:8621;535;This one's just a suspenseful ride from beginning to end.
I:8621;536;And unlike most noir films, it actually makes sense!
I:8621;537;One of the greatest movies ever made.
I:8621;538;The obvious reason is Billy Wilder, the genius of film noir '40's.
I:8621;539;this movie is great because it sizzles in a manner respecting the impediments of censorship of the first half of the twentieth century.
I:8621;540;But here the relentlessness of insurance investigator Barton Keyes, the sexuality of Phyllis and Walter, the mean spiritedness and hidden agenda of Phyllis, is all understated in the tradition of the '40's and '50's.
I:8621;541;Double Indemnity was the 1944 film noir classic from director Billy Wilder that finally explained how insurance worked to millions of Americans.

I:8621;543;Neff is a smooth talking insurance salesman who more than meets his match in the seductive Mrs. Dietrichson.
I:8621;544;But the course of true love never goes smoothly, especially when you throw murder into the mix.
I:8621;545;They're stuck with each other and they've got to ride all the way to the end of the line and it's a one.
I:8621;546;It sounds crazy, Keyes, but it's true, so help me.
I:8621;547;The story is well crafted as is the scheme to commit the murder.
I:8621;548;Everything goes well until fate weaves a mysterious path of intervention.
I:8621;549;black and white aids to create the noir shadows and the best noir film ever from Billy Wilder.
I:8621;550;the film is set in a California city and really matters little against the moment to moment drama of this great film.
I:8621;551;boiled dialogue, Stanwyck's, MacMurray's and Robinson's acting, Billy Wilder's direction, and everything else meshes together beautifully.
I:8621;552;Pulp writer James M. Cain also deserves a special mention for writing the book the movie is based on.
I:8621;553;This movie has received considerable praise by most all movie critics.
I:8621;554;This is an all time great entertainment.
I:8621;555;Theirs is a sadomasochistic love, filled with passionate embraces and rude retorts.
I:8621;556;I adore film noir movies, and this one is definitely a classic.
I:8621;557;Phyllis Dietrichson is a beautiful blonde dame who talks insurance agent Walter Neff into helping her murder her husband.
I:8621;558;And then there are twists and turns, emotions and intrigues, as the house of cards tumbles around them all.
I:8621;559;the dialogue is amazingly fast and snappy.
I:8621;560;The filming is gorgeous, with the costumes bringing the scenes to life.
I:8621;561;This ties everything together in a neat package.
I:8621;562;this movie is over 50 years old now and it still is just as powerful as when it was filmed.
I:8621;563;We loved watching it, and I highly recommend it.
I:8621;564;this has always been one of my favorites of the NOIR genre.
I:8621;565;barbara Stanwyck at her best .
I:8621;566;They carry it off, and it looks like all will go well .
I:8621;567;Edward G. Robinson steals this movie as he usually does.
I:8621;568;and did I mention great acting!Love this film .
I:8621;569;one of Billy Wilder's greatest movies (in my opinion).
I:8621;570;One of the best film noir movies there is.
I:8621;571;Fred Macmurray said it was his favorite movie he did.
I:8621;572;Stanwyck is stunning as usual.
I:8621;573;If your a fan of film nior, this is a must see.
I:8621;574;is a good item to get if you like all the movies a have fum and enjoy your self etc.
I:8621;575;Few film noirs from the 40's are as somber and dark in tone as this classic adaptation of the James M. cain novel written for the screen by Billy Wilder and Raymond Chandler.
I:8621;576;One look at her sexy ankle chain and he's hooked.
I:8621;577;She's murdered before and she's a tramp to boot.
I:8621;578;The performances in Double Indemnity are so natural that it seems almost contemporary.
I:8621;579;Robinson is superb as Keyes.
I:8621;580;MacMurray is miles away from his good guy image in My Three Sons on TV.
I:8621;581;Stanwyck is sultry and sexy (in a blonde wig) as Phyllis with her lips and eyes glistening with wicked deceit.
I:8621;582;It is SO worth it.
I:8621;583;Double Indemnity is a classic example of film noir.
I:8621;584;"woody Allen once called ""Double Indemnity"" the finest American movie ever made."
I:8621;585;He is a historian, a listener, a writer and a supreme judge of movies.
I:8621;586;"wickedly brilliant, fun to watch, dramatic, darkly comical, superbly written and flawlessly directed, ""Double Indemnity"" is one of those movies that should be embraced by all fans of the national and international cinema."
I:8621;587;That year they also had Going My Way in the Oscar race.
I:8621;588;As you watch this film just compare Fred Macmurray's performance with Bing Crosby who won best Actor for GMW, while FM wasn't even nominated!
I:8621;589;What makes it truly remarkable to me is that it never seems to age.
I:8621;590;one of its strong points is that two of its three stars are cast against type.
I:8621;591;core insurance salesman Walter Neff, while Edward G. Robinson, usually cast as the villain, is Barton Keyes, an eccentric, compassionate insurance claims investigator.
I:8621;592;As femme fatale Phyllis Dietrichson, Barbara Stanwyck plays the kind of woman she is often associated with, but this still is one of her greatest performances.
I:8621;593;the more you view the movie, the more you see how densely layered it is.
I:8621;594;Instead, it makes it more fascinating.
I:8621;595;Despite this knowledge, the movie turns out to be one of the most intense thrillers ever made.
I:8621;596;It's filled with `hold your breath' scenes, some of which have since been imitated in scores of films.
I:8621;597;The Academy chose for Best Picture the well.
I:8621;598;If you see one film noir film in your life this very well may be the one to see.
I:8621;599;Stanwyck is good, MacMurray is great (baby!)
I:8621;600;The creative team behind the film doesn't get any better either with the powerhouse noir team of James M. Cain's original novel, adapted for the screen by Raymond Chandler and directed by the peerless Billy Wilder.
I:8621;601;The 4 categories would be noir movies, those directed by Billy Wilder, films that unfold in flashback and pictures shot in beautiful black and white.
I:8621;602;Granted that DI might not represent the cream of each of those species, but it is highly representative of the best they can put on the silver screen.
I:8621;603;Even though the viewer senses that MacMurray is deep in trouble, the suspense actually builds!
I:8621;604;an unfaithful wife and wicked stepmother .
I:8621;605;She has TROUBLE stamped all over her!
I:8621;606;That old SP drumhead is a wonderful touch!)
I:8621;607;He dares Stanwyck to actually collect!
I:8621;608;It certainly closes the circle!
I:8621;609;It's safe to bet most viewers will believe that the eventual ending fits the plot more appropriately.
I:8621;610;DI was nominated for 4 Oscars: Best Movie, Director, Screenplay and Actress.
I:8621;611;a vastly more sympathetic part to say the least!
I:8621;612;"This is one of my all time favorite movies
I:8621;613;This edition looks and sounds great.
I:8621;614;Double Indemnity is considered one of the best film noir movies ever made but after viewing Universal's superb new Blu.
I:8621;615;ray presentation in honor of it's 70th Anniversary, I think it's one of the greatest films ever.
I:8621;616;This murder gone wrong story from James M. Cain's novel of the same name is nearly perfect due in no small part by the tight and suspenseful screenplay by Billy Wilder and Raymond Chandler.
I:8621;617;This is movie making at it's best and credit should go not only to Wilder but the three principle actors as well.
I:8621;618;Grays and whites are vivid and even objects in background scenes are more pronounced.
I:8621;619;But after finally viewing it in all it's Blu.
I:8621;620;ray glory you can finally see what Wilder was telling the audience.
I:8621;621;The light coming through the blinds at all angles is more striking on Blu.
I:8621;622;Double Indemnity arrives in a solid Blu.
I:8621;623;ray limited edition of Double Indemnity is essential to every film collectors library and come highly recommended.
I:8621;624;Offhand, can you think of a wittier, more satisfying, more fatalistic and doom.
I:8621;625;Wilder was the only director to discover and exploit the insinuating dark side of Fred MacMurray, and he certainly exploited Barbara Stanwyck's sultry sexuality for all it was worth.
I:8621;626;"out wonderful as a witty, tough insurance investigator
I:8621;627;Double Indemnity is a cynical masterpiece that serves notice of the long string of cynical masterpieces Wilder produced during his career.
I:8621;628;This is one of the best film noir examples of all time!
I:8621;629;both in terms of story and attitudes of the characters, but the movie is an excellent example of film noir and should be viewed by any fan of gritty crime dramas or noir fans.
I:8621;630;This is another big favorite of mine.
I:8621;631;Once again, there is excellent casting in this film with Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck.
I:8621;632;They do a wonderful job of drawing you into the film, making you a part of it.
I:8621;633;Fred MacMurray gives a surprisingly great performance as a semi.
I:8621;634;Stanwyck is cold, calculating, clever, and incredibly sexy, in a trampy sort of way.
I:8621;635;The dialogue is fast, sharp, and, frankly, amazing.
I:8621;636;And Edgar G. Robinson's character, Keyes, is equally brilliant.
I:8621;637;Seldom have I seen a movie as total, as complete, and as well crafted as this one is.
I:8621;638;The stepdaughter, representing innocence and morality .
I:8621;639;A great Billy Wilder film right up there with Mr. Wilder's magnificent Sunset Boulevard and The Apartment!
I:8621;640;Barbara Stanwyck is spectacular as the femme fatale with ice water running through her veins and deserved the Oscar.
I:8621;641;It is truly her pinnacle performance in a career that spanned decades.
I:8621;642;it is the best piece of work Fred McMurray ever did!
I:8621;643;Whether in a lead role or a supporting role the man was truly a giant in films!
I:8621;644;This is tense, gritty film noir at it's best, what more is there to say?
I:8621;645;A superb plot, directing, screenplay and a sterling cast.
I:8621;646;For the times, it's a wonderful production.
I:8621;647;Great direction and the acting is above par for most of the cast.
I:8621;648;Robinson and Stanwyck were wonderful and easily stole every scene they were in against MacMurray and there is still a high level of suspense even though you pretty much know how everything is gonna play out.
I:8621;649;Overall, for classic film lovers this is definitely a must see.
I:8621;650;It's incredible to think that Double Indemnity was only Billy Wilder's second film as a director.
I:8621;651;He exerts an astonishingly smooth control over all the story elements, not only the screenplay (which he co. authored with Raymond Chandler, no less) but also the witty and diabolical tone and the stylized performances by Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray.
I:8621;652;edged and pitiless vision of the world, one that contrasted sharply with World War Two.
I:8621;653;era jingoism and the popular sentimentality of mainstream films like the Andy Hardy series, for example.
I:8621;654;For all his tough talk, Walter Neff is one of the greatest fools in the history of American cinema.
I:8621;655;Double Indemnity is very sly, very funny.
I:8621;656;The Bottom Line:Though I still maintain that the framing device marrs Billy Wilder's otherwise flawless noir, Double Indemnity is a clever film and worthy classic that should be seen by anyone who enjoys film or the notion of a perfect murder.
I:8621;657;"I got this about a year ago as a present
I:8621;658;"Both Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck are at their best, this time in their careers
I:8621;659;I have always liked that actors like him could show that they could play a variety of roles, which makes them more exciting to watch.

I:8621;661;"maiden, looking for a way to get out of a loveless marriage, played by Barbara Stanwyk, ""Walter Neff,"" a happy."

I:8621;664;(He laughs and heads for the door.)
I:8621;665;The sexual chemistry between the two stars practically oozes off the screen, and the above scene is a wonderful example, just one of many.
I:8621;666;Edward G. Robinson is excellent as Barton Keyes, a cigar.
I:8621;667;"chomping blusterer, who's gruff exterior hides a razor sharp mind and a, ""Heart as big as a house."""
I:8621;668;But the film belongs, from first frame to last, to Barbara Stanwyk as Phyllis Dietrichson, the Femme Fatale from Hell.
I:8621;669;"As she brushes past him to get her coat there's a fleeting look of panic that passes over her face, she knows that THIS is IT, but she still doesn't know what Walter's decision will be, and even though WE know the answer the scene is still incredibly tense

I:8621;673;Her anklet, perfume, and manner enthrall Neff, and before long, she gets him to sell her husband accident insurance.
I:8621;674;this film is pure classic!
I:8621;675;This is a fun film noir with a great femme fatale played by Barbara Stanwyck (who could elsewhere do comedy, too), a likeable narrator played by Fred MacMurray as an insurance investigator, and a loveable mentor of the investigator played by Edward G. Robinson.
I:8621;676;Billy Wilder directs what is a classic in the genre of shadow and doubt.
I:8621;677;"His love of his ""son"" is an interesting plot device (though some cynical fans may call it corny)."
I:8621;678;great film great price great deliver.
I:8621;679;the familiar storyline of a corruptible man drawn into nefarious activities by an alluring femme fatale and kept from escaping by his obsession with her rarely was executed as brilliantly as in this film.
I:8621;680;Despite their contentious relationship, Wilder and Chandler crafted a fascinating and taut script that dripped with the sharp dialogue, such as the line above, which was Chandlers trademark.
I:8621;681;a fabulous cast brought Wilder and Chandlers vision to life.
I:8621;682;Wilder wore him down until MacMurray finally signed on and turned in an excellent performance as Walter Neff, who records the tale of his downfall on a dictating machine in his office at All.
I:8621;683;Edward G. Robinsons portrayal of wily insurance investigator Barton Keyes was a tour de force.
I:8621;684;A mainstay at Paramount since the days of silent film legend Rudolph Valentino, Seitz was a master of the shadows and light that was prevalent in later films noir.
I:8621;685;This masterpiece of noir suspense is faithful to James M. Cain's (Postman Always Rings Twice, Mildred Pierce) novel, and the casting and cinematography enhance the story.
I:8621;686;Maybe Chandler added dialogue, but all the best lines are Cain's.
I:8621;687;the plot is classic film noir .
I:8621;688;naturally the story has some dated elements (it was made in 1943) but it still holds up pretty well as entertainment for a modern audience.
I:8621;689;macMurray is excellent in his role as a heel making a change from his usual nice guy roles.
I:8621;690;He helps make the character sympathetic whereas Stanwycks role has few redeeming features .
I:8621;691;The great Edward G. Robinson steals every scene he's in as the tenacious investigator who has a soft spot for Neff.
I:8621;692;it just provides great entertainment aimed at adults.
I:8621;693;It also marks a growing shift in the 1940s towards more maturity in Hollywood film.
I:8621;694;"This is not only the greatest film noir ever made
I:8621;695;It ranks with Citizen Kane as having the most impact on the way films were shot and structured.
I:8621;696;The extras and commentaries on this set are fine.
I:8621;697;but the film itself is the real star.
I:8621;698;This film does not only benefit form a great script but also from the excellent cast selection.
I:8621;699;Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck and Edward G. Robinson give stunning perfomances and provide the viewer with almost two hours of suspense.
I:8621;700;The atmosphere is there and the dialogue very clever.
I:8621;701;The director makes a fine use of shadows and lighting conditions.
I:8621;702;ray is worth the wait.
I:8621;703;The print is beautifully restored and the cleanest I have ever seen it, with a crystal.
I:8621;704;This movie was a best.
I:8621;705;guy and does a good job.
I:8621;706;there is a good moral to the story, which is eloquently stated by Edward G. Robinson's character.
I:8621;707;It is best not to tell you more, because you cannot tell more without giving away the plot.
I:8621;708;Barbara Stanwyck is the pretty, scheming, wife of an insurance.
I:8621;709;This film is a classic.
I:8621;710;This film hits the screen like a well trained Olympic runner with comfortable shoes who can feel the gold around his neck before his heels are even in the blocks.
I:8621;711;"Oh, sure, he knows it now
I:8621;712;yeah, that's right it was an insurance scam, see, and a good one too.
I:8621;713;He knows the whole layout, from top to bottom and side to side because he wrote the script along with another guy you might have heard about, Raymond Chandler, another member of the club who just happens to know his way around the block and back again.
I:8621;714;"This film will give you the kind of ride a Six Flags park could only dream of, and that's what makes ""Double Indemnity"" one you're going to remember like a first kiss on a warm night in summer."
I:8621;715;"Wilder got his first of many deserved Oscar nominations for this early foray into the realm of ""noir""."
I:8621;716;Indeed, Stanwyck was amazing (Oscar nominated) and Fred MacMurray held his own against her strong performance.
I:8621;717;Also, cast against type, was the great Edward G. Robinson (also never nominated) in another reliably solid role.
I:8621;718;(At least HE received a Lifetime award).
I:8621;719;up toward this end is utterly fascinating.
I:8621;720;This, to me, is artistry and real talent.
I:8621;721;which is a three star value.
I:8621;722;we've got a classic movie.
I:8621;723;i'll give Universal a bit of credit.
I:8621;724;the film itself does seem a bit improved over the initial out of print release.
I:8621;725;but closer scrutiny of the two would be necessary and I've got a life so I'll leave that to others.
I:8621;726;"and then they take other films and run the package to two discs for no other reason than to make it ""seem"" important and packed with extras."
I:8621;727;"Fortunately they don't have near the number of ""must haves"" that Warner Brothers (who are first class all the way in their releases , particularly legacy films)or MGM or Columbia have!its a great movie."
I:8621;728;if you haven't seen it you are in for a rare treat!
I:8621;729;the Blu Ray looks spectacular!
I:8621;730;Double Indemnity is a truly classic film noir and it achieves this status with its tight, simple script and its marvelously efficient and effective direction.
I:8621;731;Both Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray give their best performances here and that is part of the charm.
I:8621;732;Edward G. Robinson was note perfect all the way through without breaking a sweat and, as an actor and a character in the movie, one knew he had it all over the scheming pair.
I:8621;733;Billy Wilder took away some of the needless, and often silly, twists, turns and complications of some film noir and boiled it down to its essence and what bubbled up was a classic both in the genre of film noir and beyond it into movies in general.
I:8621;734;The movie holds up wonderfully.
I:8621;735;who wrote the film adaptation here with Billy Wilder), James M. Cain never really returned to the prominence he enjoyed during the early part of the last century.
I:8621;736;In fact, between 1943 and 1947, at least one movie now considered a classic was made form a Cain novel.
I:8621;737;'43 brought us Ossessione, directed by the great Luchino Visconti and based on The Postman Always Rings Twice, adapted in America in 1946.
I:8621;738;1947 gave us one of the definitive noir films, Jacques Tourneur's Out of the Past.
I:8621;739;Billy Wilder, arguably the greatest director in American history, helmed an adaptation of Wilder's best novel, Double Indemnity.
I:8621;740;According to the AFI, the result is the twenty.
I:8621;741;ninth greatest movie in American history.
I:8621;742;She wants to get rid of her husband, and Neff knows the loopholes to get her the maximum from his insurance policies.
I:8621;743;class America here, and what a fine piece it is.
I:8621;744;if pressed to name my favorite noir film, the one that always comes to mind first in Sunset Blvd., but when you're trying to decide whether it or Double Indemnity (or a handful of others) is better, you're really splitting hairs.
I:8621;745;All of them really are just that good.
I:8621;746;Double Indemnity, sixty years later, is still one for the ages.
I:8621;747;It unwinds at an agonizing pace and is painful to watch, but fascinating and engaging all the same.
I:8621;748;"tHere are many original twists in this, in particular the wonderful character of Edward G. Robinson, an insurance investigator who has a ""gut feeling"" when something is a fraud that will cost the insurance company unjustly."
I:8621;749;I also loved the way the tension built between Stanwyck and Fred, as he comes to understand that their complicity links them for the rest of their lives.
I:8621;750;She is the most subtle character in the whole thing, I think.
I:8621;751;It is very fun and allows one to step out of oneself for nearly 2 hours, a kind of reservoir of the way I saw the world through TV from the age of 7 or so.
I:8621;752;This is one of the best of the genre.
I:8621;753;Instead, film noir embraces a number of themes and techniques to produce a unique kind of film.
I:8621;754;Film noir typically features stark black and white photography, with sometimes alarming, garish bright surfaces contrasted with pitch black shadows.
I:8621;755;film noir is also characterized by profound moral ambiguity.
I:8621;756;Barbara Stanwyck is my favorite actress, but what I like most about her is her amazing versatility.
I:8621;757;She excelled in just about any part she undertook, and was as great in comedy as she was in drama.
I:8621;758;But while a great comedienne, other actresses could match her in comedic performances.
I:8621;759;But absolutely no one can touch Barbara Stanwyck in film noir.
I:8621;760;Part of the reason is the powerful combination of great passion, emotional complexity, unclear loyalties, and enormous intelligence that she communicates.
I:8621;761;billy Wilder did a magnificent job directing this film, and many of the scenes as he filmed them are classic.
I:8621;762;Another is the wonderful blocking of the scene where Edward G. Robinson's character comes to visit Fred MacMurray and leaves just as Barbara Stanwyck comes up to the latter's door, forcing her to hide between the wall and the open door while the other two finish their conversation.
I:8621;763;One fascinating aspect of Billy Wilder's career is that he produced perhaps the three greatest films that in any way dealt with insurance companies: this film, THE FORTUNE COOKIE, and THE APARTMENT.
I:8621;764;I don't know if this was coincidence or reflects some deep personal concern Wilder had with the insurance industry.
I:8621;765;"best of all was Wilder's ""Double Identity."""
I:8621;766;point tension was reached and sustained in the passion of an insurance salesman and a passionately sensual femme fatale .
I:8621;767;Cold blooded and cunning, this film is truly a classic dark thriller.
I:8621;768;The first Stanwyck/MacMurray scene is better than most movies (even really good ones!)
I:8621;769;And, to give full credit, it was based on a novel by James M. Cain.
I:8621;770;If anyone cares, the Wikipedia entry on Double Indemnity's script writing is very illuminating.
I:8621;771;Although this film may seem clich d today, as many thrillers since have offered similar plot lines, rarely has the story been told so well.
I:8621;772;Although the movie is predictable (both for the genre and because the movie starts at the conclusion) it is still a fun ride.

I:8621;781;viewing the MacMurray/Stanwyck original as background to the commentaries.
I:8621;782;The few interjections he manages are interesting and intelligent.
I:8621;783;the commentators generally agree about how to interpret the film's plot and on the fact that the real heart of the film, its real love story, is the affection between the insurance salesman played by MacMurray and the insurance investigator played by Edward G. Robinson.
I:8621;784;listening to these two extras, you'll also learn a lot about James Cain, the author of the original serialized novella on which this story is based, as well a lot about Raymond Chandler, who co. wrote the screenplay.
I:8621;785;From the James M. Cain novel this is the finest film of its genre under the masterful of Billy Wilder and an absolute must.

I:8621;787;Edward G. Robinson is fine as the insurance investigator who goes by his hunch that there's more than meets the eye than just a simple suicide.
I:8621;788;with a brilliant script (the double entendres when Stanwyck fobs off the attentions of Mac Murray are a gem!)
I:8621;789;Double Indemnity stands as a towering achievement in cinema when a brilliant script, superb acting and excellent art direction and lighting are under the hands of a master.
I:8621;790;Possibly the greatest film noir of all time, this Wilder classic is something I can watch over and over again.
I:8621;791;Simmering sex appeal and Hitchcock worthy suspense build from the first scene.
I:8621;792;Wilder's decision to focus on the villains and putting the husband in only two scenes forces us to root for them, and greatly increases the tension.
I:8621;793;Double Indemnity is a stylish piece of film noir with all of the typical ingredients.
I:8621;794;Walter Neff(MacMurray) is an insurance salesman.
I:8621;795;He is incredibly likable, a bulldog with a soft heart.
I:8621;796;this movie has great pacing thanks to director Billy Wilder's masterful touch.
I:8621;797;It is an intense thrill ride, even though we know what is going to happen.
I:8621;798;MacMurray's flashback narrative is excellent, and it is no wonder this movie gave his career a rebirth.
I:8621;799;The role also inspired other 30s male actors to reinvent themselves in the genre.
I:8621;800;The movie is in black and white, classic to film noir.
I:8621;801;gray case of 1927, DOUBLE INDEMNITY is terrific fun to watch.
I:8621;802;A starkly realistic film noir that is truly remarkable on all levels.
I:8621;803;a dark masterpiece of murder.
I:8621;804;Stanwyck is astonishing in her playing of the seductive, rotten.
I:8621;805;"MacMurray is terrific in a very untypical role and although Stanwyck's blonde wig is quite obvious and slightly bothersome, she gives us a performance well worth mulling over
I:8621;806;As Barton Keyes, Edward G. gives a nicely crafted performance and Tom Powers is appropriately boorish in his characterization of the unfortunate Mr. Dietrichson.
I:8621;807;The music score is by the famed Miklos Rozsa and the excellent cinematography is by John F. Seitz.
I:8621;808;It cemented Bily Wilders career as a great director and was responsible for many movies of its kind since.

I:8621;810;The train scenes, with Ins.
I:8621;811;And the later scenes with the train witness brought in to see E. g. Robinson's inquisitive insurance investigator are deviously hilarious, something that Wilder embellished thru just about all his later films.
I:8621;812;A great film starting with the insurance man's attempts to sell insurance to the late Ms. Stanwyck's devious unhappy spouse.
I:8621;813;macMurray, usually the genial good guy and later best remembered for his television roles, gives Walter just enough edginess to make him both sympathetic and convincing as an insurance salesman who is willing to get shady to make the sale and get the dame.
I:8621;814;barbara Stanwyck excels as the sultry Phyllis who, from the moment she enters the frame and you see her ankle bracelet, you know is trouble.
I:8621;815;Double Indemnity (referring to the double indemnity of Mr. Diedrichson's insurance policy) is classic film noir at its best.
I:8621;816;The writing is crisp and catchy, the dialogue is peppered with great lines and phrases and the acting is stellar.
I:8621;817;and that makes the movie good.
I:8621;818;a real feast for the noir fan.
I:8621;819;Fred McMurray and Barbara Stanwick are at the top of their game in this Film Noir treasure.
I:8621;820;Fred McMurray was a fine serious actor and well as a TV star.
I:8621;821;He founded a fine winery in California too.
I:8621;822;the fast talking banter back and forth is just so funny and campy.
I:8621;823;Everyone does a great job, especially Edward G. Robinson as the insurance company investigator.
I:8621;824;There's a lot of complexity in this movie and you may have to watch it a couple of times to get it all.
I:8621;825;It is the middle of the night in downtown Los Angeles, luscious film noir land brilliantly photographed by John Seitz in high gloss and grippingly scored by Miklos Rozsa.
I:8621;826;but Wilder and co. writer/novelist Raymond Chandler make both men complex and curiously sympathetic.
I:8621;827;"The climax is gripping and curiously erotic, with ""Tangerine"" playing on a radio up the street earlier that evening."
I:8621;828;DOUBLE INDEMNITY is a film noir masterpiece and an almost perfect movie that even allegedly pleased Wilder.
I:8621;829;Starting with an amazing cast and a great plot, this film lives up to anyone's expectations.
I:8621;830;I don't want to give much more away, but, even if you are not a film noir fan, you will find this to be a tightly written, wonderfully acted drama.
I:8621;831;This classic is well worth owning.

I:8621;834;"And so, Walter plans the ""perfect"" crime."
I:8621;835;A nearly flawless film and one that really defines the genre.
I:8621;836;In the process, he loses his career, friend, a woman who really loved him and ultimately his life.
I:8621;837;the main plot of the story is the external one: to get away with the perfect murder in order to be with the woman he loves.
I:8621;838;But our hero chooses to redeem himself at the end.
I:8621;839;This minor plotline of Lola and her boyfriend's love is crucial to the hero's redemption.
I:8621;840;double Indemnity is a very tight story.
I:8621;841;Each character plays roles on multiple plotlines and each scene provides turning points of expanding stakes and meaning.
I:8621;842;It absolutely proves the idea that even a small loss of morality will lead to the ultimate destruction.
I:8621;843;I enjoy an old movie occasionally.
I:8621;844;For one thing, the simplicity that used to exist in film is refreshing if the plot is good, and this one is.
I:8621;845;"In fact, I thought it one of the best, right up there with ""Strangers on a Train."""
I:8621;846;A trip back in time reminds us that astounding special effects are not absolutely required of good film artistry.

I:8621;851;"The ""Columbo"" type insurance investigator, Keyes, played to the hilt by Edward G. Robinson, adds spice to the mix."
I:8621;852;This film is a must for any serious cinema buff, and it was long overdue for a special edition, and this does not disappoint.
I:8621;853;One of the indisputable masterpieces of cinema.

I:8621;856;An essential film noir, Edward G. Robinson's character is outstanding.
I:8621;857;But it all works together, and again I credit Robinson for the being the stabilizing factor.
I:8621;858;Every aspect of this pioneering film noir is perfect, in its seedy, monochrome portrayal of L. a. in the forties.
I:8621;859;Cinematograpahy, music, editing and direction are of the highest standard.
I:8621;860;Scripting is superior (credit goes to Billy Wilder and Raymond Chandler) and the dialogue bristles with innuendo, wit and extremely eloquent exchanges, though it may seem campy by today's standards.
I:8621;861;The performances of Barbara Sranwyck as the adulteress and Fred MacMurray (a light actor who nevertheless provides a powerful contribution as her love.
I:8621;862;Great performances and a great script.
I:8621;863;This is as good as it gets in 1944.
I:8621;864;Career performances by Barbara Stanwyck, Fred MacMurray and Edward G Robinson guided by the brilliant direction of Billy Wilder make this one of the best films ever to come out of Hollywood.
I:8621;865;the screenplay explodes with just the right dialogue.
I:8621;866;if you like film, you will love Double Indemnity.
I:8621;867;It was such a refreshing change from all the modern crappy films today that it inspired me to watch more black and white films.
I:8621;868;It wasn't about the action, the high tech scenes, just character develop and sit back and enjoy the ride.
I:8621;869;Although the picture is very sharp it has many scratches on it.
I:8621;870;Thank you, Universal, for *finally* releasing this Special Edition of the greatest noir film ever.

I:8621;873;She is the ultimate femme fatale.

I:8621;875;Instead, Neff meets Mrs. Deitrichson and believes he finds a lonely housewife eager for his charms.
I:8621;876;dOUBLE INDEMNITY is as fine a film, not just a film noir, that was made inside the studio system of the wartime forties, one to watch and watch again.
I:8621;877;so if your trolly is equiped with a video replay system, this is one that you'll likely watch until the end of the line.

I:8621;900;Double Indemnity is a superb story about an insurance salesman who gets involved with a woman married to a husband she doesn't care for.
I:8621;901;The murder of her husband is planned perfectly and brilliantly, but it all comes crashing down.
I:8621;902;Neff is very successful at what he does (He's been at it for eleven years).

I:8621;904;one of the most memorable performances in the movie is Edward G. Robinson's Barton Keyes, the claims manager, a brilliant fellow who is by hunches when a claim doesn't seem right.
I:8621;905;I did it for the money and for a woman.
I:8621;906;I love films that are centered on the conversations, innuendos, accusations, etc.
I:8621;907;The result was one of the greatest screenplays ever penned and one of the most memorable film noir suspense movies ever made.
I:8621;908;the dialogue crackles sharply throughout, and never more notably than in the first meeting between Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck in the latter's home in the Los Feliz section of Los Angeles.
I:8621;909;The insurance pro decides on a policy with a double indemnity clause for a larger payoff, assuring her that the plan will work since he is professional enough to carry it off.
I:8621;910;while Stanwyck and MacMurray provide stellar performances as the conspirators and ultimately murderers, Edward G. Robinson provides a performance on par with his brilliant effort in Little Caesar, which skyrocketed him to stardom.
I:8621;911;for gripping suspense, superb acting, and brilliant dialogue one cannot hope to top Double Indemnity.
I:8621;912;It deserves the celebrated masterpiece label which it has been accorded.
I:8621;913;The use of voice over is brilliant and the two stars have never been better.
I:8621;914;Billy Wilder's was a master story teller.
