1;this moive deals with real passions, dreams, fears, and general problems.
2;al (a sergent/banker) deals with the revival of his 20 year marrage and the growing up of his children.
3;peggy (Al's daughter) dealing with first love and questioning her morals for that love.
4;its a movie that will move you in a special way, by the end of it you feel as thought you know these people.
5;"The presence of that feeling, ""I just have to make it."""
6;This Academy Award winner in 1946, directed by William Wyler, depicts the return of three WWII vets who meet on a plane back to their middle America home town of Boone City.
7;frederic March plays Al Stevenson, an older bank executive who was a seargent in the war, He comes home to a loving family and wonderful wife played by Myrna Loy.
8;He comes home to see his children older and very much changed.
9;He hooks up with his recent companions as they all celebrate.
10;Although it's a night of fun and celebration, there is a darker side as the best way he can think of to reunite with his family is to get drunk.
11;Maenwhile, he finds a possible new love interest in an unlikely place.
12;I highly recommend this great classic.
13;this pictures' theme which centers around the trials and tribulations of three WW2 vets returning home and their efforts to reintegrate back into civilian life is as timeless as the picture itself.
14;director William Wyler did a masterful job of keeping everything taut and focused as the movie unfolds before us.
15;harold Russell who plays a navy vet whose hands and forearm have been lost in an aboard ship battle won two Oscars for his portrayal.
16;he infused his character with just the right combination of emotions.
17;his is the one we see with the most potential for an easy re.
18;the picture works on so many levels with the characters touching us all in some small way that it easily elevates it above your average run of the mill war picture.
19;and it's easy to see why this picture hit home poignantly touching a nationwide nerve just after the war.
20;this is one movie that is a must see AND must own.
21;one of the best movies ever made and in my top ten.
22;This is the best movie I have ever watched.
23;a great movie for ages 12 to 100.
24;A great and realistic snap shot of the past.
25;dana Andrews and Myrna Loy just wonderful.
26;brought back many old memories, Live was great back then wheb people were moral and carried for each other.
27;This is one of the most wonderful love story I watched.
28;Long, but excellent film about three WWII veterans returning home to their women and jobs.
29;considering that this was made a year after WWII ended, and one of the soldiers is severally maimed, this is an excellent portrait of people's real day.
30;Winner of seven Academy Awards, including best picture, director, actor and screenplay, William Wyler's brilliant drama about adjustment is one of the all.
31;time classics of American cinema.
32;It spans a complex range of honest emotions, from joyous celebration and happy reunion to deep.
33;in vivid contrast to the gorgeous lighting, which decorates The Cook et, all as if every scene is a carnival show, this movie illuminates every nook and cranny.
34;All the rooms are sunny and happy, as if it is always mid.
35;long before special effects, Hollywood relied more on dialogue, emotional acting and sheer entertainment talent to tell a story.
36;During the film, you marvel as Russell uses his metal hooks, but never see his arms without them.
37;The director wisely keeps this for the end.
38;in a pivotal scene, the maimed Russell removes the machinery (his hands) from the plot, revealing his all too human self.
39;A family friendly movie that shows all the hardships families went through because of World War II.
40;Our entire family loved this movie.
41;Harold Russell and Dana Andrews were outstanding in their roles .
42;It is just a honest look at what happens when some veterans returen from war.
43;This film never once goes for sap and every scene is raw and full of emotion and power!
44;It is still relevant today due to the fact that the cruel mannerisms of war are still being felt and fought around the world.
45;This is a very realistic, uplifting, and revealing tearjerker about post war life for WWII vets.
46;The title is aboslutely perfect as is the casting.
47;The writing is crisp and poignant.
48;There is love found and love lost but no sappiness.
49;all the actors are perfectly cast in their roles .
50;This is by far one of the best films I saw, ever.
51;Even if it's old it's very modern!
52;A famous film which is now starting to look its age a little.
53;The performances are fine (especially Frederick March), although the script is a little on the pat side.
54;Gives good perspective of war veteran coming home with a disability.
55;I liked the interviews in bonus features as well.
56;They have more recent interviews with two of top female stars.
57;Film is slow compared to today's films, but tells a good story.
58;The Best Years of Our Lives is a WONDERFUL film that was revolutionary in its handling of the subject of battle fatigue and PTSD.
59;A beautiful, moving story that is will bring tears to your eyes and bless your heart.
60;"Family bonds are prized and fostered
I:8445;61;I bought this movie for one of my classes, as it was required to watch.
I:8445;62;The movie was actually very interesting.
I:8445;63;Though I probably wouldn't have normally just picked up this movie to watch (not that I would have even found it around here), I enjoyed it, and I'm glad my professor had us watch it.
I:8445;64;Could we make a movie today so honest about the real challenges war veterans face coming home?
I:8445;65;i want to own this film for nostalgic reasons, and to be able to pass a piece of history to my family.
I:8445;66;but the fundamental, primary point is this: This movie provides a very well.
I:8445;67;It is a true classic in every sense of the word.
I:8445;68;A must see film, as good or better than any Capra film.
I:8445;69;A great message of unrequited love and hope.
I:8445;70;Great cast and direction from William Wyler.
I:8445;71;This film is a """"must see"""" for anyone who has a family member or friend returning from war."""
72;It endears the audience from the opening frame and keeps us glued till the closing one.
73;Al Stephenson has been married for twenty years, has two practically grown children and a very well.
74;`The Best Years of Our Lives' weaves these stories with such fluidity and really embraces each of them with such heart and soul, giving us a real reason to root for each of these men to succeed and find the peace they need to move on.
75;March, Andrews and Russell are astonishingly good in their roles.
76;Even the women here are outstanding, with Myrna Loy and Virginia Mayo really making the most of their roles.
77;beautifully acted, profoundly written and directed to perfection, `The Best Years of Our Lives' is raw, earnest and honest and captures a truth that many films could only dream of.
78;It is still profound and meaningful today, hitting with great power and presence and just completely worth every single second it takes to watch.
79;I bought this as a gift for a friend of mine.
80;Movie confronts topic of post.
81;If you like older movies, you just may enjoy this one.
82;This should be required viewing for our newest generation of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans.
83;I had never heard of it, but yet it was SO appropriate, SO relevant, so moving that I was in tears.
84;I would recommend this film to any generation.
85;With its timeless tale of war and its after effects on the home front.
86;Great classic movie showing life post WW2 and the impact on people's lives.
87;This movie is a timeless classic.
88;Very well done, don't miss it.
89;Viewed: 9/13Rate: 89/13: The Best Years of Our Lives is a good film, but it's certainly not the Best Picture of the Year material.
90;hur, William Wyler's other work.
91;As far as the acting goes, Myrna Loy is the winner for me.
92;She was sublime and a real woman.
93;Frederic March and Dana Andrews were very good too.
94;Virginia Mayo played her part beautifully well.
95;All in all, The Best Years of Our Lives is a good.
96;This is quite a remarkable film.
97;So they ride home together, and agree to keep in touch.
98;Especially his daughter Peggy (Teresa Wright), who has turned into a lovely and smart and very nice girl.
99;His wife Marie (Virginia Mayo) had been living with them for awhile, but moved out and got her own place, and also got a job in a nightclub.
100;the girl next door he has loved since they were kids .
101;"Al has brought his wife and daughter out to ""paint the town,"" and he's stinking drunk."
102;What a great film that I was surprised to love.
103;I really enjoyed this movie.
104;I love these old movies!
105;Everyone should see this one at least once.
106;This is my very favorite movie, ever.
107;It beautifully tells the story of the challenges faced by veterans returning from war, and, as such, it is as relevant a film today as it was back in 1946.
108;The story, direction, and, especially, the acting in this movie are top.
109;The movie flows so well that the almost three hour length of the story zips by.
110;warner has done a decent job mastering this in high definition.
111;ray does overcome many of the issues with this movie in previous format mastering.
112;Most of the scenes are sharp, black levels are good, and the contrast is just right.
113;For those of us who were too young to understand or even realize what it was like in the US after WWII, the movie provides a glimpse of what returning soldiers and sailors experienced.
114;I adore old movies and this was a good one!
115;It gives good insight in what can happen in relationships and family post war!
116;For those of us that don't have immediate family who have come back from war it was an eye opener and gives me lots more understanding and lots of compassion!
117;The sound track is the original in English.
118;Get over it, and enjoy the Film and Sound!
119;"This excellent movie is about three soldiers returning home after WW II and their attempts at adjustment
I:8445;120;professional actor and had lost both hands on D. day, is the man with the hooks who feels society viewing him as a freak.
I:8445;121;The picture is a bit long at 170 minutes, but there is some great drama here, too.
I:8445;122;The scene with Andrews in the cockpit of the scrapped bomber is terrific, and Russell's portrayal is complex, poignant, and powerful.
I:8445;123;Captured a slew of Oscars and deservedly so.
I:8445;124;This movie is truly timeless.
I:8445;125;William Wyler is one of the all time great directors.
I:8445;126;Kudos to Sam Goldwyn for making it.
I:8445;127;The cinematography is also pure art.
I:8445;128;One of the best classic movies to own!!
I:8445;129;Highly recommend this movie to everyone.
I:8445;130;One of the greatest movies ever.
I:8445;131;Its a great movie filled with love, friendship, and family.
I:8445;132;Its a great World War II movie that shows what people had to go through to find jobs and get around.
I:8445;133;This is an absolutely tremendous motion picture about guys returning from WWII, focusing on the scars they carry both inside and out.
I:8445;134;(Mr. Russell is now one of my heroes"
135;Dana Andrews portrays the other returning soldier and, while he was the odd man out at award time, his part as the captain flyboy from a poor background is equally well drawn and played.
136;"Turning his whirlwind wartime wedding into a happy marriage to a beautiful blonde (Virgnia Mayo) is just one of the challenges he must face
I:8445;137;seldom does a film from this era (1946) have this kind of depth of characterization and fully fleshed.
I:8445;138;Add in the terrific camera work by the man who photographed """"Citizen Kane"""" and you've got a tremendous film with an awesome cast."""
139;It was a very honest story of what it was like for returning soldiers in World War IIA wonderful cast showed how good actors should be!
140;Returning from war and picking up a life that has been on 'hold', this film is full of emotion and drama and makes it easier to understand what it may have been like for people at the time the Second World War ended.
141;I remembered seeing this film on TV many years ago, but wasn't overly impressed by it.
142;I'm not sure if it is due to the age of the film, or my own age (or a combination of the two), but both my husband and I defintely enjoyed watching it again.
143;This is my favorite film of all time, a 3.
144;The Best Years of Our Lives began life as a book.
145;as is almost always the case with great movies, many other happy accidents happened along the way, such as the casting of Dana Andrews as Fred Derry.
146;"best performances here, certainly the devilishly gorgeous Virginia Mayo, almost always a ""nice"" girl in her other roles, but here she chews the scenery in the small apartment she shares with Andrews and you find yourself wishing she'd been a bigger star."
147;at any rate this is a great film, and the long scenes detailing the three veterans' first day home from the war is so good it could almost be a movie all by itself.
148;The world we live in today is in large part a product of men like these, and it's good that we have a movie like this to honor them and their sacrifices.
149;This movie is about them, and it's a movie as fascinating and interesting as they themselves are.
150;The Best Years of Our Lives isn't a historical artifact like an old shoebox full of rusty medals and yellowed love letters, it's a living, breathing, fully entertaining monument to a time and a generation that are as important to us today as they ever were.
151;Watch it and see what I mean.
152;One of the best movies about coming home from war .
153;ever. . . vERY bold movie .
154;Even though parts of the movie are dated, it is a great way to soberly remember the sacrifices of service men and the families that they were forced to leave behind.
155;It won 8 Academy Awards .
156;Harold Russell: what an incredible actor!
157;It was well acted and cool to see how things have changed since WWII.
158;Everything that goes on in this film about returning vets is spot on.
159;the cast is stellar, the writing and pacing of the movie is top notch.
160;Teresa Wright was great as the young woman who saw so much potential in Dana Andrews character.
161;i highly recommend that you give this movie a view.
162;The Best Years of Our Lives is a compelling dramatic masterpiece, and certainly one of the best films ever made.
163;"It's not as well known today as other pieces from the period, such as ""Casablanca"" or ""Citizen Kane"", but it is nevertheless a classic that deserves ranking with those same films."
164;He hopes to return home to a better life, a nice home with his wife, and a better job.
165;sergeant Stevenson comes home to better circumstances, being a banker in the civilian world with a wife, two grown children, and a nice apartment.
166;this may seem like a depressing film, but it is actually uplifting in its entirety because it does show that hope doesn't die, and that you really can come home again after all.
167;It is also a film of historical importance due to the insights it provides into post.
168;world War II America, and the struggles of veterans in the post.
169;the film has certainly earned accolades over the years.
170;It won the Oscar for Best Picture of 1946.
171;It was named by the American Film Institute as one of the 100 Best Movies ever made, and was also named as one of the most important films of all time by the National Archives for the National Film Registry.
172;Still firmly in the ranks with Gone With The Wind, the Mrs. Miniver series, The Wizard of Oz and the many Disney films we and our children and grandchildren all grew up with and watching it time after time.
173;The theme of service men trying to adjust to civilian life after the war was well written and acted.
174;The amputee was outstanding in his role.
175;This film has been around my entire life, and each time I view it I enjoy it more.
176;A must for every drama fan.
177;Acting and photography are both so much better now than in 1946 .
178;but it is thought provoking and initeresting.
179;The Best Years of Our Lives aired every Decoration Day .
180;the day dedicated to the survivors of war.
181;In many ways, Homer has the easiest transition.
182;He has a wonderful family waiting for him.
183;He receives generous veterans and disability benefits.
184;In the end, he shows his girlfriend just how helpless he really is, when she reacts with kindness and love, the journey to happiness can begin.
185;He finds a daughter is a young woman and a son who is smarter and more observant than his father .
186;Al has one of the best stories about not taking a hill and losing the war that I've ever heard.
187;War was a chance for this handsome, charming man to become a natural leader.
188;the title is very meaningful.
189;Was it during the war or has the best yet to come?
190;the rich man who's come to know the working.
191;Each man is given greatest respect, presented to the audience as a noble warrior returned home with a new perspective on who they are and what they want from their lives.
192;The purpose of the movie is to embody the nation's love for their fighting men, to say that times may be tough as they adjust, but that the American people recognized the fighting men as heroes to a generation.
193;I absolutely LOVE this film!
194;So many aspects of coming home from war are touched upon in this film.
195;When I see it, I wonder sometimes if we have really changed so much.
196;And then when the day finally arrives that he is actually going home, the uncertainty sets in.
197;Will I be able to relate to them?
198;The soldier who comes home only to find that his wife has moved on.
199;as well, the family who waits for the returning soldier.
200;the performances in this film are stellar and the musical soundtrack really captures the heart of the film.
201;The music reaches a crescendo that transports us into the battle with the loud and unwavering hum of the bombers as they enter a dangerous confrontation with the enemy.
202;The fact that an actual veteran, played by Harold Russell, with a real disability is in the movie helps make it the classic that is truly is.
203;i hope that MGM, or whoever the distributor is, will come out with a fully restored version and a documentary that talks about the making of and legacy of this wonderful film.
204;They immediately bond and we see how their lives develop back home from the war days.
205;Each one of them struggles to readjust.
206;Throughout the film I thought the character with the most distinction was the wife of the banker.
207;She seems very sophisticated all throughout.
208;But it is a very relevant film, especially nowadays to any soldiers returning from Afghanistan, and a very revealing film.
209;As it provides insight into life as a returning soldier.
210;It is probably one of the finest examples of storytelling of 1940s Hollywood.
211;Great screenplay by Robert Sherwood, based on a book written in blank verse, Glory For Me, by MacKinlay Kantor.
212;best Actor in a Leading Role: Fredric MarchBest Actor in a Supporting Role: Harold RussellBest Director: William WylerBest Film Editing: Daniel MandellBest Music: Hugo FriedhoferBest Screenplay: Robert E. SherwoodBest Motion PictureWatching it again, I am fascinated by the facial reactions of the actors, something a screenwriter cannot easily direct from the page, and I find the actor's talent and director William Wyler's talent and observations are key to the depth of the scene.
213;This work shines brightly as a masterpiece of storytelling on film.
214;the scoring by Hugo Friedhofer won the Oscar and his music is perfect for the emotional themes drawn out.
215;His themes tie the varied returning veteran's experiences together into a seamless narrative mixing pride, uncertainty, joy, darkness and redemption.
216;His scoring for the Homecoming and the Citation scenes always brings me to tears.
217;and every scene is like a photo masterpiece, thoughtfully plotted by Gregg Toland.
218;It is notable to me the best representation of the universal experience of the Post.
219;war era is this personal tale of three men and their families, permanently altered and living their lives, from that point of reunion to the re.
220;creation of their new reality of America as they hope to embrace it.
221;It is the reality and the hope.
222;40's movies have a tough edge on the personality's because they were tough times and tough people to match.
223;So here is a movie made by a guy who was really in the war ( Billy Wilder) and that is as real as it gets.
224;But it has to be a story of hope too.
225;A great movie about a historic and under reported reality, vets in post world war II America.
226;One of my favorite movies.
227;Although World War II had just ended, there was now a new and more immediate sense of uncertainty about our future.
228;some women discovered that working was a liberating experience and they felt independent for the first time in their lives.
229;Hisfiancee is very happy to see him and displays no alarm or disgust at his handicap.
230;All this atomic energy and scientific efficiency.
231;Peggy's attempt to comfort her confused father are exemplified in the following scene:Peggy: Nice to have you around, dad.
232;His stepmother and father admire all the medals on his uniform.
233;Marie showed that she was a strong and independent women by going out and getting a job and moving into her own apartment.
234;"All right, I'll show you ya!"""
235;Many of the film's scenes take place in bedrooms.
236;She follows him upstairs to his bedroom where he is able to be intimate with her.
237;She wraps her arms around his neck and kisses him.
238;this scene was reflective of the changes that American families had undergone as a result of World War II, because it showed the woman being strong and independent.
239;She tucked him into bed and she kissed him goodnight.
240;She told him that she loved him.
241;reliant, independent and able to make decisions for themselves and their family.
242;i enjoyed this movie in unexpected ways.
243;But it does a masterful job of revealing an astringent, non.
244;The characters are believable because they represent nearly all walks.
245;It's a wonderful film to have in a permanent collection.
246;This was one of the best movies ever made.
247;Great movie about the problems WWII vets had when returning to the US.
248;I recommend this to all viewers.
249;I thought this was a great reflection of how America was right after World War 2.
250;Not often do you see real situations in movies today, and if you think about WWII and the era it is even more unusual.
251;It is fun watching an old black and white movie.
252;This is probably the best post.
253;This effort on behalf of the country's servicemen earned eight Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Actor for Frederic March, and two for Harold Russell (Homer).
254;"one for Best Supporting Actor, and another for ""bringing hope and courage to his fellow veterans."
255;And does a movie have to be about war to be a deeply emotional.
256;a film with real drama, believable characters, excellent writing, and unintrusive direction.you must see The Best Years of Our Lives.
257;Director William Wyler takes the viewer through an emotional story of 3 men returning home after WWII.
258;Even today the movie holds up and is one of the best war time movies made.
259;I highly recommend it to anyone.
260;"It won 7 Oscars including Best Picture, Best Actor for Fredric March (Al Stephenson), Best Director for William Wyler, Harold Russell, who played Homer Parrish, won 2 awards, Best Supporting Actor and an honorary Oscar ""For bringing hope and courage to his fellow veterans through his appearance in The Best Years of Our Lives."""
261;Myrna Loy is wonderful as Milly Stephenson and Teresa Wright fresh off her Oscar win for Mrs. Miniver delivers another stand out performance as Peggy, Al and Milly's daughter.
262;Dana Andrews is wonderful as is Virginia Mayo.
263;This masterpiece depicts the lives of 3 U. s. servicement after their return home from WW2.
264;The way the story is weaved to accurately portray 3 very destinct characters is amazing, and unparalled to this day.
265;This is a phenomenal movie.
266;It is rare to find the type of character development and human feeling found in this movie, something that seems to be absent from most movies today.
267;In addition to superb acting by the four principal actors, you truly come away from this movie sharing the sense of personal dislocation experienced in the aftermath of WWII.
268;This film is a true post.
269;Each story is touching in its own way.
270;He won two Academy Awards for this.
271;a special award for inspiring disabled veterans and a Best Supporting Actor Oscar.
272;This film also features some of the best black and white cinematography I've ever seen.
273;The flight back into their hometown at the beginning of the film is just beautiful.
274;This is a great movie that has held up really well over time.
275;At the time, it dealt very honestly and realistically with issues of war veterans returning home, and the adjustments their families and relatives have to make.
276;but what makes this such a great movie is that it is a story of love and hope.
277;the Myrna Loy and Fredric March characters are a middle aged couple who thoroughly understand and still deeply love one another.
278;life injured veteran, and his girlfriend, played by Cathy O'Donnell, is the classic relationship of the girl.
279;the best love story is that of the characters of Dana Andrews and the lovely Theresa Wright.
280;Wright's character is thoroughly well.
281;bred, independant, and intelligent, having been raised in comfortable upper.
282;the movie ends on a wonderful shot .
283;Between the movie and its actors, it won seven Oscars.
284;Best Years of our Lives was made in 1946, and is an excellent film about three returning veterans.
285;By respecting the traumas involved, it also brought out the honor, faithfulness, and dignity of the principal characters.
286;It captured my heart and didn't let go until the credits started rolling.
287;That's remarkable, but not surpirsing.
288;This film is totally unique in its flavor and character, due in no small part to the talents and artistic vision of William Wyler, the great cast, the great story, and the timing of its theatrical release.
289;As another reviewer has speculated, it must have had an extremely powerful effect on the audiences of that day.
290;It's still a memorable film.
291;viewing experience now, 55 years later.
292;The wonderful cross country ride in the nose of a B.17 as the three returning veterans get a bird's eye view of the land they fought to save (one of them losing his hands in the process).
293;the most compelling tidbit of nostalgia I've ever seen on film, and an honest peek into a bright, optimistic world that is long gone.
294;For younger viewers, it's an engaging drama and a truthful history lesson about who we as Americans are and where we've come from.
295;I was a small child when this was made, but I can still remember the flavor of those post.
296;As I mentioned before, The Best Years of our Lives has only been readily available for viewing, either on TV or personal video, for the past ten or 15 years, and that's also true now of a lot of the great films (luckily for us!)
297;This movie is an emotional one with an emotional appeal, so it's no surprise that it moves up and down in the top 100 lists.
298;A while back, in the early '90s, it was in the top five.
299;Lately it's in the top 70 or so.
300;The people who make these lists are fickle, and so the lists take you on a roller coaster ride over the years, but these things always seem to come full circle in due time.
301;i still remember, about ten years ago a top radio and TV talk show host announced that he had seen The Best Years of Our Lives the night before.
302;"The moment the opening credits roll, you know you're about to see the sharpest transfer of ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" ever released on home video."
303;Keep in mind, however, that there's still some graininess present .
304;ray, with subtitles available on everything except the theatrical trailer.
305;"Like ""Gone With the Wind,"" ""Casablanca"" and other Golden Age classics, ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" was NEVER shot with wide screen cameras."
306;Beyond cosmetic changes to the box .

309;"* Wilder, a tough man who hated schmaltz and sentiment, the director of such classics as ""Some Like it Hot,"" ""The Apartment,"" ""The Seven Year Itch"" and ""Sunset Boulevard,"" suddenly got emotional, expressing great affection for ""The Best Years of Our Lives,"" noting that it was one of the best films he had ever seen."
310;* He reacted the way I reacted.
311;"It was an unforgettable experience for him, and he recognized immediately that ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" was obviously a deeply personal work for Wyler, where every scene, every frame, every note of music and word of dialogue, rang true with authenticity and emotion."
312;To say that this is a great film is an understatement of the highest order.
313;And yet I can only count on one hand the number of friends I know who have seen this film from start to finish.
314;"* The wonderful thing about ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" is that it still holds up beautifully, unlike a lot of films that seem awkward or stilted."
315;Fredric March, as the patriarch of the family (in an Oscar winning role), is stupendous.
316;"And to have Myrna Loy as his partner and the wonderful Teresa Wright playing his daughter (the latter an Oscar winner a few years earlier in ""Mrs. Miniver""), how can you lose?"
317;* Like all great films, time has no meaning.
318;The story sweeps you along like a great wave .
319;is so fabulously understated and cynical and yet filled with such hope, that you can't help but be .
320;There's a treasure chest of great movies from the past that people overlook every day.
321;Some of the sentiment may seem dated but the movie packs an emotional punch and deserved Best Picture in 1946.
322;One of the best of the post.
323;"war American classics, perhaps the best until Coppola's ""The Godfather."""
324;The humor does a lot to balance what is the somber theme of the returning soldiers whose lives will never be the same.
325;The cast is superb, of course, topping the list is Myrna Loy, whom I adore, and Dana Andrews, a leading man type whom, with the coming of James Dean and company, history left behind.
326;"Think of ""Shane,"" for example, and all the post."
327;war men attractive, that is, their suffering, not their heroics.
328;It is a stupendous film, beautifully directed and acted.
329;Always a good saturday night show.
330;It is one of my favorites.
331;There was a little noise at the beginning during the opening credits, but otherwise the transfer was surprising clean for a movie that's over 60.
332;I'm going to order a copy right away.
333;For me, one of the BEST movies ever .
334;this is one of thsoe films where they seemed to mix a great story with perfectly cast actors.
335;I have seen all of these great actors (except Harold Russell .
336;I belive this is the only film he starred in) in many other films but they seemed to gel together here and create a better film than the story alone would have resulted in.
337;This is just a great, great film.
338;We've seen this movie on TV, and it was so good that we decided to get the blu.
339;It's a wonderful moving story, and worth seeing over and over.
340;A good movie i am speechless very amazing movie all the actors are awesome ,the lives of war veterans returning home it is timless and interesting story
341;A good look into the past filming and acting.
342;I would recommend this movie to everyone.
343;Very nostalgic, happy and sad.
344;Best Years is in my top 5 movies of all time.
345;It's a truly wonderful, moving film where the emotions of men coming home from war, and the reception they received on the home front, all still ring genuine, amazing for a film from 1946.
346;It deserved all the Oscars it won.
347;Come on, this is a movie deserving of grand treatment, as most of the all.
348;time great movies have been now.
349;This was my father's all time favorite movie, which may be one reason I love it so much.
350;then again, it's a damn good movie that still holds up!
351;It is the story of three soldiers return to civilian life after World War II, with an outstanding cast and a great 40's style.
352;"One is a family man with nearly grown children
I:8445;353;the storytelling in this film is wonderfully rich and complex, and it tells a story that remains relevant to this day, with struggles our own recent veterans are now facing in readjusting to civilian life, finding work, and reconnecting with their loved ones as changed men and women who are not the same as they were before they went to war.
I:8445;354;vietnam War film """"Coming Home"""", you will love this film."""
355;It has romance, drama, and above all, realism.
356;It is a true and seemingly timeless classic and I highly recommend it.
357;I enjoyed watching this old movie about the lives of three soldiers home from the war.
358;I had only seen snippets of this movie on TV through the years, so I was surprised and pleased at how good a film it is .
359;still relevant in many ways more than half a century after it was made.
360;It gives a realistic picture of what it was like for returning veterans from WWII, who came back to a largely mundane existence after the terror and excitement of war.
361;A great love story, with many twist and the characters are so real you really hope everything works out!
362;wonderful film, exceptional dialogue for the era, endearing, heartbreaking and compassionate but unfortunate dichotomy for today's vets.
363;all three men have happy endings and that's extremely unrealistic, but the insight provided and priceless interactions with wives, children, fellow vets, and old friends on their return was a rare highlight of the complications ensued by these brave men who served their country.
364;"now how does this translate, personal experience or just rumors about ""those"" kind of women overseas??"
365;high recommend for Myrna Loy, who I abs adore, veteran assimilation issues as well as love conquering all.
366;Many viewers of this great American movie .
367;it won seven Oscars, including Best Picture, for 1946 .
368;especially those with physical and psychological wounds .
369;won the Oscar for Best Writing.
370;if you like the movie, you will be richly rewarded by reading the poem.
371;Sherwood's choice was a wise one for the moviegoing public, and few are the hearts not moved by Harold Phillips' portrayal of Homer in the film.
372;But Kantor's portrayal of Homer and his girl Wilma are equally moving, perhaps because the poem gave more room for character development.
373;he masterfully compressed much of Kantor's material in eloquent but short scenes.
374;I am confident, though, that with each page the reader will find new lines and new scenes to savor and treasure.
375;The Best Years of Our Lives is a truly great American movie.
376;Glory for Me deserves equal recognition.
377;He dignified their individual struggles in a literary form that recalled the great epics and placed the American veterans among mankind's heroes.
378;a film that affected tens of millions .
379;This heartwarming story of three returning World War II veterans arriving home, andreadjusting to civilian life.
380;Perfectly captures the mood of post war U. s. still powerful today.
381;never gets old or stale always shed a tear and smile.
382;Probably the best true life investigation of the lives of the people involved in the aftermath of WWII.
383;How the people who stayed at home interacted with the men who actually served in war was compelling and heartwarming and poignant.
384;Certainly one of the best films of all time.
385;This is an Awesome movie which had my attention the entire time.
386;This is my favorite film .
387;This is about as true to life movie about readjusting to being home after hell.
388;I kinda understood better why after watching one of the best movies of all time.
389;good mix of lighthearted hummer and touching drama.
390;If you are a veteran, especially one that served in combat, you will truly be able to relate with this movie.
391;I'd highly recommend it for all veterans and lovers of classic b&w movies!!
392;With the recent deaths of Teresa Wright and Virginia Mayo, it gives a compelling reason to revisit one of the finest of American films, a deserved classic that focuses on the challenges faced by returning WWII veterans.
393;Directed by William Wyler, a master at capturing the spectrum of human behavior no matter the size of his canvas, this poignant 1946 film focuses on three men, all affected deeply by their wartime experiences.
394;colored by the Hollywood studio system.
395;a loyal wife (Myrna Loy in her typical role) and two well.
396;Although March won his second Oscar for this role, I feel the film's most impressive performance actually comes from Dana Andrews, who plays Air Force bombardier Fred Derry caught between a loveless marriage to good.
397;time gal Marie (Mayo) and a growing attraction toward Peggy, Al's fresh.
398;The third man is sailor Homer Parrish, portrayed in an honest, unaffected manner by real.
399;But the most powerful scenes belong to Andrews who faces the humiliation of going back to his pre.
400;One of the best films ever made in Hollywood.
401;Samuel Goldwyn's THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES under William Wyler's masterful direction is one of the great motion pictures of all.
402;Beautifully written, photographed, scored and directed this is movie making at its greatest.
403;It is REAL and real life.
404;We watch it every year!
405;Life is not always Disney and this is good!
406;Great movie, and it was in good condition, and the seller sent it very quickly.
407;One of the best movies ever made.
408;The close up camera shots of the actors are incredible.
409;There really has been a giant leap in technology as the picture is clearer and the sound is better.
410;Warms the heart and good for the soul.
411;It was not just parades and warm welcomes home from the returning veterans of WWII.
412;This movie accurately tells this story.
413;"tRUTH, that's the one word that comes to my mind after watching ""The Best Years of Our Lives""
I:8445;414;if you are interested in knowing why William Wyler is one of the greatest directors of all time, you must see this marvelous film.
I:8445;415;the cast is uniformly first.
I:8445;416;You'll need a handkerchief at least twice, trust me!
I:8445;417;An Academy Award winning movie that is one of the great classics that is a must.
I:8445;418;This movie (1946 Movie of the Year OSCAR) has everything HOLLYWOOD needed to make a TIMELESS CLASSIC"
419;William Wyler (OSCAR (1 of 4 he received in his career)), the greatest cast to be assembled for a post war classic.
420;Led by Fredrick March (Best Actor Oscar), Dana Andrews (Oscar nominee), Myrna Loy, Teresa Wright, Virginia Mayo Harold Russell real WWII veterans acting debut (Best Supporting Actor OSCAR plus a special 2nd Oscar for his inspirational performance as a handicap veteran.
421;This movie is also on the American Film Institutes greatest 100 movies in the last 100 years (1998).
422;If you want to experience all the emotions and joy of family commitment this movie delivers everything you could possibly desire.
423;william Wylers Direction is flawless and he perfectly tells the story which has an everlasting effect on its viewers.
424;Al is a Banker a 20 year married man with 2 kids.
425;What we the viewer share in this movie will be with us forever.
426;The family value film of a lifetime to share for an eternity.
427;Although they each have their own lives which we get to see first hand, they are still intertwined.
428;Together these three men find it within themselves to make these the best years possible.
429;Full of both highs and lows, this movie is extremely touching and leaves you with a smile.
430;This film is great because it does not try to glamorize and it stands the test of time in my mind.
431;the movie itself has a very good story and well acted.
432;The director really draws you into the story and connect with the people which makes it one of my all time favorites.
433;This 1946 movie is one of the great movies for the ages.
434;Frederic March is brilliant, as usual, as the Army Sergeant, Al Stevenson, returning to his wife (Myrna Loy, the archetypical good wife), family and well.
435;For his work in The Best Years Of Our Lives, he received an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, one of only two non.
436;professional actors to ever do so.
437;Actually, he received a second Oscar for the same role, a specially.
438;created honorary Oscar for Bringing Hope and Courage to Fellow Veterans.
439;At almost three hours, this is a long movie, but well worth your time.
440;"From the beginning you can tell you are watching a classic
I:8445;441;Despite its age, the film ages well because it covers themes that are still relevant today such as loyalty, adapting to new environments, self.
I:8445;442;This movie stands the test of time and despite repeated viewings will still amuse, entertain and touch most of us to the core.
I:8445;443;As for me I'll be keeping a lookout for a well.
I:8445;444;The cast included some of my favorite actors,Frederick March, Dana Andrews, Myrna Loy, who as a team gave a terrific performance.
I:8445;445;The movie deserved the Oscars earned for that year.
I:8445;446;I enjoy many movies and pride myself for having a discerning eye toward a good story told well and acted, directed and filmed with the highest standards.
I:8445;447;The Best Years meets all of these values and sets the highest bar to challenge all other movies combined.
I:8445;448;Viewing such a poignant story as it unfolds before us with such clarity and truthfulness as when the multiple amputee attempts to cope with sympathy from loved ones for his wounds, takes one well beyond simple feelings of empathy.
I:8445;449;a classic, real, movie that puts.
I:8445;450;i always advise that a person should watch The Best Years with someone they love and to hold them tight if only for a brief moment.
I:8445;451;This movie really touches the heart, although it is in black and white and I would love to see a colorized version of it it is worth seeing over and over.
I:8445;452;The story line is great, the actors are actors who fit and it shows about our history and the vets that we can't forget.
I:8445;453;This is a movie that has a lesson about humanity and who we should be in this world.
I:8445;454;the inclusion of an actor who really suffered injuries during the war makes it all the more authentic and relevant.
I:8445;455;it stands up very well for a sixty year old film.
I:8445;456;Real people with real problems and feelings.
I:8445;457;A truly great and classic and respectful film.
I:8445;458;Anything longer is an epic and it better be about extraordinary men and women living extraordinary lives, preferably, against the backdrop of a particularly tumultuous historical era.
I:8445;459;enterring civilian life somehow manages to tell the tale of ordinary men and women in the years after an extraordinary historical era and to keep the viewer engrossed throughout its entire 172 minutes.
I:8445;460;from a 21st century perspective, the readjustment of a middle aged vet seems potentially as interesting a storyline as that of his younger comrades in arms.
I:8445;461;nowadays, with material this rich, they'd make a mini.
I:8445;462;That wasn't an option back then, and thank goodness for it.
I:8445;463;BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES works best as a leisurely paced work of cinema.
I:8445;464;Contemporary viewers may actually be surprised to see so many post.
I:8445;465;There was plenty of that, to be sure, but the best film of 1946 (both in the opinion of many critics and of voters of Academy) was a film that bravely grappled with the issues of the day.
I:8445;466;This was an especially good Best Picture winner.
I:8445;467;But boy was it good.
I:8445;468;This is one of the greatest WWII films ever made, and it's a really moving, deeply human story about war and its aftermath.
I:8445;469;Despite it being made in 1946, the film still holds it power today.
I:8445;470;It also has a rather frank (especially for this country) and honest depiction of adultery (one of the main characters is married to a gold diggin' b****, and another woman desperately wants the man to break up with her so she can enjoy him).
I:8445;471;It also has one of the greatest wedding scenes in movie history, taking up nearly 30 minutes at the end of the film.
I:8445;472;The scene is incredibly moving, and there isn't one ounce of forced sentimentality.
I:8445;473;It's incredibly honest and deeply moving.
I:8445;474;All of the performers are wonderful, and William Wyler shows why he was one of Hollywood's greatest directors.
I:8445;475;A masterpiece from the old Hollywood masters.
I:8445;476;Sorry to have to write this report on such a fine classic as The Best Years of Our Lives.
I:8445;477;Interesting movie about the period right after the end of world war 2.
I:8445;478;Movies like this from the golden age of Hollywood dealt with the human condition, real characters, real human emotions.
I:8445;479;They transcend time and provoke thought and deep reflection from the viewer.
I:8445;480;The result is a classic.
I:8445;481;This flim is one of the greatest all time flims.
I:8445;482;the lineup of these great stars made this flim what it is.
I:8445;483;It's filled with real love and romance.
I:8445;484;it takes me back to memory lane.
I:8445;485;WWII veterans return home to fine a difference in their lives.
I:8445;486;Best Years of Our Lives is an excellent movie.
I:8445;487;But he has a great loving family and Wilma is a swell girl so apart from his own demons he has nothing to worry about.
I:8445;488;Homer is a nice character, he is a goodhearted and easygoing fellow loved by his family, always ready to see the bright side of things and when he permits himself to love Wilma he gets what he wished for when talking with Fred and Al on the plane home.
I:8445;489;Al (Fredric March) has a perfect wife, a perfect daughter and a perfect son, he has enough money to get what he wants, and a good job yet he does not seem happy.
I:8445;490;his job, his wife and his new love.
I:8445;491;acts and his performance rings true.
I:8445;492;great movie, one of the best.
I:8445;493;Seen today it still resonates.
I:8445;494;One of the best movies ever made.
I:8445;495;Also one of the best war movies ever made, I would watch it again.
I:8445;496;It was a wonderful story about returning soldiers from the war and what happened to them when they came back.
I:8445;497;Great movie highlighting the lives of three returning WWII veterans and their readjustment to society.
I:8445;498;It seem's to be somewhat realistic, but with a wonderful romantic aspect that Hollywood probably had to have.
I:8445;499;that is the kind of character that an enduring life is built on.
I:8445;500;One of the best movies of all time.
I:8445;501;I especially liked the fact a real Navy veteran (Homer) was cast in the part and actually showed the way he had to adjust without any hands.
I:8445;502;Considering the impact that The Best Years of Our Lives retains today, I can only imagine the powerful impact the film must have had on audiences when it was released just after the war.
I:8445;503;It's a very honest look at the difficulties and adjustments facing both soldiers and their loved ones when they return home after experiencing the horrors of war and death.
I:8445;504;Fredric March must reconnect with his wife and job, and finds comfort with the bottle.
I:8445;505;There are too many great scenes to recount.
I:8445;506;Myrna Loy is at her best as March's patient wife.
I:8445;507;Teresa Wright, one of the best and most reliable of the actresses of the Forties is excellent as Loy and March's daughter who falls in love with Andrews.
I:8445;508;Dana Andrews gives his greatest performance, and Harold Russell is unforgettable as the soldier with the biggest obstacle to overcome.
I:8445;509;William Wyler scores again with another mature, expertly acted, dramatically charged film that reminds us about the power of moviemaking.
I:8445;510;The Best Years of our Lives is a very eye.
I:8445;511;each man returns to a family and a romantic interest.
I:8445;512;various issues facing the return of veterans are brought to the foreground in this film.
I:8445;513;except that this film is well over 2.1/2 hours in length, this is a good film overall.
I:8445;514;This is certainly not a Citizen Kane, but is still a good example of 1940s Hollywood filmmaking.
I:8445;515;the film deserves the full Criterion treatment, and we can only hope they will eventually turn their attention to this wise and extremely moving film.
I:8445;516;Until then, I advise avoiding the MGM disc and recommend the superior product from HBO . . . if you can find it.
I:8445;517;This is in my opinion the Great American Movie, three vets returning from the war trying to return to their pre.
I:8445;518;I love everything about this flim great stars.
I:8445;519;Wonderful story lines,just the right amount of time not to long or to short no loose ends Harold Russell is just great.
I:8445;520;Incorporating his own experiences as a combat filmographer into the film, Wyler made what is arguable his most successful film with The Best Years of Our Lives.
I:8445;521;After it's release it went on to win 7 Academy Awards beating out It's a Wonderful Life for Best Picture, and Harold Russell won not just one but two Academy Awards (one for Best Supporting Actor, and an honorary award """"For bringing hope and courage to his fellow veterans through his appearance""""), the only actor to ever win two Academy Awards for the same performance."""
522;the Best Years of Our Lives is a film that has a lot of pertinence in today's world with so many troops overseas making their way back, and it's still the best film on the subject.
523;Wyler's attention to detail, choosing not to make things over lavish as most films in the 1940's did, and to give it more of a documentary flair help give the film more of a real world feel.
524;And while the subject matter might seem like the film would be a darker affair, there are moments that would still make you genuinely laugh out loud, as well as other lighter more tender moments.
525;the acting is superb from all involved.
526;Al Stevenson, also does a superb job as a former sergeant who feels guilty for having come home to find himself a good job while also dealing with family issues and his feelings toward having to away loans for former GI's who feel they deserve better.
527;i highly recommend this movie, this is one of those rare perfect movies and to be honest, it deserved it's best picture nod over It's A Wonderful Life.
528;If you like films dealing with WWII, great dramas, and superb acting, you should definitely give this film a shot.5/5
529;The product arrived in a timely fashion, and even though it was used, it was in great condition.
530;A timeless classic, also a good reminder of what was sacrificed for us and our way of life.
531;It is truly one of the best.
532;I watch it as often as I can and share it with friends and when I have company over to visit.
533;As a history buff on the second world war, and an aviator too, i found this movie to be very educational.
534;The character adds absolutely nothing to the film.
535;He is on screen, then.
536;I shall the next time I view the film.
537;But, if you have seen it, preferably many times, try this: watch all 3 hours of this brilliant film with the volume turned DOWN!
538;That will be a true testament to how good this film is.
539;A pivotal reflection of America as it came to power in the American Century directed by the greatest sound director in Hollywood.
540;Without trying to be sappy or use too many superlatives, this is a very special and moving movie.

542;With extraordinary acting from a top notch Hollywood cast of the 40's (including Myrna Loy and Theresa Wright .
543;who is fabulous in her part) .
544;a terrific script, and great direction, The Best Years.
545;may in fact be one of Hollywood's best of all time.
546;It still moves me to tears in parts, and touches me deeply.
547;I also find Dana Andrews' portrayal of what we now refer to as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder to be very realistic, very believable and extremely moving.
548;This film by William Wyler is a keeper.
549;one worth watching every now and then because of its craftsmanship, story, and acting.
550;The movie itself deserves at least five stars: the wonderful acting of the greatest stars of the forties (Dana Andrews, Fredric March, Myrna Loy, Teresa Wright, etc.), the unforgettable performance by a real war veteran (Harold Russell),the groundbreaking cinematography by Gregg Toland, etc.,etc.
551;Each character is subtly drawn under William Wyler's expert direction, evoking the complex challenges that confront veterans of all ranks .
552;making sense of their own war experiences while readjusting to a changed America.
553;winner for Best Picture, Best Actor (March) and Best Supporting Actor (Russell, an amputee veteran).
554;you will love this movie.
555;This is about the 10th time we watched this wonderful Wyler directed flick.
556;While dated by today's moral standards (oh, please give me more of yesterday''s moral standards), the characters are believable and the acting, even by those who are not professional Hollywood types like Homer (real life soldier hero Harold Russel) is superb.
557;My wife and I are always in tears at some point.
558;Regardless of your political persuasion or personal experience with the period (my dad was in WWII), you will treasure this wonderful story.
559;Actually captures the mindset of America towards returning vets from WW2.
560;Acting is awesome, and the handicap soldier segments are very real.
561;The service on this was excellent .
562;A real gem and a great depiction of America.
563;Well worth your time in viewing.
564;This movie is wonderfully romantic in the sense of what real love is all about.
565;How can it be good.
566;The story is warm, deep and meaningful.
567;These are the kind of friends we wish we had.
568;This is one of the greatest movies of all time.
569;Deeply touching, and a wonderful trip with America's greatest generation.
570;This is a story that lets you know what it was like in the post war years with a great heart warming story.
571;One of the best films made in the last 60 years.
572;Beautifully woven story about the importance of human bonding to help us through the best and worst of times.
573;In every character, one can relate to feelings, regardless of age, gender and era.
574;This is a wonderfull film done in 1946.
575;The theme is still relevent in our modern society.
576;Its caracters are found in the still hurting Vietnam Veterans and will be found in the ones returning from our fighting in Afganistan and Iraq.
577;This film should be required viewing with all our mental health workers , bankers, and police force.
578;This is a tour de force in film making!
579;Great acting, great love story, I've watched it numerous times over the years.

582;this movie is a classic which everyone should see at least once.
583;Always a pleasure to watch this movie that contains an excellent cast and a wonderful storyline.
584;Very refreshing to watch a movie with a continually relevant story with no special effects other than good acting.
585;This has been, and still is, one of the best movies I have ever seen.
586;Wonderfully acted, it carries a timeless impact.
587;A nostalgic view of an America that has changed over the years, but also of fundamental emotions that remain timeless.
588;A must see and own.
589;This film is one of my all time favorites .

618;I enjoy old movies and had this one on VCR tape.
619;It's one of a few movies I watch once or twice a year (usually as a double feature on 4th of July when I watch it with Independence Day!)
620;"Great acting, great storyline, good example of what returning veterans of all wars face
I:8445;621;This deeply moving, beautifully written and performed film, was a long.
I:8445;622;planned tribute by director William Wyler to veterans of World War II, whose heroic service Wyler witnessed first.
I:8445;623;The Best Years of Our Lives is the fulfillment of Wyler's promise.
I:8445;624;Released in 1947, the film won seven Oscars (it was nominated for eight) including Best Picture and Best Director.

I:8445;628;Homer realizes that Wilma truly loves him and tells her that he has always loved her and will never love anyone else.
I:8445;629;In another wonderful scene, the disrupted relationship between Al and his wife moves into calmer waters as they relate to the confused Peggy the emotional hardhips of the early years of their marriage, and how they moved forward, anyway, committed to their lives together as a family.
I:8445;630;The Best Years of Our Lives is a long film, nearly three hours, but is worth every moment of your time as Wyler, whose love for his protagonists shows in every frame, portrays their shifting relationships and the adjustment both they and America make as they move into the new environment of post.
I:8445;631;the performances are sensitive and heart.
I:8445;632;While clearly the work of an amateur, his (wisely) unadorned performance works well and garnered a Best Supporting Actor Oscar.

640;that issue aside, my respect and affection for this exceptional film has remained undimmed over the years.
641;Okay, so you've seen Saving Private Ryan, now it's time to see the film that should follow it.
642;Light years ahead of such similiar films as Coming Home, and The Deerhunter, this is the film that took the acadamy award for best picture away from It's A Wonderful Life, and would still do so today.
643;An incredable cast gives the performances of their lives, fully depicing the feelings and problems faced by America's returning WWII veterans.

I:8445;647;Higly recommend revisiting it if anyway hasn't watched it in a while.
I:8445;648;Very pleased with this seller.
I:8445;649;To begin with the cast is outstanding.
I:8445;650;The movie touches your heart in so many ways.
I:8445;651;It's a wonderful movie and the music score is great too.
I:8445;652;harold Russell great actors and deserves the TWO Oscars.
I:8445;653;This epic should be required viewing for all US Citizens, as it is one of the truest portraits ever made of the immediate Post World War 2 America.
I:8445;654;a truly worthy Oscar Winner!
I:8445;655;Very good old war movie (although there was no war scenes) with good acting and excellent plot.
I:8445;656;This is a older movie that is a favorite of my brother in law.
I:8445;657;A classic feel good movie that you don't get anymore.
I:8445;658;Sit back, relax and enjoy.
I:8445;659;Having been born in the 30s and knowing many war veterans, we can imagine quite clearly the emotion this film evoked in 1948 upon returning vets and those who waited for them.
I:8445;660;We thought the acting and directing were excellent for the most part.
I:8445;661;Just like you, in many conversations I'm often asked what my favorite movie of all time is?
I:8445;662;but without a pause, doubt or breath I always reply """"The Best Years of Our Lives""""."""
663;william Wyler's epic deals with the assimilation of 3 main characters into the new America at the end of World War II.
664;The entire cast is exceptional including Hoagie Carmichael.
665;this movie is as poignant and important today as it was 60+ years ago.
666;background info on main characters, as well as familial connections, made the story very real.
667;Will undoubtedly see itagain and recommend it to friends.
668;This story kept our older children's (ages 9.18) attention and was a good history lesson a well.
669;Glad to have been able to see this slice of history.
670;My Father told me about this movie when I was young, when I got A little older and seen it for the first time, I thought it was great.
671;This movie is applicable to today's returning vets and treats both the veterans and their families with compassion as they all seek ways to deal with the effects of war and to regain normalcy.
672;The movie honestly and sensitively addresses the challenges of postwar reassimilation.
673;Touching movie, still relevant 60+ years later, and well received by today's younger audiences.
674;Frederic March looks a little old to have been a sergeant, Dana Andrews has a bad case of PTSD from his bombing missions, and Harrold Russell, a real life double amputee veteran, delivers the most convincing performance.
675;all 3 have family, neighbors, colleagues, and friends who don't really understand what they went through in Europe and the Pacific.
676;He's been married twenty years to his wife and is a well.
677;He's from a shanty on the wrong side of the tracks, and he got married after a whirlwind romance while on furlough.
678;He brings great depth to his role, beautifully giving us awkwardness and passion mixed together in his early scenes with Loy as they spend their first day morning together post war.
679;"Homer has the scenes with emotional wallop: his homecoming, when his mother's hand flies to her mouth as she first sees his hooks as he waves goodbye to the other men in the cab
I:8445;680;A fundamentally honest work, The Best Years of Our Lives details the anxiety of veterans at drift back on the homefront.
I:8445;681;It's a powerful movie which pays tribute to the men and the sacrifices they made.
I:8445;682;He deserved every ounce of his two .
I:8445;683;Oscars that he received for this role.
I:8445;684;He is amazing to watch.
I:8445;685;Then I shared with them some of the other things Russell had accomplished in his life .
I:8445;686;I love that I could watch the movie at my pace.
I:8445;687;The Best Years of Our Lives is a powerful look into how three soldiers returning from WWII deal with their new lives.
I:8445;688;As it came out in 1946, right when this was happening, it was quite timely, and helped audiences realize just what was going on around them.

I:8445;691;next is the solid, older family man with a wife and two kids.
I:8445;692;The actor who plays him was in fact a vet who lost both hands, which makes the scenes with him quite powerful and compelling.
I:8445;693;He really has dealt with what is being described.
I:8445;694;The girlfriend of the navy man adores him with all her heart.
I:8445;695;She wants to be by his side.
I:8445;696;so many classic movies have a nearly all male cast, and it might have been accepted here since the movie is about war's aftermaths.
I:8445;697;But the writers created a fantastic screenplay which won an Oscar"
698;mothers, wives, girlfriends, daughters .
699;were intricately affected as well.
700;But there's a lot of powerful discussion here, and the messages are just as powerful in modern times as they were then.
701;This is a beautiful film.
702;The pacing of the film is relaxing, allowing for ample character development.
703;The viewer is willingly drawn into the film by such methods as real town street scenes taken from the taxi window as the men share their first ride home after years of being away and also by the use of a non.
704;professional actor as one of the main characters.
705;Took a chance on watching this and now understand how great this movie is.
706;Worth watching about a time of greatness in this country.
707;beautiful story, haven't reviewed it lately because of business I will try to get to reviewing it soon maybe after holidays
708;wins: Black and White Cinematography and Black and White Set Design.
709;I bought The Best Years of Our Lives mainly because I was curious about what on earth could possibly have beaten out It's a Wonderful Life for Best Picture, Director (William Wyler) and especially Leading Actor.
710;(James Stewart) That being said I was pleasantly surprised to see a good, solidly acted, fairly well.
711;written and extremely well photographed (same photographer as Citizen Kane so that should tell you something) film.
712;It works well in the serious scenes like when he's confronting Fred in the caf for flirting with his daughter Peggy but in other scenes like when he's celebrating his return or making a speech at a dinner party it looks a little strange.
713;His subtle facial expressions (when he smiles and frowns and cries) look very real.
714;Cathy O'Donnell is okay as his girlfriend.
715;plus the movie does a very good job teaching a lesson that marriage isn't just about the mushy.
716;probably the best parts were:1.
717;Their romance was so sweet and beautifully handled and the wedding scene was terrific.2.
718;"Milly looks up at Al with a grin and says ""Oh yeah."
719;Gregg Toland's cinematography is REALLY good.
720;The best parts are the spacious shots of the town and city and the beginning where the three soldiers are looking out of the round windows in the airplane.
721;Hugo Friedhofer's music is rich, lush and dramatic especially the scene where Fred goes to the broken airplane junkyard and Homer and Wilma's second scene in his bedroom.
722;i still think It's a Wonderful Life should have won the major Oscars that year (Picture, Director and Leading Actor) but The Best Years of Our Lives is still good in its own way.
723;americans can watch this film without gritting their teeth.
724;and the flick got a zillion Oscars.
725;Hollywood felt good about itself.
726;My favorite movie of all time.
727;The movie was in perfect condition and came long before it's expected arrival date.
728;One of those movies you can watch over and over again.
729;This is one of my husband and my favorite movies.
730;We can watch it quite often and still love it!
731;This is a movie for Men, Women, veterans, non.
732;veterans, anyone that has a heart.
733;A single story woven about a trilogy of returning veterans that is as true today as it was when this was made after WWII.
734;now guys, don't get turned off by the following statement, this movie demonstrates the power of love for these three brave veterans in coping with the difficulties of returning home and how much we need the emotional strength and love of women to pull us through.
735;a truly great movie still relevant today.
736;A must see movie, just make sure you have plenty of kleenex available.
737;i highly recommend this movie to everyone.
738;But even among mid twentieth century films, this one is superlative.
739;three men, unknown to each other in their previous lives, return home to the same town.
740;"Their lives are now intertwined because they share a common experience
I:8445;741;For me, the scene in which Fred deals with his demons in the shell of an old grounded bomber accompanied by a tortured musical score as the camera moves up slowly behind him was one of the great cinematic moments of an already excellent film.
I:8445;742;this has always been a must see when it came on tv.
I:8445;743;it's nice more movies like this are available on amazon.
I:8445;744;One of the best movies ever made.
I:8445;745;The cast is terrific and the story resonates as much today as it did in 1946
I:8445;746;I think this is a poignant story about the adjustments veterans face when returning home.
I:8445;747;A wonderful and powerful film highlighting the struggles and ultimately the joys of 3 returning WWII vets and their families.
I:8445;748;Great performances all around from top notch stars Frederic March, Dana Andrews, and real life injured veteran Harold Russell.
I:8445;749;Supporting cast members Myrna Loy, Theresa Wright and Hoagy Carmichael round out the magnificent talents joined together in this timeless tale of the human saga overcoming dfficult circumstances.
I:8445;750;The first movie to honestly deal with troops returning from war (WW II).
I:8445;751;The Best Years of our Lives is a """"Wartme"""" classic set in an eponymous Midwestern town immediately after WW2."""
752;"March has the most nuanced role, since he is an ""old married man"" with a wife and kids."
753;His wife, Myrna Loy, is strong and faithful.
754;She will have to be!
755;March has a painfully obvious struggle with the bottle and is a lucky man to have such a great boss and patient wife!
756;"She is ""good girl"" Teresa Wright."
757;The most interesting role is Russell's.
758;Wounded in real life when his aircraft carrier was attacked, he was discovered by Director William Wyler at a War Bond rally.
759;The most touching moment in BY is when Russell shows fianc e Cathy O' Donnell how is hand hooks work.
760;BY swept the 1946 Academy Awards winning Best Picture, Director (Wyler), Best Actor (March), Best Supporting Actor (Russell), Best Screenplay, and Best Dramatic Score.
761;"Russell was also given a Special Award for ""bringing hope and courage to his fellow veterans""."
762;Both quietly played their roles to perfection, especially Loy in dealing with a hard husband struggling to settle down.
763;"Credit goes to Mike Mayo's ""War Movies"" for that observation and the background on Mr. Russell."
764;It captures the way we were in a very special time in this country's history.
765;The beauty of video is that one can watch over 2 or 3 sittings.
766;"We all like ""happy endings"" but please!"
767;I love this movie, it is a must see for anyone who is in the military or is a military family member.
768;This is the real message of this great post.
769;The film content is dated but very good.
770;I love old films and this is one of the best.
771;Thanks for aquick delivery at a good price.
772;But, it was so well made that every human emotion comes through the screen even now.
773;This film is one of my favorites and stands the test of time.
774;It's good to know that it was appreciated when it was released, over 60 years ago, winning so many Oscars.
775;A great and moving story (it's schmatlz only adds to it).
776;For the most part it's very well acted too, creating great sympathy for the characters.
777;the plot is well described elsewhere here, but there were several things in it I found very interesting pieces of social history.
778;Without a shred of doubt World War II has become one of the perennial subjects of the modern mega.
779;Within the last three decades the Motion Picture Association has rewarded numerous films which relate to the Second World War with the recognition of either being nominated for or winning a golden statuette, among those include The Last Emperor, Patton, The English Patient, and Saving Private Ryan, directed by Steven Spielberg who also helmed the Academy Award.
780;In spite of losing out on Best Picture to Shakespeare in Love, Spielberg enthusiasm for the subject of World War II gave rise to the HBO mini.
781;series, Band of Brothers, which he produced along with Tom Hanks, garnering numerous Emmy awards in its wake.
782;director Quentin Tarantino, the man behind such classics as Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, will be getting into the act with his next film, Inglorious Bastards.
783;the story for The Best Years of Our Lives, with its flagrantly honest dialogue and emotionally gripping situations, stands out prominently amongst other films of the war genre, both today and the time period in which it was released.
784;It is more like that at least a portion of the film's production, script.
785;fredric March undoubtedly steals the spotlight away, for at least the first one.
786;dana Andrews provides an admirable performance in the role of Fred Derry, a fighter.
787;It would be rash as to associate the intentions of the screenwriters with the assumptions picked up in the film, it is certainly intriguing to consider.
788;easily one of the most heralding performances in the film is given by Harold Russell, a real life veteran of World War II who lost his hands in the service of his country, for his role as Homer Parrish, a man returning home from war to face the trials of his new condition which await him upon being reunited with his loved ones.
789;In having an actual serviceman of the Second World War fill into the role of the most gripping and emotionally demanding performances in the film, as far as the audience is concerned, benefits both the picture as a whole as well as the actor who portrays him.
790;It would be quite intriguing, not to mention invaluable to the audiences watching this film, to discover how much of Homer Parrish's dialogue or actions throughout the picture were scripted or were improvised by Russell, a person who would clearly have more to express within the role far beyond anything the screenwriters could ever dictate for him.
791;"star power, glitz, glamour, that certain ""movie magic"" ."
792;"colored"" approach to the sensitive material presented."
793;The cinematography is positively breathtaking, the performances conducted by a group of nearly unknown actors and actresses are brilliantly superb, the dialogue is insightful and expressive, and its message of optimism and hope in the eyes of the returning war veteran truly stands the test of time, as relevant today as it was back then.
794;"It may have been ""Saving Private Ryan"" that brought that generation's struggles to the forefront of their children's and grandchildren's minds
I:8445;795;The Best Years of Our Lives.
I:8445;796;directed by William Wyler, that sanest and most humane of directors.
I:8445;797;Al (Fredric March), the sergeant, is a well.
I:8445;798;Most poignant of all is Homer, a young sailor who lost his hands in combat.
I:8445;799;Homer is played by Harold Russell, a real.
I:8445;800;there immediacy that is truly heartrending.
I:8445;801;(The look on Loy's face when she first sees her husband home safely makes for one of the most moving scenes in all American cinema.)
I:8445;802;This film won seven Oscars and deserved every last one of them, including Best Picture, Best Director for Wyler, Best Actor for March and Best Supporting Actor for Russell.
I:8445;803;It is amazing that so measured and insightful a film about the plight of returning GIs could have been filmed so soon after the war"
804;Great review (of course .
805;this is one of my all time favorite movies).
806;Great period piece incredible acting couldn't take my eyes off the screen.
807;Good depiction of the experience of servicemen returning home from WW2.
808;This movie won 8 Academy Awards and is one of the best I've ever seen.
809;Each experiences his own hardships and trials and in the process we, as viewers, are asked to contemplate our cultural values and are reminded of the power of love and friendship.
810;Stick with it, though, and whether you are young (I first saw this as a teenager and loved it) or old, you won't be disappointed.
811;poignant story about three WWII veterans coming back home and adjusting.
812;some of the best heart wrenching scenes I have ever seen.
813;This is a truely memorable film.
814;william Wyler was a master at his craft.
815;And he had the ability to get a great cast together.
816;This film showcases them all.
817;fredric March won his second Oscar as a vetran returning home.
818;He adds depth and passion to his charachter.
819;She creates her own character while adding dimensions to her husband.
820;Her performace as the daughter, had a fine line to walk and she did it to perfection.
821;He truely deserved his Best Supporting Actor Oscar.
822;in the end, you will be moved by this portrait of soldiers returning home after The Great War.
823;This is a very good movie, and in very good condition.
824;The actors in this movie are all just perfect in their roles.
825;Unlike today, this is one movie that will be forever a great classic.
826;Enough to keep you interested in it through the entire movie.
827;Dana Andrews is wonderful, as always, but so are all the other actors.
828;It was fun to watch but a typical old movie of its day.
829;I always found that in the early days of movies that they over.
830;emotional and natural film even after 15 years.
831;Maybe the best drama I have ever watched.
832;This was a good movie and made us think of how hard it is sometimes for our service men and women to readjust after having to be gone for sometime.
833;I liked it a lot.
834;Love the raw and honest emotions.
835;Love the clothes and authenticity of the era.
836;What a wonderful movie, and for grandchildren of WW2 vets like me, it was a very moving depiction of what coming home from the war must have been like, and getting readjusted to family life after being gone for years.
837;It was so worth spending an afternoon going back in time like that and will definitely watch this again and again.
838;The Best Years of Our Lives is an Oscar winning picture that, at the height of the dream factory in Hollywood, stooped to strip away the pretensions of glamor and expose the sad, sobering truth that faced returning soldiers after WWII.
839;Their journey from war front to home front is poignant, heart.
840;breaking, yet ultimately, life affirming.
841;This remains one of March's and Andrews' shining moments.
842;Loy is also very good, though, truth be told, not her very best performance.
843;Really enjoyed all the characters and their interactions after a war.
844;Historical importance, and the last great collaboration between Wyler and photog Gregg Toland.
845;"The Bottom Line:An affecting and touching story or three soldiers returning from WWII to a country that has changed profoundly since they've been gone, The Best Years of our lives has lost little of its power over the years
I:8445;846;A reminder to all to welcome vets home and help them feel whole again .
I:8445;847;It received an Academy Award for best picture.
I:8445;848;Fine performances by an all cast.
I:8445;849;This is a great movie .
I:8445;850;This was one of the best movies I've ever seen.
I:8445;851;A wonderful movie with no profanityin it and clearly taken from life the way it was years ago.
I:8445;852;Old movie with good ending .
I:8445;853;The Best Years of Our Lives is an excellent movie about three WWII soldiers returning to the same hometown after the war.
I:8445;854;Character development is very good.
I:8445;855;With 99% of America oblivious to the fact our nation continues to be at war for 23 long losing years in Afghanistan and Iraq, this movie provides timeless insight into the reality of World War II veterans returning home from war.
I:8445;856;Loved the focus of veterans returning home and what they may face.
I:8445;857;Recommend it to all my friends.
I:8445;858;This is without doubt the finest Example of American Thinking Cinema.
I:8445;859;one from the army, one from the air force, and yes another from the navy.
I:8445;860;The film explores just about every facet of the returning veteran: How tables can be turned from what you did during the war to what you return to in civilian life .
I:8445;861;the cast is excellent .
I:8445;862;The music is overly sweet and intrusive but overall """"The Best Years of Our Lives"""" captures the cynical post."""
863;wWII mood nicely and still resonates many years later.
864;reflects the optimism of the time.
865;The story it tells is as poignant and relevant today as when the film was released.
866;The film will help remind people of the trials faced by all veterans, from the Second World War to the present in adjusting to civilian life.
867;"The great director Billy Wilder, who once quipped that he could laugh during ""Hamlet,"" marveled at how he found himself bawling shamelessly at one of the earliest scenes in this movie."
868;And legendary actress Bette Davis called this the best movie ever made in Hollywood.
869;"office blockbuster in 1946, easily eclipsing ""It's a Wonderful Life."""
870;But director William Wyler managed to transcend those weaknesses and evoke deeply felt sentiments without seeming manipulative or cloying.
871;Virginia Mayo is wonderful as a lively and decidedly unsympathetic wife.
872;She gives the movie a lot of its energy.
873;Hugo Friedhofer wrote the deeply evocative music score.
874;Harold Russell, a real WWII veteran who lost both his hands while in the military, and in his first acting roll in a major motion picture, won an academy award for his portrayal of the character Homer Parish .
875;he did a great job in the roll.
876;Frederic March, Myrna Loy Dana Andrews, Teresa Wright, and Virginia Mayo are all excellent as well, and Hoagy Carmichael also makes an appearance in this film.
877;Charming, funny, poignant, this film is everything you expect from 1950's Hollywood but without the formulaic dialogue and tired plot lines.
878;I often recommend this film to buffs if they have not seen it.
879;Nostalgic movie that brought back my earliest childhood post.
880;No surprises here, but an enjoyable look back.
881;Best Picture winner still holds up well and is relevant to soldiers coming home in the 21st Century.
882;would recommend this to anyone who has friends or relatives who have served in the armed forces.
883;This movie tell a great story of how military people adjust to returning to civilian life and the reactions of those at home.
884;It gives good insight into the life of a handicaped person.
885;The men who served overseas in the war came home to a hero's welcome and seemed to have the world at their feet.
886;The Best Years of Our Lives examines how three men from a small Midwestern town deal with returning home from the war.
887;Dana Andrews is a dashing bombardier who at home is reduced to working as a soda jerk and whose wife parties all the time and lives beyond their means.
888;rah, war is a great and happy experience film, the movie shows the dark side and ill effects war has on people.
889;It is a powerful and moving film that still resonates over a half century later.
890;The film walked away with seven Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Director for the legendary William Wyler, Best Actor for Mr. March and two Oscars for Mr. Russell, one for Supporting actor and a special award for the role, thus becoming the only person to win two awards for the same role in the same year.
891;I can honestly say that I've watched this film many times in my life.
892;It is a great reminder that America is a fine and decent country built by Faith, Hope and hard work.
893;Every one of us have difficulties to face, but we also have the freedom to choose how we respond to the hard blows of life.
894;This story is about perseverance and taking the moral high road.
895;Although this movie was made in 1946, it is still fresh, real, and deeply moving today.
896;Surely the men and now, women, who are returning from Iraq and Afghanistan will each have their own stories.
897;william Wyler must have been a terrific director for actors because he got such spontaneous, naturalistic moments from this cast.
898;each one gives a deeply moving performance.
899;Myrna Loy is so charming and at once sophisticated and sweet, tender and tough.
900;She makes you think about what the wives who were left at home to raise their children alone had to cope with.
901;I knew nothing of him, if he was a real amputee, a professional actor, or what, until I read the reviews.
902;He has an amazingly open, beautiful face and the sunniest smile you'll ever want to see.
903;The marriage scene which shows each detail of the hands, clasping each other, giving the ring, brought tears to my eyes!Dana Andrews is great as the young, carefree, ex.
904;Frederick March is wonderful, too, as the ex.
905;Virgina Mayo is gorgous and certainly convincing as the girl who just wants to have fun.
906;i really enjoyed the appearance of Hoagy Carmichael, a very cool guy, who gives additional class to this film.
907;it plays for three hours and I was glued to the screen for the entire time.
908;As a snapshot of a moment in America's history and as a universal human picture, it has great value.
909;Technology changes but human emotions are always the same.
910;Gen X and Gen Y could learn a lot from this insightful classic.
911;Every now and then a book or a movie appears that tells the story of a whole generation.
912;Russell was, himself, a returning disabled vet and he won a special Oscar for his inspiring preformance.
913;The young sailor comes home to his high school sweetheart.
914;She knows that this is not the boy who left her.
915;She is ready to love the man who returned in his place if she can figure out who he is.
916;The power of this movie is seeing them struggle with the question.
917;The way they they and the vast majority of US servicemen ultimately answered the question was what made America the greatest country in the world.
918;Good reminder of the challenges the greatest generation had coming home after WWII.
919;as a snapshot of America immediately after the end of World War II, it is valuable.
920;"You see characters deal with renewing ties with family they hadn't seen in years
I:8445;921;From the background music to the cadence of the actors' voices, this is what a great movie in 1946 sounded like.
I:8445;922;From the smiling faces superimposed over neon night club signs to the deep, dark fades between scenes, this is what a great movie in 1946 looked like.
I:8445;923;The movie is more enjoyable as a piece of American history than as an entertaining film.
I:8445;924;The fact that Russell truly was a veteran who had lost both hands during the war brings life to the role.
I:8445;925;His is the most interesting part of the story, because you feel this must have been exactly what it was like for Russell.
I:8445;926;The second was well deserved.
I:8445;927;the other actors in significant roles are fine.
I:8445;928;It worked then, and works now if you have a taste for the nostalgic.
I:8445;929;thought, and the tone of his voice leads you to feel he is about to say something more.
I:8445;930;The dialogue could be improved, be made more realistic.
I:8445;931;this is a movie worth seeing, but a story worth re.
I:8445;932;One of the best movies I've ever seen.
I:8445;933;The cast is brilliant and some scenes are so touching.
I:8445;934;Really enjoyed the character study.
I:8445;935;As a fan of classic black/white movies, this one rates right up there as one of the best!
I:8445;936;It's a long movie with lots of depth, character study, and interwoven stories.
I:8445;937;the script is very clever, honest, and beautifully written.
I:8445;938;this movie won 7 Oscars in 1947 for Best Movie, Best Director, Best Actor (Frederic March), Best Actor in Supporting Role (Harold Russell), Best Screenplay, etc. the acting is incredible because the story being told is incredible.
I:8445;939;watch this moving around Memorial Day because even now, in 2014, it is so relevant and makes one appreciate the wonderful country we live in.
I:8445;940;It is a poignant stpru that is very well don.
I:8445;941;I bought this movie based on reviews .
I:8445;942;How this fantastic movie ever escaped me I don't know.
I:8445;943;A great cast in telling an outstanding story.
I:8445;944;Every Academy award won was well deserved and probably should have wone more.
I:8445;945;my mom introduced this one to me a long time ago.
I:8445;946;I was very surprised to see a relationship between a girl and a married man included in a film made during an era where innocence was still reigning.
I:8445;947;I remember seeing this as a kid and catching bits and pieces.
I:8445;948;I wanted to see it all the way through and own it because to me it is a classic film.
I:8445;949;I really enjoyed this movie because my father was also a navigator / bombardier on a B.17 in WWII.
I:8445;950;This American masterpiece came as near perfection as popular art contrives to be, from its beautifully equivocal and suggestive title to the magnificent performance elicited by William Wyler from the nonprofessional amputee Harold Russell.
I:8445;951;the film epitomized both the dream and the reality of the postwar world.
I:8445;952;This intimate engagement with the psychological facts of American life gave it an almost universal audience.
I:8445;953;The picture's values are the values of the people in it.
I:8445;954;william Wyler, an outstanding director, triple winner of the best picture Oscar, adds an air of distinction to melodrama, epic and Westerns.
I:8445;955;With his distinguishing visual style and his taste for solemn material, he gained a reputation as a meticulous, serious artist.
I:8445;956;focus reveals the real commitment to emotional content.
I:8445;957;winner of 7 Academy Awards including Best Picture, """"The Best Years of Our Lives"""" is eloquent and compassionate, a deeply personal motion picture with touching wordless homecoming scenes:."""
958;"The first words of the sergeant's loving wife when he arrives home unexpectedly: ""I look terrible!"
959;"martini voice, Myrna Loy combines charmingly her wifely qualities with motherly ones
I:8445;960;making in the forties, with smiles and tears cunningly spaced and a film which says what is needed on a vital subject.
I:8445;961;along the way, I've rediscovered The Best Years of Our Lives.
I:8445;962;There aren't many like this gem!The Best Years of Our Lives is a great film!
I:8445;963;Reveals some of what soldiers face upon return to civilian life.
I:8445;964;Very appropriate for these times.
I:8445;965;I thoroughly love this movie, lost count on how many times I've seen it.
I:8445;966;One of my favorite moments is when Al asks the piano player to play Among my Suveniers and he and his wife dance to it.
I:8445;967;So funny because Al had way too much to drink and It brought back wonderful memories of my mother, as she played that song and many others like it on her little organ many years ago.
I:8445;968;Anyone who sees this for th first time will love it as it brings you right into the lives of those in the story and who could not love a movie about returning heroes of WWII.
I:8445;969;My dad was of this generation and in part, it's his story along with the millions of others who served this great nation during World War II.
I:8445;970;He turns in an amazing performance and if you look closely at the film, you can see photos of him when he was a high.
I:8445;971;The Academy got this one right!
I:8445;972;Superstar cast, terrific story line and heartwarming characters bring to life a real story of returning servicemen trying to readjust to civilian life.
I:8445;973;My father came home in 1946 from Europe and I can identify with all of the characters in this movie.
I:8445;974;The acting is fantastic and the storyline was so relivant to the postwar years.
I:8445;975;If you have ever served in the military, you will see much of yourself in this very moving tale of how three WWII veterans adjust to a post.
I:8445;976;Dana Andrews is magnificent as the Fred Derry, a one.
I:8445;977;Virginia Mayo is superb as his wife, who fell in love with his Army uniform but has no use for him now.
I:8445;978;Myrna Loy and Frederick March are excellent as a long time couple who deal squarely with his disinterest in his banking job and their daughter's emerging love for Fred.
I:8445;979;Theresa Wright is touching as the daughter of one veteran and the savior of another.
I:8445;980;This story of three men who return to small town America after fighting in the second world war, each man wounded in his own private way by the horrors he's faced, is filled with so many small heartbreaks.
I:8445;981;Yet somehow it manages to be incredibly hopeful.
I:8445;982;Gregg Toland's amazing deep focus cinematography fills each frame with visually interesting compositions that demand to be seen more than once to take in everything that's being shown.
I:8445;983;The performances are uniformly outstanding, keeping the movie from ever straying into sentimentality.
I:8445;984;This is a moving story of 3 servicemen coming home after WW II.
I:8445;985;The coming home is the great part.
I:8445;986;This is a good movie in the sense that it represents the time period very well.
I:8445;987;It also displays the issues that surround coming home from war.
I:8445;988;TBYOOL is a time capsule capturing the moment after World War II when millions of men and women returned home from the battlefields of Europe and Asia.
I:8445;989;screen writers knew more that one adjective to describe.
I:8445;990;The world changed as a result of WWII, and it directly affected many people's lives.
I:8445;991;The Best Years of Our Lives addresses the return home from war and the affects combat had on their daily lives.
I:8445;992;this film is a long and indepth look at the readjustment from a soldier's life to a civilian's life.
I:8445;993;The movie has romance, heartache, and comedy which makes it appealing to a variety of audiences.
I:8445;994;This is one of those movies that was obviously made to contend for the Oscars"
995;It features a talented cast and well.
996;written characters, and the direction is supurb.
997;One will recognize many scenes from various film compilations and homages.
998;Have viewed this and loved it throughout my lifetime.
999;It is a WWII classic along with Mrs. Minniver.
1000;and it continues to be relevant even now.
1001;films have changed alot through the years but this is still 1 of Hollywoods' best.
1002;It's a classic that should be seen by all movie lovers.
1003;As much as I love Capra's It's a Wonderful Life, I can have no regrets that virtually all of the academy awards for 1946 were given to Wyler's rather than Capra's film.
1004;navyman who had lost both hands in the war, was and remains one of the most brilliant calls in Hollywood history.
1005;Far from a period piece about WW II, the film remains a living treasure that should be required viewing for anyone interested in the power of cinema at its purest.
1006;The style of movie making may change but the message is timeless.
1007;Deservedly hailed as one of the finest American movie classics, this wonderful film continues to improve with the passage of time, and with each repeated viewing.
1008;Legendary director William Wyler assembled an extraordinary cast of players, all of whom deliver the performances of their careers.
1009;Robert Sherwood's screenplay, based on MacKinlay Kantor's beautiful novel.
1010;"prose, ""Glory for Me,"" is intelligently crafted and strikingly ahead of its time."
1011;From the heroic opening fanfare of Hugo Friedhofer's superb music score, to the final frame of this cinematic masterpiece, there is never a false moment in the dramatic narrative.
1012;Every scene is a pure gem!Honest, poetic, moving.
1013;"and profound, these ""Best Years"" will provide some of the best movie memories you will ever happily store and cherish."
1014;The Best Years of Our Lives is a film that seems to transcend time itself.
1015;This is one of the best films ever made.
1016;A rich ensemble cast and a compelling, touching story make this a film to treasure and invites repeated viewings, and it isn't hard to see why it won Best Picture in 1946 as well as a high mark on AFI's best films ever made.
1017;The film's central plot issue is how these three men are able to re.
1018;acquainted with his new wife, wonderfully played by Virginia Mayo, and finding a good job, as he was a soda.
1019;His best work is in this film and in the classic thriller, Laura.
1020;Fredric March is simply brilliant in this film and he justly earned an Oscar for this role.
1021;finally, there is Homer Parrish, played by real.
1022;life veteran with genuine touch and appeal by newcomer Harold Russell (the only actor in Oscar history to receive two Oscars for the same role!)
1023;Word has it that William Wyler was so impressed and touched by Harold's true.
1024;He finds a young woman with genuine feeling who cares deeply for him, especially when she's awaken one night by one of Fred's nightmares.
1025;Teresa Wright was one of those wonderful actresses with the perfect blend of beauty and sense of the girl next door.
1026;Her appeal was always in playing very sweet, down.
1027;al returns to a loving wife (Myrna Loy), Milly.
1028;hopping than in recapturing his romance with her.
1029;Even while intoxicated, Al ends up giving one of the most compelling speeches about the future of America.
1030;It finally takes a true touching situation for her to finally convince him of this truth.
1031;This is greatly amplified when he finally wraps his arms around her, and she nearly cries out with joy that he's finally done this.
1032;there have been several such films made throughout the history of Hollywood, but none have approached the touching and genuine feeling that this one does.
1033;"William Wyler is one of the best directors of all time, in my opinion, behind such classics as ""Mrs. Miniver"" and ""Ben."
1034;He has always done compelling and touching stories, and not many directors are able to combine these two elements so successfully.
1035;We find that for these three men, the best years of their lives are yet to come because they've overcome all of the odds of war and all of the odds of coming home.
1036;It is well worth watching.
1037;it is so nice to watch a GOOD movie for a change.
1038;and it is a true story
1039;I love this movie on so many levels.
1040;It realistically portrays the hardships and adjustments that I'm sure many men returning from WWII, or any war, for that matter, faced when returning to their home.
1041;integrated into their new lives.
1042;Superb acting from all cast members.
1043;Captures the mindset of post.
1044;Unforgettable performances and honest, non.
1045;The Best Years of Our Lives shows the best and the worst qualities in all of us.
1046;This is a well told story of three veterans who return from war.
1047;I really liked this movie and it is a timeless treasure in my opinion.
1048;A great movie, unfortunately it is butchered on Amazon because it is being shown in a wide screen aspect ratio and not in it's original square formate (ratio 1:133) meaning that Fredrick March looks like a fat boy.
1049;I've seen this film countless times, studied it in college, and yes, it's wonderful.
1050;Sometimes the studio system awes one with its ability to have everyone work together in harmony to create something unforgettable.
1051;The film is a towering masterpiece set in small town America (actually Cleveland) right after World War Two ends.
1052;Al has wife Milly (Myrna Loy) and two kids, while Homer has a family and sweet girl friend Wilma (Cathy O'Donnell).
1053;Hugo Friedhofer's legendary score also won a richly deserved trophy.
1054;It is a long film, 170 minutes, but beautifully paced and leisurely, capturing the slow tempo of a more quiet time.
1055;The performances are superb down to the bit roles.
1056;tHE BEST YEARS captures to perfection the way that returning veterans wanted their old jobs back.
1057;the movie has vignettes more than a strong plot.
1058;Backing everything are Gregg Toland's stunning deep focus photography and Hugo Friedhofer's magnificent music score.
1059;world War Two small town life was like.
1060;Unlike many old hits, though, BEST YEARS holds up remarkably well.
1061;The script is honest, and in its honesty avoids some obvious dramatic highpoints.
1062;for instance: infantry sergeant/civilian banker Frederic March returns to a wife he loves and two children who have grown into young adults in his absence.
1063;He gives his teenage son a Japanese flag and samurai sword, but the son is more interested in atomic energy and jet propulsion and whether the world is going to be blown to smithereens in the next war.
1064;frankly, I think this is a brilliant movie that is almost perfectly constructed.
1065;"Harold Russell, a real life war veteran who lost both hands in the war, won two Oscars in 1947 (the only time that's ever happened, by the way)
I:8445;1066;Russell is a very good natural actor, and the scene in which he shows his fiance, played by Cathy O'Donnell, how he has to prepare for bed that is as moving as anything I've ever seen.
I:8445;1067;There are very few movies which capture the drama of an entire generation.
I:8445;1068;Its graceful examination of three returning World War II veterans to small.
I:8445;1069;town America captures the essence of the """"Greatest Generation."""
1070;But the greatest performance (in my opinion) is from Harold Russell, a veteran and double.
1071;town football hero who seeks to cope with his handicap as well as his own insecurities.
1072;Mr. Russell won two Academy Awards, one honorary award for his inspiration to returning vets, and a Best Supporting Oscar.
1073;this is one of those rare films that can be watched over and over again.
1074;It is one of the best films of all time.
1075;This has to be one of my top 10 movies of all time.
1076;Great story and well thought out and acted characters.
1077;Nice attractive old movie which is enjoyable.
1078;Worth your time and price!
1079;Like to see more of these in Prime!
1080;He was a wonderful actor, and I am amazed at how forgotten he has become.
1081;This man was one of the greatest actors Hollywood ever had.
1082;"Yes, he won his 2nd Oscar for this performance
I:8445;1083;He should have won for his portrayal of Willie Loman in """"Death of a Salesman""""."""
1084;It is a very good story and all the actors and actresses do a great job.
1085;Fred is great in his drunk scene.
1086;he often had to play drunks in his films and he was always impressive.
1087;It is a sweet scene.
1088;I felt he loved her deeply.
1089;Myrna just stood by him and loved him, she was a wonderful example to me of how to be a loving wife.
1090;I liked Theresa Wright as the daughter, and Dana Andrews was great too.
1091;just selfish and out for fun and a good time.
1092;This film has the honor to be in the list of the top 100 films.
1093;it is truly a classic and a well told story.
1094;I love WW2 history and reading about the war, and so this film sits well with me for that reason too.
1095;"America went through some great changes socially and economically after the war
I:8445;1096;This movie is one those classics that you can enjoy over and over again.
I:8445;1097;It is timeless in its telling of men coming home from war and the struggles they face.
I:8445;1098;The characters and richly drawn and you find yourself caring for them.
I:8445;1099;The men come home to a place much altered than when they left.
I:8445;1100;I really love this story and I think you will too.
I:8445;1101;It is so refreshing to watch a positive and clean movie.
I:8445;1102;Snuggle up on the couch and watch this movie.
I:8445;1103;Good ol' fashioned love story.
I:8445;1104;This would certainly have to be in contention for one of the best films ever made.
I:8445;1105;Unbelievably great acting and a profound story.
I:8445;1106;And Teresa right was the girl every man loved.
I:8445;1107;This is a classic movie.
I:8445;1108;Let's examine why:The Subject: World War II created the world that we live in, today.
I:8445;1109;As a result, I took the tie and effort to study it, and what it did to our world.
I:8445;1110;the Movie: I was also an English major"
1111;I've also helped to make a movie (albeit, an independently.
1112;"hand insight into production values, and my wife's career was spend in the movie/TV industry
I:8445;1113;this is a superb character study.
I:8445;1114;The individuals are superbly drawn and developed, and the plots intertwine believably and flawlessly.
I:8445;1115;who loves this film and owns the same version .
I:8445;1116;Watch something you truly enjoy.
I:8445;1117;We who truly cherish this gem will revisit it often.
I:8445;1118;An excellent representation of what veterans faced after returning home from WWII.
I:8445;1119;The cast is sterling and gives most likely one of the finest performances of their careers.
I:8445;1120;I just received this one today and finished watching it moments ago.
I:8445;1121;It is superb in every way.
I:8445;1122;The black and white is crisp and the contrast deep and not at all grainy.
I:8445;1123;The deep focus shots achieved by Gred Toland are breath taking.
I:8445;1124;The sound is full and rich, and leaps from my THX 5.1 with perfect clarity.
I:8445;1125;we all know this is one of the best movies ever made so I won't say any more about that.
I:8445;1126;havent checked it out to see what it looks like on blu ray yet but i know the movie itself is a classic!
I:8445;1127;Realistic and touching, still seems like a timeless movie.
I:8445;1128;I had seen a remake this is the first time I saw the original.
I:8445;1129;My children watched it with me they did leave the room that's a good sign of a good movie.
I:8445;1130;Terrific movie I would recommend to anyone, especially if one is from the baby boomers generation.
I:8445;1131;I love watching old, clean, black and white movies and this was one of the best I have ever watched.
I:8445;1132;You will be delighted too!
I:8445;1133;It is timeless because it is about the common man.
I:8445;1134;This movie is a classic post WWII movie, showing how our GIs adapted to civilian life after dealing with the war.
I:8445;1135;It was interesting for me to see a movie about an era I lived thru and remember.
I:8445;1136;It is a beautiful movie.
I:8445;1137;Excellent film that accurately captures life after WW II in main street America and how it affected three servicemen and their families.
I:8445;1138;white film reacquainted me with some marvelous actors and actresses.
I:8445;1139;And it reminded me that although it is a movie directed more toward adults, it is appropriate for younger folks as well.
I:8445;1140;I'm more familiar with them but loved this classic because of it.
I:8445;1141;Russell is so impressive because he was the real thing.
I:8445;1142;The movie is worth seeing for him alone.
I:8445;1143;The Hollywood pros, of course, do good jobs in their roles as well.
I:8445;1144;great story, filming and imagery.
I:8445;1145;its easy see why The Best Years of Our Lives won seven Academy Awards in 1946.
I:8445;1146;its right in the white house.
I:8445;1147;This covers the entire emotional gamut, and it is the most sensitive film treatment of PTSD that I can imagine.
I:8445;1148;If you liked """"The Apartment"""" you will like this film too."""
1149;A hidden gem, that's what it is.
1150;It's so much more than a movie.
1151;And resulting effort is sacred.
1152;william Wyler, himself a veteran, knew he needed to make this movie.
1153;He knew he'd pour his heart and soul into the project.
1154;Wyler's brilliance brought the elements together, but there was something much more at work, that created the whole.
1155;He won TWO Oscars for the role and entered the annals of Hollywood lore.
1156;and because of Russell, The Best Years Of Our Lives transcends a mere movie.
1157;It's relevant today, 70 years after it was made.
1158;And, God forbid we find reason to send our kids to fight wars 70 years hence, it will still be relevant.
1159;because, ultimately, the power of the film is that it gives you, me .
1160;a powerful glimpse at their sacrifice.
1161;An intangible notion that all that we have, all that we are, is due to their sacrifice and their commitment.
1162;and that is why The Best Years of our Lives is the perennial American movie.
1163;This is very much my favorite film of all time, and it's finally done justice on this spectacular Blu.
1164;keeping in mind it's a film from 1946, it looks outstanding.
