I:315;1;"The movie ""Sylvia"" was a case of excellent actors doing the best possible with a ""not excellently paced script""."
I:315;2;She was genuine, and I've always been able to feel her words.
I:315;3;Sylvia is a powerful and haunting film by director Christine Jeffs.
I:315;4;Poet Sylvia Plath portrayed by the always great Gwyneth Paltrow struggles with suicides, depression, her insecuirty as a writer and a wife is all discussed here.
I:315;5;"Hughes exceles greatly as a poet while Plath struggles with poem after poem trying to find a ""theme."""
I:315;6;Paltrow is perfect as always in her fragile portrayal of Plath.
I:315;7;If you are a fan of Plath, i highly recommend watching this film, great cinematography, great acting, and great story.
I:315;8;Other supporting cast were excellent.
I:315;9;"whose tale Ted Hughes translated from the French inPh dre: A Play""Sylvia"" has stunning visuals and a gorgeous soundtrack by Gabriel Yared."
I:315;10;"He embodies Hughes' ferocity&machismo.
I:315;11;Paltrow's mother, Blythe Danner, is excellent as Plath's mother, Aurelia.
I:315;12;"In one telling scene, Aurelia tells Hughes, ""She scared other men away."
I:315;13;Plath comes across as more of an attention.
I:315;14;Craig's portrayal of Hughes is sympathetic.
I:315;15;There are hints of Hughes' infidelity.
I:315;16;Hughes is overwhelmed by Plath's self.
I:315;17;their relationship has aSkyfallThe family life of Hughes and Plath is largely passed over.
I:315;18;Its depiction of depression is harrowing, and Craig and Danner, as well as a short role from Michael Gambon, provide the strong performances.
I:315;19;and he is one of my favorites.
I:315;20;So she killed herself and, well, the director rolls the credits and nothing is ever satisfied inside the viewer's mind.
I:315;21;I'm confident in that it was enough for me to write an accurate review.
I:315;22;But the Paltrow effect will probably cause you to choose the first option.
I:315;23;At the magazine's gathering in the evening, Sylvia finds the man who reviewed her, and enchants him with her beauty.
I:315;24;And this marriage is what the whole film focuses on, which is for you to see.
I:315;25;the cinematography is dealt in a perfect fashion, I'm still amazed at how well they revive the old years in the movies.
I:315;26;The film Sylvia deals with the second half of poet Sylvia Plath's life, primarily on her marriage and motherhood and final great creative efforts.
I:315;27;It is tragic for within the wonderful creative person is growing depression, anxiety, and suspicion.
I:315;28;The film reminds us that the human condition is fragile despite the strength and brilliance of creativity and genius.
I:315;29;I must say that the film is extremely fair and even.
I:315;30;She looks back at the car before walking into the rough surf and sees the tiny innocent eyes of her children watching her every move.
I:315;31;What a struggle her life must have been and yet there were periods of great creativity as evidenced by her life's workGwyneth Paltrow does a great job and is perfectly matched by Daniel Craig as Ted Hughes.
I:315;32;The photography and art direction are a concert in gray and black, moody colors to match the brooding depression in Sylvia's mind.
I:315;33;I always find it so heartbreaking when such amazing poetry must emanate from a dark place.
I:315;34;Sylvia Plath was such a person and I can't help but wonder what incredible poetry she could have given us later in life.
I:315;35;Ariel may be the finest book of poems by a woman EVER, vivid, dark, trilling, grisly, and gorgeous.
I:315;36;That book, her last, is available in a lovely new hardbound with previous drafts and interesting information.
I:315;37;"Poets' lives are seldom impressive
I:315;38;"See ""As Night Falls"" for a much better example of a poet bio."
I:315;39;"pic
I:315;40;Plath was explosive (artistically, as well as emotionally) well before she ever met Hughes.
I:315;41;but Gwenyth Paltrow did such a great job trying to capture a complex person that seeing it once would not hurt.
I:315;42;Some excellent camera work and unusual visual angles highlighted by skilled use of lighting marked this dreary, crawling film's real achievement.
I:315;43;In portraying an interior life as complex and as troubled as Sylvia Plath's, the visual medium of film faces enormous obstacles, but this biopic does its best to overcome them.
I:315;44;Gwyneth Paltrow is excellent as Plath, as she shows the poet's emotional transformation from just before her marriage, when she was hopeful, to the desolation leading to her suicide.
I:315;45;the acting is generally excellent, with Blythe Danner and Michael Gambon turning in skilled supporting performances.
I:315;46;Sylvia is a good, but not great, film.
I:315;47;Those who know a lot about Plath may be bothered by the omissions, but this is a moving, often compelling, introduction to Plath the woman.
I:315;48;"Any Plath fanatic worth their salt would totally dismiss the movie because to this day it would be hard to cast an actress who could properly embody Plath and her uniqueness, the way she looked, the way she spoke, etc
I:315;49;With this in mind, realize from the get.
I:315;50;The two passionately discuss poetry, unabashedly spout Shakespeare, and deliberately move forward into their lives together as married academics.
I:315;51;being comfortable with the itch and angst associated with the artistic voice and yet desiring the conventional track of domestic happiness and contentment does not necessarily align well.
I:315;52;Enjoying herself and life ventures into territory that is unknown when compared to the more complex desires of expressing a self she could not fully define.
I:315;53;paltrow shines with the translucent insouciance of someone with great promise that is unaware of her possibilities.
I:315;54;Clearly Hughes and his children were forever scarred.
I:315;55;"john Brownlow's screenplay focuses on Hughes' infidelity with Assia Wevill (who became Hughes second wife and ironically also committed suicide) and Plath's almost paranoid concern that Hughes' popularity as a poet and an attractive man with a ""come."
I:315;56;Melancholy music and dimly lit spaces create an ambiance of overwhelmingly ill.
I:315;57;Paltrow was lovely as usual and Craig most handsome, yet the aspect of her illness was short shrift for the manic phase, felt so sorry for the ignored children who provided no joy, and they were super cute!!
I:315;58;the commentary on marriage with hubby trekking off at a moments notice with darling wife holding the bag with the kids and NO CAR!
I:315;59;for this light I thank the producers.
I:315;60;I found the whole story of Sylvia Plath so interesting and sad too, that after watching it I then read a biography of her life, and then the biography of her husbands mistress.
I:315;61;i highly recommend this movie.
I:315;62;"Thrusted together by thier love of poetry, and cut down by the real world of ""Hey you 2 are married
I:315;63;This finally pushes Sylvia over the edge, and she commits suicide on Feb. 11, 1963.
I:315;64;I know that's how it was with my late wife I did, or so I thought everything I knew how to to keep my wife happy, but in the end it still wasn't enough.
I:315;65;I feel that it was a tragic story to portray, and Paltrow did a very good job.
I:315;66;For starters, I'm a pretty big Plath.
I:315;67;something I absolutely loved about this movie were little references to Plath.
I:315;68;there were also camera shots here and there that I really liked.
I:315;69;in general, I was pleased with Sylvia.
I:315;70;If you know a lot about Plath, you'll probably be very happy with it.
I:315;71;a lot of creative people do not want you to see their work as they do not consider it good enough and many of them lead troubled lives
I:315;72;As someone who writes herself, I have long admired the mesmerizing, exposed, raw depth that is Sylvia's talent.
I:315;73;Sylvia's poems (and life), move the on looker deep inside of her core in such a way that no other can do.
I:315;74;Her best poems written at her deepest point.
I:315;75;There is a creative story to be told her then, as well.
I:315;76;Her poems growth, tell multiple stories in themselves.
I:315;77;Any movie that has such an ending, would touch the viewer.
I:315;78;But at least in SYLVIA we have a beautifully and lovingly rendered version of what happens in the poet's mind as directed by Christine Jeffs.
I:315;79;Her mother in the film is played to perfection by Blythe Danner, Paltrow's real life mother.
I:315;80;Ted Hughes is portrayed by Daniel Craig who manages to maintain our empathy despite the acts that on screen are seen as contributory to Plath's demise.
I:315;81;the cinematography is wondrous, illuminating not only the exteriors of London and Devon, England, but also exploring the interiors of the dark places Sylvia and Ted had lived.
I:315;82;These dark places are wonderful metaphors for the spaces within the mind that comes unwound.
I:315;83;But for the present SYLVIA is a tribute, fair and dark and gentle, of a fine American poet.
I:315;84;For starters, the viewer often knows the story line.
I:315;85;Anyone who knows the name Sylvia Plath is aware that she committed suicide so there are few surprises for the audience.
I:315;86;Much of the credit for this film's success must go to Gwyneth Paltrow who is quite mesmerizing as the tragic poet.
I:315;87;One of the best films of 2004, SYLVIA is not to be missed.
I:315;88;Perhaps we may find the clues to intend to comprehend and even approximate us to the horrid existence of a generous, sensitive and sensible personality of this brilliant poetry, whom love definitively did not take into account.
I:315;89;Maybe such prodigious talent must pay a prize: to shine and illuminate other touching sensibilities gratifying excessively what that soul lacked: affection and love.
I:315;90;"gwyneth Paltrow made a very exquisite performance around this demanding role
I:315;91;Sylvia is a movie about the last 1/3 or so, of iconic American poet Sylvia Plath's life.
I:315;92;Gwyneth Paltrow does a fantastic job of portraying the volatile emotions of Sylvia Plath.
I:315;93;On the other hand, she is extremely jealous and has outbursts when she feels unloved or disrespected by Ted.
I:315;94;There is fantastic acting and quite a bit of depth to each of the characters.
I:315;95;I personally would have liked to see a more well.
I:315;96;rounded portrayal of Sylvia and ALL of her relationships during this time, including her strenous relationship with her mother, and her near affair with publisher Alvarez.
I:315;97;"I full heartedly agree with Frieda, ""Her own words describe her best."""
I:315;98;Director Christine Jeffs manages to strike an evenhanded tone in her biopic Sylvia, which deals with the last few years in the life of poet Sylvia Plath.
I:315;99;Plath dresses in warm colors up until her wedding, after which her clothes and the ambient colors become darker and darker.
I:315;100;All the biographies I have read on Sylvia Plath discuss the joy she found in motherhood.
I:315;101;Her exhaustion caring for two small children, taking care of her home and writing is evident throughout the movie, as it was in real life.
I:315;102;The contrasts between happiness and deep sorrow, energy and listlessness, struggle for control over her demons and loss of control are strangely absent.
I:315;103;gwyneth Paltrow does a wonderful job, as always, given the material she had to work with.
I:315;104;Her performance is sensitive and intense.
I:315;105;The few times she recites poetry, including a wonderful scene where she does a small bit from Chaucer's Wife of Bath in Middle English, are extraordinary.
I:315;106;Daniel Craig as Ted Hughes is excellent, capturing the magnetic charisma of the poet, his bewilderment as his relationship falls apart, and his careless indifference toward Sylvia's suffering and his children's vulnerability.
I:315;107;Blythe Danner, Paltrow's mother in real life, is excellent in the role of Plath's mother and Michael Gambon does an extraordinary job as the sympathetic downstairs neighbor.
I:315;108;i have been a big fan of Sylvia Plath's poetry for many years and have read some excellent biographies on the poet as well as work by Ted Hughes.
I:315;109;There is a tremendous lack of scope here.
I:315;110;As stated above, the acting is fine and the photography appropriately moody.
I:315;111;if you like a good tear jerker,this movie is for you, its well.
I:315;112;this film is very underrated.
I:315;113;Making a movie about Sylvia Plath is an incredible opportunity to tell a story about a woman who was quite talented and interesting,yes?
I:315;114;to make this film a great big story of her life.
I:315;115;It is artistically done and beautifully shot and sometimes takes your breath away, but is about all good I can say.
I:315;116;because we don't really see the romance bloom, (as if the film makers expected the viewer to understand and know the backstory of Ted and Sylvia) we dont feel as much passion and love for the two of them together as we should.
I:315;117;There have always been the pro.
I:315;118;the film evolves or devolves brilliantly: from the sun filled and idealist Sylvia, to the love.
I:315;119;The characters are beautifully portrayed without bias, and paves the road for one of Gwyneth Platrow's best performances in her career: almost embodying Plath's descent into despair.
I:315;120;There are moments in 'Sylvia' .
I:315;121;dimensional portayal of Hughes, and the cinematographer appropriately paints the tones from warm and sunny, to cold and monotonous with her eventual suicide.
I:315;122;Poetry is particularly prone to this myth.
I:315;123;All that aside, this is definitely a worthwhile film for anyone interested in the life of a real poet.
I:315;124;"I do not know too much about the life of Plath, but since her journals were posthumously published, and she is the author of ""The Bell Jar"", ""Ariel"" and won the Pulitzer Prize (also posthumously) for her collected poetry, surely she was a strong enough personality to actually be the subject of a movie which is supposedly about her."
I:315;125;"Sylvia Plath was fairly depressive in her own life, and ""Sylvia"" gets this right."
I:315;126;She is still overshadowed by her more successful husband.
I:315;127;Gwyneth Paltrow does an excellent job in portraying Sylvia Plath and she even looks remarkably like the pictures I have seen of Sylvia Plath.
I:315;128;Daniel Craig does a fine job of Ted Hughes, though I have no sense of comparison.
I:315;129;Their passionate marriage deteriorates when Hughes cheats on Sylvia and she discovers it, moving with her two children to London.
I:315;130;She is especially effective in the second part of the film, when Sylvia separates from Ted Hughes and plunges into a deep depression.
I:315;131;Gwyneth Paltrow gives a very strong, brave performance.
I:315;132;The cinematography for this movie is breathtakingly beautiful, one of the best of the year.
I:315;133;It perpetuates the myth that Sylvia Plath is a martyr to suicide, that it is somehow noble that she abandones her two young children and her career.
I:315;134;In the film, as Sylvia looks into the oven, a heavenly golden light shines upon her.
I:315;135;see this movie for the cinematography and for Gwyneth Paltrow's great performance.
I:315;136;One day there will be a great movie made about the life of Sylvia Plath.
I:315;137;This one manages to be little more than the CliffsNotes version.
I:315;138;A great example of a writer's stress with writing and her personal life.
I:315;139;on that note, the cinematography and art direction was absolutely gorgeous.
I:315;140;The coloring and framing of each shot was well thought out and obviously very intentional.
I:315;141;i found myself pulled into the imagery from the beginning .
I:315;142;"like the energy of the wind pushing their leaves into dancing or the movement of the row boat upon the ocean when she was ""unable to write""."
I:315;143;The truth comes to me.
I:315;144;I also appreciated the subtlety of Plath's ever.
I:315;145;i also tuned into the quietness of Plath's depression .
I:315;146;"She finally speaks it to a friend, saying ""I'm hollow."
I:315;147;Nordic, Russian and German acting schools have been traditionally considered great, nuanced acting schools.
I:315;148;But, Gwyneth Paltrow proves here to be one of the great female actresses of our times.
I:315;149;Her Sylvia Plath is thoroughly heartbreaking and heartwrenching.
I:315;150;Daniel Graig's Ted Hughes shatters the soul.
I:315;151;Such a sad and beautifully tragic movie about Sylvia Plath.
I:315;152;Gwenny does an excellent version of Sylvia.
I:315;153;She's perfect as the depressed poet.
I:315;154;One must dig deep and really work arduously to find the perfect word and phrasing that touch the mind and penetrate the soul to create the artistry of every successful poem.
I:315;155;Thinking and breathing metaphorically are absolutes.
I:315;156;The dialogue in this film demonstrates this but much more than these spoken words is the unspoken, the raw guts of these phenomenal actors in this film.
I:315;157;The music in this film is mesmerizing as well.
I:315;158;I liked the believable romance and love between Gwyneth and Daniel Craig.
I:315;159;Movie kept you guessing as to whether Craig was having an affair or not.
I:315;160;True story so I ordered more information on the lives of the characters.
I:315;161;"mate who was part Great Hunter/part Great Poet
I:315;162;Sylvia, in her unabashed ambition, was as quintessentially American as Hughes was quintessentially English in his public demurral of ambition.
I:315;163;Because of her ambition, her obvious desire to marry Hughes, and the intense emotional persona that many had observed, Hughes's friends were stunned at his choice.
I:315;164;This reviewer has always suspected that Hughes found Plath so attractive because her ambition served as a shield behind which he could hide his own.
I:315;165;By all accounts she was an attentive mother and an accomplished cook and housewife.
I:315;166;with all due respect, despite the dyed dark hair, Craig is fair and on the short side.
I:315;167;Craig is intense and intelligent, and not exactly lacking in erotic appeal, but, nevertheless, he was the wrong actor for this part.
I:315;168;By now everyone knows that SYLVIA didn't set the box office on fire, but I imagine that most people who are addicted to the Plath Hughes saga managed to sneak in to the theater, perhaps covering their faces in shame the way they used to do in porn theaters.
I:315;169;Try to keep away the fans who have devoured every biography of Plath and every memoir by everyone who knew her even tangentially.
I:315;170;But outside of that, it's pretty good.
I:315;171;"Michael Gambon is in it, reminding us of why ""Gambon"" is the French word for HAM."
I:315;172;the two young actors who play David and Assia Wevill are also perfectly cast.
I:315;173;The makers of the film invest the enterprise with a wistful hopefulness, you can tell they really wanted to do a great job, and for the most part, we embrace their hopefulness with a wan sigh.
I:315;174;all the players in this biopic turn in fine work including Daniel Craig as Ted Hughes, the noted poet and Plath's husband who loved his wife and children, yet typically found answers to family conflict at the bottom of a liquor bottle or in another woman's bed.
I:315;175;including a sympathetic neighbor and Paltrow's real life mother, Blythe Danner, who played her mother in the movie .
I:315;176;turn in equally believable work.
I:315;177;director Christine Jeffs deserves credit for the uniformly outstanding work by the actors.
I:315;178;Still, the film painting of the principal character by Paltrow is credible and absorbing at every turn.
I:315;179;Many performances with less guile and technique have won Oscars.
I:315;180;if you enjoy films about famous artists and can look past the shortcomings of describing a lifetime in 100 minutes, you will enjoy this movie.
I:315;181;of course the great irony is that Ted Hughes' infidelity inspired Plath's best work and her suicide made her immortal.
I:315;182;Frieda Hughes, Plath's daughter and literary executor, refused to cooperate with the producers of this film, specifically refusing to allow them access to her mother's poetry, and also publicly denounced the film in a published poem of her own: They think/ I should give them my mother's words/ To fill the mouth of their monster/ Their Sylvia suicide doll.
I:315;183;I have to believe that this would have been a powerful film that celebrated Plath's creativity at the same time it depicts her hurtling towards death.
I:315;184;plath's poems were passionate about death and I can well imagine those who have committed some of her poems to memory inserting them at the right points in the film.
I:315;185;The film documented Slyvia's life in Cambridge and her meeting and marriage to poet, Ted Hughes.
I:315;186;If you want to know more about Slyvia, I recommend sticking to her journals.
I:315;187;I expected a fantastic film with fantastic performances/stars.
I:315;188;But the actors were wonderful!
I:315;189;The scenes with her real.
I:315;190;life mom, Ms. Danner, were intriguing.
I:315;191;if you are a Gwyneth Paltrow fan, you'll enjoy this film.
I:315;192;I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to know about some of the mistakes that young women make when it comes to men.
I:315;193;I really found this independent film interesting.
I:315;194;In this brilliant film about the life and death of one of America's most poignant poets, Sylvia Plath, the film takes a turn and looks at the triumph of suicide.
I:315;195;By using her poetry this film tells the story of Sylvia's life.
I:315;196;The film is an excellent depiction of the life of Sylvia Plath.
I:315;197;Not only does this film brilliantly show her life, but it also looks deep inside the heartache of psychological sickness.
I:315;198;The film makes a person wonder about their own lives, yet at the same time gives a bit of hope and the strength to continue.
I:315;199;I have read the reviews that this movie could of left the poetry out but, actually, I love the poetry in it.
I:315;200;If you like poetry and biographical films, this one is a keeper!
I:315;201;An amazing woman Sylvia Plath could not be played by a better actress than Gweneth Paltrow.
I:315;202;Her bio/story coincides with her works.
I:315;203;Therefore it was great to show to my class.
I:315;204;so tale of truly one of the most disturbed poets in American literature.
I:315;205;"The show really belongs to Daniel Craig, who, in most of his movies, achieves a sense of being the ""mystery man."""
I:315;206;His Ted Hughes is fantastic, but the film tries to work around taking sides here.
I:315;207;When I see extremely talented actors like Gambon and Danner, I expect to see greatness, not small bit parts.
I:315;208;I wish Focus Features could have delivered something a bit better, but all I have seen is a decent, so.
I:315;209;so adaptation of the life of Sylvia Plath.
I:315;210;Fortunately, the cast is superb.
I:315;211;Sylvia Plath was an enormously talented poet who soared to great heights in her early years.
I:315;212;Director Christine Jeffs (Rain) knows just when to bring in the subtle (mostly dark) humor and when to dive into the seriousness of Sylvia's disease.
I:315;213;Paltrow does an amazing job balancing both sides of Plath's personality, and the film can be exhausting.
I:315;214;Thank God for a great cast, wonderful cinematography and well crafted editing.
I:315;215;Paltrow shines and is totally believable and fantastic and Craig is demanding in his role as Teddy Hughes.
I:315;216;Also starring Jared Harris (The Eternal: Kiss Of The Mummy, Igby Goes Down) and the wonderful Michael Gambon (Harry Potter and The Prisoner Of Azkaban, Gosford Park).
I:315;217;"Her most best and honored work would be ""Aerial"" the stuff she wrote before she took her own life."
I:315;218;I had heard about it, and wanted to see it.
I:315;219;I knew Gwyneth Paltrow and her real.
I:315;220;She really did take bread and milk, and put it by her children's beds.
I:315;221;She did close their door and seal it with tape and put a towel at the bottom, so as to protect them from the gas of the oven.
I:315;222;I gave this film three stars because it is visually pretty stunning.
I:315;223;It recreates 50's England beautifully, and captures the isolation of young motherhood very well.
I:315;224;I disagree with most reviewers, however, as regards Gwyneth Paltrow's acting.
I:315;225;Her Sylvia is glamorous, willowy, beautiful in a contemporary way that the real Plath was not.
I:315;226;The film constantly changes facts slightly to support this portrayal.
I:315;227;I guess the image of lovely Gwyneth crying in a phone booth is more arresting than that of Sylvia Plath surrounded by concerned friends, which she was.
I:315;228;Read a biography if you want to know about her.
I:315;229;Gwyneth Paltrow is a very versatile actress.
I:315;230;This was a good movie and thought provoking about mental illness that needs to be treated with constant care.
I:315;231;I have found that true stories which make you say, That would make a great movie are the hardest to make a good movie of, and they often end up looking a lot like cliche television movies.
I:315;232;This is probably due to the fact that the director and writer are locked into playing out the story elements.
I:315;233;on the other hand, true stories which seem too simple to make good movies of, often become brilliant movies because there's so much room for the director to add subtety and humor.
I:315;234;Thus, two simple true stories produced the two best movies I've seen this year: In America and Moonlight Mile.
I:315;235;Sylvia is a perfect example of the former.
I:315;236;I can just see this brash American girl in her scarlet dress nail handsome poet Hughes at a party.
I:315;237;I can just see him jumping up at a pub and reciting brilliant poetry.
I:315;238;I can just see her manic episodes come to life as these two great personalities clash.
I:315;239;And oh her famous ending dramatized!
I:315;240;Do the actors or script provide some intimate interpretation of the story, one which makes us wonder?
I:315;241;I'm amazed to see the good reviews for this film on Amazon.
I:315;242;service to Sylvia Plath's talent and complex, if troubled, personality.
I:315;243;She nailed Sylvia's bleak, moody outlook on life to a T. See this movie if only to see what an amazing and versatile actress Gwyneth Paltrow is.
I:315;244;So she killed herself and, well, the director rolls the credits and nothing is ever satisfied inside the viewer's mind.
I:315;245;I'm sure you'll find him most amusing.
I:315;246;ted: You make great cakes.
I:315;247;cue great offstage feminist moaning and gnashing.
I:315;248;"Sylvia retorts : ""You go out for a bike ride and come back with an epic in hexameters ."
I:315;249;Ted's a wow with the ladies.
I:315;250;Was she born like that, as some people are born junkies?
I:315;251;What a fascinating, infuriating, brilliant, troubled woman she was.
I:315;252;Truly, this was a life story that begs for a decent film treatment.
I:315;253;life, documented events that were exciting are for some strange reason restaged to make them less so.
I:315;254;leigh, Cate Blanchett, any number of great actresses could have helped.
I:315;255;Paltrow actually does an excellent job with what she's given.
I:315;256;It's possible to portray Hughes as the villain that he was while also making a movie that glosses over what draws us to Plath the most: her wonderful creative energy.
I:315;257;For me, the point of this film and the point of her life was how our (Western) society deals with genius, not just intense feeling as many said and how our society abused geniuses.
I:315;258;but let's just say the most ideal gem that we can imagine.
I:315;259;Old time wars and attacks took men with both strong arms and very strong stomachs.))
I:315;260;And by what miracle did she produce those poems (not all of them but many) which have such power to produce powerful positive effects in her readers?What genius did she have and, above all, more importantly, what type of amazing inner strength and drive to express herself did she develop which enabled her to leave us her gems of limitless worth before her tragic end?
I:315;261;that strikes such a deep chord in so many of us?
I:315;262;Is it the fact that this rare and special person achieves a kind of mastery of fate at the last moment, a perfect conclusion to this messy business of life that we mere mortals can never hope to attain?
I:315;263;Could it be that this early death is just one more instance of an artist taking the elements of raw reality and transforming them into something stylized, transcendent and meaningful for the rest of us to brood over and contemplate?
I:315;264;particularly for sensitive young people who came to romanticize her end and her suffering in ways that lifted her and her work to iconic status.
I:315;265;The story begins in 1956 with their love.
I:315;266;As portrayed in the movie, Sylvia, despite her notable talent, is a mass of neuroses and insecurities, always toiling in the shadows of her (initially at least) much more well known and commercially successful husband.
I:315;267;Director Christine Jeffs brings a raw intensity to many of the confrontation scenes involving the pain.
I:315;268;As Sylvia and Ted, Gwyneth Paltrow and Daniel Craig give rich, moving and sensitive performances, and Michael Gambon leaves his mark as a sympathetic neighbor who tries but does not succeed at saving Sylvia.
I:315;269;For this, one needs to return to the source material, the works that have lived on after the woman herself all these years.
I:315;270;If, for example, a studio light reflects from a wall painted with high.
I:315;271;The film director, Christine Jeffs, violates the convention again and again, especially in the rooms occupied by Plath and Hughes.
I:315;272;It always reminds us, subliminally or otherwise, that things are out of kilter between these two principal characters.
I:315;273;Such techniques are extremely effective at establishing this feeling.
I:315;274;Even the sunniest outdoor scenes, and even the most optimistic encounters in their relationship, always present a sense of foreboding, peril and grief.
I:315;275;The fine musical score contributes greatly to the effect, and it supplements the visuals perfectly.
I:315;276;however well or poorly the film conveys the actual life story of Plath, it is a brilliant piece of art.
I:315;277;All the performances are engagingly convincing.
I:315;278;Scenes in which Gwyneth Paltrows mother plays Plaths mother are fascinating.
I:315;279;How a young, driven artist would interact with a highly cultured and sensitive mother is captured magnificently.
I:315;280;But the important thing is that her inadequacies are sublimely well revealed.
I:315;281;And that is the point of the movie.
I:315;282;For this viewer, this is cinematic art at its profoundest.
I:315;283;Craig's performance was the better of the two for me, so intensley studied as to get both the accent and sound of Hughes absolutely perfect.
I:315;284;a worthy attempt all round, nonetheless, to convey some of what was an enormously interesting and tortured life.
I:315;285;SYLVIA, starring Gwyneth Paltrow as the poet Sylvia Plath, is another example of how hard it is to make a biographical film about a creative person.
I:315;286;it's really impossible to capture on film what made Plath and Hughes talented writers.
I:315;287;They gaze into the distance, have an inspiration, write it down.
I:315;288;At least in the movie POLLOCK we got to see the result of all the brow furrowing.
I:315;289;i suspect it was a good deal more complicated than that.
I:315;290;i should say Paltrow is excellent here, fierce and tough.
I:315;291;It's a reminder of what she can do given a good role.
I:315;292;life characters, film makers *must* frame them in the context of their romantic relationships primarily.
I:315;293;A film just draws more attention that way.
I:315;294;My favorite line of the movie is when she says that the truth loves her.
I:315;295;I'd like to see more exploration of the topic in film though.
I:315;296;intentioned film, with a great cast.
I:315;297;plath was one of the finest poets of all time, yet all we ever hear in the movie are tiny fragments of her genius.
I:315;298;The Hours, featuring an inspired Nicole Kidman, did a far better job on the life of Virginia Woolf, but that is no fault of a superb Paltrow and Craig, who did everything they could with what they had to work with.
I:315;299;great performances throughout, but the film could have been way deeper.
I:315;300;Paltrow and Craig do great jobs as you expect them to.
I:315;301;feminist with a strong side.
I:315;302;But her writings had a strong tone.
I:315;303;Anyway it is worth your time.
I:315;304;the way this kind of movie usually works is to hint at great depth and beauty that cannot be reached in only 2 hours, thereby letting the audience's imagination fill in the details.
I:315;305;to marry, to work, to write, to stay together.
I:315;306;From that standpoint it accomplishes it's mission.
I:315;307;I thought Gwyneth Paltrow did a steller job of communicating the small amount of joy and great dispair in Ms. Plath's life.
I:315;308;She wanted to go back to Devon and start over, and was in fact excited with the prospect of doing so.
I:315;309;Anyway, great job all around re the actors.
I:315;310;An A+ film that conveys its storyline in a most successful way.
I:315;311;I tell you, even if you see the film 'Sylvia,' you never meet the poetess herself.
I:315;312;You will see Ms. Paltrow, who did a really good job, and you will see beautifully shot images, and .
I:315;313;Probably you are a kind of movie fan who want to see this 'high.
I:315;314;good acting from Gwyneth Paltrow as Plath, Daniel Craig as Hughes, Jared Harris, Michael Gambon, and very clever casting of the real.
I:315;315;life mother of Paltrow Blyth Danner as Sylvia's mother, good music score (thanks to Gabriel Yared, 'Cold Mountain'), and good period costumes by Sandy Powell ('Shakespeare in Love').
I:315;316;"Though I agreed in my initial reaction to the film, as I think about it more the film is not simply a feminist accusation against men and how their actions drive women to ""the edge,"" but it is a quiet, minor study of depression and its effects."
I:315;317;with poetic camera work and Gwyneth Paltrow's subtle but shattering turn, Christine Jeffs has much to work with.
I:315;318;Though the story rolls along much too slowly and without anything new to add to infidelity in cinema, what she shows us about depression is interesting.
I:315;319;"What I'm saying is that the depression exhibited in ""Sylvia"" is the self."
I:315;320;Keeping that in mind, I give the film credit because Gwyneth Paltrow delivers a stunning performance as the depression.
I:315;321;I found the movie totally engaging for that reason alone.
I:315;322;the film does seem to move at a fast pace, but I think this helps grab the viewer's attention.
