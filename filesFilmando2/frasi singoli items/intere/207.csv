1;As other reviewers noted, the pacing might seem slow, but it's thoroughly involving.
2;The family dynamics and psychological drama amongst the family members are real and harrowing.
3;The film revolves around this death, and the resolution to this conflict is satisfactory, yet haunting and realistic.
4;"This is a film in the vein of ""Sweet Hereafter"", the excellent Egoyan film of a few years back."
5;Very well crafted in a spare, minimalistic way.
6;The Dubus short story the film is based on is expanded and improved upon.
7;Acting is subtle and great all around.
8;Sissy Spacek got the Oscar nomination, and deservedly so, but Tom Wilkinson's empathetic performance carries the film.
9;Sure this film has some nice performances and is elegantly filmed, but I'm not going to shower it with praises just for that.
10;baked.You want to feel right there in the moment, in the pain, in those charcters' hearts and minds.
11;Tom Wilkinson did give a great, honest performance, and was perhaps the one thing that made me feel any sort of grief for the family's loss.
12;the supporting actors were good, but not spectacular.
13;I'm a fan of most of the actors in this movie.
14;Some might say, well that's the point.
15;I call that BORING and it goes On and On and On and On.
16;In the Bedroom is a movie that will stay with you.
17;The story, acting and emotions of the film are intense and played to perfection.
18;A very haunting excellent movie.
19;One of the best in years.
20;I have yet to see a film that has touched me the way that this film has, nor have I seen a film that I am this violently passionate about, but `In the Bedroom' is just that rare cinematic accomplishment that gets everything right.
21;It is not the most devastating story to ever be told, but the way the story is told, the way the events and their effect are delivered to the viewer is so magnificent, so raw and real that the audience quickly becomes so absorbed and invested that they feel the pain as if it were there own.
22;This powerful moment (which occurs off.
23;screen) carries the weight of the balance of the film.
24;In this Field is able to focus, not on the tragedy that befell Frank, but on the hole that it left in those he loved.
25;the film is shot beautifully, in small vignettes that help the audience connect to the characters and fall into the mood that Todd Field and Andre Dubus before him set before us.
26;This is just life depicted in art.
27;the acting here is some of the finest in recent years.
28;Each and every performance comes together to establish real and raw emotions that the audience can relate to and sympathize with.
29;Watching Wilkinson and Spacek interact with one another in mere silence is so emotionally reaching and powerful.
30;Marisa Tomei is also effortlessly endearing as Natalie.
31;William Mapother brings a sense of understanding to his portrayal of Richard, especially as the film spirals to its closing.
32;This scene chocked me up so much because his pain was so real, so realistic.
33;and that to me sums up `In the Bedroom', one of the finest films ever to be filmed.
34;This is real emotion at play here, a film that elicits in the viewer a deep.
35;seated pain that is so real, so genuine that we can't help but feel a part of it.
36;This is one of the most effective character studies in recent years and will remain in your mind and in your heart forever.
37;It was like, well some parts I didn't really understand.
38;It was at that moment that I knew I would really enjoy this film.
39;A plan, that once executed, will shock you, and leave you wondering if their actions were within reason.
40;this is a film to challenge your intellect, so if you prefer paint.
41;i highly recommend this film to everyone.
42;The acting is superb, and Todd Field did a wonderful job of directing.
43;A great deal of the plot is revealed through conversations involving certain objects, but if you pay attention, and read between the lines, then you will be able to enjoy the film to the fullest.
44;This is an thoughtful (though this movie rides the fine line between thoughtful and too slow) movie which messes up towards the end.
45;It builds up very plausibly, and about 100 minutes into it I'm sure there's going to be a great ending based on everything we've learned.
46;yet its execution and orchestration are sophisticated in the extreme.
47;Consequently, this is a film that lives beyond its two hours.
48;In some ways, Field's achievement is such a perfectly consummated marriage of intent and execution that he need never make another movie.
49;It is a thought provoking film with remarkable character studies.
50;I saw this when it was first released and it held me spellbound.
51;There are a couple of unexpected scenes in the picture which shock the viewer.
52;Spacek is magnificent and should have won the Academy Award for her performance.
53;Tom Wilkinson is equally fine and should have won also.
54;Its Spacek's and Wilkinson's picture all the way.
55;It is a dark, moody piece with outstanding acting all the way!
56;It is hard to have enough good words to say regarding the level of excellence obvious in every frame of this painstakingly beautifully made drama.
57;Quite the contrary is true here.
58;This movie shines through its poignant portrayal of a family reeling into existential crisis based on the savage murder of a family member, and deals superbly with the incredible range of emotions such an extraordinary event wreaks in its aftermath.
59;This is a starkly realistic depiction of life in the raw, and doesn't soft.
60;pedal any aspect of the wrenching personal experience such monumental loss tows in its wake.
61;One finds oneself squirming in recognition of just how well.
62;briefly summarized, this is easily one of the most powerfully realistic and emotionally explosive movies of the last decade.
63;It pulls no punches in presenting an unforgettable portrait of a family flailing desperately about in an effort to come to terms with the violent death of one of its members.
64;that if one murder is committed by a good man for a reasonable reason, it is okay.
65;matt, the father of the murdered Frank, wants justice and is egged on, in a sly and subconscious way, by his wife.
66;marisa Tomei's wonderful performance was the one shining light in this movie.
67;A true exampleof an exercise in pain.
68;''In the Bedroom'' is a very intriguing and well.
69;Filled with raw emotion and pitch perfect performances, Todd Field's modern masterpiece showcases a family's grief, and hits right on target.
70;With his superb direction, and Thomas Newman's eerie and extremely well.
71;At one moment suspenseful, the next disheartening and tragic, ''In the Bedroom'' emerges as the most deft and poignant film of the year.
72;"With the exception of ""Moulin Rouge,"" this may very well be the most overrated film of the year."
73;The first half moves along convincingly enough.
74;Tragedy is handled well and the acting is superb.
75;but one of the best of the year?
76;In the Bedroom is a classic example of our deteriorating attention span in today's culture.
77;in short, this is an exquisite film for people who really love film and aren't looking for pure escapism.
78;"In a sense it's a cousin of ""Ordinary People,"" but without the histrionics."
79;Every move and every word in this film feels right.
80;Worth repeated viewing to those who can still pay attention to this kind of thing.
81;Very good, but Spacek with a nomination?
82;It was a good film though that was quite touching at times.
83;I will say that the acting was really good in In the Bedroom .
84;My husband told me about this movie so I bought it and it's very good.
85;"Catching every nuance perfectly, ""In The Bedroom"" portrays the anguish of one middle aged couple."
86;That they are mostly quiet about it is all the more telling and accurate.
87;We also see the events leading up to the murder.
88;Wilkinson and Spacek both shine throughout as the middle.
89;Watch especially Wilkinson's scenes as the film roars to a close.
90;key yet the effect is electric.
91;He can make you believe he's on fire just by the simple act of facing the dawn of a new day as he gets up to go to work.
92;the justice system in the movie,as in real life,are more concerned about the rights of the accused then the victims of crime.
93;some have critisized that the pace is too slow but I think it's perfect for this movie.
94;this movie stays with you and really makes you think.
95;The scenes intimate the sometimes vast difference between what is displayed in public and what is really happening underneath the surface of a relationship behind closed doors.
96;The confrontation between Spacek and Wilkinson is one of the strongest and most potent scenes I have seen in a long while.
97;It is not easy to experience the tension, the grief and the rollercoaster of emotions that the characters face, but there are few films in recent memory that capture these emotions so vividly and realistically.
98;The entire time watching it, I could feel the constant tension between the characters, and that kept me glued to my seat.
99;Then u will realize why this is such a great film and why it ended the way it did.
100;What I do want to note is the direction, editing, and lighting in the film.
101;I found it quite stunning.
102;if you are one of those seemingly few people that do watch movies to witness and imagine other people's experiences, then you're in for a rough yet very rewarding ride.
103;pull everything together into a cute little knot, but instead documents .
104;in almost the most classy and breathtaking way i've ever witnessed .
105;actual human emotion, and a situation not normally taken on from this perspective.
106;this movie is very mature and will not be digested well by those who aren't, but if anything, most anyone should be able to enjoy the scenery and simple artistic value in this film.
107;also, the acting was all very well done .
108;each character was well developed and consistent.
109;personally, i thought wilkinson was incredibly charming, and all of the other actors seemed perfect for their part.
110;although you may not want to watch this film again and again, those who can appreciate it will be affected by it, and most likely impressed.
111;In The Bedroom was probably one of the best films of 2001.
112;timer, Todd Field, it's certainly bound to be a classic.
113;Frank is the son anybody could ever hope for: he's young, talented, good.
114;The script is definitely one of the best.
115;she is just simply superb in any role she is given.
116;Tom Wilkinson is wonderful and so are Nick Stahl, Marisa Tomei, and William Mapother.
117;i highly recommend In The Bedroom .
118;this film is a master class in beautifully understated, unaffected acting(no offense to Halle Berry or Denzel Washington, but these two were equally Oscar.
119;The supporting cast is seamless, with Marisa Tomei turning in possibly her best work to date and Nick Stahl equally effective as young Frank Fowler.
120;As a high school choir director living with her doctor husband in a lobster town in Maine, the incomparable Sissy Spacek unleashes yet another in a long line of riveting performances, this one as the mother of a 21.
121;nominated, as was Tomei in a powerful turn that far supercedes her earlier Oscar win in My Cousin Vinny.
122;In the Bedroom works for essentially two reasons: a strong and realistic plot acted by strong performers acting like real people grappling with real feelings, and its visual simplicity.
123;She and her two fellow Oscar nominees are nothing less that raw on a very emotional level.
124;IN THE BEDROOM absolutely knocked me off balance.
125;This film contains the same powerful force and resonance as did REQUIEM FOR A DREAM and EYE OF GOD, which coincidentally starred Nick Stahl in another tragic role.
126;the performances are pitch perfect, a compliment which has been bestowed on Sissy Spacek numerous times.
127;Spacek is one of the most consistent actresses present who never lets us down with a less.
128;the chills you get are indescribable, like a modern.
129;town Lady MacBeth and her own Out, damned spot!
130;William Mapother, as Richard Strout, is terrifying.
131;when REQUIEM FOR A DREAM used nightmarish striking imagery to enhance its message, IN THE BEDROOM uses images of the everyday and mundane, images far more affecting because we see them everyday ourselves, a fishing lure, an envelope in the mail, a trip to the market, a photo on the wall.
132;Bravo to all those who helped bring this movie to the public and congratulations for the well.
133;earned awards it has received.
134;This has to be one of the most moving films I've ever seen.
135;Adapted from Andre Dubus' novel entitled `Killings', `In the Bedroom' delivers a sharp script and excellent acting to give the viewer a complete movie experience.
136;this film is really substantiated by the performances by the entire cast, Tom Wilkinson in particular.
137;His subtlety in delivery is so brilliantly poised that we are given a devastating glimpse into this mans soul without over dramatics.
138;He elegantly paints a picture of pain and despair without shoving it in our face.
139;there's one scene in particular that really got to me.
140;While it does move slowly, that's a big part of the power it holds for it's in the slow moving sequences of events where we get to see the effect the murder has had on this family.
141;I agree with the critics who hail this as one of the greatest American dramas to grace the silver screen in a very long time.
142;In The Bedroom delivers on several levels, but most brilliantly in the performances of Tom Wlikinson and Marissa Tomei.
143;The lead up to the tragedy is well done, if a bit drawn out.
144;Nonetheless, this movie digs deep into the heart for both love and loss, a difficult task in modern cinema.
145;Thanks to Wlkinson, who practically carries the entire movie, the film gets us through the best and worst.
146;And Tomei also turns in a great performance even though she is a bit underutilized.
147;It is definitely worth your time and money to watch this film.
148;Great first movie from a director who delivered, five years later, another wonderful film:Little Children.
149;Without a doubt, he's a future master.
150;This movie is very heart wrenching with a very sad ending.
151;But it is good to watch.Yes I would recommend this to anyone who likes love stories.
152;This is one of the finest power dramas released in 2001.
153;The lack of musical score gives it that extra raw edge, which is especially necessary in the violent scenes.
154;sissy Spacek makes a triumphant comeback as a mother whose son is murdered.
155;Tom Wilkinson brilliantly plays her revenge seeking husband.
156;Tomei's extra demand is performed wonderfully when her character's abusive soon.
157;credit role proves that he'll perform bigger roles in the next few years.
158;deserving of its five Oscar nominations and a Golden Globe win(Sissy Spacek.
159;This is a wonderful movie for those who are looking for an emotional drama.
160;One of the more overrated films of the past few years .
161;flashy and difficult performances, portraying thoughtful people in realistic situations, they all garnished Oscar nominations for their roles in the film, but its Spacek who stands out amongst the cast.
162;Her layered performance as a grief stricken wife and mother is both touching and frightening, showing how confusion occurring after ones perfect world is shattered can be self.
163;It is meant for those who appreciate symbolism, powerful acting, and for anyone who complains that great films aren't made anymore.

172;A powerful but somewhat subdued and slow.
173;It is for the patient, sentimental, and philosophical people among us who feed on this kind of realistic and dramatic portrayal of everyday real.
174;what makes this story particularly special is its unique structure: it has two conflicts.
175;It is a story reminiscent of any Shakespearian tragedy and the natural impulses among humans in one's striving for happiness, control, and justice.
176;key setting for what turns out to be a mysterious and dramatic chain of events is part of what keeps this movie within the realm of dramatic and realistic limits.
177;The outstanding cast helps deliver these strengths of the film and maintain its subtle but powerful effect on the viewer.
178;a cautionary tale of coming to terms and reconciliation, both Wilkinson and Spacek played their roles to their best and emotions flowed.
179;moving and the best scenes are sometimes those without words.
180;And it does so by touching on the most absolutely messy and complicated issues in life: family, romance, death, class, revenge, and sex.
181;with an intense script and a group of absolutely powerhouse actors at his disposal, the director wisely keeps the direction elegant and subtle.
182;handedness, he let's the actors do what they all do best: create living, breathing, devastating, tragic, and human characters that the audience can relate to.
183;Therefore, I started with In the Bedroom which was released in 2001 and was nominated for five academy awards including best picture, best actor, best actress, and best supporting actress.
184;the acting in this film is superb and is clearly worthy of its various nominations.
185;mo revenge fantasies, see this movie.
186;"Only the rubberneckers of therapy will ""appreciate"" the ""courage and bravery"" of this ""heroic"" couple."
187;Here the love between the characters is truly believable and the viewer is drawn into an attachment and identification with them that is uncommon in modern Hollywood movies.
188;the second, more sombre phase of the film is beautifully rendered and heart breaking.
189;Sissy Spacek and Tom Wilkinson deliver wondeful performances that should have had more recognition in terms of awards.
190;if you are a viewer who is interested in a film which delivers a vivid depiction of the gamut of human emotion, then 'In the Bedroom' is unmissable.
191;This is a film that any adult can enjoy.
192;I kept waiting for more to happen, but the ending was worth the wait.
193;You read the reviews, you like the stars, you seemingly like the kind of movie, you see it's gotten some awards (or at least nominations), so you can't wait to see it once it becomes available.
194;What makes it more amazing is that we go into the movie rooting for it.
195;I suppose we are to believe that the actors are so good they can transfer these emotions to us, but it didn't work with us.
196;You care about the families more, and they seem to be a bit more honest about expressing their emotions.
197;fated younger man in the older woman.younger man relationship seems predictive of potentially excellent performances in Stahl's future (not to mention his impressive resume to date in various productions like Man without a Face, Carnivale, and The Thin Red Line).
198;curdling performance of William Mapother as the jealous ex.
199;The film has fine performances all around.
200;It accurately portrays the day to day life of this common family.
201;That, is where the sheer power of this film comes from.
202;Thanks to the acting the film seems as real as can be.
203;Contrary to what some brainless, boring people have written about this movie, it is one of the finest films ever made.
204;This is an amazingly accurate portrayal of how death can devastate a family and leave a lasting impression.
205;There is a surprise twist at the end of this film.
206;Each actor gives the performance of their stellar careers.
207;A movie for a thoughtful persons.
208;It was a good film, very well put together, but read the story Killings( 20 short pages) before you watch the film.
209;This movie was well written and well acted.
210;Once again an independent film shows that a good story, insightful directing and inspired acting can outperform the Hollywood giants with their $50 Million budgets.
211;This film was produced for a scant $1.7 million and garnered five Oscar nominations including best picture.
212;the story is powerful and poignant.
213;Field's workup is wonderfully done, giving care to assure that we understand and involve ourselves with these characters.
214;It is a very likeable family, with down to earth people that come across like our closest friends.
215;field shows an extreme talent for bringing a stark realism to the screen.
216;The characters are consistent with their development and exceedingly believable.
217;ups of inanimate objects is superb, heightening the feeling of being there.
218;Having spent a good bit of time in New England myself, I noticed that the locations capture much of the feeling of the place.
219;Even the sounds are more realistic than most films.
220;"wilkinson (""The Full Monty"", ""Shakespeare in Love"", ""The Patriot"") emerges from the shadow of supporting roles with a compelling performance in the lead."
221;His sincerity and believability endow his character with an amiable nature.
222;This is a breakout performance for Wilkinson and hopefully will portend larger roles in the future.
223;for Sissy Spacek, this is her sixth Oscar nomination.
224;Throughout her career, Spacek has dependably belted out one commanding dramatic performance after another and this is no exception.
225;This is a somewhat more emotionally repressed character than she usually plays, but she does it beautifully.
226;When the dam finally breaks and she goes to pieces, it is one of the most intense scenes in the film.
227;marisa Tomei may be one of the most underappreciated actors in film today.
228;"After her best supporting Oscar for ""My Cousin Vinny"", one would have expected more leading roles."
229;They never came and she continued to deliver a parade of terrific supporting roles.
230;Tomei is a very visceral actor, with great emotional range and the ability to make any character seem lovable.
231;Her romantic scenes are touching and she has numerous heartrending scenes that punctuate the feelings that the other characters are suppressing.
232;Stahl effectively captures the struggle of young adulthood, trying to manage complex adult situations with the inexperience and naivet of youth.
233;William Mapother does a fine job as Natalie's abusive husband.
234;It is the perfect portrayal of the bully who is only strong in the face of those weaker than he.
235;this is a disturbing and powerful film that cuts your heart out and serves it up cold.
236;There is a thunderhead of new and unheralded talent that converges to create an extraordinary independent film.
237;For lovers of drama and great acting this film is a must see.
238;The action, when it comes, takes the viewer by surprize because the film so lanquidly tells the story of these people.
239;I found the juxtaposition of the men and women in the film with the lobsters, so important to the small Maine coastal town, brilliant.
240;I never thought lobsters could be so profound!
241;"Sissy Spacek gets better with age
242;Marisa Tomei's accent is a bit out of place in Maine, but she's wonderful, as well.
243;In the Bedroom was nominated for best picture in 2002 and is clearly one of the best films of the decade.
244;It is a gut wrenching, thought provoking, artistic masterpiece.
245;what this movie does is stay true to the story and characters, making you feel and experience the emotions that the characters are experiencing, and deliberately grinds at a slow pace.
246;The circumstances are extraordinary, but very plausible and painfully realistic.
247;so if you are interested in a realistic story with great acting, heavy subject matter, and deep conflict, this movie will make you say """"Wow""""."""
248;In the Bedroom is a great movie.
249;"Even if you do not like ""In the Bedroom"", you should respect it as a great work of art."
250;It is a drama that hinges on real emotions of real people.
251;This film is smarter than any of that.
252;"two males ""in the bedroom"" with one female leads to competition."
253;What that competition is and does is the subject of this film.
254;This is a real man and you know it.
255;"Spacek goes beyond anything she's done since ""Coal Miner's Daughter"" and delivers a triumphant performance."
256;on the whole the film is really amazing and well written.
257;As somone who is sick to death of the free flowing cursing and sex in the majority of Hollywood's films, this was refreshing.
258;I commend the director, writer and cast for delivering a really marvelous film that tells a really great story and does it with elegance and reserve rather than heavy handed pandering to the desires of 13 year olds.
259;Have always enjoyed her work and this movie was Outstanding !!
260;Oh and by the way Riley, my hearing is excellent!
261;Beginning with Andre Dubus' story 'Killings', to the screenplay, to the subtleties of director Todd Fields, to the cinematography (the extraordinary opening sequences in the fields of hay with the towering trees' noisy leaves setting the scene for the sensitive love rendezvous), to the exemplary performances by Marisa Tomei, Nick Stahl, Sissy Spacek and Tom Wilkinson plus a supporting cast of fine actors, to one of the most brilliant musical scores ever created for a movie .
262;For this viewer this was easily the best film of 2001.
263;"All of the critics have been raving about Sissy Spacek and Marisa Tomei for this movie, but, in my opinion, the true ""best actor"" here is Tom Wilkinson, who is certainly the carrier of this film, as it is he who shields his emotions from even his wife, he who comes forward to her to rationalize their emotions, and he who brings closure to the painful situation he and his wife have endured."
264;Todd Field's direction is also excellent, as it actually makes the movie comedic in many scenes.
265;The acting was first rate with the exception the woman who was in love with the young man and had an estranged husband.
266;If you are looking for a mind stimulating and non.
267;One of the most intelligent films of recent years to examine the question of justice.

272;So that's the set up .
273;One of course is meant to sympathise with the middle class couple and despise the rich guy's son and cuckold and cheer when he gets it .
274;There is not a false note of acting in this work and it provides a thought provoking meditation on revenge and justice.
275;I still love and worship Marisa, but I didn't find her as interesting as in her other flicks.
276;the story had compelling plots points.
277;A sympathetic adultery, a killing, a squabbling older couple in the killing's aftermath, vigilantism.
278;Blending naturalism with a strong plot turned out beyond the abilities of these filmmakersLike that lady at the movie theater, many people found this film a cheek full of tears.
279;"Anybody who has seen ""Little Children"" should check this movie out."
280;the plot is real and raw and the acting .
281;As the story followed its predictable course, I was occasionally impressed with what a masterful job one or the other of the actors was doing.
282;A lot of talent spent on something you've seen in one form or another many times before.
283;It held the same rhythm throughout.
284;"The movie is astonishingly good with brilliant performance from the stars including Tom Wilkingson, Sissy Spacek, Marisa Tomei, and the grown up kid from ""The Man Without a Face""."
285;watch this movie with an open mind.
286;See what the true art of filmmaking is about.
287;This was the best movie I saw last year.
288;"Tom Wilkinson should have won the best actor Oscar
289;It is realistic and relevant.
290;The scenery is small town and beautiful, which lends a sense of familiarity with the characters and their circumstance.
291;This film is really a so.
292;Sissy Spacek and Tom Wilkinson are superb.
293;Todd Field's impressive directorial debut maps the consequences of inconsolable grief and corrosive ill will on a Maine couple.
294;wrenching, exquisite performances from veterans Wilkinson and Spacek, whose emotional turmoil feels frighteningly real.
295;This is a meditative, deftly paced study of internalized trauma that builds towards a harrowing climax.
296;The son has a promising future in college, and has architectural talents.
297;up has truth on both sides.
298;this film has great cinematography and editing.
299;It's full of a lot of prosaic details that make it very real and believable.
300;The movie builds meticulously and carefully to a powerful ending.
301;Had to watch for a class in college, I was pleasantly surprised!
302;Only then will you enjoy it as it is meant to be seen.
303;In a time when movies are made to earn millions of dollars based strictly on advertising, endorsements, or cool fx, In The Bedroom is a fantastic and refreshing movie with the emphasis on acting and dialogue rather than what can be done with a green screen.
304;The script is incredible and the beauty of the movie lies in its simplicity and near perfect grasp on reality.
305;Similar to the stage works of Kenneth Lonergan, this movie brilliantly develops every character and shows the haunting reality of a situation the characters themselves do not know how to handle.
306;Beautifully done and very intellectually orchestrated.
307;This is one of those movies which gets so close to real alternatives in life that it will baffle you.
308;A smooth, relentless and steady thread towards those situations where we want to take things by our own hands, regardless.
309;Surprising story with twists and turns, beautiful views of Camden Maine area.
310;dimensional characters across the board.
311;Excellent performances from Sissy Spacek and Tom Wilkerson (and all the supporting roles.)
312;The scenes in the (various) rooms reflected how degenerating their relationship was with each other, and likewise, with their own selves.
313;Set in a beautiful little coastal town in Maine, this movie is a real jewel.
314;real reaction to such a situation.
315;This film is a classic and it portrays emotions in a wonderfully understated and realistic fashion.
316;This is the best movie I have seen in a very long time.
317;At its core, In the Bedroom is about the price men are willing to pay to please and be with the women they love.
318;set during summertime in the picturesque fishing town of Camden, Maine, In the Bedroom examines the lives of Matt Fowler (brilliantly handled by veteran actor Tom Wilkinson) and his choral director wife, Ruth (a great Sissy Spacek).
319;aged son Frank (Nick Stahl) and Natalie (beautifully handled by Marisa Tomei), a woman ten years his senior.
320;But it works simply because of the deeper issue of a husband's loyalty to his wife and the strength the two draw from one another to live through a terrible situation.
321;antonio Calvache's photography compares to painter Andrew Wyeth's haunting canvas Christina's World, and the film pays its debt to Wyeth and the idyllic yet strangely tragic images he produced throughout the film.
322;The acting is simply peerless.
323;As it is, the film is still head and shoulders above the average fare, revealing an undeniably potent intensity that lingers long after the lights have gone up in the theater.
324;it just captures your heart.
325;What a revelation it was to see this film, especially since it marked Sissy Spacek's long overdue return to the screen.
326;The Director captures the heartbreak, the infuriation, and the complexity of the issues (social class, forgiveness, depression) at hand, and brings them together for a suspenseful and tense conclusion.
327;knuckle ending, I was glued to my seat, stunned and numb.
328;The Fowler's are a happy open.
329;This is just the thunder before the storm and eventually the storm will hit the Fowler's with full force.
330;In the Bedroom is a thoughtful film that depicts the human psychology of grief with genuine affection that touches the audience with fear, anger, compassion, and despair.
331;At the end the story leaves the audience with a notion that will shake the mind of the thoughtful in a subtle manner.
332;William Mapother (""""Ethan"""" inLost) is absolutely chilling as the brutal ex."""
333;The good news is that this is an extremely interesting film to watch, very theatrical in its use of blackouts which gives the film the slow deliberate pacing and a sense of life.
334;I particularly was impressed with the visuals such as focusing on the curtains blowing in the hallway as you hear sounds of conversation happening off frame.
335;The visual power of the film repeatedly is emphasized over the dialogue.
336;It's a powerful scene, showing how the link between them has dissolved.
337;This is certainly not a film for the action genre set, but it is a thoughtful and powerfully moving portrait of a family beset by the ultimate tragedy.
338;This award winning 2001 film is a deep psychological study of a married coupled, played by Tom Wilkinson and Sissy Spacek, and how their relationship is put under a microscope after a sudden act of violence turns their lives upside down.
339;Many of their conversations and deeply moving scenes take place in their bedroom, and that is where the title comes from.
340;The connections are deep, including love in all its elements and they manage to capture it all.
341;Their pride and joy is their son, played by Nick Stahl, a college student who's romancing Marisa Tomei.
342;The cinematography captures the essence of the fishing town perfectly and we even get a glimpse of what life is like for lobster fishermen.
343;All the actors are excellent and all of the roles demanding.
344;The impact of this film is lingering and makes the viewer think.
345;First time director Todd Field uses the fine touch of a stage director to use the ordinary American Home as a backdrop with incredible symbolism.
346;One of the truly symbolic gestures of the film is Spacek's chain smoking .
347;not so Tom Wilkinson, as the father, in an amazing performance.
348;Wilkinson's ease at demonstrating, rather than talking of his feelings and pride for his son and his wife is remarkable.
349;There are other fine performances in the film, including Spacek, who drives everyone to distraction.
350;or to have an interesting mix of both.
351;The story (and especially the superb acting) give us a mature, complex and subtle look at two relationships.
352;In one we have a love triangle that turns dangerous, and in the other we have what seems to be on the surface, an average, middle age loving couple.
353;the plot takes you in an unusual direction for a Hollywood movie, and the two big scenes (especially the climactic scene), are surprising for such a soberly.
354;Nevertheless, I was pleasantly surprised.
355;Highly recommended for those who enjoy thoughtful and subtle plots.
356;a middle class family, consisting of Dr. Matt Fowler, his wife Ruth, a music teacher, and their architecture student son, is spending the son's summer vacation together.
357;It is also at this point, however, that the movie takes on a beautifully realized melancholy, and truly becomes the film that has received so much critical acclaim.
358;Dr. Fowler feels, and displays, his grief quietly.
359;Tom Wilkinsons is brilliant as the man who, while obviously grief.
360;She manages to infuse the simplest of acts .
361;the film was also beautifully shot.
362;The majority of the music in the film is the beautiful work of the chorus which Mrs. Fowler directs.
363;When it does erupt, the film takes a final drastic, and yet fitting turn.
364;i highly recommend this movie.
365;It's one of my favorites, because of its understated power, the haunting music and story, and how it stays with you.
366;it's done sensitively and in an emotionally wrenching way, with supurb performances from all cast.
367;This becomes important, as you see in the story, in that the mother harbors tremendous bitterness, wanting to avenge her son's death, and is instrumental in convincing her husband, ultimately, to make a decision that may prove to be the couple's undoing.
368;The haunting score of the movie is a perfect complement to a haunting, disturbing tale.
369;"Director Todd Field helped adapt Andre Dubus' story for the screenplay of ""In the Bedroom"" and by the end of the film I knew I had been in the company of master film craftsmen."
370;husband played with seething menace by William Mapother, whose work I knew best from television in shows from Lost to CSI.
371;Her up and coming son doesn't need an attachment to an older divorcee with two children, and the perceptive Ruth understands that her husband likes having juicy Natalie around better than he understands it himself.
372;Matt knows Ruth is correct .
373;in tone I found the first half of the movie similar to Moonlight Mile, with Dustin Hoffman, Susan Sarandon and Jake Gyllenhaal, but the final sequence of this film enters territory I didn't expect for these characters.
374;"I am not often surprised and entertained by a movie, but ""In The Bedroom"" succeeds on all counts."
375;This film had me glued to my seat throughout the length of this film.
376;"It is a great ""coming of age"" story about a young man that falls in love with an older woman that is not quite divorced."
377;Her husband gets very jealous of his wife's new boyfriend because he actually wanted to get back together with her.
378;This is a close to real.
379;"This movie is highly recommend to anyone that likes an ""in."
380;Screenwriters are always saying that it is their contribution which makes the difference between a mediocre and a good movie.
381;"The directing is fine, the acting is superb
382;In the Bedroom is certainly one of 2001's best movies.
383;It has five great performances, three of which were nominated for Oscars.
384;The script is one of those fine ones in which interesting events are happening on the surface, while even more intriguing ones are going on underneath.
385;Like many movies with great meaning, though, it is not what most people consider entertainment.
386;And I have to admit that this opinion has merit.
387;After all, the terms `meaningful' and `entertaining' are, in many ways, polar opposites.
388;In the Bedroom is for viewers who, on occasion at least, enjoy a movie that provokes them and causes them to think.
389;He's the town doctor, and she's the music teacher at the local high school.
390;In such a place, they are at the top of the social ladder.
391;She feels that the relationship will jeopardize his future.
392;He is living vicariously through Frank.
393;Prior to this, he was just a relatively successful character actor.
394;the cast is much better known.
395;Her Best Actress Oscar was for """"Coal Miner's Daughter"""" twenty years ago, and she was nominated four other times between 1977 and 1987."""
396;"She also did a few small movie roles and several TV movies, but I think it's still fair to call ""In the Bedroom"" her comeback."
397;It's her best performance in a long and distinguished career.
398;The Fowlers are such decent, ordinary people living in such a beautiful and peaceful New England town.
399;I thought this was an excellent movie.
400;I had heard mixed things about it, but this was great.
401;this movie hooks you in with all those ingredients.
402;acting that is superb crossing its T's and dotting it's I's with performances that are all those ingredients.
403;very emotional on the scale.
404;"Director Todd Field uses silences brilliantly
405;the movie has many, many powerful and gut.
406;He is matched by Sissy Spacek's most powerful performance.
407;Tomei gives her best performance as Natalie, a good woman, caught in the trap of loving someone so much younger, and wanting to be forgiven in her role in Frank's death.
408;This performance validates the surprise Oscar she won for My Cousin Vinny.
409;Celia Weston who plays Katie, the wife of one of the Fowler's friends, is memorable in a scene in which she and Ruth are going through Katie's family album, and she slips with an unintentionally hurtful remark.
410;Lots of power between these two men.
411;even with this, however, IN THE BEDROOM is powerful American moviemaking, with an assured director and a talented cast.
412;This is defiantly one of the bes movies of the year.
413;if you want to see a good movie with great performances, see """"IN THE BEDROOM"""" right away!!!"""
414;This film is as close to perfection as you can get.
415;Spacek and Wilkinson are amazing.
416;Marissa Tomei perfectly underplays the role of Natalie, the catalyst to the story.
417;As you watch this film, you know Frank (Nick Stahl) and Natalie's relationship is genuine, yet fragile and dangerous.
418;The suspense builds slowly and effectively.
419;head a strong supporting cast.You can see the tremendous care Todd Field put in scenic design, shot selection and character development.
420;These people seem so real.
421;i am a huge movie fan, and rarely does a film move me to the point of constant reflection.
422;This is one of those films.
423;hesitation for contemplative, dramatic effect.
424;a requirement of all good movies.
425;If so, spare me that film, as well.
426;Give Ms. Tomei credit for being a real.
427;Matt is disinclined to probe his son's consciousness of choice in women.
428;"Stylistically, Todd Field's ""In the Bedroom"" seems to belong to the same elegant, tasteful tradition as such films as ""Ordinary People"" and ""The Accidental Tourist."""
429;"Unlike the two aforementioned films, which depict tasteful, Waspy types dealing with the aftermath of tragedy, ""In the Bedroom"" exposes the raw nerve endings that are revealed, in all their bloody glory, during and just after an unspeakable and unexpected tragedy."
430;key way as the rest of the film.
431;is anything but quiet and tasteful, leaving audiences with a Pandora's box full of disturbing questions.
432;Adding immeasurably to the film's impact are the performances, so honest and forthright that they break our hearts.
433;The scene in which they start blaming each other for the tragedy is a high.
434;Capping the ensemble is William Mapother, unforgettable as the ultimate conscienceless creep, all the more frightening for being.
435;will haunt you for days.
436;If you are tossing and turning in bed and can't get to sleep I highly recommend you watch this movie.
437;the film has a lot of plus points.
438;the acting is on top form though and that is really why you should watch this film.
439;There are many flashes or anger, repression and pain throughout the story that are sometimes subtle and sometimes very strong.
440;It is all good there and it has lots going for it in that department.
441;While the story is good it is still 50/50 when all is said and done.
442;I really had great expectations for this movie.
443;The acting was just adequate despite the very talented cast.
444;I can say that I was somewhat surprised by the conclusion .
445;Filmed very intimately but very easy to watch.
446;In the Bedroom starts out as an interesting movie about a touching relationship between a college student and an older single mom.
447;In the Bedroom is clearly intended to be as realistic as possible.
448;Tomei's performance is amazing (although her role is not that big) and Tom Wilkinson's performance is interesting to watch.
449;Nick Stahl is very good as Spasek and Wilkinson's perfect son, although we don't see much of him either.
450;The sound matches, so its duty is to be good and clear, and forget realism.
451;"Of all the cast, Sissy Spacek gets my nomination for Best Leading Dead Fish, providing a perfect illustration of ""going through the motions""."
452;wife, Marisa Tomei puts in a valiant effort too.
453;jane script and framing he's handed.
454;Wilkinson (a doctor) and Spacek (music director) are one of those good doers family with a son (studying to be an architect) heading back for summer.
455;Stahl (the son) is involved with a single mother of two in the form of Tomei.
456;Her previous marriage with the ex.
457;If you are looking for a deep and thought provoking movie, this is the one for you.
458;i walked away with a new found respect and interest in actor Tom Wilkinson.
459;Maine was beautiful, calm and peaceful to set the tone of a lifestyle that this young man had grown up in.
460;The grieving in this movie is intense and very real, the frustrations are tangible.
461;The Director did a INCREDIBLE job with letting you feel the emotions to EVERYONE in this movie not just the principal people I mean I KNEW how the friends felt, the nurse at the Doctors office I think that everyone did such a great job in this movie that it rates right up there with some of the best I've ever seen.
462;Some films are great because of their epical, awe.
463;Some are because they are touching, beautiful films done with a stroke from a true artist.
464;And some are great just because they seem so real.
465;The latter is what makes In the Bedroom so great.
466;nacks and pictures of the lawyer's family.
467;"aged woman, a friend of the family, speaks with ""ums"" and doesn't always use words perfectly, just like a lot of real people do!"
468;But here, there is a new spark of life, a spark of reality, which makes this film so enjoyable.
469;all the actors fit into their roles perfectly.
470;nominated performance is great along with the family portrayal of Sissy Spacek, Tom Wilkinson and Nick Stahl.
471;It takes its time, like things do in the real world.
472;"a great film which was up for many Academy Awards
473;On my top 10 list of favorite movies.
474;awesome performances all around, especially Tom, Sissy and the villain.
475;Hope you treasure it as much as I do.
476;Tod Field makes an amazing directing debut.
477;It held my total attention.
478;To watch the agony in their faces and the timing of the dialog was amazing!!!!
479;This is a rare gem, especially today.
480;is more than just an existential concept to be pondered, but a very real part of a very real and imperfect world.
481;for Ruth and Matt Fowler (Sissy Spacek, Tom Wilkinson) life is good"
482;especially in light of the fact that Richard wants Natalie and his boys back.
483;todd Field co. wrote this Oscar nominated screenplay with Robert Festinger (adapted from the story by Andre Dubus), and he goes on to deliver a pensive film that is visually poetic and altogether involving.
484;"Setting a deliberate pace, he subtly explores each phase through which all of those involved must pass following the tragedy, with special focus on Ruth and Matt And it's a study that goes well beyond the typical rendering of a ""seeking justice in an unjust world"" drama."
485;"He demonstrates a keen insight into human nature, acutely capturing the confusion and that sense of disorientation, that feeling of ""What do I do next?"""
486;as Ruth, Sissy Spacek gives a memorable performance for which she was deservedly nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress.
487;"As embodied by Spacek, Ruth is a quietly confident and obviously domineering presence
488;As the drama unfolds, Spacek delivers a portrayal steeped in ever.
489;It's a convincing performance, extremely honest and real"
490;tom Wilkinson was also nominated for an Oscar for Best Actor.
491;and deservedly so, as this is arguably the best performance of his career.
492;"There is such a ring of truth in the way he conveys a ""non."
493;It's a moving performance, and like Spacek's, one to which many are going to be able to relate.
494;also turning in an exceptional performance (also nominated for an Oscar) is Marisa Tomei.
495;Even with less screen time, she effectively holds her own with Spacek and Wilkinson.
496;"Personal experience and frame of reference are going to have a lot to do with how ""In the Bedroom"" is received
497;Todd Field directs his first film outstandingly and gets amazing Oscar nominated performances from Spacek, Wilkinson, and Tomei.
498;The summer is going by with barbecues and children playing and seagulls calling.
499;field's cinematograpy was excellent, bringing music and image together perfectly.
500;Also his choice of additional actors was superb as they brought the genuine feel of Camden, Maine to the screen.
501;i would highly recommend this Oscar nominated picture for it's intense drama and incredible acting.
502;I'm surprised at some of the less than rave reviews here.
503;this is a movie that is unflinchingly unpredictable.
504;Everyone is totally believable, but you never have any idea what a character is going to do next.
505;And the plot is familiar at one moment and totally unique the next.
506;they fight, they give each other looks and yet we know they are committed to each other).
507;How this spell is broken is an absolutely amazing, surprising and REAL scene.
508;just watch and be totally moved.
509;the acting is uniformly OUTSTANDING.
510;She is vulnerable, in all senses of that word for an actress.
511;Speaking of vulnerable, the much.
512;maligned Marisa Tomei is riveting.
513;she's a pretty darn good actress.
514;She's BELIEVABLY sweet and sexy, and in IN THE BEDROOM, she is stripped raw too, with guilt and sadness.
515;but the truly revelatory performance comes from Tom Wilkerson, most famous before this for THE FULL MONTY.
516;He is at once stubborn, tender, funny, loving, tough, whimpy, sad, determined, intelligent, emotional.
517;russell Crowe was heavily favored by some for A BEAUTIFUL MIND, but it was Wilkerson who really gave the most astonishing performance of the year.
518;It's a bleak and beautiful movie and one I can't recommend highly enough for an adult audience.
519;Dark, quiet, intense, Todd Field's """"In the Bedroom"""" is not only a great film, it's the year's best."""
520;In the Bedroom is Field's first feature.
521;film and he creates the work of a seasoned pro, brilliantly potraying the effects of tragedy on a small town American family.
522;Sissy Spacek and Tom Wilkinson are at their best with pitch perfect performances as Matt and Ruth Fowler, both recieving Oscar nominations for their work (they should have won!)
523;She pulls off the most vital role in this film with ease, handling the multiple emotions of her character like she's been doing it forever.
524;This is one of those films about a trajedy and its aftermath in a family.
525;In many ways, the best part is about the pain of the aftermath as life goes on and you witness what is left.
526;Recommended for serious film goers, those who would rather see a slice of life than watch a football game.
527;Todd Field's haunting, exquisite film contains two of the year's most extraordinary performances.
528;tom Wilkinson, who should have won the Oscar for this role, paints a heartbreaking portrait of anguish which moves him securely into the ranks of the finest actors working in films today.
529;And he is nearly matched by Sissy Spacek's superb, understated work.
530;It's a meticulously constructed, suspenseful film where every line of dialog and shot has significance.
531;class woman whose promising college age son becomes involved with a working.
532;class older woman (Marisa Tomei) with a couple of young kids and a glowering soon.
533;There are some surprises to be had, including a screeching big one right in the middle of the movie which I shall not reveal (although many critics ignorantly have.)
534;At one point in the film a priest offers a vision of faith as as healing and redemptive force (which is sadly not accepted).
535;The movie is ultimately about the absolute necessity of faith and forgiveness for spiritual survival in the face of the most extreme, murderous human situations.
536;"Think of it as a Catholic companion to Dutcher's ""Brigham City."""
537;I especially love the end as it vindicates all departed individuals whose murderers sit breathing for life in prisons instead of eye for an eye punishment being meted out.
538;He did a very adequate job of making us hate him.
539;The scenery of the New England town is also goregeous.
540;The film rambles a lot and many times where it stays on one camera shot more longer than we need.
541;so, they decided (finally) to take matters into their own hands.
542;interesting only for the wonderful atmospherics of the Maine location.
543;A decade after the rest of the world, I finally see this much.
544;but it's a compelling drama, that holds a viewer's interest for 130 minutes.
545;And the performances are pretty good, particularly Tom Wilkinson.
546;If however you want to see subtle, real, and profound performances, if you want to feel through a movie instead of trying to unravel an artificially complicated plot, see this movie.
547;If you want to see a director make interesting choices, see this film.
548;If you want to see how much can be conveyed in the composition of a single scene, see this film.
549;It's really quite stunning that such a delicate, small film has achieved such recognition as the Academy Award nomination.
550;For the small audience that this film is for, it is a great achievement, a truly wonderful film.
551;In the bedroom has to be ranked one the best directorial debuts in years.
552;Todd Fields next move has to be as anticipated as Sam Mendes and even more so to those who lean more to the film as art theory.
553;All actors involved give great performances, especially Spacek who gets the honor of playing one of the best roles for a woman in film in a while.
554;This film may not suit the average moviegoer with it's long shots of silence and awkward outbursts but this is exactly what makes the film so dynamic and powerful.
555;here's the storyline: A fickle, rich, self.
556;Things get complicated after personalities and family arrive on the scene.
557;"Sissy Spacek gives her finest performance since, ""Coal Miner's Daughter"" as the mother."
558;Both characters are complex as we try to figure out what's next.
559;This is a very good case study on grief, regret and the consequenses of actions.
560;Good movie, a bit slow at times, but brings up some very good points that make you think.
561;Realistic portrayal of what grief does to a family when death touches it.
562;Sissy Spacek really made the movie shine as well as Tom Wilkinson.
563;Marisa Tomei played a good part as the cradle stealing lover of the young man (Affleck).
564;This is amongst the most quietly intense films one is ever likely to see.
565;hollywood as one can get.
566;It uses ,instead, the power of silent suggestion to evoke a response from the viewer.
567;Each gesture, each look, each gaze displayed by the pricipal actors, is pregnant with meaning.
568;I disagree with those who say that the film challenges your intellect.
569;The performances, the cinamatography, the script, they are all geared towards eliciting an intuitive, not an intellectual response.
570;The photography in this film is not often remarked upon, but I think each frame of the house interior is a perfectly composed picture of American domesticity.
571;"The movie, then, is very much like a painting
572;The whole tenor of the movie is perfectly encapsulated in a line by Sissy Spacek's character: No words, yet so loud .
573;I was excited to see this movie based on all the buzz around it.
574;Marisa Tomei offers a great performance (for the sum total of 10 minutes she's on the screen), and Sissy Spacek is always enjoyable.
575;In the Bedroom is one of the absolute best dramatic films I have seen in a looong time.
576;In the Bedroom is pure, psychological drama.
577;if you like old movies, you may enjoy this film.
578;If you enjoy superb acting and a total lack of gimmicky plot twists, you will love this film.
579;suspense great, loyal family ties
580;Every now and then Hollywood produces a movie without all the big fanfare and expensive special effects: """"In The Bedroom"""" is one of those films."""
581;Starring Oscar winners Sissy Spacek and Marisa Tomei, this critically acclamied feature deals with the love affair between a young 21 year old man and an older woman who has two children and is newly separated from an abusive, violent spouse.
582;"The script and performances are flawless, especially by Spacek who plays the mother, and ""In The Bedroom"" is one of those films that makes the viewer question their own value system and prejudices when it comes to love that may be questionable at times."
583;The film was nominated for a whopping 5 Academy Awards including Best Picture and it holds a special place in the hearts of fans who admire independent movie making.
584;Spacek, Wilkinson, and Tomei give intense, career.
585;best performances that richly deserved their Oscar nominations.
586;I was most impressed by Wilkinson, a British actor who reaches deeply into his New England role.
587;In the Bedroom is a dialogue.
588;I liked the deliberate pace and tone of the movie at that point, and the performances were all right on the mark.
589;What was an intense portrait of grief turns into a fairly rudimentary revenge drama.
590;But it could have been a great movie rather than a merely good one if more creativity had been applied to the film's final hour.
591;This is a quiet, sort of artsy film which miraculously makes you forget you are watching a movie.
592;I think one of the most effective elements of this film is making the lives of the people you are watching seem completely honest and genuine.
593;they pretty much did, according to my expectations.
594;The main thing I was most pleased with was the ending of the film.
595;What a relief and what a great ending to a sad story.
596;"Don't get me wrong: this is a ""well."
597;In fairness, it should be noted that all of the acting is uniformly outstanding throughout, perhaps none more so than Tom Wilkinson.
598;deep theme that, were there any artistic accountability in Hollywood, the director and screenwriter would be deeply ashamed of.
599;It seldom seems to do so at the right times.
600;The director of this movie must have learned that lesson well.
601;Like a Picasso, the director paints his characters with a few brushstrokes and allows the viewer to participate in his work of art.
602;due to the minimalism and the beautifully developed characters in this story I find myself wondering what has happened to the various people.
603;"It is fairly unusual for an independent film to be the victim of a misleading ad campaign, but ""In The Bedroom"" may be such a rarity."
604;"Although there are elements of revenge within the film, ""In The Bedroom"" is one of the best films released in 2001."
605;Their son, Frank, is back from college for the summer and working on his lobster boat.
606;Matt and Ruth are shaken a bit by their son's new lover, but they accept her, to a degree, when they see how much her son loves her.
607;up or the new lover and his violent tendencies increase.
608;"In The Bedroom, the first film directed by Todd Field (an actor who has appeared in various films, including ""Eyes Wide Shut""), is a quiet, accomplished, powerful film exploring the fabric of a family's life."
609;This is a highly effective way of quickly and abruptly thrusting us into the story, ramping up our involvement in their lives.
610;"As we realize that these characters are already ""together"" that forces us to have an investment in their relationship."
611;Field also depicts certain things in a tableau form.
612;This method of depicting certain things, and leaving other things to our imaginations, also helps to ground the film in realism.
613;In The Bedroom is a remarkably accomplished first film and makes me anticipate his next film even more.
614;field's accomplished direction is further enhanced by the fine performances by his cast.
615;Sissy Spacek creates one of the most memorable characters I have ever seen in a film.
616;Her portrayal of Ruth, the mother, is mesmerizing.
617;Throughout the first half of the film you get a sense of her deepening disquiet and wonder what, besides her disapproval of her son's relationship, might be lurking underneath.
618;I really believed she was in this marriage and Frank's mother and had a history with this family.
619;"tom Wilkinson, probably best remembered for his role as General Cornwallis in ""The Patriot"", is equally remarkable as Matt Fowler."
620;For the first half of the film, he quietly gives in to his son at every turn, and in fact, Frank turns to him when his mother disapproves.
621;He also brings a note of jealousy to the character, indicating that perhaps Matt is jealous of his son.
622;In the second half of the film, his character makes many changes as well, but they are also believable and compelling.
623;the supporting cast is equally memorable.
624;Nick Stahl brings a refreshing sense of enthusiasm and bravery to the role of Frank.
625;You really get a sense that Frank is in love with Natalie, cares for her kids and loves his life.
626;Of course, I didn't, but the fact that I considered this proves the power of his performance.
627;I have never really been a fan of Marisa Tomei, but her performance as Natalie is very strong and believable.
628;Natalie is a woman that is trying to have a happy life, a strong life and an independent life.
629;There is a scene between Natalie and Ruth that is fairly brief, but very memorable.
630;In The Bedroom is a great, memorable film containing some of the best performances of 2001.
631;Sissy Spacek gives as strong a performance as ever, but the movie belongs to Tom Wilkinson as her dutiful but distant husband.
632;The movie meanders at times, but at it's core it makes a powerful statement of the common emotions that drive people apart and bring them together again.
633;coast Maine and have comfortable lives centered on their son and careers.
634;Natalie loves Frank's innocence and the role he plays in her son's lives and we do get the sense that something serious may occur.
635;Life changes when Richard Strout, played by William Mapother, returns to town.
636;when the film was released, critics applauded the performances of Spacek and Wilkinson, and viewers will see that the accolades are well earned.
637;The on location filming gives the film an authentic feel.
638;coast will see many familiar attractions in Rockport and Camden where the film takes place.
639;Even the route numbers for the hidden Maine highways are also accurate.
640;The film is based on a story by writer Andre Dubus, a writer whose words should be savored and appreciated and the pace and length of this film allows viewers to savor and appreciate the moods and feelings of the characters.
641;Although A Beautiful Mind was a knockout film, it slightly takes second place to this stunning story of a family who goes through utter hell when they lose their one and only son.
642;The movie takes place in three parts like a great Russian novel.
643;The first shows the everyday life of the family, how they interact with each other, and the growing love between Nick Stahl and a much older women, Marisa Tomei.
644;First time Director Todd Fields has brought us a truly haunting story that shows how grief can turn into anger, anger can turn into hate, and hate can turn into revenge.
645;As I brought up in my review of A Beautiful Mind, I felt Russel Crowe was the true Best Actor of the year and was very upset to see him not recieve the Academy Award.
646;She was by far the Best Actress of the year.
647;In a long career of wonderful parts, for her, this is the icing on the cake.
648;And pretty much nothing sums up this movie.
649;It starts with a romance in one idyllic summer in Maine, full of bright sunshine and beautiful ocean.
650;Richard, Natalie's abusing husband shows up, and during the fight between him and Frank, the latter is shot by Richard's handgun.
651;rate players can do at their best.
652;Todd Field may feel proud of extracting the best performance from those players, and he should be.
653;and allows us to take multiple views on the events it describes.
654;In the Bedroom is great because it succeeds in making us feel that there are a lot of things going on outside the film.
655;"And this subtle touch is the greatest merit of ""In the Bedroom."
656;If you like this Billy Bob's masterpiece, you will also be fascinated with this one, a rewarding experience for fans of any truthful drama.
657;Very powerful and underrated movie.
658;This movie is very powerful and will teach you many lessons about life.
659;I first saw this movie when my teacher showed it to us in class and I definitely recommend it for students.
660;You know the family that everyone in the community knows and basically the money makers.
661;There is also the Fowler family which also make their way in the town.
662;I certainly don't condone vigilantism, however, I just loved the ending.
663;Very real and very interesting.

674;This movie is exciting, well.
675;It is a flawless indie in all respects.
676;and the acting alone was the best in 2001.
677;Sissy Spacek and Tom Wilkinson performed a tango of fights, glances and dark conversations that molded the movie into perfect form.
678;"and ""I want her to feel better!"""
679;Tomei was definately the greatest part.

682;But remember, the excitement is mostly projected from the pace of the film, the well.
683;And I know those three reasons sound subtle and superfluous.
684;But trust me, it will take your breath away.
685;This film was amazing!Bottom Line: The best film of 2001 with the best acting, writing and overall.
686;In The Bedroom is simply an emotionally powerful film about the the traumatic event that shakes one family and puts them into a complete volatile state.
687;"How can I not give full credit to the mesmerizing performances from Sissy Spacek and Tom Wilkinson whose ""from."
688;This film clearly brought Marisa Tomei's career back from the dead, and her striking performance also got her second Oscar nomination in the supporting actress category.
689;Ultimately, this film is not a conventional family drama, and it's worthwhile for those who enjoy watching great actors tackling heavy.
